Not sure that's possible mate
---
---
---
Because this game might as well be Far Cry online. 5 stacks vs 5 solos, coppers teaming up with plats, 9 ping vs 250 ping. Clueless. 
---
Got this a few days back, didn’t even show off the best part!! There’s roses across the back, hence the name passion

Hhhhhhhhh
---
So you're a scumbag smurf and a scumbag cav leaver.

---
Fuck you're just a total piece of shit. Do you need to farm lowbies for the clips you post?
---
Build a team off of LFG sites. Find teammates you work well with, and go from there. 
---
Wow lol you get kicked for doing well, and for when you do poorly. It's a real Goldilocks situation.
---
Thanks so much i could not find this info for the life of me, oh and love your videos:D
---
100 brightness is nothing. It's just night maps are annoying to play on. As a defender you can't see outside and if you can it is barely. Playing a high brightness would not do anything. For example the Halloween event. I tried putting my brightness up but you couldn't see anything. So your solution is useless
---
Hans! Ho ho, look! Am the plane!
---
They never look above 
---
Oh, you are in Jäger Himself's video ?
---
Nice, well played mate haha
---
The only issue with that is whenever ubi or the console people put out an update that prevents mouse and keyboard, the makers of the m&amp;k put out a patch that circumvents the update. It’s a game of cat and mouse 
---
I was saying put it on 100 because he said he had it on 80, shouldn’t even matter. I’m plat 2 
---
Ah I see! Thanks again! Must have been someone else's camera.

Haha it’s funny bcos were actually munition specialists in the AF

Beat it cunty 
---
Or just do what this guy does and smurf for clips and leave when he gets dropped by cav due to her being too op.
---
Don't give advice, you're a fucking mongoloid.
---
It’s hard to avoid, they probably didn’t want you taking the #1 spot on the leaderboard. Just take it as a compliment of your talent and join another game, that’s what I always do.
---
I think they were low already at this point. Ash fell for my traps before entering.
---
That bot had better timing than me in my 500h in this fucking game
---
This season I swear it’s either a 4-0 or a 0-4 i’ll probably just quit for csgo
---
Idc if you are plat two. I'm also plat 2 but when playing with friends that play on casual and want to relax they are constantly complaining about night maps. Maybe if you lower your ego and look at the lower levels then you might understand
---
I see that sneaky recruit.
---
How so?
---
I was replying to the other bloke asking what rank I was, wasn’t my ego but okay. 
---
MMR is in decimals, so it might be that there’s a small overlap in the rounding of the display number and the actual rank req that you happened to have hit?
---
This is an easy fix by truncation instead of rounding. 
---
I had one of those guys message me, they never actually used my cilp...

Half the cosmetics released are lazy asset flips and recolores.

I hated old Hereford but I love the new one and everyone I mention that I get called a dumbass and get downvoted. I understand that the old one was nostalgic and everybody can have their opinions on the maps and whatnot but god damn does it fuck with me when they don’t even consider all the good things the new one had over the unbalanced original. People just need to quit talking about the old one and start looking at ways to improve the new one like you said.
---
What exactly does this mean?
---
It depends on your Internet Spees. Google said you'll need 25mbps for 1080p60. If Input Lag is a Problem or not, can't be said yet, since it's not out.
---
It’s difficult when playing mute, and you shoot a drone just as a mozzie takes it over
---
Thats because you have a lot more than I do, i only have 6 total but 2 duplicates. If I already had the good legendaries I would be fine with duplicates.
---
Ok my skin just disapered and i cant find it anywhere. AND I DONT HAVE ANY OF MY R6 credits back
---
Please be temporary
---
I am really bad. I hope you can find players and I will join the discord but I’m just looking to get better 
---
Give Cav a temporary sanction for downing teammates.

Cancel the Luison damage boost caused by her ability.

Wait, is this an elite uniform, or justa legendary?

U right

Similar thing happened to me yesterday.

r/softwaregore
---
You'll feel differently when literally everything you open is duplicate and alpha packs are basically pointless. Duplicates suck for everyone, but they're especially bad for super high levels because its ALL we get. Its not that we have everything, its just that we have a bunch of stuff and every single item we have increase or chances for duplicates. I know Ive seen hundreds of items that id like and still don't have but I dont have the chance at them because of duplicates.
---
Sights having nothing to do with the quality of a weapon. Weapon strength overall is all about rate of fire and then just you’re accuracy. If you’re bad with a dmr it’s not a scope problem; it’s a you problem. Work on you’re aim a bit; don’t blame the scope. That’s literally the shittiest excuse I’ve ever heard for bad aim.

Drones have been a reflex test mechanic for 3 years now, of course it’s a habit thing.

It’s a small part ignorance as I’m sure not everyone stays up to date constantly so maybe they don’t know, but for the majority of players I’m willing to bet it’s automatic at this point, followed by an “oops” immediately when they notice

Designated Marksman's Rifle. Essentially the same as a sniper's rifle, it is a rifle that is well equipped for accuracy and to an extent, long ranges. In recent times in regard to video games the DMR has come to fill the gap between a " Sniper Rifle" and something closer such as a(n) "Assault Rifle" or "Battle Rifle".  
---
Most often it is a semi-automatic rifle, rather than a bolt action, with a hefty caliber matching or exceeding full power.

At least Ubisoft spend more on it than I spend my time outside.

So you're saying ubisoft doesn't want to fix a problem that will make the game more enjoyable and likeable for everyone? Huh. Guess they never did that before had they?

Well your the shittiest excuse for a human being I've ever heard of so I mean we both got to see something new today. I NEVER ONCE said I couldn't hit anything with a DMR I never even brought up my own experiences. This entire post was made from just observations I've made within the game. The Acog obscures a LARGE portion of the screen around the reticle of the sight while the scope for GridLocks LMG barely blocks ANYTHING. That's litterally the only point I brought up. But you thinking your some bad ass MLG want to sit there and assume everyone is shit compared to you so you tell everyone to "get gud" fuck off you self absorbed little twat

lmao

It’s very old. I remember getting it a month or 2 after lesion came out (it was my first legendary)

Holy shit me too. They all seem to be games where we are up at 3-1/3-2 and it’s like a switch is flipped and we lose every remaining round. Happened in every loss yesterday for me

i queued up a ranked match with four friends (we were all unranked) a week ago. we got 0-4’d. at the end of the match we saw the other team was mostly gold 1 (one person was plat 3, one was unranked). i truly dont understand how the ranked system is supposed to work, that didnt seem fair to me at all
---
O
---
me and my friends arnt playing ranked at the moment because last season we got into ALOT of games with people on our team teamkilling and just throwing in general (im not even jokeing like 80% of our games consisted of people on both teams teamkilling and throwing for no reson)
---
Tbf I could of gotten it like right after I got off but if it’s not there in 3 hours contact support to make sure nothing is messed up.
---
At least you didn’t die for forgetting your melee button .-.
---
the reaction at the end really made me breath out harder
---
Thanks
---
Damn that escalated quickly
---
Kinda hard to implement, because it will effect people playing with friends and introducing new players. In a team game there's not a whole lot you can do. The theory is that those high Rankers will have to work harder to carry the team anyway.

Bro exactly I get so mad when people always tel me to put it in a reinforced wall. Every time I always place it crouched and on a soft wall. That way, I can just just uncrouch and shoot them through the same wall I put the mirror on when I see them through the mirror. Hopefully that made sense haha

If Ubisoft gave more of a shit about their player base than trying to sell new cosmetics and year passes, more of us would probably stick around longer.

Is it me or is this sub saturated with people posting bad skins... Like we get it
---
Well i want to play realitick mode but the time i get in a round with it is mostly 10 minutes to 20 minutes.
---
At least you got a funny charm. The only legendary I got was an alpha pack charm. It's funny, but not for the same reason.
---
I mean you literally have the answer in your comment, Mozzie at best nets 2 drones that are very visible and Mozzie seems like he should generally be played as a roamed meaning you aren’t gonna be moving your drones very much 
---
Echo has a guaranteed 2 drones that are invisible and can stop plants and gadgets along with scouting ahead for teammates and disorienting the enemies as your teammate pushes them and is a roamed so he’s gonna be on site using his drones the whole game as well 
---
A large part of Mozzie is his drone denial he’s right witty shit at intel gathering, if you’re gonna be driving his drones around to gather intel you should’ve played echo instead, and if you’re gonna place the drones watching a hallway and then roam you should’ve probably played Valk 
---
All in all he’s good and drone denial and is probably a better roamed than Valk meaning he fits mostly into this position where you just set up your drones around the objective and use them to possibly get a good flank off as his weapons are better than Valk’s and he’s a 3 speed but his utility is pretty poor compared to the other options 
---
Yeah its a new one. 
---
:)
---
How did you get the invitational skin?
---
Personally I wouldn’t, there are much nicer skins that you can get in game

ohh ok i understood. my keyboard is alfawise mechanic. for this reason noises like that..

Yeah I get that sometimes as well. What I find works is just cancel the queue after 2:30 minutes. I once waited 30 minutes for a game, canceled and restarted the queue and got a game in 25 seconds.

It's funny, because I have the Spartan Authority, but I prefer this.
---
But we are human, so our opinion differs of course.
---
You shouldn't have to start over because it will ask you to login to uplay. But I'm confused why you would buy the steam version if you already own the game.
---
its mostly a convenience issue. I prefer Steam so much more than Uplay.
---
The steam edition still opens up uplay so there is no actual difference between the two, just play the one you already own. 
---
Rule #1
---
its also because i go to internet cafes sometimes and they require steam edition not UPlay. 
---
idk ubi server is broken these days

Nobody cares, even a little bud.

I'd say take the CSGO-approach.

First offense is 30 minutes, then two hours, 12h, 24h, 1 week. Something like that.

Just make it require 5-10 matches(ranked) to lower it one step.

Fuck you for having all the operators,fuck... you...
---
You are the polar opposite if your main
---
Sometimes, in matches, I’ve had people kicked just for inflicting enough team damage, not actually killing them. Maybe this is the new system bleeding through? Could just be a glitch, tho.
---
Because people have mains and waifus and stuff
---
I think this doesn't matter, because your GPU just has decode everything, like it would have to, if you were watching a Stream. The game isn't running on your Laptop, it's running on Google's Servers. 
---
You are sending Input to Google (like Pressing X), Google Receives the Input, renders the Frames and sends it back. Your GPU just has to convert the sent bits to Frames. 
---
Of course it's oversimplified, but that's basically how it works.

Yea but the headgear doesn't change the aim pov or affect the hitbox

---
Ash’s icon is actually pretty neato in blue.

Frost and buck are 10k and all operators are getting cheaper as they get older
---
In the time it takes for you to save for a new operator, you’ll be able to get good at another.

What’re your sound settings. I can tell exactly where enemies are in the clip but when I’m playing I barely hear footsteps unless they’re sprinting.

Nah , not much of an achievement hunter
---
nah look at the points it says heartbeat
---
So she's basically a psychopathe. Is that why she's so popular with team-killing trolls in Terrorist Hunt?
---
Exactly.
---
And if i have to choose, i will take the 60 FPS with the same graphics than 30fps (who will be unstable in charged area) because of 1 option.
---
More if the result at long range is not so great.
---
MOIN .!..
---
Va chier, bâtard d'américain.
---
T'as qu'à apprendre d'autres langues, sale raciste!
---
I'm pretty decent all around, I main Dokkaebi on attack, so I have to be able to go from DMR to SMG in high intensity situations. I also play on xbox, might just be you
---
Lol, learn grammar before trying to argue with someone. Your clip* you’re fuckig bad* people like you are what make the siege community toxic. You freak out like this when someone states a fact.
---
Also, fun fact. We cant see the enemies ping, or the docs ping. shocking. And also, i am infact 2 bitches. And one incident doesnt mean theres an advantage. Siege has shit hit reg. and why am i taking so long to reply? I have a life, i dont spend 24/7 on reddit replying to idiots like you.
---
It was so much better than the stupid cards 
---
Jagër: its over thacther,i have the high ground
---
why are they all stacked lmao
---
Video or didn’t happen.
---
You should make a small like 10 sec clip of this and just put the Cod zombies noises over it. That would make this so much better than it already js
---
have you recorded it?
---
It's an opinion you retarded faggot. Kill yourself
---
There’s a lot of pointless rooms but it’s certainly more competitive than Theme Park. But let’s not mention that shit-show.
---
Need proof
---
L E G E N D A R Y is strong with this one
---
The recoil isn’t why they’re bad 
---
You may have the hd texture pack installed. That would push up loading times a lot 
---
I don’t have a video but it’s possible in custom games so if you want a first hand experience try it
---
On PS4 sorry no recording try it in custom games
---
I don't
---
Try it in custom games with friends
---
Names are:

Jasper Gem for the  SPD 9mm

Convoy for the Super Shorty

Gila for the M249 SAW

---
F90 didnt have a glitch like the others
---
TELL ME WHY
---
you have the share button on ps4, I really wanted to see it :D
---
I have and every time it gets over 5 mins
---
You could still get a few goes before it increases, but quite honestly, if you're going to disconnect 5 times within 5 games or so, you should stick to Casual, imo. 
---
You're not just ruining your own ranked experience, but forcing your team to play 4v5. I also only played casual when I had issues, and didn't touch ranked for a season or two when my internet was fucked.

Lmao I highly doubt that chief. If they are saying that it's a disadvantage then why are there so many clips prove that wrong like the one that I sent you earlier https://youtu.be/hz9o9MEI-K0 and thanks for the compliment btw 😉
---
That Ying was garbage
---
The drone jump wouldn’t work. I was surprised when it happened to me when I jumped in (thought the drone landed on a broken object or something). Honestly, it was just funny when it happened to the player model. 
---
Simply downvote it an keep it moving and most people get depressed about stuff they can’t control 
---
Can Montana have his shield up?
---
They are
---
I’ll play anyone myself just to help the team but I prefer IQ on attack and anyone really in defence
---
thank you, and sorry for miss posting. I will make sure to get it correct next time.
---
Did you have a shotgun? 
---
Oh my gosh yes I saw this last night looking at some of my old recordings from around March of 2016 I love this screen much better!
---
manlet
---
I’m just saying take that suppressor off doesent have anything to do with the clip it will just save you from shooting the enemy 1 or 2 extra times 
---
Cuz posts Luke these bomb the recent tab

I love it. The blue around the mag and the skull are nice, but it also looks pretty tacti cool still because of the tan. One of the best legendaries IMO. I love simple skins.

Sounds sick man and would love if it came to iPhones as I just bought a new one so I won’t be getting any other phone for a while
---
Legend says he is still in queue to this day.
---
Actually very plausible.
---
OP was using the nerfed MP5 which does 27dmg at range. 
---
Plausible that there was enough damage falloff to reduce the damage enough(he's playing Doc near the 2 windows with the bomb on top floor site, aimed towards the doorway), and shot through the wooden counter, reducing the damage even further. Victim could also be a three armor as well.
---
Everyone even the doc himself was
---
Better than the pony one lol 
---
Why is this here
---
Did this old screen also show the operators different uniforms? Say if the user bought one for that operator could your squad see that?
---
My modded controller has two extra paddles underneath I use to lean with and the triggers don’t have to travel so I can shoot a little faster. 
---
It’s a wildcat controller so it’s not like I’m using an actual modded controller.
---
Also, MnK is ridiculously hard. I only use that in my Smurf to mess around at lower ranks 
---
It’s in a old bundle with many other skins I bought it in year 1 
---
This happened right after I enabled 2fa. Virus checked PC and fine. Very odd.
---
Planned on console ? Yeah no
---
His ping magically doubled....  
---
Sounds like you are just looking for a reason to blame a loss instead of improving.
---
You aint pro. 
---
EXACTLY, I love the color's contrast together, and the kinda modern-sleak/slick look, I will defenetly be a brainless ash-main for a few days.
---
They’d still be able to hear if they used airpods...
---
Waste of time so I think they scrapped it.
---
Looks like any grey skin...
---
Nope, not new. One of the best skins in the game IMO though.
---
oh god oh fuсk he can’t hear us he has airpods in

N-i-c-e

You have a picture to suggest that I do next?

I mean i get it it just doesn’t make sense

Nah, she’s just an uglier chunkier She-Hulk without any powers.
---
This is the acog police! I'm going to confiscate your acog!
---
This game takes a little patience my friend, couple weeks from now you’ll love it trust me.
---
I was having a bit of trouble before the update, every time I tried to find a new match after finishing one it would just keep loading and saying “creating squad”. It got to the point where I had to close the game and restart it after every match. I’ve found it better since the update though 
---
No...
---
Why are they all peeking tho 😂
---
Looks cool, but I personally rock the orange universal so my baliff looks like a flare gun
---
All trap ops are trannies
---
Well I think actually changing your gender is wrong. But I know the thing that compels you to do it is a mental illness which is why I don’t mean to be offensive
---
Spend money. They are purposely a grind to incentivize buying them. The dlc and constant support is free, they gotta pay the bills somehow.
---
All the sites suck anyways so there really isn't a point in choosing
---
It’s a shame I’ll never play this game again though
---
You refracting from learning other languages is selfish behavior, burger
---
Thats a good point
---
The very last frame of this video makes me think IQ's gonna join Nomad in the missing fingers club.
---
Ubisoft got tired of porn artists drawing their more feminine characters with dicks, so they created Gridlock.
---
That is identical of how it is right now 
---
Id rather have all legendaries for the 416 then the GSG9 pistol... ;(
---
You under estimate my power!
---
Yeah Ofc! It's my favorite gun both irl and in game
---
Jesus fuck that spots gonna make me paranoid af now. Just gonna stare at that fridge during setup
---
Post hog dumbass nerd
---
echo buff too op, pls nerf
---
Thats awesome, do you have to chose a dif cosmetic each game you play? Or do you have a go to.
---
No
---
Yeah it’s pretty annoying
---
MA go to is undoubtedly the invitational skin, but I do shuffle around with other ones as well, all depending on the uniforms I use and whatnot to keep things interesting
---
No 
---
Like the dwarf psychos in Borderlands
---
Wow.
---
Mossie?
---
I also understand that, witch is why it should be an increased time limit, first leave banned for a said amount of time, 2nd leave banned for more time etc.
---
Yes it might be a fix to the people who leave when they die, but this will also fuck with people who NEED to leave a game. The elo isn't the problem its the bans that should increase.
---
I don't really come across a ton of leavers in high plat/dimoand, could I ask what rank you are playing at?
---
K//D 9.00 what in the fuuuuuck
---
&gt; This is some real galaxy brain stuff
---
realy
---
*ranked beta intensifies*
---
Black Ice is epic tho.
---
Yeah but that was a presidential plane. They could make it a gigantic plans (which might not be realistic but who cares, we're getting unicorn skins) 
---
Zofia
---
What if my power goes out for 1 hour, so I can't play ranked for a day due to my power going out? Bit excessive to me. 
---
I like thermites for some reason.
---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth (you’re right I hate seeing this shit over and over)
---
Kill cam is off you got killed. Dont blame ubi

They disabled it because of technical issues. I’m pretty sure they are going to put it back in as soon as possible.

just had one. Kept killing everyone on the enemy team before we could even find them. Knew all the call outs kept calling people trash, and i left matches 3 times to find a new team and kept getting paired up with him. This is first time playing in 3 months and I have already lost interest because of smurfs in the newcomers playlist
---
r/unexpectedwomble
---
Kind of think he was joking and not being rude but ok.
---
Yes, I did, whoops.
---
The people who NEED to leave the game aren’t high in numbers.
---
I’m in gold. Of course there aren’t a ton of leavers in high plat, they’re all five stacks

I really love this video! The editing is minimal but still e p i c

aaaand they're all ugly as hell

But wait. What if that was Harry? It would make sense he is watching the drills and it may be confirmed in the thatcher boi short (I haven’t compared announced voice at beginning to Harry)
---
Nomad didn't get the memo..
---
No, I got a connection error and booted me out of ranked just yesterday, I couldn't rejoin the match, matchmaking kept trying to force me into a new ranked game instead of the game with my squad. It's about as good as it can get without being able to account for all circumstances. Some people just suck, but I'm not willing to suffer more than I already have to so you can punish others harsher, their level of suck is punishment enough
---
IQ's LMG is really good, and her gadget is way more useful than ash's breach grenade
---
*Hot Chocolate*
---
The other 99.9% of the time, for him to be able to engage enemy’s 
---
Kill cams aren’t always a 100% accurate replay of what happened, twitch probably took your head off.
---
You don’t have the gold dust skin from his pro league set
---
It is 
---
A little bit late to the party.
---
But how do you know that for sure you don't know what goes on behind closed doors, I do understand the frustration but you can't do somthing like this without fucking over people who accually can't play because of somthing that happend witch to me doesn't seem fair even if it does cut down on leavers.
---
It would accually surprise you that they arnt all five stacks. Even in low to high gold I haven't come across a ton of leavers. 
---
Nope, unfortunately I wasn't around when it came out, I also don't have glacier and whatnot
---
No it fucking isn’t. Every single game I play someone leaves. Siege should also improve servers, but the punishment is so light. 15 minute ban and a game loss? 
---
Do you know what kinda train this is?
---
Fake bc 16 sec left 
---
Pulse used to be OP, with insane range on scanner and the time it took to switch between scanner and weapons was practically instant, they had to nerf him several times to get him where he is at today.
---
Wrist still looks a bit uncomfortable

Shield De-sync at its finest. 
---
i am going to murder your family
---
Everyone else is recruit. It's common fucking courtesy at that point smh my head
---
It doesn’t matter what goes on behind closed doors, life will get in the way from time to time. That doesn’t mean that a good thing shouldn’t be implemented. You’re a dumbass if you actually think any of the bullshit youre spouting.
---
Meanwhile I get matched up against the sweatiest tryhards that play like it’s a pro league match.
---
K guy. Won 6 for 7 games yesterday and top fragged for two of them.
---
Nice 
---
What’s your favorite color?
---
Uhm orange 😂. I feel like you’re about to make a point here.
---
Kill cam not hit reg
---
Also on hostage, the hostage could just get up and leave. 
---
The only time I think defense wins is for bomb. Could argue the “generic cop” won’t have time to get in and defuse 
---
But when we where playing in the round we where playing it seriously just having a bit of a laugh in prep/droning etc, we where also helping him with callouts and walked him to a few kills, just after that horrable round (we've all had them when everything just goes wrong) he lost his shit but don't put your mic on and scream at me when you have never even said a word to anyone.
---
I do understand where he came from but he did cause the defeat after getting kicked and killing me and a friend lol 
---
Yeah i know that change. I just tought that some guns got their own sights.
---
Defuser planted !
---
r/Mozzie_IRL
---
Huddling together like that will always end in disaster
---
The Insurgency games are pretty much like this, but I think most people are willing to sacrifice some realism for a less stressful game.
---
Ah okay I get what you meant now. Yeah that’s not okay. But I wouldn’t say that’s the community.
---
Aw, too bad:(
---
I recently had a whole 5 stack of latin players play on NA and the results were ridiculous. 
---
The whole game was hardly playable because our ping was so high
---
Yeah, but I think it has to be consistent, otherwise new players would get hopelessly confused as to when defenders get that type of advantage 
---
It's okay you can save up renown and buy specific one you like :D I love that part abt siege
---
Just lose a match and you will reach the 2899 eventually
---
Mozzie is the new lord... or mini lord actually 
---
I gotta admit I do this with pulse all the time on plane. Just listen if they come up the stars and make a small hole on the bottom of the barricade.
---
The only elite skin I have is the free ash one everybody got.
---
You literally need to kill just a few people without dying and you can have that K/D. This means nothing
---
Ima be honest I meant to make this comment on a different post
---
Pay 2 win
---
No it wasn’t 
---
I disagree. Mainly because I’m just finding it
---
No.
---
As an avid fan of portal, I can say that you fucking killed it with this meme
---
Ash doesnt count 
---
Winning and top fragging is easier the lower your rank is.
---
He just got a comms ban for a few days
---
I’m fucking dead man😂 you should’ve played it off and made a random point 
---
Oh yeah, that’s the point of my comment. I think that if it was integrated correctly with really good servers, it could work, but honestly that’s just me dreaming because “I shot him so many times, but FUCKING ASH JUST CLICKS ON MY GODDAMN HEAD jgjahsifnrbfjxx.” 
---
Thank you, this rant sponsored by a mildly perturbed gamer.
---
Yeah em new games and em gameplay friendly mechanics. I miss the good ol games of old games that you probably haven't played, har har har. Those were REAL games.
---
Now he can ride the drones too
---
Not really. There’s only a few game modes so it would be figured out pretty quickly. 
---
Could even have the narrator say quick explanation as to why. 
---
It’s not really visually consistent if anything it’s the opposite, the shop includes models of everything along with uniforms and headgears showing models without very good simplistic designs also along with the main menu screens which now feature animated models, and the operator loading screens have a weird font that no other place in the game has 
---
Nice editing
---
Go to bed siege you're drunk 
---
Yikes borther 
---
Having fun ??
---
Nah. If it was Cav's Luison, it would've said "Luison bonus"
---
I’ve also had this problem I bought the southern regiment camo for gridlocks lmg and assault rifle and it’s been completely removed from my camos and the store
---
I don't know what I love more, the angry eyes, or the burnt leg. Good work, friend!

Are we skipping the fact that we almost had a stroke reading the caption 
---
*hole
---
K
---
That's not true, while the damage multiplier may be smaller or non-existent, they do get headshots and can receive the point bonus indicator from them
---
Yeah csgo is probably even more toxic but at least it’s something different.
---
Did they increase her recoil?
---
Now you say, it actually does
---
Worst feeling tbh 
---
On his pov the hatch isn't broken. Thats how this happens. Your screen says its broken so you fall but then the server says no and you go back up
---
Season pass gang
---
Yeah, one of his main weapons should be a micro uzi, would fit him better
---
Why not do the photo thing?  Our bakery can take a picture and put it in icing on a cake somehow. But kudos for the hard work! Looks good!
---
You get all those black ices when your silver 3. Im here a gold and only have black ice for ump and g36c. Sad life :(
---
Vigil
---
It’s a smurf
---
Squad on PC
---
R6 stats is a really useful stat tracking app
---
Ash looks so poor
---
I'd recommend using twitch or yt next time and clipping it
---
Meanwhile I play casual and can’t get a kill with an actual gun 😢 
---
Yea
---
Yeah I have everything setup I’m just a lazy shit
---
I turned the picture so it would look normal for us
---
Let me give you an example so you can understand it easier. Shitty player using non crutch operator performs like a silver 4. Same shitty player using crutch operators performs like a gold 2. Now good player using non crutch operator performs like a plat 2. Same good player using crutch operator performs like a plat 2/plat 1 player. Crutch operator compensates some weak points of the shitty player, while the same crutch operator doesn't compensate those weak points for the good players, because he doesn't have those weak points (because he's better). Is the decrease in skill gap more visible now to you? 
---
I'm new but a good clash is a awesome from what I have seen. With a good friend behind her or with the proper roll when switching weapons she can get kills and whittle down the enemy team.
---
Oh, ok.
---
I honestly dont understand what's so great about Black Ice like I get it, it looks pretty good but I'd prefer something else
---
Yeah. I don’t think it pulled so hard horizontally.
---
I don’t by packs so this is a big deal for me
---
But how do you distinguish between unintentional and intentional leaving? 
---
mozzies RONI is fucking amazing. besides the reloading animation the roni is better than commando 9
---
I understand the pain of high ping, 
---
One man once said "you internet shit"
---
And he was right, my internet was bad ☹
---
But i was still better than him 
---
Nice man, also sick monitor stand.
---
If you wanna stick with realism, a single pellet would be enough to kill someone but that would be kinda op
---
That’s just cyber bullying 
---
“Career”
---
I've never had that happen actually, would be great though, until Monty pushes and just forces chanka off anyways
---
Same here , glaz’s OTs-03 was my first black ice as well plus I’m a glaz main
---
I mean that's fair and I've gotten one or two black ice but I don't really think they're that great but whatever floats your boat I guess
---
Yee
---
U don't know how he was played right? U could combine him with drones jsckel or dokkkabi so u had a exact location and bang dead thats a 100 percent kill.
---
The point is globals are bad and that a coordinated team is always better with Cartain ops. A slightly op operator in Gold plus is worse than a slightly underpowered operator in Gold and below so pls just shut up 
---
How tall is he
---
Thanks lol
---
Say that to the person that killed the enemy I was interrogating, and protected himself by saying "I needed a kill" 
---
It is amazing but I still like the reloading animation on the commando 9
---
The new maps will come to you after about 5 or so matches. Go on Customs and walk around if you want to get a total feel for them. 
---
I’m not and I don’t really like him much but I do like getting nice skins cool.
---
We lost that round too
---
:'(
---
There's no reason to do this at all
---
Try him out sometime,you might even get a triple collateral 
---
I *strongly* agree
---
Ah, I see you're a man of Cartoon Network. 😀
---
Yeah maby!
---
Ouch
---
#NO RUNNING IN THE HALLS
---
It's cool I already figured it out
---
Well it limits how people play, run outs are a risky strategy but it can work if you know what your doing. Solution: play ranked or get a coordinated team together, you'll still get run outs no matter what but maybe smarter 1s and not as frequently
---
Don’t disrespect lord Chanda
---
Why isn't he UPSIDE DOWN
---
That aim hurts my eyes
---
Yeah man . Plus with Jackal you can do your own thing. With Mira, people can mess your strategy by putting up barricades or popping your mirrors to be greedy. Good luck! Hope you like him. Run the ACOG. 
---
Who cares about the kill, it is the missed interrogations that are really the problem.  If someone intentionally leaves the game to not be interrogated why do they get to just rejoin with no penalty. Flat out cheating.
---
Leaked Blackbeard buff?

Same has been happening with me on ps4, season pass owned also.

This was an overlooked part of the announced change that coins would have expiration dates.
---
In that announcement that also said it was retroactive and would apply to older coins as well so you will lose any coins that you've held for a while, this message shows how many you will lose.
---
After his nerf I can't blame him

Tower is great. Except for that window room.

Grenades and C4 should be able to do the advanced deploy! It would be so nice.

I was just in a casual, doing some warm-ups and i decided to play thermite for a change. and someone on my team picked hibana, later on in the round she shoots her Kairos and says "as my friend would say "time to ring some ears" then literally less then 30 seconds later she shoots more and says "as my friend would say "really big fucking whole coming right up" it was super adorable to hear hibana say that but also wack. just thought i'd share my story C:

No. At least not any time soon. But i would love something like Outbreak again. Maybe more meteors, or an advanced terrorist hunt. Maybe even aliens. Because why not.

nah, friend.

Same. Got an easy 4K the first time I played Outback like this since I got two with the traps, killed one coming in through window, and ran out on the last.

Well no because once 2 people kille me round after round so I killed one then left

I love it!

If someone kills a enemy you downed, knowing that the enemy is downed then it's a kill steal for sure. Sometimes people reflex shoot downed enemies, not knowing that they're down. Those are not steals.  Most of the times you can't tell.
---
That being said, I've had teammates who've stolen my interrogations for a cheap kill and I've also had teammates who've marked enemies THEY have downed so I can get an interrogation. AL depends on if they wanna be if it the team or just themselves. 
---
Racist
---
I can't argue with that.
---
I believe it's down to a few pro's that ran it for a little while so it stopped being the black sheep of the sights and people actually starting giving it a shot.
---
Personally I'm split between the reflex for the house obstructing the least and the red dot for the simplicity of putting the dot on a target and being bigger than the holo which is easy to lose track of sometimes for me. 
---
Is this the dude from Shrek? 
---
Maybe it’s a sign...

On the website you can trade in 100 for a coupon code. The code is what I was looking for. It's not huge deal but I figured it was worth a shot at saving $12 on a game.
---
I'm stacked on fuze but don't use him, you lucky pup
---
He’s legit 5’3” (1.62 m) it’s hilarious
---
i know they at UBI dismissed it from the beggining , but that glitch guy on YT never posted any fake stuff untill now and the number of elites in game skyrocketed after the video , how do you explain that?
---
for me UBI just wanted to save face and not admit that was possible while silent patched it as fast as they could avoiding the "what will you do about the people who already did the glitch?" questions.
---
because that... would be a major problem for them , to know who was legit and who was not.
---
Cause they're fucking impatient kids who can't wait another 10 seconds for the round to start.
---
Did u make this
---
Looks like 2 aren't enough either
---
not available on console :*(

Yo how do you get the little tag that says your main?
---
Yes, It's my comic.
---
I know that
---
I just love the ABSOLUTE 0 recoil with the vertical one
---
Well I do not believe OP 
---
What is this thing where many people are fixated to skins and especially to black ice skin?
---
Side bar &gt; user flair
---
So it's not just me
---
I play both so I feel your pain.
---
I use flash hider and angled grip and it is literally 0 recoil. It’s like being on Finka’s boost all the time. The thing is a headshot machine. 
---
I would suggest orienting with the hp of the stairs. If you know where the stairs are and which one leads to which room it gets a lot easier and you can go from there
---
Wheres original?
---
Also on PC, Speedfan is banned according to BattleEye anti-cheat. I loaded up the game for the first time in ages last night and it took me ages to figure out why my game was running so terribly... My cooling fans were practically disabled.
---
Zhoot!
---
Thanks!

r/dontputyourdickinthat

Why is he this tall ?
---
Personally, I think Lion is in a really good spot right now and I think they should just call the rework what it is: a nerf. His ability makes sense in a arcade based shooter like Siege and his lore explains exactly what it does in a coherent way.
---
This might receive some hate, but I really don’t think it’s that hard to stand still for 3 seconds. I don’t even play Lion and I think he’s pretty balanced.
---
dokka&lt;3 
---
Tell me your secrets
---
Zof is hella good
---
Well you never said u were afk
---
ok
---
Well the black ice skin is just good looking and its sort of rare so its a nice collecteable
---
so he uses a different account to play people that are lower ranks? 
---
Their system actually works perfectly for the kind of game this is, since every operator takes time to get used to.  There's always someone new to learn and play as while you're saving up for a new operator.  If you REALLY want an operator and don't want to grind, pay for it.  It's the best of both worlds.  
---
It's best that they cost 25K at launch.  Because everyone fights over the new OPs to begin with, and that's how you get arguments and TKs and what not.  I always like letting that shit die down before playing a new Operator.  
---
If you're solo queueing, even though she got slightly nerfed, Zofia is still pretty good option. But if you were to play with your friends, I would say Dokkaebi. 
---
Sledge has always been the ultimate alpha male
---
A lot has been fixed and added in last few patches. Honestly man you should give it a shot. It’s the least toxic game I’ve played. I’ve never been TKd. It’s really about cooperation and just basic communication as a rifleman or medic until you get comfortable. If you ever wna Squad up message me I’ll send steam name happy to walk ya through the basics 
---
Yeah I solo queue a lot
---
Doki doki when with teams
---
Discount Revolver Ocelot when solo 
---
Did you mean thief?
---
do the original rainbow loading screen, the one that  comes on the disc, it would look sick 
---
Gridlock, Mozzie, Nomad, Zofia, Ela
---
The new system currently appears to have no intention of handling nonlethal intentional friendly damage. It only activates its punishment once a player has tk'ed.
---
oh

Thank you for your service. Stay strong. Never go back.
---
Bruh its quite more simple; cav can shoot someone in the head to injure him/her xD
---
Wat ben je van plan als een clan? Jij bent lvl 80 en je vriend is lvl 30, jullie zijn redelijk nieuwe spelers. 
---
He lagged I saw the red thing in his screen. This happens to me a lot 
---
Did you play during/ right after op health? 
---
A cav headshot is denoted as such in the point values.
---
Ash, Jager, Capitao, Caveira, Vigil
---
hacks?
---
I was shit myself when i walked in on 3 of em haha
---
And this was my plat 2 game lmao
---
Ooof
---
they have headshot bonus tho if a pellet hits head
---
Lol rly? Never realised ty xD
---
What are your graphics settings? I’ve been looking for some I like and yours looks nice.
---
Ik snap wat je bedoeld maar om ranked te spelen is het fijner om een clan te hebben, snap je? En we zijn het ook zat om AFK players in ons team te hebben of teamkillers
---
 Reinstall 
---
I would love to see a toxic doc main run out and just plummet to their doom.
---
No. They know it. It's siege. 
---
Thatcher, Valkyrie, Smoke, Twitch, Doc
---
That what caused the problems 
---
To clarify - with the recent update on PC there were new legendary items added to the alpha packs, mira headgear skin uniform, jackal, charms etc but all the screenshots showcasing them are from PC. Even though console was updated last week I was just wondering if they were also added.
---
Ohh I get it now. I still have no idea though lol
---
&gt;! Poop !&lt;
---
That jaw line tho.
---
Ja, ok. Ik snap het, maar je kunt ook gewoon spelers zoeken om mee te spelen ipv gelijk een clan te maken. 
---
Yuh
---
r/subspeoplealreadyknowexistsoyourejustshootingfishinabarrel
---
Dont know geography my bad.
---
I don't understand why the client doesn't just request updated nearby debris from the server after it gets rubberbanded. Should stop most cases like this .
---
Lol valve improved a lot their game, now the portal gun looks like a shotgun! Graphics are better! They added normal gun-... wait wtf its bugisoft
---
T-T-T-T-T-T- Target! 
---
I thought that was just a rumor.
---
I have it 8600k and it's running at 100%
---
Ja maar wat is het punt dat wij een clan willen maken? Wij vinden het gewoon fijner om een clan te hebben. Wil je ons joinen of niet?
---
No, you get the lord status, like tachanka because now you are completed! 
---
Well 90 works well for me. Never going back. Can’t count how many times I’ve caught someone sneaking around me
---
Same. I've gotten team killed because I "stole" someones kill. But I've never done it on purpose. It's always-- oh there shots fired in X room, I rush into X room, see an enemy on the floor and instantly shoot them. I don't stop and think, "oh, let me see if this guy is down or not". In a game like seige where the TTK for all the guns is under half a second, you simply do not have the luxury to risk that. People need to understand that.
---
If my kill gets taken I always run after the after the killer and knife them in the face a couple of times but I've never TKd someone. 
---
I haven't gotten any of the new ones yet so I'm not sure. People on PC seem to be having the most luck with them based on the posts I've seen. 
---
Do you use high-end settings or mostly on low?
---
Is your name Alex?
---
Check my Twitter....
---
Nee, ik speel geen ps4 en ben niet gold. Succes met mensjes zoeken! 
---
Good point, that is very true. Yeah I can’t see how it would be solved, just an u fortunate part to having bad internet
---
I want to know how u get ur main beside ur username don’t whoooosh me plz
---
Dankjewel, welke rank ben je dan wel?
---
ok thanks
---
Just go to your ps setting and accesibility. 
---
Plat 2/Plat 1. 
---
You can only redeem it once tho
---
*Alpha packs are unrewaeding!*

**Water is wet.**

 I literally bought the best looking skin in game, that is Red Silk. the only reason fraction of playerbase can see it , is because noone thought to buy it when it was a seasonal skin.
---
as much as some practices are bs, lets not put every practice there is into bullshit state, some great skins are buyable and you just missed the opportunity to do it.
---
Actually 17 sec
---
Oke, succes verder
---
Zelfde. xoxo
---
The T-hunt was legendary. Best co op experience I ever had and still holds up to this day.
---
Me as wel. I can keep a secret
---
Sledge, hibbana

Lesion, doc, maestro 
---
Well basically isn't it their job to make the game with as least bugs/crash as possible ? I know the Ubi's bug fest after each update but damn why should the consumer think about the product's stability while in fact it's of Ubi's job who are trying to sell us their product 
---
r/subsyouwishwerereal

brooo
---
Shotgun’s does not have the same one-shot mechanic that other weapons have. It would be too broken if a single pellet hits to the head and kills. 
---
Also headshot with Cav pistol is down, silent step or not.
---
Also also, headshot is not always a one shot one kill.
---
B I G L E A D I N T H E I R H E A D S
---
That kill on Blackbeard looks fishy...just the way you were already shooting at him from behind cover before you even seen him there.. no hate just curious.
---
Gamer girl juice. 
---
Had diarrhea for a good week
---
now that was epic

Hello bcasey2405! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!

Should you still have any unanswered question, [let the moderation team know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRainbow6 "Click here to compose a modmail message") so they can improve the guide for future buyers.
---
Does that look like an actual airport to anyone? 
---
All I’m gonna say is get it, I played cod for like 5 years and then got this game, best FPS i have ever owned and the most satisfying to be good at 
---
Expectation management is another portion of being a savvy consumer
---
tHiS^
---
yeah then you dont kill all 5 and they call you trash. 
---
Nah
---
Zofia said it's my turn on the xbox
---
I haven't touched Siege since the Italians. I fear what I would return to
---
Lättare att läsa än att lyssna på. ;-P

Omg this is so my friend when he started playing on the PC MASTER RACE!! 💪
---
let me guess, above silver. 
---
Why these bitches think that we can come in contact
---
Everytime lol

Someone on the other team crashed the server

Bad bot

Oh, look. An Anthonypit wannabe. Great.

Any people with semi-experience with terror hunt knows these white mask have insane pop-flash skills, they just know when exactly to toss that and blind you.
---
Great job!

Last 2 weren’t as bad tho
