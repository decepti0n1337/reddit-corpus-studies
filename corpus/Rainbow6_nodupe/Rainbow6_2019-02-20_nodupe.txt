I'm seeing ascetics in the art for this season to be very reminiscent of the visual style of the TellTale Games. If Ubi gobbling up those people after that studio crashed is true, then your thoughts on the Operators looking like they are from a different game are pretty valid.

I just saw a video on the changes and seeing the fire rate change to Cav‚Äôs pistol made me crease. And the Glaz rework lol

Its ok. Not a fan of the amount of hard corners and long stretches of hallways though.

wait then why are there aussie ops?

Please

Really depends on which org you're referencing. I know the stat with 300+ a year is pretty loose with it's definition

absolute fatass. hit the gym

So the realistic reason Gridlock's so thick is that she's supposed to be swole as shit like Zarya, but the R6 art team couldn't figure out how to do that without it looking silly, so they just made her broad and hoped it was enough.
---

---
If you want, a possible _canon_ reason could be that she was promoted to Team Rainbow before she gained weight, and Six is pressuring the SASR not to kick her out because she's such a valuable asset. Otherwise, it seems in character for Mozzie to use his obligatory Team Rainbow technomancer bullshit to falsify his best friend's fitness test results and keep her employed.

Cuz ubi likes em thicc and so do i

uh... CSGO anyone?

You mean I or the thing next to your name?
---
Looking at these stats, does anyone else think Maverick might need a nerf? Blitz and Lion are no-brainers for reworks, but I feel like not many people talk about Maverick. 
---
As someone who anchors a lot, I find him annoying to play against and I wish he had some form of counter beyond flanking (such as bandit or kaid) and I wish his gadget would be louder and melt the reinforcement over a period of around 5 seconds with a visual indicator rather than burning through instantly. 
---
However, I‚Äôd like to know what everyone else feels about him to get a general opinion.
---
that's Cav for ya 
---
Nerfing extremely strong operators is only good for the game.
---
The thing next to your name, like how yours says ‚ÄúG2 Esports Fan‚Äù
---
So is Caveira
---
I'm just here to watch the incels moan
---
Tranny's not exactly a cool term my guy
---
If they only exist within the game, then their lore and design would not matter, so anything Ubi does would be fine
---
Don‚Äôt like that everything looks the same also feels huge but it‚Äôs not as bad as tower was atleast

How did this hambeast make it through selection?

Make some. It takes time but its more than worth it in the long run.

---
Yeah I agree with the Ash changes but the Cav one imo was way too overboard, same goes to Glaz. With Glaz I think all they should do is slow the fire rate like it was before they buffed it.
---
The fire rate to her pistol is a big and they‚Äôre working on it. And the change to Glaz was unnecessary. I don‚Äôt main him but I feel the pain of all the Glaz mains. Also, I was just about to get Lion but after seeing the nerf, I might just get Dokkaebi or Jackal.
---
fatass lmao
---
I like it the change. I always thought the animations were hard to watch. Always gave a super douchy "yeah wud up" kind of vibe. 
---
I do think the unique poses for each operator was perfect

Teamwork makes the dream work.

---
Off course. But I mean in 4/5 years, is CSGO still going to be there? I think R6 has a better chance to be the future standard, like CSGO is now.
---
That must be humiliating for the twitch-guy !
---
But....  Mozzie is a defender
---
Curious, what rank are you?
---
So if the wall is electrified by bandit the grzmot won't be destroyed?
---
Nah, the old ones still look the same. The two on the right belong to newer operators- top-right is a throwable shock thing that electrifies walls/hatches, and bottom-right is a trap droid thing that ambushes drones and lets the defenders access them
---
Glaz doesn‚Äôt need to be as strong as he is in love build, it‚Äôs simply OP. 
---
Ash is not OP and her strength and viability isn‚Äôt because of her Acog.
---
The Cav nerf is a bug Ubi have addressed 
---
Agreed. I wouldn‚Äôt get Lion anymore if I were you. Jackal is definitely a better pick now as he actually puts pressure on the enemy, his rework is just like spam spotting on a drone...
---
He and Gibraltar would get along lol
---
Don't quote me on this --
---
No, codes are not separated. If you buy the "Ultimate Edition",  that will come with the base game, all current operators, and VIP access to the Year 4 operators. This means that if you redeem a "Ultimate Edition" code whilst already having the base game installed, will only grant you the above mentioned extras.
---
103kg bitch please I'm 110 make me an operator.

If they can't detect it then does that means they ban people through reporting? I was thinking of getting one for playing around with my friends in custom games and I was wondering if you can get banned for that.
---
Biggest of brains
---
Yep
---
Oh okay. I play on console so Glaz isn‚Äôt as good as it‚Äôs harder to aim but I understand he would be more powerful on PC. I really wish Ubi started balancing things like this separately for console. Ash on console is so easy to use so she‚Äôs easily the most powerful attacker here at the moment.
---
Literary unplayable
---
If people think dying to iq‚Äôs elite skin is humiliating then how would people feel about this?
---
Also, Ubisoft said that they wanted to make tac Hanks a more viable option by giving him some sort of mobility since he is weak when on his lmg but they just contradicted themselves when they make Glaz have to stop moving to see through smoke. üòï
---
Oh go to the main page thing and click the tree dots on the top right, then press change user flair. (If youre on mobile) if youre on PC I can't help you 
---
Because "tall swole mechanic lady" is a common character trope that's easy to communicate visually (so we get an idea of what kinda person Gridlock is just from looking at her), but Ubi couldn't manage to make her look buff
---
Sigh :(

If anything is used from this post i hope its this

As long as you have a good ping you should be able to at least trade with him, if he peeks you and headshots you, you will only die after he peeks in your screen

nope, I made it this way to sort of buff Kaid, since his pick and win rate is too low according to https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-342849-16/y3s42-designers-notes-mid-season

_Preferably_, just weapons to puny damage or those with good damage but very high recoil for the sake of enforcing the idea that every bullet counts.  Weapons that that have the best of both worlds when it comes to damage and recoil should probably not have a sight advantage added on top.
---
In regards to what type of character gets what I'd say that every attacker has access to the choice of an ACOG somewhere, but maybe not on every weapon. The way they are spread out at the moment on defense is fine.

Even in the US most of em are done with regular shotguns and handguns.

I‚Äôd bet safe storage laws (especially in houses with minors) would have a huge impact, without having to resort to more invasive forms of gun control 
---
was more of a discussion than a suggestion, if i had a genuine suggestion i wouldve firstly have titled it ‚Äòsuggestion‚Äô, and secondly i wouldve gone to ubisoft forums or something instead of just posting it to the R6 subreddit because the developers arent going to see just one post and be like ah yes thats a good idea lets change the game

Oh believe me. I'm more aware then most people what the requirements are. I served with men of all different sizes but yeah, none had powerlifter builds. I have known heavier set e8 and e9s. I understand the argument that they aren't staying true to their pretend special ops/counter-terrorism unit.  But at the end of the day it is still a videogame. None of these people jobs and half the equipment don't exist in real life so her weight shouldn't matter.

What I'd want is similar to cross between coastline and villa. Kinda. Two floors but the first floor is below ground. With a large garden/courtyard in the middle of the second floor. Almost all soft walls around the garden. It could be under construction with a hatch in the middle of the garden (Where a fountain would be) not sure the setting but I think it would be very interesting to have a basement on coastline.

That looks terrible.

Learn the maps and call outs using room names and coordinates. 
---
Play as useful operators for the team ie if the team needs a hard breacher than step up and grab one. 
---
Watch pro league occasionally for strategy ideas. 
---
Watch kill cams to see how the opponent fragged you.
---
Practice by playing t hunts or similar before ranked matches.
---
Play ranked with squads, not solo, if possible.
---
Try different sensitivities and controls to fit your needs.
---
Ignore the haters. Good luck! 
---
Yeah but that doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of a new player in the game not knowing any better, or just forgetting that the defenders have a mozzie
---
Man just went from late 20s to mid 40s

ok lol.

It's a spider, what else would it be for an Australian op?

You don't HAVE to be super Uber light to get into the military, you can be slightly overweight as long as you pass all the physical and mental exams, plus the Australian requirements are different from American requirements.

It's more like respecting the choices people make in their life. I don't like a lot of things that others do. For example, alcohol consumption is terrible for the body, but it is an extremely popular beverage (esp. in Europe). Drugs are terrible, swingers are weird, many people dislike what porn is doing to human interaction, being fat is terrible for one's body, list goes on. So many things are bad for health (mental and physical) and yet I don't go around judging others for these things because I respect the autonomy of others. If you have decided to love lolis or are a furry, that is your choice, even though it may corrupt your mind. Smoking and alcohol are two major vices, and both are as terrible for one's body as being overweight. Avoiding shaming others for making choices is just common sense since no one is perfect.

So they patched Caveira head position glitch and then introduced the new head position glitch for all operators? Wtf
---
Because everybody just turns it off because obviously the best way to play the game is from the start, not from round 5. This solution just means every casual game just ends up being 2v5, or 3v4, 1v5, etc.
---
No, what they need to fix is the frequency with which games require a positioned to be backfilled. The solution to backfill hell is punishing players who abandon games. Nobody loses with this solution. 
---
There are also other ways to alleviate backfill hell. Shortening rounds being on of them. Many quit after death just because re queue feels faster than just waiting to respawn.
---
As it stands if you want to fix the disgustingly broken backfill situation with casual you just have to play with a friend. The odds of a match needing more than one slot filled is pretty slim so you basically get to always start from the beginning of a game.
---
I like it also and it's refreshing to be in the circle of knowledge of whats coming up. I just feel like they need to hit the brakes a bit and address some issues that have been plaguing the game for quite some time now. 
---
At this point I guess it's some corporate behind-the-scenes requirement forced upon the devs. Companies want good PR, they make their devs push the limits of acceptability.
---
how is the game broken? they‚Äôve done so much I have an unpopular opinion of thinking the game isnt broken anymore

If you are revived, you shouldn‚Äôt have 50hp. It‚Äôs stupid. People reset each other loads and it‚Äôs already unfair. 20hp is a good thing, it‚Äôll stop the issues with people resetting each other. It‚Äôll also mean taking hits is even more painful knowing you can‚Äôt go back up again.
---
It goes to the side. Not either side, just the right. 
---
They aren't thinking they need to crank out even more content. They're actually decreasing the number of new maps. We're getting only 1 instead of the usual 4.
---
Stop making shit up and getting mad about it.

I would say to get any razor one but I personally have the Logitech g332 they come with a bendable mic and volume adjuster with a mute switch on the wires but the only bad thing is that the cords are really long but it is relatively cheap coming in at 60$ on Amazon and have lasted me forever and I use it personally on ps4 and has saved me a couple of times
---
A lot of guns do that 
---
Just imagine an EMP flies out from backstage. Whole room goes dark. Suddenly sparks as the backdrop begins to burn for a charge. It explodes, revealing Thermite at his drums. He starts to play as Thatcher struts out with his Queen mustache, meanwhile Mav and Hibana repel in from the sky. Charges and flames going off all over.
---
How do you do that?

Zero breachable walls, tons of tight corners, full teams of shields

Yes, the hacker and kicking problem is rampant, but these are some HUGE fixes, and these are just a few of them. And with the community increasing in number every day, I don't see it going down anytime soon. And it isn't even the start of the year yet.

Never said it was broken. There are just multiple dilemmas that have run rampant for quite some time now.

That‚Äôs hard when you are as cocky as ubisoft. But I‚Äôm sure after the Pro league year 4 high spirit people has passed over. They may address some more touchy subjects like hit boxes etc.

Well you're bitching about people bitching about her appearance. Do you care that much about what people thinks about a fictional character? Maybe you have an issue about being fat? Or a loved one? Either way, don't bring those home issues to this reddit buddy ;)

They fixed this issue a year and half ago. Then totally forgot about it lmao.

If you have watched the videos of the toxicity of seige you would know it‚Äôs a real thing and woman genuinely are afraid to talk because of all the assholes out there. I‚Äôve seen this before in other games. People use reason as an excuse to say the kinds of things you see in this post. Honestly people who are defending this are ignoring the fact that it‚Äôs wrong to say this and it is a reflection of the toxicity I have seen in the community for years.

The "lol" ruined it.

It's always amusing to see people say their favorite game is the new big deal and that older games will be dead soon.

Do they not realize how much bias they have with statements like that? Either back it up with evidence from some source or accept that its wild speculation.

Sony Gold wireless is good, but soon you will realize it's not the headphones, your problem will be how sound is done in the game.

You know, the strong people, *actual* strong, aren't often not that buffed. The basic insta models and gym hulks tend to train on stuff that makes them look a certain way. Not saying they aren't strong, but it's the skinnier looking people that can pretty much always outperform them when it comes to competing.

In year 4 they are changing the operator prices so the older the operatir the cheaper they are

Stop fucking lying

After looking on the Ubi store, their figures look different. Am confused now. So they're like releasing different ones through Gamestop now? Or something.
---
Double the voltage (240v), arcs occur when a plug is pulled at more than a 100 watt draw (if device is not turned off). 2400watt max draw for single socket, but I've seen idiots burn out power boards by overloading, and wonder why the fuses keep tripping. Idiots abound, houses burn. I'm ok with the additional safety.
---
Plus switch at point, helps to stop "standby" drain, electricity here is fucking expensive. A few years ago the Gov, were handing out auto off/timer power boards (mainly for TVs etc.), to help reduce power consumption, as well as water saving shower heads and insulation (that one was a fiasco) all for free. Now if they could just give us free solar panels, that would be great.

I wish there was a penalty for doing this, or maybe a change could be you can't leave within 10 seconds of being hit by an enemy.

TBH I do think she's chonk the way she looks in game but I think the glaring issue everyone is overlooking is that she just has a vest on without a trauma plate or any sort of armour.  
---
UMM, WTF? What kind of braveness is this?  
---
Also Ubi should make some changes to her to make her look more muscular because look at her concept art. She looks like she can toss people through drywall or something.

Sadly it‚Äôs not enough. You‚Äôll see this happens a lot so when you have to mute every single guy on your team consistently because of them being assholes it makes the game a lot less fun and puts you at a disadvantage.
---
Reporting doesn‚Äôt do much without evidence. That‚Äôs why there needs to be a way to record a clip in seige and send it with a report. It would go a long way.

About them calling the person fat?  Is that indicative of hating women or people saying a fat operator isn‚Äôt believable

Maybe it's all anecdotal but I saw zero complaints about Kaid on this subreddit. Just posts about how badass/gentlemanly he looked. Maybe some comments about him being old but definitely nothing hateful or complaining.

I still like the original one

she lightly tapped a mailbox, but i knocked her driver side mirror out of place and now no matter how hard she tries she can never get it back to that perfect spot she had before

I'm surprised kaid's Aug doesn't have onr

For me it‚Äôs only like this on my pins, but on My games and apps it‚Äôs normal

looks too soft for a CTU operator

Do their super soakers and nerf guns count as well now? What ridiculousness.

Well it was 1v5 so not much use letting them try it when they‚Äôre already dead

Stop begging. Year 4 pass isn't even expensive.

Almost none of the operators have very good height/weight ratios.  Rook is 5'9" and 158lbs.  Mozzie is 5'4" (which I believe is under the minimum Aus height for enlistment) and 126lbs.  Maverick is 5'11" and 150lbs.  It's not the first time the weight of an op is pretty fucky.
---
An attack: you must be a horny weeabo 16 year old white boy.

A comment: you must be bored to care for the health of a fake character.

It's kinda ironic to assume that a fat woman couldn't assault a house anyways. She's fat, she's not unfit. They're not mutually exclusive.
---
Yup that's Xbox for you. You stand still for a few seconds to drone you get a good ole TK. 
---
[Obese is defined as a BMI of 30 or above](https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/am-i-obese). It doesn't matter if she's muscular or fat; obese is a pure measure of BMI. We have her height, we have her weight, we can tell she's obese. If you think obese is a useless measurement you're free to, but you claimed her not to be obese, and that's factually incorrect.
---
*blackbeard intensifies*

KiX is precious and we must protect him/her at all costs.

Please no

I said bmi alone means nothing

I think you underestimate the power of hacks and not photoshop or video editing. With cheat engine you can change the name of any player to a name of your choosing.

---
At the most it should be a five pointed star or a five mark tally next to your operator icon for the next few matches,when you pick the operator you got an ace with.
---
Since the only purpose to get proof of acing is so you can flex on randos you're matched with.
---
Is it fat it muscle
---
Next season year 1 operators will become 10000 renown its not a lot so just save for it
---
tbh his ability is shit

#LIBTARD OBLITERATED
---
Honestly, I don't like the concept of an Aboriginal dot painting skin, but props to you for putting in the effort.
---
I see. Well, I personally love having a shotgun secondary purely for the utility of it. The secondary was the main reason for initial purchases of Jackal and Mira when I was relatively new to the game.
---
Mozzie 3 speed?
---
Yeah the comments on this post are basically proving the point of the post. 
---
You do realise that you are comparing the best guns on attack with the g36c, but seem to forget that you'll never go up against attackers when you are an attacker, don't you? So your comparison makes no sense.
---
If you want a valid comparison, do it with the defender guns.
---
The g36c has a lower time to kill than ALL defender primaries except the ALDA. Even the r4c can't beat the alda.
---
So yeah, that gun still shreds defenders. Comparing attackers primaries is useless since you don't fight attackers as attackers. You fight defenders as attackers.
---
I agree with both your statements, this was also why I went with these 2 women. Both are "Strongwomen" as in lift very heavy shit, a sport where steroids will only build size and fill the muscles with water at a certain point and they aren't very used, unlike in bodybuilding. 
---
World class bodybuilding isn't really a good margin since that is where steroids are prominent. Bodybuilders don't actually need power, they have more than most for sure, but their goal is still to look pretty for a contest. Steroids are really good at moving water to muscles to make them look more defined. That's the reason why people go of a steroid treatment they look saggy and bloated. 
---
Lol. Same system was when the game was just released.
---
No,  but 2 speed with 3 drones.
---
Why is it ridiculous to suggest a change? Nobody's saying boycott the game or riot if they don't change it. Someone just pointed out an inaccuracy, why does it matter to you?
---
damn, i'm down here in Melbourne looking 8 when i'm bloody 14
---
I dont care if she is a woman, I just dont like she is fat.
---
BuT mY iMeRSiOn
---
Yeah it's pretty decent.
---
Was 19, now 12. Lower, noticeable, but still good.
---
Alibi maybe? 
---
so, it shouldn't be promoted in the media, full stop. 
---
You said that she wasn't obese.  Medically, BMI means obesity- whether you think obesity is a valid statement, given that the Rock is medically obese, is another story.  She's obese, so is Dwayne Johnson.  I personally think based off of a long lifting and martial arts career that she's fat, but I'm not arguing that with you nor am I bringing it into this purely factual discussion nor does it *matter* to her state of obesity.  You used the term obese, a medical term with a particular meaning, without being aware of the meaning.  That's your issue, mate.  Take the L.
---
I hadn't thought of it by I do agree. I started playing around at Skull Rain. The game was more catered to strategy than gun play.
---
I can remember planting bomb with Capitao going on the roof and shoot fire at one of the bomb sites.
---
Now its quick pick here, 360 turn around head shot there. Now don't get me wrong with experience comes skill and you have to use it to your advantage but the game should be more about strategy instead of shoot em up bang bang.
---
The newer Ops I really haven't enjoyed too much from the last few seasons. 
---
What is the significance of "no lag" with Thatcher placing the knife on the shelf?
---
I aced twice with that thing!
---
Well technically one was a 4k + heavy assist but that's besides th point. If you know where a cluster of enemies is, you can prefire the into next week

he's trying to say there's no real reason to picking the G36 loadout VS any of these other guns on attack lol

I would imagine it's not an engine limitation as much as its really easy for them to just have one outlet texture in the gamefiles shared across each map.

Vigil is the more versatile operator, while Cav only works when the enemies make mistakes or you abuse that head perspective glitch.

Come on cut them some slack. Having to bring converters with you to each map so you can charge your drones is a pain in the ass. I‚Äôm willing to suspend my disbelief in this case for the benefit of the operators.
---
You know she still has it on her other weapon right? 
---
I mean... if you're droning out a room, you may don't know where he is, but you still know he's there. And over distance its also useless. They should have made it without the white stripes and noise when on drone
---
In tea room, you can break a box and throw a drone in. The drone goes through a tunnel into the locked room by stairs. It has a Smoke chibi and a Rainbow 6 bookend with a torch shining the silhouette on the wall. There's also other series 1 chibis hidden around the map.

I'll just preface this with the fact that I lean towards more of a "hey anything goes design-wise" mentality to games, even ones such as Siege that try to maintain a semblance of realism but this argument sucks and every derivative version of it will always suck.
---
It's about keeping the universe consistent. If all those things in the upper picture were real, the military would use them. Holograms, super drones, they would probably at least keep war crimes in storage somewhere. But fat soldiers *will never be the ideal* for a special operations unit.
---
it very much is
---
I told you multiple times that it's a medical term.  Furthermore, you don't have a damn clue how OP meant it unless you read his mind.  The medical definition of obese is hardly rare knowledge, and most people hardly need a med book to know it- if you do, then I don't know that you should be speaking on the issue.  Regardless, the number of times I specified that it's a medical term with a real definition tells me that this is all backpedaling for your complete lack of reading comprehension, knowledge, or some combination of the above, because you should've figured that out long before now, smartie.  
---
Depends on what he's using to sense them. Detecting a human at close range though walls doesn't seem too difficult, though a heartbeat sensor specifically I have no idea. They don't really talk about how it works, but it looks to me kinda like radar of some kind.

Well. If you are very very good and know how to abuse her and sneak around drones, yes. Than you are right. But in a normal ranked game you don‚Äôt really see someone watching a flank. Her silent step is the strongest she has bc she can sneak up so ez on ppl not paying attention. But if you are in a 5 stack and can tell someone to watch that one drone or hold a specific angle, Cav comes with a pistol against an assault rifle on midrange.  
---
All you need to know is how to counter them and they will both be only early picks for the attacking team. But vigil has the advantage that (when he times it right) you don‚Äôt know exactly where he is, so it usually takes you 10 seconds longer to drone him out and kill him

As someone who was diagnosed with ADHD over a decade ago and barely treated,not sure I know what works for you.
---
But after I'm done playing for the day sometimes I find myself reviewing the last 1-2 games I played,and reading briefly posts about the ops and maps involved.
---
Then I review specific opportunities relevant to the ops.
---
So "Pulse can play vertically/throw nitro here" or "Blitz is vulnerable when entering here" for example.
---
Visualize if you succeeded or failed in taking those opportunities throughout the last couple matches,and how you could have responded right/better.
---
Then when the situation comes up on even on another map,or maybe you're on the receiving end of that tactic,it can come back to you.
---
"Pulse can watch from here." "I can hit Blitz from here."
---
ADHD makes me think about a lot of things at once,so this method maybe helped me somewhat. See if it helps you.
---
In addition to the usual play Thunt/roam maps in custom stuff 
---
Oh yes.....YESSSSS
---
Honestly winning against the odds feels so much better in this game than almost any other I've played.
---
Wait, you guys have switches on your outlets?
---
Actually making cav uniform seems hard to me cause all other elite skins reference to something historical, but BOPE uniform always was kind of feature of this unit and even with 40 years history it was always black uniform with a special patch. 
---
You can't be racist against white people?
---
Also i think glaz was extremely underpowered. As his gadget this ibtegral part of operaters was a slightly better scope that could only be put a dmr
---
BEST.NERF.EVER
---
i think totally the opposite. i do myself quite well with glaz and well, not being useful to the team his gun is quite good. i personally enjoy playing with him. 
---
It‚Äôs not your birthday is every 4 years cause the 29th only happens every 4. So the joke was 49x4 which is 196
---
Incredibly frustrating, and I'm starting to see it at all levels of play now. I've never caught anyone leaning without ADS before, so clipping and sending to Ubisoft might be a waste of time. Pretty blatant MnK but no evidence as damning as that.
---
It was a showcase in a custom game with the other devs, it was shown at the six invitational.
---
The idea of not being possible to be racist against white people is racist by itself, you racist.
---
Fyi: if you're on xbox you can save your game clip and then once its uploaded, go to xboxdvr.com and you can save it to your desk top, phone etc or link it. You can also use the xbox app and view and save your clips from there and then upload to reddit.
---
This is much much better

I've talked about Thatcher elsewhere, and I did cite Doc as an exception. However, pumping someone full of adrenaline and stimulant drugs would give the *appearance* of being able to take more bullets before going down, but in reality they'd feel it all at once when the drugs wear off, and maybe bleed out before then. Also it's probably too fast acting but I can make that concession.
---
I'm not saying that the OG stuff was 10/10 on realism. I'm saying it was 9/10 and is now 6/10
---
no
---
DRY!!
---
I already get flak for playing this game from my friends. Chunky girl just gave them another reason. feelsbadman clap.
---
His job will be exactly as intended, a sniper overwatch, his job will be to watch angles and bomb plants. He‚Äôs much more situational, yes, but he will be very strong in that role, far batter than any other op at it.
---
I suddenly feel old
---
I blitz love fucking.
---
I (and alot of others) would disagree.
---
ACOG's give you a good advantage over those who don't use them as you can see further easier.

Aced it.

Yep...unplayable

frost with a shotty is deadly

Any reason why, or just saying so youre different

I would be baited to buy those toy soldiers because of the nostalgia of playing Army Men Sarges Heroes so much as a kid.  I‚Äôll admit they‚Äôd get me I wouldn‚Äôt be proud of it nor with it be practical 
---
2/2 is obviously the best and most balanced armor/speed rating in the game. But her gadget is so powerful I understand why she is a 1 speed. Btw the first 1 speed without a shield
---
I now want Nomad face remodel based on this beautiful woman.
---
Literally unplayable. 
---
Why do they keep doing the alibi and maestro thunt one, I don‚Äôt want to play defense thunt
---
This isn‚Äôt new, they said they patched this issue months ago.
---
No objections to pink or obesety comments, but vigil is definitely absurd. 
---
That just isn't true. Join the military or go through a police academy. Before the years of sitting in a police car hit. There are girls smaller than Dokkaebi doing it. I know I work with them. There are some women built smaller than Dokkaebi running 10+ miles a day and doing more pull ups than most of these soft millennial boys on here bitching about "real women." I know women who are hard as fuck and they don't look it at all.
---
Shit just go hit a gym. There are women in there out performing lots of soft dudes. Real women exist and they look a hell of a lot better than half these operators. Valk is the only one with an actual strong body build in some of her art work. The rest of them are average fit chicks. More lean than bulk. The way a chick would look if she did more cardio than lifting.
---
10= neck shot 
---
20= headshot
---
 Was going to downvoted because console but shit was pretty funny
---
Was a Glaz main.
---
Going back to maining him after the nerf, because he's an actual marksman now.
---
Remember, this is just the **first step** in the nerf. There are more changes to come.
---
And if you've seen the ban rates in PL, you'll know he was nowhere near weak.
---
what if she gets nerfed though?
---
The clip I'm referring to was at the invitational, I watched most if not all of it. Granted I could have missed something but I only remember seeing a 30-60 second clip of them showing off the new Lion, and I feel like its hard to decide whether he's going to be good based on only that.
---
Definitely. I think it's just not focused on more because the clothing or body armor adds to the silhouette so they don't look as skinny.
---
Well, the better gadget thing...
---
Outstanding move!!
---
They look fat.
---
There were tons of people bitching about an old man in the game. Which is legit, I think Kaid is a dumb operator and isn't realistic at all. 
---
this whole uproar is kinda pathetic to me.
---
In all games in general. 
---
You just couldn‚Äòt copy the text, could you?
---
Lion and Dok, yes, but litreally just for a few seconds they can counter you. Claymores no, you're stupid if you run into those very obvious claymores - inside the building that is. If you jump out a window into one that's your own fault.
---
Haven't played with Gridlock yet but yeah, I think actually this will be the main counter to cav from now on
---
All I heard was nerf lion
---
Can confirm. I'm new to Siege, just bought it on PS4 through the PSN store. After installing everything, I have all DLC Operators for Year 1, 2 and 3, but none of the Base operators are unlocked. Need to unlock them the old fashioned way with Renown. I don't really mind, you can buy one operator from each CTU (SAS, GIGN etc.) pretty quickly just by watching the tutorial videos and completing some Situation missions, which I was always going to do anyway as a newbie. 
---
I feel The UMP is amazing with red dot perfect for CQC unless you're going up against Hibana
---
Up. 
---
That's some wild art. You deserve more upvotes!
---
I‚Äôve seen you without the helmet on streams before, don‚Äôt worry man you ain‚Äôt bad looking.
---
Im kinda done with casual but start being done with ranked too, i play mostly solo because i have sad life and have no friends expect 1 but he rarely plays, i tried is there any major differents between bomb and secure and ive noticed that bomb is lot better as everybody should already know that. When i played secure, noone of them played objective. In one round, it was 1v2 on our favor, enemy was securing, both of them just stayed off the sight and didnt even try to kill the enemy. I play on ps4 so not so many poeple use mics but when they do, they always speak language that i dont understand. When somebody asks in english english or example italian and i answer english, after that they never speak to me. Also so many people left defuser far away and then at the last seconds they try to rush. 
---
You all are abusing the word thick. She is just fat.
---
You indeed have control over it.
---
You can just stop putting yourself and other people at risk until the way to resolve the issue is found.

My biggest problem comes down to its rate of fire. I can not enjoy it, don‚Äôt ask me why it bothers me.

Obviously, minorities have dealt a way harder hand before racists and I agree that before and even now there is an insurmountable amount of racism in America. But then turning around and saying that you can say whatever you want to a white person because society doesnt really care that much and white people have power and an extreme amount of advantages over minorities undermines the whole point of racism. Speaking of other countries not tolerating hate on whites, South Africa is passing a law in April forcing white farmers to give up their land to black citizens to even the "economic power" between whites and minorities. I understand that what happened in the past can't be changed, but that doesn't give others a reason to now hate on whites, just because whites are expected to just shrug off racial slurs doesnt mean we should just allow it to be, some white people take offense to being called school shooters, some take offense to being named a cracker, that doesnt mean we need to just shut up because we dont understand the historical hatred minorities have dealt with for centuries. Sorry but no.
---
Wait for Rogue-9‚Äôs video. It should be up in 1-2 weeks.

---
Well, there's two people that said that quote (or similarly), Patrick Soderlund (which has a six year old daughter) and the director (which I believe was 4 or 5). 
---
I could be wrong though, but it was an obnoxious argument when discussing an m rated game regardless. It would have been better to exclude the age but that wouldn't have allowed them to exploit their daughters' innocence and make us feel bad. 
---
Wasn't part of bandits background story that he was undercover in a biker gang or some sort of gang? It explains the look and all the flames. The map even more so.
---
Now what if they ended up not adding anymore Americans 
---
most good players can control all of the guns so then damage and firerate matter

BB reeks of it.

It‚Äôs a separate package.

Holy fuck turn tour sensitivity down. You're shaking all over the place (sorry if you're physically handicapped). Also good on you for baiting your teammates. 
---
I bought gold edition so no free 4 me :(
---
Very hard choice seeing as one is a defender and one is an attacker. 
---
But if I had to choose definitely lesion, great gun but his gadget is awesome. The gu mines provide great intel and also slow attackers pushes. 
---
I would definitely choose lesion over ying. 
---
Gridlock is T H I C C.
---
But seriously Mozzie sound so damn great
---

Good point. Man I have probably 3000 hours on the BF franchise between BF2,BC,BF3,Bf4 and BF1 (never played hardline, the future one, or Vietnam) but I won't deny that I get massive schadenfreude seeing BFV fail because of their idiotic decisions.

I'll be happy to pick it up on sale in a year or two, but I've got plenty of shit to play.

And that pisses me off!
---
Gee, I sure hope he doesn‚Äôt die in mission 
---
You really should clarify your post with an explanation as to why you feel that way since not everyone is going to agree with you that it needs to be out of the ranked rotation and debates are seldom if ever won without some sort of explanation or reasoing. I'd argue it's better and far more balanced than any of the maps currently not in the rotation.
---
i mean i prefer the old one if her face was changed, she looks less like a depressed teen xD
---
No. He has to buy a package of 12 months and the game that comes with it. Anything bought before doesn‚Äôt count. 
---
i knew that Gridlock wasnt fat she was just pregnant

I work in a creative industry just slightly different from video games. I've worked on massive projects, I've worked on tiny projects.. After a while, how big the project or the audience will be, just isn't that important. Realistically, in any sort of creative field, you will grow tired of doing the same thing over and over again, no matter how much you love it.

There's also career development - if you do well in a role like this for 3 years, it's probably time for a little bump in responsibility :)

Vigil is my main, i love his weapons and his ability combined with bombs and his speed is great overall for flanks and spawn kills
---
Look, I won't disagree with you that with the right team, she'll be a nightmare, it's the same thing with Clash for defending, or Maverick for Attack, except, well, her Gadget's a whole lot easier to use, but to be fair, if you ran something like 2 Barbed Wire and 3 Nitro cells on Defense, and set them up in sneaky areas, then you'd get the drop on her + any unfortunate team mates with her
---
I bought some last year on gamescom at the Ubi Store
---
amen
---
I dunno man. She‚Äôs a 1 speed, with ok weapons. Her gadget should be strong because of this. 
---
People underestimate how slow and clunky you are at that speed rating. 3 suits what she is. 
---
If they do nerf her, it should be a 20 second copldown between use of another of her gadgets. That way, she cannot spam these out in a post plant example. This is a fair nerf but the only one she would need

yea i dont think that's possible and would also give you an advantage so its kinda cheating lol
---

This is textbook-level of trolling. Holy shit.
---
You can't stop kool aid man
---
So same question, why do you need to know which gun anyone is holding ?
---
If it's an enemy, just stay out of sight.
---
The icon thing is just when someone on your team, not necessary you, spot them. That doesn't mean you will know who's who in the middle of a fight.
---
And do I really need to explain how facing a different operator can (or should) totally change the way you play ?
---
Would you rush Caveira alone ? Would you walk on a smoke if Glaz is on the other side ? Would you rather engage Blitz at a distance or at close range ?
---
I have, by far, the best K/D and W/L with BB. The same goes for most of my friends. He might not be broken, but definitely is way too strong.
---
In addition to that, I really don't like his mechanics and think he can both be quite frustrating to play as well as to play against.
---
So yes, I do think they should completely rework how his gadet works.
---
TIME TO GET CEREAL!!!!!!

As opposed to his time to get serious line

I used to be on D R U G S

Yeah, multi is some sort of simulation, while t hunt is real life

I think it's alright. A weeb friend of mine said she looked like his favorite character, Kaga from Kancolle, so he's going to instantly buy it.

Gridlock is not thicc. She's fat!

Then the Japanese news youtuber is a real leaker and he's good with it, he leaks elites all the time except for some reason he couldn't leak Hibana's for some reason.

What makes them a fucking pain in the ass to use is the fact that they move faster than Holo in regards to the FOV change.

Wow I can feel your hatred and ignorance bleed through this comment!!!
---
I love my game and community toxicity but this has no place in rainbow community keep your ignorant and basic thoughts to yourself.
---
The one thing I always always alwaaays tell people when I see this post is this game has a huuuuge learning curve compared to most games.
---
If you can look past getting your ass handed to you for a little while (might not happen but more than likely will) and strive to improve then you will get lots of enjoyment out this game once you start coming to terms with it.
---
Salt
---
I know she's a counter to Roamers, but it's too much. No idea why so many people can't understand that 57 is too many.
---
This is just sad 
---
And it's less reliable than a pinto with a leaky gas tank. At this rate, we get a gyrojet next year.
---
what if it was a beggars outfit? yah know. ratty clothes. hood. make her gun look even more hand made? because in her backstory. she was poor. when she was younger 
---
Understandable salt though.

Mnk is the console equivalent to aimbot on PC. It's bullshit.

Pregnant operator confirmed?
---
Her [concept art](https://static19.ubisoft.com/resource/en-gb/game/rainbow6/siege-v3/r6-operator-gridlock_conceptart8.jpg) clearly shows her as being bulked up (ie a [powerlifter's](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/tatiana-kashirina-of-russia-competes-in-the-womens-75kg-weight-class-picture-id499078496?s=612x612) [physique](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/kuk-hyang-kim-of-north-korea-reacts-during-the-weightlifting-womens-picture-id589518618)).
---
Why are people throwing such a shitfit about this?
---
Well for one irl special forces operators Come in all shapes and sizes. I serve in the danish millitary, and whenever we meet huntsmen or frogmen (danish special forces units) on ecxersises we always get baffled by how varied they are, sure. There is an abundance of guys like Bear Grylls, but also a couple of massive beasts and a few you think will fall over if the wind gets too strong. 
---
Will counts for alot more than build does when talking spec-ops. 
---
Another point is that she might just fokus her physical training alot around the weightlifting as many grunts do. Top fit doesnt mean brolifting ripped or skinny as fuck.
---
 If we go by realistic body margins realisticly hibana and frost, are both low on the bmi normal range. And as muscles weigh more than fat they are either skinny ripped as fuck or normal women with No place in a special forces unit. They simple cannot have the muscle mass and still have their feminine curves in that bmi spektrum.
---
I do think that ubisofts reasoning for putting Gridlock in the game is... Qurstionable at times especially since shes not that tall. But in my understanding of the character shes a play on the old aussie farm girl joke/trope. 
---
fantastic cosplay, this is the best i ever seen!
---
Yea but r6 is about strategy, you can kill most players as long as long as you have a plan and good reflexes

Ela and Jager have sheilds and aren't forced to be anchors. I'm just saying that with the shorty he doesn't need the impacts for making rotation holes.
---
&gt; Well when she exceeds the regulations set by an organization it's a little more than "diversity".
---
Time to ban smoke for violating the Geneva Convention's rules on chemical warfare, then.
---
It takes tine for them to deploy, it requires them not to be destroyed as soon as you set them down, aure up the deploy time since it seems nuts but tbh shes not gonna be too hard to get used to 
---
Yeah but they are good for rotation.
---
Get_Flanked has made some great vids for new players

Yeah but they are good for rotation

pls! ;_;

There's something called DVR on Xbox and SharePlay on PS4? duuh? it's not that hard to upload something on the internet without phone recording ;) 
---
Close to mid range
---
In what way is a sheild a counter to her gadget? Makes absolutely no sense at all. 
---
What i, for some reason, keep having to say is 57 is TOO MANY. 
---
Shotguns are purly utility really, look at Mira. You almost never see someone seriously play with the shotty primary, cause she has one as secondary. And with Mozzie having one as a secondary, it'd be kinda pointless.
---
Kaid and Vigil kinda doesn't have shottys either (not conventional ones anyway)

i dont care about your opinion. as for my thoughts, i am certain many people have similar thoughts, regardless of how many there are in this forum. most people that play this game are not on reddit.
---
The reigning World Champions, G2. Win most of their rounds by outfragging their opponents.
---
The team is also built up by 4 former Entry Fraggers, and a very fucking smart IGL. 
---
The best team in the world is literally constructed to shoot people better than everyone else... Because this game at the end of the day is an FPS game. If you shoot better than everyone else, you win. Especially in ranked.

If a MNK user loses a gunfight to a controller user, the MNK user is just straight up fucking trash. Cause they have absurdly massive advantages.

Yeah, but as I said, what he did isn't exclusive to console players. I've seen plenty of PC players do the same.
---
They are cute
---
what, do you own the game on steam and tried to link to another uplay account?
---
Looks like Apex lol
---
Its great but i think prefer the helmet, the current one when i see the icon i know which operator it is.
---
Operator icons dont always have to be thr ability
---
If an op can "withstand", then I could see a future op having this ability. Not that I necessarily like the idea.
---
Liberally unplayable
---
Glaz is far too OP right now, he is supposed to be a sniper who holds an angle and kills you if you peek him. Right now he is like the CoD 360 no scope headshot kind of sniper.

Imagine if this game had pick and bans holy shit
---
Overall but for me I'm not s big fan of Glaz rework
---
There for sure will fix this soon
---
He's my 2nd most used defender with one of my higher win ratios, damn proud of that.
---
From?
---
And Smoke, before the impacts
---
thank you!
---
Are you so self centered that you haven‚Äôt even considered the possibility that there is no fix, and they‚Äôre located somewhere with naturally shitty wifi like Australia? do they just not play 50% of the game they bought then?
---
The grass is never greener on the other side.

As far as I'm aware, there is one example of a game dev being able to stop Xims. And that's Fortnite.
---
They managed to differentiate the movement input from a keyboard being only 4 directions and a control with full 360 rotation... Xims then released an update that made Fortnite's fix obsolete within days... And it hasn't been countered since AFAIK.
---
Cav but better
---
Honestly really hope they pay you and use this one.
---
How does she counter him? If the spider thing is on the inside wall of a door frame, a twitch drone can't see it, and that door basically can not be used. 
---
I never said that it was ubisoft‚Äôs fault. And there is a lot of great community and there is a lot of absolute trash community. 
---
CAN WE GET A "F" FOR CAV?
---
hey dont i know you guys
---
That would be so cool
---
you walk up to an operator:

---
You‚Äôre just a teeny bit of a cunt, just sayin
---
Well I certainly didnt lol, do you know if you have to play the game on the account that bought the game?
---
And thats a lot of fun! By over sexualize I mean the people that asked me last night when I was playing IQ if I would have a threesome with them and IQ and then talked about drinking her piss for about 20 minutes. 
---
She's not "chubby" she's obese by every medical definition.
---
No fun allowed.
---
So how many times did you seach on Google for "another word for ...". Because it does not make you look smart just pretentious and insecure

The world of technology consistently impresses me day after day.
---
I dont see owen willson?
---
na. 
---
This proves that Tachanka is actually not underpowered and is in a good spot as it is not in the bottom 3 defenders, amirite?
---
Twitch doesn‚Äôt need a buff 
---
But you can't, you never stuck your dick in anything
---
I think we should see this in action before actually start a petition to revert it. I would say, this might make the game more "tactical" in a sense. Right now there is too much rushing, run&amp;gun going on, which is an observation shared by many in this subbredit too. 
---
I think, now you really have to be careful, drone the shit out of the enemy because the second chance you get will be fragile. However, I do agree with the toxicity aspect of this, some troll downs you and you only get 20 HP back, this is a legit problem.
---
Solid win
---
They have the higher ground... 
---
Reminds me on the bo2 bots

what rank are you Jesus ima assume diamond bc im a diamond and i dont even have that much total time on the game 
---
Can you sell Titanfall 2 skins?

It uses oxyacetylene, which can be used to cut through metal or weld it together. It's called oxy-fuel cutting.

"Same shit different day".
---
Literally, everything I got hyped for at the Invitational doesn't happen until later in Y4 despite them having working versions of it. Like ESL ranked settings, pick and ban, Lion rework, Glaz rework etc.
---
I'm only interested in the lean spam fix, new map and Mozzie... It's just a case of "same shit different day".
---
Prove it :\^)
---
The Division skin for UMP requires you to play the tutorial and then get to Manhattan. Once you are in Manhattan, the skin should be unlocked for you.
---
i meant guys with like 0.4 kd use Maverick religiously and started getting good games for the first time.
---
does he also have a gps on his shoulder showing him in the wrong location?
---
Will have to wait and see mate. 
---
You terrorist
---
I'm not sure I follow. There are 7 Americans, therefore the max number of differing states they could represent is 7. According to your map, 6 states are represented? So there's only one duplicate. So isn't that actually pretty good representation then?
---
DO NOT go with any of the ‚ÄúGaming‚Äù or Larger brand headphone ‚Äîthey‚Äôre all shitty rebrands of the same crappy drivers with RGB leds on them. Check out r/headphones . The only good gaming headphones are the cloud IIs from kingston, as they are rebranded Takstar 80 (proper studio headphones) with kingston stuff.
---
I know, but it's not often used. 
---
This is the confirmation that we have all been waiting for
---
Under that sense Mouse and Keyboard adapters are (and if not should be) illegal, especially since they are circumventing attempts by game manufacturers to disable them.
---
Done br√∂th√´r
---
No I mean her interrogation 
---
It has a really "get off my stage mofo" feel
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go that far. Let‚Äôs wait and see. Currently on the Ts, shields are worse than they have ever been, with many killcams showing my shield flipping around like a tambourine and offering zero protection. I‚Äôve gotten reports from the enemy team that as Montagne, my shield was not extended when it in fact was.
---
The -37 karma comment you responded under, less so.
---
I recommend Echo, a drone on defense is very strong and he has an ACOG available.
---
Dang ok. Well if that changes, please let me know.
---
Hibana once you get past the low mag capacity and the recoil of the Bering 9 (or just use the pistol) she is a great hard breacher.
---
Hey u/SGTsmith86 
---
Thank you for linking to the interview I really appreciate that :)
---
I felt it raised an important point re: what we understood to be a rework and a map buff.  I feel they are moving away from the idea of completely starting afresh with map reworks.
---
In a way I understand this - we see how many people miss the old Hereford and wanted it to get the 'Club House treatment' instead.
---
I expect we may go into more depth on this topic on the podcast at some stage.
---
Thanks again for linking the interview.  
---
no, seems my english didn't collect my opinion
---
I sort by controversial. Any more questions, Officer?
---
No it came out fine
---
Fixed it. Remove your comment
---
This sub is seriously such a joke sometimes, people complained about the Hibana render all of the time and then when they finally change it to make it look human people say they like the old one. How do you like this better?
---
[Comparison](https://imgur.com/CYUsItb)
---
[This looks like a guy](https://imgur.com/MjTrYSr)
---
I'm pretty much convinced half of the people saying they like the old render are just a bunch of trolls. I can see why the in-game model is worse but that's all you could argue for. 
---
Gridlock looking fatter then usual 
---
Also he is immune to Dokkabei‚Äôs logic bomb
---
$20 edition which doesn't result in the stupidly long grind *now works like when the game first came out* is now the lowest edition which overall is better for the game.
---
Doesn't exist anymore.
---
Next year no acog for ash :(
---
The icons being related to the character and not the ability was how it used to be in the beginning. You can see it in the [original Icons](https://i.imgur.com/W6m28Gk.png), ie. Rook being a literal (Chess) Rook and Blitz having Medusa.
---
Get good /s
---
What they need to do now is guarantee melee prioritization for shields to prevent melee trades and fix shield toughness issues where for brief seconds during character movements, vaults and certain animations a desync will occur in which bullets and melees go clean though shields.
---
They also must fix directional vaulting animations with all characters, as those issues by far and away affect shields the most. When vaulting through a window as a shield, it animates your character looking straight ahead even if you look left or right, resulting in zero protection from the sides while vaulting even if you are in fact looking left or right.
---
The Harvest begins.
---
no, seems my english didn't collect my opinion. im just saying about fact cause this is feedback
---
I‚Äôve heard of the M249 SAW since I was like 8 yet never knew what ‚ÄòSAW‚Äô meant. TIL
---
I mean, it's like adding a BR mode to cs:go. It wouldn't work and nobody would play it. 
---
Is a higher POV better? And why?
---
At least make another ranked mode
---
I got a 4K right after unlocking nomad
---
Niggas
---
Then just... dont use her? 
---
You can put a maestro cam on the wood post
---
You just missed. Would‚Äôve been nice but alas 
---
Don't do it Anakin 
---
Her gun is considerably worse though 
---
I would say frost she has no recoil and a gadget that is pretty simple
---
This is pretty bad especially considering Lesion, Clash, Maestro and which ever other chip damage dealing defenders will be introduced in the future.
---
mulan??? thats china wtf... 
---
You must hate this "Friend" to buy them the Starter Edition. It's gone now.
---
Well I want to use her, but I'd like them to think about her current design. Allow a vertical grip to be attached, give us a gadget outside of claymores, and add a standard firearm option.
---
Australian Spiderman has been picking up techniques from Italian Spiderman.

WHAT THERES A TERMINATOR 2 GAME?
---
Wow that's actually a really cool way of thinking about it
---
Does it deal 5 dmg while shooting it? 
---
NO ~~RUNNING~~ RIDING IN THE HALLS!
---
That's the old Hereford
---
I would Recommend Valkyrie And smile both of them if used correctly are very strong.. just look up a few cam spots or make up your own. Good luck 
---
NOBODY (and I can not stress this enough) WANTS THAT
---
i am in hereford before rework . playing with hostage a game called ***Catch the explosive puck***
---
&gt; aren't not interested in lore
---
I disagree, I think most people don't care about the lore.
---
That'd be plagiarising. Not cool. 
---
But at the same time, they‚Äôve made several female operators who aren‚Äôt supermodels or anything, but also look like normal human beings
---
I would like to see that quote where they're saying that you have to be in bronze. I'm no where near bronze and I don't find him op
---
I can hear the incredibles theme playing in my head 
---
Or instead of being toxic back, report him.
---
It should be z if not check settings to make sure it isn't disabled 
---
I know but outside is chanced ? 
---
I think they made her look too Happy or not Ominous. Her old pic is super intimidating after going back and forth. 
---
gonna send you one piece when we cut the cake^^
---
I mean its 8th most played game on steam so... 
---
Yeah, I know. I mean, for me that isn't a English speaker it's a useful feature that would help me a lot playing in latam servers
---
Thank you !
---
You ever looked at Spetsnaz operators? Their equipment is outdated by 20-30 years.
---
Fuze is the closest one so far, that‚Äôs how Spetsnaz looked in 200X‚Äôs, but Alpha would‚Äôve never recruited an Uzbeki guy
---
I play 100 horizontal, 80 Vertilcal, 45 ads. Super high for most. 
---
Might be good idea if he could drop ammo like rook does with his plates. Cause otherwise one mag of hollow points seems underwhelming. I mean we got a dude with one eye and a crossbow that shoots fire... 
---
words you can hear
---
Definitely better than a motocross helmet that has nothing to do with anything. Good job!
---
You forgot /s
---
It used to be 3^rd or 4^th. That‚Äôs what I meant by ‚Äúnot alive as it used to be‚Äù.
---
Agreed, I want a mode where I can test out ops without having to defend a hostage or something
---
I am not saying it because of the eyes you racist, i am saying it because they did a bad job at the face change and there is a resemblance. 
---
House is like the second Hereford base (the old one), it's unbalanced, too small, unfair and we all love/hate it.

I wasnt expecting one but thanks for the confirmation

It changed for twitch too

Just wait a bit, it'll install
---
anyone selling any codes for the charm or both 
---
Recruits?
---
Technical limitations. Most consoles won‚Äôt handle it.
---
I call people by their codename unless I'm just feeling memey, the it'll be something like this.
---
Tachanka = Lord/ chankykang
---
Thatcher = Thatch
---
Mozzie = Mozz
---
Gridlock = Grid
---
Glaz = Glaze
---
Fuze = Fuzz

Smoke = Smonk

Bandit = Drugs

Rook = THICC BOI

Dokkabie = Dokk

Maverick = Mav

Valkyrie = Valk

Echo = Drunk Drone

Hibana = Hib/ Fidget Spinners

Capital = Cap

Zofia = Zoe
---
Kaid = Cayed (RIP 6)
---
That's all I can remember, most are just shorting the name. 
---
Whoever wanted this should just quit the game
---
I agree that she looks too happy, and the old, intimidating pic was much better.   
---
The ingame model also looked much better. 
---
nah fam you can tell the difference between big boned, fat, and buff. She's just straight up fat and I also get that people want to be represented but my whole thing is this I have no problem with people being straight, gay, trans, whatever the fuck you wanna do. Although the problem comes when we encourage obesity and try to accept obesity as normal. While yes there are some people who literally cannot lose weight (clinicly) those people are still extremely unhealthy and at risk of heart failure than the average person. When you do things like this (putting fat people where they literally wouldn't prosper) you send the message that it's okay to be fat (which it isn't) if you want to be fat I'm cool with that you do you but I'm not gonna suspend my disbelief that you could outrun, jump, or even fight someone who is actually fit and trained to do these things. Gridlock would be the first to get knocked off in any tactical firefight scenario because of her weight and I believe that is my main problem with this design...They should've just made her buff tbh.
---
If you want to play at 30 fps with 90 Fov. Sure
---
Nope, good to know, I am on PS4 pacific time so things happen different for me
---
Each pest gadget can steal one drone. I think Mozzie gets 3 of them.
---
That‚Äôs... kinda worthless. 
---
I'm 100% behind this change, with one exception:  
---
Maestro  
---
Clash  
---
Kaid  
---
Lesion  
---
Solid Frost buff though
---
9/10 good job 
---
Who the fuck cares about your questions everyone is sick of the same questions.
---
Guy is (almost) correct, it‚Äôs [Short Round](https://indianajones.fandom.com/wiki/Short_Round).
---
As if an *Alibi main* would know anything about ACOG.
---
I like that change tho
---
I can remember it being like this since 2015 december. 
---
Big surprise coming tomorrow ;)
---
According to people playing on the TTS, she's very easy to spawn kill lol
---
But all versions come with the year one ops
---
Thanks mate
---
2 thicc for u

Hello D0mmR6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/asp3uu/codes/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Does fuze count!?
---
I thought they did that just to give them a "Russian" feel. If they were going for accuracy they wouldn't look all that different from the Navy Seals.
---
Gud I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre likely working on them
---
I already had that problem with burnt horizon ops lol
---
Yessir
---
That‚Äôs exactly what someone who was adding a battle royale game mode would say
---
Wondering too
---
The new Trials game looks great
---
In game model doesnt matter. I'll still shoot her in the face with Doc either way. 
---
A bored gamer. :)
---
Yeah, I am going to chalk it up to it being right after the invitational, but I thought this was extremely low effort. Like they didn't even think about it. "Just throw some out there that we do ALL the time."
---
That‚Äôs just a proof that operator design in this game should never be taken seriously.
---
Yes sir I do
---
I like the remodel to be honest I don‚Äôt know why everyone hates it 
---
Wow, I love when Call of Duty implements pointless new movement gimmicks!
---
yh i started in mid 2017 and it wuz like that but they changed it so idk
---
I always recommend a higher horizontal than vertical sensitivity. It reduces the horizontal recoil and that's what you really want.
---
btw are we talking about an PlayStation or Xbox Controller?
---
The skin and charm are until march 6th
---
It just reduces hip fire spread. In turn it also _ever so very slightly_ reduces the time it takes for your aim to reach pin point when you ADS because the spread is starting closer to center. 
---
Whyd they change it back?
---
did you not read the disclaimer. If you are angry that's your problem you can just go fuck off for all I care.
---
They are aligned with defence and attack it‚Äôs ubi‚Äôs fault blame them ;)
---
But you're trying to claim that muscles throw off bmi. The only way this is true is if you have a low body fat percent with a high muscle mass. For her to not be obese, she has to be built like Arnold at that weight. The existence of heavy powerlifters does not negate this, as they often have high body fat because they're going for strength. A powerlifter would never be able to pass military standards of running and endurance without severely cutting their weight. My gripe with all this is that it's literally just the numbers are all wrong. The model isn't even that bad. She weighs more than the woman's hammer throw champion, a specialized athlete that trains for a specific event, and they're trying to say she's a special forces operative. Just fix the numbers to be more realistic
---
That's not your fault , the description of it is pretty Bad. But yes, you were wrong
---
Good. I would probably cry if they changed House. It's THE classic map imho. 
---
that changed recently apparently, if you buy the standard edition you have to unlock the year 1 ops one by one, starts at 500, then 1000 for each CTU
---
Yeah I forgot to make the SAS the purple terracotta before posting :(
---
R6 SJW.
---
Is it just me or are Mozzie‚Äôs pests really fucking cute?
---
That's cancer
---
I may not know all the internal reasons, but it is a needed compromise to drop the game price and get rid of Starter Edition. 
---
And as typical for Rainbow, blitz rush train. Choo choo
---
Guys he's 196 years old because he's birthday is February 29 
---
If you don't know February only have 29 days  every 4 years
---
For example : In 2016 February had 29 days , and this will repeat at 2020 
---
He's birthday is on every 4 years
---
....i do. there‚Äôs a difference between complaining about a bug and reposting the same joke over and over again (-ash and this) 
---
Ya dun goofed 
---
That would be a good idea if the hollow-points rounds didn‚Äôt have any downsides to them. There would have to be a way for the other attackers who take the hollow-points to switch between normal and HP ammunition too, or else they‚Äôd be stuck with a very situation weapon.
---
It might also be difficult to work with shotguns and Glaz.
---
Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs going to be a ‚Äúbig‚Äù surprise 
---
Then it‚Äôs not a pp reveal
---
Except sony and Microsoft let every developer choose of they want support m&amp;kB.
---
They even get a tool to detect xim useres. But the only dev who uses that is epic. Xim in Fortnite will get you on the pc server.
---
Thanks for sharing! and honestly this is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping they would do, for those of us just getting into it, were so far behind without spending real money for operators
---
Understandable. Not trying to say you‚Äôre wrong, just adding to your point.
---
We‚Äôre on the same side here, Beav.
---
Haha you know it... i really need to get out more :(
---
imagine if there were a br mode in r6 
---
that would be shit
---
but if u slow peek then it may reveal your posi b/c of teh red dot on the wall
---
That‚Äôs coming in the near future
---
Ask any Pro Player, anyone with a good knowledge over the game. They will tell you this game is dying with this rate.
---
I in fact asked Willkey (IGL of mousesports) about the map question and he gave the exact same answer. There is no point in pick&amp;ban when the map pool makes the game generally unbalanced and uncompetitive. 
---
Large portion of high tier players don't even play the game outside pro competition anymore as it's just that unenjoyable. This means less streaming which means less new players.
---
And to continue, your argument about people "liking Theme Park and Chalet" is absolutely ridiculous. An unbalanced map being liked by some people does NOT make it good for competitive playlist aka. ranked. Ranked is supposed to be a competitive and balanced gamemode which it will literally never be with the current map pool. 
---
Nope. Like Ubi said years ago they tried to add an FOV option but but the performance got very, very bad.
---
And I'd rather stick to a lower FOV than having to play with 10fps
---
Hollow points in warzone = war crime by the way
---
I've suspended my disbelief ever since the game came out when I saw pulse, ash, etc. without any protective head gear and Vigil wearing a balistic mask in a firefight for some weird reason, BUT even thought they were ridiculous they still could've happened if it just means someone's weird preference because they are cosmetics (clothes, masks, helmets, etc.) this chick is just straight up unfit and fat. COME ONE MAN WE GOTTA DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE.
---
I can understand wanting her to be buff and such, but I think the point of her is to represent certain gamers. I don't see it as "encouraging" obesity. And I mean there's already a lot of dumb shit in this game that can require the suspension of disbelief because at the end of the day, it's a video game. And maybe she won't be the first in a scenario to be picked off because maybe she isn't healthy, maybe not strong and what not but R6 op's are hired for their skills, and gadgets, and she has a pretty cool gadget. Maybe she can aim better than another OP (lore wise). Idk. I think its okay(at this point in the game's life) to just not care about certain aspects of this game, lore or gameplay, because it is fun, and she adds something new and cool for the game. 
---
Good news, I'm glad development time won't be wasted on this. I don't understand the hype for Battle Royale games, I've tried loads of different ones and I've come to realise it's not for me. 
---
my bad mate. the reposts just get real annoying. this is commented about 578853113 times per day 
---

---
Trust nobody,not even your gadget.
---
Well that's a bad mvp animation . Uniform rocks though
---
Agreed fellow Finka Main.
---
Nah she's actually 30 over the BMI
---
Yh, and Overwatch is starting to die if what I've been hearing is true.
---
I love these new changes, emphasizes doc more, eliminates the Gamey nature of resetting 
---
Appreciate that 
---
It also makes it easier being an island instead of being connected to a country that has cartels bringing in guns and drugs. Majority of gun crimes in the US are illegally obtained guns. 
---
You can link the video and put it on youtube
---
Great! I‚Äôm so sick of BR honestly
---
Different clip
---
I withdraw my statement, what was I thinking 
---
Oh. For me personally, I‚Äôm used to it being higher. It‚Äôs a little hard to explain but basically since it‚Äôs high and I‚Äôm used to it, it‚Äôs more accurate 
---
yup just like how pubg would kill FN and hey look at the state of that game
---
Grow up. Europeans are also loud and obnoxious and refuse to speak english.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs why the defense operators are operators and not terrorists. The game takes place in augmented reality, which is why some unrealistic things (like Jaeger‚Äôs skull helmet) exists.
---
Wtf
---
And the SASR accept 33. She is 32.5 or something...
---
Not sure if you know how numbers work but 33 is larger than 32.5.
---
Anyways, back to your insecurity. Was it the result of childhood trauma? Were you underfed when you were younger? Any particular incident that cause this insecurity?
---
I would like a realistic BR with Rainbow-esque graphics, but Siege needs to remain in it's own realm. that's part of why I love it, havent really played anything like it.
---
That's not very cash money of you. 
---
Unless Australian spec ops are impotent in battle or don‚Äôt retest after boot camp you can‚Äôt have effective soldiers looking like that.  It makes no sense carrying around large amounts of body fat when stamina is one of he main things the unit is looking for.  She would get winded very quickly, power lifter or not
---
Don't really mind, House and Plane are so screwed balance wise that there's no point trying to rework them. It would just be a new map with the same name.
---
F
---
If you want to control bearing 9 recoil equip iron sights, thank me later.
---
It more like you are an isolated island where as the US is connected to a country that has the cartel bringing in illegal guns. Most of the shootings here are done with illegally obtained firearms  
---
Maybe Ubisoft should take out their notepad. I'd be pretty beneficial, but you know it's Ubisoft. When was the last time they actually gave a shit about balancing. Like for fuck sake Ubi you have test servers for this shit.
---
How high are you? 
---
Not high
---
Got pubg - player 1 hour - got refund
---
It brings me a smile that rook is the least banned operator.
---
Thank fuck!
---
i loved Overwatch so much for 2 years and just salty the direction the game has taken with such low skill characters introduced and spam meta, and I maintained ~3800 SR as a Main Tank and primary shotcaller, I understand the state of the game pretty well.
---
so it's halfway dead 
---
Man I'm not sure what rustled your Jimmies or where you got your incorrect information but you're just objectively wrong she's quite literally scientifically obese.

I've considered playing shooters on consoles before because they are more casual and there aren't any hacks and then I realize if I did I'd just end up playing against MnK players. I'd rather play against hackers on PC over shitty people who think they're good on console giving themselves an unfair advantage. Of course you could argue why don't I just use a MnK but I wouldn't want to because I wouldn't want to just shit on controller players. 
---
Yes it is!

The closest servers to those countries are in west europe currently. There were plans a year ago to introduce new data centers across the Middle east and Africa but Azure have yet to deploy them. 
---
Clearly making a joke. I'm English and I'd say the English are loud, obnoxious and can't fucking speak the language.
---
Yea I mean for the most part they‚Äôve done better than most Devs. I really hate how their go to balancing method is just to remove scopes like actually fucking change the operator or the weapon not just the scope
---
**Open bolt**
---
A fully automatic firearm is said to fire from an open bolt if, when ready to fire, the bolt and working parts are held to the rear of the receiver, with no round in the chamber. When the trigger is actuated, the bolt travels forward, feeds a cartridge from the magazine or belt into the chamber, and fires that cartridge in the same movement. Like any other self-loading design, the action is cycled by the gas expended from the round, hence the necessity of a gas system; this excess of gas sends the bolt back to the rear, ejecting the empty cartridge case and preparing for the next shot (or continuing forward again, if the trigger is held down in turn keeping the catch depressed and the weapon is an automatic). Generally, an open-bolt firing cycle is used for fully automatic weapons and not for semi-automatic weapons (except some semi-automatic conversions of automatic designs).

Neither am i a native english speaker nor did i learn it at school, i make mistakes ofc, but this one is really annoying. Also alot of ppk do it on purpose and you dont have to be all preachy abt it i had no malicious intend.
---
Thats insane
---
CSS better tho
---
Its not a paid game mode, and they made the entire game *free* after the launch of BR
---
You're entire opinion is full of holes 
---
You represent all Europeans?

To be honest it would be kind of cool

What barrel attachment? Muzzle brake?

On Cav‚Äôs Luison I run a laser but not on any other gun.

If you do have a laser equipped make sure you‚Äôre not pointing it at a place you want to look at if that makes sense.
---
I creep around pointing at walls until I actually want to peek around the corner.

Yeah, muh rights, haha everyone here is proclaiming their rights how stupid are they right every1?

its also on villa

Thank God. That would ruin the game
---
Yes, Ubisoft! Thanks.

Happy birthday homie! You two did amazing on that cake!

for suppresser me i already use the g36

Thank god
---
thanks dude^^
---
Sorry bro but I can't drop a like. 
---
Nobody uses sledge's shotgun when the L85 is available
---
You sure as hell dont because you are the kind of guy that picks Ash as attacker and on Defense you spawnpeek and die to basically everyone with an IQ of 10 and decent aim
---
Tachanka 
---
I literally said I didnt know the story. That is what I said in the comment directly afterwards. I assumed that is what happened, then someone corrected me.
---
I know I know, but the majority of western Europe do refuse to speak English or dont know much of it. French, German, Russian etc. That's just the joys of playing a multi cultured game but OP doesnt seem to understand that. Must have had a rough game against Mohammad86 and Abdulomar
---
Ur just jealous broscee
---
Fair enough 
---
Diamond skin and packs for the renown you have left
---
I never got this...Ubisoft spends time balancing the game with PC in mind it seems and never addresses this huge issue for console players.  They spent seasons and many patches addressing the whole cheating and boosting issue, but when it comes to keyboard and mouse on console, they don't even mention a word about it
---
For me that's Lesion, since the noise is a super simple tell too and lets me hunt down enemies close to me, but Maestro/Mira are close second and thirds.
---
I think the hate comes from the ‚Äúspraying‚Äù of drones

I missed you in my last stream! Stop by tonight at 845 CST www.twitch.tv/yadii

---
Still no terracotta for the SAS, I'm sad :( good job otherwise
---
Would be interesting to have a game mode where the roles are switched. Attackers defend and defenders attack.
---
Where in my comment was mordibly obese stated? I don't see it anywhere in my comment. She's 70lbs overweight. I couldn't care less what the Ops look like. In fact in any of my comments do you see me complaining about her appearance? Nope just defending the fact that ppl thjnk she isn't fat. She is. And in fact there is the whole body positive campaign, is this part of it? No. Is it because of it? Probably. Let's see bc if it was all guys the game would be sexist, if it was all white it would be racist so without a fat person isn't discriminatory. They've created identifiable silhouettes without one operator being fat. Idc what she is but for the idiots who think she could actually be special forces... Well she can't. She couldn't even pass gym class in middle school.
---
But hey keep getting trigged about things that aren't in my comment 
---
i would recommend wait and grabbing mozzie, as he has similar fragging capability with the commando, and a much better gadget
---
Get him, but remember that as a vigil, you bring NO utility other than your kills. If you aren‚Äôt a strong fragger, consider roaming with jager, or if you already have her, alibi. These operators have more automatic utility they can set up at the beginning of the round, while vigil has to use get kills or waste time during the action phase to have any positive impact.
---
Me: \*Looks at cannon on Fortress\*
---
Tachanka: So it's time
---
To be fair that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen in my experience; you might be overestimating your side of the discussion here.
---
I really don‚Äôt see how this post came as controversial considering I even wrote ‚Äúit really doesn‚Äôt make a difference in the end‚Äù; like, the game‚Äôs gonna be the same even if we have a Year of all female ops; just sharing my perception of something that could be done to add variety to the current 1 and 1 schedule.
---
I feel like 2 ops are good for every season. And a Female is good just for some gender diversity. If anything, there needs to be more minorities represented. 
---
Hibana looking like my future wife 
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, but I wasn‚Äôt sure. 
---
It would be very cool if we could use the touchpad to lean, but I don‚Äôt think Ubisoft will ever implement anything like that. Maybe I‚Äôm biased, but it seems like Ubisoft devotes most of its time and attention to PC, even though most of its player base is on console. I haven‚Äôt seen a single feature on console that isn‚Äôt on PC. Reporting players for toxic behavior doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything on console, where reporting on PC for swearing results in an immediate ban, for example. 
---
I saw a few to be sure. I think you misunderstood my comment. I was pointing out how the comments in OP's meme don't have anything to do with her gender. Making his title pointless. I didn't say anything about the subreddit as a whole. And to say that the community has a problem with women is absolute bullshit. They're are always going to be those people on the internet that like to say edgy shit. But to say that it represents the community, or even the majority of this subreddit is sinply not true.
---
Imagine custom maps and game modes Ala halo or gta. 
---
Thank God
---
We lose the 2 first round, and these three guys lefted, it is a big problem for me and the other who don't quit, I only quit during casual, when the other team or the allies are just toxic
---
Also for the repost idk why I posted it twice, I will delete the other one 
---
While it was always a longshot, I was really curious to see what form it would take. 100 (or even just 50) people in a tower. Like an apartment building.
---
No I understand that and know about the mmr, but Like on PS you can make as many smirfs as you want and it would ruin it. Unless what you‚Äôre saying is once an mmr hits too high then you get removed but then you can argue that it‚Äôs harming new players that pick it up faster 
---
Dude rip cav
---
Boi the upvote is real 420+
---
did it show a message?
---
That's a big **IF**. Lots of people don't control it. And I think you're meaning the Compensator. 
---
How much did you pay for this? Want to order them online but they're pretty expensive
---
... except you clearly took this from YouTube 
---
They already are doing both.
---
you said it right there, its a tacticool game so 'funny skins' dont belong. theres a time and a place for everything bud
---
You're a pussy
---
Hehe, you will get the hang of it if you play enough. If you keep jumping in hotspots you will get good fast. 
---
I was saying to my friend that gridlock was Zarya if she got rid of the pink hair
---
Not if you're playing it competitively  
---
^ela ^is ^trash 
---
While I agree with the trend, I don't think it's fair to say that if you've played one, you've played them all. That's like saying if you've played COD, you don't need to worry about playing BF. Fortnite is a very different game than Apex despite them having the same basic core concepts. PUBG is very different from both of them as well. If we're talking F2P indie BR games on steam, then you're probably more on track but the mainstream ones all seem to differentiate themselves from each other enough.
---
Yep, I was surprised how much better you can control it after figuring this out. 
---
If the game is going to be the same even with all female ops, if it doesn't make a difference in the end, then what's the purpose of this call to action?
---
Nah its an easter egg teaser, the diner is on Mars but from DOOM ETERNAL
---
Eh done right it could be fun, and I'm not even much if a BR fan in the first place.
---
You know what an artist and a sniper have in common?
---
And you've spoken to a "big part of the community?" I think YOU are overestimating your side of the discussion because I can almost guarantee you that more than 50% of the playerbase could not care any less about the gender of the pixels in this game
---
Oh yeah I only 360 one tap mine. But no I get it, when you‚Äôre spraying or shooting with no awareness of your surroundings then it‚Äôs a problem.
---
Iq has a 1911 or something close to it hard to tell

Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
---
I think its great we‚Äôre getting Peru, Kenya and India; all three countries from continents (relatively) barely touched in Siege atm.
---
India is huge to start; Peru is great to represent Western South America; and Kenya Eastern Africa.
---
Ok people shit on BR games but they‚Äôre popular because they‚Äôre fun.
---
The concept of battle royale is perfect for videgames.
---
Doing something to combat the misinformation (espically on this sub) about her hitbox would be fantastic. Too many people believe the meme to be gospel and use it as an excuse when they die. It was funny a few months ago but if it actually had a hand in leading to an op getting nerfed its kinda worrying about what can happen in the future just due to an ignorant segment of the community being really vocal about a non issue.
---
Lol
---
i bought it trough steam. i got it. you'll be good
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the lowest dps in the game, lower than valk.
---
I never brought up anything about Flash Hiders or Compensator, the original comment did. I only said the gun has no recoil, which is practically true. 
---
MUUUURPH!

---
Is that mike wazowski? 
---
You could literally replace the word ‚ÄúBR‚Äù in your comment with any genre of game and it would still make sense, because that‚Äôs the natural life cycle of pretty much all video games.
---
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve played one, you‚Äôve played them all‚Äù is flat bullshit, too. I enjoy Apex due to being a huge Titanfall Fan, but I don‚Äôt really enjoy any other BRs, and none of them play similar. The actually gun play is vastly different if you compare Apex, PUBG, Blackout, etc., but since they are the same genre of game, you are saying they are all the same.
---
Drop all operators into a single arena. Set up like a training arena with 1 level. Circle shaped(picture a circle paintball arena?)
---
Everyone ends up with a random operator and random starting point.. No gadgets. Just weapons.
---
Ranked games health and damage.
---
Everyone is forced towards center like a normal royal.
---
Game mode is out for a week for April fools.

I just hate the long Time to Kill in Fortnite and Apex. I‚Äôm so used to a &lt;4 second spray being deadly in siege.

I don‚Äôt wanna sink 3 mags into one guy. It feels like bullet sponge MMO shit to me. Not epic battles. 
---
But Apex is kinda fun in a stack.

---

---
Exactly, idk why people are thinking I'm saying *DON'T SHOOT DRONES AT ALL* 
---
Exactly.
---
Actually that's false. You don't put fat on your waist and then just cut weight and lose it. She overweight as in someone with a horrible lifestyle not some weight lifter who hasn't cut. Stop trying to find some excuse for a fat physique, if she was a body builder why wouldn't they just make her ripped?
---
Most weight lifters don't look fat, muscle definition tends to show through more often than not. Like for example Hafthor Bjornsson "The Mountain" doesn't look fat, he looks like an absolute unit but he's not ripped either. There's a difference in appearance between muscle and fat, that is what she's lacking. Either way it's a video game but she's still fat 
---
do you have every operator? if so i go for alpha packs, but if you like diamond go for it. i dont see the appeal, as skins get old, but go for it should you need
---
Twitch isnt a 3 speed
---
The unholy trinity of mnk, ping abuse and an ash jag√´r main
---
That's all I see in high plat and dimond
---
Mozzie? Is he the Australian operator?
---
Making the operator-gender decision from Ubisoft more neutral; since they are so fixed in adding female op DLC that they cannot make a male only season; they should know what I wrote in the title.
---
Whatever flows let it come; let‚Äôs not iron-fist ourselves into the 1 and 1 current system (which seems to be what Ubisoft is scared of breaking away from for 3 years now).
---
100k
---
while I can agree that longer range is kind of a buff and I do genuinely believe that was a bad decision to make, I don't think it's a strong enough buff to really counter the nerf that what put on it. Especially now lmao.   
---
Tbh they could've left the gun as is ans just lower the max fire rate a bit, but not this badly. She would've been a much less "annoying" operator
---
They're just jealous that justice rains from above.
---
I‚Äôd like to say that a close quarters battle royal with Rainbows player controller and gunplay would make a great battle royal. I‚Äôd definitely add a little to the player controller like the ability to jump. But put them in a skyscraper with the storm moving vertically closing off floors of the building. Keep the guns barebones so you aren‚Äôt spending time trying to track down a sight. Keep it to handguns, submachine guns, shotguns. Add melee weapons. I think it would be tons of fun.

Be cool if the pocket rat was able to destroy traps. Disarm Kapkan traps and frost mats. Not destroy them. They are still up but attackers can pass by without getting hurt.
---
Oml people will find a way to bitch about anything 
---
On PC the recoil is generally reduced when looking at console. So of course it's generally just a laser. But on console it has significant amounts of kick. Of course it can be managed but it isn't the easiest.
---

If a map is always attacker or defender sided, win or loss starts to simply depend on whether you attack or defend first in overtime.

Well that's an extremely toxic reaction for an extremely mild thing.
---

---
Because removing a scope cuts the operators ranged capability in half. I personally think only dmrs or blatant sniper rifles should have access to acog scopes. Dmrs really dont have a place as much as an assault rifle because at range they rock and up close they can be a detriment more than a help.
---
5 rounds and no holes, instead you can just shoot trough like you do with unreinforced walls, but the wall itself won't deteriorate or fall apart. same with mirrors (op when you are inside a reinforced room defending the defuser or waiting for the last roamer to come back to kill ya)
---
Yeah I know, she's been hit with a bunch of nerfs that she doesn't deserve. But I still love her for what she is. But just a tip use shotgun.
---
Play all of the operators, later down the line you'll lean towards the ones you enjoyed the most. 
---
If possible never limit yourself to only being able to play a couple of operators.
---
Only bad thing is the fact that the icon doesnt show what the operator actually does... like a fricking motorpart?! He is a hackerman not a garageman
---
But thats not your fault ofcourse ;)

I second that

Yeah, he's the motorcycle guy

---
When the CZ is not silenced, it beats the smg12 in every ttk battle - rogue-9 did tests on this. 
---
Thats at least my reason as to why the CZ was always better - the faster ttk wins.
---
I don't like that Ubi balances around optics in the first place. Never once have I died to an opponent and thought "damn that ACOG".
---
It's good to have a main which is beneficial to the team. Such as a hard breacher for Attack or surveillance op for Defense. However, it is also important to learn what other operators can do and how they...operate.
---
Free weekend footage?
---
Ash being a skilled op is a laugh and a half, man.
---
Ash is by far the easiest.
---
Chalet could be a great competitive map with a little rework (more of a Club House style rework intead of a Hereford style)
---
Nah the attackers can put up hard walls
---
you can get fat spawn peeks with maestro

No one is talking about removing ACOG from Ash‚Äôs R4-C? IMO that‚Äôs a huge change and I did not expect it at all.

say 10% of the community chooses Fortress as their all time favourite map, and 20% are indifferent. Imo the other 70% shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer through a shitty, terribly balanced map just because a few really enjoy it (somehow). If the numbers are more even, then well the map won‚Äôt always be banned, so even if it‚Äôs played less than fan favourites, it still gets played by those that enjoy it. 
---
I agree though that if it‚Äôs a straight vote for any of the 9(?) ranked maps, or even vote for map A or map B, a few maps will get buried and never really seen again unless both options are disliked by the community. This is why I want a veto. 
---
It's not a game mode in Dota.

Trust me, if a Siege Battle Royale was announced, Ela would be pointing that gun a bit further up. 
---
Ela is my most played character in the game. I've been playing her ever since I've started. The Scorpion is a horrible weapon. Not every gun fight is 8 meters away nor does the Scorpion shred at that range either. The shotgun is great for range, recoil, and damage as the Scorpion is only decent for anything beyond 20 meters but thats with semi auto on or burst. The automatic firing mode is a joke if even effective. I don't need to look up the shitty pro league as they're just a small percent of the community. Probably .50% at most of the playerbase and going by science that's not a very good testing field. I use the shotgun every time I play and it's a fucking god of a weapon. I know how to play my own character that I have been forever so long. In a 1 v 1 match the FO-12 would kick the Scorpion's ass if it was in full auto anyday.
---
How tf yall get the operator symbols beside your names
---
Glaz isn‚Äôt even...

Okay then.
---
Doesn't surprise me; Ubi is such a joke that they won't rework Tachanka because of tired Reddit memes.
---
Yes. It's been a year already.
---
New Outbreak hats confirmed
---
But they improved her player card drastically. You‚Äôre upset they made it better?
---
My comment got downvoted to oblivion because i stated a fact lmao 
---
And it's all reddit's fault.  IIRC, a mod from the anti-gun r/gunsarecool created the website massshootingtracker.com with a lower than standard definition of what constitutes a mass shooting and addition padding with unverified shootings.  the media took hold of that and went nuts.  much easier to keep a tv tuned to them or fuel a click bait article when they are pushing a sensational story about hundreds of mass shootings a year, with a source!   
---
Yeah they‚Äôre friends lol
---
Looks like Daniel Day Lewis in that one movie
---
Everytime I bring a new friend to the game (about 6 people I introduced the game too) I always bring them to house because its simple and is easy to teach new players how to play via objectives and how different ops work in different places. Its the perfect starter map and I hope they don‚Äôt change it.
---
Yeah but occasionally you survive long enough to shoot someone with the concussion and kill them. Which is fun!
---
iirc every pistol has the same fire rate. like 90% sure on that 
---
Thank you.
---
Sorry this is my first time hearing of this
---
Operator concept. But this isn‚Äôt an operator concept it‚Äôs an icon concept. Also. One of these new characters is a concept that was posted in this community. 
---
I agree entirely trust me I hate the odd map as much as the next person but looking at it from a dev point of view they need to be able to please as many people as possible, i hope some time in the future they do add a system that allows something like this though as it would be a nice qol change

The entire tournament stream was just under 26 hours though so you had to watch the 25 min countdowns and the pre game shows to get diamond. Seems a bit much, I'd be fine with 25 if it actually went the 32-36 hours it was supposed to but most people didn't expect it to run short so they didn't have their streams open before the pre game shows even started which kinda sucks
---
&gt; unless they fix it

see this is where your problem lies in the first place. Also you seem to be really hung up about the masses thing huh, is it a small little snowflake I spot? :)

Hello RandomRedditor027, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/asrv9w/dont_worry_i_apologised/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
thats not true.  played it all the time.

Still man.. I am the Product Owner of an app. There are a lot of steps when developing and releasing a new version. First are the specs (clearly not well done there, as they never thought that making two different displays would ruin the game). Then comes unit testing (Like, can I hear people footsteps when sprinting?). Then, there's integration testing. TTS are integration testing. We are not supposed to make the specs and unit tests for  Ubi guys, I'm sorry. I know the game is old and only  financed by it's community, but it's amateurship. And yes I know a video game is a lot harder than an app. But we should criticize as well, otherwise it's gonna stay like this.
---
I'm ready to pay to play in order to have smart fixes.

Glaz main here, can confirm this was my reaction.  I'm afraid it'll make him useless tho, they could at least give him some small compensation buffs

Well operation health focused on fixing serves hit reg etc. and operation health was actually when I started playing siege but they haven‚Äôt really done any sort of big hitreg fixes lately and when you implement so many new things in the game such as the new leaning and everything we kinda need another platoon health to kinda clean up the mess they made
---
True enough - the CZ did the same, but the lower firerate hindered that. Still though, ttk won it out for me.
---
because it cant be broke lol
---
Would be fun to check it out but not to have it permanently in game. It never hurts to try
---
I think a rotating meme mode would be fun for seige. Stuff like no limits picking, no cooldowns/unlimited gadgets, everyone has pulse sensors, 5x movespeed. Not everyone would enjoy them and a lot of them would be Imbalanced as fuck but for an April fool's day or maybe a weekend only rotating thing I think they would be a fun break. 
---
there's no way their engine could handle 20+ people and with destructive environments it would just be a pile of junk.  They had to go round based or else everything is completely destroyed really quick.
---
If we start making video game characters directly resemble the playerbase, WoW is already a sunken ship.

I think it's stupid and it needs to be removed but at the end of the day in the context of Pro League, it's legit as fuck. I hate playing against in ranked, fuck that shit.

Yeah same I didn‚Äôt do that cause there was many people watching the windows from afar like a Glaz

Do mozzies drones get shut off by mute?

Not on mobile. Just expect mozzie circle jerking for the next two months because "hE's QuIrKy AnD hAs ADD jUsT lIkE mE." eventually the weebs will get over him and move on to spamming other subs.

My wife doesnt use the mic because people usually start team killing or being assholes because she‚Äôs a lady instead of playing the game with her. 
---
Oh, thanks
---
Yeah true, but it's fifty fifty you start out on attack or defence anyways so the more games you play, the more it will balance out.
---
You could have a sudden death round where it relies on gunplay alone, attackers vs defenders, no objective except kill the enemy team.
---
Not perfect but yeah.

Hello ohyeyeye, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/assgi7/got_em/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

yeah, its annoying. I want to play nothing but ranked honestly but casual is the only way ti play console to avoid having it effect you in rank. 
---
I feel old.
---
I really wish Siege was still a rainbow six

I don't give a fuck if the op is male or female they should be fun and not broken. Also some cool voice acting is always awesome.

It feels so satisfying killing Glaz from inside the building when he is on the heliport or the... other thing he climbs to shoot at the master bedroom and office.
---
I have killed a few and it feels great.
---
Because ghost recon would make more sense.
---
Good, if any new mode should be added is a 5v5 or 10v10 recruit tdm with respawn, or ffa. You know normal fps stuff. I don't get the whole br thing tbh. Like is it just me or is it just not fun? I don't see the fun in having to have luck to get decent guns and running around like a dumbass for 15 min and get into a whole 2 not very exiting gun fight. I played pubg for ~100h when it came out because some of my friend loved it and I was bored of my damn mind the whole time.
---
This. All they did was make him a bad entry fragger. He wasnt often used to hold angles before, why would they now? Other DMR ops with an acog can do that job just as well while also bringing a gadget. His rifle is way too similar to every other DMR for being used as a sniper rifle. It's possible he may just not be picked anymore. 
---
I feel like they need to buff his damage significantly and reduce the fire rate accordingly, since as it stands he won't be anything special that makes you actually WANT to take him. His thermal sight and smoke view isn't that relevant if he's going to be holding a different angle, that's not where allies will be throwing smokes lol.
---
I don‚Äôt know how you do it.... but you do it. Incredible 
---
I like it 
---
My aim is bad, I can't get no
---
not on rifles but smgs can benefit
---
Again, do you play on console? Because on PC, recoil is far more controllable, and ROF trumps literally any other stat. For holding angles and fishing for headshots, it's still a monster IMO, second only to the vector and Lesion's SMG.
---
Zarya in muscular, Gridlock is obese 
---
Now you have options
---
man im so happy fortnite came out. it pulled all the kids out of all the games that I played, and make them more generally enjoyable to play
---
why does everyone forget about the division games
---
They could just give the game support and try to split lobbies but thats about all they could do to try and help, fortnite did that and it helped but it wasn't a perfect solution by any means.

Glad you like it
---
Honestly not really. I play on PS4 and can get smooth aim with consistent headshots. Similar to PC its all in the sensitivity and reaction time. 
---
Did you know that all suppressors neutralize threats indicators?
---
Not sure why this has been downvotes simply because shotguns really are inconsistent in the game. Along with a lot of other things tbh. 
---
Mozzie has the RO635

She's simple but 100% aim, which op said he doesn't have.

NO.

If we‚Äôre talking a BR in the PUBG style, Ghost Recon has more fitting gunplay. 
---
Clearly console by the controls in the video. But no rate of fire doesn't mean anything when you can't even hit the target. I can handle the recoil quite well for a console player. Not to brag or anything it's fine. But when you can out damage and out range it at any time that doesn't matter. The shotgun is a better utility weapon since Ubisoft are cunts and got rid of the only gadget that's useful with her. It has the best fire rate of a shotgun in the game, it's even more controllable than the Scorpion and has a very good damage for it's range. I used to use the Scorpion until I used the shotgun and realized it's a better all round weapon for her. It may not get headshot but it will certainly get you more kills per match. That's my testing by the way.
---
I was not expecting that but yes thanks
---
Completely agree
---
No, you haven't. You've been killed and immediately assumed you couldn't possibly have been killed by anyone other than a hacker.
---
Is there kbam on console? Certainly. Is there one in every game in silver... No, I don't believe so. Mainly because if you're in silver with KBAM you're either dropping into copper to meme or you're too bad to make it to plat/diamond even with KBAM. At which point you should uninstall.
---
What if *that* ate your baby

Kinda short-sighted to burn bridges like this.
---
Apex has shown that a squad/class based take on the genre can work very well, and Ubisoft would do good to learn a couple of lessons from that. 
---
Case in point: People have been suggesting a very similar ping system to that of Apex for Siege for years already, like being able to ping wall panels for reinforcement/being opened up and callouts like "I'm covering here".
---
Ubi introducing Garagantua next season confirmed.
---
Sup?
---
You're wrong
---
Thank god. Apex and TF2 are littered with BR ~~(battle rifle)~~ fans. If you check the titanfall subreddit the veterans of the game are pissed
---
How would it even work 
---
It might be interesting if they did something like cs:go where it‚Äôs basically just a decently sized map with like 20 or less people on it. Everyone could spawn as a recruit and just go off lol
---
Aussie skins
---
What?
---
Also using MnK doesn't make you an aim god. Plenty of PC players potato consistently obviously it gets worse the further down you go in rank. At silver/low gold, a controller player has basically an even chance of winning a gunfight. People who only MnK underestimate how good some people can get with a controller.
---
I like it, interesting concept.
---
The damage and ammo capacity on both the Maxim 9 and the MK14 are absurdly low.  You should make the damage on the Maxim 9 around 40ish and the MK14 should be around 60 or 70

yo

Basically that but with gadgets

What if there was an LMG op who just dragged the belt around and their reload animation was hammer throwing the empty belt and then shoving another in

Yes I dont understand this kind of people that bully women and TK them. Also a lot of toxicity.

Australia you say? I'm so glad you mentioned them!

The Australian NFA and the corresponding gun buy back are often attributed to the reduction in homicides seen in Australia, that reduction was actually part of a much larger trend.
---
[‚ÄúThe percentage of homicides committed with a firearm continued a declining trend which began in 1969. In 2003, fewer than 16% of homicides involved firearms. The figure was similar in 2002 and 2001, down from a high of 44% in 1968.‚Äù](https://aic.gov.au/file/5621/download?token=MeehJZoI)
---
Even the [Melbourne University's report "The Australian Firearms Buyback and Its Effect on Gun Deaths"](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/downloads/working_paper_series/wp2008n17.pdf) Found, "Homicide patterns (firearm and nonfirearm) were not influenced by the NFA. They therefore concluded that the gun buy back and restrictive legislative changes had no influence on firearm homicide in Australia."
---
[This paper has also been published in a peer reviewed journal.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2009.00165.x/abstract)
---
[We also see that immediately after this law went into effect there was an increase in violent crimes.](https://aic.gov.au/file/5621/download?token=MeehJZoI) [Specifically assault and sexual assault. the numbers have since gone down. but not to pre-ban levels](https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi359)
---
If we look specifically at the time frame after the infamous ban we see that America still had a nearly identical reduction in the homicide rate as compared to Australia.
---
[Australian Bureau of Statistics data for 1996](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4510.01996?OpenDocument) shows a homicide rate of 1.70, per 100k.
---
[Australian Bureau of Statistics data for 2014](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4510.02015?OpenDocument) shows a homicide rate of 1.0, per 100k, for 2014.
---
That is a reduction of 41.2%.
---
[The FBI data for 1996](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1994-2013.xls) shows a homicide rate of 7.4, per 100k.
---
[The FBI data for 2014](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1) shows a homicide rate of 4.5, per 100k.
---
That is a reduction of 39.1%.
---
We also see that [mass murder still occurs in Australia through other means](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia). Arson is particularly popular being used in the [Childers Palace Hostel attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childers_Palace_Backpackers_Hostel_fire), the [Churchill fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires#Central_Gippsland_fires), and the [Quakers Hill Nursing Home Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers_Hill_Nursing_Home_Fire#Nursing_home_fire). Additionally there was the particularly tragic [Cairns Knife Attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns_child_killings) in which 8 children aged 18 months to 15 years were stabbed to death. Australia has also seen vehicular attacks, like those seen in Europe, in the recent [2017 Melbourne Car Attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Melbourne_car_attack).
---
In America the majority, over 60%, of our gun related fatalities come from suicides. It has often been said that stricter gun regulations would decrease those. However when we compare America and Australia we see their regulations had little to no lasting impact on their suicide rates.
---
Currently the American and Australian suicide rates are almost identical.
---
[According to the latest ABS statistics Australia has a suicide rate of 12.6 per 100k.](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0%7E2015%7EMain%20Features%7EIntentional%20self-harm:%20key%20characteristics%7E8)
---
[According the the latest CDC data the American age adjusted suicide rate is 13 per 100k.](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db241.htm)
---
In addition to this Australia has seen an increase in their suicide rate as well.
---
["In 2015, the standardised death rate was 12.6 deaths per 100,000 people (see graph below). This compares with a rate of 10.2 suicide deaths per 100,000 persons in 2006."](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0%7E2015%7EMain%20Features%7EIntentional%20self-harm:%20key%20characteristics%7E8)
---
While Australia has experienced a decline in the homicide rate this fails to correlate with their extreme gun control measures. This same reduction in murder was seen in America as well as many developed western nations as crime spiked in the 90s and then began it's decline into the millennium.
---
While gun control advocates like to attribute Australia's already lower homicide rate, that existed prior to their gun control measures, to those measures. We see that America saw equal or better progress without resorting to such extremes. 
---
That's actually pretty cool, it's a close fit for maybe a budget build. I have already a 3d printed item I just have to stand down and paint
---
People mashing qeqeqeqeqeqeqeqeqe?
---
Low DPS due to the fire rate alone .
---
A ROF nerf is the LAST thing you should think of 
---
Well that's something Ubi nailed without fucking it up the first time.
---
If I Remember right, it was an Emerson brand softshell jacket. I'm not home, so I'm going of memory 
---
Ok, well yeah I wouldn't be surprised if the shotgun was better on console, they're viable overall. Above copper on PC damage literally doesn't mean shit when every gun is 120 damage in the right hands. The higher the rate of fire, the higher chance that you get that damage. 
---
Even for bad players just spraying starting from the chest is a quicker TTK than a lot of weapons with lower ROF and higher damage.
---
You literally have a mass shooting every other week. 
---
I'm so shocked to see how many Americans are trying to prove that guns aren't an issue. 
---
Get through the next month without a live shooter incident then tell me. Statistically that won't happen though. 
---
If they locked him up for inventing Quiets backstory as an excuse for her lack of clothing, despite Fuck Konami, I would back Konami.

To be perfectly honest, hearing such a weak excuse was used is part of why I never tried it.

for anyone questioning why they would have to address this, look no further than the steam discussions
---
when pulse doesn't see anyone for 5 seconds
---
I guess so. But last time I tried to use a Scorpion was about 10 meters away. Fired a whole mag into the guy, I think it was Buck and well they didn't die. Even though half the shots were headshots.
---
I really hope they give the speed at which his thermal scope returns a buff. I wouldn't be surprised if they did.
---
I think Blitz deserves it more because you have to look at him before you get stunned. 
---
Is it? Is it ruining the game? If they want to stay lower rank, they have to throw or surrender occasionally to lose ELO. Or they win enough to be in plat/diamond ranks on that account too. Either way, you aren't fighting them after your 1 match. And trust me, I know what it feels like to be 1 match away from plat 1 or whatever and get smacked. So I know that's frustrating, but in the grand scheme of things, if you're a regular player, you shouldn't have to worry about facing smurfs once a night. If you're playing regularly, 1 match isn't going to lose or gain you enough ELO to make a difference.
---
I know you want an outlet to bitch about how life is unfair but suck it up buttercup.

I had the pro J√§ger bundle on xbox, I lost it when I swapped to PC

Dokkaebi farted.

"Be so fun" No. 
---
It's just not that simple to balance for this game. They already have extreme difficulty balancing the OPs already in the game. A bolt action would more than likely be a OHK and if it isn't, it probably won't be worth picking that OP in any situation. This isn't battlefield with huge sprawling maps or CoD that is extremely arcadey where you can quick snipe. The balance is too hard as of now.
---
These new ops have bred some of the cringiest fan art this sub has ever seen
---
I‚Äôll tell you when it comes out on xb1...

I have and I hate it 
---
We don't need Kenya either, WE NEED OPS.
---
I did read your post, but i still don't see the point, what if there are two countries that are the same thing in your opinion.
---
From Lore POV - "Rainbow recruits the best ops" what if they didn't find something good there.
---
Fucking Fortnite and Apex kids

No you really don't. I only play PC and I see it all the time.

Yep. It is the easiest map to learn. I used to love this map when I first started playing in casual.

I'm just giving you an explanation of why you'll never see paki ops.
---
Attacker drones are gone :crab:

Reminds me of cayde

yeah but doesnt twitch dtonrs only do 10 damage. and people have 120 health?
---
Holy shit his is great advice 
---
ok so it's just me, ty
---
Same reason with Isreal. Even though I support Isreal. We'll never see them in game.
---
lol who even expected it?
---
I'm just waiting for some professional to come along and tell us how this is all wrong and not how pistons work
---
To be clear I have no clue if it is or not, it's just inevitable 
---
If the current system uses a range like that then there wouldn't be a problem like the one OP had. 
---
Vanilla ops are also the base of the game. DLC ops are meant as a flavor substitution with some pros and some cons compared to their counterparts (if there are any)
---
I don't really care what you believe or what your opinion is.

I don't even know the first floor yet

I really wish they just kept the same outside style of old Hereford. It was fine to add more rooms but at least keep the same style of it being concrete on the outside. Not a fan of it being brick. It just looks so different. 
---
I don't quite understand the opposition. If they add the mode and you dont like it, why not just not play it?
---
Good
---
Ubisoft is just realistic.
---
The game can barely handle 10 players on the same server half the time, imagine if there was 100.

This... this... this could work....

Actually galaxy brain from the twitch wtf

Please- I know what it's like to be a Blitz main. This gay was toxic and sending hate messages to my friends and I so he deserved it.
---
I personally find BR can be really fun. It sounds like you might be a bit on the safe side of the game, which can get really boring. You should try dropping hot more often. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I feel like it‚Äôs pretty hard to go wrong with thatcher and/or lesion. They are both simple, helpful, and easy to use imo

I guess people missing Jager with ACOG were hoping for a R6 BR to get thwir wishes...now all your dreams are crushed lmao
---
Wonder if gridlock is a reference to her arteries 
---
I know, I just wanna know
---
Exactly why a secret service agent would use them. They only shoot to kill and is not in a warzone. 
---
Oh yeah I was kind of shocked to find out that it's even a feature, makes sense though since if you run out of belts you'd literally have to single load rounds since disintegrating belts aren't really meant to be re-used  
---
r/entitledaussies
---
I‚Äôm glad there is no BR in siege
---
You are part of the problem buddy. It is very obvious that you did not buy a xim just to use it in casual... 
---
other than the scorpion mag, which aren't? Discounting guns that aren't military issued, most mags are standard
---
I like ela cause I‚Äôm the right hands she can be the most offensive defender, 3 speed and disorientation mines you can get around the map and screw people over at close range and just spray them down with her scorpion 
---
i just got this game ive played 200\~ games and havent encountered a single hacker. anecdotal but im just saying its not as bad as u think
---
Wow, I knew he sounded familiar 
---
Only once. You just hold it down and let go if I'm correct
---
I personally preferred Blackbeard simply because the shield and I could handle the weapons well. 
---
Also Mute (once you know how to place hammers effectively) and Rook (useful for the team instantly even if you die first). 
---
Imagine trying to shoot through a bullet-proof shield tho???
---
Thank fuck for that.
---
Very epic spawnpeek!
---
I'm just repeating what website said if you have a more legit source of the mass shooting be my guest 
---
Like assault in SMITE
---
Host doesn‚Äôt matter anymore from my understanding.  It is the low elo of the copper that pulls them down into your rank.
---
Me neither 
---
Ok how cool would it be if you missed shooting the drone spider it would scurry away and his at you as it went back to Mozzie!
---
I change my opinion after playing recruit with the AR33
---
Show me proof that Pakistani SSG is ranked below Kenyan?
---
Oh would you look at that, Blitz *isn't* on that list. It's almost like he's not as OP as the filthy casuals seem to believe.
---
You didn‚Äôt catch my point 
---
Hello! (sorry for bad English)
---
I still suck after 600 hours, so definetly
---
ITS HIIIIIIGH NOON
---
Why do they waste time on this
---
Exact same combo. With Far Cry 5 for the occasional single player shooter. 
---
I love how obvious it is most people who cover games don't play or know about games. 
---
An interviewer even asking this question is an immediate flag they don't know shit about Siege. Just tossing out the latest industry buzzword because it's on their checklist. 
---
I third that
---
Wish we would just get a gun like the one lion is using here, in game
---
Medusa icon in Blitz is not even tied to Medusa, it's more like to Perseus myth. Perseus killed Medusa and tied her head to his shield so he can "Blitz" his enemy
---
All i see is australian scout 
---
Something like that happened to me earlier today... stoppiiiiiiiiit
---
Dang a 4 minute wait what the heck 
---
no lag that
---
I fucking love scratch. I used to do this shit all the time
---
This plus the dissapointing Elite skin is just depressing. 
---
Oh thank you
---
I want an M24
---
Dont expect it, it will come by suprise
---
Have you checked the loads on the GPU and CPU when playing ? 
---
Happy cake day
---
Bro this is epicüòé
---
Ah I see now, thank you for the explanation 
---
Should be able to steal Lion's drone. 
---
Where did u got this and is there the one of mozzie? 
---
They both float around 50-60
---
Blitz looks like Thomas the tank engine 
---
Nobody:
---
Pengu: *Tachanka is literally more broken than Lion when Lion‚Äôs drone goes off you can still shoot Tachanka behind cover literally is invincible you can‚Äôt shoot him Ubisoft needs to get their act together and focus on the real issues!11!!!1!!*
---
It's like _because_ you're level 12. I got a couple of my friends to start playing, they are both below 20 atm. Almost every game someone tries to kick one of them.
---
Pick up as much info as you can and hop into ranked ASAP. It's better there usually.
---
&gt; and having "larger range" with her help which she doesn't want to
---
Laying on the innuendo.
---
Yes it would
---
How much do you charge
---
Thank fuckin god
---
The FBI definition of a mass shooting is one with at least 4 casualties. Yes, woundings count towards the total.
---
but... why
---
Man I‚Äôve gotta tell you. You‚Äôve got some incredible work! 
---
Yeah, of course they want Ubisoft BR, but it would pretty clearly be Far Cry or, less likely, Ghost Recon (in the style of Wildlands). Even with the "Ubisoft Shared Universe," none of their other franchises are really suitable for Battle Royale gameplay, and Far Cry has the benefit of the Dunia Engine, which has shown multiple times that it's capable of well-functioning multiplayer with vehicles on large-scale easy-to-manipulate modular maps.
---
Wait, what‚Äôs that ring of light for?
---
From Team Fortress 2?
---
I think that‚Äôs why they make such a great team. ;D They really complement one another perfectly in my opinion.
---
They were making me a hibana wallpaper then got banned i think
---
Mira relies on a team that knows what they're doing. If everyone just starts reinforcing whatever walls they want Mira becomes practically useless. Meastro would probably be a more solid pick since he can set up wherever.
---
Similiar argument for Jackal and Dokkaebi. Jackal can run solo or with the team. If you try to play Dokkaebi with a team that is running around doing whatever you're going to get very frustrated by how little they capitalize on your phone calls.
---
I'm sorry my ability to read rules offended you!
---
I'm super disappointed about the gadget skin, it could've been like a motorcycle engine, but all it is is just flames. 
---
Yes, Indeed it is
---
here are my issues, not ordered, not complete:
---
&gt;this is how they treat a fan of the game with over a thousand hours
---
Assuming you mean yourself, Urethra_Cactus only has 400 hours
---
Even if you helped ban X accounts, that does not mean that you get a free pass from everything, if you were MANUALLY deemed ban worthy, it's probably for the better
---
Leaks are not secret inside jobs, so ubi has no reason to check employee accounts because of that (Correct me on this one if someone can, but I would need actual proof that I'm wrong)
---
Pulling out the dictionary definition of a word is quite possibly the laziest and most ineffective counter argument, if you can even call it one.
---
Maybe that definition makes sense from a perspective free from social influence, but in certain societies different ethnic groups hold the power over others. In the west, it's white people who hold that power, and this is where we're talking about.
---
Not in America.
---
nice
---
I mean would you want to play a battle royale where a single headshot kills you?
---
Only thing I could think of is their ability to 180 turn around in the blink of an eye
---
This is good news but it is a low bar to clear to hear a popular multiplayer game won't have battle royale in it these days.
---
I'm fine if maps like House, Plane and Favela don't get reworked.
---
How
---
I like it, my friends think she looks like hobo.
---
Remove the four cities with the strictest gun control laws (Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, and New Orleans), and the U.S. drops to fourth from the bottom in violent crime rates.
---
Correction just checked it's actually around 70-80% for the gpu but 50-60% for the cpu
---
Can we get her claymore back tho? 
---
It's very interesting how the most banned ops contrast so extremely but the 3rd place and back are much closer. I think every level of gameplay in this game faces different challenges and may explain why silvers dont ban glazed but a pro would ban right away. Very cool.
---
I dont get why no one notices apex is literally titanfall
---
Well this needs to be up voted more
---
Anyone who plays Siege knows its backend is far too spaghetti to even attempt BR.
---
Looks more like a member of some paramilitary rather than Rainbow 6 unit. Looks dope though. 
---
&gt;Discounting guns that aren't military issued
---
That Glaz made me vomit profusely. *You're not Beaulo, stop acting like it.*
---
To be honest, I think that Blitz needs a few tweaks but this proves in my mind that he doesn‚Äôt need severe nerfing like people are calling for. 
---
This is such a wholesome post. Thank you! Love the cosplay btw.
---
we all would, but optimism falls short of real world politics and ideologies. Its why groups like ISIS and extreme political groups exist. Either way its going to be a long time from now, theres a lot of deep scars that need to be healed. And the two of us aren't going to fix years of hate and conflict over a discussion of which operator should be added to a video game, on a subreddit
---
was thinking the same thing
---
Same. I have 600 hours and Plat 3-2. I have really only come across one or two hackers. It's seriously not as bad as people think.
---
It just seems that way because when they are in your game, it REALLY ruins your day.
---
this is gay 
---
Are you playing with the ultra HD texture packs?
---
If maestro or echo is alive they should be able to fight for the controls. They each get half input if they're both on it like that internet controlled robot.
---
this is test server?
---
Please explain why all the cities in the U.S. with the most stringent gun control laws (Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans) also have the highest violent crime rates, then.
---
I laughed, just because the first 10 seconds with you walking I thought "slimy as fuck" meant like...dirty. So i turned up the volume to listen listen if the footsteps were squishy.
---
TTK will definitely change. Currently he is a 2 shot kill at most for any operator if you don't make headshots. And headshots are a lot harder with the OTS relative to other weapons because of its low fire rate. If you are playing against a rook with armor on, it can be as much as 4 bodyshots to kill. By that time a random spray through the smoke in the general direction of the shots is likely to hit your head. 
---
What I currently find off with Glaz if one disregards his gadget, is that you can easily be contested by a rook, echo or anyone with an ACOG purely because the 5 shots they shoot at you are more likely to kill you with a headshot than the one neckshot that you can send back. They peek (think about those half second quick peeks), so they have the advantage.
---
A higher RPM could be nice, but this is not useful when holding angles. If I consider an actual sniper, I would think of holding a tight angle and having the reflex to hit one bodyshot in the second that someone passes by, or that millisecond that someone tries to outpeek you. This is currently very hard because of the low damage per shot, not because of the low RPM.
---
For that reason I think that a damage increase with a lower RPM would make Glaz a better sniper than a higher RPM with the same damage. I do not think a 1 shot kill is necessary, except maybe for 1 armor, but there should be a little more danger in him on longer angles. Currently you can easily risk running past and maybe taking one bodyshot.
---
One could then argue that because of the high damage Glaz would become OP at short range, but this is strange considering he was considered sub-par before the rework when he already did high damage. I think that a longer ADS time would then be nice.
---
With this change, Glaz would be more able to hold longer angles, still cover plants through smoke, and still decent at close range. 
---
I am not no
---
You should have the first 20 ops for free. That was an update i think in year 3. 
---
The flashbang will still flash you if you stand close to it. It doesn't work like in cs:go
---
meanie ): 
---
It used to be there like 2-3 days that may just have not updated
---
she was farm girl, duh.
---
Being animated make it make more sense.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not good because nomad isn‚Äôt bombastic I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs not good just compared to this two people standing at a desk for eternity is kinda lame
---
My friend has a legendary for rook that is literally just a slightly darker blue.
---
As a side-note: *yes* 10% meets the definition of "up to 60%" off, but *no* this doesn't prevent it from being false/misleading advertising.
---
Steam is ultimately liable, but from a practical point of view I wonder who is to blame? i.e. Did Steam put that sale picture up or did Ubisoft do it?  Has Valve just failed to activate the sale?
---
1. Dokkaebi
---
2. Buck
---
3. Sledge
---
4. Montagne
---
5. Finka
---
Yep!
---
 No
---
MiRa Is BaD rIgHt nOw
---
bruh i dont know what youre on about but the SAUSAGE-12 SEMI-AUTOMATIC THOT BUSTER ASSAULT SHOTGUN is awesome
---
Me too, this looks so clean
---
Did you actually get banned or not?
---
What about ash and ash's head?
---
I appreciate the well thought out argument with reasoning and an explanation on why it wouldnt be a good idea. You have thoroughly convinced me 
---
Pope and Roman
---
I dont expect anything, how can i expect one room to have THAT many angles
---
This little quips are what makes siege so close to my heart along with the god tier gameplay.
---
Noice brother! Keep up the strong work 
---
Well at least he can fidget with his drones and not hold angles
---
Is it only on siege 
---
Good question? Why are you getting grim sky? The current operation is Wind Bastion.
---
‚ÄòAsh needs a rework blitz is in a good place ‚Äò
---
Noice brother! Keep up the strong work
---
The clip isn‚Äôt working for me, can someone send me a link?
---
Mozzie was pulling out the Golden Gun while Gridlock had The Last Word.
---
You can‚Äôt just call a country rubbish wtf
---
Cant think of anything off the top of my head but they're definitely out there
---
It's gotten pretty bad. I want to be clear though, there are still people who use a controller in plat and diamond, and it's pretty easy to tell that they are just good. You also have to be aware of people using modded controllers that have paddles. I really want to make it to plat, and I was literally one game away this season, but then came in the MnK players, and they absolutely destroyed us. I have friends who have made it to diamond and plat on PS4 using only a controller, and after watching how they play, it's easy to tell when someone is using MnK. It's an unfair advantage, but life isn't fair. I just constantly try to get better with a controller, and hopefully someday have the ability to surpass any MnK player who decides to just be a douche. 
---
:O
---
You should try spinning, it's a good trick! 
---
I get Lion, Maverick and Monty... but why Thermite?
---
[link](https://v.redd.it/1yh5l9tz9lz11)
---
Ok, I understand that, but to me that is a different issue than matching *existing* diamond players that are queued with Copper/Bronze teammates to a Gold/Silver lobby. To me it seems that Ubi should do something about De-Ranking as a problem and something about high tier players queuing with low tier players as 2 separate problems. 
---
yeah and it was tactical realism
---
Same to you! Happy cake day!
---
Their elo is spread out. You guys are all around the gold 3 level. They have a low gold and a higher gold and a bronze with two plats, one of whomever bottom fragged. 
---
Absolute mad lad
---
Yes mom
---
1st week of March probably.
---
THOT BUSTER üòÇüëå
---
I prefer his VSN thats just me
---
Judging that you already use it in casual, I doubt you don't use it regularly. Go ahead I guess. Nothing is stopping you man.
---
Those Surefire casket mags don't even work half the time with 5.56mm 
---
I've had a sneaking suspicion I have some form of ADD/ADHD for a long time now, but I'm of two minds about it. The first says that all the symptoms I ever read for ADHD fit me almost to the letter, and the second says I'm self-diagnosing. It doesn't help that my dad is adamant about me NOT having it.
---
Yea me too. Even tho its reusing an old gun I'm also kinda glad they know that you can put a mag in a SAW rather than coming up with some complete bullshit gun like they did with the V308
---
That would be awesome! I would really appreciate it if you could, whenever you can that is
---
You mean Hugh Jackman?
---
I don't see how that can create a loop. Maybe Thermite and Bandit.
---
My point is I‚Äôve played tones of rainbow games and not once have I felt the urge to go online and demand Lion be nerfed because I was killed by him, instead I flank, dodge, kill or even [gasps] stand still whilst his ability is active (because believe it or not his movement detecting drone is activated when it detects [dramatic music] *movement*). Granted this doesn‚Äôt always work because sometimes he‚Äôs a good shot or I screw up or something and prompts to him if he does get that kill, it was a good play. 
---
You wouldn‚Äôt get pissed and go online because sledge killed you with his hammer or ash with her breach charges and what‚Äôs funny about that is it‚Äôs actually easier to just stand still for like 3 seconds than it is to kill ash or sledge. 
---
ALSO everyone using the recent matches as ‚Äòproof‚Äô that he‚Äôs OP because ‚ÄútHe BeSt PlAyEr In ThE wOrLd WaS kIlLeD bY hIm‚Äù and that ‚ÄúiT wAs ImPoSsIbLe FoR hIm To WiN‚Äù let me ask you this: if it was soooooo impossible for that strat to be beaten then why wasn‚Äôt it used every time? Smoke sight, lion uses his ability whilst monty defends and ____ plants? Simple: because the defenders managed to kill the enemies or block them in some other way from doing that strat. Meaning what we‚Äôve learnt is that not only is it possible for that strat to be beaten but that it gets beaten ALL THE TIME. 
---
6 inch blade???
---
I think the issue is that everyone willing to play on the TS plays on the Outback exclusive casual mode.
---
I play Fuze way too much... cause explosions
---
Honestly I agree, this game has some bad people, but they are making a tk system so you don't get tk'd as often.
---
1st week of March.
---
Man how many hours did you put into the game in that time frame? That‚Äôs ridiculous 
---
I really don't care about my rank. I rather just enjoy playing siege playing ranked rather then entering the toxic cesspool that is casual.
---
According to lore she is serious and he is a rusher 
---
1st week of March is when it will be.
---
Do you have an AMD card?
---
Casual man lol
---
How old are you
---
Console casual too hah 
---
No, that actor who played green lantern in that horrid movie and costume 
---
You didn't read my post. I said I love AUGs and want to see more AUGs added.
---
Casual*
---
12 shots
---
*spins*
---
What kind of comp sci class
---
I use his shield actually, and I really like it. My k/d is over one with it and the pmm hip fire is insane
---
The shield is way underrated 
---
Sounds like one of those kids whom aren‚Äôt an annoying shit.
---
Against code of conduct go report urself piece of crap
---
We were lucky enough to play them the game before and the "bronze" player got 12 kills. These guys are using smurf accounts to boost elo
---
Why did you tk him?
---
Do it with a controller then 
---
Your monitor is failing.
---
You made this? I made this!
