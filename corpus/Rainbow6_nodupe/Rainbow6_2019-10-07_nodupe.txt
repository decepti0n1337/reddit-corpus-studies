Why did I think the iPhone was chard from being on fire
---
Kills dont matter if your a support op
---
almost dropped a drone ace, teammate stole the last kill had to tk him 😤😤😤
---
&gt; i never knew neckshots are not head shots
---

---
Im saying the opposite(not the original commenter here) 
---
neck shots should be headshots unless they changed it again.

Ubisoft will never listen to us, they don't care about the ranked or pro players- they ignore us in favour of the casuals.
---
Holy shit they’re bad. Are you in gold?
---
R u good they rework maps that are unfairly balanced and change it because it takes more time for them to make a new map then just rework one
---
Maybe you can control the dog like in cod ghosts
---
No you can't.
---
Like if you said this about cod then yea I could agree. But in a game where precision aiming is better than movement then no.
---
If it was equal pro Siege players on Xbox would cross over to PC for the free money. But they don't
---
What is MnK?
---
[removed]
---
I like the kanal rework.
---
Hereford not so much but kanal I feel is just fine.
---
Console players think they can tell, and expect Ubisoft to code super AIs to detect them and ban them. Rainbow six console players are the most disconnected from reality people I've ever seen. They have no fucking clue what they are talking about with MnK and DDoS and yet they think themselves so much smarter than Ubisoft and Microsoft who have been in the business for decades.
---
I don’t think it will. The problem is not aming at the enemy it’s controlling the recoil to get a headshot. If you put a mnk vs a controller the mnk will get the headshot first because you can easily run a higher sens and have better recoil control.
---
U are an idiot. These ideas suck especially the vigil nerf. You are obviously low rank lol

BREAKING NEWS VIDEOGAMES PROMOTE ALCOHOL TO KIDS!
---
Me: so does fake news
---
I waited thirty seconds to see someone pop up on that angle you had on the rotation hole before realizing the video was paused
---
K-Anal is cool now.
---
It's insanely defender sided to the point where attack will never win against competent players. I'm speaking from the view of a PC Plat player btw.

That’s awesome my dude.

I play in gold and have won attack on canal plenty of times. Lol
---
Found the incel
---
Its doc elite
---
Usually Maverick brings out his BIC lighter and fucken burns the downed one
---
Hm
---
I play pc as well. Not as high in the ranked latter sadly. I do suppose that would effect it.
---
Either way it’s still better than Hereford. Plus the 3 rounds and switch just isn’t good in general imo.
---
They need to rework the maps already in the ranked pool like Skyscraper and Chalet. The last time they reworked a dogshit casual map was Hereford and look how that turned out.
---
Yeah your right! The parts are backwards or whatever
---
Tbh the skill gap in this game mostly comes from map knowledge and strategy. While it could help them in gunfights it isn't the most necessary thing. I mean, a controller player basically owned shroud and his team during that creator comp thing. That's just the way I see it
---
Elaborate.
---
No that's definitely toxic
---
You're an asshole
---
Yes. Yes it has. I’ve never been so triggered in all my life !!
---
Bruh don’t go adding pictures of people accusing you of using a mouse.
---
Done -&gt; Drone...English why you so confusing
---
My highest was 89
---
How do you attack the map to win?
---
What do u expect ur on console it is very hard to build muscle memory on console
---
That chanka running in to give her a mounted lmg... The community isn't so toxic after all.

This is the first time i've bought all 4 because they're dope

Ha! I dont have to listen to that. I'm a solo, so as soon as the rush and die I get voted to kick. It sucks

That's... that's a lot of vodka... please take care of your liver

new maps are always defender sided at the beginning.

If you're already good with vertical play, buck. Otherwise maverick

That’s super cool!

Didnt Germany disagree to stop the use of mustard gas in the war? I know they hated the shotguns but as far as i know they never said they will stop using it
---
Its ok since we dont do it that often but you are basically right ^^"

Also: im 2m tall, weight about 135kilo, drink water and eat enough before and after...

Even after downing the whole bottle my alcohol level was below 2 (we have some tests at home)

nah hold i don’t have my glasses i’ll be back
---
What about robo dog
---
Idk I just posted the meme
---
One great thing to do is run her with tachanka cause a reinforced wall that gets a mirror lets him get covered by a bullet proof wall with a hole in it. I do this in the garage on outback.
---
STOP THE SKILL IS HURTS AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Who is the second person? Never seen her in the game.
---
?
---
Honestly you should've made an argument for why you think it should be in. As most just think it's not really necessary to have
---
We were in party chat together, he did it as a joke cause he wanted to get a kill
---
You’re a champ thanks
---
Never heard that joke before.
---
is he not able to go back inside?
---
literally any
---
Hey you gotta have a certain skill to miss like that.
---
??? Find me any pro saying that.
---
What do you play on??
---
Dog on a jet
---
I've watched this about several dozen times and I just realized the parts are flipped because in the other half you see the other tachanka coming to give her the lmg for the first half.
---
He’s just standing there... MENACINGLY!
---
I use V

Thermite scared me

yeah its easier.

I doubt it because some of us thought we were getting FAP for Peru and MSF for Mexico, Amaru has a made up CTU so India might have a made up CTU and Kenya
---
Cool, but I finally got copper four so get 1 upped
---
Explosives travel through any small gap
---
Wdym as bad aim, for console it was perfectly locked into her head
---
Yep that’s what it was
---
I hate how bright they made every God damn map. This looks so much better than it does now.
---
Imagine being the rook and you get a bullet to the back to the head for trying to defuse
---
i love the chanky kang running with his turret in the background
---
mmmk  thanks
---
Anyone who seriously thought we would get a CTU nicked FAP is just stupid. It's more likely we'll see this CTu especially considering they use H&amp;K MP5's which means recycled guns. Something that is a new common.
---
What a game that was huh?
---
Yeah she lost her barbed wire
---
You’re got downvoted but not the other guys lol
---
Fuck geese
---
*happy German noises*
---
Alexa, play "Shooting Stars"
---
Let me correct you there. That acc is above and beyond pro. He is literally making shots connect with his mind without firing them. Masters I smurf clearly
---
Just oh hey let’s defu- *bullet enters brain*
---
if you die and if you dont get a kill mean ill have no liver 15 minutes into the game
---
AHHHHHH ITS HIM MY RIVAL
---
Played the campaign for a good three hours. Here’s the run down:
---
-the controls are disgusting:
---
      -to scope in you press up on the d pad, left and right to lean in there respective positions, however you can lean and walk.
---
      -x to reload, and y to change from night vision, thermal, and normal vision.
---
     -then typical right bumper to shoot, left stick to look around and c stick to move.
---
-the game itself is hard to control since the GameCube controller has very little accuracy.
---
-the missions are very vague and hard to understand and get very frustrating
---
-Maps have terrible lighting so it’s hard to see enemies without toggling between the visions constantly
---
-Like siege every bullet instantly kills and if you lose health you do not gain it back.
---
-the variety of guns and throwables is nice, although there is no customization to them.
---
-splitscreen does not have an option to 1v1. Only terrorist hunt and co-op campaign practice
---
-the graphics are not that bad for being on a GameCube. They look like Medal of Honor on the ps2 on a little lower settings.
---
All in all it’s amazing to see how the series has progressed to how it is today.
---
Jessie from Team Rocket in Pokemon
---
He should have a pretty sick bag of tricks by now then lol
---
[deleted]
---
Damn!
---
im assuming youre using a pistol here, prefiring with it is a much better idea then “concentrated shots”
---
better than beaulo
---
Yeah 6 assist plus the kills would give him about that. Plus the points for drone kills and finding the objective
---
Bruh
---
Hounestly, a dog would ruin the feel of the game in a major way. Ask yourself if it would make sense in an real world hostage crisis, if the FBI came through the door with a dogo. It wouldn’t.
---
You want me to die in my first round or something?
---
That's exactly what happened
---
Everytime im MVP ill say Drink up, just in case.
---
The funny thing is, I play better the drunker I am. So this game is perfect for me.
---
Shushhh! I don’t want people to know I am a weeb!
---
Fucken mood
---
*picks Ying*
---
I don’t understand
---
Rewatch it as an adult. It try’s a little too hard to be profound but it’s still pretty damn clever and pays homage to the western genre with quite a bit of reverence.
---
Sledge had feather falling, duh.

I feel like you need to try to lose that many in a row

Instructions unclear. Woke up the next day with my bottle standing upside down and a floor that smelled like beer

thank god you had an lmg

Maybe
---
Buy Zofia and rook call it a day
---
130ish
---
That's a faulty shield
---
Is it even physically possible to spam 5 bullets from a pistol in .25 seconds?
---
If you own the standard edition it doesnt give them to you afaik
---
Get oofed on
---
The reason I moved to pc 2 years ago is because I also played like this and so did everyone else. It’s pathetic. Mouse and keyboard is just the best. The game becomes more fun, faster and better.
---
It’s Ubisofts official it’s always been messed up
---
You had the perfect opportunity to call it fapkan but ya didn’t :c
---
I read this in Davie504’s voice send help
---
we would all be blacked out in like 4 matches
---
I did that too but on defence, on Kafe, with frost, on secure area and with a SHOTGUN. And it was a 1v5 but since I was a newbie still I forgot to clip it.
---
i already have both
---
Me too
---
You’re set then
---
Bring this me and I'm like how what that not a headshot
---
I have no idea lmao welcome to reddit
---
I'm in this picture and I dont like it
---
I'm really good at missing especially with Monty's pistol when I ADS
---
Who try’s to kick you when you just killed 4 people? Someone who’s jealous that’s who.
---
Nicely done. I think they should increase eagle recoil though lol.
---
thank you. we will look further into it
---
That happened to me once too
---
Nah the rook is just sad that no one asked him to drop the armor.
---
cuz
---
K/d is a bit low but you just started so I wouldn’t stress about stats to much
---
Spawn peeking a Drone, that’s next level Jäger/Doc main toxicity.
---
Makes since as TL is a Brazilian team
---
Yes, that would be great
---
Forgot to mention that mute also is acogless
---
Nerf flex
---
Just hop in t hunt and play with it for like an hour, very good way to learn recoil
---
lol
---
Been like 2-3 years 
---
idk lol
---
I am curious where I can get a Tachanka DP28. Like, damn, that's a fine looking prop.
---
*details*
---
Most definitely
---
r/unexpectedincredibles
---
You can see through them from both sides though.
---
It’s a harsh penalty but you’ve learned your lesson haha
---
Awww, i acutally really feel bad. You've just changed my gameplay.
---
I can hear Bandit Radio in the background
---
Ubisoft: Betcha guys didnt know you could do *that* in this game!
---
Ubisoft under its breath: Bc I know I sure as fuck didn't....
---
a quite interesting idea, however roamers, while gathering important information through cams, would always destroy their phones, and an anchor could easily do the cam work for them. it would completely ruin dokka, to be honesty, since calling to detect roamers is her best use. (though dokka, while annoying, has shit weapons and isn't used too often)
---
alternatively, you could, in a squad, use mute to roam or ask your mate to set up a mute jammer near your roaming spot. most dokkas waste both their calls in the first minute without gathering much information out of it.
---
I see a lot less boosters and cheaters nowadays. I think that oobisoft finally managed to fix this issue
---
Damn rip should’ve stop after 2 losses that’s what I do if I lose 2 games in a row I stop and find another team but that was when I wanted plat 3 I don’t care about my rank anymore I just play ranked but I switched to PC and it’s 10X harder then console
---
Na it says “look here, smile - wait for flash“
---
Stop it
---
It completely depends on what you plan on doing. Sometimes you want to bandit trick. Sometimes you just need to jam. Bandit is great for stopping a breach in snowmobile on chalet. Yet mute can get the laundry hatch in oregon on the laundry site. There is no better operator for every map and much less every obj.
---
Never
---
Imagine opening an Alpha pack and the skin you get says "Hello negro".
---
I don't care what the illustrations say, the shield goes on the carry handle.
---
I believe it's real because why is in another language? and why is the operator with the ghillie suit hidden as well as their codename? if it was photoshopped we'd see what both operators look like and their codenames would be present.
---
How do we know this isn't a concept of them "the making of untitled season's operators" the developers always do those after a season drops what if it is the India/Kenya operators but early concepts of them?.
---
I just shoot the bag
---
*is it a drone, is it a leg* NO ITS A C4
---
Everytime I do it makes me laugh.
---
Why have you posted some standard gameplay
---
Nah that's friggin stupid. A tactical pogo stick would be far more viable.
---
Hello BrowniesGoHam, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/degj3b/bugsbugsbugsbugsbugsbugs/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

It’s whatever it’s a game people can get over it. Things like this happen in real life too in other ways.
---
Next Attacker: Drone with C4 on the front
---
To be honest, I almost never use a shield to hide behind. Got naded too many times for that. If I want to go on drone there are enough ‘natural’ hiding places(desks, half wall etc)
---
1/8 speed, 8 armor, ftfw
---
Rook have to place that armor very carefully, cause he's not going anywhere else from that spot
---
4r ergd dag Janneke van de voorkant is een beetje Zoals ik ook nog effe komen er aan
---
Sens?
---
Yea but I think he gets stuck for like a second or two
---
Nice job! Now I want to see an Ash cosplay with the springbreak cap I got 10 times as a duplicate
---
in game?
---
90
---
dead zone on the lowest (i think its -5?)
---
aim down sight 75-80
---
They call him... Protato
---
You should use a C4, that’s like saying give Valk a shield, no one would use it
---
Don’t pick cav if you’re going 0-3
---
Is this t-hunt?
---
They don't do shit, happened to me twice now and both reports got the same stock response
---
I wanna buy this as a poster
---
Wdym?Do you see how thicc he is?
---
Nothing is getting through that.
---
A man of culture
---
You should’ve gone for the head
---
20 kills in 6 rounds, impressive dude! I like the last nade:D
---
Are you on PC or phone?
---
Are you using a standard response curve(straight line)?
---
Thats enough Fuze
---
I wish someone did the “Ooops I missed my pistol shot”
---
Try via twitter, they responded to me rather quick on there
---
Lmao that is dumb, maybe it works, but its dumb
---
C E R A M I C T R A U M A P L A T E S
---
That's a good question, cause for some people, that would be a LOT of mmr
---
Those sharp eyes tells me that she planted a welcome mat under my legs . Right now
---
That aim is god awful
---
Some of my friends say that have received mmr and I have seen one or 2 post about it on reddit
---
that could work, however there are to many things that you would have to transition to jackal and some people used r6 creds to buy it. so what would they do, give them back their creds and then say " you get a dog!"? people wouldn't like that
---
But you cant be good if you never play her
---
Yeah end of season they have hard resets so you do the placements again and hopefully don’t get stuck in the bronze silver problem
---
it looks like they just stepped out of the game :o
---
Found someone who likes to cheat.
---
We forgive u because of the nipples u have to aim with
---
Fuck Minnie. Daisy thicc
---
where the glitch at m8
---
Map options are for terrorist hunt not matchmaking
---
It does not reduce knife damage, however i am pretty sure 5 plates are too thick for the knife

Extra THICC !!!

What queen?

quick Tachanka get the duct tape

Mozzie : Beer , food , microwave , let the party begins !

Mozzie : YOU ARE NOT MY MOTHER

Why did y’all make such a terrifying foe, so damn adorable
---
just PASS THOSE PLATES AROUND!
---
Couples playing are goals, good on you!
---
Fun fact- he supports the same AFL team as me.
---
Fair enough.
---
He did fuck Minnie. Donald ducked Daisy.
---
People ban her because having the entire team exposed for several seconds often results in the round being lost very quickly, and nobody likes being on the receiving end of that. Same can be applied to Jackal.
---
And it doesn't make sense
---
Why werent you using the ability?
---
Out of everything you could possibly use for reference, you had to go with her tits.
---
^(I can respect that)
---
For sure, dude. Very well said. I personally have noticed that as I’ve gotten to higher ranks (for my typical range), the vertical play is one of the most influential changes to matches and good roamers really do make or break the match. Especially the Cavs because like you said, just knowing she’s lurking around silently gives the defense a big psychological advantage until she dies.
---
That’s nothing compared to zofias lmg. When you can get 150 bullets that’s something
---
this is the best meme that i have ever seen. well done
---
I was trying to down but my inner god mode activated and i got 3 headshots in a row
---
lil cav is sooo cute
---
This is great😂
---
No that's only for terorist hunt  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
If you use the ability you cant kill even with headshots, only down
---
Unranked: *exists*
---
So why are people testing cav in ranked
---
I’m sorry, I didn’t ask for Bill Nye the fucking Science Guy to enter the chat. I really don’t care about the shitty scientific proof that shows you can change your gender. The idea is, you are a fucking man. Live with it. Giving yourself a vagina means you’re a man with a pussy. Lmfaoo. I don’t think you have realized that i’m just being toxic. Oh, how’s that beard growing for ya?
---
Sounds fake but ok
---
Why don’t mods attempt to regulate artwork, crediting, and reposting
---
Idk man I feel like Vigil’s ability is more selfish than Cavs because at least Cav has the potential to interrogate and give her team that significant intel.
---
Have you ever actually played cav?
---
I don't think i will ever buy bf4, it has too much content and i will have to unlock it while everyone has it. I am hoping they will make a modern bf next, really want to play a game like bf4
---
Her pistol is now more OP than it was BEFORE the nerf
---
Hope you have fun
---
Stop this nonsense!!!
---
I'm level 135 and never gotten a black ice yet
---
That is the precise reason why I don’t play ranked
---
When I run into one of those traps I do label her as a disturber of the peace.
---
The same reason why people think joining rank the minute they hit level 30 after they've played like 2 hours of the game is a good idea
---
The sooner you realize you can be wrong the easier life will be for you. How's that shitty personality working out for ya?
---
You didn’t need to report him.
---
Doc in the back, I LOVE IT
---
&gt;sion as anchor heavily relies on roamers to buy him time bc once attackers are o
---
also I'm not saying he has to hug the bomb. If the coast is clear he can shallow roam and place Gu's around objective, but never in my mind lesion is a deep roamer
---
I went through half a fifth in two matches playing this shit. Not a fun time after.
---
Create another account and upvote again.
---
interrogating is like the best way to get shot through a wall
---
same with clash
---
Nothing makes me laugh more than seeing a Cav kill a downed enemy instead of interrogating
---
&gt; In a 1vs1 you will never be able to get an angle on his heels if the defuser is planted, because he will track your movement. 
---
You're not getting the corner of his shield unless you have a 2nd player to help you.
---
Something to do with China?
---
My favourite thing as Cav is taking a few rapid pot shots at someone round a corner and then bailing, the fear that Cav is waiting round the corner will delay them for at least 30 seconds and depending on the map you can get behind them at that point
---
Not really, plat 3 can queue down to silver 3/4
---
If it's a higher gap than 1000 just play unranked
---
Honestly dude that's really cute
---
All portraits zoomed in abit with ember rise menu layout adjustments
---
Don't know that yet. Haven't done it yet.
---
Generally leaving the camera coverage role to Valkyrie and the droning role to mozzie is a good idea as their gadgets are better suited to their respective roles.
---
To me Echo is best used to survey site or near-site areas, and because he doesn't need to be the one observing his cameras anymore, he can leave it to dead teammates to call out when to deny a plant or delay a push into site. Or if solo q then just check up on them now and again.
---
Uh that's me :D
---
@teilzeitbunt on twitter &amp; Instagram
---
I ain't plat 3 and most of my mates are new to the game so yeah. Although I like playing casual and unranked with them.
---
IM TRYING MY BEST OK
---
Cavs face looks like she smelled a fart.
---
It's a good question!

 A mix of both I suppose. Try to keep them guessing where you are, but don't be too idle so you can keep them anxious. Open a few rotation holes here and there so you have escape and flank routes. Because of Caveira's lacking weapons, it's too risky to engage on someone who expects you and knows where you are. Should be a last resort.
---
Who needs aim when you have bullets
---
just play unranked you cant get kicked
---
Lol Actually I wanted to make her look more like a battle wizard
---
XD I’ll be sure to pass this comment along
---
Thank you!
---
And then when you do get an interrogation, they all run outside and before you know it, you're the last person alive on your team.
---
Alright imma shut me mouth then 😂
---
Imagine the pulse scanner on the gun like in COD:MW II
---
Thanks! But I think this cloth is not bulletproof lol
---
Well due to MMR restrictions they shouldn’t be too far above you should they? I don’t play ranked I don’t know how far above you they are
---
Damn she looks hella cute with that beard. That felt very wrong to say, but you know what idc.
---
Not fit for the Chinese market I guess.
---
TIS BUT A SCRATCH
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
that looks like crypt wtf
---
Before she looked like she was gonna shoot herself now it just looks like she’s hanging herself with fishing line
---
Cringe &lt; fox in name
---
No we dont, last thing Siege multiplayer needs is a dog let alone an NPC component that isn't just a player character AI.
---
Shot an entire magazine on blackbeard's head =  shield broken + 0 to 10hp damage + die right after.
---
Remember when his shield was more durable than Paper? I don't.
---
ok this is adorable
---
Cavs pistol even when not in silent step will always down first,  unless they're doing something like rapelling or they've already been downed. It's really effective for resetting teammates albeit less so now that you only reset to 20
---
I can never even find one lol
---
😍😍😍
---
Isnt the burrito suppressor for maverik?
---
Maybe a small renown booster, or some headgears / uniforms idk
---
Because they are gay
---
What's hacked missed?
---
I was silver 4 last season
---
Till the teamkilling starts.
---
But then again i dont even have those operators along with a brain the size of a nanometer
---
well, obviously you're just salty that he's not gonna get hit by all these people from r/woooosh because he put /s at the end
---
(Sounds stupid ik) I hit it like 3 weeks ago too and well....Congrats man!

Wrong a glock with a carbine on it. The mats what the. P20 roni is.
---
PERVERT!!!!!!
---
Thank you :)
---
She looked bad-ass with the gun :(
---
Thanks!
---
That’s a fact.
---
Promoting violence. In a game where killing is literally everything you do. This world has serious problem.
---
Delet  this it's illegal
---
As a newcomer my self I've felt that Ashe, smoke, IQ, and Rook have been the least complicated and easiest to pick up. 
---
Now take that with a grain of salt as like I said I'm new.
---
That’s not a reason.
---
This isn’t funny anymore
---
There’s a some settings on multipliers in the files that you can change that makes all the sights the same like sensitivity.
---
This guy literally just did though
---
Nice man. Good job
---
Where did you get my console gameplay?
---
I'm not entirely certain whether there are too many items you can buy with that amount, possibly a cheap pistol skin. I know you wont be able to buy a 1 day renown booster as that is priced at 162 R6 credits. 
---
Though you'll be able to afford the 1 R6 credit charm, however I must warn you, you will forever regret it.
---
Interesting. Are the magazines specified as the X-91? Because there's also the X-15 for 5.56 and .300 blackout that are the exact same design
---
fuck
---
I didn't like Ash, but i don't have Smoke and Rook, i will see some videos and see if i like them :)
---
Please no, then it will be bo4 all over again with hackers using dog man and just nonstop spawning dogs
---
I found Finka to be easy when I first started. And her LMG is quite good

Wait a GIRL that plays SIEGE?
---
*Jäģëŕ
---
Ok tachanka
---
lol 😅🤣
---
"I couldnt find it " IS alot better than" i Made it " though
---
Hehe, might wanna rephrase that
---
On my statistic 50% of my total kills are interrogations.
---
Yep ik seydu
---
There are moments when you kind of have to kill the downed person berfore you interrogate, but i agree, if you constantly kill the downed person you aren't very good at Caveira, she's an intel operator, not just an average roaming operator
---
Doesn't work. Experimented with it with whatever I could dig out from the internet. Essentially, 0.016 and 0.023 are the 2 multipliers, one makes it 1:1 for hipfire to acog and the other for hipfire to 1x. But regardless of what number you put, and this is confirmed by ubi, you can NEVER have equal sensitivities unless you have 2 different sliders. There's also a setting with xfactor where making it 1 has some effect, but I tried that and it only speed it up like mad, not doing anything to make the two equal.
---
It’s a bug. It’s happened to me a couple times when 1v1’ng a friend. You’ll have a little respawn animation once prep phase is over and can play normally from there.
---
The time you get disoriented needs to be reduced. Or the time between Yokai blast needs to be increased
---
how do you get the thing by ur name to show what main you are? I'm kinda new to reddit :/
---
Never even noticed this tbh am I that much of a potato to where I dont feel the effect of this
---
Yes
---
oh wow you lost internet points who cares? if you had someone who got banned on your team you lost elo and the people on the other team gain elo so the game doesn’t count 😱
---
It's true dude, F in chat for this loss
---
Lol
---
Nice.
---
then how would you suppose they nerf the gadget?
---
I wish I got that outfit but I didn’t want to waste any money on alpha packs
---
I think Mira is also a valid competitor
---
sad for you
---
Agreed
---
b-but muh purple man reference reee
---
We all know it’s papa chonk, the lawd himself. It’s chanky Kang
---
+1
---
He’s missing the 69
---
That’s toxic, my dad works for Ubisoft and he will ban you 😂
---
It almost did for me yesterday XD
---
Cav as some sort of child eating demon... Oh wait
---
Dogs do nothing wrong 9 times outta 10 people deserve whats coming to them plain and simple
---
accurate considering how much I get shot through my shield
---
Exactly, if your versing a good 4 or 5 stack it could even be impossible to get an interrogation. Doesn't mean your not doing your job.
---
this sub is so fucking cringy sometimes...
---
Obligatory when the Winged Hussars arrived
---
uhhh ok
---
This is like the uno reverse card joke
---
Shut up
---
Ass long ass they have yoga pants... the ass is fine
---
Shut the fuck up
---
thought it was the breakable floor causing this, but she threw it directly at me ;p
---
Ironic.

Well that is surprisingly true

---
tru
---
Haha lvl 150 no bice
---
My friend rarely interrogates people. He’d rather drop several kills than be too focused on interrogations.
---
She's great. Solid gun and her gadget can be a game changer in ranked.
---
Typical low plat 3 i bet
---
If the community wants, sure.
---
his god damn comment...
---
i might be biased here, but you're kinda right. he hasn't gotten any exclusive bundles for a long time, and even though he does have a lot of cosmetics, it's only through GSG9 bundles
---
In the end cavieras job isn't to get an interrogation, it's to get kills, waste time and make the attackers nervous about roaming the map.
---
When I play cav and its the beginning of the round what I'll usually do is kill the first target I find, because doing instantly that puts my team at a numbers advantage.  If I die during an interrogation within the first 45 seconds of a round I've already hindered my team. Once the attackers see cav is running around getting kills it usually make them push slower.
---
Oh and reinforce the damn OBJ, you are a 3 speed after all. You'll have enough time to grab armor and reinforce before you go hide. The attackers still have to run to the building for a few seconds at the beginning of the attack phase. Plenty of time.
---
Yes.
---
k
---
Smol caviera is adorbs
---
I mean, cops in America are shooting dogs all the time so it wouldn't be unrealistic.
---
😳👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
---
u n l e s s
---
Im still suprised how well saran wrap held up, it got shot ~30 times and only 8 penetrated, 5 of which didn't pass the 2 layers on the back side of the shield
---
i liked it
---
lol where did you even get this from
---
German recruit
---
It's supposed to be a r4c, not perfect. But it looks more like r4c then a g36 haha
---
when you unscope you drag your red dot along both walls he CAN see, letting him know you turned away. you even do it multiple times
---
This should have been Blackbeard’s elite gadget skin...
---
Whatever explosion happened knocked his shield to the side just enough to get the shot
---
Wow, this is an original joke!
---
He’d probably still get headshot through it 90% of the time
---
At the same time dont listen to people like this all the time and instantly go for the interrogate, thats how you get killed 
---
And this is obviously aimed more towards silver and low gold but half the time what yall do with a cavi interrogate is get cocky af and go die trying to get a kill
---
It happens a lot to me in console. I’m thinking it’s either 
---
A: Trigger stops for elite
---
B. Using an Elite/Scuff paddle. Very small range of motion/quick reset.
---
C. In combination with trigger stop, you can tune the trigger with the app and make it where you only have to barely pull it.
---
D. Mouse, which is quicker than trigger for the same reason a paddle is.
---
I play Cav because she's an excellent fragger and there are rare situations where I will interrogate because it will get you killed 80% of the time.
---
Yes but that would only tell you where they are at that one point in time it would not give you the real time location on everyone for multiple seconds
---
Getting your phone rung by 5 different Koreans.  Your gf is gonna be so pissed.
---
This is why I main tachanka, your team is happy with you if you get a least one kill
---
Let alone clutching the round
---
It’s not like the was sitting there waiting for the laser to move to peek, he just peeked right when I looked, laser or not he was going to peek when I looked away, even if he does see the laser (which he probably didn’t) he was already going to peek the door
---
Pass those plates around
---
Deep roam - Wait for a good time to flank
---
Shallow - Literally play like Jager.
---
Positioning is key. Locating yourself somewhere good can cause one of 2 things.
---
1. Attackers not realizing where you are, possibly making a mistake and you'll possibly get a kill
---
2. Attackers will not commit too hard and will leave you a lone, possibly switching positions to attack from a different side. Boom you just stopped a push.
---
I like to deep roam either under or above the obj so drones may see my ability being active and it may confuse attackers but i'm actually sneaking behind them \^\^
---
It's only good if he swung on you which he didn't. If you held it where between the door (if that makes sense) it would cover multiple ways he could peek instead of just one.
---
I’m a PC player and It’s not possible to aim and shoot a pistol that fast.
---
So either way it doesn’t make sense
---
Imagine a mode where there can be multiples of one operator. The strats used would be broken.
---
Nice try
---
Those are still shottys
---
*flashbacks of when R6 was a game where invisible IQ had to fight 5 shield glitches at once, with one shield glitch covering the whole body.*
---
This should be her elite skin
---
I don't really like to watch youtubers play to try and learn ops. Unless it's a direct tips guide it's just probably clips of them peaking everything and getting kills that they shouldn't get on regular bases. They make it look easy and i see people try to copy them, it doesn't work... they don't even know that these are just clips and it doesn't happen everything and these youtubers do make mistake and die a lot
---
My only problem with Blackbeard is how often the shield just doesn't work, not as in breaks fast, thats obviously intentional. I mean like when im facing someone, shield on, get headshot by them, didn't even break shield.
---
Was hiding the laser since I had one on for some reason, also I would have had the drop on him had I not looked away, he slow peeked it while crouching
---
I was going to say he flinched due to the explosion.
---
The lighting make's this look like a render
---
Pretty much, for it to work there would need to be some kind of tech in use and not just a simple interrogation
---
What rank are you on?
---
It usually happens in all ranks other than mid plat and above.
---
Jackal is much more annoying as he has no counter other then killing him.
---
It's like Frost's. Steady but slow. I like it but I also main frost. Shotguns are too much fun though, so I always choose that
---
I like Capitao, Finka, Fuze, and ... what’s her name... Gridlock? I like all their LMG’s with ACOG because it zooms but doesn’t seem to zoom near as far as the standard one.
---
They dropped start of grim sky and left start of burnt horizon
---
Would you rather have 5 korean gfs instead of 1? maybe? unless it's like true love and other bs that no ones really believes or gives a care about :3
---
Pull out your pistol, attempt to shoot feet, and swing knife like a serial killer, pray to whatever god you think is applicable
---
G36C to me :/
---
Ahh ok
---
Having a damage reduction 5 times a row roughly divides the damage output of a weapon like the R4C by 4 ± (12.78 instead of 39). Which means it takes four times as much time to kill somebody.
---
Just imagine all TTK would be increased four times. That would make an operator vulnerable to headshots more, wouldn't it?
---
But dogs are loyal and want to server you as best they can
---
It nearly killed her, but the work is done.
---
Tarcov boy on the right
---
Frost answer: Probably your trap, destroy my trap and for that reason our relationship can't be work, we must take separate ways I am so sorry, but we can be friends
---
No, it was a rumour since the new patch. Nothing has changed.
---
When your team is so bad you have to do it yourself
---
The goal isnt to show OP that if he plays Vigil he will immediately play that a pro lol, but instead giving them an idea of how one should love around the map being an elusive roamer like Vigil.
---
I feel like Vigil is a pretty easy op to grasp but hard to master so that's why I feel like a tips video isnt... a good way to learn Vigil? As a vigil just dont rely too heavily on your cloaking because it does still give away your rough positioning when being drowned so use it to reposition and hold or to flank while you have an attacker on edge looking for you. Best way to learn Vigil is to just play him. It isnt like bandit where there are tips you can learn like tricking
---
That's not how this chart works...
---
Its more of a CZ than a glock
---
Dunno that's what i saw in the live chat
---
You right, my bad.
---
If I didn’t realize that any operator that could increase health aka like reviving or even rook players I guess everyone is a healer my apologies all knowing grand smartass
---
Why the tits open tho
---
I thought the China version was only for China, why the fuck are we getting censored?
---
I think the point of me sharing this was so newbies who don’t know how to play cav at all shouldn’t use her in ranked and should practice in casual and t-hunt before going to ranked. 
---
Sorry if this post offended you in any way.
---
Wait, joe? New op...? Is there some inside joke I don't understand?
---
That’s me most of the time because rook forgets to put down his damn armour until the last second.
---
He has the best on paper gun in attack so I don’t know why you play him with shield.
---
&gt;R6 doesnt take any political standpoints
---
Exactly
---
&gt;they arent just gonna add an ISIS member
---
Ofcourse fucking not noone said that
---
&gt;If it existed in a world where all countries are buddy-buddy
---
Noone said all
---
Smooooooth Operatooooooooor
---
no, that game will likely never come out
---
There is no thing on this planet that can make Ela family friendly
---
I actually think blackbeard is in an alright spot right now cause if his shield gets buffed he will be considerd overpowerd and he shield does what its suppose to do, save you from a headshot
---
Didnt offend me, I'm 100% just a casual. I do however feel far too many people take these games too seriously, especially when 1/5 people in team are less experienced/skilled than the rest. It kind of ruins peoples experience in game and ultimately kills their joy of playing it. Happens in all games though really
---
Who needs deployable shields when there are deplorable shields?
---
i’d fk ela
---
Dokk is not a good operator especially when her ability is bugged and doesnt produce any sound so id rather have 5 kappy boi’s as daddies than 5 dokks harassing me with phone calls and text.
---
I just use shield on places like attacking kitchen on coastline because I do most of my clusters alone the shield and smoke grenades make it really easy to stay alive      The AK12 is lovely don’t get me wrong but the PMM is so good using a shield on him isn’t a throw
---
I agreee but there are people like me who take these games competitively so we will get angry. 
---
Thanks
---
I only ever see this happen when I join mid-game as a spectator
---
Nah, Lesions
---
Honestly this is coming from a casual player but I have seen my fair share of Caveira players (and downed attackers) get obliterated trying to go for the interrogation. If it is mad easy pickings then go for it, but a dead roamer is worse than a lost roamer because more often than not a game will come down to numbers.
---
I'm saying why I think black ice is overrated
---
That's exactly what I mean though, you're ruining the fun for new players by telling them they cant play a game, which they bought, because they're not good enough for you.
---
r/whoooosh
---
Exactly, certain countries I agree will be tough to convince people with because of real world conflict but there is a difference between Israel which has strong opposing rhetorics because it is a state that occupies versus say Iran.
---
Iran also has controversy but I think they could theoretically be implemented because noone would take offence to it in the real world. And whether they are an allied country depends on the rainbow universe and not the real one.
---
People who don't speak shouldn't play ranked, period. Someone dies in front of me and I have to figure out where they died from, it's annoying.
---
Dont listen to him, you were fine, it was just bad luck.
---
I would give you plat .But I can't haha.
---
I've started to play just a few months ago. I can only imagine how terrible used to be that time.
---
This clip is old idc lol I just can’t help myself
---
If it work for you good but every time I’m against a fuze with a shield i win the fight because he has no real way to defend himself.
---
No not that I just tell them to pick operators they k ow in ranked and they are free to play anyway they want but don’t expect the team to carry you. 
---
We all have to carry our own wait you see. 
---
Nah, guns won't change the meta unless they're OP.  I want new operators and ideas.
---
Nobody cares about new guns, it's just more shit I have to buy more skins for, more recoil patterns to learn more setups etc.
---
The people who are concerned about no new guns are COD or Borderlands or Battlefield players.  I want a solid core game that functions well without constantly adding new weapons to it to it forcing balances and people saying things like "why would I take X operator when Y operator has a better gun".
---
I mean, good luck to you, but Goyo is a good operator and being able to take the Vector off site without leaving a mirror unguarded is one of the best things in the game right now.
---
Ah yes, Adidas Lord Chanka
---
&gt;released
---
whats lIgMa
---
These aren't accurate quotes. 
---
Simply said that just because there is pakistani-Indian conflict in real life, doesn't mean that Rainbow will refuse to add either of them.
---
That hurt even me
---
Most people do not. Most people don't even know how to google search correctly. People are flat out terrible at googling. 
---
Evidence: It's my job security as a IT guy.
---
Yes, the problem is that the new "draw" system fails a lot (I have lose a lot of rounds with a trade as a defender with no real logic)
---
Imo they should bring back the draw but make them not give any points.
---
Yeah I get that honestly all shields feel so weak without heavy team support now idk just since the ADS change from .4s to .6s it’s so hard to use shields         I can make it work but typically I’d rather my teammates play operators with guns bc shields are in such a bad place
---
Violence, you say?  Have they played the game?
---
flair checks out
---
Uh..6th pick wouldn't make any difference in ranked as it's all 6th picks.
---
What am I missing?
---
In proleague the 6th pick exists because the other team can see all the operators you selected except the 6th pick.
---
Unless you're telling me you're able to see what operators the other team is picking 6th picking would be a a complete and total waste, it would make absolutely no difference whatsover.
---
Noone thinks Hamas is gonna be in the game. OP was talking about very mildly controversial countries such as middle eastern countries in general... like Morocco currently in the game.
---
I guess that’s your opinion but don’t put a label saying all people that want new hubs are cod players you sound like a 30 year old virgin
---
It looked suicidal I’m guessing.
---
Yeah I agree. It’s especially a problem with fuze because if you are in a 1vs1 with blitz then you can rush the opponent, with Monty you can extend his shield to be fully protected but fuze has nothing to help him in this situation, he’s like a recruit.
---
Yep they can just 'update' the maps in a way that is pg and that still would be censor but we would be like either 'I like the map update' or 'I want old Hereford back'
---
They're clearly talking about, at the very least, Israel.
---
You winning because of BB being dbno is correct
---
Seige is tired of your run outs
---
No it would be greysix seige
---
Exactly, even if lets say 2-3 of them are premade, they should still talk to the rest of the team, i play with a friend sometimes 2 and always give info ingame so everyone knows, makes such a huge difference if the rest of the team knows stuff too...
---
In For Honor, the Halloween event will be released in 10 days from today. I know, is not the same game, but is the same company. Just to compare.
---
and i meant not going 4-5 for kills to death since you have a .8 kd lol
---
dumb argument, its like saying "if you cant drive you shouldn't do your driving lessons"
---
Gridlock and capitao works really well to help your team get the plant and defend it.
---
Im just saying u have to play to get good so ur point makes no sense inles ur talking about ranked
---
I'd friendly fire for that amount
---
Elite skin?
---
# OUR GAME ENGINE DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT
---
Its only a 1000 difference in mmr.
---
Funny meme tho
---
anyone can actually. it's called not sprinting everywhere at all times. cav is a gimmick at best. Cav is not a threat and a liability to the team. it's sad you thought I was exaggeratong and I'm sorry you felt as if I was talking down to you. but you really are pretty low of you main cav so Ig it's not that big of a deal :)
---
Thanks man going in now :)
---
Play the game and use booster if you can/want.
---
Kapkan only has 5 traps
---
I was talking about ranked. 
---
I play like a retard in casual so I don’t expect anyone to sweat in casual but when they play like trash in ranked it makes me sad and angry.
---
Just wait for a huge patch with "no player facing changes", the week afterwards should be the event.
---
It’s internet, don’t be reasonable and DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER

No it's not. It's basically agressive monetization strategy fueled by addicition and micro rewards, that are based on reward stimulation. Nothing great about it in general and even less if you take into account that target audience of R6Siege are minors.
---
He also thicc
---
Happy cake day hitler
---
We need a gamemode where everyone can play whoever they want even if someone else is playing the same operator
---
Microphones will help but the thing you got to think about on console there's little to no communication. Everyone is in their parties and hardly communicates. If you tell your friend hey open this wall for me and mark a ping the random on your team might think," Oh he wants that wall barricaded" and closes that wall off. Either you let him close the wall or you have to kill him. This will remedy this issue. 
---
As to the fluidity, that's just muscle memory, after a couple of hours you be like, ping button left, ping button right" etc. It'll become second nature just like pinging works now.
---
But I am inevitable
---
He dummy thicc
---
Talk about their current ranks, not their old ones...Kinda dishonest.
---
What was your team made of?
---
Ironically the one furry in our group didn't get the outfit but our friend did
---
Now you're just making assumptions that I main cav and are insulting me without even listening what I'm saying.
---
Grow up, dude.
---
If you want to discuss it, i'm down. But you're just being irrational if you go as far as to say she is a liability.
---
Cool
---
Maybe it’s been there forever, I just didn’t really notice it til now
---
Damn. That was cold.
---
Yeah but I'm thinking it could be one time use

&gt; This will remedy this issue. 
---
And create more.

&gt;As to the fluidity, that's just muscle memory, after a couple of hours you be like, ping button left, ping button right" etc. It'll become second nature just like pinging works now.

Hmmm this seems like it would be decently balanced depending on their weapon options

T Hunt classic with 2 or more friends gives a smidge over 100 renown per game with no booster, but remember that you can't finish in less than a minute or you get nothing (which is really only an issue if you're playing House)

No but it's far better than taking a picture with a phone...

Would be abused as unranked players can join any party.
---
Good, you deserved that for running out there.
---
as for revealing enemy location. try making callouts lmao. literally everyone on defense has access to callouts. not to mention you have to expose yourself in order to do it. you're not good if you get interros because it's their fault for letting it happen. a decent player doesn-t get interroed.
---
Yeah same issue happens on PC. Not everyone has a microphone and even if they do they don't speak either because they're shy or they don't speak English very well.
---
Why play unranked when casual is a thing
---
Time to make an second account
---
It could be that they only have a pistol and they pick up the operator they "hijack"
---
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED
---
Wouldn't that be a fun game mode? Multiple people can choose the same op. Imagine 5 ash players rushing in. Imagine 5 Bliz rushing in.
---
By attacker gadgets do you also mean ability gadgets?
---
If so, would it be an attack or defense?
---
Thirdly, could I pick up Monty’s shield?
---
EDDDD montedted
---
Level 104 (I think) I got two black ice but not on the guns that I wanted, sadly :(
---
Which is a different issue
---
Also add Mira's Vector in a little slit on the front.
---
Hey! What platform do you play Siege on? What clearance level are you? We are looking into recent reports of longer queue times after the recent update.
---
I don’t know if I should take this typo seriously or with the intention of a joke
---
We didn't want to spawnkill, we tried to go onto the rooftop
---
Those bars were added sneakily in Ember Rise, like when the past season they changed a bit the pillar of the bed im bedroom.
---
imagine 5 jackals
---
Ahhhh I remember this bug, spectators could see it as if he was pulsing. Gave my friends the easiest wallbang callouts.
---
Don’t need anymore renown at that point
---
Maybe have the MMR lock enabled since the game is likely already calculateing MMR after each placement match anyway.
---
Tired, drunk, and dead too.
---
Those randos can become part of your trusted squad, its exactly the way you say though, if you don't get along find new teammates
---
Nobody thicker than IQ
---
6th pick exists not because the enemy can see your ops. 6th pick exists as a means to shuffle your strat.
---
6th pick exists to shuffle your strat and confuse the enemy. You can stick to the same op, but change the loadout and release all question marks to the enemy, making them change their ops. You can change the op to change the strat completely, like switching off a twitch to a thatcher make mute less of an appealing pick. The same can be done vice versa, like picking warden for blue stairs defense instead of say....Ela, as a 6th pick.
---
Essentially, to confuse the enemy team. It doesn't make sense to add it without reveal phase.
---
Well, they nerfed shields into the ground because of him...being a giant drone is all he can do.
---
Yep. Now if only we had a way to resolve this issue...
---
I really like this!
---
Would love to see your renditions of some other ops like Nokk and Caveira if you ever feel like doing more.
---
Iv seen this happen to a few people a few times did you just not select anyone or did you do something special?
---
It would have to be a good pistol and the only problem I see is shields and ops that have a gadget tied to their weapon like glaz buck and nomad
---
To true my guy
---
I mean for example you could pick up Blackbeard's gun shield or put on jackals visor. Defense. And yes it's his main ability. But you could only use it once for that round
---
It’s a typo. I don’t want to take it down and re-upload just so I don’t get marked as a spammer.
---
True, I see how this would likely break the ranking system more than anything.
---
“Gone reduced to atoms”
---
PC players are so ignorant when it comes to this, I probably have better aim with a controller than most plat3’s aim on PC, I play both PC and console and the plat 3/2’s on PC are dumbfucks compared to the people on console I play with, the only difference between the two is the aiming
---
My guy
---
now she’s just sad :(
---
You done got sieged
---
Love it dude, keep up the amazing work!
---
Yeah, I'd frick it
---
Twitch mains: "Mozzie that fookin wanker has ruined our lives again!"
---
That's because you're not watching it the Japanese way /s
---
Great work, when can we be expecting a Thermite?
---
Which is the exact topic we are discussing. Movement and aiming are different on the two platforms. Sitting in a position like that on PC equates to a free kill.
---
"I wonder if this gun is drop safe..."
---
You look handsome dude!
---
Do you mean lower? A higher ping is worse
---
Pretty sure you mean lower ping since higher ping means more lag
---
Wait what? You want to lag even more?
---
yes i meant lower
---
yes i mean tlower sorry
---
yes i meant lower sorry
---
She got tired of holding her hand up
---
You want your ping to be as low as possible. Get an Ethernet cable instead of wireless.
---
apparently this was my friend’s drone lol
---
protect my defused dad

---
I have no fucking idea who that is
---
Yeah I agree
---
Try to go to cable and not wifi. Look what server you are playing on it’s most likely the problem.
---
That happened to me too. But I'm talking about doing that as a 5 stack, as in pretty sure they were all queded up from the start (They said so in-game, and got exactly the same guys twice) 
---
Funny enough, they got salty af when I mentioned the rank disparities in all chat. I did it the same way I did here, so I doubt the way I said it was the cause of that.
---
As a reminder I'm still kind of new to ranked, and I'm still trying to understand how all of this works. Is this a normal thing, then?
---
Thank you for understanding
---
ok thankyou
---
Not a fan of the choice of music, but I hope you reach your goal.
---
A fellow fuze main, not sure in how to get the title but hey I’m new here
---
Stop acting like marly
---
oh ok. the thing is im moving house soon and cant really be bothered cabling if im gonna have to remove it, ill check which server im on
---
Yeah it happen quite often. The probable explanation is they put you and your team with the first squad ( and closer to you ) available.
---
rook next
---
Permission to use this absolute masterpiece as my DP?
---
Im not good at the game but i tried ok
---

Interesting song choice
---
this was the games leading up to plat 1, I've already reached it
---
Stop trying to flex when your probably a bronze . No one gives a fuck that you can waste your money
---
Goyo.
---
Oh congratulations!
---
The black ice skins tho. Honestly good bad play though
---
Nah
---
I keep on seeing cav as having really long legs because of the yellow stripe by her waist
---
Had this happen once it’s actually beautiful
---
lesion is definitely not an anchor wdym fam.
---
That’s sick!
---
Its worst than that! its the only skin deemed COOL and that hasn’t changed since the first DLC.
---
Ah. I find a good old fashioned toxic strat (fuzing, echoing, ECT), or a good ol LMG rush is a good counter
---
She stupid thicc
---
first seasons was the BEST! experience
---
Yes. It looks more realistic now
---
forgive me lord but im unfunny
---
This gives me anxiety
---
it comes in phases (some for a few months ill be really into it and playing a lot and get good, but then fall off the next few months etc) but id say by 100 you should have enough experience to basically have seen it all.
---
nooo
---
Plat 3
---
Interrogations at any time are amazing. Full IDs on every attacker and wall hacks for 10 seconds are amazing. Sure, like you said, you can just hang out for 10 seconds and the go somewhere else, but now you just completely wasted 10 seconds, and the defenders have a general idea of where you'll be coming from. A lot of the power of an interrogation comes from the attackers simply waiting
---
Give him the super shorty
---
No, they're just as bad at aiming as you
---
Or the SMG-12
---
I think i played once with u. Name is familiar i am Dynamite863
---
Get the 3 basic ops first, since theyre cheap, then alibi, clash, goyo and warden as last

BAD GRAMMAR!!!?👅
---
Take my up vote. I started last season at Silver II and this was my story the rest of the season.
---
I know that feel :(
---
Can't blame him, this is how console works.
---
Only the luison downs consistently. The spas and the m12 are like any other weapon
---
This is quite an old spot.
---
Wait.. that's illegal
---
Yes I can, I'm in console and my aim isn't this horrendous. .
---
Mfw the obvious Terminator reference flies straight over people's heads.
---
Makes sense. Now that I’m thinking about it, there was definitely a vaguely Tarantino like vibe back in the day
---
Everything is what you call "horrendous" since I'm a high rank pc player, can't blame a console player imo.
---
... recruit was actually the terminator? It would explain the exact copies of him, but what is his motive? What does he want??
---
Nomad elite
---
The whole games story is that it is a “virtual reality training simulator”. That’s why they all look like that, it’s not an actual terrorist Vs counter-terrorist. But just because you have a tactical realism mode, it’s not going to change how everyone looks. It’s more on how realistic your hud looks.
---
So an operator like Blackbeard who is a recruit with a sheet of paper is ok to use, but an operator that is good but gets banned and when not banned no one uses but using her requires skill. K
---
Flesh buds in JoJo
---
Press alt + print screen next time
---
Add clash taser and you have a weapon to combat the elder cosmic gods
---
trucktober
---
No, it’s in your HUD settings. You can enable and disable them all mid game. The only option you don’t have the option of is the ammo mechanic from tactical realism.
---
You would be surprised, outlines don’t help at all and only hinder you at higher level play. You should be able to differentiate between ops by appearance and not needing to know if it’s an attacker or defender. I still have icons on so I know that there is this operator over there, but not his outline or what his in game name is. An outline isn’t going to save you from TKing if you’re startled and surprised. It will however stop you from thinking an enemy is a teammate if they just happen to line up with the outline. 
---
Points on or off is up to you but I play games like Tarkov, insurgency, etc where you don’t get told when you get the kill. You need to confirm it. If you rely on points then you only hold yourself back. You listen for sound queues when you down someone, you listen for sound queues when bandit tricking or throwing nades. You’ll listen to audio queues when your lesion trap goes off or you mozzie pest gets a drone as well as operator voice lines. Also, I’ve gotten in countless gun fights where I spotted the objective and got +50 and I stopped shooting because I thought I got the down. Which is infuriating. 
---
Like I mentioned, coming from playing a lot of Tarkov to siege it’s nothing. Points aren’t needed although I could see arguments and people just sometimes want points. But teammate outlines and names will force you to have better team play and comms as well as you won’t be handicapped by prompts and info that you may not get if they decide to make ranked rules Mirror competitive play. Not to mention if every time you get a point notification you take your eyes away from somewhere you could be looking for an enemy or from your crosshair. 
---
Just my thoughts on hud settings.
---
Everything is good except Amaru.
---
Amaru is not good, but she is fun.
---
Cursed Monty
---
Yes it is
---
I play how I play. As long as I get the kill don't matter😁
---
A good cav won't mindlessly go for interros tho as they know it could be a risky position.  Better to have the threat of a living cav, than a dead cav and no interro, or an interro for a few seconds and a dead cav.
---
WhO knEw cAv wAs thIcc
---
Will do 👍
---
Is middle Alibi? pretty good cosplay tho
---
I feel that on a personal level
---
Thank you so much!
---
Yes middle is myself as pro skin alibi! Sadly I wasn't able to make it perfect, couldn't find a good set of goggles for the costume and the original beret kind of got destroyed. Also couldn't find a good set of combat boots that didn't cost most of my rent so I just wore my steel toes.
---
Both are super fun to play, nomad is more tactical however so just depends
---
All costumes handmade by the Cav.

The “Ah yes we want to die because we don’t have a bandit, mute, or kaid.” Cosplay

We need an alibi elite, bro. And also, congrats to the cav for handmaking them all herself. Imagine what she could do as part of a team, and with fully paid for resources. She should look into costume design as a career choice.

Lol all tine

Zofia elite.

Someday they'll figure out how to fix Goyo on hostage.

wtf...
---
this feels... blursed
---
You can't do that
---
You passed me the curse bruh . I've been in a ranked queue for a total of 25 mins now 🤣
---
I sometimes initiate a vote kick if I just want a player to get off their ass. I don’t actually wanna kick them but like if the defuser is down and they’re across the map hiding in a corner, it’s my way of saying ,”Hey get a move on asshole.”
---
I know they won’t clutch and that’s ok but I mean you could give it a try.
---
What happened?
