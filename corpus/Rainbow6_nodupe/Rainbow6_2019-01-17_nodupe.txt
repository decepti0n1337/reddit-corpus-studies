- Pick site on defense

- Pick spawn on attack

- Opt out of playing unranked maps (Favela, House, Tower...)

Wow look at that, now casual is worth playing.

Either I’m tired of arguing this just google electric blow torches lol.

Vigil is one of the stronger defenders. his guns (K1a and SMG-12 or CZ) are low recoil and good overall damage. his ability is like that to no make him over powered. his ability  has such a big radius that it is hard to pin point were he is IE different floor, different location in a room or hall. he is balanced as he is 
---
Damn... man, you sound like you know much stuff
---
I must upvote so I can feel I'm better than the average player on here
---
I think a counter that makes sense is ops like Cav and Vigil can’t be detected when they are using their abilities.
---
Hey Neel 
---
Lies, how many times have you died to a cav 1 shotting you hiding in a dumb corner? She’s annoying at close range, this patch makes it so the attacker has a chance to kill her

There is no direct counter for maverick but he is EXTREMELY exposed when using his gadget. I understand that you can’t bandit trick or anything but there still other strats you can do to counter the push in chalet like holding with a Mira for example. Personally I think he is in a good position right now
---
in this case ‘proper hands’ means anyone capable of aiming at at enemy, blackbeard is not dead
---
Ah, yes. ["The lowest level of hell"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/aghkuc/caveiras_luison_changes_contextualized/)
---
Plat but okay. Shes not op but shes annoying like 99 damage is ridiculous ik its just a down but its a easy kill ive took out a whole squad in seconds its a bit silly. I think its a fair nerf and she had it coming
---
HOW COULD ANYBODY MISS THAT /s
---
Call me crazy, but I think this is a motherfucking JoJo reference
---
Yes. Everyone has as a matter of fact. 
---
Wish this game has some sort of charm or skin given through ubiclub to those who are veterans like in CS:GO.
---
The thing with castle is he is really good at high levels of play (when used right) but is terrible at low levels of play when no one knows how to use him. It’s difficult to find a buff for castle without making him way too over powered at high levels of play
---
Hi Donovan 
---
Yup! some randoms in a casual game showed me this a few months back
---
This. The dmg was so high on her pistol it took almost all skill out of it. Guys would just spam the trigger and odds are one shot was going to land in close quarters which would win every single gunfight.
---
I completely thought that large frame was Cav 
---
Uhhhh idk I never noticed before haha whoops
---
It teaches you to be more careful, that's how I learned too. Now you know you need to check windows and doorways while leaving spawn. Place claymores below windows if you want to rappel. Test the waters by fake-rappelling. Leave your setup phase drone looking at the spawnpeek they did last round, now you'll know if someone is trying to peek from there.
---
But where do I get my quality art if Shadman dies?
---
Yeah it's a nerf but the damage drop off is gonna be like other pistols instead of dropping off my the meter
---
This just sorta feels like you are adding a casual+ to the game. I fall into the competitive ranked category and I only play bomb as it is. Besides creating an additional mmr system to track, it feels like you are creating a ranked game mode that casual trolls will go to piss off some what serious players just because they won’t care about their “classic” rank.
---
Damn really? So I’m literally the only one in the entire siege player base who has never noticed? Dang. 
---
waht the fuck
---
&gt; Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo
---
So we can't talk about that 2nd picture ?
---
Thanks!
---
Sounds like theyre not real friends.
---
Jokes aside, i have to agree. Its not terribly hard to write some spy novel, or zombie book. But 1984 was such a different style, setting, and idea. Something so, possible at that.
---
I do fear an orwellian future aswell, seeing them removing confederate statues in New Orleans. Censoring history doesnt mean it didnt happen. 
---
I could really go on and on about the book and my thoughts. But im not gonna create a wall of text. I fucking love the book. One of the few required readings I enjoyed back in highschool.
---
3D printing is really cool. I printed tachanka’s helmet in my pre-engineering class
---
They could just be smart and make mute and vigil hard counters for him that when his gadget activates it doesn't see them as they have devices on them to prevent it. You could even make up some bullshit about how mute saw vigil utilizing his cloaking ability and adapted one of his jammers to be portable on him at all times and it could be a nice buff to mute in that he has passive jamming around his location at all times. 
---
Let me rephrase. The only players that count have noticed. 
---
Attacking game servers is nothing new, it was happenining in COD years ago. 
---
I’ve never understood why a game was forgiving on its players like this. Like the way you describe, a team- or individual killing a team mate. Why is rainbow or any other game for that sake, so forgiven to this. I know they shouldn’t perm ban people for it, but theoretically, why not take it to the extremes?
---
Here I envy the watch thingy system of CS:GO, where people of certain playtime, rank and behavior can judge others. If you’re deemed unfit for a game, ban them for an extended period (Like 10 days).
---
Make ban times on team killing extremely high and implement it for casual as well. Make a forgive option as you mention, and make a repeat ‘temp’ ban. So if you kill, let’s say 10 people within a week or the ‘watch thingy’ players deem you unfit, you’ll get banned for 10-15 days.
---
For multiple occasions, a perm ban is issued, like repeated temp bans.
---
For throws you should be able to report here, again to the watch thingy panel. They can easily spot if the other players are standing still or not shooting, and when it’s simply a bad player or a player off his game, trying to play.
---
Haha nice! I must have just drowned it out every time and never really listened.
---
Off*
---
Lmao. You really got me there pal!
---
yeah its real, i think like the first one was on gameboy color. i almost got it like a year after it came out but my gameboy died after i dropped it onto a parking garage floor. good times
---
Oof. Ubisoft community soft capped my post....
---
Yes, very good idea, thank you.
---
Well for an individual it makes sense. But if you implement it as a game mode you could end up in situations where you have no hard breach and the op for has closed the site completely.
---
I agree. It wasn’t even a required reading for me, at least not technically, as I chose it for a book review in 8th grade.
---
But yeah, it’s pretty difficult to listen to these people talk about how the absolute snore of a book that was The Book Thief was well written while 1984 was shit. WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD FAMILY
---
I like killing with it, realistically nobody expects to be killed by it. Should rename it to "Inquisition".
---
Well brb imma go play it
---
Wish people would understand that when I tell him. People hate him for keeping them out of certain areas, or my favorite, his gun. 
---
But adds to the thrill.
---
[Not even much of a nerf](http://reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/aghkuc/caveiras_luison_changes_contextualized/)
---
So add an extra button for a feature that’s already in game?
---
I'd say the 590 is certainly capable of this. What operator were you playing? Did you have Rook armour or a Finka boost active?
---
I understand this point but if this were the case, why give her the LMG? It has such higher ammo and dmg plus the ability makes it OP
---
I don't even know what we'd call my religion but sure I'm happy to get a follower
---
It’s as if you have to manage distance of weapon sights so the shot remains true 
---
Yeah HOPE
---
Default. Give it a go and you will see what I mean. Using the extended barrel when watching kill cams I would say 50% of the time you will see it giving you away.
---
y risk interrogations ubi be like
---
Since when did the wallpaper update?
---
Ok
---
You don't need to sneak if they are far away because they wont hear you in the first place???
---
Its pretty evident that this is a rework, and not a nerf, and I agree with your points but the whole point is to get fast downs and quick interrogations.
---
If you spend your time running to get someone whos downed while they are screaming "INTERROGATION!" into their mic, chances are you will run into an enemy or two.
---
I refuse to use that shotgun, I know it's stupidly over powered but I do really good with the SMG. But to be honest, it really comes down to preference, I just prefer the SMG rather than the shotgun.
---
Can't be any worse than what they did to blackbeard. Too bad he's still viable and deadly in the right hands kek
---
You dont have time to run far out to someone you downed before they get revived.
---
Lmao that should be a game mode. Everyone starts at 5 health and first one to down the other with a c4 wins. Kinda like dodgeball
---
How do you get this camo?
---
Glacier is beautiful, but it doesn't get love because it isn't available anymore and few have it
---
&gt;thanks for the tip!
---
Np.  Compensator allows her to have a fighting chance at mid range.  Reflex sight is better than Holo for her gun because it’s more zoomed out.  The more zoomed out, the better the recoil will feel, since it’s farther away from the barrel.  
---
It has the same recoil, you just experience less of it because your sight is more zoomed out.
---
The vert grip on her gun is a monster, so you can pull it out almost instantaneously after sprinting and spray people down.
---
I freakin hate blackbeard because I suck at aiming tbh
---
That's what he is saying. If you are in a long range fight, you are better off killing the attacker cause by the time you down them, run up to the body and try to finish the intro. They will have backup.
---
This would prevent him from using it at all????

Mira essentially has wall hacks and is broken.

Jäger straight up stops grenades and is broken.

Echo can concuss people without risk.

Doc can revive himself and others from DBO with the press of a button.
---
Cav can two shot anyone then get the enemy teams location.
---
Buck gets a shotgun and an AR/DMR?!
---
IQ can wall hack electronics.
---
You know when lion came out, from his description I was pretty certain he was going to be an operator focused on stopping run outs and enemy rotations. that wouldn't be a bad way of reworking him, giving him that focus on controling the outside of the building. Of course tower kinda puts a spanner in that idea, but still. 
---
Could be used either way.
---
yep thats why i wanna collect them. theres 10 in the set so i wouldnt mind spending $100 over time versus the probably $200-$300 for the entire chibi collection
---
While it's not 99dmg she was still pretty high dmg at around 10m which is sneak range
---
I'd love to take you up on that but I'm on Xbox. If I ever get used to PS4 controls with shooting and buy Siege for it I'll let you know.
---
Noice 
---
Lion has a 100% ban rate in Pro League for a reason.
---
The absolute last thing he needs is a buff.
---
I feel the same, but I feel like maverick is significantly less powerful than lion. Maverick you have to drone someone out, then go to the wall, then go blow torch the wall without getting flanked, then hope that the other player doesn’t hear you/is occupied with something else, then kill them.
---
Some places though he’s dummy op, I.e border 2nd floor. Open that shit up so easily and all the attackers have to do is watch the security room flank while someone plants in the site while someone watches over them through the maverick hole.
---
Agreed.
---
It's completely normal. Like the others said, you could just play some terrorist hunt or casual to warm up.
---
But sometimes there are days you just aren't feeling it per say. I know how you feel, just be patient or take a quick break.
---
Yeah thats my point
---
Agreed. I already have a DC and Marvel POPs collection, Siege must join. 
---
Its bullshit
---
Shame I live in Ireland. I'm a massive charm collector and own almost all charms except for the Paris major, fan girl and the fan boy charm. Recently got the gamer girl charm from a weird app that was being used during a Korean gaming event. Hopefully therell be more ways to obtain them in the near future. 
---
Yes i did lol. If you pay attention to what you hear in game you can hear mav's blowtorch and shoot him
---
So I’ll sit here while you try to explain how an electronic signal jammer (mute) makes any more sense. Don’t worry I’ll wait. 
---
Lmao too bad he wasn’t able to find a way to make the pack glow bright orange when it opened. 
---
*did
---
You don't have to interrogate every enemy you down, I'm saying that this patch her pistol is more viable at ranges, which I think opens up more kill potential with her pistol, including the Nerf's and the range buff 
---
No sadly
---
He's *supposed* to be strong. He's supposed to have a minor advantage in face to face gun fights, because he offers very little to his own team's tactics or to hindering the defending team's tactics.
---
If he was balanced in direct combat, the only thing separating him from other attackers would be his unique uselessness in every other aspect of gameplay. If he was balanced in combat he might become the worst attacker in the game.
---
Maybe he could be improved with slight tweaking but there are far more important balance issues in Siege than Blackbeard...
---
No
---
\&gt; Maybe they could **only** make it destructible **while the drone is scanning**? (when Lions using his ability) 
---
How is this not clear? Agreed, Lion needs a bit of a rework.
---
Not complaining about cav nerf but why do operators get nerfed so damn hard
---
Rework Blackbeard entirely. Every operator gets their own funny little ability with varying usefulness. Blackbeard on the other hand, his gimmick is winning 1v1s. In a game based on headshotting the enemies, how could you have a character that can't be headshot?
---
Not sure what exactly I'd do to him, but the rifle shield is completely broken in my opinion, it needs to change.
---
bought it with r6 credits during operation black ice
---
&gt;he is more of an achor
---
You’re not really helping Ela’s case.  An operator that’s more geared towards anchoring is still better than her at roaming.
---
&gt;ability is kind of shit in my opinion
---
Her ability is much better, trust me, especially in Ranked where people shoot down windows rather than punching.  You can effectively block an entrance with a Prisma, whereas the effects of a Grzmot are pretty negligable
---
u/dragon_dude1 has got to be trolling, copper, or both. No way anyone is dense enough to not see how forcing roamers to stand still is suicide against a coordinated team.
---
Thanks! Too bad they are to money hungry to add it...
---
Was about to comment on your ela post but I realized it was you lol but I also second your post. Thanks again and ima try her out again tonight when I hop on 
---
That's fair. With his shield now at the HP its been nerfed to, he's a sort of "high risk, high reward" player. He's pretty sluggish and once his shield is popped off in a firefight he's sort of a sitting duck if he's in the open. Luckily his shield still allows him to win firefights if you trade headshots because your shield will eat the enemies headshot. 
---
I'm a blackbeard main, I absolutely adore playing him. And it pisses people off because you can be aggressive from long ranges or on windows with his shield. 
---
You dont have to interrogate everybody you down si my point, and the Luison is made to down. With that time they can crawl away to safety / a teammate
---
No, he can still use it.  It wouldn’t be a one shot.  Maybe like 5 or 10 bullets.  He can still use it, he just can’t abuse it
---
So that’s how people got this beautiful camo. Definitely one of my favorites 
---
It is, that's why you need actual skill to play this game, and no, I'm not copper but thanks
---
&gt;ima try her out again tonight when I hop on
---
Gl
---
Yup, it cost them nothing. Doesnt take up their time or money.
---
I found it amusing that Dokkaebi and Vigil are speaking in Japanese
---
FUZE
---
You realise if you shoot them again with the pistol while they are downed it kills them right? 
---
This Lesion and Ash is rank Wood 8
---
Bro. Get out now. This game and I have a love hate relationship. Just keep grinding. You'll find people that are down to run. In the mean time... do the t. Hunts and learn. Also write their names down because payback is a bitch when you get your own thing going. 
---
Blackbeard shouldn't be on that list.
---
Did you really just compare the cav nerf to lion AND blackbeard? Blackbeard may have been nerfed but hes still a stupid operator. His entire ability is complete bullshit OP
---
for realz blackbeard is just annoying to deal with, I dont find his weapon op I just find his shields annoying but hey thats his gadget
---
&gt;a 1v4 is when you are the only one alive, and 4 enemy are still alive
---
Just read the above and apply comprehension. Its really not that hard.
---
Dedication and practice and you’ll get better. 
---
And trust me you’ll know the difference 
---
Sure, she has arguably the best shotgun in the game, but that’s all she’s got going for her, really.  Her secondary is subpar at best, her gadget is the worst of the 3 roamers I mentioned(Alibi, Jager, Vigil) and on top of that she doesn’t have Impacts, which Vigil and Alibi both have
---
I don't see why Cav is getting the nerf. Her 99 damage pistol only excels in close quarters because of its damage drop off and if your that close to Cav that you can't fight back it's your fault for going alone so nobody is there to have your back.
---
As a Cav main I tell people all the time who complain about Cav being overpowered that the best counter to Cav is to not go alone. Cav preys on stupidity most of all. It's a lot harder to get the jump on a group of people over one person. 
---
There is a reason she isn't effective at high level play, and just because people don't know how to deal with Cav doesn't mean she needs a nerf.
---
That's my rant, although I am somewhat bias as a Cav main 
---
oh that explains it didnt know
---
Yeah, but 
---
1. They might get downed behidn cover, like a table costing you time to run to and or interrogate.
---
2. Why do that when you can kill them easier with an SMG?
---
🥳 The wonders of technology! Woohoo! 🥳
---
Soo he places Gu, then walks for 1 second, then his Gu activates, he doesnt notice, then someone steps IN FRONT OF HIM and gently pulls out that needle, and both are fine with this ? Talk about situational awareness lul
---
That was your closest shot. The rest were of target and the final shots were into her backpack, not part of her hitbox
---
Heck, many people didn't even know that his shield could break back then.
---
Yeah man give Blackbeard his 800hp shield back why you're at it.
---
As much as we hate hacking scumbags. Reddit is gonna take down the post for “naming and shaming” sorry bud.
---
I see. 
---
Uhhh do you not see her constantly in PL and shit? I'm an Ash/IQ man depending on the situation, I can confidently say she's fine as she is. 
---
Yes cav's pistol is getting nerfed, but her damage drop off is being aligned with other pistols, so it will do more damage at range. I hate doing no damage at range. Still think the 15 to 12 is not needed, increase recoil is not needed. 
---
Really? I don't seem to have an issue...
---
"Give back ACOG"
---
laughed too hard at this
---
You shouldn’t be able to entirely disable someone’s ability without even seeing the operator, that’s retarded.
---
they way he moves, kills one teammate, positions back and leaves the game LMAO
---
$4 is hard to come by these days 
---
And yet when I play him it seems like it only takes 1 9mm bullet to shatter it and kill me
---
Oh if you play on console then it's probably different due to control layouts and such, my experience is on PC where pretty much everyone lean and crouch spams.
---
If it's a 1v5 with over a minute left the guy probably should be on his drone. They're gonna need that intel. 
---
I would increase the initial time it takes to start burning, but keep consecutive burning the same

r/unexpectedjojo
---
Well thank you for the kind response.  
---
I guess I can understand that shotguns are for map clearing/modifying- but even then... It just feels like... I don't know... like... are you **SURE** you don't want to just take a rifle instead? It feels like a mistake to ever use a shotgun for map-setup-purposes, especially if you're queuing ranked/casual as solo or duo. You're essentially going to neuter your ability to be an extremely effective fighter *(multi-scenario)*, just so you *(or you and your friend)* can have some play lined up in your head, where only a shotgun can make it possible.  
---
I totally understand the aspect of simply 'getting good' with a shotgun, and forcing the enemy to peek you or come to you- but that just feels like intentionally making the game harder to play in general. An SMG or rifle is as deadly as a shotgun at close range (from my experience). This comes down to ADS speeds VS hipshot of course- but the time to kill is nearly the same in both shotgun or rifle... and in Shotgun range- TTK is instant. Regardless of what weapon you have.
---
How does one play with mouse and keyboard on console?
---
Back when he was first released and toxic mofos didn’t get him before me and they’d try to shoot the drone out of the sky lol. Happened twice to me. Idk if they thought they could break it that way but it was funny atm
---
What Rank is this....
---
You shouldn't vote to kick someone for being bad either? What sort of shitty attitude is that. 
---
Casual
---
No one wants them back to their broken state, but what Ela and BB had done to them was too much. 
---
Casual ends at 3 and it doesn't say match point.
---
Definitely cheats you cam see him tracking heads from inside to outside Oregon very easily on multiple occasions. Cheats or those were 1 in a millions plays, but the whole reel was full of em. 
---
What’s the next operator I should make?
---
Use those two 5 second scans with a 20 second delay wisely? Your thinking is bizarre to me. People would run out as soon as the round starts and lay into it, running out is not that much of a risk and it would be insanely retarded to be able to disable an operator’s ability before even seeing them/before it can be used to any effect.
---
Most semi-auto shotguns are shit these days because they used to be very strong and were nerfed. The semi-autos though are very strong and the British shotgun is almost always played at high level on either mute or smoke these days. It is insanely strong in close range, I'll try to get you pro league shotgun plays, but if you watch some pros play you'll see how they position themselves and how strong shotguns can be.
---
You can't just up ban and just assume people have a static IP you could hardware ban but that's it
---
Not true at all. That's the current damage drop. It will take the same amount of shots to kill at a longer range than before.
---
Wow... That is sad.
---
I would've honestly spoked up. 
---
i wouldn't advise running a pistol/shotgun set up IMO
---

Sledge, but with a rocket powered hammer for hard breaching on the go.
---
honestly though. what do you think posting this would accomplish 
---
Yep, 4 mines. Don't forget, her mines still aren't exactly easy/cheap to counter. Even if you drone out the mine location, if the Ela isn't bad your only options are using an emp, explosive, or somehow killing it from above/below if the option even exists. Which for her current state, I'm willing to accept. But when she was also multiple notches above the previously best defense fraggers with it? No thanks.
---
depends.

You shouldn't vote to kick someone for being bad at a game.

Especially in casual. If you want to be paired with players who are ostensibly as good as you are, play ranked.

You’re beating a dead and decayed horse. The amount of posts addressing this is absolutely ridiculous. We’ve all experienced it and we’re all playing the same game. We all get annoyed by it but the difference is some of us realize the devs are well aware of the problem. So instead of complaining and saturating the sub with bitching we wait for them to work on it. They literally have a button for reporting toxic behavior. 
---
Look. I love a bit of banter but let's not take it the wrong way arite? 
---
You should also make a canister to put this thing in, so it doesn't break when you bring it back home.
---
And I'm sure your teacher will be interested in your project.
---
You: "I know what you are wondering."
---
Teacher: "What's in the canister?"
---
You: "I could tell ya, but then you'll have to give A+."
---
To get the community more proactive in getting the attention of Devs to fix this blight that persists on the game. Over and over it happens and I'm fed up with it. Toxicity is the reason I'm starting to hate the game. Now it's just getting kicked for no reason, TK'd for no reason, being called out for no reason. In really fed up. I dunno what to do. I'm sick and tired of it. I really am. I dunno. Really dont. 
---
&gt; The only place actually using Remington AR rifles are the Philippines. Remington got a contract to supply them.

I'm gonna chime in because I'm from the Philippines. Were you talking about our law enforcement? The PNP has been buying guns from all sorts of places recently (China and Israel for instance) and the PNP-Special Action Force is quite fond of FERFRANS. Haven't heard/read anything about Remington ARs, but maybe our military has them in droves.

Other than that a yoga skin similar to IQ's Elite would at least be really... profitable x).

It doesn’t give you a little message saying “congratulations, you’ve got ... banned! You’re really making the world a better place!” Get real here. Read the sub rules.

i wish they would change the hostage skin to that recruit instead of a soccer mom that team 6 kidnapped. it would make more sense.

So they're nerfing Cav because she's "frustrating" to play against, yet they're buffing Clash. Thanks Ubi. 
---
The problem now is that, if you don't like shotguns, she's defined more by her horizontal recoil than her ability, or literally anything else about her, because it doesn't matter if you like her ability or her being a 3 speed or anything else if you find the horizontal recoil too annoying. 
---
I fucking love your reaction
---
I'm trying to plasma cut the six logo into a quarter inch aluminum plate to use as a keychain
---
I dont understand how this is a HUGE nerf. A small bit of recoil? No problem. Her gun has virtually none anyways. Mag size decease? If you needed the 15 rounds to get one kill you didn't deserve it. The hipfire ads is sad but at the same time just ADS. And the damage nerf has been counteracted by her range increase. She will now deal 65 damage up to around 15 to 20 meters against 3 speeds and a little less to 2 armors. It's still a two shot up close and now at longer ranges. I'm excited for these changes and I main cav. I feel like the nerds are being misrepresented and this might actually be a buff to cav

Most the common and uncommon skins are basically just brightly colored splotches.

Might be "Kona" might be "Spore", but it's all lame to me.
---
I own both consoles but I play siege on my PS4. Which is why I started looking into an elite style controller to play with. I absolutely love the weight and additional controls of the x1 elite controller. It’s so dense and the additional triggers def intrigued me.
---
I can’t do claw either. It just feels weird. Hence why I was looking into the rear controls too.

its been 3 years man, if they havent by now youd best just give up. Theres no money down there and therefore no reason for them to care. Maybe if diamonds and pro players start being toxic we can do something, until then theres no hope. 
---
I think it’s good because it makes her pistol more of a secondary rather than a primary 
---
Glitch I got 100$ worth of credits for 26$ lol 
---
yeah but I don't like shotguns and her smgs horizontal recoil is so bad that it's literally unusable to me.

1 shot definitely hit his headpiece, which isn’t his hitbox (weirdly), but at least 3 shots were center of head.

That might be cool.  That patch is actually from her grandfather!  In her bio it states that after her grandpa passed she couldn’t get over the loss and inspired by him, carried a piece of him wherever she went.  It says that her jacket belonged to him.  Kind of cool actually, I like how in-depth the lore is
---
I say 1 because I paused and examined to be sure.

Meh, 3 isn't enough.

Why not 6? Also, remove the cooldown between them.

Oh you can?

That would be great!
---
I think taking frags away from her was ultimately a good thing. Was she insanely fun to play with frags? Absolutely yes, but it turned IQ into a fragger like Ash instead of her intended support role. She's still extremely valuable against a good amount of the defending team (Valks, Kapkans, Vigils, Pulses, Lesions, Echos) even without frag nades, and I think that's a good spot for an operator to be: very good in certain situations, but not just a safe pick.

Rank in this game is based on how many wins you can do in a row. Yoy can carry your team with 12-1 but if you lose you will also lose rank.

Yeah but I’m pretty sure the only ones left are them two, clash and mav that’s just what I think since Alibi, maestro, lion and finka got them this season.

Yeha but at "standard" level of play your only playing against standard lion players. When he's used correctly and effectively by the pro's he is extremely powerful

---
I don't usually to, but if it's needed, on def it's rook, put down the armor and when they are looking at the roses use the revolver on the man who most probably tked me last round. If it's attack, blitz for obvious reasons
---
Haha, this game is full of minigames.

---

---
I think the issue was that she could deal with nearly every single electronic gadget the defenders had. Granted, you only had 2 frag nades, and assuming you're using them strictly to destroy gadgets that isn't too bad, but I think that having a catch-all anti-gadget attacker is too much. She's still plenty effective against Lesion mines, Yokais, Pulse/Vigil players, Black Eyes, and occasionally Kapkan traps. That's not an insignifcant amount of things to counter to a degree, I don't think she needs to also be able to take out Evil Eyes and Grizmots in precarious locations, for example, there are other operators for that. 
---
HORRRRYYY SHIIITTTTT
---
Let people laugh you big grump
---
Maybe, but a pro lion player will be against a pro player. As much as I learned how to counter blitz (wasnt easy I must say) they as pros can learn how to counter lion (basickly dont move).
---
Is tHaT a MoThERfUkeN JOjo rEferENCe?

He always has a shotgun.
---
Yeah that's the same thing that happened to us-there was no notification of anyone leaving after the match started, it just started 3v5.
---
That's what I was thinking with the last panel 
---
Yup. 15k renown.

Why is this marked NSFW?

Cause you shouldn't be watching videos at work 🤔😂

Yea true but outside of them (never head of em before this season) I’ve never seen any team run blitz. Like does G2 run blitz?

It's a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference.
---
In part four, one character is given being held hostage, and is given the option to be released, but in return has to lure a companion (and one that he does not really enjoy being around at that) to his captor. In the exact same way and with the exact same face as buck in the last panel of this comic, the character dramatically refuses, telling his captor that one of his favorite things to do is to tell someone who things they're in complete control, "no".
---
Giving I.Q the M870 is like handing ash a shotgun, you know that’ll be overpowered and abused 😂, but i agree with flashes or smokes

Damn Crizzle. Sorry to hear that. That’s a hefty price tag for the Ultimate to not be as durable as it is...the few reviews I did read on them sounded well, but the sample size was so low....makes me wonder if there might be more issues. Also, was unaware ASTRO was making a pro controller too.

You mentioned a converter for the Elite to PS4? What exactly is it?

As a Smoke main I approve of this
---
Her pistol is getting some big nerfs.
---
Read the TTS patch notes my dude. She's getting nerfed pretty hard
---
Aside from the range buff, everything else about the change is bad for the gun. And seriously, her shotgun is no more than decent and like I said, her M12 is probably the worst smg in the game.
---
oh fuck

Don't worry...your plat III is forever etched into r6stat :)

If you read my comment close enough, you'd see I already agreed to that.
---
She got her damage reduced from 99 to 65, however her 2 shot range (which was still the minimum BTK anyways) increased by 50%. Aka, it was actually a huge buff but Reddit consists almost exclusively of retards.
---
Zero tolerance removes the requirement for critical thinking from administrators and teachers.  This is vitally important, as there has been a distinct lack of critical thinking skills in public education for years. 
---
Her damage drop off is getting a huge buff.
---
google translate lookin ass
---
Yes
---
Everything else is either irrelevant or barely makes a difference. The range buff is genuinely huge, in the sense that her gun is a 2 shot in a 2m range for 1 armours, which brings it in like with other pistols, and no longer requiring 3 shots to down somebody in 20m. That makes her so much better in Long hallways like bank and fortress.
---
Her recoil apparently isn't bad.
---
Give Dokkaebi her claymore back too dammit
---
So why ain’t finka there or lesion or any other operator that’s been nerfed before 
---
she is not in a bad place, but she's not in a good place either... her pistol should require a little more skill since it's deadly at short distances. that nerf might bring her pick rate down. 
---
it really do be like that
---
Relax, bub.
---
She got a pretty significant range buff. You can now 2 shot people across long hallways like bank.
---
People are freaking out without reading the changes breakown post on the TTS sub
---
The issue is that its starts to reload and you have to spam switch weapons button one to cancel one to switch. Gets me killed way to much.
---
Oh trust me. You'll love the new buff.
---
Me too
---
I mean she post 3 bullets in her magazine and her spread is increased whilst hip firing but sure you can say it's a buff. 
---
Lion and BB both are broken af.

BB is still, and will always be "fundamentally broken".

Did he inform the local special force ahead first, because it would be fked up if he was misunderstood as terrorist.

Yes - I’m on Xbox. First they tried inviting everyone on our team to try DDOS’ing players out of the game, but no one joined their party, so then they used the second measure which was to hit the servers and cancel the game; you know that’s what they’re doing when they’re AFK and you see everyone’s ping skyrocket.
---
It is Caveira. Not Caveria, not Caviera. Caveira. 
---
Alright I get it now thanks for the help
---
the famous one is brookstone, but there are other brands too. I love my raiju ultimate, but I can't in good faith recommend it until the kinks and bugs are worked out (which isn't uncommon for Razer to take up to a year to sort this kind of thing out honestly.) A lot of people are excited for the Astro and I would get it myself, but I'm too used to the unique extra buttons on the Razer controllers that sit in between the Bumpers and Triggers. The Ultimate is technically very durable, it has a software flaw with stick inputs which can be lethal in FPS games. 
---
My question is this, high school students are allowed to talk about a rap song containing references to guns and drugs. History classes for US History that I attended have pictures of soldiers with guns and have fake reenactments with guns involved.

Where do the limits of educational learning versus zero tolerance start?

Yeah, we all need to stop being this dramatic.

This is wince-inducing.

I'd take impacts over C4 anyways in all honesty, then the ACOG kinda sucked to lose but he's still a top tier OP. Wouldn't really be to upset about it.

Almost every shield over went up against (and my buddies also believe this as well) that the melee animation for shields is busted. You see the shield swing back, go to shoot, and die. The shield is at apex on the backswing, and instant death. You don’t even get to see the shield move forward. There’s no chance of getting a good counter to it unless you were predicting them. And even then it’s inconsistent.
---
That is not something I needed to read today. Thanks!
---
Yeah never even heard of that converter but went to the website and holy shit. Surprised they have so many conferters. Insane. Might actually look into that considering how comfy the Elite is. Thanks!!!! Also gonna look into the ASTRO. 
---
Did u ever see a a10 warthog? 
---
Np
---
Oh shit....
---
Oh that's rough. On pc if you scroll up it will switch to the pistol mid reload by auto cancelling the reload. Youll reload or finish the animation again after you switch back.
---
Well that's hellish

You are pathetic.

Absolutely.  That's why my children go to a private charter school.

And the best part?  My state pays for it now!

If its the standard edition it would be a huge discount

Youre trying so hard to "own the libs" you dont realize youre making a fool out of yourself. 
---
I think every operator fits a play style. It just depends on what that is for you. Except Tachanka. He’s so broken the Devs themselves said they can’t do anything to fix him because his gadget is immobile. 
---
Sadly it didnt record right control.
---
Not sure if trying to be funny or just plain dumb
---
Nani the fuck

You editted your post to look smart

Don't forget to take micro controller and program it to glow when opened or give it asap after you rigged it

Just headshot me through the shield.

Physics does not agree with your proposal
---
I wish i have friend like that.....

Nope.

Cant they re-work his gadget? 
---
Ehm, mind explaining yourself why? Cause it actually works rather well. There are some flaws but that's mainly people abusing it. But that's a very small minority. 
---
Please tell, why do you think it that
---
aah, one of the classic 200 IQ plays
---
Normally I’m skeptical when someone says “I’m not using m&amp;k” when it’s super suspicious. But this isn’t suspicious at all to me, looks way too clearly like controller. Hell your sensitivity looks likes it’s in the same range as mine. Lol
---
Username checks out
---
I'm sorry man but this isn't true. You can't tell by how someone moves or anything other than if it's communicated or if there is a uniform appearance. Pointing guns at people is hard and stressful and doesn't lend itself to anything but fast decisions. I'm not trying to be an ass. But some people think that having guns out and moving like a good guy means you won't get shot and it's not true.
---
You mean the 1 bullet his shield is able to take before he's able to be instantly killed with a headshot?
---
Im like 99.99% sure that was just a meme someone made
---
Honestly it all comes down to preference. I like to have ads sens lower so i can get smoother aim when rounding corners.
---
Skills bro!! nicely done.

My rank up game to plat 1 i got vs 3 Diamonds and 2 plat 1 i had 2 plat 1 and 3 plat 2 on my team. And it was on skyscraper but some how we won 5:3 and I got 130 points vs the 80 i normalt got during the time

I'm allowed to complain if i want to. We need ubisoft to listen and finally do something. The game is almost unplayable if you can't afford a good pc and good internet

Thanks man

give him lesions gun with the pistol acog
---
her only buff was a bit more range, in which case some people prefer the M12 for longer distance engagements, her Luison still has less damage, less ammo and more recoil, but I think she might still be a viable roamer and slightly more flexible now 
---
I don’t know 
---
Go to hell, fucking cunt

Only issue highlighted here is the loss of Recruit's usual black shield. An earlier patch accidentally replaced them with Fuze's green shield and hasn't been fixed yet.

---
Well maybe impossible to you? I have  done it multiple times and have seen it done multiple more times. Its not challenging at all to win a gunfight with cav because her weapon is better than anyone else's, if you are smart with your engagements you will only ever be in close quarter fights. Siege favours better sights but that's all negated when your fighting a gun hitting 99 damage at close range 
---
Pretty sure it's been there from the beginning.
---
Then atleast explain what do you mean by "one of the weapon skin Caviera" 
---
Bandit is op
---
Cavieras design is significantly copied in fortnites battle royale skin you would reviece if you purchased save the word.
---
Okay now?
---
The increased range means that she'll be able to 2 shot anybody from greater ranges. Less ammo is quite secondary (especially considering you het to 2shot people).
---
The only real nerf imo is that you'll be less precise when not aiming down sights. Wich is great, considering this is supposed to be a tactical game.
---
This. Is. TOWEEEEEEEEER. \*kick\*
---
Efficiency is clever laziness
---
Can you tell me why?
---
Usually, sales are rare.  
---
But if you have the starter edition, then some operators often get a 10-20% discount. But it's pretty inconsistent, you can have 2 ops for 20% off for a week, and then 3 weeks without any discounts.
---
I never assumed your rank lol I just implied maybe you can't use her very well. Even if they all push to clear your floor if you are smart you should get about 2 kills min and delay a very very long time. You are not suppose to peak with her you make them peak you so you play the close angles not the far ones. It's all about positioning and knowing when to engage by the sound of it you just go balls out and die... And check rogue9 official range chart that's where I got my info from. Are you pc or console because on pc not having a sight on her gun is really just not an issue at all. Like at all at all 
---
The kill cams are full of bug this season. Maybe thats the problem.
---
&gt;buys fortnite skins on credit
---
Sounds about right. Who the fuck other than a kid would use credit to buy a skin rather than debit
---
I lost it to I contacted support and they said just restart my game but it’s still gone which sucks
---
Yes that is the Spetsnaz shield.
---
I dont know what Ubisoft gonna do about the Toxic stuff in this game but I would still buy it because you don't have to worry about your renown
---
Theres a new skin? Yea buy it because you don't have to save your renown 
---
THIS IS WHERE WE FIGHT! THIS IS WHERE WE HOLD THEM! 
---
##THIS IS WHERE THEY DIE!
---
You should buy it if it goes an sale. It’s actually a pretty good deal because you get new operators a week before non season pass holders get to buy them.
---
Oh you've got me wrong, I couldn't care less that Cav is getting nerfed if anything I'm glad, I hate Cav with a burning passion my main already got nerfed hard (too much if you ask me but I'm sure many would disagree). I'm just trying to point out that this IS a nerf to people.

Also, people on Reddit having an opinion on something - whether it's kneejerk or not - does not mean they don't understand and does not mean they are wrong.

If you wanna support the game, save up renown, get a few free R6 credits, get 7-day early and free access to the DLC ops, get exclusive uniforms for the new DLC-Ops and get the Season-Pass exclusive Lava-Skin.... go for the season-pass.
---
If not, then there isn't really a point in buying.

Worst thing about black ice is that they don't even look good at low settings
---
Xbox now offers devs the option to enable M/Kb on console games, as far as I am aware Ubi has not said rather they will allow it or not. Other than that, there is nothing you can do but keep complaining and hope Ubi will maybe hear us one day, it sucks, and it's annoying, but I am not paying 100 bucks just to be on an even playing field in ranked matches, turn it on, or don't and get rid of M/Kb users, I don't care how you manage to catch them, but figure it out, cause it kills all the fun in higher ranked matches. 
---
True that
---
if you make anything that looks similar to something in fortnite the fan base goes crazy.
---
it’s not the *only* shotgun strat, but one of many. The play style is different, but the point about them having to close the distance with you is still valid. 
---
Obviously if you get droned out, you have to respond. 
---
Plat 3 isn’t hard to get to if you play against high golds. Most Plat 3s are just gold 1 tbh.

Before the recoil and ACOGs can we at least get his ads time in line with that of other smgs. As of now he has the only SMH with the same ads time of attacking assault rifles. With a relatively low fire rate and even worse damage. IMO even though it's a laser it needs a lot of work

I never understood the logic behind clutch or kick. So I have to be punished for the rest of the team being shit? K

If I solo que, do you recommend that I anchor or roam. I pretty good at each
---
Black shield was better. But now we have a hostage killing buff.
---
Instagram wont let us see titties but they allow and facilitate content like that. 
---
Favela, but ok.
---
On the other hand if R6 copies anything, we're stooping down to Fortnite's level. 
---
He doesn’t play ranked so I don’t know what rank he would be but he’s level 150
---
Thats why i said games and fortnite in bracets, im on mobile and cant afford a computor cuz i have 0 moneyz so thats why im asking
---
it is a good start
---
Give the SMG more damage as well cause that thing shoots cocoa pebbles
---
It's just a personal matter because I don't think I should support a company that cares more about skins and "content" than actually balancing and fixing their game. From a player point of view its only good when you are not playing that often so you must not grind that much for a new operator 
---
Is there a good strat that you would recommend for solo que
---
This just makes me hate 2 ability ops
---
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME I HAVE 5 DAYS TO LIVE😂😂😂😂😂😂🅱️🅱️🅱️😂😂😂❤️❤️💯💯💯

I would say that it was already popular before. Just not as extremely popular as it is now
---
Atleast for me, no I put the tips of my fingers down on the mouse pad so I can move the mouse very precisely
---
800dpi and 25 everything else
---
IQ main here, though only plat player, mained her before they took her frags, and believe me, she is still strong as she is now. As much as I wish it would happen, giving her frags back would make her way too versatile.
---
Hahahahaha.... you’re joking, right?.... right?
---
“They did it” 
---
you don’t say
---
what’s your DPI and sens?
---
Yes, unlike us. Because we dont buy them in first place.
---
Insane casual plays
---
The TTS already has his gun with the normal ADS time of SMGs
---
How did she get a range buff if her drop off damage is still shit. And she never had good hipfire.
---
Another casual ace. 
---
Fair point, but fortnite getting the idea to be a battle royale right around when pubg got big certainly isnt a coincidence 
---
Hi, proud of him, I’m dad
---
Oh, that’s been removed awhile ago. There’s other, way more ridiculous things now though :P
---
Did you see pengu’s response? It’s weaker at 1m but the drop off is so much less it will down a ton faster from anything other than in their face.
---
Haha I see what your getting at but I like think they have sufficient counters and could be balanced to be unique. First off with the defence op. I had an idea for it that would making stronger then actual Jäger. A cone of vision is created from the drone that when detects a grenade it destroys it. Also the new attacker ability would also destroy it. As for the new attacker mute would be a hard counter for it as it is a drone. It could also be slower to make it easier to shoot. But it isn't just a better Thatcher. He can be counters by jäger or the new defence op while the drone can only be countered by mute or shooting at it. Really they do the same thing as what jäger and thatcher do but do it in different ways
---
I wish I could play with skins but they're so distracting 
---
New movie idea for tachanka 
---
*THE CHONK*
---
At first I thought they were hackers, but I'm a gold (play like silver) and they were losing to us, and their rank was copper, so I tried to find something on the internet and people are saying that If you are losing the match, all you need to do is leave just before it ends so it won't count to your overall WIN/LOSS ratio.

I've never left the match at the end, but from what I know, when you leave in the middle of a ranked you get a ban.

My friend has been unironically using tachanka for years. He’s diamond and plays tachanka roughly 50% of his games

Absolutely true, and I don't get the point. If you hace a 30 win/loss ratio, is obvious that is because you are leaving the matches you lose.

”Pre nerf pulse was balanced and should be brought back”
---
Im in the netherlands and 75% of my games are english speakers
---
Some YouTuber actually made a video on this claiming that the defensive win rate was dependant on pulse being broken so therefore he should remain broken. Like wtf!?

Yeah, this happened to me yesterday but with Thermite and Hibana charges. Guess the sound bug is back

I’ll admit I exclusively play bomb, but hostage is better than secure area imo

I think the sound has some issues right now, I have sometimes been sprinting about the map and not even hearing my own footsteps.

There have been a ton of audio bugs this season at least on ps4.
---
Sometimes my audio goes completely backwards as if I have my headset on the wrong way
---
HAWOO!
---
So toxic. Must be from having fucked up teeth ya sad case Brit 
---
I am extremely sensitive about this. I come from the 90's gamer identity and I feel personally attacked by people like anita sarkeesian. It is not harmless social critique to people like me. It is an attack to the very core of my character as a human being and an assault on a past time that I have dedicated countless hours and unknown amounts of money on. Honestly, if you are gonna cast video games that I play in the role of societal negatives I am going to defend them and demand empirical evidence that they are such things. Not personal subjective opinions edited together as a misleading critique on youtube.
---
Yeah I think it would be very funny, but that doesn’t really fit in Rainbow. It will probably never come out
---
Hmmmm....
---
Maestro or Mira, since you like to anchor.
---
Why was it shit? I know it started with 4 maps but the rest of the game was ok.
---
Tactical hmmmmmmmm
---
Why would you go for short bursts? Of you whip the fun out then you are probably spraying someone down up close 
---
I'll take a look then... I think the worst of this isn't even that they're copying, but that these people who only play Fortnite will look to the original skins and say that they're copying Fortnite when actually its the other way around.
---
As others said there's no way Ubisoft can split up eu servers in more than the 3 we currently have without making queue times 4x times what they are now,  since IIRC they are using MS Azure server, so technically they can't just say "hey let's add some servers over there", they depend on MS decisions for that. 
---
I personally don't find many italians (the few I encountered were easy to spot, it's the same in real life, trust me) but others do the same thing and start the match *f i s t i n g* their keyboard/earraping the team in search of a partner from their land. You need to understand, though, that many don't know english well enough to talk to others, or are simply too shy to speak in another language because they might be scared of getting bullied, and given the game's reputation it wouldn't surprise me. When I find foreigners that don't speak english I either say that I don't understand them or just mute voice chat if they are too noisy. As long as it's casual, ofc. If this happens to you in ranked.. welp, FiNd SoMe FrIeNdS! No seriously, don't soloQ ranked, use [Discord](http://discord.gg/rainbow6) if you can. It's a nightmare without a team 
---
Just putting a reminder here that console players aren’t typically this bad. These guys are bad even for low silver, I play at high gold and everyone is very much competitive (for the most part, I blame the ranking system for the bad ones that slip up there). I have pc as well but don’t play as much because my squad is on Xbox and I honestly don’t notice a huge difference other than aim.
---
Only when the ideas have holes in them and I do love these cry threads. Lets say it would work 100% against normal keyboard. All siege kbm players will use a sony navigator or analog keyboard. Your fix then becomes useless.  Now the best part  EPIC tried to kick kbm users based on analog movement and was bypassed by xim the same day even before EPIC removed the detection after complains from Sony. 
---
Honest to God I keep seeing Lara Croft from the old games in Cav in this picture
---
I’ve met many people who say that overwatch is copying Fortnite even thought the skins from overwatch come out a whole year prior lol
---
Bye

Some people said maverick's blowtorch should be as loud as hibana's charges

Alibi should be able to deploy holograms of her teammates 
---
Someone once said vigil's k1a is the worst gun in the game (no they weren't joking) 
---
Obviously If you are close you either tap the head or ain for upper body and let the spray control the gun till you reach the head I guess.
---
But her SMG can be used mid range and compensator won't be that great on it imho in that rage, thus firing bursts seems way more effective than full auto at a distance.
---
Need to play with it to see how well it performs first I guess.
---
doc forsure is the best. his ability is simple, he can keep himself in the fight, revive himeself, has an acog, is 3 armoured, and has a good weapon. 
---
Tbh I wouldn't play a shooter game on console if I had a gaming PC. 
---
Shas is GOAT
---
But seriously, I like the idea, I just dont see how it would work. The physics in this game are already wonky as hell, i just dont see how it could handle a castle barricade changing shapes to be placed anywhere. Maybe if ubi could go through and find every single position one could go and allow the placement of them, but that still seems like a lot of work.
---
Thanks! 
---
Because it's within the rules of my ps4.  Sony offers a licensed kbm for gaming to all of us. Just like buying a scuff controller this is a choise for all of us. 
---
Fuze is a great one man army. He can breach. He can clear traps and is gun is very easy to control with good damage. Plus those scopes are so nice.
---
I just tried the new mobile game. Its really really bad.
---
Did I winge? I said I'm not sure if I like it and said I hope it still maintains its burst fire mode. 
---
 We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void.

Wow! It’s almost like military irl dresses like the characters who are modeled after irl military !! Wow very cool
---
There's no fire mode button on the screen there. It doesn't have changeable fire modes 
---
Nah, that's either a 4k or an ACEterisk.  
---
 
---
cheers mate
---
lolololol increased damage and it's not auto instead of burst. And you go with it's not a buff. Jesus Christ some people are actually brain dead
---
Ha I beat you to it!
---
Sure thing
---
well shitttt...
---
Your wreak on pennies kid
---
I remember seeing this in a few videos. It’s a bad idea cause sometimes the RNG pucks don’t land near them, or they defuse before they die. Funny af tho
---
I mean, the idea's cool and all until it gets fucking destroyed, that's the real problem with Castle.
---
That's why you often see recommendations to use Castle for blocking entry points and lines of sight that the attackers won't be so willing to spend resources on to open. Some setups are great, because they block lines of sight for marksmen and you can use ADS to counter Ash/Zofia/frag nades, but Castle alone doesn't do much.
---
Me too thanks.
---
Cool. See ya around.
---
this would be cool
---
Best Castle buff idea is to make him an attacker, honestly. Think about how often a bad Castle has ruined your rotations as a defender and cost you a round.
---
I’ll be your friend :)
---
I just use an ethernet so that I have 9 ms consistently in all of the games I play and I do feel your pain. Not everyone has a sub 60 ms internet connection though and overall the servers Ubisoft uses must be connected to a microwave because even with a great ping that I have tested in other games  my connection still acts like a 5th grader on crack trying to color in the boxes.
---
If Ubi attempts to put this on the game it will be more bugged than anything we have ever seen or will ever see. 
---
Honestly not a bad idea though.
---
Some of my favorite gems from this sub:
---
* Doc and Rook should lose their ACOG
---
* Blackbeard is weak/underpowered
---
* Pre-nerf Bearing-9 and SMG-12 were balanced
---
* Lion was balanced at launch
---
* Ela was balanced at launch
---
No need to be so upset about my opinion.

So you rather waste utility? Lmao you can easily reload after you shot the kapkan trap. Sorry to say that but that sounds like a strat a copper would do
---
Your entire comment history is just you being an asshole to people. Please, kindly, go fuck yourself. 
---
It's perfectly fine sure, but for me and many others it's not fun to play as and especially not fun to play against. Even Get_Flanked a fairly known YouTuber has made a video about my combo point. Although I don't think he's very good at the game, he still makes very valid points in regards to the conversation of fair vs fun in siege. It doesn't feel like a challenge playing against these combos so much as a, "well let's do our best even though we're at a disadvantage just because of the abilities they have access to. " 
---
Practice in terrorist hunt or use custom matches with your team to practice setting up a good plan for attack and defense and plan that way. Another way to do this is going to ubisoft and inviting your friends to the map planning portion where you can pan strats for certain maps.
---
How? You friends with a Dev? That's dope though
---
Discord is a much more effective way of doing this friend.
---
I'm sorry sir, it's time for you to leave.
---
Uh aside from the fact that it's not a good idea, the animation of castle pulling a 12-foot reinforcement out of his backpack would be strange...
---
We would’ve never guessed!
---
Mute's body fits perfect in that opening
---
I have a class like this where I saw someone made a notebook with Rook’s icon shortly after getting R6 when I was put on Rook duty. :) Later on, I made some vinyl stickers with Lesion and Ela icons. 
---
please, kindly go molest a fox or whatever you folk do 
---
Not everyone has top tier internet. It’s not fun for them either 
---
Ha weeb
---
Oh I know especially in casual when I rush someone with lion I have a lot of messages calling me trash
---
you mid stroke or nah? 
---
just like jager mains
---
Either give castle two more barricades (like kapkans 5 charges) or make it more durable -- take two explosives or two sledge strikes to take it down.
---
I call this a fix to cav rather than a nerf. That 99 damage with drop off was always so wierd for me. Its puts her pistol in line with others.
---
Search for Rainbow Six Keychain on Aliexpress and you will find multible sellers for both of these ;)
---
Dude I just started. Don't go all ranked bs on me. 
---
Looks like a fuckin pocket m16
---
I asked for proof none of this is proof that Sony told epic to do this, also this combo went deeper than you putting holes into my idea. As you have stated as a fact that Sony allows k&amp;m i agree that they do, but you are also saying the devs don't have a choice over it when they do. I am still waiting for this proof of Sony telling epic to revert this back, even if you do know the facts you are not posting proof these facts. Well I am not going to search Google anymore for this as I have already done it and found nothing regarding this.

I'll stop, you obviously have the better counterargument to me, good job man, you're doing good work &lt;3
---
I would feel sorry for you, but you have a reflex on the MP5 instead of the acog. Still sorry for you, but less. XD
---
how does this shit look better than cavs model in the multi million dollar game
---
Wait ae they buffing the Mp5sd or nerfing the MP5?
---
Lmfao wow
---
We spent too much time with this game so it’s only normal. I’ve been feeling it for about 2 seasons now. Wonder how much work it would be for Ubi to give us a chance to play the vanilla operators. 
---
It's not as clunky as one may think. Though obviously not precise either. We make it work

---
For echo I can agree with the bearing being broken, but hibana’s Type 89 only has a 20 round mag, so I think it was pretty fair to give her a secondary smg like to bearing. Maybe a bit of a magazine nerf to make it more like the smg 11 would be fine but the recoil leaves her with a low magazine AR which is decent at best, with the option to spray and pray if that runs out during a gun fight.

---
The match ender 😱
---
Gaaayyyy
---
obviously everybody knows that shit like battle royale and hunger games came out before, and there was probably some mention of the idea even before those 
---
Another side of it to consider is, the P90 is rarely used. Almost everyone goes for the MP5 if they are playing Rook or Doc. I think this is partially an effort to increase the use of the P90.
---
Cavs 99 damage only applies if you are in what is basically melee range. If your in melee range, chances are you snuck up behind someone and can headshot them anyway. The drop off for her pistol is insane your doing 20ish damage at 15m. With her new changes, she will have 66 damage the Highest of any pistol. And on top of that, her damage drop off is going to be changed to fall in line with regular pistols, so now she will be doing 66 damage at 15m which is way better than 99 at &lt;5m, or 20 at 15. She’s only getting stronger with this update except for mag size and recoil. 
---
R/wooosh
---
yikes
---
YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, FUCK OFF OUT OF HERE!
---
That’s still a hefty damage. Especially towards the end where most like everyone’s health is worn down. And thee seconds of getting zapped mean 30 damage.
---
Oh, i just realized that it was nerfed
---
Agreed. 
---
It’s not necessarily a watermark its my Ubisoft profile picture lol
---
Thermite would wrap his exothermic charge around someone and detonate it, ah I can see it now such a gruesome way to die.

The face paint might be, but overall the outfit doesn't have too many similarities IMO
---
Like a classic old school mode? That would definitely feel welcome
---
petition to make this the default recruit skin
---
She still has a positive win rate. Her guns and gadget are good enough to win games. She don’t need a buff
---
I don’t know much about fortnite but I doubt when they were making cavers the devs played early access fortnite
---
Yeah, just the original operators. Or as I said up to Mira. No global abilities. Probably wouldn’t be too hard for Ubi to do that. 
---
Yeah thanks and you can go back to saying shits that you have 0 clue about, pissing people off and pretend to be sarcastic to hide the humiliation after getting call out. 
---
Yeah
---
Who??
---
Go for an apocalypto/wolfenstein-esque style. Blood splattered on the face with high contrast, and more blue than some might expect.
---
Please don't let this become the new trend. We get it, you saw the Red Dead post blow up, doesn't mean it will do the same for you.

Take away one barricade and make them similar to hard walls. Normal breaching tools don’t work, and they can be electrified. Defenders should still be able to pull them down or impact them for balances sake. 
---
What's funny is you've already applied so many ideas to me and the message I've tried to portray in this post even calling me an elitist and saying I'm trying to push my idea onto everyone else all the while admitting that you didn't read the post and STILL trying to apply all of these characteristics and ideas totally separate from my post. You seriously sound like an idiot..

You bring up good points but Cav's pistol was never broken.. Why do people not realize how insane the damage drop of is? Even at 5yards which is practically on top of someone, the damage was like 40-60
---
Yes ik, it's my ig sensetivities that are high
---
Is smoke the only one with a working gas mask 
---
It was Caveira that ran past you, and she is still alive afterwards.
---
Also you got a penetration kill, so you killed a person behind the unreinforced wall to site (where the painting is).

P.S- is there anyway to get pro league vigil anymore? I didn't have money then

even if it does, still doesn’t change the fact that it’s preference based. just don’t nolife games on your computer and you won’t be getting an rsi (probably)

Ok but even if “people were playing in 2014” the skin that has the skull face paint came out like a couple months back because of the founders pack or whatever

Honestly though. Reddit's becoming more tarnished by the day.

Lion, vigil.
---
Oof
---
Lol like we know where the barricade boards are hidden as well lmao watta guy
---
Yes the technical aspect of the game improved a ton since release, some people complaining about bugs that are still in the game don´t know what shit we had to encounter at launch. The communication and the time Ubisoft needs for gamebreaking bugs is still one of the worst in the gaming industry imo. They talk about changing Ranked Matchmaking since mid last year and the only thing they added is 2FA. They just need too long for patches fixes and overall improvements and it´s hurting the game imo. 
---
I still love to play it every night with friends for 2-3 games. But it could be so much better if they would communicate better and actually do the stuff they promised us.
---
I want doggo
---
Dude I would play bank with that cosplay.
---
Clickbait title no racism happened just casual players being casual players 
---
I didnt know a single word in the dictionary could be cringey besides the word "cringey," but okay.
---
"gOoD jOb"
---
5m the damage was 99 and i've already addressed your comment in this comment section. Feel free to read if you still wonder why people think it's op. It's really the least of my concerns at this point though
---
That's just your opinion dude lol
---
Neat idea but it will not make castle viable. He needs massive rework to not be a complete joke
---
Time to click the exit button
---
Im really upset that they are nerfing the mp5

I want this and the trouble maker charm :(

Username is 🔥 Nice cosplay btw

No it doesn’t.

Yeah I accepted his opinion. That doesn't make me agree with it.

2 hours means that this wasn't the first time...

I had a friend get black ice 417 DMR duplicate 3 times
---
I concur, doctor.
---
What would Auto-Aim aim to? Head? 
---
Omg, it's so cute, lil bandit
---
its gay
---
I think this game has gotten DRAMATICALLY better since I’ve been playing (Velvet Shell). When I think back to old siege I remember the absolutely dog shit lighting, looking outside was looking right into the sun and looking inside was into a black hole. I do agree that current seasons haven’t been as good as previous and the the community is toxic af but I think siege has changed for the better over the years.
---
True but tbh it was only the Blitz who went dialup Buck and Zofia tried 
---
Why would you be? Its perfect
---
Too much. Unrealistic 
---
Flawless execution
---
It would be incredibly game breaking if you couldn't destroy them with standard melee. You decide to play, lets say Lion, you end up being the last one alive and they're in Tea room on Skyscraper (lets use Secure Area as the example) Castle has just barricaded the site off completely and now what can you do as Lion? Well if they remove standard melee, you're completely and utterly fucked. You can't be forced to play someone that can breach Castle barricades on a whim that they \*MIGHT\* have a Castle on the other team.
---
Also, "completely indestructible". You don't know how B A L A N C I N G works do you?
---
Well it wasnt that bad 3 or 4 seasons ago.
---
Even MacieJay complains from time to time that the gaming/playstyle morality has changed in this game.
---
Sadly I still get the micro-stutters with it on and playing with the input lag is rough
---
Fair enough I suppose
---
This is only going to change is we get a post with lots of upvotes trending. We need harsher punishments for teamkilling along with a legitimate reporting system
---
Report for pro
---
Yes 
---
&gt;The game is still fun
---
I don’t find shooting targets with bullets that go everywhere but where I aim to be “fun”
---
What a solution
---
Finally the perfect cosplay to beat my meat to
---
Gonna get a lot of flak for this one. I’m plat 1, so you might want to ignore other people if they don’t have... CREDENTIALS.
---
As I said, I’m a high rank, and it bothers me that currently in the game, the way many glitches work, it’s now “who can do this simple thing after/better” vs skill. I don’t want to lose a gunfight, when I was holding the better angle, had faster reaction times, but I didn’t spam “c” (my keybinds are weird I know). 
---
A lot of other people have this same feeling. Siege is meant to be a measure of pure skill and creativity, and currently, that’s being destroyed. 
---
He could be legit and we’ll never know, battle eye has wrongly banned people before (maciejay) so it could of happened again.
---
Thanks bro. love how the dev's called it a "rework" and people are downvoting me for calling it a buff. Two things can be true at once ya dunces
---
"it's a buff kid it's not something you complain about"-fact its a buff to the gun
---
"It's not a buff, it's a rework, they've completely reworked how the gun works and changed its spray pattern ..."-LOLOLOL IT CAN BE BOTH YA IDIOT
---
If you are confident enough to solo queue you should be good enough to carry and win at least a few. I know randoms are inconsistent and leave, sometimes tk etc. But it’s absolutely possible to do well in solo queue. 
---
At low ranks, sure. At higher ranks the movements look similar to PC players (obviously not as fast and accurate). 
---
That's not a bad idea, but it would take a really really long time for Ubi to implement changes like this on every map without removing sightlines, rotations, and other important parts of maps.
---
Contact ubisoft support. 
---
Damn, haven’t found one yet.
---
Correct. I had a 30minute ban day before yesterday. Purposefull TK's in retaliation for being TK'd, and I do not regret that at all.
---
Still irrelevant to the original idea that we need a forgive system for accidental TK's.
---
r6 was supposed to be tactical and not so casual
---
but if it is in the game and not a bug/glitch feel free to use it
---
Oh Bubba NOOooOo
---
Okay good for you

That would still mean he would have to be sitting there for 3 minutes inside of objective not touching anything 
---
I don't think that works though? Doesn't it say for Sony that they only do stuff about psmessages. This sort of stuff they say should be dealt with the "in game reporting"
---
Take a closer look at each shot it doesn’t look like you hit her 
---
I think we should get a secret animation for this
---
Make it to where twitch drones can't go through them and have it to where he can place in floor so it can add an extra layer. 
---
For example: if sledge wants to break the floor he'd have to hit castles mat then the actual floor to see below it.
---
Same with a breach charge and prevent fuze from blowing through it. 
---
They really don't from the clips I see on Reddit.
---
It’s all good! All the other ops have gray smoke but capitao’s bolt makes a blue color :) would look super dope if you made that change I think
---
Nsfw please this was so sexy it made me nut
---
So, once the other team had discovered what he was doing, they actually TK'd him at the start of every round.  So that was nice.
---
Everyone who said an actual game, I’m pretty sure t’was a joke
---
I know. I probably should've died at least three times during this clip. But that's why it was a MIRAcle.
---
True
---
Agreed. Crouch spamming and this. I really get angry over this even contacted ubi support
---
Nothing
---
Tachanka god
---
IDK. Since you theoretically only play against other controllers it shouldn't need fixing, but that's a different conversation.
---
It’s nothing but a fad and a trend that’s only really played by 8 year olds and certain YouTubers now.  Hell, even Ninja’s not playing as much as he used to.  He’s starting to do some BO4 videos
---
I don't think Bandit would've had enough time to realize what was happening, turn around and run through the other door. The timer was half-full.
---
Lol he’s a lion main calling someone else bad.
---
I don’t want to speak for this guy, but A. It was a joke, B. It’s a team game. Bad teammates = bad team = bad k/d. You can’t get kills when your team also goes and dies and you have no support. 
---
how is this even remotely funny
---
Ur a buck main piss off ur opinion is invalid
---
Agree I would take a 3 point damage increase at least
---
LMAO
---
Core Ross 
---
That’s it you get the final kill and even if you do most people are ads and they may see it for a couple of frames 
---
I will not discuss the technicalities just express my opinion. For me it does not count and probably will turn off some viewers from your series.
---
Honestly save it &amp; get the ops with renown I’d say, there is a lot of R6 credit exclusive content.
---
Why though? They Ubi could possibly add in game awards to them. Such as Overwatch.
---
Haha I would suggest a balaclava at least next time
---
Yes look up core Ross on youtube a pro league streamer comfirmed it 
---
If you can hang from a web upside down I’ll kiss you 
---
Ahhahahahaa
---
I mean that’s the same thing with the skin. Besides we have seasonal skins.
---
She may be a beast but at least she's easy to counter
---
It Is Thursday My Dudes.
---
had a guy screaming at everyone being really toxic since the game started, i tried mediating and keeping the cool with everyone but once it was 1v5 i just stopped trying but it never ended. They just didn’t like the team 
---
Very fun to play, although it reset my game 2 times and had to start from scratch again. 3rd time was when I deleted it
---
So everytime someone ends up on the "got banned" shit in the corner means they got banned? So MacieJay, Beaulo, Pengu, MULTIPLE other top content creators and pro players have been banned, so that means their all cheaters? no you dumb ass their is a flaw in the banning system. Make sure you know what you're talking about you ignorant child. And one link showing some weird shit he did doesn't solidify him as a cheater in that clip either lol. You're some casual rainbow player who's probably a silver or some shit, you have no say and your opinion is irrelevant.
---
(Also apparently you can't read, I've already said he does use walls, because I've seen actual gameplay /streams/clips)
---
Maybe thatchers mask is insulated or something. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
i love it! it looks great! pretty accurate too :)
---
you’re really cute haha ;) don’t listen to all the lewd comments here... XD we’re actually really nice guys. feel free to dm me if you want to meet some people from the community :D we could use a 5th ;)
---
Makes sense I thought you meant that you kept looking at it. 
---
Hey look I'm a dummy!
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Blackbeard needs a buff, lion isn’t broken, favela is a good map. This reddit has no shortage of bad ideas, which further proves my opinion that the general player base is actually clueless when it come to the game.
---
Yeah I guess so but it’s still easier to see a skin than a charm
---
That’s exactly what I thought it was until I saw what Sub it was. 
---
then thats not a smurf, its an alt account. a smurf specifically means that youre pretending to be worse than you are and then destroying everyone at a lower rank. look it up before you use it. 
---
Thanks for the advice
---
It's a team oriented game, I would say plats
---
2 speed\*
---
You might wanna give it to Jager, he needs it more than us
---
I suppose, it would be nice I agree, but it would be weird explaining that they changed it.
---
Best cosplay ever
---
Lesion is an amazing op if you know how to utilize his mines to their maximum potential. 
---
Lmao
---
You can't determine skill from a rank. 
---
Your rank depends on how many matches you win. You could go 0 and 5 and win a match and go up a rank and do 13 and 3 and lose a rank. Your personal input into a team based game cant be compared. In reality youd need to compare individuals rather than rank v rank. Everyone is different. Even if its a 5 stack plat 3 or a solo queue copper. 
---
He's such a noob. Who uses the m870 in ranked (nice clutch tho)
---
It is not a recruit, its an special underwater troop
---
Are you saying "your" the gold to try and justify that people who solo que only have skill and the plat with the 5 stack doesn't? I'm sorry what are you even trying to ask?
---
The skill level in low plat is so varied, there are people that just got lucky and managed to get up and Ex diamonds that got unlucky. At high gold I’d guess it’s a more consistent skill level but I don’t really know.
---
They're at 44 now, so a little over double
---
You gotta make one for Alibi omg. 
---
Can you not read who has more skill. I’m not implying anything don’t get butt hurt it’s a question not a dick don’t take it so hard 
---
ACOG on her laser Vector.... Oh dear God
---
haha yeah they’ve said that at various Q and As. and at the rate they’re going they’ll hit it at 10 years, which is what they’ve said they wanted the lifespan of siege to be... it’s super ambitious. would love a new siege on a more solid engine before then personally. 
---
I want
---
No need to be nasty. 
---
Depends. There is a lot of variables. The plat could be getting completely carried or they could be the one carrying. 
---
Personally, I'd say the gold 2. Playing solo is a lot harder. Constantly being in a 5 stack with good communication ect makes the game a lot easier to play. In my opinion being gold 2 solo is more impressive than being plat 3 in a 5 stack. But that's just me
---
Is this the dad of that "look my dad looks just like Castle" post?
---
the next thing they will will screem: Nerf her plz!!!!!! i cant play ts because off bug, but hell doing same numbers and she will be beter then before and that all over same problems with the gun. 
---
played some custom games alone and the recoil change isnt that high at the moment i think
---
Love ubisoft trying to nurf something and ending up with a buff. 
---
Dude I've been stuck at 99% and I'm level 250 high plat and I just don't want to do it yet but I want it so bad, it'll be my first plat trophy as well. Good job on getting it though.
---
You’re grammar is also great
---
theonlyfatshady, you guys rolled us bad
---
You guys will fap to anything
---
Thank you ! and good luck to you. 
---
My lil bro uses i7-3300 and GTX 660 and runs on high 70 FPS minimum, medium-high
---
like Mira but you can close it back up?
---
So basic it’s unreal
---
If people are getting into situations where they feel vulnerable with her, they're playing her wrong
---
Well you couldn’t see through it like a black mirror but yes 
---
The reason it wasn’t complained about until now is because it wasn’t as prevalent. I’m not saying a quick flick to lean left or right should be punished, but if you get into a gunfight and you spam left and right five times in a second then you don’t deserve to win that fight at all because your bullets would be going every single way except where you want them to. And I’d argue that a good balanced team will beat a hard carry every time, but that’s just me. 
---
Just a way to keep a lot of the toxicity from the game would do for me. 
---
I would get it but I can't be bothered to do terrorist hunt ones
---
*don't you just love all the vertical gameplay*
---
I didn't know the new castle elite skin leaked.
---
So like a Mr. Popo skin?
---
what is advanced and how do i turn it on??
---
Just complete the look and wear clout goggles
---
Definitely an unpopular opinion but to each his own. 
---
This is the only reason I have advanced turned on 
---
I think Maestro is your boy man
---
my favorite: *IQ needs her scanner attached to her primary*. yes sure, if you want to break the game, go ahead..
---
Hop Rocks were S4, they've been vaulted for forever.
---
It means you don’t automatically bring up the phone to control the drone once you throw it out. It’s at the bottom of one of the tabs in settings called something like “gameplay”
---
If you have Advanced drone deployment on, you don't get forced in to camera mode when you throw the drone.  
---
You can turn it on in control options iirc
---
Who would win a season player or some some old ruskie boi?! 🤓
---
I would be so fucking pissed if they Paragoned StW
---
Dok isnt a problem neither is mav, as Pengu and Fabian have said before an operator that stops you from playing like Lion does is the problem. If they keep making stupid operators like this there fanbase will die and doubt they will make it to 100 operators. I've played since the beginning and siege has improved alot...
---
I think this was intentional honestly 
---
I think that he should just have enough blowtorch to get a hatch and a small hole to crawl through and thats it, any more than its too much. Volume is fine with me. 
---
What would allow the attackers to notice them if you couldn't see through it?
---
Howja do that font?
---
Above average but don't *always* use it as a determination of skill (for you or others.) Plenty of people who had started at the very beginning and became so much better over time.
---
Yep, I have zero interest in winning 100 games defending in TH.
---
Yeah kinda like but its small and you have to trip the wire like kapkan. the laser would be able to be seen with IQ's sensor as well. 
---
i mean its a legit strat, you clear the building from top down while the hard breechers go straight to site if possible (except hibana)
---
Yes, yes you are.
---
If you are experienced, it's possible to solo queue to diamond with a tiny bit of luck with the matchmaking, but it's way easier to find a group to play with regularly.  Communication and coordination is key to success in Siege.
---
I've never made it to diamond, only plat. But I can definitely confirm it's a lot easier in a well coordinated communicating team
---
Mhm
---
snice 
---
Nomad or Clash
---
One of the things that I've seen on here would be Episodic stories introducing you to the Ops. For example, there would be a 4-mission FBI campaign that you would play each character and learn their gadgets. As DLC ops are released, you have 2-mission singleplayer missions released at the same time, perhaps tying the operators together with a recurring antagonistic global terror organization.
---
Me too I just get the "we have brought this to our team and we will start working on thos as soon as possible" message 
---
i saw this one castle buff idea (think it was on this sub) that said to increase the length of the castle barrier itself to only allow yokai to fit under it to deny intel for the enemy team. image if that along with this was his buff, i wonder how that would work.
---
For strategy: Learn maps
---
For aim: Terrorist hunt (aim only for the head!)
---
Okay man, you do you. I was just trying to show a cool possibility that could happen. 
---
It's a pistol. How much recoil did you expect it to have?
---
The first edition of Spider-Man Noir Suit 
---
Where do you find the story?
---
*Time to get serious*
---
This needs to be actual recruit headgear
---
U haven’t shown any possibility u were just bitching about skins in a round about way 
---
Hahahaha this made me go to like the Dee crevasses of my brain to remember who Bong Lord is 
---
Amazing
---
Sorry did you just call an operator who can heal his teammates useless? Doc is literally all about team play and allowing teammates to safely engage in another firefight they would otherwise lose due to their low health. That’s the difference between winning and losing more often then not by getting an extra pick that round.
---
What is the point of this?
---
yeah and be storing piss bottles under my deluxe gaming chair by next week... think I'll stick with potato aim

Special Tactics on steam and ios

1). I do not believe that cav needs a nerf due to the weapon drop off beginning at 1 meter, something that takes most other hand guns 5 meters to hit. I aim for the head, so although this change won't affect me too much, I believe that most people forget how much communication you need to counter cav. When she was introduced there were no global ops, leading to high team work and communication to push the objective. She's also never used in pro league for this reason; pro players (and anyone playing competitively) are in VERY tight teams. Now, most people frag hunt, and go alone making them an easy one-tap target. Because of this meta change, I agree that this game is almost a more glorified BO4 experience. I think that everything started going down after operation health, as this was where most of the meta changes really took hold. No more ACOGS on defense, and a LOT more broken ash-style ops. This trend towards low skill ops really took the game hard.
---
2). This, combined with the buff to pistols, and Blitz buffa really accelerated this game to not being fun competitively. Maps such as Theme Park or Tower being ok map experiments really added to the game almost being purposefully frustrating to try and rank up in. The Cancer meta was limited to Blackbeard in season 2, but now with all the global ops on offense, and all the intel gadgets on defense, this game has heavily strayed from its roots. I think Ubisoft should've​ really focused on quality ops, as opposed to their circus act of juggling how effective an operator is by making them almost impossible to counter.
---
3). Ubisoft has been molasses slow with updates, and is the reason I think they should bring back mid-season reinforcements. They could have something on the TTS every 2 or 3 weeks, and finalize the good changes in the mid season reinforcements. I think they also should really change the season pass model, as I think 8 operators every year is too much considering the direction the game has gone. I think they should stop changing the UI every other day and focus on more pressing issues. Also, I think they should region lock accounts, preventing smurfing on other countries. This is also a major issue with seige, and has made ranked a serious shit hole. Overall, Ubisoft really fucked the only game they really had going for them, and as sad as I am to say it, this game isn't going to live to 100 operators, and with Ubisofts behavior in recent events, may die before reaching the 50 operator mark.
---
Rainbow 5, panty siege. 
---
Jackal. He’s great for solo and group que, has great weapons, and great secondary gadgets. 
---
In practice maybe but realistically Doc runs around the map being an ACOG warrior healing himself to take more engagements. Most Doc's just heal teammates when its convenient for them.
---
Are you a roamer or anchor kind if person. For roaming, especially in lower ranks/levels, cav would be one of the best. Lesion or Mira are great anchors. You can keep saving for ela bc she fast af, and her shotgun is good. Dokkaebi is also great aswell (perfect for being cancer while playing bomb, along with lion and jackal). Though, her secondaries are a bit, underpowered at times. Take everything that anyone says about ops with a grain of salt. It's always up to users preference when it come to them. Good luck, hope you do well.
---
Perfect!.mp4

If you have tried rolling back drivers, tried everything possible with your nvidia geforce experience app and nvidia 3D settings, uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified local game files through steam, this video might help https://youtu.be/KzxmLDam-wM. I was having trouble with throttling and this helped. You may also have to try undervolting your CPU. You can find videos on how to do that online.
