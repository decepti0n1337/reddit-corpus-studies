In this episode of Detective Pikachu, join Pikachu as he's recruited to Team Rainbow, a group of international counter terrorist units. Watch as Pikachu helps thwart a Team Rocket attack against the Cerulean City Poke center.

Honestly I feel like you should be able to put two on one door.  One up, one down as the maximum.  That way you can‚Äôt jump over them or crouch under.

Basically, everyone with a Vega 56, Vega 64, or Vega Frontier Edition graphics card gets really glitchy, flashing vertical lines coming off of every operator (and terrorists in t-hunt). I don't know if it's also an issue with integrated Vega graphics, but it's a recent issue that has already been reported to Ubisoft on several occasions, and hopefully one that they're working on. 
---
There's also a potential fix here, for anyone interested, that I just found and have not yet tested: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/avbpjt/for_those_who_have_rx_vega_gpus_and_are/

Vertical recoil is considered controllable because it's consistent. You don't have to be terribly 'skilled' at all to deal with vertical recoil. For example, Twitch's F2 is considered one of the easiest recoil patterns, but it actually has a fair amount of muzzle climb. It's just all straight up, so it's easy to practice and compensate for- it always goes up, so you always pull down. This also generally stays on target more often, because players are taller than they are wide. If you shoot for the chin/upper torso, you have a chance to hit the shoulders or the bottom of the head, and then kick up towards the head even if your recoil control is poor. I'm not endorsing this style, I'm just explaining why vertical is easier.
---
Horizontal recoil is harder because it can go left or right, and it tends to pull you off target no matter what because players are taller than they are wide. High horizontal recoil guns like the SMG12 can be really difficult to use as a result. There's not much to say here except that you can't really do a lot about this, except shortening the bursts before disengaging, rather than spraying a full mag. Fortunately the SMG12 has a large enough magazine that you can do this. It's also worth mentioning that at closer ranges, the SMG12's horizontal recoil tends to matter less because the enemy is super close to you so the spray stays within their hitbox regardless. 
---
Note that for vertical recoil, the best thing you can do with your attachments is to create a smooth pull. The muzzle brake or the flash hider could create the even pull where the first shot recoil is the same as the second, is the same as the third, and so on. For horizontal recoil, the compensator makes a bigger difference, but it does nothing for vertical recoil. What you put on any individual weapon is personal preference, but I think there are structural reasons why your preference might go one way or another. For example, with the SMG11, I find that the horizontal recoil is not really a big deal compared to the vertical. The first shot kicks up really hard compared to the others, so I use the flash hider to smooth out that pull while still doing a little bit of work on the horizontal recoil. 
---
So in a practical sense, IMO you play the SMG11 with the flash hider and pick your fights super carefully for range and disengagement. You're either all the way in or halfway out. You can fire about 7 or 8 bullets at a time, but after that horizontal recoil gets a little rough unless you're at very close range. As a result, it's mostly about positioning and timing rather than gun skill; use your smokes to delay and isolate targets in favorable positions, and yell at your team until they give you the right positions to play as Smoke. 
---
The SMG12 is a little bit better at poking because it doesn't burn through its magazine. However, I think it mostly exists to get switched to when somebody is close enough that the spray doesn't really matter. Play for close range fights and leverage its insane TTK, and don't worry too much about prefiring a few bullets into specific spots if you have somebody cornered. 
---
With the difference being: the enemy can see through the window and has locations for two of your players.  And, if you mess up your prefire, your big French friend is dead.  
---
Smother me with good aim then

Not entirely, hes gonna be a strange group of operator but what do you expect? They plan to add so much

I'd like to see headshots through soft walls do reduced damage because I think it's shitty to get killed cause of a random shot through a wall.

But standard headshots I don't have an issue with.

release date for the new season is march 5th. and yes that's also when people with the year 4 pass get the ops.

As someone who has family/friends in the SF and grew up around SF she looks NOTHING like an SF. She is 5'9 224 pounds she eats a ton of MCdonalds and is in no way in shape to be an Operator. Let me put it in perspective Sledge is a beast of a man he is 6'3 209 pounds.
---
impossible 
---
I think that goes for every game.... but this still doesn‚Äôt add up. You just admitted that it may be a ‚Äúlucky bullet.‚Äù So what you‚Äôre admitting to is that those with skill will land the headshots, where those with less skill won‚Äôt land them as often. They will rely on luck, which is not how you get to the pro league. If they did get rid of headshots, it would come down to ‚Äúx is the best gun/operator because they‚Äôve got the highest dps.‚Äù By allowing this mechanic, someone with an smg can still compete on an even playing field as someone with an AR. If you messed this up, the entire game goes down the drain. You‚Äôd have to redo the entire thing. 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying!
---
I know that the people who say ‚ÄúGGEZ‚Äù are just baiting but it‚Äôs seriously annoying
---
In casual when I'm with a 3 stack its funny. If im alone and theres another 3 stack it aintfunny no more
---
I think a lot of it comes down to the rank you‚Äôre in too tho as lower ranks may not care as much maybe?? I never really see much toxicity definitely not enough to make me really really mad
---
Yeah, it's awful. I dont recall a more toxic community in my years of online gaming. And again, the new teamkill system I'm skeptical about. I don't think it's going to have enough of an impact on the current situation 
---
First the Echo nerf posts now fucking Cav?  I swear you people know nothing about this game
---
Castle because he's Tachanka level garbage without the memes.
---
Alright
---
Ye but usually they're the toxic plats boosting off their silver friends 
---
since when did throwing C4 become toxic? It's a little annoying but don't you think TOXIC is waaay too strong of a word? Listen to some old X360 chats on youtube, then you'll know what toxic is.
---
What does ohm mean?
---
Yeah pretty realistic. Even a hunting rifle can look big in someone‚Äôs hands under 5‚Äô10. Looks funny still though 
---
Did you watch it? I probably have better aim than you on pc bud üòÇ 
---
On low. Probably upwards of 150 I would guess. I have a 980 which pulls 140 something on all low with TAA off. 
---
i‚Äôve had it where me and my team have almost won. We will be up 3-0 and they‚Äôll start teamkilling just to go to overtime and by that time everyone is already pissed off and then we lose because they don‚Äôt stop. it‚Äôs super irritating. i‚Äôve been platinum every season since release and now i‚Äôm stuck at silver 3 because of dumbasses like that.

Pro League returns in 15 days. Most Pros are saying she is going to be OP as fuck to the extent where teams are going to ban her every single match.

So basically, if you use her right, she's super fucking good. IF you use her right that is.
---
the game is designed around the one shot head shot mechanic. changing it would be really stupid.

We need moar bajur here

Coloring of the EO will only change dependent of the base color of the weapon, as far as I know. You will not have the option of changing the base color though. I could be wrong. But I don‚Äôt think I am. But there‚Äôs always that chance.

Awww I thought u were coollllll. I mean if ur above plat 1 sure but ion know

Do that same thing with a smiley face and immediately it pisses people off cause they think it's sarcastic.

Practice headshots on terrorist hunt, go for one tap headshots, have patience and aim each shot with the right stick.

Fine tuning your sensitivity might help out.

Turning V-Sync off is also preferred if not already done.

That will suck even more when damage reflects.

I mean I'm obviously exaggerating but you can tell it takes a full shot more than before

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how the system works

Mute crouch-walks up the stairs and has a kill angle while OP is in a firefight. Three Ying candelas remain while contesting a small room.

They really should change the UI to match her shots per minute though.

The matchmaking UI is better I think,

but I agree, I don't wanna see all these promo either, I'd rather have a bigger mission tabs or anything else except the ads.

And also, I think these UI will go very bad in low-res monitor.

Yes. We need more context.
---
I hate the bitching about night maps and darkness. I've personally never had a problem not being able to see someone. If you cant see outside a window don't peek it. If someone beats you with stealth or camouflage than good on them. Removing genuine strategy from the game to make it easier to play like any other generic arena shooter is no good imo. If anything they should add things to counter it instead of flat out taking it away. I like that i can beat someone who has superior aim with good positioning. Next they will be nerfing pixel peeks.
---
Glaz and/or Dokkaebi (me and my friend's mains)

Like my post says I do have people to play with, however obviously we don‚Äôt always have time for eachother. If it really wasn‚Äôt hard to find people to play with there wouldn‚Äôt be 4 stacks. 1 man shouldn‚Äôt suffer because 4 people don‚Äôt care, most people solo queue after all.

You forgot something really important! That MMR also effects your Tabrank skill! Still people don't read that.. :\\ If you're silver and you're insane at the game, your Tabrank will still be low.

I tagged him because I replied to Death and he wouldn't see it otherwise.

Oh. Now I see. Thanks.

At least we tried to add stuff over the MMR! The MMR does count in Tabrank, as well as other stats, so combined as much stats as we can in another ranking system. How is that bad in anyway?

No, you are not, don't worry too much, just try to be happy for your own sake.

OKAY FIRST ANDY, your terrible at the game. When the team is pushing in your off trying to find that one roamer, instead of working with the team. You never listen to call outs nor do you give callouts. Whenever you die instead of calling out location, you call the game BS, like come on. I think the best example of you "clutching", is when EVERYONE else was on point, and what is Andy doing? Is he with us? Is he covering a entrance? NO, Andy is literally hunting kills on the third floor of cafe, instead of at obj on first floor. So when we get ambushed by the 3 roamers that he didn't get cause he was on the third floor and not the first, we are in a disadvantaged fight, and we kill enough people that it is a 2v1, where our Monty is on obj, fighting for our team, BUT ANDY, where is he? HES STILL ON 3 FLOOR "clearing". He hadn't realized there was one left, after A FULL MINUTE of trying to convince him to help our Monty finally gets kill. So finally he leaves thrid floor and "clutches". SMH, stop encouraging him, hes not a team player, but rather a self absorbed jerk. All he does is hunt kill and try to protect his KDR. DONT PRAISE HIM.

Lol. 3 out of the 4 Spetsnaz are useless. And I'd disagree with you on all those points.

I've started using it now and it's honestly nuts. Even with an angled grip the recoil is minimal and there's nit much horizontal recoil to deal with

for some reason whenever i don‚Äôt have a mag larger than 40 i never pre fire idk why

I have the same problem. I have corsair void pro wireless version same issue. Initially i thought it was because i had OSD enabled and it was because of that. and i thought it was fixed after i shut that off. but it still is not fixed. this problem only came up for me in the recent month and i have not been able to fix it yet. The mic works fine in ALL of my Steam Games but in games on other Launchers it doesn't work, or as the case with rainbow sometimes it works fine and sometimes it doesn't at all or it will work for half the game then the other half it won't. I thought it was just rainbow, but i have the same problem with Black ops 4, Apex legends and more newer games. I No longer think it is just a problem with those specific games but i think it is something to do with those games updates and the updates that have come to the ICUE software that is causing this problem to come up in certain games and launchers. I want more people to bring this to light because it is becoming really tedious and i can no longer just enjoy my games because i cant communicate with my teammates when i really need to. The Void pro is one of my favorite Gaming headsets and i truly love it. it would be a shame if i had to switch to a different headset JUST because of this new glitch. They really need to fix this somehow.

At that low hp 20 and 5 isn‚Äôt that much of a difference concerning how many bullets you can take
---
This was made before finka was relased
---
oohh ok 
---
Isn't it 1HP?  
---
The point is, if we were revived by our teammates before the TTS, it will reset to 50 hp which can take up to 2-3 bullets at max, but with 20HP, you could only take maybe just 1 bullet at close point just like how withstand works usually, so this means Zofia does not need to be revived by her teammates since it'd turns out to be the same.

nice repost

I don't mind castle I just hate the Castles WHO BARRICADE EVERY ENTRANCE TO SITE WHEN THEY'RE CAPPING BY DROPPING HATCH! REEEEEEEEE!

This is how much trust I have in random teammates.

Just feed Ash the same amount of Food as Gridlock. In like 2 months no one will complain anymore.

Good night doc

There are direct counters, but what's the point of running valk if you can run echo? Her speed? Would you trade movable cameras, stuns that counter defuses, and get kills for your team, as well as an ACOG, for speed, one extra immovable camera, and the ability for the cameras to go outside, to be even easier to counter with an IQ?
---
Echo needs to be on the same level as Valk(and the other ops. Valk is just easy to compare). 
---
&gt;  I dont recall a more toxic community in my years of online gaming.
---
I suppose you never played a MOBA then. or CS:GO. I don't know how OW is nowadays but when I stopped playing it was pretty close too.
---
I got a kill like that probably after almost 500 hours.

Wtf this pic has been around for years 
---
Ping abuse is a commonly held misconception relating to client side prediction.
---
The misconception is that because a person with a high ping can "see around a corner" before the server updates their position, that they are then able to shoot at and kill enemies before they ever become visible to their victims. This belief is based on a misunderstanding of how netcode works, and is actually for the most part impossible.
---
"Ping abuse" is not the same as a lag switch, which abuses packet loss, not latency, to gain an unfair advantage, and is actually a bannable offence.
---

Those darn millenials don't even know what phones are
---
Listening to the community after how many years?
---
And then half baking a solution? You guys are so fucking easy to please, no wonder game companies are way more concerned about pumping cosmetic sales rather than actually fixing these pieces of the game. 
---
You can easily track premades abusing the system by logging them kicking people. You can easily track behaviors per account basis over long periods of time.
---
A reflective damage system that occurs after the first TK is does nothing for actual TKers yet here you are, sucking Ubisoft's cock because its "a step in the right direction" after years of negligence. Talk about stockholm syndrome. 
---
PC, and it happens. There's hundreds of thousands playing this game and I'm telling you it happens a lot more than you think. 
---
So nothing was wrong and most of the difficulty was due to the operators they chose, but you want a system implemented? What would the purpose of this system be, exactly?
---
Yep. From the lowest MMR to the highest, its all the same. Assholes being toxic and tking people.
---
Or simply people just saying things that eventually lead to bad blood. Ive seen people clutch a round after a teammate says they should uninstall, then that same teammate kills them the next round for ??? reasons. And then again until they get kicked/TK'd. The behavior cannot be explained other than "I'll TK you so I can be "right" in my mind by wasting your gaming time". 
---
Yes.
---
well yeah but people tend to not like change, and changing from the R4-C the the G36-C is a HUGE change imo, and i think people would rather tend to change their playstyle than change guns. i could be wrong but I'll just have to see in a couple weeks.
---
Crap.
---
Are the prices of base ops for you still 12.5k each?
---
Ash mains are so fucking twitchy with their movement
---
Yea. Nothing changed in the game. 
---
Haven't my dudes. When i have the time ;)
---
When did you all receive it?
---
LMAO la Legi√≥n 
---
Happy cake day btw
---
How do I report them? 
---
Now we  just need the crying ash mains to understand this.
---
Looks like Gridlock 
---
Yeah only time will tell how this change affects her. I for one am quite excited by it, to me it gives that bit of variety, I might actually get killed by an Ash using the G36C now which as of right now is completely obsolete.
---
in game
---
I'm completely against toxicity but TK that fucker or ask someone on their team too.
---
No time for that shit, completely ruins the game.
---
I wasn't forgetting MMR, I thought it was pretty obvious in my response why I didn't even bring it up. The moment you add measurable actions to a ranking system, when it's abundantly clear that the immeasurable actions are at a minimum just as frequent as the measurable ones, players now frequently have to do quick cost-benefit analysis in their head whether they make the strategic play involving a non-measurable action versus taking the measurable action that is more risky to the success of the team. If they don't, they'll wind up having their teammates earn more rank than they do just by virtue of not having as many opportunities to score measured actions.
---
Here are a few examples though there are likely hundreds more I can come up with just off the top of my head:
---
* A teammate spawn peeks and deals 25 damage to an attacker but ultimately dies in the process.  You're the lone anchor on the site providing intel over comms to your team for most of the round.  One of your teammates ends up killing that attacker before they make it to the objective.  All three of your remaining teammates die on the roam without taking out another attacker.  With it being a 4-on-1 with you as the lone anchor remaining, they drone you out and set up a crossfire while going for the plant.  You take 50 health off an attacker but ultimately die without killing attacker.  In that round, your spawn peeking teammate who was dead 5 seconds in will receive more points for the actions described above than you because he got an assist even though you were active on cams throughout the rest of the round feeding intel to your teammates.
---
* It's 2v1 in your team's favor on attack.  You have control over one of the sites and your teammate has the defuser.  The only path the lone defender can use to get back to site is a single choke point that you can watch from inside the room.  Assuming you feel confident in your ability to take out that defender in a 1-on-1, you can make a reasonable case for hunting that frag to secure the kill when clearly the best play for your team is to hold the angle on that single avenue to allow your teammate to get the plant off and then during the post-plant situation.  However, doing that gives your teammate the opportunity to also log the kill rather than you.  At the end of the day, unless the defender manages to successfully retake, the player who receives the most points in tabrank is the one who receives the kill.  If the defender doesn't try to retake, I'm assuming your teammate gets more points because of the plant.
---
* You're playing Montagne and push your way into the site.  You call out the location of every defender over comms, using pings where necessary.  Your teammates use the intel you provide to clear out the objective, your team gets the plant down, and you park yourself in a corner right in front of the defuser.  At no point did you fire your gun in the round.  In fact, at no point did you make a single measurable action.  While it's possible your team would've won the round without your contribution, the system has no idea how it would've played out differently.  Quite literally every teammate of yours would've earned more tabrank than you.  Even if the tabrank scores things like bullets that hit your shield, that would then put your tabrank fate in the hands of your opponents.  If they know there isn't a point to shooting your shield and simply lay off the trigger, you get nothing; if they unload mag after mag into your shield, you score tabrank points like crazy, even though what you did to influence those things was completely the same.
---
Yes, I do realize that the MMR component does mean that players will earn some tabrank positioning by prioritizing the correct play over the measurable one that will lead to the same MMR position if they are successful (but creates a large risk that their MMR position will decrease if they are not successful). But even today when the only thing that matters to your MMR position within your control as the player is wins and losses, you'll find players who refuse to plant the defuser in lieu of chasing down the defenders.  You'll find players who will only use their drones to gather their own intel for a push rather than droning for teammates.  You'll have players who don't reinforce on defense before running off to roam on the other side of the map, possibly even getting their head taken off in a spawnpawn not 10 seconds into the round.  The tabrank system now rewards these kinds of choices if successful, even though the strategically correct play was to make a smarter play to help the team longer.
---
wel yeah, you cacn use her without an acog, and that's what most pro players do, but you'll be the one frustrated at ash because its nearly impossible to kill a person is running around the corner abusing peeker's advantage and crouch spamming with a character with no head hitbox. I can see why they did it tho but I still dont agree with it. I like it, just dont agree with it.

Thank you very much

5:4 aspect ratio?
---
So other day when i was solo playing, the weirdest of things happened. my entire team died within 1 min of the round. The reason being the enemies who rushed in like a maniac. 
---
But the 4 of my team members blamed it on me because i had to go AFK to take a piss. All of them took their turns team-killing me. I mean, can you be more bizarre ??

Why did you even killed the first guy ?

It's literally just a generic knife swish as it would be on a enemy.

It's not enough to beat your opponent, you have to humiliate them as well.

This was beautiful. 
---
Ying‚Äôs LMG is so underrated. It‚Äôs easily one of my top 3 favorite guns on defense. 
---
High ammo capacity, reload speed that is statistically faster than almost every assault rifle, angled grip that makes it aim faster than an assault rifle, no recoil... it just shoots kinda slow. 
---
I personally play it for the memes, it‚Äôs my favorite gamemode for doing dumb tactics with 5 stacks.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, you can tk 2 people without a kick, and the third one will kick you for sure. In preparation phase as a defender, each tk will count as 2 kills, thus you get kicked on the 2nd one since it will be basically 4 kills.
---
 
---
After prep phase, each kill counts as one again.
---
Hostage is always counted as 2 kills.
---
And attackers don't really have a prep phase, thus I guess for the first 30 sec or 1 min each kill is 2, and then it gets lowered to 1 .
---
I feel like nerfing his actual gun makes no sense. I get how the change makes his gameplay more slow-paced, but theres no point in making his gun shoot slower than the avg DMR
---
That and shields are broken. The first person has no correlation to the third person model. It‚Äôs getting patched next season.
---
glaz? shitty?

That wrong pistol though.

I see no reason to run this pistol over the 5-7.

But with 20hp you will survive a Gu mine and electricity. And from my experience, pesky Gu mines are my worst enemy after a withstand lol.

It's incredible, because people base skill on rank and it's the completely the wrong mentality. I have a friend that is not mechanically skilled at FPS games in general, but his in-game knowledge and call outs are second to none. You could theoretically be the MVP on a team whilst dead.
---
idk do it
---
why does this exist
---
It used to be 1, but they changed it to 5. The reason was because if you decreased maximum health in a custom game before, she‚Äôd instantly die after withstanding for whatever reason.

It makes sense in Overwatch because each hero has different style of play altogether and playing a New hero would only ruin Comp. Siege is really not that different between ops

Try not to go above or below objectives on your own or without fully clearing the area first. Your shotgun is very loud and will attract attention from roamers so beware.
---
Personally I've experienced a lot of BS from hit reg on console with Glaz he's a great op but I think that hurts his pick rate. I barely see him played unless I want to pull something cheesy off with Monty on Bomb

Done. Good luck!

He shot one breaching round and still had two after that?

Yeah, same here.  I agree with that, happens to me all the time.  Hitreg isn't the greatest, and it definitely hurts his pick rate.

As a Vietnamese, I approve of this.

It is bannable on console if you formally report and send ubisoft video proof.

If you think the nerf is going to stop us ... HAHAHAH :)

He has to stay still in order for his target to be highlighted if he moves it will disappear.

They are?

it depends on skill. if i have a kbm i doubt i can kill a console diamond consistently, yore making it seem like kbm makes you have insta headshots and esp.

Jager and Bandit get their ACOGs back, but only for the M870.
---
That is for the starter edition
---
dumb
---
Reporting for toxic behaviour will do absolutely nothing. If you really want to do something you can submit a support ticket and send them video proof. If the video proof is good enough the culprit will be banned.
---
Seems a bit OP but with some tweaking it could be balanced
---
Someone had gone that to me on Hereford base basement, the one with only one doorway, after I started clutching a 1v4
---
Wait, did the G36 lose the acog?

Why shouldn't it be bannable? You're giving yourself an unfair advantage over other players.

How the hell can you possibly be that bad

---
&gt; Glaz was never OP, it was just that people abused him.
---
any operator that can be abused is OP. 
---
From one Glaz to another- it's also assuming that we're going to be unable to hit the targets without the heat signature. I'm either A) Outside holding an angle (windows etc) or B) Advancing (expecting close range enemies). If I'm expecting close range enemies I have a pistol and no need for infrared
---
Good shit, dude
---
I guess...but if you used him as an actual sniper, he was balanced like everyone else.  It's just that you have assholes who make it their life mission to ruin the game for everyone else so they go and abuse shit until it gets nerfed, then they go and abuse the next thing
---
That's match point btw   
---
Holy shit, Johnny! Those fuckers hide in the trees!
---
Nah
---
what if i dont have directional hearing on my shit console because i have shit headphones and someone else has 300 dollar headphones and hes soundwhoring?  what about that senario? time to report people with an advantage over me
---
you can still pick people off like that, they just wont be highlighted bright yellow like before until you stop moving
---
originally he had no highlighting
---
Sadkov Glazkov
---
Eric Andre ftw
---
Yes! A fellow albino Caveria, too bad we are being hunted down to extinction.
---
The neat thing is that you can still snipe with Glaz after the nerf. 
---
I guess that makes sense.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah but the highlighting really helps with my aim for some reason, so it‚Äôll hit me a little harder 
---
TEAM MELEE
---
Funny as hell, but this shouldn't even be allowed
---
sucky ones are more obvious. the nice ones are still there you just have to make an effort to expose them 
---
&gt;How you gonna snipe with blitz he doesn‚Äôt have a sniper dumbass.
---
Ohhhh, I thought there was no wrong way to use an operator.  What happened?  You realized how retarded that is?  There *are* right and wrong ways to use operators.
---
&gt;And no there‚Äôs no right way to use an operator on this game if it seems stupid and it works it‚Äôs not stupid.
---
Oh, ok, so can I snipe with Blitz?  Can I stay outside and snipe people at long range with his pistol?  Yes, I can do that, but does that mean it's the right way to use him?  No, the right way to use him is to rush, same with Glaz.  You *can* rush with him, but is that the right way to use him?  No, it isn't.
---
What should he have there instead?
---
Pretty much all the Ubisoft games occur in the same universe. Ghost recon had crossover missions with both rainbow 6 and splinter cell. There are assassins emblems on Villa. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can find abstergo employees in watch dogs. It‚Äôs pretty much one big universe that‚Äôs all intricately connected. It‚Äôs rather impressive 
---
What's the nerf and can't you just use normal scope for close range?
---
BETRAYAL
---
Twitched him right in the batteries 
---
Exactly.  No more entry fragging fake Glaz mains, now only the real sniping Glaz mains are left.
---
I‚Äôm in love with the colors and style! Great work
---
I was like "waemin, I saw this"
---
Simply, this isn't correct. 
---
This affects as many high level players as it does low level players and has nothing to do with PL. There are as many Ash ACOG players affected in PL as there are unaffected ones.
---
This only works on console lol 
---
in ranked maps he is mostly useless. bad maps like Plane and Favela arent what this game balances operators for. 
---
im dead
---
It isn't as broken as you think it is. 
---
Stay sharp! For smoke and gas, you can find the way out. But for poison, there's no turning back!
---
Thanks!
---
Sure, some sites (usually 1st floor) work amazing with glaz. But most of the time glaz is average or worse of a pick.
---
Nobody expected the meridian to be jammed!
---
This was already the case.
---
The problem is that Glaz's usefulness is directly tied to the availability of smoke grenades, this has been the problem ever since his first rework and now his second nerfs this part of him, from the looks of it without any sort of compensation buff.
---
If they make him damage soft walls like Kaid he could be good and *actually* play kind of like a sniper, and they definitely need to kick his damage back up if they want him to be a sniper too, pushing through smokes is not playing lije a sniper no matter how slowly ypu need to do it. 
---
Nah he's talking about the science. Not the detection. The force (no pun intended). How can something so small generate so much force to push somebody back?
---
I was confused as well.
---
ENTRY FRAGGING ISNT RUSHING WTF???üòÇ and because someone is sitting outside a window holding the bomb stopping a defuse doesnt mean they‚Äôre playing like a mad man, I‚Äôve never seen a glaz rush like an ash so your point is irrelevant. Keep saying ubi said this ubi said that I‚Äôve asked you to prove it show me them quoting how glaz is meant to be used,  they haven‚Äôt. Your play style with glaz is probably the worst thing I‚Äôve heard strategically, anyone with half a brain cell isn‚Äôt going to peak you especially not outside ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What about Bank?  Or Coastline?
---
You can still snipe in Ranked maps, I do it all the time.  If there's no good outside angles you can just go inside and snipe from there.
---
Find a good room far away from Obj and pick off roamers.  
---
You don't gotta entry frag with Glaz to do good with him, it's just that people don't bother learning how to use him the right way
---
Just a little prick! I got you!
---
No.

It did, but now we are back to the old system, so now it's like it was at the start, with free attachments, and no more trap edition.
---
Big oopsie
---
I'm assuming he's just having a scientific discussion. Not an argument over the realism over the game. If that were the case, the title would have read "Nomad's airjabs just don't fit into the realism of the game", in which case, the comments section would be a lot different.
---
Fortunately with the new season you will see a change to menu which includes a beginners playlist, to learn specific maps with fellow newer players. Then make the jump to Casual with all ranks, then finally Ranked. 
---
For now, watch your kill cams and learn common angles, play casual and T-hunt as much as possible. Watch high level players stream or pro league (the Invitationals was recently, watch re-runs on youtube)
---
Lol )) All russian operators - the worst except Glaz (wait for nerf). Finka and Kapkan - least picked, Fuze and Tachanka - not picked at all. Nice
---
Spread the Gu'd Word, my child. 
---
But it's the way he was meant to be played.  I'm done responding to you, with your idiotic "BUT, BUT SNIPING'S BAD REEEEEEE" arguments, and your "BUT UBI DIDN'T SAY THAT, REEEEEE."
---
And your cringy emote+all caps spam
---
Where are the other 9?
---
You can‚Äôt snipe without a sniper üòÇ and no you don‚Äôt rush with blitz because it‚Äôs the right way to use but because it‚Äôs the efficient, same as entry fragging with glaz is efficient and hold the defuse is efficient, however sitting in spawn isn‚Äôt.
---
Nah.  The recoil on her Vector would be too much for an ACOG
---
You‚Äôre washed up
---
Retired
---
I really don‚Äôt think she needs it. Most kills by Mira players come from a relatively short to medium range of playing her correctly. On top of that, I find I RoF weapons a lot easier to control with a 1x sight but that part is just personal preference of course.
---
No need. She is fine as she is. Her Gadget is extremely strong, she has a shotgun for site manipulation and a C4 for denial. No need to give her a buff.
---
If Mira got an ACOG she would easily be the best operator in the game. And if your team didn‚Äôt pick her, you‚Äôd be instantly putting yourself at a disadvantage. 
---
if game sharing is on yes 
---
Not true at all. Good fraggers put on glaz means you cant see him, but he can see you and easily end you. Glaz is in no way "mid tier"
---
Ow nono im drawing operator icons. Check out my procile for example
---
Thinking about who to do next. Any suggestions? 
---
First time? 
---
His DMR ain't so powerful anymore, got a pretty substantial damage nerf.
---
And as for Tachanka being good at holding specific angles, that's true, but just like with Tachanka holding an angle does not help you if the enemy knows the angle is being held, and definitely not when you are on the attcking team and the enemy has no reason to be pushing the angles you are holding. 
---
&gt; some unfair advantages 
---
High ping is a disadvantage on this game.
---
Nomad
---
I tried to make a post about it a while ago but it got removed. Seems like a dumb rule to remove stuff like this from the subreddit.
---
cuz I play doc alot
---
It is a disadvantage just like it is an advantage. And all should be the same imo
---
Not when you shoot them and the brush it off like it was nothing 
---
casual tho ...
---
It's worse on their side.
---
High ping is aids, but the dude with high ping is always at a disadvantage cause of the way the servers handle it. 
---
He missed both of them lol
---
I mean, I don't think they were THAT big. But I ain't complaining lmao.
---
Which mode are you playing and whats your rank?
---
Casual
---
I half expected it to turn into Skyrim after the flash
---
I was like, "why does he have 2 holos?" And then I realized that Mute has the SMG-11, JUSTICE FOR THATCHER, GIVE HIM THE SMG-11
---
I play Casual (I‚Äôve been starting to play Casual only very recently.)
---
I was around Silver/Gold but went low due to soloqueuing.
---
Is she more popular at higher ranks ?
---
So guess what. This means someone in the same game posted this before me! Wrap that around your head. I haven‚Äôt stolen shit so stop with the accusations.
---
Try solo t-hunt with pistol only and headshot only
---
Spasiba, fellow spetsnaz main
---
‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù
---
Vote to kick. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the year of blitz to end 
---
You don't need to pull the pistol. Don't forget that you can just flip down the sight and be left with a nice, no zoom reflex. 
---
Sensitivity 100
---
R6S becomes a Battle Royale game.... *Fuck* 
---
Congratulations, you played yourself. 
---
It was kinda similar for me. I would spend hours on end in terrorist hunt trying to wallbang all the terrorists
---
I had a friend who was like plat 2 based on the fact that people couldn‚Äôt hit him
---
there are discord‚Äôs and other places where you can find a team very easily 
---
Yea she‚Äôs viable because of peoples play styles and strats
---
But taking away her smokes definitely put her down alot
---
I like the ability idea, but rather than 2 swdender gadgets it should be everyone can use it once (like rooks armour) to recover one charge of their ability.
---
Also, 3 speed doesn't seem necessary, maybe a 2-2.
---
I wouldn't be too surprised if they came out with an op like that at some point 
---
Honestly, at short distances I've had much more success with the pistol. The high damage makes everything a 1-2 tap anyway, not much different than the sniper. It's a preference thing... honestly I've gotten damn good with the thermal on and moving around to frag... now that's gone :(
---
Hacker!
---
i think thats too much for an overall nerf
---
I'm not sure you read what I said.
---
I know high ping makes people harder to hit. But what you are ignoring is the fact that high ping gives you dogshit hitreg.
---
High ping all things considered is disadvantage. Unless you wanna try argue with ESL Casters, Pro League players etc about that.
---
No one gonna talk about bandits tap dancing skills?
---
Lmao. You've put the right use of the calculator. Nice
---
Ying is pretty strong at clearing rooms with her flashes but if you‚Äôre going to solo que with her I‚Äôd just be sure to check for teammates before you roll a flash in.
---
Clash is fun to play with occasionally but Nomad is a really good operator
---
The blitz probably had a fun time though 
---
wrong
---
Did ubi release the stats for the the si playlist pick ban?
---
Other people are having fun doing something that *benefits* you. Is that so bad?
---
I'm pretty out of the loop with the KG thing, what did he do?
---
We got a masterracer‚Ñ¢ right here
---
Actually isnt, I Play BFV and it's amazing. 
---
Why does everyone on this sub hate KG? Just wondering why everyone is so surprised he got one, I watch him a decent amount and he seems like a nice guy unless I‚Äôm missing some context
---
They released some of it. Blitz and Lion were banned the most IIRC from the playlist.
---
You‚Äôre finally awak

Dude, I have 800h in this game. I main IQ. Echo is not less of a problem. It's hard to know where his drone is all the time, because you're simply not gonna be running around with your scanner out all the time, it makes you an easy target. It's hard to see his drone on the scanner while you're disoriented.
---
Not a lot of ops have nades, and they took them away from IQ. 
---
Considering half of the time someone won't have a mic or doesn't speak English, it's a pointless strat
---
Don't recommend to learn a game more to someone you don't know. I've been playing since operation health and know more than enough to have an opinion that Echo is OP. Thanks for taking your time, but no. 
---
I mean minus Dobby the tactical elf, it's a pretty dope jungle camo.

---
PLEASE STOP
---
Yeah but ray tracing is only on like 3 games lol. 
---
Seeing as they didn‚Äôt secure the objective, I‚Äôd say we protected it pretty well
---
It's the only use
---
Who‚Äôs next in line
---
It's a good camera
---
No, really... if u check cams and it's gone, then you know that they gone through that doorway.
---
Absolute brilliant.
---
Considering Ghost Recon Wildlands outright doesn't work when using an RTX card in online mode? No, I don't think they will.
---
If I hadn't stated my level I wouldn't have had as much credibility (I know there are much higher level players). Bug fixes should be applied when they are found, IE Castle's server breaking glitch which lagged the match out, instead of waiting 2 months for the next operation. 
---
Every one of those operators have a ONE specific role. Echo has way too many. He is a great anchor. He has his own movable cameras, that can disorient and deny actions. No. He IS OP.
---
Objective was protected by the bait.
---
600 hours and I've apparently missed this entire time lmao
---
Ok clearly you havent been following. There are 21 games that utilize RTX technology and many more will follow. So maybe games can use it and see what happens.

Nice guy lol

Goddamn it why do i need to sub

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused lol I think I‚Äôm missing some context did he do something or?

And what does that mean? I can‚Äôt tell if that is a derogatory connotation or what you‚Äôre trying to say

Can you not insult Pro Players but calling Beaulo, Skittlz, godly etc Pros? Cause they're not Pros.
---
Wow thats terrible.

Even further proof that Ash has ZERO headshot hitbox.

You realize you're the problem -- right? You're the asshole here.

Gotta get Yumi, c.o.b., Anthony Pit, and TuxBird to stream more. D:

And does this mean I'll get the Bnans, AnneMunition, MacieJay, and King George automatically?
---
You hate people because they play on console lmao man what is life like for you

I'd like to add that I'm not talking about thermal scopes, I was talking about carpenter tools haha. I'm not a hunter and totally forgot thermal scopes are a real thing, it makes sense that they'd be useless with low fps!

There's no way game mode elitism is a thing. 
---
Wow you‚Äôre defensive of the pros huh
---
Ur bad
---
No it's 100% the tip
---
Defensive of real Professional Players. Not of random content creators.
---
Mission failed we‚Äôll get em next time
---
Same!
---
Why is it removed
---
Bomb is the best mode and what you should play in ranked. Game mode elitism is, without a doubt, a thing. 
---
cuz he's a toxic pos. look above in the comments there a link to an old thread just an example showing the type of pos he is
---
i'd say it's just as toxic to fall for the bait. Why not rush and secure knowing you have two defenders at the edge of the map. advantage attackers.
---
I agree with you.   Those were great points.  Especially the point about ESL.  Except for the part about Glaz not being usable.  He'll still be usable, just weaker.
---
I was crying of laughter. He rage quit after I did that too
---
That negates the point of her utility. Having to watch it makes it obsolete because it‚Äôs suppose to over you without you looking at it. At that point you‚Äôre just holding an angle on normal flank watch 
---
The nirto cell (c4) has a proximity beeping, you don't need a callout but you need to be able to hear it and so can the attacker, something like that, but the effect also needs to change, a mini echo blast maybe, for like 2-3 seconds with a less pronounced activation noise (when a defender  it)
---
slap an acog and muzzle on the c8 and hope to god you can pull down hard enough
---
That's exactly what I would do, I ptfo not kill chase.
---
r/gatekeeping top thread here.

At this rate, Echo's gonna become the new Ela
---
Still no Bajur charm ;-;
---
Not gonna lie, I‚Äôd love the thought of this when a soft breacher isn‚Äôt available. Yeeting myself through a wall seems like the ultimate big dick hot breach.

Yeah but they said they would never ever bring 3 speed ACOG back on defense

---
&gt;  Game mode elitism is, without a doubt, a thing. 
---
A fucking stupid thing at that. 
---
Bomb is the most competitive and the most balanced sure, doesn't make it the most fun though. For example, it's not fun when it's late at night and all you play against in Bomb are 5 stacks running Lion, Blitz, Dok, Finka etc. 
---
That's not exactly the funnest experience around.
---
Personally I don't see much point in making fun of people for what game mode they play. It's on the same level as making fun of people for their KD.
---
That's amazing!
---
Maybe he will, but I already kinda hate Glaz even though it's my most played operator. I doubt I will be playing Glaz very much after the update if it goes through as is.
---
That was disgusting. I love it
---
I watch george a lot and i've never seen him be toxic to others, he usually queue's as a 5 so he never encounters random players, every streamer has "toxic" moments and people are just linking old drama. 
---
That‚Äôs what makes him echo though he has a drone with a camera, and a disorienting effect he is no more of a better anchor than maestro. He is not that op you just do not understand how to play against an echo
---
*tree rustles*
---
you don't understand the pilot program, jesus, they will get their shit when the new batch is released
---
Seriously, how the fuck did that comment get 40 upvotes? Lol
---
Post title is golden. üíØ
---
Are you really questioning an old religious/spiritual belief? I didn't write this shit.
---
The way he was in para bellum is best. It had a lot of recoil and you had to use him a lot and get good with him to properly use the gadget
---
I've gotten spawnpeeked from this angle. Never knew it was possible. I was just running by towards the Garage door and didn't even try to contest the angle lol. So unlucky.
---
Yes that's how Siege works. What platform do you play on? I've noticed that the Siege playerbase is a lot more toxic on consoles (though I can only speak for XB1 from my own experiences on console) than PC . It might be something to do with PC players generally being a bit older.
---
people hate George because of like 1 or 2 clips of him being "toxic" reddit does not let things go they let short clips develop their opinion, even though they have never watched George's stream for longer than 2 minutes.  George's stream is nice and entertaining and i never see anything toxic.
---
Yeah man whatever. I know it takes time, but you just can't come up saying that is your own design and publishing it to thousands of people on reddit. This channel has 590k subscribers. It would be different if you did it for yourself or for job looking purposes. 
---
An toxic or not he is one of the must watched R6 streamers. 
---
Many do
---
You are a shite player if you run blitz after getting spanked 
---
Oh I would never make fun of people for their KD. I was a potato at the start ( and still am a bit) but my ranked KD is 0.8 when it could certainly be much higher. But I am a bomb elitist. If I see someone who gets an ace on Secure, it's like, good on you for getting an ace, but I am disappointed you didn't do it in bomb. 
---
Can we please leave this at 666 upvotes?
---
You released the kraken! Never release the kraken man...
---
The issue with manual detonation is precisely the reason why cap doesn't have healing bolts- unlike on defense, attackers CANNOT pay attention to the traps they set. The traps they set are  to watch their flanks. If attackers are going to watch their flanks themselves, why even have flank watching gadgets? Added to that, if you are going to throw and manually detinate, even after 1.5 seconds, might as bring grenades. Why special airjabs? Makes nomad illogical and useless.
---
However, there is one aspect of your suggestion, that, has been suggested by macie Jay before, and is the simplest change you can make to instantaneously change her from OP state to balanced state by allowing for 90% counter play- nitro cell beeping sound. A sound similar to a Nitro cell beeping signals defenders that impending doom is approaching, but allows them to back off. Beeping sound for 2 seconds, then detonate. That way, defenders can run, and airjabs will no longer be invisible claymores.
---
That's just depressing ....

---
that‚Äôs not good i‚Äôm planning on buying fuze‚Äôs elite skin tonight
---
I want to say its mostly that the devs don't play the game a whole lot, and his stats are pretty deceiving compared to how he really plays.
---
I've said it so many time: Having an operator where you best chance at surviving an engagement against them is to run and beg your teammates for help is a huge issue. If you have to fight him alone, you're dead.
---
Yea his is pretty sweet for sure!
---
Be the change you want to see in the world. Because I'm too fucking lazy.
---
So that's what those buttons on the Mad Catz controllers do.
---
If you love the iron sights, then use them!   There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, so long as you can still play competitively.
---
However there is literally no reason to not use a front grip or a muzzle attachment.   Even if you have recoil mastered, equip a vertical grip for increased ads time.  Just putting yourself at a disadvantage.
---
Sweaty ops lol
---
I'm planning on buying the hibana elite once it comes out. So yeah.

I mean...*this* is why people shit on console gamers so much. This is so, so, so, so pathetically bad.

and now go into realistic
---
Just give us Bajur and we‚Äôll all be happy.
---
Surprisingly not actually! I thought so too, but when I switched to PC I started winning matches much easier. I don't know if it was because I'm originally a PC guy or not but I always had it worse on console.
---
Who cares, he never types or interacts with anyone that he is not queued with, the only way those players he is playing against know that he is flaming is by watching his stream, so stream sniping, also in high elo it is gentleman agreement to not use bb or blitz
---
it could be the tension between the countries in your area

I think I remember some shit like this happening a long time ago, how long have you had this footage

Jeez I was just bored in Spanish I didn‚Äôt expect people to actually like these!

Less game sense as typically your average console player is playing in a relaxed position further away from a larger screen, resulting in a lower periphery.

Learn the maps and the operators. Even if you don‚Äôt like them, get a good 10-15 rounds in with every operator and at least shoot every weapon. It will make you more well rounded and understanding their limitations.

Lucky enough to have to tilt my head sideways? no

so, on top of frustrating One shot headshot, you want another frustrating thing - Sniper rifle....
---
Yeah, go sub to Shroud and watch him play mostly Apex to get a Siege charm. I get why they gave one to Shroud, he's entertaining to watch because of his aim skill and he brings a lot of exposure to Siege. However, he's not what I would call a Siege streamer, he just plays whatever BR game is hot at the moment and occasionally dips into Siege. I can think of a lot of other streamers who are more deserving: NarcolepticNugget, Matimi0, VarsityGaming, etc.

You know i am level 111 and silver 1 but if you want you can play sometimes in my sqaud because there is always one guy missing :)

I am on PC and I use ShadowPlay with Nvidia
---
Point is it's a persona for stream, a persona that really isn't a big deal. Everyone rages at games (anyone who denies that  is a liar) his persona is an amplified version of that. 
---
Really? How fucking stupid and immature can you be? LMAO bye
---
This is great. Best content I‚Äôve seen on this sub in a while.
---
Mute looks to tall. UNSEEABLE
---
I‚Äôd actually be ok with that. A friend of mine mentioned the same idea. 
---
He also had the idea to make all melee not a OHK and actually drop the dmg to 35 per swing.
---
I‚Äôd also like to see shield knock back get removed as well.
---
It's also only got two rounds and is basically only a one-shot within the same room and no acog.
---
Just let him have his fun guys
---
It is a weird start I will admit, for some reason I also think it‚Äôs more of a funny situation on console because multiple times I‚Äôve TK‚Äôd (or been TK‚Äôd by) one of my friends by simply having the controller on my lap and leaning forward and the trigger gets pushed in and bam, someone‚Äôs dead. I find it hilarious but seems also harder to accidentally do PC? 
---
Either way it is definitely an overlooked ‚Äúissue‚Äù I guess and happens a lot more on console I would assume. Would be nice to see it fixed or adjusted, whichever. 
---
Poor Free Weekenders....   they have no clue what just happened!

What matters is that he asked people on discord to mass downvote a thread showing the truth and then edited the message to save his face when people started calling him out

But let's not start another drama around queen george, it's getting pretty boring.

I'd also like to see new animations for operators that never got this treatment like The FBI and Germans.

Agreed. Been a sub to him for a long time. He's a good guy. reddit just like to cherrypick shit and virtue signal about how much they hate him. Most of the time him "raging" or being "salty" is done jokingly. Yes, he has done some dumb shit like the streamsniper guy, but all in all he's probably the most dedicated R6 streamer and he consistently has 3-4k viewers every night.
---
The devs themselves said that staying still in a game like siege is bad. That‚Äôs why Tachanka is getting reworked 
---
Defusing the defuser*

Diffuse means something entirely different.

Let's bring it to the next level. Full on level editor to pose them how you like. Cav sneaking up on someone in Bartlett? Done. Maestro eating copious amounts of spaghetti? Done.

I'm only in low gold so it's not super cancerous but it's very much there
---
You can see it in the recoil control (which is damn near perfect), and the snaps. I‚Äôve played with people who have admitted it, and it is really noticable once you know what to look for.
---
Yeah I see what you mean. I started playing Seige in Grim Sky but I knew of the game before that because of YouTube. Nowadays I just dont want to play anymore because of tryhards in Casual and toxic team killing 
---
Jesus, how thirsty do you have to be to lust after a colored-in outline of a ridiculously sexualized caricature of a video game character?
---
TWOBAD CHARM DOOD!!!!!
---
I mean, you only get like 25 less points if they outright take the kill. I think it's the same points if the enemy gets injured, even if you don't injure them. 
---
*Dont quote me on that

George and pengu's hours are close (kind of) with pengu sitting around 10,000 as he said and George is at about 7500 last time he checked I believe? Both players are extremely dedicated to the game and I think both of them deserve a charm and I'm sure pengu will get one eventually 
---
They don‚Äôt want their secrets leaked. 
---
No nerfs yet.
---
I think Mozzie is balanced but I personally expect Gridlock to lose one of her traps at some point. IMHO three is too much considering how few flanks you actively have to worry about in most matches.
---
A more interesting nerf to her that I've heard suggested is slow walking would allow you to walk over the traps, the idea being you are walking in between them at the cost of speed. With that I can see her keeping all three.
---
With how this game is balanced for the majority of items it always seems like you aren't actually "spending" them until you only have two, it always feel like the first is a freebie and only with the last two are you impacting your role if you use them wrong. Mute and Bandit would be the exceptions to this idea though.
---
i dont own a ps4 butbwouldnt waste my money on the game a second time. my name is Bent_On_Border_ look me up on r6 tracker if u need proof that im bad and or pc
---
Imo, there shouldn‚Äôt be an ability to use the usb ports to play then. If you can‚Äôt fix it, don‚Äôt make it an option. Everyone has dualshock controllers already, so you wouldn‚Äôt deprive anyone by making it bluetooth only. At least for competitive games like R6.
---
I can agree on the chunky meatball man point but not the hot Spanish teacher one. We get dokk harassing echo because he‚Äôs fat as hell and gridlock on the other side supporting him
---
I‚Äôm none of them :D
---
Hahahah. Its Mozzie!
---
I like her old face personally looked terrifying.
---
I‚Äôm reuploading the video as soon as the moderators reply
---
Not Ubi, but the Sony can. Just dont make the game playable through USB ports for ranked at least.
---
And sorry, I haven‚Äôt followed this thread closely so I didn‚Äôt know whether it is a really talked about issue.
---
Actually no sarcasm here, just out of the loop. Why doesn't Tuxbird get one if Bikini do?
---
This post was made by thermite gang
---
Its way at the bottom I told you what the question was in my other comment
---
You have Kansas and Arkansas! Explain America!
---
If they change my Mira... the consequences will never be the same.
---
Dang, I'm sad neither varsity, nugget, or matimi0 still aren't getting anything. Still, it's nice to see a non-English streamer get a charm! Feel like it's important not to neglect the international part of siege. 
---
thermite and habana do the same thing but one does it a little differently. If Ubisoft wants to have a hundred operators then there's going to be some overlap. bandit and mute do the same thing, mute is more passive, he doesn't destroy drones or breach/thermite charges.  
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Exactly, pc people tend to be faster at turning around and shooting the evil eye 
---
Exactly
---
The video is 30 seconds long 
---
Is this confirmed? If so, I‚ÄôM EXCITED AS FUCK!
---
yeah having a mixture or something. If Ubisoft wants to have hundred operators there is going to be some overlap.
---
thanks
---
Start it at the kill
---
Very clean. Bravo to you my good sir
---
if there is anything you want to add on or change let me know.
---
Thanks for your comment. Some people just got pissed because I didn‚Äôt know this. I hope that Sony &amp; Microsoft see that this pisses the majority of the players off. The thing is that it is very fixable, which makes me mad. 
---
&gt; badahonkedidilyblonkers
---
That‚Äôs a new one.
---
I unfollowed his stream because every time he got killed it was  from some "trash kid," and KG would scream "WHY IS HE EVEN THERE?!!!  WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH!"
---
Got so old, and annoying.  Just take the L and give respect where it's due.  Not everyone is trash, and you aren't above being legitimately beat.
---
"If she's 13 I'm 13"
---
But this would make many aces less than 30 seconds, Its just my opinion that aces should be counted from The start of the round 
---
What about the prep phase?
---
Exactly, even when its only 2v1 I tell the other person lets both go in different ways at the exact same time, but nope they decide they want to go in before I can get to the other way in, then they die

Here's the Mega Thread. scroll down until you see "Playlist changes"
---
For the record I'm not downvoting anyone. I'm merely disagreeing with your definition. Fooling around *passively* hurts the team, it means you're dead weight at worst but you're not doing anything that obstructs anyone else from playing the game how they wish.   
---
A Rook placing armour outside causing me to face armoured attackers, that is *actively* hurting my team and that's what I call toxic, and of course that's alongside all the obvious parts like bleeding or destroying gadgets, or writing your team's locations in chat.    
---
But merely being ineffective, that's passive, therefore not toxic.  
---
His name os GiantWaffle 
---
Don't count prep phase unless you want to as twitch. The ace time should be started when you can move around and kill with the enemy with a gun
---
I'm sorry people like the art???
---
I start it from the kill but, your call man.
---
Yeh
---
Running all the way outside to bait people and using your equipment 100m from the closest entrance to the building let alone the objective is pretty toxic if you ask me.... Not helping actual gameplay at all. Hilarious, and these kids are dumb for falling for it, but imo definitely a toxic move. And i don't tend to agree with a lot of what people call toxic.
