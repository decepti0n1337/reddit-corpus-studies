Already got it a year ago.

---
Did another account on your ps4 have ps plus?
---
lol as I drop 5 and win the round. yeah you're right.
---
People get *bad-word* over the stupidest things. I know this doesn’t go with the flow of the post, but I’m on with them reusing guns. It would be even better if they did what you said.
---
Where's the source on this?
---
Actually yes, it ended a while ago, it was my brothers account.
---
Maybe try getting the trial on another account then activating that account as primary PS4? Not sure if it’ll work but you could give it a try
---
Nice ,I can never control that, usually just use the pistol.
---
I forgive you, fellow redditor. I have made mistakes like this in the past. I just keep in mind to have a more positive outlook when commenting and BAM! karma but more importantly the smiles on random people’s faces.
---
But Tachanka on Bomb Defusal tho
---
Ps plus is shared across the console. So if one account has it every can play online. So if that account no longer has it then you might have to buy ps plus
---
I would honestly dig a "hella casual" rotation with house, plane, favela &amp; old hereford.
---
well yeah, they still want you to buy them with real money.
---
Lol right? Dw I’ve just been skimming his angry old man white suprematist paragraphs. I pick my fights &amp; this pathetic person is 110% not worth it.
---
Yeah I hear you, every pack is alittle over 12K Renown each
---
Pool selection was a thing in the past and resulted in horrendous queue times unfortunately.
---
Yeah I agree I am ok with them reuseing guns I just also think this is a cool idea that makes all parties happy, thank you for your feedback and have a good day or night!
---
HAHA even better then i could ever fucking imagine, dude I love you!
---

---
Thanks for tagging me to see his beautiful image

https://www.quora.com/Does-Rainbow-6-Siege-need-PS-Plus
---
I can only find forums of people that ask the same question and get the same answer. I also don’t have ps plus and I’m not game sharing with anyone, yet it allows me to play siege. Same for most of my friends.
---
A wise man once said
---
"Git gud"
---
thx!
---
Yeah, just pissed at the bl3 sub rn and I didn't comment as I should have
---
Or you get those fucking mozzies that can trick shot your drone from like across the room. Idk how they do it.
---
Even more stupid than using the fmg with suppressor on smoke?
---
Ahhhh... 
---
Have a good night/day yourself!
---
Cheers
---
Hey the white knights here, just in time!
---
i might have encouraged him to do this
---
I’m glad you like it LOL
---
Thank you!
---
straight added to my saves
---
Did I say I was an old fuck or are you being ageist? Just because I’m not a dumbass high schooler and have my own opinions doesn’t mean I’m 70 and worried about my AARP discounts or something. Again, you’re stupid.
---
Damn really? Which comment? Giving that brave guy an upvote for his heroism and being able to give me quite the chuckle.
---
I hear you. Don’t worry though it’s all in the past. Forgive and forget. If you want I can delete my responses to you deleted response so it’ll look like nothing happened. Your call.
---
It happens on all platforms, it depends on what elo you are on in casual
---
how could i not like it haha
---
Same. Accidentally impacted myself and a teammate as soon as they went for the plate. Felt so bad
---
That’s if mozzie uses it before round starts and brings it back inside
---
Well it looks cool
---
I just see this as you wasting your own drone
---
I didn't know that it has already been tried! Was it so doomed that it's not even worth to try to fix it?
---
Yeah, dlc ops cost anywhere from 10k-25k renown (in game currency) per operator, depending on how old they are. You get around 1k renown per hour of play time, and we’re around 50 operators strong. It’s definitely worth you time to spend a little extra cash if you’re gonna get into this game.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn
---
This is a good idea but there would be that person who uses this to put nsfw on weapons, likely the p90 due to the open space on it. But other than the reason above I said there would be no reason to not add this to r6!
---
Nah I deleted my comment. Well have a good day sir. Thanks
---
not OP, but I'll chime in. I love siege (lvl 119 or something), but don't enjoy playing in sweaty lobbies all the time. On X1, lot's of ranked players are using kb&amp;m and are super shitty if you're not up to par with high-level tactics and strats. I'm older as well and don't play FPS nearly as competitive as I once did.
---
Casual def. has it's fair share of BS, but it's still an overall fun experience.
---
No problem dude. Keep smiling.
---
I mean kinda their fault for all rushing main entrance, unless they're new, then it's a dick move
---
On a controller too mate, right?
---
If so than this is some priest level gameplay.
---
No guns, just a mop and a bulletproof bucket on their head with slits for the eyes. I would honestly main them, that sounds fun af.
---
Not really tried. It still is a thing for T-Hunt. At some point they decided it wasn't worth keeping I guess. Somewhat a bummer but then again understandable.
---
Thanks bro! And yes, normal PS4 controller.
---
It be like that sometimes I have been accused of this after a wall bang at one point
---
The 100% cpu is a weird bug in the game but running anything 100% doesnt affect the CPU as long as your pc has good cooling and power. 
---
Might wanna try something like /r/techsupport
---
Ok bet
---
Thanks man
---
A late summon to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
Is it Survive Doc’s Spawnpeek?
---
God damn it Ubi.
---
Sounds about right
---
That's the whole idea of it
---
Maybe next April fools event, but not till then.
---
No ot helps me and its ummmmm it is realistic
---
When is the event out?
---
And this was just meant to be a dumb funny post... you’re the fun guy at parties right?
---
*cries in holo Buck*
---
By upping is rof of course :D that will fix EVERYTHING! 
---
......
---
^(no it won’t)
---
If you shoot it it will fall
---
its cool xD, can i steal it? for a video
---
Literally just bought 5 packs not knowing that too
---
Ok thanks
---
Ultimate edition worth it in your opinion?
---
WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO FIND AN UNRANKED GAME! IM TIRED OF PLAYING WITH TOXIC CASUALS. Literally ever game smh...
---
BRO I LITERALLY JUST SPENT 100K ON REGULAR PACKS LAST NIGHT JGUAIQBRBXKLAJSBDKAJDB
---
Welp, there go my plans to get kaid sometime
---
That’s stupidly overpriced
---
thanks dude
---
ok copper🤡thanks for your input that had nothing to do with the video🤡
---
*pulls out condoms* WHOS FIRST
---
This is really good!
---
Speaking of ash I feel like her hit box is bullshit
---
That so scary maybe a halloween event easter egg
---
The only thing is that there are tons of things they probably have planned before they decided to do something about this. The biggest challenge about changing this would finding a way to naturally repel any loose debris without it getting stuck on the barricade and ultimately not being resolved. The way they would probably implement it in a way that the loose debris would be repelled from the window until it hits a solid object, and then it would fall from the game's physics engines. Since the barricade counts as a solid object though, they have to make sure they can implement it in a way so that the game and server doesn't have an edge case of the debris sometimes counting said barricade its coming off of as a solid object that it just hit and then end up not being repelled from the window.
---
Could've sat on the cam instead
---
Damn that’s sick!
---
If you want to avoid the grind for the operators and get instant access to the new ones coming for the last season this year and want to play a shit ton, yes. Although I would say the grind can be a worthy part of this game too and even more so as they have started discounting operators depending on how old they are.
---
Hopefully. Last year they allowed you to buy the Halloween outfits from previous years.
---
Don't mean to kick you while you're down, but, front window on House
---
385 RPM that's how!
---
Epic bad steam good?
---
Thats xbox for ya.
---
There's only one way to learn to watch for this runout if you're new. If they weren't new, shame on them.
---
Revert thermals, reverse damage drop off, increase ROF.
---
Pre-nerf thermals allow him to snipe targets more effectively than other DMR operators (as originally intended) (could even increase his magnification more, further encouraging distance shooting and making the thermal optic less viable in CQC)
---
Reverse damage drop off means the farther he is, the more damage he can do (incentivizing his use as a sniper). In CQC his rifle overpenetrates the target, dealing less damage.
---
Increasing the ROF allows him more adaptability when he needs to move inside the building or clutch obj. He’ll deal less damage but can still throw rounds fast enough to hold up against other operators.
---
What a shitty battery
---
Are you trying to tell me that players have actual brains that allow them to make their own decisions rather than there being some kind of hive mind controlling every player on each platform? /s
---
Technically you pixel peeked too.
---
pc - brazil, same thing
---
Happy cakeday!
---
Wake up
---
It’s your cake day as well!!! I love your work! Keep it up!!
---
YEHAW LIKE FISH INNA BARREL
---
What the fuck ubi
---
I really like casual still, and I dont mind those maps, I just dislike how there is less maps now so you don't do as many different ones.
---
what? it's a map rotation. it rotates every month. it's exactly as long as they said it would be.
---
WHATS THE DIFFERENCE
---
Ela mines are really quite good almost as good or better thanLesion mines depending on who you ask. Also taking into account that she's a trap operator and trap ops are usually high on these deltas because nobody seems to expect them at the higher tiers of play. I would suggest that Ubi nerf some aspect of Ela's mines while also slightly buffing her SMG since the shotgun is being picked a lot more than it due to the shotgun's reliability
---
That's not a flaw. That's a way to make sure he's not completely invulnerable. It's the attacker's way of baiting out your utility.
---
I'm sorry mr. Blitz main. 
---
RIP shield mains.
---
u/Offical_McWubbin is his account. Just sort controversial comments and hes at the top lol
---
I’m talking more of just the world around you reacting like it would in real life. They dissolve the wood to improve performance since each of those chunks create new objects so that they can individually move around the world independent of each other. Like I said, they like to keep it as realistic as possible within reason.
---
It is worth it. Although for some weird reason, my main and alt account are always close to the same rank, regardless of solo queue or 5 stack.
---
You seem overly defensive replying to every m&amp;k accusation even though they aren’t aimed at you..
---
As a Ubisoft dev, I chuckled at this thread way more than I'd like to admit
---
354 points, damn Ubi, why you so savage?
---
I thought you were only supposed to lose points when cheaters were involved.
---
What’s the point of Reddit if I’m not going to reply? It’s all over the sub.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
First - his weapon was the worst weapon in entire Siege for years now (right after big damage nerf in Velvet Shell)
---
Second - dedicated sniper role not exist in Siege, because everyone with ACOG are basically snipers
---
Third - Siege is about CQB and Glaz sucks at CQB because no full-auto weapon and his shitty DMR. Pre-nerf Glaz was useful around 20-30 secs and only in smokes. No smokes = pretty easy target for anybody.
---
Fourth - Ubi can say everything, but Glaz is all about kills. Thermal are bad instrument for gathering info (if you see enemy in thermal sight, you better shoot and kill him) and holding angles role suppose to kill entering enemies.
---
FILTERED WORD?
---
Just wait till u start getting matched with other smurfs.
---
[deleted]
---
That's #realistic though. :p
---
Oh and when paintings and wood panels get stuck in the mirrors. Annoying as hell.
---
What exactly is the reason they don't just give window debris no clip after being destroyed? I know it's probably not as simple as toggling it in csgo but is there really a gameplay enhancing reason to keeping it in if it's like this? You could argue immersion but I feel like I'd be more immersed if something I bunched actually moved from where it originally was and not just block by view
---
My use of services does not invalidate concerns of a Chinese tech company's buying into western tech companies.
---
u/Dats_and_Cogs is right, I literally said what you copypasted. Getflanked, Core Ross, and rogue9 have been speculating about the changes and considering ubi brought them to the place where they balance the game I think they’re reliable
---
Thanks brother , sometimes you just gotta take one for your brothers in arms
---
Imma ask epi for clarification they also will be monitoring her in pro league if she does well at their level she wont see a change.
---
also /u/Brodie_bradley explain to these idiots
---
Well that makes sense. His ability is fundamentally broken in a game with 1shot head shot
---
He was fine before his scope magically stops working while moving
---
I'm down
---
then what would be the point of jager
---
Thank you
---
What was I supposed to guess, had your name not been u/XX_CLIT_SPANKER_XX
---
How much elo did you gain god damn
---
Ubisoft never goes back and buff or nerf something the way it was used to. They change something else instead who know why
---
Just blow on your monitor.
---
You have literally no idea how hard or easy it would be to implement any of these solutions. According to the most recent interview with devs,  they struggle a lot with legacy code in this game due to it being an old single player engine and almost 4 years old itself
---
*breathing intensifies*
---
What confuses me is why they can’t just have client side debris affected by further melees or bullets.
---
Yeah could be worse... but if my parents and life has taught me anything, it’s it’s either the best or last. And the best loadout isn’t the fmg.
---
Do y’all remember when this shit never happened back in like year 1-2
---
Amazing times, I have no idea how they managed to fuck it up for 2 years straight
---
No, it’s been there since the map released.
---
Absolutely, your peripherals matter so much. You'll never see a high level player without top gear. Tbh you buy a lot of rank in Siege.
---
Every time I upgraded, my level of play was higher. Ever since I started using 144hz monitor, I've been gunning like crazy.
---
I still hate this because it’s gambling. I don’t mind spending $15-$20 to buy the skin I want directly. The only skin I actually like is Kapkan’s, I don’t want to gamble for it, and I’d gladly pay $20 to buy it, because I think a skin that awesome with a weapon skin and charm is totally worth that money.
---
No already here before.
---
Just use the Xbox game bar, it’s already built in and there’s a hotkey for its overlay in games
---
&gt; there must be some limitation to that, otherwise Ubi would do it.
---
Or they just did it quick and dirty and haven't bothered trying to fix it
---
Could also be unlucky/ your region.
---
In GTA online I usually made friends with randoms and just had fun experiences, where my mate only over got dicked over and killed on repeat
---
&gt;Not a lot of players care about this particular issue. 
---
false
---
I have an inherent hatred for this map, which is probably why I didn't notice lol.
---
[removed]
---
Wait for a sale. Yes.
---
People also get pissed if servers are down for even a second
---
Exactly. Plenty of people seem to miss the point that putting these skins in limited time lootboxes is just their lazy way of trying to squeeze more money out of it's playerbase. We all know damn well they could make them purchasable with Renown and R6 Credits like the first Halloween event but nooo, they just *have* to get every penny out of every player that wants the skins.
---
I'm curious why not hit it again?
---
Bird of Prey - Legendary.
---
Damn. Those some bad plats
---
ACOG is probably best suited for it, because it is a high recoil high damage gun, and it's quite hard to use if you can't headshot. Honestly, if you can't control the recoil, you might want to try another gun, like the L85A2, and you can fulfill the same roles while playing Sledge.
---
Twelve c’s thiccccccccccccness
---
If you quit matches often or kick/tk your tean often you get in a group pool of more toxic players
---

---
True dat
---
Oh nice, I love running tactical skins.
---
Because penthouse is the most viable site? Double bar is more exposed to the outside then other sites. Hooka is better than double bars, but still not as good as pent-theatre. The entrances to pent-theatre are through either 90 or choke points like trophy an bathroom, which can be easily choked with defender utility, delaying attackers again. Hooka and double bars don't have that luxury. Any and every choke point for those 2 sites has an easy escape and rotation elsewhere.
---
Why else do you think it *was* the highest pick in PL until this season?
---
Yea dude screw Ash players
---
Get a 5 man squad—with ALL of you having ACTIVE renown boosters—-and set the match settings to EXTRACT Hostage ONLY.
---
Then the limit the map choice to either HOUSE ONLY or OUTBACK ONLY. (House is the classic option but I’m told Outback features no bombers and Nitro Cells)
---
Set the difficulty to Hard—Realistic features wall hacking A.I. 
---
Memorize the spawn points. They all have corresponding rooms. 
---
Make the rounds last at least 60 seconds to avoid getting 0 renown.
---
Easy 3K in about 10-12 min.
---
 Lastly, I do believe there is a daily limit to how much renown an individual can acquire in a day, though I am not sure the exact amount. I’m sure you’re good to hoard to at least 25K a day, but like I said I don’t know the exact number regarding daily limits. You’re welcome.
---
&gt;As a dipshit
---
*Nani*?
---
He just sprints as a faster dipsh*t.
---
Why? This works in their favor.
---
People spend renown on two things:
---
1. Operators
---
2. Cosmetics
---
People seeing this are going to play more and burn their renown on these packs and likely get not much out of it long term. That renown is gone. It takes a bit to actually gain hundreds of thousands of renown and spending them on packs its like the lowest return you get out of it. Bottom line for Ubi is that the less renown people have overall the more likely the will spend real money on stuff.
---
Like what if the premium line of Battlepass can be bought with renown as well as cash? At the end of the day Ubisoft has been for years trying to make players spend their renown down to improve the actual $ they make from cosmetics and season passes. And its not enough so the battlepass exists now to triple or quadruple dip.
---
Same here man, same here.
---
Interesting. I haven’t considered that the games been out for almost 5 years. My illogical emotion is, you’ve played the game long enough to be lvl 300, gtfo of my first few matches in the damn game! I enjoy testing my metal against players similar to me, not some guy who’s map knowledge is more extensive than I ever plan to reach. The more I think about it the more I realize it’s a pointless complaint, thx for the feedback.
---
That's the part I dislike about Maverick. I main maverick but I feel like CAG could have had a better rep. If anything he seems to look more like an SF guy if anything.
---
also i just re watched your clip and you peek things without aiming in which hurts you a lot. like when you peek something you should be aiming and dragging your sight until you hit the corner if you know what i’m saying also try aiming a bit higher. hope it improves your gameplay a bit
---
Pussy shock
---
Are we *still* whining about not getting a plague doctor skin? At this point it should be considered spam and you should end up with a temp ban from the sub. It's getting actually fucking ridiculous.
---
And thats why proleague on consoles doesn't exist anymore.
---
I can see how that could be true but what about map knowledge?
---
Original artist is [Breaking Spines](https://twitter.com/iridescent_bats), or /u/milkythorns
---
It usually moves after you get blasted through the barricade
---
The most I've ever done so far is I've accidentally shot someone in the foot with Mozzie's thing.
---
&gt;Tfw it's not plague doctor &gt;:(
---
Just fucking stop, please.
---
Rainbow Six Siege is having seasonal events? Well they obviously stole it from Overwatch! /s
---
There's no bombers in t hunt anymore
---
I’m sorry, I don’t know how I offended you, however I will request skins I think will look cool, fuck off...
---
And my question was already answered too....neutrally mind you, unlike your bullshit.....
---
The ageist shit was obviously sarcasm you daft turd. Anonymous internet shit allows people to spew stupid comments... like cultural appropriation is a thing and only a thing that white people do. Fact check, it isn’t real and their stupid idea of what it is isn’t something that only white people do. Just because people can say stupid shit and not get called out on their ignorance by people like you doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be called the fuck out. So what if she’s a fucking girl, you going to save her from big bad online bullying? You’re not virtuous and being a whiney white knighting faggot won’t get you laid. Fuck you pussy
---
It's better than those stoic reactionless ones where the player is like "yea this is the norm for me because I'm THAT good"
---
Battleye only supports PC services and doesnt have a console version of the anticheat.

For once

---
A peak is like a mountain peak not a peek with your eyes.
---
Dont they nocollide each other when the barricade is completely broken though
---
Yea
---
Im sick of smashing the bottom part of a window so i can peek only for it to be covered up by fucking glass a second later
---
How is it fake if he made a vid on it
---
?? not sure what the original commenter is on about cause no one is using a laser on this video.
---
Scorpion, my friend. Somehow, Ubi doesn’t care about rebalancing that thing to make Ela compete with other roamers more efficiently.
---
Her winrate’s situation is like with Kapkan and Frost: it works, when it’s not in every game. The thing is that Ela “meta-wise” is supposed to be a dangerous roamer, having a decent gadget. But since her Scorpion is bad(recoil wise, DPS is fine because of high ROF), and shotgun works only  aggressive plays(something what you cannot make working every time), Ela is where she is:(
---
so is 12 meters
---
I live in a college, and my internet is really shitty, i also had Escape From Tarkov running in the background because i forgot to close it, but otherwise, at home its 80fps - 3840x2160🤷🏻‍♂️
---
300 r6 credits / 12500 renown a pack or 8600 r6 credits / 350,000 renown for everything
---
Wow a halloween event thats before Halloween good job ubi
---
I’m gonna quick peek myself irl now
---
And Bartlett U
---
I sent the same message a few times.. it apparently only replies with “What are you? Twelve?” and “Its okay, I won’t judge. It’s a normal stage of life.”
---
Actually I think they do
---
But this was at the cost of killing Ela. Not entirely, but still....
---
So if you die in blue bar and call out “double bar” and your teammate goes sunrise and dies from getting shot In the back what happens then?
---
There's only 2 types of doors that can be barricaded, physics simulations take way more performance off the game and it wouldn't be unrealistic, it would just be consistent.
---
Strict casual player and I hate this, I die to it regularly.
---
IQ of course
---
Just Monika... Weiss
---
Plat 2 or 3 based on their operators and your play style?
---
Yes, but he doesn't get shit on
---
r4-c and 416-c
---
spawn peeks but can't aim for shit yeah that's about right
---
You also can't say "PSA" in the title.
---
Console has V-Sync, which caps it at 30
---
No, why would Ubi?
---
let me / let me / let me / let me get what I want this time
---
Here's an idea, don't waste your done and just shoot the pest.
---
Now that's epic

•buffed US women's national team

Of course.

r/thatswhatshesaid
---
to be fair the Apex event is *ending* before Halloween so it could be worse
---
yes pls
---
Well, that's awful news. My least favorite maps are Tower and House.
---
Then it should be possible to do it and we can chalk it up to ubisoft being lazy as usual
---
It honestly looked like the ash saw the edd and accepted their fate at losing the round but wanted to go out explosively with you and was motioning for you to scoot closer.
---
If a teammate takes down a barricade then castle gets it back. If its destroyed with explosive its expended
---
Great precision.
---
I got Plane... Twice. I never alt-F4'd harder faster.
---
don't worry all people in the same armor class move at the exact same speed, except the 3 armored shield operators and blackbeard, they move slower than their non shield counterparts
---
But in my opinion I feel a lot more comfortable with Bandit's SMG over Jager's AR, and have gotten fair use out of both of their gadgets so I usually prefer Bandit. but at least both of them have the M870 shotgun in case you wanna grab a buddy and go M870 bros, and the P12 to me is my favorite pistol, with decent damage, magazine size, and being easy to spam.
---
At least having a cosmetic effect where the black mirror goes white for a second. It can flash the mirror itself , but not the player behind it so it can buff stun grenades by not allowing Mira to see through for like 1 second.
---
inb4 alpha pack only legendary
---
Valk Elite is the best imo, but from this four it's Confidential
---
For those you should be able to run face-first into the barricade and knock the pieces off.
---
Stealing kill is a non team play. When in team, win is what counts. Chasing frags is non important in team play.
---
Technically it can be a nerf by having the flash make her black mirror go white so the player behind it can’t see through it for 1 second.
---
ITS WORSE NOW!&gt;!.
---
Yehehe boyyyyy ;)
---
Agreed, I like the glaz idea but Mira is in a good place rn
---
Geode for sure.
---
ITT: A bunch of people who don't program video games talking about how easy it would be to reprogram this video game.

Nøkk for stealth gameplay, anti-intel roam hunting.

Amaru for the YEET-gameplay (she is nice, but Nøkk has more use, even if both are relativ weak)
---
Hacused*
---
lol i cant even remember when there was nice seasonal skin expect this one
---
Patch your aim first.
---
Theres two different issues here. A: Destruction. B: Sync.
---
The Destruction needs to be fixed for the wooden doesnt get stuck. The Sync needs to be server sided so if it does get stuck, its stuck for the whole server.
---
If all 10 players see the same thing, thats fine. Right now OP cant see the other side while majority of the other players can see op since the wood is not stuck on the barricade for them.
---
5$ for 2 charms what a steal
---
NO  we have to ban no no words Because that's much more important  
---
\*Ubisoft probably\*
---
Gridlock is the secret Paul brother
---
So why can't barricades just be a multiple state texture? Why the bloody fuck does it need ragdoll?
---
Full barricade looks as is. 1 hit barricade - few broken boards on the ground. 2 hit barricade - more broken boards on the ground. Simple as that.
---
Better put an ACOG on that mop
---
Tom Cruise's face with Rebel Wilson's body and accent.
---
It's been a problem on the game always. I remember it debris was different on people's screens just like smokes
---
Just put in code to auto remove buggy barricade pieces after being knocked out of place. Honestly way better than this trash
---
Pretty much just killing someone that's downed. When someone steals mine I get a little salty but I don't get mad at them, especially since I steal kills with shock drones
---
Well i always run a supressor on my pistol since i never use it anyways
---
I’ll give you it for a good cattle.
---
you didn t give a simple answer. you gave a wrong answer but keep claiming your answer is the truth though it s proven that it s not. I think ignorance is rather the thing thath people are annoyed around here. but nevermind, one should let people live in their happy places if they are at peace with this. have fun playing the game though!
---
Or have the debris a cube shape instead of following the real geometry, letting it clip through momentarily but falling consistently. Even better, make it a diamond shape.
---
Every. Single. Time. 😂
---
Now that I think about it, both 😂😂 Poor thing did it's best only to be wasted
---
Secure area on villa! The nostalgia!
---
Wow I got it after like 12 months
---
Make his gun less powerful, buff his shields abit more, slow him down to a 1 speed 3 armour, only give him one shield double the strength, take away his 1 shot rifle and replace it with something else or nothing. 
---
Or remove him from the game as he is quite toxic 😂😂
---
But I’m a casual console player and to buy a MnK and play with that on console would be like suddenly buying condoms to have protected sex with my gf, I’m not super gay so I just can’t, it just is t realistic. All seriousness though, I’d stop playing this game on console before I’d buy MnK. Easy not even a second thought as a console gamer.

---
sounds like they could solve it in 2 seconds and could take another half year for a graceful solution, but that's just me...
---
Just make the debris have no collisions with the baracaids so they don't get wedged ever. They'll just fall to the ground after spawning no matter what and nobody will ever get domed unfairly again. This is also easier to implement than moving the physics calculations to the server and the only downside is that watching a solid plank fragment phase through the whole baracaid isn't realistic. But watching a plank rape the fabric of reality is preferable to being domed because of some bullshit server desync.

This community has a weird way of pretending map knowledge isn’t a thing and half the highlights in this sub are lower level players getting completely outclassed by players who are far ahead of the competition they’ve managed to manipulate themselves into playing with. I knew this community was fucked when I noticed the over saturation was of weeabo content.
---
Uhm, what?
---
Bring me😎 tacticool ying rush lol
---
Saiga-12. Fast reload, high damage, high RoF, controllable recoil, longer range, decent capacity. Use it on Favela and other close quarters scenarios to guarantee brutal enemy deaths.
---
You overreacted so much that i “overerrected”
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
a variable crouch height is also needed. like the one in escape from tarkov. use the mouse wheel for how low you want to crouch. very useful.
---
No, the whole gun reuse thing is just their way of going past their 'engine limits'.
---
Please stop
---
Yeah, on this sub every couple of days for the past 2 years...
---
Functions like a country I know, hmmmm I wonder which country that is. (Smell of irony)
---
Nope, people rarely spawnpeek on kanal weu Xbox servers but then PS4 players are usually more toxic than xb1 players (but xb1 players can still be super toxic)
---
Just wanted to say that casual is a nightmare right now due to the rotation.  Not only are the maps added back in terrible, but now it takes forever to start a match because people keep leaving.  Add to the fact that people seem to only be getting the added maps and not the rest of the pool and you have your nightmare.
---
Thats not related to pixel peek at all lmao
---
Close call, mate
---
&gt;1. How long will these pro league sets last? 
---
1 season. 3 months.
---
&gt;2. Besides pro league and seasonal skins is anything else limited time? 
---
Pilot program skins. Generally last a year. Last set lasted a year.
---
Apart from that, skins from alpha packs get removed at random, unannounced times. We have already lost a few stuff.
---
Oh, and the special event r6 credits only packs? Like Halloween, outbreak, spring, etc.? Those are limited as well.
---
&gt;3. After every character gets an updated white and gold league set would it be possible they rotate in previous ones so I can get the ones I missed? Thanks
---
No official word on that yet. Ash had a glacier pro league gun skin in the past, and is now getting a white and gold set. They are rotating ops, not sure if the old ones will be back.
---
Among mira and lesion, Mira is super strategical and works wonders in some sites on some maps. But she often gets banned on maps where she is effective. So I would go with lesion, a great op with powerful weapon and really useful intel providing gadget. he doesn't get banned often and can be played on any map and site, never a bad pick.

There was one. We were planning to take part in it but didn't. It was on seas server though, but most teams were Indian.
---
This exactly. We got plane twice, house twice, and tower once. We quit for the night cause that's just absolute ass.
---
Twitch drone used to get 15 shots so you were able to kill afk people from full health back in the day
---
no, but R6 Twitter posted a screenshot of what looks like a tape with Doc's real name on the top.
---
PC , Ukrainian, terrible slav accent but i'm learning :D
---
I ‘member, but the last year’s Halloween had it’s universal skin (Plasma) locked behind Packs. We just have to wait and see.
---
I also have quite bad aim, but i've never hit a 1 bullet 2 kill. Maybe i'll do that today.
---
Well shit, I'm on PS4 in Germany...
---
So what you're saying is, it is easier to kill people on PC? Which means that a diamond console player is better than a diamond PC player.
---
When I get a one shot headshot in console I earned you, PC players just have know how to a mouse.......
---
Jordan not Syria
---
Also there's a fixed price for each alpha pack so you buy one at a time. 
---
Just saying
---
Oh yeah, so people start playing like is casual - rushing and dying all over again.
---
A full aggresive player ends up being useless, you need to control when to be aggresive.
---
Probably, yes. But I think a lot of players would he unhappy with that solution because it's not uncommon to hit a barricade once and peek it. And if sometimes the debris takes a few seconds to disappear, you've lost the element of surprise. So I think it would be a step in the right direction, but not a full solution.
---
Try to look up some websites for gamer transfer or something alike this. Maybe you will find people to play with
---
I think the hilarious thing is the fact that there was an ADS over the hole. Guess it only works when the airjab is in sight???
---
She is an absolute unit, who can destroy a head with those thighs.
---
How to waste a drone also works
---
I lost about 5 braincells reading this
---
definitely not, theres always gonna be bugs with new updates.
---
Why not upload the original? FYI you can trim the length with Windows OG player
---
Oh wait...they actually burned out all the charges on the ADS! XD
---
Well thank for offering anyway c:
---
How is it feels to play shooter on ps controller? Is it splay and pray or it's actually easy to aim?
---
Agree with pretty much everything you said. And like I said to the other person. I personally feel the slight advantage the skins will give you isnt even worth taking into consideration. Yes some places they seem OP but thats 1 spot on 1 map and you have to be in a 1v1. For me way too situational to see it as a major advantage. REGARDLESS I would like to maybe see default skins on the enemy team but maybe even for PL only. Imo even in ranked if you cant rank up its not skins its you.
---
You just put a filter on
---
Op mentioned that in the post. Other than those.
---
OTs-03. I just like being a sniper. Is fun.
---
Goyo is fun for a lot of reasons
---
That’s why I play pc now
---
OI same hey
---
Hiya, how did you get that unicorn main flair? I didn't see it in the list of options. I want to represent my tachanka with his true form!
---
syria? lmfao
---
Now this is original 🍿
---
Might be able to, i had apex coins on Apex, moved clock forward to event and was able to buy event packs before the event was out and still kept items when i changed time back.
---
It's definitely different than a keyboard, but I am very much used to it. You will get the recoil under control, but your accuracy will be lower than with a mouse.
---
Just shoot it out the way jesus it’s not a big deal ,it happens irl aswell?
---
It is. Deals high damage, semi-autoz only has access to muzzle brake and suppressor
---
\[Nope, i put a lot of blobs and freetime on it\]([https://imgur.com/a/4C2Pcvp](https://imgur.com/a/4C2Pcvp))
---
My bad I was thinking of Jagers gun... which is the 416. I'm a dumbass lol.
---
Wow this is so fuckiny toxic and i love it
---
The gadgets are getting crappier and crappier, I feel. So it's more about gunplay, so constant roaming and DPS/headshots is all the game's increasingly about.
---
Dude I just spent 540k on packs a bit ago.
---
Im also pc
---
They actually have huge issues with the game. In a lot of recent interviews with Siege devs they outline that they never anticipated how crazy popular Siege is and has become. 
---
A lot of early programming was just bandaid patch style. Now they’ve got entire teams of devs dedicated to things. Some do maps, others operators, etc. and are trying to implement more permanent coding solutions. Client side debris being one of those. 
---
A lot of the frustration comes from the game engine which is massively outdated and not designed for online multiplayer FPS.
---
Are you in copper or something? I rarely, if ever, see this stuff happen. I solo queue, and for the most part, it’s a generally good experience, even when I’m tryharding. Casual, also, tends to be a decent experience. Sure there’s some assholes, but most people play the game normally, and messing around/recruit rushes can be fun from time to time.
---
Fair enough
---
Yes I agree... such an operator would be fun
---
How big the map is seems to be most people's complain.
---
I know you are related to this...
---
You wanted the power that i had, that was taken from you... i will find my acog and when i do, you better hope i wont find evidance that leads to you
---
Yes, but more ~~Op I mean balanced
---
I’ll PM soon but I’m not at my house atm so I’ll be a bit
---
i played cod1 when i was 7 tho xD
---
Please read my paragraph on why people falling for it does not always matter
---
Thought you were shitposting at first, then I realized it was "ink".
---
Sad that only applies to the steam version
---
It could counter a lot of intel ops and work great with dokki because he’s not shooting the useful cams
---
Useless imo
---
That is a good one
---
Then increase that instead of decreasing casual...
---
Ok im too not at home rn, i will be playing on like 4PM UT
---
I opened 522 in february
---
[here](https://youtu.be/fTes6WlxhGQ)
---
Yes
---
I do admit that my skill is very inconsistent, I’ll be playing quite good one day and terribly the next but I do find myself in ranked games where my team is all level 40-50 while the other team is all over level 100
---
Focusing on the last 3;
---
Maybe Ubisoft has a new operator for a future season to counter Jackal and that's why they arent really doing anything with him.
---
Also, just simply play IQ, if not, then scan the ceilings, and see where Echo is going during prep phase, the area hes mostly in will most likely have one of his Drones
---
3rd, that's true, very helpful.
---
bruh, if u switch from console to pc u get up against other new players... who know nothing about the game. Also i have a ton of diamond console friends that switched to pc  and say its much harder.
---
lol
---
AHEGAO P90!
---
I had this same problem when I launched the game through the steam shortcut. I had to contact uni and they told me to launch the game from the I Uplay app and it’s been fine ever since.
---
English 0
---
Ok I’ll send my ps name and then see when you’re on
---
Its not op since it only fits 2 bullets per mag and has a huge damage dropoff... how many spawnpeeks do you see where they actually do a one (or two) tap even with the MP5 with ACOG? It's way too rare.
---
How can you be a level 200 with 800 hours? I’m a level 220 with almost 1.9k hours I am confused.
---
I got really lucky from the free and challenge packs last year. I got Valk ,Jager and thermite headgears
---
Brooooooooooooooo no wayyy
---
skill level is much higher on pc. makes sense ofc
---
Is this a Splatoon crossover episode?
---
Why an mp5
---
thanks alot man
---
I have 80+ ping no matter what i do.
---
xd
---
No they can't, client-side debris has been there since Launch day/Closed Beta days.  
---
Alot of important minor changes for Siege came a year or two late, so just wait another year or two for them to fix this
---
leaked elite
---
It's a game mechanic. Perfectly acceptable.
---
Wait for the Indian op this will be it
---
or the second you get off a drone to check if the route you're gonna take is  all clear the whole team will be roaming that area
---
Uhm a lot, idk what rank you reside in but in plat 1+ there’s a shitload of spawnpeek one taps. People are just generally way too good to have this in their hands.
---
I wouldn't have posted here if I hadn't went through troubleshooting.
---
But when I make a slightly racial remark I get banned for 2 months. Aight mods. I see you
---
Dude, you didn’t just say that....... that’s fucking funny
---
Damn, you really got him there
---
Wouldn’t it be easier to just shoot the camera? It’s not like you’re sneaking past it
---
Don't buy alpha packs and wait for the halloween packs.
---
*APPARENTLY* you will be able to buy them with renown. You get like 4 for 50k.
---
Wait and see. If they are credits only,then you can buy alpha packs.
---
Maybe it could slow down defenders with the same affect that barbed wire has?
---
And keeps a camera in play that defenders must toggle through which would be an inconvenience
---
Noice
---
1 speed, this op is a bit too useful
---
Wait The Dude carrys a Browing Automatic Rifle and A Paintball gun with him Everywhere.
---
Well Maestro’s camera has a glass shield over it that slides away. So it would still be useful as if Maestro wants to see with it he would need to open it but not as much. Although that’s a pretty good counter for him. And maybe if Maestro is daring enough he can go clean it if he wants to...
---
The paint could possibly slow enemy operators.
---
This is pretty cool! Is it OC?
---
Personally, i have a thrill getting killed by Alibi as i am climbing the ladder to the luggage hold.
---
Isn’t that what a smoke would do
---
Well i only hate the no destruction part and weird objectives.
---
Also, that MAY be why you would exactly do something like that... its horrible, you couldn't handle it.
---
Yeah, the VIP status (given by Season Pass) last for a year (it ends 31.01.2020, I guess) and it works on everything in the shop - buying bundles with renown or credits. It gives:
---
 \- 7-day early access to each season's new Operators.  
---
\- 10% discount in in-game shop\*\*  
---
\- 5% Renown boost  
---
\- Alpha Pack Boost (+0.3%)
---
easy way to save them if you have a dokebi but no defender's phones yet?
---
Sees window. 
---
Dies to unbroken window.
---
Massive hole in window in killcam 
---
Fuck it I'm going to play Apex.
---
So was tower, i was playing plane on console and tower o. Pc at the same time, my friends were making many jokes
---
Is that the WWII BAR? Why?
---
Yeah, because if they fuck up and have to move it back, well it was only a leak. And if they don’t, well it doesn’t matter.
---
He is still powerful
---
Yea maybe at first it is translucent and then it takes about 10 seconds to dry and become a solid color, and also make it smaller so it doesn't cover the entire camera, only part of it and the defenders can still rotate around and see the other part.
---
Imagine if they actually made this and name him Squid
---
One of the few operator ideas that is actually pretty good. Only thing is he doesn't really have a counter.
---
Yes, I mean so many people actually use it that way irl. 
---
It's like shooting a red bull can at someone. With a respectable firerate, (not as high as every other game version makes it out to be, R6 has the most accurate representation in it's rpm) and an integrated recoil management system like the vector (which is why when they did the vector recoil nerf I was a little peeved). Not to mention the option for a drum mag. (something every game company forgets too) It was made as an all in one tool, with one of the widest range or slug types out there. 
---
Though that would be kind of broken. 
---
There are a number of guns in this game that aren't as good as their real life counterparts. \*shrug\*
---
Cool if you PM me your smurf account I’ll add you
---
Please, we need this operator more than anything.
---
Not bad honestly, I like it.
---
There is a cuntbag called maestro
---
Actually not a bad idea
---
To expand on this cause it's neat, when shooting at a defender to mark footsteps, it should also darken their vision for a few seconds, marks their footsteps for 10 seconds to punish them for getting hit.
---
To keep this from being OP, it should only be able to fire one paintball every few seconds. Starts out with 5?
---
Ah, the main reason I play Sledge.
---
They suppress the noise of the gas expansion but since the bullets move faster than the speed of sound or makes a crack that suppressors can't you know suppress
---
There’s not even a bulk discount for buying it with r6 credits.
---
No
---
Bruh I’m grounded until November 7
---
Doctors curse ends on November 6
---
A hard counter to Mira is always pleased.
---
But wouldn't it be better to:
---
Take Jackal
---
She can still shock
---
Just shoot it
---
I agree, yesterday i threw a flashbang it barely did anthing to the enemy 2 sec after i threw he came running into the room, and then killed me. Later that match i get a flashbang thrown at me and i look away and i get the full effect and die... again.
---
Why? That’s for brand new people who’ve never played this game before why overwhelm them with maps right away
---
We Splatoon now boys
---
Just how teammates cant set off most other defender traps (cept for you know who) just set it as no effect to teammates. If they want lore reasoning, the attackers apply a salve that causes the paint/ink to not adhere and just beads off.
---
Wanted to play siege after watching USN. This shit happened every match. Spent 3 hours playing Mount and Blade instead.
---
How would warden see trough paint?
---
I feel like having 3 people and doing thunt classic on house is just as efficient. I can get it done by myself in like 2 minutes.
---
True. It looks so well detailed.
---
Great idea
---
Apparently you can buy them with 12.5k renown per pack
---
Very dependant on the map your on, site being played, other ops on your team and your own play style
---
Instead “The bad bitch Strut”
---
shit man?
---
&gt;Well i only hate the no destruction part and weird objectives.
---
Same here. As a once buck main, it bothers me so much that his main benefit is useless on that map.
---
&gt;Also, that MAY be why you would exactly do something like that... its horrible, you couldn't handle it.
---
I would never betray my own acog brethren.
---
Using the paint on a camera seems pointless though and a waste of utility
---
Those settings are objectively terrible in every regard, especially the 100 color saturation (if the default starts at 0 or 50) and 100 contrast.
---
Yeah, that is why I'm saying that is boring lmao
---
*Go cry?* Bruh
---
Ikr, now he’s been nerfed he ain’t that op anymore
---
POGGERS
---
Ah ok, looks like I gotta like, downgrade my internet somehow lmao
---
Someone told me to at least buy the deluxe edition. Is there a specific reason to get season 1 ops early?
---
If it's quiet you can do it without being noticed by the defenders
---
They should. we will see
---
I love the footprint and clash parts :)
---
You fucking muppet
---
Helps Rookies like me learn the maps
---
An operator that's not an obese PoC that's insulin dependent or something?
---
Lol yeah like that'll happen
---
In PS they just updated the textures but never stated if they fixed anything with it.
---
YES!! A singapore operator, if this guy doesn't say your dead lah after killing someone im gonna be so upset.
---
Or just make a guy with C4
---
Monty, bb, mira, ela...
---
This gun is bugged for months now.. it fires way slower than its supposed to.

"So what makes you think you're qualified to join Team Rainbow?"

"I've a paintball gun"
---
"holy sH*ET YOU'RE IN FAM*
---
Dude honestly no idea, the challenge is live just not the actual event
---
I don't really understand, what is it ? What is the challenge ?
---
Blitz isn’t OP anymore either, he can be shot easily enough. Monty can be an issue just because he can straight up block a doorway lol
---
Last year, was 2017 skins in packs or in bundles?
---
Evil Eyes, Mira, Bullet Proof Cams, Clash, deployable shields ya this honestly seems relevant, not only that it could be a ton of fun
---
Maybe it's slightly adhesive and glues the sides together
---
Why not just shoot the camera instead of "painting" it. What advantages would you gain, maybe silent.
---
All melee should use the equipped gun and should stun/daze your opponent like an Ela mine or Zofia concussion grenade, just for a shorter time. It's the only "balanced" way to handle melee attacks that's semi-close to reality. Maybe if someone is dazed from one melee, you can melee again and pull out a knife to actually kill, or if you are behind a target as an assassination. But absolutely nobody in their right mind would ever drop a gun that has SIGNIFICANTLY more range for a melee attack to pull out a knife in any CQB situation.
---
its only effective for mira and clash
---
No thanks, i'll better buy Lion.
---
2017 skins are in bundles buyable using renown . 2018 skins were in Chrimsonvile packs buyable using r6 credit only
---
A tachanka, even.
---
How does the paint get removed? If it doesn’t have a removal method it wouldn’t be balanced. He can blind everyone and that’s it. Are his footsteps painted?
---
I like that very much! What software did you use to create this?
---
Must be a troll
---
Just curious but do you have a PS4 that your username is PCPD-Nitro?
---
Probably give him an ink grenade instead to give him more utility and make him less situational
---
Braction’s short video guide on Attacking helps with this a bit.
---
What's the name of this guys channel
---
*Pocket Sand*
---
Can confirm
---
&gt;Why the fuck is pro league influencing casual play
---
Hereford isn’t a PL map, and hasn’t been for a very long time. The reason Ubi chose not to include both Herefords had absolutely nothing to do with competitive play.
---
Ok soo what would be a good setting for screen to pop more so i can distinguish heads and players a little better? Just got a PC last Friday and currently trying to get my setting, mouse sens and all that jazz together. I currently play on 75 field of view but have some trouble seeing people at father distance.... anything you think could help for that, beside glasses? And what advantage does a higher field of view give you?
---
I know what I will be trying next time
---
Real coppers don’t exist change my mind
---
Splatoon and R6 in the same room, what is this a crossover episode???
---
Wouldn't even want it in my inventory tbh, but I'm sure some people would love it.
---
By clicking the cassette tape on the bottom right of the website, a song will play and the website will be changed to Halloween Theme
---
How do you know the time?
---
Nok is indeed very spooky
---
Fuck me that would be terrifying. Like the TCSG12 but full auto
---
Did you really just give this man a BAR??
---
Definitely the least fun operator to play against in the current state of the game
---
He literally has an inkblaster
---
Not sure why they took away his claymore to be honest, I thought that was perfect for him
---
I did on both PC and Xbox but i dont have it
---
Alright seems pretty nice, but let’s dive in
---
Cons - Get it out of the way
---
*Anything you can do I can do better*. Foot tracking seems interesting until you consider something, Jackal does it much better. Mind you how niche the foot tracking would even be! They’d have to walk through an area you marked, have you follow the footsteps, and have them not set up an ambush as they look down to see the footsteps and prepare. Shooting cameras. USELESS on normal cams. Why cover what you can shoot? Notice I said *normal* cams. We’ll bring it up in the pros. Having to have LOS to whatever you want to shoot is an issue too... you are almost entirely helpless from any person who pushes you with the paint gun out. Finally, the color. Not the best choice out the gate huh? Black or a neon orange would fit more soundly. Diarrhea brown... no thanks.
---
Pros - Kept you waiting huh?
---
We’re just going to go out the gate with the hard Clash counter... aight makes sense. Yup a Mira counter is nice too! Next is special cams... this is a hard counter to Maestro. Forcing him to open his cams to see! And RIP bulletproof cams as well!
---
Delta - Fancy for change
---
Change the color. Please. Next... this op seems overall a bit more weak than other options. I’d add one small thing... a single shot paintball on the drone. Finally an excuse to put another thing on a dro- I mean haha balance! It solves the footstep issue, if you shoot the ground in pre-game then maybe you can get enough people tracked to get double time over Jackal for your whole team! Got a cam around the corner? Just send the drone out! You’d still have your paint gun with you so you can spray even more! Speaking of the gun... maybe it could be mounted to your main rifle akin to Nomad. Faster switch time between paint and gun would allow for more aggressive plays or retaliation to surprise attacks. 
---
Overall, what an interesting idea that borrows from reality! Awesome drawings too!
---
He slurp.
---
I like it
---
Yeah its stupid expensive BUT I've found out you can get them randomly
---
Fuk.
---
Well, at least it's better than credits only. Way more than what I've saved up. Shouldn't have bought that skin.
---
Halloween

I got one after a match i lost

Yeah sometimes it takes too long even with an m.2 ssd because the game is already on matchpoint. It kinda sucks but yeah there's no apparent fix to it so oof
---
Is the Halloween event out?
---
Idk that’s kind of a normal thing to complain about I don’t think OP needs to grow the fuck up
---
Do it for Bulletproof cams and Evil Eyes in long corridors and such.
---
It's way different. The defenders are 'invisible' while the attackers (jackal/pulse/lion) track them down using their abilities. Map has completely changed.
---
Last year's skins (i.e. bundles) from the Halloween Event.
---
Yeah let me pull 350,000 renown out of my ass
---
Yes bro
---
Why do you think it’s useless?
---
Man your highschool is cool. We only have LoL here.
---
It's out and it's amazing
---
*splatoon theme slowly begins to play *
---
How anyone could think this is a joke is beyond me
---
Only problem is that there's new guns in this concept. They would be needed to be switched to already existing guns to make this work out. Otherwise i see this as a absolute W as an idea :)
---
Oh no
---
Yeah, they use paint ball guns for runaway cars and people, and the paint is very hard to get off
---
It’s all been part of the April fools prank, gotta say they got me
---
I think there is a challenge that you get one for winning 13 rounds or something.
---
Neat, but would be unfun to play against and doesn't have counters. I'd rather expand his utility and remove the primary weapon, I'd say throw him a bone and give him a choice between a glock 18 F/A. And a semi auto pistol with a longer range like a Glock 40.
---
Perhaps the paint could stun enemies in a pinch, it's quiet so it can't be identified like a gunshot, have a large ammo pool, maybe shooting the ground would allow people to track footprints of those that walk through it.
---
If they could figure out a way to differentiate alt+f4 and crash, it could be beneficial.
---
You should call him the Feces Flinger ™
---
For the last time,  even with the extended barrel the fo-12 is the lowest damaging shotgun at rsnge. And also nerfing one gun to make the other better. Doesn't change her situation. Naking a gun useless to okay and good to useless fixes nothing. Ela and her entire kit is a pathetic mess. She's the worst 3 speed in game already. Her gadgets as well her pistol are all mediocre at best. The scorpion even with a recoil buff and being given a proper recoil diamond doesnt fix it doing the 3rd lowest damage in game. It'd only be at best oksy with a buff. Making the fo-12 go from good to useless only makes her a worse operator as a whole
---
yea like the act of collapsing her shield wipes it off
---
How?
---
I DON'T LIKE IT
---
Oh ok then hopefully the come back because I want the one for buck
---
More rush ops?
---
Maybe he was trying to see where the enemies where?
---
Because they fixed it like half a year ago and it doesn't happen nearly as much as it did. Everyone in this thread seems to have the memory of a goldfish, before the fix a couple seasons ago it was way worse and these days I don't experience it at all, let alone as bad as it was back in the day
---
They only take down servers for a couple of hours by accident, not intentionally.
---
Shooting it parallel to the shield works too
---
Are you talking about Event Packs or just Alpha Packs?
---
I got a free one. Looks like you need to restart it.
---
That would be a nice counter to those I'd say!
---
event packs
---
Cring?
---
Tippmann 98, a man of culture I see.
---
This guy would a meta changer for ranked play, where mira sees a 98% ban rate at high levels.  Now there'd be no need to ban her, since she has a direct counter.
---
Yeah just saw that, deleting the lost now
---
Bruh I just want the Fo-12 fire rate to be nerfed how would that make it useless . Elas shotgun is for bots anyways .
---
Dude I would KILL to have an operator with a BAR. The clip may only hold 20 rounds, but it would hit like a freight train! Plus what would be more badass than running around with a classic WWII rifle. It probably would be useless, but I'd have fun with it lol
---
It has been put in and this is a non-issue at this point
---
Bet you’ll never make that mistake again. Treating redditors as people that is.
---
what about acog on Le Roc
---
lol.
---
It doesn't even appear for me
---
It would be awesome if we could have a 3D map that we could explore each map in a sort of 'noclip' way. Just a static map that you could sift through without having to physically walk it in-game on T-hunt or something.
---
In the future ever FPS will have this. But I think Ubisoft's Rainbow 6 Siege should be the first to do it because of how important map knowledge is in this game. It would really elevate the player experience.
---
Consider it Ubi, it would be revolutionary. Someday this WILL be the norm, and you could be the first to do it.
---
I though of an idea my self
---
Name:Void
---
Ability:can pick up any gadget and use them for a minute (the drop mechanic works like Phones with dokabi)
---
This is a defensive operator
---
Same thing happened to me just restarts siege
---
Restart your game. That's what worked for me lol
---
#JUST GIVE EVERYTHING AN ACOG NEED MOAR ACOG
---
Yeah this is an old screenshot and they've already fixed the entire issue
---
Playing the long game Ubi. Well played.
---
Imagine an op that can zoom around the map, blinding intel ops, and avoiding detection by not shooting guns at cams... it’s a good concept but needs to be restricted
---
The dude's a BB, so definitely not satire.
---
He's going to spawnpeek
---
Ah I see
---
Ikr even if you're not a trap operator you can hear him so easily with the *CLANK CLANK CLANK* of his sheild when he walks
---
That is one of the most horrifying things I have ever seen
---
#SledgeHammerACOG
---
ok
---
They literally our giving us a free event and for the first time letting us buy alpha packs with currency that isn’t purchasable with money and that can be earned just by playing. Personally I have 230,000 renown saved up for just an occasion like this.
---
oof, 315k ... I would need 4 full seasons to gather such an amount of renown ...
---
Can you IMAGINE being on a battlefield and looking across to your left, and seeing your **highly trained, competent, and efficient Navy Seal friend** violently and repeatedly stabbing the neck hole of a decapitated enemy combatant.
---
*cant play seige till the 23rd* 
---
Me: -_-
---
Invisible lol whattt so can defenders attack or is just hide and seek lol?
---
You can also purchase them if you prefer with credits. You’re not entitled to a free pack.
---
You gotta have club lol
---
Can someone fill me in. OOTL.
---
Ah yes the poo flinger.
---
You have to buy the event loot boxes with r6 credits
---
Would also be cool if you could wipe it off sort of like how you take out a gu mine.
---
You should be able to buy the alpha packs containing them with r6 coins
---
sending someone to space and having them do a million back flips into the Pacific
---
Depends on what kind of CTU you work for.
---
It just showed up, could be the free one.
---
I need 1 season to get 11.5 itself.
---
Never enough reinforcements for a site.
---
It just came out and you already want to buy it without even properly knowing what
---
In the Alpha pack section move the stick to the right wand you got where to buy. Bought 5 less then 10 minutes ago
---
I like this
---
Ubi should totally do double renown weekends or something
---
Princess Consuela Bananahammock?
---
 No, thank you
---
Welcome to Reddit
---
Buy R6 credits from the shop menu
---
Wait, so no Halloween Event or Collection ?
---
Just spent like 50k renown on Alpha packs a few days ago out of boredom. Rip
---
Very good! Genuinely cracked me up haha
---
The ink drips off over 1 minute?
---
Bro shotguns are gonna be op in general, their meant for CQB, if you don't wanna get lit up like a Christmas tree then back up.
---
I was looking for the ash symbol mixed in since she is already there.
---
over 8000 credits or 300k renown
---
Makes sense. If they notice a kapkan trap they probably won't check for a frost mat as well so it's nice to have a backup. But basically, the kapkan trap plus the initial fire damage downs them, then they burn to death before they can crawl out. It's hysterical every time it happens. The only downside is that it's fhe trap has to be placed at basically eye level or they'll jump it when they climb the shield, so it's easy to spot. It would be nice if there was a airjab/grzmot style explosive for defenders. That would be pretty broken paired with goyo.
---
Have a defender with a water pistol to clean his stuff.
---
But I don't think that he needs a counter bc his gadget aleready is a niche counter for Mira and maestro, like warden for blitz.
---
Valentine’s Day like 2-3 years ago gave a universal skin called “Enamored”, all I’m saying is universal skins as a challenge have been done before.
---
But inks the players vision if it's a headshot.
---
but a six inch blade never loses reception
---
Yeah and what did I say? I said "No. Event skins are limited time only." which is correct. Why do you have a problem with that?
---
This sub is a circle jerk of people complaining about Ubisoft over a video of someone clearly playing terribly
---
Jackal can still scan in the game mode though...
---
Doesn't the PS4 also automatically attaches a screenshot to that trophy, just to remind you of the defeat?
---
Send them goyo and give him a flame thrower.
---
“I’m down! Consuela’s in Kitchen!!!! ... LAST SCENE CLEANING THE STOVE!”
---
People who play at a high level usually don't move like bots
---
It does? On IQ at least
---
What i mean is - is he that bad how charts are saying? Ofc not. 100%. 
---
You can always take Thatcher to help with ADS.
---
My take on Ying and Cap is that these two requires a deeper thinking and strategy than your typical Ash, Sledge, Zofia etc. - meaning they are harder to utilize properly for average player.
---
Ubisoft:"no lol"
---
You know this would either be really really awesome or complete shit. Good idea man. The visual is well done too
---
Maybe it drips off after a while giving Dokk time to hack and then the cam is useful later on?
---
That's about it the size of the full game though. Maybe we your game files got corrupted
---
What is this?
---
This is actually a great idea for an op
---
New event
---
*knock knock* house keeping.
---
Maestro and bulletproof
---
Kinda have too, otherwise if you run out of ammo you're screwed.
---
Then save up. If you’ve been playing the game for a while you have all the ops. I have 230,000 renown saved up for exactly an occasion like this.
---
You can only buy them
---
I’d like to know about this as well
---
It does lol
---
If the map hasn't changed too much, there is a little room somewhere where you can climb onto the top of a shelf, you probably can't even get hit by sledge
---
He is playing on console too, so that kind of movement is to be expected.
---
Welp,looks like it is part of a community challenge.
---
Balance is a thing that exists
---
What? This is fun as fucking balls
---
Money or save a lot of credit
---
I find it fun, but lion is quite op
---
I have had a mix of wins on either sides. Some earlier ones involved the defenders hiding and not moving, there should have been a system to mark defenders if they dont move within 5 seconds**
---
Ubisoft adds a new mode so players can immediately start  complaining, if you don't like it don't play it
---
You will never reach the ‘e’
---
IQ uses the AUG A2, that has ACOG. Kaid uses the A3 and it doesn't have an ACOG
---
F
---
You're spitting facts.
---
I don't think it's meant to be balanced, it's just a limited time mode to mess around with
---
There is no sledge skin
---
You better not bring that squid from Mario kart in here
---
350k renown i thought
---
As far as I know event has 4 rounds so not sure how can you win 13 rounds of possible 4
---
I've been saying this for awhile now but everyone seems to be blind to the fact.
---
Rally? Were about is the room??
---
Because you’re schooling him on how event items work even though some returned for a second year. Which would be why OP asked the question because they weren’t limited when they came back last year and I haven’t seen Ubisoft officially announce they would forever stop bringing back old seasonal cosmetics. Let’s not forget black ice were also brought back into Alpha Packs, also with Blood Orchid this season.
---
Wait for it
---
And Gridlock's F90 does too. I think he's talking about Kaid's A3 that's been converted to an SMG.
---
Adding insult to injury it counted as a loss... rip elo as well.
---
The event is crap. Incredibly one sided.
---
Smoke acog*
---
Feel like siege needs to get back to reality a bit more and release operators like this that make logical sense rather than fantasy heros
---
Like the op btw
---
This would go good with evil eyes and bullet proof cameras in the longer range
---
Just hope the enemy has bloom off
---
Why have so may of Siege’s recent cosmetics been so glowy. Seriously, stop it
---
I didnt know, so thank you, however i am relatively new to the game though. :/
---
lmao the mode just came out and you think it's not balanced
---
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Colored Splatoon
---
how is it one sided?
---
This just pulls off the opportunity to create funny art akin to Maverick’s blowtorch without having to destroy a wall for it.
---
That's what i said....over 300k...
---
Wait, your Jackel can actually ping? What?
---
I know but you can feasibly not use it and still get value, like how it should be
---
Where to buy them tho? The option isnt available in alpha pack section.
---
A la ed gein
---
I think it would break the meta
---
[Here you go.](http://static2.cdn.ubi.com/pxm/RainbowSix/FanKit/R6_MTX_Y4S3_IMG_DOKTORS_CURSE_Keyart_1920X1080.png)
---
Actually a fuckin great idea!
---
Not fun when your teammates are absolute shit and move around on an EE1D
---
Amazing paintball gun would be interesting 🤔
---
This is why you rarely see people wearing event skin, remember Hibana banana?
---
Yall got a shit bucket?
---
Sure, but it's not it's only use. It's useful on bulletproof cams and maestro's gadget. Plus Clash and Mira.
---
I appreciate it xD I'm not expecting anyone to go crazy with this; it just hit me all of a sudden; the sheer potential of this game
---
People were complaining about this mode before it had been out for an hour 
---
Shut the fuck up
---
This was leaked how long ago? And they couldn't find a way to make it fun?? Ubisoft makes how much money a year, just from Siege? They're trying to give us a *paid* battle pass when they're also using a season pass model, in a game you have to *buy?* Fuck off, bootlicker.
---
at least they can be bought with reknown
---
cheap credits worth tho
---
yes
---
i like the sound of that operator
---
Who gives a shit about balance in an OPTIONAL game mode.
---
Play have fun and move the fuck on
---
It was a hacked skin/a concept
---
I think it’ll be cool to see him as an ex thug with spray paint, but is now apart of R6 as an anti terrorist advisor.
---
Yes, but unless they're looking at the camera when it happens you won't know how long ago it happened. When you shoot a camera you can hear the shot, unless the gun is silenced. It's also useful on bulletproof cams and maestro's gadget
---
Love this idear. But he may need to have that as his ability and a limited "mag" on it, yeah?
---
Defending operators should be able to wipe it off with a cloth. It should take a bit; enough time for it to be risky, but quick enough for you to get it off when the time is right.
---
Even at pissing distance it takes 6 shots and about 45 seconds.
---
This is too difficult for this sub, people need something to complain about
---
It could also block mistro cams
---
Who gives a damn? I'll take a $10 guaranteed drop battle pass over $80 lootpack sets every day
---
Alright Ubi, gotta shut it down.
---
The flashes she use is special and are immune to those not regular
---
Big boy gun = big boy scope
---
Simple maths
---
Ubisoft have promised us a new mode every season, an optional mode nobody has to play 
---
Yet people still complain every fucking time
---
Yeah but if there is at least 2 good attackers its almost impossible
---
They may be dead but they still have feelings.
---
no way you're playing with LeonGids lmao
---
He carries a septic tank on his back
---
BoJack Horseman?! What is this, a crossover episode?!
---
When the hunter becomes the hunted
---
2 minutes is perfect in my opinion 10 minutes sounds horrible
---
I got a charm on my free pack and I got so pissed.
---
Rebravecruit
---
No they did of mask and attach of it fleshlight of and mask
---
Does anyone know if there will be more event challenges to earn packs? Or was the 13 round/pack the only one for a week?
---
Functionally, in the game it's a pair of safety glasses that work similarly to warden's glasses. She's always wearing them but they aren't always on.
---
Pretty sure it is just hide n seek
---

I know, I have the same issues. 
---
Was Gold 2-3 always started Soloing and ended up High Bronze Low Silver. 
---
Kinda makes me feel like the guys I played with carried me even though I’ve always gone atleast 1:1 for KD every match we played.
---
Whats the point of having it on footstep’s?
---
This is epic, thank you for making my day :)
---
Because if its not balanced then it will only be fun for one side
---
I just woke up cause im a fucking loser but judging by coreross’ video on the 22nd it looks like we’re gonna be playing michael myers on a reworked themepark? Or at least we’ll have hammers..
---
Do it
---
I've gotten nothing but charms for so many events while my friends get cool stuff, I doubt it will be any different this event
---
What?
---
It doesn't take an hour to realize the game mode is trash. It was leaked so long ago and they still couldn't find a way to make it fun.
---
Yea we should get this in nearly future
---
Attack with jackals, pulses and lions with hammers and fast af 
---
Defend without weapons with regenrating lesion frost ela and kapkans + smoke with 4 charges 
---
Defender secondary ability invisibility and speed boost 3x per round no recharge
---
Bwahaha
---
Defenders can only use their gadget and a speed boost that also turns you invisible, ops include frost, lesion, smoke, Kapkan and ela 
---
Attackers can use pulse, lion and jackal's abilities, there is no limit to how many they can use, they also have hammers to kill defenders 
---
Defenders must hide/survive for 2 minutes
---
My friend got the frost head gear on his first
---
This is such a wild event. I love it. Pure fun and excitement.
---
Lesion is a zombie
---
But I did get bandits head gear for the challenge
---
People are standing still while being invisible when hearing pulse scanner.
---
It doesn't help,it just makes you scanned from even a further distance
---
Defending are zombies. They have gadgets and no guns. However can turn invisible and move fast. Attackers have Jackals, lions and pulses gadget depending who you choose. You can stack attacking gadgets. Attackers are fast and only have a sledge hammer. You play on theme park but its all changed like the plane in the april fools event. I think thats it.
---
Is Halloween out?
---
Oh... in that case I agree, it doesn't make much sense to me. She has those special goggles after all
---
Just don't play it, casual, ranked and unranked are still available 
---
When the rainbow is magic event came out I got bored and moved on, I didn't come on reddit to complain about it being an unbalanced map with an unbalanced mode
---
I would look weird but feel so right
---
Attackers have sledge hammers and one ability (pulse, lion or jackal).
---
Defenders does not have weapons, but they have abilities (frost, lesion, smoke, kapkan or ela) and as secondary gadget you get an invisibility and speed boost for a few seconds. Defenders are always slower than attackers.
---
Defenders must survive until the clock goes to zero. They can kill using operator gadgets, but is hard to kill all attackers.
---
I have the weirdest boner right now...
---
I don’t know, I hope so tho.
---
At least you can say it and know it’s wrong most times. At this point people do it because they cant get a kill inside the map to save their lives
---
I have won both attack and defence several times 
---
If it's not fun people can move on
---
I often don't shoot cams when rushing so that they don't know I'm on my way
---
someone tell ubi t give this man a job
---
It depends on what you think of Broken Lizard films. If you liked Beerfest, you'll probably like Super Troopers.
---
OP bestows upon us the sauce
---
Better than half of all r/Animemes posts already
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
*The negative comment and hate speech thing*
---
Welp there goes yet another 50 hours of my life
---
Yes please! I have trouble spawn peeking now
---
The problem is it wont be fun for half the players if its not somewhat balanced
---
Previous event packs were all paid so it’s a step in the right direction.
---
Like, this is the first time ever in this game, that i want to leave after the attacking round.
---
The april fools event I enjoyed tbh. It was a meme. spawnpeeking heaven lol got the challenge over time, this event I just want to join and get it over with to never touch it. Legit worst even so far.
---
It's out now
---
The gun’s fine as it is, unless they wanna change vigil to a 2 speed then I wouldn’t advice giving him any access to an acog, Vigil has enough firepower with the k1a and doki has enough balancing as she has a dmr, close quarter weapon, frags/smokes, and phone calls/hacking. I’m tired of hearing this movement over and over again, it’s really simple to why they’ll never follow through with this.
---
Ela doesn't have an elite...
---
Thx! I wish Monty hadn’t extended his shield tho because I could’ve got him too.
---
Are you guys going to release the older halloween bundles from the shop as well?  Was really looking forward to some of those but only see the two newest ones.  To not would seem like a missed opportunity from my perspective.
---
I was hopeful lol switched platforms and I miss some of my old cosmetics
---
And of course that’s what I got for my free pack
---
Got leaked already, and her haircut is awful. The rest doesn't look that bad though
---
I want to use the G2 Army Skin on Sledge while also using the Ball Hammer and the MVP. Same with Valkyrie's Cloud 9 and Elite.
---
hide and seek?
---
There was an update yesterday, but it’s probably just your connection to the r6 servers. What I suggest is to hard reset your Xbox one more time, wait around 3 minutes for your Xbox to calibrate the menu and everything on your console at the home, then launch the game again.
---
If the paint was white you could shoot the wall behind a corner and make it easier to see if someone is peeking
---
Rainbow six = Splatoon 🤔🤔🤔
---
Autopicked recruit, recruit gets gun, ez win
---
I thINK there will be worse puns than mine
---
Why didn’t you just take a screenshot on the console instead of your cell phone lol
---
The Ubisoft club app has another free pack challenge
---
RIP hunters
---
Same bro, they would make more money if they allowed us to cause I don't buy any cosmetics for skins I already have the elite for, if I could mix and match, I would buy more
---
 could you hurt yout teammates?
---
Its neat but the gameplay gets underwhelming after a few games.
---
What is the HS multiplier out of curiosity?
---
Yea the attackers are the op ones.
---
You’d be surprised.
---
Thanks, I already did the soft restart and restarted the console but that didn’t work. After I pulled out the HDMI and Hard Drive, should an update pop up in the menu section?
---
They would make more money if they let us, I don't buy cosmetics for elite ops, if they changed this I would
---
Push the xbox button on your console for 40 seconds, then turn it on and try again to start
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
Why cant i throw money at ubi for last years skins.
---
Elite Thatcher with his gas mask would look great imo
---
It's a cool concept but we are talking about elite soldiers so instead of a cap give him a helmet and I will like that
---
Been discussing this with my team. Expanding on the idea. What about making the splat large so you can find valk and yokai cams? Also cover up the windows on deployable shields?
---
Edit: shields question
---
It was faster.
---
I gotta ask what the hell is a BAR18?
---
osmosis is the movement of a high concentration of water to low concentration..
---
it is
---
Don’t quote me, but x50, as far as I remember. 
---
Which is why it’s occasionally possible to DBNO with a headshot through walls or at long range. Because 1x50 is still not an instant.
---
r/softwaregore
---
Yeah it was around 1.5 GB if I remember correctly. So it was just an in-game update and I don’t have to install anything?
---
Because fun is overrated
---
This isnt F2P...
---
didn't try but now i regret that
---
Init
---
Zombie Science with a Lord Tachanka Main 😂😂
---
if you run while invisible, you’re still spotted.
---
They nerfed the firing rate because if maestro and alibi shot the gun non stop destroying walls and ceilings your FPS would plummet
---
I’m cool with this idea as long as you can kill downed players with pain balls
---
You are a 6 now, you are a squid now, you are a 6 you are a squid!
---
Would be easier to draw dicks on the wall too
---
Imagine if you did
---
No not everyone gets a pack. Some get it some have to get it through ubi club.
---
How did this happen?
---
Woah
---
Fuk of stupid twat
---
tripophobia incoming!
---
But then they have to make a water gun operator to balance the field.
---
Press square x2 to quickly poke that piece off with the tip of your gun.
---
That would be sick!
---
2 or 3. Since the "win 13 rounds" challenge is here for 7 days and the challenge for 14 days, I'd expect another one next week. Probably not more than that
---
They laughed at him for years, now they tremble before him.
---
with extended barrel.
---
Finally I dropped from 500k to 100k lmao
---
Yea but we have jackal for that
---
This is scary good, what even, how even.
---
Great work.
---
I think the stains should be temporary, that could help...
---
It’s because Dok brought them back to life
---
Yes I totally agree. 
---
We really need to raise awareness to this issue and make the community and content creators talk about it more.
---
Kill trough hole
---
THIS IS A COSPLAY ?????? I seriously thought this was cgi
---
Lame, I got a free one for the summer event
---
That's true. I think 15 seconds would be a could time
---
"How to win defense in new Siege event"
---
Definitely, thanks for upvoting
---
Flings his shit to obsure cameras, bullet proof  glass and sheilds
---
Stupid idea
---
Oh yeah just saw that. Thanks for pointing it out!
---
[I know it's airsoft, but I kept thinking about this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMY_SUuobww) "INK" would do like 1000 damage per second.
---
Damn you are fast!
---
They always had no dupes for event packs. Still scummy that you can’t just buy what you want.
---
I would feel the same way if that happened to me.
---
nah it's ok, you're just crap
---
Np ^^
---
If they changed it people would quit last round.  Have to make it so people don’t want to quit no matter what part of the match you are in.    Next time don’t play a ranked match while waiting for a delivery.  Or set the controller down so you spin.
---
It was meant to represent stitches
---
Defenders are Ela, kapkan, smoke, lesion and frost. No guns no nades etc. Only operator abilities, you cant melee. Just run and hide your operator ability recharges over time allowing more eventually. You have 3 charges of an invisible skill that you are 100% invisible even though on your end you dont look so.
---
Attacked are basically Pulse, Jackal and Lion with permanent sledge hammers as their left click, only lions ability recharges over time. Jackal gets 3 scans but can forever see footprints if the defense moves a lot. 
---
Best attacker results are 2 jackal 2 pulse 1 lion.
---
Best defend is sitting together with traps combined to eventually kill attackers. Smoke em when they're Goo'd or Frost trapped, have kapkan hopefully finish some off on low HP by luring them through traps.
---
Attackers are default 3 speed I believe and faster than all the defenders regardless. 
---
Defender invisibility skill stops you from running for a split second to activate it like a Finka boost.
---
oof
---
The perfect plan
---
Except he’s right. Defenders are at a HUGE disadvantage.
---
It’s perfect, one of the best events yet
---
I probably sound crazy here but I think the unbalanced aspect of the mode makes it fun and it's clear that was their intention 
---
You can have pulse on attack, multiple lions and jackals, ela has mines that regenerate and she can turn into a 6 speed who's also invisible 
---
This game mode is so chaotic and fun because it basically follows the "if everyone is overpowered nobody is overpowered"  mentality, people should just have fun with this mode and not worry about balance too much
---
I’m so happy house is back!!!
---
###Said all the OG siege players
---
Holy fuck they listened somewhat.
---
I was hoping they just dumped the RNG packs but that's kinda cool as well.
---
having fun at a game involves to not care about losing
---
Instead of shit like this, can we get an update on R6 Quarantine?
---
no one?
---
This would be so fucking funny as a defender haha
---
He probably had no operators.
---
No, Nøkk is ;3
---
I'd still get a blowjob from that.
---
I just messaged the guy at the beginning of the round and told him knife fight only, he accepted and so did our other 2 teammates that weren't in our party. It was my first time being able to do something like that on ranked lol.
---
Damn you didnt have to end this mans career like that.
---
Jager and thermite had the best
---
Gotta love casual.
---
Thanks, I was too lazy to do the math twice.
---
Sorry man, I don't have the game in english.
---
You can find the bundle on the store &gt; bundles section tho
---
Also WEEDPOT
---
When are we gonna get an update on this game?
---
OK, first of all: old engines do not equal to bad practices. OOP (object oriented programming) wasn't something that was invented in the last decade, and it's probably one of the first things any sort of dev learns since like the 80's.
---
Second of all: 2007 is old, but it's by no means archaic. Apex legends runs pretty decently and runs on a souped up Source engine. 
---
That's Half-Life 2. 
---
2004. 
---
Let that sink in.
---
A bad developer always blames their platform.
---
You have a beautiful scream
---
He used to be a cool guy before we started playing Siege. Now he just treats me like garbage because I'm not the "Siege Nationals Pro-League" Material he is.
---
He said he was invited to the Siege nationals because of how good he is on Xbox (he never plays ranked and only plays casual, so I highly doubt it). And he started treating me like trash when I said I don't care to be that good at the game.
---
I love the way everyone circled around you at the beginning
---
Can you be any operator
---
It’s a glitch, happens when you join during round 2 and don’t have all the ops
---
Most likely ubisoft club challenges
---
Yeah? And when exactly do you have time to reinforce when there’s only ten seconds of prep?
---
I'm not even a game dev (but am a dev), and I cringe what some people think are the source of some games' problems.
---
You muppet
---
You 100% were reported for cheating.
---
Man I literally spent half of my 110k savings on random cool shit since I figured I’ll never use it on anything else.
---
Who’s shit tier now!? Behold the power of GUN! 
---
-Robbie Recruit
---
yea wasn't sure how/why this happened but it was pretty cool to have a gun on our side. Sadly he died after one kill.
---
How did that end?
---
If it’s not in the packs now then I would say it’s a community challenge skin as they haven’t to my knowledge added an item into the collection halfway thru the rollout
---
Dont drink green Monster, ubi gonna take your renown away.
---
Of course it is a joke. I was thinking about putting a disclaimer there because I wasn't sure &gt;:( and the absurdity of the comment would suffice, and apparently it really does not. Oh well
---
That is *CLEAN*, really accurate too!
---
Wow an operator I could really see in the game! Awesome art, by the way.
---
I mean, I would use him, it's generally a good idea
---
That’s... actually a good op. I can see my self maining this guy, word of advice tho, who ink cams when you can shoot them
---
What's the spray on M4?
---
Because he was too busy pounding your teammate into dust
---
Also I didn't think Ash would run into that corner at mach 9..
---
Just yesterday enemy was in train room on cafe , im looking at reading room door for 30 seconds and the moment I turn to run up the stairs bandit says hi
---
You have to either buy the bundles or buy the ops by themselves. The operators have gone on sale a couple of times iirc, but it's rare. The operators decrease in price every year now, so be grateful for that
---
boosters + grinding is the best imo
---
How fun is it, when the attackers is winning 90% of the time?
---
It’s a fair outcome.
---
Rule 3.
---
I had 60k renown 1 week ago and heard a leak that you wouldn't be able to buy packs with renown so I spent all of it two days ago and now have 2k renown as I now see you can buy packs with renown. Kill me
---
My man made Ethan probably just turn his pc off!
---
Hopefully a new gun
---
MP5 on a three speed aw man
---
I got that skull one from the base game which is good and scurry.
---
we won because no one found Frost\*  
---
edit: confused names of ops
---
Gotta meet them halfway, it's never going to be perfect, but it sure is better than what we had before.
---
Although I'm not sure if it's going to last. The the timing with Blizzard and HK seems a bit suspicious, Ubi tried to censor the game to appease to the Chinese government, resulting in a community backlash. Maybe they're trying to distance themselves from that by doing something nice?
---
Wait, were you one of the guys on the other team?
---
This was painful
---
Just shoot the camera
---
VR simulation. Yes, it is literally a simulation inside a simulation don't ask me why
---
Sorry, but I’m out of the loop, why do people want an acog on a shotgun
---
Yeah, I’m not a fan of it. Just gonna get my 13 round wins for the pack and then never touch it again.
---
Honestly when i play the game especially with friends i just put my chat volume down so they sound like whispers i rather hear the game and be 100% focused and say it was my fault and learn from my mistakes because that’s the only way you get better (a little youtube watching from pros won’t hurt but only if you care that much)
---
Fr tho your friend is a tool for that if it really annoys you just play alone and talk to people in solo and you can make potentially way better friends.
---
Terroist Hunt will be after an hour or so
---
Unbalanced as hell and really fun
---
Hella dick move to actually use the guns man
---
Exactly! we can't all just play game modes like bomb, secure area and hostage all the time... :(
---
Fellow 5:4 player I see
---
Think a better halfway would be no gambling involved lol
---
You can still clearly hear movement
---
Excuse the audio, I had the starladder CS stream open.
---
Thats some cool sh!t bro!
---
Yeah I was the last guy to run out!
---
this game is just not newbie friendly especially if you're late to the game. if you're a newbie who plays Siege in Operation Dust Line you may still have a chance to learn a bit. 
---
i would suggest get a party with 1 or 2 veteran players that willing to play with you and your friend
---
Man i feel you 100%, I’ve been there too.  Seige is definitely a game that can inflate egos until they explode like a nuclear bomb. Just remember that how you are treated by people are reflections of how they treat themselves when no ones around. If you feel like you’re in a bad place mentally from playing video games that bring you joy you gotta just take a step back and cut the toxicity at its root.  You’d be surprised at how different you play when there’s no annoying yelling or backseat gaming in your ear.
---
"under her skin" and ela's whole weapon skin, uniform and headgear is straight flesh (i think there is some foreskin in there as well)
---
Correct, so she should not appear for the cardiac sensor. Souls are not a heart beat.
---
Damn that's awesome! What are the odds you found this post? Lmao
---
Not even that if you hide and wipe the stain away like some dishonest paintball players do.
---
5:4 buddy :)
---
Hmm... Someone has to look that up in custom game
---
Thanks
---
Seems pretty cool, but would the ability do any damage to ops? and would the paint disappear over. time or just stay until the end of a round?
---
It’s a great idea, kit would need work. I think they have been avoiding any gun models that resemble glocks. The gadget is great though. It kind of reminds me of the old swat games.
---
♠️ This symbol is a spade, not an ace. The ace in a deck of cards is the A
---
you wrote all that and the simple answe is you DONT have to buy anything at all, no gameplay elements are locked behind these new packs, sure people can chose to burn thru money/renown but Ubi isnt making them do that to be able to play and enjoy the game
---
so trust me my brain is doing its job by not being a special snowflake getting mad at cosmetics

Was Montagne's Rainbow Is Magic skin not terrifying?
---
((Also, this has been reported up to the team! Sorry for the confusion.))
---
12,5k for people who dont have season pass
---
Is there more of this? It ended a bit abruptly
---
And Maestro
---
That’s dope
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Upvoted for how upfront and simple you have it. No need for a long and lengthy story just a simple “fuck you”
---
V I B E C H E C K B O Ń K
---
Well considering I browse this sub often I would say higher! I didn't think I'd ever see anything from me though
---
Tried that a few times, and nothing. Will see if a hard console reset does it my when I get home from work.
---
You joke, but I’d run that just for shits and giggles.
---
Congrats on the flawless defeat!
---
Everyone gangster until the Recruit joins the Monster side.
---
 Every 8 out of 1 barricades i hit do this shit
---
*inserts Michael Jackson*
---
Same
---
Yea, it's normal for shotgun recruit to watch his victims die
---
Anyone can tk
---
For insult purposes
---
Can you still see if *you* are loading tho?
---
When you win on defense, all the defender ops get electrocuted on electric chairs and only the MVP gets back up.
---
I mean smoke grenades would help her out or even frag grenades.
---
Its be cool of he could also be able to clog/cover up tiny peak wholes in soft walls 
---
But I dont think that'd make sense
---
I play a hell of a lot better when I don't play with him (I made it to Gold 2 in ranked just by playing with a random squad of 4 I met.) But when I play with him I can barely play my level.
---
Oh lol I thought it was Hibana the wig threw me off
---
Article 5 queue times are horrendous so I’m pretty sure newbies would benefit from multiplayer tutorials
---
Yes, my console updated yesterday for 1 GB and most likely it was already there but they had a background timer before the event would show up so you didnt have to update day of the event and lose play time.
---
No, don’t make me feel the pain
---
He's a drug addict
---
You get 1 free and 1 through a quest
---
Excuse my teammate lol
---
huh?
---
I got 2 charms from 2 packs
---
a win is a win
---
You can't be that stupid, can you?
---
An obscene amount of renown
---
I think it's a mixed bag, with bloom on they can't really see your head, a lot like a bomber
---
I see
---
And they took my Skyscraper, smh.
---
$50-60, what I do is buy one pack at a time till I get what I want most. You can also use renown if you got any saved up.
---
Bruh
---
I play R6 for years...
---
Cycling to dead cameras is actually a good thing , I know which camera is next after the last one and skipping cameras actually confuse me
---
I'd rather not skip a dead camera
---
You have to give up not being obvious for cool cosmetics sometimes. If you're not willing to use the headgear as it is then don't use it at all
---
Same here! in PC.
---
for the whole collection $100
---
Me: \*undoes belt\*
---
Probably another freebie next week too.
---
Was it fun the other way?
---
Man i would love to see the full match of this lol
---
Shouldn't they be removing maps that aren't in ranked though? Skyscraper is still in ranked matchmaking but removed.
---
How long will be the event be available
---
November 4th I believe
---
Why not just have soldier’s is paintball Guns in combat, yeah that would.
---
It’s really only a permanent smoke vs Mira.. beyond that wouldn’t it just be better to shoot the cameras...?
---
The Yatch map artwork had a guy T-posing before it was patched and removed
---
It would be a great game mode if Pulse wasn’t an option. You can’t hide from Pulse, even when you’re invisible.
---
I've won all my rounds but I can see how annoying the refilling Lion scans Jackal feet scan combo can be. It actually can feel like an auto gg if the enemies are just playing toxic.
---
Matches are based off silent MMR, so not having attackers steamroll every round says more about your skill level than the game.
---
I’m so god damn mad I spent all my renown to buy 50 alpha packs like 2 weeks ago. Only cool thing I got was black ice for the 417 and I’m on console so only people that are actually good at the game use that.
---
To each their own then
---
Why is man emphasised there fella?
---
Nice
---
Bar is more of a squad machine gun
---
However, i did find a bar-15, which is an ar, but bullpup, and definitely looks cool
---
Cosmetics have always costed a shitton of renown, most helmets are 10k+ and uniforms 20k+
---
so theyre mostly only attainable when you have all ops and just start piling renown
---
Was the guy recognisable?
---
I think he intends for it to be used on maestro and bulletproofs
---
are people using her SMG again?
---
Hungry still best Ying worldwide tho
---
Its purchasable as a seasonal weapon skin
---
Great Idea. The paint gun ahould be attached to his primary so there isn't a 7 year long pullout.
---
Didn't they make them available again last year? I thought you could purchase 2017s skins as full packs in the store
---
That’s not that bad though for having your entire team leave you. I mean losing elo regardless sucks but Ubisoft could have really screwed people over and still made you lose the 60-90 elo. Here’s to hoping you don’t get shitty teammates next time.
---
Na
---
Those exterminators better stay the fuck away from this haunted mansion
---
Predictions were made 11 hours ago from now, so you’re kinda late to the party.
---
And Ash
---
You seem delightfully hostile. But yeah. Removing gambling and letting you buy overpriced items is unrealistic.
---
Yeah, but again that's not really Siege, it just look like it.
---
Yes, you don't need anybody unlocked, you can choose any of the event operators
---
Yeah ubi loves money!
---
I’ve never had a problem saving my screenshots from the Xbox mobile app
---
I’m on mobile so you can take a look on google. They removed him eventually tho
---
Attacking team: "Why do I hear boss music"
---
same thing happened to me but on attack xD fix your shit ubi
---
You're not being forced to buy it though? I don't understand the issue. If you don't like it, don't use it.
---
Something tells me it's basically get turned into the SCAR if they ever decided to give it slugs.
---
So don't pay then
---
Wait...that’s illegal
---
Thnx
---
This is not a joke
---
They're british
---
cool thx
---
Because women tend to scream more often during horror movies?
---
Imagine maining clash
---
Bottom text
---
Y is there doc and bandit skins?
---
They're cosmetics lol you can live without them
---
I don't get it either but I think I'm just dumb
---
Oh srry didnt see the time stamp
---
Very true, he can make it difficult. 
---
When I first started, I went in thinking Jackal would be the best option. Quickly realized Pulse actually was lol
---
Is this just TS or is it available for console?
---
Of course!  Those who dare, win.
---
Looks fooooking good.
---
I hate myself because I've spent about 150k renown this season on regular packs
---
Yeah I got this glitch too. It’s really unfair and they need to fix it. I got an ace in the first minute
---
If you get the chance you better take it
---
wait that's illegal
---
u were at 69 health for a second, nice
---
Will i would consider ice-T fake
---
Now that’s not how you’re supposed to play the game
---
happened on one of my rounds as well, we had a recruit with an ump as attackers and defenders had one with a shotty, we didnt last long.
---
Wow this is kinda epic anf funny?!
---
thatcher looks like any SAS agent so the best way to cosplay him has to be to get a SAS uniform of ebay or something like that
---
The only way to improve this is an attack for the defenders. Only 10 or 20 damage or maybe a stun with a wind up, it would give defenders more of a way to survive
---
that doesn't mean it's okay to completely over charge for them...
---
You don’t get infinite, you get quite a lot sure but there is a limited supply
---
I think it’s like 5 frost traps idk
---
Ela got a skin?
---
Why, it’s just a sight and shotguns are close range?
---
I’m sorry i dont have money to give you gold
---
the head hitboxes are so big in siege that it wouldn't even matter.
---
Happened to me too last week. Really pissed me off. I played on hoping people would join but nobody did.
---
Pulse is much much worse than jackal. At least you can counter jackal when on the move.
---
I wish it was that easy
---
What do you mean by that? Do you mean we could pick between any attacker and defender and then use them on a shooting range? Because I don't think ubi will have what 90 something weapons on the table for let's say a recruit
---
Because it might be like the first 2 situations mode using only a recruit for it, it would be better picking any operators and practicing their guns.
---
Instructions not Clear- Dick got removed along with STD
---
Perfectly balanced
---
I mean ur technically massacring 5 ppl who were part of an experiment gone wrong
---
Yes it is. Don't play it unless you're a weaboo, you can do any number of other things.
---
&gt;But what can they do?
---
Again, don't they have that "you should be less than 30 level to enter" mode already?
---
No shit Sherlock
---
OMG
---
My nasally boy.
---

Hello leitgo65, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dm6fo5/april_fools_literally_unplayable/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
pulse is a bit to powerful for this mode
---
The clip is inside his shoulder or what??
---
For his neutral special, he wields a G U N
---
Thanks for this. They are still ridiculously over priced tbh.
---
Its a joke (fluff)
---
lion's ability is useless without using it with jackal, even after using it with jackal it won't give you much of an advantage because the enemy is already getting tracked by jackal, pulse is by far the best choice for this event.
---
That's what I'm saying. I've been winning a lot of defense.
---
Haven’t been on rainbow yet so what’s the event
---
Tried that in unranked only 2 of the other team agreed the other 3 were tryharding lol
---
The Halloween event that just started today.
---
WHERE DO I GET THIS, IF YOU DONT TELL ME, YOU SHOULD EXPECT A ROBBERY
---
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status
---
They have to be priced that high cause otherwise no one would buy them for real money. 
---
It’s kind of keeping it alive. To fight ddosing ubi needs to rent three times as many servers as before and that’s a fucking shitload of money. And yes rainbow is very profitable for them but it’s the game which makes the money to develop more games and stuff plus the events need to be profitable as well since why tf should they invest the time and money on unique modes if there wouldn’t be a single dollar in it. 
---
People asked for the possibility of earning them by playing. Ubi listened and people are still bitching about it. The packs only cost as much as 2.5 alpha packs which is absolutely fine imo. 
---
And your grind wasn’t 4-6 hours on a daily basis I myself grinded 120k renown in the last week just by playing thunts as a warm up and ranked games with about 5/6 hours a day so it’s not that hard. With a full booster squad in thunt it’s only like 30-35 hours which is absolutely reasonable if you really want them and don’t want to pay.
---
Why not if its a shooting range? We have nothing like a real shooting range in siege, if one is to be suggested of course you should be able to use any operator or weapon freely. Overwatch has a practice range like this; you go and do your thing on a small course using your hero, and can go back to the spawn area to change whenever youd like
---
Who was in your game xd
---
Amazon, search for rainbow six siege pop sockets might have to scroll a few pages
---
That skins dope imo
---
Cuz they are on the map? There is a glass window were you can see doc experimenting with an electric chair. It's really cool.
---
Ok cause I was hyped all day for this update but at least I have a PlayStation 🤷‍♂️
---
Ok
---
Bro thank you so much I just came here to tell what I thought about the game
---
Definitely. 300k renown in 2 weeks? If my calculations are correct you'd have to play 24/7. 
---
Glad they have the option to purchase with renown though, past events we just had free packs + purchase rest.
---
that’s english
---
I mean it’s not that expensive
---
Well you can remove a magazine, and it’s a decently long rifle so he could be putting the outer front of the Maxwell against the rear of his shoulder
---
silent?
---
Thats sekC
---
Fuck ya bro anytime man
---
Why'd you have to snitch?
---
I always have this kind of people on my team i hate it
---
You are a lucky man if you’re able to open both of them
---
I mean it's better than not being able to but even in R6 credits these cost like 60 bucks to complete the collection. Absolutely ridiculous.
---
Look at a calendar?
---
At least he tried to put the lessons from elementary of "stop, drop and roll".
---
Have you seen the jiggle on dat bitch.
---
I got the bandit headgear on my first  but I really want that one, they didn’t try on frosts headgear
---
Scary
---
Smoke looks pissed
---
It should be for pulse fight me
---
LOL i'm gonna have a nightmare over the headgear
---
I won't after the challenge is complete, like 99% of all others
---
idc about karma to express my opinion
---
Might aswell just have a 13 year old who came back from his  paintball party. Honestly though I’d love this
---
The head hitboxes are just the size of the actual head lad, not the headgear. Necks count as heads but that's different.
---
So I. Opened 3
---
Yeah but if you see the 3D model of the operator, the AR15 is rotated, so it is clearly an error in the illustration isn't it?
---
Also 2 pack of credits (donate) cost less they 2-pack.
---
Pay to lose is better than pay to win, at least
---
It's almost like this wouldn't counter an entire team, and would be more of a nuisance towards the enemy team.
---
Honestly, this event is so weak compared to last years...
---
All I notice is that you aren’t wearing a t-shirt dude.
---
That what she said
---
Cry me a river
---
****honk****
---
So does apex legends but ubi likely won't put time and resources into a shooting range, That and it would have leaked already that we'd be getting one and there's been no leaks regarding one except a developer had mentioned he knows the community wants one but it's not currently in the cards, And might not be until year 6
---
You joke but I remember when Swat 4 came out, and there was a loadout where your main weapon was legit a pepper spray paintball gun.
---
If you accidentally chose it you were locked in and almost utterly useless while your 3 other teammates had like fucking submachine guns.
---
2005 was fun.
---
Cant
---
You can’t get them.
---
Also, if you get any of the free packs when you already own all of the skins/charms then you can convert them to 300 r6 coins
---
As all things should be
---
Lucky you I guess. I got 4 left to buy cause I need to grind for more renown lol
---
what if he shot expanding foam? could still paint over cameras, and shields, but could also fill in murder holes and gaps under doors, disrupt pixel angles etc. idk
---
Can he cane downed ops? /s
---
One is a coldblooded killer, that would end a person's life within the blink of an eye, shooting them without remorse - the other one is an operator from rainbow 6
---
I can assure you that it's not a problem with Internet
---
I love the cute ghost more than some derpy muscle skull
---
Why do they include recruit in the events
---
Believe it’s the same announcer as Showdown
---
When amarus ability is actually useful
---
Lmao 😂😂😂
---
No. He is the worst one
---
This is the most stupid thing I’ve ever heard. Bruh
---
Lol
---
Incredibly accurate
---
Idk then probably contact ubi support and i'm sure you have already and maybe the internet provider as well
---
New ops. But what if they are trash like the last 8.
---
You grew up lol
---
I meant jackal is the least effective
---
I disagree with that actually. Nothing could ever be perfect, so always wanting something to be better breeds an unsatisfiable community. Like what siege has for the most part. Even if the game were perfectly coded and executed in every way, there would still be masses of angry and unsatisfied people
---
Recruit, god among monsters
---
It wasn't the speed that made Kapkan viable, it was the trap rework. His previous trap was way too obvious to anyone with even mediocre eyesight.
---
That said, for someone like Kapkan, it's impossible to be balanced for both the pros and the casuals. As it stands he's a casual, easy to use operator with a no skill gadget, and it's only really effective against people of similar skill level.
---
For Warden, it's a bit different. He could be a 3 speed and maybe then people would just play him as a roamer, and even that is a maybe. His gadget just isn't good, and I find it pointless to try to make him viable by buffing the rest of his kit. Being one speed doesn't stop Doc, Rook, Echo, Mira or Maestro from being top tier operators, so clearly it wasn't Warden't problem either.

what about a op with a cage that you put on the ceiling and if a attack op walks under it it falls and its like leashions mines invisible but can be spoted with the vector 45acp and a 12 Gage shotgun and jackles side arm shotgun and his or hers name is wrangler but the attack ops can still shoot out of it but it only stays down for 20 secions or can be destored by glazes sniper
---
At least release Ela was fun to play
---
That type of stuff will likely never be in the battle pass only regular cosmetics
---
This message showed for me but i legit just havent got a free pack at all lmao
---
Mention it.
---
Ok rush through will your whole team
---
Hey now nomads amazing
---
Omg great find
---
well last year were packs as well and I don't think you can get them seperately. As for the previous years I think they just made them legacy so if had bought them last year that was probably the only time u could.
---
Yeah. And maybe mozzie.
---
Unpossible
---
Defense is pretty easy. Camp in one room. Reinforce the walls. And just wait for them to push. Kapkan traps, frost traps, smoke, lesion. RIP attackers. And then run out once you hit the 45 secs remaining mark. Easy defense win.
---
Yeah I got this too. Being recruit is good for once
---
Why? They are all the same model just using Lion jackal and pulses abilities.
---
“hE iSn’T uSeD iN pRo LeAgUe”
---
Who actually gives a fuck
---
Kapkan isn’t pre-nerf Ela tier, but he’s still a good operator. His gadget gives you intel and can win games.
---
Except... three people hit frost traps, everyone loses 60 hp to kapkan, 1 person dies to a gu tower, and the other guy breathes in toxic chemicals
---
Pasta
---
phasing through walls
---
Not possible
---
Bruh are you retarded? I literally think you have a mental disability. They fund their game off A event like pl and it’s twitch streams. B from in game purchases which is literally the entire game. But they added a new mode with skins to ops which are way too expensive from the start. And you said it yourself. A limited time event with useless cosmetics. Meaning they just want more fuckin money on top of the cash stack they currently sit on. Maybe if they actually made a decent fuckin game mode then they would get more money. As far as I’m concerned it’s all the content creators and a very small portion of the standard community that actually buys this shit.
---
I wish we would have had a heads up and I would have been saving!
---
As it should be &gt;:)
---
Seriously tho, I have my volume quite high so I can hear enemies approaching and go invisible
---
Would definitely work with a 5 man, I play on xbox so getting randos to manage any of that would be nothing short of a miracle haha
---
You can destroy the Kapkan and the frost traps
---
you're a fucking retard
---
Really? So sitting in a corner getting lion scanned jackal tracked and pulse scanned isn’t difficult? Meanwhile it takes forever to activate your useless ability so you can’t do anything.
---
yes. its possible , it just depends on your enemys and your teammates
---
Rarly but yes
---
That's why you can wait until the actual round. It's literally casual, a game mode which is meant to be played *casually*, not like a ranked match. If it were a ranked match I'd understand, but is it really fair to effectively deny people the ability to play the game? As for the minutes thing, that's why I said you could at least wait a bit. Anything longer than a minute or two, fine, but kicking people after ~30 seconds is just obnoxious.
---
i entered on twitter with an actual selfie of the cosplay! i want the skins so bad ahhh
---
That was quick
---
How rarely is rarely?
---
thats fair

because Ubi is a business and the entire purpose of a business is to make money, and pretty simple to understand the loot packs make them more money
---
Can do that with pulse
---
Use your gadget, don't sit by a soft wall, have an exit strategy
---
RIP. 
---
We managed to get randoms on PC. It was awesome fun. And then they tried it but forgot about the window behind. Easy attack win. Lol
---
Nice, now show us SMG-11 with acog.
---
they won't do that they'd do it through situations and like I said ubi won't be updating them as they never have with the newer operators, if they ever added a shooting range it would be to test an operator with their gun and that's it nothing else, it's not apex legends with their upcoming firing range rework
---
No shit reknown is free, but they’re asking for 300k if it for all the cosmetics. You tell me the last time you got up to 300k reknown cause I guarantee you have never hit 300k reknown.
---
no..nothing old comes back
---
Then you can’t
