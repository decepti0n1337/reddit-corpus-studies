Shield ops are my favorite to play. I just like the way they change up my playstyle. I’m normally kind of unpredictable, trying to hunt roamers and bait people to follow me. But with shields it’s a lot more methodical, and I don’t have to worry so much about people lurking corners. My main goal as a shield op is this: I’m the juiciest distraction. I like to make a lot of noise, create a diversion, anything to get the attention of as many defenders as possible. It’s fun because they’re too paranoid to turn their backs (and for good reason, I’m watching for it. Had a Jager try to teabag cuz he thought I was just gonna sit there. He was dead before he got back up from the first crouch) but know they have to watch out because every second I have their attention is one second my team can move further up uncontested.
---
---
---
I tries angled grip first time today and I loved it
---
Is that haru?
---
The second you hear monty's shield go up?  His shield is really noisy when he retracts it, and no one pulls a Monty shield up without going for the ADS ASAP
---
I could be wrong here but I believe the reason there are no official Spetsnaz and S.A.S ops is because at the time there weren't women in those branches. However if you peruse the lore you'll find that Finka is part of the Spetsnaz.
---
Because it awards both teams 1 point, and since you were on matchpoint, they won because of it, I assume you were playing ranked?
---
indeed
---
For attacking my first main was IQ because I wanted to use the aug and my first defender was Jäger because I liked his gun and he seemed easy to use. Atm I use Maverick for attack and Frost for defending.
---
Thermite to Jackal and Rook to Mira. But now that jackal has been banned almost every time I am going more Maverick and when Mira is banned more Maestro.
---
nah, csgo found a really intuitive way to imement 3d mapped textures. However, there solution was an engine integration I'm fairly certain, and everyone knows the engine rainbow six is built on is pretty ass by comparison
---
This is the only the second time I  have had a serious lag moment since I've moved here, the other time is also posted here but it's during the pick op phase so no trouble, my Wi-Fi is also nearly 150 down and up. So unless my provider had a hiccup right then there was no way it was my internet. My friend was also having trouble at different points in the same game, instances where after shooting his gun wouldn't reload, or some times where his bullets also did seemingly no damage. Therefore I shifted the blame on the server, or the host of the server, because honestly what are the chances both his and my internet had hiccups during the same siege game?

Angle Grip on therms gun? It doesn't kick a lot without the grip?

yes
---
Thank you for the advice. I actually ended up requesting a refund on steam so I could just purchase it through Uplay instead. It was 8 dollars cheaper on Uplay for the deluxe edition anyway so I saved some money PogChamp
---
Used to main mira and glaz. Now I main buck on attack because of his utility, and Jager because of roaming
---
Roamers hate him, attackers love him.
---
*Get nae-nae‘d!*
---
You just need to adapt to it and it’s a headshot machine
---
More frustrating that it was a 3v1 and nobody thought to plant the fucking bomb knowing where the last guy was. Good job on OP though for outplaying them.
---
Yo that kinda like a 1000000IQ reapons
---
Yup
---
people still unironically say "dead game"?
---
Sorry for responding late, I was with my dad because, for me anyway, so it's father's day.
---
I basically just die really early, and my accuracy is very bad.
---
Obviously its not a perfect system but its definately a good idea.
---
My stats themselves aren’t great cause I played ranked when I was BAD. Now I’ve been hitting Plat consistently so you could be right.
---
TIL!
---
they took out draws and now whoever the rules decide is the winner gets the point
---
I'll have to give it a try.
---
Go play cod then lol

What are his weapons and what are the speed and armor stat?

Now who is the dumass now

Damage is not mydeciding factor either.. control and fire rate are

Thats worse than what it was earlier
---
Of fuck still me
---
Don't u mean brazilian? ;) huehuehue
---
I just realized it said loss..... my bad.... in the past it has been a draw and both teams received a point
---
Haven't played the game in a bit. Is that crackling sound part of the menu sound these days, or just a weird recording? Sounds like I'm wearing my wireless headset next to the microwave.
---
Something unique enough that people who pay attention, or even just anyone, would be able to tell that it's the net, in case they would prefer to just open up a line of site (or that's their only option)
---
I wonder if I'm wrong, but when I play console I use a higher sens in order to change directions a lot faster than most players, but doesnt a lower Sens mean better precision?
---
3 ranked games the last 3 days I lost because of this. Some real human filth out there
---
This is punishment for being a BB player
---
Cool, I actually have most of those. Just not thermite, doc, and Jäger. But I will work to unlock those as soon as possible.
---
Oh I agree it's a good idea but gotta find a way around that first cuz I can't tell you the number of times I've solo queued with toxic 4 stacks
---
If you used to find yourself winning a lot of casuals that’s likely the reason it’s more challenging now, and Yh if you’re a consistent plat player I would consider you good
---
Update: (I’m the friend) this just happened to use again. Enemy team is TKing and 2 of our guys just crashed. THis GAMe juSt KeEPs GetTinG BeTTeR

I downloaded siege deluxe edition off of the Microsoft Xbox store but didn’t receive anything. I only have the normal game, no operators or anything! Please help me
---
It’s still fun
---
(ring ring)
---
Hey Grace, how you doing?
---
"Pretty good. At work. Hey, where are you right now? Like... where exactly?"
---
Yeah these ghost kills seem to be getting worse.
---
It was 2-2 casual
---
What? MuTadre is just a stupid name my friends and I use because it is like tu madre which is “your mom” in Spanish
---
Also, that was the first round we won as a team, we were losing 0-2
---
I can't tell it sounds like it's happening in a rhythm
---
I’m torn on house. I love how simple it is, but if I’m off my game then I just get destroyed on it because there’s an angle on you no matter where you are pretty much
---
Maverick, guns-good, ability-fucking awesome if you’re using it, annoying as hell if not.
---
Well, as I wrote earlier, I die a lot and I'm not very accurate. But I also don't know the maps at all really, and I don't know any audio cues. (I'm really new to the game.)
---
I fully agree with you on that. Perhaps some sort of system that can detect if players reporting around the same time were grouped together. It would stil require manual review but it might be a bit harder to game as it were.

Interesting, well GG, I think my team won that game by two close calls with the defuser

I think he's a bit too disruptive. He has three scans each one pinging someone five times. I think it they dropped each scan to pinging three times it would be less oppressive.
---
Maybe just a buff for castle??
---
Go to manage game and add ons than go to ready to install try that
---
Cause he's fucking amazing on Bomb. He's one of the most played defenders in Pro League for example
---
really?
---
I guess it’s because if anyone dies first on the first or second round they just quit and search for a new game I’ve seen it so many times already and since phantom sight it became worse I believe especially in the discovery playlist I also nearly exclusively join ongoing matches and started to think its better to just abandon them and look for new games

Well that was more literal than I anticipated. Noice.
---
I refute you in that I have played with the same group since Parabellum. I have been a higher rank than them the entire time. Boosting is purposely finding lower ranks, these are simply my friends. I will explain further if you don't understand how I am a higher rank if they are gold.
---
ACOG angled flash all the way and I’m on console too
---
I dont

:(

On the other hand they still haven't fixed the deployable shields.... so c4 or no gadget most of the time...
---
WHHATTTT!?

To the back rooms you go

Just a graphical error, when i first saw it i thought z fighting. But that's seems to be just a lighting/shading error.
---
What about a hidden matchmaking for people who have more than 3 level difference in parties and they only get paired up with similar stacks? Or a similar system with no mmr that incorporates solo ques as well which would help people practice the pick and ban/3 defense attack mode? I know people want to play with their friends but it's hell for solo ques, myself included.
---
aaahhh
---
r/ihadastroke
---
You don't like red dot?
---
hes one of the most infuriating ops to die to. you can almost everything right in a round, have a perfect plan of defense, counter strat perfectly for where you think people are gonna enter, and then some brain dead shitty jackal looking at the ground just immedietly gets free info with no risk and it just feels so punishing. He rewards players for doing nothing
---
it is indeed this
---
I follow some rules.
---
1) I investigate what kind of operator is needed in the game right now (Watch gameplays/pro league, it's useful for inspiration).
---
2) I have to be sure that I like my own idea.
---
3) Don't make something that's impossible to program (the game has limitations).
---
4) Make it for the players not just for you. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Then I just develop the concept. Make it simple but detailed. I make the logo, choose a name and guns and that's it.
---
In casual people just play for fun and for kills, in ranked it’s all about winning. In ranked I would never rush the last player, but in casual I would go do it to get the extra kill
---
same. :)
---
Hey how do you get the operator icons next to your name
---
Not for me. Defense rounds feel bad and then attack rounds feel bad since it’s so attacker-orientated. Same reason why Tower sucks. Too defense-orientated and it’s just set up poorly
---

 Time to change your Flair

OOOOOOOF you right
---
When she was leaked, the leaker referred to her (or the source that leaked to leaker referred to her as, cant tell) 'one of the cutest' operators out there so they 'could imagine her being a fan favourite'. Given the fact that she's vieled, I think the leaker knew something about her facial model and elites that we don't yet. (There is concept art of Nokk without headgear as well, can't leave that out. But hard to tell from the art she's in.)

---
Nice job man, I just got diamond this season gl on your journey.
---
Seems cool, just shooting through it would cause a lot of headaches I'm sure
---
This shit literally just happened to me and I have no proof.
---
1. Who said he could see you completely? You didn’t show the killcam (and killcams are bugged anyway)
---
2. You did see him. He could see you more clearly because he had the high ground and he had a better angle
---
I understand hibana, but doc.....damn.
---
True
---
Its a bug
---
How about a Defender with an ability similar to Lions, but it only shows electronics. Quick map wide pulse that spots enemy electronics for 1-2 seconds.
---
Well I'm level 10 and get matched with level 90s.
---
Because Ubisoft said "Fuck your lore and fuck your realism" when they went in the Esports direction. If we balance according to "lore" and "realism", Siege would be a very different game.
---
Stop complaining about shit you can't change, man! Use that brain of yours AND ADAPT!!
---
There is a series of videos on YouTube called seige school, those were helpful for me starting out.
---
Beyond that, knowing what operator you want to use and how to use them (their gadgets and weapons) is important. That and just learning the maps. Knowing where they will be before they pop up really helps, that will come with time and experience.
---
Nice
---
Im not sure if i like this or not... Feel like this would get annoying pretty fast
---
I'm failing Irish
---
Is it back ? I thought it still made you come out of ADS ?
---
Thank you very much 🤗
---
I totally support this! Would you be against the ability acting how lions gadget used to; completely highlighting ops/drones etc in a red outline? Or would the ping system work as it does now?
---
Well if its casual who cares
---
My comment was going to be that a lot more of the attackers carry around electronics than the defenders do. But I also have to point out that isn’t the defender equivalent to IQ kinda pulse ?
---
The fact that jackal, an underpicked, underperforming operator has one of the highest ban rates in ranked is really indicative of the ranked players' average mindset.
---
Of course he's not going to be banned every game. Monty's not particularly useful without comms.
---
I'm lowkey disappointed in this community that no one has referenced this meme, ok I'll do it.
---
*Bravo six, going dark.*
---
Its on pc, but not console
---
Of course, dont give up, it takes time to pick up. 
---
And remember good tactics can make up for you being bad (or at least that's what I tell myself)
---
They kind of are though. I play on PS4 and place in gold 2 almost every season. I’ve never made it to plat 3. I get close but still end up getting wrecked.
---
Neat I can find stats that back up what my point too: https://mobile.twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1097599847266426884?s=09
---
If you go back even further he had a ban rate of 4%. One event doesn’t really prove your point
---
ah fair enough
---
What would you write when you want to forbid a different input device? Would you forbid hacking software?
---
You are stretching the definition here and you know that yourself. Ubisoft has known about this for years and they do not change the ToS. Think about that. Also it is no problem on PC for any game. Nobody there ever would call you a cheater for using a different input device in any game. Because it simply is not cheating.

You can mount me lord
---
Im a 42 on PC so I know how to play. Also I stand correctex you have to be a level 30 to enter ranked.
---
"...Take you out of the fight for 30 seconds..."
---
You really don't get it, do you? Yes, your pinged for 30 seconds. It's not the end of the world because A) Jackal and Co has to come to *you* to take advantage of that ping, and B) If Jackal and Co are hunting you down for 30+ seconds, that's 30+ seconds they are not pursuing the OBJ. 30+ seconds less to plant the defuser, 30+ seconds less to get into the room and remove the Gu needle, etc etc ET FUCKING CETERA!
---
That little theme that plays before the match starts has always been so nice
---
Uh of course.  Get stomped on by a 5 stack of Euro plats/diamonds and they exploited a bug. I have the worse luck
---
Noted
---
You make a totally valid point, but in my experience I die 9/10 from getting constantly pinged over and over from dead attackers using sneaky drones than me actually scanning one through a wall and floor.
---
Anticheat and antivirus are very similar, things need to be detected, then they need to figure out how it works before they can disable it. If they don't properly figure out how it works then they can end up breaking the game for everyone.
---
I watched the killcam. He didn't even have his crosshairs on me but a stray pellet killed me.
---
People don’t want to worry about a roamer with an ability like hers
---
Mu Tadre. I’ve seen him in a couple games.
---
Ahh, so I gotta unlock the basic operators?
---
I just don't like people who spread false information then make up bullshit to pretend like what they said isn't wrong.
---
Honestly I think Tower is so much worse. I honestly don't mind playing on Theme Park. I am excited for the rework tho
---
I feel like it’s more of a comfort ban than a tactical ban. People just don’t want to have to worry about her.
---
Oh ok, that doesn't make sense the base game doesn't come with the base game?
---
B- is all I can do.
---
Garbage people who should play fortnight instead
---
But its not a .bnk file.  It's a FORGE file, of "Cowboy Events 'bnk' GI Data"
---
I think it’s a pretty popular opinion that fortress is ass and shouldn’t be in ranked
---
It's a payday 2 reference since my screen was slightly tilted
---
Cav is more of a comfort ban bro. Alot of people would rather attack knowing they dont have to worry about cav then attack with the chance if being interrogated. Cav if played properly can be devastating to the attacking team even if dokkabei is used
---
yeah no cav is worth a ban
---
Ik, I get that.  Believe me, I think Cav's annoying, too.  But wouldn't it be better to ban an Op that's both annoying and *actually* worth banning.  For instance, Echo is just as, if not more annoying than Cav, and unlike Cav, can have an actual impact on the game, so banning Echo would fall under both comfort and tactical, furthermore I'd rather worry about Cav than Echo.  See what I'm getting at?
---
nah he just has a good gaming chair
---
You really need to grow up
---
Yes, however, there are operators that are both more annoying, and more powerful than her, including but not limited to Maestro, Echo, and Lesion.
---
Was it just that round
---
IQ should be s++++ teir cause she thick she fast and she easily best op on attack and defense
---
Yeah that’s me, sorry if I bothered you or anything, I used to team kill quite a bit lol.
---
Nice Aim
---
It would be fair if they reduce the losing points by number of players left, as for example if you going to lose 100 points and 2 players left, then 40 points should be lost, or just reduce points for full team and if team lost because of leavers, players who left should carry all the lost points instead of who stayed.
---
I know such a system like that might get exploited, but currently they exploit it as well, it is hard to fix this issue to come with fair solution (for who left because of crash, or real connection issue) but still there is someway I'm sure to count the frequency of this behavior.
---
For me until Ubi fix this if I left like this in ranked with 2/5 or 3/5, I leave too, it is unfair to lose my points because of cowards leaving the match.
---
Ubisoft must do something, ranked is not fun because of this issue.
---
Surrender should be a better option like if team surrender because they outnumbered they deserve less points to lose, and full points losses for who left.
---
Base game operators. As in the operators that were in the game since release.
---
Going straight for the throat, I see.
---
Happy cake day dude!!
---
And Tachanka is your god respect him
---
Thanks! 😃
---
aw fuck
---
No she isn't.  Cav isn't worth a ban.  She's easy as hell to counter and can be easily played around.  I'd rather ban an op that actually has an impact like Lesion.  Not saying Cav isn't good, but there's tons of ops that are actually worth a ban.
---
But all don’t have such a direct affect on everyone. No one wants to worry about a sneaking cab and have to listen closer and as soon as she does get a pick everyone is affected
---
He starred shooting first 🤷‍♂️ Be more prepared for a gunfight next time.
---
You really need to learn to accept that you're sometimes wrong about things. We all have things to work on  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Don't be too eager to get kills and slowly turn your corners and analyze every room you go in. Take your time. You have to be expecting an enemy to be at all angles and prepare for it on console. On PC, you can just hit em with a flick and fuck em up
---
Oh absolutely. Echo, maestro, mozzie or even kaid would be better bans imo just to get rid of their utility. I don’t agree with the cav bans, that’s just the only reason I can think why people would be banning her.
---
I'd rather attack knowing I won't be getting stunned by Echo, spied on by Mira, looking down every two seconds for Gu Mines, or shot at by Evil Eyes.
---
My point is that while yes, Cav is a comfort ban, there's *tons* of ops that can be just as, if not *more* devastating than Cav(take Echo and Maestro for example) while also having more of an impact than her.
---
Valkyrie. Literally everyone that isn’t me can somehow control her guns perfectly and have the best c4 throws
---
Lel
---
use the rainbow 6 community discord and you’ll find players
---
I started maining Fuze and Doc.
---
Everytime I unlocked a DLC op I used to play only with that op until the next one but Frost, Maverick and Lesion where the ones that I played a lot.
---
When I unlocked all the ops I started playing Bandit a lot.
---
Now I main Random but Rook is the one I pick the most if I don't do random pick, I never found an Attacker to main tbh.
---
what the fuck
---
Nah, I was joking. It wasn’t a bad video. The first minute and a half was kinda boring though.
---
thats kinda op if u can reinforce the outside hatch without risk urself
---
Since clash is banned if you vote for no ban it just puts clash there, whether it's attack or defense. I don't really know why they did that but whatever.
---
No one wants to worry about Gu Mines either...or Yokais...
---
Use Dokkabei.  It's very simple.  In fact, I'd even argue that *echo* isn't worth a ban 100% of the time because IQ exists.  But Echo is worth a ban.  Lesion is worth.  Cav?  No
---
Bud you can't prove one is better than the other.
---
Like you can't objectively say Hanzo is better than Widowmaker.
---
Or Call of Duty is better than Battlefield
---
It's all personal preferene, anything responded by you will be blocked, I'm not wasting anymore time with you

---
Jackal, he must have a foot fetish to know every operators footprints by looking at them
---
That hit home, pal
---
If anyone did that at my range they'd be immediately told to leave... One dumbass hitting the news for shooting someone would probably be enough to get a range closed in my country.. or stricter regulations.
---
For real though If it was self loading with a light enough trigger she probably would've shot herself in the ass.
---
Sadder than a guy who is into anime titties? I think not loser.
---
Yeah, I get that.  But the only reason I see is "she's annoying" yet there's equally, if not more annoying defenders, like Lesion, Echo, Mozzie, etc, that also have an actual impact on the game.
---
It's just frustrating to see my team rush to ban Cav when there's plenty of Ops that are actually worth banning tossed aside cuz they can't be bothered to drone or use Dokk.
---
My vertical sensitivity is 30 and horizontal sensitivity is 35. Also that would be great, what's your psn?
---
my deepest apologies. &lt;3
---
My head hurts just by looking at this.
---
How is this possibly his fault?
---
restart your game its a visual bug on the alpha pack system
---
Throw a new drone out, it helped me [PC]
---
Sneaky snek
---
With his left arm, duh
---
I just did. Why do I have to do it again?
---
Thx
---
Just another reason I left CoD.
---
All those whines and yelps... I'm a fucking monster, and I told myself, never again.
---
Makes me moister than an oyster
---
Nice View
---
Going up there is old, but I’ve never seen getting up there that way. 
---
Thanks for giving me an easier way up!
---
This is not "my content", this is content that came with the game. 8 operators came installed and no way to purchase or unlock.
---
Yea I get that and in fairness to Op there is no such thing as a bad ace. Just thought I’d point out the nightmare that can be solo Q’ing even on casual. But like I said GG Op great ace
---
you can't play the game correctly without the base operators
---
It wouldn't let me do anything lol
---
Console really is something else
---
Thanks
---
Listen to this, the Arabic pronunciation of Kaid:
---
https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:Ar-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF.ogg
---
and if you want to argue that "this is just how it is now" then that's fine. I paid for those operators on disk and digitally at least do the right thing and transfer them. I didn't get this from GameStop
---
for the 8 operators he probably has to play 1 hours, you really cry about this? probably that talk with the support was more than 1 hour xD
---
You cant be mad when theres a Nomad.
---
Yeah I made it, also made one for KiXSTAr
---
Yes
---
congrats bro. time to join the ranks
---
Ubi fix this game. For example: clutched a round, endgame screen shows enemy under my name
---
just play 1 hour and you got the operators, the talk with the support took probably way longer
---
Hibana should be a
---
jaegers gun is definetly s+
---
serves u right for playing yacht
---
Here’s a tip there’s never a valid reason to equip suppressors on any guns. It affects your damage in a negative way and isn’t worth it in the slightest bit.
---
People ban Blitz instead of Montagne and Fuze even tho. (imo) they are waybetter than him in bomb.
---
Maybe you know. Keep it on the down low as a secret plan. Shout it to the world, it'll never be an advantage.
---
I dig it
---
What do you mean a nail gun?
---
pretty accurate but cav could be moved to A rank
---
Pun intended?
---
First time i got hibana i saw a rook as an easy kill then my recoil on it kills me so thats why its in A
---
Like the one Kapkan uses to put his traps down
---
Go to Facebook for this shit, don’t karma fish here. Just do comments if you really want to.
---
Yeah, I go by that. But with operators like Nokk, her main ability is built around stealth. So I wouldn’t see why I shouldn’t run an add on that benefits that.
---
Kill em with kindness.
---
why the fuck  are the  shields gone  again?
---
Pick and Ban exists to let your team completely ignore certain operators; clearly she gets banned because people dont wanna deal with her.
---
lmao did you think people were just gonna ban the operators YOU would prefer not to deal with?
---
can someone provide context to me? thanks
---
tHiS gAmE iS bRoKeN
---
Wow how you did it, you still very low level!
---
I mean they could have replaced his impacts with the c4 i stead of the barbed wire
---
Not even god could save her
---
Don’t worry everyone I am just as confused as you in this thread
---
Yeah my point was that if there’s a place to solo Q it’s definitely in casual
---
They deserved it.
---
Hit reg is broken. Not necessarily the game.
---
F
---
Like which guns?
---
Brilliant
---
Wow so the nailgun is a glitch, and this is not the place to cry about tking. Its casual get over it.
---
I bet you didn’t own a lambo which shows on your profile picture :D
---
Having impacts is actually a buff. Think about it. Now if Maverick makes holes to deny bandit tricking. You can just impact trick using the holes instead.
---
Please tell me the bandit part is a joke
---
Surprisingly that’s what we lack. Everyone anchors!
---
Last time I got an alpha pack I went to the menu and it said I had no alpha pack.
---
Impacts on bandit will be so good, I’m looking forward to this.
---
Yeah and on defense fire power is everything? Is that why an smg with mediocre damage with acog as its only selling point was nerfed?
---
Its will help with impact tricking but plant denial is being hit hard.
---
Got it once .
---
But got kicked .
---
Yeah bomb can play really slow at times
---
 I don’t think you can change the style of iron sights but you can replace them
---
It looks like all fixes ubi made, failed hard.
---
Do we have any good news for RB6?
---
How can i get those icons?
---
He forgot the first rule of survival
---
It was during the new season, but i’m 100% sure i was on my native server. Guess i have no choice but to do them all again :/
---
Yeah
---
I finally feel ranked is no longer RNG based on who starts as defense when we get SA or hostage. The game is balanced around bomb, and it should be the game mode that is played in the competitive playlist
---
Facts
---
thank you that worked.
---
I'm Retarded for not thinking of that earlier.
---
needs more upvotes
---
I rarely see Bandit be used for plant denial. In Pro League they do but in Ranked, people just don't play Bandit that way.
---
Poop in a stick 666
---
&gt;Without losing any critical utility 
---
Those 3 stim shots are really useless arent they.
---
I find it funny how doc which needs to survive longer than rook is not only more popular but used by fraggers more often than rook.
---
Im seeing inconsistencies in your argument.
---
I'm sorry I'm having a hard time to understand that method. An impact won't be able to deny a Mav hole rather it will just blow up the Shock wires in the vicinity. Can you further elaborate?
---
I have a cav echo jackal main in my team, safe to say he screams alot lately
---
For me, it‘s one of the best seasons in a long time in terms of the ranked system. I hate all the sound bugs, the temporary clash and shield ban etc. but I love the op ban system and having only one side swap until overtime. The only things I‘d like to see would be a reduction of the map pool according to current esl rules, a 7s defuser timer and a ranked mode that ends at 7 and not at 4 round wins. I get your frustration in terms of the play modes and I think that they could‘ve introduced different ranks for bomb, secure, and hostage to keep the other two modes as well for their respective player bases.
---
I never fucking said anything about pro league being the be all end all and only referred to it briefly.
---
&gt;cav is banned every game.
---
Are you in silver? Ive never had a cav banned in my games.
---
I've never seen pulse banned (why would anyone ban it?). Not sure about maestro. The thing about caveira for me is the fucking crabwalk silent step peek where she is basically at prone level, it's annoying as hell.
---
1st Body shot- 2nd shoulder shot
---
I really expect Ubisoft to bring echo down a notch so he isn’t “as heavily relied on” in bomb.
---
And now writing in chat is not allowed at all or you'll get banned, because no swearing in our mature rated game
---
The new scope mechanic makes it basically useless. If he's meant to hold angles rather than push he needs a massive damage increase, especially at range
---
Wym every post on redddit about the new season and in every other of my game at least there’s a cav ban
---
Majority of the defender weapons are underpowered compared to the attacker weapons. So weapons with acogs or high firerate weapons are loved more than the standard sets of SMG choices. 
---
The MP5 was low recoil decent dmg smg with an acog. With the 1 shot headshot system your dmg doesnt matter as much as firerate, recoil and long range effectiveness. 
---
Thats why the Mp5 needed a nerf, it was challenging attackers directly with a defender weapon rather than using utility and teamwork on defense to counter the better attacker weapons.
---
I dont get why people ban these operators.
---
I wouldve crucified him if i got him on my team on ranked oh God
---
Dope!
---
Ohhh they are gonna have to glue her back together IN HELL
---
I can't begin to contextualize why everyone is so up in arms to ban Cav over Echo. At the start of a game we get 4 ban Cav votes and then everyone whines when we're powerless to the fatty, even with electronic denial.
---
I think early on there was a leak saying mozzie was the attacker and gridlock was the defender, so they probably just got confused when they eventually came out.
---
such bullshit they got rid of hatch
---
Eh I like it
---
Casual… Activated.

Choose a different title and re-submit your post. Thank you.

I'm at the point where I stopped playing with a friend altogether on r6 because ranked is the only mode he plays. I told him I didn't want to deal with sweaty people and wanted to just chill and not try and he said some bullshit about "just chill on ranked dude" and doesn't fucking get that when I play ranked In trying to get my rank higher instead of fucking around. Im a plat player but get stuck mid-gold because of him and getting bitched at if I don't play ranked, and by the time the season ends I'm getting the minimum mmr and don't have enough time or energy to grind out plat
---
F for bandit

I think the star wars "I love democracy" meme would also be very fitting lol

Nice i have absolutely no clue why it repeats sorry guys

Maverick makes hole at the bottom of the wall to get your batteries. Now that he has holes there, you can't bandit trick and deny a breach from Thermite or Hibana because Maverick will just hold the angle on the peekhole and shoot you if you come close to the wall. 
---
With impact nades, you can fall back, wait for Thermite or Hibana to start breaching, and just throw an impact at the hole that maverick made. The blast radius will ensure that the Thermite charge of Hibana pellets will be destroyed.
---
The problem with pick &amp; ban is that most of us non-esport, average players will just ban Caveira that requires just a tiny bit more coordination to get rid of. This is why I tend to play in a 5 stack because then there is actual communication in the game and other ban-worthy operators get banned.
---
Ok thanks

Map knowledge is something that takes time to develop. I would start with learning the names of the rooms (on the bottom of your screen, it has the name of the room for reference) or common call out spots so you can give proper call outs like "bottom of yellow stairs" instead of just saying "on my body" or "to your right". Another factor of map knowledge is knowing what floors and ceilings are able to be broken, and what area you  would be looking at if you were to break it. This is why Buck has a lot of potential on some of the defender sites because on some sites the ceiling or floor is able to be destroyed with his shotgun. With that knowledge, he would be able to go to spots where anchors or gadgets such as bandits batteries and miras black mirrors would commonly be at and pretty much get an easy kill or make their gadget useless.
---
Like dodgy. Like I miss really easy kills etc
---
Git off your ass and contribute to the team in a meaningful way besides giving the attackers eye cancer temporarily and getting domed in ot.
---
STOP
---
Do people use the BOSG? people prefer the Mk14 more I know its more practical because of the clip size but what are the advantages and disadvantages of it?
---
These pickrates are from plat and diamond ranks. Majority of the doc players are not in the site healing defenders while anchoring. 
---
Doc players use the healing for themselves after early game engagements and while delaying attackers while roaming. This is not a critical utility like echo, maestro, or c4 operators in site for plant denial. 
---
Doc had higher pick rates and Rook had higher win rates, both had equipment to delay their deaths while also not having equipment that helps in plant denial so their deaths does not affect the team too much other than manpower.

Jk, Fortress is mediocre but I prefer it over Hereford.
---
&gt;headshots
---
Headshots aren't the definitive decider. If it was, lmg and the p90 would be meta because p90 is 50 headshots per mag right?
---
&gt;challenging attackers directly.
---
So I guess jager, bandit, alibi, vigil, echo (since there are plenty of agressive echo players that spawnpeeks with drones), and mozzie all needs their guns nerfed since they challenge attackers more directly right? Mozzie takes a bit more planning than others but still.
---
Now I'm going to ask you to kindly fuck off because you're literally just doing this for karma and giving the most generic, predictable, and common replys just to get karma.

Im not even going to respond to your comment anymore.

i fell sorry for you, i'm a blitz main that prefers not to camp in the corner but not rush, something between i've had one action ruined by a cav main and echo main camping in corner, but campers are dicks

are we sure that this tweet is real? can‘t find it on twitter, there‘s this mistake (been ... been) and the letters of the paragraphs look different
---
Man, you play echo wrong if you’re doing that. So, git gud. 
---
Also, no one wants to hear you bitch and moan, so how about you just hush instead of pointlessly bitching on the internet?
---
nice

Nevermind missing the barricades, they just missing castle

There is zero toxicity in Siege and For Honor compared to Rust, gotta play that one for a week and then come back

I never thought that nades can do that, well you learn something new everyday. Come to think of it i now agree that nades are more useful to bandit.
---
Yep, you can tell by the button icons under the menus select thingy at the bottom of OP’s screen.
---
i think it would be really op if kaid could electrify it
---
Were speaking facts not opinions. You dont like it? Fine. But kinggeroge aka former pro player and top 100 na ranked thinks the gun is stupidly good and questions ubisofts balancing team.
---
If they lowered the ping count and decreased the scan time it would be a solid balance imho
---
Yup. It ha sbeen in the game for a while, it's about time XD
---
No one does any interesting bans. I think people forget the point of it.
---
I like the idea but may I also ask how TF you got multiple ops as your user flair? (I don't use this subreddit very often)
---
*inserts cat in the hat meme*
---
Still ten more than me :(
---
No. The mp5ds literally has less horizontal recoil. Im not shitting you. Play in a private server and try it your self.
---
Don’t play echo
---
Forgot the part where they tk eachover

on mobile when you choose the flair, click "edit" and then start typing :ela: :zofia: etc

No probs. Glhf.
---
Welp that gave me a stroke lol
---
On your team?
---
It's because you're not using the PMM
---
Favela is a bad map because literally, almost the entire map's wall is breakable, imbalanced. In order for Defender to win, to counter the Attackers they've to play extremely aggressive, like having run-outs. If you play as an Attacker in that map you've to expect multiple run-out to surprise you because that's LITERALLY the most effective way Defender able to counter you. 
---
The spawnpeek is not a problem in that map, the problem is the play style, and the map itself. Just simply pick any operator like Maverick/Thermite/Hibana/Capitao, open walls, expose the Attackers, cover your Defuser from another place then tAdAh. Mostly you'll win if your team cooperate well, Defender couldn't do shit to counter if your team is fast enough. In other maps (except house) we could turn the tides as Defender, in Favela either you play it like your life depends on it to win, or you just suck thumb and ready to get bullied.
---
I would fuck him out of main

Yes.  Yes we are.

Oh how the turntables
---
just because i had good timing on having my phone in hand, and i just wanted to show this and not open obs or fraps
---
Er no, I didn't say its to make me feel more important. Without some background there is absutelt zero credibility.
---
Atleast there is a shred of credibility potentially there. Then again you aren't supposed to believe everything you see on the Internet.
---
At the end of the day, just looking for an update to one of the most hurtful issues in the game and one that has been around for over a month now with no fix which actually sees a defender who yiu can still pay for not usable in game.
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
BTW, Thermite *is* FBI SWAT
---
But it’s so much better with obs or whatever, the quality is shit and we can’t see anything when you use your phone
---
I've been having this issue too, from my POV the enemy fires two or three shots but then on kill cam they dump half a mag into me, not ping issue as I am always less than 15 ping
---
It would be fine if it handled squads with high mmr difference different.
---
also
---
&gt;for ranked
---
??? it's the same system for casual as well
---
Now that was awesome
---
WE have spoofed into LatA before. We know how the settings work. We were definitely in NA tonight. Ubi goofed.
---
I do but only for my self
---
XD
---
No it doesn’t, jackal doesn’t even counter cav it’s the other way around
---
Is it good?
---
"we will provide you with updates as they become available" so since the start of the season there has been absolutely zero progress on the removal of drop shorting Again and the fact that an operator is not allowed to be used at all but you still have them for sale with both renown and credits, the latter actually costing a user money.
---
I don't even think this is wood. It's literal feces.
---
Imagine banning cav at all
---
I mean... its pretty clear what’s happened in this clip?

---
Clash is a riot control officer.
---
Whilst they appear friendly during peaceful protests they have to be able to look incredibly aggressive and threatening when things turn bad.
---
If yiu try to look aggressive and threatening in posture you will find you facial expression changes and even how you hold your head

Fun fact, your body posture and facial expressions will always match how you feel.

To

"That's not what i meant (probably is since he didn't read it), it's actually [insertsome excuse to see if his downvotes go away]"
---
Skill level plays a factor (planting defuser, accuracy etc) and I think teammates do too. For what I see Bronze IV seems a bit low for you, but i dont knuw.
---
If you can catch an operator mid turning of the phone you can guarantee a kill pretty much. It can also give you a rough idea of where the operator is cause of the buzzing it emits
---
r/woooosh
---
cause bacon is just a great thing to eat?! and it combines well with noodles and the light cheese sauce. you obviously don't understand what joy eating it can bring

I dont think u read the post. We realise hes balanced, but hes more annoying to play aginst than other ops. Blitz gets banned first for the same reason.

Not personally. As an anchor, doc and rook have the armour level to take the time to make accurate shots with the mp5 rather than need to spray hard like a roamer in my opinion.

My guess is, that this person is pretty new to the game and played BB maybe once or twice.   
---
He does not really know what to do with himself/herself around the point of 20 seconds and seems to trying to get on the small roof, while rappeling on this wall.   
---
People with some hours into this game know, that they can't get on this small roof in that way.  
---
If you look how he/she uses the Desert Eagle you see him/her using it in a somehow odd way, like he/she tries to use this gun like a P9 or a 5.7 USG. That makes it feel like he/she never really used that gun before and tries to force it into the shooting pattern of a smaller caliber pistol.  
---
But why am I not really surprised that this is again a video from a german speaking player?   
---
Is it just me or are they really the most toxic people in this game who really love this kind of trash talk?  
---
Everytime I see someone posting such things, people starting trash talk while backseat gaming or when there are useless teamkills for no reason, I hear people speaking german or this specific way to speak "th" in the voice chat that is very common in "german english".  
---
Last weekend I had 3 super toxic moments and I either heard people speaking german believing nobody would understand them in any way or they showed this super obvious "th", when they spoke.  
---
There is a reason why people call this community toxic and I realls dislike how some people take every possible occasion to make us look like we are as toxic as the Overwatch or Moba community.  
---
  
---
But the most funny thing is, you call this Blackbeard trash, while you died to people who seem to hit nothing at all.
---
You keep trying to blame everything other than yourself for losing. With this mindset, you will never get better.
---
Is that character just straight from like bo or something?
---
550 for a maska? Did you buy an actual helmet for a cosplay? Because 20 seconds on Google brings up replicas for 199 USD.
---
The groin punch on goku was the funniest moment on the entire show
---
Hewasy u sway. What dwo u mwean. uwu
---
The pistol can’t kill downed attackers for a few seconds to avoid accidentally killing someone you want to interrogate
---
I thought it was Journey's End without elite as well?
---
Folk, i literally said I'm nowhere near a pro at this game. Yeah, it's true i get hardly any kills some games but at least i actually know how to play the game.
---
Plus I'm mainly annoyed at those who team kill for no reason and those who leave halfway through a match, which i would never do either.
---
Plastic 4
---
I was thinking Thatcher or maybe even Harry.
---
Yeah, this has always been a recurring issue for me. So frustrating to come out on top every game and still lose because of bad teammates. Your best bet is to either join a community to play with other people, or get some friends to join you.
---
Probably best yep
---
Wait since when is this in siege
---
It's extra bulletproof now
---
I'm shit at this game... I'm really shit at this game. Like I'm abused on a daily basis for being shit of this game... But... I'm not this shit my dude.
---
A consensus has been arrived at!
---
Wtf never seen this glitch ubisoft needs to fix send in a ticket my dude
---
Welcome to controller competitive gaming
---
If I attempted it, the interrogation animation ends as soon as I swing, Cavs character model jumps, I miss, and she whips around and 1 shots me
---
Okey, il try to send it :/
---
God i kind of feel bad because i would probably be sweating the fuck out of casual subconsciously while playing with friends and dump on people like this.
---
Ranked is like a fucking joke, exploit abusers and smurfs, and the rank only represents the lobby, not you. I always carry my team but they can't hit an enemy from 2 meters, so I am stuck in fucking silver. I was gold for 5 seasons straight, I could have easily been plat, but I stopped caring because my skill only contributes 10% to my rank.
---
Wait, so ppl actually fuck around in ranked as well nowadays, cuz I feel like it hasn’t been a problem before. I switched from xb to pc last week and I don’t remember leaver or throwers being an issue on xb. Just thinking of jumping to ranked pc soon so just wanna be sure.
---
That Jager I'd say is blind as fuck while Michael J Fox here cant shoot straight.
---
Yes I bought a Genuine from Russia. Only slightly used like one bullet dent. I wasn’t gonna but some plastic replica.
---
That’s just slang for my N-word pass
---
It's been reposted millions of times. downvote op.
---
However if you check their profile, chances are they will have a similar or worse KD and WL in ranked with what we newcomers have in normal.
---
When I played with 2 100+ level friends we got a level 10 lobby.
---
This wouldnt happen on PC :)
---
I dont think it's a requium, it doesnt do anything different than the rng12 I think its more akin to killer Queens third bomb bites the dust. Very similar but still a new ability.
---
How the fuck did you do this with a controller
---
Good question, no this is not all solo thanks for pointing that out but even with our clan HG/hypedguys/ we arent able to win every ranked because we dont play too much together usualy, One clan member and I are the ones who play ranked together freaquently, so we see a lot of throwers in our team and a lot of plats in the enemy team.
---
It selects random operators. Recruit is a random operator
---
Everybody in this clip needs to uninstall
---
Instead of Jackal, we ban Maverick. And we aways win too
---
It’s a requim in the sense that it’s recoil is just so much higher
---
I know right?!
---
Thanks man, it’s a lot of fun.
---
TTHHHHHYYYYYY LLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRD
---
You noticed my Disciple
---
Wait, it needed 5?
---
Regardless, agreed. Needs 5 again.
---
I thought you said you wouldn't show anyone
---
Supr talked about this in his OTS streams. Replacing one of the better echo/maestro players for someone who plays the same role as your best player (bosco-smoke main) makes ZERO sense. No wonder things didnt work out.
---
Also they took a map off G2 and arguably should have beaten them.
---
The worst roster change of the season.
---
Supr did state that redeemer was playing worse individually, and was getting his echo drones shot alot, which if your team style is about echo helping roamers then thats fine i guess.
---
Still cant justify the change
---
Maybe the Halloween skin was a bad idea
---
It happens
---
Bro I'm level 420 and I've been waiting 69 days for ranked matchmaking, I need help.
---
True. Hits like a truck, sounds like a truck, sounds like genuine presence, even does **69** damage, but sadly semi autos don't work in siege.
---
"digga alla der is so schlecht" 
---
da muss man einfach kotzen
---
I have nothing against it
---
Might even like it a bit better this way
---
No, if all the available choices are taken it gives you recruit
---
Oh, okay. Lets say it like this:  
---
Put everything on 99 and try to hit anything with that. Your Crosshair will just fly around like crazy.  
---
But there are still people who say "Nah, this is good. You will need to be able to play like this, because you need to be able to make a 180° turn in a split second.".  
---
On consoles the chance to survive a roamer in your back are even lower compared to the PC from what I heard.
---
Maybe don't come back at all. 😁😈
---
"technically", he is a BB main. So.........
---
This fucking hurts to watch
---
What was his hp after
---
like 50-70% of the pellets were blocked...
---
Hey everyone,
---
Just here to confirm that this has been brought up with the dev team already from a previous thread and confirmed that nothing game changing or malicious can be done from this console.
---
I'd put zofia in B tier but otherwise nice
---
Because it makes you quieter, like Cav
---
LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED!!
---
welcome to the suck
---
Oh fuck i havent been able to play in a while sorry for my retardation
---
Yes. 
---
It’s called server lag
---
I have some issues with this
---
I'd put jackal S tier
---
Still the remaining pellets would have hit her head
---
Somebody explain the joke pls.
---
Dam the truth sometimes hurt
---
As funny as that is to see this happen thats pretttty stupid
---
So in this version he throws little catgirls, that start munching you?
---
Using the over 20 operators per side to versatile? Naaah, you need recruit... sure
---
Why is there a 12 year old in a Jäger costume?
---
Wholesome end to a conversation.
---
I saw this but with minecraft
---
What the fuck, thats a definition of UBIShafted right there.
---
If console its just mental support
---
Radioactive man.
---
I think it was pretty low, like 15 HP, but that just makes it more agonizing
---
In a solo queue, when you develop some level of team chemistry without even using comms... you'll be glad you guys stayed tgt
---
Shotguns don't have headshot modifiers anymore if I recall.
---
Thats not how one kill hs in siege works with shotguns
---
Daddy
---
Legendary skin
---
That you are the One, Neo.
---
Also dont take this the wrong way dont touch rank till of 90 at least
---
Damn, the bible was true after all. Lord is among us and takes care of his children.
---
i like the random pair of sandles
---
I really am sorry for you, because i definetly cant complain about bad luck for myself... My luck is actually disgusting... Second Alpha pack i opened was plasma pink.
---
I get the one where I need to stop the car but the brakes straight up don't work, but the car is speeding, so I'm trying to stop my crashing into something. No bueno.
---
People found this out in the test server, you simply go to the ini file and change the console to 1 and boom you're done.
---
Oh no oh fuck
---
droning in casual. yikes.
---
Was in the game since the start too, just doesn't feel right without the recruit. Taking barbed wire and a deployable shield would work well with operators like kaid too. Any weapon from the original 20 too.
---
I'm so proud of him for getting Ela
---
Also be prepared to swelter at summer cons lol, all that gear is absolute murder, especially if that's the same gorka 3 I got, it's the winter version.  The jacket is amazing when it's cold but horribly uncomfortable any other time of the year.
---
Thanks man, I like to get things nice and ingame accurate and I’m glad it is showing! I hope that showing stuff off can help others to maybe give it a go themselves.
---
MY EYEEES.IT BURNS.
---
But in every single way the shotgun trumps the scorpion. At any range as well. You're putting yourself at a very big disadvantage not using time shotgun. It's also a very good utility which Ela very much lacks with the loss of her impacts.
---
Blyat
---
Oh wow! Nice!
---
Maybe if I knew who that was
---
Incredible work! I hope to see more from you!
---
Really, just wanted to point that out even though it's not important.
---
Yeah I wore this at London Comicon. Was only about 25 Celsius still extreme warm!
---
Lol no. I’m level 91 and finished in Gold last season with a positive win/lose and K/D ratio. If you take the time to learn the call outs (plenty of walk through videos on YouTube) you’ll be fine
---
Do not agree at all
---
Da
---
u/nwordcountbot /u/MajesticTowerOfHats
---
don’t worry i play casual also
---
I mean, they fixed the animation for kaid's tcsg12
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
majestictowerofhats has not said the N-word yet.
---
Why should lesion be able to see where his mines are 
---
But not kapkan 
---
Or other trap ops 
---
You should be able to remember where you placed your mines if you play him 
---
The game should not have to assist you in doing that  but that's how I feel 
---
I've mained lesion in ranked since his release because of that strong Intel 
---
Why throw up a valk cam when you can throw a mini wallhacks into a doorway.
---
You most assuredly will, I’ll take some photos of my Jäger Cosplay too, and a Nøkk in progress too.
---
The headgear could probably be made from earmuffs and swimming goggles if you cut out the nose. For the pads you could probably get some football padding and strip it down a bit. Same for the leggings, if you invert some football pants and cut the streaks into the legging pads. Some skating elbow and knee pads could work well also. I don't know much about cosplay but hopefully this could help.
---
I played both rook and doc, and honestly i like rook better bc of his impacts. I also used Zofia and agree she should be higher
---
It’s could be Six or maybe the in game POTUS
---
Yes! That's awesome! Do you take them out to conventions?
---
Lord. Please, use the decocker or Safety on Pmm. It's much better than racking every time.
---
Ok so username is not the reason. Some people can vote kick if you pick new operators.
---
\*How quickly the tide turns\*
---
You are just ruining what ubi intended for him to do. He is an intel gatherer. If you take the icon away he wouldn’t be used for his gadget anymore just his good gun+impacts. Being able to see his mines is also what puts him above Kapcan.
---
Because gru mines are invisible and hard to spot it. While Kapkan trap it is easy. That's was the purpose for lesion icon.
---
I've been a hitman fan for years and 47 and I approve of this
---
Just kidding. Its actually VG for Varsity Gaming. He’s my favorite siege youtuber
---
mat\_fullbright 1
---
Yeah so far I’ve done Inivitationals 2019, London and B’ham MCM COMICON and a few ESL events.
---
Happens to my group a bit. Each of us have nights we play really well together and other we play way better if we solo que. my guess is in solo que you trust no one to do their part so you’re more free in playing 100% your way instead of part of a group
---
Can confirm Deactivated are legal, as long as you have Barrel end visibly Colored (usually orange)
---
i am level 55 i only have 2 operators(they are all overpriced) and i dont have season pass
---
i’ve got 666 hours on siege for some reason
---
The armor got placed on the paper file. The drone broke that, and the armor it was sitting on.
---
Im the kind of guy that falls for all that dumb shit in casual even tho I've been playing since Black Ice. Maybe I'm better at t hunt than casual
---
Doc heals a max of 120 hp, split between 3 people, if he can even manage to use his stem 3 times
---
Rook give a 20% damage resistance to all teammates without fail. On top of that you have a guaranteed down not counting headshots. Very helpful against explosives
---
I see what you mean.
---
Then how about this 
---
The icons will persist throughout the match even when someone steps on one.
---
Shield ops are pretty broken
---
I am sorry Comrade, Russian doctrine forbids loaded round in chamber. This will have to do. Also in all seriousness looks a bit more dramatic haha.
---
I've had more Monty/Mav than Blitz. But the other 3 for sure
---
Also montagne who is now pure cancer
---
Is this your son?
---
Is that U.K. law? Never heard of the orange tip? That sounds more like US laws?
---
Cüüüüsh digga
---
That's very cool! Wish I saw you when I traveled out to London MCM!
---
They made it but they don't spend thousands of hours getting good at it. James Naismith invented basketball and imagine how he'd compare to players even from forty years ago.
---
That what I said on my first reply. Or at least to disappear after 5-10 seconds which is not important anymore to rush against the enemy.
---
Sorry?
---
They’re doing a 1 shot pistol only custom game
---
Have u worked on a triple a game
---
Smonk misses you dearly mute main
---
Could I also ask how did you get the Doc Main thingy? I'm curious even if I'm not really main anything
---
u/nwordcountbot u/MohebPlayz

Dunno but UK. I'm Finnish, and here it's not law. Just Higly Suggested. In US it is a law. As it is In Germany.
---
That's just people. Try playing with at least one other person.
---
Ah yes
---
posts meme and also flexes in Black Ice
---
mohebplayz has not said the N-word yet.
---
just use a modified camera stsnd5
---
There were 3 Tachankas on site (I might have been the coolest one), one was a Maid on Sunday.
---
Yaaaaaaaay
---
Oh, it’s just that the person in that video looks like 8-13 years old.
---
"Specialised ops" 
---
Thermite proceeds to meme and hotbreach with his exothermic charge, and then messes up the timing so that he would blow himself up as soon as he collided with the barricade
---
My asshole was tight when you decided to play with the siege gods and not reload any of your weapons.
---
Still upset with u 4 nerfs ela main
---
It does. But looks Wrong. (I am proponent of Authenticity, even to a fault)
---
Good luck with LMG though.
---
Well no wonder its growing they suck up money like bitches and fools go for it. Like check pubg 500 bucks for an ingame outfit lmfao.
---
Not sure how that will cope with a 7kg LMG and 5kg? Ish shield.
---
He might be an I tel gatherer yes 
---
But so was lion and look how that turned out 
---
Yes lion forced you to stand still
---
But so does lesion for a brief moment 
---
(unless you like taking 4 DMG per tick of course) 
---
I've mained him since release but I still think that aspect of him is a little to strong 
---
Maybe let the icon disappear after 4 seconds after the detonation 
---
But that's how I feel about it 
---
And I respect your opinion :)
---
Bb wai you do dis.  I said im sorry
---
Oh it’s just that I thought the person in that video looks like 8-13 years old. No offence.
---
My question is who tf was that behind you missing every shot!
---
SO FUCKING TRUE
---
Marchew was meant to be matches but my Polish autocorrect kicked in 😂😂😂
---
Just saying but be happy they secretly buff u every season
---
why blitz though? I’ve never really had a problem with him let alone shields entirely
---
Thanks, yeah I like real steel but sometimes I just wanna look a bit more dramatised than click bang. Yeah I love authenticity too, most of the gear is of Russian origin. Even the helmet has taken a round.
---
Yeah I can live with that :)
---
Mate calm down it’s my preference respect that
---
Of course not. I don't know anything about development so I can't say anything about bugs and exploits because I don't know how to fix them so i assume it's not easy.
---
But 9/10 times people would still be able to tell where someone stepped in them, it's just not as easy for Lesion to instantly wall bang someone. It's not that big a Nerf for an OP that's very strong right now.
---
4inch1kid
---
Look i just want my lazor beam of a weapon i used to have and another ice cream nade back.  Along with a decent ela skin
---
Friend or foe? Nah, just stupid AI
---
I could hear this gif somehow with the Makarov being cocked
---
None taken, 20 y/o in the Cosplay actual, is me! Haha I wouldn’t put a child in this gear, the 5kg helmet might break their neck.
---
Exactly so I don't understand why ur saying game development is easy
---
Yeah and do tell me how effective that 2 shot 125 damage high drop off is being used in proper ranked play.
---
It is widely regarded as a meme cannon. That's why nobody uses it in proper, serious play.
---
Same will be the case with a bolt action.
---
Damn, wish I had the time/money to cosplay. Looks great!
---
Wouldn't it be a little unfair since you could shoot the exothermic charge/ xkairos pellets from the other side? Or is this an unintended outcome
---
Ok ill take the bait. Why do you like that particular ban phase
---
I play for fun and try to win, I'm not sure from where the idea about fun is not to try to win come from, and playing casual to win give you better skills to play rank, if you don't want, it is your will, I respect that, but other people do, so respect them.
---
If I'm joining team, I expect them to play as hard as they can, even if they don't do well, but they try at least, so I have to do my best for them too.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Yeah their names, the Title rainbow, and the Brit flag being cut off isn't noticible
---
Looks great but would have been better if you did the skin from rainbow is magic event
---
There is a recent bug where you're able to stutter forward fast, im bot sure if that is it though
---
If you're gonna play ash just treat the game like call of duty
---
A gadget that counters half the attackers utility on bomb (i.e. smokes and flashes) is far from useless in the right scenario.
---
You don't have to stand still to negate flashbangs either so it's pretty good in that regard alone.
---
My bad its stretch
---
Who designed the costume?
---
i am a poor level 190 player waiting to reach level 250 to play ranked
---
I have a ps4 we can try. The when depends on which server u on
---
Me and my friends gave up playing this shit game because of this bs. And we were all high gold-low plat. You solo queue, you get braindead retards and end up with 0-4. You queue with some of your friends, you are literally playing against the enemy team and your random mates. You queue with your friends as a full squad you get demolished by a couple of diamonds who are queuing with a copper. 
---
I'm fucking done with this game. Casual is unplayable and ranked is just pure bs. The only way to win in Siege is not play at all.
---
Not such a big deal, most Operators don’t have breaching charges. It makes entry less viable for Lion or Glaz for example.
---
Thermite only has exothermic, I would probably do the same if I needed a hot breach. I would probably mind if some nerd came in and say « what are you doing, DUH that’s not how you are supposed to use it ». 
---
I understand we don’t have all the same game style, some people have different strats. Depending on the situation you would want to be flexible, right. 
---
I consider it a pretty advanced strat ;)
---
Thanks for the correction
---
In casual tho casual people aren’t usually sweaty try hards in casual people try out new strats
---
Order an air soft one and paint it
---
You can hear the air horns in the distance.
---
You lose one round every time your draw your pistol
---
Your gun goes: TA TA TA TA!  
---
But my gun goes: BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAA!!!
---
Yeah I’m around level 100 and just got an achievement for winning a game of secure area
---
Isnt what what i said?
---
Looks cool dude might try a cheap airsoft lmg I think there is one by ukarms
---
Not THICC enough
---
Yes, yes you are

Kapkan trap

I pick up 2-3 kills a round with nokk her fmg-9 is on par with most SMGs. Read any of my other comments on nokk. I really haven't played Cav since last season so I dont know about her
---
This would be useful for reinforcing hatches that are not possible like on the rooftop of buildings.
---
Do you even have fun anymore when you play? It doesn't sound like it. I'm not being negative either. You just sound extremely ardent over a videogame. Yes, it's Ranked and competitive. But there's no reason to be a dick.
---
To each their own. Sh1t happens. Learn from mistakes and move the hell on.

I’ve been playing since Velvet shell and I’m nearly 300. I have a problem...

These people are the best lmaao

Which operator would you recommend?

Yeah someone else mentioned that and it was news to me, thanks for letting me know though
---
They already have it but you have to manually clip it
---
This is amazing!
---
I haven't played in a while. What's changed?
---
They dont do much with maps that arent in the ranked pool
---
^^^this. Me and my friends usually only play casual and we have plenty of fun while still trying to win.
---
Nothing says tachanka other than the helmet
---
*hardbass noice intensifies*
---
Eye slot glowing*
---
I’m pretty sure he is joking
---
windows and i think lighting
---
Aren't 1 and 2 already a thing? This season made switching attachments much faster and effective compared to last seasons, and you can equip Alpha pack skins from the showcase when opened.
---
The lighting has changed in multiple rooms and in bedroom one of the windows are now closed
---
Should've cosplayed Moxxie
---
&gt; I believe all debris should be rendered on the server.
---
Could you clarify this? Do you think this is they way it is or do you simply wish it was this way?
---
Either way that's a no. 
---
It's all client sided to my knowledge. 
---
They also can't make all debris server sided as that would put too much strain on the servers.
---
Why you need LMG when you have makarov?
---
Aahhh got cha love me some IQ
---
I read bread
---
I feel like that was changed across a few maps though too
---
The backflip you do when she downs you still gives it a ay that it’s Cav, but impacts work for teams that don’t communicate.
---
NOW we need this animation in-game
---
At your command lord
---
Completely agree. 99% of the dweebs that trash talk their teammates got smol wee wee sooooo
---
I like the old Hereford a lot more it was way better in terms of just casual play, I said to someone else I understand that for competitive play it's better but for just pure enjoyment  and just wanting a fun much old Hereford was way better
---
Had this happen after a game, Mine showed up after I loaded/exited the club to check challenges.
---
Well I mean it’s not only pink it’s a rainbow
---
More like just keep making unnecessary restrictions like it will effect illegal gun ownership.
---
Of you have someone on your team that just became lvl 30 it will say that for all players on your team
---
If it marked them that might make more sense than just making a noise. Similar to walking through an alibi.
---
Dontcha love how pick and ban was supposed to allow for more player creativity but all it did was allow people to ban ops that are annoying.

Can’t hack on console, so he just made a lucky prefire look intentional, you just got unlucky

Text chat doesn’t really fix the issue since almost everyone uses it to meme and say stupid stuff, talk to the enemy team (friendliness is optional)
---
To say gg at the end, and the people getting mad that they died so they start complaining about it in chat.  There are people that use it to actually communicate but with how long it takes to type stuff out its usually not that great unless they just give one word callouts like “construction” and even that isn’t that helpful.
---
Nah that Ash just got you a split second early
---
No Rainbow is Magic in here.
---
The way everything suddenly got silent and then everyone just died. Feels like a horror movie man
---
Well I've never seen anything like this on PC so...
---
*we felt that welcome mat was hard to destroy*
---
First off.......what ? 
---
*increasing the recoil on twitchs F2*
---
Annnnnnd the F2 will be damn near unusable now at anything less that point blank range to like 10 meters.......great
---
Maybe but I've always enjoyed the challenge and fun of ranked, in casual people don't always try and half the time they team kill. This isn't E Sports so I don't know why Ubisoft has taken away so much from there game. Your rank, especially on console, means almost nothing.
---
It had one staircase...
---
I'm not denying any of this and agree. And I can and do adapt. But many people can't. And it doesn't change the fact that 3-3-1 in a possible first to 4 is a bad format. It's easier to start on defence. And harder on offence. I don't think that's a crazy statement.

Hello r6bs-700001, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c1py18/matches_dont_beginps4/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Because I don't give a fook about giving info, your rank, or even my rank.
---
😂
---
I dont play ranked so I cant say much for that but if your playing casual then roam and try to be sneaky her skill is crazy if you're good
---
Yes it is easier
---
Now, here's another angle on that: how many maps have outside soft walls with LoS to spawn points?
---
Dokka’s isn’t too bad, it at least has 20 rounds. Mav’s isn’t too statistically different from the 417, and Blackbeard’s just sucks.
---
You must be kidding
---
My thoughts were that, never see hackers on console, just wanted opinions from other people! 😊
---
I am just gonna say Crosshair Placement.
---
Why Maverick? Ying is more annoying than Mav and can push harder and change the tide instantly.
---
Which will cause businesses like game farms that require guns to do half of their profits to shrink to almost nil and cause our already bad economy to drop even lower and it will do shit all
---
As someone new to the game, that seems like something I would do.
---
Yeah in summary, I want me guns haha.
---
Awesome cosplay good job. Try to make it more thicc tho. Awesome job i definitly cant achieve this talent and patience
---
I main Jackal and I can barely play him anymore . . .
---
For real holy shit. First game of the season is in new Kafe. Wtf is happening lol.
---
Right like they can't see setting up a trap, but it's even more bitter sweet when they die and you still get both kills
---
Yeah the trailers they wasted hundreds of thousands on. Instead of actually spending it on ways to fix the broken game that quarantine comes from.
---
And that is nothing like the behavior he is talking about, also if you play in a stack you are probably somewhat familiar with these people so this makes even less sense.
---
So my original point of "communication matters more, randoms dont always communicate" still stands as to why bomb is not more enjoyable for someone who solo queues.
---
My PSN is sxverxd, but I'm Silver 1, I was Gold 3 earlier...
---
Sure I’ve read somewhere that it takes into account where you finished off last season, don’t think everybody is all put in the same boat this time.
---
There is hope!
---
I don't talk to people who show each individual core with msi.
---
Yep permanent one too... All these cheaters are only the tip of the ice berg. Broken game
---
r/lostredditorz
---
They need to allow all shotguns to score a headshot. I have so many clips of being point blank behind someone or in their face and blasting them to no avail. It’s funny
---
The grind is finally over 👏👏👏
---
never understood why people hate favela so much. I'm actually a fan of %90 of the map being destructable
---
Bruh
---
Thats just something us ash jager mains do to doors
---
Yea, well I wish you luck from what I hear getting a Visa to live in America is a pain in ass :P
---
The sad thing is this sort of 3000 IQ play might actually work in Casual.
---
Yeah because everyone loves tking and leaving.
---
Fair enough
---
I have never had connection issues other than occasional lag and that lag is because of my internet *(5mb wired download speed gang)*
---
You need a speaker in one of those pockets to blast music
---
It’s not like a quiet noise, it’s like a ringing that goes on for 10 seconds until destroyed
---
All pumps have 8 while semi autos have less.
---
Blue light filter?
---
Dont forget my boi recruit. Dude got uberbanned
---
My friend got sent to the office for drawing an operator with a gun
---
You read my mind
---
yeah definitely man, it's good for new people to see these things.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhe5gtINbKo
---
That explains a lot!
---
Down votw me all you want your in the same boat as Ubi 😂😂😂 Exposive lmfao
---
It's alright, if you saw me play Zofia you'd prob cry
---
That’s a lot to remember
---
Oh hello solo que teammate!
---
LMG not locked and loaded?
---
Yeah i dont even think i could do that with my kb&amp;m lol
---
Where can buy some of these
---
What about figuratively? Or metaphorically?
---
I didn’t say you were flexing a grenade kill, all I’m saying is that in ranked this would probably not work. He most likely woulda ran as soon as you broke the window.
---
Has nothing whatsoever to do with the servers.
---
difr (do it for recruit)
---
PISTOL IN HAND AND LOADED... LET THEM COME!
---
There is less then 30 words on this screen and you cant find the one spelt wrong twice 😶😶 NA education
---
Nobody drones in low ranks.
---
ITS NOT UNBALANCED BECAUSE BOTH TEAMS GET EQUAL CHANCES!! 
---
I mean, jesus. Its not rocket science. If DEFENCE has an advantage and you both play equal amounts on DEFENCE then you both have have equal opportunity to win. Changing the order in which you play the sides has zero effect. 
---
If you have 3 chairs and I have 3 chairs it doesnt matter how you arrange them, we both still have 3 chairs.
---
This can't be right. 99% of the time I'm the lowest ping. I can tell you there is no benefit to having it. I always have a difficult time with the high pingers. Especially their peeks vs mine.
---
They don’t stand a chance
---
whats your twitch
---
Yeah the people who wrote the system have no idea how it works.
---
The gear? A mix of genuine items and replicas intended for airsoft.
---
You sound like a whiny bitch right now.
---
Promote yourself. Go into small streamer discord’s and let people know when you’re live. I recommend getting to know a few streamers that have a close knit community. They can help u
---
oof thats beautiful
---
It’s a ddos for sure...
---
Funny because I have played 1 ranked match where he wasnt banned.
---
Cool
---
Nyet, LMG Unmounted and Unloaded
---
I appreciate the concern however the Gun in question is actually an airsoft replica it has been de gassed unloaded and rendered safe. This is a controlled environment inside of my own home away from any windows so as not to alarm members of the public.
---
While I do understand that airsoft weapons should be treated as their firearm counterparts and always assumed to be loaded and dangerous, sometimes I think that it is okay to make a simple video when every attempt has been made to ensure it is a safe condition.
---
I know this may still not meet your high requirements I felt safe and so did the person recording.
---
Hello iMasi, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c1qzca/how_can_i_prevent_this_issue_please_its_annoying/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Hahaha nice
---
Why is he trash on console?
---
Blitz isn’t trash??? What’s your rank? If you’re in the low gold/high silver than that’s your answer
---
Still a badass costume i would love this in an airsoft game ;-;
---
yes.
---
You got that NA Education
---
Keep trying. You're just wrong :)
---
You can see the outline of his weapons. Spear and pmm. Looks like well get another season of ops with recycled guns. Engine limitations were talked about how crippling its gotten so i wouldnt even expect new guns anymore at this point. Surprised they can even put in maps
---
Don’t be a dick it ruins it for the controller players
---
I try to help silver and lower as a diamond, well last season diamond.
---
Just kidding hauss, I was mocking the people who actually care. I play airsoft myself, and I feel wayyyy safer not having trigger discipline with a toy gun than an actual firearm. Cool cosplay though!
---
Ikr, I only came back to seige a few days ago after a long break and started playing some ranked and kept wondering why Blitz and Montagne are getting banned.
---
I get what you mean but i still thing the horizontal recoil is to much, i'd prefer onother gun or a rpm nerf + recoil buff
---
Why does she have 2 weapons that are "useless" above like 7m. But if she's meant to camp why is she a 3 Speed? i really think she needs a small rework but that doesnt mean shes useless since im an ela main since the first leak when she was still blonde \^\^
---
Kbm on console is evil. Truly diabolical
---
alright thanks. Must just be ubisoft at it again.
---
2018*
---
Teammates
---
They still have the upper hand
---
keeping sucking , kid
---
And if you saw me play Glaz you'd tear your eyes out.
---
Welcome to rainbow six....
---
Some advice from an old fart... 
---
Dont worry about going pro and just play to have fun. Your chances of being paid by a sponsor is very slim. If somehow it happens cool more power to you but  focus on your school and a good job. A good career will take you much further then trying and possibly failing or somehow actually being sponsored only to burnout. A progamer is not by any means a life long position. Your popularity will fade eventually and so will the games you play.
---
Not trying to soubd like a Bad News Benny but just being honest.
---
Because aiming with a pistol on console is difficult
---
You're deluding yourself if you think there aren't leavers in ranked
---
The non sequitur.
---
Not thicc enough
---
Heat and vision aren’t bad at all. Stairs are difficult though. Not soo sure on legality all I know is armour isn’t terribly restricted in the U.K.
---
Yes my Disciple
---
Ash: “Wow that alibi has a sight, muzzle, grip, and is looking down... I bet it’s just a hologram.”
---
Team kill alot
---
That’s some real bullshit. Imagine just playing rainbow with your friends and some guy is cheating and you’re playing like normal then out of no where you get super boosted and banned.
---
Chanka need LMG... need it to go "CHUNKA-CHUNKA-CHANKA-CHANKA-CHUNKA!"
---
You don't need to aim with Blitz though
---
upDOOT
---
Just breathe. Its only a game.
---
Haha sad UK times, yeah I’ll have to get fabricating haha.
---
This is sick, but these kids are meat
---
The same move of Mira in Mira's Trailer.
---
This play in specific, in ranked, sure you’re right. But this had nothing to do with casual or ranked or how stupid the kapkan was, it was ultimately about finding a good spot for your drone during prep (or in general) and the cheeky kill was just an example as to how it could possibly pay off so I mean it seems you focused on pretty much everything but the main point of the video just to bring down the value of the post by brushing it off as “casual + kapkan stupid = thats why you got the kill.” 
---
I didn’t mean to come off nasty in any way tho, just pointing out how your comment came off to me. If i looked to far into it I apologize.
---
Because even if he doesnt hit the shots and takes a little damage he just stims and is right as rain.
---
I've had something dumb like that before. I queued with my boys, and after a few minutes it kicked me to the lobby. Rejoined the party and it said I was in a match. Joined the match and I joined into a 4v5 in the second or third round. Commenced Jackie Chan meme gestures.
---
Doesn’t exist lad.
---
Oml yea
---
Jackal is very balanced. He eliminates punishes solo roamers which is his job. He’s extremely easy to kill. Just roam in a pair of two, and when one gets tracked bait them and when the jackal pushes kill him from another angle.
---
It also depends on your server. Any US server should have plenty of comms because everyone speaks the same language. EU and Asia have dozens of languages and not everyone is 100% proficient in English.
---
It's not even specific to R6, mic comms are way less common in EU in all competitive games.
---
Its worth it to them apparently
---
No, not at all. Nor have I seen streamers having this issue. I get tired of these posts every 6 months or so.
---
#Wheres the vodka?
---
Restart game,
---
Wait an hour or 2
---
If that doesn’t help, contact support.
---
Beat of luck finding one, I have looked around myself but with no luck so far. Awesome cosplay though!
---
Battle eye doesn’t really work in the first place. Secondly there was a sale on the game a little while ago so hackers pick up a bunch of accounts, destroy people who aren’t as skilled then hack to beat people better than them. It’s a cycle, just record them and open an ubi case, easier way to see results. If everyone did that hackers would make it past a day of cheats
---
echo is banned because he can prevent a bomb defusing
---
I was wondering about that as well
---
I think it should concuss but not stop plants. Unrealistic but more balanced. Or it should be bigger with a light on it, easier to find and shoot.
---
Cool down, I wasn't bullying you. 
---
The smiley face was only because I thought it was peculliar for someone that doesn't play the game since the last summer still frequents a subreddit about the game. But I didn't meant to hurt your feelings with that comment.
---
All I meant to say is that your complaint is about something that you experienced almost a year ago and that now is different and for the better. The "try again" was a literal "try the game again" with this new feature and see if you'll have a better experience now. Not whatever you thought it was.
---
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night.
---
I dont think you need to nerf Echo.... People just need to start playing Thatcher and IQ more. Maybe even buff IQ. Having her nades back would be nice.
---
Because all those characters played by skilled player (against low skilled players) can win solo.
---
I mained Glaz, but he is terrible now.
---
I ban echo because he’s annoying to go against while trying to plant
---
and your input sucks, so he messed up the camouflage, other than a fucking walkie talkie he didnt miss much at all. The fact that this is on the top of the subreddit disproves that his cosplay sucks, and who are you to say that we dont know what's in the pouches, you arent a spokesperson for the community there are ways to infer. So give criticism over genuine problems than a radio and the decals on the suit. Not to mention the fact that he has a green uniform.
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Ideally yeah, but you can’t really coordinate that all the time for solo players. I get that you can always bait him but it’s still incredibly annoying being tracked over and over again
---
If they cancelled games, people would abuse it to avoid losses by using smurfs to take the hit and save everyone else’s elo.
---
As a Jackal, Lesion and Echo main, this season has been really rough.
---
cuz he is aiming 1 mile away from me and domes me
---
Haha thanks for the info, now time to get defensive, The Gorka is in the Gold Leaf pattern, the flat portions are currently green but will be tan through several washes and use. The radio is absent as it is on charge and was getting in the way.
---
If you are referring to the DP-28 pouches and ones attached to the shoulder straps we most assuredly do know, you just aren’t knowledgeable enough to recognise that they are Russian DP-28 Pan Magazine pouches each housing 3 Magazines. The shoulder mounted ones are for Individual first aid use, containing a wound dressing and tourniquet each. I don’t have the latter as of yet so a simulation dead rag will suffice. Your feedback while appreciated, Sucks. Got any useful or relevant information?
---
2019 and people still record shit like it's 1945
---
Banning Jager is so fun.
---
Just play IQ more. Echo problem solved.
---
Oof on my part
---
This new update is rough seeing as I play Echo and Jackel.   It really is just the most annoying ops to play against that get panned
---
Straight up agree, Echo is so easy to counter but everyone complains and bans him because they don't want to put the effort in.
---
Really?
---
Lesion*
---
I think ban phase (specifically Mira) shook it up slightly but yes was stale
---
As a thermite main I can say there is very few situations to use ur exo charge on something unreinforced and this is not one of them
---
Does any one know where I can buy a rainbow six siege operator costume? Pls help
---
Its like in grand theft auto where you can walk around with a chainsaw, taser, and molotov’s, and cops are ok. But when you pull out a pistol they bring in the swat team on you
---
Echo is banned because the pros ban him
---
What about blitz
---
A vertical screen recording of the bottom right half of a monitor?
---
If you started shooting early you couldve killed at least 4 or maybe five! Funny clip tho
---
Listen, to all the people bashing on Lesion, Blitz and Echo. Stop, not funny they are good ops, you're just bad at them &gt;:(
---
I see rainbow is Competitive in all aspects,i like that
---
I'm shocked Thatcher isn't banned more. At least if they have to take an IQ or Mute, they have to work harder to destroy your gadgets.
---
Thanks for the actual understanding my friend, rather than a knee jerk response to a shallow comment being called out like our friend here!
---
Lol true
---
ez jackal counter. you remember where you were, and you go back to that location and kill him and maybe someone else
---
I banned him because the whole enemy team is capable of pin a position an you cannot get a chance tonsee the thing
---
So can kapkan..
---
That dead cam switch to watch bandit fly lmao
---
You’re moms curtains!
---
Agreed. The overtime scenario really causes issues with this new format. It either has to be first to 4 and 2-2-1-1-1 or first to 5 and keep it 3-3-1-1-1.
---
I see a nice comment, I Upvote you! Many thanks!
---
Yea lol I dmed you a pic of the cheapest
---
Did you get banned for it? I have never heard of being banned because you've been kicked so many times. That would be massively fckd up. All the higher level players or squads ganging up on the new player/solo queued players, they would get bans too.
---
Drank
---
I’d also like to see what that barricade is made of...
---
True but we were all messing around and didn't care that much
---
Well yea, but you're complaining about Jackals 5 pings being to many...go kill him then instead of running away like most people.
---

I don't think the idea was to remove team killing but decrease it
---
I’m glad this happened it’s so annoying being in gold and getting that 15 year old that thinks he’s a god at the game that goes recruit with bandits gun.
---
Yes I play ps4 on a monitor it’s smaller and easier
---
No sweat, great job. Update the sub whenever you add more!
---
Nope.
---
What's to discuss? 
---
Blitz isn't Op he's just annoying, but he can be dealt with pretty easily. 
---
Jackal is in the same boat for the most part, roamers/peekers just don't like being countered.
---
Echo just has great information potential, and the ability to deny plants, his guns aren't bad. Again, just annoying in the right hands, but not broken. 
---
Cav... she's the spooky bitch, most of the community has nightmares (and wet dreams) about her, she's the most effective roamer atm, but staying in pairs, and droning out makes her fairly useless.
---
shut up
---
That’s not the point
---
Yeah I’ll meme some more and maybe Throw the Jäger one on here too.
---
I know that feeling
---
THANOS NOKK.
---
Can some one explain this to me, i am unable to play for the next three months and I haven’t played the past two weeks so please grant me mercy
---
I know his Alda is objectively better than the Mp5SD but man I miss using the mp5 when I'm playing maestro.
---
This is so cool
---
Right ;)
---
No one wants the invisible shit ubisoft.
---
“Dude the iron sights are better anyways”
---
dang thats an old clip
---
They are
---
I think so
---
zach
---
Ban monty instead of blitz. Extended monty is so frustrating.
---
lol yeah I forgot I had it in my collection, and felt like uploading it :P
---
U polish?
---
Trigger discipline? Jk great costume keep it up.
---
It’s a camo net that is used by the so called “frogmen” aka danish special ops.
---
That’s very confusing considering that the speed/armor use the same visual but more equals more not more equals less
---
Ohh, gotcha
---
It really did not holy fuck
---
Yep
---
Haha yeah I’ve had like 15 trigger discipline comments. Yeah trying to tell people it was for the video leads to salty remarks. But thanks for the nice comment man!
---
Ever since the update, I dont think ive played a single ranked match yet where Blitz wasnt banned (console btw).

This needs to be what it looks like in game
---
That’s exactly what he means. A friend you queue up with is cheating and thus “boosting” you.
---
Yeah but it doesn’t always work out that way. When you’re solo queuing it’s hard to just roam back and kill him with four other players walking around
---
hookers &amp; cocaine
---
Nyet ingame Lord it perfect
---
I miss echo in ranked 😭
---
Not at all because she's awful?
---
I watched King George get like 8 games with hackers last night alone
---
Awesome! Take it easy friend, and happy playing!
---
We all know the bans are from teams who don't want to deal with inconveniences. Yes, Blitz is a pain but I've only played a handful of them who are actually game-changers.
---
and then you get a call from Dokk

Yea My friend did a long time ago. And now I trolled in casual one day and got kicked like ten times and am worried if I am in the red
---
Yes with glorious thunder
---
Took me a few rounds to understand you have to be standing still now lol
---
Did you really repost a SauSiege comic from today?
---
W t f
---
Yeah please, promleague is different because more extended rounds
---
tbh IQ is kinda garbo, her 552 is pretty good but her gadget is really kinda useless except for dealing with echo, which seems okay at first but you have to remember you’re prolly dropping Ash for IQ if you decide to play her in ranked, it might be a bit better if she had frags but that’s not true anymore
---
Absolutely legendary match
---
oh yeah
---
Thanks for confirming
---
Echo gets banned every game because he's annoying to play against
---
But I won’t get kicked for the same reason anymore since I’m banned from mic
---
I'm more down for fixing moving because the sway is fucking annoying and if it were more like ella and zophia it would be better.
---
Ah, then you know how annoying he is to play against lol
---
Dude don't do this plagiarism from the god him( Sau-Siege
---
Ikr
---
No worries
---
when you're being sneaky and see a drone so you freak out
---
I mean echo has a better gadget and his gun is a laser beam BUT that 80 round mag at 900 rpm... ooooh the prefires
---
People say the same crap about favela but with favela we actually have concrete reasons why it's less enjoyable. With Hereford, people just bitch and whine and never give any reasons why they don't enjoy the map. There's nothing wrong with new Hereford. Just learn the new map.
---
Just to answer your question on the MP5 vs. P90 a bit more, it really depends. The P90 is a headshotting BEAST if you get to know the recoil, which is VERY vertical VERY fast. The way you play P90 is short bursts, hoping for headshots, or dominating the enemy with your (most likely) superior ammo capacity and just hoping to whatever deity might be listening that you hit their head before they hit yours. I suggest using a Holo with this strategy, as it helps with the recoil while allowing you to see whats going on. The MP5 is a whole different strategy, you should hold angles attackers would never think to cover, hold popular pushing points from a ways off with your ACOG while slowly crawling (crouch + slow walk) to avoid making noise and creeping up behind them.
---
I personally use the P90 on doc and MP5 on rook, spraying and praying on doc and healing if I didnt pray hard enough, or doing it sneaky beaky like with Rook.
---
I can only tap fire the Alda. The second I try to sustain fire I can't control the recoil
---
https://youtu.be/1agK3W2zxJA
---
I feel like varsity does a good job explaining why it's not a big deal 
---
We get to use unlocked skins (elite, legendary, black ice, etc)  on existing guns 
---
An op won't have an OP weapon at launch (ela smg, Nomad/Kaid pistol, etc) 
---
Ubisoft could just swap out their weapons if they're too strong/weak 
---
Siege already has alot of weapons
---
Not even close, really
---
Im sorry I didnt realize aim assist didnt carry over to ranked. I stand corrected.
---
I think goofy shit happens more because console has a much lower barrier to entry, so you get way more people who don't know how to play an FPS (see that cursed Blackbeard clip from a bit earlier.)
---
Eh. I main him, so i know what It takes to stop him. Hes no more annoying than any operator. It depends on the player.
---
Where’s the thatch man?
---
do you have the image but without the cha Cha real smooth?
---
just go look at her concept art with mira. it’s not a clear picture of her face but you can still see a lot of it
---
That's normal for him. He plays some 40 games in a session and is always getting queue sniped.
---
Aren't base ops unlocked for everyone?
---
Alright. I'm certainly up for roaming. Anything but camping.

Buy uniforms, gotta look good while killing
---
2 days ago i was in a 1v1 with maestro and i was prefiring, after 40 rounds i stopped and he then decided to peek and i forgot how to control recpil and i had 2 bullet in his chest and 15 above his head
---
Nøkk is too quiet to be Clash tho
---
This is by far the best advice I've ever received in my life.
---
Echo ban is the only good strategic ban if you're attacking first. All the rest people ban them because they don't want to face them. There's plenty of better characters to ban, but people ban the same characters because "they are annoying". Trash reason and won't help them get the win.
---
I don’t think you know how good of a gun the ak12 is
---
Repost from the same day...
---
Clash yells for no reason
---
I couldn't squeeze them all in. Too many ops..
---
Same. I used to rock the holo with maestro and had better luck. It's just a shame giving up the ACOG use
---
But he can only do it once
---
Ubi better keep that character model
---
#YOU FUCKING MUPPET

After some loadout problems i posted a edited version here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c1s564/here\_is\_the\_new\_version\_of\_my\_operator\_idea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c1s564/here_is_the_new_version_of_my_operator_idea/) 
---
Thanks for the nice feedback!
---
He gets 5 of them.
---
It was ranked.. And not this post I'm talking about my experience
---
so is Ash, your point? M870 is powerful and I can have smokes and a grenade as a 3 speed recruit so I'd say I'm more useful than your average Ash.
---
Ugh PlayStation
---
I was thinking she’d get 5 too
---
For sure. It also seems to be more effective at range than most of the other shottys
---
wow
---
But this is classed as witch hunting I'm pretty sure.
---
Only happened once and once I put all my settings to how I had them, I've not had it again. Also, none of my ops disappeared iirc
---
RFF would only kill you, not the teammate, so it’s just one person being punished. Except this time it would be the person who shot getting killed rather than the teammate who ran in front. It’s not perfect but I’ll take it over the numerous advantages trolls have without RFF on from the start.
---
Idk what to tell you then
---
Its not an exploit lmao that mirror doesnt have a hitbox
---
I agree, pick and ban is meant for pro league players but Ubisoft caters to them and ignores the majority of the people that play the game.
---
What elo are you in that you think any of these maps are even remotely playable?
---
For now...
---
That's not being toxic that's using your operator ability, if you kill with anyone else's however, it is toxic
---
Been saying it from the first announcement... Stupid bans are the norm.

I mean Echo is extremely OP in my opinion. Ever since he got his second drone he was OP. You get disoriented for such a long fucking time and you also have to stay still for it go away faster. Plus he has two drones. Plus they're nearly invisible.
---
Make their effect similar to Ela's and we've got a much more balanced operator. Right now I'm fine with him getting banned in 100% of matches.
---
Should have clicked on his head *tut tut tut*
---
~550 hours here, and I've still got no idea what Macie does half the time.
---
When I found new hereford in ranked, I hated it. I was terrible at it. I kept getting my ass handed to me.
---
So I praticed. I watched videos. I played custom games with my friends. I ground out hours of t-hunt on it. I practiced ESL strats on it; the works.
---
Now? I hate it even more.
---
In your opinion?
---
Thanks! I'm'a have to Nøkk if you don't mind!
---
If I had 1$ for every time I died due to this I would actually have 5$
---
Right. Got it. I’ll play with all my friends that switched back to Fortnite....
---
No one exists that is the best at all. Do you want an anchor, roamer, utility char?
---
The point of him was that your friend was cheating without you knowing and you kept on queueing with him without knowing you’re getting boosted by cheater.
---
Nah, I'm agreeing with you. People refuse to accept any advice you give them on this subreddit. I tried to tell some guy how to counter hard breachers earlier (play fucking bandit/mute) and he kept telling me "they aren't fun to play" like some troglodyte.

I've never seen a post as a reply to another post. Also, this is better than the Warden one :)
---
the starting unranked elo caps at 3500.
---
and a game of about 800-900 average elo difference isnt even at all, especially in high ranks
---
Yes. So that way if you get into say Gold 1 and then play 500 matches you’ll only get a few MMR points and won’t move up or down. They call it the “certainty” factor or something. It keeps you where the system thinks you belong.

Yeah one guy who I have played with was named notasmurf but he’s a good guy who only does it for placement and not dicking over noobs
---
I almost feel bad for that annoying s.o.b. almost...
---
No, I played siege for a year without ps plus
---
It's a huge brick with zero entrance points and extremely large rooms. It's all 90 degree angles and roaming is incredibly overpowered. ACOGs dominate defense, and top floor is impossible to take on attack. 
---
There's little good vertical gameplay since roamers take everyone out, and the map is a giant vertical cube anyway.
---
Aesthetically the map is horrendously ugly and poor to play on. It's literally just themepark, but even less nice to look at.
---
Overall it's a generous 3/10 in map design.
---
Mostly everyone is brain dead. Not just in rainbow 6. A lot of popular games filled with kids that secretly are on their brothers Conputer/console
---
It worked for me
---
Played a few games last night where only 1 person was picking our ban and would always pick Blackbeard. Then everyone would come back from being afk I'm guessing and be like, "really?! We banned Blackbeard?! UGH."
---
Does it work on enemy operators
---
Okay but officially that shouldn't be possible 🤔
---
I smurf occasionally because casual matchmaking is terrible. I don't even understand why Cas is "skill based" anyways
---
I think because he's a nightmare when your droning and you can't push him properly because you have an general area were he could be when his gadget is on but you can't be sure where exactly.
---
I’ve done the same thing
---
A utility char
---
massive
---
Where does is say he's referring to siege?
---
You need to learn how to play vertically and how to 2-3 split
---
This is exactly why bans are moronic. If you'd play the game competently, you'd either have killed Echo, his drones, or planted despite them. Instead you bitching that you couldn't deal with the Echo player playing normally.
---
I actually like both these ideas. I've been burned a few times on the 3 and switch. They other team will run up a 3-0 then we will win 2 and then have one unlucky round that gives them the win. This primarily happens when I start on attack on maps that seem like it is easier to defend than attack.
---
Just gotta get over the mouse and keyboard switch. You will never go back to that caveman controller again. That’s the biggest difference.
---
I really dont understand at all. Now to preface Im not exactly amazing at the game or anything but its literally just a shotgun attachment isn't it?
---
Normal games they would have gone up against at least high plays, the problem was that 3 of you where unranked and your both 5 stacks, so the game had to put you together even without the best balance, for times sake, many games do this with larger parties.
---
Source, too many damn hours of boosting, being boosted, smurfing, and fucking around.
---
Thank God someone else is getting it. My internet is awesome and I'll play 10-15 games between 9-15 ping then BOOM 120-200 ping for 4 games straight same eus server
---
If I hear someone about the come round a corner I’ll switch but I just use it for soft wall and floor destruction usually.
---
echo, maestro is great with a great gun, lesion is always a good pick
---
That’s BS though.... because I’m gaining 30 MMR when I’m winning but losing upto 70 when I’m losing
---
She was beautiful, now she is normal.
---
I could never have the patience or the skill to draw this, and tbh this is one of the best drawings i’ve seen, you should try and be a concept artist with that skill.
---
l
---
When I’m murdering a wall and a guy come out of nowhere I’ll shoot at him with it. It sometimes works
---
I just think it’s way to easy to get tracked right now. Your footprints stay visible for too long. If it were harder to scan people then I wouldn’t have an issue with it. You barely have to put yourself at risk as Jackal to get a scan
---
No its chainmail duh
---
Hate him as in playing against him or they hate the idea of playing as him?
---
And AMD?
---
*stares intensely at doc while fully extended outside of obj window*
---
She isn’t the worst operator in the game. Fine in the higher ranks she is going to be much less useful, since again, she brings nothing to the team other than interrogations. This does not make her a better pick than someone like clash, or tachanka. In casual, and the lower ranks she can be extremely helpful. I’m not an amazing player, being gold 3 to silver 1, and I see lots of people dropping 3ks. Just because you don’t like to play her or just find her ability to be bad doesn’t mean she is a terrible operator. And even if her ability doesn’t directly help the team, her getting kills does.
---
G8 Gang!!!!
---
I would love to get that skin.
---
Someone literally teleported to me and my teamates.
---
Well its not a glitch
---
They can only DDOS an individual person if you join their party. Biggest issue is them DDOSing the match. Are they one round away from losing? DDOS. It makes the match non existant pretty much. No points given to anyone and we get a surrender sanction.
---
Very, VERY nice
---
Oh, good timing I suppose!
---
From what I've seen and heard over the past 4 years, yes.
---
Also, RIP Secure
---
Thanks bro
---
Just got it last week. And I honest to god havent played with the spaz 12 since year 1. Playing with the buffed dwagle/spaz loadout on Vlak has been incredibly fun and actuall pretty viable.
---
Ur comment, "Ah shiit, here we go again".
---
Nah gridlock is cool.
---
Just don’t talk constantly like some young kids do (I don’t want to hear about that sweet skin you got while I’m trying to 1v2), and most people won’t have a problem with you, some asshats might give you crap, but just mute them.
---

Iq lmg &gt; Aug and 522
---
Emerald gemstone, only absolute chads have it.
---
No biased or anything.
---
Why didn’t you just link the video the article is about?
---
But killing IQ doesn’t completely eliminate your ability to destroy that echo drone. Whereas if Dokkaebi dies, and lets be honest, against a cav in CQC or mid range combat, she will die, your ability to track her down without other counter ops is decreased. My opinion is that why spend resources trying to track down an operator that has silent step, when you can just use ops that can focus on taking the objective.
---
Banning cav just makes it so much easier to clear out roamers, and you can do so without anti-roam operators. 
---
and also curious, what rank do you play against
---

Reminder that сука is actually censored in siege, also it's actually блядь aka blyadʹ.
---
its to balance her out but yeah its weird.
---
Yes it is.
---
If they ever did it would be a farce. Controller cant compare to the speed and accuracy of M&amp;K.
---
But Ash actually gets kills.
---
Stupid question I know, but how do you mute specific people on PS4?

I prefer OP's version.

That little delay between impact and explosion is the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my entire life!

Did you know that 86.5% of statistics are made up on the spot?
---
Please. Non esl maps have no place in ranked.
---
Lesion is so easy to play lol 
---
if he’s familiar with FPS he’ll pick up lesion in two minutes
---
I think they mean this post should be on the hot feed, instead of the new feed.
---
Same here bro I gotchu
---
This guy doesn’t speak for all of us thanks
---
for those who never saw it it might as well be , lol, but for all the others:
---
/sarcasm
---
Same here in my group I'm probably the best mira and I rarely play her so for us it's just easier to ban her on maps she's good on and we feel like we actually have more of a chance than we did before pick and ban came.
---
So? they won all three of theirs.
---
She is hands down the worst operator in the game. Clash is useful because she provides a lot of intel and can solo prevent an entire push.  Chanka is even more useful, he can hold down one site by himself and his loadout isn’t bad. Cav is absolute dog shit. If you can get a 3k with cavs shit gun, then you can easily do it with someone like vigil or bandit or alibi. You say her getting kills helps the team, but there are SO many better operators if you want to roam and frag. In a coordinated push she’s going to get live pinged 24/7 and then pushed from two angles and beaned. Vigil is useful there because he can’t get live pinged during a push. Her ability is absolutely useful. I have never been silver, I’m speaking from competitive and high ranked experience, she has a 0% pro league pick rate and decision about the game should be based off the people who play it right, ie the top tier players. So yes she’s absolute shit.
---
Oh. I get the joke
---
Ah cheers
---
I’ll be on in like 20 or so.   Taking a mondo duke

When I got my rainbow six siege on Xbox my code didn't work
---
Not anymore. Was only the case for the last year, but with the reduced pricing model for DLC ops, they reverted to the original unlocks for the base ops.
---
There needs to be a better punishment for leaving can't tell you how many games I've lost because of that.
---
Lesion mines dont just be thrown willy nilly, placed at every door way. You use them to your advantage to catch out players on your flank. To pin the defuser if it has been dropped, they need to be placed in a way that benefits the entire team and not just for the sake of throwing them down. As i said above, there are players out there whom already use him religiously.. being aware of how to play the game before using him is key for the first couple of dozen games.
---
Well I am Mira main and couldnt play her for past 8 rankeds. Very cool Ubi.

yes it is mate , not intending to fool anyone here , flair checks out.
---
still it should be a pretty accurate representation of what quarantine will be for those who never saw this.
---
I'm soaking more to the fact that PC aim is much cleaner and this video shows only slightly below average aim for console
---
If it makes you feel any better, Ubi just removed half (21 this season, 20 in year 3) of all existing legendaries currently in alpha packs this latest season update.

This chart is very accurate and I believe it's data, unless someone shows me proof of them getting a legendary that contradicts it.
---
What do you guys think of the waffle cone skin personally one of my favs rn!!!
---
How-
---
How did you get out? It's not possible.
---
Thats a few good ones! I used to play as Glaz a lot so thats a pretty major nerf for him. With electric hatches that probably makes Thatcher a lot more popular. Gutted Ash lost the Acog! I loved Ash!
---
No people hit ubi servers when they're on defense so the attackers cant move, then it clears up on defense.
---
Ok, wasn't aware of that, thanks for the info
---
I heard a game reset usually works. If not, im not sure buddy.
---
Thats the main issue a lot of players have. Communication and team play will take you way further that you could wvee get on your own.
---
Amazing how many people see "Girlfriend, pee pee, right now."
---
Your welcome.
---
How do you get the bottom skin
---
No, you’re probably straight ass on console. I mean, if you were any good, why would you have to use keyboard and mouse? Without cheating you’re probably just a low rank shitter. Play the game fair, loser.
---
What surface is your mouse on there?
---
When I'm playing manhunt and ask someone if they're it.

Epic
---
Silver 2 three seasons in a row now.....
---
yeah MP7 recruit with wire and C4 is as good as ela or vigil honestly, especially now that they buffed the MP7 and Nomad's ARX iron sights.
---
You got ddosed
---
That must be the new blind operator
---
the origin has nothing to do with it
---
Mate I'm 1w and 4L and I was gold 2 last season
---
As a UK player it’s almost fruitless to solo queue as most people on the EU servers seem to be french or Spanish etc. I haven’t even bothered to enter voice chat if the people in it are foreign.
---
He just said microsoft cant you read?
---
Ubisoft has explicitly said that keyboard and mouse on console is cheating...just because it doesn’t break the console TOS, doesn’t mean it can’t be considered cheating.
---
Totally agree. Cav loses her advantage against someone who drones well, and Gridlock is amazing. I was skeptical of her when she was announced, like “oh she sounds kinda awful.” Couldn’t have been more wrong, her gadget is so versatile
---
Their whole team should be banned
---
Tachanka lowkey bigger than the rest 👀 as it should be
---
Pretty much what I do as well except I’ll generally keep my mic on and make some call outs.  You know...  in the hopes that someone else will do the same and also not be a dick.
---
It's saved a fair few plants for me, nobody seems to use the spot so nobody bothers to check it or prefire it.
---
Same here, doing the best to help the team yet they keep dying in less than 1min after the round starts
---
My trio reported them all and I can only hope the two we paired up with did too
---
I’m having it too, as is every friend I’ve asked about it. Think everyone is affected by it. From what we experienced you get the packs the next time you load up the game
---
I thought Cav countered Jackal? The only problem with situational operators is that it is likely that situation just doesn't ever arrive. Warden has been out for a week and I've seen his gadget being effective maybe once or twice, despite him being played virtually every single game. In Fighting games situational characters (counter picks) work because you know who your opponent is going to play and therefore the match-up and their general gameplan, in Siege you don't know nuthin. 
---
With there being an unlimited amount of variables when it comes to team comp and objective, there's almost never a reason to pick a situational operator unless you're absolutely certain you can hard read what the enemy is going to do. But even if your foresight is correct and the enemy runs a team of all flashbangs and smokes, Warden is still worthless because he's going to be outgunned. As you die you're going to think to yourself that it would've been nice to run Doc with that MP5 and 140 hp.
---
Like it  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You should ask it
---
Why do characters get banned?
---
Overrated: cav  underrated: echo
---
Every other game is like this now lol, even in Plat 3 you’ll get people stressing the servers
---
What skin is on the gun?
---
I was plat this season but some server stresses and keyboard and mouse cheaters kicked me out of it
---
I fear no man, but that thing, it scares me.
---
They added new achievements and you may not have achieved them yet, or they might just be slow to update.
---
Can I kill someone by shooting them in the face with his launcher?
---
I've been silver for 10 seasons in a row. At least I'm consistent.
---
Deserved ban every time still don’t know why ubi thought adding him was a good idea .. look at my reddit username lmao
---
I see! Thanks for the info dude!

On my next T-Hunt on Villa, same location, Vigil and Ela snapped at each other almost like they remembered this;

Vigil: "Try not to die this time."

Ela: "Don't push me."

I don't have 1000 hours but same happened to me
