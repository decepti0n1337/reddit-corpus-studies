Now that he’s been nerfed in to the ground (and will be again in the future probably) I’d like to see the V.308 get a buff. It’s very lacklustre at the minute. An assault Vector with a slow fire rate?

---
I didn't give a percentile, not sure why you're harping on that point.
---
But yeah, dude, it is definitely different. 
---
Top floor is basically a giant room with two small rooms inside of it, can't really be accessed from inside at all in the same way as the old Hereford, and definitely not from the outside in the same way as the old Hereford.
---
The second floor has a completely redesigned feel - instead of the *one* stairwell leadin gup into a central hub that splits into three rooms, you have two stair wells that lead up to S-tetromino type hallway that intersects between both stairwells and *four* rooms, all of which can be accessed outside [with two of them being accessed from multiple window points]
---
The first floor is probably the closest to the original, with the difference being that the garage is bigger, the hallways are longer, and there is more *shit* that hangs from the ceilings and takes up space in the respective rooms, making the overall look to be busier, providing more cover
---
And the basement just isn't even remotely the same, if you think so you're just blind, dog.
---
normally inaccuracies don't bother me, but this was pretty glaring even if you didn't know anything about guns. glad to see it got changed.

Unpopular opinion: Caveira was unbearable before work her silent step essentially removing one of your 5 most basic senses and with a silent 2 hit kill pistol at medium range made her into a super valuable fragging operator in ranked. This change puts her in her proper position of being a high risk/high reward operator who can't just get free death marks on people.
---
Spray at her head and it will hit or you can take cover and peek her...
---
Pfffff... Check out Cold Sky (Jager) and Grim Tally (Mira).

Just introduce a game mode just with operators up to Y3 and I don't care what horseshit will the next operator be

I would say Ying she is great for getting a defuse down and has decent guns
---
Talk about fixing what aint broke 
---
I can understand that it's daunting to try to learn all at once but that's what keeps the game new and exciting.  There is certainly an argument that could be made about map balance but I don't think the total map count should be lowered just for the sake of "too many."  I wouldn't hate to see a vote for map option but that unfortunately turns into people only wanting to ever play 1 or 2 maps.
---
Is the rework just a shorter initiation and lasting period?
---
Why would anyone develop an air gun that fires syringes?
---
Flicking is muscle memory. That’s probably what he meant by
---
Yeah this happened to me with the gingerbread skin and I put it on all guns thinking I actually owned it and I restarted the game and it fucked me over with no skin on all 40 operators 
---
That's always been the case
---
Its not an AR, it doesn't shoot NATO standardized ammonition for rifles and is therefore a carbine
---
I might as well explain this here
---
If it shoots a rifle caliber and has a barrel longer than 20 inches, it's a rifle.
---
If it shoots a rifle caliber and has a barrel shorter than 20 inches, it's a carbine.
---
If it shoots a pistol caliber and is not a handgun, than it's an smg.
---
If you convert an smg with a barrel under 20 inches to a rifle caliber, it's now considered a carbine. Not a rifle.
---
Rifles can be switched to 9mm but they're then considered carbines, I don't know why. They just are

Good lord this woman is 225 lbs at 5'9"?! Absolute unit.

Ho ho ho goodddd... Glaz. Buddy. It's never the way. People love you, don't give up.
---
I agree that he needs a nerf, but I honestly think the biggest issue is the shield not being synced up with where it a appears to be. If that worked completely perfectly, than yes you could probably just shoot his shoulder/feet/hand
---

So glad when I got mine but got kinda disappointed they don't look different. Or at the very least make Diamond more unique, maybe somewhat translucent? It looks way similar to Silver with just subtle differences. 
---
25 hours watch time out of &lt;26 hours total stream time is quite hard tbh, even if you just idle since there can be Twitch broadcast/network errors and stuff (happened to me once, glad I caught it immediately).

The only time this is really made for is when cab goes into silent step in 90 on villa behind table. That was the soul purpose for that whole fix. I’m sure there are other places to be used like that but that’s what it will fix predominantly.  
---
What did you expect???
---
Removing it by pulling it down has always returned it to Castle
---
could you please do a old and new for every operator, thx!
---
Yes take away a huge benefit of castle, great plan. Not like you can shoot attackers trying to break it from the gap anyway smh

Guess what still dont have em

That'd be nuts

Contact Ubisoft then. I got mine 7-8 hours ago.

You know what the consequence of dying as an op are? You fucking die. That's your punishment. No need for this stupid, "you messed up and now you can't play to your strengths for the rest of the game" bullshit

They are the exact same guns. Capitao’s has 100 bullets and reloads slower, Gridlock’s has a 60 round magazine and reloads faster. Now that there’s two M249s, they gave them both the scope made specifically for the M249 IRL and gave it the same zoom as ACOG. It just looks different. They both have the same recoil pattern and 650 RPM and 48 damage per shot

**Mecanum wheel**
---
The Mecanum wheel is a design for a wheel which can move a vehicle in any direction. It is sometimes called the Ilon wheel after its inventor, Bengt Erland Ilon, who came up with the idea when he was an engineer with the Swedish company Mecanum AB. The US-Patent was filed on the 13 November 1972.It is a conventional wheel with a series of rollers attached to its circumference. These rollers typically each have an axis of rotation at 45° to the plane of the wheel and at 45° to a line through the centre of the roller parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel. A typical configuration is the four-wheeled one of the URANUS omni-directional mobile robot (pictured) or a wheel chair with Mecanum wheels (similar to that pictured).

Overpowered was Ela when she first came out.
---
Blitz is very strong in certain situations, but not overpowered. Ubisoft have not said anything in regards to him being “overpowered” 
---
If you’d be so kind as to list the “plenty of pros” who think he’s overpowered too.
---
It’s only like that now for advertising the new season to other countries. It won’t be that way in the main game. 
---
Dont think so, no.
---
What have you done in that house man?
---
Man that is epic
---
Every time I go to outbreak steakhouse, I see this kind of woman every time lol.
---
Besides blitz and lion the ones up there are mostly banned for certain maps/tactics I believe. No ones banning thermite because he’s universally overpowered. 
---
yah, then you want to smash it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How the **FUCK** do people lack this much situational awareness Jesus Christ
---
gg ez
---
Yeah im aware but with proper placement and use of utility, especially if there is a jager it is a lot less likely for his gadget to be destroyed. Its all about placement ;)
---
Imagine being on the other side of that and not knowing wtf was going on.
---
Flash cool down is cool and all, but it's pretty much meaningless, unless they massively increase the time needed for it
---
The ads is a good feature as well, but most blitses just rush in, blind and melee
---
The stats show she's bad at higher ranks, but I think she's probably annoying for people in lower ranks.  I've seen a lot of bad players lose all sense once they're zapped by a Clash.  Like, they respond to a zap by running out of cover to try and knife her.. right into the objective where someone is holding an angle (since Clash's usually call out).

That is amazing

Is that why Monty was in the Top 5 most banned attackers at the Invitationals this season? Because he has lots of good counters? No.
---
And if lands directly at their feet, but they look at it they take the damage because of the explosive resistance.

Thank fuck one less toxic Ubisoft employee on Siege.

it looks like no one in the pros plays him if im reading this right
---
I'd rather see a bright light coming through the smoke from the defenders perspective- allowing them to shoot back more effectively. Glaz losing the thermal while moving is interesting though. Let's see what happens when an attacker has to stand still to use their gadget. Lol
---
They literally downgraded the models

No
---
I cant believe blitz was banned so much in almost every game i played noone banned him
---
In all the times I played it cab was banned and so was bandit a lot. Never saw clash or lesion or echo or Mira banned.
---
based on the numbers it looks like hibana is the OP attacker not blitz

“I’m not getting any—“

Yeah don’t get me started on Ash. I’ve unlocked so many cosmetics for her yet I’ve probably got 15 minutes playtime on her. She’s so boring.

If you like shields then absolutely. I've definitely had her come in handy and my friends can use her to support me very well so there's that
---
Its a 100 round mag.
---
Maybe it’s something they wanted to test quietly on the Test Server and put into a later patch?
---
Monty is a different story though dude. He can sit in a doorway and give intel without being hurt. This is Blitz we’re talking about.
---
Blitz dies when a nitro is directly by him mate, if it’s like a 1m away from him then yeah he only takes the 33 damage.
---
20 bucks to get something early and get a camo I won’t use isn’t worth it. I have enough renown to buy all the operators so it’s just a waste of money.
---
You look to be having a good time!

I've always thought those cheap foam knee pads would make decent cosplay shoulders.  Something like these:  [https://www.amazon.com/TommyCo-Kneepads-HD220PE-Light-Kneepad/dp/B001JEOGXS](https://www.amazon.com/TommyCo-Kneepads-HD220PE-Light-Kneepad/dp/B001JEOGXS)
---
Well now that they almost always have to melee and they can’t flash as much, they’ll be a lot more predictable. You don’t have to worry about a quick ads headshot when you reposition. Honestly if you don’t panic it won’t be much of an issue

Good! I am not a fan of Blitzy Boi

And even then, not that good aerodynamically. 
---
You’re only proving that Blitz is not friendly with people who don’t communicate, and Siege is literally a game of communication. 
---
When you say it this way she sounds super out of shape lol
---
As well if knock out one part of the barricade then melee the side yellow strip, it counts as a hit. So it'll give you the vault prompt, but then it'll still take 2 more melee hits to actually break the barricade!
---
How the fuck are you not downvoted into oblivion? Every time I say blitz needs a nerf, the silvers come out in force
---
A suppressor is a silencer. Suppressor is the American neologism for it.

Agreed, Grik sky had a little effort tho

Just push her in front of people who are getting shot

This is a goldmine lol
---
look how they massacred my boy
---
It was called the "pocket sniper", and was considered better than Glaz's rifle, hence Glaz's thumbs-up.
---
I think the point is going right over your head. They’re not trying to make her Nomad 2.0
---
I'm with the rest of everyone. No problem with female operators. When you look at an Operator like Valkyrie where you can tell she is physically built, it makes sense. But I feel like the first straw for me was skinny fat weeb Dokkaebi. And now we've moved on with statistically obese Gridlock; we're now getting into pandering territory. I consider myself relatively couth when it comes to PC considerations but this is getting ridiculous. They should slim her up before release.
---
Players: Sit this one out Echo.
---
Echo: Sweet!
---
On point
---
you know what rasc0 im taking the children and going to my moms 
---

I disagree. Blitz is good against people that panic. Lion is always good.
---
*That's how you... Spell friends.*
---
Haha fuck yeah. Made her be the game version of Gwendoline Christie
---
she should've been an american op
---
You right.
---
Lmao you are being mean to girls with muscles.
---
I agree 100% they should’ve gone with the Meme and made him a hazmat suit for drugs kind of thing I don’t know something different maybe 
---
But he is cheap and doesn't reward skillfull play.
---
You could be the better player overall or make better plays, but against a Blitz who is being played by a competent blitz player thats almost always meaningless because its so easy for him to run you down, blind you and kill you. 
---
For example, we can agree Kantoraketti on top of his game has a better 1v1 fragging potential than anyone on G2, specifically Jnzki (cant remember how its spelt) who is typically a support player. But give Jnzki a Blitz and Kanto almost any other Operator and the Player who has Blitz will win most of the time, because of how easy it is for him to be very effective.
---
He ability isn't so powerful and overcentralizing that every team needs to run him at all times like Lion was, but in a 1v1 between players of similar skill level Blitz can and often will remove who plays better from the equation and just hand the kill to whoever is playing him. 
---
In the short video posted yesterday,dokkaebi looks like a European but not an Asian.

&gt; Don't get why there are so many idiots complaining about her being "obese".

because the character model is clearly morbidly obese.

---
What? I’m saying people who complain about menial things are generally part of the vast minority. What aspect of the Commando would people complain about? That’s what I’m wondering because the damage and fire rate seem perfectly in line with other defender weapons 
---
wait this sh\*t is official i thought this was just some thicc boi meme. she looks like someone who could keep up in day to day activities but not some elite special ops dude. Shes not obese but shes definitely gonna have to be a one speed, but based off of her lack of protection she looks like shes gonna be a one armor. whats her gadget gonna be that might explain this size. i dont necessarily want to blame sjw for this design completely but this is gonna be like 3rd least favorite design

She's not in it anymore.

His castles really should be able to be electrified, I mean its metal so why not. Also he should be able to castle a window while not having to break the boards behind it so people don't automatically see it when they spawn.

Did you ask why?

You mean, before Y1S1? i.e., the very first pro league finals?
---
She can’t use her ability with her primary?
---
Is the weigh with the equipement or without?
---
Lol
---
That makes sense, thanks for clearing things up
---
The changes make it harder to get kills instead of just pressing a button and having to make them stand still, run into a room while they are still and just bombard them. It’s just not fun to fight against and just really makes you think what goes through the devs heads, but now they realise their mistake and making him really different and just refreshing. I do admit it does make him weaker but makes it more fun to play against and as Lion. As for Glaz, it makes it more challenging to get kills with him, think twice before running in with Glaz because I’ve seen Beaulo play Glaz and run in and just destroy everybody. He even started maining Glaz for that exact reason. It makes it so he’s actually used as a sniper role, so using peeks and angles with him. I know you probably won’t agree because that’s just some people but I really think they are going the right way about this.
---
Nobody claimed to be SEALs.
---
If Danny Devito modeled character was added to the game people would still complain about realism. and getting killed by a tazer after being repeatedly zapped certainly isn't unrealistic.
---
Personally the increasing Sci-Fi with stuff like nanomachines does annoy me, and I wish that wasn't in the game.
---
When she gets married she picks up her partner 
---
Pretty sure R6 is very important to thegodlynoob.... It's his freaking job 
---
That's why I always keep a prismo on me when I roam.
---
Recruit 
---
That's some good shit
---
Tell me specifically what her gadget does without using the word “area denial”
---
It makes a noise
---
It damages attackers (but not really since they can easily shoot it)
---
???
---
Better than villa and fortress? 
---
Jager has full upper body armor + helmet. This woman has practically no armor. 
---
When you hear the cluster charge on your barricade
---
It's not about the pings. 
---
Jackal you can still move and play the game. Fundamentally, an operator that makes all defender have to stand still with the press of 1 button is just broken.
---
It's like BB, fundamentally in a 1 shot headshot game he is broken, because he survives headshots. 
---
She looks like he’s 300 pounds
---
Nobody...Move a Muscle
---
Who said anything about her ability. 
---
We all know bandito is the one taking of of his stim shots 
---
I’ve been using red dot with it and it’s pretty good. 
---
Hibana is actually attractive now xD
---
Wait I thought Maverick was getting a nerf to his torch to weapon swap time?
---
What about defenders?
---
TAKE MY MONEY 
---
It's comparable to the .44 Mag's scope. Really clean a d narrow, doesn't take up as much of your screen. 
---
No they are not I have a VPN, it doesn’t single anyone out it disconnects the server

---
Well you might as well remove the ability if you are trying to force her onto her primary. She’d be worse than recruit
---
That I don't know.

Sorry to those that don't like it. IQ elite was more controversial and they didn't change it. This is what we're getting

Laughs in suppressing fire
---
Just for reference, I have never played a game with these people before. 
---
No mics, so there was no talk at all prior. 
---
I believe this was because I picked Kaid, since the vote to kick come up right after I selected him. 
---
I got killed every round, and recorded every single round to show at no point did I shoot any of them or even attempt to TK back. 
---
Being black is half the cosplay
---
R6 community is retarded
---
What’s the nerf?
---
I'm pretty sure that was just windows 
---
That is absolutely insane
---
They were probably realized that players are reloading after the last kill and make this.
---
or just run forward for nothing.

Being a pudge isn't cute. t. a pudge
---
flair checks out...?
---
Only if people knows about it. Like how being near a jammer prevents you from getting tagged by Lion scan.
---
this is certified bullshit because Cav is not 99.9% banned
---
.50 Beowulf is designed to fit 10 rounds into a 30 round STANTAG, so it's great they're getting rid of the quadstack
---
So if it doesn't affect balance or gameplay why does it matter?
---
Anyone else worried about her hitbox? 😮
---
Definitely this, I do not want a black holo on my bright or white coloured skins
---
Will the new players match making still award the same amount of renown 
---
I'm a big zofia main I think she a very powerful op. Definitely get her.
---
Not free weekend just stupid people
---
Hahahahaha
---
That aim doe. 👌
---
This looks like someone tried to deepfake a male's face onto Hibana's body
---
Not a big suprise for me. His Evil Eyes are not that strong as Yokai in most of aspects. They stationery, they has full info-making capability only in Maestro hands(if he's alive), they cannot deny plant with same efficiency. And amount of Ashes, Zofias and other operators with explosive pretty high every game, so there's many counters for EE.
---
Yeah Ela and Vigil are my favorites of this series 
---
Well that’s just your ping. I’m not smartest at this but your ping and connection are different things. My ping is 9-30 and rarely goes over 30 but I still lag. It’s a weird thing. If you see the yellow and or red symbols at the top of your screen when “the hit registration is broken” then it’s your connection. 
---
wow this is so cool
---
Well his armour is bulky and doesn’t seem to be very mobile friendly.
---
Lmaooo
---
Wait, they announced details on the ying change?
---
I just know they are reworking her (dev diary), but I don't know what.
---
All of caveira's femininity just got transferred to Hibana. Cav legit looks like a dude in the new season.
---
Absolutely understandable. Blitz is the only operator against which you have no chance in 1 to 1 as long as the Blitz player is not completely stupid
---
Ew.

It’s Micheal Cera with makeup!
---
I'm not revulsed by fat people, I personally am very conscious of my weight and try to keep thin but I'm not going to police the bodies of others.
---
If you are fat it's your business not mine, I would recommend fat people to try and cut weight but it's their life so it doenst affect me.
---
However if a fat person was a police officer or a military soldier then I would have an issue, because their fat is at that point putting others at risk
---
Bruh I do not want catwoman in this game.
---
Hight: short
---
Weight: fat
---
Wait. Kaid was the heaviest?
---
You said he’s good against uncoordinated teams and pro league players are the most coordinated people smart guy 
---
agreed
---
This looks great. Have a fun party my dude.
---
ALSO, does OP have some cosplay castle gadget as well?
---
I dont think you know what bandit looks like buddy
---
&gt;Clash 23.8%
---
wtf? She's useless why was she being banned so much
---
They haven’t yet it was just the fact that they are doing it is what confuses me.
---
Probably why they changed the eyes again. 
---
Back to a slow lean :(
---
Right? Probably one of the most balanced ops in the game.
---
because getting caught by Cav is a potential team wipe and NOBODY wants to be that guy. It adds an extra layer of stress onto an already stressful game. 
---
Yes, there are more powerful ops but the chances of you running into somebody actually good with them in this random playlist is very small. 
---
Im going to call it now, Ubisoft is going to make him a homosexual character
---
Elite units like Delta and SAD (and I assume ST6, but never read that specifically) do have females attached in some way to the unit. But that’s for purposes of going undercover and posing like a couple. 
---
If things were expected to be kinetic, then I highly doubt that women are involved. Never heard of it, at least. 
---
Of course, in the Rainbow Six book there are women, Iirc. 
---
It said so in his bio, so I went looking for it on a dead mozzie (with my drone no less)
---
I'd never touch if then.
---
I hated BU and old Hereford so much. They were to imbalanced.
---
Which is why I don't play casual anymore.
---
Since when is this game grounded in reality?
---
Now it's "Special" forces instead lol 
---
nA vee sEaEl5 
---
Glad Ubi is starting to ditch the whole "Vintage/Historic Soldier's Kit" for every single one of their elites.
---
Then again, they may have just exhausted their options for Germany.
---
I'm from Australia. It's one of those well known but lesser used sayings. I can give an example for it if anyone cares for one.
---
So instead of a counter terroist sprinting towards me to kill me, it’s gonna be some biker dude?? This doesn’t fit bandits lore, voice, or personality at all...
---
I’ve been waiting. But the animation has to have crack in it
---
They paid him in drugs 
---
3 weeks from today
---
Well, she is remarkably powerful. Her flashes are inconsistent, but she is excessively powerful.
---
Could take a play from Overwatch’s book
---
Makes sense 
---
I really like Zofia but I think you should come up with more health when you withstand 
---
And then everyone clapped. And that mans name, was Albert Einstein. And they gave me $20
---
This pick and ban mode is cool but Everytime I played it was always the same operators that get banned 
---
Are banned players a PC thing?
---
That's true, I never really see yellow till I hit 60 which is pretty rare but I get what you mean, it does happen a lot with shields too
---
Women aren’t exactly known for their ability to pack on a lot of muscle...
---
Lion is my favorite.. But so many people hate him lol
---
Is that actually the new model? Looks like a badly rendered Sim
---
look up all the patch notes for seasons 3 and 4 you’ll see most of it 
---
\[Lesion be like\]([https://i.imgur.com/HkL10rx.png](https://i.imgur.com/HkL10rx.png))
---
Ngl, I didn’t see that coming 
---
Yes your right I just don’t know what they are going to do.
---
Yes the new season
---
Yeah. It just suck but you have to deal with it. 
---
Heh. Amateurs
---
I fuck with it 
---
I dislike
---
Love it.
---
Gonna play him in the squad either instead of Dok or alongside jackal.
---
Will have to frag out till plant, then save my scans for during and post plant.
---
Ironic, he could save others from drones, but not himself
---
Only available in casual. When you choose vote to kick all other teammates must vote yes, or else they stay. So if the team killer is in a party with a buddy chances are they won't be kicked. Also it can't be match point for some reason. 
---
With who?
---
When is the tts live? 
---
You hardly earn them. It's totally random chance other than the whole winning part. You should get them for levelling up or have a weekly alpha pack challenge like they've had before.
---
Really? I would have thought lion first bc i never saw blitz get banned
---
Nothing like promoting a garbage lifestyle choice as a good thing, as a fat person I really appreciate they put a pig like this in the game so I can feel better about my weight.
---
Lol I guess you've got a problem with half the police in America then 😂
---
Anyway you're still avoiding the point: this is a game, not real life. It might reflect the real world in some ways but it has no obligation to do so.
---
If it’s in ranked u can’t kick anyone but if it’s in cas u only get one opportunity to kick someone and if they don’t get kicked u wont be able to kick anyone else unless someone on your team started the vote to kick and if it’s the match point for a side u also wont be able to kick someone.
---
that hitbox thicccccc
---
Hib got that chonk face now
---
Giannis would make an incredible op
---
If she can even catch you without getting winded.
---
Not sure I like the new Hibana...
---
LMAO
---
By breaches I mean someone with breach charges or better, sorry for bad explanation
---
Except for hibana
---
Hope not
---
Sometimes I'm in a party with my friends when I do it and I just see the player speaker go nuts the minute we ban her lol. 
---
Is it Free Weekend again? Unbelievable.
---
They'll just buff his gun and give him smokes (extreme scenario), but given how, one, he's still extremely powerful, and two, pros agreed with this, I don't think he'll be in the extremes. He'll be in the balanced range.
---
Pls leave our ops faces alone
---
THEY TOON OUT MY BOI... my boi montagne lmao he too op
---
I have never seen a Montagne ban in all my si games
---
I do.
---
But the bold head and tatoos with the biker jacket shirtless is too much away from what he looks like.
---
More like blackbeard than bandit.
---
 My squad and I are mid to high gold and we played a five stack of high plats and one diamond the other day. It was ridiculous.
---
239 POUNDS!!!! THATS MORE THEN A PRO FOOTBALL PLAYER!!!
---
&gt; Athletes for whom running around is irrelevant.
---
She’s supposed to be a special operator. You’d think that jogging every now and then is a part of the training. 
---
This guy beats his wife
---
Oh, can’t wait to see what the danish operator is
---
True, maybe one day it'll be better
---
Yea can I get a uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
its ok she is pregnant after all ^or ^not
---
Really seems like no one likes playing vs blitz and lion, I guess the only logical thing to do is take away ash’s acog 
---
Not a salty ash player, just don’t think priorities are in line over at Ubi 
---
?
---
I personally think his loadout is a pretty sound setup, I really enjoy using both the UMP and the M1014 depending on the situation, the sidearms are fine as they are, you are correct in the sense that it could be nice to have an individual smg, cause players choose pulse over castle with the loadouts they have.
---
In regards to the barricades I'd like them to fully block the doorway so drones can't access, double damage buff and I think people would pick him a lot more.
---
anyone knows when these new prices will be implemented in game?
---
D r u g s
---
I don’t think you can buy stuff on the TTS since it wouldn’t transfer over to your normal account. It’ll be added with the full release of the new season.  
---
[that's every half shield.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKo4xMhcAxY)
---
Very good. How about the mag on Mp5 next?
---
If they nerf him all everyone’s going to do is complain. Just like how everyone whines about him now
---
It seems like the community is 50/50 on it. I think it's badass, easy money to be spent. Fits his back story and looks like he's gonna fuck you up.
---
she's such a weak pick tho 
---
No way that’s weird, he’s that powerful huh? I guess there’s no real way to defend if he smokes a room but still lol and I will thanks for the info, and yeah hopefully mozzie and gridlock look fun too 
---
Get ready for....OH LAWDDDDD SHE COMINN
---
Blitz is an attacker
---
They could have put an undershirt on him.  I'm actually okay with the idea of him wearing his gang colors, but this is like a new level of bad in terms of "people don't wear shit like this".  Put a shirt on him, give him hair like his reveal pic, and I'd be okay with it.
---
Welcome to siege 
---
We have every camera except Evil Eye
---
She's obese
---
Female Shugoki! They finally added her! To a wrong game, though...
---
Wow
---
Ok?
---
Not glad, historic military costumes are the best.
---
Doesn't mean he isn't annoying tho. UBI running out of ideas and making so many global operators is high on the list of UBI Oopsie.
---
Funny. During Year 2, i once complained on this sub about the "Lean" spamming that all those youtubers and pro-league folks were doing. Got downvoted to oblivion and was told that this game wasn't for me. Guess times have changed eh?
---
It was quite the rude awakening
---
All lies, you cannot ban a god!
---
Wtf is this?
---
theres no such thing as a fundamental aspect of his ability, his ability was hated by everyone, devs included since the first week he was out
---
Choonky
---
ABSOLUTE   U N I T 
---
HAHAHAHAAHA VERY BIG FUNNY
---
Which is exactly what id imagine they were going for,  when someone is undercover they have to fully go for it, which might mean tattoos etc. I think they nailed his portfolio and reguardless of how much you or I like it this is pretty representative of his bio, in my opinion at least. And not only that but he gives off a very sons of anarchy type look which is what i ALWAYS AND INSTANTLY think of when I think of a "gang ready to fight" not some dork in a hair band. We can agree to disagree and i dont even really like the skin but it is what it is and i think its accurate so 
---
Siege was never realistic lol. People need to realize that. Thermites exothermic charge, thatchers EMP, pulses heartbeat sensor. Smokes chemical warfare. This game has been absolute nonsense from the beginning. 
---
Talking about tactical realism what you want to say about the new tk/damage reverse system or lions ee-one-d or invisible guys mines or c/qe spam or a running 5 speed blitz with a heavy-fucking-shield in his hands and  and acog shotgun able to spawnpeek or reviving with the shot of stim pistol and many more..
---
Can u peak even more?? That's the question. 
---
I'd prefer it if ash and zofia couldn't get through 
---
Let me repost this even though it has been posted multiple times already
---
Can they do ANYTHING in this game without breaking two other things?
---
Git gud
---
Quad stack looked better 
---
For me it was Lion 100%
---
Clearly you alone know the secret to playing her well, not the pros nor all the plats and diamonds in the world
---
Breathless
---
Lolol. You tried and failed. But hey good attempt, good luck next time. I'm sure your life is amazing that's why you're bitching about ppl bitching online. Don't have enough friends so you clamor for reddit clout? 
---
I didn’t feel the sake of ignoring any of it even though I should have.  You clearly just felt like sounding all smarty pants in a completely irrelevant context, considering given this context it has nothing to do with what you are talking about.  She is a damn whale.  BuT bMi AnD mUsCuLe WeIgHt... we all know what you were doing, nice to see you double down on it makes it funnier lol
---
It says maverick not maestro lmao
---
Kapkan was one of the first elite skins and it's based of the 80s
---
YESSSSSS
---
Sometimes you can’t really tell :P
---
Yeah, I'll do that eventually, for now, I'm going to complain to strangers on the internet about other  strangers on the internet
---
Okay. What you say here makes sense. It still does not explain the "instakill" stuff you were talking about earlier. You're just saying player will die sooner. Well, obviously. 
---
Why does ubi have to keep making them even more unrealistic...  every season gets worse.  This is not r6, this is some whack version of call of duty.
---
Damn 
---
I think its supposed to have said maestro ^
---
no u
---
her shotgun is great. i never use the smg. stick to close quarters with her. don't go to clubhouse garage, for example. say near bedroom and deny the fuze/jackal/sledge/grenades from above as well as cut off bathroom/kitchen rotation. she's not a long-range fragger anymore. no smg should be.
---
Conclusive evidence points to braindead.
---
Look closely. 
---
Hentai*
---
Back when getting hit in the shoulders wasn't basically a death sentence. 
---
Blitz as a slow op trying to push someone back is better for the game. 
---
Eww
---
I always thought it was in?? I've constantly found myself making murder holes in silent mode only to have them align with my chin when it's off.
---
I swear I saw this clip months ago, possibly just the same place but I remain skeptical
---
Wait how did they manage to do that?
---
that would be a good operator honestly, one to heal attackers, might need a good balance feature to it though
---
No, about 95% tho 
---
I like this meme.
---
I do not like GPS satellites or drones.
---
TACHANKA STILL SEXY BEAST
---
Out of all the exploits on cod4 it's just no-scoping :(
---
no silent jumps, bounces, strafe jumping, fps abuse, wall running, run reset or nothing else? :(
---
Hibana face?
---
Lesion looks more disappointed in this update then we do.
---
How many more posts are we gonna find about this elite set? Let's find out
---
Ah one
---
Ah two-whoooo
---
Ah three
---
Fourfivesixseveneightnineteneleventwelevethirthteen 
---
When 3 attackers get greedy to kill you as you're down but that bandit saved by Nitro-ing them .
---
Told me to TK in 9rder to perform a glitch, I know I'm a dumbass
---
Uhm how about no.
---
Yeah I guess so tbh. Plus all the ridiculous weapon skins and costumes. I guess it's still always 'acted' like it's realistic, as opposed to games like TF2 that don't even bother with any facade.
---
Here’s to many more to come! 
---
As mentioned in a PM, the G8A1 was designed for German military and police units so presumably they used at least some of them. As for why IQ, it'd be because she's an attacker and defenders aren't meant to have mobile LMGs for a while yet until Maestro came along.
---
That’s embarrassing 
---
Uhhh i'm all for representation of all body types, but how exactly is an obese person supposed to be a special forces operative? Doesn't matter if it was a guy or girl, she clearly is overweight and not muscular lol.
---
Most that is muscle too, valkrie finally has a comptetator?
---
You know she has a lot of gear on right
---
People don’t know ho to counter him lol that’s why he’s banned so much. 
---
THE THICKNESSSSSSSSSS
---
And cos everyone hates her 
---
Omg the TV! 
---
German voices never seem to match their faces IMO. Usually their high pitch.
---
You must be small-minded then. Shields add a layer of tactical variety to the gameplay. They're the only ops that genuinely play entirely differently from all of the other ops. 
---
However, in their current state they are very inconsistent for not the shield user and his enemy, and are overall frustrating when in play because of multiple issues/glitches. If/when they are fixed, I see them being a lot of fun and adding something to the game that other shooters don't offer.
---
Yeah on console it's very ass, on PC it's very much capable.
---
I hope there isn't a ban meta, banning Lion is already a waste as he's really not played a lot anyway. I want bans where people take into account the map and side they're on rather than just blanket ban for every map
---
Console players in a nutshell. 
---
Bandit elite? 
---
Cav T H I C C
---
Fourfivesixseveneightnineteneleventwelevethirthteen
---
I just twitched not gonna lie
---
*Yeets hammer 
---
^(beep boop same with finka)
---
She is a sturdy woman.
---
Finally something that isnt the bandit elite
---
She look absolutely disgusting (go find the post on TTS)
---
It look poorly rendered, hope it's a bug and not her remodel 
---
Ela is now a sassy black woman get over it XD
---
Because it has "Tom Clancy" in the title and his brand has traditionally been very focused on the technical details. If one doesn't want people care about things like this don't put "Tom Clancy" in the title.
---
He is jesus christ himself
---
2 hours, because I had to work on Ela and Zofia. 
---
Can we all agree this is the worst Elite?
---
I’m pretty sure Capitao’s mags are the 30 round FAL mags. They’re a bit longer than the standard 20 round ones. 
---
She’s just big boned ok!
---
All ops are free on tts.
---
rip me, I laso thought it's a countdown for buying it, never occured to me either that they just completely remove them
---
Pics?
---
What’s your crouch key bind? 
---
G2 is selling pens now? 
---
It's a neat idea, but I just hate how old he looks. He looks as old as if not older than thatcher.
---
#DRUGS
---
Yeah it's being happening for a while 
---
Why is there so much shit talk for this? It looks great.
---
Both of those ops sound pretty nice. Mozzie as someone who can give more vision to team, but gridlock definitely sounds broken. More traps than zophia/frost?? Lesion has a CD before he can spread his traps everywhere, which balances him out. But people who have a set number of traps usually only have 3.
---
r/unexpectedguardiansofthegalaxy ?
---
It's even worse when crouched and it's not even in the patch notes for burnt horizon...Ubi pls
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DzqL_1EVsAAZja5.jpg:large
---
Yeah hopefully they bring something for ranked in S1. I was so looking forward for the pick and ban in ranked. But now we have to wait another 6 months..but still glad its coming tho. Ubi has done a great job for y4, hopefully will little to no noticable bugs 👍🏻
---
Someone called me out for being a 'free weekend player' the other day. I quit the game before he could see my 130+ hours :(
---
I feel like it would look better with some hair or something instead of the straight buzzcut and beard. Personally speaking, anyways. 
---
Idk why you got downvoted. You can down people from further away now more easily as Cav. 
---
Skin name is Cosmic Nexus
---
Magical holograms and an all seeing flying drone don't break immersion but a plus-sized character does :thinking:
---
"xbox"
---
that shotgun is still amazing and the pistol is good for range. that said, the only downside to the smg is the fire rate.
---
I think you just log into your old steam/Uplay account right?
---
How did he hide that beard under his balaclava this whole time??
---
Do you even understand how they changed Cav last patch? It was more of a buff overall. But please continue with this false narrative that Cav has been nerfed into the ground. 
---
&gt;you haven't said anything that would make the system better than the current one.
---
Please,please,please read my comments. 
---
lul remember when we had to buy attachments... Those were the days...
---
Not a big fan of this. I still like but if they took out the excess of tattos, put him a muscle shirt and a leader jacked, would look cooler. But thats just my opinion.
---
Queue times in ranked are already rough at times, I am not sure that is the best idea, but, I do understand some people will want to stick with their controller, but... I mean... if you're in Ranked, you should be playing with a competitive mindset, and if you have the option to use a M/K (without the adapater, assuming the devs allow it outright) you prolly should be using it.
---
But... I unno.. I enjoy sitting back and playing with my controller on Xbox, where I usually play and I even play with it on PC sometimes and do okay, but M/K is the better control device, so you should prolly use it if its available, as it stands right now tho, it's literally a pay to win mechanic. Pay 60-100 bucks for an adapter get a free advantage.
---
I have a freind who uses one and he is still right at my skill level, so depends on the player, but running into a hardcore PC player on Xbox with a M/K while you're FORCED to use a controller is fucking annoying, something needs to be done for sure. 
---
Team has clinical dumb
---
I wouldnt say bad, just completely unneccessary
---
oh yeah, forgot about that.
---
What the hell?! 
---
Their hideous!
---
What fuckin rank you be playing in 
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m not a game developer lol, who knows how she will perform once the season starts, with her new scope combined with her gadget she might be an extremely dominant flank watch. Her hitbox might not be an issue if she’s used properly, but nobody knows what proper is for her yet. Only time will tell
---
i think he means the total went down more than it said he lost
---
The Capitao one is good though. Now he actually looks 1 day away from retirement 
---
Yeah, I would've done that as well but I was watching the stream every now and then so. Haha. Still though, they could have made the Diamond one more distinct, that's my only gripe.
---
cav and hib look like downgrades...
---
The fact that he doesn’t have a bag of Coke on his hip is disappointing to me
---
I’d call it a buff, he gets to deny even larger areas.
---
Sure it’s less damage, but the defenders still can’t be wherever his asphyxiation bolt lands, but now they can’t be in an even larger area than before.
---
Well I used to always go Glaz on Coastline but fuck it I'm going Capitao from now on
---
You're right and you should say it.
---
I dislike it because its just straight up lame. I’d even go for Tower.
---
Its been leaked. It actually looks dope.
---
If you're talking about 2899 and still being in Gold 3 instead of Gold 2, that's always been the case.  
---
Basically think of it as "Up to, but not including" and that you have to actually pass the threshold to get to the next rank.
---
I’ll give that a try 
---
There will always be bugs, simple rule of programming, changing one thing will ruin 15 others. But I agree, PnB system is dope af. Can't wait myself, not sure if I will ever play casual again. :c
---
&gt;female operator smol and womanly
---
hurrdurr elite can't be this, too weak
---
&gt;female operator an absolute UNIT
---
hurrdurr why she fat
---
they just can't please you all, can they?
---
umm
---
They shouldn't because part of the skill of mastering them is acknowledging the blast. Just like with breaching charges.
---
So they're making cav's pistol the worst pistol in the game, literally
---
Drugs.
---
Yeah, I getcha. I love playing with my controller and I don’t want to pay for a keyboard/adapter just to win, that ruins the game for me. :( Its even in casual now too on Xbox, the game is losing it.
---
y o i n k 
---
That makes sense
---
From Melbourne, and I never have heard it in my life before there was the Tumblr post about the phrase
---
Bruhhh that looks litty 
---
I’d like to see the defenders cause a lot of the matches I was in tachanka got banned, so maybe he’ll get top 5
---
Sweet! Thanks for the info :)
---
I will never be able to live this down 
---
"too good" in gold and below
---
This is a cursed image 
---
Do they share weapon skins? Could Grid have a Brazilian flag on her M249?
---
Monty is more strategically useful, you can just melee blitz and shoot em. I'd ban all shields tho, if I could.
---
From Melbourne and it's exactly how you say
---
The recoil change is shit, its a nerf.
---
If old valk and gridlock had a baby, the new cav face would be what it looks like
---
So basically, they expanded elo hell.
---
F**k.
---
Where drugs
---
Its not it chief
---
You’re shooting well before you’re ADS
---
Bandit, but he never stopped selling drugs 
---
Clash? Nani
---
Right, so the community upvotes garbage like this but then all become white knights when someone whines about toxicity towards female gamers. Such hyprocrisy.
---
I addressed that though, this isnt about realism. You can watch a Godzilla movie and suspend disbelief that there is massive monster the size of a city eating people, but see a bolt action rifle shoot semi-auto, and it takes you right out of it.
---
I have a similar feeling here.
---
I came here thinking the comments were going to be exclusively “thiccs” - but nope; you’ve both made me proud and disappointed me, Reddit. 
---
Idk why people are complaining it’s legit what his backstory is a BIKER
---
Any stats on how often someone named after a character and name was banned while they were in the game? How many of those resulted in a leave?
---
Welcome to Elo Hell. First Time? (Insert ‘first time’ hanging meme)
---
fuck you
---
They really, really embraced the undercover theme here.
---
Hats off.
---
The para has better ads time, so it makes him better as an aggressive pusher than his lmg 
---
console players are another breed 
---
*coughs* Blitz LMG
---
Lol nice one.
---
*DRUGS OVERDOSE*
---
that’s the way the mag should be. the bullets are 50 beowulf and the other mag made no sense bc it was a quad stacked magazine which only 5 rounds of 50 beowulf would fit in. but now that’s the right magazine to where 10 rounds of 50 beowulf will fit. 
---
iuuu
---
Bc it's near impossible to please today's gaming community. 
---
Yeah, my friend from high school was too fat for conscription army, they just told him to go lose some weight and check back again in 2 years. And he really wasn't even that obese and he could run pretty well too. 
---
This shit is just pushing some Ubisofts agenda. Just stupid.
---
&gt;This game isn't promised immersion
---
What do you mean by this? what do you think immersion means?
---
Shhhh that's too smart for reddit
---
Clash????
---
yeah ofc it's possible
---
Buff
---
So of all the DMR operators, you use the operator with the worst DMR, that also has access to one of the best, if not THE best, Assault rifle in the game, the FAMAS?
---
Tbh I can’t tell if this is bait or not. If it isn’t: Yikes.
---
She seems like 4 armor though
---
Operation health is basically a....
---
If the animation isn't him pulling out a battery and attaching nipple clamps to it, I will be highly disappointed 
---
Irl an acog on a m249 is beast mode.  This scope is just dumb
---
*Finishes thunt solo on hard*
---
*Earns 36 renown*
---
"Am I a joke to you?"
---
Ubi, legit increase the gains. It's really useless for newcommers who want to practice.
---
Don’t have a pc
---
Better than being downed regardless of hp
---
Yay! Now fix the rest of the magazine inconsistencies in the game.
---
idk about you but essentially anything other than black ice camo or a dope headgear/outfit is worthless af.
---
but basically black ice is all my and my homies are ripping packs for.
---
CHOO CHOO ITS GRIDLOCK
---
When yesterday u bought jackal for R6 credits and he will cost 20K renown :/
---
Please no
---
Damn, I should go "freshen up" with some comp i suppose.
---
Liliput confirmed.
---
I wish this was on pc so we could see chat 
---
march 5th
---
honestly thought it wasn't a cosplay at first
---
God that looks...just bad
---
Because this is getting a bit ridiculous, a 224 pound female operator?
---
I try pulling this off never works
---
Can't believe people are saying she doesn't look Japanese.
---
In the new face, she looks kinda like the [wrestler Asuka](https://pm1.narvii.com/6873/e7e00408a772e874c2567db1d159c24e780e4fder1-1080-697v2_hq.jpg) with that hairbob.
---
Mixed with that early to mid 2000s Japanese fashion style that Japanese video game characters had (ex. [Asuka from Tekken](https://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2013/03/24/61612/0c219bd5710b185d77e0e13c9d0ce7b9-700.jpg)).
---
The old face was....like she mixed or something.
---
That's what capitaõ was originally going to do, ubi decided it didn't flow right 
---
That's a good question.
---
This is what I *need* from this game. 
---
I laughed too hard and cried harder. 
---
lthis looks so gay i kinda love it
---
&gt;just 24 lbs shy
---
I think you underestimate how much 24 lbs really is. Also, most of the time spec ops or military units will be less bulky due to the amount of cardio involved
---
I don't have anything against overweight people. But shouldn't a high tier operator be a little less overweight and maybe a bit more fit?
---
(NOT expecting skinny super feminine character.)
---
That’s the bandit face reveal..... yikes. 
---
That's basically how I'd picture Thatcher telling mozzie that.
---
missed the /s
---
Yeah that happens to me all the time. I use lesion and I can’t hear when I throw gu mines down or when someone steps in it. And sometimes I can’t hear myself reload...which means I can’t hear when enemies reload either! 
---
How would you suggest they fix smurfing 
---
Wonder if he'd be friends with Mozzie. Anyway, can't wait to buy this, it looks badass.
---
What the fuck 
---
that's not a smurf fix, that's a deranking fix
---
That's why they should add a noise when you start defusing the defuser, just like csgo 
---
Heckin BIG  C H O N K E R
---
Low tier bait
---
Tbh they should’ve seen the reflex. 
---
##The Sons of Siege 
---
Right? Instead they all get put on my team like I'm some kind of special ed teacher. I don't have the resources and time to teach all these people, Ubi. 
---
:(
---
He had the year three season pass uniform. I'm not sure if you get that stuff with the new editions but if you don't then he's not new.
---
Tachanka, wears Maska SCH helmet with steel face shield. Gets 1 tapped by a 9x18 round.
---
Speaking of rounds, 9x18 does 62 damage.
---
While 7.62x51 NATO does 68.
---
And the .50 Beowolf does 62.
---
Wtf are these damages?
---
I rarely ever get MVP, but I might buy that just knowing that bandit has a bad ass bike.
---
Love the flame gun skins though.
---
All these are cool and all but they made Cav... chubby?
---
thats not smurfing
---
I posted an image of hibana's face similar to this picture and it got deleted.... Good subreddit
---
Smurfing means playing beneath your skill, same difference.
---
That would be a hilarious and kinda needed change
---
When your teammates mêle your castle instead of tearing it down and u don’t get it back
---
Hey, quite a few of them are realistic 
---
don't play fps with wifi...
---
Good thing you know about his pick rate in proleague because that it true. But in a 1v1 situation (in regular ranked games unlike the team coordination in proleague) blitz should win 100% of the time unless there are explosives to counter him.
---
Smurfing is playing beneath your skill on a second account
---
Agreed. 
---
That's some SJW s**t on there
---
That’s assuming we won’t have enough time to give each country their own season. ie the game is winding down its content 
---
Bandit has already had a face reveal but not in this way of course.
---
Just don’t tk back 
---
For attack those 1st two were mostly ones banned.
---
I got this one... it sucks
---
Can we have the hibana elite animation in game please?
---
I agree. I strongly dislike the "overwatch" type stuff they're putting out nowadays.
---
Of course this is getting polished lol
---
I play with the lan cable 
---
r/intothesoulstone
---
matchmaking limiting? Bans for throwing/leaving? Matchmaking skewed to favour higher ranks? I'm not a multibillion dollar corporation with millions of players worth of data to work with.
---
How so?
---
I just hope her hitbox wouldn't be a problem in game.
---
On defense I like it on the Alda, to some degree the Caveria Spas. 
---
How do you ever find a cav in the obj at all?
---
With shit quality on 20 year old codecs which I'm sure the devs are not that stupid to use.
---
Ever heard of VP9 or H.265?
---
I tried to blow em...
---
I hope so lol. I’d figure more kids are on consoles since their os is easier to understand and they’re generally easier for kids. 
---
Different Strokes for different folks.
---
On a side note, I really do think I’ve seen your name before haha. Maybe yesterday? Big thonk. If we were playing together yesterday, the enemy team was exploiting and therefore cheating, and I may have lost my cool ngl but this kind of stuff really grinds my gears. I digress. 
---
Ya that's what he is supposed to be good at, he's just too strong because they made him 2 speed like dumbasses when he was fine as a 1 speed. Regardless, be aware and don't get singled out by him, use some basic teamwork. I'm only plat 2 on PC (was diamond on Xbox back in the day) and I almost never see people bring Blitz just because he's not that easy to keep alive against better players.
---
Alibi's CX4 has a very high rate of fire and had almost no recoil when it came out. Same for Maestro's LMG, which lasted through several updates until being recoil nerfed just recently.
---
Maverick's torch is still silent most of the time and makes holding objective untenable as a defender because reinforcements mean nothing. Kaid has a DMR with an ACOG on defense, a gun that, even with the suppressor mounted, takes only 2 shots to kill anyone.
---
Clash is not terribly overpowered, but the spin/switch to SMG tactic made her a ninja turtle. While her draw speed has been reduced, it's still the meta for her.
---
Good old pocket sniper. 
---
lol I could squat him
---
nooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO pls say it aint so
---
Gay for pay(drugs)
---
Ok chalet is fine tho bc even if it isn’t in PL it’s a fun and balanced map to play on. It has the same qualities of Oregon where there are 2 main sites and 2 harder to defend ones that are still win-able on. Kafe isn’t fun and only has 2 viable sites to defend and skyscraper is balanced but not fun. 
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Lmao have you seen her fingers in game? They look manly and dirty
---
That is what I like to hear, you keep on this track and you will be getting a some cookies. :P

At the begining of the round

Hello AgentStriker, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/as71r2/lion_dabbed_on_me_today/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Season 4 of year one released years ago buddy... It was called red crow and had hibana and echo in it 👍🏼
---
G2 is better in LANs than in normal PL, and wearing down Empire with that 22 round match was the ticket. 
---
Bc it would be incredibly op. Do you even play this game
---
Infinite armor 0 speed ooof
---
As far as I know it's impossible without using steroids for a woman to be obese BMI, but not obese fat percentage. For guys the amount that fit this you need to live in the Gym and basically be a bodybuilder. 
---
Console. That explains it. *sarcasm
---
Nice!
---
Flair checks out. I trust the doctor's assessment. 
---
Ho be lookin like magic mike
---
Yes he is because no matter how much i shoot that shield it is unstoppable and wont break
---
I like where ur going with this, how do I tag Ubisoft Montréal 
---
She might not have much armor but shes definitely not a 1 speed
---
I didn't say the same rank. Limiting. LIMIT. and that's what cas is for, if you down play within an acceptable limit. with the newcomer playlist and the changes to cas. Or just skew it so you're put against higher ranks, say instigate a rule that a plat can't play against a silver, easy shit.
---
That doesn't affect people owning multiple accounts, which I have nothing against, I have a stacked and a solo queue account, I manage to not have one in copper 4 and one in plat. (Both are mid-high gold). 
---
I don't see a problem with me not having a fix, again, I'm not a multi-billion dollar corporation that pays people to fix this shit
---
As far as I am aware operators don't share, I am not sure about the OP unlock, but I think starter edition still has to unlock ops, not 100 on that tho. But I know OPs do not share across game sharing, outside of season pass sharing. 
---
Honestly wish she was tall. When I look at her I fear for my life, but every comment I've read that states her height just confuses me. 
---
The look of disbelief 
---
What really to 20!!!! 
---
&gt;True there is the inconsistency with her, but I personally I don't see this as something Ubi should invest time on sorting out.
---
I agree and I think thats fair, at this point I don't expect nor think it would be incredibly productive for ubisoft to roll back the character for this issue. That being said I remain firm it doesn't do well to support an immersive gaming experience.
---
&gt;Call me out for caring for the small pleasures, but im just happy there's another 3 armour non shield on attack, even if there isn't any ACTUAL armour on it.
---
Hell yeah man, another thing I totally agree on, personally I'm not a fan of 3 armours, but the role she fills is needed and I'm glad for her design in that regard.
---
I never felt this was a huge issue, but it didn't really make sense to me why they would design (aesthetically) a character like this, it just doesn't mesh well with the game in my opinion.
---
Again, overall it's not a huge deal, just wanted to see where other people in the community stood  on the topic. Thanks for your input, and sorry for the cognitive dissonance comment, was pretty passive aggressive. Enjoy your night
---
We can all agree she like Ultra Thicc right?
---
Well i know i did something wrong when i have less upvotes than comments. All in favour of removing this post say I. All who oppose say Nay 
---
That’s pretty dope
---
Staged
---
I remember seeing that shit when the invisible glitches were put 
---
ya, it’s happens like 6 games in a row sometimes
---
Muh inclusion.
---
Erm... Ok?
---
So I'm Jackal, Ash, Blitz, Sledge... Or one of the many other operators who's roles include hunting roamers and pushing site. I get Downed and revived. What do you expect me to do if not push the objective with you? Sledge the floor on the spot I was revived? Scan for footprints and tell you "sorry none here, good luck pushing obj"? Blow open a soft wall 50m from obj?
---
Think before you post. 
---
Caveira becoming leafy and hibana is pretty tired
---
Ya but he can't hurt you when his shield is up, toss c4 behind him, you have a team for a reason, it's a team game dude
---
I have this happen to me a lot. I have had a whole team run past me to kill a different  for  them all to be in my cross fire and die some did kill teammates. My teammate was mad asking f\*\*\*ing dumb they were to all run past me. I posted a video of a IQ not seeing me playing as rook. Had a jackal walk right up to my past(I posted that one too). Oh and bear traps middle of rooms can be messed even ones that are on tables as well.
---
That's what I thought, Mozzie will get impact grenades and Mozzie will get breach charges
---
I hate it so much. Just add the hair from the other face reveal. Everything else is amazing, but the hair. Please Ubi. Pls.
---
Given the fauna of Australia,this is indeed a bold statement.
---
At any moment a hairy eight-legged Ayers Manfucker is gonna kick in a reinforced wall and stare Mozzie in the eye like "'eard ye talking shit 'bout fuckin' spiders,mate."
---
Additionally to the hacked keys, you can get compromised accounts which can get legitimate players banned so the person who loses their account due to bad password management, click jacking, phishing or w/e either ends up fighting their case and getting a refund or not playing the game again. However they could also buy another copy of the game but i am not sure how many cases that actually happens unless they have a specific affinity to the game and don't mind starting over again.
---
TLDR: Any hacker worth their salt will not pay to cheat in a game, they will find a way to mitigate expenses to themselves.
---
It's not fake , this is a in game file , the closest thing it can get to faked is if the devs don't release it.
---
That also makes it more skill based making a operator that requires time to learn how to use
---
he does need to get nerf you idiot. now or later he will get further nerf or rework, right now he's in the overpicked too strong territory. don't believe me? just look at the official stats yourself [https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/y3s3.2\_designers\_notes\_v2\_image2\_337147.png](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/y3s3.2_designers_notes_v2_image2_337147.png)
---
I guess I’m gonna be a bandit main now 
---
They changed what you get recently. 
---
I dont know why this is being downvoted. In siege, you cant prevent everything, that would be unfair. What you can do is gather experience and knowledge, and understand the most likely way you can be attacked or flanked. If you have a claymore, you eventually learn what window people are most likely to hit you from, place it there. Sometimes you make a bad call, sometimes you get outplayed, that's the fun of this game. The only reason I enjoy this game is because it was so hard to learn this and get any good at it. I still suck at it but I'm usually new the top of the board when I play with friends.

As an Asian, I know a Chinese girl who looks like prepatch Hibana and a Japanese girl who looks like post patch Hibana.

Thank you because im new and i use her often even though her gun is wacky recoil for me at times, but i really like using her for some reason. Thought i was crippling my team before you said this (even though id say ive had more success with her than failure so far)
---
Must have been free weekend.
---
I am well aware of the context. You don't need to refer to more rook armor as that is so rare as to be nearly completely irrelevant. 
---
The person said *the gadgets* I mentioned would *now* instakill if low on HP rather than down someone.  You are saying after the changes, you can only take one bullet and a *few* traps and be insta killed as a result. My statement was only about gadgets, as was the other person's. He said THE GADGETS THAT I MENTIONED WOULD NOW INSTA KILL. That is false. Only the bullets will now insta kill, now the gadgets that I mentioned. You are the one who is not aware of context here. 
---
You also say that if you opt to proceed without being reset and have 1 to 19 HP, you can withstand traps and survive by being downed. That was also true prior to the change. If you opt to proceed with 1 to 49 HP, you could withstand the traps I mentioned and be downed rather than killed. The only difference is how many traps you can take. The concept of insta kills with respect to the traps I mentioned is irrelevant. 
---
I mostly use shotgun and I like his sidearms, not a huge fan of ump but I know some like it. 
---
But I feel shooting toes is a big aspect of castle play and unless you have mute that buff just makes them spend extra time and you lose intel yourself. And when you say double damage do you mean melee or explosives? Melee I could see, explosives would be op. You'd have to make sure your team brought basically only operators with explosives just in case and then castle would absorb so much utility just to get into objectives. 
---
To your additional comment, I feel that would be OP. That would make certain ops must picks just to get through the castle barricades ie sledge, buck, finka, etc. I see the reasoning but it would be too much.

Why would I use this instead of glaz or anyone one on the attackers who can aim
---
This. I'm way more scared of Gridlock than Ela. Honestly more scared of Gridlock then a number of other OPs. 
---
If this is serious I think that he’s perfect the way he is in exception to one thing and that’s countering shield ops, I think his turret should have two types of ammo. 
---
Ammo option 1 is his normal ammo
---
Ammo option 2 is armor piercing that has less damage but can shoot through shield operators shield such as Montagne, blitz, fuze, and recruit, this includes deployable shields as well as clash, but it only does 15-20 damage per shot and takes 2-3 headshots since its penetrating the shield and he only has one drum of it, and I think that this would work because of his weakness to shields comes from them being completely able to push him and him not having any explosives or a way to kill them since he can be flashed through it allowing blitz to rush in and slap him, this makes him more viable in more situations as well since the armor penetrating can shoot through reinforcements and most metal objects but at a reduced damage, allowing him to do this opens up a whole new field of play styles, tactics, and overall just good ideas.
---
For the people who want a summary here’s the TL:DR, let him shoot through metal with a different  ammo but only give him a drum of it and make it do reduced penetration damage by a lot if it’s through metal
---
Lmao
---
Probably best to contact support, I know some other reported similar problems.
---
It might make me like it tbh
---
Its supposed to be a grounded tactical shooter, shooting your friend in the foot isn't in line with the more realistic/grounded approach to the game, so I mean.... it makes sense lol. Just because nobody asked for it doesn't mean it is a good change, you should be punished for getting low health, you got shot, getting shot again shouldn't be a way to heal a player. :d
---
On the defender side.
---
The travel time of the Super V system with full length rifle rounds would take too long to be a really good firerate, i think a little faster is realistic but anything above 900RPM i feel is pushing it. 
---
Their team: level 200, 500 IQ, somehow ranked above diamond 
---
Your team: your ash fell off the roof yelled at you in game chat and left (yes this happened)

they're all scripted

As an Australian, I can verify the phrase “well I’m not here to fuck spiders.”

&gt;I agree and I think thats fair, at this point I don't expect nor think it would be incredibly productive for ubisoft to roll back the character for this issue. That being said I remain firm it doesn't do well to support an immersive gaming experience.

Maybe, like how Hibana got her makeover, they could do something. But I guess they wanted to stress on her beefiness more. It is definitely unique, just....a little too unique.

The gadget maybe you might want to use a different operator every one has different ops that they like sure maybe 50% of players won't like the op but the people who do I can see that they'll love it
---
If you think this game is a "grounded tactical shooter" I got a bridge to sell you.
---
Ela.
---
Zofia doesn't set traps,but maybe she could use them.
---
But you have met every girl right? Like, all of them in the world? I'd have to assume so from the way you drew your conclusion of "I haven't met a woman who is heavy and strong, so they do not exist, despite the fact I have clearly not researched the topic" 
---
Damn that bitch is fat
---
Her primary, which has a slow RoF and crap damage?
---
Oh cool, another one
---
I am a little confused with your post. When playing the game are you saying the mouse cursor keeps leaving the game and going onto another monitor?
---
Papilia’s signature made me smile when I noticed the smiley face....
---
In addition to being chonky thick, she Tallyo!
---
Well great,y post this dude? Now ubi is going to patch the drop off for his bolt.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Best elite set by far this one looks amazing!! 
---
Alright, they don't make ALL the female OPs with those intentions. 
---
Is this fake? 
---
Hibana is a potato now
---
they all look worse. except maybe Hibana
---
Where the hell are the rest of your upvotes?
---
eww
---
For a Gridlock nerf,I would suggest that Jager ADS should be able to destroy the ball,but not any spikes that spill out of them.
---
Gives an incentive for Thatch/IQ to sweep obj like normal before Grid traps the defuser,instead of allowing her to yeet them in with abandon.
---
So that's the reason why we aren't getting pick and ban this season...
---
The gadget doesn't make sense for the op. It's a sniper, why have a gadget where you have to be on the front lines. Plus, this is an incredibly op gadget. You can do everything without the need of other ops. 
---
Lmao wtf
---
\*facepalm\* Yes, Ela. My bad. I always confuse the two on accident. 
---
Naw, just my main and a second account for when I want a less toxic experience than I get on my main haha.
---
Idk laxiing is pretty jacked
---
Uh, it is. Is it the most grounded tactical shooter? naw, but it's more grounded than Call of Duty, Battlefield, Titanfall, it's even more grounded than Counter Strike, the only thing I can think of off the top of my head that fits the name more is shit like Ready or Not, SWAT and maybe Insurgency and Squad, I would argue they are more realistic, but that doesn't make R6S not grounded in reality at all, it is just more loose with it. 
---
His bolt has never had drop off, and it sure would be a shame if they changed something super overpowered before it became exploited by the toxic parts of the community.
---
DrUgS
---
I wonder what that event could be....i mean....pink-white suits looking like damn furries and unicorn,plastic soldiers...
---
key word "variant"
---
NiCe
---
In their defense they kind of have to do this with new ops and most games do this when introducing new characters. The reason isn't that they don't know but that introducing powerful characters draws back more people than weak characters.
---
You're far less likely to get people to come back to your game if the new additions are stale.
---
You missed his point. Nothing to do with what gamemode was selected for the custom game. 
---
To all those who think blitz is op, he’s really not. He’s just annoying. He’s so easy to counter. Just get good.
---
Please god please god please god ##NO##   
---
^(Look at Smoke’s boner)   
---
Yeah. I guess they are going in a ‘new direction’ then. 
---
Concave with controkfrwak
---
I think original bandits voice actor is not brutal enough for that skin
---
Isn’t the m249 both belt and mag fed ( real one )?
---
No she’s basically ash + cav + iq + hibana + sonic
---
Yea it is my bad. 
---
That's a pass for me lmfao I'll stick to the black/red biker uniform and helmet
---
This destroys the imagination of his handsome face behind that GSG9 mask
---
IQ and Glaz arent really in that category, but yeah I hope to see more of casual/rugged elite skins
---
i didnt really read the entire thing because it's 12:30 for me and i'm choofed but i guess i shouldve specified that it's more of an easy way to stop attackers pushing yellow and the other stairs since it's a bomb obj strat bc you can see all the entrances to both sites except that small wall on yellow stairs that leads into consul
---
Oh come on now you're just making stuff up. Enlighten me, what's a VMS?
---
Actually MIT developed a pulse detector apparently: [http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/184347-mit-perfects-cheap-accurate-through-wall-movement-and-heartbeat-detection-with-wifi](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/184347-mit-perfects-cheap-accurate-through-wall-movement-and-heartbeat-detection-with-wifi)
---
yeah but who the fuck is he? he just showed up outa no where
---
A standard m249 can be loaded both ways on one variant. Say you run out of belts you can do an emergency reload with a magazine. While there are a few variants of the gun there is only one variant in the game and it’s appears to be the standard m249 or the para version.
---
You are so easily flushed out and then met with crossfire, that I would never want to play this position in any other level than bronze and below. Even then it needs coordination with a team to bring Jäger etc. 
---
I don’t understand why they chose Secret Service over CIA.
---
so it's a quicker reload than Capitao's like how Mozzie god speed reloads his SMG?
---
The reason they removed Ash acog was because the R4C was picked 99% of the time and was almost a straight upgrade to the G36C with better recoil, fire rate and 1 extra damage. So they wanted a bit more even pick rate between her primaries.
---
You buy it I guess
---
List?
---
Amatures?
---
I friend becomes so happy when I pick castle because he can pick Maestro and taze me so as  to hear me scream.
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrggggggggggggggggggggh
---
Bandit is norman reedus?
---
This made me think back to the meme about Bandit being shocked by his CED so much he couldn't use the ACOG anymore. 
---
Oh god I want to die
---
Except on the mp5 for some strange reason, but almost nobody uses holo on that gun anyway.
---
it worked in a plat match and in a scrim but idk
---
mp5 legendary skin where it's the exact same but the magazine isn't piss yellow
---
YES YES YES OH MY GOD
---
Who broke Lesion's heart? 
---
What in the Everloving Fuck is that, and where do i get it?!
---
“Being lazy” what is lazy about this 
---
Of course clash 
---
Love how Mira isn't there. 
---
Are you sure it was because of that, I have never had that problem.
---
Copied the same lmg just with a mag difference im guessing
---
The character doesn't just conform to what he wants; it doesn't conform to realistic standards set by previous rainbow operators, or any realistic standards set by most  developed militaries. Sure she meets the bare minimum BMI, but it would be reasonable to assume that she only meets the bare minimum for other physical standards, such as endurance, and only at the most basic level. Compared to the other operators, and their real-life counterparts, she is far below par.
---
How could she aim if she was always out of breath? Do we expect her to not move at all? How is she to move efficiently and at the same speed as other operators when she has 3 armor? Why present a bigger target? Why make more sound? 
---
Her depiction is an extreme outlier compared to any other operator, real or fictional. One could almost be forgiven for thinking that a realism was not a goal here, but inclusion was. 
---
Yea
---
Fair enough 
---
As a gay player this is the most dumbest shit
---
So what? Every German with a bald head is a nazi?
---
its the new repainted version
---
Cav vs Maestro with explosions, basically the same thing as just cause 
---
Minus the fact that he used to work as deep undercover police in the drug trade. You know, like this elite skin is supposed to be based off of. It'd make perfect sense for him to ditch the beard after returning to normal duties. 
---
How!? Huh?! ACOG=Ash, without acog ash is nothing
---
I would pay money for that tachanka skin
---
Hello U_are_rarted! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
Please let us disable advanced gadget placement, it feels much better to me to use default
---
I got an idea for you Ubi. Rework operators with ugly faces on everything except the new Elite set which you can buy for just $14.99
---
I still would take this skin over the legendary i got for ying
---
I haave tbe same experience on xbox my mate il lvl 26 other freind lvl 20 ish me 118,(but trash) our teammates are all under lvl 20 and the enemies all 200+diamonds in cas.
---
I think the solution would be have matchmaking based of your actual performance or k/d because ive had the game 2 years im high level but bad 
---
Too much mastrubating 
---
That or go to a pride parade
---
Exclusive feature available on all other devices except the one you call personal computer. 
---
Well that's lucky. I mean, put a Buck underneath and you are forced to move into the window player's crosshair. Or just a simple Ash/Zofia to the window and you're dead. Also, if the window's still there after the plant, that practically guarantees your roamers no chance of getting back upstairs.
---
A nice idea, but with no escape route, I don't find myself in a comfortable position there. 
---
I appreciate your sentiment but as I was simply making a statement your passive aggressive tone is most definitely uncalled for and  before you attack simple internet comments take a moment to think in the future. Big lesson to learn there bud. 
---
Not all ops will unlock by default anymore
---
Hibana actually looks Asian now
---
It’s basically like “that sucks”
---
Big oof. 
---
These 60 FOV 30 FPS console plays &lt;3
---
Oh piss off. Ubisoft can do whatever the fuck they want it's their game. Don't like it? Don't play it. 
---
Half of your fucking gadgets were built in China, you gonna complain about that as well?
---
Got g36 last week
---
Just the Russian sights on all weapons would be fine tbh... I hate the normal acog... 
---
"Maybe we have to take her gun away and put her in the kitchen. Maybe then they will see she is a woman" - Ubisoft 2019
---
.... No, it was a nerf. You could flush out anyone holding an angle or anchoring site. It was 100% a nerf and not about Zofia.
---
What I find frustrating and so irritating is every weapon drops a mag when you empty the mag. But not the UMP45 used by Pulse and Castle. Been so since beta....
---
Next up fix that pls. And a options to have the empty shells lie on the floor. Would be so realistic.
---
“I hate stairs” 
---
Its the fucking koolaid man
---
Exactly...
---
**\*\*Drugs instensifies\*\***
---
Yeah, as a male, I would like to apologize for this. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this kind of bs. It's very sad that it has to be like that. Plenty of statistics show that there are a lot of female gamers out there, so I probably play with many of them, but they almost never talk because of this. And, also, I gotta be honest, I quite enjoy it when they are in one of my games since they are a lot less toxic in general, and I think they are cool for ignoring the haters and all that. Once again, I am very sorry you have to deal with this kind of thing. 
---
A solution is very simple. The games, where someone gets reported, should be watched by picked players of the game or even ubisoft themselves. The ones that say this kind of thing should be warned and then banned if they do it a second time.
---
replace jackal with fuze is better so they blinded and can't move when fuze coming in or replace jackal with zofia, not only you're blinded because ying now you're stunned from concussion grenade
---
I'd love to see those "strats" lmao
---
oh get lost. if the few MINOR aesthetic changes allows Ubisoft to give siege a longer life with more updates and content by having a whole other COUNTRY to sell to then why complain. 
---
makes sense. 
---
echo having 2 drones is aids
---
Wtf is that hibana 
---
He can just stand still in Clubhouse and blend in perfectly, Ubi pls nerf
---
The fuck had happend to Cav? :(
---
I hate Helicopters
---
I noticed this too. I think that the build used during public events (like the six invitational) has slight censorship so that the gameplay can be used in trailers internationally. This change shouldn't be on the live build or the test server. 
---
Holy shit it looks like that C4 went way higher than it should've.
---
:\~\]
---
I mean how does this even happen or get approved?
---
oh god poor hibana
---
The 1st round could have ended in a draw
---
They're generally not every in depth. I've just been given the role because I've played the game the longest. Most of my 'strats' would probably have been pro league in Year 1 when I actually paid attention to stuff like that.
---
3 armor and diabetes type
---
I switched to the holo today for my first day back to siege in two weeks after binging apex for two weeks and honestly the holo doesn’t feel much different. Ash is all about rushing and being in your face anyway so it kind of works out
---
whyyyyyyy
---
that’s all it is. if they do the changes they were going to do months ago then it’s removing pre existing blood spatter from walls (blood still shows when you shoot someone), removal of slot machines from the 2 maps that have them, and this icon change. people upset about this are ridiculous 
---
Yes, you are right. I should completely abandon all these hours invested into this game and community because developers want to spread their game on new area and need to follow some laws to do so. /s
---
Get a fucking grip mate, nobody cares about this changes. It's still the same game
---
I mean it kind of is, just not in the same meaning.
---
Well that 60% is including PC as well, so obviously they don't like him either.
---
Also Cav is garbage in higher ranks, she only makes an impact in lower ranks
---
I respect your opinion on why you feel Siege to you isn’t a hyper realistic shooter and that Gridlock belongs on Siege with her heavier character model. However I don’t appreciate you assuming I think women being in this game is a problem. I actually like that part of the game because it makes it more appealing to people who are new to competitive FPS or maybe even more women are likely to play siege because it has a lot of female ops. Aside from realism and R6 Siege straying away from its roots in the house trailer 4 years ago I think it sets a bad example, in no world should it be encouraged to be out of shape and borderline obese. Its unhealthy. Shit I’d be ok with a transsexual in the game. At least there’s nothing physically detrimental that can come from that so it can’t set a bad example.
---
Wild guess here there ls only one TTS build and that os the most restricted. 
---
No drone is brave enough to go near that
---
Compare her bodyarmor to Monthys, yet they are both 3 armor
---
*Uninstalling in 5..... 4...... 3....... 2........ 1.......*
---
Asking the real questions. Where is the thiccness?
---
So sons of anarchy then?
---
Yeah I fucking said it.
---
No im not in silver or bronze, and if you think that rank is the one ultimate unit that scales how good youre at the game, youre pretty closed minded and are not thinking about plenty of other issues the game has. I was talking about road to sI, last time i checked there was no RANK  in road to si.
---
&gt;Boo hoo look at me i am plat ur opinion is invalid
---
Hibana and capitao are fine but I prefer the previous Lesion and Caveira
---
Ash Elite is everywhere because they gave it to people for free when it first released. I have Glaz Elite, i just don't use Glaz that much even more so with his upcoming nerf.
---
One could only hope. This shits amazing. Take my money ubi
---
thats what u get for playing sledge with shotgun and flashbangs D:
---
Cav is not garbage in any rank, shes garbage where theres no comms.
---
I’m gonna fucking cry.
---
Personally dont see him being remotely used effectively in casual and low ranks in terms of his gadget. 
---
name checks out
---
When is the release date for this or do we not have one yet?
---
I always try to ban Tachanka because I can't manage Gods on my game
---
"C'mon, I'm not here to fuck spiders."
---
damn
---
I hope they go with less white on the gun skins.
---
Cav : &lt;Yelling&gt; Tell them how we roll (kinda forget what's she's yelling)
---
you: i thought it was stealth operation
---
I've never played this before, what am I looking at? This guy is hidden in plain sight obviously, but beyond that, what context am I missing?
---
Well that would be harder cos he can still shoot lol I’m gonna try that
---
"Maybe we don't understand our playerbase and they keep making fun of us, but we don't care. Because we are almost done changing all the sand from Assassins Creed Origin to snow so we can shit out our next Assasins Creed. Assassins Creed Syberia." - Ubisoft 2019
---
dude this was every team the first few days lion was out, except replace blitz with finka
---
I think for most people it's more of a thing not wanting to have to now to these ridiculous Chinese rules. I mean c'mon, if you remove all that "violent stuff" you'd have to remove all of siege.
---
♥
---
Get the fuck over it
---
I called it actually
---
they goobisofting fucking hibana
---
Well fuck
---
It makes perfect sense, you're complaining for no reason.
---
Capitao should be focused on flushing people out, not hoping you get a kill off his fire bolts. They put it perfectly, his gadget isn't meant to be a frag grenade.
---
I like it! 
---
Great Balls of Fire!
---
I think you'd need to buy it.
---
Unleak it
---
Absolute unit
---
Arctic 5. Just under your budget and it’s absolute quality. 
---
Wish they kept the hair and tattoo
---
jesus i've never imagined bandit with a beard, it's terrifying 
---
And you have to admit, the 'no comms' and rank usually go hand in hand. The lower the rank you are the less ppl in comms there will be
---
These leaks are getting ridiculous 
---
I mean all the German operators will all have elite uniforms, either Smoke is after that, Castle or a DLC operator again however Castle is getting a rework which makes me wonder if they'll give him an elite yet.
---
I'm already a fucking Mozzie main lmao
---
They took the quadstack from Maverick and gave it to Gridlock XD
---
What the fuck?! Who would let an obese person do such a job. What a fucking joke.
---
Get ready to be fucked 
---
I wish we got an Outbreak version of her. Casual. Earpiece. No hat, no sunglasses. She seems like a nice character but the game forces me to hate her
---
t h i c c
---
Maestro Shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
---
I disagree with you x infinity
---
We win.
---
Drugs. 
---
I heard Elas face used to look like it was melting
---
Chunky too slow
---
*t h i c c*
---
Btw I'm not a plat either, but I've been everywhere from bronze 4 to plat 3  in the year and a half ish that I've had this game and the higher I've went the less effective I've seen cav
---
Greasy. I like it.
---
It would have been 1-1 then
---
The hitbox fixed ages ago
---
this was leaked in the livestream https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokyRudeRamenPeteZarollTie
---
Arctis 5 2019 edition!
---
Wow, I mean i'm glad that we finally gonna get elite set for Bandit, but I expected something different, like full leather jacket, and face more look like face what we know before (i'm talking about face revealed in trailer).
---
Yup, i think they need to slighty change his face.
---
So, now they need to give us after this, elite for our gas mate: Smoke!
---
What a legend
---
I never understood why it had the 60 round mag in the first place...
---
Until next season when another attacker is added then the rows aren't even anymore
---
Glad I'm not the only one that noticed that lol. 
---
What the heck
---
the gsg9 logo is just the german coat of arms. 
---
# 
---
Humans suck sometimes bud. :c
---
So when are they going to let us turn off cosmetics so I don’t have to hurt my brain looking at this nonsense?
---
Because dude wearing a motorbike helmet is cartoonish?
---
Box look too big
---
Now box fix small
---
Operation white noise
---
&gt;plus hackers like to hang around there
---
why tf would a "hacker" play in copper?
---
all the "hackers" the people encounter in copper are smurfs who simply have basic gameknowledge/sens
---
No, the percentages calculate separately. If a defender was banned every single match it would be 100%. And that doesn't affect the second defender banned in those matches. Just look at Blitz with his 64% :)
---
I once shot Ash at point blank and missed. I have a clip of it on Xbox
---
God damn this thread is an embarrassing gathering of incels lol.
---
Not a leak, Ubisoft showed it to us during the invitational. :P
---
But, meh. 
---
Honestly, I like these and I don’t even care that I’m a walking target. But please, to the people who prefer the more tacticool skins, you’re not forced to buy anything so dont complain everytime a skin with a bit if color gets released, thanks!
---
the but fuck excuse what me
---
Lotta people say that. I think I might go with this one 
---
So what, who cares about him?
---
Day one
---
What is this product supposed to be? Could ya translate?
---
You don't know much about guns, do you.
---
Lesion got closer to the camera
---
the eagle is just the german coat of arms not the gsg9 logo
---
It’s alright bro 
---
Well im just going off what I've heard, it would make sense for them to be there as well. Have fun smashing easy and clueless people. Hackers just play too annoy people for there own pleasure 
---
Why does this remind me more of demo-man from tf2
---
Not too hard too find Israelis or Jews in the US, and there are many characters who aren't born in the respective countries they are representing that doesn't mean will be seeing those countries, as for CS:GO, we are talking about a game where you can play and win as real terrorist groups, I don't think they care about controversy surrounding the CTU's.
---
Personally I would love to see Israeli operators just because I really would want a Galil in this game
---
Your friend lied to you
---
That weapon skin is fucking gorgeous, can't wait to buy this elite it's the best one yet
---
Gridlock
---
I would like to see that optic brought to dmrs PLEASE
---
wow amazing enemy team haha
---
Is that just your speculation or what 
---
Sure, Kassandra and Ubisoft taught me that.
---
Why not? Does it have to add something? Why does Pulse wear sunglasses, what does this add to his character?
---
I speak Dutch so I was placed in the WEU by default but I hated it that I never met people who spoke English well enough or Dutch. So I made the decision to swap to the NEU server.
---
Now I get teamed up with mostly Scandinavian and British people so basically everyone speaks English and it seems like people there are friendlier too so I definitely recommend making the switch! It's not like your ping will rise a lot (mine went from 32 to 43) and the overall experience is better 
---
No I mean have you seen “ her “ 
---
That Hibana change tho..
---
It really is
---
I HAD TO GET USED TO TWITCH AND BLITZ'S NEW FACES, NOW I HAVE TO GET USED TO THIS SHIT... Ubi.... WHY DO YOU DO THESE STUPID HORRID UNNECESSARY THINGS TO SUCH A GREAT COMMUNITY AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Yes I have seen her. 
---
So just your speculation then lol
---
0:53 who in their fucking mind, puts a gearbox up that high. Do they not realise they are quite heavy, and since there isn't much weight at the bellhousing end its awkward to lift since its not balanced.
---
i kinda ship?
---
People are going to buy this and I'm going to have to look at it, and that's what upsets me more than anything.
---
&gt;Have fun smashing easy and clueless people.
---
When playing with cheats, even diamond will be like copper, no need to grind down to copper which is hard enough in the first place
---
That moment when people dont realise that the weight of most op are really wonky.
---
Yeet
---
Bad.
---
Good.
---
Bad. 
---
Yes 
---
Blitz and maverick make sense but why the other three
---
And even when you choose to play recruit you'll get tk'd
---
Yes. This is how I got the Dust Line ops when my PS4 broke down and I wasn’t able to play for a few months. Still think they should knock down the price for new or DLC ops across the board. Gatekeeping ops in this kind of game is unfair IMO.
---
I can eventually recover my account but it would take a lot of time and would be exhausting
---
Did you even watch the CGI-short film?
---
**This is neither a leak nor a new story mode coming.**
---
I think the new player playlist is good but the 3 maps should have been Consulate Bank and Border.
---
Read what you just wrote. You have to land your shots. Yes. She now requires skill to play. In what world should you be rewarded for missing?
---
Yummy spots thx
---
Why people hate montagne that much? :(
---
You can see all I have so far in my insta @madness4them along side some other siege related stuff and siege unrelated stuff as well. 
---
So I've done most of them in 2017, Ying was done in 2018 and I'm restarting to do he ines I'm missing and will post them as soon as I finish.
---
Well I have bad news for you
---
Yea I’d have to agree, but hey, new elite skin tho.
---
please watch the whole stream or at least the panels beforehand posting... 
---
this was not leaked, it was shown at the "Rainbow Six Universe" panel
---
It's the Internet. Censoring is just one step toward stripping us of our rights. If they want to call you mean words by all means let them do it. You have the means to block communication with them. Utilize it.
---
At the end of the day it's just a game. Get over it. 
---
Other than they fling metal things at other things? Not really. I shot them in boy scouts. But as far as types of ammunition and all that, no I don't. And I'm confident *most* people don't know about ammunition types. Nor would they be able to tell you that a magazine can't hold a certain type of ammunition just by looking at it. This is silly lol
---
hahahah funny hahaha he said 'Hahahahaa funny hahaha' sarcastically that was even funnier than the original comment xD
---
They're both fantastic. Jackal is just fun to play and having the ability to keep an eye on whether or not someone has been near you recently is great if you're solo. Plus, the pressure his gadget provides makes you nightmare for roamers, coupled with his fantastic weapons including a shotgun secondary that makes you a discount Buck in the right hands. 
---
Zofia has a really solid AK and her gadget is very versatile. Her impact rounds eclipse Ash's breaching rounds because of their immediate detonation. The concussion rounds also help out with more than just a stun, since they are proximity detonated to help you get an idea of where your target is inside a room.
---
Honestly, I'd flip a coin.
---
That's really good bro
---
I don't use the bearing LOL
---
Yeah but that doesn’t mean the skin doesn’t also look like shit 
---
I'm not entirely sure if it's correct to say that about game sense. I feel like strategical knowledge is included in game sense and on some sites the sheer fact that secure players reinforce every site wall available, it by default makes their game sense worse than those, who play bomb and understand more about map control. Also the so called good fraggers that play exclusively secure area, they are my most common interrogation victims. Why? Because they lack game sense. They usually lack the understanding of vertical play, because that is really not present in secure area as much as in bomb.
---
To be clear, I am not stating that everyone who plays secure is bad. I am saying, that the people who refuse to play secure area are generally a bit better, because bomb forces you to approach the game differently. 
---
I think ive seen smarter r6s AI terrorists than them.
---
Big girls can still be operators
---
But that being said I can already see the news headline
---
"New R6 operator's weight is a reminder that girls are not welcome in the gaming community"
---
Take it back
---
Always ban that nightmare Caviera 
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** fatmooch69! ^(hug)
---
I did, this picture was leaked during the livestream https://www.twitch.tv/videos/381618253?t=0h25m0s
---
Hibana looks terrible tbh
---
He meant ignored to get an Elite is what I am thinking because yes, they made him beautiful.
---
It's kids police motorcycle toy, with local police insignia
---
Pretty sure they dont hv license from both local police and ubisoft
---
The focus on the scars in the blonde guy...i dont know...looks like they are trying to say something 
---
After Glaz vivisection I am not surprised of anything. At least it's lore accurate.
---
hibana looked so good previously..
---
atm I dont really care because I prefer the invitational skin
---
Or it could be a goatee
---
Not letting toxic people playing your game is a great idea! Wow noone ever think about that!
---
I wonder why noone has ever impletend such a simple system to kill toxicity.
---
damn shes ZARYA THICK
---
Blue lights for Mozzie, red as standard 
---
Montagne D;
---
Hibana didn't look fine at all, but now she looks like a mannequin
---
Why is Gomorrah!?
---
i'm reposting this  on r/prequelmemes for karma
---
The difference between EU and NA right there.
---
FUTA GRIDLOCK
---
Gign finally completes the elite set with this monstrosity 
---
Oh u right
---
*BLLLYYAT*
---
They don't reveal Fuze's face bc Interpol is actively looking for him for all that hostage kills
---
Have a look at any HW women weightlifters or powerlifters they fat but also muscular
---
Literally Caveira was only banned because they can't deal with her face to face. She doesn't offer any kind of utility, like Jager for example, and most of they time they end up dying 1st. Someone who plays cav doesn't mean they are OP or will pull off an interrogation, it's just the FEAR of BEING interrogated and potentially ending up screwing the round because of that. And let's be honest here, if you are feared of Cav, just don't roam around the map like the complete fool you are. Help with the push, put pressure on the Obj and then Caveira will try to get site control while being on a 1v3. LITERALLY, so many operators could be banned like bandit to avoid bandit tricking, Jager so you can throw your fucking smoke, kaid so no obstacle when it comes to hatches, French Bois because well, they are popular and they do have a lot of utility and are more frustrated to play against when pushing in, aiming you with their acogs. I get echo, but Cav is literally OP because the community thinks so. 
---
Even if you just leave out the actual map design, the old hereford was so much better. Who decided it would a good idea to change the setting to be as boring and depressing as possible
---
M762 with ACOG, Angled Grip, and Compensator
---
RG15 with Muzzle Break and Laser
---
Claymore
---
Mid-grim sky
---
Finally some diversity XD
---
If they change this and dont change the maps is it still that big of a problem ? Just askin
---
Hello InsanityBrickBoi, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/as9b6q/pc_friends_game_crashed_then_sort_of_uninstalled/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Looks trash ngl
---
She makes lardex look vegan.
---
prolly muh ebic lore 
---
Ok, in the teaser she looked big and tall and it was believable, in game model though looks like an oreo that has too much filling and is spreading and leaking at the middle
---
You're right. Here's a 2018 weightlifting champion - [Tatiana Kashirina](https://bodyconstructor.com/pictures/pic_big/gallery/IMG_NOV-2015/IWF_2015/jeni-nad_75_kg.-kashirina.jpg). 102kg, 1.77m - a perfect match.  
---
[Wouldn't](http://s018.radikal.ru/i509/1603/b2/602823675d96.jpg) really call her muscular though. Strong back and tendons, sure, but i doubt she'd do great in a military.
---
death by snu snu
---
Buck me in the ash?
---
Thanks!
---
Lmao! 
---
I might be blind, but where?
---
We had a good run bois 
---
This isnt on some wierd aspect ratio right?
---
Dunno man. Usually no on. Would be taking it seriously. I saw tachanka banned more than echo was
---
I guess I'm getting Yumiko's elite after all.
---
Custom match set up? No way they couldn’t see you or hear you. The reaction of the team when they lost was unusual too
---
This is fhe second time Hibana and Cap had this done, so the face altering is not an indication, as (I know Hibana will be shortly) neither of them have received and elite yet.
---
the battery skin looks very lazy
---
The whole point of a smurf is to go against new players. I can guarantee you that this will be just as filled with smurfs as low level games already are
---
partially why I want to remove teamkilling entirely. But you guys insist it stay for "taktikill raseaons" instead of removing it for its obvious pull down effect on the game. You guys bitch all day and all night about teamkilling and how to mitigate it instead of just saying "this system is worthless" and just getting rid of it.
---
Gee, he took it harder than Jager losing an ACOG
---
Bandit seems excited. 
---
Thank God this games an 18
---
Because they are too cheap. I just told you one suggestion how to handle it, but it's temporarily expensive. Companies today are short-sighted and too greedy to play the long game.
---
You were trying to be sarcastic, while failing to realize how correct I was. 
---
Actually looks kinda cool
---
Probably dumb question but Capitao's crossbow has no projectile drop? This could probably get cheeky with drone holes, snowmobile on chalet for example? 
---
&gt; His whole purpose is to be the aggressive shield op, he is made for flushing people out of areas, not gonna leave the area?
---
what a ridiculous operator idea? why not give on to the defenders then? "oh, an attacker wont leave the hard angle he has on a OBJ door, lets send a defender a fast defender that has a shield with a flashbang on it, can blind me even i turn away, and can shoot me while he has a shield covering half his body including his head". 
---
teamwork goes out the window to take someone down. just send in Blitz.
---
easy cowboy...
---
I like the AUG too but I don't want 20 more of them 
---
I really just hate Maverick far more. That dude upends the entire meta and banning him puts me back into the game I loved before he was released.
---
He didn’t FOLLOW THE PATTERN, which is NOT NICE
---
But why Hibana she was fine the first face. Then they changed her into an anime girl. Now they are changing her again, but this time it just doesn't look right.
---
god forbid a person might voice their opinion in a forum dedicated just for that purpose lmao.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way, but the amount of upvotes the person has do suggest that someone cares. Please avoid being a dick for no reason.
---
The only Japanese other from anime you've seen? Sure
---
Not realising that I could drive a yokai drone through electrified barbed wire without destroying the drone. This took me almost a year to find out, and even then it was me spectating my friend who just got echo who made me realise this, when he accidentally drove through it because he already thought it would destroy it as well.
---
if he didn’t do that I would still be avoiding electrified barbed wire to this day with yokai drones.
---
Kafe is good ur just bad on it
---
They already revealed his face, though. Check the concept art.
---
Dirt IV

HaHa cOnSoLe pEaSaNt

That was a joke calm down
---
Shot a Frost, and I wasn’t sure why I was getting kicked.
---
Turns out I shot Buck in the head.
---
Oh shit it didn’t look that slow rip thought it was on par with the other pistols but to be fair lusions damage is way higher than every pistol so shouldn’t it be more damage less fire rate for the sake of balance?
---
First 5 armor Operator.
---
They said they were going to create a separate game for those in asia, don’t think it’s a permanent change, they may have been people invited from Asia to play and I’m guessing if a Asia prop team was to play they would use the censored version of the game because of their laws. Even if it does change, it won’t affect the game but I understand the concern for ubi catering for a specific market instead of everyone. 
---
Lol. 2 claws vs 4 batteries. Jammer have a lot more use than the spiders. Can spiders stop Thermite charges, Hibana charges, dokka calls? No. Different gadget with different uses. Anyone with a shred of critical thinking sees the differences. Are you also going to say that Cav and Lion are the same ops since they show enemy locations? Lmao. 
---
I don't think you generally spawnpeek from that corner...
---
oh , right
---
I was still a noob at 130 hours 
---
Idk herra ylivääpeli herra
---
Why is smoke now packin a big BULGE now.
---
2-3 weeks
---
As soon as you’re flashed just keep knifing, works  more than you’d think
---
I guess they had blind and all limb amputee medical officer.
---
24th or 25th February was the launch i think 
---
Wtf
---
Also for anyone asking I don't want him banned it was just a question
---
I dont think it is digital multicam, if you look at it in game it just looks like multicam but the pattern has been made alot smaller. Looks like a mess imo
---
The new Holo is really nice tho
---
Sweet man.
---
A ping would be enough on pc u also have a keyboard which is always helpful 
---
Only on free Weekend
---
What is this life?
---
Ah nice i was expecting something like mid March! 
---
*Laughs in Finka's thighs*
---
Tts is only on pc 
---
Really, what is it called?
---
Because you got used to it.
---
And the bed getting downer
---
Jesus that was brutal. Some people are just flat out fuck wads.
---
If you can't source it it isn't a fact, If i say that I am diamond but wont even give a link to my r6tracker  account it isn't a proven fact since I can just make it up (like I just did)
---
The ground would shake
---
Yeah I gotta agree with you, both of them are badass in their own rights.  I don't know why people are so bothered by Gridlock's size when you can get spawn peeked by a dude wearing a football helmet.  Siege stopped being 100% serious and accurate ages ago. 
---
There was also one time last year when i droned a room and saw a guy (under lvl 50) rushing to where i was so i shot him and he started screaming that i cheat. And the next round he was blitz and he just stood there and didn't move so i shot his hand till he died and yelled "cheater i had a shield you can't kill me" 
---
Oh boy. I can’t wait for these to be patched out. 
---
Really dislike this. 
---
*coughs in not being a drug dealer*
---
Face looks better then the one in the test server 
---
Love how lion turned around and looked at Doc like “the fuck?” 
---
Its ususally smaller but this one is that big for everyone and it works afterwards so it's fine this time
---
He's gonna bust down your door, make you wear a kilt and drown you in haggis while he patreotically plays the bagpipes
---
I unterstand your problem and I for sure do not support this toxic behaviour, but it's really hard for a program to distinguish between deliberate actions and accidents. The only thing registered is a tk. For sure you could insta ban everyone that ever kills a teammate, but as described before, such things happen frequently outside of a toxic context. So it would also hit a lot of normal people out there that just made a mistake, or had to act like that to secure the round. 
---
I also don't think the current changes are enough, but they are more than welcome, since it's a big improvement. 
---
For your issue they would have to change more, but the question is wich system would work best against those people, without affecting the rest.
---
I could imagine something like tk's in prep phase should instantly kick you and most importantly repetitive tk's should be punished harder. So people that tk often in multiple games get more attention than people that just managed to accidentaly wallbang their teammate through 5 walls.
---
Also a System that counts damage done to the team instead of simply looking for the kill, should be considered, but that are all just ideas, that have to be tested. 
---
I'm certain they will further improve the system against toxic behaviour, but it's a long process until you get it perfectly right.
---
The vote kick thing is a completely different story and also hard to adress, since you actually already have a security against toxic use (every Player in the team has to agree), wich fails if people joined the game together or just feel funny in that moment. I think you could actually remove that option, since in a perfect world their own anti-toxic-behaviour System should deal with kickworthy players, so you don't have to have the possibility to do it yourself. Ranked works fine without that option.
---
What the fuck have the done to hibana
---
Oh they actually require that now? I fiqured you did it on your own just to avoid any hassel. Seen some cosplays with some pretty real looking guns (think some of them were) in the past and I was actually really wondering about that at conventions. 
---
Got my answer :)

Like Goku's lead clothing.

---
This is the worst skin I've ever seen in any game
---
Thats cuz sledge doesn't have those big boobs
---
What’s the problem
---
Thx
---
Hmm, both rook and ash have already had a Pro league set about 2 years ago
---
i wish
---
The Penta skin was being announced/released at the Paris Major IIRC and then G2 picked them up a few days before it. That was 6 months or so ago though. 
---
I think if we get a G2 skin it will be either in S9 Finals or The Six Major in August sort of time.
---
They are broken spots that shouldn't be accessible. On villa in the office next to the garage, you could vault on top of the bookshelf, but not anymore. It got fixed even tough it wasn't a bug.
---
Rust Cohle Bandit
---
She's 17 stone - SLIGHTLY heavier than Kaid. Calm down. 
---
I really wish they would have done an east German skin but eh, I could see why that would offend some people so I guess this also works.
---
Sir your sight is on wrong its on backwards but the gun is still cool
---
Alright that's fuckin' sick BUT Why does he have flames on all of his stuff and not lightening bolts?
---
*what did you just bring upon this cursed land*
---
Oh no
---
Run
---
Im comfused wether to down vote or up vote
---
Ur such patriotic that's litteraly annoying there is a wrong colored and wrong numbered police car on clubhouse and not a single German post about ewww that's wrong awwww u can't pronounce Jäger wrong.
---
Be happy about not having emus in the map and stfu
---
Fragging usually refers to early round kills
---
And I can say that he's an idiot who wants to die on the battlefield because they will interfere with his sight. You can invent anything as long as it's convenient to you, but the bottom line is - whatever, let him have his glasses.

Rainbow 69 siege

Still probably not intended places to get into
---
This is the most accurate way of seeing it.
---
Please ubi, do NOT put this in the game.
---
In march 3rd i guess...? Because thats the last date that you can get the volcano skin from the season pass
---
A ping wheel on console would be nice
---
Dude chill it's clearly a joke 
---
That's what they said.they had no details to go with it tho
---
Wow he looks like he's in a Nazi-Biker Gang
---
Something tells me that is placeholder…
---
I disagree, but ok. 
---
pls ubi don't, don't turn this game into fortnite or overwatch. this doens't fit the game at all imo. 
---
Reznov?!? pff...  Give me Zakhaev
---
Unfortunatly they fixed it. But made us laugh every round on Clubhouse 
---
 You gon be kicked in the bollocks by a kangaroo 
---
How does this work lol😂
---
I'm buying this
---
wtf is with this company. we get harry and now this
---
There are a ton of kids who play this game and yes they play super aggressive, which does work in this game. 
---
There are triangular signs in Austrailia too.
---
Yea defenders have to be AFK for 50 seconds for this to even have chance of working.... nice trick.
---
When im curios so i can activate it on the ubisoft club app
---
Booooooooo
---
And insight fat tolerance 
---
This is what happens when you keep upboating dank memes for the sake of it
---
Snowflake spotted
---
I'm wrong that a character that not only LOOKS like a girl, not only SOUNDS like a girl, but is also called a girl is a girl? That makes complete sense, thanks for opening my eyes. 
---
smoke is my new main when this hits live
---
If I ever do log on to another account that's low enough, I'll probably *only* play Newcomer's.  
---
After all, I can help teavh the newbies and stick it to the experienced players taking advantage of them.
---
I actually like this (Please Don't Nerf Blitz)
---
Pushing a *lefty* agenda onto one of gaming's most toxic communities is going to work out terribly, same thing happened with Clash "oh no! A bald woman? Must be a trans dude gay SJW shit!!!1!"
---
Gridlock doesnt even look "fat", heck she looks more believable than that "olympic gymnastic" SEAL Op...
---
Oh i got it, but i hope ubi also
---
&gt;ignores the fact that theres multiple ops over 50, an age at which many many people develop issues and naturally decline to a point where they wouldnt be near their top condition
---
rainbow fantasy magic there. Highly skill ops are too rare even in their older years there are better than much younger ones. 
---
I mean, if they didn't, the community would have given them unending flak for it.
---
Thank you for showing everyone and their grandma 
---
&gt; I just like cultures and people
---
This is just patriotism on a small scale, learn to feel pride man. We all live on the history of our ancestors, dont disregard their lives because you weren't alive back then.
---
Anyway this is getting too derailed
---
I didnt get any!! :( where are the 3000 renown?
---
I keep seeing this and it makes me think of Bo4 gridlock lol
---
She is the new Lardex
---
Ubi please no this is the tipping point
---
We're at COD candy cane man levels of skins now, huh
---
No but you're right to add on, I don't think theses player side debris would use too many resources
---
Just because they're German doesn't make offensive. The Soviets did make 'mistakes' and yet they are still featured in the Elite skins. Early 1900 Germans and the allies were as bad as each other but I don't see people complaining when they have British military skins.
---
he didnt have a shaved head in the original cinematic
---
Finally r/banditelite can finally rest in peace. but what have they done to my boy?
---
excuse me... but... WHAT THE FUCK, NOOOOOOO
---
John cena is obese according to BMI
---
I know what u mean but for me being proud on my ancestors is difficult I heard being proud for a lot of dead jews isn't the spirit of patriotism :) 
---
So this is why you posted a link to an article from 2018? When you spotted it 11 hours ago?
---
No, stop obsessing over this shit operator SMH let her die please.
---
Where are these games that Cav is not banned?!
---
Your statement seems contradictory....
---
It's like in Archer when Pam removes her top and everyone's shocked at her full back tattoo 
---
How do? 
---
Look at client side barracades though. People complain about those all the time. It wouldn't be as much of a problem but people would still complain. 
---
&gt;drones being as compact and mobile as they are,
---
the r6 drones exist now and are used in police force operations 
---
He wrote that they did implement the changes now on the test server. 
---
Well now we know who's the thiccest operator of them all.
---
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU!? 
---
I salute you
---
We need more wall-e memes
---
Also doesn’t Monty have blue eyes?
---
Legit Hibbana looks like cuts her wrists
---
Probably because most redditors only imagine asian women as either anime characters or pop culture idols who had lots of surgery and wear pounds of makeup. New Hibana looks much more believable than the old one.
---
I played Monty the other day and traded a melee kill with an enemy. I consider this to be my greatest accomplishment and am now retired
---
Blackbeard became Lady beard 
---
Nothing a little carpet bombing can’t fix.
---
UBI, YOU HAD IT BEFORE
---
I see them literally every day on ps4. I ve played pc fps my whole life, specifically counter strike in all iterations since 1999, and its so easy to spot them
---
Can't believe that took only a little more of one year to Ubi accept your idea. 
---
Not so sure why hibana got plastic surgery?
---
What do you mean? They have Finka, who can revive you from anywhere on the map for a whopping... **5HP**.
---
Fuck. Yeah, attackers need a medic. 
---
Or a shirt they’re in Germany and it’s summer a average is about 78 
---
Honestly I might have to comp for that smoke outfit ( I'm not a furry, in matter of fact I hate furrys)
---
Thanks for replying to the post anyway. It was interesting to see your perspective :)
---
My friends was the SAS for a while
---
April 1st is fast approaching 
---
Sorry, we are a PC exclusive team.
---
No problem and sry for being that salty 
---
I believe it’s next Tuesday 
---
Na I thought he was talking about the operator specifically. Who is obviously muscularly built as fuck rather than just being fat. 
---
I misunderstood what he was saying. Obviously being obese is unhealthy...
---
Oh lol yeah, dumb me 
---
What video for research purposes of course
---
I don't think realism is their target. Why are there drop hatches and drone holes in every building? L
---
Any rank requirements?
---
But if you don’t you’re fucked
---
Now you gotta do the sick reload animation and say "SWAPPING MAGS"
---
Obviously I won’t be playing her 
---
Bodybuilders actually have to be fat otherwise they fall over or break bones
---
Where is Tachanka elite then? 
---
Cocaine's a hell of a drug
---
Oh alright thank you though
---
Probably early March(usually it seems that they release the new season the Tuesday two weeks after pro leagues, but that’s what I’ve heard)
---
so am I, shit must be wrong
---
I think it’s just the new weapons
---
i lowkey want this

Why didn’t we ever get a refund for all the attachments we had to buy? Or at least a lump sum of renown?

Kinda feel shafted lmao

If it was on that red wall youd see stairs as well not to mention its about ten times faster

Errr, nope.

Just buy the elite.

uhh I feel attacked

its 100 times better than his elite unironically

I still havent got a single charm after watching the stream for at least 3 hrs a day. Any idea?

Hahahaha
---
I got three shitty charms :'( I didn't get the first weeks pack because when i pressed 'add all challenges' on the Ubi app, it just never registered and i didn't realize till the Sunday
---
u/coreross
---
The guy who leaked this also leaked the Bandit elite, and the Rook/Ash Pro League 2.0s. I doubt someone would go through all the effort of faking these for a good, especially because they spent so much time building a trustworthy reputation.
---
What if you joined 3-1. Play 1 game and get the same as everyone else? Not very fair
---
It is the Vortex Strike Eagle.  It seems Vortex got their stuff in the game as the new Holo site is also made by Vortex.

Sorry I just quickly screenshot this on my phone as I saw it uploaded. Maybe someone in the comments can put it together?

Ooo get that Slane!

If you know what you are doing you don't pick castle

No thanks, dont wanna just join a loosing ranked team, no matter how little MMR i loose.

Now this is just right up the most stupid comment I have read in a while.
---
Do you watch Proleague, ESL in general or high rank players? I assume you don't.
---
Is this a console thing?  
---
On PC if I notice a girl in chat, I haven't heard anything like this during the game that I recall.  
---
It’s not just them. It’s all of them and it’s so hard to look at.
---
Around 60% if the times. 
---
Yeah her old face was horrifying.  Gridlock's loading card is pretty bad but in game she's pretty good looking. 
---
[Pretty much](https://i.gyazo.com/a63dfffa64a235d13d0e71289c48788b.jpg)

Oh well, sorry, didnt read your comment right, I was in full defense mode :X My bad!
---
Literally the highest your PC can run while looking good
---
reminds me of the dutch saying: Mierenneuker. translated ant fucker. wich can be used when discribing nitpicking.
---
Nice drawing!
---
i still see plenty of people rocking bright yellow outbreak skins &amp; I know if these do release they will sell like hot cakes simply for thier uniqueness. 
---
So you should be able to play around it
---
Ah yes... So you are that kind of guy thinking that most R6 players are pro and the game should be balanced around them and calling people who think differently "stupid".
---
Don't even answer, I'm done talking to you.
---
Of course our real business is to place our flesh in a snake. Who fucks a spider lol 
---
I dont agree with joining ongoing ranked matches, but I do feel like you should lose less mmr if a teammate leaves or disconnects.
---
Don't forget about defying the laws of physics and floating

Or replace doc by Echo

Most people do it as a joke don't be paranoid about it

Ok which one if you Democrats at ubisoft tried pulling some "gun control"? XD
---
I dig most of the skins but seeing this hurts a bit. I mean the game's theme was always quite serious and. But THIS? 
---
Yeah we have standards here 
---
i was thinking the same thing about balance and this sounds like a great solution
---
Would've been better if she shot the arrow at the screen and the camera went black.
---
Wasn’t the 3 weeks TTS starting by Y4S2?
---
Well I mean, it is ubisoft
---

"Ding Chavez had been a member of Rainbow for what feels like forever. As he cleaned his bedazzled pink M4 carbine with unicorn charm and lamenting the loss of his ACOG scope he noticed Gridlock inserting another IV of Vegemite into her arm. He was bewildered as to how she had passed review and why he hadn't stopped her becoming a Rainbow Operative. He then recalled the changes in regulations all special operations units made to loosen height and weight standards across the board after the White Mask attacks. We all had to be more inclusive and diverse after the greatest terror action since 9/11. He chuckled half heartedly to himself about the situation. Meanwhile Gridlock polished off another tray of biscuits and was laughing at old reruns of Crocodile Hunter, Ding pondered on what John Clark would do in his situation.  He reached for his non binary flask to pay tribute to the old man, he took a mighty long swig and as if in perfect sequence the muzzle of his weapon was firmly entrenched in his mouth, his thumb grazed the trigger of his Fabulous M4 and a cacophony of rainbows and sparkles emanated from the back of his excavated skull.

Bruh it’s called -Rainbow- 6. 
---
That definitely helps. 
---
if Mozzie does nothing else but get attackers to destroy all their drones, he will have done the defenders a great service.

honestly, im not even sure if Ubi is taking a piss at this point...she's not exactly fit to operate.

Eh if I get voted by a 3 stack I deliberately tk them because it’s rather annoying when they get themselves killed and expect you to die in the first 30 seconds

Why don’t you put them in the shape of a 6

Thanks for the ping, almost missed it.

Well, it's better that way when you don't have any valid arguments left.

^^Never called you stupid btw :)

I liked it as well. The operators don't die, it's just a training, right? 
---
I was thinking about it too, and probably they are doing to make it like what they did to Nomad's airjabs. Also they might be lower his gadget down to 2.

No, you need to know so you c4 them next round

I have a second account to solo queue. My main is where I play with friends. I also play different ops on my alt since I usually play support ops on my main.

did you just buy the game before the editions changes ?
---
Check his meme, i linked it. He predicted clown operators by 2019, and now apparently it is happening

clash and caveria shouldnt be up here. theyre both trash operators

Servers are undergoing maintenance today. Could be something to do with the game connecting to a different server then it normally does because your normal server is offline at the moment.
---
What are the requirements for it?
---
What! Almost every operator has gotten a rework after their release in some form, be it weapon balancing or a slight adjustment to their gadget. Are you new to this game? I'm posting the link to last seasons win/delta. You tell me what operator you are leaving out to pick mozzie ( and I dont care what mode you are playing)?https://i.redd.it/7gafchmywbc21.jpg

Lol he’s not, he just plays like one sometimes.

Maybe just an upgrade in RAM as I can get a solid 144Hz on high settings with my i5 7600k, evga 1060 6gb and 16gb of RAM so I doubt your CPU is holding you back and your GPU should be strong enough

It is still kind of annoying.
---
She's 5.8 inches tall, which comes out to about 5'10ish
---
Cause she ate rook for dinner.
---
maybe because it got nerfed?

WTF!?

I thought the shrug was a way of them saying "try harder" like mocking you thru body language but them just standing still like a statue is well not that interesting to look at.

Agree, If nothing else his elite suits him
---
Mate mozzie throws spider bots, are we really talking realism here? 
---
Woman are not real i played for 1000hours and I never encountered one! 
---
But yea people can be really toxic in this game thats why you can mute them so you can play in peace. I know its annoying to deal with since the game rely on communication but what else are you suppose to do the only thing left is to report them for toxic behaviour.
---
It's already there.

That’s why I got so disappointed when I heard we weren’t getting it 
---
Is that a challenge?
---
The downvotes are just annoyed Australians agreeing with him. 
---
thank you :)
---
All it needs is red lens flares on her eyes and meme text
---
yeah but the idea of capturing drones everyone has had, and the method of doing so is different from Mozzie 
---
Okay because it was allways the reasoning I've why serversided debris wasn't a thing in Siege. Also in maps like Tower with close to  no destructible floors I can see that but on maps like coastline and Villa where there are breachable floors and walls everywhere. Only serversided barraicades and corpses I see your point, but as soon as these two are fixed, there will be people who will cry because breachable walls and floors aren't.
---
He (bikini) mentioned that Justin was leaving on Twitter (Justin announced it semi privately at a pro league after party) which didn’t allow Justin to announce it himself.  Kind of a dick move, but like I said I don’t think it was malicious in intent.
---
Fixed thanks
---
Thanks for the advice on the graphic settings. But from what i read about undervolting is that it helps temps and fps after long hours of stress and its mainly for laptops.. My temps are fine after 3+ hours.
---
Spot the virgin 
---
Can your team members also use the drone?
---
How'd you know? You can't see him
---
I'll grab my coat. 
---
well , thats why
---
[Laughs in bulletproof]
---
Hahaha shit im bad
---
? 
---
Yeah you have no idea what youre talking about.
---
Many powerlifters average at about 15-20% bfa. Sometimes even higher.
---
Fucking shit just look up mathias steiner, winner of olympia a few years back.
---
Sure there are people that are more ripped, but looking thicc is definitely a powerlifter thing and anyone with at least a little bit of an idea on powerlifting recognizes a powerlifting body. Of you cant, you are clueless 
---
It’s part of the new battle pass
---
That they keep.
---
&gt; Okay because it was allways the reasoning I've why serversided debris wasn't a thing in Siege.

Can you remember where you've seen this? Would be curious.
---
&gt;Only serversided barraicades and corpses I see your point, but as soon as these two are fixed, there will be people who will cry because breachable walls and floors aren't.
---
Yeah, should it ever change it may take a long time.
---
Have you not watched mozzies video lol this is exactly mozzie. The spiders web is the circle around the drone, you can shoot the drones to capture them but if you miss the shot the spider drone is on the ground and will stay there and pick up drones or you can pick it back up.
---
That's 100% fair. The gun was OP af. 
---
Pls u/UbiNoty Kenobi you are our only hope!
---
I'm saving you to favorites ;) In my comment on the thread I put a link to a youtube video I made with several other angles on Coastline you might want to check out :)
---
That wouldn’t work because the animation would be way too short.
---
This game was never about any real representation of any special forces. My brother in law served in the SASR, and he can confirm, there was never any women in SASR, so theres that.
---
Fuckxuse fuck, fuck fuck fuck?
---
Let him turn around as much as he wants so he can stop fuckin around with the turret becaus he put it a few inches too far left or right
---
Simplistic, basics all covered, cute spooder boi. 10/10 {-}7
---
I hate 3 armors generally having a bigger figure, 3 speeds are all ready better, don't need another disadvantage.
---
because the majority of players are casual players and dont understand caveria shouldnt be banned 
---
Side note is that I'm kinda bummed that the gadgets are getting less and less realistic. All of the original ops are very realistic, maybe excluding doc depending on how you feel about health bars.
---
Hibana is the first one that kinda irks me but I could buy Japan making stuff look Sci fi for the sake of it. Jackal is a stretch at best. Vigil is just no, and after that it goes downhill pretty fast. Nanobots? Star Trek sensor drones? Laser cameras and holograms? How tf do all of these compare with "car battery" and "sledgehammer"?
---
/rant
---
It's my pet peeve when "modern warfare" slowly becomes Sci fi. I don't mind science fiction elements but you have to have to maintain standards for realism or it just breaks my immersion

"On November 13th 2016, Alexsandr Senaviev was declared clinically dead for two minutes on the field. While he recovered at the Hereford Base, his mounted RP-46 Degtyaryov Machine Gun was inspected. Having been decommissioned in the 1960s, the RP-46 Degtyaryov was one of the last machine guns manufactured by the Soviet Union. Aware of the Operator’s preference for such antique pieces, Six asked for the weapon to be upgraded to meet safety measures. The team of engineers led by Elena “Mira” Alvarez Del Manzano added a ballistic shield that protects the head from frontal shots. This shield can be destroyed separately from the rest of the turret. Mira was also tasked with adding a light customization on the Mounted LMG as a personal touch for Tachanka. "

Here is a picture that went with that post  [https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-GB/game/rainbow6/siege/R6\_redcrow\_reinforcements\_drawings\_tatchanka\_278028.jpg](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-GB/game/rainbow6/siege/R6_redcrow_reinforcements_drawings_tatchanka_278028.jpg)

Other source is Wikipedia. Operation Red Crow. Tachanka and Mira. Tachanka's has an entry that states this exact message about him banning the ACOG on SMG-11. Mira's states that she created Tachanka's turret shield..

Hmmmm...
---
I low key want that chanka head gear
---
The prismas are in ads position so ADS when you try this again
---
yea high copper elo /s love watching you play man keep up the good work, and he pretty much only plays plats and diamonds.
---
No there's not. The way op worded the title i assumed a lod issue somehow caused by the scope made it possible for him to actually see through walls.
---
No he got downvoted for "bragging" and being a cunt. I actually doubt if he can lift like that. But then again I weigh 100lbs and can deadlift 1000lbs. 
---
I assume he branched the nice and people didn't like it.

Yes

Virgin IQ vs. Chad Gridlock
---
What?
---
Body mass index. It's the ratio of fat to muscle in percent form for your height. Ex: let's say a 5'6" person should have a 20% BMI that means about 20% of the person's weight should be from fat 80% is everything else. Over that and your considered overweight. 
---
In the CGI trailer was a pic of Castle without helmet and half mask so MAYBE we cane expect him in this year,like maybe Season 2. 
---
Then,we could get Caveira or capitao,ops who got their face reworked too. Just maybe. Or they finish JTF2 with Buck so we have our 2 first dlc CTUs finished. 
---
IQ hanged herself cuz of gridlock
---
But also gridlock is just FAT, she has those curves but I dont mean fat as in she has wrinkles, shes just like CURVY AS FUCK
---
At what point is he mocking it?
---
And people yell at me, and kick me, for picking montagne.
---
on ur ass “a really big fucking hole coming right up”
---
800 + 2400 = 3200
---
Elite Standard Price 1800 x 2 = 3600
---
Elite with Year Pass 1620 x 2 = 3240
---
This is fucking amazing I want it now 
---
Yeah like people who can't shoot a gun aren't allowed to criticize gunplay in video games? What a dumb argument
---
haha the people saying shes "fit" because she can "lift heavy are fucking stupid and have no knowledge on powerlifting   
---
fyi, none of the squat world record holder for women (equipped or unequipped) were as heavy as she was. this is absolute BULLSHIT made by morons who have no physical education or training themselves, and do any and all the mental gymnastics they can to justify being obese.  
---
man and women alike can be very powerful while being a low bodyfat, especially when it comes to very demanding jobs such as special forces, where your job is mostly standing in severe heat in full gear for hours at a time  
---
so what can we deduct from this nonsense?  
---
1. ubisoft is trying to appeal to a new market by adding fat women to siege (((this doesnt work; see battlefield 5 and how well that game was received and sold)))  
---
2. ignorant people will buy this nonsense, thinking fat people are automatically strong when thats fucking bullshit. yeah, the strongest person on the planet is 430 pounds,but thats a man who TRIPLES THE WOMEN SQUAT WORLD RECORD  
---
3. you people justifying this crap need formal education on physical fitness, if you like these type of games you'd like bodybuilding and power lifting anyway. they're very similar because they're both huge grinds. educate yourself before you start justifying being obese, it isnt healthy and the matter of fact is even the strongest men and women on this planet will DIE EARLY because of their OBESITY. eddie hall wont live to be 65
---
Can confirm.

With the fixed consistency, it is even more possible.

You openly post a public question on reddit then complain when people say it doesnt fuckin matter? If its that important to where you make a reddit and try and sift through everyone telling you it doesnt matter just to find an answer to a dumb wuestion then maybe you should think about getting a hobby

Already posted in r/rainbow6tts that this is unintentional and will be reverted.

What is the tower secret room?
---
No, she’s an ABSOLUTE UNIT

No, they can change the view a little bit. It just acts like when you view someone else’s drone on attack.

a lot of ops get facial reconstruction in preparation for their elite skin, thats why

not all, but some

Is it a real Vityaz? Or a heavily missed weapon?

You can hear that fatty coming even without the truck

I think they are doing something like Star craft 2 has/had. E.g you got top diamond (masters/grandmasters) and then you got literally top 500 players 
---
It is indeed my opinion, making fun of people by how they look like? thats just pathetic, show some respect.

It's only 15 bucks to fix it

TTS is live since yesterday , mate
---
game's unplayable, absolutely the worst season yet. 
---
Oh yeah, if this game already has women then you definitely couldn't argue about immersion and realism being important to the game.
---
You're unhealthy both in mind and body. You need to change your lifestyle my friend.
---
We weren’t expecting the special forces 
---
As a Siege player since 2015, this makes me sad. You’ve been a great asset to the community these 3 years. But I’m very happy for you as a person that you’re moving onto exciting new things. Good luck!
---
they need to replace it with another animation instead of removing it completely.
---
They’d fail endurance and cardio tests. Go look at triathletes or iron man competitors - that’s the typical build of a special forces member. Go look at any photos of real life special forces operators, they aren’t thicc or huge or any of that nonsense. They are lean. 
---
Go look at say, the Rangers. Airdropped in and expected to run 8 miles to some objective. Or the SEALs, who have to swim. Or anything. They’re geared towards enough strength to not be weak noodles but not to override their cardio and endurance needs. 
---
The Aussie op would not pass a endurance test that a real special forces unit would employ. 
---
Like and comment!
---
They added this a long time ago. And that wouldn't really affect anything. It's not technical barriers as Epic Games released to software to do it for free it's that Ubi doesn't want to. They would loose too much money because people wouldn't have to buy a new copy of the game to play with a friend on a different platform. Fortnite was able to do it because it's free to play so they didn't loose any money. And Sony also won't allow it because they don't want their players to be able to at with Xbox. The only reason they did it for Fortnite was because of how big it was.
---
I honestly expected him to have more hairs on top of his head.

lol u dick

She's 225 pounds and 5'8.

That's considered obese.

I appreciate the opinion. Don’t take everything seriously, however. It’s simply a joke. The character and Dina from Superstore look similar to me, so I thought this would be fitting.

---
Bro, chill, it's a meme.
---
Also people have different opinions :)
---
The only diference from his idea is last quote: he can make from att claymores imoact grenades.
---
those two compare very badly
---
world class lifters/bodybuilders are in top shape. someone can be muscular and still have a decent amount of fat
---
in the second picture u/joelblaze linked she is clearly muscular and not all that fat (still a bit overweight tho probably)
---
I do agree tho that spec ops probably shouldnt be overweight
---
Is everyone forgetting they mentioned mid-season events throughout the year? this is likely one of those.
---
i was gonna upvote but you then commented this
---
idk fam Iam just that good I guess /s
---
Is Kaid too old for his unit?
---
Nobody is 58 years old in a special forces unit. I mean, if we are discussing realism as a possible "immersion breaking" issue.
---
That's a no from me, man. You killing me purely because you have better aim and reactions won't help shit.
---
I understand the fuel thing but this is just stupid
---
Hahaha you made a lord funny comedian meme
---
Thanks dude
---
I kind of like it.
---
If you want to but, but the same time I'd think they'd still allow a no cross platform ability if you so choose. Much like fortnite has. 
---
Fuze's shield is one of the least picked weapons in the game lmao.
---
Think the art team had a little to much fun with these...
---
Right now, all objectives need 10 reinforcements. Most use 8, leave two soft for Mira, and use 2 elsewhere....and that's it.
---
You'd use that dude, with no specific anti attacker utility, over another dude from a stack of Mira, maestro/echo, bandit/kaid, smoke, Jäger? Nice joke.
---
Getting an extra reinforcement, and an unnecessary amount of ammo given you rarely ever use up all, at the cost of valuable anti attacker utility is basically begging for a disaster.
---
Same goes for attack. I don't need an extra impact grenade on my zofia replacing a Capitão's fire and smoke. And vice versa.
---
Look at the top right, its your connection 
---
Seek out? Lmao i was browsing reddit, saw this post, was like "wow what a dumbass lol" and posted a comment all within about 30 seconds. Not exactly seeking out. And for you to apparently need to be satisfied only by knowing the sexuality of a fake digital character thats pretty fuckin dumb lmao
---
Can't handle a little bit of "tone" and you can't see how something might be unnafordable for someone. I'm cracking up over here. Have a good one dude. 😂

Hello egorf38,

I hear G2 were actually just some free weekenders and ended up in Montreal some how.
---
Damn that's some killer art dude
---
It's an archaic ratio to determine if you are a healthy weight for your height. Those are the only two factors in it though. Hence why it's pretty questionable. Lean and tall people can fall in the underweight category while well built short people can be classed as over weight.
---
Body fat % and body composition tests are more thorough and provide a better result of how healthy you actually are. 
---
Welcome to the world of programming

Damn, your heartfelt message about Cav makes me want to cry.
---
He could be sitting down, arching the alligator clips together like he did in his video.  
---
Idk tbh I'm trying to ignore her butt 
---
I agree. I think people just like to whine about the larger maps like theme park and villa. The top floor of Hereford is defender sided but the rest of the sites are good. I don't get the size complaint. Especially when you play bomb only, the sizing makes sense. 
---
Tbh this change was done on the notoriously worse weapon of the two he has (I kind of think the M249 is worse on Gridlock as we, but it's far closer in that case) so it's not like it's gonna change much... 
---
And I pointed out how dumb of an "observation" that is. How fucking ironic you're this dense..

Lmao what a pussy

Its junk science from 1800's developed by a mathematician that is based on nothing.  You know who else has a BMI of 32-33? The avg linebacker in the NFL.
---
I have a BMI of 29. I have a six pack (well 4 pack right now lol) and run marathons.
---
Why would you be talking about whether her physique is conducive to strong and ignore her physique?  
---
my thing is Ok there are OP team comps like lion dok, blitz, jack, and ying i get that. but honestly just stop moving, he’s been nerfed to just 2 charges, who only in the right hands get used correctly. i think these changes reflect higher level gameplay and troll comps. like literally everyone has a counter. don’t move for like the 2 seconds , get ready for a rush, but to nerf anymore just seems a bit much
---
Lol idk if you know this but one of the things that the military protects is freedom of speech, he stated his opinion and then I disagreed and stated mine. I also love the people who get big mad and can only use the classic “mom’s basement and cheetos” insult. No one ever said anybody’s military service was not appreciated, I just believe that there is more important things for a veteran to be getting seemingly very very upset about. You tried really hard tho thanks for taking the time to try to roast me. Typed this on my 10 minute break at work btw ;)

I'll have to double-check later, but there's enough wiggle room to stay out of your sight I believe. I remember defusing in that spot.

But aren’t you the one who’s easily offended and triggered by this? It’s just a video game, it’s really not that serious.

Hey just wanted to say this is the very first thread that I've read with 0 toxicity against female. I'm not a Feminist but tbh there were similar posts regarding this issue on fb and all everyone said was that the girl can not take a joke or she shouldn't be playing if she can't handle toxicity. Glad people do recognise and sympathise with us :) although it's no more a thing for me to worry anymore,nor do I care, there were days when I did face these. Thanks for pointing this issue out :)

A buff and nerf are small changes to the ops that overall doesn't change them much. A rework usually drastically changes how an op gadget works.

Looks like I struck a nerve. Keep replying back and telling me how much you don’t care.

I will let Tachanka do what Tachanka pleases, but fuck no on the others.

Let's not be hyperbolic. We've been nitpicking the characters and cosmetic designs for years. And while it is fun to get a list together of things that aren't realistic, at the end of the day it's just some fun food for thought. Ubi's consistently taken real-life inspirations and twisted them in their own aesthetic vision. It's just their style for this game. And arguably it works, that's why we have such iconic designs and why a lot of us get hyped over stuff like that Mute and Dokk trailer a few days ago.
---
Calling for everything to make sense or be realistic is a slippery slope. Let's not turn into a Battlefield subreddit, my dudes.

---
It a bug, the community developers on r/rainbow6tts know and they say it will be fixed in the next tts patch.
---
In 3 weeks from yesterday. From now on the operation will come to the live servers 3 weeks after they come out for the TTS
---
It’s a game. You wouldn’t get super skinny but phat ass female ops with green hair either, but nobody seems to complain about them. None of them really look like they belong, except possibly Valkyrie. And Gridlock’s backstory is hardly ‘woke/smash the patriarchy.’ She worked on a farm and joined up. I doubt anyone actually sacrificing their lives for the military are crying about how a bigger chick being dded to a game has invalidated their service. 
---
This might be a dumb question but H

how do people have her? I got the Y4 pass but haven't had anything come up yet

Looks like she's about to hit you with the hardest "boii" of the century

They should lower the amount of xp you get in newcomer to avoid the smurf squads
---
Does it honestly matter? It's a outlet. Doesnt add nothing to the game.
---
If you’re referring to the guy in the picture, he’d definitely crush the test. This is a picture of him competing. When he’s not competing he leans down. His cardio workout are next level.
---
Oh no its gonna be the whole “change this gas to fuel” thing again lol
---
I have no idea, I will look into that today and try to test it on tts. Also see how it is compared to the live server. I was just talking about I like how I can still visually see I’m leaning back and forth some what fast.
---
From what I heard they are implementing the pick/ban next season. 
---
I don’t know if they will do it like SI was fully set up where you have so many rounds defending and so many rounds attacking. (I hope they implement that too.)
---
I was just ready for the pick/ban again, figured they would implement it season 1.

If you gave him time to prepare for it like other guys got to, he’d crush it like he does everything else. The man is a physical specimen and when he’s leaned down, he looks unreal.

The tats are a little clip-arty but overall I like the gritty look.

Yep.

5 armor for each leg right?

Yeah, well see if that stops me!

Rainbow Six 3 was the last R6 game...You actually had to use your brain and plan out the mission with a team that consisted more than 3 other people.

Smurfs buy the game when it's on sale for really cheap.

Since she came out

Thats dresser one is fye, Thanks OP

Man, I thought that was so great and i was going to get so many orange arrows, but no you had to do it first. gg
---
They only have that outlet model in the game. Every single map has that outlet no matter the map location
---
What’s the best?
---
Implying that a 50 year old with extremely specialized training and decades of experience would be less useful than someone who is literally obese and would probably be experiencing some health problems from it at that age (realistically), with slightly less experience.
---
You mean only on console.
---
Maverick has such an incredibly huge impact you can’t just say *sHoOt HiM*

I'm sure he could pass the physical tests, unfortunately nearly every military has an age limit.

Kaid is 100% absolutely not realistic. I guess some things are easier to overlook when they are a guy.

I do believe the gun says .45 ACP on the side.  Not that gun inscriptions have always been right in this game.
---
Personally I find that she looked human with old face (and also more beautiful even if this is not the main point) and also I'm used to it and I don't really like her new one .so yeah I think that my opinion is not so popular but I don't really find this change like an improvement and finally I don't really understand why they want to change some faces. 
---
Literally unplayable. 
---
Finka still looks like shes 50 years old. Please buff her face, ubi. She is fine at her bio page
---
I never said that

what the hell is that

we want more "serious" and military skins, not pink ones.

Thats it, im uninstalling this broken ass game

Between adding an obese operator, some of the newer Elite skins, and now this I am not liking the way the art/style direction is going in this game. I don't really have an issue with "fun" skins but I'd prefer to see them isolated to weapons or as charms. I would like this game to keep some semblance of realism particularly with the aesthetics. I doubt I am in the minority feeling this way too.
---
Hmmm malignant my tumor is

Classic doc main what a nice guy

I think it was just a bug.

This bug came with the MMR bug

And it happens every season as well.

I joined the game in February 2016, I never paid for it, my local GameStop was offering free used copies to anyone buying a pre-owned PS4 because so many were coming back , at best I figured I'd play t-hunt, 1600 hrs later its my most played game ever
---
Only if it was airsoft 
---
Damn, I didn't know that.
---
I'd be light weight salty about that one
---
It's coming back next season... It's in the patch notes.
---
Fixed – Missing promote/demote animation in the result screen at the end of Ranked matches.
---
I don't know what you are talking about 
---
Smash the lid and the stuff inside of the box on the side table in bird room and then drive your drone into it and jump into the books inside the drone only box and you'll reveal a vent that goes to the locked maintenance room under the nearby stairs that has several Easter eggs.
---
Airsoft.
---
Oh hell no. That is awful
---
Yeah, there were at least 30 people that thought of this before it was announced. You are not special.
---
Because most every other gun actually kills in 3 shots, heaven forbid she get a down with 2 to 3 from her pistol.
---
If you cant kill her before hand with your full auto assault rifle from down the hall before hand... you deserve to go down.
---
Those and a shopping mall would be so much fun
---
The best counter for hard run-outs
---
Ubisoft have to do these things because of people like you.
---
What? 
---
none of that is true.
---
The issue with the current system is that every player has one free TK.
---
The reverse damage system still allows for one free TK.
---
This solves effectively nothing.
---
She's ugly as hell yeah, but you people claiming that she's fat probably never saw actual physically strong people. Not your metrosexual "bodybuilders" pussies from the gym, no. I'm talking bout professional heavy powerlifters or heavyweight mma guys like Fedor Emelianenko or The Mountain from game of thrones - the type of people who can snap a bears head with their bare hands. Hell I would went to hell and back with Gridlock.

Damn I miss the days of siege when it was mostly realistic... now all of this futuristic tech is spoiling the game for me.
---
So? In this case his fate would have been just the same with the new system. I'm telling you people, don't expect any changes to toxicity with this effort. 
---
As an Australian, I don't even want Aussie operators anymore. This is embarrassing. 
---
Is there a lore reasoning for why you're so mad lol
---
Calm down
---
Evil eye
---
I mean to be fair we have five British operators and none of them look like they carry permits for their weapons so I think cultural accuracy wasn’t even considered in this game
---
Because Australia doesn't exist
---
His current state is fucking stupid
---
This is not about **me**, Im not toxic, I know when to revive and when not to, this is about this garbage toxic community that already values individuality and griefing over everything else. They arent changing chat and tk because diamonds suffer, thats for the bigger playerbase 
---
I bet op drives a bagged civic that says no fat chicks.  
---
That being said, she does look like a cow in game...
---
And she's based on female power lifters, seriously just Google that and it's obvious.

Sure they fudged the numbers, but I find it funny that it's a game where a guy shoots magic juice that heals all wounds but when a character is thicker than usual, that's when you neckbeards pull out the calculators.

For what i understand, after the mass shootings they had a national gun ban and everyone had to hand in every single gun they had, the only people aloud guns are like, people with land or if you're in a gun club or within an enforcement. not sure though

I can see you used Walteriffics helmet design as a template for the gas mask :)

Literally unplaggable

do you see the waists, compared to what we have in gridlock. Just stop. 
---
Hey if you're improving that's great. I think you did pretty well for a 3K like that!
---
You spelled it right
---
Gridlock DUMMY THICC
---
Sure do! Which ones you got?
---
And that's how siege works
---
Kinda disappointing but It looks cool with the rust, should be epic tho.
---
Post link?
---
But why? are they fixing her ingame model too because that was the issue
---
That’s not an argument bud.
---
What does it mean they have access to all natural operators?
---
She is like "did I really had to be born this early into the game? Imagine that I was born now, my gadget could have been some bots that could attack on to the nearest enemy and give them burning damage and make them scream to reveal their locations as well as destroying walls... Curse you unjust ubisoft!
---
Well we will who is being paranoid in the next season and for the record it's 2 free TKs not 1 
---
Look at the battlefield franchise, look at the CoD franchise they both represent historical, important wars as run around shoot em ups with diversity and next to no historical accuracy and people encourage it because in the end like rainbow it’s not a serious tactical game. Rainbow does have some tactical elements but it has branched out to accommodate a larger audience so they can make more money, and at the end of the day that’s the ONLY thing they care about. If you want realism and tactical go check out squad or arma or wait for ready or not but this game is not what it started out as.
---
I believe he’d crush it. Before he became a strongman, he was a national level swimmer and as recently as December of 2018, he’s still a fairly excellent swimmer. I don’t know how well that translates to running, but from what I understand swimming is great training for cardio. Add that to the fact the he does boxing for cardio training. He reminds me of the Brock Lesnar type. Just an all around great athlete.
---
It tends to be relaxing and doing what you like.
---
So what I'm getting is that everyone wanted an australian op that took drones? Didn't we get another post about the same thing?
---
It started out perfect
---
Looks great! I'd buy that.
---
Why are we getting so mad about something being wrong in a fictional setting?
---
I know, I am sad too.

What the fuck are they doing with the game

Ah, to be young and foolish.

u/Its_Epi tell 'em about Skull Rain and Favelas

---
Its okay if you don't see the larger picture.
---
Yeah, an epic would be a much better rarity for it
---
If you think aswell it adds a new level of toxic, imagine accidentally team killing someone, and then having that person to just wait and follow you, wait until you shoot and make you kill yourself, and this can be done every round, without a punishment on the other person, who's been toxic in more ways now, now he's not playing because he's just following you to troll, and he's actively try to make you die in one way or another. 
---
I had a kid a week or so ago, who went to reinforce between sites, I asked him on mic not to, he didn't stop, he didn't stop, I shot him in the leg once, he stopped, and i healed him back up as i was doc, asked him to reinforce a different wall, he then typed in chat stfu noob, and then followed me around the map the entire round shooting his gun every few seconds, there's is so many ways to be toxic and I astounds me how far people are willing to go. 
---
Thanks to the toxic ass who blew a hatch out from under me, because I was in "his spot" and ended up dropping me behind 3 of the enemy team and got me a 3k shout out to that guy 
---
Amen
---
Were you drunk when you typed this out?
---
Not offended, I literally only have a few hours played so I'm not really fussed what happens, so long as the game doesn't just go to complete shit in the hopes that I can play in the future. I was just explaining that it's stupid to make an addition that's almost completely unrealistic in a game where there's at least some level of realism.
---
There's no point in including real military forces if you're gonna add obese operators  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ May as well add dwarves, anorexic people, and people with MND that use futuristic tech to get around and fight, just to please a small percentage of players.
---
Here we go...
---
No it isn't, its 1. You get 1 TK with no penalty, the second time you TK you are kicked. The second TK isn't free.
---
And that's why TK trolls usually only do it once per match, using squads to do it multiple times  match with no penalty. 
---
The reverse damage system does not resolve the issue caused by having one free TK, because it still offers 1 free TK.
---
BET
---
Just based off the title, they are doing stuff about TKing. 
---
They just announced it.
---
I’m so confused right now
---
I like it. 
---
Although, my elite budget is already spent on Hibaena. 
---
Rainmeter lets you add custom widgets to your desktop and wallpaper engine lets you have moving wallpapers. Wallpaper engine is 3-4 dollars IIRC and rainmeter is free
---
You gotta know that this idea may already have been in the works for a while before that post was even made. 
---
The Road To Six Invitational. It's over now anyway.
---
Doesn't matter woman or man, so far the only fat operator is a woman, I'd have the same complaint with a fat male operator too. And we don't have any that are as obese as Gridlock and in their thirties. 
---
If this was Overwatch, Quake, Fortnight I couldn't care less, but since the game is trying to be somewhat realistic, clearly out of shape people should not be in the game. Gadgets are gadgets and yes they are futuristic, but 50 years ago, an android tablet was science-fiction, yet fat people still weren't in special forces units or in normal military units, because of obvious reasons. 
---
Im sorry but I cant get excited for recolors. They are boring and lazy.
---
Lol I saw your argument with that dude, I wanted to give you a chance to properly respond
---
Correct. We had a mass shooting. 1 mass shooting. Banned the guns. Haven't had one since. 
---
Kinda funny how that works.

I say mute because doc has an acog and not mute, and echo has 2 invisible drones plus a acog
---
Honestly the issue is so easy to fix it's not even funny.
---
Just buff his damage back to a one shot kill(something like 115 where he can one shot 1 and maybe 2 armors but not 3 armors or 2 armors that have rook armor) but remove the thermal scope, decrease fire rate, and give some more recoil.  It's really not that fucking hard,  I don't see the issue here...

People want ubi to give credit.  Not saying its right or wrong.

it actually doesnt work for most people, if you read any medical lit. it classifies people on average 3 points above what the 'real number' should be. Thats about 25-30ish pounds overweight for the calculation, for people that are considered in the 'center' portion of the current BMI curve.

Bartlett was removed from multiplayer more than a year ago but is still available in Terrorist Hunt and in Custom Games.

Tbf Lesion and Blitz's legs are super exposed (cargo shorts and jeans respectively) so it makes sense they're not 3 armor
---
Nah it was certain calibres and you can still own guns you just need either a hunting or gun license afaik
---
I dislike shields immensely in their current implementation.
---
Also, Blitz is pretty much irredeemable as an operator idea. A fragger shield op makes no sense.
---
Not really since you can still play Ash with acog.
---
Thats what you think 
---
Huh
---
European power plug ftw
---
No, and they haven´t said why. I hope they have a very good reason, but seeing how they implemented Road2SI I can´t think of one.

It's a cubemap, a basic rendering technique used on pretty much all games since at least Half Life 1.

I have a hard time anyone with serious time on this game haven't already see this countless time while playing around with a drone in prep phase.

Hello x3slay, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/asflhb/andrew_astor/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I've never been Copper, but as a Diamond maybe I can give you some pointers.
---
Biggest thing for winning in Rainbow? A team who communicates and has complete map knowledge. Know your callouts, know your angles. For every OBJ in the game have 2-3 pushes. Watch pro league and you'll notice the extensive droning.
---
Next is gunskill. Even with the best teams, sometimes you have to clutch up. When it comes to that, it's all about aggression and confidence. Every time I'm in a bad situation, say like 1v3, I immediately push to get one or two kills. Only way to get better at this is to practice and find the right sensitivity for you. Know when to go for a clean headshot, know when bodies are better. 
---
Decision-making and shotcalling is also huge. Every team needs someone to organize pushes and establish contingencies, but only one. If you don't have one, become that. Organization on a push can help you beat a better team. Someone who can make decisions on the fly is hugely important. 
---
Know when to stop. If you find yourself starting a game thinking you'll lose, you will. Tilt happens. Just take a break. 
---
Hope that helps
---
He’s so short omg
---
You're right
---
Which is weird cause our outlets are 230V and US ones are 120V and you need a converter so your shit doesnt blow up when you plug it in down here.
---
i get that a lot.
---
i also wear US mens size 16/16.5 shoes
---
It's might be a dangerous trip for my drone tho
---
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
---
hm...not gay but that chanka be lookin extra fine
---
I kinda want dutch operators but it'd probably be so corny.
---
It looks so sad on the map though. surrounded by red.
---
Play on multiple free weekends and you get a chance to rank up but I doubt they can really get that high in so little time, maybe with some exceptions they can. In any case, I started this comment chain as a j o k e.
---
Yep, unlike changing operators into skeleton, which totally fits this game.
---
I will never understand why Ubi removes small little features like this such as the animation of ranking up or down
---
His exact place of birth is not detailed in his Bio, though we get some clues.
---
**"Chul Kyung Hwa does not remember much of his childhood, only that his family was escaping across Asia."**
---
*whistleblowing on UBI*
---
IMO it would look better with hair. I'm super happy Ubi finally did a Bandit elite but it's not really to my taste in its current state.
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.. 
---
I even have Fuze elite)
---
The rest of the majority of the  world uses a different outlet to the US version
---
What other countries would you like to see?
---
🎵Oooooooooo no body gives a shit🎵

Exactly! IMO her gadget should cover a smaller area and be just 2 units to deploy, for balance she could be buffed to 2 speed.

This is why Ubisoft is the worst dev team ever they can’t make a game. This is game breaking
---
The new map outback
---
As others have said, they'll never touch a school map.
---
A hospital could be good but might be tricky to make different areas feel distinct enough. Good compromise might be something with a medical wing like a rehab retreat or a psychiatric ward. 
---
Me and friends where talking about it, as they all play on console, and how it was shit I couldn't play with them, because it wouldn't be fair and we came up this, it's just about giving everyone the choice of input, then match making only based on that. Pc or console wouldn't matter it would be I'm a controller player or I'm a mouse and keyboard player. 
---
I'd love to be able to at with my console friends even if it ment I had to use a controller to que with them, even more so if you had separate mmr  for each input
---
To be fair tho, the U.S has a lot of CTUs.  They still haven't given us the Marines, Green Berets, or the Rangers, so they're probably trying to give at least 1 op from each
---
Ik 😢😢
---
I've been playing video games since 1990 and I have no idea what a cubemap is.  And I've been playing this game since launch and I certainly haven't seen anything like this.
---
Could if it was between consoles and then they could support MnK and put them with PC players. Wouldn't solve the MnK problem really but it could work. 
---
Cliiiiiive palmmmmmmer
---
Nomad was supposed to be good at such situation. Yet I rarely see her in ranked.
---
0/10 Literally unplayable.
---
To be clear, I said instakill AFTER a few traps. Which is a critical difference from the old system where it would take a handful of traps to reach the same low hp. The whole point is that the DBNO state (which is essentially a health buffer) is more important than before because it is likely worth more than the (up to) 19 health you get back, but previously was less valuable than the (up to) 49 health you could get back with a reset. People will think twice about giving up the DBNO in favor of a few more hp.

It would be like a map set in the US having a bathroom sign calling it, “The Loo” which would culturally not make any sense and would throw off American players that aren’t familiar with British terms wondering what the fuck is a loo. 
---
There is roughly 1 gun per capita here in Aust.
---
But the number is close to 0 in the suburbs. But in rural areas. Oh boy. Youll find it becomes far more common in rural areas where its use as a functional tool increases.
---
Its not a national gun ban, its just gun control. Anyone can get one if they are willing to jump through the hoops, but the hoops are there to dissuade irresponsible gun ownership.

Dont thnik thats a good idea. Either the map would be realistic and not great to play or unrealistic and then you can just take the actual map. My point is the opera isnt a good place to play at (structure wise) 
---
I'm in the realm of 5'7 and 210 and could probably still ALMOST do a pull-up or vault through a window- Gridlock is probably bigger proportionally, but she's built like a brick shithouse of beef and muscle and I'm built like a bag of marshmallow fluff, so if I can sorta do it then she can too

Five foot ten and 225 pounds is a BMI of over 32.  That is obese, medically speaking.  Obese is a technical term with an objective definition, and she falls under it.

Oh yeah without a doubt!

If it affects your stats, the scumbags will show up.

Take away that /S we need this in the game now 
---
Oh really? I expected it to be Ps4&gt;Xbox One&gt; PC.
---
PC usually has the smallest fps communities, in my experience. Mostly due to the titan that is Counterstrike.
---
Not that I don't believe you, of course!
---
Well if you don't like acog, using a 1x sights isn't a bad thing, I just like acog due to it been a dmr basically you can engage at huge distances with no hassle or guess work, and its amazing and dropping those amazing shield users and you can just destroy there hand with with acog, and yeah due to it been slug have a tighter hip fire spread doesn't really mean much, and no worries my man, I'm still quite a new player, but I've spent way too much time watching YouTube videos and proper stat break downs to help myself get good, so I like to pass on any information I know. 
---
If you like to engage at long range with a 1x sight alot also try jackal with his pdw, the pdw is a wired weapon where it actually deals more damage at long range, has the best TTK of all fully auto guns at ranage, a 50round mag, and super easy to controll recoil

So we all agree that Gridlock is a fat POG Wook? No? Just me? Ok.

If you've got Xb1x and a 4k monitor you should definitely stick to that. I very rarely have to wait more than 40 seconds to find a match

You know it. He’s fapping to those stats as we speak.

If there was one sensitivity that was best, the devs would just put it as the default

That being said, i have a long time on xbox and imo the higher the better AS LONG as you can control it. Also vertical doesnt need to be very high only horizontal.

Btw, what level are you? I play xbox and wouldnt mind another friend.

There’s no official statistic from Ubisoft, however according to one of the largest stats websites here is how many accounts they have logged for each platform: https://twitter.com/tabwire/status/1092081825403584514?s=21
---
Now of course there are a lot more players overall but I would imagine the ratio to scale up quite linearly. 
---
Another way to tell the platform demographic is from the Community challenges (for example, last weeks challenge was to get 1,000,000 headshot as a community on PC), PS4 has a higher target, and Xbox had a slightly smaller target. 
---
same here i though the same thing

I'm seeing ascetics in the art for this season to be very reminiscent of the visual style of the TellTale Games. If Ubi gobbling up those people after that studio crashed is true, then your thoughts on the Operators looking like they are from a different game are pretty valid.

I just saw a video on the changes and seeing the fire rate change to Cav’s pistol made me crease. And the Glaz rework lol

So the realistic reason Gridlock's so thick is that she's supposed to be swole as shit like Zarya, but the R6 art team couldn't figure out how to do that without it looking silly, so they just made her broad and hoped it was enough.
---
If you want, a possible _canon_ reason could be that she was promoted to Team Rainbow before she gained weight, and Six is pressuring the SASR not to kick her out because she's such a valuable asset. Otherwise, it seems in character for Mozzie to use his obligatory Team Rainbow technomancer bullshit to falsify his best friend's fitness test results and keep her employed.

Looking at these stats, does anyone else think Maverick might need a nerf? Blitz and Lion are no-brainers for reworks, but I feel like not many people talk about Maverick. 
---
As someone who anchors a lot, I find him annoying to play against and I wish he had some form of counter beyond flanking (such as bandit or kaid) and I wish his gadget would be louder and melt the reinforcement over a period of around 5 seconds with a visual indicator rather than burning through instantly. 
---
However, I’d like to know what everyone else feels about him to get a general opinion.
---
that's Cav for ya

Nerfing extremely strong operators is only good for the game.

If they only exist within the game, then their lore and design would not matter, so anything Ubi does would be fine

Hello JackalMirage, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ash7id/jackal_elite/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah I agree with the Ash changes but the Cav one imo was way too overboard, same goes to Glaz. With Glaz I think all they should do is slow the fire rate like it was before they buffed it.
---
The fire rate to her pistol is a big and they’re working on it. And the change to Glaz was unnecessary. I don’t main him but I feel the pain of all the Glaz mains. Also, I was just about to get Lion but after seeing the nerf, I might just get Dokkaebi or Jackal.
---
fatass lmao
---
I like it the change. I always thought the animations were hard to watch. Always gave a super douchy "yeah wud up" kind of vibe. 
---
I do think the unique poses for each operator was perfect
---
Teamwork makes the dream work.
---
They had one job
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** Yung_Trappist! ^(hug)
---
Hard to be social when all you want to do is fucking kill yourself.
---
Still looks better than Hibanas new face
---
Off course. But I mean in 4/5 years, is CSGO still going to be there? I think R6 has a better chance to be the future standard, like CSGO is now.
---
That must be humiliating for the twitch-guy !
---
But....  Mozzie is a defender
---
Curious, what rank are you?
---
So if the wall is electrified by bandit the grzmot won't be destroyed?
---
Nah, the old ones still look the same. The two on the right belong to newer operators- top-right is a throwable shock thing that electrifies walls/hatches, and bottom-right is a trap droid thing that ambushes drones and lets the defenders access them
---
Glaz doesn’t need to be as strong as he is in love build, it’s simply OP. 
---
Ash is not OP and her strength and viability isn’t because of her Acog.
---
The Cav nerf is a bug Ubi have addressed 
---
Agreed. I wouldn’t get Lion anymore if I were you. Jackal is definitely a better pick now as he actually puts pressure on the enemy, his rework is just like spam spotting on a drone...
---
He and Gibraltar would get along lol
---
Don't quote me on this --
---
No, codes are not separated. If you buy the "Ultimate Edition",  that will come with the base game, all current operators, and VIP access to the Year 4 operators. This means that if you redeem a "Ultimate Edition" code whilst already having the base game installed, will only grant you the above mentioned extras.
---

If they can't detect it then does that means they ban people through reporting? I was thinking of getting one for playing around with my friends in custom games and I was wondering if you can get banned for that.
---
Biggest of brains
---
Yep
---
Oh okay. I play on console so Glaz isn’t as good as it’s harder to aim but I understand he would be more powerful on PC. I really wish Ubi started balancing things like this separately for console. Ash on console is so easy to use so she’s easily the most powerful attacker here at the moment.
---
Literary unplayable
---
If people think dying to iq’s elite skin is humiliating then how would people feel about this?
---
Also, Ubisoft said that they wanted to make tac Hanks a more viable option by giving him some sort of mobility since he is weak when on his lmg but they just contradicted themselves when they make Glaz have to stop moving to see through smoke. 😕
---
Oh go to the main page thing and click the tree dots on the top right, then press change user flair. (If youre on mobile) if youre on PC I can't help you 
---
Because "tall swole mechanic lady" is a common character trope that's easy to communicate visually (so we get an idea of what kinda person Gridlock is just from looking at her), but Ubi couldn't manage to make her look buff

Sigh :(
