Moving the goal posts? the goalposts have been the same this entire time, R6 has long TTKs. Maybe 250ms seems short to you but in the grand scheme of things a quarter second is a long time.
---

---
I think you just dont want to acknowledge that R6 was designed with long TTKs so people could watch cool videos of 180 headshot flicks over having a fast TTK to encourage slow, tactical gameplay.
---
At the end of the day Ubi wanted an esport and esports have to be fun to watch. People like to see prolonged gunfights over slowly slicing corners and taking people out before they can react.
---
Ah so they're the first 2 to not have an actual badge like I previously said? I guess with year 5 we probably won't have their badges or CTU's in their bio anymore and that they'll just be on blog posts
---
That is sad. Sorry that happened to you.

I like big ~~butts~~ guns and I cannot lie

Nice! Hold that to your chest as a cool accomplishment.

But don‚Äôt try to use that to justify ideas again. Because that‚Äôs dumb.

No offense but....

About time.
---
Ela's pistol is shit, She my main on defense and I can't stand this god awful pistol unless I get a headshot. Best pistol in the game is the PMM.
---
Oh. My bad then. That‚Äôs how it should work tho
---
Yes we do, get flanked made a vid and at the beginning of the round he had like 10/20 ish bullets
---
Shotguns are pretty consistent now though. Especially if you aim down sights, it makes the spread tighter.
---
Is the pmm also your favourit or is there another you like?
---
Nice
---
is her CTU called nighthaven?
---
https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Kali
---
I think you just skimmed his head
---
That is certaibly something that baffles me. Why does it do more damage... I would respect a nerf to the damage
---
He isnt wrong though, vigil has such a nice, plain template of armor and almost all the camos look good in him
---
What the hell happened here
---
Thats what i was thinking just a moment ago
---
Looks like it is
---
wonder what she's compensating
---
That's not how DPS works. If we went by "oh only one headshot to kill" them every gun would be equal. Rather, the pistol is easy to use but the stats in it are objectively garbage. The PMM is best because it has low recoil, ultra high DPS, a super fast reload, and simple sights that are easy to pick up
---
Oh god boys I've been surrounded I'm going to have to cyka blyat my way out
---
nice
---
Oh yeah, they can look very Asian and other more middle eastern and other a mix of those, it's really cool and I think it goes along their old a diverse culture.
---
Alright thats 30 bullets thats still decent
---
Thank you! The original is already hanging in a frame :)
---
Its objectively the best in the game set aside what you've excluded. 9 round mag with a super fast reload, low recoil, high DPS, and simple sights to use. The hip fire is also very solid if you ever need Fuze shield
---
**B R I C C**
---
I was thinking due to its smallish size, you could hide it outside a doorway and use a grenade on the owner.
---
Thanks man. I'm gonna see it later.
---
they'd be a much more worthwhile purchase, meaning more people who previously were aware of what a scam they were would buy them. those who were too stupid to calculate their worth or played 24/7 anyway to make them worth it wouldn't see any change.
---
Dude eBay
---
Best girl
---
Would you rather a Pro League player who spends his life mastering a video game having more power to properly give good feedback or any Copper player just demanding anything they want changed in a game? Also I said that I don‚Äôt judge people based off of Ranks I just think players who‚Äôve play Siege since the Alpha or Beta have a bit more experience because they played the game longer and probably have more weight to what they have to say. Does a general have more say than private? Of course. Does a Queen Bee have to go get nectar from flowers no, the workers do. Everybody deserves a right to voice their opinions, but I believe that some people might have more knowledge on things than others. Nobody is better than another. It‚Äôs so hard not offending anybody these days.
---
I never have luck with eBay but I‚Äôll try it.

Thou shalt go to cams

She even has the pocket AK
---
So basically it's like CBRN Lion and Finka belong to, Maverick and Clash with UTRT (Urban Tactical response team) and Amaru with APCA?
---
If you reinforce from the other side, you see potential Maverick-Holes better from the inside of the Room. Thats the Reason.
---
But when there is a Mira in the Team and there is no communication where she places the Windows, this behavior from the Teammates is stupid

I know that it is great yet i favour the MK1 9mm

---
If he is complaining about it he shouldn‚Äôt play siege
---
Maybe, after the machine pistol nerf though it won't as reliable as a backup like the smg-12 was for dokkabei at release. I personally would actually rather the pistol over the CZ, but I also can't really use machine pistols other than the smg-11
---
it was just the last 5-6 packs I've opened/Seen opened by friends have all been Blood Orchid. Didn't know if it was a push on them or just weird chance
---
With a higher fire rate and arguably more predictable recoil and surprising okay damage drop off. I‚Äôm not saying it better, but I can see some people getting as good use with it, even if most will prefer the AUG.
---
The start was absolute potato but at the end he shot like 5 bullets right through him, absolute bs
---
I‚Äôll miss how two of them blew up on me
---
He has more of them, they recharge, and he can yeet them like a valk camera, so he can put them places jaeger can't reach. They're also smaller and harder to see.
---
you have never raged on siege? he never complained i just thought i‚Äôd share it and see what people on reddit think.

they don't have enough face models

Fuuuck man, just as soon as I started to play him more and get used to him they do this.

If you watch this frame by frame it actually looks like you missed.

I was exaggerating but you lose a lot for an abandonment than a normal loss

Kali doesnt open walls tho.
---
yes very good
---
Maybe exceptions can be made for rook armor.  But overheal shouldn‚Äôt affect it, I don‚Äôt think.
---
I think she is also helpful and allows people to use something other than twitch or thatcher as hardbreach support.
---
So 5 is maximum? Does Rook gets damaged?

My friend, I‚Äôm going to assume that you have little to no experience with other gaming communities if you really think that..

That is one exception haha, Im not much of a drone hunter with mozzie anymore cuz I used to just chase drones but the prep phase always ends and I never get to place anything down haha
---
They could make 3 hour boosters, or 6 hour boosters. So not really.

Cool XD

That is why you dont have more than one person on a mira

^ubi, take a look
---
I think it's because holding the Mira makes your player model stop moving.
---
It's already far better to just be able to walk away. If you are downed you will most likely be finished by kali (1s reload time between 2 bullets)
---
To do this I switched to a low activity server and cued with my friends at the same time. Works every time for me

If its not then we are going on strike
---
Beaulo 2.0?
---
Ah okay, that explains it then. Thank you. I really do hate that trend. The streamers figure out strats and meta before anyone else even gets to play the new shit, and then it becomes boring/they get nerfed because of it... Wish companies would stop this habit. Thanks mate!

Better for Ubi to make it as long as your game is open, since q can take a long time
---
Thank you. Adequately put into words exactly what I was thinking.
---
I would use it for IQ, but I got black ice for it
---
Ying. Maybe also make him counter glaz, by making his scope **all** bright yellow, due to the influx of light and heat?
---
nah it definitely is a bit high, and why are you shooting like 2 bullets at a time
---
Wow yea ur right
---
Couldn‚Äôt tell you but it happens.

Yeah, she was a lot better than the other host.

no game is 100 esports ready

It does say that in the October 21 patch notes, haven‚Äôt played much recently except the Halloween event so I missed that change. Hopefully it steps him up a notch but I don‚Äôt except him to be top tier from just that.
---
With these alternatives, the way to go has always been more possibilities, and different caveats of using the gadget. 
---
Hibana can open up 3 holes at a distance, but they are small, easier to bandit trick, and you can only make 1 viable entrance (because crawling into an objective site is suicide), while Thermite can open up two big fucking holes for an easy to use entrance, but actually deploying the gadget is slower and sometimes risky when doing so indoors.
---
Another comparison are our soft breachers: Sledge and Buck, and Ash and Zofia. Sledge can use his hammer 25 times, which lets him destroy a larger area. Buck can also shoot his shotgun 25 times, but to make an effective entrance you usually need to shoot 2 or 3 times, and his gun is way harder to control.
---
And now, J√§ger and Wamai. J√§ger's ADS are slower to deploy than the magnets, but he can deploy all of his utility during prep phase while Wamai has to slowly set his gadget one at a time, which means that an early death for him also denies a lot of utility for the rest of the defenders. But to balance that his magnet can now allow him to use the attacker's grenades for his benefit.
---
Kali has a stupidly strong weapon (in the right hands), and her gadget combines Thatcher's anti-anti-breaching with Ash/Zofia's capacity to also clear mechanical gadgets (barbed wire, shields, frost mats). When using Ash and Zofia I usually only break one wall with their gadget, and break more gadgets with the second shot, Kali can do the same: help Thermite breach the wall (with more difficult timings) and use the rest of her shots to clear whatever is inside the site.
---
Open Sesame
---
Yeah
---
now you can finally save the AWP
---
You know this comment still exists right?

Also did you really reply to people like this twice??

I don‚Äôt know how, but that gun just went

I wanna say it's fake but it's too beautiful to say such insolence
---
So basically her role is nothing like Glaz even though she has a sniper rifle? he's a marksman and she's a sniper.
---
They said they didn't want Kali holding angles and being aggresive like Glaz this morning so they don't want her as a solo operator.

This is fucking ridiculous

NOT MY BABY
---
I mean it‚Äôs not wrong
---
This looks more like COD.
---
Literally no idea why they would make an actual sniper with a bolt-action rifle that engages in close-quarters and downs everybody with one torso shot, when they had Glaz as the original sniper. Oh well, i wonder who he will become in Y5.
---
Yeah, they look similar, and ones morbidly obese

Internet on?

Nah it‚Äôs cool, I don‚Äôt really care about upvotes
---
Lmao it means your clicks per second, like how many times u can click your button in a second
---
that would be horrible 
---
the acog (the model is supposed to be a x4) is simply a x2.5 (also like the .44 auto)
---
even a real x4 would be horrible in game because siege is cqc
---
and videos shows it's clearly just another x2.5
---
^^^ididn'tknowbetter,sorry

Starter edition is no longer a thing, everybody has to pay the same amount of renown for ops.

I get a little motion sick reinforcing a wall every now and then, but not the same thing I presume?

I thought they scrapped battle pass
---
asking the real question here
---
Jaimini Kalimohan Shah. Not necessarily she got the name after she started to wield a sniper. Its just a characteristics of Kali she have may be.
---
it's referring to her gun as well I believe, Doesn't it mean beauty too?
---
What does Wamai mean?
---
but hes watching in heaven
---
You can do it to Yings canisters

Hopefully glaz will get a rework like tachanks

If it would‚Äôve made them more money they‚Äôd have already done it

Jason statham is sledge???
---
My bad for being so toxic bro, I was having an argument with someone so I was already in a bad mood, I stand corrected. Once again, sorry man, the shroud that someone had at the PE booth was made by some machining shop for the MG100 so that would explain it.

How about the revert the nerf but make it so defenders can see the scope through the smoke, forcing him to play smarter
---
What gun is that ?
---
Any Battlefish fans here? Lol
---
Oh right
---
That would then make the gadget actually a disadvantage, as you cannot melee a softwall and it breaks down. Sledge‚Äôs hammer sounds like a yes though, that would be a good idea as an alternative to thermite.

You could just change his ability into camouflaging
---
Camouflage master: Upon activation, defenders won't see him clearly if he's in dark areas (Trees)
---
Huh, maybe make like a thingy like when you are a defender and wnats to open a door, that you have to press and hold f, then you'd be vulnerable
---
Is this all you have to do to get upvotes? Just put the overrated goose in your post and BOOM upvotes for everyone...
---
If anything if solo people matchmaking together into one game it would make it easier because they are only filling one slot whereas a bigger team has limited options in terms of matches. Destiny 2 for example does it perfectly.
---
That‚Äôs amazing, good job!

Have you considered that sometimes it isn't your aim, it's what server you get connected to?  I've had nights where only about half my shots register.

LOL, RIGHT???

I agree, but they definitely would have to change the amount if time they last.

I just feel like most of the time you worked for the kill and even if you get more points it if someone steals it I think itwould be more fair if you got the kill but that‚Äôs just my opinion

I guess you could, but. At this point it just sounds more complicated than it needs to be...

I think you misunderstood my post. There should be a separate mode that is only for players that solo queue. There are 0 parties of 2 or higher matchmaking into your game. The normal ranked game does solo and multiple but this mode would only do solo.

Does that mean we can finally get an acog on Wardens MPX and N√∏kks FMG-9?

Find a 5th or play with 3, I hate getting pulled into a 4 stack they don't talk or share any info other than to their pre-made group (other than rare occurrences). Can still go play unranked or casual if playing with your buddies is more important.
---
Indian server please...

Yes that I understand but all the solo players will go into this different mode and 4 stacks won‚Äôt be able to find a game because there‚Äôs no solo player to fill the last place.

I‚Äôve spotted the copper who doesn‚Äôt know how to check for spawn peeks with his drone. This game isn‚Äôt gonna hold your hand just cause you‚Äôre bad at it. If you‚Äôre dieting to spawnpeeks learn to counter them it‚Äôs the defender who‚Äôs at the disadvantage when spawn killing not the attacker.

every elite that was leaked was eventually brought in the game tho

That‚Äôs pretty neat but does anyone realise he will have an ACOG on his AR?

I'm just hoping this doesnt drag on longer and longer

That's really nice explanation.

What rank are you I‚Äôm genuinely curious at the average rank of people who think this is a good idea.

What rank are you I‚Äôm tryna figure out the average rank of people who reckon this is a good idea

Wait how doesn‚Äôt he have IQ‚Äôs assault rifle?

That would be great

Umm we can see just make sure your on ps4
---
Definitly not. While it might put the other guy at a disadvantage when glaz is holding tight angles the other guy could get knocked away.
---
Also the tscg doesn't need a buff.

Yup no clue considering they specifically said ops will share attachments

Okay zoomer

Wrong subreddit to post it on
---
Hello presto_-, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/duoxd3/shifting_tides/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Most people here need to realize her gun is not like AWP in CS 
---
Example: you can use the AWP as entry fragger and can hold long angles too because it has 0 ADS time
---
Kali's sniper on the other hand has a ridiculous ADS time So its not like people are gonna uploa a quickscope montage and rush in any obj room they want, its really good in holding angles but if you see most guns with an ACOG are really good for holding angles like Doc, everybody knows what happens when you peek a doc.
---
It's not that weak than an AR and there is no confirmed source that says it's only a defender AR. If ubi will keep recyceling weapons i'm sure they will use it again sometime in the future

You made my day, thank you
---
Another ACOG hate...
---
It was op cuz Jager is a defender not an attacker
---
How do you mute a ping from one person ?
---
You cant buy renown
---
You main those terrible ops saying we are clowns when you don't have a point. Glaz sucks. He can frag but not well. He is better off smoking and giving cover. It's the ONLY thing he excels at
---
What did they do ?
---
New operator is called Kali...

Sad Glaz noises

we've already seen a leaked cav elite so :P

Ok liberal
---
Thanks, love the friendliness :)
---
Suprised they didn't talk about the Battle pass.
---
Correct sir!!
---
His pick rate is very likely to fall with Waimai which isn't a issue to me. However, why would you replace him when you can run both of them at the same time. Here I'll give a ez line up - Waimai, Jeger, Bandit, Lesion, Echo.

Im only a madman who lost 20minutes writing that. Sometime I hate myself but then I do a piece of art like this
---
I don't think the skill difference is that high. Most of the people who swap region do it only because people are not able to speak English at ALL. I stopped playing siege because of Germans always throwing feces everywhere.
---
they only removed the ability to actively pick him. if all of your ops are picked/ locked then you will get recruit.
---
Maybe in some future change... for now it‚Äôs a slightly weaker defender AR.
---
Hello StoneSatsuma,
---
We still don‚Äôt have a way to view collected items in anyway, and we can‚Äôt set loadouts or favourites, I don‚Äôt think this will ever happen my friend.
---
Shockilled?
---
I would prefer Ubisoft to have properui and group items on certain aspects or types. like Chibis and rareties.
---
How?
---
'BikiniBodhi' that's a weird ass name
---
I'm embarrassed I didn't know this
---
I guess your could say they had... SuicidalTendencies.
---
it couldve easily been that long if he only worked on it an hour a day or a few hours during the weekdays only, for example.
---
well hostage is immune to fire. and if you are throwing grenades into the hostage room, its your own fault if the hostage dies.
---
Recruit rush
---
I feel like she'll get nerferd almost immediately

Don't do this on barricaded doors. Attackers who vault through will jump right over without setting them off.
---
And attackers who don't vault through doors are usually the ones careful enough to shoot your traps anyway.
---
I'd bet 20$ that only you cannot see the hole after the explosion, allowing the enemy to shoot you without you being able to see them.
---
It was so good the game took a while to register the bullets
---
They are all amazing in their own weird way
---
I can't wait aswell!
---
My siren name's brick and she is the prettiest

His old heart couldn't take it.
---
Ace not clutch. Still nice tho.
---
thank you i wasnt able to buy it but my uncle had a copy he didnt want so he said i can have it
---
SMH, you 30yr old boomers should stick to CS, Halo(I love Halo tbh), and Qauke./s
---
No raid or ads?
---
Yeah, i know and it's wrong
---
Now I wonder if the armor type of each player influences the penetration rate as well. Especially considering the bullet stopped at Rook.
---
I just think that we should get at least two reworks or a new map every quarter.
---
make it a real energy dfink you buy with a code under the tab, i would buy it for shure!
---
Thunderstruck and nothing else
---
[Literally this guy lol](https://youtu.be/TZvUlFY4-Pg)

No. 1: Look at who you're replying to.
---
No. 2: Nobody even talked about Kali being OP or strong. Learn to read properly.
---
I like it. Gives me *undercover deep in the favelas of brazil* vibes.
---
Is the tts up already? I cant start it or download it
---
They take a poll over Twitter and reddit to see if enough people are interested to have that region server. More people equals more money . Why wouldn't someone spend money on a game if he happy with it
---
this is the dumbest strat one could even think of
---
anyone with more than 1 IQ would see the mirror and gas canister intact
---
Bolt-action weapons are obsolete by today's standards. There's literally zero reason why someone would bring a bolt-action to any engagement, let alone a close quarters environment, where it's the worst possible choice.
---
Kinda what I thought
---
Any new news? Damn I'm sad I couldn't get to buy those Halloween packs.
---
Character in EFT.
---
True
---
The developer said that outbreak would never again be seen on rainbow six siege, though it would be the seed that birthed Rainbow Six Quarantine.
---
I. DONT. SEE. R G B
---
News sites say that every season. Then everybod ynotices that the game is a bit mor than just damage numbers and drop the new operators because they don't work so well.
---
Nice! Software?
---
Maybe but same thing for how thick he looks but it is a cannon lore that smoke is a professional boxer so Olympic theme works well for him, not really for sledge, who is only strong, or Mute, who is just smart
---
Yes but now 2 is the standard. Even 1 can be an extra utility. You wouldn't want him to have something that could give ubi a reason to nerf him again.
---
That‚Äôs not what I meant. In the video here they had a mashup of different armor ops (Ying, Fuze, Mozzie, Pulse, etc). I‚Äôm wondering if you lined only 3 armor ops would the penetration still be 5 ops max or would it decrease to 4 or less.
---
It‚Äôs a variable 6x 12x scope. Still pretty cool, without being fucking broken (@glaz)
---
Are you mister killerkam?
---
People didn't know?
---
Where u got that screenshot?
---
FMG just have slightly more drop off but otherwise they share the same damage output.
---
Yes shotguns
---
&lt;3
---
Or split them into 12 hours and make them cheaper. I'm only playing 6 hours out of those 24 hours ones, I sleep and do other stuff during the day.
---
It's a great 4k but I really I advice you not to play ranked in just 2 weeks
---
I am sir
---
Your a bit behind
---
Um do that for un barricaded ones but i just jumped over a low laser by vaulting through a barricade. Since nothing happend i ran back theough unsuspectingly and went boom boom
---
I smell nerf
---
maGG_need
---
It‚Äôs not about tha damage but about looks , sounds and feels man
---
I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt, and I like Glaz. I‚Äôm just saying that his pick rate is through the floor (least pick op by a country mile) and then they bring another sniper to the party. It can‚Äôt help his pick rate at the very least.
---
Cannot wait for the 90% ban rate
---
but you said 'tactics are above low gold' &lt; meaning **ranked players specifically**.
---
then you *changed* it to Pro League plays, like come bruh, either say it clearly or don't even try to change it just to *save that pride of yours*.
---
**10% pick rate**, yet the **win rate stays consistent each season** = it works fairly well.
---
what's next, you're gonna say &gt; nah, I meant Europe based region Pro League Plays and not those scrawny ass ranked players and gay ass challenger league mofos.
---
Looking at the muzzle brake, it looks to me more like a .308 Win
---
Then again, it's probably completely fictitious. Considering its capabilities, though, I feel like it should look more like a Barrett M82.
---
Can't Glaz open unreinforced hatches as well? I'm pretty sure he always could have done that. Also, I'd much rather pick an automatic rifle over a bolt-action in a 1v1 post plant situation.
---
I think it is from the new season changes video
---
Mate it's been this way for like 2 seasons almost.
---
You guys are taking this the wrong way. Kali isnt going to be a better option than glaz. It's gonna go like this: everyone plays her because its like a new toy, they realize that thatcher does the job better, glaz has smokes AND frags, and with the benefit of seeing through smoke, with a Jacked rate of fire(also you kinda HAVE to aim good with Kali) she'll be mediocre at best. You dont have any close range options other than the C7E (bad irons btw), it will die down a bit and she'll become a niche pick that'll come up when you least expect it.
---
She thicc tho
---
Seems like just a placeholder, required lvl for ranked is 25. UI was messy as fuck on LAN.
---
Smoke is a professional boxer in the Rainbow Six lore along with Mastero
---
Been for a while like this lol
---
dad crazy!!!
---
Does it mean we are supposed to gain 7 points in order to win?
---
Not nitpicking, but you said you know how to drone and then said you didn't know the Ela was there. That's ok though - was still a great vid.
---
Mmmmm no it‚Äôs not

"World class Kapkan main" eueuheuh

---
Gridlock after the gymshark sponsorship
---
No. It works like normal for point parameters. 
---
Every 3 rounds you switch from defense to offense or vice versa, resulting in a max 6 rounds, unless overtime happens badly.
---
Today they are going to test a new data center in South Africa.
---
As you said, just because the server exists, it doesn't mean the game will get it, if Ubi could get away with just one server they'd do it.
---
?
---
Well sledge is a national level rugby player. smoke is possible, but if that was to be a skin, then they wouldn't risk taking the mask off smoke since he needs it to he immune to his smokes.
---
But yes it can't be mute. So it's either sledge or smoke.
---
Before Ubi threw up rainbows and unicorns on plane, would you have thought that plane could've looked like that?
---
Yeah and if you go to community - discussions - events &amp; announcements, you can also see a shifting tides thread that just says "Failed to load the event".
---
Let me take you to a barbaric land where Gridlock is appreciated.
---
A real master has fail more times than a beginner has ever tried

Doesn't load.

Monty is still a consistent ban in plant, because he is basically an necessity for certain push strats that heavily puts the game in your favor if done right. A good Monty is still a very scary Monty even with the ads changes. He is amazing on a lot of maps, Oregon, Skyscraper, Kanal, and Bank.
---
I really can't be arsed what they do to hostage, I haven't played that mode since Skull Rain
---
she had stroke
---
It's interesting. I think some people are missing what your pointing at. Yes we currently play 6 rounds till overtime or whatever but the swap symbol seems to indicate you switch after 6 rounds instead of the current 3 rounds. If you look at the rules tab right now that part is not included so unfortunately we cannot compare.
---
That said, I do think this is some placeholder thing. It would be cool but also impossible for many people to commit to a possible 15 round match, where the max is now 9. 9 rounds can already take 40-50 minutes. add another 6 rounds and a match can last well over an hour.
---
...being lacking in CQC building assault opereations?
---
Guess they didn't find the way to keep haunted house while making it brighter and colored differently from the rest of the map  
---
What i'm actually concerned about is that Drug Lab is just Lab now, at least on a map layout

Uh, unrelated, you like blondes right?

Bro I have pulse and iq.. I love getting the counters
---
Did someone order a dad joke? Here you are: Astronomers got tired watching the moon go around the earth for 24 hours. They decided to call it a day.
---
Because Vigil can be a real pain. Good players will have their basics down, and that‚Äôs forming in Siege. Vigil makes your information less reliable. Maybe they‚Äôre a three or four stack and they have a start with Lion. It‚Äôs not a bad ban, but yeah I‚Äôd have banner Mira over Vigil
---
I record in 1080p60fps and the quality is fine (no audio or playback issues), doesn't affect my fps (if it does.. it's 1 fps)
---
Although the overlay menu is laggy and loads slow, I use keybinds to get the last 15s of gameplay
---
I did it waaaay back on chalet. Shot a guy through a barricade and I got a downed and headshot point notifications.
---
I was rook using the MP5.
---
This looks like PUBG loading screen art. and yeah, Pulse does keep changing for no reason and nobody notices.
---
But India isnt?
---
Basically yes, but if you can effectively waste the teams time you can get them to make mistakes as they feel the pressure. Though the more they expect it the less viable it becomes , but atm they do seem like a really good pick.m, especially if it just a one off round.
---
what did they do?
---
Exactly! It's unclear what we should expect.
---
It should be in the options.
---
Ah yeah havent even thought of that because of the title. In that case i hope they increased the renown gain too, im not gonna be a fan of playing twice as long for the same amount of renown.
---
6.9k upvotes nice
---
Hahahahaha. Yeah I was over it already lol. I turned to see him shooting at me, could have brrrrted his head off, but I was so ready to see him lose at that point. (Which he did shortly after).

I wonder which direction you'll face if you get shot from the floor? I can see her being used to shoot at people camping in objective from underneath them
---
Thanks, and by the way, this art is awesome :)
---
Thank you
---
 It is isn't  exactly 200 renown a minute but 200 every three or four minutes if you factor in load times, win screens and spawn selection
---
With that budget i could build a pretty good gaming pc with an amd ryzen 5 and a gtx 1660.
---
Now what does that mean ?
---
I mainly play with American friends and I‚Äôm from EU
---
Or they should just make abandon punishments much more severe
---
Can we please stop nerfing DLC operators before they are even released to the public? The entire Year 4 of Operators didn‚Äôt do anything in terms of meta performance, and that‚Äôs total BS of situation.
---
Why even need DLC ops then if they are not impacting the picks???
---
Not a bad idea at all. If necessary, they could also add a minor knockdown effect to it if you survive, similar to Nomad but nowhere near as long. Just to give Kali a chance of not getting mowed down by the MP5 mag Rook and Doc will throw your way while you cycle the bolt if they survive the shot.
---
But how do you mean? That doesn't make any sense
---
Lie
---
Coolcool
---
hey buddy, Doktor's curse ended up a few days ago.
---
O god. Right in the feels. As a glaz main this hurts.
---
No because they got rid of the laser
---
No one played Lion, it was on Villa
---
But the thing that doesn't make sense is that he is at -16 MMR without losing a single match (you can look it up on r6 tracker)
---
Thanks to them both, funny stuff
---
Learned this a year ago but after someone called me a noob for not knowing :(
---
They really slaughtered poor glaz tbh. I wish that you can still succeed in these dark times.
---
No I got a maximum of like 10K once
---
Really? I didn't know that.

The old one was so clear.

But any way u have ro watch ur steps :/

Hello Justty9, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dur6uk/person_who_have_the_most_accuracy_and_kd_rn/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
üòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ where do u guys come up with stuff like dis good one üòÇüòÇü§£
---
.... Me too, but for a different reason.
---
I hate/love how the flick on your teammate was clean and cool, but the shots on Doc were nowhere near where they needed to be.
---
Yeah i know and i like that part of the elite but i Think the outfit is kinda lame
---
Yeah, its weird that they dont have one yet, especially given that places like the UAE have the infrastructure and would also provide service to Pakistan and India. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What Ubisoft could also do is allow for a p2p option in custom games so that people from isolated regions can create their own grassroot community. Add crossplay and input based matchmaking and people will be shocked at how fast the games talent pool explodes.
---
I kinda just wish they'd finish the original 20 first, only need a few more.
---
According to the weapon‚Äôs description, the CSRX 300 is a custom built straight-pull bolt-action rifle chambered for the [.300 Winchester Magnum cartridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.300_Winchester_Magnum).
---
The design of the rifle appears to be inspired somewhat by the [Accuracy International Arctic Warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_International_Arctic_Warfare).
---
One variant of the AW, called the [AXMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_International_Arctic_Warfare#AXMC), has the option to be chambered for .300 Win Mag and has a 5-round magazine just like the CSRX 300.
---
The only thing though is that the AW rifles don‚Äôt have straight pull bolts, though I suppose that could be one of its many custom built parts.
---
Both, the original AW and the AXMC variant, are what I believe to be at least part of the inspirations for the CSRX 300.
---
Nop
---
I'd kick myself for that play
---
shiiet
---
look at the steam store page above the reviews
---
Does that gadget only catch grenates????
---
Just went into a custom game, parts of that boulder/rock your hiding behind lets bullets through. Your position was revealed and the Ela just sprayed a few rounds your way, probably just as surprised as you were when he killed you.
---
This is Siege after all, first thing to check if the game isn't broken
---
It could be another glitch where you lose mmr for winning
---
Cz has no recoil at all.  It‚Äôs part of the way it‚Äôs balanced.
---
Glaz's weapon is really just in a good spot right now, It break barricades in 3 shots and Hatches, I think Glaz would work better as not the Sniper but more as the Medium Range Markmans Breacher, the only thing I needs buffed is his thermal sight
---
The fire rate on top of Glaz' thermal sight being useful again would not be good.
---
It was OP before
---
Answer is 4. Video is long for no reason.
---
Yeah and i like that but I don't like the outfit it's very lame :v but u can't have everything I guess
---
Who's the lazy one now?
---
Is that a smonk plush
---
Daily limit, so in 24 hours you can only get 50k renown.
---
Find me a game during the finals where Ela was used.
---
Yeah, I now put them on the first/ second door they are gonna pass rather than around obj. I find people close they get to obj, more attention they pay for traps.
---
Would be so Scary if u saw nokk crouch walking u turn around BOOM u shit ur self ü§£ü§£
---
thankyou for paying your respects
---
*look how they massacred my boy*
---
Wow what a guy

Form now ur a kapkan main.

congratulation. xd

Counterpoint: smoke trails
---
The content of the alpha pack is preset so there is no reason to keep them unless you want to do a packopening vid, usualy ubisoft releases gamemodes or special packs
---
I got a 30 day a little while ago and probably got like 12-13 days played on it, maybe 3-6hrs a day depending on which day. Wasn't really worth it tbh
---
Cant I main more than 1 operator at the same time?
---
You don't even know who that is do you
---
3 weeks give or take a few days
---
How does a weapon that takes nearly 2.5 sec to cycle a follow up shot would break a game where fire rate is king.
---
AWP

U guys are overthinking this... Rotating arrows in a circle is "circling 'round", or simply "rounds". Plain and simple.

‚ÄúA real big fucking hole is coming right up and it is not from my exothermic charge.‚Äù - Thermite 2019

Poor Glaz, He got Replaced, underused and left to rot. This is so sad can we give Glaz a rework?
---
They‚Äôre in their trees over there
---
Is tts out rn?
---
Ok. You dont understand or just dont want to answer me. How are YOU making the skins look good. I can say that yellow castle. I didnt do anything, its just yellow and castle combined. This is your helpful advice, now im a pro siege fashion designer too, let me suck my own dick a bit. Now, i meantion burnt horizon, dust color skin, how does this make my point more valid? The conversation started with the last few seasonal skins being the same plain shit skins they are and this blue looking good, just saying cuz you seem to be a bit lost here.
---
T H I C C
---
fucking doors castled from the inside thats an easy kill for anyone even remotely paying attention
---
Maybe he meant for the CGI for the new ops not their gadget trailer. i think we are gonna get it at the start of the next season, just like what they did with Amaru and Goyo.
---
Lorem ipsum. The newest operator from Operation Generic Latin
---
did you not shoot their feet when they placed the charge
---
Thanks haha.
---
Thought you would appritiate this guys comment
---
People still barricade ??
---
What gun is that?
---
You can prevent all fuze pucks with enough magnet traps, and they will absolutely destroy whatever they end up near
---
Yup. All these pros complaining about the operator will end up not even playing her in Pro League because of the slow fire rate. But they are happy to complain all the same and ruin the fun for the rest of the community.
---
I got pro version tho. It's not worth paying that much money tho
---
True, as per the trailer, they did mentioned she ordered a custom made rifle.
---
I mean getting pull through a wall like I was advertising "kool aid"
---
That‚Äôs not new
---
Don't do this on barricaded doors where you expect the enemy to vault in otherwise they will just jump over the kapkan trap
---
maybe i should just play ranked with at least two of my friends because every game is a chance of luck. you either get sweats on your team or you get people from casual on your team.
---
Yea it was funny
---
Because apparently a pro said that it is broken.
---
Low ranks I'm guessing
---
Honestly, with good placement all kapkan traps go off. Takes the whole prep time but is worth it.
---
What is sixth pick?
---
Fact: Kapkan should be able to place two kapkan in a door
---
Exactly, I think they just mixed up the symbols and such. It means 6 rounds of a regulation match. Plus OT afterwards. So best of six, aka first to 4.
---
A full 5 stack with booster on Hard, expect about ~350 renoun each run.
---
i enjoyed last years more this years was good but haunted house was the best
---
Tachanka and clash
---
Now on today I learned, this magic fuckery
---
That's the one second for him to ADS on you and shoot before you can ADS...
---
Ash.
---
Hitler and Mass genocide
---
&gt;These "pro players" need to just keep their mouth shut because they are not the end all be all of this game. They don't have authority over anything and they shouldn't. 
---
Have you played it? Because unlike you, they have. MONTHS before reveal. They have an NDA allowing them to play all this and test it in alpha stage provided they don't reveal sh*t. So if a pro says something, you better believe them because they've had time to play it, unlike the casual community that you and I are a part of.
---
Not that I'm saying she is broken, because I haven't played it yet, but the opinion of somebody with 12000 hours of experience definitely matters more than that from a community that thinks Cav is OP and bans her in ranked.
---
Now they'll go back to TEAMKILLING the person who gets the new ops first.
---
You could‚Äôve told us before Doktor‚Äôs Kurse was over...
---
Thank you! Very kind. Hard trying to fit it in around a full time job and kids üòÇ but yeah it's a great hobby

I only said that she *can*, not that she *will*.

you're a little short with that number

That will require you to barricade before placing the trap. What about entries without barricades
---
I use Muzzle brake and Holo. I wouldn‚Äôt use the ACOG for multiple reasons, one of them being the recoil. Aside from the recoil, since buck is a soft breacher/entry fragger it means you‚Äôll be up close and personal with the enemy team and an ACOG is the worst up close.
---
I play with a guy who swears it does more damage since it hits them in the head.

Can‚Äôt convince him otherwise

I like it, its subtle. Better than a shitty charm or, imho, some of the flashy legendaries that burns your eyes with a bright color like pink.

I'll probably buy them as soon as the week waiting period is up. I'm looking forward to trying out Wamai.
---
So the gadget is just a more durable drone? Idk seems not that useful. What about a drone that can remotely detonate. Detonation can occur after the prep phase. But you can position it in the drone phase. To make it not over-powered, make its movement sounds loud and slower than a normal drone

They will fill different roles; Glaz will fill the role he's been filling so far, while Kali will possibly be filling the role Glaz *was intended* to fill

This was the case with thermite in alpha/beta(?) but it was too strong.

No probs. glhf.
---
People have been asking for this since release, IDK if it would be balanced in Siege tho.
---
In close quarters, yes, but at longer ranges bolts have advantages, fewer moving parts allows for tighter tolerances which allows for a more precise weapon.
---
A detonation would be too op, as you can kill an operator with it, I thought about a self-destructing EMP drone, but it's not that useful either.
---
Maybe a fire charge one would be the right balance.

---
i thought this was shitty r6 for a second. jesus people.
---
Wait, really! So we get our own servers!
---
Have a checklist when you‚Äôre attacking. 
---
1) Know who‚Äôs got the defuser and support them. 
---
2) Have a plan of attack and get inside ASAP. The more time defenders delay, the worse for attackers for obvious reasons. So use your drone,  get in, and go from there. 
---
3) Use crossfires and call outs to kill enemies. Know what your teammates are watching (angles they‚Äôre holding) so if they die you can possibly get the trade. Also drone ping kills through walls are what make this game awesome. 
---
4) Watch for the plant. Use remaining gadgets to secure site once defuser is activated. And don‚Äôt watch the bomb from the same spot as a teammate. 
---
And always drone the unknown. Or throw a stun grenade.
---

There was definitely no strat here, except trolling in casual.  Giving it some higher purpose is a figment of your imagination, nothing more.
---
Because the panel is on the inside of the door which means Castle had to be inside or down the hatch
---
Its easy to solo q and spiral downwards in one sitting. Walk around for a sec, sit back down, focus, drone, listen, and entry frag. Pick smart rooms, either push WITH or WITHOUT your team- not half/half or anything like that. Its all awaren
---
Opinion: I like where glaz is at rn 
---
he can fire his semi auto rifle really fast making it optimal to not have the scope up all the time
---
if he needs to take it slow he can lay smoke and see through it with the thermal scope covering people while they plant or to cover a choke point

i personally think he is good where he is standing right now despite what graphs say

Yeah but who doesn't look inside the door before you enter. And you normally look at head level, so when you clear your corners it'll be right in the middle of your screen for a long time.

Essentially players didn't buy as many as the company would have liked, since the 30 day booster was effectively 720 hours of game time. Players would only pick up a new booster after that ran out, which was usually a lot less often that every 30 days.

Mav will NEVER be irrelevant. Even after the sound nerf, he's still banned A LOT in PL. If I'm not wrong, apac and EU hate him.

In the video where they revealed the new ops they [specifically named Capitao as someone Wamai would counter](https://youtu.be/edJKEME3xRk?t=698).

Tea bagging? That's a downvote, Amigo

It would make sense

Which means, like the other dude said, give 416 on attack.

Tbh with shotgun-smg12, he's pretty good.

I mean your plats have high kd‚Äôs, maybe it‚Äôs just basing your skill on the stats not so much for ranks. A champion can die even to a gold/plat, the conception is a champion is more likely to win against plats. Not definitely written to be a loss on your part.

"That doesn't even make any sense"
---
I hope you realize that makes her worse off as an operator. Her fo-12 is surprisingly balanced. Low damage, low range,  high recoil. But the fastest of shotguns fire rates. This is with the extended barrel as well. The scorpion on the other hand id the worst gun in game. Just like Ela is one of the weakest operators in game. The scorpion is the 3rd least damaging weapon in game. Has a very low fall off range. And is the only gun in game to not have a horizontal boundry in her recoil diamond. This is easily proven by the ingame spreadsheet that gives her no pattern which ever other gun does. So if they nerfed an fo-12, a balanced weapon it'd become bad. If they buffed the scorpion at the same time it'd also go from pathetic to still bad. Even if they buffed the scorpion all the way you only have flip flopped the guns in their abilities. A nerf to something balanced and buffing the scorpion fixes nothing. All there should be is a buff.

Ubisoft: that‚Äôs not my fucking problem
---
That is correct if you've gone that in-depth ye. But  I'm a Fragger always solo queueing with a 1.6 kd and that's what I went off of, I always end up a match with a around 8-15 kills depending on my team. But that besides the point. You are correct.
---
Around about December 3rd.
---
Damnit! My plans foiled again!
---
I can‚Äôt believe I used to do this lol
---
They just buffed it too
---
Agree
---
Yes but tac realism would shake it all up, and honestly, it would destroy the meta at all ranks. Not everybody wants tacReal, definitely not me. That's just immersion for which I'd gladly go to insurgency if I wanted it.

When they won pro league and SI 2017. He was the IGL and assembler of the cTm roster.

smg 11 is better

Then what‚Äôs the point of the solo playlist? People complain that 4 stacks are toxic and don‚Äôt give info, solo queuing is a disadvantage so all solo queuers will go into this separate ranked playlist to only play with/against solo and 4 stacks won‚Äôt find a game because they won‚Äôt find a last player.
---
Well I guess they just buffed all shotguns, not that one in particular. They changed the shotgun spread  so that it‚Äôs more concentrated in the center, which is a range buff for all shotguns
---

'Sup. Wanna game sometime?

Only acceptable buff here would be to increase the damage for Kapkan traps at chest level. Keep the same for ankle height.

I really wise I could use the SMG 11. I only get kills on people croch walking or standing still but it‚Äôs difficult to for me to kill someone full sprinting across from me

That's some serious aggression.

Say, you go 1x or acog on attack?
---
Found the idiot

Odd.

We need a comment regardless, since many on seas can't right now.

Love your work as always!

That‚Äôs why I place Kapkan traps in the most random and distant doorways lol. Get the one-off guy.

---
Let's just hope it's a little better than lions rework lol.... I can see it now, chanka rework, 4 years later.... "2 more damage"
---
Imagine being so elitist you make comments like this on a sub based on a game, not a system.
---
They weren't very accurate shots, I'd guess only 3-4 of the pellets hit out of the 8 total. The rook plates also give players an extra 2 armor.
---
Any updates on client side debris?
---
Well I'm what you call a sweaty ash and jager main, normal holo and hard peeking and winning most gunfights. And always rushing without thinking, I do really wanna do strategies and things but not having a full stack doesn't allow me to do that and that's why I just frag.
---
I‚Äôve always put my traps at the lowest possible area. Is this not commonly known?
---
No they're different variants of exiting guns. Would have different damage stats and drop off etc. Didn't have enough space for detail

i played cod before r6 so all i know is eliminating players is very easy for me so just get more competitive i guess

Never tried that, will give that a go! Thanks
---
I made the switch back in August and its been great, you will just need to get used mouse and keyboard and you'll be fine. Also there is way less toxic people on pc than console. If you've ever solo queued on console you know what I'm talking about.
---
In the Launch vid they Said it could pierce through 3 defender heads
---
Not only are the chances of 2 people just standing on those hatches extremely slim, but neither of them shot a single bullet, or even tried to look around or run away. I gotta call BS on this.
---
This is why I mute randos
---
Find a character you like and that suits your playstyle. Started playing Smoke recently and I loved it. Remember that R6S is a hard game. Don't lure yourself into the trap of thinking it's easy.
---
Probably Castle. Everytime you shoot him in the foot, he screams for like 5 seconds.
---
If you want fun gameplay operators, i would say Alibi - it's risky to stand in your hologram, but if it works, you're going to lol a lot.
---
Fair enough but maybe re-use some of the better weapons like the Sig AR?  The Aug with optic takes up half the screen :(
---
.... That doesn't benefit ubi though

---
I was consider alibi, isnt her gun complete crap? and her secondary isnt to good either. Not 100% sure thats what one of my friends say
---
problem is you cant dc from unranked. I use casual for solo queue and it sucks that I can't pick which maps I want to play and in the new update I can't even pick which mode, it sucks.
---
It's just frustrating that ops like Warden, Ying, and Glaz exist and need buffs badly. This is the perfect time to do so, but Ubi misses the mark again
---
T-hunt should be offline the actually pretty ridiculous that is not
---
Eww console sucks
---
RACIST
---
One could argue that she is as balanced as she can get. Her main weapon is bolt action, very low fire rate and awkward to navigate in tight situations, default depth while aiming on that thing is greater than ACOG. Her secondary only has iron sights and last I tried it, the CZ75 isn't the best out there from visibility-while-aiming, imho. 
---
Can't forget that her gadget makes a loud noise thus Bandit can remove his batteries and place them back once she wastes them all. And attackers can't place their hard reach charges, because she will destroy those too, unlike Thatcher.
---
All in all, I think she is very balanced in my eyes. Have to wait a bit and have people play her on the TTS to make proper judgment.
---
I would add something German.
---
On console shotguns are op because you don't have to have perfect aim. On pc tho unless you're rushing, use the L8
---
How am I wrong? Give me reasons
---
Here is how to play Siege.
---
Pick Ash
---
Die
---
Complain that your team sucks and ragequit
---
And create a vicious cycle.
---
Honestly not much changes, the balancing was dissapointing we still have several operators that need help. Overall this patch was meh, not great but not bad
---
It's a fact you know
---
Shit, looks like shotguns will be underpowered again, not having limb penetration as one of few weapons and with Ubi reintroducing damage reduction for hitting arms.
---
Maybe she tweeted the N word or something lol
---
You could feel the rage coming from the first guy
---
Tower: am I a joke to you.  
---
They've took Skyscraper of the ranked rotation, so maybe we will see some improvements there next year.
---
Prepare to play against smurfs
---
&gt;I mean most of the pros are knobs
---
Not correct.
---
And yes they have been wrong before but that doesn't discount someone's validity
---
I've seen this once. Just rolled a grande under the barricade and enjoyed Castle's last moments in agony and regret.
---
Thing is, people don't know how to put them that low. That's why I created this
---
Don't get me started on Dokkaebi.

Yes, both are required to acquire any sort of success in r6, gun skill isn't an absolute requirement because of the team based aspect, but at the same time you can help your team if you loose every single gunfight. Try to find a middle ground between the two, but I would lean more towards game sense than gun skill, because no matter how nutty a no brain Ash main is if you can't find enemies you can't get kills.
---
Try to listen, if you can hear and locate someone it gives you the advantage
---
You mean dokki-bae
---
When's kali out on main servers
---
Any information on map changes in ranked? Is Theme park in? Are Chalet and Skyscraper gone?
---
*capit√£o main* HMMM
---
I hope you're right.
---
That's only because the TTK of all secondary SMGs is nuts good. It lacks the recoil of the SMG-11 and 12.
---
yeah, I'm really surprised they didn't mention it. I know Echo needs a nerf, but I'm not sure how I feel about his drones looking so fuckin bright.
---
There will be a lot more coming with the TS. We're trying to keep things spicy.
---
That's because they have run out of bugs to fix

What they‚Äôre aiming for is different to what casual actually is. Quick Match doesn‚Äôt really represent what casual is, because the best way to describe casual is casual. Nobody‚Äôs sweating, nobody‚Äôs caring about strats and shit, just chilling out.
---
Doubt, there is no win classic skin for win 10, no way for him to get the windows looking like that.
---
That‚Äôs a Mozzie if I‚Äôve ever seen one
---
right.. I guess everything is fine then..
---
Circle desk tooooooo!! Why you no circle desk??
---
This is a brilliant idea . But what if it's planted on the middle and the operator is moving while walking/running/sprinting ?
---
He‚Äôs making OC so shut up.
---
My guess too. Breakpoint was so jarring critically and commercially that Ubi has been going to other devs asking how they green light games and their processes to go back to the drawing board for their own games.
---
You'd think they would at least nerf Blackbeard
---
in about 30 minutes!
---
Is that woodland or BLUE jungle?
---
Play more, you'll drop.
---
My guess is that jackal is the only one they're *definitely* changing but then release a set of TTS patch notes with smaller test stuff like removing F2 acog ~~and giving it to the BOSG~~
---
"Friendly last operator standing."
---
Castle: "SUP FUCKERS!"
---
We have a few more surprises coming during the TS :)
---
The mines should be buffed to make people afraid and check door frames more often. As of now, people just rush through mines and soak up the damage.
---
No, the mine damage should not be height dependent. If they were, the mines would be spotted easier, instead of discrete traps. It would nerf Kapkan.
---
Hello Stratofu,
---
That‚Äôs, like, 2 patches in a row making shotguns more powerful. Me like.
---
And it actually says Y5S1.
---
Yeah lol, I've been trying to get more flexible on attack
---
So the spot shown has to be the average level placed it, after reworking the traps that was below the minimum height. The Kapkan trap height depends on standing/crouching, with how high or low you aim along the door. The trick was to place a trap, rip the door down like 3 times and have a pile of debris hide the bright red laser to a 1 hit kill kapkan.
---
Does that mean what i think it means?
---
Ubisoft better not get rid of it.

They didn‚Äôt want to give an acog for nokk tho. They tried her with an acog and with an ar and she was too powerful.
---
Well people have been complaining that Nokk couldn't get an ACOG since her release  
---
Apparently it has been said that it was a technical limitation because she was using a weapon from another operator and they couldn't make them separate  
---
I honestly don't know if that was said or if it was just a widespread rumor

It could be Warden, but it's grayed out.

I'm not ubisoft but don't expect a elite skin for him soon. They haven't made a elite skin for any of the  year 3 operators. Much less a fourth season one.
---
I'm guessing at best it will come in a little more than a year, but since he isn't the most popular operator (no offense) I'd say about two years.

As for a new uniform hopefully but a lot of operators before him don't have one (at least ones you can actively buy.) Sorry.

because they create similar ops because of the bans, imagine the hell worth of match it would be without thatcher or twitch, it would be impossible to play, so they create ops who have similar powers but aren‚Äôt totally focus on destroying bandit‚Äôs battery or mute‚Äôs jammer for example, because you are worried that the new op might destroy bandits batteries, but bot worried about the 1 shot kill monster sniper she carries

Their not if they were to get rid of it they would of in the rework

New operator - Lion but tracks you when you‚Äôre not moving
---
The only other 3 speed ops with a semi or full auto shotguns are cav alabi and pulse and non of those ops have a shotgun with a fire rate like ela. If an ela wants to get into close quarters she can very easily with her speed and flanking ability and if she misses a shot it‚Äôs not a big deal because she can easily make up for it with just pressing the trigger more. Elas shotgun doesn‚Äôt require a good aim because you can hip fire it with much less recoil. Also there is no easy counter to an ela when she‚Äôs camping an important door or window around the corner.

I specifically looked for you. Negative.

Damn i wish i had my pc in me i wanted to see them nonetheless thanks for the info :)

Headshot is guaranteed kill, any other hit is guaranteed injure

Cant afford the licensing for more guns? Didnt they make 440 million dollars in 2018 [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/comments/ahvvwp/ubisoft_made_440_million_of_revenue_from_siege_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Its really rare but ive traded 3x. One won me the round

Yep it has always been useable since day one.

Tachanka rework :D

No problem ! Someone else posted the animation on the subreddit, it's really good

N√∏kk pick rate would go through the roof

I personally really like Frost, but also Thatcher and Twitch are cool
---
It looks awesome but until you play Caffe where you blend with carpet you will be very easy to see
---
This looks awesome!
---
Thank you very much
---
COME ON AND SLAM, AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
---
Do we know her MVP animation?
---
Hahaha gold 3
---
Actually, leaks confirm a swedish op called Ikea that assembles doors and places them around the map.
---
This post completely blew up, thanks everyone :D
---
* Step 1: Play Oregon. 
---
* Step 2: Place breach charge outside of armory, just above the stairs going to basement. 
---
* Step 3: Wait for defender to peek the door from basement stairs (your friendly neighborhood teammate Montagne could be of great help here to both provoke a peek and get the timing). 
---
* Step 4. Blow the charge and get the kill. 
---
Alternate strategy: down someone and finish them off with the breach charge.
---
SameüòÇ I was so pumped when the clip got everything
---
I saw the frost trap and nearly had a heart attack, then realized what was happening
---
Another cringy animation, eh

---
While I appreciate the positive attitude, I don't know how well that would work in practice since a lot of players get very emotional after a loss and just want to vent and move on.
---
Consulate??? Ok why now
---
Can we please give Ubi more ideas for Camera and Drone Ops, it's annoying enough to get spotted from three different spots already
---
Let me guess, next season pick and ban in casual
---
Can we send this to Ubi?
---
This is good, you‚Äôve done good kid
---
In ‚Äúquick match‚Äù it‚Äôs AA-DD
---
a new spot for my list of 27 spots for deploying the LMG
---
Have you tried turning your settings up and use lower fps?
---
R4c acog?
---
the crossbow goes skrrraa
---
That's not a mata-le√£o at all. They should change the name.
---
i don't need to repeat myself lol. you're heavily implying that the game is no longer realistic bc the ops don't look realistic
---
Yes, https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dux872/caveria_elite_animation/
---
It's perfect !
---
Ah found it. Thank you
---
Thanks!
---
Thx !
---
The only issue I can think of is with Wamai, you could use his gadget to pull in explosives towards the hostage, and force the enemy to kill it because the explosives still count for the person who threw them, last I saw, they could have changed it, or plan to.
---
Cavoeira's Kick.
---
ranked and secure area :(
---
hjonk?
---
Or just show the shot.
---
This means Ex: Chanka shares the same guns as Kapkan but that means Chanka could get acog while Kap won't
---
Or N√∏kk could get acog while smoke won't
---
Why not do something with her knife?  Her current operator card is more unique that this.
---
Kapkan SASG-12 is for me one of the best ways to have fun
---
That happened to me but with thermite
---
No shit had one miss at 82
---
1. Ar pistol and smg don‚Äôt worsen beams because of balance choices. If you are stuck bring breach charges of find an other way.
---
2. Headshots are perfectly fine sure sometimes you get lucky walk bang but in a fun fight it comes down to skill.
---
3. Pretty much all operators are food for their speed and if they aren‚Äôt 3 speed is because of balance and not wanting siege to become cod.
---
yes
---
From a Cav main, I agree with the first Cav main. She is known for sneaking around and doing interrogations. This is boring and uninspired to what makes playing Caveira great.
---
I share those hopes. They have a chance to do something that will last a decade or more, like Siege seems to be on track to: Ubisoft mucks it up a lot, but every now and again they hit the mark. We‚Äôll see, eh?
---
That too.
---
the grenade that it catches still detonates, so this would destroy the other. I just did this for comedic purposes
---
It's going to be hilarious to watch as, after all this time Ubi has spent making Kali, she is made irrelevant by a ban system of their own design. I guarantee Shell be an instant ban similar to Jackal or Echo.
---
The Acog is 2.5x fyi
---
What you did to that hat was uncalled for
---
Could also be that they only just figured out how to make it work?
---
Wow, thanks
---
Console luck
---
You‚Äôre the only one with a problem with it.
---
Why every defense op lately is dangerous to the poor hostage
---
just to be safe man, you know why they reworked that map. People cried about map. God damn, so many good memories on that map
---
GOATüòÇ

I want a face reveal since they day she was released. I don't find it boring or uninspired. The crop top with the muscles is perfect
---
Inte jag heller üòÖ
---
They are really making their charms better, even though i like ember rises charms more
---
Stop being poor
---
The gun damage to walls is most likely for balancing. As for the one shot head shots, that should not change.
---
What about the Capitao elite skin?
---
Did you finish school? Do you see the word realistic anywhere in there? How are you coming up with realism/realistic when that word isn't in my comment.
---
L O C A T E D T H E B I O H A Z A R D C O N T A I N E R

Thanks I‚Äôve been playing to much pubg apparently
---
Do you not understand that if you say might, it's still open to being called right or wrong.
---
Can someone explain who that is?
---
Its not the money thats the problem licensing guns in itself is just difficult
---
Damn. I hate AA-DD. ranked gets so boring have to push an OBJ 3 times in a row when you're playing with a shit team.
---
Thank fuck, im tired of seeing him banned or picked every game. Now hopefully jackal is next.
---
Oh I must've misread, thata a ton better, thanks
---
No wamai gets the aug or mp5k and kali only has the sniper as primary
---
When is this event?? Love Money Heist
---
You'll likely see a nerf to crouch walking rather than a buff. It's definitely quieter, maybe too quiet on 3 speeds.
---
I only picked up the green one , probably the only one I think looked decent
---
Your down right the best r6s cosplayer I've ever seen, this is freaking amazing
---
Idk if you've seen it but in varsitys recent video, echos drone's "cloak" is a bright white outline. It's seriously more visible than if it didn't have the cloaking at all
---
Forget completely about him hahaha
---
Did he stutter? 
---
I would do the same
---
He wasn‚Äôt a pro player
---
Wait a minute, at least one of them is a girl....
---
That is absolutely not how rights work. Ubi and any game company don't need to license any guns they use and very rarely do so that has nothing to do with not releasing guns with every op. The real reason is probably that they're running out of stat spreads to make any meaningful differences between guns and they don't feel the need to spend money making what are effectively reskins.
---
There's still the angle from new drop to freezer so nothing has changed except the look.
---
Player that died
---
That‚Äôs harsh bro
---
Well, if you compare the bundle names(I know that it‚Äôs in Russian and you‚Äôre not likely to translate it, but compare the letters), you can see that all of these items belong to the same bundle. I hope they will change it for something more fitting, but for now it‚Äôs how it is in the TTS.
---
 u/coreRoss
---
Can‚Äôt get over the paint job on the AUG, nice touch. Like IQ lept of the screen
---
Hahah SAVAGE!!
---
Oh, so a broken intel op?
---
Yeah there's a reason lol
---
Look honestly, I know I'll get down-voted to hell, but like.... why does this post have any upvotes. Like what's good here? One kill? Not even like exciting of cool or lucky or anything like. Just a kill. Why post it?
---
To me it's cringy as hell ;d
---
*laughs in kali*
---
TTS our yet?
---
Of course smurfing is not against any rules. It's perfectly legal to own multiple accounts. It's not legally wrong, it's morally wrong to Smurf. I mean let's face it, most smurfers probably don't get any satisfaction out of playing against equally skilled players so they make an alt to clap low level players.
---
I only Play Vigil bc of this gun lmao
---
100% agreed. The ‚ÄúShh‚Äù pose fit his character and looked infinitely better and more menacing.
---
The friends didnt guilt trip the devs,ubisoft is honoring a player who died
---
Probably 2 weeks
---
https://youtu.be/4PxDO6sTnDc  last year we had these skins and now we are going to maybe have these https://youtu.be/bxpAgmPN8Xc
---
Can Ubisoft stop adding soft core porn to their game? We‚Äôve already had IQ elite and Ela, then Dokk, now what‚Äôs next? N√∏kk?
---
In addition to OP's comment, I have done some testing on this myself in the past.
---
As OP mentions, a barricade takes 20 shots to destroy. However, this is affected by the shooting angle: If you're shooting at a barricade from directly in front of it (i.e. your shots are landing at a 90 degree angle), you will need to hit 20 shots. However, if you make the angle shallower by shooting from the sides or above/below, you will need exponentially less shots.
---
There's also the fact that a shot is counted based on how many planks in the barricade you hit. This will almost never come up in actual gameplay, but if you stand directly up against a barricade and shoot straight down at where two planks connect (thus penetrating and hitting both), you can destroy a barricade with just 3 shots.
---
Also worth mentioning that when it comes to destroying barricades, the weapon caliber does not matter unless it's a special weapon like Glaz's rifle. Shooting a barricade from directly ahead will need 20 shots from both a DMR and a pistol, for example, and you can mix and match different calibers without changing that.
---
As for the special weapons I mentioned, those are pretty much just Glaz's rifle and slug shotguns. Basically, these weapons will break a barricade in 3 shots, or less if it's been pre-damaged.
---
A barricade will also automatically shatter if enough of it's surface area is cut away by focused fire, even if it hasn't taken the required 20 shots. You'll usually see this with shotguns, which generally follow the 20 shot rule with each pellet in the spread counting as one shot, but you'll usually break the barricade before you reach that threshold because if you're close, each shotgun blast will remove a big chunk of wood.
---
#*"Oh ja, let me see das little bratwurst"*
---
This in the next patch ?
---
Vessel Wave looks pretty good
---
Yeah like zofia's m762 or the t5 smg. Those are made up names
---
Please stop trying to force ranked game format in casual...
---
Now they just need to get Chalet the FUCK OUT OF RANKED.
---
Rest in peace
---
I was hoping Fuze. Sending all those gifts.
---
Oh no, thats just abusive crap lol. Sorry I‚Äôm so tired of people complaining. Dropshotting is just a garbage mechanic, no one likes that.
---
It always was what are you talking about
---
I think the fact that you want to play him means he will still be banned lol
---
The only drawback IS the ironsight, its for Balance. And clashs weapons have reddot bc she doesnt have primary weapons, the spsmg9 would be too weak without it
---
Yeah, my russian is less than none hahaha
---
Like you said, for now it's on the TTS. I personally find hella weird to make that combo as a bundle, it doesn't have any sense on design standpoint.
---
That or maybe it's a placeholder (from what I see they are a few ops with a bundle very plain in colors or with full camo without details.
---
I'm certain it'll be mentioned in the tts soon. It was already in the build varsity played and they (ubi developer) said in the hotbreach podcast from last month,  that they're making nerfs and changes for player comfort now as seen with Jackal.
---
Right, because Ubi can talk to dead people and they ask to be put in game as a memorial. Lol
---
A face reveal skin for a bunch of ops would be great. Except for Mute and Fuze, because the hidden faces are one of the coolest things about them.
---
No, when Doc revives himself, he gets an instant injection of 75 hp (even when he's still getting up), allowing him to tank the single shot you landed on him when he was on the floor. You were just flat out missing after that.
---
Maybe it'll just be in casual til they fix any bugs they've missed with it?
---
Damn. Thanks for info tho.
---
Nope, it doesn't shield anything, it's just a fog machine if you allow the term
---
Yeah Smoke too. The mystery behind some ops makes them even cooler than they were.
---
I approve
---
Your user flair explain... The smell?
---
Was kind of hoping for an underwater title darn
---
Lmao
---
Thanks i hate it
---
You‚Äôll have to forgive me for not knowing who Varsity is o:
---
But that‚Äôs fucking stupid , Echo doesn‚Äôt need changed at all
---
Ah, the time my Cousin introduced me to the game with Buck, Fell for the game right away
---
Vibe Check
---
{-}7
---
Do I have to go to wherever that is to get them?
---
Like IQ's but more intense shame to say Capitao's is better honestly between the two.
---
No his drone can be destroyed just it requires more coordination
---
there is another one called :The Year Of The Rat
---
eh it was casual lol. i was hoping they come to me.
---
What happened in this thread
---
IQ keeps the acog and the defender won‚Äôt have it.

---
Looks bigger to me tho might just be an illusion idk
---
Yeah I logged in later and noticed I had all 6 charms (left the stream going overnight)
---
Exactly! So why the damage drop off? It should either stay consistent or go up.
---
I hope, i guess you are right tho, their servers might be shit but they know to do at least some decent balance.
---
Yeah I honestly can‚Äôt see why people don‚Äôt enjoy playing here
---
Ah, yeah, i use it often for that... Never thought what would it be like for the other team... But i'll still use it, because it is something meant to be
---
Hah. Tuna.
---
Can you explain to me what this is? I have been curious about why there was a high score?
---
Her gadget is countered by some of the most picked/meta ops Echo, Smoke, and Lesion. Her assault rifle is one of the worst in the game, shitgun rush only works against brainlets, and the lmg is subpar.
---
Maverick cause he seems E P I C
---
Makes sense, good explanation
---
I sit in there mid round sometimes and put punch or bullet holes watching red hatch drop so I can kill whoever drops
---
Finka‚Äôs LMG is a really good LMG, her AR is decent and serves its purpose, and she has access to one of the best pistol‚Äôs in the game. No matter how good a DMR is, a full auto AR will always be better. Finka has frags too. Why pick Dokkaebi to hunt down roamers over Lion, Jackal (when he‚Äôs not banned) or even N√∏kk to an extent? Fun is subjective, so whatever, and like I said Finka‚Äôs guns are average to really good.
---
Who needs to cosplay when you can buy the real thing?
---
I mean they already have Fuze who as an operator who is awful on hostage lol
---
Depends on the elo you play around. Finka loses value at higher elos due to people aiming for headshots. Dokk is great in coordinated environments where people can entry frag when you call and be active on hacked cams. Both of them have subpar weapons at best.
---
They rework maps and still ppl don‚Äôt like those reworks besides kafe. Them not getting licensing is bs that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. After being 250 level I want new content and not use the same gun after using every gun in the game
---
I mean hostage itself is not a played game mode, but still ya know, i was more obout capitao than anything
---
Kill an enemy with a breach charge
---
It depends mostly on how unfun it is to play against him. I usually choose to ban Jackal because it just feels like, if I'm playing Roamer, my round is instantly ruined if they pick Jackal. Jackal is a really fun concept but he can ruin entire playstyles just be existing.
---
If they rein him in just a bit, they should be able to find a way to make him balanced, and still not frustrating.
---
My ping randomly jumps to 4000
---
Or you know you could ban her if she too much of an issue. Or use castle or frost or just watch the window.
---
I‚Äôm not saying chalet is the best map but your argument for taking it out is not valid.
---
If it's still in rotation it's probably going to get a rework next year, ubi is probably trying to collect as much data as possible before they take it out
---
I don't care what people say,Ubisoft is a good company.
---
If you got banned for a few bad words I'd be permad a long time ago
---
You are getting new content you are getting a brand new sniper rifle and a new theme park is that not enough and also new pro league skins and elite skins .
---
I wonder if she and IQ train with each other, both their elites are basically the same
---
they're gonna speak both English and French as it is Canada... no need to worry
---
This is the season I get plat for sure
---
Ye ik but I'm guessing if there are bars that stream it some of em might have it in French yknow
---
Why Tower loved too play this map
---
Damn you are such an asshole, he saw that you were Sofia and most likely wanted to do a knife fight and you took advantage of that good will
---
for all 4 seasons?
---
This clip was faked on a custom game
---
The change will cause Jackal to have to play more tactically, it sounds exactly like what you are wanting, so I'm not sure what your issue is.
---
I think this one isn‚Äôt too bad j just wish it was  was longer... as a Latino i feel they didn‚Äôt capitalize on the general feel of South America, and Latin America
---
All Elite animations are always trash
---
Lesion and Echo get banned all the time, and Finka can counter echo‚Äôs counter by using the surge. You can use your frags to get rid of lesion mines or just pick them off now that they‚Äôre easier to see. Smoke is as simple as not going through it, finding another way if possible, or just not using the surge. The AR is not ‚Äúone of the worst‚Äù in the game like you say it is, it‚Äôs mediocre but combined with the surge it‚Äôs amazing. The LMG is also really damn good and the downsides of using an LMG, slow reload and slow ADS, can be fixed with the surge. In my opinion, Finka‚Äôs utility is better than Dokk‚Äôs, especially after all of Dokk‚Äôs nerfs.
---
Thank God
---
Sometimes if the attackers are rushing they will just blindly shoot hibana pellets at it. It's a fun tactic to use on golds and lower if you don't have anything else to use for your bandit batteries.
---
Shut up Dale
---
Fuck I want a new map. Look at the oil rig. What a waste.
---
I WAS HOPING THEYD KEEP THAT IN
---
hmm. I wonder why thatcher mentions the IDF
---
Lol most definetely saw you were Sofia and wanted to knife fight and then you like a sweaty Cheetos covered basement dweller took advantage of them
---
Set FPS, no luck. What would a good mbps be for rainbow?
---
Why the low quality? I wanna see the icon !!!
---
Oh i didn't know that. Because i have dodged and killed a few blitz flashes by doing the same technique. Maybe it was further the other few times.
---
There is clearly not enough lightning bolts
---
Solo queuing is the worst.
---
It absolutely IS op in PL. He's one of the most consistently banned operators in the game for his ability to completely deny defuser plant in the most crucial moments. Echo *existing* in the last half minute of a round can put an incredible amount of pressure on attackers, because if you do not *find and kill* Echo before you try to plant, you basically have already lost.
---
And that's *just* in that situation, forgetting that Echo is also useful throughout the round anyway. He's extremely powerful.
---
One sniper after back to seasons of recycled guns and maps and now after this new season we‚Äôre still going to get recycled guns lol.
---
She loos super derpy
---
DROP AVP MEN

My disappointment immeasurable, and my day is ruined

Ohhh shit! Noted. Lmfao.  Bravo good sir
---
He really didn‚Äôt though
---
I agree but people say: "oh but it‚Äôs casual who cares".
---
4-5 a week may be not enough I‚Äôll go for like 4-5 a day. Because life happens and sometimes you need to leave the game. This is intended for repetitive leavers that quit the nano second they die.
---
R/youbrokethechain
---
I wasnt saying it was I was aaying in general, why are you being so defensive?
---
Lava you get it with season 4 pass
---
Bro thx, if you hear anything lmk, otherwise I'll just look around when I get there ig
---
Almost enough to make me want to play Ranked.
---
I'd definitely wear one of these... if not for the fact I'd have to replace my AnneMunition charm.
---
With the reports that the new aug A2 doesn‚Äôt get an Acog while IQ gets to keep hers it shows ubi found a way to balance the same gun different across multiple operators. That was my main complaint being the balance. 
---
As long as there‚Äôs still a drip feed because the new bolt sniper is really cool I‚Äôm fine with reusing guns. To be honest I kinda like the ability to re use skins instead of needing new ones too.
---
This iq headgear would be amazing [iq](https://imgur.com/gallery/kSuFqug)
---
You ban Amaru instead of Maverick/Thatcher and you are even more complicated. You ban Maverick or Thatcher and now you have Kali. Holding the exterior reinforcement is going to be impossible
---
Because your saying it was faked while having no reason to say it is
---
It‚Äôs called Meltdown Montr√©al if you want to check it out.
---
I mean, I don't think he can continue.
---
Is this not on the console version? I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve seen it on PS4
---
I do think she should have a replacement weapon to lower her skill floor but I think most people just don‚Äôt know how to play her properly.

Anyone wanna hop on rn

Your aim is doodoo

Yeah no problem next time you will know how to write it :)

Wait who is BostonBearJew

Can you show me the back? For research purposes

I'll look at it when we get closer

Hello saltysnacks-,

Literally what made glaz broken, sorry but no
---
I use to play with Boston a bit, he subbed in for my ESL team a few times. Guy was the nicest guy on Rainbow. Always loved this tribute to him
---
I love both mainly for the tcsg , I use goyo when I wanna focus on fragging and kaid when I wanna anchor, today I popped two 5ks with them with the tcsg its amazing
---
No you absolute pea brain I said I hate it when PEOPLE say that they have #leet skills when its clearly faked or the person clearly didnt want to kill them. People, as in the general population. So once again, why so defensive bud?
---
