No not yet, thats a future thing becuase its difficult to redesign smoke propagation, simmilar to how long it took to redo fire spread

I feel like as much as anyone would deny it we've all five something similar at some point.
---
Captain Marvel OP ubi plz nerf.
---
Why does it have to do anything? It's just a level that means nothing after level 30, what is putting you off?
---
Pulse looking like he took a mad dump
---
Aw man great edit anyway
---
Valk/Mute so I can be busy with utility, especially with Valk...my mind goes to bank where I put cams in the far sides of the map.
---
That's true. But often there are the most toxic people ive ever seen before online
---
I should have mentioned I’m more of a casual player but I’ll keep this in mind when I do play ranked
---
Yeah this event was exclusively for console
---
I guess I did have to put a /s, silly me thinking reddit could understand a joke.
---
So Basically OG Glaz? His ability was Originally just Zoom toggle, until the Meta became ACOG everything so Ubisoft added the Thermal effect as a buff.
---
Except that was Hostage so no one will care

When a multiplayer shooter has better story and world building than story based single player games

Dude every legitimate criticism on this sub gets downvoted to hell. It's a common trend.

Astroturfing isn't a conspiracy theory. It's a real thing.

They’re still OP tho

There’s a thousand and one metaphors you could have put and you had to choose a politically charged one? Nah man. Just don’t bother.

I just do t hunt for earm up... Don't see a need to rework it

**Astroturfing**
---
Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word "grassroots". The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a "true" or "natural" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a "fake" or "artificial" appearance of support.

Judging by the sound it makes, it's probably a harpiscord. Although I never tried shooting at a piano, so I don't know what that sound like.

It would still be better than that new one

God damnit

I dont anymore this was from a couple of weeks ago

I would like a last team standing situation for the game where you just kill the other team and after 4 minutes everyone's health goes down to 1 for an overtime situation.
---
thanks man
---
Ok
---
Yessir
---
Amaru is definitely the Peruvian bird/snake cryptid. Still no clue on Goyo.
---
I thought it came from the crab rave with some text overlay saying "obama is gone"
---
I'll support this only if we also add favela back to ranked rotation. now you might think i'm crazy, and you'd be right, but nobody should be exempt from the pain of sites that literally have more exterior soft walls than you get reinforcements

Dont forget the gas can right next to the grappling hook.
---
I'd be down to play in a little bit but keep in mind I'm not the best at this game, I've only been playing casual lately.
---
Pulse looking as special as I feel playing him.
---
Or flanking.....
---
Pulse looks like clone Stewie in Family Guy
---
They removed Favela twice now. The first time they lied and said it was to fix the issues wrong with the map. It returned with zero changes.
---
People can choose to play on these maps. If they don't like them, they can requeue. It's one thing to remove them from ranked. To remove them from a CASUAL playlist where nothing matters is asinine. And it's doubly ridiculous when it happened in a year with the least amount of added content yet and has had more content removed than added. Great evolution right there!
---
You may have to restart the game to get the option.
---
Dont forget the ones that walk in front on you in a fire fight. Then get upset about it when they get shot for it.
---
PC in a nutshell

---
Shoot, I meant to sign up a few weeks ago, how long is the current waitlist for the reposts?
---
Wheres homeless
---
Until less than a year from now when I guarantee you they remove hostage and secure area from casual.
---
If you read the patch notes, they explain why
---
The next rainbow six won’t be out for like at least 6 or 7 more years I think lol. The devs said they want to support t for 10 years
---
They changed the mmr requirements for each rank so that they can test out the new champion rank. All the ranks have been reduced accordingly.
---
Vote Kicked initiated: Captain Marvel 3/4
---
Yes or No
---
I'm getting kinda tired of seeing this image posted here at least once an hour.
---
They reduced rank requirements to test the new champion rank
---
Goyo is a widespread spanish name, a person bearing this name is believed to be accurate and resilient. Maybe, that's it?
---
The 10th most likely...thats 3 weeks after test servers just like last season
---
Do you happen to know the song in the video?
---
 Until less than a year from now when I guarantee you they remove hostage and secure area from casual.
---
No
---
absolutely my proudest fap
---
Statistically it’s as balanced as bank. So.... objectively the complaint about it being unbalanced is wrong
---
I don’t see that happening. What leads you to believe they will do that?
---
I actually did something like that almost a year ago. It was definitely worth it.
---
They won't. Seeing as they are the casual gamemodes that are playable in the casual playlist.
---
The fact it is just a levelling system that does nothing but lock you out of Beginner and access to ranked. It's a potential mechanic that can reward players.
---
It’s a pin from Fanfitgaming.com and idk for some reason they don’t sell the blue or any other color than yellow
---
Favela is a garbage map and it 100% deserves to be removed from the game entirely. They should never have brought it back at all. "Don't like it just requeue." is really stupid to even suggest. If a map is so bad that you even consider requeueing just because you got it, the map shouldn't be in the game. There's a difference between refining the content already in the game, and just removing content for no reason. 
---
Quality over quantity.

*the username is fitting*

When was it?

Theres one on outback called Brick

Good meme did laugh

With the name info I could track it down in two seconds.

---
Yes
---
stop spamming
---
Oh, didnt know that. This is the 1st time im playing 50+ matches in ranked
---
The new twitch skins aren't packs, they're just in your ops inventory.
---
I’m not being arrogant but I’d rather be like that than just cry over people tilting in a competitive environment
---
not ace cause teamkill
---
Find someone to play with if you play alone
---
Pulse tho
---
I mean, it's ubi, they've never given anything special for any rank, ever.. unlucko
---
They look like reaction images
---
I do have a friend but hes burned out as well, we are both well over lvl 130 so maybe thats why
---
my point is why the hell is team killing a thing in competitive play, shouldnt there be something in place to stop that? e.g some form of ban period
---
I checked, still not there.
---
Make sure you're going onto twitch and claiming the skin from the prime loot section.
---
Proximity Alarm got reworked into Gridlock\Alibi no? Fulfils same role
---
I'm lvl 83
---
You could say the same thing about the LA8, and a bunch of other guns
---
EQUALS RIGHTS MEANS EQUAL FIGHTS, SMACK THE BITCH
---
Oh alrigh thas dope
---
Honestly thought about that before I made the post. I would. But I'm not sure where to draw the line, a lot of defender ops are "set it and forget it" but Rook is by far the easiest. There is honestly no reason that Rook even has to set his vests down, not that I would take that part out.
---
I already did that.
---
Ps we won
---
Yeah I'm pretty bad tho
---
So Warden would control the whole teams glasses?
---
No that was bs but I’m just sayin
---
You know exactly what it means big boy :*
---
Is this the cg video they said they were going to have before the new season?
---
Just keep playing youll get there soon :)
---
The difference being theyre on Attack and not Defense
---
Not confirmed about no new maps.
---
They just wanna focus on already existing maps this year which is good since many players wanted many maps fixed.
---
And new guns will definitely still be a thing.
---
The only issue is that they planned to keep siege supported for 10 years in total and they wanna have in the end up to 100 operators. They can't always release new guns if a dlc operatoe receives like 3 new guns in the game.
---
80 DLC operators and everyone has new guns. Now let's assume everyone gets at least 3 new guns,that would be like 240 guns.
---
We already have around 100 guns. And those additional 240 guns would just be already existing guns but with slightly different sound and different models.
---
Thx your probably god tier
---
I want to see someone actually defend the death threats..
---
Truely a cruel way to die, I must say.
---
I don't know then, I never had any problems with it. Hope you figure it out soon.
---
just to play devils advocate, your basically pointing out we should be able to leave the game if they ban someone I like. which isnt a good reason to be leaving a game. Find another reason and how they can implement it and I would be more interested. Such as a vote system where u need X amount of players to agree to the game end. just as example.
---
I have the MP5
---
Damn, those scumbags. They said mean things on the internet.
---
There is a ban for doing it a ton
---
I whould like one of the new ones from ember rise
---
Follow r/seigeacadamy
---
Wondering the same thing. I haven’t played many single players but one those has been Skyrim.
---
I agree with all but kafe, the kafe rework is one of the better ranked maps imo
---
Cry baby ass dude
---
Alright getting on
---
Imagine being in a firefight and your teammate just walks through your fire line in a (possibly drug induced) trance chasing an invisible flying syringe.
---
How is 5 stacking unskilled? You have to coordinate with your team to be successful in this game and having a squad at hand that you can play well with means you can win over people that aren’t communicating as much.
---
It really depends, but using the original ops aren’t a bad idea. Such as Doc or Bandit
---
Thanks!
---
You can go on certain websites where you can find teammates
---
and what exactly do you want us to see. a screenshot tells us literally nothing
---
I have never been more conflicted about a Valk uniform in my life
---
If your decent at the game and you 5 stack you should never lose the game until the plat 2 range imo
---
[removed]
---
I think that would work if the siege community was more mature. At least on console. Ive heard mostly good things about most of the pc people.
---
Does this seriously happen? Not even a Castle ban?
---
That shit went right over your head didn’t it
---
september 10th
---
im diamond on the tts but only have 2400 mmr?? did this change or something bc i thought it was a glitch.
---
Well it’s a team based game and it rewards players that can play, well, as a team.
---
If there were a priority list, I'd still take a look at Skyscraper over Chalet for a possible ranked cut. Shame the reply to Ubi couldn't go into more specific detail on why they feel that way - likely because of word limit, etc.
---
I do really like and appreciate what they're doing by taking out Base and Fortress though, so I'm not gonna complain. If Theme Park rework pans out we may see another nice change to the rotation in the final season of this year.
---
Or maybe give a reasonable recoil pattern, like holy sh...
---
There is no rejoin button. To get back you have to search for another ranked match, then you’ll get into the one you disconnected from. But if you restart siege, I don’t think you can join back. But idk
---
League of legends is a team game and it has a solo que only mode which allows you to duo with one or person max and it's the most played game in the world
---
It's speculated to be September 10th.
---
True. Recently thr was a post here for call to seige even on a porn site :)
---
&gt; and there will be several opponents right in front of you.
---
At that point it's either Terrorist Hunt or you'd rather have ACOG so you can have better view of the match from Valhalla.
---
Yeah, some of the guys I play with. They get absolutely pissed when the accidentally killed by a teammate. Then try to kick said poor innocent soul. So this squad wide thing won’t bother me
---
Pulse with that baby pout face
---
Nice to hear you had that amazing opportunity. Also, I like your blond hair, if suits you well.
---
Nice
---
You need to stop
---
That's the goal

Out of all these profiles, you're probably my favourite.

people who can’t take 10 seconds to read the sub rules before posting deserve a ban

Real questions here: How does a trophy system work?
---
All maps for Cas sure but but night maps, remove them all.
---
"The the test server."
---
Yes I said I know all that. I'm saying there is no proof though. It's all speculation based on what has happened before.
---
I hated this
---
Don’t make fun of my aspirations to play as a unicorn.
---
I personally like the skins and uniforms.
---
While there is silly stuff, you also can be as tactical as you want with any of the characters.
---
They even added IRL weapon camos waaaay back and nobody uses them.
---
Yo Angelo!
---
It’s the remote play app for the PS4
---
They should give the p90 to another operator. As long as the mp5 exists it will never be used.
---
Btw no one will use the 417 because the f2 is the best gun in the game.
---
This is true
---
SMH Typical Ash Main.
---
If you’re gonna stop playing because they remove all the skins then you’re a dumbass. We play siege because we love how tactical the game is not the skins.
---
Who else expected that ending?
---
I'm broke, so I can't afford cosmetics......

Chalet is my favorite map
---
So scary
---
Wait... that’s illegal
---
Well some have. A very very very small percentage though.
---
We should have this but animated op screens

I think the line would be putting actual thought into your traps. If jager just put 1 ads down in the middle of the room to turn off grenades for the round I'd call it passive

I blame the orange fuck.

U guys clearly surrendered cause score is 4-4

Id laugh if ubi made him say for one death

“Shot him in the head, didnt register it”

It’s what a P-90 should look like vs what it looks like now.
---
Bro that shit was pissing me off i thought something was wrong with my remote or game. Thats when i saw this post lmao
---
...you dont have to worry about grenades anymore
---
He says high sens but you see how when he’s planning around you can see the camera go the opposite direction for a second before resuming the pan? Seems like it’s from him resetting his mouse (moving the mouse back to the other side of the mousepad), I can’t think of a reason that would happen on a joystick
---
I'm completely aware of that, it just surprised me
---
Must’ve surrendered in the last round
---
Yeah, the random surrendered as soon as I died 🙄
---
the best thing is that not a single bullet was fired , take note , this is some son goku shit.

Why has there been a wave of idiots on reddit asking for literally the dumbest changes. Idec if I get downvoted, it’s the truth. I literally just saw a post how mp5 should lose acog, like wtf???
---
I don't want to be harsh because you obviously put some time into this but this pretty uninspired and we have enough "trap" operators already.
---
it was a joke, but at the same time I also seriously suck at geography and have no idea where a lot of states are

Cav is sick

Thanks man never seen this before

So, I think you all know why I called you here today...
---
Wll they arent a cheap knockoff
---
It's an edit to mmr on the test server to test out their champions rank, so they lowered it to around gold 3 or so
---
TTS has the ranks lowered to test the Live functionality of Champions
---
I wanted to try and work with the concept behind operators like clash, wherin you take abilities or weapons commonly associated with one side and try to work out how they would work for an operator on the opposite side. So an attacker who can place temporary barricades over entrances to help hold a position or slow down roamers, and a defender whose main weapons are either a riot shield or a marksman rifle (not quite a sniper rifle, not quite an assualt rifle). Ive also wanted to see some form of bouncing betty in the game for a while, and thought that defenders should have an additional gadget option in their arsenal since attackers currently have more options than defenders.
---
I can’t find it. Source: am USA. If it really is I’m mega pissed.

Why you scream at people tho
---
RETURN OF THE KING
---
I just like bouncing bettys, theyre a cool and unique land mine derivative and personally I think the game could use a differnt trap operator to shake things up. Especially since the trap is a flash bang which is different from prior traps that either explode or afflict a status effect
---
i see you’re a master of siege as well...

so cool

What is this exactly? (Sorry)
---
DON'T give ubisoft ideas
---
I love that Ubisoft is doubling down on, “This game is not forgiving. You will die—a lot—but it’s worth it.”
---
somehow i highly doubt it’s your first day.
---
the other day I learned the soft wall out side barrels in Hereford, the green closed barn door. that the roof above it is soft. I have been playing for 4 seasons and I didn't know it was soft. In hind sight, I must have fuzed the outside of the map a few times too on attack.
---
I learned this because a leasion got me as habana. and that death thought me a bit of spatial awareness.
---
At 3.5k mmr? That’s low as shit
---
Do you have to be near your ps4
---
How do I show steam receipt?
---
So how is middle school?
---
I think next update will change it a bit.
---
What? There are litterally too many maps in casual.
---
Honestly!
---
the music from around 0:30 onwards reminds me of the Awaken League of Legends cinematic during the Jhin and Camille part.
---
When I saw this post it also had 69 likes....
---
Cause it’s not a US trailer. It’s European I’d assume via the ratings in the lower left. So may be some legal issue in that regard.
---
not sure, I’m an xbox player. it’s weird seeing someone with that much awareness and gamesense for a touted first day. 
---
if it really is, i apologize. and frankly? damn. you started out great.
---
I am offended (my flair)
---
This is a fricking unicorn
---
~~Throws down a shield and kills everybody~~
---
People who sweat in casual lmao
---
I cant even make gold so dont worry about it bud
---
See, the issue is, if you give him a second shield, or 360° rotation, he'll still be bad. The issues with Tachanka lies within the turret itself. His gadget makes him a sitting duck that, more often than not, gets him killed by someone shooting him at an angle his turret can't hit, he gets fragged/flashed, or vertical play. He needs a big, big rework.
---
I agree
---
Why did someone post a plain white background with dead meme written over it?
---
One great place for a Tachanka is in Bathroom on Border. All it takes is a Jäger, Bandit, Tachanka, and deployable shield to hold it down pat. Especially with the new shield rework, after getting a kill or two, getting off the Turrent is Viable as well. Tachanka needs other operators to function well, such as Jäger, and positioning is everything. While staying still is always a vulnerability, the best way to minimize this is to reduce exposure, for the most part with a deployable shield, and be able to withstand grenades, so bring Jäger. His huge pan mag and impressive suppressing fire is something that can lock down a hallway or entry point, wasting time and draining health, possibly getting kills along the way. I can't wait for the new deployable shield rework next season, as this in itself helps Tachanka lock down hallways and entry points. Tachanka has to have other operators to do his job the best, and I believe the best combo for next season with T-chanks will be: Goyo, Jäger, Bandit/Kaid, and any information op (preferably with mobile info, such as Pulse and Echo, but stationary cams work fine).
---
MADE WITH MEMEMATIC
---
Yes it does
---
Maps won't be removed from casual. Seeing as they are in the casual maps that are playable in the casual playlist.
---
Ahhh. Ok thx &lt;3
---
Id love to try and find out 🥴
---
Why is it blocked in our country
---
Champions is at 5000 MMR so this is fake
---
What does the 69 stand for, it's too late for me to figure it out.
---
No, that's no excuse. Ubisoft is a multi-national, multibillion dollar company with decades of experience in developing games. Why is that Activision and EA (who are similar in size and influence) can get it right, but Ubisoft can't? If Ubisoft were an independent developer, then sure, I might excuse them for their absolute incompetence, but they're not.  Rainbow Six Siege was the best idea for a shooter in ages, but Ubisoft's incompetence ruined it... well, that, and their thirst for money. Let's be honest, they started pushing the game for kids... kids are their focus... this is because the 20 year olds they hired to run their marketing and development departments are clueless. 
---
Ubisoft is a business, no longer a game developer. They only care about their stock price and revenue. The art of game development is long gone. Rainbow Six Siege is broken. They care more about advertising (buying off YouTubers like Get\_Flanked) and selling their "pro-league" then they do with actually making a quality game.

I know ima suns dumb saying this but which map is chalet. I don’t know all the maps by name but I know the maps by memory
---
This whole video, man! I went from “oh this is cool” to “oh this is funny” when I realized he was talking about all his deaths, to “oh this is badass as hell!” when it got towards the end!
---
Idk, i think your using the words too loosely, in my experience, Amaru just doesnt help that much, if your using your gadget as an attacker, you want it to be life or death for defenders most of the time, and for amaru, its life or death, for her
---
Then do you have the YouTube link?
---
oh bro, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has such a bloody ending. Tarantino really ramps up the ridiculous violence. 
---
But i think they say that about video games because we spend a lot of time playing this shit and yea i can see how an outsider can think that it affects our mentality. what they dont see is how social these games are, and how video games are not as isolating as they think
---
I was so upset when they updated it to the baseball trading card screen. This UI looked so badass with your whole squad ready to go.
---
Nah get rid of clash
---
They actually did very well with removing the ability to spawn peak but retaining the ability to attack (and tactically peak from the defenders). This is basically the only possible spawn peak. I don't agree with the other person, this is basically like one of only three ways to go from the spawn and it doesn't seem to be meant to be a spawn peaking spot.
---
I kinda agree except the ranked bomb only, preference should matter. I absolutely hate bomb with every bone in my body. Not saying it's bad, I just dont personally like it. Playing ranked is a job now for me and my team who also hates it. We just play our 10 games to get the rank and switch to casual. I liked how you could set a preference before.

It’s the same philosophy I have each time I get outplayed or I have a bad day on the game - I can only get better from each experience.

Thank you for sharing, OP.

Pretty sure he had one in alpha or beta or something but didn't have it for launch. Not entirely sure, my memory's a little hazy and I only started playing at launch.
---
Yall sleep on my boy kappy’s Vityaz 9
---
Spoken like a player who never played years 1 and 2. Genius, new maps and ops are centered around bomb because they are forcing them to. This wasn't always the case.
---
Thirmite and Hibana are a 1000 times more useful in secure area. You couldn't be more wrong.
---
Reasons I dislike playing with most Castle mains. Occasionally i play with one that doesn't put them in dumb places but most of the time I'm not so lucky.
---
Go to the sub reddit and then click the 3 dots and click add flair
---
One of the SAS would be cool
---
Thanks
---
Some people like being alone. I dont, I play with friends, but not everyone wants to and that's fair. Shouldn't need others to enjoy a game.
---
It’s good to go.
---
I don't understand banning clash. She's picked so little I'd be fine dealing with her that 1/50 times she's picked. And would rather ban cav because fuck cav
---
You’ll either have to reverify files or completely delete Siege and reinstall it.
---
This is really well made and relatable. 
---
I always do my best to keep track of my deaths and learn from them. And to also laugh at my mistakes.... specifically when my aim decides it wants to be terrible.
---
It's in the TTS, the operator is super strong
---
I actually don’t mind fortress. Why don’t people like it? Im only a mid gold player tho so I’m probably not the best person onto be judging maps.
---
You can only buy a small selection of guns at Walmart, only hunting rifles and shotguns
---
Ohhh ok thanks
---
Hello Relaxiles, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Majority of Reddit’s posts are reposts bud sorry to say
---
I agree with the point about Skyscraper but I’m not 100% on the balanced part of Outback and it might be different at higher elo and on different platforms. I mostly just solo and have stayed at G1 all season and play on console
---
It wasn't banned in the US, it's literally just a random R6 ad that someone posted
---
It's not
---
How about instead of bitching that you don't like a certain map for arbitrary reason you just ask the devs to add a fucking selectable map pool like in CSGO. There are 22 maps in this game. 22 is too high of a number to have a forced map pool for casual and comp. Chances are some of the maps you enjoy aren't in casual and/or comp. 
---
How hard can it be to add a customized map pool? Seems like such an easy thing to do compared to the other shit they have to code and balance.
---
To be fair most maps just look great with such a high level of detail
---
Agree
---
How is it terrible? Just too dark and the haunted area is confusing but I don't think it's terrible
---
woah
---
You deserve that for playing ela with the shotty
---
Lord?

What's wrong with chaotic? The fact that no two games are ever exactly the same is a key feature of Siege.

it's greyed out because it thinks nothing is there

All hail his greatness.
---
The layout is just boring
---
Now thats how you make an Ad I don't wanna skip!
---
Aim only gets you so far and pros have the best game knowledge. Not to mention that the strats they use are way more complex than what's used in ranked. They also have analysts and coaches whose job is to prevent them from losing. All of these things combined push them a few steps above everyone else.
---
It's not blocked. Don't believe everything you read on reddit
---
You've won me over with your compelling argument.

It looks unfinished.

A lesion once hit me with impact and then a gu mine. both were accidents.

i loaded my supernova and proceeded to kill 2 attackers and defused the bomb. was a great game, teammates were chill on voicechat, i also got to show off my echo headgear as mvp.
---
It's not banned in America, this is just a click bait repost with a false title
---
*wipes tear*
---
I solo all the time on pc and never run into any trouble. It's far more peaceful than console.
---
Exactly
---
Idc but uh I just didn’t even know it was out and it does seem like the thing we would ban
---
You are the specific reason it is not fun to play ranked at anything below silver.
---
This is a meme right? I thought champions was only 5000+ MMR
---
The idea of pro-league isn't a bad idea. However, how Ubisoft is handling it is. I've given Ubisoft money for skins.... by the way I'll still waiting for my Alibi elite... for fuck's sake Ubisoft just announced some new skins for Gridlock and Mozzie. But, Alibi... we get four skins (foreskins, see what I did there?). Sorry, I had to rant t that.  B
---
But, yes, if you're a watching the pro-league you're giving Ubisoft exactly what they want. Money.
---
Skins make no difference if you take time to learn the game. You do not need to identify each person you kill. A kill is a kill. As time progresses youll be able to identify whoever afterwards. The skins add a fun twist to a competitive shooter. First world countries wear uniforms, ISIS, domestic terrorists, mass shooters do not wear a uniform, yet they’re still a menace to society.
---
oh that sounds about right sorry i don’t know any fallout just the map
---
ha, sometimes they’re pretty nice
---
I play with my buddies on xbox since I have more friends there. I usually tend to notice more toxicity. 
---
Lot of team killing, not that I dont get that on PC. It just seems few and far between. 
---
With my own personal expierence I'd say xbox was more toxic than PC.
---
I mean, if that’s what gets you off, but congratulations on ruining the game for others.
---
Ikr, after being team killed by toxic groups dozens of times I just throw a c4 or frag at the start of a match whenever I see people with names that start the same
---
I find castling myself in the train cars on theme park most rewarding

For said reason.

That's pulse...

Just happened to me, for 3 rounds I was by myself
---
Yeah as someone who solo queues a lot I feel you and I always wonder what my rank would be if I had a consistent solid five stack all the time. One season I might just bite the bullet and use the discord instead of solo queueing even though I’m sure I’ll deal with a lot of assholes. At the same time though, I just don’t really feel there’s any way to measure the individual’s impact accurately. There are different roles of course, but also there are a lot of times where the K/D is very deceiving if you’re using it to tell who does and doesn’t deserve blame/credit.

Why is it blocked for them?

Like im a gold 4 how the fuck am i gonna beat a platinum 3 and a diamond even when they have coppers in their team (that propably were not coppers)
---
I do like the cosmetics and the like, but I like Siege for Siege. The cosmetic stuff is just a nice addition.
---
I'm pretty sure Casual highly leans towards newer maps though.  It's insane how often I get a non-original map in Casual.  If it were up to me I'd play all the OG maps + Coastline and Outback.
---
Politicians ~~and media~~

when you haven't clutched a single round of 48 rounds, it's also maybe you and not only your m8's

Because it's a giant box filled with smaller boxes, there's nothing really interesting about it. Tons of useless rooms too.

It's essentially just a prettier version of New Hereford base. They both suck.

so can blackbeard if you quick peak taking pop body shots rather than his shield and Monty can be nitroed or got behind and knifed in 1v1. all are counterable and all are counterable in 1s or 2s

This same video was posted from Ubi's youtube a while ago and it's blocked in the US. This video isn't on [Ubisoft North America's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBMvc6jvuTxH6TNo9ThpYjg/videos).
---
Ironically, you guys are the ones making shit up
---
Boy I'm sure glad my ability requires the enemy to make the first move

Oh man, I miss that game. Sadly siege took a sharp turn and became a very different game.

Possibly
---
Great theory lol. I'll give you props it's a unique excuse
---
Wait what the fuck, isn't champion uhhh, 6k or something?
---
First time I saw this I didnt think it was rainbow.
---
They have, people are using adapters to use mnk on console
---
disagree, I love chalet, the rotations are wonderful
---
it's operator Lion . He scans the entire map for 2 seconds . If you move during the 2 seconds . Your location will be compromised by 5 very fast pings for 5 seconds

Very ironic that its blocked in the US...

brace yourself for when new season starts.

I'm in Diamond rank. Every day I'm able to complete at most 3 games out of 10 because of DDOS. It's a complete joke and demotivating. Also yesterday I lost a game for some reason after the server crashed. The abandon sanction message appeared mid game. Big OOF !

How in the fuck did you hit that thing? I didn’t even see it the first time

Is this real? XD I want it to be real.
---
Same with theme park. I don't know why they didn't just take out Hereford, skyscraper and chalet. They are imbalanced and not fun. At least theme park and fortress are fairly well balanced
---
You have said the same comment like 3 times on different posts

They're both very toxic. TBH I think Ubisoft really screwed up taking as long to start to curb the toxicity as they did. I don't think we're going to get a less toxic Siege experience until Siege 2 comes out in 2025.

This would be the worst ted talk ever, people would want their money back

Well... they already increased the duration of his ability, but I think that this isn't enough. Probably you're right because right now he's useless for me.

Yeah on ps4 the game is pretty much shit in the high ranks but I just mainly play ESL ladder and different ESL tournaments

Okay but now seriously, she is pretty annoying but I'd hate it if she gets disabled again

Clash still looks like she's disabled.

Joking

They can only choose one gamemode to focus on and bomb was the most balanced. If they switched to secure area then the operators would all need to be rebalanced around it and some would be useless in different modes

There should only be serious maps in ranked. It can stay in unranked and casual.

Ranked is not pro league. In ranked you have to defend three sites if you win defense. That means you have to go to one shitty site (and on Chalet both shitty sites are impossible to defend, without exaggeration, they're not defendable against evenly skilled opponents.) in pro league, a team can rotate between two sites for all of the match.

Make one of the walls all the operators icons or separate it between two walls one being attackers the other being defenders. Or you could always find out his favourite operators and design the walls around them.

I have two passports which allows me to serve in two different militaries, it might be the same case.

To answer you question, I think that ubisoft should add a Norwegian branch.

Yeah never get to defend first it’s so annoying but jackal is a good ban for you because it sounds like you play the majority of the game off site but jackals get tunnel visioned ALL THE TIME, try going on an alt account without banning jackal and see how easy the majority of jackals are when you get tracked especially if you play in a team.

Had something similar, but with 10 recruits. It was one of the best matches I had.

Every time I go to ranked, my fear is to play on this shitt* map

What does this glitch do?

Yeah same here not fun going in solo and a groups of 4 cunts tk you got banned for 30 minutes and all I wanted to do was play siege and honestly I gave up on siege for console

Thanks for the tip, I’ll try it sometime. 
---
Yeah I play *deep* roam. My role in my squad is to make the enemies’ lives living hell. I have the most map knowledge in the squad, and I’d say I’m probably the best in terms of raw skill, so I deep roam way out of objective and then my team calls out where attackers are breaching from and pushing. And I hunt them down. The reason I hate Jackal so much is because I play fast ops like Jager, and usually I have run *literally everywhere* on the map harassing attackers, so if I’m tracked I have no clue where I’m being scanned from. My footprints are down every major hallway and staircase and so I’m usually forced to run around an empty room, which punishes my team because a big part of our team composition and strat depends on me being able to pick off attackers by rotating and giving callouts as the “outside” man.
---
oh that's a big rip if lvl 169 and just got my first black ice for the L85
---
[F9] Perhaps
---
They announced exactly this. Soon squads will get rff at the same time. Maybe i am getting wooshed right there
---
I downloaded it a while ago. I don’t remember how to set it up, try deleting and reinstalling the app, because it automatically connects to the nearest PlayStation on the same network
---
Chill there are people who owns the game and its playing more than 400 hours and still sucks. Map knowledge and timing is the key for this game.
---
Yeah I agree with Warden as he’s so situational. I think it would be cool if he could counter Nomad by being able to see her airjabs easier. Blitz IMO is fine at the moment. I mean his shield covers his upper body including his head when he’s chasing someone and he’s pretty quick so he’s hard to kill as it is. Especially on console he’s horrible.

---
Why is this banned in my country?
---
Didn’t know 5 year olds played siege
---
Just play unranked, simple
---
If I had a dime for every time I heard this. Yeah I know that's what it's for but when I can only play 7 seconds of a game it's hard to argue for it. We got spawn peeked and rushed and it was just so not enjoyable because that skill gap is so huge
---
Man I wonder what your favorite operator is...
---
All jokes aside this setup looks fuckin dope.
---
Those trap operators aren’t really meant for intel though. Kapkan is really meant to deal damage and potentially kill people on low health if they don’t watch out for traps. There would be no point in Alibi or Lesion if the red ping thing was introduced as Kapkan and Ela would be better. Ela is kinda meant to be an aggressive roamer that keeps track of her Grzmot mines to push people that set them off, or even throw them at people mid gunfight to give her the advantage. 
---
And yeah I kinda get where you’re coming from the Nomad, but I still personally think we should be able to atleast hipfire when on the ground.
---
The main reason is that the dot is much bigger then the one in the holo or reflex. This means that if your fighting at long range, it can actually cover what you're trying to shoot. 
---
but like, yeah, it's still a personal preference.
---
False advertising. There is no House.
---
Yeah this works for me as well
---
Although siege is the only MP game I even play anymore
---
Thats just ubisoft.
---
The pool changes every season. Some skins get added, others get removed.
---
AFA I’m aware, the loot pool depends on when you **get** the pack, not when you **open** it.
---
It's a middle finger to loyal players basically
---
What site are you using?
---
Good art mate
---
Could use a darker pencil or marker next time
---
And a little smaller user name would be better. I would recommend you to follow Sau Siege and take inspirations from his drawings and make your own content.
---
Overall great attempt mate!
---
I play as recruit on ranked and tear shit up pretending that I'm a PMC / Merc under team rainbows paycheque
---
Mm yes toxic siege player
---
It's cos you are using Nomads AK, the firerate on that thing is abysmal
---
A good headset is good also. This is a game where I really recommend sound whoring. Always check your corners. But literally just more time will help you get better. Learning maps and how to traverse them and better yet how other players traverse them. Lastly start with a easier operator and use a fully automatic weapon. So maybe Blackbeard, Fuze or Finka for attacking. For defending I’d say Rook, Castle or Clash.

I'm confused to where this issue with gun licences is coming from, did a dev use that as an excuse? Because it was proved in court prior to Ubi's case that as long as you don't use the official nomenclature, using the likeness is fair game. It's a loophole that CoD, BF, and a lot of other shooters have used for years.
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Yes it's a work in progress where everytime you log into this gane you get brainwashed to be non toxic it's basically a DLC for R6S but its a work in progress for now 
---
This is just a preview
---
Anything is possible man
---
It's alright hahaha, how could you know that? At least, for now, he's exploring the game archives to leak stuff. Sincerely, I expect that he keeps that way, giving the doubt benefit, but his historic isn't that good like I've said above
---
lmao

Why is it banned in the US? Also thank you

Can you come over and stick your finger in my ass?

Put cameras in every corner of his/her room, then put a 1 way mirror so only you can see him

That is why I'm here.

A lot of people can't control the recoil on the Scorpion. Nice ace!

god forbid a multi million company get their own server!  wow thats beyond unacceptable.  might as well just stop playing then or just play at silver level.

On many maps its how you handle thatcher thermite

giving it real life perspective feels odd and kinda unhuman to film it in a graveyard

I like fortress personally and the way it plays
---
First of all, the blast won’t kill him giving him time to react and try to shoot back.
---
Second of all, you are LITERALLY the opponent. There is no obligation to not being toxic, as you can see by people spamming EZ in all chat every time they win. Some people argue toxicity actually tilts the enemy team, which is “part of the game”. Killing someone with your gadget while they lack situational awareness is probably one of the least offensive things you can do in the game. 
---
Third, if you’re a Mozzie and you’re sitting on your drone outside objective you deserve whatever is coming to you. Stop blaming the enemy for being toxic when you’re putting yourself in shitty situations. Play smarter, Mute the enemy, practice not getting tilted.

Second, realise that ranked doesn't matter and 9/10 it's essentially still just casual, above g1 people start taking it seriously but below that it doesn't matter, take some deep breaths and don't get panicked, I was once in your situation too

Ah, my bad. I didn't realize it was part of the previous years event. I assumed it was a glitch because of the barrel being distorted.

They can't  find out that there was an exploit in zhe first place

It’s not that simple, I’m sure there is reasons they outsource to Microsoft servers. Just think that people are breaking laws to win a video game really sad tbh.

Yeah, it got removed. The cheating problem in this game is just tiring.
---
I'd like Fabian to be my announcer and to tell me I'm shit whenever I lose a round
---
Yeah because it doesn’t need any buffs.
---
I think it’s a pretty unrealistic operator, like more realistic than alibis prisms,  but still, titanium is very heavy, (not to nitpick or anything) so I mean if they were plastic, yeah probably, I could believe that, but if they already have record breaking speeds of getting rid of gadgets, then they should just be like the lightest material possible, it’s not like they’re gonna get shot or anything. Just a nitpick though.

If you want a custom one once in the flair selection press edit in the top right, you write whatever you want and emotes are made by using : and then what you want. (Ex. :Ash:)
---
Are you inviting them all to the same game then winning? If so then idk other then restarting the game and Ubisoft club and hoping it'll pop up.
---
it is still possible for sure, but not every Round like in casual or newcomer haha, it's even funnier when the people in baove plat 2 getting destroyed by a 5 stack which plays Lion Dokki Finka Ying and Blitz in the first round and then seeing them being scared with Kapkan Frost Doc Rook  and Ela in the next round
---
I threw a twitch drone right as it started showing the killcam and instead of an mvp screen I got to drive my drone around the map normally. Then my next games I played the mvp screen was always just some random wall. I restarted my game and it fixed itself.
---
Better check your corners tho
---
Funny enough though Ubi promised back in Y2 to rework him and make him more viable.  
---
(That never happened though)
---
Nah man its just weird that this sub is CONSTANT with the thicc comments, its strange
---
People don't freak out over that unless it's the scary AR-15
---
Yeah, I know. I don't think you meant for people to turn it into this either. My comment is more aimed at those who are at the top of this post's comment section talking about how it's because of US politicians and stuff like that.
---
Because they lowered the MMR needed to make sure that the champion rank was working
---
Neeeeeeeiiiin!!!
---
He REALLY likes that hostage huh
---
Either make him a 2 speed or give P90. Unironically, the P90 isn't that great but the ACOG would make him a more versatile character while anchoring.
---
Oh sorry, thought you was talking about me.
---
Wow that's one horse face
---
Yeah, no thanks. I'd just keep using my Xim.
---
I understand that ours don't throw shrapnel, but they're still frag grenades
---
I really sucked
---
God that would be awful . lol 2 people flinching around in a firefight.
---
But other people don't play Ranked, some play Casual more.
---
This is a surprisingly common occurrence. It happens to me or my friends once or twice a month. Honestly nothing you can do. If you do lag out of a match tho restart the game. It just helps.
---
Concussions explode without shrapnel
---
Are you signed in
---
I used to get something similar to this on EA servers. Something to do with ports not being correct. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful but it might be something worth googling.
---
What would his shrapnel do, like 15 damage? All he really needs is to be 2 speed and quieter/faster deployment time
---
console OMEGALUL
---
Yes I am
---
I’ve always brought up the idea of the turret being able to shoot through shields as penetration damage. This would both give a reason to play tachanka as well as balance out shield pushes
---
That's kind of silly. Smoke can place his area denial on demand from range, no smoke is going to have his charges killed. Goyo, however, can't control his area denial and it can easily become uselessly triggered. No one cares about the DPS, you can't stand in Smokes smoke as much as you can't stand in Goyo's fire, it's the same area denied. The only thing that Goyo has over smoke is the gun.
---
But 47 did exist. It just sucked. What the dude was saying is that people are more familiar with the AK-M which was produced in 1959 and used today.
---
In my conversations with him, he has stated that he will return with cheats.  Deplorable!
---
Buy Kontrol Freaks. They’ve improved my aim 10x. Takes some time getting used to but now I refuse to play any fps without them
---
Can it hold down a stream of fire from across the map without any issue? Don't think so.
---
Bullet goes off and entire team flinches
---
I believe this is correct, however it also did not work this season, at least for me, I won 8/10 and I still got placed high plat 2 when the max was supposed to be 3500
---
you mean a little bit too low?
---
Nice Call To Action, doesn’t say anywhere in the rules to not tell people to boycott/uninstall siege hnmmm?
---
This is not so very true. I am crying on the inside right now.

---
I got the meme but they're definitely not the same
---
At least the "leak" version let's us hear the winning animation music for the elite skin while the reveal trailer doesn't have it included.
---
I think because AK-47, was the first of its renditions. When Russia started to mass produce the gun, I’m sure a lot of people caught wind and started to call it that. Then more updated models and variations started to be released with different name like the AK-M, but because AK-47 was trendy people still used that old name. 
---
It’s like calling and IPhone an “IPhone” rather than the current model IphoneX. 
---
And I’m sure entertainment and media has abused the name AK-47.

God I love reverse friendly fire. If someone intentionally TKs me I run in front of them the entire match so they keep killing themselves.
---
That’s beautiful
---
I feel you. Took me to pass like level 150+ before trying ranked. I still do my placements every season but I don't enjoy it and I exclusively play casual the rest of the time, it's much more fun to me. If people are being asshats, I can at least leave without penalties or ruining innocent teammate's game.
---
I mean I value my money lol. Don’t see why I need to spend more than $50-100 on virtual pixels that u can’t even re-sell
---
It would be better if they discouraged cheating by banning people rather than getting rid of gadgets or operators.
---
This is actually a really bad example lol
---
It is Miras Pro League Skin, its old. We will get in Y4S3 a Pro League Pack for IQ, Tachanka, Warden and Nokk
---
Well, it stops the stacking but it wont stop the intentional throwing and smurfing. It will probably increase the value of low rank accounts. So it really just makes another problem while solving one issue
---
as varsity said, those bans are mostly spice picks, and not actually necessary, also echo is an inherently broken operator as he can knock you off of plant in the last few moments of a round, and if you’re going to talk about blitz being broken, what about montagne? if the bomb gets planted and montagne is still alive, the team with montagne should win 80% of the time, unless it’s a 3v1 or more. The reason you ban these operators is not because of some tactical strats you’re about to pull off, but because they’re inherently overpowered. You also can counter these operators, with a smoke or an IQ, same as with Pulse or Valkyrie, and if you listened to varsity’s video, he clearly states that for the map specific bans, it was just him repeating the popular bans over and over, so the map specific ones are more of a spice pick.
---
I've definitely seen other people on here saying it was disabled on Xbox. I hope it gets fixed soon.
---
Hope to find some diamonds tonight
---
you can't be kicked in ranked.
---
You wanna see petty wait till you run into someone like Bard.- or his buddies, guys who get to plat 2 or even diamond then deliberately derank to copper 2 so they can boost kills.
---
I thought thats from Goyo's pro set

Fair, fair.

---
I can't tell if it's cool or stupid 
---
But either way I'm gonna buy it if it's not only in alpha packs so that enemies see that as they die
---
Nerfed but still really good. Like the SMG-11, once you get used to the increased recoil, the fire rate still makes you a monster.
---
Esspecially since the horizontal recoil is still practically nonexistent, so you only need to learn how much more to pull down.

Sadly your work is underappriciated! But great job!

I'm in no way saying clash is op or broken but I am saying she's not a fun op to go against unless you're Thatcher, Ash, or Zofia. If I tried to melee her she can still switch weapons while her shield is being knocked back(Which is a horrible decision on Ubisoft's part tbh)

---
I'm pretty sure she had impacts before and it gave her way too much mobility.  
---
The shotgun isnt OP by nature, but in the hands of a skilled, knowledgable, and patient person, it can wreck.  Same can be said with any weapon in the game.  
---
The problem with her scorpion was the fact that it was insanely accurate with a huge mag, and high rate of fire.  I think if they dropped the mag to say 25-30 and buffed the recoil a bit more that would possibly be reasonable.  
---
I actually prefer how she is now.  She can still be deadly with a skilled player but isnt one of those "make a bronze player as good as a plat" type operators.
---
This task a grueling one
---
Lol someone doesn’t like clash and I just burst fire with clash man. Makes it more accurate. You must not play with Mira’s gun either

TCSG 12 does that to me way too often. But when I am on the receiving end bodyshots turn into headshots :(.
---
I don't know the exact reasoning, but I do know the prisma uses a different model and texture then the the actual character model, It's less detailed and not modular like the character models are, so the uniform, Headgear, and weapon of the prisma is one solid piece with one singular texture. Having it mimic the player's loadout would likely require rebuilding it in a way that the game recognizes it as a 11th, 12th, and 13th player entities. Which could cause problems as the game was built for 5v5 matches.
---
Ok i will. Thanks for the help.
---
They aren't allowed. It just can't be detected :(
---
&gt; After the most recent mass shooting all the other media outlets ran stories challenging or refuting Trump's blaming of video games.
---
Because it's Trump. They didn't do the same with Hillary, Sanders, Biden, etc. They didn't do the same when it was Dem politicians trying to push legislation in the 90s and early 2000s.
---
Most media outlets don't give a shit except to drive their agenda.
---
This stupid hysteria isn't new. It existed in the 80s and 90s and media has ALWAYS sucked at combating it. What's funny is they're a far bigger problem with mass violence than video games are. Many of these pieces of shit want to broadcast their political messages and the media obliges them every fucking time, making them infamous as well. Let these people die in obscurity, they clearly don't care if they're seen as evil, fame is what some of them want and it doesn't matter if it comes in the form of infamy.

Well what if people cant physically play with controller and they buy xim because they cant afford pc to be able to play? e.g missing a thumb
---
EDIT: Do you want to block them from playing video games?
---
I wanna say it isn't allowed, and is a bannable offense. If you suspect someone is using M&amp;K, report their account to the console, not the in game report system
---
In my first or second round with Kaid who I got today, I literally sniped a Blitz. Wtf is with this.
---
It was too late :(
---
You can on ps4
---
I figured it was blocked because of a region-lock, not because of government. This is typically the case with blocked videos. South Park on Comedy Central's site was blocked in Canada for some time, even though the show airs to Canadian viewers.

Really missed old Hereford as well :'(

No I can't. There's premade settings but I can't fully remap the controls. And if you mean remapping the buttons in the system settings then that's what I'm against, I shouldn't need to go into my PS4's system settings to change something that should already be in the game itself

Everytime there is a hostage situation make sure to hand it over to the police force for effecient extraction.

&gt;How does chalet compare to favela or university or plane or house
---
It's not as bad as house but not much better these days.
---
&gt;general statement
---
"apples and oranges" doesn't warrant a very specific response. Destruction alone gives each siege map way more replay value than any csgo map has (theoretically) yet decades old maps are still being played and no one complains. You know why? Because csgo comp / ranked isn't full of casuals, who don't understand that they're playing a competetive shooter.
---
Ohhh by the way the other comments sounded it seemed like they just reduced the time it takes to recharge and it’s duration. My bad.
---
I still think there shouldn’t be any movement penalty tho
---
This is definitely worth the money
---
My idea is double tap the joysticks
---
Thanks! Last time I did just that mistake :D
---
I agree its ridiculous also its an smg sorry just really grinds my gears
---
Fire Aspect, eh? Sounds like a Capitao clone to me
---
That made the game look super duper dope
---
Just copy the game files to Ubisoft/Ubisoft game launcher/Games/
---
Fixed
---
Exactly. If you have Thatcher,ash, Zofia,capito. I was Blackbeard and I main thermite so half of the time there's nothing I can do. It feels impossible to clutch a 1v anything when she's present
---
It’s still amazing tho
---
There are currently no limitations and the only limitations on the way(September 10) are that you can’t squad up with anyone that isn’t within 1,000 MMR of you.
---
The reason for this is that you get a lot of people boosting by deliberately bringing down their team’s average MMR to match up against people they can easily shit on. You might see a couple gold 2’s with a plat 1 and a bronze 1 match up against your team full of gold 2’s for example. Or a full team of four plat 2’s and a copper 4 up against a full team of gold 1’s and 2’s.
---
Things like that happen all the time right now and sometimes the bronze is some legit bronze they found but sometimes it’s a copper 4 that’s really platinum or diamond and deliberately deranked so they could do this.
---
I want the banana skin!
---
There is absolutely no reason for her to have her original recoil back because that shit was disgusting in every way.
---
Although her recoil now is a bit harsh, I wouldn’t want her old recoil again.
---
Oh I love it
---
Why is it fire aspect and not flame😂
---
I've thought of similar ideas Idk why ubisoft don't do that 
---
Give us the option to hold in/double tap the analog sticks to lean 
---
Or just set it so that when you stop aiming down sights you'll keep leaning
---
I'll be the one apologizing, I noticed too late, mixed them up in my head :(
---
Is a 10 speed if you run and jump
---
I don't want Ela meta all over again . Agree
---
And for people say that "I can't kill her" . I can already
---
I thought that was some kinda safe lock and got excited.
---
No. It’s the screen and controller combined, no PlayStation, no play
---
And the fact that it has white accents instead of black, (to look like the actual banana) and the slight fade at the back..
---
Ela's weapon recoil is really bad right now. I am not a skilled player and I found myself struggling with the smg and play more with her shotgun. They increased the recoil for a reason I'm sure, but at least they could reduce the bullets, as you said, and reduce the recoil a little bit, not as much as, in the beginning though.

Copy and paste my ubi files from steam directory to ubi’s dirictory on my pc? 
---
Won’t this then screw up steam launching my version of the game as steam won’t see it.
---
Is there a bit of detail you can give or how I do that?
---
She should at least have controllable recoil, it doesn't matter how much damage her gun does if she misses all her shots
---
Nice?
---
Damn on a controller? I’m impressed
---
why
---
As a fuse main I am very happy to see this
---
Ah okay mate fair play. As long as you enjoy it that’s all that matters
---
Only on console lmao
---
She would be balanced with old recoil lower fire rate and 31 ammo mag
---
So, like, a sledge hammer but it can go though reinforced walls?

Why would I lie about that?

Lol me too
---
Too inconsistent.  Imagine trying to knife someone quickly because you hear their teammate.  Naturally spam the joystick to get that knife kill but guess what, now you're leaning instead!  And that's just the right stick.  
---
Then you try to sprint away and you accidentally double tap and instead of getting away, you're leaning left!  
---
It's just not feasible with this generation of controllers.  Maybe next gen they'll come with stock paddles, then maybe they could do something.
---
Somebody watches Godly ;) lol

Ah yes, the circle of life

It’s pretty known that’s why we always ban Mira on chalet

Hello my little ood-de-lalies.
---
Actually that could be a cool concept, and operator that can increase their speed temporarily, like a 2 armor 2 speed with an ability to become a 3 speed for like 6 seconds
---
No, not correct.   They've denied that it was because of the, "meme status" in a reddit balancing team AMA, answered by: /u/xxLupus
---
Not making fun on console, just saying stuff like this doesnt happen on pc because of the faster flicks you can do with mouse and key
---
Personally I think the immunity to flashbangs should be a passive ability, and the smoke is the special
---
Buy the game on Uplay . Create a folder named "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege" in the location above . Copy the game files from steam to this folder . Open uplay and click "Locate game folder" . Select the game folder where you copied your game files
---
Nothing to do with the meme status.  They've denied it in an AMA.
---
That movie was pretty epic. I agree wholeheartedly.
---
no?
---
Casual has a different ruleset, you can't choose your defending position, there are more maps...
---
Casual is casual, unranked will be uranked.
---
Pretty sure you’ve got to stay over 3500 if you want to start in plat next season. Otherwise it wouldn’t make sense lol
---
Considering how little damage the weapon does I feel like the magazine size is somewhat needed, plus do we really want people only getting headshots with minimal effort again?
---
I mean its still a smg just like bandits mp7
---
They can, because it is not DDoS
---
They already addressed this issue in the [top issues blog post](http://rainbow6.com/rainbow6) saying that is a random server error
---
You can not just attack an Azure cloud center so easily, and even if your DDoS attack would be successful they have good programs to trace back the attack within minutes
---
I only experienced it once when my five stack squad was about to lose a casual match
---
And even if it is on purpose it might just be some kind of glitch or lag switch that will be fixed during Ember Rise
---
Ow that hurts
---
Found the same image [here](https://www.picbear.org/media/B1ZJyReApSr) where it says its fan-made. So most likely not. Also the fact that it says 2019 invitationals that were played almost six months ago is a pretty big giveaway.

He should be able to use reinforcements to craft more armor while keeping the same speed

That's true, and it's pretty unfortunate that everything needs to be political (Even though games like CS:GO do have israeli ops for their most famous map, and most fps games has at least one israeli weapon like the Galil, Desert Eagle, Tar-21, and also Ash is an israeli op, but she doesn't serve on the IDF) but yeah at least I can make a custom one :)

Your being patronising to everyone else in these comments, saying that their opinions are wrong, with more toxic ways of saying so, and coming across as arrogant and snobbish.
---
Now that you’ve had your inquiry answered, that house is being taken out in Ember Rise, do you mind telling me why you’re being so rude? Your earlier post suggest the opposite.
---
Every time
---
So it is literally less overpowered than that lol
---
I play Zofia a ton and I can say I’ve only successfully done it maybe 2 times. The problem is just how long the animation is. Even if I have good cover fire from teammates the enemy team usually has time to rotate out and get me or simply just throws an impact and I’m toast. I will say though that the two times I did withstand made a big difference. The first time the enemy team would’ve clutched and won if they’d finished me off, but got distracted and I came up from behind.
---
Lmao this is all this guy does. You disagree with his AWFUL statement then he will give you some toxic response and block you like a pussy.

I think they changed it lower so they could see the championship rank work for testing

Too bad Ela is a weak OP nowadays
---
The spray and the invitational sign is a huge sign that it's fake, but maybe some of this will be possible in the future

I would have rather her elite be something more a kin to her role as the team rainbow design lead for weapons and gadgets. But I’ll take this over the theme revolving pulse or ela

What about Caveira

Looks like a CPU

It ok I feel ya

Lmao did you see what he put. He said you keep using that word. Which one is he on about? Because you haven’t used any of those words a lot....
---
As i said, next season is gonna have one, but I doubt for poses and gadget skin, as much as they are beautiful ideas, this doesn't fit Ubi style.
---
Now that you mention that it is kinda weird.
---
honestly, you did great. I'm level 176 and I'd say the only difference between us is our sensitivity difference. my sens. is 100/100/37
---
69
---
High sensitivity and good flicks a rare combo which leads to good clips
---
Yay
---
Wtf is up with that chibis face
---
It would also make elite skins not as special if you could do that
---
Very interested in your upcoming results then.

This has gotten me killed so many times.

I’ll break the habit one day.

I had played 600 matches and I usually get 11 mmr per match, not 1

It usually helps if you put it through the hostage.

What caused your love for twitch?

Yeah, but Ubi already got like 40€ or more from me for the next 2 season because of G2 set and the premium BP, so they still profit.

Aight, first of all: if you think my mains are overpowered, quit right now. Secondly, I literally never stated an opinion, I said you missed.  Thirdly, I don’t care if you care about what I say, it’s a free country. Lastly, you should make opinions based on your own gameplay, not what other people think, that’s called bandwagoning

I’ve been DDoSed 7 times in a row today. It’s getting ridiculous. I’ll guess I’ll just create a smurf and go play in Silver.

why the fuck u got an intel stock cooler on some random piece of metal
---
I'm worried it will be sadly too strong. Kapkan already has a decent win rate,with Goyo and Kapkan combo being too strong,Kapkan might get nerfed for being picked too often and then also winning too often.
---
Come on man, 100 more to get the champion!
---
I really enjoyed it until the end. Been meaning to watch the movie that replaces the end.  Apparbetly their funding was cut and they basically had enough to do like 10 minutes of content so they stretched repeated scenes into two last eps and barely explaining anything that was suddenly happening out of nowhere
---
Welp, hats off to you, that’s impressive if you can pull off plays with that strategy. I usually stick to the smaller rooms, as people don’t usual expect someone to close themselves off, but I’m not the best Caveria player either.
---
If we’re doing crossovers just imagine Marcus Fenix with a crouch run ability and the primaries of Lancer (chainsaw) and Old Lancer (knife).
---
The secondaries could be gnasher and pistol maybe
---
So uncivilized.
---
If she doesn't I'm gonna skeng Yannis Mallat.

Thanks for the free down bro

Did you look at the balancing comment I created? Maybe it will change your mind, you can always give a bit more information to why you think it is op, it will be appreciated :)

Depends on the season. But currently Gold 3.
---
Audio only...the sounds of trying to capture B flag  domination Nuketown BO1.
---
Silver, but playing on AZN servers as a native English speaker is rough
---
That would be acctuly prety neat buff for tachanka
---
So about Ela's shotgun. The Carbine is fine I agree with as it doesn't have a recoil diamond. But the FO-12 already  is one of the lowest damaging shotguns in game. It only does more damage than most at mid range but is abysmal compared to every other shotgun at long ranges. Even with a extended barrel. It's not overpowered, nor is it even that powerful. It's a God of CQC but past that it's very much just like every other shotgun at ranges.
---
i knew it wouldn't take long until someone make it
---
Shhh!
---
I mean, I’m already resistant.  Just not very resistant.
---
Monty's usually get bullied. This is one of those cases.
---
Im not too worried about it as they could prob make a small patch aside from changing the whole character if the strat turns out to be too strong. They could simply just make it so kapkan could not put his bombs in doorways in which goyos shields are in.
---
Yeah,i see many cav players sticking to smaller rooms but cav is also very effective in bigger rooms. Like mentioned,the shotgun can be used to open every hatch at the top floor of Hereford. I hardly see any teammates roaming there to protect objectives like child bedroom meaning if i hear someone else on the top floor,i know that it is an attacker. And then i have 3-4 hatches to drop into different rooms and surprise enemies too.
---
You still did a great job
---
Plat2
---
Lol you're afraid of an f2 nerf. You also rely on maestro who quite literally has one of the best defensive weapons. I definitely don't need you advice seeing as you only use top tier ops to win. (Btw learn the difference between "good" and "op" I never said they were overpowered I just know you don't like challenges)  Taking a moral high road isn't going to help you bud. Also I've made my own opinion and it's that clash would be a better attacker over a defender.
---
Bow with Fire Aspect 2?????
---
I only added the damage nerf as a change to the less recoil of the smg.
---
This would make ela players choose between a strong semi auto shotgun at close range or more of a smg at longer distances.
---
Low-key most R6 gun skins are ugly.
---
Oh god yes. Id have a hayday.
---
Ooooo, smart! 🧐😃
---
Because it’s casual
---
Running on the latest drivers, and I'm reinstalling the entire game right now so I can't check the actual temps, but one thing I do know is that the CPU usage is sky high. It maxes out no matter what I do.
---
I heard of the 100% cpu bug before, but it seems like the fix was to limit your FPS, but how can I limit my FPS to 144 when it doesn't even reach it like it should?
---
What is your CPU usage when you play?
---
Thanks a ton for helping me out as well!
---
Why did you delete?
---
That’s what really kills her gun. You run the recoil up a wall and it can basically run at a 45 degree angle diagonally either way.
---
lol
---
Op good luck taking that on a plane
---
Plat 2 (PC), but your friend is right. If you sort by new, you will see.
---
Both
---
They have newcomer mode I guess lv50 is enough to get the hang of the game
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the only words that will be detected would be swear and racial words.
---
Excactly. The only downsides to those strats would be attackers sticking together and working together,but that's mostly the biggest issue when playing Cav as Cav was designed to hunt down lone wolves who don't pay much attention to their surroundings.
---
I haven't played with or against many Monty's at my level. Is this normal?? lol
---
The buff she deserves to be actually useful.
---
Risk and speed.
---
I'd rather loose a row than place them too low to blow the Mira.
---
Well you can get extra thwick if you really try.
---
You don't even wanna know how many times I've been 1 tapped through my shield as bb
---
It normal for maybe an impact or a nitro cell to get thrown but not to this extent, lol.
---
Yep. But also prolly the scariest attacker aswell
---
\*\*Neighborino
---
I mean you were reloading and when you do that you move the gun?
