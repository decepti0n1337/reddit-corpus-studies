Ok, but tbh, if I play her, I have more success with the shotgun

Lynx Australia mate

I'm verifying the files right now, I'll let you know.
---
In competitive play, you should almost always try to hide / save your prep phase drone. It's a huge waste to destroy that second drone for nothing.
---
Sheilds are pretty much useless at this point in time
---
I think you need to enter a code that comes with it

Same I only play her for the memes. And the staple gun is indeed meme material.
---
I don’t remember names but it is not the meusoc or r4c
---
But higher chance to hit the head cause more bullets
---
You have no idea what all i tried to get pro league  Lion that i missed because I'm dumb fucker.
---
Damn :c
---
I got a skin for the Russian LMG. I don't play Fuze much (or have Finka), and even if I did, I already have Black Ice for it.
---
Nope, the *extremely* fine movements of the reticle are fairly obviously mouse. The movement seems to be on a keyboard, though I’ve seen some really good movement from controller players. But you can tell from how the reticle moves in little tiny amounts when they’re idle.
---
How to solo defend kitchen hatch against Silvers that feed all of their hard breaching to a Maestro cam before deciding to take care of it
---
yeah you can use it on kapkan, its the same gun.
---
Why did I even buy the elite skin!
---
lol, yeah I just read his reply. And someone was in there trying to defend his sorry ass as well.
---
Look on the bright side you can’t get team killed by anyone
---
Sorry but no u
---
Monty is AMAZING if you know how to play him.
---
Literally had to turn the music all the way off for this event.
---
Goyo is the best attacker I’ve seen so far I think he’s better than fuze
---
Nahhhhh, I have two eyes and neither work soooooo, I'm right
---
I don’t. I just heard that they are horrible sorry if they’re still useful
---
No. At least I don’t think so
---
nothing can be done if you lost your setting you just have to remember them
---
Gameplay wise mozzie is as high as kaid playing so...
---
For real, I was both super angry and super excited when this skin got leaked. It’s so good.
---
&gt; Unless multiple people report they were disconnected at one time and cannot reconnect,
---
Unless they just take down the bloody server rather than wasting time individually attacking the other team. 
---
Almost all of the attacks are DDoS attackers not DoS, People just hire online bot services. No one is taking down servers by DoS attacks using their personal internet connection.
---
So if the code was already used it wouldn't work anymore right?
---
depends on elo  i would say
---
He’s probably on a budget or something
---
Thanks
---
That’s a surprise. Blitz used to be busted. Did they nuke the ADS or something?
---
Doing a 180 with two strokes? On a controller? Nah
---
Yes by a lot now it’s super slow
---
You have to double check the left, mid and right thicker parts of the reinforcements. sometimes they need a little bit of extra burning.
---
Big brain
---
Silvers is a bit too harsh, it was unranked vs plats  and high golds, I knew some of them from matchmaking (weu xbox Plat elo isn't exactly huge)
---
Lego Montagne doesnt exist...............................OMFG
---
But again, it’s barely a higher chance
---
All ops in game are 6ft
---
What an awful thing to do to the barricade man, he was just minding his own business.
---
r4-c and glaz gun
---
Good Luck in College
---
Uhh just know that there is a DDoS problem right now, but they're gonna fix it soon.
---
I should have this (on Ubisoft’s own stat tracker it says I have the penetration kills, which was my last one) but PlayStation dicked it out my hands. Was pretty disappointed tbh. Anyway, congrats and good luck in college!
---
Can you do this with an Xbox
---
We’ve seen this already
---
I'll concede you that Mouse get finer movements
---
for the rest, eh, gampads get aim assist to try and bridge the gap, and while KB get a button for each action, gamepads have a single input for moving, giving a direction of movement of 360° with the ability to sprint and walk on the same control, while on KB you ~~have~~ need 6 buttons to do that, and you need some hand gymnastics to use the walk button without hindering your movement.
---
also gamepads don't have the possibility for the fat finger, while on KB it's quite easy to open the chat instead of reloading or nuking yourself with an impact instead of defusing
---
the rest is force of habit really, M/KB has a lower skill floor when fighting against pad when it comes to shooting but that's mostly it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
plus how is it unfair? everyone has the option to play with gamepad or M/KB and getting a combo is really cheap, you can get a name brand wireless combo for less than 30 bucks, and a wired one for under 18
---
Imagine your an irl bomb squad with a second left on the clock you expect the bomb to wait for you to finish?
---
I didnt die at the end of the game we lost to the bomb defusing
---
I understand why they did it but next time they do it at least make the gadget useful and unique instead of, I am vigil but with worse guns and I see through smoke but am bad at it
---
np
---
Looks to me(on mobile atm)  that you shot the front of his headgear.  
---
In siege the gear does not count as the hitbox.
---
They plan to add in effects to indicate you hit his helmet not his head but they Havnt gotten around to that yet.
---
My boi meatball miestro
---
Not everybody wants to waste time buying a mouse and keyboard when they have a perfectly fine controller they like to use and even less people want to get good with mnk after playing console their whole life. Mnk on console is for pussies who want easy wins and don't wanna get good with a controller or don't wanna play on PC with all the godly players. Fuck off with that bullshit
---
I really need to practice vertical play strats like this more often.
---
I mean the thing is pro league skins for guns are not new. They always reuse the same 3 textures and apply it to different parts of the weapon. It's not considerably less work. It's the same amount of work required as swapping which part of the gun is white and which part is carbon fiber.
---
Where can I purchase this door.....it seems nice and secure
---
Idk about that......it just seems.............................
---
Like it would be out of place now....
---
It takes 12 hits to break soooo
---
I really like Mira and Valkyrie. Both are pretty good at providing information as to where the enemy is. Maestro is pretty similar but you can zap people
---
Wholesome
---
I am not saying they are bad I am saying they are boring to play I have maybe 2 hour on Goyo and i stopped because it was just boring to play with him (though honestly that was mostly because I hate his shotgun and have used the vector a lot)
---
I mean that one very clearly took more. Castle stepped up his game.
---
Castle buff
---
I agree I played maybe 2 game as warden and nokk was about the same they where useless and unfun
---
The daily challenges are on a 24hr timer, meaning one challenge is available per day. 
---
If you are unable to complete a challenge, then it will stay available until it is completed or canceled.
---
If you have no available slots, then you will no longer be able to accrue additional Daily challenges and you will need to complete the ones you have or delete them.
---
At game start, you have one slot available. (three with the season pass)
---
As you rank up, you will gain access to additional slots for a maximum of three. (five with the season pass) 
---
If you have additional slots from the Season Pass or Ranking, then you will be able to accrue more than one daily challenge, should you not be able to complete it.

New op leaked already
---
Let me in... LET ME IN!!!!
---
Is this on PC or console? Personally I haven’t noticed anything crazy compared to the past seasons - I have had my fair share of shots that I thought should’ve been headshots, but most times you have either hit their shoulder, neck, or gun (maybe even a hand if they were flashed). I have not however ever come across a shot not being registered at all, if that is happening to you it is probably connections based.
---
Right. The only time i ever blame this shit is on shields.  The amount of times i put a shot square into blitz or montys face and they are just fine is too damn many.. 
---
Shields are so buggy i understand its bound to happen but its frustrating.
---
Doesn't help they both have stupid tall helmets that make it harder to differentiate a miss headshot from their hand or face.
---
I do something similar by putting an evil eye in security room on border, and shooting out that main wall. It actually has won my team a few rounds.
---
He probably thinks anyone who anchors is a "camper". Braindead shithead
---
its just my noob brain thinking "even if i somehow screw things with the evil eye i can still use the impact to deny the breach"  also, if for some reason you take too long openning the floor you can use one impact and get back to site faster.
---
I got SAS pistol black ice 👍😎
---
It used to be that way, but for the past few seasons it’s gotten easier to win defense. Mostly because of the maps. Outback, Kafe Dostoyevsky, and the new Kanal are all so defender sided it hurts. Don’t get me wrong, I really like the Kanal and kafe reworks (hate outback), but they’re so bad for attackers. I mean look at the Kanal rework. Defenders no longer have to worry about objective facing windows, can rotate much more freely, and there’s more cramped corridors for them to hide in. Also let’s not forget about the new longer plant time for defusing. That hurt attackers more than defenders simply because defenders can now more comfortably force a plant, knowing it takes almost 50% longer to plant the thing. Sure it takes just as long to counter-defuse but the attackers job remains the same: watch the defuser and don’t let them near it - no easier and no harder than before.
---
One could argue that this is all just opinion, but I find a lot of people seem to agree. It’s too bad that I can’t recall the last time Ubisoft showed any statistics on attacker vs defender win ratios to confirm.
---
a weapon to surpass metal gear
---
Knowing Ash they'll give her an MK19 eventually.
---
No aim assist, not even on console, for this game headass. Also keyboards are easy to use once you get the hang of it
---
Np, her proleague set looks amazing.
---
Oh I have no issues with it being given to a new op. Let's give it. My only point of argument was about people considering the g36c to be weak or bad, which mathematically, it isn't.
---
Yeah in 3 weeks you can do that again.
---
How do you die because someone over scans someone? Yes they may be more alert that someone might be rushing them, but you have their exact location marked
---
Haven't enough people told you already?
---
Twitch Elite and Valk elite provide advanatges since the Elite Twitch drone and Elite Valk cams are more drab, neutral colours.
---
But hit box wise there is never a difference since hit box is skeleton only
---
why are they slamming it ? i though those ramming tools were pneumatic punctures ?
---
what was this all about ? is that doc or someone else
---
A motherfucking duplicate
---
Needs to be the elite
---
Looks like Lesion had a run-in with Dr. Herbert West
---
Lesion looks like he shot up too many Gu mines
---
It’s already been established you can’t comprehend anything more than 2 sentences long. Is there anything new you’d like to tell me?
---
Not to be rude but you can’t accuse someone of ddosing even if you know they do it without a vid o some sort of proof
---
Haven’t had this happen with the brief moments when I’ve actually been able to play Echo. God I hate the people that ban the same damn ops every game, lol.
---
As much as i REALLY want to agree with you, 10 seconds to a defender is MUCH more valuable than 10 seconds to an attacker. Though with a bit of extra time you could do some kickass strats
---
Not accusing if i know they do it
---
IQ has three very good weapons. It’s just personal preference. Nothing more.  
---
The differences between the two ARs is so small it doesn’t matter at all. And the LMG is a solid Choice if you Play more passively
---
Yes so much, Operation Health 2.0???
---
im sad plane isn't in casual anymore :(
---
I have the same problem, I kinda play her but when the enemy is kinda meh
---
it looks great, fantastic work! only one thing that bugs me, thats vigils number on his mask. its 707 not 709
---
\&gt;its nothing military themed
---
Seems convenient you're forgetting the Blackbeard (Vietnam), Jager (WWI German forces) Blitz (a nod to Panzerdivision/german tank squads) Thermite (Old FBI gear) Twitch (nod to French resistance fighters) Doc (Trench medic)
---
TAK-mocek123 does.

---
I agree with this 100%, the price has jumped up by around $4 because of this shit. Theres was nothing wrong with the previous system
---
owo
---
I got that for the sausage.
---
Not a fan considering that I the gold skin looks better on it.
---
I high key hate u for sharing this. Now this is gonna happen to me...
---
Something is likely up, there’s plenty of people who play games at colleges and some who even stream, I doubt the college would block internet access. And even if they did I don’t think it’s possible to block the chat via wifi, and even if it is I doubt people playing rainbow six siege on their own time would be something a college would need to control. 
---
As for a fix, I’d reccomend restarting the pc, verifying game files, reinstalling the game, reinstalling uplay, and running a disk check software (windows comes with one, forget the exact command but you need to open the command prompt to do it), and, if all else fails, contact ubi support and ask if they have a solution.
---
Do you know how long ago those were released? Besides the latest Mira elite skin, the most recent ones all have casual themed. Bandit, then Smoke, then Ela. Based on this, you would expect the next elite to be the same theme.
---
At that point I would’ve left the game
---
Well it’s strange because some of the sets are 7.99 and others are the 800 or so credits. Like it’s fine if you spend money on boosters, elites, etc because the credits add it up eventually, but I’d argue that people want to spend the money required and be done with it.
---
Tbf only the arms are white, so I don't think so.
---
Ok thanks so much. He's had this issue sense last August. We will try those.
---
stop posting clips when you don't know a player is cheating
---
because he 100% has no aimbot and he knew you were there..
---
Maestro has impacts????
---
Yup. This is the most frustrating part about the timed events. Just let me fucking pay for the individual items I want. I either hope that I get it with the one or two packs I get from the event or I have to spend $20 on a bunch of cosmetics I don't give a shit about to guarantee I get the one I want.
---
the whole team gets the warning if 1 does it.
---
Fuze is undisputably viable on every map and game mode.
---
Damn dude, upvoted
---
ok boomer
---
[removed]
---
if you know it’s a repost then why would you repost it
---
Of course. Good to clear barbedwire under hatches. (Obviously before the hatch is opened.) 
---
There are other uses for him if obj is in lower levels. But you gotta have someone watch your back.
---
Yeah, it’s such a good change.
---
I'll be rocking that same look very soon
---
Came across one early Pro League match on Oregon on Youtube a few months ago. The way they were playing was like what we get in Casual nowadays. Siege players' skill kevel has increased a lot.
---
Cause thats not undeniable proof that those players are using M&amp;K.
---
Even with the DDOS they need to track people between servers to prove that those players are connected to DDOS attacks. You cant just ban people for being on top of a player list.
---
Bruh moment
---
What’s going on here? Why is he banned?
---
I wonder why they didn't put doors in siege, they were in the other games.
---
Damn f them
---
after 300 hours R6 is the only thing i can get a confidence boost in and when i pull this kind of shit (which i do often) it makes me feel really good about myself :). sorry that sounded egotistical
---
or trap operators
---
F
---
no ur mom big gey
---
Bruh chill, blitz has only his shoulders exposed, and his flashes are so fucking annoying. He’s not really broken though, he’s just annoying as hell.
---
Play casual.
---
You kidding me , right ?
---
No
---
You can buy just warden bundle baka
---
(imgur link)
---
It will not let me
---
The visual recoil was brought down, making it easier to track
---
Same dude, earlier today I had a game like that, had to make sure my name wasn't there lmao
---
Ah . Another tachanka main :)
---
i got a smg 11 skin
---
Bro u/pretty_ordiary_mate isn’t a baby calm down
---
fixed lol
---
If you don't like the flashes play warden, and what do you mean "has only his shoulders exposed", have you ever tried aiming for his legs?
---
i had no idea, and ive been playing him alot recently i am grateful for this information.
---
But then I don't get a rank and players don't take it seriously.
---
this kind?
---

---
Finka is a Ukrainian not a Russian 
---
So this is true
---
Honestly same, just crossed 250 hours. I pull shit like that with bandit all the time. Makes me feel good about myself as well.
---
Because he's a fucking scumbag
---
One of the the most broken attackers and one of the worst defenders, I like the duality.
---
And how's that?
---
We live in a society
---
Maybe try running it in administrator mode?
---
It's like 700-900ish r6 credits for just 1. Go to the  in game shop tab, click bundles, look for warden's pro set, click on that and select buy or whatever it says and confirm it
---
I do play Warden but it’s retarded to have to stand still, and I said that he has his legs exposed
---
Rough, change mains then
---
Or explosives
---
If he turns a corner in your face, flashed, 2 seconds your dead, 0 counterplay up close
---
Lol what, you've always been able to just buy the single operator you want.. it's only cheaper to buy them in the bundle. 
---
If it "won't let you" then you're doing something wrong, check the dlc section of the steam store or the operator themselves section in-game.
---
Same error :/
---
I don't even know why i got downvoted
---
Holy shit hydra I know I haven't been on for awhile but if we have a PC seige team I'll hop back in
---
Makes me want to be a maestro main again
---
I got a bandit skin that changed the yellow colour on his jacket to red.
---
Buck, If he turns a corner in your face, shot, 1 second your dead, 0 counterplay up close
---
he accepted my friend’s friend request too, but failed to realize me and him had the exact same names... so he didn’t accept mine. the entire time he thought I was 1 person and was taking to myself.
---
Credit goes to u/sau-siege . Even if the watermark is there
---
also credit goes to [@cpt.sunstark](https://twitter.com/cpt_sunstark?lang=en) for the pictures on both sides
---
Yes but not to the same degree as a speedy European gentleman with a shield that has the ability to shoot flash bangs.
---
My dude. Bandit's Elite is based on the lore that he's an Undercover operative infiltrating a biker gang, specifically the one located in Club House. I mean yea it's casual themed I guess but it fits really well with his character. Just like Thatcher being a part of Operation Nimrod during the embassy attack.
---
Bitch you know you're Killa
---
and the gu shit
---
If they have already been released, 99.99% you've missed out on buying their pro league. They tend to be season limited. 
---
This week, or next? I believe warden, nokk, smoke and iQ pro league skins will come out. So I've heard. 
---
Last season was Mozzie, Gridlock, Ash and Rook. 
---
They will always appear in store when they are out.
---
Thank you!

Continue with team just immediately re adds you into the queue with the other players that also clicked on continue as team. It doesnt mean your'll restart a game immediately, especially since not every player clicks continue as team so it will still need to find more players.   
---
Also pro tip with matchmaking, if you dont find a game within 3mins, stop the queue and restart the matchmaking.
---

Well, Ubisoft is a publicly owned business that exist to make money

it says to shoot **attacker** drones, not ours. however, im not sure if shooting Mozzies drones contributes  or not, so maybe it does work.
---
Gu mines cancels out the finka boost. You need to pull it out first.
---
SNAP this is going into my play book
---
Wow, it's cool!
---
Well generally, gambling isnt good
---
Honestly so fucking dumb, I get Ubi is a company, but the amount of monetization they have is ludicrous, battle pass, season pass, operators, ESL skins, Pro League skins, elites, normal skins, limited time alpha packs.
---
been doing so for awhile now.. still hasn’t found any this sucks lol

Huh idk Those we’re the creators of this meme because I got it sent from a friend soo thank u for tagging in the creators I appreciate that 😊

oh ok

Reminds me of When Day Breaks (SCP-001)
---
Late Spooktober probs
---
Finka has a fucking book full of bonuses when it comes to her finka boost. 
---
* Three times per round, Finka is able to activate "Adrenal Surge" for 10 seconds. Adrenal Surge has a 20-second cooldown between activations.
---
* Adrenal Surge grants the following benefits:
---
* A temporary 20 health increase.
---
* The health buff is independent of the player's actual health capacity, allowing the player to be Overhealed beyond their normal health capacity.
---
* Even when this health buff is depleted, the other effects of Adrenal Surge will continue for the full duration.
---
* When the Adrenal Surge's duration is over, whatever temporary health is left will vanish. However, this will not reduce the Attacker's health below what they had initially.
---
* Recoil while Aiming Down Sights is reduced by about 45%.
---
* Time to Aim Down Sights is increased by 25%.
---
* Reload time for guns and gadgets such as Ash's Breach Launcher is decreased by about 15%.
---
* Movement in Barbed Wire is increased by ~40%.
---
* The effects of gadgets like Stun Grenades and Ying's Candelas are reduced by 50%.
---
* The effects of concussion gadgets like Ela's Grzmot Mines and Zofia's Concussion Grenades are reduced by 70%, as well as override them if activated after being concussed.
---
* Tinnitus from explosions are instantly removed.
---
* Adrenal Surge can also be used on downed allies, reviving them with 5 health, alongside the temporary 20 health boost. The revival process takes the same duration as the revival by Doc's Stim Pistol, which is 2.75 seconds.
---
* Due to the nanobots being delivered to only the Attackers on-site, the Adrenal Surge will not affect the Hostage.
---
* Finka cannot self-revive, as she is unable to activate it while downed.
---
Counters 
---
* The Adrenal Surge can be halted outright by certain Defenders.
---
* Echo's Yokai can use its ultrasonic blasts to halt an active Adrenal Surge. However, this interaction is mutual as the Adrenal Surge will override the disorienting effects of the Yokai drone if activated afterwards.
---
* Lesion's Gu Mines will halt an active Surge, but it also cannot be overridden with another.
---
* Adrenal Surges can't be used to revive players caught in one of Frost's Welcome Mats.
---
* Finka's activation method for her gadget is signal based. Naturally, being within the range of one of Mute's Signal Disruptors will prevent Finka from activating the device.
---
* The Adrenal Surge also has some downsides when encountering certain Defenders.
---
* Pulse's Cardiac Sensor detects Attackers boosted by Adrenal Surge from further away (Up to 14 meters compared to the usual 9 meters) due to their heart beating at a faster rate.
---
* Smoke's Remote Gas Grenades deal 50% more damage to Attackers under the effects of Adrenal Surge, as affected Operators will be breathing harder and faster during that time, inhaling in more gas.
---
It reflects lesions personality

Lately for year 1/2 I've been playing Rook and Echo, you can pic Doc instead of Rook if you want, he just has a different skill and no impact grenades
---
SINNERS
---
I can’t tell you how many times I played against that exact diamond last season..I feel your pain
---
10 percent skill 10 percent luck and 100 percent reason to remember the name!

I mean, this has been leaked before
---
Damn big booty ho
---
True
---
Probably, nothing
---
I just had this same phenomenon happen with a pair of people with generic names cavesiege1 and cavesiege4.
---
yeahh cause almost no one players the newcomers playlist, (is that the newcomers playlist? Only thing i understand is "novice" and multiplayer)
---
Try out casual.
---
Shut your bitch ass up Thomas. The clip was fine, not the greatest but it was nice. Next time you comment shit to people make sure you’re not shit yourself, unless you’re a diamond and can prove it don’t even bother to answer this, you bum.
---
That’s not the reason. He’s been playing with weird stuff for a longass time. Also there are lots of people who play with a controller on pc
---
they put new ones every season. and the new ones just came out today.
---
Haha someone's cranky lol
---
Houdini right there
---
I think Nokk is currently the worst attacker in the game while warden is the worst defender. Surprisingly they both were released last season. 
---
So I think Nokk is worse than Caveria.
---
Doesn't a bullet at the foot enough ?
---
Crediting the artist is even better
---
yeah it is but im new to it i wanna learn it and casuals is just full of peeps with plat ranks im up against I cant do shit imma just delete the shitty game I guess
---
what’s good with your res
---
Jesus fuck thats terrifying
---
This all sounded perfect and then I read 9
---
Y is this such a big deal for u
---
They can make money by letting people choose what to purchase and not have to gamble for it.
---
Well in the past they’ve fixed some of the skins they messed up on like hibanas Yurei headgear after her face changed,Dokkaebi had man hands with her simulation course uniform from the six invitational sets. and that got fixed recently so I have a good feeling they’ll fix her shoes lol.
---
Naahh purple headgear
---
First off, it's been a part of his kit since he launched. Secondly, it's so situational that it is rarely effective at all. The spot he killed the defender in could have happened from other angles or with different utility in less roundabout ways. And lastly, it's really difficult to actually make this work. You have to be pixel accurate or it's a waste of utility.
---
At worst this is just an example of the complexities in the game that you occasionally learn about through watching or playing it enough.
---
Because reposting an art without crediting the artist is against the rules of this sub
---
It really does work, and is the perfect place to sit with echo/maestro.
---
It's just a lot of utility to do, so the rest of your guys have to hold church like the round depends on it (because it does).
---
I do but I don't put them down right away because of possible twitch, randoms throwing impacts to kill drones and friends accidently shooting jammers going after a muted drone or the one that got away.
---
Ooooo consulate garage counter? Rappel paino window and shoot a bullet thru the floor by where garage is at then capi fire..
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Now you are getting it :)
---
we call those pc with a controller guys heathens.
---
I got this ugly ass facemask for sledge
---
Maestro has nades?
---
I got the Bundeswehr skin for Bandit's MP7. Not gonna lie, pretty fr\*icking cool
---
Where I live the R6 credits are expensive...kinda. like in the US 5$ is like kids money but in other countries that shit sky rockets.
---
&gt;the AR has no recoil
---
Never thought I’d see the day people were saying this again
---
Are you playing on a controller?
---
Most likely only with credits in the future since ubi is looking for a way to prevent Console players from having multiple accounts which most likely will improve the experience on console imo
---
He been saucy. He's just happens to be the worst operator in the game
---
Tbh, i was going to but i just couldn't take the risk
---
“COPPER NO!” “No, it’s necessary. “
---
Last time I checked 1.15 isn’t negative. You can make all the excuses you want but you haven’t hit diamond not even once. Probably if you change that shitty attitude of yours you could get some friends to play with. I’m done talking to you kid just keep in mind what I’ve said. Good Riddance
---
it’s called Off Duty and it says Swelter Skelter. One of the patches also say ATT-CODE. I’m just glad I don’t have to see those disgusting hands ever again! Lol
---
I just thought of this when trying to think of a reason: if you were able to share all of the purchases made with R6 credits, it would technically half Ubi’s profits, and also, you would be able to constantly make new accounts on your home Xbox, and assuming you have the season pass, make R6 purchases almost infinitely, or at least until you run out of stuff that costs at or below 600 R6 credits.
---
Overall everything is over priced as MTXs are based off the app market which is based off whales. For that I genuinely think it's a bad business model compared to pricing things at least not as overpriced if not something reasonable.
---
Having said that I do agree with "if you don't like it, don't buy it" when it comes to straight forward MTXs as it's just a question of if the price is right for you.
---
My problem is with asking players to pay to gamble, the paid packs, and asking players to grind, the premium battlepass.
---
Those are what I have an issue with.
---
When they do that, their setup won't run at full power, they'll to that because when there is an intensive scene, they'll have a buffer in their hardware which will prevent frame drops.
---
E.g.
---
A setup with 200 FPS runs at full power, when explosions come on the screen (a generally intensive thing to do) their FPS will drop to 160.
---
When people cap their FPS at 144 no framdrop will be seen, which is expecially for people with motionsickness much nicer.
---
They only want money
---
I really wish in the future they allow us to use the elite animations for skins other than just the elite.
---
As someone who has just recently (finally) hit high Plat play I actually feel like I'm good at the game now. Like playing in high gold was still like "yeah that guy is retarded." but now it's like "I actually drowned this guy out without him knowing, got myself a free kill and got player advantage."
---
Idk I feel more useful as a teammate for some reason.
---
Damn bro can't believe this is just your first attempt cuz all the parts of the cosplay are just perfect
---
Level 36 on his main?
---
Ubi only wants money
---
Because he has a tiny weiner. Thats why.
---
And their rank reset.
---
Hahaha when is it too late to abort? You're mum should have belly dived on concrete when you were in the womb
---
On the one hand yes but on the other hand it’s a great way to start fighting toxicity on console since all those damn annoying kids won’t risk their accounts with the skins and it’s just not that much fun to play without fancy skins
---
Bad music
---
What’s this “activate windows” thing-mbob you got going on? Perhaps attributing to your issue
---
Duplicate uniform for bandit
---
Thank the lord, I can use this uniform again without being creeped out;)
---
Yeah looks like unranked. 4400 elo is Diamond so must be from this season. 
---
Must be unranked.
---
it looks like an oni i think it would fit hibana more but frost is fine too
---
I mean, I get the frustration when someone is playing an operator and doesn't do their job. It's extremely frustrating and inexcusable after level 50 I'd say. Obviously tking isn't the way to react to it though.
---
But people obvi think ur opinion is garbo
---
I like it it’s a way for us players to keep Ubisoft’s interest in siege high. The money they make with siege the more they are concerned how the game evolves
---
The Hong Kong riots
---
**Woman**
---
But if you use a controller on PC you're not getting any advantage like when you use keyboard and mouse on a console, you're actually getting handicapped.
---
why are you playing if you're driving ?
---
I can't launch the game.
---
So some people without critical thinking skills believe a game is ok with frequently crashing lol
---
Mate, please clam down, no need to get aggressive.
---
Can you link it?
---

---
i spit tea all over my monitor
---

I feel like the only appeal of these comics is them being related to Siege. The humor though is virtually nonexistent as far as I'm concerned
---
Is your monitor ok?
---
shitty smoke headgear after I just bought his elite
---
It’s time to safe mister bear 🐻

---
I would have bombed myself with the hatch away
---
I've been playing since June, where i bought The gold Edition for 60% off. I have 202 hours on steam, and around 80 or so online. I have 41 operators , i've been playing a lot during the summer break so yea. (i think i have an addiction)
---
Lol
---
Is the game easy to learn for noobs like me? Also should I go for deluxe edition?  Thanks for the reply!
---
Nah the rioters are now starting to targets businesses owned by people who dare to criticize them, but I'm sure you care about that while living on the other side of the world.

If BLM or the anti-Trump protesters did the same in the USA I bet you'd be the first to called for them to be banned.
---
Have you watched TheRussianBadger? Oh wait you said  “pro”, then again, he has participated in three tournaments, two of which his team has won. Though in all seriousness, it could be that people watch “pros” or actual pros to see how they play and adopt some of their strategies.
---
Buy Uplay+ and then you can cancel it. So techically it's free
---
Such a sweet comment but so many downvotes. Wow this community isn't just toxic in-game.
---
Didn’t realise they added Tracer
---
that happened because you was not holding shift and w anymore
---
Top tier Maestro play, I'm equally jealous, inspired and actually a little ashamed when I think of how I play Maestro by comparison
---
Wow, this clip is at least a year old
---
Not OP but I play on 5/5 Deadzones, new acceleration, 60 Vert/100 Hor and 50 ADS.
---
It is not too late in all honesty! They still have lots of more content planned to release. I will say that it does have quite the learning curve to the guns and the maps. No aim assist which I love personally because I hate my shot getting pulled by aim assist (ow is super bad about this). If you’re willing to put in the work you will love this game.
---
If they shoot my drone, i shoot them, headshot or not
---
I also got this 
---
Unfortunately it was a duplicate
---
Imagine being this fucking stupid
---
Without year 4 season pass you'll have to grind to buy year 4 operators , with sp you get all ops and also a lava weapon skin.
---
Did they change the controls for how it works? I recently tried it but couldn't.
---
[this should help](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/faqs/000032916/Content-of-Rainbow-Six-Siege-Editions-R6S)
---
With season pass you unlock new operators 1 week before the non sp players

I work for a living, I don't rely on my parents, and I have enough of a life to not spend my money on e-skins for an ungrateful company that makes billions off of dumb children.
---
I think the issue is that you can't pay for exactly what you want, you just have to hope you get it, I'd gladly spend $5 to buy this skin but I'd rather not if it just means I get a 1/24 chance of getting it
---
Giving you an upvote just because of russianbajur.
---
How steep is the learning curve? I used to play DF,Reaper and Mccree on ow and 2 of those characters didn’t required much aim so my aim is kinda ok but not thay good. Will this be a problem? Also is the deluxe edition worth it? It’s too cheap atm and I really don’t have enough funds to get another edition.
---
You mean playing glaz?
---
Blackbeard can still be extremley deadly in the right hands. The amount of times ive been holding an angle and have been peaked by the one guy you dont want to be peaked by is unreal. I recommend prefiring alot with him once you know where people are as its nearly impossible for your opponent to react in time. Also try to target opps with low fire rate weapons as you are most effectuve against them, i know the shield has a set amount of health but youll begin to notice that fast firerate weapons shred it apart so id target people like kiad amd vigil. If your looking for good yr 1 and 2 opps mira is a great pic because no-one will ever nock you for picking her and her ability lasts after you die. Whats not to like!
---
He dies, probably
---
For beginners I recommend using rook as a starter for defense ops because you don't have to think about you utility the whole match just place the plates right at the beginning and your fine with him. For attack I recommend sledge he is well balanced, his utility is easy as well. I hope this helps you. Basic Tipps would be don't reinforce between objectives in bomb, learn the default cams and look at the compass so you know which room you are in also feel free to ask you teammates what they are planning to do and what you can do to help them at the start. Some of them will be toxic af but most of them will help you
---
Ew gross
---
vigil op
---
wait is the event playable right now?
---
Yeah, it just takes effort. I've run into more blatant hackers on Siege than I have on CSGO... and CSGO is free...
---
I sacrificed the lower cam to hibana so she would call to thermite that the cam is gone
---
When you use an Ash round or a breach charge on a window like this, you can destroy everything near the window. So Frost traps, Kaplan traps, Leison mine, Mute jammer, ADS, etc will all be gone.
---
It’s actually not a bad idea in some situations.
---
Good thing is those who left during the game do get penalties
---
I had some trouble earlier where I was nearly point blank ADS with shotguns and not earning kills in several rounds
---
Sadly, yes. I guess us EU players can't switch from our toxic servers to US servers anymore. F
---
ah yea? ma mom thiccer than an air bus
---
Recruit with Spetsnaz LMG
---
And Valve doesn't rent the cheapest servers and has ddos protection. And a decent rank system where you aren't stuck in silver with 16 kills each match.
---
R6S is a great game, but it has a problem: Ubisoft. They try to sqeeze as much money out of it for the least amount of effort posiible. When I heard they will introduce a season pass I almost punched my screen.
---
Jk. I like having a hard breach er like Thermite or Hibana in any team/map. Thatcher is also great.
---
Ela is another one of those operators, like blackbeard, that was god tier on release that got nerfed to the ground, and now Ubi are afraid to buff them again because the community, I like the idea of her getting her impacts back, but I feel like alot of people would be against it, as is the way of this community, and people as a whole
---
I'm currently living in Shenzhen (6 min train to Central) , you see and hear a lot more the closer you are. Also using a VPN if you have doubts.
---
When I was in the USA, I only heard positive things for the protestors.
---
When I was in Guangzhou, only positive things for the government.
---
Give and take I guess. I'd rather see Ash teleportation memes and gameplay than the politics talk in this sub than the pseudo-politics like on the BFV sub.
---
Didn't know about this, thanks for the tip!
---
Didn't even remember that the lightning was so shitty back then.
---
Best attacker: Zofia/Hibana/Twitch/Capitao (nearly impossible to pick just one imo)
---
Best Defender: Maestro/Lesion/Echo/Jager/smoke (even though Mira's really good as well I'm not including her because unlike the other 5, she isn't useful on every bombsite, no matter how good you are with her.
---
Just get a vpn or something?
---
You cant perma ban boosted people because of closet cheaters, the system we have is fine, 15 days and rank reset.
---
You can also shotgun open the floor there when you're below and throw a Nitro right up onto the balcony
---
MOSS caught it, moss has other files that sees what programs you have open and records keystrokes etc.
---
Mozzie drones are highlighted with white border to teammates, it even shows through walls.
---
mozzie drones has a diffrrent light for attackers. iirc its blue but I dont remember i might be wrong
---
She is in default but I dont like her elite...the only female elite I like is frost tbh
---
Very good point, if the feedback loops are immediate it would be so easy and quick to learn what the parameters are. 
---
Quicker bans would paradoxically mean more hackers. Hum...
---
I think her Elite is way better then the regular
---
Too easy to rush, easier to have an undetectable spawn peak (often I listen for the sound of breaking barricades on my drone next to common spots during prep phase). Attacker rotations would also be too quick.
---
I agree
---
That a juul ? What flavour ?
---
Fucking bugs and glitches at its finest
---
I've heard some companies deal with this in an interesting way - they eat it. They swallow up all the DDOS traffic because it's still cheaper to absorb the hit than to lose the customer.
---
This one match a valkyrie destroyed all of my 3 drones so I just followed her and destroyed her cams after she placed them
---
Then I got teamkilled lol
---
Mango
---
He doesn’t deserve those drones

Damn, how much you want for it ?

If I ever see a clash shield in real life coming at me the amount of PTSD it will bring back will reduce me to a sobbung ball on the floor.
---
This happens to me on all maps and with all operators and scopes. I thought that's something they implemented with the new season. It's more realistic than the previous completely static scopes
---
Thats not true...... They add new characters
---
I gatchu, home slice

Smoke main, twitch main. 
---
*Mixed feelings ensue*
---
mucho thanko
---
Warden probably had the P90 during testing and they tried it with his ability and it was likely OP, Another reason why he no longer has impact grenades.
---
Warden would be a nightmare with the MP5 or P90 he'd be able to challenge Glaz every time
---
That Monty said “I’m a head out”
---
Nah it a juul
---
No offence, but I've watched the Apex Pro Scene &amp; I've not heard of you, in what way are you competing against TSM, G2 etc? Genuinely interested.
---
Also, it's esports, not eSports &amp; C9 don't have an Apex team any longer. So it'd be hard to beat them.
---
So, I'm skeptical of some of the claims made here. Look, don't get me wrong, you may well be genuine, but this post doesn't come across as professional.
---
it’s a joke ya bum
---
I agree he'd be a nightmare with the MP5. Just because we don't need 3 doc mains on the same team. But I don't think most people would run the P90 over the MPX, sure you've got an ACOG. But the damage is worse, and the recoil is horrific when compared to the mpx, which is practically a laser beam.
---
The M12 is the worst gun in the game, the FMG-9 is miles better even if it's still shit
---
I always enjoy how I am god-tier when aiming at my teammates. Not so much with the enemy.
---
Uh not really.
---
Yes it's a joke. You can't really stop it yourself, Just play the game and hope no one thinks killing you will solve something.
---
Temporarily removed because of an exploit. If it's not back in yet it will be once the bug's resolved.
---
is she single?
---
That bb is soo mad

I believe his can of toxin in his head  wiggles and jiggles

---
Mozzie's drones should be blue eyes
---
1. Higher ranks' MMR was lowered.
---
2. Since last season, the reset of your MMR was changed to only a soft reset.
---
(Definition to the people that might not know:)
---
Before Phantom Sight, every season when you reset to unranked, your MMR would be 2500, no more, no less. And depending on how well your win/loss rate went in your placements, you were placed between Copper IV and Platinum II. Now, the higher your rank was the previous season, the higher you start. The maximum is, if you were Diamond or higher in the previous season, you start at 3500 MMR.
---
Change the resolution
---
i think they would make that a separate op because that would be hard to balance and also make useless
---
unplug and replug your mouse, check drivers, see if it lags outside of siege as well, go to Google
---
PC player, but i've been playing FPS on console for a while before that and tried the controller in R6
---
the only two things that change are:
---
1. scratch the aim assist, only works for PvE
---
2. M/KB is not natively supported on console siege so not easily accessible for everyone and verboten as far as Ubisoft is concerned
---
Huh. Very interesting choice actually. 
---
Still limits Nokk to close combat while giving her suppressed weapon. 
---
I'm not sure if it will help Nokk overall in terms of making her more useful but it will definitely give an interesting choice between Deagle or SMG 12.
---
Smurfs should f off tbh.
---
Thanks I have Valkyrie and Mira so I will consider maestro thank you
---
Imagine being a Kapkan main and being flamed for not doing windows.
---
Yeah man, it really annoyed me about how proud he was of it
---
I'm not experienced with it, but I'm 99.999999% sure you can use a VPN on console.
---
Brooo you got baited hard
---
If the queue time goes above 5-10 you will never find a game
---
Valk: I think this one is the best...or maybe this one...what do you think?
---
Hostage: pls let me go
---
thats wack
---
But if you know mute spots twitch shouldn’t be able to see them for example on the workbench below yellow stairs gets yellow stairs impossible to break without thatcher twitch can’t get to it
---
I dont know of they are saying Yikes to the rank or queue time 😬😬😬
---
[deleted]
---
How did I get baited? Lol
---
Yes
---
Ja that a Jägermeister weapon skin for IQ?
---
Never thought of that but could be xD
---
A REALLY BIG FUCKING HOLE COMING RIGHT UP!
---
He has been on video but He always used Smurf acount,not his main.
---
Honestly i dont know why ubi allowed his vídeo.
---
What he did was against the rules,and using multiple acount to circumvent a ban is as well.
---
He got Lucky they were more interested in the free advertise to r6
---
I just never get good teammates in solo queue lol
---
wtfym. its an issue thats brought up every single time they release packs
---
Switch to console
---
Pros and cons of both operators:
---
ZOFIA
---
/\/\/\/\/\
---
Pros:
---
-Very strong guns
---
-Good breaching/semi-intel tool
---
-Claymore
---
Cons: 
---
Not the best support operator, (but a very good fragger)
---
FINKA
---
-Gadget is very overpowered
---
-Very good for helping your team
---
-Easy to aim with
---
-Very good LMG and shotgun
---
-Frag grenades
---
Cons:
---
-Weak assault rifle
---
-Enemy team will be mad and start running META
---
-Bad in non-coordinated teams because if you trigger it mid-gunfight they won't be ready
---
In conclusion:
---
Finka has more pros but also more cons
---
Zofia is an all-around well-balanced operator
---
Now I am afraid of blitz running in my house and hitting me with a shield
---
Nobody is forcing them to lmao. People are acting like Ubisoft is breaking into your homes and stealing money directly from your wallet. Nobody has to buy packs. Its just stupid costumes that you'll forget about after 2 weeks anyways.
---
It's because you're such low rank, not many people are that bad
---
I know some people didn’t know what it was at the beginning, but there are people that know what a mozzie drone is, and they still shoot it
---

False if you're above like plat 2 sadly. A lot of us in the very high ranks have to deal with these long queues especially in the late night/early morning
---
Newcomer's kinda dead
---
Oh trust me this is not even the close to the first time. I've been in plat before and last night it just really upset me because I was playing with a friend and it was one of his first games and now he is saying the game sucks.
---
I want it so much
---
I know the guy was using me as bait since he told me that after I messaged him lol. What I didn’t know was the guy above was joking lol
---
Casual or ranked?
---
i would say give him a mountie uniform or like a button-up, sleeves rolled up, with some utility pants and a baseball cap for his headgear. make him a casual canadian
---
zofia. no contest, case closed
---
What is he doing??

... He's beginning to believe

Why does Valky look like the female version of Dio?

Good you credited him.
---
I hate that shit
---
I no warden is sexy, but mute...not on camera
---
Thanks just wondering ! I’m always skeptical about headshots.
---
noooo no no no. you’ve never played a good blitz then. a good blitz is terrifying. even after the nerf. if a blitz is constantly moving, only crouching when totally 100% without any option but not to sprint, he’s *going* to kill you.
---
not ban worthy, but definitely not worse than finka lol. only thing finka is good for is the DBNO res.
---
Ugly ass colors no thanks
---
The circle of salt.
---
TARS
---
All you need is a grenade or an operator that can shoot projectiles with their ability. But I’m a sledge main and whenever I see clash it’s an easy grenade kill.
---
Try running battleye in administrator
---
Oh your the creator. Congrats man, this is engraved in siege history be proud mate
---
It's fine, I wanted some minus karma for a long time now &gt;\_&lt;
---
Everyone seems to laugh when Monty blocks the door for defenders, but somehow Clash, who can damage you while blocking the door is trash.

Hello lonelyspaceman717, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d936f7/417/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Is it available on xbox?
---
How they come back if they don't even come back ?
---
Damn I dont think ibe ever seen it
---
It's a tossup between Europeans and Slavs for me. Europeans tend to speak English quite often, but the Slavs I've ran into mostly just spoke their own language.
---
Do not flame, but it is interesting that the siege community bans this operator almost all of the time when most people (nearly no one) plays her. I don’t understand why she is banned. What goes in your head when banning clash? It’s like having a good on the market and every agrees to keep this good banned or barred but at the same time it provides greater utility than other goods, why do we do this? I prefer no ban almost all of the time.

Just so you know, peek not peak

Not really, that's just a metric ton is skill, it's when people spray and get a random headshot that makes me mad
---
yea and they usually have multiple ways with how to deal with that operator
---
lmao you got downvoted by a Chinese bot at some point
---
Lol yes clash is a women, did you not notice the face/voice?
---
very cyka indeed.
---
I thought the negotiator was General Kenobi
---
Are you Pagin Min ?
---
See, i think most people ban here because shes annoying, when i ban her its because shes effective. id rather ban echo anyday.
---
This was on Xbox (Microsoft has a built it game capture) on pc OBS is good to continually record games and it’s free
---
yea true and those banned operators usually have multiple ways of dealing with them
---
Nothing worse man
---
Nah, she's a milk dud
---
It’s 2019 man it can be anything
---
no I genuinely didn't
---
Ah yes the paddle controls should have told me that lol, wish I wasn't blind.

Thanks though ill try it out and see if I can find another hacker (probably never will :() and finally complete my quest.

They clearly have not... have you at all been following what they’ve done lately? This game used to be even worse

Clash is so good wtf

I don’t know how obs will affect frames and what not but you’re welcome my dude
---
Haha.  As an America who also speaks French and lives in Europe.  j'approuve ce message.

If i remember what Rogue-9 said it helps with ADS time.

Honestly, basic English can be used but the French seem to be universally dickheads.

Nah Dokki is like a Mom she always calls u at an unpleasant timing and falls all ur friend cause u won't pick up

Yea befor the update but now he trash 😂😂

You know that blowtorches existed before maverick, right?
---
Yea Blackbeard’s dmr without shield is better than his fragile I don’t get it
---
True  but it was on rank

When you’re tracked, all you can do is run around like a chicken with its head cut off

Ain’t this a repost? I pretty sure it is.
---
i want an elite maestro or gridlock
---
Right😂
---
Sooo close
---
It’s kinda just being unlucky. Unfortunately that’s a part of siege.

Her abilities are ok, her loadout is just underpowered so she cant make use of those abilities.

Probably some 12 year olds, anyone above 16 can speak english rather good here.
---
Clash was awesome before they nerfed her
---
So maybe have it so you have the passive flashbang resistance but you have to manually trigger the smoke vision. Currently IQ only sees warden when the glasses are activated so that could be how reworked warden gets countered by IQ.
---
‘Murica, FUCK YEAH
---
I use her, you can kill roamers pretty much, or silent push. Her weapon is an headshot machine so why not? For me is a good choice.

It's hit or miss really. Premades always suck imo because they have backup.

Obi-Wan with high ground wins everything
---
Pros play the best characters on each objective, if a given character is one of the best on a certain objective they will be played.
---
Oh that's cool
---
I thought this was just me. Just recently got into ranked and played about 5 matches where the rest of my team kept screaming in French but would randomly do callouts in English so i couldn't mute them.
---
I disagree. I think shield operators give up mobility and fire power. They are far from unbeatable, and the pick and win rates show that. I just don’t know why blitz got the running with shield buff since no one asked for it. And Blackbeard hasn’t been complete advantage in a long time. Do I want more ops that bypass the 1 shot headshot mechanics? No. But he seems to be in a good place with neither high pick nor ban rate. 
---
There are also ways of dealing with flashes. Jager would be a better pick, or even the turn into a corner trick works &gt;50% of the time. If warden dropped flash resist glasses for every like took, that would be different, but that could be a bit unbalanced as well.
---
18-5 with 2 assists sasg only
---
There was literally a Blitz ace in pro league what are you on about

I had literally no idea these were coming out (didn’t follow any leaks), so when I hopped on yesterday, I freaked out and copped that Nøkk skin in a heartbeat. Wish I had Smoke’s PL for that FMG-9 Skin tho...

When you melee their shield then look down to the left and it's hard to kill them

Unranked is useless for newcomers who wanna practice for ranked. There's no way a newbie is gonna "learn and improve" when fighting against some diamond or plat guy who's using a macro and gets 22-0 kd each match and spams GG EZ

hopping to a different server to play with a friend has absolutely nothing to do with hopping to another server by yourself to purposely have higher ping and derank. you're just choosing to not see the difference here. if its that easy then get a friend from a different data center to play with.

ok lol I ask who that is and you just assume your own answer? genius logic
---
If you want to sweat, go to ranked. Casual is only for sending it and memes
---
also this guy is "dia in his main"
---
i doubt it
---
Go on custom game playlist and change the data Center there
---
And yet she can still see lesion mines.
---
Not like this :(
---
:D Sad you missed the early Nomad days. She used to have a Claymore and you could build hilarious traps in combination with the Trap, where the Defenders get yeeted into a Claymore.
---
It's already a thing though.
---
Its why i never play casual. Absolute garbage ruined by these morons
---
Those dudes are lost, dayum. Nice aim tho, on point
---
It’s not good for the spirit of the game.
---
Maybe. I’m going From what I’ve retained from tenth grade french.
---
I've won several games because of clash just cock blocking the enemies. Granted they weren't being very smart but if you're coordinated even good teams will have plenty of trouble with clash
---
Thanks for pointing that out, just realized that
---
If ur doing it for the solo que then definitely leison. There’s a good chance no one on ur team is gonna give u call outs if ur solo queuing so just use his traps as a way of sound whoring
---
The Easter Ontario experience. I've had a couple games with all francophones
---
What about if Tachanka has the high ground?
---
Yea no problem
---
i tried my best, but i cant hold everything in one step, i will keep hard work
---
Doesn't matter, Obi-Wan will always have the higher ground
---
I thought mira was shaved?
---
This deserves more upvotes.  We need this IN GAME!
---
No its not? Yesterday someone teamkilled me and after that round his friend that was in his party also teamkilled me, that led to me posting this
---
I know bud, just some light fun at the rank. But if you keep trying then you'll get a higher rank. Also try your best not to solo queue. Its harder to get higher ranks playing alone

Play unranked...

Also what time zone are you in? We are pst and central

not echo cuz its a normal ban on ranked

wrong, she's good at being a piece of shit
---
Lesion is like, top 3 operators in the game, so
---
It's a thing . But it seems it's not working as intended . Look for Patch notes for v4.3.1
---
Huh? No. Does Goyo need a counter that bad? I main Goyo and it literally isn’t hard to take out the shield. Hell, just put a breach charge on the floor and blow it up
---
what did he say?
---
I had the video on mute yet I still heard the music
---
Called Clash a trap
---
Maybe in the next patch but i just commented saying,”someone teamkilled me and after that his teammate killed me” this has also happened to me countless other times, in one match someone killed my friend (whom i was in a party with) and after my friend killed him again i didnt have reverse tk
---
I'm Central, I'm from Michigan but I'm usually up late enough to play with most time zones
---
This is Casual in a nutshell, also why i almost never play Casual.
---
When you get meleed as an attacking shield and it swings out you can do the same thing, it just isn't as effective.
---
I’m typically off around 9-10 as I work from 5 am to 3-4 pm 5-6 days a week. Me and my friend only really play Sunday Monday Tuesday and Wednesday, so I’m missing your free days.
---
Hiw do you kill Clash? I legit don't know. Go in melee range and melee her?
---
This makes me wonder. What about handicapped people that use those air tubes to play. Do they get banned for weird control inputs as well?

It’s happened to me this past week along with constantly getting bad teammates, I give up on this game for now.
---
That's honestly cooler than his elite
---
TACHANKA is that you
---
Yes is annoying as hell and even when your on defense she just gets in the way
---
Oh I see! Thankyou very much! Still not a super fan of the price increase but oh well.
---
TURRET DEPLOYED AND LOAD ED!

That’d be cool if they did a similar concept to Apex
---
Your school lets you wear a glass mask
---
Alpha pack exclusive sadly :( Mute hasn’t had a buyable bundle (with renown or R6 credits) since his elite back in White Noise. Wish he got some love, especially when Ash has gotten like 6 skins in a row.
---
Nope, that would be horrible he only put the mask on for the photo
---
Yep
---
I have a diamond and former almost challenger league friend and his group fo friends and they ban clash in upper plat diamond elo
---
I think the point they’re trying to make is that she’s VERY situational
---
Yes, but it was in Year 1. 
---
So it's inaccessible.
---
*laughs in lesion main*
---
Someone explain?
---
It's worth noting that Finka's ability also reduces your team's recoil by ~45%. He benefited from that as well.
---
Remove layers to a tactical shooter?

Because you dont like an aspect of the game?

You're also not describing the armor system, you're describing peeker's advantage.

Moreover, he must be fun at parties? You're complaining about a system that has no actual issues to it and makes choosing an operator more complex and have specific pros and cons to it.

Yup

We can’t even carry backpacks, out school is super over the top for everything

Are you me?

I both disagree with maverick being banned and agree cause the amount of times I’ve been the reason for winning a match is a lot

Idk, i built a replica of the lords dp28, i gotta say the lord tachanka would win, (dont believe me, check my posts)
---
Roger Smith?
---
they added a mmr limit of 1000 to stop people boosting by queuing with lower ranks to get easier games, these people are getting around that by playing with un-ranked people to play with a 2,100 mmr difference
---
What's the deagle skin?
---
Dude. I get 4k’s with clash like daily. People don’t know how to play her and are wayyy too passive with her.
---
I versed the best clash ever and got recked by him and I've banned her since
---
The game is designed to be played in a manner in which the team is communicating, it isn't just a COD-like FPS where you run around and shoot stuff, it's a strategic shooter.
---
I use a rifle normally but the lmg s just keep on spraying me and when I hear 31 shoots I go to peek u know reflexes and it just keeps on going
---
Actually would be really cool if you could walkie talkie ability to the other team
---
Wait why?
---
Oof
---
What set?
---
Mute had the smg and so did smoke. Sledge had the AR and so did thatcher
---
I appreciate your sentiment, but if $7 dictates whether or not they can eat today, they shouldn’t have a gaming console or PC to play this in the first place. It’s why I don’t even own a TV. The money I don’t spend on one keeps me buffered enough to not have to scrape for food lol. If they simply like to wait for good deals though I feel that.
---
It drops when your drone is afk I'm pretty sure
---
That's fine with me if it's a situational thing, we have like 40 operators, you can ban 4 in total, it would make sense if operators got banned 1/10 matches or even 2/10 matches, that would be manageable. You could just be like "oh well, guess this time I'll have to change up my gameplay", but when operators get banned 9/10 matches, that's not "working around the ban", it's literally hoping people let you play a single match with operators you like. Clash has the lowest pick rate in the game, even below tachanka, and a win/loss delta of -10%, which is miles below anybody else, even castle and tachanks have a way higher delta compared to her. So if you can't buff her because people would just ban her more and more, and you can't nerf her because it's already the shittiest op in terms of wins and losses, the only solution I see is remove or tweak the ban feature
---
imagine not using drone phase efficiently
---
Appreciate all the tips! Yeah I can tell a few of those already that I need to focus on. I am bad about just using drones during the starting phase pinging people and calling it a day. Forgetting to use cameras and things of the such. Sometimes I'll rush in looking for action just to find out there is some dude in an awkward ass position laying on his back in the corner or something and melts me.😂
---
I also panic from time to time in gunfights. My aim is usually pretty decent. I've been using the analog extenders and have gotten pretty good with them, but when I panic and am trading shots with someone sometimes I aim like a potato. Lol.
---
Yeah there are 62638483626636363848282663848472 posts a day of it.
---
Blackbeard’s shield used to have 800hp and Jäger had an ACOG
---

No wonder I’ve been missing my shots.

Just FYI. If you make a claim it is your responsibility to back it up. Thats how science works.

I cant just say "the center of the moon is made of cheese the exact density of rock" and expect to be taken seriously just because I cant be proven wrong, or because no one wants to bother to prove me wrong.

---
Yeah, but i'm wondering if it had the gold and black proleague skin.
---
Good luck! Just remember that in Casual, (especially recently) it's not always easy to practice tactically because more than half the matches in casual will be very untactical, no communication, no call outs, and a bunch of random things.
---
Simply take it as it is and try to learn as much as you can even if it feels like some people ruin casual.
---
When and if you start playing ranked, you'll notice learning the above will help you get started. By the time you reach say Silver, your training will have paid off.
---
Armor isn't useless because when you have less armor, you are faster. Lmao 
---
It can be up to double the amount of bullets needed based upon armor level lol 
---
Capitao vs Warden? You've never worn a suit, have you? A buet resistant one, no less. 
---
On top of that, it's not superficial. You choose things based on what is KNOWN to be better, not off calculating in real time-- thats why those videos are made. If you get into the Plat level gameplay, you would understand what I'm saying but your abundant lack of knowledge on peekers advantage shows and makes your points scattered brained and pointless at best.

---
The sledge hammer exists because they need a model for the event. Unless they release a new sledge elite, they're not going to add a gadget skin for a hammer. The elite sets change the gadgets enough but keep the balancing of visibility and recognition. Anything you picked up from datamining what we currently have access to has more than likely already been posted anyway.
---
The way I see it, Ranked is for winning games, Casual is for playing the operators you like. I think we also have a somewhat different view on playing operators, as I have enough time with each of them that I don't mind the opportunity to play someone else. I'm just gonna agree to disagree here, cause I don't think either of us will change our minds, and I have work to do. I do enjoy discussions like this though, so thanks.

 I don’t know why everyone downvotes your comment when you use that bot, happens so often.

---
I’ve heard pengu talk about teammate outline and names being optional. I just don’t know the difference between hit detection and hit confirmation.
---
recoil patterns are almost all virtually the same now given a few exceptions, especially based on gun class.  
---
No, operators bring to the table their gadgets/weapons and what those gadgets provide for the team. Their inherent speed/armor should not take into account for that decision making otherwise what reason would there be to ever pick anyone that isn't 3 speed.   
---
   
---
I wasn't arguing that gun attachments aren't realistic, at no point have I even mentioned realism so you're grasping at straws to have any kind of point you can use to undermine my arguments. Logic/Balance doesn't equate to reality. I pointed out that a 3 speed LMG user can outpeak a 3 armor smg user before they even have time to react even if they are looking in the direction the peak is coming from, and that's just outright bad design for a game, it's clearly unbalanced. Otherwise Jaeger and Bandit would still have ACOG's on their primaries.
---
That was a huge miss.
---
You wot?
---
haha oh yeah!! i used to love adventure time &gt;_&lt; maybe!
---
Depends on what kind of *knowledge* you want to acquire. 
---
Vertical play? Take Sledge or Buck into a private game. 
---
Angles? Play the game
---
don't worry. you wouldn't want to open 50 lootboxes to get it

The scope would be better for DMRs rather than a LMG
---
The fucking Cav just hanging out there made me jump a little.
---
I'm from Poland. My accent is bit weird (mix between russian and german accent - "t" and "r" are highlighted, "th" sound as "z" and I'm working on it) but EU players are different league. Once I've got a German, French and Italian (plus one English, but he wasn't much of a talker, he barely spoke) in one squad. At the beginning we greeted each other in fairly good English, but after round 2, Italian and German started to argue, both in their native language - Italian dude was backseating German dude and he got angry about that. French got pissed off and started to yell at them in his language and after French and Italian insulted me on word chat, I started to insult them in Polish. After this the English guy left. Can you imagine 4 people from 4 different countries insulting each other in native languages ? If international meetings would look like this, we would have 5th World War right now.
---
Pinging is usually a bad habbit, because then your opponent knows, that he's being watched and most importantly they will shoot the cam then. 
---
It can be helpful at the end of the round, to stress people out, or if you wanna walbang someone, but I would always try to give the callout rather than pinging it on the drone.
---
My erection and I fail to see the problem here
---
yes but while they don't get 20$ from 1000 people they get 20$ from 10.000 people. so they choose this way.
---
Do we really need more things for Ubisoft to shaft our wallets with
---
She’s already in the game, nokk
---
I wasn’t fully paying attention so when I saw the Cav just sitting there I jumped a little.
---
Ok by Clash glitch you probably mean "shield glitch" where she could hold shield on your screen and pistol on hers. So let's dissect the problem and see what is going on.
---
Here is official Ubi dev note on the topic (posted over 2 months back):
---
[https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-352788-16/dev-blog-exploit-postmortem](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-352788-16/dev-blog-exploit-postmortem)
---
Reason for that exploit was caused by UDP packets behaviour. As game communication is based on UDP instead of TCP protocol, what your game client send to server does not neccessarly come to server in the same order and there is no guarantee it will even be delivered at all - aka. packet loss. Now glitching Clash required quick gadget switching to trigger sending more than one packets of client data at the same time (for the same tick) and a little bit of luck that they will come to server in different order. General manifestation of that glitch is basically every combination of weird gadgets behaviour, including Jager ADS mixed with primary weapon, Kapkan EDDs drill as primary weapon, reinforcments being held like a gun, extendable shield clipping through body or covering face, etc.
---
Here is a link to post from this very subreddit showing the exact same glitch done by Jager (posted 1 day ago):
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d8k3q0/it\_looks\_like\_a\_p/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d8k3q0/it_looks_like_a_p/)
---
So it looks like glitching Clash is not necesarlly fixed, it's just a little bit harder as the backbone of the glitch is still there, packets behaviour might be a little more predictable, but if you manage to fuck them up, server will still accept it.
---
Yea earlier in the round I looked around and almost shot her
---
Elite Frost :D
---
ooo maybeee
---
I stopped running Mira on that site if I don’t have a full squad because of this.
---
"Stop shooting my drones, knobhead"
---
I dunno rule 34 maybe?
---
I think they were more referring to you mentioning using the Russian sights on other guns, which is a valid point. I do think changing the color of the reticle would be good though, especially for those with color blindness.
---
The recoil in that gun isn’t much so it’s pretty each to manage
---
Unmanned drones
---
That's Trevor from GTAV
---
Reverse friendly fire wasn't enabled... 
---
So it couldn't downed me
---
It happened in eu gold matchmaking,I was quite surprised and pissed by it lol
---
Back in the day, Blackbeard was worth buying.
---
He just walks up and ask how there days been
---
By that logic, nobody would want to use sledge because Buck is more diverse. Finka covers a large ground when it comes to support. Reviving, disabling inconveniences, and most importantly making a gunfight easier. Though I do see why you would think finka isn’t great, removing them revive option wouldn’t really do much. I haven’t seen that many people be revived using a finka boost because 9/10 times someone gets revived, they instantly get finished.
---
Ultra preset has the render scale at 50% thats why fps is so good
---
Thanks, i love it!
---
Proves my point even further
---
To clarify what the dude said above, Rogue 9 made a video a few months ago about the development of Siege that started after R6Patriots was canceled. During the first few development stages of the game, it was originally a class like Battlefield where there was a medic, engineer, support, etc. until they decided to switch to a more hero shooter based system which is where we are today.
---
Thought this was a gif. Took me too long.
---
I am 100% sure I got several seasonal common headgears out of alpha packs every season since they‘ve dropped. But with Uniforms I am not quite sure. I think I‘ve gotten some, but I could be mistaken.

Anyway, isn’t there every new season some official information about everything you can get out of alpha packs?

Woah that sounds frustrating to play against. Let's nerf Blitz
---
Basesless guess and 100% sure of it? Doesnt sound right to me ;) 
---
Btw is there really coming a BP to R6S?
---
You got this!
---
I'm trying to do the same thing but can't  find the gas mask or the type of pants I did find q video of a guy creating the masks and the whole outfit but it's in Portuguese
---
i love smoke, and his fmg9 is wholy underrated
---
Yea it's not bad. At least they dont mess up breakfast very much. Lol
---

That’s like finding a random name in the movie credits and tweeting them and saying “ thanks for helping the movie”

When a Goyo shield triggers, there is a little explosion that damages the hostage. Pretty obvious but I didn’t think about it myself :D

We don't drink when we play siege but because we just played siege.
---
Pfff that sucksss. Thanks for the answer man. :)
---
You're a fucking pussy. Also hilarious you used your mod flair, you must need attention.
---
God forbid people running around with pink cat drones. They just blend in with the floor. /s
---
If someone hits a genuine nice shot on me or makes a really good play I always make the effort to commend them for doing good. Gotta spread the positivity!
---
Congratulations
---
Awhhhh yeahhhhh!
---
*laughs in cluster charge
---
Que is Spanish for "What." You mean to say "queue."
---
Yeah and people are pissed about it
---
A Chef Boyardee drone rolling around would bring back precious memories of the commercials that would constantly play as a child
---
What

Ban her to protect her against all the racism.
---
That's awful, people have been trying to tell them about this for a while!
---
Just move to a mute jammer
---
Blessed? How about the son of God.
---
thats true, but knowing me i wont know whats happening until after i have no more charges left XD
---
You can surrender when round 3 starts. 2/3 needs to accept the surrendering.
---
can someone explain to me why that works, like ive seen youtubers hold it out and for some reason people don't see you. i just wanna know like why?
---
Me too, but this is a problem of the icons
---
It's just the fov. It also makes it look like you run faster and hallways seem longer etc. Same with any throwable gadgets it looks like it's thrown far but it's not
---
This image makes me nauseous
---
At least make t so if you have either the uniform or headgear of the rainbow is magic event equipped it would give you the rainbow drone
---
I only run reflex because the red dot, holo, and ACOG are all red and blend in with everything
---
Are those supposed to be deagles?
---
My fav is a 6k as fuze. Hostage included
---
If the sight isn’t a big deal for you, the F90 is the play, less recoil and more fire rate.
---
What in the...

---
i havent tried to do the walking forward and then throwing thing, but that doesnt account for the fact that from a stationary position ive seen them be thrown farther on pc. 
---
Ive stood with my back against a wall on my friends pc version and thrown a c4 and did the same on my console an the c4 just didnt go as far, its not a matter of it looking like it did because the ping distance marker is consistant between pc and console.
---
Beautiful

&gt;shield on defence
---
&gt;useless
---
Lmao nice try
---
Thatcher lookin straight outta the cone-head films
---
How goods Mavericks gun?
---
I think blitz has taken too many nerfs. In order to buff him we should remove blackbeards primaries
---
Ok
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Ive stood with my back against the same wall in both PC and console versions of the game and thrown a C4 at like a 45 degree angle and they landed at two different distances. Thats not just it looking like its going further, it IS going further.
---
*the enemy have eyes on the bomb*
---
That's not the shotguns fault. You shot like 1 shell where the centre of the spread was anywhere near his chest.
---
I'm gonna vomit
---
*general thatcherobi*
---
&gt; **Almost** all of the times I could just do that without being killed
---
lmao... so you mean it happened some of the time? 
---
dude, there's no way around this in a multiplayer game. it's not possible for the server and the users to always have the same data.
---
Not at all the only person
---
Are you really a fuse main if you don’t kill a teammate as well
