There's a difference between "a shooter that players compete in" and "a competitive shooter", in the genre sense. The former is more about fun. The latter, more about winning.

To me it was pretty cool, stop being a snob
---
Nokk is basically useless sadly, her ability isn't that good and the fact she lacks an acog and is only a 2 speed makes her not even that useful as a flanker
---
nomad you can cover many flanks with her and it‚Äôs more noticeable if they do trigger your trap
---
I enjoy her smg on her more than on smoke. And I love the [vortex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cuzz0k/vortex_holo_favorite_sight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) holo.

Thanks a lot! as my first video It wasn't going to be perfect but that praise feels really nice!  I aspire to be able to call myself a 'Professional video editor' one day! So the main problems were the millionaire intro and subtitles?

REPOST.

I don‚Äôt wanna be a killjoy but the iron cross is a nazi symbol

finish your kills if you got time left

Just so you know

---
- siege is hella toxic
---
- siege esports sisnt like siege comp
---
I'd rather have "garbage" teammates rather than one as toxic as ***you***
---
What the actual fuck lol. Lag or totally broken game (not surprised).
---
So you want to punish people for playing with others they're good with? Idiot
---
Wait where‚Äôs n√∏kk I can‚Äôt see her
---
its 2 feet deep, lady?
---
Happy cake day!
---
That's the hole point of the  marksman rifles low time to kill but short magazine as well
---
All this rotation does is potentially increase the crappy maps you can play in casual while decreasing the chance of playing an actual good map in casual. I wish we had map preferences or a voting system in casual so my party didn‚Äôt have to leave every single House, Yacht, Plane, Favela game.
---
Ok silver 5 calm down there
---
Hm, maybe i do have a med condition, because after I take a few sips of my Dr.Pepper or my juicy monster I usually end up having to go right away. But as for coffee it doesn't really do that to me.
---
&gt;They may not get back until prep phase is over. Depending on the operator that can be extremely detrimental. Jager for example since he takes the longest to get his utility down. But it's extremely useful utility. Bandit would be another since his batteries are generally needed early.
---
Okay yeah I see what you mean. I usually make sure I hurry the fuck up or finish placing kapkan traps before I leave. I usually get pissed when I have an afk mute or bandit on the team so I can definitely see where you're coming from in term of abuse.

Not giving comms all game isn't toxic though?

Haha yes I‚Äôm not the only mad N√∏kk cosplayer who plans to do this, though the outcome is less spooky than I envisioned. More of a ‚ÄúMom pick me up I‚Äôm cold‚Äù appeal.
---
My hope is that people who play like that and kick people for being the last man standing are also sending too many toxic reports and therefore have their privileges revoked. That being said, the algorithm could also use data from the match to determine the likelyhood someone was voted toxic simply because they were last man standing. Either that or maybe just add a clause where "people who are kicked while they are the last man standing are immune to negative toxicitt reports". There are definitely ways to avoid too much abuse of the system while overall improving gameplay for people who actually want to communicate and have fun.

No no no.  it should work as a combination of ying and glaz.  Auto adjusting for flash and stand still or slow walking to see through smoke.

Bro this guy just goes to random game pages and tries to defend the game every time. Don‚Äôt waste your time, this piece of shit truly has no life.

Amaru, the operator being released next season, has a grappling hook that allows her to ascend the hatches. The closest we have to shooting through reinforced walls is Maverick. I think being able to shoot through them with only a gun would be OP.
---
For the single game I played in copper, same. But silver and gold, and not to toot my own horn, I‚Äôve been the only good Mira I‚Äôve played with or against lmao. I‚Äôm glad not many people are good with her cuz Jesus fuck me she‚Äôs ridiculously amazing in good hands

So are we just making up terminologies now? Because that was an embarrassing statement
---
It happens in Pro League too so don't worry.
---
They even lose a 6-0 lead to 6-7
---
And casual lol
---
Nice ace! I don't know how Warden didn't hear the garage being opened though.
---
Bet you scared the shit out of some people
---
Tachaka is the only pick you should choose
---
I feel it. Lol but I am trying to get up out of copper. I can't be throwing like that
---
And after that they didn't gave green laser to Clash / Warden
---
Looks great!
---
It's time to find a different team.
---
Siege has made over a billion dollars in profit and growing. The playerbase is at its largest and is growing. Other games under ubisoft ownership like the division, ghost recon, watch dogs, and far cry use weapons that arent licensed, but are in the games.  
---
How is it when the game was smaller and struggling the content updates were better than they are now?
---
Bottom line is Ubisoft can afford to support the game better than ever before, but instead cuts corners to increase revenue. If they were honest and upfront with their plans the community would be more accepting. But they treat the community like they're stupid and make changes without adequate explanation of their intent or guiding principles. Likely because their intention isnt to make the best possible game, but to make the best possible cash cow to milk with the quality of the product being a secondary goal.
---
I guess it's buck's symbol, but what was the point?
---
We aren‚Äôt talking about the smg-11 though, we‚Äôre comparing shotguns.
---
I've always used Zalman Zm-Mic1 and no one has ever complained to be honest.
---
Thanks, i was thinking the same but maybe he was distracted by my teammate pushing site is my guess or just bad lol.
---
I had the same problem I just played by myself Solo Queue and I went up in rank alot. And I grinded and sweated now I'm better than them so it's good
---
[removed]
---
Ah but you see, the reason the shotgun is good, is because it can be paired with the smg
---

If they want 50 ops they're going to have to reuse weapons. It just saves memory too

can you show a tutorial on how to do it on pc?
---
I can never fuckin use hibanas primary and the SMG has just too much recoil for me. I can say I'm not a hibana player cause I'm too bad with her. I'm more of a revolver kinda guy, I play a lot of doc rook lion and recruit
---
What server?
---
Thanks, u/Hec70r0, very cool!
---
Yes my dude
---
Shit you just reminded me it‚Äôs been months since I cleaned it. Cheers mate

My editor wouldn‚Äôt let me trim it any shorter :(
---
r/juul
---
no.
---
Thanks
---
man just spawn peeked with a holo
---
Than it loses. If it needs another gun, it‚Äôs not the best shotgun in the game.
---
I just wanted to draw and decided to try and do Buck‚Äôs symbol for fun. I thought it turned out incredible so I posted it. I also wanted to see what people thought about my drawing too.
---
Nice cosplay! How long have you been working on it?
---
that's a really cheap good quality mic. I don't see the point in spending hundreds of dollar if you are not interested in streaming ;)
---
FOR THE EMPEROR
---
Warden reminds me of Soldier because they're both so friggn American, and Spy because they both have fabulous suits on
---
I‚Äôm gonna miss the hell out of plane
---
Ya go ahead that would be great. What's ur Insta
---
Good thing we can‚Äôt see OPs face, because it‚Äôs probably cold af in that water.
---
At least a couple minutes!
---
If you want to play more Hibana I'd suggest going a little lighter on the trigger.
---
Polio here we come
---
I can help if you're on PS4
---
On pc
---
cough cough 2fort night cough cough
---
Nope, an ace is all members of the enemy team. Unless the game itself counts them leaving after being downed as a kill it would just be a 4K
---
Partial ace, like wiping out a 4 player team. Close enough.
---
Pay the licensing for them, then :)
---
I would but technically no
---
Any of them. No op is really ‚Äòbad‚Äô, just different
---
one kill after a grapple? ok
---
How would you balance a one shot suppressed pistol?
---
Terrorist hunt is pretty bare bones as far as the AI go. I don‚Äôt think Ubisoft programmed the terrorists to pick up the hostage.
---
Exactly what I thought. I once slipped near water that look just like this and my foot (up to my ankles was under water for 10 seconds. Had shoes and socks on. In the shower I had to peel of 2/3 leeches.
---
If your on Xbox make a group post
---
Dont challenge the lord
---
It‚Äôs 1-3 now

I‚Äôm questioning when one has a lighter around, but no salt

Not sure which one you're talking about, but one of my (general) favorite is "Birch tree - Roy Hanley"

THEY‚ÄôRE OUTNUMBERED 15 TO ONE, AND THE BATTLE'S BEGUN
---
There should be a smiley face icon on the right side near the typing bar. That‚Äôs where you can get all the operator icons. Tell me if it worked. :))
---
Plus the BM is pretty good too
---
This hilarious but would be even funnier with lesion or bandito
---
I bought every season pass to show my support for this game, but this..... i think I‚Äôm gonna buy none of them now. I don‚Äôt mind buying a battle pass for clash royal, battle pass being not too expensive, and the game being free, but for r6? No way, I find this irrespectful the way they want to milk us out.
---
I think I‚Äôm done with Ubisoft game in general, I played division 2 for free, and the game looklikes rather a Christmas shop than a game, very disappointed. I was quite excited for beyond good and evil 2, but if they apply the same kind of monetisation to it, the game is already dead to me.
---
I think from now on I‚Äôm going to buy only games, where devs respect their fans like warframe, cdprojectred.
---
had bought season pass from steam store. but now buying of credits is open in India
---
Yeah for attack I‚Äôm leaning toward her first. Then maybe N√∏kk.
---
Dope!
---
That sucks 
---
Back to my point, you understand how this wouldn't work, unless you let ubi install cameras in your house.
---
Glaz. Incredibly strong operator. Instant-pick for a guaranteed win.
---
I feel
---
dont post my pics
---
Whoever you have the most fun with
---
he never denied that he cheated dude
---
Yea I get it i was just pissed and immediately posted
---
I'm pretty sure its frozen in time in late 2015, when the game was released.
---
Tachanka one difficulty rating
---
Don't worry, she's just 'borrowing' it.
---
Glaz? Lol maybe after update but current state I would avoid... maybe try Jackal. He has great guns, very handy ability and is easy to use.
---
i‚Äôve been bamboozled...
---
Hahahaha I didn"t even see it i was in a game
---
Would but my friend mains him
---
actual footage of me in prep phase running from who i teamkilled last round
---
If they could remove favela nobody would be upset.
---
Rare? Bit of an understatement.
---
He was strong like last season. He doesn‚Äôt get his thermal automatically now.
---
They're part of the base game, we paid for the base game so they should let us have every map in casual at all times
---
Hello the_bandito1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cwuaof/cracked/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I don't have a smiley face on the right hand side
---
Except you can get back in. It takes restarting your game, which is dumb, but you aren't gone for good.
---
Fuze ofc. Why frag other players, when you can frag the hostage?
---
But seriously tho I rlly like fuze, he has a shield if you want, but his ak and his lmg are both good options
---
Welcome to ranked
---
Really depends on your role, what you‚Äôre good at and the operators you generally like to play. Are you better as a support? Can you give good call outs and do good droning? Are you great at slaying?
---
Rip me, I made siege 1.0 from the start recoding every file, still better and more enjoyable, specially with acog + no recoil smg-11
---
They be like 12 tho
---
Or spraying almost an entire mag into a shield so that they know you‚Äôre there.
---
oh no it was you you downvoted?
---
Yea it was match point tho and I wouldn‚Äôt have time
---
play unranked
---
Idk I normally do whatever is needed
---
read my fucking post again
---
toxic I got -5 votes
---
Its still worth a try if it happens. Just keep what I said before in mind for future games. Never just accept defeat. Try it.
---
Just in case you wanted to know how the match went, we won with me as MVP Tachanka
---
Lol
---
Oh yikers. Yeah thats bad, I thought you were just complaining about getting booled on.
---
I think the battle pass will be your reward for playing more when it comes out, so rewards for leveling up wouldn't make as much sense.
---
So.....you are complaining about maps removed for **1 MONTH**, after which it is inevitably going to return?
---
Oh Lord....this sub just needs something to complain about at all times.
---
*Disgrace* smh
---
Agreed
---
It's 1 month. You'll get your broken sh*t cabbage waste pathetic maps (no offense, but I just hate house, favela, tower and plane) after 1 month. Nothing even worth wasting time complaining about. Trust me, 1 week in and you won't even notice.
---
**acog**
---
wait that‚Äôs illegal
---
Yeah I mean...those 2 are utter garbage.
---
I‚Äôve been rocking some glaz. He‚Äôs surprisingly effective.
---
Pre pre alpha siege &gt; siege now
---
Sad that house is gone but favela can burn in the pit of hell that it crawled out of in the first place
---
I played on on my friends PC and it was literally a 1v1 and people were started to vote to kick I got the kill and didn‚Äôt get kicked but it‚Äôs sad to see it on PC
---
To be fair even if all 5 did use comma you can still count that on your hand...
---
But I‚Äôm not too surprised, a lot of people just assume you know what they know.

IVE been playing ranked only for the PAST 10 MONTHS EVERY DAMN DAY
---
Technically it had two, one was an outside staircase.
---
But yes only one for the defenders. Was the map attacker or defender favored statistically?
---
Mate did you not read the seasonal patch notes?
---
They wouldn't be so dumb as to remove the maps as a whole (unless it's BU, the map that's so bad that it is a disgrace to siege itself because it was designed for PvE and not PvP).
---
Aug a2
---
You're completely misunderstanding; you could count the number of people *total*, in *4.5 years*, on one hand.  
---
Which means 5 or less.  
---
Or approximately 1 person per year.
---
Uuhh..... frost is waifu
---
now you know
---
Hell yea. Thats a must have!
---
Where the fuck is Bartlett
---
Why the fuck is Favela back
---
Plane is completely against Siege's gameplay. no window play at all. And tubular assault is good for rush practice but it makes aiming look like a child's play. Everything is lined up easy in plane, which isn't the case in any map.
---
And the literal only thing house has going for it is nostalgia.
---
sight doesn't matter, you can only use vert, but the general consensus is usually flash hider with compensator being a close second.
---
How? That option is still locked for me. Can't buy credits is currency packs. Are you using a VPN?

i've seen this before . I swear
---
I remember doing this a lot when I was still learning to play lol
---
I did it by logging into my account on the uPlay website and buying it there  or  you can start up rainbow 6 on steam it will open up uPlay so you can do shift + f2 and then go to store and buy it there

Can someone please send a discord link to me :((?

Funny you say that its actually so i can paly with my Girlfriend who is an almost exclusively console player. Will see how i go haha
---
I cant tell if this is TTS or live. if that is plat 1 on the TTS its because they're testing the champion ranks. In order to make people not grain to diamond and champion they are lowering it for testing just for now.
---
How about a voting system to which maps are included in the next rotation?  
---
Like if we're talking about 5 maps being rotated every cycle, the community decided 2 of the maps. (Yes you'll get repeats like House every time, but at least we have some say in the content here!)
---
I grew up in North Tampa and every time it rained the leeches would come up from the pond behind my house like 30-40 of them and they would get in my swimming pool. They died quickly, but still.

---
Hope that Ubi fixes, it's the max that you can do.
---
1340 hours in the game and 2 times everyone in my party played/spoke like you would imagine from a taktik game.
---
I am a high gold low platinum player on pc since operation health and I am so desperate that I would like the idea of a rook like body cam Operator just to know what my team m8 is doing. 
---
I played Echo twice as much than any other defender since I started playing the game and I definitely safed more rounds with my callouts to support other guys than I clutched with the callout of a team m8.
---
What is even more frustrating is that there is engouth reword for support players so that you don‚Äôt even need many kills to be high in the scoreboard.
---
I thought csgo was bad with callouts when I switched over but R6 is just a new level of people using no voice chat or starting to insult people when they say ‚Äûhello‚Äú.
---
Good luck.  My wife is salty I play on pc because I never liked siege on console. In her mind she thinks I don't want to play with her.
---
Have you heard about the brain eating amoeba?

And you can't turn it off midway and turn it back on while recharging but not full, like wtf?!

The ultimate edition only has the DLC operators released in the years before the purchase date + current season pass. 
---
For example, if you buy the ultimate edition now, you'll get The base game + DLC bundles year 1, 2 and 3 + Year 4 Year pass(season pass). 
---
You will not unlock any operators released in year 5 and onwards. You'll need to unlock then using renown or get the year 5 pass next year.
---
Back when obvious balancing changes was awaited by many for half a year or even more(i still don‚Äôt understand what took them so long with Ela and Blackbeard. Although they gone overboard with Ela).

IMO his gadget is way easier than Jaeger's. The MP7 and whatever the fucks Jaeger's rifle is, they're both solid and balanced to me.
---
Albeit both being placed and left there, you can bandit trick, or just leave the battery somewhere and shock things, it's too easy. But with the ADS, you gotta think if grenades or other projectiles are even gonna fly through said area, if not then the ADS is just collecting dust instead collecting points for you....and also saving your life.

Nice! It's a nice feeling to make one taps with the .44 auto mag üòÉ

I play in wus servers even though I get around 150 ping because I simply cannot find any matches on the Asia servers. I'm on xbox btw
---
nah it\`s casual
---
maybe...
---
You know the rest of your team is bad when the other team's top guy got more kills than ALL OF THEM. Also their second only getting one less... Oof.
---
Good carry my guy
---
Not to be a d-bag but pve was never really a focus of siege...if you couldn't tell by the fact that, you know, there is almost no pve content.
---
Thanks for the gold kind stranger!
---
Add ALL maps to casual even the shit ones because it‚Äôs CASUAL

Get sb to photoshop you into a bigger lake

The way he spun around made this look like a horror movie scene.

I mean sure Lesion can anchor. But it makes more sense to roam and spread out the Gus right? Slow down the attackers and get info on where they're coming from
---
In Australia, I sometimes play against Korea/Japan players (Chinese too). One time there was a diamond, a plat 2 and 3 coppers boosting.
---
(In a 5 stack obv)

Having 70/90 ping gave them an unfair advantage, along with the rank boosting.
---
I see that ACOG

Hii! Thank you all for the support ^^ 
---
Well i Got sum stuff to Say
---
1. I know the the headgear looks a bit weird and honestly when I got in the water the net was out of place (that‚Äôs why it looks so long), and I am not rich so the helmet it made by me out of worbla. Also I found the net in a danish military store but I‚Äôm sure you can find one on eBay as well.
---
2.  The water is FINE, don‚Äôt worry!! I didn‚Äôt get sick or anything but yes when doing these kind of pictures always be aware before going in water or something.
---
3. Don‚Äôt comment on my patches. I chose to not go with the j√¶gerkorps out of respect. I‚Äôm danish myself so I didn‚Äôt feel right going around with it. I also bought them on the same website where I bought net.
---
I replaced them with 2 patches that represent peace and friendship with tallin 
---
Sorry for bad English and if you have a hard time reading this lol
---
Thanks again!
---
Did i misread the battle pass? It was said to be free?
---
When you use a VPN it only shows your ping from your VPN location to the server, you also have to factor in that your server needs to connect to the VPN first.
---
Im good with bandit and not jaeger, im preety shit at the game so im sure this explains it
---

I hope your opinion dont Clash with mine

I speak Lebanese Arabic, which is a form of "traditional" Arabic. For the most part, the Arab countries (I use that as a general term) speak different dialects with similar core words and phrases. At times there are different pronunciations, and other times it's completely different words. 
---
For example if I ask an Egyptian person for milk in Lebanese Arabic (haleeb), they'll give me yogurt (leben), and vice versa. "Sheesha" (aka Hookah) is Egyptian, but in Lebanese Arabic it's "Argeeleh" (but both people would understand each other). 
---
There are some letters/sounds that are characteristic of each dialect. Like for example, Lebanese Arabic has a lot of French influence (French is commonly spoke there as well), so hard "G" sounds are substituted for smoother "J" sounds. For example there's a famous Lebanese singer named Najwa Karam. But in Egyptian Arabic, her name is pronounced (and would be spelled, if she were Egyptian) "Nagwa" Karam. 
---
So the reason I mention all of this is because, for the most part, if you were to sit, let's say, a Lebanese person, a Syrian person, and Egyptian personal, and a Palestinian person in a room, they could converse perfectly fine. But Morocco's language is *so* different and difficult to understand. Same for Algerian and Yemeni. Darija in particular has Spanish and French influence.
---
In the case of Kaid, I can actually understand a lot of what he says, because they're one-liners and things he yells, rather than longer phrases. It's kind of like, "oh that sounds like this word that I know". But more on the topic of Darija, it's just so difficult for a classic Arabic speaker to understand (Arabs know what I mean). If you want to know what I mean, here's a video: https://youtu.be/v6x_6K0OR3w

yea. their egos reach the moon whenever they destroy some silver 2's when they are asian diamonds with 200 ping. it happened before occasionally, but now it happens every time.

Did anyone else think the underbarrel was going to be a slug thrower when they saw his icon?

There's just as much pve content as pvp. Doesn't matter if it was the focus or not, constantly taking things away from the game will only drive more people away.
---
I disagree. We finally got a season without op broken ops.  I hopr every season is like phantom op in terms of phantom sight.

I want Blood Ice. Red White Black

Nice

I never liked flashes

he is ok and his pickrate has risen and will further rise because of amaru
---
Yeah still broken, what did you do to have multiple icons
---
Honestly just how lengthy the millionaire intro scene was, the rest of the video had great pace though.
---
I literally did nothing. I'm gonna try something real quick
---
As soon as I go into the menu (the main menu of the actual game)
---
\[ Everyone lliked that. \]
---
Uhhhhh
---
No you found a picture of a japanese archer
---
what graphics card do you have?
---
you forgot barbed wire, stun etc.
---
I guess just put it and wait a bit
---
That HEL really works wonders

You should make a goyo sculpt made of pure gold so he can be

Since it's a Halloween leak, I guess the only way for you to get it is through packs.

Oh. Well I just screwed myself. Epic

You should stop worrying about grenades now
---
Intel core i5 8th gen
---
probs from halloween packs
---
No downvote from me, it's a valid question. 
---
T-hunt is best played stupidly aggressively to practice for real games and the presence of barbed wire rooms, c4 rooms and bombers make that much more annoying. 
---
So most players on Reddit who probably take the game reasonably serious are happy to see him go.
---
it's called math.
---
Oh no, you will have to play the game properly instead of relying on a crutch.
---
Shaiiko supposedly had a macro meaning he‚Äôd fire the exact amount of bullets each time. But that‚Äôs pro play. Idk what it‚Äôs like for normal plebs like ourselves who play ranked.
---
stupid sexy flanders

---
Then - do you have source where they state it‚Äôll launch in X days?
---
you have to restart the queue after 2-3 minutes lol
---
And then there's lil Blessin who is getting carried around like a Kangaroo baby dropping 2 kills in 9 rounds and then flexing his platin 3 rank in casual lol
---
China vibes
---
This, as just one of the many reasons this move by Ubisoft is nonsense.
---
That's your processor, your CPU. I want your graphics card, GPU.

I'm 242 with 394,440

sorry but meh
---
3 weeks after test server, and they always release on a tuesday, so thats the 10th
---
Imagine waiting 10 minutes thinking that‚Äôs normal. Then another 5 just to take a picture.
---
Sorry idk computer lame check
---
what? so youre saying people arent meant to improve?
---
Is this supposed to be funny?
---
show me where i wrote that you get points when you run into barbed wire, you get points when you kill a guy while you are in barbed wire, and I'm calm, but you are just retarded mr gold.
---
Thats true
---
It's big brain time
---
Considering this is not the only "La casa de papel" skin (Hibana also has one), this will probably not be, unlike the other people saying in this thread, included in the Halloween event, since it would seem really weird for Ubi to make these two the only skins of the same theme in that event.
---
 I would rather guess that these will be in a seperate promotion/partnership, probably exclusively in bundles for the armor, headgear, charm, weapon. Another option might be paid packs (Halloween or another), the fully fledged battlepass, although both of these are highly unlikely, because of the reason named above for the halloween packs, for another set there are too little skins and the battlepass is unlikely as well, because then these would be only leaked battlepass skins, which seems quite unlikely.
---
TL:DR : No prices known, but expect these to be R6Credits only, or part of an exclusive promotion.
---
Ayyyyy, I felt the same way when I got it. Did you have to do the terrorist hunt ones?
---
This shit broken af

Also, Lesion is roamer

Remember, dead meme

I still almost always choose her because of her usefulness.

Yep, did all but the win 20 games, 200 headshots and the 50 pen kills

Dear sir, I never insulted you as you are doing, because I'm not a shitty person, if you can't make a sentence, it's not my fault.

---
But there are so many maps, for new players the learning curve is just insane. Of course when you know these maps its no problem, but if you dont its a real issue
---
The newest ACOG is the best one now IMO but if they'd let us use whatever sight we wanted within the allowed types I'd have been using the Russian ACOG over the normal one this entire time. I vastly prefer a sight that wants me to put it ON the target rather than it pointing AT the target.
---
nah dude the bullet just curved :)
---
Are you the trees
---
Server lag
---
I like the reflex and red dot but I prefer the normal holo and acog
---
I'm pretty sure you can turn off shadows idk tho
---
Looks better than the actual skin, gj
---
You want people's shadows though
---
*cries in ruined t-hunts*
---
Eh fair enough
---
The spear actually does exist. It‚Äôs a prototype that never went in to actual production
---
At least this is better than the game crashing whenever loading is involved.
---
we are talking about how many points you can get when killing a guy, so you are actually a retard, and I checked who you are, mr first time plat 3 and thinking I'm god.
---
NANI?!
---
Apparently no one wants to play at 4 in the morning
---
hello darkness my old friend...
---
Next step should be make the visor able to use RGB lights.
---
Being shot while shooting a speaker is the worst.
---
This convinced me to get the elite
---
I didn't expect a pro to have such a flawed opinion.
---
Ah yes because sometime when I melee it‚Äôs too loud so it is a very great idea that I should shoot the barricade because no one will hear or see my bullets
---
You can't get kicked in ranked.
---
Sad.
---
What if dokk hacks your phone... +Drones
---
Absolutely remarkable. Looks even better than in-game.
---
Beautiful.
---
Problem with the way the ‚Äúmake shields useless,‚Äù council has decided to go about those nerfs is that Ubi initiated them without pairing lethality nerfs with support buffs or drastic bug fixes/latency improvements. 
---
They nerfed something already extremely inconsistent from a user perspective, shields get shot and melee‚Äôd through all of the time.
---
You can tell me all you want about those few times a Blitz/Monty caught you with your pants down, but the truth is any good defender with a head on his shoulders could always beat a shield unless
---
- Their team didn‚Äôt work with them in dispatching the shield
---
- They are bots
---
A better decision would have been to have been to debut these nerfs alongside some fixes/buffs.
---
Instead, Ubi just flat-out killed them, limiting every single combat mechanic to the point of making shied operators glorified spectators that. Can barely defend themselves.
---
If shields are to remain this harmless, they need to be even harder to kill.
---
&gt; Grow up? I play games to have fun, I didn't realise that was considered childish.
---
Whinging about something that has zero effect on your ability to play the game or your enjoyment of the game is childish.
---
&gt;Having yet another system clamouring for my wallet is really annoying.
---
So ignore it. "Clamouring" is just dishonest.
---
&gt;Apart from the very maps themselves and the occasional event charm/skin, anything they add to the game is purchasable with, or only through premium currency/real money.
---
So "apart from the cosmetics" everything is free. I don't see a problem with that.
---
&gt;But to add a battle pass on top of a season pass on top of all the other things is stupid, it feels bad, it feels unrewarding, it's greedy.
---
Unrewarding in what way? You're just throwing out words that are mostly irrelevant as objection.
---
&gt;And their greed ruins some of that fun for me. That's my problem.
---
"Greed" being offering things for sale in this case.
---
But why???? I mean unranked is coming anyway so casual will be there to fuck around. Let's be honest, who doesn't love Yacht and Favela in casual?? They may not be good maps but they're fun for sure, who cares anyway if people dc right away because they don't like the map in casual?
---
Imo they should add all maps to the casual playlist and maybe add the option to prioritize certain maps over others
---
why not?
---
Uzbekistan is not a Russian country

I paused the vid, and the second one was a clean hit to the leg. Definitely should've been a down.

september 10th
---
Yeah fuck'em every damn time with lone wolf
---
It was a *soviet* country
---
Because this is the r6 page not the wow page? ...
---
You should just remove favela, yacht and tower all together. Terrible maps
---
You were lagging I think
---
1. Pick and ban. You get to be strategic with the bans and practice scenarios for certain maps for ranked. 
---
2. Competitive maps. I get play on viable maps without the fear of getting Tower or Favela for the 5th time in a session.
---
3. Bomb. I get to play bomb in these competitively viable maps for practice.
---
4. Practice. For when I want to play actual ranked, I now have a mode where I can practice new strats and scenarios without fear that my experiementation will cost me MMR.
---
5. Mentality. This mode has a higher chance of attracting people who actually give a damn about the game and are going to take it seriously. That breeds a more engaging and fun gaming experience.
---
While I‚Äôm here just drawing stickmen
---
yeah but it's the legend fabian
---
And?..

Yeah that means that one of the main languages in usbekistan is russian and also alot of russian people live there

Nothing compared to 400k though!
---
Aight thank you!
---
lol tfw console shitter can't get over the fact that the shot wasn't even that good
---
Yeah and you can clearly see blood coming out his face when I shot him and in the kill cam so stop being a fucking dipshit
---
Hey, why don‚Äôt we just remove one more map?  Why not two?  Why not remove four maps each new season?  Or maybe we should just have one single map for casual and ranked, to keep things straightforward?  How about we stop designing new weapons and just mostly recycle old ones for new operators?  Oh, we‚Äôre already doing that one?  How about I just remove the game from my hard drive?
---
Bro Mira lookin kinda hot
---
Looks much better than the in game elite for sure. Great job!

It is more tame on US servers but on EU its no mans land at least

No genuinely i like to see other good console shots pc hacker acts as if the master race when console make most of the siege community

Hehe no not really but it's annoying when we're all in a discussion thread to talk about pros and cons and you get only downvotes instead an answer :)
---
But you're also right. I think he teached us very good lessons to aim correct under a high pressure situation.
---
If they dont add in s3 i think there is not gona be bundle because of price reduction every season, that my prediction. They said it once that they need to change price of bundle because of this changes.
---
looks better than the one they‚Äôve put out
---
That doesn‚Äôt make it a Russian country the same way Canada isn‚Äôt a French country and The Philippines not a Spanish country

Honestly, valk is a super strong. You basically need an IQ to counter her in higher levels (plus echo), and when you also need a thatcher, hard breacher, needing an IQ makes line ups so samey.

This means cams will be harder to hide, and you're more likely to see them without an IQ.

they already had that before they removed they are dumbing it down and removing any option and having less content overall for the sake of esports
---
Never mess with the bois.
---
Rook is a roamer
---
yes he is a solid pick
---
What people??? You're talking about people trying to get a plague doctor skin which is the exact opposite of what I'm talking about. And 1 conversation about 1 topic does not share with you my views on the rest of the game, in all honesty you're what's wrong with society...
---
ah yes especially hibana
---
Next season if Ubi follow through that should be fixed.
---
i have linked it several times in the comments! &lt;3

---
Actually he can tank 2 - 3 headshots depending in the dmg per bullet of your weapon. If your weapon dealt less than 40 dmg per bullet it was 3 headshots, if it did above 40 dmg per bullet it was 2 headshots. In case you need 4 shots in his face you either: A) you missed a shot or B) you shot his neck (which in Thunt isn't a insta kill = headshot like in PvP).
---
Thanks my guy
---
Now I can practice blitz without dying in 30 seconds
---
&gt; Which it doesn't.
---
Which it most likely will once the battle pass launches for the aforementioned reasons.
---
&gt; So what? I've not paid a penny for credits and own all but one op and I really don't play that much anymore. You're moving the goalposts too...
---
*Anymore*. I don't know how much you used to play this game so this point might as well be nonexistent. And I don't think I'm moving the goal posts. There have been quite a few games where "you can get everything for free", but everything is ridiculously overpriced.
---
&gt; Such a fucking awful analogy.
---
Maybe, I'm not the most creative when it comes to analogies. But I do think it's quite apt, simply dismissing it by saying it's awful does not a good point make.
---
&gt; And most of that is just whinging over nothing.
---
You don't really care about the subject so it may seem like nothing to you but it matters to me.
---
Then ... don't buy the skins? What exactly is your problem?
---
Stay frost-y

Not through in game but going to their website

It definitely is

I think you mean Twitch but, I'll allow it.

Having seen Valkyrie's [pre-rework face](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-gb/game/rainbow6/siege/valkyrieba_296939.jpg) during *Dust Line*, I have to point out that her current one is already a *massive* improvement. As for Mira, I got used to her face [from](https://i.imgur.com/5lhrDLL.jpg) [launch](http://i.imgur.com/SxIjXnp.png) so I'm not all that fond of her current one.
---
Solid pick for Frost though. I'd pick the cutest 3 as Dokkaebi, Ying, and Frost.

Ubi's site? You'd have to pay in euros, right?

Yeah, i'll take Thermite's breaching charges &amp; frag grenades back while you're at it.

I want skins that don't look like shit

I guess it‚Äôs because I have a 560 gtx (it‚Äôs my secondary pc)
---
Oh please just stfu its obvious you don't know anything about society. I bet you're one of those people always complaining. Ash and lesion both have moderns skins BUT THEY ARE BAD because it has nothing to do with them, nothing to do with their abilities and they're overall shit. If you don't like the skin why don't u go and make one? Oh that's right u can't because you're just kid whining behind the computer. Mira's skin is great because it represents who she is. There's still a lot of us that appreciate the lore of the game. That's why it exists.
---
Audrey Ramirez from Atlantis is an I can think of looking at this lol
---
https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Audrey_Ramirez
---
&gt; Which it most likely will once the battle pass launches, for the aforementioned reasons.
---
Just conjecture.
---
&gt;Anymore.
---
Yeah, for the past five seasons or so.
---
&gt;And I don't think I'm moving the goal posts.
---
You complained about stuff not being free and then you change that to well you can't realistically get all the free stuff. You thinking you haven't is irrelevant.
---
&gt;But I do think it's quite apt, simply dismissing it by saying it's awful does not a good point make.
---
It doesn't map onto the situation we're talking about. Not remotely apt.
---
&gt;You don't really care about the subject so it may seem like nothing to you but it matters to me.
---
Back to doubling down on your misreading.
---
Everyone always talks about his gadget when this stuff. Sure ads‚Äôs are important to the meta. But jager also has one of if not the best guns on defense AND he‚Äôs a 3-speed. There is much more to jager‚Äôs huge pickrate and win rate than just having a good gadget. Plus capitao bolts ignore jager ads‚Äôs and he‚Äôs been pretty big these past seasons.
---
Got any other ones

i would love to see their ranks after

Either pay for it or don't. I agree with you. If people want exclusive content then pay for it. Everything leading up to now could be purchased with ingame currency.
---
That sounds fun, but you can only use now 3 shields in ranked due to the recruit being banned
---
Good thing i'm an echo main.

So from time to time, they will replace ok maps with dogshit ones? Yeah, no thanks.

I don‚Äôt see anything.

You act all high and mighty cause you played ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù you‚Äôre just spoiled by the fact that it‚Äôs easier to make new gadgets when there‚Äôs less gadgets in the game.

Also, brainwashed? Really? Brainwashed? You really think Ubi BRAINWASHED me to like their game? Pathetic.
---
They have 20+ maps as it sits, which is hard for new players to get a hold of. And there‚Äôs already 100+ unique guns. But that‚Äôs STILL not enough for you. Cause you‚Äôve been playing since launch and you should get all the new free stuff, right?

Please stop.

someone doesn‚Äôt play lion

---
Hopefully those smoothbrains at ubisoft do something when I submit a video
---
Kys you isis kid
---
I play ps4 and I‚Äôm turning 15 in 7 days, if u wanna play I‚Äôd be down, I have a friend who could play with us too, my average rank is gold and sometimes silver, but I‚Äôm down to play.
---
*silence*
---
You don‚Äôt speak for all players.
---
I personally welcome these changes, and I‚Äôve been playing since year 1.
---
Gonna miss spawnpeaking on yacht, one of me and my freinds favourite maps just for the silly spawnpeak that rarely works. Also gonna miss house and plane for generally the same reason
---
Looks great! Did you make this yourself?
---
Yes i posted on r6 amino too
---
Thanks dude
---
You didnt seem to read what i typed,i said id glady support them but im sick of people like you acting like we are getting these new awsome changes into the game and attacking people who dont wanna protend,i have noting to stop with as im just stating why people are mad,you can hate me personlly but a lot of older members will agree with me.
---
Lmao frost mats
---
The kiddy diddler
---
Maybe he's smiling about his pointless gadget; thinks it works when it's in fact shit.
---
Good! Valk is super strong. Cameras are incredibly useful and shouldn't be invisible/super hard to find.
---
Blitz
---
I had to scroll surprisingly far for this one. I thought this was an alternative version of that character at first
---
If it's only between those two, pro league looks better in my opinion.
---
Well it was 28 celsius and i was wearing half a uniform so it was Pretty nice
---
Is that the Omnitrix?
---
pro league weapon skins are nice but they should have done gridlock's m249 instead of her ar. or just do both weapons in the future ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
They have actually already said this is a problem in the test server. If you message them about it it will just piss them off
---
I‚Äôm debating being a warden main
---
Just cause YOU don‚Äôt like the changes doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of us shouldn‚Äôt be able too. Grow up.
---
Everybody lookin extra thicc
---
Update from Craig Robinson on twitter, [https://twitter.com/ItsEpi/status/1144012474372542464](https://twitter.com/ItsEpi/status/1144012474372542464)
---
But you just said that you are sick of people complaining way too much?
---
Im very excited if you couldnt tell:))))
---
Again, it all depends on the relative skill difference between the two teams.
---
not valk tho
---
Doesn't work on Mac tho.
---
This is beautiful
---
You didn't believe in the Mossberg hard enough
---
Anyone else find mechanic girls hella cute?
---
skin name?
---
I didn't need to hear that.
---
That notification lol
---
Chaos screwed me up.
---
I hope you do get banned. The toxicity in Siege is ridiculous at the moment.
---
Yeah and even the base ops are still extremely good.  A bulk of my playtime is spent with those ops.  Mira, Lesion, and Hibana are really the only dlc ops I have a lot of playtime with otherwise.
---
Good to see. Even though it‚Äôs such a minuscule detail I had noticed they started reusing sound assets after red crow (ex: every gun reload sounding the exact same)
---
#_Yet_
---
Rip
---
This guy doesn't even wanna play the game and he's giving us his opinion
---
I feel that.
---
I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs gone ember rise I have to run for like 3 minutes to not die and it takes three headshots or like forty body shots to kill
---
But Capitao is 15k renown
---
This man is a thief!!!!
---
Yo if hadn't already post this on r/art they eat this stuff up and this a nice drawinh
---
Height as a shield op especially blitz is your enemy never rush up stairs
---
No I was going up and down 30 points and only lost 11 to that team
---
yes ofc but deducting 68 points again withoug playing for a week already is just hilarious. Even i win without hacker teammates against a obviously spawn killing hacker i sitll got deducted lmfao. nvm this game is just hilarious
---
No, its the old graphiccard of a friend a gtx 560
---
Maps are free to everyone at any time. Certain operators have their specific weapons they can use, and they are free with that specific operator.
---
it's getting fixed.
---
 This is so funny for some reason
---
I had same thing happen in 1v1 with a friend, fixed it by throwing out a drone and pressing the camera button multiple times or something, but after that theres no sound beside ingame music and the comentator so i had to restart the game. And thers a far worse glitch about, i encountered it and made a post.
---
thanks!
---
Yup, considering in the base game you can get for like $15 you get Sledge, Thatcher, Smoke, Mute, Thermite, Ash, Pulse, IQ, Blitz, Bandit, Jaeger, Twitch, Monty, Rook, Doc - i mean I'd only consider that Castle, Glaz, Fuze, Kap, Tachanka are the non competitive ones on that list. There's plenty of top operators on there.
---
does it work on penguins?
---
Even the building is the same
---
That‚Äôll do it
---
Fuck the piece of shit bomber
---
No it‚Äôs not the monitor, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worrying about
---
I don't see a problem. It's as if the game never happened. You talk about deducting got not playing in a week, I used to play once in 2 weeks and I still wouldn't have had a problem, and a month ago i was in elo hell. The match never happened, and that's ok. A scum was sent to hell and that's a win in my books.
---
Bring back night mode in casual too
---
Hit_Reg.exe has stopped
---
I really want an incentive for people not to leave, it‚Äôs annoying. I like what reach did, continuous completion of matches lead to possibly getting a little extra renown
---
And getting voted to kick before you even have a chance to play
---
ironic
---
So quick question. What exactly is that leaderboard? Is this a PC only thing?
---
Yes there live service is good unlike battlefront 2 which is the only other game I can currently think of
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm doing a funeral for him then. Just buying a new on wish (jk)
---
Yeah where is a karambit even used?
---
stepping on legos doesn't hurt at all idk how this became a meme
---
&gt; 3-0 :)
---
thanks for the reply
---
Ok, i will Post it
---
Idk, it makes sense to me. I'm still kind of a new player and I feel like with the sheer amount of maps available for casual it's just daunting to try and learn any one of them. The second I feel like I'm finally learning one map, it doesn't show up again for 15 more games.
---
It should be like titanfall, $5 for 1 prime titan.
---
Coming from you? I know right?
---
thanks, I will try it when i get home
---
The maverick knew what was coming
---
Yes pc, but‚Äôs my secondary pc which isn‚Äôt the best
---
People do this on pc too. There have been plenty of times where someone on my team gets deleted and then bails from the game out of embarrassment
---
Damn imagine having that awful throw :/
---
cam city has been ranked number 1 for most cams yet everyone still comes here
---
For me, I‚Äôve only been playing for a round 3 weeks. I always get kicked form matches, I wish they would give people a chance
---
im not saying they should get rid of all the microtransactions just the BOOSTERS!
---
What do you play on?
---
Yea no prob, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs 70% right now
---
i dont understand the match never happened you are saying lol
---
&gt;But what the hell you think in unranked mode there is no retarded kids who leaves and kicks to the left and right?
---
There will definitely be some, sure. But the people who do that will usually do so in casual. Any sort of competitive playlist doesn't interest them, so they mostly stay away from unranked. Also, they won't be able to kick anyone. Unranked has the same rules as ranked and in ranked the vote kick option isn't available. 
---
&gt;R6 community doesn't need to split in a half in a fear of lossing 20 mmr points.
---
The community is large enough to where matchmaking times won't see a significant increase. We'll be fine.
---
Its been 2 months
---
probably people walking with work boota only
---
Beautiful you can draw really well.
---
Yup
---
no they just don't hurt
---
It's a 3rd party software on PC called R6 Tracker that you can show the player's ranks and stats over the scoreboard. You can see players ranks as soon as you start the match on ranked and see how good the enemy team is.
---
Username checks out.
---
xbox bro
---
PREACH
---
I feel the same way. Bombers are the only challenging part of THunt and they're actually amazing for teaching you to score headshots under pressure. Regular terrorists don't do that, because they get staggered after a bodyshot - maybe Ubi will make them more difficult enemies in order to compensate?
---
Some issues with graphikscard? (sry if i write wrong i don't speak eng)
---
Platinum weapon skin in tts
---
1. Why r u talking in 1st person
---
2. Doesnt Fuze have just 5 pucks?
---
You're gonna step on a frost trap!
---
ok i should of said EMO LIFE
---
Sometimes it's best to not even shoot and just follow the drone. drone hunt the shit out of it but dont shoot. Until the prep phase ends and then you pounce!
---
why did i think of "breakbot - baby im yours" when i saw this
---
Idk someone thought about darude sandstorm
---
Yeah i thought so..
---
Like from renown right?
---
I always do this with Clash, it's hard, but it saves ammo.
---
I was taking a closer look, and i did shot above his head as well.. That sucks..
---
I‚Äôve had a couple PS4 games recently where I‚Äôve been DDOSed for the majority of the rounds but absolutely slaughtered them when they haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs shit players doing it for an easy diamond.
---
Looks like the Little Mac wireframe
---
I would rather say tjat was lucky kill by lesion
---
Ikr
---
What a shite diamond
---
Nah he lowered his shot to hit you in the head he just had good reactions
---
Ah yes
---
Yes!! If I could give gold I would.
---
You can fire .308 in a 7.62x51 rifle, but not vise versa. 7.62x51 has a wider bullet than .308, but .308 is usually loaded with more pressure than 7.62x51. .308 and the 7.62 types (7.62x51 and 7.62x39) are separate rounds and not just the "americanized way" of saying it. Same with .50 and 12.7mm, because the true measurements of .50 caliber is .510 in, which is 13.0mm (or 12.95 without significant figures applied). Don't take this me being condescending, just educating you on how things are.
---
Firstly the skins sucks , i do hope they give back the operators icon charms or the countries of the OPs , and as you said the 417 for twitch and the L1A1 for buck??? Im mad
---
I would play the game with my brother and his friend so we had dibs on who we could unlock next so I can‚Äôt even pay for a operator pack because I own 70% of them
---
Really appreciate your answer
---
Sometimes the close ones really suck, best thing to do is tweak your sensitivity by 1 or 2 to fine tune.
---
This shit was embarrassing to read
---
The person shared his knowledge with everyone just go get this comment of yours
---
Fuck you
---
No go ahead!^^
---
Sound like a thermal issue. Watch your temps while you game / stress test and you should see something get really hot and start throttling. Reapply thermal paste on that.
---
That's what i wanted to hear, thank you Lord, i'll try it!
---
Mira is hot with this skin. I like
---
Yeah seeing the other replies mate I see I was wrong. Probably shouldn't have commented on something I have no clue on tbf coming from pc
---
Just console problems.
---
I'm glad I stopped playing on console, anything related to aim on a joystick is an absolute pain.
---
*don‚Äôt mind if i diddly do!*
---
-our lord and savior
---
I would agree these on Lion but on twitch? The F2 its god, low recoil, average damage , godly rpms
---
Classic
---
If you buy it on steam you still have to make a uplay account right?
---
We all just going to ignore Ela??
---
Secure area is fine though so who cares
---
ya its one of the few maps i get hyped for, like O YA ITS HOUSE TIME! Its definitely an interesting map with the garage/rest of the house dynamic.
---
Nice shit talking you cancerous bastard.
---
Nice reaction
---
UBI FIX
---
It‚Äôs never too late to learn! Im 25 and im teaching myself to draw for the first time!

And I have now found my new screensaver
---
Sledge or buck. I wanna say buck is the only attacker whose gadget refills when you refill your ammo.
---
I think unranked is gonna be fun tho, I refuse to play ranked kuz I don't have friends that play the game and solo cue-ing is a nightmare, but the ruleset is awesome.
---
Uh.. Horizontally?
---
Ty dad
---
Unless you know what you're doing. But I guess I can't deny what you are saying.
---
Why does sledge need a buff?
---
What task are you trying to accomplish? 
---
Each operator specializes in something.
---
Recruit
---
This should of been his elite.
---
This is when you realized you still have 2 reinforced walls unplaced.
---
Yes
---
Just in general in ranked I don‚Äôt know though
---
my fav maps :(
---
That gave me so much anxiety
---
Yea the charms were a lot better and I miss them
---
These are the type of people who think bb needs a buff, don't mind them.
---
Ranked
---
he failed, i am silver 4
---
Rotating\*. Rotational casual map pool.
---
Probably because you have the weight of a sheet of paper.
---
Where is lesion I dont see him
---
i don't see this enough, the m&amp;k players on console need to be told frequently that they aren't good.
---
Speaker/headphone quality maybe
---
Because secure.
---
Bye but fuck him
---
Actually it had meaning even 2 years ago. It‚Äôs a repost.
---
I guess they chillin at situations right?
---
#right?
---
Ela and ash look like their talking about how BROKEN they used to be
---
I absolutely fuckin' despise anime.
---
Texture quality is the setting you want to lower down  to improve loading time.
---
Yep! dump a whole F‚Äôing mag into there head and the just come up and kiss ya.... can‚Äôt miss them til they‚Äôre gone.
---
I grew some kind of love for Bombers with time. They sometimes mess your t hunt when practicing with music (or just regular ones), but they are a really good test for headshots. The neater you are with your spread, the faster they fall, and you can see all your bullet hitting their faces. Also if you are practicing one shots, you have a double target. And always the hurry to take them down before they come close. Ah, and also, they run, so that is another good thing for target practice.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Only thing that bothers me is that after playing hundreds of T Hunts I feel that sometimes I can hear them (that sizzle) even in maps where there are no bombers.
---
They are not that bad even with music as they have that blue light... but well you should be able to choose if you want bombers or no... or even better, if Ubisoft would let us design our practice matches (infinite respawn of harmless enemies in the spot we want, choose terrorist path and speed, etc etc).
---
they evolved, sometimes they do this annoying shit where they dont make any noise and just crouch near a doorway, waiting in ambush
---
Ela with shotgun is great, imagine a sasg but wielded by a 3 speed
---
(and its the only option with controllable recoil)
---
Gonna credit u/charles_ryon or something?
---
Oh shit kill him he nows too much
---
True
---
shhh.... you'll anger it
---
I thought twitch was on echo
---
Couldn't disagree more. Aside from basement, there are just way too many openings for attackers to peek into. It punishes roaming heavily.
---
I got smacked square in the face through my shield as monty fully deployed.
---
That‚Äôs impossible, he is infallible and always got the job done. 
---
*You failed him*
---
Frankly, I'm really, really pissed off about this. I hate playing Ranked, and the Unranked mode isn't all that appealing to me either. I don't want to get less content in the game for the money I put down in the season pass. They shouldn't touch the Casual playlist; they should put all the maps into it and let it be *fun,* because it's *Casual.*
---
if the whole team gets the buff and he gets the 2 speed he probably would be extremely good, like the whole team can't get flashed and can see through smokes, would be atleast a must pick on some spots in pro league
---
I see Maestro grilling, acting like the step-dad that is attempting to connect with his wife's kids.
---
HAHAHA BANDIT
---
Plss tell me this was in casual
---
I'm not even a console player but imo this should 'nt be allowed
---
if everyone only wanted to dance party, then ubi would yes have to add music
---
dont forget this a "ESPORTZZZ" shooter, except like other ones (overwatch, csgo, pubg) not only do we have 0 training range to practice our aim ingame, but also no replay system. t hunt is the sorry excuse for practicing in r6, even after like 4 years
---
so yes, t hunt should be t hunt. but if ubi are being so lazy &amp; greedy to never make a mode where we can practice, then they have to adapt t hunt for aiming. (it still sucks because there is still random c4)
---
So that‚Äôs the same story between .223 and 5.56mm then. Interesting
---
Ig maybe in the above convo what op said would be good like he has to activate them  and then they get activated for whole team so he has to be still alive
---
I feel extra pressure when shooting drones as I think "ohhh they will know that I suckkkkk".
---
After ranked lost so many maps I can‚Äôt believe your complaining about a rotation
---
Ubisoft should make a playlist called  *Trash map only 
---
consisting of Bartlett. U, Favela, Yatch, Tower and Hereford Base. That way, people who complain about this change can play these maps with the twelve other people who enjoy them.
---
LOL
---
Not consistent with multiplayer so fuck him
---
+420. Nice!
---
That's kinda sad
---
wouldnt affect me irl at all, i step in these every time in-game, even after im the one who calls out theres a frost
---
He's in the water caring twitch
---
Tower has such a nice aesthetic- it's such a shame the map is terrible (the worst imo in the game). If they reduced the size and added more vertical play, it could be very fun to play.
---
The only time mouse and keyboard imo is allowed on console is for the disabled players who can't use a controller properly due to whatever their situation may be.
---
It should be more like jackal where it's toggle on/off only. And should be able to still see through smoke when walking.
---
I really hate that 6 logo on her hood. Ruins her creepy look.
---
Thank you! I sent you a DM. Apologies on the vague DM.
---
I would like that
---
yes but the vector has 1200rpn and scorpion has a 1080rpm
---
Can you give a .svg or .ai file of your differents R6 logos or you keep this private ?
---
Yee i assumed they would like going out cause dokkaebi is tech geek AMD smoke just looks like someone who doesn't go out
---
Score is 2:2 and it's overtime, so yeah, it was casual.
---
Nah, IMO it's cool seeing corporations use up-to-date memes. Makes me feel that people are making this pathetic fucking world a better place
---
It's cav!

The sasg has controllable recoil though

and? they are different operator

For some reason his icon to me looks like a shark with a mustache idk why though.

Holy shit this blew up XD do you guys want me to post more?

Im coppin when this comes out

you set yourself up

I just play pc. To assert dominance

Wow.

Oh dindt watched the overtime, I asked because i would feel abd for him/her if thus happen in ranked

I'm talking about the skorpion, sorry should have made that clearer

---
Translation:fuck you get gud
---
I couldn't decide which elite to buy the other day so I gave up. Now I know thanks
---
Nice.
---
Dont worry about tips. The newcomers list and casual are purely mechanics. Find a sens that fits for you and just play. Its really only later that you have to worry about competitive and map callouts etc.. Just have fun!
---
I must say that is compelling and you are in fact right. I never thought of it but it‚Äôs true. A close friend of mine was born with a permanent deformity, specifically his left hand, his left hand has a full thumb, a half sized index finger and the rest are mostly bumps with no real use. 
---
He‚Äôs found ways to adapt to everyday life but he wasn‚Äôt borne into a time where accessibility wasn‚Äôt at the height of concern for the average person.
---
He plays on a normal PS4 controller, he plays a right handed bass, upside down and to the left. He‚Äôs found ways to adapt and overcome his obstacles, but I‚Äôm sure he would have been happy to have a bit of help, to put him on even playing field, growing up as opposed to having to improvise his entire life.
---
Or maybe not as he‚Äôs a very proud and stubborn person lol.
---
Now das hot
---
Kapkan lookin chunky as ever. Love it
---
Play t-hunt to get used to the recoil and learn the maps. As far as gun play it is much more up close and personal and pace really depends on map and operators but generally i find it slower than bf. But my biggest piece of advice is to not give up on learning the game. There is a HUGE learning curve. Ive been playing for a few years now and still learning new things. But anyway welcome to community and i hope you have fun playing!
---
The 25k ops are 5 bucks
---
Agreed. It bothers me when I hear, "Well if we were on PC you'd be dead."
---
Heck ya
---
Really? That'd be my fantasy
---
lol not one of those bullets hit the head
---
You. Should always try to have an idea of where the enemy is positioned before pushing in, this is the main way to win a gun fight in siege.
---
Also recommend watching rogue 9 to get and understanding of the games engine and stats
---
This is good I like it

Been having ton of ping spikes since Monday. Will be steady around 9-35 for some time then spike to 150-350 even though my party chat is fine and not lagging.
---
I think his point was that in a game with a one headshot mechanic, full auto weapons and high RoF will always win; Kaid is a keen example of a full auto weapon not having a high RoF which suggests his more effective weapon is the shotgun/dmr hybrid
---
I love Pulse lmao. Also I applauded you for Doc‚Äôs facial express haha
---
https://youtu.be/8CViM5hKX-U
---
Pretty sure that's his mask
---
Lesion you mean CARGO SHORTS
---
Son of a bitch
---
Cav one i think shots just barely missed the head, as for jackal, thats bs but the reason why is there is a slight delay w his movements compared to what u see. So you see him getting shot in the head but for him he was moving left to avoid the shots at where he was, the game is amazing and terrible, but i love it.
---
Nope next driver update it worked perfectly fine. Only happend in siege aswell.
---
Take a look at R6Fix and see how many bugs are submitted. Yes, this should be a priority, but they do have to sift through thousands of bugs between the live server and the test server. It was up to 15k last I checked. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to defend Ubi or anything, but it isn‚Äôt as simple as them just being lazy
---
Wait why
---
*feedback*
---
Or ubi could just get their shit together and just fix the system but I guess that would be to much to ask
---
That‚Äôs another question: are there any operators that are particularly useful in certain situations? Or is it just personal preference?
---
Good riddance. Now I can play TH in peace...
---
Dude you can‚Äôt be kicked in ranked. Only in casual, this means that you aren‚Äôt loosing any ELO because casual doesn‚Äôt affect your stats.
---
I can smell the ‚Äúmad cus bad‚Äù message right after that
---
Funny you say that since every shotgun is getting buffed next update. Every. Single. One.
---
the thing is, a plague doctor wouldn't make any sense
---
What‚Äôs funny is that people will call you trash from the bottom of the scoreboard because you use controller, even though you‚Äôre outplaying and outranking them.
---
just get a pc. pc master race ;)
---
hey i‚Äôm down to play w u sometime, my user is nyatsumichi add me if you‚Äôd like :) have fun!
---
No fucking way, wtf are they thinking
---
Well.......ok actually true
---
Ish
---
This is painful to watch
---
Reading this thread gave me cancer omg. Everyone that‚Äôs teamed with a hacker gets elo from that match taken away. If you lost to a hacker you will get that elo back. Just this weekend I logged on and got 80 points added back.
---
Howdy
---
Lol, here come the kiddos.
---
I get what ur saying but a mouse and keyboard isn‚Äôt very expensive so they‚Äôre pretty much accessible to everyone
---
Like jackal getting shot fuzzy your screen
---
Suprised your post is still up. Every time I post about ddosers or hackers the mods remove it. Sometimes this game seems as bad as csgo.
---

Do you guys think paddles are an unfair advantage? I use my right paddle for prone/crouch and my left paddle normally for "x" functions like reloading, but normally just to reinforce/pick up took plates, etc. while doing something else for a second.
---
They‚Äôre making them so that they open up walls easier which in turn is causing them to also be better when it comes to killing as well lmao
---
Not realistic broke my immersionüòï

Yea or turn it off when you wanted too. No buff in op's speed. No new primary (as much as I would like one). Jackal can use his forever if he wanted too...finka can heal her whole team while spraying and praying with her lmg. Warden can use his ability for a short time and has to let it fully recharge before can activate again. Seems at as disadvantage compared to other functionality with other op's.

Is that a tested and confirmed change or an assumption?

The second TK kick was the old system.Led to a lot of problems,with honest players getting kicked from people walking in front of their bullets.Additionally,the toxic players would likely just TK until they got kicked anyway.This new way makes it that they can only get 1 TK max.

Certain operators are BETTER on certain maps. You have to learn what each operator does. Do the situations they‚Äôre really fun
---
I am sad to say, but Mira probably tops IQ in my book of R6 Cuties.
---
Definitely nice shot but where the flick
---
Paddles no but MnK is in my books cheating. Like paddles is fine because n ps4 there buttons re-mapping  that makes it easier to spam crouch or dropshot, but MnK theres just better aim control easier to to do anything really.

Ah shit fuck luck double truck

Main reasons why I lost:
---
- Enemy is Lag Switching.  
---
- Enemy is smurfing.  
---
- Enemy is exploiting.  
---
- Enemy is using KB/M.  
---
Reasons why I lost if that first list is obviously inaccurate:
---
- Enemy's class is bullshit.  
---
- Enemy's weapons are bullshit.  
---
- My teammates are terrible.  
---
Reasons I lost if I can't blame anyone else for my failing in any way at all:
---
- I had a lag spike.  
---
- Something is off about my controller.  
---
IMPOSSIBLY IMPOSSIBLE NON-REASONS I LOST TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME ELO AS ME:
---
-I got outplayed.
---
All you have to do is reinforce those 2 walls and place the first Mira on the right then place the second mira as close as you can to the one on the right on the left wall. Then you bust out the left Mira and you‚Äôve got it
---
BANDIT NO
---
or just use a mouse and keyboard yourself. Dont get mad that not everybody wants to handicap themselves. Its like complaining about using a controller on rocket leauge. Just get good.
---
Bitchin and moaning
---
console has significantly more people than pc lmao, they care alot more about console than they do pc, you guys generate minimum revenue compared to console players
---
If you're gonna play with KB/M on console, just fuckin migrate to PC. That's cheap as hell.

I played siege on ps4 for 3 years and i was so use to it

I think this is to hard to implement, as there are way too many games going on at once. So it's very difficult to implement. Good idea, but needs a little work.

I use controller on PS4 and I've actually met someone on my time with a k&amp;m and we vote kicked him

Or C) you start saving money and buy one yourself. Stop complaining that you can't afford one, just start saving money. It's not that hard buddy.
---
I've had the same question. I always notice gold 3 and above are so toxic and they seemingly sweat in casual of all modes. Why? What do you gain from it? I enjoy this game so much but this part of the community just ruins it for me.
---
You talked about someone using a controller on PC because they‚Äôre comfortable with it, then compared this to someone using MnK on console. This is inherently flawed because generally, if you spend an equal amount of hours on each, and you played yourself (you with MnK vs you with controller), you will win. MnK is easier to get good at, and rather than with controllers where your speed of head movement is limited by sensitivity, it is not limited on MnK. MnK has clear advantages to controllers.

Hello Thicc_Valkyrie, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cx6lap/best_casual_game_ever_ty_guys/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
THANK YOU!
---
Thought so.
---
I could hear the sound when he stepped on it
---
I never understood why they added this feature. It‚Äôs like using a controller on IOS/Android games...
---
in a game as competitive as r6, trust me there are some cocky fuckers once you hit plat2+, oh god some of the shit ive witnessed, and usually they all on mouse and keyboard. the 3rd reason that people use it is simply to level the playing field in high ranks
---
No they just get mad when it puts them at a disadvantage when it shouldn‚Äôt be happening in the first place
---
How about no.
---
 
---
I watched varsitygaming and it helped me quite a bit but just play with friends, it‚Äôs how I mainly did it and I love the game
---
Why are you using a hard drive with Siege? They load up the game so fast, it's hard to go back.
---
Y'all weaklings I play motion sensor
---
yeah i was the same when i first got siege on pc, but if you learn pc controls it really pays off.
---
There may not be, but two things still stand
---
1. Aces are universally counted as the time of the first kill to the time of the last kill.
---
2. Due to the nature of nitro cell aces having absolutely no time in between, and also due to the complete absence of it happening in any game where teams are playing properly, they don't count towards world records in any way
---
Would look cool without the 6

\&gt; and i added my opinion..

So did they.

If its officially condemned, why haven't they taken any steps to stop it? How comes NO GAME has taken any steps to stop it, and Fortnite(the only game that's tried) isnt trying to crack down on it anymore? They started banning kbm users around February, but there hasn't been any news of it since, so how comes?
---
Simple, because Sony chooses to allow it, they know about the emulators, they literally sell one, but this "massive issue" in the gaming world has seen no news and no solutions.
---
We kill the Vigil
---
I disagree. Some people just cannot play FPS games with a controller. It's unintuitive. I play on PC but this post makes me just want to go reinstall the game on my ps4 and KBM.
---
I am losing motivation to play the game not because I can't reach a rank I'm losing it because ddosers, it happens in my main account even in my gold account. In diamond is ridiculous how many people ddos, 8 out of 10 is against ddosers. If they don't do something the game will be unplayable.
---
Bad logic though when other people in the lobby are using mouse and keyboard.
---
For sure. I think that it could be implemented like team kill. Similar to how you would be banned by killing two teammates, killing 5 enemies in the first few seconds would get you banned as well, and then after review they would get permabanned
---
If you could afford a console, you could've bought a med tier PC for that same money that has no issues running games like Siege on even medium settings.
---
IP bans are useless considering how easy it is to change your IP on demand and the potential to impact innocent users playing on the same IP.
---
their opinion was that my opinion was pointless... my response to that was if its pointless you can keep scrolling. sure in many cases it is meaningless, but not in this case
---
So buying a console is handicapping yourself? And the only way to be.. Un-handicaped is to buy a m/kb?
---
That's some dumb logic buddy.

You must be new ubi doesnt listen to the fans are you crazy

Bro you are straight up fucking stupid. It's cheating because you can't just plug and play. You have to buy a adapter with a program that allows you to "cheat". GameCube controllers are plug and play or wireless. It's also against Microsoft terms of service. Most generic M&amp;KB are cheaper than controllers. Sorry your facts are just wrong
---
who tf puts loob on their controller?

I can feel that when I started it was fun I got one of my friends to join after op health and he has noticed that as well and he isn't the beat either

so you can finally feel like you're good at a game that you suck ass at? lmfao

Ah

I‚Äôm play 1 on console and switching to MnK because 90% of the enemy are using them

Amazing work! Keep it up

Are you trying to say why am I not using an SSD? HDD is interchangeable for storage.

So you play with a steering wheel? Let them play what they want. Everybody wants to play as easy as possible.

It‚Äôs beyond me why they‚Äôve waited or even why they haven‚Äôt said anything about this.

RIP my karma, and I don't even play on console - but it's still an even playing field. EVERYONE has the ability to play with M&amp;K. Just because you choose not to does not mean you can be mad at someone who does.
---
There are thousands of different factors that make people better or worse than others... This is but one different factor.
---
Honestly being in gold/plat it‚Äôs the same way for me. Some days I just want to get in casual and mess around with my friends with stupid strats or just play and chat. The only fix I‚Äôve found for getting into games that aren‚Äôt super toxic or tryhardish was to make a second account to just play in casual. My main account only gets played in the beginning of the season to get ranked then I play on my second account for fun. 
---
TL;DR it‚Äôs always gonna be a toxic environment just play on an unranked second account.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt quite understand
---
Stop complaining if u wanna play with a rank cap go play ranked.
---
Could always do the hk416 when I get that  ü§î
---
Dude is amazing great work!
---
Confession; I did this in Battlefield BC/3. Why?  
---
Because vehicles, especially helicopters and jets, *suck ass on a M+KB*. I stopped in BF4 because I stopped trying to fly by then because it wasn't as fun anymore, but my god in in BC/BF3 I got so much hate because my flying was so much better than other people's.  
---
The best part? I still kicked ass as infantry too most of the time.  
---
I still use a controller on PC from time to time, but almost exclusively for games like Skyrim, Witcher 3, fighting games etc. that play better/have better optimization for a controller than M+KB.
---
Haha this dum dum i meant THE BLOOD OF PEOPLE THAT DONT HEAL ME WITH DOC

I love the irony of

---
&gt;Use your controller on console and get good son.  
---
Maybe the guy's pc cant run r6 good and he understands that its much easier and better to aim with a mouse. Like I like playing certain games on console but when it comes to aiming im just begging for a mouse.
---
Shout out to all the guys down voting me for being right. Them one time cosmetics locked into a battle pass will have textures and geometry taking up space on everyone‚Äôs consoles/PCs for the rest of this games liff
---
As much as MnK is an issue on console we need to get lag switching and ddosing servers dealt with first. MnK gives you an advantage yes but its you can win games even if the other team is using it. Its borderline impossible to win against teams with booters and lag switches and feels like a waste of time if you get up and they hit servers
---
So if someone wanted to spawn peek in main entrance in bank . It's a 1 second spawn peek so it will wrongly ban people

Just wanna let you know, .308 is not "Americanized", 7.62x51 nato IS the .308 developed by Winchester, on which the 7.62 is based on. same thing with the 5.56, its based on the Remington .223
---
I was in the same spot has you, plat on the ps4 and not even brave enough to go ranked on pc, but just play with mnk, you may suffer a bit while you are getting used to it, but after about a week you will love mnk alot more, and the longer you play with mnk the closer you get to your controller skill level on console
---
But if they can use kb&amp;m why wouldnt they its the superior input device for all first person shooters. I understand the frustration and of course the fact people use it to "boost" their skill can seem sad but if its allowed whats the problem. If consoles are allowing it then it just seems like people who still play with a controller are holding themselves back.
---
Why are you talking like a caveman?
---
if that were the case the is issue would have been fixed years ago. yet here you poor schlubs are. Making hourly posts of keyboard users cause Ubi doesn't care.
---
as a new player i really like this
---
No, it certainly takes some skill. No one can truthfully deny that. But BR games also have a pretty high luck element involved in them too, much higher than other competitive games typically have.
---
Yeah to be fair that makes sense I have nothing against that even I do have an unranked smurf who is 50 but still against plat
---
if you can use keyboard on console go for it
---
Am clash main. We not very smart
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs Mozzie

I played with a regular controller back during the beta and release (2015) and switched to M&amp;K during the Wind Bastion operation (January 2019). I've never hit diamond with either controller or M&amp;K. It's not *that* advantageous where it makes you a god. I'm still the same high plat 3-plat 2 player, except I can respond to things more accurately. I've never crouch or lean spammed and I have lost plenty to M&amp;K players who abuse it. I've also lost plenty to people who DoS lobbies. It's easy to beat M&amp;K players on console but it's also easy to complain about things outside of my control.

---
If that is the case then why did the team that did this to my team lose the first round and then push the second round, pulled a quick plant and then started lagging the whole server as the timer counted down to 0. I have the video of it still. I have multiple clips from that game. When it was time for us to go on offense we immediately lagged so much we couldn't move out of spawn. The timer kept ticking and they won their necessary defense rounds to win the match. People are doing this intentionally. Don't trick yourself into thinking its not malicious. It most certainly is.

I use a switch pro controller with stick drift covered in vaseiline on PC not for the challenge just cuz
---
I mean... that's the whole point of this post. People are using m/kb against controller players because they can't compete with controllers. It then ruins the experience for people playing on consoles because they prefer the controller couch experience, for example.
---
How could people downvote this? This is adorable!
---
That's a no from me chief
---
I do when I run the primary shotgun, so I have something to use on range.
---
This is my view but I got downvoted for suggesting it was kind of r/gatekeeping-ish to say people shouldn't use M+KB on consoles.
---
But I come from competitive scenes where the controller you use isn't that big of a deal and the scene just evolves accordingly. E.g. fighting games with keyboards and hitbox controllers instead of traditional arcade sticks and console controllers.

Plats only want you to boost off of you... hate to he the bearer of bad news dude. Just play solo and get better at the game yourself. My best advice is to not play with the squad you've been in. They're using you to off-balance the matchmaking system. Not a cool move, and definitely not very impressive on your part.
---
The only map he‚Äôs still good on is plane and maybe chalet
---
It won't be (as far as i have been aware)... they gave the opperators some price reductions instead of making a bundle.
---
Oh yeah that shits funny
---
Would definitely say it's unfair and shouldn't be used but isn't necessarily saying you are bad but that you aren't good with using a controller
---
Lmfaoo now you saying you just bored...
---
It basically completely negates recoil and gives you some extreme precision you can't really acquire with joysticks. I used it a couple times, but honestly hated it because it made everything feel like a laser. I actually like having recoil to control because it makes a gunfight feel more like a gunfight instead of a point and click, but hey... To each their own I guess. I like the realism over the element of winning, tbh.
---
As long as I have a decent KD in a match, I could give a shit if we win or lose. I like stick competition.

I‚Äôve only ever played on PC but holy shit, if I knew I could play a console shooter with mouse and keyboard, I‚Äôd choose that option 10/10 times. Like a cheap keyboard and mouse is like 20 bucks... less than a 60 dollar controller and way better for FPS games. I‚Äôll be downvoted but this is super sad / cringey.

Why not just let us choose what maps we want by having different map lists to choose from like CS:GO? Have all the ranked maps in one bundle, then the bad but fun maps like house, yacht, plane and favela in another. So if someone is just grinding to 35 and play ranked, they can just play the ranked map pool, but for us who know all the maps already and just wanna chill and mess around in casual on some unbalanced maps, we can.

Not really hate keeping so much as it is people not wanting others to have an unfair advantage over other players in a competitive game. You can use whatever peripheral you want but you should only be matched up with other players with that peripheral. And if you‚Äôre AGAINST that, then it just proves that you want to stomp people that are at a disadvantage to you

---
Yee i took some suggestions and tnx

m + keyboard is like 20 dolars
---
My favorite part is the capitao has no legs
---
I‚Äôd agree except the developers disable keyboard and mouse natively and they only get around it by using third party software that makes the console read it as a controller. It‚Äôs the equivalent to cheating and the devs have even said it. But keep trying to defend it lol

Hello YaBoyGayBoi, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cx8kn8/nice_game_ubisoft_cant_play_the_game_without_this/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You just said its an better in every way so don't even. It's cheating when really they arnt good in my eyes as they are not playing on a fair playing field.
---
Yeah remember when I got my first XD
---
This has to be a joke pasta, right
---
RIGHT!?
---
Good question. I shall not sleep until I have the culprit!
---
Chinese welcome mat i think ... not working properly
---
They're  both equally bad.
---
That doesn‚Äôt do anything. People using MnK on console now, only use it to be at an advantage against people using a control.
---
Let‚Äôs say you enable it so it‚Äôs MnK vs MnK players on console only, the people already using adapters are just gonna keep using adapters to get queued with controller players.
---
And if you don‚Äôt do anything from a matchmaking perspective, and just allow MnK, you‚Äôre basically telling controller players ‚ÄúAlright there‚Äôs nothing we could do so if you want to be on an even playing field you gotta get your own MnK. Also those players that were cheating before? Not considered cheating anymore. In fact they don‚Äôt even need their adapter anymore.‚Äù
---
&gt;Are you dense? Of course it DOESN'T HAVE TO BE an insult,
---
For someone who is so against insults being typed in a game you're pretty quick to jump to them when someone doesn't like what you say. 
---
Maybe don't get triggered so easily in the future and you'll actually have a chance at discussion.
---
people are saying that but it doesnt play like The Division at all. Stealth doesn't work in Div.
---
You just defused to late i guess
---
When they message you
---
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if we lose we‚Äôre lagging the game out anyway‚Äù
---
The problem with that map (for me at least) is that it's literally impossible to win on defense UNLESS you play super hyper mega agressive and spawnpeek.
---
Although when I‚Äôm on YouTube and in here and watch the pc guys play I feel like such a bot Hahahaha
---
What about when I want to help my friends climb? There is nothing you or anyone else can do to stop people from smurfing. It‚Äôs just part of competitive games. An unavoidable thing that is in plenty of other games. LoL (10x worse than this games smurfing ‚Äúproblem‚Äù) OW, CS, etc.

They  was supposed to be nerf him a few months ago but they lied
---
Good luck!
---
Mnk on console is cheating plain and simple. This may be an ‚Äúunpopular opinion‚Äù but it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs going to get you hate from the vast majority of players, and rightfully so.
---
Honestly, why? The only challenging part of TH that actually made it fun were the bombers. There should just be an option to disable them rather than remove them completely.
---
Then bitch at the companies that have allowed mouse and keyboard to work on systems. You don't like it? tough. Get over it. It's not unfair if everyone can do it. If you don't like it. Why don't you get a mouse and keyboard and get gud?
---
They're talking about mouse and keyboard on console, where everyone is using a controller
---
real gamers use keyboard and controller
---
I don‚Äôt think the characters age anymore, months  ago their birth years got removed from their bios and replaced with their release date ages.
---
Yes, team games work better when playing with a team
---
I really couldn‚Äôt care I sort of prefer controller when I‚Äôm playing siege I use it on my computer to get a higher rank
---
No idea ubisoft wont unban you. I doubt it because of that account history idk
---
server latency
---
Amen
---
The "right." sounded sarcastic to me so I thought I'll prove I didn't lie lol. 
---
Anywho, yeah I get all that, but advantage in that sense is relative to me. What I mean is, does someone who uses MnK has advantage over someone with a better attack/defense plan? R6 win appt of times depends on positioning, surveilance and predictions. So to me MnK isn't that great of advantage overall. As far as "flicks" go, I've seen people using controllers with higher sensitivity than I got and better precision. To me it basically depends on a person playing. That's just my opinion obviously, as this whole thread thinks differently lol.
---
Because the devs actively tel is that mouse and keyboard is cheating hence why it is natively DISABLED, the only way people get around that is by buying third party software that makes the console read the keyboard and mouse as a controller. It‚Äôs equivalent to cheating according to the devs
---
They used to have challenges to unlock everything, but they scrapped that. So now everything is unlocked with the operator.

Or you're just better with mouse and keyboard? There's plenty of people that are far better on controller and both have their benefits and downfalls

Using a keyboard on a device that isn't suppose to be used on, is breaking TOS. Ubisoft could prosecute these companies that make this third party equipment that Hack the system...also Microsoft and Sony as well. Once there is a lawsuit these companies will stop this BS. Then these suck ass kids will be out there money.

Player who's gonna use controller on console anyways - *This sign can't stop me because I can't read!*
---
It doesn't make you worse, if a controller player is smarter, has better map knowledge, and is better at the game. Then you shouldn't have an issue. These posts are made by salty silver players who are not good at the game regardless.

A true Golden Experience.
---
Im afraid the report for toxic behavior does nothing.
---
It's when players of higher skill or experience intentionally get a lower rank so they can carry their friends to a higher rank. Ever see a team of bronze or silver players where one person gets 10+ kills but the rest of the team seem braindead? Then when the match is over the top player has the lowest rank and the rest are high gold or platinum? That's boosting. Some people are actually pathetic enough to pay money for it.
---
I agree with this on some level but changing your playing style from mouse and keyboard to controller really kind of requires your brain to play good on controller and not mouse and keyboard. I can see why people would want to use mouse and keyboard on console so they don't get rusty at it but in the same breath it's kind of douche to play mouse and keyboard on console even if you want to just play with your friends.
---
They did more than "plug in a mnk" they bought a spoofer that they also plug into the console so it emulates the controller while being a mnk. Siege does not have mnk native support.
---
You can't play Siege if you only have a mouse and keyboard.
---
It's cheating: plain and simple.
---
Doesn't matter what your "justifications" are, it's against the rules.
---
It‚Äôs not a big deal
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY LION

Yea it's stupid I'm might email epi

I didnt make it I just shared the picture

If the game supports a mouse and keyboard on a console, and you choose not to use them and get pwnd by people who do choose to use them, that's on you. 
---
GG
---
What if they added a Defending op that has a gadget that would explode themselves
---
&gt; Honest question, and if the answer is that people are actually overriding the game design than my position is inherently wrong and apologies for that.
---
They‚Äôre doing just that. You buy an adapter that binds the controller inputs to the keyboard so the game thinks it‚Äôs a game pad. Game doesn‚Äôt support mouse and keyboard.
---
Make it so he can move while his ability is up.
---
That's it, that's all he needs.
---
Are you on fucking crack mouse and keyboard is fucking blatant cheating on console you argument of  fucking oclosing the gap is irrelevant as if you wanna play mnk go to pc. It is cheating consoles come with a controller which means there meant to be used with one. Ubisoft even declares this as cheating you fucking spaz.
---
Recoil patterns need to be different for consoles and PC
---
It's an unfair advantage and a scummy thing to do

Operator's drone with their respective gadget

Monty drone: bullet resistant and can destroy drones by hopping on them Mario style

---
B-b-but the team is only 5 players and I‚Äôm one of them...! That‚Äôs... imp... actually, totally correct.
---
You still gotta buy the adapter($100+) that tricks the console into thinking your MnK is a controller. Honestly there should just be native MnK support. Right now it's still cheating
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/fqmousdrew](https://www.twitch.tv/fqmousdrew) just go into last 24 hours for clips
---
This sort of argument doesn‚Äôt work.
---
In competitive environments, people tend to not care what makes them good or bad, as long as what they‚Äôre doing works, and most importantly, wins. Do you think CSGO players snorting adderall or NFL players taking steroids care if it ‚Äúmeans they‚Äôre not as good as others ‚Äú if they win? No. 
---
Do people who buy cheats, abuse matchmaking, exploits, mouse/keyboard on consoles, op-operator-this-patch mains ect ect *care* if it ‚Äòmeans‚Äô they‚Äôre ‚Äòworse‚Äô at the game in anyone‚Äôs eyes? No.
---
Depends on the elo. New players will literally just ban whoever they don't like going up against.
---
Wait you can use keyboard and mouse on a console now? Yea that's unfair.
---
Waaw *starts playing controller after playing mouse and keyboard all his life*
---
Getting a MnK isn't getting good lmao
---
Do people actually think this way?  Why not just plug in a racing wheel and sewing pedals that control your character?  Why would you willingly choose to use inferior controls?
---
If there was a better control method on PC, it would be used.
---
First it was cinematic FPS, now it's you have to use your thumb to move your viewpoint rather than your wrist?  What?
---
I doubt it. I‚Äôve had a few of my friends who play on high sens get messages all the time accusing them of MnK.  I‚Äôm not saying MnK doesn‚Äôt exist, but much like PC players calling lucky wallbangs or getting out played ‚Äúhacking‚Äù us console players fall into the same trap and think every better player is cheating and using MnK.  Even the wild head shakes in the kill cam is possible with high sens. Hell most people using MnK will be running lower sens so they can benefit from more precise aim.
---
I use a Wii remote on pc to assert dominance.
---
Fine by me. Maybe I'll get through to someone. 
---
"Cheating" implies breaking the rules. Are there rules against using a mouse and keyboard? Seems like an easy thing for the devs to exclude if there are rules against that sort of thing, to say nothing of banning people who use them. 
---
I'll say it again, you're playing against people who are willing to invest more into their hobby. Try going to a paintball field and getting upset that someone there bought their own gear. Or a bowling alley and complaining someone has their own bowling balls. 
---
It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's true: the people with the mouse and keyboard are doing nothing wrong.
---
In ninja words ‚Äú your Trash‚ÄùüòÇ

---
Everyone says it's not AT ALL but it's a lot easier to wallbounce and hit your shots. I play PC Gears most days and it's not as fun when you get into lobbies of mostly controller. I'd give it a step above using a Scuf.
---
Everyone also has the capability to hack their games too. Would you be okay with that? And the companies literally can‚Äôt do anything more than they already have. They‚Äôve disabled it as a peripheral natively and even if they try to patch a specific mod then it just gets updated and they‚Äôd be in a never ending losing battle. Why can‚Äôt people follow the rules imposed by the devs and not cheat? If you want to play against controller players as a kb&amp;m player you‚Äôre literally just admitting that you‚Äôre trash and need that advantage to even win. And for the record I did git good and bought a PC so I don‚Äôt have to deal with retards that think they‚Äôre good at the game on console cause they cheat. Grow up loser
---
I disagree, you also have the option to use mouse and keyboard. Just because you dont do it, dont take it out on someone that does.
---
Depends on how big the luck factor is though;  
---
If I play 10 games, and 7 times out of 10 I land I somehow wind up in an area with only P220s/RE-45s/Mozambiques, not much I can do there for instance other than pray and hide.
---
I now wanna see IQ lay someone out in a gym.
---
His bullets are literally the most destructive bullets in the game. People underwrite tachanka so damn hard. I Main tachanka in plat 2 on pc and while he isnt good on some sites, he is actually ridicilous on others. I could write an extensive guide for this if there is any interest. He isnt Even a bad operator. If he got acog and his face shield on his turret is buffed so that the whole thing doesnt get destroyed by getting hit on the edges, rather destroy the part of the Window he hits he Would be really viable
---
Slow down it‚Äôs a casual lmao
---
There are rules against it moron, mnk is disabled on console. People use EMULATORS to bypass it. Instead of talking about something you know nothing about, do a little research.
---
Just like hackers are a PC problem. Glad we don't deal with that.

I would use mouse and keyboard if I went against other people in mouse and keyboard

Contact their support. A year ago i went on vacation for a week.  Came back and I started a match and like 2 seconds in I got kicked and it said I got banned for cheating.  Was super confused so I called their support number and they had me make a ban appeal ticket.  Apparently some guy logged into my account from Japan lol.  Not sure if they do it anymore but they said they unban once and then if it happens again they won‚Äôt do anything.
---
Tldr  make a ban appeal or call their support.

The fucking arrogance of some people man, how do they get so stupid? I‚Äôm actually jealous, ignorance is bliss.

I see, that‚Äôs fucking hilarious

thanks guys i¬¥ll save my lunch money */s* for the 40$ bundle

Ok mongoloid.

Thanks man, hey can u explain the trajectory of the twitch drone taser?? I see that‚Äôs ur main and it doesn‚Äôt make sense when I miss
---
Console controllers are what 40-50$? I can buy a keyboard mouse bundle for 15$ it‚Äôs not about money or not wanting to invest in a hobby.
---
People are paying for 3rd party hardware/software to bypass restrictions and limitations set by the developers in the game.  This is cheating.
---
Pro tip: play on pc
---
Slightly above average.
---
You understand we‚Äôre arguing the same point correct?
---
I like lion ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

LOL This logic is hilarious. Everyone is telling MnK Console players to get a controller to git gud. This same argument can be used on you to get a MnK and learn how to level the playing field. Your beef is with companies allowing MnK in the first place. 
---
This would be like PC players bitching about controllers being an unfair advantage on their platform. Everyone would be telling them to get a controller and get good.

Yes it does

If your friends can't climb on their own maybe they shouldn't be playing ranked. Maybe they should focus more on actually learning to play the game better instead of just what their rank is. Because when you're not there to carry them they're just going to get crushed by the people who earned those ranks legitimately.
---
&gt; points for win
---
&gt; points for surviving
---
&gt; points for kills
---
&gt; rewards for win
---
Yep the point is losing for sure.
---
Actually, yes. I hate when people do this. It‚Äôs one thing if you‚Äôre dicking around in single player, or in a closed (private) lobby with friends. But this is the same as using aimbot/mods for me: get over yourself and play the fucking game. Please.
---
Dude, it's gotten so bad now. And it was absolutely rampant in the call of duty alpha. Deal with keyboard and mouse low lifes on console or hackers on PC. Damned if we do damned if we dont.
---
Got plat 1 in 1 season long time ago. Now can't get higher than plat 3
---
Op, this is some seriously good shit
---
Bloody brilliant
---
Lets get this straight. You are arguing that a platform that is A:Cheaper B:Better preforming C:Free Online access D:multifunctional E:open source is some how worst because you can avoid the tiniest of chace with some scrip kiddie? If this isnt mental gymnastics I dont know what is.
---
I will give you that it is harder, not impossible, to hack console. Good job, you earned a point, but PC still beats your console 10 fold.
---
Over 1300 hours on Siege PC most of it ranked, I havent ment a hacker yet, this is low plat high gold level.
---
https://www.mpgh.net/forum/233-console-game-hacking/
---
Not impossible, just very hard
---
It's not allowed. They have to buy a third party adapter for their PS4 to disguise it as a controller. The only game that I know that  allows kb&amp;m is fortnite.
---
hibana so hot
---
Explain please, how you can roam smarter with jackal on enemy team? Btw Kaid ban is useless. Thermite can simply put his charge on the floor or wall neighboring hatch and it will open. Thwre is also Maverick who can open hatch in 10 sec max.
---
And people are still saying that the rank disparity lock is a bad thing.
---
I should have worded it differently...why go through such lengths to be good at a game if you aren‚Äôt being paid for it? Meaning, why buy a XIM and go through the hassle of setting it up and dealing with any issues that may arise and then deal with all the other problems that might occur, like a ban, when you could just try and get better naturally?
---
Sorry for not wording it better. Been a long day.
---
By your logic , athletes getting doped up to perform better is fine and people should blame their sources. All the other athletes should get doped up as well to Git Gud. If you want to use MnK,get a damn PC
---
Have you got down syndrome of you want to play mnk get a fooking pc. If you want to "invest into your hobby" Ubisoft have said countless times mnk in console is cheating and the only reason people dont get banned is it's impossible to detect
---
I mean the dbno is nice but agreed
---
I don‚Äôt have the exact message/tweet,but Ubisoft has stated that KMB on console is cheating.
---
And your argument is shit btw.
---
It was bandit and his pranks again... but I have the Acog. Thats all that matters
---
I wasn‚Äôt hating on your post lol
---
im glad thinking of it but the scary parts of them looking back where really fun
---
I‚Äôve never understood why people wanna be so good at a game if they will never try to go pro. I really suck at the game and try to get better but I think I‚Äôm too old and my skill is decreasing by the second. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that there should be no reason to go through the lengths to connect a MnK to a console just to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù unfairly. Logically, it‚Äôs costly and not needed. 
---
Side note: if anyone wants to see my atrocious stats, let me know.

Nobody will miss this fucko

You put the crosshairs on something and it goes in a straight line to about 8 meters, only reaching normal ceiling camera height. So think of it like this. Is the gadget within the dimensions of a normal size room. If yes point and shoot. If no don‚Äôt waste a charge
---
And I OOP

Funnily enough, when I'm one-shotting drones my game sucks. But if I'm chasing the fucker up and down the room like Frost here, I'm guaranteed a couple of kills that round.

Good ammo for the next time some sperg tries to tell me controller is just as good.

Note to self: I'm the most fucking retarded person alive please end me.

II‚Äôd say roughly 30-35% of my games have been ddosed on PS. It‚Äôs been Since the start too, lost 6 placements to it.
---
Yea, legitimate reason to be upset when you are trying to rank up but some diamond douche smurfs and pushes you back into silver because they "dont wanna try". The whole point of slowly rank up is to slowly introduce you into higher skill tiers, a bronze will see what a diamond smurf is doing but not know how they did it and even if they could do it they don't know the finer details of when to do it or best way to do it or what to do after.
---
lol very funny
---
This argument doesn't work because 95% of people in diamond on console use K&amp;M :(
---
Happy cake day lion main
---
You realize no one likes elitist douches like you right? I wasnt even arguing about being able to hack a console, I wasnt saying a console is better than your almighty pc. I was saying there isnt hackers on siege on console, which there isnt. You cant give me any proof. Find a single video of a hacker on console then talk to me, otherwise I'm done arguing with people who dont know what their talking about.
---
Ok but what about Wii fit game pad users? You talk about mouse and keyboard players as if they‚Äôre top tier when these fuckers are untouchable.
---
Damn that sucks. I‚Äôve only played like 35 games of ranked so far this season and haven‚Äôt seen it once
---
since when the hell can you use keyboard and mouse on console?

the f around place is TH if you ask me.

yeah I do and thank u!
