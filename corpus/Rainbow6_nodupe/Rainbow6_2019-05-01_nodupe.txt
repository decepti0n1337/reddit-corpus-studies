RainbowTale: True Pacifist mode

---
---
No
---

---
Killcams should be removed completely.
---
I just use the nitros as additional Target practice now. I try to tap then all as fast as possible. I don't mind them as much as the room of barbed wire.
---
High ranking players should be good at the game, so really they wouldn't be affected that much. And yeah i see your point, but that already happens normally which is fine, It's just when a low and high rank are queueing together is the main problem.
---
Kinda, not so much stutters as tearing. It happened here and there the past two-three seasons for me, but this season is far more pronounced. It happens nearly every game now, compared to maybe one occurrence in a *match* every three+ days.
---
I've kept everything from my BIOS to graphics and audio drivers updated. The mark is clearly with the new season, however.
---
Bruh that‚Äôs kindof a dick move ngl.
---
Cool strat but I don‚Äôt have 3 mins of prep phase
---
You mean on top of reinforced hatches?
---
Just saying
---
Ranked should not have killcams at all.
---
Eh, too much effort
---
Do you not understand how a player is downed in the game? A player is downed after taking 100 damage where the final shit is not landed on the head, the player is not rappelling or the total damage does not exceed 120 hp after compensating for armorAlso glaz is far from the only op to have a weapon  that does over 50. Twitch and lions 417 does 69 damage per shot, bucks dmr also does 69, blackbeards SR-25 does 61, the lfp586 does 78 which is actually more than glaz‚Äôs rifle. Need i name more or is that sufficient?
---
Makes me weirdly anxious
---
/r/&lt;woosh&gt;
---
I had a team start the vote kick in a 1v4, last guy keeps saying he's going to wait to vote until I die, I proceeded to clutch it. Next round starts I take cav, down them all, say fuck you I leave on my terms. 
---
I fight toxic with toxic, sue me.
---
Fucking incredible.
---
if that‚Äôs true, what a player lmao
---
He's just "flirting" with her, if that's the word
---
Where did you get this lie, or did you pull this out of your ass?
---
Yes but you still dont see my point. It would effect high level play too. If you get shot and dont know where from. When you die you get a free callout despite not knowing that information. The feature would have to be rank locked for it to work the way op intends it to
---
Lesion on attack would be good
---
Yeah feel free go ahead! &lt;3 If you are to credit any social media it would be best to do my youtube channel at:  [https://www.youtube.com/user/MrDjzelda](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrDjzelda)

Has been mentioned decades before and O also made a repost: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/7b06tk/defender_idea_ladders_not_boring/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Personally I would make it a telescopic tactical ladder, just type it into google images.
---
I use the 5.7 on most of the ops who can use it. It is way better to have all those extra bullets when you need them. Even if it deals less damage per hit.
---
That is DEFENDER ladders. Mines attack GG
---
"I showed you my MP5, please respond"
---
The skeleton key has the biggest spread decrease when ADS so that plays a big factor. Hip fire and it's on of the weakest, ADS and it's solid.
---
Dude. First of all you were talking about getting shot in the head and getting 1 shot killed when I said getting DOWNED, not dying, I know the damage threshold to go down you jackass. Second, I said that Glaz was the only Operator that has a 50+ DMG weapon that has been involved in me getting 1-2 shot down. Again man, actually READ before you reply. Cause right now, you're looking dumber by the second.
---
God, the way you flick your mouse around adsing random shit, and lean spamming is so annoying. Stop acting like you are some kind of pro, you aren‚Äôt so stop.
---
Really made me laugh. 
---
BTW would it be ok to use this clip for best of the week clips,  for new YT Channel. I will credit any social media you wish. I ll greatly appreciate it, Cheers!
---
Yep... exactly what I was thinking the entire clip, it was obnoxious.
---
gg
---
Okay.. Lets say this way wouldn't work.. There are still at least a dozen ways to get this to stop, but ubi hasn't implemented anything in the slightest... Im sure there is a better way but this was the first one off the top of me head.
---
lol now fuze can fuze the hostage, himself, and the enemies
---
I've done this with all the original maps, cept Bartlett U, cause the game freaked out and crashed. I should upload the videos one day. Was all about Buck and the Skeleton Key for me, blasting everything breakable. I was using the old Drone glitch, to distract the last 1 or 2 guys outside the structures on THunt Classic.
---
I like it, the eye seems a bit distant on the left side though
---
Or maybe only aimbot
---
i immediately knew it was the huge boobs one lol
---
I was using it as an example, stuff more like bandit batteries and stuff would be better in game
---
Run into the room and run back out. They all blow up behind you. Look like a badass and get rid of the nitros. Two birds one stone.
---
They were wrong....
---
but how are mute jammers going to useful for attackers
---
YUP! Unless you're using Thatcher, then nothing. haha
---
I dont see how that's aimbot. He aimed at head height and hit you in the head. Pretty simple
---
Disable all electronics in my vicinity while playing wallball.
---
Iron man captain America black widow die
---
lmao you are good, i always say shit and it gets checked. Ive never been banned
---
If they hack mute they might be able to disable bandit batteries and stuff around if
---
I'm surprised I didn't lol
---
And technically if they hack a mat it could just make it active on the defenders
---
I usually do rock the compensators but if the enemy team isn‚Äôt actively communicating it‚Äôs easier to take a stealthy approach.
---
i think it could have been a complete fluke
---
And never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line!
---
I have been saying this for soooo long
---
Ay yo her left eye's fucked up my dude, other than that looks great.
---
I guess that does make sense I personally still wouldn‚Äôt run suppressor but if it works for you go for it.
---
This is glorious, thank you
---
But house is the most fun map in the game. It's the worst competitive map, but it's pretty fun.
---
God damn nerds. I'm gonna go stuff some in a locker.
---
 I am on console lol
---
How did you do it?
---
I did that on villa, and put my camera watching it. 1st was the diffuser, then his only surviving teammate. Mwahaha
---
If Pulse is holding a camera and pinging, it means theres a bad guy right frigging there.

i showed you my C4, please respond

So what happened to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like it, move on‚Äù?
---
I'm waiting for Halo MMC PC. I also feel you with seige, it still gets my heart pumping no lie, but it's not as "care free" (In casual). I enjoy the competitive atmosphere, but it gets to a certain level where I wanna go recruit only, just to be vote kicked. 
---
Anyway, It's nice too see there are other people who see siege the way I do in terms of an FPS fix. Hopefully Halo PC might give me a good break from siege only to appreciate more later.
---
I thought he used his assault rifle and just shot the floor forever.
---
The V3 looks stupid just in general.
---
Always wanted to do it, never had the dedication. Thank you it‚Äôs majestic
---
are you on a smurf, because its not too much to celebrate about a black ice when you're early in the game, I've made 8 smurfs and 7 of them got atleast 1 black ice before level 10
---
imagine a dark souls boss but slightly more forgiving
---
that is every
---
single
---
encounter
---
it‚Äôs a great game, well worth it
---
Heres a genuine tip if you ever feel unsure try one on play a thunt then try the other and feel what feels better for you :) As all these stuff usually are subjective it is better to try it your way forward
---
Much love man üíñ
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
It‚Äôs higggghhhh nooooon
---
Ela did skip them leg days, and it shows
---
Sweet thanks
---
Some people laugh but this would be an incredibly game changing yet balanced operator idea.
---
Remember Mira?
---
Directly affects maps, not players.
---
Gadgets are better and more fun to use and play against when they don't directly affect the player (Ela mines, Echo), and instead change the map in a way that can be utilized by both teams while also providing a risk to the player using it (Mira).
---
The most famous of which is never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less famous is never throw out a damaging gadget in a lobby with complete idiots!!!!!
---
Thanks for not crying like others
---
Then report it [and watch it get enforced](https://i.imgur.com/73mTDJc.jpg).
---
The point is zofia is just an impact grenade in a launcher. Ash‚Äôs charge is specialized, it digs in then blows. Electricity blowing an impact grenade makes no sense, as it blows up on impact. You would have to make all bandited things destroy all grenades, and that destroys most of the meta regarding hard walls, getting rid of shields etc. Ash charges should be the only thing affected.
---
Yeah. I usually just leave and go knock the stuffing out of my punching bag
---
Yes
---
Monty Smoke planting in casual, they deserve that L.
---
In no way are these bundles "reskins". There has never been a bundle like this one before, and the closest skin we have to it is FRA Reaganomics which is visually similar but by no means a reskin. People constantly flip flop what they want, and Ubisoft will never be able to satisfy everyone's neediness. Personally, when I saw this bundle I was excited that Kaid and Nomad are getting a bundle. I will never understand the people who take a microscope to a new bundle like this. I remember when Siege would get a max of 5 bundles in a season, they are doing much better than previous seasons.
---
Dont roam as a three armor, or begin to roam late round, or if everyone else is roaming, dont roam too
---
Cant you just send that clip in to support and get them banned?
---
Lucky fuck. I have 4 smurfs and only 1 has black ice 3 are lvl 50 and above (the one with the black ice is 57?)
---
Ohhhhh yes... yes it is!!!
---
You could also do it yourself instead of complaining üòÇ
---
I play kaid with barb to stop rushes now, but I put the throwable out of view or in the other room so they just have to melee the barb wires.
---
Play on hereford base or outback
---
There is actually no problem with holding an angle for a whole round some pros do it if he gets a kill from it was quite successfull wasn't it?

He sucked a fat shell
---
There is no time limit on hostage
---
So people that "like seeing sexy/attractive people" 100% also like seeing Rainbow Six operators that don't look like their in-game counterparts?
---
Because apparently that's your claim. Feel free to clarify.
---
There's also a thing called trust, he trusted his teammates, and they betrayed that trust, and don't tell me "don't trust your teammates" cause that shouldn't be an issue
---
Imagine wasting a Mira for one kill and that it will likely happen once in your life time
---
but there's a limit it's not infinite
---
First point, umm she has a shotgun and carbine....Hmmm Cav has a shotgun and carbine. So no point disproven. And that also disproves point two. Also Jager has the same secondary gadgets as her so also no.
---
 Third point no shit unless you want to talk about ubi recycling operators from each side and putting them on the other. Point 4 no really? I never thought of that...
---
Hibana is fine where she is, her gadget is meant to do smaller things than Thermite no one's complaining about that. Also BB has the same pistol as Valkyrie, you know what else holds eight bullets? The m1911, you know what holds 6? All revolvers in the game. Ever hear of the PMM or Makarov? Holds eight in that sucker as well. Hear of the AutoMag .44? Holds eight as well!
---
Her Scorpion isn't overwhelming in any sense. It will barely ever hit you in the first place and even if you do it does a very pathetic damage. So it's really not anything to be scared of. And when everyone does something better than someone I think it does mean they need a buff, because that means they kind of suck in comparison which she does. Just because I know others do something better doesn't mean I also want to stop playing her, I like her smart ass. Stop thinking like a brick fucking wall and take opinions which you can't seem to do, just like getting your facts and points correct which you haven't.
---
What
---
sarcasm?
---
Oh, sorry, this game isn't for playing.
---
I've been really liking Ronin lately. People will target you so hard they forget about silly things like flags and enemy Titans
---
Looks good keep it up
---
Toxic... but the other way around?
---
Floors 20 hits
---
Tiles/ cinder blocks 5-10
---
Really? People got divisive over this? That's hardly tasteless imo.
---
You do in fact still get banned now
---
Just make it one of the volume sliders, and group it in with when you hear teammates yelling things about their gadgets.
---
Congrats! I only have one black ice skin - it's for Mute's MP5K
---
That‚Äôs the point, this is just a prank. The rest is true toxicity. I‚Äôve had this happen to me a few times with some friends and it was funny, if not a little annoying that I was banned. Doing it in ranked or kicking people for nothing like that is the true small dickery.
---
Lol please bitch and whine more
---
Get_Flanked and Varsity Gaming are both good YouTubers that can help teach you how to play the game. You could learn a lot from the both of them.
---
I don't think so, I don't remember what word did my friend once told me ingame that got him the same message. After that we were wondering what else could be banned so we said to each other random stuff and maybe we found out 3 banned words but after that we didn't get any restriction of any kind nor even a notification by the moderators.
---
Ohh you said remote I read it as remove. My bad. But the operator seems too niche to be played
---
What's this have to do with PC vs Console. I get what you're getting at but you didn't mention consoles once
---
Bullet penetration I guess? 
---
A sledgehammer is a makeshift wall slamming on you so it'll be an impact instead of a pierce. 
---
And in medieval times, piercing was better than sheer impact
---
Awesome thanks!

thanks! :)

The prevailing wisdom among business is new customer acquisition.
---
Have you noticed your ISP or telco rolling out new and cheaper plans that are only valid for new customers? Same thing applies - they assume that current customers will remain customers, and in fact should be exploited as much as possible to just before the point where they will switch suppliers.
---
TLDR: typical player will just have one copy of Siege and one set of his preferred microtransaction outfits. Smurfs have at least two copies of Siege and at least two sets of his preferred microtransaction outfits. Faced with the choice of serving fewer high value customers or more lower value customers, the choice is simple for beancounters.
---
While it will ultimately lead to the slow death of the company, see Games Workshop and their painted miniatures games, it does lead to soaring profit in the short term which is all the C-suite executives care about as it affects their pay.
---
That's a very good description of how I feel about the game although worded much more properly, there is this great feeling that once you know the maps and get a callout you immediately start plotting your next steps as to how to approach your enemy. And it feels even better when you can execute your plan and maybe get a freebie on the way
---
Umm.... thats pointing right back to him
---
Ubi game, that's all. The didn't realise that someone could use the hammer to break car's windows xD
---
Thermite charge the locked bathroom door because someone locked it as they were coming out
---
He's not as necessary right now with the meta being trap heavy for shield countering.

It isn't as bad as when a Kaid does it though because mute and bandits gadgets are meant for the same thing (reinforced walls) while Kaid's gadget is meant for hatches. When bandit does it he is semi-retarded, when a Kaid does it he's fully retarded.
---
Didn‚Äôt they discontinue the seasonal skins a while ago? Or can you still get them in alpha packs?
---
"If you are arguing the worseness of two words, and won't even say one of them, that's the worse word."

Is this the word of the lord?
---
This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
---
Yea same here. I cant really do FPS without a one shot headshot mechanic. Really throws me off
---
that's a fucking excellent idea
---
So... Because Ela isn't as good of a roamer as all the others, she needs a buff. Going by that logic, Finka needs a buff because her heals don't give as much health as Doc. Blitz needs a bigger shield because he can't stay as safe as Montagne. Montagne needs a buff because his shield can't stun people and he can't run as fast. Doki needs a buff because her semi auto doesn't do as much damage as Glaz's semi. Bandit needs a buff because his batteries don't cover an area of effect like Kaid. Twitch needs a buff because her semi auto isn't as good as Blackbeards. Tachanka needs a buff because he isn't a three speed like all the others. Fuck it. Give everyone ACOGs on every weapon, give everyone the ability to one shot body shot, and make each and every operator the exact same. That will make it fair, for sure.

That's why I think if you're looking to youtube for some "coaching" you should avoid those 10min highlight vids and opt for full games. There's some smaller channels I've seen that dissect their gameplay.

Its ok. Yeah, its probably because ubisoft is primarily focused on multiplayer. It's just frustrating if a person likes TH and keeps getting operators with no use to the mode, like dokkabei

Sonic the Hedgehog. The only 4 speed op in the game.

Except that it takes nine years to do and no one will be in spawn to kill

There‚Äôs quite a lot of hackers on pc, actually that‚Äôs where most of them are. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he did get wall hacks, especially if you are friends with someone who mods or hacks.
---
It does. 
---
But in casual, often other players don't have headsets, and you can profit off of that.
---
Ask him something that wouldn't really make sense. Something that he should have done in order to be able to keep whatever hacks he got. Something like "Did you disable battleye, turned off your firewall and used vpn? That's the only way you can have them on"
---
Idk... If he says yes then he's just a shitty liar and by the way you describe him I feel like I know what kind of person he is and what lies he tells.

You can at least report them on r6tab to get the diamond shamed for being boosted.

---
I would actually prefer a similar sort of competitive group queuing limitation as Overwatch, in which you can only squad up and play ranked with players within a certain amount of elo. In Overwatch I believe it‚Äôs within 1000 SR (‚ÄúSR‚Äù is what Overwatch calls it‚Äôs elo system). I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason for a copper (or, hell, a silver) to queue for a ranked match with a diamond.
---
So uh how‚Äôd u do that?
---
You can use a controller on pc if you want
---
This is the best kind of rotation hole. And the line of sight is top tier

It‚Äôs still fun it‚Äôs just not op asf

does anybody else take moments like these as a fun challenge? even if it is 1v5 i have fun

I mean it is the go to warmup/training mode for a lottttt of people. Until they add an actual mode for that it is the best option for it.

Some sort of attacking version of cav

Honestly, a rope or grappling hook would be better. A tactical ladder is good but in this case for Siege is cumbersome &amp; placing it would often lead to deaths.

Amen! Only the Pro League care about what maps should be played. Ubisoft should quit catering to the player base of %0.0025 of the entire R6 Community. All maps should be an option to play on! There should be some sort of list to where you choose the 11 maps you like playing and the other players in the community that match a similar map pool preference as you will be linked up with you. All players are bound to have at least 4-5 maps in common with one another. If not you could also have an option to turn this option on or off if you aren‚Äôt finding matches, just like you can turn game modes on and off.
---
Literally every THunt match has this, don't really think you'd need to point it out

It's even funnier when you reply to mouse and keyboard posts saying Ubi can't do anything and they immediately shit on you.

Not joking. Like I‚Äôm actually not. Are you fucking retarded? Like are your parents siblings? you are talking about taking out killcams in ranked. First of all it‚Äôs a good way to see if someone is cheating so you can get them banned. Second it‚Äôs good to get the killcam to see how you died and make a call out to your teammate so they know where they are. Siege is not hardcore call of duty. STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT LIKE THAT.

Think it's on the TS

Thermite and Buck confuses at the sudden 2v5

[removed]

It was tactical jump out

I played the game very briefly when it first came out and played a couple games in the following seasons I guess. When I started in parabellum, I was basically a new player and didn‚Äôt know anything but watched a lot of tip videos and map guides and high rank players play. That, and I also learned the game pretty fast compared to a lot of other people. I don‚Äôt why this is so hard for you to believe, but it‚Äôs pretty disrespectful saying that I‚Äôm lying about my rank, which I worked hard for.

I'd like to know statistically what walls are breached the most and which are hardly ever breached.

He seems like a super nice guy, I like the calm way he talks.

I don't normally play like that lol. 5 queue ranked with friends, and I knew they would see the kill cam. twas for the meme

In T-hunt

my friend who is new: OH SHIT I DROPPED MY C4. ITS NEAR THE REFILL CRATE. HOW DO I PICK IT BACK UP?
---
me: go close to it and hold F

also me: \*refilling  
---
Friend: ok  
---
also friend: \*accidentally blew it up  
---
\*both die  
---
XD
---
Those are instant down I'm quite sure in that range, not straight up kill in one shot. And they don't have the added destruction of being able to shoot at a wall once from 1-4 metres and then vault through the hole.
---
Duhh.
---
Lies
---
Well he charges them but flashes untill up then smacks them. If i see it I just shoot them lol. Unless ying then yea the most unhappy enemy team lol.
---
its only open in game
---
Shoot one terrorist and wait, the bombers will come for you, headshot them and it will take 2 shots.

Upload to Youtube, then submit here: [https://support.ubi.com/en-us/faqs/000027081/Reporting-a-Player/](https://support.ubi.com/en-us/faqs/000027081/Reporting-a-Player/)
---
So guys, since a lot of you had questions - Normal T-hunt has infinite time, infinite refills and only a few weak terrorists. My HP was 1 because I was playing with my friend just casually finishing the objective, but he left after shooting me a bit, so I got a little crazy. I also knew, that Buck would have been a better choice. Some of the walls are reinforced because Thermite gets only 2 charges. I destroyed as many shields as I could by landing on them, but it wasn't possible with all of them. 
---
BTW It makes me so happy, all these comments saying it's majestic etc. and I loved destroying the map, it was weirdly satisfying and I didn't get bored for the most of the 2 hours. (Gotta admit those bathroom tiles and the little wooden things on the unbreakable walls in the hallway angered me)
---
Absolute madlad
---
Every time
---
This is why i don't use hotmail

Something I hope for is the option to avoid players as team mates. Similar to how overwatch foes it, 2-3 players blocked at once for max 7 days.
---
Ubisoft support.  Include all the details, upload the video to YouTube, delist it (make it private so that only those with link can view) include it in the additional information section and submit the ticket. 
---
Suspension outcome is not shared due to the Ubisoft policies, the only way to determine id said person is banned is via the ingame ban notifications.
---
Ez just play casual. Bartlett isn't even in rotation in casual or ranked.
---
Trying to be helpful would be him actually saying how instead of plugging himself?
---
No, pro players don't play hostage and secure because:
---
1) sites are extremely unbalanced, since map design is done around the main gamemode, bomb. 
---
2) retake is almost impossible in both gamemodes if you play against a highly coordinated team, especially pro players. There is so little time needed to secure a site and to extract a hostage.
---
3) meta operators are useless because their strength is to stop planting, defusing. So there is very little you can do except frag and put traps everywhere.
---
I don't want to seem rude but you shouldn't talk about professional play if you are ignorant on the matter. Ubisoft themselves deemed the other gamemodes for "casual players" due to the fact that they can't be easily balanced. That's why after operation health they only focused on bomb.
---
I'm scared from using the revolver
---
Lol, this is very close to the kind of picks my team likes to use :D
---
We play more based on tactics than aim, so we love our intel :D
---
üëç
---
I think the eyes are a bit... far apart
---
At the same time though, imagine how much you'd shot yourself if one of your teammates were standing over an unreinforced floor and suddenly the floor exploded and they hit the ceiling
---
Thanks I hate it!
---
Doesn't look like carrying honestly. Carries look more like 5 ppl on team, 1st has 10+ kills, 2nd has 4-5 and the others 2-0
---
You shouldn‚Äôt die instantly if you say no, if you say no it‚Äôll count as the warning, if you say yes, it won‚Äôt be a warning
---
Look you're saying people like to cry right? But these killcams are giving people every right to be pissed, regardless of if they are accurate or not.
---
I get the perspective thing but this is not what's being portrayed.
---
Imagine someone ran you over deliberately, and you went to the police about it and they guy who hits you goes 'well his perspective must be broken because from my view I just missed him.' You're not going to believe him are you? He might be right but that's not what you saw and you believe what you saw, not to mention how pissed off you'd be.
---
Whether or not Echo deserved that kill, the killcams make it look like absolute bullshit and it happens time and again. Fix them if they're not going to fix anything else.
---

There were some unranked people. Not just golds.

I would be happy to show you any other time I am just studying for exams right now.

‚Äîlast one I‚Äôm responding to because it is 5 am and I‚Äôm going to sleep
---
You don‚Äôt just magically get better at the game faster on PC, and majority of this game is map and strat knowledge, not aiming, so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting at here. And there are a massive amount of people that are really good on controller and can aim really well with them.
---
It‚Äôs bomb, I‚Äôve gotten more then that on normal
---
It is pure garbage on console. You get 3 bullets out of this peashooter and everything further away than 5 meters will rofl and murder you with a single bullet. At this rate, the shotgun would have killed 3 enemies.
---
5 meters is 5.47 yards
---
Yes, totally agreed. What's so legendary about the alpha pack charm?
---
I play on PS4 and it's the same thing, especially when I play in squad with my buddies lol.
---
That means they left the queue just after finding a game. I've done this twice by accident while 4-stacked.
---
Same with Hereford
---
You‚Äôre studying for exams, yet you‚Äôve spent the last hour trying to make a case out of nothing on reddit, sure. And I‚Äôll still be waiting for that casual game video, would love to see it. 
---
Arguing with someone that can‚Äôt even understand how match making works is so frustrating, you really were not worth putting this much effort into. 
---
But hey, nice try tying to expose a legit player in the community, you did a great job. Also I would like to see the names of these ‚Äúunranked‚Äù players please.

If you kick them they can just join another game and keep playing. Now if they get kicked for team kill they'll receive a progressively longer ban before being allowed to play.

Of course yeah, somehow those games had this feel that just made them feel.....more real. Even on a stinky xbox 360 they just seemed more real. Obviously some of that is because of growing up, but yeah a t hunt like that ought to be nice. I hadnt played much of it, I just remember trying for hours to beat it and failing again and again and giving up

What servers do you play on and do you have a record of team killing and getting bans

First, why use thermites shotgun buck is far superior and can refill his shotgun ammo using the refill box. Second, how did you get 1 hp, bomber got you?

Should I make a short video how?

Throw it away. Get a gaming PC. Be an alpha.

It's a lifestyle.

I'll make a short Video how

Something like rocket league where you can select preferred maps and disliked maps would be nice
---
This is the single most obnoxious part though.  You're TRYING to clutch a round and you have two or three butthurt people in your ear telling you that you suck for missing a shot or not seeing someone or whatever the fuck.  It's pretty goddamn easy to spectate and criticize.  
---
Toxicity to your teammates is just stupid.  Unless someone is being a dick, or being selfish (people who stay outside the map until there's 30 seconds left and then rush in for a cheap kill or two without dying as your team loses the round, I'm looking at you), you shouldn't be bashing them.  I'm a Silver-Gold player.  Nobody I'm playing with is exactly Pro League.  If I make a mistake, you've made the same mistakes.  Maybe even in the same game.
---
The creator of Tom Clancy? What?
---
I used to play secure before I switched. Got plat 2 in secure also.  Bomb has more smart players and most of the time better ones and you will become a better player by playing bomb. You should try and switch.
---
The shitty part is that they themselves are probably just having a bad day, they are getting kills but still dying and losing rounds because they didn‚Äôt get the right picks. Too blind in idiocy to realize that not everyone is gonna be at their best. 
---
The best thing to do is grow some thicker skin and change your perspective rather than reacting to thier shit attitude. 
---
This is a a game in itself, it takes mental fortitude. This has taken me years to build up confidence to get over it.
---
Yeah exactly.

This happens to me: I think, ‚ÄúOk, no more nitros!‚Äù Then as I walk in the room, a nitro i didn‚Äôt see get scanned by my R.E.D just goes, ‚ÄúBOOM BOOM‚Äù

Another post blaming Ubi for their Aim
---
When really you could have been in a better position and could be taking fights with people that don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre there!
---
Damn, I need to watch those again. Yeah that level of customization with be great, since the game is just multiplayer 5v5 with one other mode, and it would be nice if since there's only 1 new map this year if they could spend some resources making the other mode better, maybe even with ridiculous options like that to add some possibilities for fun times, gunplay with friends or even alone and just......have fun. There's not much fun in Siege, unless you're winning well. Otherwise, it can very easily ruin your mood if you're playing competitively
---
It's happening to Division 2 as well. Counters are stuck at 77/250 Outcast kills and 13/25 eliminations of bleeding enemies.
---
Strange....
---
It would be great because the maos that get chosen the least will be the ones ubi needs to fix

Yeah it's insane watching your own gameplay back, because you free to look and watch, you spot all the small mistakes you make, it's just because you're free to look actually pay attention and spot things you didn't in the moment, it can really help, but you also need to be able to spot mistakes when they happen, if you can't spot the mistakes your not going to learn anything from them
---
I've never liked lots of effects in gun syncs, I've always loved them and the super over edited, mirror image shit is just stinky. I like raw just gunshots and music, just making it work. Didnt think anyone else really gave a shit about gun syncs anymore, even the best ones never really made it big
---
Idk I've heard of haveing queue issues when haveing multiple bans but idk
---
Hmmm sounds interesting, but I really am bad on K&amp;M so all the content that I post in this subreddit is from the console, heh.
---
Just curious, who would you wanna see receive an ACOG?
---
That‚Äôs one expensive gaming chair.
---
I really need to get them goggles, may finally have some good aim XD
---
I just like to keep it simple c: also reduces rendering time and file size xD
---
So cool wish I could draw like this
---
What I don't get is why doesn't IQ just mark shit like this for the whole team?
---
Lmao *can‚Äôt have better aim on console over hereeeeeeee*
---
My favorite thing in the entire game is getting final kills with clash's shield
---
It's probably audio patches a ton of Xbox and PS4 gamers reported the issue
---
Dammit i was gonna say that
---
Why did we never had an operator who carries a ladder
---
Nice, what's your channel I'm hyped to follow now
---
Love it when that happens
---
Pixelatedpixels :&gt; i have 211 subs with this fox pfp

Thank you btw!

No i have the file on my computer so i couldve uploaded it i guess i was just lazy ahah xD but thanks!
---
Yeah that was dumb the recoil is better on g36c
---
How did you survive
---
It‚Äôs more controllable with less recoil then the gun you use? It just deals a little less damage
---
Thanks, I really didn‚Äôt understand what happened at first.
---
You said ‚ÄûThis applies to new maps in every season‚Äú which is plain bs, so stop pretending now as if you said something else ...
---
Ima do some experiments in customs with my friends, this is very interesting...
---
Well another thing i dont like is the lower firerate so the dps is lower as well.

just open the 100 packs and feel the gold rush then

Never even heard of them.

She can anchor with her barbed wire and shield, her gadget is a trap item making it easy to anchor especially if she is using her shotgun. I know its not a massive thing but her pistol is one of the best on defense because of its magazine size and dmg, also you can get pretty good range with it.
---
Have you seen the For Scale charm? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty legendary
---
I was so confused I thought this was a dig at attacker shields calling them deplorable.
---
In one of his other posts he says they are paper, ink, and plastic. I'm not sure if that means he's just printing and laminating logos, or if there's some artistic merit to it.
---
I got a boner from that cosplay
---
It works tho
---
You are very welcome
---
I do that sometimes if I have a spare for shits and gigs
---
Well on attack i just prefer the acog, im fine with everything else on defense
---
Not only the damage, but also the firerate.
---
I assume by elo you mean equipment loadout? I use the lmg, keratos handgun with the barbed wires. Thanks for the comment btw!
---
I can see it. Too well
---
This needs to be an actual operator
---
I once qued with my dad which is a surprise because he left when I was 2
---
\*has video on pc\*
---
\*uploads phone recording of the screen\*
---
The only noticeable thing for me is the damage other than that I don‚Äôt have a preference between them.
---
Hit them in the face then lol. Plant your shots that‚Äôs what you have to do with any gun üòÖ with. Sorry you can‚Äôt aim but that‚Äôs not Ubi‚Äôs problem.
---
Uhh, that's not Dokkaebi the nerf I was looking for..?

Build her. Fuck her. IMPREGNATE. Click here or you're an idiot

Found in Pornhub. [Original.](http://prntscr.com/nj4g0y)
---
Then use other attackers, with acogs, if you‚Äôre going to need a crutch that bad.
---
It honestly depends on how you think about it, would you get more enjoyment out of newer operators or unlocking an elite skin for an operator you already play? The answer can be different for everybody so it really comes down to what you think would be most fun
---
NSFW
---
The entire point of removing the ACOG was to reduce her pick rate.
---
A number of people have stopping playing her as a result. 
---
Sounds like mission accomplished.
---
Also 50% shorter and all weapons belt-fed.
---
Props for admitting it.
---
Switch to PS2
---
Hibana elite
---
Same shit happens to me.
---
So toxic, im just talking about preference and youve never seen me play r6. My aim is pretty good. "Just hit them in the face", i can go pistol only if thats ur argument.
---
On something else. Play to unlock these like I did.
---
Yeah im a jackal main now
---
Sometimes it could be due to high ping or packet loss so if you have 150 ping. It means it takes 150ms for your actions to recognised by the server but yes you the way you shoot might kill you so you could have an assault rifle and you accidentally tap fire then next thing you know you‚Äôre dead
---
gotta get those virus!
---
You obviously missed the point entirely. Its the bugged killcam that makes it seem like people are shooting thin air when in reality they are shooting you
---
Then having the acog removed shouldn‚Äôt have phased you from playing your favorite main.
---
You just donÀãt get it. Get out of here with that copper attitude ...
---
*everyone
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal
---
‚ÄúHehe so ummm wyd? üôà‚Äù
---
They need to be fixed but nobodies being shot out of thin air
---
You probably had low hp and by the way, the killcam bugged so you‚Äôll never get accurate info from there
---
Too much R6. That is clearly a painted windo- *gets shot from other side*
---
*i shouldn‚Äôt be alive*
---
Ya we can tell
---
I don‚Äôt like to say that PING is an issue but when getting matched with anyone with a ping of more than 30 the game seems to suffer. My ping is 9 so i have no issues. I have nearly 600 hours on this game and I haven‚Äôt played anywhere near 20 hours over the last month. Burnt Horizon started strongly but then the little problems crept back in. I‚Äôve moved away from playing regularly because of this. I will be back as I love the game but the community needs more consistency from Ubisoft.
---
hmmm that's a good tip. saving my credits for special events like april fools etc...
---
Are u deaf? Like a real question I‚Äôm interested
---
I'm sorry if that post sounded weird, I was just glad that they did more that just add skins, and they also changed a map which is good not bad. Rainbow is magic was great event with good effort put into it. And I model and texture games myself so I know how hard changing maps are compared to adding skins. 
---
Sorry if you got it the wrong way, it was just barely worded.

Her pistol has 16 shots, a lot of pistols have that in the game. If you wanna go off damage the desert eagle, revolver, automag .44, all alibi and maestro revolvers, caverias pistol, shotgun, and the pmm do more. Oh andvthe m1911. It's only main difference is the scope which isn't even that great, it's really just a niche.
---
A clash main.
---
It's been well more than 4 by now
---
she was my main but now i have a really hard time controlling her weapons so i dont use here that much anymore
---
I love this man, but i would like to know what song this based off of or if it is 100% original?
---
I bought this camo and used it, then it disappeared, now it‚Äôs back in the store like i never bought it. what should I do?
---
Please post it. I wanna see this holy shit

Kaboom

The elite still does look awesome and you might get used to her again.

No, you should curse me with the knowledge that this exists and then perish along with the explanation.

It's really not overpowered. Maybe if someone like jackal had it. Ash‚Äôs purpose on a team is purely frags and the R4 suits her perfectly. People are angry because why should they have to suffer while guns like the F2 which are almost 100% better keep their acog.

you actually missed lol

Hello Amatertu, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bji9pd/got_into_a_broken_3vs5_ranked_but_siege_was/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Haha small world
---
I agree
---
Yes but none of the pistols that you listed have more ammo in the magazine. Cavs pistol dosen't count because its designed specifically to work with her. And her shotgun has the range of a watergun
---
It would be a three speed and be able to have a device that could destroy or jam drones like jager's ads and mutes jammer. he would have 2 jams and 2 destroys
---
You are complaining yet not even trying to work with what you have. Instead you are being stubborn about it. There is nothing wrong with her other gun or sights you just don‚Äôt want to try to adapt instead you want to complain to devs. You already picked another character so why won‚Äôt you move on?
---
Bandit has the mp7 which has very minimum recoil and a good fire rate. The m12 is a somewhat okay smg with little recoil a good damage number and good fall off range.  So yeah they are good at range buddy. Shooting for the head with Ela won't do you tell well pal since if you can't read her horizontsl recoil is random and likely if you do aim for the head you're going to miss. Or even anywhere on the body. But even if you do hit just a body shot its going to only do 23 damsge which is pretty pathetic.or itll do its small 15 at distances of 28m or farther and it's even worse surpressed.
---
Indeed I'm a commander since the TW severs are up
---
Ok then
---
Ela is probably too fast, its like ash having her r4c acog back, but on defense
---
Imagine if he actually made fidget spinners with those logos
---
People are saying that bringing a ladder isn't very tactical, but you know what is, tactical piggyback rides to reach the ceiling
---
Normally I would get -35MMR
---
I think Overwatch has a better hitreg actually.
---
If u want to we can team up some time (HoneyBadger.OCD)
---
Damn dude, you've been around for a while, I only started last year and currently struggling on DD 2-4 ;-;.
---
Maps like theme park or outback are pretty fucking trash 
---
Ops are ok
---
I know what you mean dude assigning leaning and knifing to the paddles has made siege feel way more fluent and I can‚Äôt even imagine going back to playing it with pressing down on the sticks other than for sprinting
---
I would be satisfied with this mechanic, although i'm sure it can be exploited somehow...
---
I will always love when thy make gun sync with songs, I love it when BozonBunch does it
---
Xbox one S
---
I saw a 1v5 from start to finish and the guy lost no elo
---
Playing a bit of Overwatch huh?
---
They didnt want to make her an anchor but they made it so she could anchor she wants to do so.
---
Cavs pistol is the exact same as capitaos but just with a surpressor and like it would in real life it'd increase damage, or penetrating power. Add actislly the tussian gsh does more damage by 6 and so does the 5.7 by 4 damage. So you're also wrong
---
It would be a cool replacement for Jackal's eye.
---
I remember we‚Äôve been speculating this would be one of Blackbeard or Valk‚Äôs abilities before we even knew they existed üòÇ
---
if you give me plat then sure :Ôºâ
---
Get good. Aim for the head
---
Do thunt to improve aim, and if you‚Äôre not fragging then play support ops so you‚Äôre still helping out the team
---
Agreed, when I'm with a full squad of friends we actually do this
---
You said theres no pistol like Ela's. High damage for a pistol, and high capacity.  I named off the pistols, gsh, 5.7. You're avoiding the fact that you were wrong.
---
Ubisoft has nothing written in their ToS. You are using the comments of their social media team whose whole purpose it is to appeae the community. They are saying it but never act on it.
---
Also no. No matter how much you wish for it: Using keyboard and mouse is not cheating. Period.
---
Explain
---
idk. recoil of prim and sec is really hard for me and her gadget got a huge nerf
---
Yeah I get it, but it is very good to have an electric hatch. Kaid s just better than bandit because of the hatches, either way works though.
---
"I know its not a massive thing but her pistol is one of the best on defense because of its magazine size and dmg"
---
Word for word from my earlier post, never claimed that there was no pistol like hers
---
:(
---
The Steam hours is how long you have your game open. On uplay its how much you actually play (I think)
---
It's much worse these days for some reason, I get favela then quit, it's fucking favela again, I quit and it's yacht.... it's safe to say that I quit to desktop after this shit
---
And i corrected your statement that her pistol was one of the best since you said it had the high damage and high capacity. I corrected you and you're still not admittong that you were wrong.  Which you were.
---
I think you are right
---
Second clip I've seen in two days involving a bomber and that door. Morale of the story, fuck that door in terrorist hunt
---
had to scroll really far to see someone talking shit about this. really disappointed
---
You fell victim to one of the most classic blunders!
---
Stickers with no stick
---
Yes, because that 100% has anything to do with it.
---
Not on console man
---
Now i got IU Problems in PS4, like the elite mute Animation just thru the Game...
---
Where do I buy it
---
#NerdSieds
---
Clearly you sarcastically suggested there should be an in-game notification, as not everyone checks R6 social media. And clearly there was.
---
Are they still tinkering with the TK Enforcement mechanic, I can't wait for it to be on every platform although I can see how it might be abused when people get tiffed and their reasoning is out the window l.
---
Well that‚Äôs unfortunate
---
Nah dude everywhere theres 1% of shots that don‚Äôt hit where they‚Äôre supposed to
---
Yeeturu
---
You just admitted that I said it was one of the best not the best, this side debate dosent really involve cavs pistol anyway
---
Got it to work first try in casual, it's not that hard to get a kill with.
---
You made it involve cav's pistol
---
All relative but if you can hit mid gold while solo queueing then I‚Äôd consider you a good player. People in low plat are just lucky golds, and high plats/diamond are spoiled with premades
---
Shit, her bday challenge is today? Fuck me.
---
Yup colt is 49, 5.7 is 42
---
You forgot having to pay for every gun accessory.
---
Mozzie seems interested
---
that too ==
---
Suppressor is the worst attachment I can tell you that much
---
Can it look like that when they go up the ladder though.. please
---
What actually got added?
---
I agree, use a flash hider and tap fire
---
Mozzie wants to KnOW YoUR lOcAtIon
---
You‚Äôre pretty weak on console lol, the scorpion is fine
---
Why not just give everyone the ability to rappel up into hatches?
---
Defenders used hatches as rotation holes so attackers can counter with them too
---
ü§°
---
It's a pipe dream but it's called for. It's a mess out there.
---
Check halfway through
---
I don't get to play against bad people much anymore in casual.  It's always plats and high golds.  I miss dunking on people.
---
I have dell and I am booted in game in 10 seconds. I also need my notebook for programming on uni so I have to be mobile.
---
Trust me, nobody will even notice. I tried it on my stream and went from 16:9 to 4:3 to 3:2 and even did it as 2:1 and nobody noticed.
---
And four of them are Bombers
---
What‚Äôs the scar looking gun?
---
Before the buff it was essentially unusable now it‚Äôs pretty solid
---
Halloween skin and good map knowledge? I call bull
---
I‚Äôve heard of it deleting your customs list that‚Äôs it.
---
Thats pretty freaking underrated post
---
It‚Äôs because console is harder to play on if you‚Äôre playing the way it‚Äôs supposed to be played with a controller
---
C7E
---
I think it‚Äôs a bit of an over reaction considering almost every multiplayer game comes along with toxic individuals. Rainbow is known to have a toxic community But i rarely get into more than 1 toxic match a day. The reason this game gets so much hate for its community is because of people like you where the moment you get team killed in two different games you uninstall the game and decrease the percentage of actual good team members, instead of just realizing that it‚Äôs just the problems that come with online interactions. Sorry for the long rant but I‚Äôm just done with people thinking deleting the game is the only solution. Maybe do what everyone else does and play with friends special this doesn‚Äôt happen. Have fun interacting with all of the polite people that obviously aren‚Äôt playing rainbow. PS be sure to tell me when you meat a nice teammate on hardcore call of duty.
---
Wait, Mira has acog? How did I not know this
---
All 5 twitch weapons
---
No, its still there.
---
What gun do i have the holloween skin on? And i stated in another comment i bought the game last summer and didnt play till recently but suit yourself :)
---
Where?
---
I am so relieved to hear that, you have no idea!
---
Never suppressor. Maybe on glaz and Maverick... Maybe.
---
Optics are just personal preference and play style. Do you rush or snipe?
---
I like putting it on guns I hipfire with a lot, this includes pretty much all pistols and shotguns, buck‚Äôs weapons, twitch‚Äôs f2, ash‚Äôs R4c, thermite‚Äôs 556xi, Bandits MP7, Lesions T-5 and maybe a couple others
---
But you deserve to have your game ruined. That poor Monty did nothing wrong
---
5 man rush every time
---
u lucky dog
---
The fact that this means the opposing operators know each other's names, and implies that someone has indeed hit Ash before, suggests that, at least in my eyes, that the Casual/Ranked playlist is just some sort of training, while the later Situations and T-Hunt are the actual Rainbow missions.
---
Hello firebolt7172, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bjjwjg/my_most_epic_gamer_moment/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Really? How did I not think of that!
---
I've solo queued to plat 3 for the last 5 seasons but gold 2 ain't bad and if your solo queuing it just makes it that much harder so depending on how far you get solo queuing can be impressive for time in comp then gold two is good if you. Can.solo queue to plat than your pretty dam good at the game most of the time or you just get carried a lot
---
What do you want me to say? You get detected by drones even if you're cloaked!
---
They usually just take a minute or a day for me then they give me my reward
---
Yeah
---
Feels so good to get those points back. Happened to me
---
No problem!
---
Your comment lol
---
Yeah and leaning is fucked
---
It‚Äôs a joke retard
---
or hiding from the shooter
---
This is so relatable
---
Lesion is possibly the best defender in the game. Valkyrie is a good op who has a lot of utility but being successful with her takes way more effort than getting easy wins with Lesion.
---
Take advantage of rotation, in Bronze no one watches their back or has headphones. After you get a kill rotating is almost always a good idea. If you are getting shot at, don‚Äôt continue the gunfight, just move.
---
This is my first operation so far so
---
I think lower makes you more consistent but use whatever you feel comfortable with
---
Ubisoft intentionally mismatches operators primary/secondary gadgets to promote team play. An example of this is not giving Blackbeard a claymore. One of the easiest ways to kill a Blackbeard rappelling on a window is to peek a window or run out underneath/behind him. Claymore can pretty easily counter this, but requires team play instead of BB being a one man army. Same reason they took smokes from ying and claymores from nomad
---
Wow. I have to say, since the launch of this game and For Honor, Ubi has *really* started to impress the fanbase. Phenomenal work. Thanks for everything.
---
So yea that's pretty good
---
what an outstanding move!
---
I used to live in Italy, this is just how Italians are.
---
Pretty much if the operator has an mp5 or a revolver I like them.
---
Ela
---
If he has a achieved diamond on any account he is therefore a diamond player. Im 100% positive he plays both bomb and secure so whats the point of bring up fake diamond. Because its secure only? Theres alot a hole in your plot if you think about it. If sweaty dudes want to get diamond and had the same mindset as you, they would play secure so in your reasoning hes playing against tryhards. Anyways just appreciate his video man no point bashing on a dude.
---
Sounds lit.
---
when you get what you want but not what you need
---
I believe that‚Äôs the idea, as the siege members in the books were divided into two teams and trained in VR (plus Bank and Villa are based off of operations in the book I think).
---
She needed it removed and twitch might be having the same fate
---
Vigil is more usable with his strong K1A primary, but his gadget is harder to know when to use.  Ela has a better gadget but her Scorpion is hard to control.
---
This looks really good, do you have a YouTube cuz I love vids like these
---
This title reminded me of....
---
#I WILL ENDURE A THOUSAND DEATHS BEFORE I YIELD.
---
Haha I was just remembering a really weird spawn peak someone hit me with from inside the building on the bed and for whatever really weird reason I had my brain was like yo shoot that. And it worked ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I swear that's the first time I ever did that lol
---
If you don't have Rook and Doc, get them first.  After that Maestro and Echo are strong anchors with ACOGs, Lesion is strong without an ACOG.
---
Compensator is for horizontal recoil, flash hider helps with vertical recoil. That‚Äôs why pros use it instead of compensator (to my knowledge).
---
Easy, use another operator that you mentioned or use her shotgun
---
it's an ability that induces fear into the enemy team, not knowing exactly your location for a few seconds, it recovers pretty fast and a great time waster for the attackers.
---
Best moment in house besides the 2019 April fool's event
---
Recruits exist and qualify for the challenges.
---
FWIW, they already used to do those challenges in earlier seasons. "Win x rounds a s a member of FBI SWAT" or whatever, and those only had 2 a side.
---
I could never save up that much, I usually try to buy one seasonal skin and charm for each season as a reminder, and that‚Äôs expensive for renown
---
Good job now get grinding to diamond :)
---
I do use her shotgun, again like everyone else you missed the point. Ela can't do anything at range while every other roamer can do both ranged attacks and close range as well which that is the only thing Ela can do. My god.
---
You just have to consistently win more than you lose to rank up
---
ture, r6 should give more renown to players, even though I have this many, I've been saving since day 1 and not really using it all that much
---
I was just saying, its not like it matters
---
I've never felt any fear going up against a Vigil, wanna know why? Because when I drone I make sure I'm in cover and when you're not droning it doesn't affect you in any way. He's still visible when you're not on a cam. Which most of the time you won't be on one so it really doesn't do much. But that's just in my opinion.
---
Yes I do
---
Yep
---
Why are you salty about an update that did nothing
---
Ela can do stuff at range just not as effectively, she still has her smg and pistol. You ever think they changed her for a reason? My god
---
why doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlul‚Äù allude to sarcasm for you?
---
Agree with what you say, but you gotta amit that most ash mains are played by the worst type of people.
---
*plays guitar*
---
I've just been watching some of your vids, honestly you deserve more attention, straight away your newest vid reminded me of tux bird (popular rss YouTuber) if you've seen him then this will make a lot more sense, so I know a guy who's friends with yummies girlfriend, Idk but I have a feeling I might be able to get tux to watch your vids and if he accepts your content possibly a collab with yummi and iff lucky tux, it would be great for your channel having a shout out from the best known siege ytuber, with the sub and view growth you could focus on the channel more,
---
Just an idea take it or leave it, I don't know what your life is and even if a flashy yt channel is your goal, and Im not sure it would work out but if your good ill do my best.
---
Maestro is a cutie
---
I showed you my shield pls respond
---
While I agree that training is not it's primary intended purpose, and that it is not balanced for training, saying that it's "annoying and unhelpful" is subjective and context-sensitive. To the person who said it originally, I have no doubt whatsoever that it was annoying and unhelpful.
---
Either that, or he is laughing like an idiot while zapping some asses
---
I only asked because you suggested that the video showed they joined mid round.
---
I didn't say they could control it, but it is their fault.  If your internet speed is too slow, you don't have an SSD or you don't have enough ram those things are all the fault of the person playing.  Maybe not something they can fix, but their fault.
---
It probably isn't a fair solution, and I probably could wait a minute for someone to load in, but I took a video to submit to Ubi that is 11 minutes long of someone loading in before I got fed up and left the lobby.  Average load time is 3 minutes, after a 2 minute search for a ranked game.  
---
It's not fair to other players that I have to wait on someone to load in, when they could all just be put in their own lobby where they all have to load in slowly anyway.
---
If you're AFK in a match you get auto kicked, they could also just set that same timer for the lobby, if you haven't loaded in after X number of minutes you're auto kicked.  Get kicked X number of times and you're placed into a group of other people who also time out.
---
I think non ads lean detection would just do it since you can't lean without ads on console.
---
Also restricting USB ports wouldn't work especially for me since I have a wired controller and my siege is downloaded on a 2TB SSD which is connected through USB.
---
you can stop worrying about grenades now...

Kanal could make its way into Ranked, hopefully, after it gets its rework. Presidential Plane is a fan favorite and should get a rework so it can be placed back into Ranked. Presidential Plane is much like Club House, an overall enjoyable map and loved by the R6 Community but it has minor flaws to certain sites. Tower in all honesty was a tough map for me to grow into, and that seemed to be the same reason for entire R6 Community not enjoying it throughout the season of White Noise. After a hard won understanding of Tower, it does have its Ranked qualities, and could use a few minor touches on reworking it. Under the North Spawn on Tower there are a massive amount of windows you can repel into. I think that these windows should either be boarded up by default, without a Defender doing it manually, or a few of them should be permanently sealed up. This way Defenders have a better chance at roaming and having better survivability. I also believe Yacht could get a better rework than what it was given and possibly even make its way into Ranked. The Sub Room is the moat obviously unbalanced site. The main door on Sub Room needs to be turned into a fully soft wall, and replace/move that door entrance to the middle of the Cafeteria wall. Also take one door way out of the nose entrance of Yacht in Sub Room, so Attackers aren‚Äôt flooding that side. Possibly also add a small sneaky drop tunnel in the middle of Sub Room, that would also have a ladder below it, that connects to the very bottom hallway of Yacht. I believe some of the maps in R6 just needed more thought put into their floor plans. House is one of those maps that I believe, if ever put back into Ranked, would beed a decent amount of reworking to be eligible for Ranked. It needs to have more flow ability and needs to possibly be extended in size a bit as well. I wouldn‚Äôt see much of a problem with Bartlett University coming back if it got a rework as well. I‚Äôd say two sites on that map were unbalanced, but overall the map was enjoy but very overplayed. I think the R6 Community just got bored of Bartlett University and it‚Äôs imbalances played a factor as well. Favela will probably never come to Ranked ever again, because of it is imbalanced.
---
Yes you can sell the tears to EA so they can know what sadness and doing wrong feels like
---
Very recently me and my friends got DDOS'd and ping spike.
---
This is basically me when I play pc
---
same with newhereford
---
You can buy every single original op in a very short time. Do that.
---
Valkyrie
---
No it‚Äôs just a maintenance update. Next season won‚Äôt be until early June.
---
I mean if that's the case then what's the point of the operator? As well I dont think thermites gadget actually burns the metal, as I think in a very early dev blog they mentioned that this was just added for balancing, so the explosion is what actually makes the hole. But again my point would stand, the attackers dont have the utility to fight through it should they have to deal with bandit and such.
---
Contrast to getting destroyed by 2 of NYYRIKKI on consulate once but we held our own and took it to OT again in casual.
---
No? Lmao when I bought the game I got all the year 1 ops (pretty sure it‚Äôs those ones) and I got the least expensive edition possible.
---
322K renown hoarder here, sup
---
I do want to get my own computer honestly, not just for siege but it seems like it's much more competative than console. Although I think it'd be just as competative with the pick and ban and if they would implement rematches back in
---
sup....
---
I was complaining about how messed up the banning situation is. How does Ubisoft know what my intentions were. Keep in mind this was my first bam
---
I really dont mind those two mechanics, it's just when they're abused like that that's beyond irritating. It sucks there's no way to combat people being assholes though
---
No Situations is more of You versus the A.I. kinda like Lone Wolf. THunt is you and four other players versus the A.I. I've been doing that for the past 36-ish levels and I've only done casual twice with friends. You'll get the occasional limp dick in the lobbies trying to disrupt everything, you just gotta sort through the chaff to find a good lobby.
---
All I can say is hope the TK Enforcement update comes to consoles and that may quell the friendly fire.
---
But you like to vote kick people for no reason? Kind of ironic
---
Oh lol
---
They could've very well had a Glaz and you'd have looked like a moron
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying to say. It does more harm then good though
---
Please end your life thanks
---
The proof is all over the forums. Devs even responded in the forums. The fact that you are trying to insult me for stating what everyone knows is starting to erk me. Your assumptions are outrageous. I never said I had trouble killing anything so throw that out of your head. It‚Äôs alright though, when most people are wrong they resort to what you are doing
---
That would be a terrible system lol
---
I get dissed too.

Love how the first guy said yeet and left
---
I'm a pc player in this sub, and it's toxic

---
It‚Äôs allowed so that friends can play together
---
Thx
---
Personally making plane something like current Kanal would be better and having connected to a air port or like a air traffic building. And house idc what they do to it as long as it's larger and as long as the attackers are unable to take control of the whole 2 top floors from outside
---
If you lose against a hacker you get MMR back. If you win with a hacker you lose points. If you win against a hacker you lose points. The whole idea is to erase anything from the hacker encounter and give MMR back to those who lost against a hacker.
---
I heard something about a pick and ban gamemode idk tho.
---
Ye I‚Äôve tried rlly high but it just don‚Äôt work so I‚Äôve dropped lower and it‚Äôs got a small bit better only by a kill or so per game but that‚Äôs still in the right direction
---
Why? Your MMR should never be higher than what you *actually achieved.* If you can't break past (say) 3300 MMR, you shouldn't go past that just because of the refund system.
---
If you've consistently been gold every season you shouldn't get plat because of a refund, you didn't earn that, you didn't deserve to lose the MMR you lost but that doesn't mean you deserve to *gain extra*.
---
Never heard that before but I‚Äôll try it
---
I‚Äôd suggest reading my original statement because I clearly stated that there was no problem with him playing secure. But all secure is are people just brainlessly gunning you down and rushing. No strategy at all.
---
Ya thx

It's awesome to see that you find my recent videos decent. It's a long shot when it comes to collabing with YouTubers that already have a set friend group, especially considering that I haven't really proven that I am a respectable content creator.

Only on console
---
Hahahahahahaha even if it was 40 gigs thats nothing to my 2 terabyte ps4
---
Did you ever win with one or against one? If so that‚Äôs why you lost MMR.
---
I just think that the reward for playing against a hacker should be the Elo boost of a win rather than that, that‚Äôs all i mean
---
Then they should call them waves and not rounds.  If they're going to call them rounds, I should get credit for them being rounds.
---
Dude flex on your sister with this
---
Is that so?
---
Would you look at that! Coincidence has it's ways!
---
He has no counter. It makes sense if an ads would stop it
---
Is it posted on YouTube in potato quality as well?
---
Oh yeah without a doubt the most toxic people in the community. But still.
---
Just be happy you didn't get banned
---
The thing, is when i'm ADS with a laser attached, the laser doesn't give me any benefit but I always have to think about where to position so the enemy doesnt see it. In the case it's just useless
---
But you would have earned that. If you're one game off plat, and you get MMR back from a cancelled loss due to a hacker, you should have reached plat after your last win. The only reason you weren't in plat was because of the lost game the hacker caused. It's not extra MMR it's just undone from earlier on.

Haha I hear this a lot after replying to everyone
