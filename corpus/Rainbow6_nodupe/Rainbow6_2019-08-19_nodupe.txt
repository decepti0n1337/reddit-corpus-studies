fair enough.
---
---
---
Beautiful look up, same thing is for the invitational charm, quality is improving guys.
---
Plain and simple, the game gets stale. The enjoyment of the user is still necessary to the.. y'know, the enjoyment of the player lol. Just because you don't think so doesn't mean you should dismiss it.
---
Definitely equally, gadgets are  mostly pointless if you dont have a gun to use with them and siege is just a boring shooter without gadgets.
---
Maybe they will make the season pass a bit more expensive. Like 5‚Ç¨/$ or whatever. And the stand alone BP will cost 10‚Ç¨ or $ or whatever currency. I hope you get the idea. Season Pass including battlepass: 35‚Ç¨. Battlepass stand alone: 10‚Ç¨
---
Its a tactical shooter what did you expect would happen if you're matched with random people, Of course it wont be cohesive. ~~Lots of toxic and uncommunicative people solo queue because nobody wants them on their team~~
---
Whats funnier then 26? 24
---
Because it adds more variety? A good deal of the guns being reused aren't bad, just out shined by the other options. IQ has 3 good-great guns, but 2 of them hardly see any play because the 552 is just better. The G8 isn't a bad weapon (not to mention being buffed) it's just not as good as the 552. Same thing with the P229, not bad, but most people opt to use the bearing. 
---

---
Not to mention, people use the Vector, TSCG, ITA12s and SMG-11 so it's not like they're only giving bad guns. The vector and TSCG are two of the best guns on def. 
---
Giving a new OP the FMG wasn't a bad idea, putting it on Nokk was however.
---
Ash can make 5 holes you can walk through, Hibana can make 3 ‚Äúwalk-through‚Äù holes, a crouch hole and a peek hole
---
It has that one VERY broken spawn peek, but other than that it's a fine map. Skyscraper can fucking go tho.
---
Search bar man
---
Nice
---
Because up till now they didnt do anything to bad other than being late to fix some VERY OBVIOUS bugs
---
None it is insensitive and I‚Äôm not saying they should leave, but Publishers are notorious for pushing stupid shit for their Devs to push to make money, things that the Devs may not agree with, but have to. The Devs are subject to their publisher. EA is a big dog, you can‚Äôt just find another Publisher. They have to deal with having EA, frankly because it doesnt appear that they have a choice. 
---
People will always get mad at the wrong people for wrong reasons. Right now, I don‚Äôt believe that people are mad at Respawn for the wrong reasons.
---
Agreed.
---
Guns have nothing to do with the season pass guns are not included in the season pass only operators that are and then the little other benefits not even maps are included
---
You are paying for a 7-Day exclusivity and instant unlock of brand new operators.
---
Exclusive skins for operators not their guns you get one universal skin.
---
You get discounts and more renown.
---
It does not say new guns anywhere included in the season pass.
---
What a mad lad
---
I just hate chalet because every site feels impossible to defend, and the two best sites feel impossible to attack. I know that sounds kinda weird but i just cant find a strat that works on that map. The only way i feel i ever win is by getting picks early or if the other team is awful.
---
In casual if you join mid game the rest of the team has a tendency to kick because it takes too long to load in. Other times is prob a 4 stack fucking around in casual.
---
I keep saying that, but people seem only to notice that Warden is luckluster (he is..) but completely overlook Nokk.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
She brings nothing to the team, her weapon choices are bad (except for the Deagle, maybe?) and her gadget is.. meh. It's good in concept but it's not very impactful and she brings no utility to the table.
---
Looks pretty good to me, well done!
---
Honestly I just want to see what the Black Mirror looks like
---
**RUSSOOOOOO**
---
**YOU HEAR MEE?**
---
**I'M GONNA WATCH YOU DIEEE**
---
But what if it's not an answer what if it's a tear in the space-time continuum
---
What the fuck 2!
---
I told you in the post: when i ads with a 1x optic it buttfucks the sens.
---
I'd say just shoot him at round start and leave
---
Definitely! A strong gun with a strong gadget would definitely be too OP. Meanwhile, a weak gun with a weak gadget would be too weak.
---
So your argument regarding longevity and new guns are... what exactly? You still haven't answered me yet.
---
You can hear Nokk, if she's sprinting. Which you would have to be doing if you wanted to get to the objective in time before you gadget runs out lol, which is what we're talking about. And that's assuming there's no roamers. Like this whole argument is making me scratch my head, to be honest

what arre you talking about its already in the store
---
People need to stop buying this shit period. Fucking pisses me off, they add it became morons eat it up.
---
Playing warden is equivalent to throwing. That‚Äôs just my opinion
---
Man my favorite thing about new ops are the new weapons I like to see new I know gadgets are new but that's only 1/2 an operator
---
That is likeness
---
Every gun company is different there is a reason why we don't have anything that resembles a Glock
---
god yes i see some good patterns!
---
i farmed 150k renown because i hoped for some sick skins like we had this season
---
Hello michnaj, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
If you are on console then it's MnK users.
---
Operators are kinda useless without guns fella hence why when you buy one they come with a few guns.
---
I didn't like the specific selection, but I'm 100% fine with using existing weapons.  Some ops have great weapons that can be easily used on other ops - like the Vector that the new defense op is getting.
---
Yeah, definitely not, I agree! Which is why I'm trying to understand others POV. From my POV, the new gadgets bring new ways to attack a site, but a new gun does not bring anything to the table.
---
If what someone wants is a strong gun, then they can reuse a strong gun, but a new strong gun and an old strong gun is no different.
---
Meanwhile Destiny 2 is gonna be 150gb after Moon‚Äôs Haunted DLC
---
&gt; Better for them to reuse old weapons that are already balanced
---
except the weapons are balanced around the operators that use them, so recycling weapons inherently makes balancing weapons harder
---
it would be very easy for them to quickly make adjustments to weapons to rebalance them but they dont... hmm... I bet the reason has *something* to do with the actual reason they're not adding new weapons in the first place ü§î
---
Well I'm glad I'm not appetizing to you
---
They aren't selling any single item for a "few hundred dollars". You can buy loot boxes to hopefully get the axe for Bloodhound, and they say it can c ost you $170. That's not a few hundred, it's not even a couple hundred.
---
From the videos with the new operators, the rework is mostly the same as Kafe, they didn't change it like Hereford but they also made a couple changes. I was pretty critical of the Kafe rework when I first seen it considering what they did to my favorite map, but I actually like it, and I'm feeling pretty good about the Kanal rework.
---
I cant believe they removed Theme Park and Fortress and not Skycraper and Chalet, the most unbalanced maps
---
‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢
---
So don't play it, it doesn't change casual at all. Why do you care that they added it of you can ignore it, it didn't take anything away. Do you think they decreased casual map pool because of it?
---
It‚Äôs a pretty easy attack in comparison to Hereford, Kafe, Chalet,
---
*Glock would like a word*
---
I‚Äôm Plat 1.
---
The survivor looks interesting
---
It looks like these new operators are getting guns so I don't see where your argument comes from they're still getting guns
---
it takes fucking nothing from the players. free players get stuff from this, from the free track! if you don't want to buy the pass then fucking don't!
---
He was never meant to have impacts.  While in development, the most recent deplorable shield glitch came to be and they knew they couldn‚Äôt release him with only one secondary gadget so they tossed in impacts and said he would receive his shield at a later date.
---
Zofia or Kaid
---
Well then I'm a 5000
---
It‚Äôs all about the engine and servers. Two completely different games and companies.
---
I'm not saying it's a balanced map. I'm saying it's way more balanced and easier to attack than Theme Park. Attacking Theme Park is quite limited and it's whole design just doesn't work in a game like siege. It's the same with fortress too. Fortress is a terrible map that is really hard to attack. Skyscraper is much easier to attack. For example let's take karaoke/tea vs drug. Drug you have the window, restroom, hatch/cafe above, and the main lobby area to push into. For Karaoke/tea, you can push from terrace, geisha, either staircase, tea doorway, and both windows. Theme park and fortress are just not balanced at all.
---
Not really, the vast majority of operators only have pistols, and only 1 operator has a special secondary in this, and half of that is because she'd be grossly underpowered if she wasn't able to open up hatches from below.

They will take out maps which I won‚Äôt be able to play neither in casual or unranked. That is straight up BS.

Look at this freeloader here!
---
thats why i have ectoplasm lmao
---
Me too baby
---
I think a lot of people who say he‚Äôll be worse after his impacts are removed are forgetting that he was never meant to have them in the first place.
---
New defender looks op because the explosion lasts too long, and he has three of them. If they are blocking a route come near the rounds end the defenders will be laughing
---
Nah
---
yeah for a period of time. now it isn‚Äôt free
---
I caught that one live.

No, retard you have to get all the items for the OPTION to buy the Axe, there is no chance you dont pull it from one of the iron crown boxes. You LITERALLY have to buy evrey box to BUY the axe

Quarantine seems based off of Outbreak. I believe that Quarantine is going to greatly expand on it more that the outbreak event could so it might be promotional content too.
---
Well you don't really have to care about it..but are you really beliving that Ubisoft doesn't have the money to buy licenses ? There's plenty of guns in Ghost Recon that aren't in R6 for example...its laziness and grabbing all the money on your way out...Sure for some its no big deal..for some it is.
---
And I'm sorry if I suddenly don't get the "usual" load of content (I know new guns were never part of the season pass or promised or anything) but I still paid the same amount of money in good faith that "quality" will continue as expected I kind of feel...taken advantage of ...100 guns or not is no excuse to just "randomly" unannounced stop adding new guns...why not just copy over some Ghost Recon guns this just seems like a cashgrab / reduced dev team and if thats the case just be up front about it ..like during the panel the guy said "its another way of monetization"regarding the battlepass and im OK with that..he was honest...be honest.

I always assumed castle was needed on top floor bank, but now he'll have to be played differently.
---
What don't you love pety needy "i'm DePREseD Hahahaha" cringe coments?
---
r/Rainbow6
---
If Battlepass won't be included in season pass - R6 will be oficially most monetized game on current market
---
u/michnaj
---
So at this moment we have:
---
Renown and R6 points:
---
-skins for everything
---
-charms
---
-operators
---
Paywall:
---
-renown boosters
---
-elite sets
---
-limited time lootbox colections
---
-season pass
---
All this in game priced as AAA. Season pass is valid one year and is priced as AAA as well, providing less digital content than it should for sure.
---
And now battlepass is revealed. Yet again, only with cosmetics - but showing how tricky Ubi turned experimental tactical shooter into cash machine.
---
Don't book it as a rant, just my thoughts.
---
Nice.
---
I bought Y1-2-3 season pass but before Y4 and having 250k renown I said fuck it
---
Why the fuck they add a battle pass!?
---
I honestly could care less lol, the licensing problem makes sense too
---
Stupid sexy Thermite
---
Let me buy that battle pass probably taking to much time from them
---
i legit found a fucking camo matress and some danish wine
---
ooh some wine
---
Because every other game it was made in it was for a cash grab
---
so you're not even in Challenger League yet? I dont want be negative towards what someone else wants to do but getting to a level to compete in pro league takes a lot of time and the right connections. You will be fighting for established spots on teams that have ALREADY been competing for 3 years. Go to school but keep playing Siege. Try to get on a Challenger League team and play while you attend college. You can always take a break from going school to go play Siege if you get in pro league but it's better to finish school as quick as possible so you arent bottlenecked by it later in life. So you said you wanted feedback so my feedback is to go to school while you wait to see what happens with your pro league dream
---
Because I don't know and I wanted to see what the response was bc I was bored
---
I took a break after seeing Phantom Sight being just recycled bits of content with no new map, and it looks like my break may become permenant. This year has been extremely dissapointing content wise, and now they are adding a Battlepass for more money? The only thing keeping me interested is unranked, but thats only because ranked is unplayable with smurfs and boosters
---
Plus there would be know reason for new guns due to every form of balanced rpm, damage, and may capacity possible. Adding new guns just would be for a you to look at something different or a different bullet
---
Does anyone have an article or some written info on this?
---
Small Indy Dev
---
Why did you down vote it tho :[
---
I thought what would happen tbh
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
&gt;If the game is supposed to be based on tactical realism
---
Yeah we threw that out the window about the time we started letting operators dress up in attire that wouldn't be put of place in an installment of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. There's nothing realistic about Siege.
---
shits expensive , rather get sum G A M E R  G I R L  B A T H W A T E R
---
and the *lore*? What if they paywall the Lore! I think more people care about that stuff more than cosmetics my friend, plus I wouldn't appreciate something that's deriving from the very saturated mobile gaming market.
---
Purple - the new diamond colour, which used to be blue. 
---
Pink - Champion Rank, this is a rank newly introduced and will be available in Ember rise. This rank is for any diamond player who achieves more than 5000 mmr points. This is 500 above the 4500 threshold for achieving Diamond.
---
I play on 9 ping btw.
---
I agree to an extent, but the only option for the operator is a below par LMG and a bad shotgun, they could have used the G36C, AK-12, AR-33, V308. There are plenty of guns not highly used, not over powered, and not LMGs. Or at the very least, an AR, LMG, Shotgun option.
---
Homeless plays with a pineapple
---
Don't post useless info
---
It‚Äôs  a raging cat fetish
---
Oh c'mon let's get it to 69
---
I can see her being a pretty effective op, especially with guns that shoot live ammunition at people, It's hard for me to see an example for the volcan shields though.
---
Have you seen them show up on your twitch inventory yet? Because I haven‚Äôt gotten them, nor have I seen them in my twitch inventory and I‚Äôm kinda stressing I‚Äôm not gonna get them lol.
---
Plus its not lazy. Its smarter to put people on the dev team towards stuff thatll help the actual gameplay. Adding new guns takes time away from fixing other things.
---
Username checks out
---
I took a break after seeing Phantom Sight being just recycled bits of content with no new map, and it looks like my break just became permenant. This year has been extremely dissapointing content wise, and now they are adding a Battlepass for more money??
---
I really thought Seige was different from shooters, Rainbow Six games have always has been, that was what grabbed my attention the moment I saw it. I have been a longtime Rainbow Six player but all the recent fiascos with content and bugs, censoring everyone's game so they could get into the Chinese market, and now a Battlepass, not only has it ruined the franchise, it has killed mine and many others love of the game. 
---
If Tom Clancy could see what you have done to his creations, I guarentee you he would rise up out of his grave, walk over to your headquarters, and smack some sense into you. You took a game that created and revolutionized the tatical shooter genre and made it into a Space Alien shooting, multiplayer only, paywall cosmetic cash grab. You took something special, and because of greed, ruined it
---
To keep the best argument simple. It makes balancing OPs easier. If a new operator is over powered but share a gun with someone who is under powered, they can no longer nerf the gun because it will make an already weak OP even weaker. With unique guns there is no worry about overlap.
---
Could you tell it was a joke or not
---
??
---
Amazing anti push/intel/ez kill gadget, amazing gun, 3 speed. How.
---
The defender has plenty of counters.
---
1. Shooting it.
---
2. Playing Zofia (in the footage, it looked like Zofia got FOUR impacts), or Ash.
---
3. Anyone with grenades.
---
Also, yeah, no new guns suck. But at LEAST the guns this season aren't complete trash.
---
yeeeeeet
---
I could, but it is still annoying
---
Hello thegreekgamer42, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Welcome to Siege brother. Enjoy your stay :)
---
God I hate skyscraper so much
---
Yes. The problem in the end with the Phantom Sight operators was that they both have near useless gadgets along with questionable gun choices. 
---
If the gun was new but had the exact same stats as FMG or MPX, there still would have been as much backlash as we have right now. 
---
If both Nokk and Warden's gadget is much more impactful, they would be much in better state rather than being the second worst operators in their category.
---
He was never meant to have impacts, they said this mid TTS during Phantom Sight, bc the deployable shield glitch was still rampant so they didn‚Äôt want Warden abusing it until they fixed it. Confirmed Warden would get it back by Y4S3. As for SMG-12, someone played the demo version and said it‚Äôs recoil was buffed. Patch notes come out tomorrow so we‚Äôll see any operator buffs and nerfs then.
---
You aren‚Äôt answering. Does he or does he not make content.
---
‚Ä™Fuck them, Battlepass are for F2P games. Fuck Ubisoft for adding ANOTHER layer of payment. Already paid $80‚Ä¨ CAD for the game, $50 for each Year Pass, $20 for the Elite skins, ++++ Seasonal Skins, Bundles, Digital Content and NOW A BATTLEPASS SEPARATE FROM THE SEASON PASS. Get real.‚Ä¨
---
Yeah I knew that didn‚Äôt sound right when I typed it...   
---
thanks
---
Great news. I really hope Ubi get the gap right though, because big they don't it means nothing.
---
It's gonna have to be pretty strict in order to actually stop boosting, and I'm hoping they're making it strict and that's why they added Unranked, so friends can still play the comp ruleset.
---
But then... did you stop using Hibana because you got bored of her gun?
---
I haven‚Äôt either. I believe twitch owes me a diamond tier charm, I‚Äôll be pissed if I don‚Äôt get it.
---
Knowing every other game that has a battle pass.    
---
All of the free shit is trash. Then you have the most likely chance of ubi making you pay 10$ a season
---
That‚Äôs nice, I‚Äôm really glad they made platinum nicer, because it looked too much like silver
---
No but it would make it a little bit harder or time consuming for people to find some information. Just saying. And there are companies who would do that, so don't stay comfortable with that satire.
---
Boycott this bullshit
---
Ah, a man of quality
---
Oh
---
Wait... what?
---
Both Chalet and Skyscraper need out until they get reworked, the rest were fine as is, even Hereford.
---
Ay atleast they adding a great battle pass
---
I can't wait to clap some cheeks with the volcan shield.
---
Although I‚Äôm a twitch main, I always pick sledge when I can‚Äôt play twitch. His smg11 is fucking amazing, his l85 is a great at, and his ability is so versatile
---
I did not see this coming
---
I would make him a 2/2 and give him the MP7 (REAL Secret Service gun)
---
Well what else can I do to cure my boredom
---
Not gonna add anything?
---
The purpose is tactical realism but it isn't there
---
As a day one siege player I would like to grind for things that is not related to rank. I do that competitively whilst the battle pass sounds like a fun rewarding challenge which will give us something to do and earn renown, boosters, cosmetics and alpha packs all whilst playing. This addition may seem like it doesn't fit but it is needed in a game where clearance level does not reward you for leveling and all you get is a charm with a colour representing your rank every 3 months.
---
Also, I think twitch will be able to detonate them after a while. It seems to me that they'll consume far too much attacker utility as is.
---
That's what I call a pro gamer move
---
Yeah, I feel it will combo pretty well with maestros evil eye!
---
It looks like chicken calvary!
---
Yeah, the weapons licensing is getting to be too expensive for this game that brought in over [$1 Billion a year.](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/65958/rainbow-six-siege-makes-over-1-billion/index.html) ^(/s)
---
Play a game or go on a different sub
---
I think the volcan shield will run the most terror in silver tbh lol. At like plat elo I can‚Äôt think of one good site that‚Äôs worth blocking a doorway with that shield.
---
10 dollars? more like 50 considering all the event packs we get
---
This shouldnt launch in a premium version until year 5. It looks kind of shitty to have a season pass then launch a new pass in the middle of it.
---
Cant comment more on it because not much was revealed, but I can definitely see why people aren't excited about this announcement.
---
pretty sure you can get a booster in the free pass. its all cosmetics anyways.
---
Your probably bad.
---
Played it today in Raleigh and man is it a game changer.  The new shields are great though, basically like mini mira windows.
---
With Homeless's community controller series being what it is, we're probably about 2 months from him playing ranked with a WeVibe.
---
Can you earn the same rewards on the free track as the paid/premium track? Is there any different like slower rewards, etc?
---
Clean up on  aisle 5 ‚ö†Ô∏è
---
I just want to get everyone‚Äôs general feeling about them!
---
He was in a creators cup, just for fun matches
---
This probably go just as fast as the Chinese changes. Ubi cannot stick to a unpopular stance for too long.
---
Besides elite skins, yeah. And of course the ones you can only get in alpha packs, which of course you can also buy with renown.
---
And then Godly sweats his ass off and fast jiggle peeks him like a nerd.
---
same they owe me one as well
---
I wont lie, I enjoy maestro a lot. I also use the baliff .410 to open walls for my evil eye to cover multiple entrances. Warden needs a ton of work, right now he is like tachanka without the fun part (entirely situational)
---
Nokk is literally worse than recruit for 2/3rds of a round.
---
That 1/3rd is when you're getting maxium use out of her gadget but let's be honest, when was the last time anyone got maxium value out of it.
---
The Recruits gets access to primary weapons that shoot real live bullets, not popcorn or staples.
---
I think this goes the same for the Phantom Sight operators. Not only they have very underwhelming gadgets, the guns they received just are not good enough to be justified in having them.
---
The reload animation for the MPX is different on Warden. If so, you would be satisfied if the new operators has new reload animations using the same weapon?
---
Regarding your balancing argument, they can just swap to another old weapon for balancing, it doesn't have to be new does it?
---
how do i check my twitch inventory
---
They should add at least one new weapon per season per operator but pad out the rest with reused weapons. Many guns in the game different variants that have been used with different stats and a slightly different look sort of like how the MP5 is in this game. 
---
You have three different variants all performing slightly differently. They could do this with many weapons in this game. Find variants that maybe turn DMRs into full auto, or Lock a weapon like the FAMAS into a 3 burst etc. 
---
They could also just create variants by kitting our specific weapons with specific attachments, as many weapons are compatible with many attachments. Why not give an operator the 417 dmr which has a larger magazine size, is integrally suppressed and has an angled grip. 
---
For example, the P90 has a real life variant called the PS90 which turns it into a semi automatic carbine. Would perform different with a simple slight visual modification. 
---
Also there are many weapons that could spurt more variants of the same weapon. For example, the Galil has several variants and could be used on its own. Same with a standard TAR. AR15 has many variants etc. 
---
This is what I mean. It is still very possible. They could and should reduce it to 1 new weapon per new operator while other weapons pad out the rest. It can be and should be done
---
Even the next closest in-universe franchise (*Ghost Recon*) has some weapons that aren't yet in *Siege*.

Nah I support this. The community has spoken and we dislike the idea of predatory microstransactions and battle passes. We already have season passes. Plus This game is unconventional in so many ways, it started thst way too and it's a shame it's following bad mainstream business practices for the sake of some extra money. I disliked it for good reason.
---
But that's the thing. Its free. Free stuff cant really be expected to be good. Plus, nobody is "making" you buy the premium.

I'm dumb why does this matter

My only hope is both operators getting massive buffs soon. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there will be anything for now.

Both operators are massively flawed and have no reason to be picked over the others. With the new operators incoming, these two will be quickly forgotten and join Tachanka.

You can cancel jackals track with cav making it worthless

Can you read? I didn‚Äôt say anything about not hearing her. I said if she‚Äôs only busting through the window that is not enough time for you to turn at her if she‚Äôs already in the building aiming at you. Fucking know it all

---
Not sure why everyone is freaking out. It's literally just cosmetics. Why would they include this with the season pass? The season pass gives you perks outside of just getting the ops early. There is no reason to buy the season pass unless you want those benefits. I don't see why they can't be two separate things. $10 for a battle pass and $30 for your season pass. It's on you if you want either of them. I am fine with purchasing them both separately. Asking to have both included into one package is a little ridiculous. You're asking for a free battle pass every season? Not going to happen. I would like to see a discount on the BP if you own the season pass. Asking for it to be included is far fetched.
---
That excuse is complete crap. They dodged the licensing from HK when they made Jager's HK416 (416-C in game), and Twitch's HK-417.
---
That, and a lot of the weapons in game don't use their official names. A lot of them are military designations, which afaik, don't need licensing.
---
please link me to the article or video where a Ubisoft official working for rainbow six siege said that the free pass only has skins or "something" and that the premium is the only one with "cool stuff" you my friend have the exact same problem with your argument as the gentleman above
---
&gt;  There's nothing realistic about Siege.
---
Which is an **EXCELLENT** thing as long as both the players and Ubisoft understand that. In any competitive game, gameplay must always be the first priority. Things being realistic should only be taken into account if its convenient to do so. The more realism you go for while forsaking gameplay elements, the worse the game is. Have things be realistic only if it makes no difference, or is a positive influence on the gameplay itself.
---
I wanna go watch this man now
---
One of the best pistols hands down. It just feels so good.
---
Sadly it's overshadowed by the other secondary in most cases.
---
Does he just that helmet for when he needs to take his shitposting into maximum overdrive?
---
Outbreak packs when she came out. Had some nice headgears
---
Amaru should have the Super Shorty. Better sound and it's a newer gun... sort of.
---
Jackal's PDW9 would have been much better for her loadout because she is a fast entry fragger and this little SMG would fit perfectly into that role. Or the G36C from Ash. I really hope we'll see another operator with the G36C because it is so rarely used due to the fact that the R4C is in any way better than the G36C.
---
Ooh, I like that.
---
Epic meme, my friend
---
Now. When is we getting those event charms for watching X amount of hours. I need my Diamond :D
---
Because Ubisoft has now taken his chance to earn cosmetics via renown or direct purchase and put them behind a grindy pay wall. It‚Äôs not optional at all. There is only one way to get them. Fuck off with this don‚Äôt want it don‚Äôt buy it bullshit. Normalizing this type of greed is what‚Äôs ruining this industry. Ubisoft is already predatory as fuck with their cash only gambling loot boxes. It‚Äôs flat out greed. And it ruins games, compare Year 1s mtx practice to this years. It‚Äôs vastly different.
---
3 Speed Attackers crouch walking is as sneaky as Nokk and they all have much better weapons and utility for the team to benefit from. 
---
Nokk has zero utility and there's no reason to pick her over Ash or IQ who are superior in every way.
---
While I mostly agree that the cost of licensing guns isn't a very good reason for not introducing new ones, they aren't bringing in a billion a year lol
---
I always hated the smg because it felt too hard to handle.
---
That's wild a business is trying to make as much money as possible, crazy world
---
if you use your ears you'll have time to aim at the window. she can't even have her weapon out until she's in the building so you have plenty of time to react
---
He shot you?
---
Yeah, I didn't start playing in outbreak so I had no idea that existed. Super spooky when I saw that lmao
---
It goes live on the test server tomorrow.
---
Oh my guy, you want to talk about damage on the balif? I once got into a lobby (cas) where a 6 y/o child was screaming into their mic, I decided to be toxic, walked up to him, as close as I could get, and shot him in the face with my balif, he then killed me (I expected it to be a headshot, stupid me this is r6) and he only had 60 hp. 60.
---
Umm as a firearms enthusiast, there is NOT a limit to how many weapons they can license or legally use in the game because as EA has been doing for 6 years now, you don't actually have to pay for or license any guns as long as you're not using the exact company designation. If you call the likeness by any other name it's not worth the legal recourse for gun manufacturers. Again as displayed by EA over the past six years during which they have licensed a single weapon in any of their games, but used the likeness all the same.
---
I literally linked the article

---
Yea it might be hard if you have not got much experience with a keyboard and mouse but otherwise it is so much easier to aim. Also it is probably a bit worse on PC because you get a lot of hackers. The worst part is when you beat a team and one of them was hacking without you knowing and the next day you log on and it says you have lost 80 elo... Yikes.

Wtf why would u ever use such a monster of a gun

The only maps need removing rn are theme park and skyscraper.  Other maps are fine.

That happened to me today too I was pissed

As a mainly casual player, I love still getting to play tower. It really belongs in ranked.
---
The first mute headgear that actually looks decent????
---
Battle pass in Apex isn't a grind at all. Super easy to level with challenges that don't make you go out of your way of normal play. And having exclusives is how you generate hype and make people log into the game check out the BP or event and spend some money. They are business and need to make money on the back end. yes some cosmetics are over priced, but compared to most games rainbow has the best online shop across the board by far.
---
Fortress is nowhere near as bad as Sky. Take them both out for gods sake
---
Nobody uses the supernova so I can see why they want to reuse it and g8 has a super slow ads speed but at least they added the angled grip for it
---
At least they‚Äôre being upfront and saying that it‚Äôs a new way for monetization.

Just give her a god damn assault rifle. I also agreed on Epi's point but at least use popular guns. Just use MP7 instead of Vector. I love vector but it's mag is too small for many situations.

Nah I really agree with the hereford remove. But I just hate sky for the runouts and them for the just plain bad layout. And Hereford for be just bad.
---
Bruh, they gave a modern Counter-Terrorist operator a fucking AMELI, the gun that the Spanish military was literally having men throw away for 30 year old MGs anytime they go the chance when it was brand new. And it's widely considered the best LMG in the game. Ubi doesn't give a fuck.
---
People did mention it for awhile actually. Whenever Nokk gets yellow glitching lines around her screen means that none of her gadget aspect is working (showing blurry image on enemy cams and her footstep just being loud overall). 
---
If her gadget worked while she's running, Nokk would actually be in much better place since since can't run without making noise or show up on cams. 
---
Why do you think she's the second worst Attacker according to Ubi's own data?
---

Are we copy pasta-ing on the sub now too?

---
actually I think the shield isnt gonna change his pick rate. seeing how he can use it and see through the shield it'll help a lot with people who will smoke and plant since he doesnt have to move to a defensive position when he can use the shield to always be in it.
---
I still can't believe how ugly they made the new operator xD like it sticks out soooo much. 
---
I'm not asking for a Thnap Sot but still... What's wrong with looking like Ash ? &gt;&lt;
---
I honestly prefer the alpha pack it may be a roulette but at least its a roulette where your chance of getting it actually rises and the mystery of wat you're going to get is also a bonus for me
---
You get a STANAG, you get a STANAG, everyone gets STANAG PATTERN MAGWELLLS!!!
---
You have to learn how to stop pushes when roaming. You can do the same thing with Mozzie; if you save your gadget, you can stop from getting droned out when roaming. And Ela, you can stop them from pushing you when you're roaming. She works well anchoring and roaming.
---
Her Scorpion isn't bad if you slap compensator on it. The recoil is almost completely vertical. There is some horizontal still, but its not too different from someone like Buck. If you are using 20+ rounds for a kill then that becomes the issue. The recoil gets more spastic the more bullets you put down. You should only need a few since you just need to aim in their general direction of the head and its an easy kill. I'd much rather have her the way she is now than see her get buffed. Remember her release? Even now, she's a very deadly op in the right hands. She's not the typical Jager or Bandit fragging defender.
---
My personal dislike for this is that I don't like this concept of monetization. I want to be able to buy what I want when I want, not grind through stuff I don't want to get to the real stuff I want. And maybe their analytics show that this will benefit them better but I won't support it. And ppl have the right to not support it and dislike it.
---
While I do appreciate the new pew pew noises I have to agree that I‚Äôd rather have more useful gadgets, they don‚Äôt all have to be overbearing but it‚Äôs not hard to realize that a gadget that can be made obsolete by looking away from flashes is gonna be bad

What about weapons that Ubisoft already has licensed? In The Division 2 there is the F2000, and that gun sure as hell isn‚Äôt in Siege. Same with the FAL, the ACR, the SIG-716 and the M60 just to make a few.
---
If Ubi is willing that is. Clash took forever before she got SMG buff and other small adjustments despite having LOWER win rate than Tachanka, making her the first Defender with lower stat than the The Lord Meme himself.

Hello phoenixplum, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Ngl he really plays like a casual tryhard most of the time
---
No I mean I like the maps I‚Äôm just glad they removed them cuz I never ever did good on them
---
&gt; also I'm not sure i would call it large amounts of money fortnite for example costs 13ca
---
I said large amount of money for people who can‚Äôt play a lot. Aka spending money to gain levels. It‚Äôs almost always closer to 100 dollars.
---
&gt;so i would not criticize something you know so very little about.
---
Why? It‚Äôs Ubisoft. The same Ubisoft that lowered exp and resource gain so they could sell it to players in Assassins Creed then when players used their creation tools to work around that banned it cause it ‚Äúruined to progression‚Äù. They‚Äôre nothing but a greedy company looking to exploit players for as much money possible. They‚Äôre most certainly going to make this as grindy and expensive as they think they can get away with. It ain‚Äôt rocket science. They put hundred dollar cash only loot boxes in a paid AAA game. No over publisher has had the balls to do that.
---
I'm kinda upset that the same operators keep getting PL skins, the operators that mostly have a lot of cosmetics already
---
But if the window isn‚Äôt breaking till she reaches it she will be touched down at the same time that you turn. And you really wanna rely on sound in siege? Really?
---
The p229 is Hibana and Echos pistol actually

Jesus christ is it dying?

New? Theyve been lame ever since they started allowing Hawaiian shirt patterns on to gun, which was basically since the beginning.

for the people saying its a useless hatch i should have explained if i have a friend on with me we go get hatch and then we try to defend the hatch i do this in casual btw
---
It does effect you. You can‚Äôt buy things you originally could. You simply don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs not the same as not effecting you.
---
I think they should have a balanced lighting for all maps bc I cant stand rapelling on a window on coastline and the room being dark to see people but on other maps its the opposite
---
It's for more money and more bugs
---
Also the guns available are all very similar in their own categories. Outside of aesthetic if we keep adding new guns they‚Äôre all going to feel the same.
---
Yes i saw that amaru has iq‚Äôs lmg and was disappointed then i started using it and loved it and especially when there is going to be an angled grip
---
They Brexit-ed the sh*t out of the game.
---
You never know, I‚Äôve done stupid things before and made it work.
---
Hahaha I remember you were the guy complaining about the reused weapons at the beginning of Phantom Sight. Pretty hilarious for you to turn around and call the community "ungrateful". You were the guy accusing anyone vaguely supportive of Ubisoft of being a paid shill.
---
*They said it could not be done........*
---
I guess i go for headshots so high rof and low recoil matter more to me than body shot damage.
---
I wish someone else could get Jackals C7E so I can use it in ranked :‚Äô(

Pretty sure it is, been around since she came out though so who knows lol. Only works if you‚Äôve got everyone on comms.

You could jost reinforce a hatch that works too

Hello heychuck93, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Hello SpaceRangerGG,
---
this stuff is dumb. i like ranked how it is
---
Or, you fucking rush the cunts with the SMG-12 after a call, because that works, and people are way too stupid.
---
That‚Äôs a very good point. Didn‚Äôt think about that not being included with the year pass.
---
Don't make me get nostalgic my guy
---
Just seems like you're only thinking of yourself.  Like I said in another comment, I've always hated shields but since I've gotten much better I'm much, much less bothered by them.  That really shows how OP they are in lower ranks imo, and you do see them used in a very toxic way in lower ranks.  As long as the shields have, well, shields then I don't think they're really gonna lose what they're good for in higher ranks.  It's easy to just say "get better" but a good game should be fun at all levels.
---
What your saying makes sense but it all really comes down to how they implement it. For me preferably like fortnite where some of the really good stuff us early on
---
But it's less content map/operator wise shouldn't it be cheaper?
---
Yeah, but I think the kapkan trap would be really easy to spot from below
---
Wtf are they trying to do that they can‚Äôt do in casual ? Lol
---
Not a big fan of the battle pass
---
I suppose you're right
---
Money Shredder for me, Money Printer for Ubisoft. Greed and MTX really got the better of them. I have never seen any game so heavily monetized. Most companies leave it at one monetization tactic. Ubisoft... uses all of them. And I don't know why the community isn't more outraged about this.
---
Hello InnocentPath, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
I think it‚Äôs a good idea, and unlike what the other guy said, I think hipfire leaning is definitely necessary could make the game better on console. Have an updoot
---
It looks like it fits the jungle/temple theme of this new season
---
I noticed that too, apparently dokkaebi is getting frags as well
---
I mean, they got what was advertised and paid for, so if they don't get it, boohoo. You were never told you were. But at the same time having a little extra incentive to make buying the pass worth it, especially when the quality of ops have gone down, since they haven't been getting new weapons (which I understand is for balance reasons but even the feel of playing someone with different guns is a large part of playing a new op) so having something new to balance that out would be nice.
---
So you‚Äôre telling me I never have to play casual again? :D
---
Yes it does
---
The game is heading into its 4th year, how the fuck do most of you expect them to keep funding the game, do most of you even understand business. It's really simple, this game has to make money to continue to be supported and have a thriving proleague
---
You really think the devs wanted these things lol? It‚Äôs the higher ups at Ubisoft. And removing a way for everyone to get some cosmetics and forcing it into a new method is not optional.
---
I wish kapkan traps still killed
---
What do you even do with him? I can never find a use for his gadget in 99% of games
---
r/whoosh
---
Mr Homeless?
---
on rainbow six siege's official discord, i asked people what they thought everybody hated it. the announcment trailer has 7k dislikes compared to its like 3.6 like or something like that. they clearly made as a quick cash grab of all the fortnite babys who caught word that "battle pass on game? me play game" and thats not all bad, it means the community grows and expand but its still just a cash grab
---
Yet many companies don't care as long as it's not a 100% copy because it would be too much of a hassle to sue against that.
---
Glock is different, they seem to be very aggressive like I already said.
---
Don't worry love, the cavalry is here.
---
Look, Ubisoft can't pay for servers as is, clearly they are in financial trouble and are soon closing down if the battle pass doesn't work out.  
---
  
---
/s
---
They would normally just be on the roof with the defuser then when everyone died they would just hop off.
---
Ela is my main pick if I need to tryhard in ranked. I'm not sure what the 'diamond' or whatever is, but its not stopping me from landing headshots from considerable distances. She also can kill multiple people with one magazine as she has no shortage of bullets. Her recoil is not hard to control once you learn it. Getting tagged by her gadget is basically a free kill. 
---
If you're legit staying still and waiting them to get an angle on you; then thats not a problem with the character. She is 3 speed, she can peek and move to cover or wherever without any issue. And if they push you, you will win that firefight. I personally think the Scorpion is one of the best guns on defense rivaled with the Vector, T-5, Commando, Roni, Mx4, and SMG11. Compensator won't make the first few rounds (which are the most important ones) have hardly any horizontal recoil.
---
Whats epic about this??
---
He has a shotgun to make rotations
---
&gt;What the fuck more do you want?
---
More. Ofc they're never going to be like 'eh, we're making enough money'.. that's not how business works.
---
Siege has one of the best systems in all of AAA gaming with their micro transactions. We get all DLC for free, only have to pay for select purely cosmetic items.
---
Go play a game like CoD where you have to buy access to new DLC maps, guns, etc and you will realize how spoiled we are with Siege.
---
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the dick I was talking about.‚Äù
---
Those guys have a shitstorm on their hands right now.
---
Personally I‚Äôm still not happy. They could have got selected more guns from Far Cry and Ghost Recon Wildlands
---
I agree with this
---
Wow you actually took the time and you actually think I care there is literally hundreds of comments on here I can't keep up
---
I meant like the 1% of the siege community. Like people who play to have fun and not dump on coppers
---
Wait battle pass...?
---
literally Anthem is less greedy and its published by EA, come on ubi, battle passes only work for F2P games or games with no Season pass, you guys are killing your own game (although this season has been as absolute shitshow and ive only played to get seasonal bundles)
---
They might not want to do it, or maybe when they made the statement 2 years ago it wasnt an idea they had thought of. But there are plenty of other games that use the same kind of systems.
---
Never ever J√§ger shield glitch üòÅ
---
I played new Kanal at the major and it was pretty good. I would do a few more things before it goes into ranked but I certainly think it‚Äôs a better alternative to Hereford, Fortress, and Theme Park.
---
So stupid
---
Blues are always shit
---
The reason why they are recycling weapons, is that it costs too much to get the licenses for them. It makes more economical sense for them to reuse under picked weapons and bring them back with a slight upgrade than pay more money for other guns.  Most new weapons are only used by one, maybe two operators.
---
Ya same here why is no one talking about this!

Cheaters and mnk users rank
---
You're literally getting annoyed at something you just speculated from your own opinion. if you're gonna complain about something at least wait for it to actually be true. More revenue from this battle pass means more time able to spend making the cosmetics, there's no reason they would cut back on the already existing bundle revenue stream since whales buy that shit up. This is just more cosmetics, not the same amount put somewhere else.
---
as a Frost main I DO NOT WANT OR NEED THE BULLETPROOF CAMERA. As for the shield yes I am very happy to have that back but I would love barbed wire or impacts as an alternative
---
Well include pulse and castle
---
Doc and Rook
---
And the Lord and kapkan
---
Copying weapons has been in the game since it launched
---
Then don't give them op guns
---
Maybe. My guess is someone was lagging
---
Yeah but that doesn't mean every other gun company that isn't in the game can be done and maybe there's a time frame maybe that's why we didn't get it with Nook
---
I'm excited because I play a lot and itll be nice to work towards something. But I think they need to compromise with the community and either include it in the season pass or stop doing paid loot boxes for events.
---
Maybe if they carry over everything else and update it. It's gonna suck for those on current gen but Siege has to evolve or it will die.
---
SMG 11 is on fire shield dude and I think the ITA12S is on the grappler lady.
---
Classic reddit mob mentality downvoting. "Oh this guy downvoted, I guess I should too"
---
I really do hope so
---
I think this really depends on the type of player you are to be honest. For example, competitive players use impacts on Smoke quite a bit for impact tricking &amp; likewise Maestro's shield was picked a lot for creating long angles (such as top floor Kafe) - so these are going to change Pro League lineups a little. Fortunately both Smoke and Maestro are often picked, so they've kind of switched gadgets if you will.
---
Yeah but now they're in the game and now they can be changed
---
What the actual fuck?
---
All i can say is this is simply lazy and unnervingly bold of you guys to come up that excuse.
---
But I was willing to understand if you guys added ONE single new gun to the mix. You guys never did.
---
Now you guys are announcing there is another season without new map or new gun. Remake of the maps were announced years ago while mobile shield change was shown and done work almost  6 months ago. So all you guys did add as a NEW CONTENT is the gadgets and the character models. 
---
Again, I was willing to understand all this since gadgets look useful this time (yes I am talking about warden). 
---
Now youre asking people to spend another 20-30$ on some stupid battlepass that will give you crap cosmetics, on a 4 year old game with loyal players, on top of 40-50$ season pass??? 
---
Am I the only one just lost it watching the battlepass thing? I remember this game was close to dying off back in 2016 but amazing season updates and loyal community kept on buying 50$ season passes to keep it alive. Compare to that, this is just sad and shameful.

I always had small pride in me knowing that I was part of a old group community who kept supporting the dying, hacker plagued, buggy game into full fledge, one of the best and unique shooters of 2010s, and was more than happy to give 50$ to keep on supporting, and tell my friends to try the game over and over again saying this game cares about the game and its community compare to most AAA fps games.
---
Shame on you ubisoft.
---
I see
---
first of all, read my comment above. also you cant turn down a free battle pass, it becomes part of the game.
---
Was coopers a typo?
---
duel wield :D
---
Don't worry the truth is out there somewhere
---
Contact Ubi support
---
I actually like the idea, people just don‚Äôt like it bc it has to do with Fortnite
---
They‚Äôre already easy to spot. I don‚Äôt think it would change much.
---
I guess so
---
say sike right now
---
No.
---
No
---
Re read the comment bud
---
Ubisoft tries bot to screw with rainbow because it's doing really good right now. Given the reasoning for the battle pass (repeatability and continued play) doesn't seem like ubi is being to greedy
---
But you're missing the point she can be balanced just give her a different gun
---
sure,if we get leaver penalties in casual.
---
if we don't, and have don't koin ongoing matches..cas will be even more of a joke than it is.
---
Its not less content. Maps are free. Ops are unlockable in game. Nothing forces you to buy a r6 season pass.
---
Correct, however those are their secondaries. The defender has access to the TSG and Vector, both are extremely good guns. The Grappler has Iq‚Äôs LMG with an angled grip, the gun is very good however the ADS time sucks, so the addition of the angled grip should really help.
---
Upvoted because of flair
---
That gun is amazeballz
---
I guess they never miss huh
---
1. Cut out of the drone footage next time

I don‚Äôt really even like tux anymore. I stopped watching him a few seasons back
---
I feel like she'll be great for casual, but banned quite a bit in ranked
---
What's wrong with chalet, personally it's in my top 5
---
what are you even talking about.
---
it's no mega from thread
---
She ain't new.
---
I‚Äôm thinking his gadget should work similar to jackals gadget. When pressing the primary gadget button, wardens glasses should stay on, but you could counter him by either using twitches drone and stunning him to disable his glasses or throwing a emp grenade at him and having it disabled for a short period time.
---
If that also doesn‚Äôt work, I love read from a another post (can‚Äôt remember which one to be particular and can‚Äôt remember who posted it) but make it similar to rooks armour plates. You drop down a set of glasses for your whole team to use. I find this maybe a bit too strong, but I‚Äôm just throwing suggestions out.
---
That‚Äôs hours of grinding a lot of people don‚Äôt have
---
Some solid band
---
2/10 because you took the time to use apostrophes.
---
I imagine when standing next to the shield you could shoot the kapkan trap? though maybe in the demonstration video they placed it too high...
---
It's true
---
But not the name
---
Wait what maps did they remove in Casual? I hope it's Favela and Yacht
---
Auto correct automatically puts those fuckers there
---
OHHHH damn I forgot one was gone
---
Legit was in ubi's reveal trailer
---
Pretty obvious for someone with a normal IQ.
---
So long as Bartlett continues to be in the game files, the data limits excuse is just an excuse for laziness and not wanting to put the work in
---
this is partly why i want input based cross-play 
---
doing this would also force them to address the issues on console versions
---
If people will hate the battle pass . Then let them stick with the 1 alpha pack every 6 or 8 matches . useless leveling up . Expensive event packs .
---
Automatically put there by auto correct
---
Skyscraper is bad, but its no Hereford, i mean yeah its frustrating , but once you get inside the map, its a great map.
---
ya that's what this entire thread is about.
---
The reveal was earlier today
---
The battlepass discussion is honestly dumb. People are overreacting to one OPTIONAL micro transaction that isn't even released yet. They have time to tinker around with what the battlepass contains and how it even works. But it's not Reddit without have massive hate-boners when they see a fucking battlepass. It's not like they're going to recode the entire game so that it's mandatory for players to buy the battlepass or they don't play the game.
---
Why would you use Acog a long range scope on the fmg? It's a medium/short range gun, so it makes sense. Its damage drop off is very high in range and acog + medium range gun makes no sense.
---
I wish people would stop filling this subreddit with generic bitching
---
Did they take his smokes or his claymore?
---
Oh shit, it was the other gun, right?   
---
I keep getting them mixed up (Remember the name, and that's it), and I can't go to the wiki atm =))   
---
Yeah, now I sounds like an idiot lol
---
&gt; Battle passes are chances for people who play the game a lot to pay upfront and then progress towards getting skins. If you like having skins, they are almost always a good deal.
---
Except we already had that. Renown. And it was free.
---
&gt; It's not greedy to look for long term monetization of something you are continually updating
---
But let‚Äôs ignore the season pass, cash only elite skins and cosmetic bundles, expensive cash only gambling events. Yeah. Not greedy to tack on ANOTHER money demanding feature to a paid title.
---
&gt; Loot boxes are bad and a different story. But those are GIVEN TO YOU AND FREE TO OPEN, so really who cares anyway (for this game)?
---
Event packs aren‚Äôt free buddy.
---
&gt; Not having cosmetics won't negatively affect your game experience
---
It will cause now more cosmetics are pay walled.
---
Lmao and what are u doing rn dumbass
---
The map is good and so are the operators gadgets the recycled guns are ass but the loadouds seem to fit them well. The battle pass is a downside to the season but is also a completely optional feature. The addition of a new rank is sort of cool and fun. Also the new unranked game mode is a breath of fresh air for those who don‚Äôt like to play favela or plane every five seconds.
---
If you constantly try to map a 1:1 ratio for "content vs dollar amount" for everything you purchase you should probably just stop participating in transactions
---
Huh, I've never known those things except that Echo dated Ying
---
Ok... they still give you a completely free way of getting them. You don‚Äôt have to spend a dime on anything in this game. You get free cosmetics. Free operators. Free maps.

The opposite happened to me, I‚Äôm a Au player went into a game and carried my team against a team of all silvers and a plat. We beat them 4-1 and I went 14:2. I posted a screenshot of it earlier
---
a headgear they can sell in China and the rest of the world
---
Eh, we have no reason to believe they won't add new animations. People like to call ubi lazy for reusing guns, but these are the same people who constantly bitched about the info meta, the smoke/flash meta, and unbalanced/unfun maps that need to be reworked i.e. kafe, kanal, and meme park. The simple fact of the matter is that ubi isn't lazy, they're making positive changes to almost every aspect of the game. Phantom sight brought RFF, ranked playlist changes, clarity changes with intel gadgets, and sweeping QOL changes across the board, even ignoring the 2 "recycled" ops and the map rework.   
---
Really, people just like to complain. They like to complain when ubi puts massive effort into new and interesting guns at the cost of developing the game's infrastructure, they complain when ubi develops new maps instead of fixing old ones, they complain when ubi develops the game's infrastructure instead of new maps, they complain when ubi fixes the old maps instead of making new ones. Ubi cannot win here.

I mean he‚Äôs playing with a close group of friends and it sounds like you‚Äôre playing with randoms

Now this... does really does put a mile on my face.

---
hell... 2.5/10 for honesty.
---
Since when is valk a dude
---
Well, yeah. But, even something like a c4 lob, gets a huuuge reaction, it seems extra.
---
AGREED
---
i‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre saying because you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre even talking about. the size of the game has absolutely nothing to do with anything. GTA and Siege run on completely different engines. that‚Äôs what makes the difference. it‚Äôs not that hard to understand
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean much if there isn‚Äôt a market for it.  Like I said these don‚Äôt sell well at all where I‚Äôm at so my guess could be way off
---
Could have it be like burnt horizon where the last seasonal comes in closer to the end of the season
---
Seriously though. I'm fine with them reusing guns. I'm fine with there being a Battlepass. I play RS6 enough that this gives me more reasons to play. I am one of those people that try and do all the weekly challenges.
---
 I'm more worried about the more toxic side of the community then Ubisoft throwing in something that I'm going to play anyways.
---
GREG STOP JACKING OFF TO ANIME GIRLS

What was that frost doing?!?
---
I have 1100 hours in this game and I didn't need to spend a single penny over the ¬£12 I initially paid. So yes, I am perfectly okay with paying for all this. Like, we all pay an upwards of ¬£10 to watch a movie for a couple hours just to forget about it the next morning.
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question ut how do you put those lil' icons and mains next to your user?
---
Leads his team to win 3 majors in a row and loses in the final of the 4th and people starts to criticize him, he is not an entry fragger, his job isn't being the top fragger, they lost as a team and it wasn't the fault of a single individual.
---
It‚Äôs a show match dumbass,  try to have a life
---
The good ol "Sniper 90"
---
Exactly, but ubi doesnt listen to the community in any game so it doesnt matter if we speak up or not
---
Ubisoft: **makes a glitchy fun game and adds cool things that they spent thousands of euros and dollars on**
---
Useless nerd: *points out that ubisoft is too cheap for images even tho it could have been a tiny error and they payed for that image*
---
So far Nomad was a Sarah Jessica Parker of Siege, now she has competition. Whoever is responsible for these reworks/reskins, dude whatever you takes  cut your doses by half.
---
except they (try to) gouge you with those shitty event lootboxes that are overpriced like crazy.
---
I understand. But just edit the guns slightly, different reload, different sight color, a wraping around the front muzzel. Idk somthing to make sure i dont feel like im just the same op as another one.
---
So you're saying the difference is one of the teams is incompetent?
---
Lol. Mp5, mp5sd, P90 aka pea90 shooter, ring a bell? N√∏kk could be given any other guns, but no, she wasn't. And my point is fucking proven, she is underwhelming and overwhelmed.
---
Fair. I don't mean to seem stubborn, but it seems like its pure content farming
---
A logical and informed opinion?? No thanks, I just wanna be upset.
---
Hell if I know
---
Yeah
---
Like whoa
---
So you‚Äôre saying you want the premium track for free? Funny how you never even had a shitty charm to ‚Äústrive for‚Äù before and yet you didn‚Äôt complain about that
---
What?
---
Pretty sure most of the critical comments in here are in jest but just thought I'd explain it in for those who might jump to the "big dev stealin from the little guy" conclusion.
---
I just got Reddit what‚Äôs wrong with the post?
---
It never said you were always going to get guns it said new guns were included
---
That‚Äôs already the name of a seasonal skin
---
Guns cost money to license the likeness/name of and not get sued for if the gun company notices.
---
nobody cares what some ex east-block developer does. and i dont think big companies have it easy sueing them either.
---
Hello Hiramob, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/csbj57/hacker_in_casuals/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I feel the same way. The pistol is just more stable and accurate.
---
btw im pretty sure every gun is licensed, its like cars in sport games.
---
Idk I don‚Äôt care that much. I don‚Äôt play enough to get/appreciate cosmetics.
---
Man y'all are fucken babies fine let's stay with our random loot boxes and random timed expensive lootboxes, instead of a implemented system with free and premium options Let's bitch about it instead.
---
Good point
---
I love both those guns so i wouldnt complain
---
This isn‚Äôt the Kellen House anymore.
---
Wait wrong game.
---
Even if you know the trap is there, without destroying the shield it takes like 6 bullets to destroy the trap, hard to do that while you're in midair
---
best shotgun in the game
---
Yea like a fucking battle pass
---
Best thing you could try is to uninstall and reinstall uPlay.
---
Every day we stray closer to God
---
Little tip for that rappel, you were sitting exposed on a window, in the middle of it, visible from the entirety of white stairs. Go upside down and knock out a little of it from the top. Once you can see you‚Äôre not in immediate danger, you can enter. The barricade doesn‚Äôt have to be gone completely to enter either, just partly broken. I like to throw in a drone on particularly open window like that.
---
he's been on the roster for months, &amp; they've been scrimming with him. UUNO has been on the G2 roster for maybe 2 months. the situations aren't comparable.
---
I tried that also 2 times
---
whats bad  about a battle pass?
---
Idk man it‚Äôs just cosmetics.
---
Just look at Apex legends and the fiasco it went thru with event lootboxes an that was F2P game, this game is going for every type of avenue to monetize while being a Paid Game
---
Umm sir, I see that you dont seem to understand the fact that stock photos are created for such purpose
---
Ive coming very close to level 200 im like 23 levels away and i had a short time where every 5000 points i would just be like alpha pack time
---
Yeah he‚Äôll be fun
---
You can‚Äôt vault into that window or rappel through it so it‚Äôs a pointless placement for the welcome mat
---
I thought it was Gridlock, lmao
---
This ain't a free to play game, let that sink
---
true but the losses are less.
---
They didn‚Äôt announce it but I remember they did say they were looking into improving the report system so it‚Äôs only a matter of time until we see anything about that I guess.
---
Was really hoping for the attacker to be 3 speed. We need another 3 speed with a shotgun, Hibana is still the only one.
---
iTs JuSt CoSmEtiC
---
You forgot to put a little string on the fan to know it‚Äôs on. Also to put fear into the hearts of everyone to show how much horsepower it has.
---
Play the game complete challenges to level up the pass which in turn will reward you with cosmetics etc
---
No. Then youre gonna have trolls who can do everything else except tk and not get kicked.
---
You're wrong it actually got leaked 3 months ago 
---
https://youtu.be/Wqp1lM30Rvo

but yatatatatatatataa is heavy weapons guy...

Please tell me this is real

it is his fault, saw you aiming and ran infront of you instead of behind.
---
First of all, we need A door in siege in general.
---
There are no doors.
---
I think you only get nae nae'd for 10 karma max.
---
This why she a spook bitch
---
soon they will lower renown gain and increase operator prices, after few years they will disable buying ops with renown all together
---
Yeah but it wasn't in the reveal which means they're probably still working on it and it won't be out for another season or two =(
---
Never seen him playing Valkyrie
---
I think he just went full dive in the ocean of retardation.
---
Can I get some actual feedback? What in particular do you dislike about these? Cosmetics and attachment options have always been a part of siege, why not spice things up a bit so that the more strategic side of the community can flourish without having to have new guns. Your comment is about like saying, ‚Äúthis is a competitive game, silly abilities aren‚Äôt needed in competitive games like CSGo‚Äù 
---
I can somewhat see where you‚Äôre coming from, it may be overly complicated, but half of it is aesthetic, why is that a problem?
---
&gt; not ubisoft's servers
---
Idk if that's true or not idgaf. It's still hitting the servers so whoever owns them needs to fix their shit
---
&gt; sound design is the same
---
Yes, but on console unless you have some special hardware you cant use surround sound. 
---
&gt; camera is supposed to shake
---
Didnt say it wasnt supposed to, just that its dumb as hell
---
Okay buddy, its a season pass, not a battle pass.
---
**Big difference.**
---
I'm in this post and i don't like it
---
i get what your saying. it probably is slightly defender sided and some maps are built off of info. Skyscraper forces you to emphasize droning and cams. It is kinda like coastline in that sense. Coastline is built around one u shaped hallway on each floor. it really hard to clear areas as you go on coastline because there is so many areas peaking those hallways, you really need to drone out and get info, then pinch your enemies. Skyscraper has a similar concept.
---
If you want a trick including this mechanic:
---
In chalet, if the defenders go in kitchen and reinforce the hatch + cover it from up to avoid vertical plays, you can actually brake it from the kitchen window, unexpected move most of the time.

Look how the turn tables
---
Try the meme subreddit instead
---
first legendary for the battlepass
---
it's akin to blaming books for things.  video games are an easier one to pick on nowadays.
---
Yeah and it sucks that those things are so integral to being able to play the game 
---
Wait a sec...
---
Yeah I came back and the only person I'm subbed to now is moo. Just like that guy a lot
---
Its the model that fortnite uses they put their skins behind a pay wall than the user have to grind for the rewards of the battle pass by playing the game or buying its levels with more money. Its pretty shitty.
---
It becomes too complicate thats good idea to be in some splinter cell or ghost reacons but no in competive fps things need to stay simple cosmetics is okay
---
I saw leaked gameplay before it was officially revealed and Amaru goes through the window with Clash in front of it, but Clash flinches like she would if she was to be knifed
---
There making it so he can look in 360 degrees and he can attach his turret to sheilds
---
I would ask r/buildapc they should be able to help out
---
Okay okay let‚Äôs not be toxic, the battle pass is genuinely a good idea, let‚Äôs be honest besides ranked and a the weekly/daily challenges, the game kinda doesn‚Äôt have a constant thing to keep you playing, and for such a good game like R6, to have a battle pass, that‚Äôs in my opinion really good for the player base not losing any interest replaying
---
Is Badger spawn peeking Bohdi with a pmm dead already?
---
think mav torch works too, but same problem.
---
it doesnt fit his agenda
---
Wrong.
---
You can't customize Recruit with attachments. You have to pick guns with no bling or anything.
---
I guess they could simply make a copy of the weapon and remove the ACOG, but then the cosmetics you own on Kaid‚Äôs shotgun won‚Äôt be available on Goya‚Äôs shotgun, and vice versa.
---
I may be wrong here, but Siege‚Äôs alpha pack system is fundamentally different than other games. You cannot pay real money to purchase the packs, you just need to grind the game, so if lootboxes are made illegal I don‚Äôt thing alpha packs would fall under the definition.
---
I would never understand why they would remove maps from Casual...
---
That is actually pretty dope
---
I think it's freaking wicked. What an antihero look!
---
i dont see your point, memetubers do toxic and dumb things to entertain their audience, if you dont like it, just watch pros
---
Thank you for making this post. I only hope ubi is seeing this one, the one I posted after the reveal, and the many more coming soon so they can at least consider swapping one of the maps they're taking out for Skyscraper.
---
Skyscraper was barely competitive 3 years ago. If any map has struggled to keep up with the meta, it's definitely this one. Ubi please, don't make me play Skyscraper in your "competitive" playlist anymore.
---
so you're telling me they're making the operator icons **bigger** to accommodate there being more on the screen...?
---
&gt;Idk if that's true or not idgaf. It's still hitting the servers so whoever owns them needs to fix their shit
---
well you are complaining about *their* servers getting hit and just wanted to say its not their fault
---
&gt;Yes, but on console unless you have some special hardware you cant use surround sound
---
get a decent pair of headphones, i use Turtle Beach Sealth 700 and they work great for surround sound
---
&gt;Didnt say it wasnt supposed to, just that its dumb as hell
---
well i mean its an explosion and yeah i think your head would shake a bit too if a explosion went off near it
---
I was gonna say "how would you not know that", but that would make me an asshole
---
&gt;anarchist/communist elite set
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Is it a separate purchase from the season pass?
---
Always extended meaning can‚Äôt shoot or can shoot without folding shield?
---
An*
---
You're right, although thankfully, at the moment, this game still has one of the best, if not the best, monetization models in the AAA industry at the moment. But you're right, complacency will not be rewarded. Thus, if you don't like something, don't give them money.
---
I like trains
---
Maybe Goyo can get one since he will have access to the Dredd weapon skin.
---
Sell it in like a season or two, randomly post it asking who wants to buy it and you'll have super curious people wanting it probably
---
Bruh
---
How old is csgo?
---
No theyre actually making a battle pass like fortnite
---
I don't know what lore will be put into their battlepass but I'm sure it will be all over YouTube when it comes out.
---
The game is basically free or at the very least super cheap. They need ways to keep money coming in from it in order to justify supporting it and supporting its eSports. Battle Passes are the most ethical ways of doing it. 
---
Yes you can buy skins and things like that but I highly doubt that they get that much money off of it. They are being open and honest about it and they are using it as a way to put fluff and backstories into the game; something which has never really been there but has always had the potential.  
---
Also, The lack of new guns has been explained and, as far as I am concerned, that is a pretty weak thing to whine about.
---
Right, you mean queing with a copper if you‚Äôre a diamond? We‚Äôll have to see if they mention it in the patch notes tomorrow
---
I absolutely detest Chalet. I hate it because there‚Äôs only 2 viable bomb sites and as an attacker, you have to push the same way every round. There‚Äôs no variety. 
---
Same goes for skyscraper other than the viable sites part. There‚Äôs way too much runout potential on that map with little consequences. They make you stand out on a balcony that has abt 3 run outs no matter the site. 
---
Both are extremely frustrating to play for me. I would‚Äôve rather they kept Fortress and Theme Park (which is a map I like &amp; they‚Äôre reworking anyway) in ranked and took out Chalet and Skyscraper.
---
Let‚Äôs get down to business
---
Attackers can have full map controll and get kills just by standing outside and holding angles, while throwing utility to clear out anchors.
---
Defenders are basically screwed.
---
In skyscraper you can literally hop in and plant and get out when you kill one anchor in a room. That anchor can be killed from the outside. Same goes for Chalet.
---
That's why these two maps are bad.
---
It's the newer medium honestly. Every new thing was viewed as easy and blamed for stupid stuff. Music has gotten blamed a lot too.
---
as a graphic designer as well - I'm actually shocked they use stock images. I would have guessed all that stuff was illustrated.
---
"I have 150 rounds, dont walk in front of me"
---
Ik it‚Äôs cool to see Ubi adding little details it gives me hope that there not as lazy as we think they are üòÇ
---
You are already grinding for cosmetics, guns paintings and operators, why would you rather spend money on this shit???
---
You can pay real money for alpha packs with R6 credits, and Siege‚Äôs alpha pack system is fundamentally the exact same as other games, making them fall under the same definition.
---
If you are gonna tryhard to the point of getting pissed at someone who‚Äôs bad, casuals probably aren‚Äôt the game mode for you.
---
That would be cool, I must say I am disappointed with the animation. It's just weird to me that they bring in huge stuff like the maxim gun, or the motorcycle for bandit.
---
I love how serious his face is in this picture
---
*gets the only ace of the tournament in the finals against the current champions*
---
"idk kinda underwhelming"
---
Not at all, have a lovely day.
---
Mira‚Äôs vector on a 2speed sounds really fun ngl
---
Yes I see your point, but that's pretty much a universal agreement with the community. Ubi made Phantom Sight quite possibly one of the worst and boring seasons this game offered, still not worse than Health, but it's quite up there.
---
How
---
If I could I'd donate towards your new mic, to be generous, but also for people like this that harass you. But, unfortunately I am broke
---
Do we know how *much* you need to play for the rewards? If it three wins or seven loses or five close matches I mean its not terrible
---
And if the premium part is in the season path I really think its a nice addition (and better than the weekly challenges)
---
Thanks I will check it outüëå :)
---
I was just trying to be helpful but no I have like 800 comments bitching at me like I'm a developer I just shared something I don't know
---
ur joking
---
No operator will be good enough for you to put more hours in. You have the perfect amount of playtime
---
I don‚Äôt care for that that‚Äôs not why brought this here. I just want at least one person to give me a good reason as to why it‚Äôs so unliked to put ttv into their names. It just annoys me cause that‚Äôs the only way for my to get noticed while buried under several thousand other streamers, yknow?
---
#YOU
---
F for Hudson
---
No. Most of us just don't agree with your shit opinion
---
how about you just not opening this sub again?
---
But thank you for offering.
---
I really don't want to so have fun talking and talking into the void
---
Or just don't pay if you don't want to, it's all cosmetics anyway
---
Theres a box you can get up on and crouch on, you gotta go to the edge of it to be able to stand up and get this angle
---
Jesus Christ. Thanks for the info.
---
yeah but can they see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
---
The person who initiates the trap gets the kill, it was made abundantly clear
---
You would just see M4 variants over and over again
---
The roadmap was delayed until after I bought the season pass. Until this year there was no reason to not believe that the new operators would continue to receive new weapons.
---
I just want to consolidate my PC and console accounts. Hell, I'd even pick one over the other if I have to... I just want consistency. 
---
I hope that when the new console generation comes out, Ubi will let players transfer their player to the platform of their choice, like in GTAV and BF4. 
---
To those saying "Ubi won't make more money doing that!"... Look, most people that have bought the game twice have already done so by now. I have, and I would pay money on top of it to transfer my account, if that's what it took. So it's really a way for them to triple dip.
---
It's not really boring it's just the operators of boring the game is fine
---
I like The banana skin banana charm combo.
---
You did nothing wrong your just the messenger. (no offence)

No they didnt say it was gonna be behind a paywall, they said there would be a comic and lore in the battlepass they didnt say which tier it was locked behind but locking it behind the paid one would be stupid since it will just be uploaded here and youtube anyway
---
You are correct, you cannot buy Alpha Packs with real money. You can buy them with renown, the ingame currency, earned by playing the game. 
---
You can buy boosters with real money that increase the amount of renown you get from playing the game. This somewhat indirectly allows the purchasing of alpha packs with real money, but I wouldn't argue that it counts as such.
---
yeah it certainly looks that way
---
It seems only plats and diamonds know what maps are balanced, skyscraper and chalet are some of the most balanced maps in the game.
---
It's been like this every year since they did this season pass the guns are not a guarantee
---
See if EA can get away with it then Ubisoft can. Siege is also making them more than enough money to afford at least one new gun every season. They also have the licence for HK and could give an OP an unused HK weapon. Ubi has options they've chosen to be last and cheap
---
Your mum
---
Well people are arguing at me like I am
---
Does Russian badger have a subreddit?
---
I mean u have the whole prep phase. Its not like your are some noob whos going to roam with fmg-9 and pistol.....or are you? :)
---
Ive paid for every season pass as well and dont give a fuck so its not all about you buttercup
---
Sept 10th i think i seen
---
the dev team needs to pay bills, planning and reworking a map while adding models for it, making sure sound/gadgets/walls/windows/everything in a map works, learning from past mistakes and checking for glitch spots, etc, and even more. They need to pay bills and this doesn‚Äôt take 5 minutes to do. You try. Take old hereford, completely rework it. Add a whole map and I mean coding, models, etc. Do it. See how long it takes. Would you do that for free? No? yeah neither will the devs. You know what you get. We don‚Äôt know everything behind the scenes but it should be obvious there‚Äôs more use to the money we give them that‚Äôs not only in the game.
---
And how wouls you know all the money is spent? Do you know how to run a company? Neither do I, so we can‚Äôt say shit but the thousands or more that they make aren‚Äôt all just for the game.
---
Also, what the fuck are you talking about ‚Äòpaying them to fix team killing‚Äô? That was free ffs. Everyone got it, people who bought the year pass(like me) just want to support the game and also get the ops, special cosmetics for them, and exclusive 7 day access to the ops along the r6 credits and all that. Maps are free, operators you get by playing the game, why are people mad? Seriously. You know what you‚Äôll get. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it. If you dont want to play to get it, too bad. You are given a reason to play now and ya‚Äôll are complaining? Really? You get a bunch of stuff FREE for playing whether you want to pay or not. God damn.
---
Acog on a 2 speed won‚Äôt last long
---
There‚Äôs a battlepass in R6 now??
---
Plus we got all types of dps and stats on guns so no point in making new guns
---
ok so why cant they make more money? dont buy the battle pass if you dont want it :D
---
Operators get unlocked fairly quick and many of the camos you can buy aren‚Äôt really worth it. It becomes to a point where once you have all ops you don‚Äôt grind for camos, you gamble. Winning a match can be a gamble at times, then you have a chance to get one pack, then that pack has a chance to be a different rarity. Even then it may not be the camo you want, or for the gun you use, or it may not even be a camo at all. The battle pass is something that will guarantee you rewards as long as you play. You pay less and earn more. And people would want that since later on it‚Äôs just praying with packs and the only grinding is in ranked which is sometimes based on luck.
---
I see what you did here
---
Badger Marley and Anthony Pit. Just entertaining to watch
---
I think if he had MP5(SD?) and could move with his glasses on, he‚Äôd be good.
---
Siege, being a GaaS game, is now going super GaaS with the addition of the Battle Pass, just like every other major multiplayer game active today.
---
I wasn't talking about kills. I was talking about teamkills. That's what happens when you're too lazy to read the whole post :Dd
---
They have to make more money somehow. We will need to wait and see if its worth it.
---
its like telling fortnite not putting battle pass or other microtranscations because they already make too much money
---
Maestro losing shield? Frost with no barbed wire? I'm surprised
---
While I understand there point I still hope they add one new gun every now and then to spice things up. The new operators have pretty nice guns which doesn't make me too bummed out but last operators guns were kind of lackluster, along with Warden's boring ability
---
This somehow looks bigger than the current one to me.
---
I think it's a nice addition (its a superior weekly challenge imo) plus more lore is exactly what some players wish for
---
The name is bad, and if the premium path is mishandled they f'ed up but it really is free loot, you play the game and you get stuff, it's better than alpha packs as it's not RNG
---
I think they don't like it because they think you're just trying to get famous, which is what most streamers try to do, but I guess he finds it obnoxious, I couldn't read the small chat box so I couldn't read what everyone was saying, but all in all they don't like that ttv people try to bring attention through themselves via their username
---
&gt;But couldn't we just use fictional names for weapons if that were an issue?
---
They already do this. It's the AUG, not the Steyr AUG. The D50, not the Desert Eagle .50 caliber. The M4, not the M4A1. Etc.
---
üòã
---
It's like the RC XD in CoD Blops
---
idk about spain but if u believe that about nazi germany you should read more to see how our perception of them has been sanitized by post war activities of german generals
---
ü§î
---
You can vault through it. I‚Äôve gotten people going through the garage door below many times. People don‚Äôt expect it. Also people don‚Äôt use sound to their advantage enough
---
Would be cool if you actually saw the preview of the headgear/uniform you have equipped. At least in the menu, in game it might cause longer loading times. Would be awsome tho having it in-game aswell.
---
Hi MOM.
---
I would love to. But no link or anything (maybe because mobile)
---
This is not, has not, and will not be a thread debating Nazi germany. This is just about mira. If you and the other guy want to talk about it elsewhere, please do so.
---
Fine.
---
I guess that‚Äôs the only reason. But like what most people don‚Äôt understand is the interaction between a small streamer and their chat (if anyone happens to EVER pop in) is such s thrilling thing. Like the fact that someone decided to come by and talk or just chill and watch is awesome to people like me. But there‚Äôs not much we can do about people like that guy I suppose.
---
Fix headshots? Lmao
---
Hello OriginalUsername1892, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Castle, Kapkan and Frost.
---
they ddoss the game server.... and in most countries u can get max 10years in jail for it
---
Isn‚Äôt gridlocks saw essentially just caps m249 but with a fat m4 mag? It‚Äôs not very ‚Äúunique‚Äù but it‚Äôs new I guess
---
Haha üëªüëªüëªüëª
---
I might get gold next season, just depends on if I can get a squad or if I have to solo q
---
Am I the only one who actually likes Fortress?
---
Same rules apply , is this your first time with rainbow 6 siege?
---
2 speed acog btw
---
Damn, your sens is going through the roof
---
Say sike right now
---
Approx 5-8 giga
---
No original map or guns again? Must have used their budget on the upcoming battle pass no one wants
---
Exactly, that's one of the funnest parts of the game. Except when they have flak jacket and they don't die :(
---
Can Kaid please get his wire back please? Signed solo queue player
---
So kill stealing is considered success?
---
So its not because of a lack of space?
---
You can just make fake guns yknow noones gonna hate
---
I was once matched against a friend of mine who lived right across my room in hostel, old school siege was great fun.
---
Yeah but what if they came up with the idea after the season pass was already made, an wanted to wait till it was near ready to reveal it?
---
Kills and team kills are the same.. whoever shoots at the shield causing it to blow up will be credited with any damage dealt to enemy or teammates.
---
It don't take images
---
Why did they keep Chalet too?!
---
why does everyone talking about this act like buying a season pass is 100% required and you'll always do it forever?
---
if it's not included in the season pass....you could buy it INSTEAD of the season pass and probably pay less money. 
---
if you're buying every overpriced event skin, chances are you've either got a serious spending problem or you have enough money where 10-20$ a year isn't going to matter.
---
Quick question, does buying the elite skin automatically unlock yhe operator? If not, then why not change that Ubi, im saving to unlock kaid but i need that mira skin pretty please UBI.
---
I posted that on the 18th saying that it's already announced..and then I said it's usually tuesdays...I don't get your post
---
Sadly, nope. :c
---
Shit was toxic as fuck but funny nonetheless
---
I feel like the supernova and the smg11 is the play anyway, she is going to be slugging it out close range so why not take one of the best close range guns in the smg11, if they made it so you could just zip up to a window and not through it the lmg would be ideal imo
---
I dont get the last point... I like learning new things! Why you gotta take this, Ubi... And I really like the destinct weapon sounds.
---
It's amazing how many people can't take a joke.
---
Sorry, this is one of my favorite elite skins. Hibana's is my No.1, and this one is No.2 in my opinion.
---
Should have done thermite
---
For 3 second ahhahah
---
I don't think that trick is relevant anymore because of Kaid's electric claw
---
Watching Badger put on a chanka helmet irl and go for a spawnpeek was priceless
---
Yeah Virginity Gaming taught me a lot
---
But Bajur for the memez
---
The thing I hate about seasonal battle passes is once you have paid for the pass there is pressure on you to keep playing because it won't be there for ever
---
...on the shotgun
---
Thatcher looks polished
---
We're not talking about skins and recoil patterns, we're talking about licensing costs. Gun companies are stingy when it comes to doing business with game companies. However, I do concede that they could add fake guns like Finka's 308 Spear. 
---
Also I think everyone is forgetting that the Battle pass will still have a free pass for players who don't buy the premium pass. You're still gonna earn cosmetics like everyone else. And even then we still don't know how they're going to sell this, you might even be able to buy the pass with renown. But if it's strictly monetary, then I fully doubt they'll sell it for more than $10, like every other company that does a battle pass.
---
Have the devs visited east Russia yet
---
Like most people are saying, it is on a shotgun. Though as a counter to that argument, the shotgun uses slugs. So while it does have ACOG, it would also require skill and precision to use properly.
---
Lots of less skull faces probably because china
---
u blind or just watching the first part only
---
So Dokk &amp; Glaz get Frags. 
---
Frost gets a shield.
---
Maestro gets impacts.
---
Warden gets a shield
---
Can you shoot through that wide window like in Chalet?
---
surrounded by blind people
---
I buy just the season pass, its once a year, i don't need to grind and it pays for one elite skin
---
I don't pay for the packs, alpha or events
---
I just mean that adding more monetization on top of everything is in poor taste, I love the idea of a better weekly challenge set that gives you actual loot and lore, I think it will be popular, and I meant its a misstep only if they make it an overpriced standalone purchase
---
what, your shield not physically there when you're switching it in and out?
---
Why did they make cav so ulgy without the makeup ,shes the hottest operator.
---
You even watching where the person is aiming at?
---
You log in and they will be in your inventory 
---
Can take a few days 
---
Don‚Äôt worry 
---
You‚Äôll get them.
---
I think I speak for a large amount of the community when I say that I literally could not care less if they copy pasted recoil patterns, sounds, etc to new weapons if it meant we got a "new" gun instead of re-using old ones.
---
All I‚Äôm getting at is why add fictional guns when there are plenty of real guns they could add and just change the name for copyright reason. Galil, acr, mtar, arx 160, scar L, f2000, and many more kalahnikov platform rifles just to name a few are some they could easily add to attackers. Aks 74u or other sbr kalashnikov platform rifles, uzi or micro uzi, or many other sbr variants of other rifles in game could be added for defenders. Why add fictional guns when there are countless real world weapons that could still be added?
---
Do you not see the shield blocking off shots at the head when switching at first half and it decided to get shot through at the bottom?
---
Alpha packs are effectively free. You can‚Äôt buy they with R6 credits, only the in-game renown, so Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt profit off of the alpha packs and your chance to get a roll of the dice to get something good.
---
They will in Ember Rise
---
Somehow feels like choosing mk fighters.
---
They did say changes to casual map pool they just didn‚Äôt say which ones, I‚Äôm PRAYING.
---
Tbf
---
I'll take battlepasses over most other forms of monetization.
---
It's fairly transparent and without to much scummyness.
---
But Ubi needs to put in the effort on their end every season and make me believe they do enough to earn the right to battlepasses.
---
Say what you will about Fortnite (I know I do) but credit where it's due, Epic puts in the legwork every season to add a ton of new stuff.
---
Not just new sandbox elements but a creation feature, theatre mode..... 
---
Where is our far cry-esque map editor ubi? Hm?
---
Halo blew up from a map editor, I literally got a job for having multiplayer maps used in Halo matchmaking. Seige is a perfect game to create a tool like this.
---
Didn't they change the fire rate stats? I haven't checked as I don't really play the Russian's. Either way fire rate or not the SAGIA deals more damage per pellet and is better.
---
AK variants rise up!
---
I love how operators got more extravagant each time. We came from somewhat realistic special ops, to female Rambo and swamp-spook real fast.
---
Glad now has frags. Not sure why, but I assume because this gonna be a heavy deployable meta
---
Oh.. right lol
---
Making more money doesnt equal spending less money on the game, if the games getting better they are spending more on the game yall are just getting butthurt to get butthurt at this point
---
I'm tearing up just thinking about it
---
Shut up you melt
---
can't on mobile
---
Yup
---
Im confused, do we download this into our smartwatches? Ive never noticed operators in game wearing watches ?
---
Lower sensitivity aka. find a sensitivity that feels good, Get CS:GO for free, download aim training map from workshop, use website "sameaim" so you can set the same sensitivity in both games, train your aim 
---
Pro tip: set the acog ads sensitivity thingy in Siege to around 84 so it has the same traveldistance as hipfire.
---
There's no way around the training part. You'll get better by just continuing what you're doing now and playing the game but actually working on it helps the most.
---
Furthermore get as much forearm on your table as possible and use your whole arm to aim not just your wrist.
---
I only think its totally ridiculous that the season pass may not include the battlepass. If it does I won't care.
---
She's not an entry fragger lmao
---
Change the name of the gun and you can avoid licensing costs. They already do this with plenty of guns in the game already. Twitch‚Äôs F2 rather than calling it a famas.
---
Aww cute
---
Hello n04h006,
---
Meanwhile Priest almost killed Shroud with a controller before time ran out
---
Kirby's calling PETA
---
season pass gives you 600 credits, $5 worth.
---
elite skins are 1800  $15  (1620 with pass)
---
&gt;I meant its a misstep only if they make it an overpriced standalone purchase
---
there's a free version which I'll be happy for if the premium isn't reasonable. unlike all the other things where if the premium version isn't reasonable, I just get nothing.
---
How is this even supposed to read
---
Shit for the players but fucking gold mines for the devs. Imagine you published a game so good, people have to grind what they paid for.
---
yeah why do people do this? Ugh I hate everyone for it. Or when you speak and then they‚Äôre like yeet
---
jUsT dOnT bUy It
---
welp, that's not what the guy in the tweet said....sooooooooo

Fortnite Is going to die sooner than what they expect if they keep doing this.

We don‚Äôt all play Zelda
---
You never played Halo Reach did you?
---
https://youtu.be/LDUdcouRJsI
---
All of this, all free. All part of the base game experience. All unlocked by just playing the game.
---
I might have my issues with Reach but the armoury wasn't one of them.
---
I miss 2010 gaming.
---
Am I in the right sub?
---
no they can't, that's why I'm suggesting this idea for a buff as I feel Amaru will be a niche, but not a very strong operator in a team sense.
---
You can if you hit the three dots in the top once you‚Äôre in the subreddit.
---
just dont buy it... literally all cosmetics...
---
Smoke doesnt have elite skin
---
lol
---
Not to mention the absolute meme of the C1 on Frost, that thing was retired in 1988
---
I'm sad because I was hoping Amaru would get the FAD Assault Rifle but at the same time this gives a spotlight to the underappreciated guns of Siege so I'm all for it.
---
Plat white would make her so gorgeous. I would main her if that happened
---
odd how their abilities are swapped
---
Happy cake day
---
They should losen up the limits with 5 stacks and match based on the highest player. I can see the situation where someone had bad luck with solo queue and now can't play with their regular team mates to rank back up.
---
She's very effective if you play with people who soundwhore (Like me lmao) since it removes a ton of the information they use to guide how they play.
---
Dude, her regular skin looks pretty. Here she looks like a mashed botched up pancake.
---
they build a engine just for this game
---
I get your concerns, but I really doubt you'd be able to hit more than 2 shots on anyone with the kick the gun has. The problem with the ACOGon automatic weapons was their potential to land a headshot with one of the 15-20 bullets you could hose out of them. On top of the fact that they were available to ops that could flank and change position way too quickly.
---
Also, the fact that the gun has an ACOG and is semi automatic doesn't make it a DMR, DMRs rn have a lot more manageable recoil and can be equipped with a muzzle break.
---
He came back a year and a half later and changed his mind. 
---
And I agreed with his initial opinion, on launch the game was underwhelming and had a multitude of problems.
---
What happened
---
Oh they do? Never knew
---
&gt;DoN'T LiKe iT? dOn'T bUy iT. It'S jUsT CosMeTIc.
---
Even if you capitalize it like that, it still applies, both for the current Season pass + battlepass scenario and for the ridiculous (but not impossible) situation you described. If it comes to that it's because there's a market for it and it's profitable. You (and I) won't be on that market anymore, and that's ok.
---
They‚Äôre not meant to win gun fights and be one man armies, they‚Äôre meant to be supports
---
It‚Äòs also not like a new gun would feel much different than others. The Vector and Shotguns they reused are pretty different from many other guns in the game so pretty cool. 
---
Remember they also have to balance them out or you‚Äòd be bitching about that instead.
---
#YES! YES YES YES! YYYYYYYES!
---
The fact this cmt right here is not downvoted into oblivion tells me that there's still hope in this playerbase lol

gta is detailed for single player but this one is more detailed as a destructible multiplayer arena

---
Hello Sparky_Shepard, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Lol do people actually google stuff before posting? They did address it and they said it‚Äôs being fixed next season
---
Hello binan
---
And that's a fact
---
The whole Battle Pass thing seems to receive a lot of hate,and it's pretty understandable.
---
It looks like Ubi is now trying to squeeze as much money out of Siege as possible,killing Siege, without it even hitting Year 5 yet. 
---
Now here is why a Premium Battle Pass is a bad idea. Sure,it is optional.
---
But keep in mind all the microtransactions we have right now. We've got
---
-Event Packs(real life money,plus they can go up as expensive as the game itself)
---
-Elite Skins
---
-Normal Skins(bundles that can be purchased with a high amount of renown or with real life money,but also bundles only purchaseable via real life money,same with certain headgears and uniforms and such).
---
-Year Passes
---
-Other microtransactions such as Operator Bundles.
---
And soon we get a Premium Battle Pass? For how much? 
---
Ubi should make the Premium Pass a Year Pass thing.
---
This year,the Year 4 Pass will keep it's additional prize but next year,it should cost 10 or 20 bucks more than right now but include the Premium Battle Pass.
---
What they would have to do is constantly add new content to the Battle Passes every season.
---
It wouldn't make sense buying a Year Pass including a Premium Battle Pass when there is no content released for it,right?
---
Another thing is that the Battle Pass should never end.
---
Call of Duty Black Ops 4 has a similar thing. They have a contraband system with(more or less new items). 100 Tiers. When you finished all 100 Tiers,you only start earning reserve cases through it every hour.
---
Siege should be the same. When you unlocked every item,you start earning Alpha Packs through the battle pass by playing the game.
---
This way it keeps the player grinding and playing the game.
---
There actually is, in menu, in options, there is a tab for creating game options, where you can turn off any map or gamemode.
---
Can they just get rid off the headphone on her?
---
This is not true. AC II used the Anvil engine, while Siege uses the AnvilNext 2.0 engine (which is modified AnvilNext used for AC III and AC IV). Saying Siege uses the same engine as Siege is like saying Titanfall 2 uses the same engine as Half-Life 1.
---
Wonder what they're going to do come Y6S1 when they run out of room again.
---
If they keep making operators up until that point.
---
&gt;Limit to how many weapons we can licence/legally use in the game.
---
This is outright bullshit, there is literally a dozen of guns they can add legally to the game. And by dozen, I mean at least 30.
---
You mean shitty common free stuff that will be mostly charms right?
---
I have had the game installed for a couple of years but when i played i always got shit on, and it wasnt very popular a while ago either.
---
I played my first game in years yesterday and won with 9 kills but all i seemed to do was run around and reinforce a few walls. Would you recommend sticking to just 1 operator if i can? Is this what people mean when they say they "main" a operator?
---
Thats because its a 1x sight, zoom in and the recoil will become harder to control. Then again they would most likely have to add more recoil to her if they do.
---
Now what source, a reliable one from a Ubisoft employee, not some streamer, gave you that information they don‚Äôt have the top tier of battleye? Link it.
---
They will probably take it away next season when reworked theme park will come back to ranked
---
You need alot of knowledge.   
---
And you can only get knowledge by playing a ton of matches. Good luck!
---
I'm sure players would still complain about them not being new guns as these are mostly just balance changes to existing weapons. Some of these are already in the game/ not feasible to be introduced. I think people just need to get used to have guns on other characters tbh
---
Well that just shows how idiotic people can be
---
Do post the results. Also see if the explosion can break through soft walls or not.
---
Hello LrAllMight, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

Hello cochran3200, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Yeah the video that this post is off had something about this in the comments. Someone else got them too, but I don't remember who
---
I have watched for hours but got Copper charm :(
---
Well it would be more costly than just grabbing a stock image from a stock service they already pay for, that could easily be &gt;¬£100. Opposed to hiring a photographer to scout, shoot, and possibly edit an image. That could cost more than ¬£100, not considering the time that could take as well either.
---
Well I LOVE both of them! Definitely picking these up
---
Console data limits. There you go.
---
"YOUR POINT!" Lmao
---
I‚Äòm Lvl 98 and I have black ice for Thermite‚Äòs shotgun. Castle and Pulse also have his shotgun. Unfortunately I don‚Äòt like the gun so I never use it. I got it in my first ever Alpha Pack at Lvl 3, but I never got black ice again :(
---
How to miss the point of a post entirely
---
we need an elite for her
---
Very very very low sensitivity. I recommend 400dpi, 7V,7H,83ADS. It will seem way too slow at first but you quickly adapt.
---
&gt;AIKIDO
---
Same with most of the elites, hard to believe people buy these ugly ass skins
---
Whoever owns that image could make a killing
---
Actually wait
---
BFG50 is a great idea. 
---
Hear me out: An operator who is big as fuck and has a gun that shoots through reinforced walls. It hits a barricaded door? Take that fucker down. Hit a castle barricade? Get a melee sized hole instead of a bullet sized hole. (Bullet itself of course wouldn't be that wide, as that would be way fucking bigger than a .50,  that's just what it could leave as an exit hole.) 
---
I don't know if I like it better for attackers or defenders, because either side could use it and it would change how the other team plays. Anyway, essentially slower firing, loud, ranged, maverick.
---
Do you remember the Sniper elite 3 video
---
The Flammenwerfer werfs the Flammen that video is for me one of the best
---
Don‚Äôt care, I pay these people in coins and season passes for *new* content
---
I hit ash three times with it, then she killed me. I almost got votekicked by the team.
---
Yo long time no talk
---
What exactly can Ubisoft do?
---
Well this sucks. The team I play with goes from Gold 2 to Silver 4 so, now I can't play with my friends.
---
Thanks Ubi.
---
THANK YOU I LOVE YOU SO MUCH YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
---
Legitimately love you
---
There is just no reason for the hate, its optional, there's a free version, and if anyone cares about cosmetics that much they'll buy it. It's a smart business decision and a way to pay the bills. Hell, I'm buying it
---
That k/d is just legendary

Honestly I‚Äôm confused that they did Mira next. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I love the skin, but this is the 4th defender in a row to get an elite. I though for sure the next one would be buck or jackal, or at least an attacker.

It does that sometimes. I think it's just a queue error. Few and far between, though.

Fucking turkey first before greece gets added ill be a little pissed ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢

No it's terrible, it should stay in the 7th circle of hell where it belongs, along with Blackbeards original shield and the German ACOGS
---
I'll give you a upvote out of pity
---
I'm not sure about other people, but I'm not entirely jazzed with the increased monetisation of the game, with the season pass, R6 credit only skins (Pro League sets) and event packs. With the already increasing fan base and the hefty monetisation in the game, adding more just seems greedy.
---
This however this is different to other games that have greedy monetising like Cod and Red Dead Online, that publishers (Activision and Take 2 respectively) are behind these decisions.
---
Ubisoft is an independent game publishing studio, and make these decisions themselves, they know their audience, and this just looks like a cash grab.
---
That and imo the addition of new weapons in burnt horizon was an obvious incentive to purchase the pass, and then ditching adding new weapons to decrease development time to increase profit.
---
so frosts elite being a modern viking trapper, but she trains with iq?? so wouldn't her elite skin be similar and you didn't explain nothing you just stated how she had an old police training uniform.. so did bandit and his skins a biker?? and it doesn't fit at all she looks like cassie cage out of mortal kombat.. her skin would be more suited to her if they took her ability and enhanced it so to speak, when people are choking on their own blood from a corrosive agent you assume the plague so yeah it fits... when i see a women who tracks bombs, heart rate monitors as well as trophy systems etc i dont think OHHH KICKBOXER.. your opinion doesn't take much thought to break down because my IQ.. aint a fucking kickboxer pun intended
---
they should make a roman centurion helmet for alibi or maestro
---
Emmm ok
---
I really miss the golden days of this game . I wish I could relive some of my most memorable memories I had playing this game back in year 1 . I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre actually implementing a battle pass to the game.
---
Where ist the problem u dont like it u dont buy it? i mean they will not gain money from sell copies so they have to bring a other way of monetaization so they can work on the game longer
---
I know they need to make money somewhere, but for the people that buy them, can you at least make them look nice?
---
Skins in rs6 is like the blandest shit ever
---
Look, you're not gonna convince me that it deserves to be back in casual. I get that iTs JuSt CaSuAl but that doesn't mean I want the worst map in the game back in the map pool. And i'm not even getting into DaTa LiMiTs or any other justification for never having it return. I'm basing it entirely off my time playing that map. I  can have fun on house. I can have fun on Yacht. I can even have fun on Favela, even if it's attacker sided af. I cannot have fun on a map that only has ONE DOOR if I wanna avoid dropping a hatch or rappelling/vaulting. It is hugely flawed and deserves it's fate, die mad about it.
---
You can use renown to unlock ops or pay money, they aren't going to add 8 new ops a year with out getting any money in return.
---
Ahh how you do that?

I was thinking home front revolution for some reason but yes I can see a bit of Titanfall in it.
---
But why do they choose trash weapons in useless operators just like warden with an mpx it simply doesnt suit him hes a 3 armored operator and a slow one and a low damage weapon plus a very useless gadget makes him worse at least if he got  an acog it would be better and make sense
---
Same here, I watched the at least 24 hours worth over the whole weekend (afk/left on)
---
If you would care to read through this little thread you would find out that a lot of people got kills with them.
---
It's not optional if it's in the game you payed for, you retard. 
---
Optional means they give you an *option* to either have the new BP or continue playing without one while not being affected by not having the said BP. 
---
You can't fucking say 'it's optional' if no one ask your opinion whether you want it in your game or not.
---
update just got a bronze charm: http://prntscr.com/ouj8sm

I was waiting for him to get at least 1 kill when doing that...Got hyped but ya F
---
No. In stream they Said that even the casual map pool will shrink.
---
Also Maestro already has a shotgun secondary so they're basically useless.

Are you now pretending to be fucking retarded or were you born like that?

and no im not a Fortnite kid, i just checked it out when they released Fo...., so it kinda makes me sad that they put in a battlepass. Probably not even worth the money buying it

---
But there is no real gun variety. You pick an operator to match situation, now at that point I don't give a flip if gun in my hands looks like because you do not have a choice in the matter really.
---
People act like new guns will be "fresh air" while truth is they will still run Ash with c4 just as they did in previous season.

---
&gt; So WHY do we have a premium battle pass in a game we pay a premium price for?
---
What's considered a 'premium price'? The current price is ‚Ç¨20,- or almost half if you consider buying at other places. The current Season Pass is also much higher than the actual game price nowadays and all it does is give 7 days early access to new operators. Why are people not complaining about the Season Pass being bad?
---
Rocket League introduced a similar system (Rocket Pass) and it's in the same 'premium price' range. The only difference there is (for now; as I don't know the pricing of the R6 pass) that you invest ‚Ç¨10,- once and get currency back if you play enough to purchase the next Rocket Pass. 
---
A Battle Pass, for me, gives a sense of extra progression through playing rather than the slightest chance of an Alpha Pack that contains garbage.
---
AK12 but it's on a shit operator so C7E is better by default

Fuck them. Pay for a game. Half the game is locked behind absurd grind, microtransactions and loot boxes. There is a Season Pass every year. And now on top of all the predatory practices, there will be a Battle Pass. There is never enough money for them.
---
You would run SMG11 if you take shotgun primary because LMG is poorly suited for close encounters, so you'd do same thing as Smonk does on def. Loadout was given more thought than you give it credit in original post and it can be said about any role " [Role] gets [N weapon] instead of generic 30 round AR that is literally best gun in this game? Why?]

I dont think its engine limitations it's just saving development time cost.
---
I dont think it's a coincidence that recycled weapons started at the same time as reworked maps. Sure Kanal looks pretty extensive to be fair but no way Kafe took as long as a brand new map would have. Ubi are just cutting costs, I think they have to be careful though because a lot of people are seriously going to be thinking about whether the year pass is still worth it given the price hasn't changed but were getting less for our money now. 
---
What's worse they appear to be pushing for even more monetisation with the battle pass, whilst reducing content. I think Ubi would be smart to start including one new unique primary weapon per operator and then recycling the rest.
---
still only copper :( let's hope they roll out all of them after a while
---
Just for the plant. The rest of the whole round is outside.
---
3 people been telling me that so far but I am still on copper. we'll see
---
I‚Äôm sorry, am I missing something? Because I see very few, if any, situations where a claymore is better than a smoke on Glaz...
---
What, so that we can say we ShOt Up A ScHOoL?

---
Now this.. this is art
---
And it took you that long to figure this out? Not even after they had mtx in single-player games or banned people for making exp farming quests in Odyssey because they sell exp boosts there?
---
Dude, it's was only a matter of time. Just as it's a matter of time until they start adding premium guns with higher damage and lower recoil the moment they smell money there.
---
Affirmative
---
It is real and don't call me Shirley.
---
Ok but maps and guns have never been part of the season pass so remove that out of your complaint and youre left with 8 new operators.....which we are still getting  plus the same R6 credits, store discount and they even added the alpha pack boost so again I ask what are you missing this season that you got with other season passes?
---
And you call yourself echo main? Pre Bearing 9 nerf Supernova Bearing 9 was the shit
---
I mean yeah its slow but if you hit your shots it's not a problem
---
Yes
---
a lot of people only got copper so far but some said they just got a bronze as well. maybe we have to be patient
---
The game was genuinely a mess back when it was released and most of the criticism it received was warranted. Guess you weren't playing back then...

My guess would be the language barrier on eu servers since not everybody speaks english

Why do people do that tho? Like guy its just a game
---
&gt; Battle passes are a grind, no fun. Especially if you pay for it, you "must" play in order to make your purchase worth it. 
---
I do not think that is the case. The main point of the entire concept of a battle pass is greater player retention, meaning the entire point of the pass is to keep players grinding.
---
&gt; Honestly, depending on the implementation, this may be where I stop playing. w/e 
---
and not to get personal, but I don't think that's the best reason to stop playing considering it's *optional*.

Maybe the parents should look at the fucking rating? 18+ means 18+ not fucking high school. Why is it never the god damn parents fault

That's a rather negative way of looking at things. Nah I was just able to overlook all of that. Did you read the title? I clearly said it's not perfect :D
---
They see it lazy but most guns they reuse are good imo
---
Where's Cav at?
---
t-hunt with booster, 6-8k renown per hour
---
Yeah here is the kicker though, they have gamertags
---
No idea. The guns used this season are great guns.
---
People were annoyed with Nokk/Warden not just for the recycled guns, but also because the devs gave them some of the worst guns in the entire game (I don't care how the MPX/FMG have no recoil and are 'headshot machines').
---
If Warden/Nokk had gotten recycled guns that were GOOD, people would have been a little sad about the devs recycling guns, but they wouldn't have been as pissed as they were.
---
The guns used this season are very effective guns. The Vector shreds and the G8A1 is never used on IQ, but it has a good fire-rate and decent damage.
---
I'm much more hype this season already than I was last season.
---
Language barrier and Internet is worse in Germany for example (Germany has a big issue with the Internet idk why but I don't live there)
---
From her bio, i think Ying would just quit the force, but Lesion... I'm not so sure... (partly because I haven't read his bio...)

Well, there‚Äôs a 2-week period for us to just try it out. After that, you get a free reward path with some items along the way, or you can pay a currently undisclosed amount for more items.
---
I guess it‚Äôs just the fact that lots of video game companies are adding a battle pass, and we don‚Äôt like how Ubisoft is jumping on the bandwagon. I should also note that most of the battle passes in those other games didn‚Äôt get a good reception.
---
https://youtu.be/Elb2Xqm8OMY skip to 1:20 and look at the recoil graph
---
600 since para bellum
---
The only person i main besides vigil is getting a elite skin. This does put a smile on my face.
---
So did most people unfortunately....
---
They usually give acogs to 3 armour 1 speed defenders as they lack mobility
---
Ofc they will.
---
They just make him op enough so dumbasses of reddit buy into the seasonal meme of the year.
---
&gt;Everything in the game is free since day one
---
Aside from the entire fucking game... Supporting this garbage is pathetic. This is a full priced game with a $30 per year season pass, they don't need any more income at all, you're delusional if you think they're strapped for cash. This is the exact shit that leads to BattleFront 2 and Apex style toxic and disgusting monetization of a game. 
---
Just don't ever make a post complaining when the only way to get y6 ops is through premium battle packs.
---
Slug shotguns a.k.a. DMRs are a bit different. Semi-auto guns other than pistols will probably always have an ACOG.
---
198 hours
---
All those are from Burnt Horizon if I remember right.
---
hehehe
---
&gt;Wait what? When has automatic mattered in a game where 1 bullet to the head means a kill regardless of caliber?
---
With high rpm low recoil weapon your chance of landing a headshot by just unloading bullets into general area of their head is pretty damn high. I mean, they don't call Vector a headsot machine for nothing.
---
Sure, one bullet to the head from low rpm or semi auto gun is just as deadly, but with bigger recoil and lower rpm your chances of hitting them in the head (with equal skill) are lower.
---
Mozzie has a gadet that can be used for roaming and getting intel, so he shouldn't have one. Yoyo or whatever his name is has a gadet for on sight so he has one

True
---
They reworked him into a 2 speed from a 1 speed because people wanted him to be faster to place traps farther away. There was no problem with the traps but with the change in his speed they decided to give him more traps but to compensate from that and prevent him from being overpowered they dropped the damage down to 60 and then removed the laser sight as large numbers of people were complaining that the laser was basically invisible on several maps. Don't go nitpicking words to try and justify your point.
---
I‚Äôm saying hitreg is trash so most of the time shields get killed by people shooting through them
---
Which is exactly why it has no business being anywhere near ranked. Just like house.
---
Did nokk start tea bagging and then became a defender
---
they better not take away her facepaint for her elite, ill start flipping tables if they do
---
I personally don't mind the Battle Pass as other people and think it may be a good thing.
---
 
---
My Reasons:
---
\- player retention
---
Actual real goals and objectives are pretty good for players to actually have something to do. Could maybe also
---
prevent burnout.
---
\- maybe finally some good skins:
---
I really hope that there will be some half decent skins. And I wouldn't say that it is "locked behind a paywall" as
---
you'd either be super lucky to draw it in Alpha Packs or buy it.
---
\- probably not super expensive:
---
I am aware that people believe that the Pass will be $30+  but I don't think so. It'd be really stupid for Ubisoft to knowingly piss of an entire fan-base ^((I know)
---
^(they tend to do that but still)) . I also believe that it will most likely come with the season pass as it would be the most
---
intelligent thing to do to maximize profits.
---
\- the free path
---
Now, of course the free path won't be as good as the premium one, but I do still believe that it'll still give you
---
good stuff because R6 has been very generous when it comes to micro transactions (i.e. not pay2win).
---
Thermite main here üòÇ 150 hours in him alone
---
Hell no.
---
Mozzie is an amazing operator. His gadget is so useful that he doesn't need ACOG.
---
Also, both his guns are amazing. The Commando 9 literally reminds me of Jager's 416, but with almost no recoil and with less damage and 5 less rounds.
---
He's already effective enough at winning gunfights.
---
10th of September
---
Mozzie with acog would be way too strong. Not only would you have so much map control because of the drones,but then you'd also have an acog on your FULLY AUTOMATIC primaries? And then also nitro cells? And that all as a 2 speed? He'd be an Echo 2.0 but stronger.
---
Too OP.
---
They might remove the acog from Kaids and Goyos shotgun once they see that it's gonna be abused for spawnpeeking purposes too often and maybe add it on Kaids aug instead.
---
Only time will tell.
---
No vigil with the giggle?
---
Yeah, also that.
---
I don't remember the last blue or higher item I got in an alpha pack, all commons and uncommons duplicated.
---
next year *people flexing in game with their Rolex*
---
LOL. This is not about me, but about the problem. Not everyone can play in higher ranks. By the way, I met such stacks on silver ranks too.
---
Same with old flame, fuckin ugly girl
---
I like the current elite more since I prefer elites that are true to operators lore
---
You'd still play Siege if it didn't have cosmetics, right? So why do cosmetics hold such importance? It makes no sense.
---
Not too sure.
---
sounds great. Now, outside of purchasing Season Pass, I can also pay for a privilige of possibility to unlock new stuff if I play enough.  
---
/s  
---
Battle passes are the worst thing in modern online games. Maybe after loot boxes.
---
1. Interro is not a pro.
---
2. Ubi definitely should listen to pro players more than us casual plebs, no matter how many season passes we buy.
---
3. Is everything alright at home? You seem a bit upset for absolutely no reason.
---
And? Do this affect gameplay?
---
Yes it does, more money going to making s better gameplay experience rather that on an image.
---
It's getting a rework next season. Maybe that's why they removed it.
---
The entire harry thing is just wierd to me. It makes the game seem even less serious. (Besides distancing itself from the previous rainbow six games)
---
I really doubt it honestly with how easy they are to counter. Really they can be shot from above below ay explosives and can damage both teams.
---
I see youre a man of culture as well
---
Possibly the flag of Krak√≥w?
---
Thought the new ops were both 2 speed?
---
Guess I can predict the future
---
Yea but the point of people hacking is to get in high ranks and he‚Äôs just ruining it in casual.
---
*help me*
---
Even if there is limits or regulations a gun still makes an operator because once that gadget is gone all you is your gun and some make an operator like imagine playing ash without the r4-c or twitch without the f2 they still make an operators identity

Hello xCrizp, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

Have you even read the lore for Bandit? He was part of Hell's Angel's I believe, that was his undercover wear. A lot of these elites are based on their own lore, and Smoke and IQ are both in that category.
---
Oh yeah, forgot ddosing only happens to ubisoft and not to other any online games i play.
---
I know about all the problems the gave has had since release, and also I do, but all of us are starting to get frustrated with this game
---
Hasn‚Äôt there been other games where they require you to completely redownload the game? I mean if the wanted a new engine they could just make everyone redownload it on the new engine. Same name, same game different engine

Overtime has nothing to do with balance, you could just have overtime because attack wins every single round, that's the definition of unbalanced

be ready to quit then

Not taking credit, not trying to, don't want to. Just glad at how lucky I was.

Is this out now?

Yeah would be mad if we got more story drivin missions
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying
---
The reduced the number if maps in casual map pool. Anyone know which maps these are??
---
I like skyscraper
---
Both of the defender's guns are god-tier. Imagine bringing a suppressed supernova primary on attack though lmao
---
Well I‚Äôm pretty sure at some point Rogue has said that is basically what has happened, a lot of the newer weapons are just very slightly tweaked versions of older weapons, just with a new in-game models.
---
Comestics is the least thing that I care about, in what way does it improve my Gameplay experience, I mean I can see my gun camo yeah but not the Outfit im wearing.
---
Not really, if you are familiar with cheats you will know this clearly is legitimate.
---
GSUTR is made up

When the new oporation comes out
---
Perhaps the Aped devs can learn a thing or two from this response
---
F2 broken as hecc

Yeah I sent this to my friend told me to restart and now I am. Was playing mobile games lol. Don't hit me to restart.

Seige will die before fortnite and I don't even play fortnite. That is how much confidence I have in ubisoft.

November will be for season 4. The TTS for Ember Rise will either be today, Monday, or tomorrow, Tuesday.

That‚Äôs the best way to do it imo
---
Ehhhh not really. Would be true if it was like 2 seasons ago when the ranked charms were similar to the major charms but they are now completely different each season. Also just got the diamond charm and it‚Äôs pure ass, can‚Äôt even see the diamond in it lmao. Can‚Äôt wait till season is up so I can get the plat rank charm, looks so good
---
haha, thanks for replying!
---
&gt;they've taken over $180 from me
---
No, you've voluntarily purchased over $180 in products from them. If those products weren't worth the money to you personally, then you're bad financial decisions are a you problem.
---
New op?
---
With the changes there are actually only Skyscraper and Chalet left as unbalanced maps which would mean there are still 10 remaining, probably 11 next season when Theme Park gets reworked. How many god damn maps do you guys need? Don't tell me 10 maps is 'always the same' cause it's not.
---
Now make one with headshots and didn‚Äôt count
---
üëå
---
I‚Äôm hoping the new Xbox will be something like the X upgrade. All past games can get upgrades if the developer chooses to.
---
he meant clubhouse
---
Yo
---
I'm fairly sure in the video it said Twitch disables it rather than setting it off
---
It did during the invitationals, how do I know this? There were people in this subreddit karma whoring about that as well.
---
What‚Äôre you gonna do? Fucking cry about another set of items that won‚Äôt even matter? People have shown that they will/ won‚Äôt buy it. So why do we all still puss out pants about something that won‚Äôt even be noticed unless you let it? You don‚Äôt even have to buy the damn season pass and you can get the ops. The more I think about it... the only requirement to play is to buy the base game?
---
Nope
---
Right, you‚Äôre on the money. 
---
So what do Ubisoft do for those players caught in a flood of toxic COD refugees who only play aggressive and fast-paced - because the changes the dev team have made at the request of a lot of pro players have also, coincidentally, emboldened the run-out, all-aim no-brain mindset that is currently ruining Ranked for a lot of players. 
---
As Defenders, we‚Äôre now gonna get grapple hook rushes to contend with.
---
Incidentally, I never understood the single-staircase criticism of Hereford and Kanal given both had dozens of rappelling opportunities.
---
The whole squad* not the whole team. So if you TK, anyone you queued with gets RFF.
---
It's basically runout city
---
I don‚Äôt know just mess around and have fun. Playing ranked everyday and trying to climb ranks ruined the game for me before I met my best friend on the game. Enjoy it for what you can do with it and the people you play with. There‚Äôs legit 10 people in each game you play in, you can make so many friends and enjoy so much more! Just enjoy life :)
---
I think it's a legendary item in alpha packs so you probably won't get it

definitely, that was a big focus. full reveal answer your question in some detail: [https://youtu.be/sD-d2rZm\_TI](https://youtu.be/sD-d2rZm_TI)

&gt;ignorant pieces of shit

\&gt;doesn't bother to google any of these CTUs for 5 fucking seconds
---
What a stupid fucking hypocrite
---
He's just saying he was disappointed and even though I love warden I still hate that he didnt get a good gadget or new gun
---
Roddit gauld
---
Theme park is getting a rework so maybe thats the reason they removed it
---
One word:
---
Ubisoft
---
It does not.
---
That god they aren‚Äôt taking barbed off J√§ger
---
Just posted the photos as a Imgur link in the comments
---
Twitch and Thatcher cant set off the cannister of the shield.  You can watch video from the major.
---
Valk,N√∂kk, Doki, Finka, Ela. The one squatting is Cav.
---
And bank
---
You *will* die.
---
You just took a picture of your monitor. Your on PC. You literally just have to press F12.
---
Hello ClassyOperator, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
I enjoy this much
---
Im use only this gun as Thatcher. Never like L85 :P
---
Fortress only has 2 viable sites IMO. Going first floor is usually a coin toss on who is going to win
---
Then again, you have to take into account for the amount of projectiles the attacking team can hold, just think of this:
---
Jaeger's gadget can get rid of an infinite amount of projectiles, yours gets rid of *2*, you see what I mean?
---
Literally happens every time I play. I have 10-20 ping, then 200+ for a few seconds every minute or so.
---
She's so perfect. Do you have a pic of the back ? I want to see her hair
---
Fam Ive seen people getting vote kicked before the games even finished loading let alone ops picked
---
After 200 hours of game time in RS6, I can confirm the entire community thinks every single map in RS6 is dogshit, unbalanced, and ‚Äúcan be fixed with their favorite streamers few suggestions‚Äù
---
Good news for me then
---
I completely agree with you. Even if it seems like no one likes new Hereford or Fortress they're still better  balanced maps than Chalet or Skyscraper which are really annoying to play, especially Sky.
---
Also I'm super sad for Theme Park, even with its flaws it is probably in my personal top 5 for maps, but at least we already know that it's going to be reworked so it's certainly coming back on S4 (maybe they will even include it in the competitive pool instead of Border?)
---
Just give people map select and let the community decide which maps are the best.
---
Some maps are just plain ass.
---
At her age too? It's really amazing
---
Are you mentally retarded
---
Omg lol
---
How tho
---
Well he should join pro league then, he is a half jar
---
What if i told you it was actually my tv
---
They hated Jesus because he told them the truth
---
The double cut to the hostage being shot made me laugh.
---
do people not like skyscraper?
---
Top Nep
---
This isn‚Äôt even my screenshot lol, my best diamond is velvet shell
---
Yea ubi has them priorities straight. üëçüëç
---
Your shield was away from your face but the killcam was glitched, that‚Äôs it, nothing wrong with the shield
---
Hi
---
She looks like gridlock a little bit
---
I just want Jackal to get an outfit that isn‚Äôt boring/ugly.
---
Maybe you will get it later I hope you do.
---
and then make the melee a headbutt
---
It's definitely been in ranked ever since it was released in Year 1. You must never play ranked unless you're thinking about tower and mixing them up
---
Nice! I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little jealous.
---
Removing the ability to melee down castle barricades would completely break him.  It could become literally impossible for the attacking team to get on site in certain situations.
---
Exactly. This happens on every competitive game not just siege lol
---
Im a little bit confused. The clothes seem like 100% from the Republican Army, but the coordenates lead to a National Bunker...I cant understand.
---
 M E N T L E G E N
---
I hated old Hereford everything was too close quarters and the spawn peeks never stopped
---
Bank is pro league material, it's totally fine.
---
I think it‚Äôs more likely we didn‚Äôt get any new weapons because they spent all their time on the new battle pass
---
This was suggested 8 million times
---
All I need is her Aug.
---
They won‚Äôt add weapons to the battle pass. Operator loadouts are a huge part of the balance, they haven‚Äôt ever added a weapon except for Mute SMG 11 but that was a vanilla gun anyway.
---
She's the best flex operator. You can bring her as a 5th pick on top of all the essentials as either a wild card, entry fragger, soft breacher, etc. Twitch can frag better with the F2, but she can't destroy soft walls and open up line of sight. 
---
I'm not sure how you mean Monty is a better fragger but I'm entertained by the idea of a three speed monty demolishing site and then the defenders.
---
How is fortress unbalanced?
---
Oh, well that's disappointing.
---
We didn't listen. All he wanted was his ACOG :(
---
Wait so does he wear a black creepy hood when he recruit rushes with shotty?
---
Fuck this BS
---
I‚Äôm not trashing it, I don‚Äôt care. Just wonder why the mass appeal the the fact it‚Äôs literally everywhere you go
---
Really isn't haha
---
that's an oof from me
---
I agree. People crying about more maps in a mode that is designed for fun.
---
They gave Thatcher the m590a1 post launch
---
As a silver, I'm complaining.  This map pool change was pretty much a worst case scenario.
---
Hereford and Fortress had to go, so I'm not giving Ubi any credit for making such an obvious decision.  They got every other decision about the ranked map pool wrong.  Among the 80% who wanted the map pool reduced, Skyscraper was the clear third map that nearly everyone agreed needed to go.  Instead, it was retained and Theme Park (which has far more people who wanted it kept in and imo is a much better map) was dropped.  Dropping both would be defensible, but keeping Sky and dropping Theme is not.  And Ubi continues with the stupid practice of adding every new map into ranked--whether they deserve it (Villa, Outback, Kafe) or not (Hereford, Fortress, likely Kanal).
---
All this means is that next season the ranked map pool is going to have to be cut again--with Theme added and Sky and Chalet removed (I would tentatively include Kanal in that list, but I have zero faith that Ubi does the right thing and removes it after one season if it's bad).
---
Aight imma head out
---
I would argue that it dies benefit us. I got one am white glad that there is now more reason yo play and more cosmetics. Granted most if it won't be free but this is normal, in fact having most if their cosmetics free is very unique. This us no different than elites pl skins or event skins, it's more content that doesn't take away from the game and that can give players more reason to continuously play.
---
I‚Äôve heard mixed things ITA12L, I‚Äôve seen some say it packs a good punch and is a good shotgun but not worth using over the other options, and others that say that it‚Äôs got an atrocious firerate but that S is awful and only good for opening up sightlines.
---
Five? Unless you could Spetsnaz Recruit as Russian, there's only 3 actual Russians in the game.  
---
Fuze is Uzbek and Finka is Belarussian
---
R.i.p
---
It ain't gonna happen, console is the red headed step child here (and for good reason really, the game just works better on PC, most games like this do)
---
Found the guy with no friends! What do I win?
---
Because a billion dollar company should have the resources to have a process to double or tripe verify things before pushing a patch into production.
---
Yea but glaz boy needs smonks
---
You're defiantly in the minority
---
I mean, she reminds me of someone as well. Not sure whom though...
---
Just because they add more things to buy doesn't make them greedy... it's totally optional you don't need to buy everything that's put in front of you
---
I mean he is wearing earmuffs
---
Wild Instinct isn't a seasonal skin, but a skin only for thr G8 lmg.
---
I thought of Rebecca from OG Resident Evil
---
With kanal we already have 11 maps lmao. How many more fucking maps do you want? have you even thought about the guys who haven't been here for a long time ?
---
That's why I left Bionicle out I didn't know that it was haha
---
Eternal wing is making me cum hard.
---
Yeah a fair number of people I know do that which meant I had to as well.
---
Suffice to say I'm never touching csgo again.
---
This reminds me, Frost need a buff
---
Make her Mat out of plexiglass so its transl√∫cido but you can still ser light glint from certain angles. Or att least wood
---
Black stand out too much since lighting has been reworked and basically everymap tile is brown
---
r/R6OperatorCreator
---
Peekers advantage. ping affecting you when you move backwards and him moving forward. therefor you can't see him but he can see you, he sees you were you were 100 ms before and you see him were he was 100 ms before. therefor you don't see him yet.   
---
hope it clears something up.
---
Cav went from "I'll cut you if you even look at me" to "let me see your manager".
---
Forgot about that tbh. Dont play him much
---
Shush im trying to do that :P
---
Id love mira with an acog, even for just a week
---
CRAP you are rigth
---
No one does
---
Because then in three months they can take Chalet and Skyscraper out but say "bit we are adding the new Theme Park in so it's not all take away!"
---
RTX ON
---
I also imagine the garra hook will get a buff of sorts
---
Have they posted any pictures of the Mirror skin yet?
---
This game has had unpatched bugs since OP health. That shows the devs aren‚Äôt getting enough resources. 
---
This isn‚Äôt a f2p game, this is Ubisofts biggest game, it‚Äôs a premium game, and it has made billions, it has enough to keep itself afloat for years upon years. They‚Äôre adding more MTX to get the execs more money
---
the guns dont all have to be perfectly balanced. if they reskinned vigils gun, gave it a new name and recorded a new sound effect for it, that would be a 'new' gun that people would like
---
imo they are getting lazy with the game or just not investing as much in to it anymore - we are getting recycled maps, the 'new' maps we have got have been so bad (hereford, fortress) that they took them out of Ranked now, and obviously the recycled guns too
---
yes you dont "NEED" new guns, but it helps create excitement about the game and the operators
---
One of my friends likes too. Dont see much use tho. Have only seen ying played once all season
---
............... Monty Python? .........
---
It‚Äôs available for season pass holders I think, I have it but I play on Xbox go on YouTube and check out the video my Ubisoft I did
---
Actually an interesting alternative to Mute/Vigil
---
However  2 things that should apply to this op
---
1. Similar (yet distinct) white bar effect to vigil when near the AOE of the device
---
2. The device itself should not be invisible to drones
---
A way to passively hide from drones should have as much counterplay as possible
---
Same dude why everyone gotta hate on Jackal
---
And jesus Ubi, we have favela and yacht, why can't we have the first map I've ever played, barlett U.?
---
Kafe and Consulate aren‚Äôt popular enough, Bank and Oregon would be more likely to stay in if community voted
---
I think the duration of her gadget has to do with a large portion of her usefulness. She can barely walk up one flight if stairs, or cross a corridor. Meanwhile Caveira can brew some coffee, take a dump, and then interrogate a guy while her ability is on.
---
Why the hell are they taking away maestros shield?
---
I was actually really happy to be able to use the fmg because I have black ice for it and prefer the shotty on smoke
---
Or here is a thought: *dont have the fucking defuser as a fragger*
---
What the fuck do you mean by ducking?
---
True, the Super was another choice and the FO12... Yeah, I wouldn't give an attacker can jump into the objective and use the SMG-11 the best combat shotgun in the game tbh.
---
I prob only got the copper one bc i didn't know that you had to watch 25 hours of a major to get all
---
The season before skyscraper was actually Favela... but you're correct before that was Border, one lucky map that they managed to make balanced in year 1
---
N o t  f u n n y  d i d n t  l a u g h
---
You could say the same about a lot of seasons. See dokkaebi and vigil for example.
---
u/vdownloaderbot
---
Guys I found the wizard
---
Thanks man. You are like 1st WHO is not retardet troll.
---
Same. 
---
Fortress isn't a PL map but it's still better than Scyscraper.
---
It's unbalanced and the bottom floor Is basically useless? Definitely, but still better than Scyscraper bottom floor.
---
At least they're not as ridiculous as Amayu
---
Note that this thread is about the ranked map pool which is very limited. Even casual is about to have their map pool reduced as well. There may be 11 maps but we're playing on less than half.
---
Yeah I don't see ying a lot either
---
Perhaps
---
But i like skyscraper
---
But fun
---
Will this work like Rocket League?
---
No make it stop
---
To me, it really makes a difference at the end of a round with 1v1 or 1v2 play. She sets the defuser, zips up the hatch that's the nearest, pulls out her ITA, makes a hole in the floor and then it's very easy for her to hold the defuser and/or delay for enough time to pull out the win.
---
That's Wildlands
---
Can‚Äôt wait till Reddit convince Ubisoft to put Bartlett U back in rank because we don‚Äôt have enough maps
---
S4 OP leaks already?
---
I'll just post that I really like Blitz.... :3
---
yeah i've figured that out
---
&gt; more than 6 different channels of monetization in one game, most without much benefit to the player 
---
I completely agree with you, they really are milking the game, but what are they supposed to do. They still don't 100% care about each and every customer. They're a multi-billion dollar company. The only thing they care about is money and making their investors happy. That concept isn't necessarily  unique to Ubisoft.
---
&gt; but there are definitely people that really feel pressured to have the best looking skins possible 
---
And this I find really unfortunate because the only reason big companies get away with this stuff is because there are always people that will happily throw their money against a wall just so they may look cool or gain the tiniest of advantages.
---
Shes really not though, as I said in my other comment Buck does all of that better or on par. Twitch can out frag her which if you just need someone who is an entry, shes a better pick. This also isn't bringing up Gridlock who has soft destruction as well, alongside a better gadget that can be used to move people out of cover or lock them in place. Cap has a gun thats as good or better, has a gadget that is better, and is a 3 speed. This is also ignoring the fact that she does not bring essential utility like several others instantly eliminating her from being able to take No.1.
---
Also Monty is completely broken, he auto wins all 1v1s and post plants meaning for a 5th pick I'd also always take him instead due to his raw utility.
---
It's much more competitive than Skyscraper ever was. Honestly other than train splitting the map and the haunted area being a mess, I think that map is really well made. Especially in comparison to Skyscraper.
---
I think it's a completely bullshit cheap tactic that ruins the round for people but it's part of the game so I just accept it.
---
No like from the drone like not shot the back out like twitch like it will show out the camera from the drone
---
Jumping in front of the multi-million dollar company that is Ubi to shield them....so brave.
---
I really want to see University back. On ranked. I love that map.
---
Skyscraper one of the best maps in the game...
---
Wow they have a subreddit for everything
---
she gives me  a lot of anne frank vibes ngl
---
I don't really follow any of this esport stuff, but I'll definitely get the skins that look cool anyway.
---
I've been matched against my uni mate, during the holidays to when I'm in the UK and he's in France
---
First one looks like Carnevale from Parabellum and the other looks like a mix of Peacock and ansectorial Southwest
---
Skyscraper is both a run out map and more importantly only has two viable sites. They should have maps that at least have 3 sites stay in the pool.
---
Eh, it's your money, do with it as you please. If i buy one it will be for the team i support though.
---
I will 100% buy my favorite team skins. In my case that's G2s set on Sledge, even tho my main is Hibana. :)
---
i buy pro league skins on overwatch, whatever looks cool to me i get.
---
Maybe entitled is a bit strong of a word, but I feel like everyone expects tons of new flashy things that are free for all, as much as we'd like it, the world doesn't work that way.
---
This game is a live service. Live service needs a continued source of income, without that a live service cannot function. There are several ways they make money but none if them are required to play the game. Also the reason there aren't new guns is because they've released so many it is hard to make a new gun because they're all the same.the reason behind the map but is quite simple this game has a data limit, they can't make it too large in order to avoid this they are doing more reworked because they hardly change the game size but they still do periodically add new maps. This us simply an engine limitation and to fix this problem they would have to build the game ground up again. I realise your frustration with these changes but you should at least try to understand why they're doing this in the first place.
---
They should of at least gave her some kind of face paint
---
skyscraper aint that bad tbh
---
And ive seen blitz a handful of times but either im dead before he gets to me or i kill him before he does
---
I personally don't like it because for anyone unexpirience or unsuspecting of spawn peaks, they will get domed and completely nullifying their chance to play that round. And you have to wait soooo long to play again. I personally think its a cheap move to get 1-2 people down on another team that ruins the point of the game. The game is meant to be played, and to seige.
---
maybe another op can lend him a shield
---
The spitting image of Charlie sheen in hot shots
---
It‚Äôs so defense-skewed. Attacking first really sucks on that map.
---
you just made my day mate!!! LMAO!!
---
No worries, I probably sounded more harsh than intended. Sorry about that. I'm happy with you, the Mira elite looks fantastic :)
---
You can unlock every operator for free, you get every new seasonal operator for free, you get new maps and map reworks free. You can get the alpha packs for free and they keep adding new legendaries to the alpha packs for free. You can keep getting seasonal skins for free. (By free here I mean just by playing and using renown)
---
Hell you can buy alpha packs with renown even though idk why anybody would, so no that‚Äôs not loot box gambling. The only thing they‚Äôre asking you to pay for is early access to new ops which isn‚Äôt important and these cosmetics which again aren‚Äôt important. Compared to other games that require you to pay for new maps and characters R6 hardly has an issue.
---
Also how do you know the money isn‚Äôt going back into the game? Can you prove that at all?
---
Don't play them then. They look cool to the rest of us. Real went out the window a while ago
---
Seen this suggested before, and think it could be a really good idea. There are plenty of strats that could be made incorporating a reinforced half-height wall, especially with Mira.
---
A drone that shoots from the camera?
---
Yea of the 3 removed, for me I actually like Fortress. Hereford is defender sided, Themepark is a bit dark and train can benefit from a rework. 
---
Although I like Fortress since out of personal experience I have strats that work on both attack and defense and haven't found either side being overly advantageous than the other as far as I know.
---
Hereford though, every fair match I have, the round wins mostly come from defending and it usually ends up 5-4 victory based on who did a silly thing and throw a defense round.
---
Ok than don't buy it
---
Probably just ranked maps
---
I hate almost all the maps tbh. I really just like theme park and plane.
---
I‚Äôd like to try whatever you‚Äôre on, please.
---
This is awesome
---
But I really want to see this in had now
---
Fuck off.
---
Amayu is supposed to be like 49 or something
---
"Hey guys, look at me, I am showing everyone I am an ass!"
---
On the serious side, at least I am not an ass like you are, my intention was just to correct him.
---
Showing I am smart? Nah, definitely not the smartest person. But do I know my English well? Yes, that I am sure I am, thus why I corrected him, since his typo was really off, and if that's the mistake he did, then he surely could have used the correction for the next time.
---
Some people appreciate being corrected, to write properly for the next time, and then there are others who prefer being jerks, like you just did.
---
So you do you, if that's your path, who am I to judge, if it makes you feel better by believing I tried to look smart, then so be it I guess, but oh man, you are way off.
---
In ranked? I played Hereford in ranked last night if that's what they are talking about
---
To reiterate, it's not about who can do what better. She's a very successful jack-of-all-trades that you can use however you want to. Watch the Raleigh grandfinal that just happened and you'll see what I mean. 
---
It's like buying a large amount of food that tastes ok but you can cook to make whatever you want, vs buying expensive, specific food that tastes good on it's own but doesn't really work as an ingredient
---
If pro cannot handle bad maps. How do u expect the average person to handle them?
---
If you can, you honestly should think of joining PL.
---
Played it last night and every single round was met with vaulting and window peeks. Granted this was gold but the rounds lasted a minute tops. Objective didn‚Äôt get played at all, it was just team death match with people vaulting around.
---
Bikini did that in a video.
---
Theme Park  &gt; Chalet and Skyscraper
---
Details
---
That's why I only solo TH.
---
The reason I care about cosmetics is because it just always turns sour and gross. Remember when CoD only had cosmetic items in crates? Now there are so many weapons that you can only get through crates. Apex is charging like $200 for a single skin with no possible way to earn it entirely through gameplay. As for money streams, how about the $60 upfront cost, $30 a year season pass, countless R6 credit only weapon skins, multiple $10 weapon skin packs, and $20 each Elite skins? They made like $35 million in June alone, if you honestly think that they're strapped for cash I don't even know where to begin.
---
Most headshots don't happen with the first bullet, not at all. 
---
People do prefire and spray a lot while controlling the fire towards the enemy head, both things impossible with a semiauto. 
---
Go try a spawnpeek with the shotgun-DMR and tell me the results when multiple fullauto gun with lower recoil than yours are shooting back at you.
---
Do u work in retails
---
I like fortress and theme park but hate outback , Hereford
---
F
---
Nice repost.
---
Idc about esports for this game, but i support teams that play that i know from other games. Also some look cool
---
Beretta isn‚Äôt common but glock is everywhere
---
I hate smokes leather pants and high tops
---
Yall know they need to actually have a map to play in ranked right?
---
Uhhh, THE YEAR OLD BUGS are literally the biggest proof. We have had the same bugs 3 times for the past 6 months, Hell we even have another clash exploit again. Even overwatch has new characters and maps for free, and look how well that game is doing. Also YOU. CANT. BUY. EVENT. PACKS. WITH. RENOWN. you cannot get event items individually, you have to gamble with real money to get the item you want. Stop shilling retard
---
I've found some pants on ebay but they are all large... Do you know about boots and the shirt, the radia ect?
---
Walk in front of the glocked and prepare to get rocked.   But forreal people need tto learn spacing. A lmg sprayin a corner to supress doesnt mean walk in front and get clapped.
---
Hes gonna lose his nitro, not impacts
---
It's my favorite map

Did you repost this using my comment as the title? ha
---
Life was fun back then
---
was
---
Seems like Casual with Ranked rules, so we will have a casual mode which is quick, and another which is identical to ranked, but without rankings.
---
Meaning you will get diamonds or coppers or golds, it won't matter there.
---
Like not like twitch him r she can ues the drone to shot a camera out for the a tacking teammates
---
Why are you in blackface?
---
Fortress is way better than Skyscraper.
---
The fact that you don't or pretend not to understand what I am saying cements my point &lt;3
---
Y'all need to stop calling good things OP. 
---
OP means "Over-powered", a thing so strong that break the game. 
---
The old Scorpion was OP, Kaid's shotgun isn't. Otherwise people would be picking Kaid way more.
---
Yes i reposted this post 3 times trying to get better name
---
Safe and sound
---
Yea it is
---
Literally unplayable
---
Hate it when people don‚Äôt get it when I talk in the language of meme
---
I tend to spawn in places that i can lay down fast and pray i dont get clapped. The worst is border run out in my opinion  its so toxic but so satisfying if you get it
---
yes, and they can do so in casual
---
Battle Pass... why?
---
Unranked exists to let people practice/warm up for Ranked without having to touch the shitty casual cesspool. This should have been added years ago but I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs finally here now. 
---
They never promised that TR would become an official mode. It‚Äôs cool; I played it a few times, but if there‚Äôs no rank tied to it most people won‚Äôt touch it. And if you think people get stressed out about normal Ranked, TR would give those people heart attacks.
---
That's not a large enough map pool and definitely shouldn't include the new map unless we're sure it will be good.
---
PL benefits from a small map pool.  There are relatively few matches and teams spend a lot of time outside of matches prepping.  Having a smaller pool increases the time they can spend on each map (and the quality of their strats/execution) and the small number of matches means repetitiveness isn't a real problem.  They also have the skill and coordination to exploit weak map design.
---
For the most part, none of that is true of ranked play.  Players play far more matches, increasing the threat of repetitiveness.  They lack the same ability to exploit weak map design.  They still can in some cases (such as Chalet at higher MMR), but the threshold is much lower and less uniform.  And players generally don't spend anywhere near the same time prepping for matches.  As a result, a larger map pool is more beneficial to ranked play.
---
A 10-11 map pool (with the right maps) would hit the sweet spot, imo, where it has enough variety to avoid repetitiveness without including any maps that are too weak.
---
No one has an issue with things like Elite skins though, they're a worthy use of $20. Completely unique skins for Operator, weapons, and gadget, not to mention an entire animation for the end screen. That is completely justifiable to be sold at $20 and I've even bought a few of them. Maybe its because of Black Ops 4, but a battlepass really scares me and what they can do with it. Not for nothing, but Ubi did put game play skipping elements in the new Assassins Creed only available through loot boxes, I just worry that they'll sell gameplay in a box with (I hope I'm wrong but, idk with the current landscape) operators ending up being locked behind them.

Nah iam going to delete it if you want

Hello losci, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
lotion
---
Battle Pass in a paid game? WTF?
---
What's wrong with you
---
No one plays Favela
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Old one wasn't competitive for new ops. Rework comes still isn't competitive.
---
I don't know what that means¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø¬†
---
I think adding Unranked is great. There are a lot of people who don't want to deal with the ladder anxiety, or just how serious people can take ranked, yet love the gamemode/ruleset vs casual.
---
I think this new playlist caters to a lot of people, whether they are practicing for ranked, or just want to play casually but with a better set of game rules.
---
Well yes your completely correct, however don't you think its sorta silly to have gone from superpower that ruled the world to being beaten by a guy that wouldn't eat????? (No sarcasm here)
---
Exactly, so Wild instinct isn‚Äôt only for the G8A1 but all the weapons you mentioned.
---
That's what it is, one person says they miss an awful map and then people get nostalgic about it and before you know it everyone is saying the rework is trash.
---
They can just give him another wepon
---
Sorry but skyscraper is the 2nd best map that came out for y1 an I still love it to this day
---
Boarder was the best tho
---
Me 2 I tracked my maps and got theme park fortress Hereford and skyscraper 74% of the time and that a 4 out of 14 maps
---
I never said that?
---
I like this idea a lot. I was playing Hereford Base on basement with warden, watching the chimney room (don't know what it's actually called). They droned in and realized that I was camping that doorway to try to deny entry. One flashbang was thrown in, so I activated my ability to find nomad rushing in after it. I had the shotgun, so I injured her immediately and got a free kill. The problem was that after that encounter, I was no longer immune and a second flashbang followed with ash and my death behind it. I think his ability would be benefited by having passive flashbang resistance. Of course, to balance a little bit, he might still have to turn on his glasses for Ying or Zofia. I think that they were trying to balance him by making him have to stand still to see through smoke, but I think it my be better if it only has 30% or 50% visibility while moving and full while he's standing. There's no point to him existing as a challenger to Glaz if Glaz immediately has the edge in every encounter. That mixed with passive flashbang resistance would make him a viable operator. (I think that actually might make him too powerful, so a balance might be semi flashbang resistance, so he can still be flash, but it would make appear as though it happened really far away so it is much easier to fight against). I think he would do much better with the MP7 than the MPX, just because the MPX is garbage. I think the Vector might be a better fit for him because, as it stands, he is the only defensive 3 armor op who doesn't have an acog and it make him useless in gunfights.
---
Just looking at the way Joystick destroyed them, it must be Kanto's account. Though everyone knows Kanto's up there as well anyway.
---
True, I fell she should be 3 speed however I feel the MP5SD doesn‚Äôt fit her, what about her getting the C75 Auto... now that sounds crazy for a primary but it‚Äôs got such a quick kill time it really can compete with other primary‚Äôs, and its not too loud, just a random thought
---
They looking into it for more than 8 months now. Thrs ubisoft forum thread too  asking abt it. And I have started anew thread with pictures recently and they didnt care to even to reply to that. I don't know why they locked India to buy credits. But show us all ads and skins. :/
---
Idk why yall expect Ubisoft to listen to anything you guys say or ask for.
---
‚Ä¢They are nerfing warden
---
‚Ä¢Adding an acog to a 2 armor 2 speed
---
‚Ä¢Nerfing shields again for no reason when there fine as is
---
‚Ä¢And now there adding a battlepass that no one knows is season pass holders are gettin it for free or they are going to have to pay for something again
---
‚Ä¢And they have yet to fix most of the bugs that plague this game and fix the horrendous hitreg 
---
‚Ä¢ and they are keeping the shitty maps in ranked when people want them gone
---
Ubisoft doesnt listen for shit stop acting surprised when they do shit like this
---
no
---
She should be able to run while using her gadget. 
---
As of now, there no reason to pick her over IQ who can take out hidden cams/drones/gu mines before crouch walk around to be as silent as Nokk.
---
I think giving him an acog and the ability to move while seeing through smoke would be too powerful but one or the other would probably work
---
Thanks for the recommendation.  I only play on PC for the new season Technical Test Server. I primarily play on PS4, and unfortunately there are not nearly as many customizable options.
---
I think consulte is the best map ever.
---
Nuuuuu bad boyee
---
The bright and distinguishable red colouring just reminded me of TF2, like the MvM Manhattan map but if it was a PVP mode.
---
What are you taking about theme park is far worse than fortress it's awfil
---
Hello thedarkloon, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Yup. Top 3 siege youtubers right here
---
If the top floor site didn't exist it would be a lot better. It's just complete luck to win an attack up there and even if you do win you have to attack up there again.
---
I'm going to get the SSG skin for Echo (press F for Redeemer). I'm not particularly a fan of SSG but I like the operator and how the skin looks.
---
I would totally buy a Sackboy Banana costume charm...
---
this too, people also like to pull the "muh realism" card. since when has a visor that can pinpoint your location by looking at your footprints or a ball that can blast you backwards realistic?
---
Speak for yourself pls
---
Although her ability is a problem,
---
If she won‚Äôt get ACOG make her 3 speed and more silent which I think is the better choice here, then she will see some more pickrate
---
It's part of a logo...
---
:)
---
my only concern is if Ubisoft isn't representing the nationality of the CTU by not using the actual guns run by that nation's CTU. like if Mexico was using a gun not put into Siege yet, I would have liked it included. If Mexico was just using some american made weapons imported or replicated - than I'm fine with Ubisoft recycling.
---
Meh, maybe its a good thing. If you don't know, they'll be releasing a Battle Pass in few months and its gonna be another CASH GRAB by all means. Even though I have the Year 4 Pass, they won't give it for free to pass holders.
---
Having the currency-lock assures me I can't spend money on another big money grab by game devs.
---
I agree the new top floor is worse than old hereford top floor
---
"*but other games can do that too"*
---
yea other games that are dying because of their shitty balancing politic.
---
I was a silver 3 but apparently I played with a hacker so I got put down to silver 4
---
Fuuuck of course it's legendary... Ubi please bless me with good luck.
---
\^ \^ \^ this. well put. couldn't have said it better myself.
---
I've had people complain about realism so much before and they never rethink the old ops for realism
---
I‚Äôm glad Frost will be getting her shield back but I wish Mute would as well
---
Ranked is for competitive gameplay it is meant to be balanced removing most of the non ok besides Oregon and maybe chalet would make it more balanced and fair.
---
God I despise that map, skyscraper is meh to me but I hate fortress with every bone in my body
---
Skyscraper is personally my Favourite map.
---
That sounds horrible. It‚Äôs a secondary gun that has been criticized for last couple of years for being difficult to see through.
---
I like the toxicity change they are going to implement this season. Now squads cant kill one guy every round and laugh about it without consequences, also the mmr limit of who can group with who will stop people abusing the ranked queue.
---
Biggest changes so far.
---
I give up.
---
You're mentally challenged.
---
I got my platinum charm last. There was 4 hours between getting my first and last one.
---
Exactly. We don't want another Lion so I have no problem with ops that are similar to other ops
---
I play him, iq, hib, and nomad the most. I think nomad is also an underrated attacker. Her traps are great for run outs, site denial and defuse denial.
---
are we gonna talk about how some people don‚Äôt use the search bar before posting
---
U right u right
---
what's the difference? Once you put old hereford in ranked, it stops being 'fun' and people will start bitching back about it, like &gt; its legit torture to defend in hereford! Only 1 staircase! Too many windows!., and the list keeps on going.
---
Personally I think it looks hella dope but I would never give money to buy cosmetics because I am already a brokwe ass bitch
---
Explain pls
---
Soon they will not!
---
Maxim Pom Pom QF - 1 pounder autocannon. Thats my bet at least. Basicaly enlarged Maxim HMG. Used as infantry gun and AA gun. But the shield and carriage its mounted on ingame is I think made up.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with fortress
---
What‚Äôs wrong with theme park? Is it just severely unbalanced? Is personally really enjoy that map
---
Yes and that‚Äôs the solution I want to see.
---
Make her 3 Speed and able to run while using her gadget. Turn her into the fastest and quietest Attacker similar to how Cav in Defense. 
---
That‚Äôs the only justification for her having zero utility and a weak gun.
---
I don‚Äôt get it it‚Äôs way better than the SMG 12 and 11 no joke it sounds horrible but is an idea that really could work maybe give it red dot and a reflex and a few muzzles and it will be a primary weapon pretty much no lie
---
The elites where you bring an object into the area to flex (like Bandit's motorcycle on the roof of Tower) aren't really my cup of tea tbh. I have yet to see a regular victory pose with mira with sound and everything but it looks like she doesn't really do anything interesting
---
Yes, check the fashion sub or Rogue9 video about the season.
---
Explain, in detail, how Amaru/Goyo are any different than other ops aesthetically.
---
Dude, it's the most important match in all of competitive r6 (after the S.I. grand final), of course he plays the operator he is best with - even more so because J√§ger's ads are damn important.
---
He could play Vigil or any other roamer and would still destroy most players but he doesn't have to prove himself by doing it against G2.
---
Use the lmg, just being able to spray like that is insane, easiest prefire in the world.
---
I feel bro hahah
---
Time to snuggle up with echo behind his shield
---
Skyscraper is great wdym
---
Most weapons in game are not licenced and their models are not even right/they are hybrids,people are mad that no new content updates have been here and they broke the game with new"fixes".
---
The community is mad and has the right to be becouse they are thriving with money and handeling the game like an indie dev.
---
90% of the players leave when they spawn in in most of my games. Its pretty funny tbh
---
They didn‚Äôt address switching servers specifically.
---
You probably don't remember when they firstly showed premium packs with Outbreak collection, outrage was so big they deleted all threads about it and forced people to give "feedback" on one thread only. However they "forgot" to take down posts with positive accents about new mechanic. So yeah, old dog won't learn new tricks.
---
Devs have said that they make Elite skins when they get an idea for one. No point in people asking for a Lion elite for example when they have ideas for Finka, Dokk, Vigil and not him.
---
This just happened to me in a match, a guy killed someone because he literally jumped in front of him, then he tried to kick him, failed, he tried to tk, failed, got tk'd and he left the game and we won, karma served
---
Ela is 33. She was born in 1985 and her operator card hasn't changed. She was 31 at release but it's been 2 years since. But I don't know, maybe Ubisoft fucking with another thing that didn't need to be changed.
---
Skull rain was by far worse then this. You literally could not play two games without a cheater. This was before battleeye was implemented
---
Who matchmakes th? It's solo or with friends. Who cares if I wanna shoot my mate in the face for memes so I thirst that last kill.
---
Some more 2 speed defenders could be getting Acogs... on semi-automatic weapons. A bizarre statement considering there aren't any besides the TCSG12 and the BOSG (which doesn't really matter since Vigil is a 3 speed).
---
Or Nomad?
---
Yeah lol, he was already my best friend but now we getting close
---
Yeah i think it gives you more access to the building than the first situation.
---
I think you're talking about the one from the last Halloween event. It's not obtainable anymore but might be returning and purchasable this year (since they brought old Halloween items back last year)
---
If they don't get rid of that battle pass that'll ruin the game significantly, it will create a bigger gap between the lower income and higher income player base
---
Go look into steam op ideas
---
By then she‚Äôs better off receiving a new gun and that cannot be done without massively buffing Dokk and Vigil who also has that weapon.
---
They‚Äôre from Europe and they‚Äôre abusing the rank system by smurfing on a different server.
---
I guess..
---
Are you blind mate
---
Yeah it would be cool if she did something with her Mira or like her Weapon or something crazy like Thermite‚Äôs fire hands still I do like the look of her Elite
---
well eu on ps4 is fucked ddos literally destroyed it and pc is better than console if we talk about booters (there are less booters) but i agree with you mnk isn't really a big problem and only noobs complain about it tbh
---
I guess
---
Cause I‚Äôm gonna get them first this time I swear!
---
I cannot see the server location in that pic, my bad.
---
Grind terrorist hunt. Ranked even at higher ranks has almost no strategy and is just people gunning. Get your aim better because teammates arent gonna give a shit about doing strategies. And treat every situation as a 1v5, dont rely on teammates for anything.
---
Not the best but it looks good
---
I still get lost in skyscraper sometimes (TÔºøT)
---
Should‚Äôve made him a 3 speed and made Warden a 2 speed.
---
We were in the EUS, but I‚Äôm fairly certain they were from LATAM.
---
i would love to see a defending op that can give the team supplies like a smoke or flash that way warden can be effective if played right and he wouldn't be as useless like he is now.
---
We all deal with ddosers its jist something we have to deal with
---
No mt friend wanted it to be a nazi uniform
---
Yes, but lots of people hated it when it first released.
---
Not anymore they aren‚Äôt. They have to win DH Montreal or Japan now to qualify
---
Her drone can, moron
---
Hereford wasn‚Äôt a rework. It was a brand new map that they gave the name Hereford to.
---
The good thing about an actual rework is you can take a bad map, find the things that are working, trim the garbage, and address the key issues. You‚Äôre working from an existing template, reducing dev time and increasing the odds of success. This is also why I think new Hereford wound up being so defender sided, they effectively made a new map from scratch so they didn‚Äôt have an actual starting point to work from.
---
Actually that's probably not a great philosophy. I know it sounds cheesey but it's better to experiment yourself and see what feels best for you
---
you'd rather have half decent maps and half shitty maps overall? id say rework first then add new maps after when all other maps are viable
---
I play in the Gold 1 - Plat 2 range, my friend. I gather about 10-13 kills a game when I‚Äôm doing well or exceptional. (To my standards anyways) 
---
Although, I never claimed to be good. I am just proud of myself and what I‚Äôve done. 
---
However, fhank you for your encouragement! I will definitely keep the grind up!
---
I played this muted but could still hear the intro music
---
Should just make it a toggle option. So when you lean while adsing when you un-ads you‚Äôre still leaning.
---
This is gameplay from the Raleigh Finals I believe, so the computers there probably weren‚Äôt the best
---
I didn't say it should be a battlepass reward, just the free and early access as a bonus for owning the pass.
---
Still not as bad as Hereford base
---
This season is great, i cant complain. Nokk sucked though, wish they would change that. 
---
I dont mind reused guns, just needs to be good guns.
---
The map reminds me of a horror game. Looks like hell to play that dark but for this video it looks really cool
---
Theres going to be maps that certain people dont like, some maps are going to be boring and lack strats (fortress, theme park) every fps is going to have this problem but because ubisoft is willing to rework maps (which is a good thing in a game like seige) it seems like every bad map "needs to be reworked" skyscaper has always been a very solid map to me, each objective is different and requires a different approach and ive never heard any complaints about it but now that what im assuming is a streamer or pro league player said its bad suddenly everyone thinks its bad, which is another problem with seige, what streamers and pro league say about ops, guns, maps, etc carry way too much weight and influence not only the devs stance on things but also their thousands of followers opinions and is not always best for the general enjoyment of the game
---
Its copper for me most of the time xD
---
I‚Äôd take theme park and Fortress over Skyscraper and Chalet for ranked!
---
This is probably the best post I‚Äôve ever seen on this sub.
---
Don't. We didn't tell you to stop playing, that attitude is dangerous. My tips are not negativity, exactly the opposite. I want you to improve but you aren't thunt or playing correctly. If you want to improve then you need to listen, block out negativity but differentiate between positive criticism and toxicity.
---
i fucked up
---
i got it
---
Untill a sreamer or youtubers comes by and says something bad about another map that is
---
yep
---
&gt;The licensing part makes sense tho. But couldn't we just use fictional names for weapons if that were an issue?
---
They already do. AR33 is the HK33, SMG-11 &amp; 12 are MAC-10s, they don't refer to the Desert Eagle or Ameli by name.
---
It will scan both rook and recruit so jackal would be confused that a 3 armour would be able to run that far
---
This also shows that recruit mains are big brain
---
I dont think generic WW2 skins have a big connection to the lore of the characters other than the country.
---
Thanks for the guide!  I plan on watching YouTube videos and Twitch for research.  And I was thinking the same, I gotta learn the call outs.  I don‚Äôt mind the difficulty so long as it‚Äôs fair gameplay.
---
I have the same birthday as Mozzie ! Nice.
---
Fov while playing would definitely be the main issue hahah I doubt it‚Äôs actually an issue of enough power but rather lack of motivation from Ubisoft to actually add this kind of feature
---
Oh well, I don't know how console is but you seem to be Gold 2 this season :) If doesn't matter if it works, when you can do it better! Try peeking faster and using peekers advantage to yourself, you will see improvement rapidly.
---
That's actually deep
---
I joined same time like 2 months after kaid and nomad were released and it might be just me playing to much but the best way which worked for me was playing with people who were better and learning from them and now because of that I'm a plat 3 with a 1.2 kd
---
mp5k has a little more recoil, and attachment differences.
---
\*Transcript incoming...\*
---
I want to see that ela buff
---
I get that but since I always buy about everything they offer it doesn‚Äôt affect me as much
---
Gl
---
This is your fault. You knew you were droned out and you didn‚Äôt re-position yourself. Even standing or prone would have saved you. If there was no peekers advantage, defenders could hold tight angles on doorways and attackers would never able to enter the site. Understand the mechanics of the game and act accordingly
---
If only americans could watch this
---
I was watching a bunch of old winglet sfms and then the coreross video came up and I saw that side of the map and thought it was a custom tf2 map before I actually read the title
---
Every castle main
---
You gotta allow some fiction, just like Valkyrie, Peruvian Special Forces don‚Äôt have women in their lineups so there‚Äôs no real way to rule out her uniform.
---
Plus, you‚Äôll be able to change her with skins as they as released to probably something more tactical if you wish.
---
K copper
---
I know your pain
---
Okay, let's see what the damage is here.
---
still 3 speed and 51 mags is far better to rush with
---
Thanks for the feedback, I‚Äôll work on peeking!
---
I would think you would rather use smoke than kaid but it's just a quess
---
Any word on the release date yet? All I see is its going live on test servers today.
---
Gadget: common sense
---
&gt;be op

&gt;try to farm karma with a low effort plague doctor picture

&gt;get a few upvotes

&gt;actually an asshole

---

---
If you're overshooting your targets, turn down your sensitivity, even if it feels slow. Tracking your targets is more important than flicking, flicking will come the more you play.
---
Kinda new to siege on pc but if I don‚Äôt have the year 4 pass can I still play the new ops on the test server
---
Should have done a c4 and detonated it for the ending instead of the drone
---
I LOVE that they made casual into a playlist of only maps that aren‚Äôt in ranked. I do wish they threw Bartlett U back in there though.
---
I mean, ‚ÄúEye patch and crossbow‚Äù Capitao and Skull Facepaint lady that stabs your neck are not ‚Äúcomic book like‚Äù I dunno what the double standard here is.
---
This is some top tier shit right here
---
Reinstall I‚Äôd say. If only you gave more info...
---
Very true.
---
While that may be true, at least we Brits proved we could maintain an empire for at least a time, whereas the USA has never attempted it, for fear of failure
---
"More information will be available then". Ehh then I know my season pass doesnt include the battle one already :(
---
Should be three weeks from when the TTS goes live
---
Should be 3 weeks from TTS launch, i think
---
Wrong
---
Let me say it again. It was said By Pengu, Fabian and Kanton when they played Fortress on stream.
---
You clearly are very pro at the game and should definitely join PL if you think you can handle bad maps
---
PRAISE TACHANKA
---
People have been using data limits as an excuse for seige for YEARS don't play that game with me they add new shit EVERY SEASON you can't tell me there isn't enough data to add a few new weapons as well get out of her with those weak ass excuses.
---
I myself used to be so good with kaid and his shotty but I just got worse with it and lots of times in case I find myself memeing with hibana rushing obj with super and it somehow worked so I'm all excited for these weapons
---
How the hell is that angled grip gonna work if the grips are on the side for her lmg
---
This thing better be free for season pass owners
---
Should be up in an hour or so
---
None of the operators were alive during ww1, yet we have ww1 elite skins for other ops (doc, jager, etc.)
---
I play with those who are better then me a lot of the time. In ranked I normally hit Gold 2 or Gold 1 and average out a 1.1 K/D. My competition is normally Gold 1 - Plat 2. Was two games off of plat last season. 
---
But alas, this is simply a terrorist hunt video.
---
[deleted]
---
This hyped me up for the new season, I made one stupid huge mistake that cost me a ranked match at the beginning of season 2 and it annoyed me so much I left the game and haven't been back since. I would have gotten my first PC gold rank with that.
---
But this has really got me pumped up
---
It got angled grip which makes it viable
---
yes it has e good fire rate
---
After a LOT of casual. The newcomer playlist only teaches you 3 maps in the ranked playlist. Casual will give you all of the ranked maps and some maps that are unbalanced. The ranked environment is easier to learn in than the casual one because of the fact that a lot more people are actually trying and the lobbies wont be as random. However, casual doesnt impact your records and is the better place to teach the basics like gun skill and the rooms around sites. You don't really learn the advanced stuff in casual unless you are watching youtubers or streamers in the higher ranks.
---
Oh I didn't know you had 13 hours played with him already
---
Oh no. 
---
House and Presidential plane are out of any rotations.
---
How could they?
---
You can do custom matchmaking in thunt to deside the mode you play and the map 
---
Protect hostage is defense
---
Classic t hunt is attack
---
Defuse bomb is also attack
---
And rescue hostage is atack
---
Could there have possibly been Frag nerfs that could account for 2 more operators getting them?
---
Or maybe they only start with 1 frag?
---
So you‚Äôre saying the other operators with old-school elite cosmetics were just pulling those uniforms out of their closets? 
---
Doc: ‚ÄúHey, it still fits!‚Äù
---
well spend em xd
---
okay great. I wish there was something like that on r6 but I shall try with Thunt.
---
They're removing the horrible maps and keeping the good or at least decent ones.
---
NO MORE BOMBERS OR NITRO CELL ROOMS LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
---
They're really not that bad. Smg-11 is definitely primary weapon material.
---
&gt;To start off the season, the maps that are being cycled out of Casual are: House, Presidential Plane, Yacht, Favela, Theme Park and Tower.
---
Bye house, your crazy casual matches will be missed
---
Really? That would be about time.
---
They can balance ops simply by changing secondary‚Äôs, gadget and secondary gadget
---
Lmaooo i felt this
---
Very suspicious
---
I noticed that too lol
---
Though you can have a kapkan combo to set it off as well so if someone vaults, sets off kapkan trap and then goyo trap
---
Well I play Glaz a lot, and smokes aren't the most helpful with him. Most players, especially in mid gold ranks, won't peek a smoked off hallway unless they're a god at predictions like beaulo or something, or they're a pro Warden and have a good gaming chair. Frags will help now, because tossing a drag at someone gets them to get up. Then you start shooting at them and watch them dance for you.
---
Jager is the new hot ban when I‚Äôm attacking first üòé
---
No. I paid for her elite skin and I can‚Äôt use it because of how trash the gadget is
---
This so much.
---
Their design philosophy of making cooldown abilities standardized and more controllable doesn't apply to Warden for some weird reason...
---
Same with Goyo, a 2 speed having an ACOG on defense...
---
If you win all 3 def you wont have to worry
---
I watched over 25 hours but i received cooper and bronze charm
---
They want to avoid any issues it could possibly bring up. Copyright law changes country to country and is constantly changing so in the future it could be an issue.
---
No, I think I might üôÉ
---
Then theres a fourth, which is a week i think,and then maybe it resets
---
[So you can now unlock elite skins with renown ???](http://prntscr.com/ouqa8t)
---
Ubi can‚Äôt do anything they rent servers so it‚Äôs not their liability. Plus it‚Äôs a felony which seems to concern no one (a thing I personally do not understand)
---
Bull crap mate when people complained about not getting anew map every operation people claimed data limits, when players complained about the crappy reworks and how they didn't make maps any better, data limits "there's only so much they can do with the map because of data limits" now players are upset we are getting reused assets DATA LIMITS GTFO with that crap man they do massive updates and add completely new items EVERY SEASON and yet when we call them out on thier lazy business they instantly go to DATAS LIMITS. come on bro get your head out of the sand data limits is just and excuse for "we didn't want to put forth the effort so we reused assets."
---
I agree.  My MMR often ranges \~1000 points within a season and more than that from season to season.
---
The unlucky hipfire

U can get the Ubisoft club app

Shotgun is popular on consoles
---
I'm nervous
---
That's my boi karate kid.
---
was most likely added manually to remind them it hadn't been paid for you yet. they use it in a way that doesn't show any parts of the watermark so the manual one as a reminder makes sense.
---
It says there were 20 maps in the casual playlist, and there will now be 14. However the Siege wiki says there are 22 maps in the game. What ones were already not in the rotation? 
---
Sorry if that‚Äôs a dumb question, I am a bit new to the game and I can‚Äôt find an answer anywhere
---
Honestly? Don't sleep on it, Glaz's gun is still a monster with or without smokes to see through.
---
Just 130h?
---
When does this release for PS4?
---
Be gentle please
---
yeah but what about gettting matched against platinum/diamond 5 stack in unranked playlists where those tryhards will still clap our asses ,where is the fix for that?
---
So to be able to have a clean record you need to do more offenses? That is crazy. I thought they wore out or something.
---
I knew a kid who wore one on picture. He was an absolute mad lad, and honestly, you have to respect that courage
---
Having a night mode makes it harder. Play better and it'll be easy
---
My first ever ranked kd was about 0.13 and with nearly a thousand hours I crawled up to 1.73 but I cannot go any further which sucks but a smurf is always nice to flex your kd
---
The operators don't flinch when shot in PvP, and flinching terrorists don't make for good practice.
---
I love the 417 on Lion. I‚Äôm very happy
---
What lol literally depens on how much they play. Could be diamond, could be bronze
---
Can we stop crying over them reusing guns?
---
The change is being implemented next season so you'll be fine for now
---
what?
---
Oh ...
---
i was about to say
---
ah

This software is a paid product. $60 for the game, $30 for a season pass every year, $XX amount on elite skins and other cosmetics. 
---
Ubisoft is a company that needs to make money, yes. What bothers me and a lot of other folks are cash grabs like battle passes and overpriced event cosmetics, but little investment in quality of life improvements to the core game. When companies prioritize making ~more~ money over improving the product people have ~already~ paid for, people have a right to be upset. 
---
This ‚Äúwe should be grateful‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople are entitled‚Äù attitude is ridiculous. When someone spends money on something they have every right to have expectations of a solid product. 
---
R6 has generated over a billion dollars (Billion, with a B) for Ubisoft, but the game is littered with game breaking bugs. I love this game. I‚Äôve spent around $200 on it since its release and have been happy to do it. But I totally understand people being tilted over this company pushing out more revenue generators to make their shareholders happy, but not improving the product.
---
I am in a few months master. Got a lil saving to do
---
i just don‚Äôt like how you would
---
have to pay money for the higher end stuff every season. especially if i have the season pass, that is to much to pay
---
Just 130, mhm!
---
Cool. Glhf.
---
So damn true. Meta in this game would have evolved so nicely if ela was still alive when Original lion was introduced.
---
1. Yes, at around 120-144 fps depending on what card you have
---
2. If you have enough money then definitely buy deluxe, its not worth buying r6 credits after
---
3. It‚Äôs gonna take like 6-12 months for you to get there if this is the first game you ever played on pc, but if not, then you can really hit the ground running and hop in silver
---
I‚Äôll take your entire stock!
---
brooooo keep plane
---
Funny statements.
---
Material isn‚Äôt shit can confirm. Good quality and custom made. Get double sided of any two operators for $75
---
And the point of it is?
---
Well she loses barbed this coming season so that blows
---
I don't want to sound vicious but once you hit puberty 2-3 hours daily is monstrual amount of time. Most of adult R6 players play only on weekends, considering they try to keep their job, 8 hour sleep routine and social life alive.
---
I missed the stream. Not sure.
---
i‚Äôm neither for or against it. i really don‚Äôt care. i just don‚Äôt get why people are so upset about it. you don‚Äôt have to buy it and it‚Äôs not hurting anything.
---
Make him a 3 speed 3 armor with a .5 deploy time and I'll be happy
---
But seriously that's great I can't wait to bully the enemy team from above even more

OPINION. Take it or leave it.
---
not really if something is bad/broken it should be removed and fix regardless of the mode that's how every serious game does things
---
"Data limits" is code for "we screwed around for a month and didn't have enough time to add in new guns so we reused assets" the devs even admitted this season that they originally had completely diffent weapons for nook and Warden but because they couldn't get them done in the three month deadline for the new season they completely scrapped them and reused assets LAZINESS they didn't do what they were suppose to and had to scramble to get weapons on those operators and the same thing is happening this season.
---
Okay thanks.
---
Probably because most people own the stuff for it
---
Well said.
---
Look at my name
---
The limit of rank difference will be 1000 according to the patch notes
---
i think you have it the other way around. I think most people think Montagne is broken and Blitz is not. Though, an operator doesnt have to be underpowered or overpowered to warrant Ubisoft to change them. Some times, operators just ruin the gameplay and feel of Siege even if they arent technically broken
---
Yeah the defenders win if you trade now
---
But at least in the case of Glaz there‚Äôs an actual decision to make where frags aren‚Äôt guaranteed to be the best pick. Same with Dokkaebi.
---
Ooohooohooo, big problem. I've killed plenty of spies, they're dime a dozen backstabbing scumbags, like you.
---
Ow... No offense.
---
its probably "replace" because the visuals are also getting changed, from the weird sparkly embers to just straight up fire
---
What doesn't mean it isn't true? The fact that he said it? And how is that relevant to anything lmao? You don't make decisions on stuff based on what isn't demonstrably false, you make it on what is demonstrably true. If I say I'm a billionaire you won't believe me just because you can't prove I'm not lying.
---
I like that you just spray everywhere. I couldnt have done it better either
---
Of course its competitive. Anytime you are pitching yourself against anyone whether it be for fun or whatever, its inherently competetive. How competitive is the factor here.
---
Doki was the last person that needed a buff
---
lol well the older cpu/gpu will run at a higher usage trying to run the newer game lol, yeah i'm just sayin it doesn't correlate to fps like if it's 50% compared to 80% usage
---
The 417 is a terrible gun, one of the worst in the game.  Even without the Acog the F2 is a million times better.
---
PRAISE THE SUN!
---
I'm out of the loop. People are against the BP here?
---
Probably, im not sure, plus since the reverse tk system got out it is really hard to be banned for killing offense unless you use a grenade or something to kill two or more friendlies at the same time, so i havent got to that point yet and you might need yo look that up yourself
---
Nope, not really. You can actually see the mat now through slits in the shield.
---
Check the patch notes for the new season! Diamonds no longer to que with anyone who is under Plat
---
I find that pretty stupid as well mate. Instead solving an existing problem they remove problem entirely. House and plane were my casual chillout maps.
---
Is that a jojo reference? /s
---
Interesting. Maybe it somehow say you were AFK after a while. I refresh my page once in a while when it says I'm away on Twitch.
---
Google "siege n√∏kk fandom wiki". All quotes on that site.

Behind shields
---
After seeing gameplay, the angled grip is underneath the gun, I guess there's still rails under it for attachments I never noticed

It's funny because they pretty much said they were working on a fix, and yesterday came out with "the fix" which pretty much didn't do anything but increase ban times for people who leave games

Why do you think this is dumb? It should, in theory, put an end to plat/diamond players carrying copper players or otherwise ruining other players' matches
---
You know that some search results are based on your search history?

Probably before the prompt shows up; I don't see how it would work for the distance since when you vault ONTO an object, you are simply getting ontop of it, which doesn't require 2m in most cases.

Because battle passes are a plague. They're generally overpriced, they make you pay for the OPPORTUNITY to earn content through an obscene grind, they stop making content for anything outside the battle pass, and if you don't play 30+ hours a week of the game you'll miss out on all the cool shit that will then disappear forever.
---
Not to mention the obscene amount of monetization strategies already in this game.
---
Alright . looks like this window would be a problem for any Mira mains in this room
---
Fax, damn I didn‚Äôt even know he couldn‚Äôt move to see through it, he‚Äôs basically a sitting duck for glaz
---
Yeah, but the fact that the map pool is being reduced for a game mode that doesn't matter is bs in my opinion. Plus yacht, favela, and themepark and gone for at least two months then.
---
Dont forget about disabled sights
---
I never really had the problem with the lighting on Theme Park after the update which increased the light on it, but that could just be me. However interms of balance and viable sites Skyscraper is terrible and does a terrible job of being competitive.
---
Lmao im a gold player and have gotten 16 kills a game before, how is this guy diamond
---
Kill more people and don‚Äôt die
---
RIP
---
Yeah. Free stuff as long as I can fit in 30+ hours of this game a week. Otherwise it's just a ton of new, cool content I have no access too.
---
*SSundee intensifies*
---
PM me for the rest of the base game icons, and more when I make them.
---
I try to, sometimes I‚Äôm shocked at how many people fail to understand basic stuff like this.
---
this might of been the same last season but i didn't try last seasons tts
---
That‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôs catching a nerf because his ar does more damage at close range and his pdw did more at longer ranges lol
---
Well theme park is for sure gonna come back to casual and ranked because it is getting a rework
---
Mira is one of the most banned ops in Pro leauge and is a very viable and useful operator to Siege and any defensive team along with Jackel being very strong at what he does. Lesion is good for both trapping areas and gathering intel with his Gus. Mozzie is excilent at drone denial and intel gathering and was used a lot in this seasons pro leauges. That's just four off the top of my head that I can think of right now but I do somwhat agree with you as the base operators and year 1 characters cover a lot of ground.
---
Saw them, but thank you!
---
Is the bomber Japanese he has that kamikaze headband

Hello 1nfin1tus,

Right, left, right, right, left......

I‚Äôd rather play against the 100+ ping guys than the 9 ping fuckers
---
Oh true, I forgot about that one.
---
Nice clip. Awful caption
---
ah, I get the context of your words more clearly now.
---
this
---
I think the appropriate nerf would be on the F2 mag size. They should change it to 25 rounds to fit the mag model.
---
Glaz Is the worst attacker right now.
---
Whatever helps ya man. ))
---
God, their adding a fucking battle pass to Rainbow Six. What depths have we sunk to
---
Because if you really wanna remember we‚Äôre getting FREE content besides the FREE operators and the FREE maps and I never said that event packs would die, all I said was that the FOMO effect would take place and then it would encourage people to drop more than $100 on cosmetics where as a battlepass we‚Äôd have to drop maybe $30 at most and we know what we‚Äôd be getting off the battlepass VS. RNG for the event packs that‚Äôll literally go between a 1-100 odds of getting something you want and if you want anything else you‚Äôd need to either again drop $60-$100+ on R6 credits alone to buy the event packs or at least do one challenge that‚Äôll force you to play the event if you wanted that extra pack
---
The IDF wont get added to siege, they're to busy curb stomping Palestinian children.

Hello MistaHollow, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

ok boomer

Why in the hell would you ever replace Maestro‚Äôs shield?
---
Why?
---
As a new player I have no idea why this game doesn't allow you to choose which map to queue in ranked like in CSGO. Always wanted to filter out Skyscraper and Theme Park.
---
At the very least they should give the option to limit the maps to the competitive map pool (played at pro level).
---
F in chat

I do do that it just hasn‚Äôt had any effect

Well look to average 10 kills a game with zero deaths, do a little math and how long would it take you to get from where you are now to a 1.0 KD.  This isn‚Äôt rocket science here
---
Where are we looking rn
---
Yeh, but only 1000mmr maxim is way too restritive, even me, a low gold, will not be able to play with my plat and diamond friends.
---
Never disappoints!

How do you decide who to kill
---
I'm not sure then, take it to ubi's support I guess
---
That Twitch must have been mad
---
Mira's elite skin looks like black widow
---
I‚Äôm honestly just glad they didn‚Äôt make another war one, I like the ones that they‚Äôd actually wear during training or day to day stuff, they never fought in those wars and the colours are so bland compared to smoke and bandit‚Äôs elites for instance. Also you‚Äôd see his beak a mile away if he had a plague doctor elite.

Sometimes they say nothing. I move on. But here and there you'll get those players (from kids to adults) that will explode on the mic. Send you death threats/Call you every insult under the sun for 10 minutes. Fun to listen to.
---
I can concede that the insane event pack prices far outweigh the negatives of the battle pass, but that doesn't negate the negatives of the battle pass
---
Listen
---
You can spam the Russian shotgun way faster and it does a lot more damage it needs some kind of buff
---
the immense amount of effort to open a wall guarded by bandit is extreme this will probably just reduce the number of EMPs needed to open walls. This wouldn't be a bad change imo might just raise the skill gap for bandit tricking against an uncoordinated team.

good catch

Glaz too lul

I already bought a season pass, if Ubi expects me to shell out even more for a battle pass along with a lot of shitty changes this season then I‚Äôll just move on to another game.
---
So does the acs12
---
Well Tachanka got bullet resistant glass on his turret and now Mira is hanging out with a vintage machine gun. MirChanka 'ship confirmed
---
What was that noise at the end of the clip? A growl?
---
I ask who has a  mic. First person to talk dies. If nobody talks, I kill whoever has a competitive rank. If nobody has a competitive rank, I kill the lowest ranking unsuspecting player
---
Does that actually hurt her?
---
Yes they are linked my ubisoft says it is
---
"Additionally, when a player leaves a Ranked or Unranked match, other playlists will be locked while the match they quit is ongoing."
---
Well, then they better fix the glitch where you can't reconnect sometimes after being booted from a ranked game. Only fix is to enter a casual, quit, and reconnect to ranked...
---
So let‚Äôs get this straight... Mira gets a not relevant to her background Spanish Civil War elite?
---
But smoke gets an elite that looks like it comes standard with a grande soy milk macchiato latte or vape gadget canisters?  Because it is relevant to his backstory.
---
That‚Äôs a bunch of bullshit.
---
It's for dyslexic people.
---
Are you high? Honest question.
---
&gt; Everyone in 2019 got a ping below 70. 
---
Yeah, okay, sure.
---
&gt; Why rainbow does not make a ping limit of 80 or 90?
---
Yeah because honestly fuck people who want to play this game who don't live in the EU or USA, or "first world countries".
---
&gt; After the game is finished the just delete the file. So they win their rankeds.
---
&gt; Hitregistration is bad af and the peekers advantage is unbelievable.

Why isn‚Äôt sledge the new 6 aka the leader and planner of team rainbow the original 6 was that black lady in the opening cutscene was when you first got the game however she retired and now we have the psychologist if you watched the short cgi movie you will know about who I‚Äôm talking about
---
Gridlock and cap don't have the same gun though
---
So hes fuzying
---
How does using a XIM help you play with your friends? There is no correlation between them.

i mean,they might soon add a cosmetic with him having hair and without the helmet.

Maybe he also always keeps the helmet like tachanka always wears one

---
This makes no sense. You didn‚Äôt buy the season pass for the battle pass. The whole point of this is to make money. I know people just dislike the idea of battle passes but I feel like y‚Äôall are acting a bit entitled.
---
Ubi, let's talk. The annoucement video has a 2:1 dislike to like ratio. I own the season pass for year 4, and while I'm glad to say you haven't taken away from my purchase (for this year anyway), this is blatant bullshit. People paid to play your videogame. Yes, its a single payment for an ongoing service, but don't pretend that Siege isn't getting more players with every season that passes. You are making money from the sales of this game and you recently cut the budget version of this game, let alone started moving toward free to play. Moreover, each season is less and less work for you. You aren't releasing new weapons, and you've swapped from new maps to reworked maps. While I agree with both of those in principle, it does mean that you do not have a rising cost to develop either. Microtransaction loot boxes is one thing. I can turn a blind eye to it since you need continuous revenue to justify the updates. I can even accept that limited time updates with limited time cosmetics is a way to justify those updates. But this is ridiculous. Do not do this. Do not become Fortnite. Fortnite is one of the worst, most manipulative games when it comes to hooking into people and making them pay. Kids get bullied for not buying microtransactions in their disgusting store. Linked below is a video analysis of Fortnite's monetization, and it's honestly disgusting how much of it (fake currency, timed item availability, lootbox gambling instead of just pay to use, and now the battlepass system) is already in Rainbow.
---
Don't make me quit this game.

Yeah no doubt, your case is just you honestly playing with a friend, you shouldn't feel bad for anything.
---
The majority of the time though is people purposely boosting, and the lower ranked guy is usually actually a higher rank that purposely went down.
---
Fake footprints would be a funny counter to Jackal.

I personally have a very low ping of about nine, but it gets me every time I see the shield fail.

Because he just isn‚Äôt?  Yeah he‚Äôs smart, yeah he‚Äôs capable, but... what?  For whatever reason (probably the lack of punctuation) I just cannot follow what you‚Äôre explaining.
---
I completely agree, I‚Äôm just saying while I notice the new guns when they drop, after a month or two they make no real difference in my mind while the gadgets are what really shake the meta and keep the game fresh. The strength of a gun changes a lot, but if you have similar strengths not much changes. Switch Jager and Vigil‚Äôs primaries and you still play each of them the exact same, and neither really gets significantly better or worse.
---
Are you 13 years old
---
I'm just saying let players choose on their end what map they don't want to play. If each player or party could veto a map that they can't or don't want to play competitively then ranked becomes more competitive by removing those scenarios.
---
a ton of little holes?

Can anyone confirm if they changed plant and defuse time to 7 seconds?

Yea I should probably do that

What does Microsoft or Sony have to do with the servers Ubisoft chooses to use to host matches? DDoSing is a problem on PC too?.... you sound dumb.
---
No clue. I think it affected ranked too, which I would agree with it being taken out of, but i think we should be able to chose when we play casual.
---
Shield ops are the pussiest characters to use.
---
He‚Äôs probably in the brig of one of the new subs now. If not, I‚Äôm sure Fuze can sniff him out. He‚Äôs got a thing for hostages.

sorry my internet usually takes 4 months to reply and this was  a pre recorded message btw just sayin
---
You can literally knife it
---
If they bring in wall running i'm out
---
I like the way the units is dealing with this but just wish that if the game detected a squad trying to boost it would go off the highest rank in the squad or the mode rank in the squad
---
so basically the PGU acceleration uses your graphics card, so not all of it is used for your game, this can severely lower your frames
---
also, the overlay will use more of your GPU and RAM I believe so lowers ur frames
---
hope that helps
---
But anyway, uh... I dunno.  I‚Äôve never seen Sledge as that leader figure and I guess it wouldn‚Äôt be his type of thing to do.  Wouldn‚Äôt it also be a little unfair for a ‚Äúleader‚Äù to be on your side when everyone else has to go against you?  I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why they keep it to obscure, unimportant characters rather than the actual operators.
---
suddenly everyone would play the first situation 2-3 times
---
Jackal's C7E on release was a lazer that would 3 ahit consistantly, Mora's vector had much less recoil on release, cave's pistol has undergone 2 reworks I believe, it was much stronger on release, if you want to argue the fact that bandit and jager had acogs but those were base operators anyways, Capitao's ar got nerfed hard a while ago, it would consistently 3 shot from nearly any range, frost and valk as mentioned as well as ela, glaz has gone through so many reworks, but at a time he 2 shot any op.
---
I mean technically it had the teams logo painted on but that's it
---
I have a feeling holding trophy room in chalet is about to become impossible with Amaru coming
---
The store is a total ripoff. Ever done any trading in TF2? buying all weapons is like a dollar on the market. Same goes for warframe, though at least warframe gives you something extra for buying from them direct
---
I can get that for you if you would like, I just trimmed it in case you didn't want to see everyhting.
---
Buck, for literally every reason.
---
Unless you like having no discernible ability (shield breaks immediately), with a mediocre gun.
---
Yea i understand but this is just why i think that since they decided to control the boosting this way that it‚Äôs better that the MMR gap be larger than smaller.
---
Guys what am I gonna do if I don't **shill and defend lazy decisions made by my fav game**
---
Who cares that I'm getting less content for the same price in a paid game with lootboxes and season passes???
---
Indeed, And now he‚Äôs here to F**k us! So listen up boy! or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.
---
The smoke elite is poopoo doodoo
---
My question is why do you want to tell him that. How do you know that he is "tryharding."
---
Oh ok. Thanks for clarifying
---
Yea I guess but I‚Äôm just reading off of his bio
---
It is 7s in the tts
---
Honestly I kinda like where he is now. The faster deployment will help for sure, any less time he has to spend vulnerable is good.
---
He‚Äôs a situational pick for sure but I think most people just don‚Äôt know how to use him well. He‚Äôs good at getting out encamped defenders and clearing the objective of traps and gadgets. You don‚Äôt have to get kills with his charges for them to be useful. 
---
I find he works well, even in mid-high plat, on objectives with soft ceilings. Especially if you can get a teammate to back you up, he can clear the objective of most gadgets and use his breaches to open up the ceiling and put pressure on anyone inside
---
M'LORE
---
It would then take away a big aspect of the game because they made rainbow as a very realistic game and in real life bullets don‚Äôt go through your teammates
---
Lol as long as these guys get free trips to events and special treatment they'll defend every shitty decision Ubisoft makes. Sad that their opinions are taken so seriously most of the time too.
---
Are you console?
---
The lesion main flair makes it better

Loss of impacts is sad, but given how powerful the shield is right now, I'd take this for sure.

I know, I know but Microsoft hasn't been helpful in any of this. Now I'm speaking from absolute inexperience but Is there truly no way to detect the DDOS and punish the ones responsible.
---
Oh damn, nice!  That‚Äôs such a good one.
---
Interesting....
---
There's no age limit for team killing. But no, I'm much older than 13. But I play siege so I can be 13.
---
After watching the major I cant help but think warden would be useful for certain specific things like playing server stairs on bank or yellow stairs on consulate, but the upcoming frag grenade meta makes doing any of that suicide.
---
Idk why but sometime I'm with my friend and half of them just get kicked from the match without any reason... Ubisoft being ubisoft
---
It is new fools. Before you would just sit there and the bar would fill up. Now there is an actual animation
---
No u. The hand is new.
---
Hell Smonks current elite is better than if it was a plague doctor. (which wouldnt fit Smonk, but would be better on Doc)
---
That's actually the graffiti smoke left
---
Hand is new tho.
---
Here's my take:New weapons are not completely necessary for the game.BUT, having new weapons keeps the gunfights fresh and different, and if siege wants to live to 100 operators, then they should keep the variety up. Otherwise, there is lesser reason to check out the new operators.
---
The Overlay is off, Im going to try the CPU thing
---
Are you legit saying that we need to rework the concept of addition itself?! Mother of God!
---
Entitled? The season pass is 25 quid, you get one weapon skin and a charm for the year, while the operators get a slightly different coloured uniform. I think it's fair that people who have supported the game with season passes feel a bit miffed that ubisoft is now asking for more money for exclusive cosmetics. It's not entitled to voice a grievance.
---
Ops dont carry over. I think pro league bundles are the only thing carried over
---
Did it get worse or better? I realy couldn't tell

Nobody ever called jackal or glaz OP even when their guns were strong because nobody played them. Jackal, thinking back on it I can agree that I should've added him in my list, but glaz's rifle is a dmr and people have never appreciated dmrs even though all of them can kill in 2-3 shots. Cap's para also got nerfed rather quickly and just because cav's pistol had its damage and range reworked does not mean it was too strong; it was too weak, the damage nerf but range buff was meant to make her better at close range rather than only cqc

I enjoy watching people use the F2 as they empty the entire mag and miss every single shot.
---
Woah! BikiniBodhi blindly supporting Ubi like a shill?? No way!!
---
Thermite, one of the first elites released literally lights his hands on fire. That precedent was never there to begin with.
---
I for one wish that the next operators would have Fuze's AK12. I mainly use Shield on Fuze so I never get to use it. We have almost 100 well known guns in R6 Siege so what else do you want? Weapons made in their respective region only to be a clone of a well known weapon or an original seemingly inferior to what was based on?
---
This is it chief
---
I like map variety in general. It feels like we are going backward in that regard.
---
Hope they extend this and let full stacks play together no matter their MMR and just search based off the higher MMR in the group
---
Lol

Ying was amazing at release, they had to take away her smoke grenades and change her candelas

All minimum. I don't even use 2 GB of video and have 6 haha

Hello olvr_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/csngtv/oc/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.

I get them as well, always get a guy punch. Fuck you ubi, I know I suck but you dont need to slam my face in it.

Yeah lmao this would've never happened if they had any situational awareness. But that's half of the people who play this game so...
---
Who won?

Fook XD

Facts, impacts were a key reason for me using him

i meant like a shotgun blast

Kanal is AIDs and new Kanal doesn‚Äôt seem that much better.

Posting a shitty opinion in an even shittier meme format, great job, keep it up.

Hello gagaronpew, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
One rank? lmfaoo. Diamond, Plat 1, plat 2, and you‚Äôre plat 3. you are almost 1000 elo lower thank him... Bro come on.
---
and people say the new ops suck
---
True. At least his skin is somewhat reasonable
---
And skyscraper has American outlets
---
Where did you get this info ?
---
This would actually be lit to have an operator with an activate switch to suicide bomb proximity attackers
---
It‚Äôs just as bad. I appreciate the devs effort but it still has no place in ranked
---
ITA12"5" instead of ITA12S? Ubi pls
---
This is from dr who
---
Thx
---
yes...? it's still not fun due to the imbalance. either you can't look out of any windows or you can look in them with impunity.
---
Oh well i read a post where people were arguing that they did nothing to the smg 11? Strange. But either way my point still stands that it shouldn‚Äôt have a buff. Otherwise it‚Äôs way too good again.
---
If I had to guess it would count towards unranked
---
Why does jackel get banned every single goddamn time in pick and ban
---
It‚Äôs still interesting to see new ops that use guns that aren‚Äôt really used on the other ops that have them. Like I‚Äôd love to see a new op use the G36c because it‚Äôs a really solid gun, but Ash players almost never use it since it‚Äôs so outclassed by the R4-C. Creating incentive to use underplayed guns already in the game is a decent move imo
---
The season pass was never for maps
---
And on the offchance that a video isn't "le funny meme montage", it's just him trying to be a discount Dunkey.
---
&gt;pictures taken from google, from my experience at least are usually of a lower quality
---
Google combs nearly the entire internet. You're basically saying that the internet doesn't have high quality images.
---
I think Twitch is fine how she is right now. Her drones used to have 12 shots each and lowered it for the express purpose of stopping twitch drones from destroying every default camera on the map and still have some shots to destroy defender gadgets. They made the choice of choosing to shoot out cameras or gadgets on purpose. This gives her gadget the interesting choice of choosing to either destroy default cameras, ruining the defender gadget economy, or zapping enemy defenders with her 5 * 2 taser shots. 
---
The rest all seem to be major nerfs to twitch that would just make no one pick her at all (although I like the skill shot taser shot idea, even if it makes no sense in reality). If something had to change with her, it's got to be either a small damage nerf or lowering the magazine size from 30 to 25 to the F2. The F2 is simply too strong of a combination of easy to control recoil, fast firing rate, range, and AR damage.
---
I only play the new ops on t-hunt for the first few days and then afterwards the toxicity is usually not so bad and I play them then.
---
yea it would be amazing but it just looks so unreal to me like there is nothing for a photo it's just so idk lifeless maybe thats what they have aimed for but who knows
---
Oh thanks
---
That one guy with 174
---
In Capitao's bundle  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I‚Äôll never forget your excessive breathing...
---
&gt; Twitch's biggest advantage shouldn't be the F2, it should be her drone.
---
her drone which is easily killed and can't jump so will have very limited use from now on with all the shields? 
---
yeah...no.
---
Read around, plenty of people are parroting it.
---
You must be new to Ubisoft games
---
If the enemy blows it and sees its a volcan they‚Äôll more than likely shoot the container

I‚Äôm buying it oof
---
He's the one doing it. Already reported him everyone else had 1-2k he sat at like 9

I‚Äôm confused what game got a battle pass. It wasn‚Äôt siege was it or isn‚Äôt going to be.

u/Tachungus be right here.
---
ok, you can just deal with their removal rather than whining then.
---
Well... that answers my question... thank you kind sir...
---
Why is night mode getting removed from casual? Why are you removing some maps from casual? Why are you turning casual into watered down ranked? 
---
&gt;CAPITAO
---
&gt;&gt;Asphyxiating bolts are no more!¬†
---
But why
---
Lol nice but that is a ww1 machine gun there‚Äôs a mode of it on the map fortress
---
Its default skin for her shotgun 
---
New operators when gets recycled guns the default skin is different from the real ones
---
finally. every season i get closer to actually wanting to grind this. as soon as they fix dossing, i'm all over this shit.
---
Holy shit
---
This is one of the least impactful buffs I think he could‚Äôve gotten. It won‚Äôt change much tbh
---
I‚Äôm saying for game images that aren‚Äôt uploaded in HD with the resolution you need the downloaded image will be of a lower quality, you seem to be taking a very big offence to my personal experience and to the fact that the op decided to use images of locked operators.
---
This happens all them now. The game is ruined
---
Impacts best
---
Siege is literally getting a battle pass
---
For anyone wondering, here's a post regarding this weapon skin, two years ago.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/684c1u/vintage\_combat\_bundle\_out\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/684c1u/vintage_combat_bundle_out_now/) 
---
From Ubisoft Blog at the time:
---
"**Glorify history with the Vintage Combat Bundle. The Vintage Combat weapon skin applies to your SWAT, GIGN, GSG-9, S.A.S, Spetsnaz, JTF-2, SEAL, BOPE, S.A.T. and G.E.O loadouts.**"
---
The supernova shotgun would be included in this bundle, if it had been released.
---
I also agree. I kinda wish they‚Äôd test the BOSG with an ACOG on a TTS now, just to see if it‚Äôs balanced.
---
I hope not
---
If you think your reason for playing a game is the only reason, you're very foolish.
---
Plenty of people don't know shit. Ubisoft has a tendency to use big words to come up with excuses and it's working pretty damn convenient for them.  
---
Harmonization this, licensing that.
---
a program would likely do these badly (you can tell its a program cus they are each only made of 3 colors) plus they are small enough to make by hand
---
I mean it‚Äôs part of the gameplay so it‚Äôs gonna effect your enjoyment of the game bikini your a fuckin idiot (and no I don‚Äôt really mind that much about the reused guns as the ones they‚Äôre reusing are underused anyways or only used on 1 or two ops)
---
Right now they just scan the text chat to see if they said anything bad
---
Yeah I care about this game but shit like this makes me not want to play anymore. Sucks that Ubi doesn't care for console players

I believe 1 month, yes.

Dude I don‚Äôt catch Pok√©mon, I go out with them. Middle East style
---
Poland cannot into space, but Amaru can.
---
I don't "need" to buy the game, I don't "need" to buy the operators, back in the day you didn't "need" to buy the ACOG. The point is Ubisoft wants all of our money and they continue look for new ways to take it from us.  This game makes BANK for them already, but it will never be enough. I won't be buying it, but I'm going to call it out.
---
Ubisoft knows that these mechanics are designed to manipulate users into spending more money to the point where they don't realize how much they're spending. It's bs and I'm disappointed it's coming to R6.
---
I'm usually against a lot of ubisoft's business practice but here I don't care, there's a lot to look forward to next season, if you don't like the BP just don't buy it
---
September 10th i believe
---
Advantage has nothing to do with it. That doesn't matter to me and that is why the OP's suggestion wouldn't entice me. I don't see it as cheating and I don't think it breaks any rules. 
---
I get the feeling that there is no further point in discussing anything with you.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the unranked playlist.  If it were ranked rules but every map it would be a cool idea.  It annoys me that ranked is focused so much on pro league (yeah, a very high majority of us are not even close) that you lose 2/3 of the maps.  A playlist with ranked rules and the casual map rotation would be great.
---
Castle is still a staple in most defense in pro league. He's only going to get stronger as a counter to Amaru. He is definitely not underpowered.
---
I'm gonna go dislike it now
---
Didn‚Äôt think of that. I thought I was missing one lol.
---
 This would actually be lit to have an operator with an activate switch to suicide bomb proximity attackers
---
Wait is this a new bug?
---
did you read anything i said?
---
Guess what
---
One attacker and one defender and its only on the operator screen, check out the test server
---
Facts
---
It's way worse on Xbox
---
I once got kicked for choosing Thermite and not Recruit.
---
I‚Äôm buying it!
---
I like that he told you good try. Usually i get voted out
---
Same man. They hate us.
---
FAL is in here as Capitao's Para-308, but it's been changed so much since Skull Rain's launch that it doesn't play like how you would expect a 308 battle rifle to play.
---
What if bikini does actually think that it's a good decision? That he's not biased, and we're just thinking he is blindly supporting ubi?
---
But do you have the elite skin
---
Ok by a second copy of the game now play only 1 to 3 hours a day for a year now you have school or a job right? Let's say yes now you only play on weekends maybe Fridays let's pretend your new to the game so your win lose is not 3 to 1 or 2 to 1 more like 1 to 3 you only get what 50 to 200 renown right now let's see if you get all of the ops in 1 year with out spending money or using the free op Christmas gift.
---
I get where you're coming from. It'll the deincentivize high skilled players from playing with their lower skilled friends. Yet Ranked is meant to be played with and against people of similar skill level. Adding one Platinum to a game of Coppers screws over the team without the Platinum. Adding one copper to a game of Platinums screws over the team with the Copper. The solution is simple. If you and your friends aren't of similar skill level. Play casual until you are. Then have the lowest ranking members play ranked until they're within that threshold.
---
Wait they do? They've been "out" for like a day lmao.
---
I use 60hz and nothing like that happens. If you think there's an advantage either improve your reaction times or buy a new monitor.
---
Ok, who in the world unironically uses bulletproof cameras?
---
I mean making fun of a game that only retarded little kids play kinda sounds like a low blow
---
Good
---
So you work for Ubi and/or in the gaming industry? Or licensing industry? How are you sure they could have added at least one new gun?
---
No :(
---
Is being outdoors that disgusting to you?
---
oh wow the poor fuckers that have to listen to the voice chats that get reported :(
---
1000 and still bronze
---
You might also want to look at Ela's Scorpion. I think it also got buffed. At least the horizontal recoil didn't seem as bad to me.
---
Politics? Its a fucking video game
---
J√§ger spaghetti
---
Could you have taken a better picture
---
But when you play unranked you‚Äôre not playing for anything
---
is jagers acog back???
---
Dude I cannot fathom being older than .... 6 years old? And spelling losing as loosing. How do so many people manage?
---
Congrats, now the challenge is to break into plat.  You can do it ‚úäüèª
---
&gt; so if we continued to add weapons, they‚Äôd all just be somewhat similar to one another damagewise
---
so what? i still want new guns. and the amount of combinations you could have with different values of:
---
1. rate of fire
---
2. damage
---
3. recoil
---
4. damage falloff
---
5. mag size
---
6. scopes/attachments (possibly integrated attachments like mp5SD as well)
---
are way more than the 100 guns we have now, considering a significant portion of those guns are like shotguns or DMRs which cannot be compared to ARs/SMGs because they fundamentally work differently. 
---
honestly, you could say that about anything
---
"add enough cosmetics and eventually they'll be similar" 
---
yet you don't hear people complaining about "another x color background with y color accents"
---
Well that‚Äôs what the whole initial idea is about.... to ask what and why. It‚Äôs not about stacking his kit but that being said everyone else that had a deployment with a lethal or destructive element also has a non lethal option as well. It‚Äôs no to stack but to see if there is an option of versatility.
---
Add new guns they can literally have the exact same stats as existing ones but with unique attachments it's just the fact theres something fresh in the game it's been out since was 2015 or 2016? Its an old game and they get stale when you play the same one for so long. New ops is great but whe they dont have new unique weapons it's just not as exciting
---
Bikini has been way too full of himself ever since they removed Ash's ACOG.
---
She‚Äôs almost as tall as mozzie omg
---
Because Siege's maps are inherently complex and open ended that it's incredibly hard for many new players to wrap their head fully around one. The point I'm basically saying is that to actually completely understand a map, you'd have to know all the layers, which floor is above which and what not. Then they'd have to discover rotations that are good, what to reinforce, how to synergize their gadgets to the fullest with the map. That is a lot to ask of newcomers, so the newcomer's map rotation is purposely kept small to not overwhelm them. Instead, it helps them familiarize with a small selection of maps, where they can then spend more time on other aspects of the game rather than worrying about where they are and whatnot. 
---
Doing that for 1 map is already daunting and as many stated before, it takes many, many hours for a player to completely get a map. So doing it for 3 is already asking a lot from the newcomers, so increasing the pool doesn't increase their learning, but instead shallows what they've learned in order to efficiently get used to all the maps. 
---
More isn't better, especially when it comes to learning. Imagine if you had to study for school coming up next week but you only have 5 hours a day. What's more efficient, studying for every single one of your classes all at once meaning each subject gets about 1 hour or less, or splitting up two subjects per day giving you 2.5 hours of study time per subject? 
---
Basically, the more you cram at once, the less you learn of nuance and the minor, but important parts. Thus, the less maps a newcomer has to worry about, the more they can spend learning about droning, cam locations, gun control, gadgets, and team synergy.
---
Someone I know got kicked after almost clutching a 1v5 and trading on the last guy
---
Using the same guns isn‚Äôt a big deal. There‚Äôs actually a ton of variation when it comes to weapons in this game. 
---
The problem for me is losing maps. I usually play the same 3-4 maps in ranked anyway, and casual was usually the same 5-6 maps.
---
Goyo our here looking like Mexico‚Äôs Cole Walker
---
Thatcher and Mozzie. It goes well.
---
They even said one of the reasons they didn't add new weapons is because there is a limit to how many can be licensed and legally used in a game in addition to wanting players to be able to use earlier weapon skins and not have to learn new recoil. As for the battle pass, if the money goes to helping the game get on track then I have no problem with it but if they use it as a cash grab and don't improve the game then it will be a problem.
---
Oh, you're looking in the mirror?
---
she will be as long as no object is infront of her so i doubt she will be able from 2nd floor
---
Sometimes when I fuze windows the opponent will hear it and just shoot me through the window so i think it is a good buff and a good start to buffing fuze. Fuze already has a good Gun,with a bad ability in ranked I would say just to change the deployment time to 1 second
---
Agreed trust me I‚Äôm just as pissed about the battle pass.
---
Maybe they could have but just as an example for how hard it can be you couldn‚Äôt find a proper airsoft replica of a Glock until I believe 2017. Anyone who made one without the license was hit with a lawsuit with a swiftness you cannot imagine.
---
I fail to see the roast in here
---
Play unranked, or play together often since the start of the season. If playing with friends is that portant to you, youll be willing to sacrifice your rank to be able to play with them by not solo playing all the other games.
---
He‚Äôs seriously been so annoying with this new batch of content especially the guns/battlepass shit.
---
Oh forgot about that game, haven't heard of it since 2018
---
I play siege for the animations. They're fucking great.
---
Is Ela there?
---
Real pictures are used for reflections in scopes. You can see a Ford Focus in one of them. I guess someone slipped this in the code by mistake
---
1: My monitor is curved
---
2: Screenshotting is hard ok
---
3: Brain go poop
---
THEY ARE REMOVING PLANE ? BULLSHIT ! my favorite map ! and night maps have the best shading. if you are going to do this make a BABY mode.
---
\+2
---
Next season, Warden and Valkyrie both get given submachine guns to help their mixups.
---
Yeah frankly this is just straight up an ignorant opinion/statement. Yes siege can and is often played for its utility, but a lot people care more to frag out than play for utility in this game, which is also perfectly reasonable. This is just a stupid gatekeeping comment from bikini
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy to counter though as you can just go below and shoot up. People normally drone in there anyway and if I see a shield way out of position like that of course people will think something is up
---
Fkin finally, i hate these guys. At long last will i be able to practise recoil and aim stress-free!
---
Neither, looks quite good though but expensive. Have you heard the next elite skin will be mira
---
The new op
---
I got kicked today for calling someone out for being toxic, after they called someone else out for being toxic. They told me to kill myself before I was kicked, which was nice.
---
It's the circle of life, ya know.
---
looks like i have to do that for now
---
I like the name considering all the trouble varsity is having in copper to diamond this season, he's getting there but I was almost convinced he was hard stuck between gold and plat.
---
So in the Test server, quick leaning is apparent however the head movement is the same, ela‚Äôs recoil is so much better but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs broken and the smg 11 has a MUCH better recoil.
---
and how does that change anything? If you really want to play with your friends and want the ranked experience, play unranked. Ranked is meant for play around everyone‚Äôs level
---
Hello daltonthekidd, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
He hasn't said anything about the gadgets at all, I think what he means is that siege is not primarily focused on guns.Sure they are important and I don't disagree, I think he is saying that there are better games then siege if u want newer guns and more variety of weapons.And that siege is for teamwork,communication,Intel and their gadgets.
---
Oh and I don't watch him.
---
Also ubi has apparently ran out of guns to legally use, which I don't believe .But some companies in the past refrained from lifting guns in others games in case the game is blamed for a tragedy.(this time about guns)
---
u/userleansbot
---
oh just shoot the backpack, cant explode
---
Keeps you playing
---
S A M E sad Monty hours though for me
---
wow lol
---
How do they get money on free items? Plus like a large corporation like UBISOFT is gonna give 2 new characters 4 to five new guns that they have to pay licensing for while making sure new ops aren't copies like n√∏kk and warden were.
---
Did you really just watermark an elite that anyone can see?
---
I think there‚Äôs a decent desync for where you‚Äôre shield is pointed on console, so you could be looking DIRECTLY at someone, but to them you‚Äôre tilted a few degrees to the side, which is enough to easily kill you

‚ÄúGood luck trying to peek me, I‚Äôm behind 5 smokes and 2 frags!‚Äù
---
psh, old news
---
Utility creep is a thing. Fuze is a 3 armour with an incredibly strong gun, smoke greandes and a gadget than can clear utility, create sound queues and kill enemy players.
---
Giving him MORE utility is just retarded when the ONLY reason why he isn't picked is because he's a 2 speed. 
---
They need to address the game design around this flaw, not just randomly give him more shit until he's popular.
---
Agreed
---
*cries in shield main*
---
They have little slits in them now that allow you to see through
---
how was it reduced? i still see splatter on walls
---
You're a raider! Legendary
---
I SAID SORRY
---
it's also completely flawed logic
---
"if you're complaining about lack of new guns, YOU MUST BE PRIMARILY PLAYING SIEGE FOR THE GUNS"
---
complete horse shit.
---
Huh, that your main? I woulda guessed these two as the community makes ‚Äòthic‚Äô comments and jokes all the time
---
Who plays for the guns? That‚Äôs a dumb post.
---
Now, add in the sun and mark it "champions"
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an unreasonable request tho it‚Äôs nice to have a new gun to learn within the game even if it‚Äôs a reskinned gun every so often
---
There are so many dlc maps I hate besides maybe Skyscraper, Outback, and some parts of Fortress
---
To be honest, I don't understand why it is considered "bad" to like an operator for their guns. I got Echo simply for the MP5SD, and I love playing him! The guns in Siege have unique handling, and are fun to play with, and you CAN'T have a good operator without good guns! But that is just my two cents..
---
are the new ops out on the TTS ??
---
I would buy in a heartbeat.
---
You can literally say the same thing about most shooters wtf.
---
I think the obvious answer is that any skin not available in Alpha packs (and therefore without a duplicate price) couldn't be sold.
---
The map rotations of both casual and ranked are weird this season. The unranked playlist is also questionable.. i would probably do it a bit different if i was Ubisoft but Yeah, i am not Ubisoft for That reason probably üòÇ
---
I play to get called a dumb black even though I'm asian.
---
Deserved
---
Agreed. There's no "wrong reason" to play a video game. If the guns make it fun for you, enjoy!

I understand it, but it feels like I've been rubbed with superiority grease.

Ela is next so yeah.
---
I had the same idea as you where i thought Echo might be next but yeah. It's ela
---
It's the literal definition of a shitshow
---
Yeah but you got to cater to the window licking pro players who are too dumb to figure out how a new gun works.
---
Won't anyone think of the esports
---
Calling r/expectedthanos
---
At least with Nokk she had Claymore early on but it got removed for bug reason or something. Ubi stated long ago that she'd get her claymore back.
---
No but since you‚Äôre kind of ignorant and maybe incompetent or you just won‚Äôt get that even they kind of reused gadgets nokk is completely different than cav or vigil
---
That‚Äôs also the biggest problem money wise. Other than that maybe some changes to the seasons pass, add the battle pass, maybe a seasonal skin of your choice.
---
Nice try Ubisoft.
---
I get voted to kick all the time because of my gamertag

*Nord VPN has entered the chat*

I originally thought it was more of a punk rock type but then I saw the animation and well wasn‚Äôt expecting that...

Indeed, I expected her to make use of the gun or something. Not raise her fist like she wanted to flip off the enemy then realise she's in a children's book

C7E was pretty damn broken on launch

Looks pretty good

Majority of the comments about it that I've seen so far are positive, so yea
---
I play so I can feel like a navy seal and act like I‚Äôm badass until I turn 18
---
These days man... everyone criticizes you for even having an opinion, sigh. Of course its bias, it's a freakin opinion.
---
Chalet will be the new Hereford in terms of popularity and balancing. 
---
Change My Mind.
---
OOF
---
Nope just a regular player, take off the tin foil hat
---
Ah another thermite main with the elite skin, fellow man of quality.
---
They're just getting punk-ier with these skins
---
The mvp animation to be exact. I don't expect much of ingame animation
---
If you play A racing game for the cars, you're playing it for the wrong reason.
---
Please tell me without being an asshole the answer to my question
---
I'll gladly get paid to find out which little kids are swearing and being toxic.
---
They should replace Warden's MPX with Mozzie's Commando 9 because it would be a buff to Warden and also make sense because the Colt 9mm SMG is a gun used by a number of federal services.
---
is it me or 
---
the 1st plugs look like they are screaming or are sad
---
but pluggs 2 look happy
---
Looks like shit. Lol. But for real.... it does.
---
No shame in admitting people are better than you. Learn from them. You will get better and then you can complain about secondary gadgets
---
You got banned because you weren‚Äôt in the game when it was over. They can‚Äôt possibly know that you were booted offline by ddossers, so they have to treat it like you abandoned the match. Also I like how you call ubi flying fucks but when someone does it to you, you can‚Äôt handle it and have to downvote
---
I think it even applies to for honor. Imagine if the new character(the one with the hammer) came out and his play style is mostly the same, focus on out of Stam punishes etc. but instead of a hammer he just has raiders axe, uses the same animations and has the same executions. I donno but that‚Äôs pretty boring sounding to me. Ya he‚Äôs a new character but he feels the same. It‚Äôs even worse in rainbow because all you ever see is your gun! At least warden has different reload animations I guess.
---
I guess we have to wait to find out how much they want for the season pass if it‚Äôs like 5-10 bucks they could include them in the season pass but they would need to adjust the pricing on it by at least 20-40 bucks
---
So there are wrong or right reasons to play? Gun lovers, don't buy the game. Sorry Ubi, someone on Twitter says liking the game for the guns is bad, so I can't purachae your game. Sorry.
---
You are in a field with two buildings. You can only enter one. 
---
In one, there is a Twitch with no guns, with two drones ready to roll. In the other, there is a completely identical Twitch, except she has her weapons but no drone.
---
Which building do you enter?
---
The point was that Kanal is in Germany
---
you open packs and you get items, understand it or deinstall plz
---
In my opinion I just want them to add a recruit that can have attachments but no abilities and just give him all the weapons for each side and a bunch of other ones just so I can play around with cool guns, like I play echo mostly because he has probably one of the best defensive guns, and I just use my yokais as cameras for hallways haha, but I want to be able to run like 2 different CTU sided weapons like an ak12 and an m45 that would be pretty nice,
---
Depends the MnK player I guess but yeah Ddossing is stupid broken
---
Yea I'm not here for the guns, I'm here for the toxic team kills and the sweaty doc run outs.
---
I think he means ‚Äú if you paid for season pass for guns you are wrong ‚Äú
---
I mean, he has no grounds to say that his way of playing is better than everyone else‚Äôs. Personally don‚Äôt care about no new guns but...
---
I‚Äôm low Plat and it‚Äôs tough to maintain now. I don‚Äôt have an Elite Controller either.
---
They had the developer power to add a battle pass but not new guns?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs hibana/echos
---
I love House, Plane and Yacht :(
---
Does he land right off the window or the momentum carries him further in the room so it won't trigger the frost mat?
---
Then what is the point of charms, skins, weapon customization, etc? Screw off with this "my way to play is the ***only*** correct way!"
---
Not if I rage quit fast enough!
---
Hello B-i-n-x,
---
Wait what‚Äôs the new OPs?
---
How is it unexpected when anyone someone says to be fair some retard posts this
---
Who‚Äôs the two green operators on the right side?
---
Exactly.. or she could have fired a blank on it with one of the gas canisters after she juggled it around..
---

stick it in me
---
I would definite pay an $5-$10 if they put in the battle pass. You already get 8 ops which is $40 if you were to pay for them.
---
Attacker has smg11 and Mira/Jackals shotgun
---
Defender has Echo/Hibanas pistol
---
I literally never said I didn‚Äôt care about cosmetic items
---
I said I don‚Äôt care for the monetization of them
---
Also... I totally don‚Äôt disagree about weapon design, I was just addressing previous arguments. I would also hope that you don‚Äôt just downvote comments you disagree with because I would think any normal person with actual thoughts in their head would respect a well-written opinion
---
Shall I repeat #OPINION
---
2 things 1)its uninstall
---
2)this is about how duplicates get you more items as you said you twit
---
They've said they're never touching House. It's too much of a classic map and it would be too difficult to fix because a residential house can only be so big before it's something else.
---
Wasn‚Äôt this just posted by someone else right before you
---
He's not saying you're playing it the wrong way though. His argument is that if you're playing the game solely for the guns then you're playing for the wrong reason.
---
Personally, I don't mind the use of old guns. It's just that Ubi needs to make sure that they think about which guns they want to reuse.
---
If it's a 5 stack sure. But if it's a two stack, it's not fair for the other three members of the team. 
---
&gt;That's what people want.
---
Is it? Most people seem really happy with this change. 
---
&gt;And that's even less fair.
---
How is it less fair? It's more effort for them now.
---
Yeah Ghost Recon: Wildlands is basically Open World Gunporn: The Game. Seriously, the most ridiculous amount of real world weapons to find and customize, and that's even going into the dozens and dozens of guns introduced through DLC since it came out.
---
I guess that's the big appeal of a Tom Clancy game, whether it's Rainbow Six or even Splinter Cell: Blacklist, expect lots and lots of gun porn.
---
Yeah I mens there are charms, skins, parts...what is the Twitter person even talking about
---
This is real, no way they would model legit cars and get the licensing for that. I imagine it‚Äôs just a snap shot they were using for mock-up. Also this has been posted at least 70 times on this reddit today

Echos pro league already came out

Hello Edgelord-Supreme, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cspjpy/hey_anyone_wanna_buy_me_the_smoke_eliteon_ps4_and/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
yes
---
plus guud guns
---
guess it could ultimatelybe destroyed from big garage/garage door? but yes, this or kapkan :¬∞)
---
Some Nicky Minaj and Billie Eillish combo here...
---
I've been playing this game for 4 years, plus i stopped going into ranked.
---
She did have a shotgun originally lmao
---
Or work the gun, do anything but raise your fist like you're full of anxiety
---
Autocorrect is a pain
---
It didn‚Äôt. Comes out on September 10th.
---
I've used her, like here and there and they're solid guns
---
I loved that season
---
I'm never gonna get further than this I can tell you that much
---
That‚Äôs my talk but it seems a lot of people expect ubi to give them everything for free since they bOuGhT tHe GaMe eArLiEr
---
I can see why. It‚Äôs boring as fuck now. Even more boring with fewer maps this season
---
I tested it earlier and it didn‚Äôt really feel all that different to me, I‚Äôve heard otherwise though from other people so maybe it‚Äôs just me. I don‚Äôt use it that often
---
I realized they weren't actually ass like I thought they were when I got the last shotgun challenge done in 2 games. The acs12 is just bad though
---
If I could just load up all of my attack operators with Thermies 5.56xi I would be psyched. 
---
amirite?
---
Is this real??
---
My first Black I got was on the Mp5

Thatcher main: "Can we get some hard breach please?"

Ash main: **REPORT NEGATIVE ATTITUDE**

Yeah, totally agreeing with that.. Ubisoft has not been up to par on all the dev teams it seems like
