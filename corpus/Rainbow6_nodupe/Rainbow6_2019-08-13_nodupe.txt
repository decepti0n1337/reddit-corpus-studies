They should put all the files for the new hereford on a usb drive and crush it with a hydraulic press, then take the shards and throw them in a landfill.

I think it’s fake, the words don’t match unlike most of the other seasons (skull rain doesn’t really match as well).
---
minecraft?
---
Oh. Oh no
---
The fact that Siege doesn't have a casino map is appauling

It also will NEVER have one thanks to china. RIP

Oh no.

Now, I dont think new Hereford is that bad , but they removed such a classic map, imagine if house was removed.

You'd think it's that simple, but it isn't. If you specifically queue for Article 5, you'll get Article 5. If you queue for T Hunt on any difficulty with anything less than a 5 man squad and have Disarm Bomb and Bartlett U enabled, there is always a chance you will get Article 5, whether you want it or not. The only way to avoid it is to make sure everyone in your party has Bartlett U and/or Disarm Bomb disabled in T Hunt matchmaking preferences.
---
If someone queues for Article 5, the game will fill the lobby with four more players in T Hunt matchmaking, selecting anyone who meets the criteria (Disarm Bomb and Bartlett U enabled for at least one member in a party). They do that because the queue would otherwise be disproportionately long, especially since no one else wants to play it.
---
tachanka is here and he believes in you. {-}7
---
Nothing to be concerned about in console there are frame drops in the menu but the game usually runs 60 fps
---
frost traps are nerfed down to 60hp, Like majority of the attacker weapons can 2 shot that.
---
If you keep falling for Gu Mines then play I, twitch or thatcher. Also drone a head before you run down the hallway, the drones can see the mines better than the player POV
---
I don't remember how long it took me to reach lvl 50, but I feel what you mean, I think maybe level 20 should be the lvl

Spoopy Lady #1 and Spoopy Lady #2 are both good, no idea which one you're referring to, but Nøkk and Cav are both good. High skill (ot dumb luck), but great once you get there.

Are you trying to launch the game through Uplay or with the icon on your desktop? A few updates ago my game refused to launch from the desktop icon and I had to go through Uplay and hit "Play" on Siege. The problem kinda disappeared on it's own.

Pull straight down, trying to control horizontal recoil is super aids

He had one. And barbed wire. Too OP, was nerfed

I forgotted this women...

Only change at diamond level is 20-30% of your games you’ll play DDOSers who can basically turn the match into a big game of red light green light, and if your about to win just delete the game like it never existed

Feels good to be in the minority of the community so ubi doesn’t care enough

Outback is a new map and Kafe got reworked as did glaz he’s different now. There’s more I’m sure

How?

Yeah and I mean I played from the beginning and have every umbrella except 9
---
I understand where Ubisoft is coming from, though I feel a good compromise for a new Operator's loadout should be one new primary weapon and an old one. The sidearm could come from other CTUs since we already have more than enough pistol variety in this game.

Isn't glaz's video about him comparing snipers and artists? You forgot a fucking detail:FACEPAINT

Fuze carriers an AK12, Zofia has a modified polish FB Beryl

Fuze's AK12 is chambered in 5.45x39, Zofia and Nomads AKs are 7.62x39. The rifles in this picture have 5.45 magazines.
---
I agree that it was too OP but with Bandit’s weapon still being fairly strong, I feel like giving Kaid a third electroclaw makes him just as viable as Bandit
---
Yeah I played 1 game on a friends account he’s diamond this season up 3-0 I dropped 0 kills but let’s not talk about that and the screen did the exact thing you were talking about I assumed it was some shit wrong with the game but that sucks I’ve had my fair share of getting hit off but that shits pathetic

In steam or uplay?
---
Very good sir
---
True. But let's think balancing. It isnt just one more electroclaw, it's two more walls, or upwards of four more barbed wire, hell, in some objs its upwards of four more walls if the Kaid is smart. That WITH bandit? And castle? That's a damn near impossible task for the attackers, even if they have a skilled Thatcher and Maverick.
---
Username checks out
---
Sladge is a cool operator
---
I drop in rank. :/
---
Nearly every season this has happened to me not once have I been plat but I always get 1 game away I don’t understand why I can’t just get the 1 other win 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
---
It’s the name of a new online delivery business in Colorado that will ship you any number of grams for a price
---
When the last remaining attacker is Zofia.
---
Siege, actually. I heard about a couple friends who played it, so I eventually decided to buy it and play it myself. And here I am still playing it.
---
It be like that sometimes, I do a lot of gaining and losing
---
Finger guns
---
So they're re-releasing Capitao?
---
Alibi is the actual best girl.
---
tbh you're better off practicing pulling down at certain speeds for certain weapons.  The SMG-11 is surprisingly easy to control.  Even the SMG-12 is doable once you get a feel for it.
---
Get near the head and the RPM + horizontal recoil will do the work for you.
---
Now the Bearing... that's a whole other monster.
---
Yeah, Rainbow Six mods in game and on discord are the fucking worst

ya don't

So... Clash but with fire instead of electricity? No thanks.

Random op assign, you may not be able to pick recruit anymore in ranked but he's still set as a possible random pick.

I belive its keepin ur index finger away from trigger to avoid accidental firing.. Idk why everyone is commenting here though.. She seems to be pretending to fire also..

Hello happy737, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cpmyxv/server_crashes_on_ps4/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It's an operator that traps deployable shields with firebombs so that they propegate, similar to Capitao's fire bolt, when the deployable shield is destroyed.
---
I think there is a feature that allows you to climb up to high windows and shoot people from there. Not sure 🤔
---
Man, I wish I got R6S for $15 on ps46
---
Yessir no problem b
---
are you really asking that question when it's a ubisoft game
---
I never said she uses the standard issue one. Just that the standard one IS the 5,56 one.  
---
And yeah, it is modified. It's not the only gun that's not standard issue. AK-12 for example is the prototype one, instead of production variant. I don't expect it to be realistic anyway. Not anymore that is.
---
What are you talking about
---
Only if you don't have any ops available, like if you are on a smurf and everyone picks the ops you have unlocked.
---
&gt; most likely Vintorez or AS Val
---
I actually wrote up a rework idea for Glaz on a Prodigio Pete vid a couple of weeks back involving giving him the VSSM to make him viable in cqc again, I should probably post it here at some point.
---
As for the AS Val, that gun was my shit back in BF4, it was the first gun I got 1000 kills with. I’d forgive Ubi for not giving me Mac Daddy in a heartbeat if they added my beloved AS Val
---
&gt; I still want an F2000 to appear too
---
Gaah, I knew I was forgetting something, that and the tavor should definitely be included
---
Yeah I turned off outlines a while ago, but recently I've just been downing teammates cause I'm not sure how close they are when they pop out. I'm not sure if I'll ever be happy either way.
---
This picture is the dictionary definition of “Poland”
---
I haven’t been Motivated to play lately because In diamond there are so many booters it’s ridiculous. The only way to consistently avoid them is by playing with lower ranks but then the game just isn’t as fun
---
Am I wrong? You ever fired a weapon? Even picked up a weapon? Your dumbass reply tells me no.
---
he has a really good gaming chair.
---
That’s just pre nerf ela dude
---
You forgot that they won't stop fucking moving
---
So I saying you wouldn’t smash?? I mean hibana could be my waifu ngl
---
They look sick bro
---
I really like how you did rook
---
I think the problem with this is balancing each and every gun. Twitch is still receiving nerfs and look at Ela, didn't it take 3 or more months to get that broken thing fixed?
---
I’ve turned off teammate outlines, points and vs notifications and never looked back. It declutters the screen so much!
---
See you in hot :)
---
I mean, gl gg
---
You have a very clean mind my friend
---
She had enough with the nerf

is this just a big flex?

Actually I have, Brian.

The "Ember" part of Ember Rise could possibly refer to the "fire shield" that was speculated about during the middle of Phantom Sight.

What does IQ do ? My friends are kinda teaching me the game and they weren’t to sure either.
---
what if you were younger by a year or two with parents consent should you still be allowed ?
---
Not as good as communism
---
IQ has a electronic scanner that can scan basically all gadgets like Kaplan traps, lesion mines, a lot of things. her 552 Commando is really good too
---
When I was testing out recoil patterns. it seems like all the spray patterns are slightly different. It's not just one predefined spray for every gun.
---
Okay that sounds like one I’d really like , Ive been getting Pretty good kill games and I like to be agressive , so it sounds really good for my play style . I was struggling finding one that obviously helps Aggro players . Do you know how much he is?
---
She tired of Ubi's nerfs.

Ak-74m’s
---
You’ve done your research. You did this better than me. Wasn’t that high of a bar but you did it. Yeah and I do agree. Ela literally has nothing good going for her and she needs just a bit of help. Her Scorpion for sure needs a nudge in the right direction, and when they do, she will finally be viable, playable and most importantly FUN.
---
umm the xbox dude isnt getting little elo cuz he playedd only like 50games and he was boosted like he can get 140mmr / game
---
I would say nomad, she is far more powerful and useful than clash, plus she doesn't get banned in ranked as mush as clash does
---
But not any console
---
I don’t roam and still get destroyed by Jackal. He’s more OP than lion in his prime and Ubi’s doing nothing to him 🙄
---
I honestly didn’t know they were air-soft and I own an AK.  I grew up rural where a lot of people had both real and fake guns and I’ve never seen an air-soft gun without an orange tip. It really should be standard for safety.
---
Welp going off the flawed win rate charts that Ubisoft uses I doubt she'll get a buff or even any kind of love soon. Oh she has the highest win rate in game for defense. Well here's the thing pals. Siege has around 30 million actual players not counting rebought copies. They only take stats from PC so bye bye 75% of the players who play console. Around 7.5million people play pc then. Okay guess what they only take from plats and above. So those win rate charts only reflect about 1.8 million people's records. Yeah I'm not going off that low of a number when there's millions of people who don't get their stats recorded. People don't seem to realize that so they bitch and complain about how overpowered her shotgun is, even though it's just very average and does excel above most other shotguns but in other fields not so much. Maybe one day Ubisoft will actually be a good dev team, since they haven't for the past two years. But some can hope.
---
Reported this is to sexy
---
Korezky does porn too. If anyone is intrested...
---
Vertical grip for some guns with intense recoil pattern but angled for any others.
---
Using the vertical grip on something like the UMP is a waste of an equipment slot.
---
No problem, I always upvote cool stuff like this
---
Actually it sould be a 1v2
---
KURWA POWER
---
No problem, I love seeing cool stuff like this!
---
Gun needs less recoil. They went too hard on her nerf. She needed a nerf ASAP when she was strong af back in the day, but what they did to her was unnecessary.
---
"You have 0 kills..."
---
If you’re being boosted u get less elo because u r playing against lower ranks

the xboz player is gettinf 190 mmr per game just look at his match historry

Generally, _generally_, a hacker gets banned within 2 weeks to a month from being reported.
---
However, a more-or-less sure shot way to get it done is to report it to support.

This sub is basically a community sub. Ubi doesn't ban hackers looking at posts here.

Thanks for watching everyone 👌🏼
---
No. This game is years behind. Give it some time, it'd be good when they do something like this. Very basic.
---
It was difficult the change?
---
Jackal is way OP. That’s why he is banned in 95% of ranked matches. What is it now 5 pings? I’d knock it down to 3 max.
---
I don't know if that's true, but I'm too lazy to check so... *orrange arrow*
---
It’s a concept created by my friend but Ubisoft gave him some renown and uplay coins, so we were a little excited about the possibility of this operator being added into the game ;)
---
playing with a friend he tried to confuse me but he had a different skin so I stood there laughing and he killed me :(

Source of his concept?
---
Got to be a joke
---
Easy fix for it. Instead of being able to kill teammates just make it take your health if you shoot them. Just like it does if you have reverse friendly fire on. Make it reverse friendly fire all the time. That way you can’t team kill. But it still makes you play cautious.
---
Destroyed them
---
Thank you for pointing that out 🤣😁
---
I wouldnt be angry if 20 of them were dogshit tbh

Well AK-74U or crewman variations for assault rifles got it covered.

Replace the new Hereford to Tower in ranked whilst bringing back old Hereford to casual.

Nah you need the computer to vault yourself up there. It should be still possible I’ve seen someone play there yesterday in the major stream
---
From the tone of the message, im guessing the reciever of the message was a Plat who was playing with lower ranked team mates. 
---
Thus the sender is accusing him of boosting, and saying is he not good enough to play against his own rank

When ela finds the people who took 10 bullets out of her gun
---
Or just play a lot and learn it by feeling? No?
---
I’d say common sense is an obvious indication. Besides, it’s not like anyone asked. Everyone just jumped to “trigger discipline”.
---
I rarely play the game. It’s my first time back on months
---
Here, take my emoji gold🏅
---
I wish high elo console players would also upload their clips, it would help change that image. I know they can play really well, back then, when there was xbox pro league, i was like: "wtf, how is it possible to play like this with a controller?", they played like they were using a mouse.
---
Exactly this, at least you can move away or do something without having whats effectively a drone just spotting you calling you out
---
That is spread. Your spray pattern is always the same. So, unless the target is too far away (Like long on D2) the spread is almost 0 in most of the guns. Some BS guns like CZ has retarded spread but thats another matter.
---
But in case of R6 its not spread. And it's different everytime.
---
honestly, he is, but the downvotes are unnecessary
---
Yeah, I’ve noticed that. People act like they’re intelligent and observant by noticing that this isn’t safe gun behavior.
---
Like, *no shit*. But common sense indicates that these guns aren’t real.
---
Fake that's just someone dressed as Ela.
---
She uses a skorpion in real life not that gun.
---
Listen here you little shit change this post
---
Grow up buddy.
---
Chanka. Even without the memes he's bound to have a cool elite
---
You forgot the dinner plates you idot
---
Bing bong this guys draws hentai so like
---
All I can think of is a buff af ash when I hear Manly Rainbow Six lol
---
Cool, thank you!
---
Because knowing who the operator is at a glance takes precedence over looks
---
She had to smash the fuck out of the plant just to fit on top of it too, lmao.
---
Had a lot of this myself this season. Fuckin' trash.
---
Do people destroy deployable shields much?
---
Over a Black Ice? You, my friend, have ascended.
---
As a fully grown 47 year old man I have thought very hard and long to come up with the perfect operator
---
They are alternatives, indeed
---
No, you can’t
---
I used to play Roblox Phantom Forces and I would always get at least top 5 out of 64 people
---
that looks goofy because I am not an artist and painted it in 3 minutes. Ubisoft would have painted it very beautifully.
---
This is your idea of humor at 47?
---
Ooph.
---
Why the fuck does she look so familiar but we don’t know who
---
Ela played a round of Candy Crush. Now she's ready to commit mass shottings
---
Just a little bit toxic
---
YES
---
No ur beautiful.
---
200 IQ
---
True.
---
If you don’t like this type of content you can simply avoid looking at it
---
This breaks like half the rules in this sub...
---
I think it's gonna be something like a magnet that catches projectiles and launches them back. 
---
Vulnerable points on sides,bottom and top like bulletproof cam.
---
When you hit up Finka for some of those premium nanobots after asking Bandit for some drugs.
---
Bruh moment.
---
**Waaaaaaaalle**
---
Because no acog is present
---
Meanwhile, i'm at 16 commons/uncommons in a row. :((
---
It’s racist and discriminatory
---
Since when was race involved
---
No. You said Werhner, but it's Wernher.
---
I hope it is coming out in Year 4
---
And if you look at statistics of death by suicide death half of them yell like that so it’s not discriminatory
---
Just imagine an operator with a few ender Pearl's, very unrealistic but so cool
---
Looks like my sister when I tease her Lol
---
Buck.
---
Ela left her roots in Poland, she now fights in the jungles, waiting for the next poor soul to cross her path.
---
It’s clearly racial profiling of Muslim people, making fun of the “terrorist” stereotype, grow up man, this sub is no place for this trash
---
If you are not open to ideas related to the game then you should grow up and look at the world
---
You think it’ll work on PS4?
---
I love the look of Nokk and Warden, but no new guns makes them shit, and there abilities seem to scaled back.
---
Warden only able to see through smoke if staying still, but doesn't come with smoke grenades....wtf? And guns suck.
---
Nokk unable vault without making noise and also able to jam cams from detection but sets off metal detectors? And guns suck.
---
impressive clip considering they nerfed cav into oblivion. nice.
---
Monty
---
Fucken weeb
---
This is not Twitter retard
---
haha cav still feels fairly usable tbh
---
Its the same principal as people who play music in their car too loud. You never walk past a car with the stereo all the way up and ho "Man that's a great song I love that! Thanks for sharing!" Its always the worst possible air garbage.
---
Fully agree
---
With the recent hipfire nerf it would give them more incentive to ads.
---
Yeah I just finished watching the Invitational VODs and that grand final between them was crazy. 22 rounds for one map!
---
r/emojihunters
---
Ye don't feel anything differently except on favaler where I go to drug room to shoot the people rappelling on the wall of the bunk room with my pistol
---
So the "ember" is like the defense gadget right? Ballistic shield with fire or something, idk. Then the "rise" indicates attacker gadget for the hatch rappel thing
---
You know your game has gone to shit when you get DDOS in fucking CASUAL!
---
You do know how shotguns work, don't you?
---
&gt; You do know ddosing isn’t a thing ubi can change since they use Microsoft servers and Sony servers. 
---
Yeah okay, then tell that to the guy who admitted to it.
---
&gt; It’s up to them to do something against it 
---
Thought you just said DDOS-ing is a myth? How can Sony and Microsoft do something against a thing which "isn't a thing"? 
---
&gt; Ubi is fixing what’s possible from their perspective like rank boosting etc.
---
Great, sounds like ranked will be dead from DDOS-ing as Ubisoft is always passing the buck instead of acting like a multi-billion dollar corporation and pushing people to act. I bet if Alpha packs were under fire from legislative or ethical means, which they are, then they'd be paying and lobbying for it to be under control. Oh wait, all corporations do that, yet when it comes to something that improves their consumers' services, suddenly they are toothless? Wow.
---
Still no excuse not to practice trigger discipline
---
I'm only getting like 7
---
That would do nothing to help him while just ruining come backs. If you have to melee open a castle door you’re already dead.
---
That kid you killed is probably mad as hell
---
Give us the AK-109, big scary 7.62 Russian rounds but with extremely little muzzle climb and a simple picatinny rail along the top, no weird attachment needed.

It' s amazing !!

&gt; I read 3 sentences in and could tell from your rhetoric it was just another angry rant with no constructive criticism or useable feedback.
---
For the people in this line of work, it's your job to listen and read. It's not your job, so I won't hold it against you.
---
Secondly, I don't know how to stop DDOS-ing, so I cannot offer anything but my frustration laid out and hope someone from Ubisoft empathizes with it. If they can't empathize with the consumer, then you don't give a shit about the consumer. 
---
&gt; If you want people to drink from the well, don't poison the water.
---
How about you make a proper well, one that is not built on a pit of vipers first? If you can't do that then don't be surprised when people turn around and say "yo what the fuck" instead of saying "uwu pwease Ubi-san make better weww this time hehe"
---
This is like calling ketchup spicy.
---
&gt; I, as well as all of you was bummed when I saw the loadouts of both PS ops 
---
nah i was pretty excited as i love all the guns that were re-used.
---
What are we looking at here?
---
Ubisoft rents servers from Microsoft and Sony to run siege. Ddosing is a thing which needs to be dealt with but that’s something the owner of the server has to fight not the one who’s renting it
---
WE NEED THAT CROSSOVER
---
We already got a new one, the invitational skin

No thanks. I bought it the day it came out and I love to see his face and hair

the vs notification i understand but i personally cant play wihout points. Since i cannot be sure if i injured someone especially when i shoot trough walls

Make Bartlett U great again!
---
There’s a great example in Pro League that is the exact countertop this. Kanine won a 1v2 because he chased a downed player. It’s in “Off the shits with Supr and easilyy”
---
 THAT looks like subzero to me if that happens.
---
No Dulca?
---
this is horrible... but i like it.
---
The people who make the models aren’t the same people who do the coding, the devs are capable of working on both simultaneously
---
I thought it was because everyone was angry over lucky headshots, which the nerf doesn’t even fix since they still happen a lot while somehow capable of missing every shot at point blank range.
---
Didnt know ariana grande played siege

S a u c e

the bois are scared to lose to girls :°)  
---
nah but really I don't know what to think of this choice..
---
Yea but are you Australian? Do you know how frustrating it is to wait years to be represented in one of your favourite games and Ubi make the map and the characters as obnoxious as possible? Gridlock is literally obese and looks like someone’s divorced mum wanted to become a lesbian because they’re so sexually deprived. She’s THE ugliest character in siege, and she’s meant to represent the special forces of my country. Outback is easily the worst part, just put “ooh kangarooooosss” and set it in the outback cause of Australia is a desert, right? It honestly has to be a joke I don’t understand how they could be so arrogant and careless, did Ubi even try?
---
You are welcome, Echo main

Situational in the sense that Glaz is busted on Plane, assuming the bomb/hostage/biohazard is upstairs. 
---
If you're playing bomb and notice your team has a Monty, Lion, and Ying, play Glaz.
---
&gt; If someone complains about a colleague do you think I take him serious if he uses such words?
---
Mate, it's a different story when you're in a professional setting with a profession, that has standards. I'm specializing to be an auditor, and am an accountant by trade. If you bring the profession into disrepute through unprofessionalism and lack of class or integrity, you're in deep shit if they report you to the body that issued your license. I understand that.
---
However, when you are NOT in a professional setting, when you are in a casual forum, which reddit is, then you have more leeway to speak as you want to.
---
And as a line manager, maybe you would want to look into the whole story if someone does have an issue like that, but hey don't mind me.
---
&gt; Ubi would surely look closer to this sub if the guys here would not talk and write like they so know. There is only a few good written cricism to about 1000 insulting rants an this sub. I know everyone is pissed about a few things but if this sub gets cleaner with good critics, ubi would look in it. But as I said now its full of ego pushing ace vids, look how toxic I killed im, and ubi you are shitty change this...
---
You're thinking too highly of Ubisoft. None of them would be responded to because they either a) absolutely can't give a flying shit about what the consumer feels, and/or b) the community guys here are too embarrassed and scared to talk. If it is the former, then it just confirms what I am saying. Did you know of the code leaf problem in Apex Legends? Respawn Entertainment were constantly ignoring the issue, until literally hundreds of people starting spamming their forums and the game's subreddit itself with posts like mine and with the same tone, until Respawn had to acknowledge it, but they still didn't do anything about it. But if you want acknowledgement, you have to work in numbers and target pressure points, like forums, messageboards, their customer support. You have to make it undeniably clear what you want. At the moment, a lot of people are disjointed, and Ubisoft is smart, they made it against the rules to call to action, so if you wanted people to tell Ubisoft to fix this shit and make them answer, you can't do it here because they'd ban you for "call to action".
---
I'll give you an example of how call to action works in video games. Battlefield 3 was in a dire state, the community Don't Revive Me Bro, which was the biggest community of Battlefield players, gathered up and did a blackout of the game. EA had no option but to pay attention and come to the table the next day and put up live servers for testing, to fix all the problems. Being direct and firm gets you places. Hiding behind diplomacy will often get you nowhere, because people no longer are sincere and believe in listening.
---
&gt; Stay calm, stay cool write clean critics and someone will start listening to you...
---
Well, I'll say this one last time. I only called the DDOSer an asshole, and if this is a problem in your mind, then sure, but I didn't call Ubisoft that. Why should Ubisoft get offended when I called the actual perpetrator the cuss-word? Secondly, my language is honestly mild. Calling them "insincere, deaf, etc" is so so mild, that if this honestly ruffles their feathers enough that they don't read the post, then they are truly 5 year old kids who need thicker skin.
---
If you're working with consumers, or in consumer support industries, they teach you to be able to handle people whom are frustrated. If these guys can't handle it, even when the language is this mild, then perhaps they should quit their jobs and do something else.
---

haha funny sex number better put the same comment as everyone else to get my orange arrows haha 69 sex right guys???

It ok i have not play rank in 4 years. But love the game.

He's ok, good on plane and current Kanal for some spawns but extremely situational

I’m working on putting them :)

Very accurate cosplay, best one i've seen here. 
---
On a more serious note:  i'm having a hard time noticing or even seeing nokk from afar or in dark places.
---
They out more effort into the thumbnail than the charm itself.
---
Not usually, no. But I'm also super casual and can't even play ranked yet. 
---
I don't really come across deployable shields much.
---
Thank you Twitch Main
---
Took me a long time to appreciate it but man is it an animal when you get the recoil down. Bandit is so fun to play aggressively with
---
There is a five year old in my school that yells the n-word when he dies in fortnite (his brother told me)
---
And so it is... That ash seeketh embers... 
---
Wait. Sorry, wrong game!
---
Thank you! Someone gave me silver too!
---
Thanks
---
What happened to that dokebbi?
---
For some reason this reminds me of a Bloodborne creature.
---
If you watch Varsity Gaming's videos, there was one where he got matchmade with a 4 stack who were on their private comms. Basically only 1 guy gave him minimal voice comms like what operator to pick if he wanted and thanked him at the end of the match.
---
😂 I’m in the uk idk about you literally no one says the n word not even black people, that’s just an off the limits word for everyone and one time an American kid yelled the n word in class because he didn’t get an answer correct, he got beat up by 2 black kids and a white kid
---
Very nice Cosplay!  I love the details especially on her Face!  You did a very nice job!  how much time did you spend on this?  lol
---
Yes. Even if you link your new account to steam the old copy won't interfere with your new one as it was linked to your old account.   
---
If you can, wait for a sale so you can grab a special editoion with already unlocked ops.
---
bruh, it was a joke about Ubisofts mentality.
---
i do very well remember when Ela dropped (was and still is my most played op on defense)
---
Lol it's kinda funny when people give callouts when they are the only person left on their team. Great clip tho
---
The only legendaries I have are two UMP skins rip
---
You can’t hide that moments of triumph shirt

Hold up there. Nokks ability cancels out cameras. Doesn't that not count mozzie drones?
---
It's so normalized where I live its sad
---
&gt;don't care a shit
---
&gt;mentally retarded
---
&gt;don't
---
&gt;care
---
&gt;a shit
---
I believe we call that a Freudian Slip
---
I imagine that the range would be rather small (around 4-5 metres), since I picture it being used more in doorways, corridors or hatches. It would be a drone ability, like twitch's drone, only instead of the drone shocking things, it would shoot the motion sensor pads
---
word of advice they're ideal for countering push-and-plants with Monty

Oh shit she got a gun
---
Hmm Alex is slimmer? I’ll keep that in mind thanks
---
Wow 😂
---
Ah the sad truth.
---
personally i main cav the whole time so i could barely feel the difference after playing her enough. just adapted overtime i guess 😬
---
that's actually a weezer shirt
---
Now that I think of it if you put in in some kinda gun that comes with like 10 shots that might be good
---
When I saw the beginning of your post , I was thinking to give you shit but at the end I gotta say I agree with everything you say and I feel I need to add that so far the Season Pass hasn’t been worth 40 bucks like the other years and I feel screwed over because they promised  8 new Operators with new weapons, 1 new map and 3 total map reworks and so far they haven’t lived up to any of that.
---
Why does pulse have more hair than him.
---
Wind = Nomad
---
Bastion = Kaid
---
I'd be pissed if I were the Thermite. Regardless, very well done
---
I would pick Nokk. It‘s so fun to play her
---
I would say because you never really know when an elite skin will be released I would say wait till the Raleigh major to decide if you would like to buy one of the new elite skins next season or buy one that you like more. Your decision

Now I have

armor plates

How do they know?

Recruits of the Abyss
---
I have few other ops left. So i think i don't have much choice. I'll try Nokk. Thanks folks.
---
ouch
---
Doesn't matter how much money you spent on the game. If your friend got banned,  he deserves it. Ive received warnings and suspensions for things I shouldn't have done,  they don't just ban you for no reason. 
---
Tell him to go play fortnite
---
Does your friend also only play with you? If your friend solo queues and loses 2 games against cheaters, then team up with you for 10 games and you both win the one game that gets ignored due to cheating then your friend would gain ELO while you lose ELO.
---
Consider that an opportunity at getting better. You'll learn faster by playing against and with better players.
---
I'm not sure they changed the code, I know I attacked first frequently when attack/defense rotated each round but never had a reason to track it since it still seemed fair.  I think the issue might have only presented itself once 3 round rotations made it more than obvious.
---
Thats what I said I use
---
It'll be in your best interest to break them when the shield rework is released. Frags, sledge, ash charges, etc.
---
I love it how you can tell it's a console player just by looking at the recoil control, lmao.
---
Oh you right. I’m blind lmao
---
Actually you should probably talk to ms.
---
I'm more strategical and info based type of a player, than a rusher, so I need time

What about for the Russkie Bois + Finka?

Can't forget to tiny whisk as well as kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

/me looks down.  no tits.  upside down smile now.
---
Tbh Iam kinda dumb....
---
It annoys the shit out of me, that's why I ban her most of the time
---
Mozzie and Echo gets the white wave form similar to how drones get that white lines when close to Vigil. 
---
The difference is that the Attackers have to be more careful because they have to worry about many different angle Vigil could be holding from. Echo and Mozzie don't have to worry as much since all they have to do is hold angle toward that direction and let Nokk comes to them.
---
He “only TKd and Lagged the server” ONLY. Gtfo keep your friend banned.
---
They own the servers. It's their infrastructure being attacked.
---
Lmao Elizabeth Olsen and Ariana Grande
---
I want to find my friends
---
If he spammed chat to get the server to lag and possibly crash then he deserves to be gone, sounds toxic to me tbh

Castle doesn’t need a rework and the fact that you think he does shows the game knowledge you have. he needs a slight buff but that’s it.

didn't they patch that a while ago?

how would any of us know. we don’t know what operators you have and what your play style is. even if you included all that, this question is easily answered on youtube or google.
---
Link? I believe you I'm honestly just too lazy to find it
---
Castle now blocks glaz bullets too
---
Whenever I do that I just leave the game
---
Kills aren't the only way to get points. That guy probably played objective,therefore getting more points than you. Nothing is wrong here. I once out shadowed a guy with 10 kills when I had 2. Play objective more.
---
Operation Ember Rise will begin very soon - the next series of innovations is just around the corner!
---
Amaru and Goyo will appear in Rainbow Six - new operators from Peru and Mexico, who will make the gameplay even more diverse. The Kanal map will also be fully updated.
---
More on the finals of #RaleighMajor!
---
Who's my stupid?
---
Both at this point
---
Judging by the operation name the leaks seems real   
---
Defender: Deployable shield which causes fire (Ember)  
---
Attacker:Hook that can climb through windows/hatches (Rise)

Holy Shit that is dope

Operation Ember Rise will begin very soon!

She could probably be buffed slightly, but it wouldn't take much to make her OP again.  I'd rather have her stay in her current slightly disappointing state than risk that.
---
Honestly, I don't find her gun to be bad.  It's bad at mid range.  But most guns have too much recoil for long range and it absolutely shreds at close range.  You just have to careful with it and always burst.
---
The fuck she drinking? A shamrock shake?
---
what’re you even talking about. these posts complaining about ‘too many american operators’ are incredibly annoying
---
So Goyo roughly translates to Gregarious in english. Or something of the same meaning.
---
Hook operator will have a shotgun
---
But you didn't kill the player
---
Why do people think he should get smoke grenades? That’s an attacker specific secondary gadget. I understand that complements his ability quite well, but I don’t think Ubisoft would ever make the exception for one operator. That’d make him too good. He’s a very situational operator, and I’m not sure if there’s much room to change that.

---
I think so, I really want Dutch operators in this game because it's my country
---
....or, since this is a team based game, worry more about the win and less about the kills.
---
*they drew first blood!*
---
Glock doesn't allow their guns to be used in video games anymore
---
You can really see the struggle there. 😂
---
*Ernie prepares to commit a hate crime*
---
In a way, yes. While it’s great to improve your one-taps and trigger finger by using semi-auto weapons, you’re not getting the practice of recoil control on full-auto rifles.
---
Always ping.
---
And out doors. I think that'd be cool. Just a bunch of trails and canopy's for the OBJ sites.
---
DPS means almost nothing. For perspective, the most kills of any weapon in LATAM PL is literally the MPX.
---
yeah your quiet now lmao
---
Sucks that that happened, but you shouldn't pop Mira's, seeing as the enemy could use it for a free window into site
---
Shhhhh the motherland will not approve.
---
I don't like the idea of fire shield. It doesn't sound balanced.
---
The leaks suggest the rise is implying the attacker with a grappling-hook/ladder through hatches.
---
While ember is the defense operator with either shield that has fire or allows the deffense op to attached incendiary on deployable sheilds that cause fire if shield is destroyed
---
I mean they could release a defender version next season or in the future. I think it could get boring if two similar attacker and defenders were released at the same time. Imagine Vigil and Nøkk or Kapkan and Gridlock releasing at the same time.
---
McDonalds!!
---
Nice ace, good try on the defuser.
---
She should be able to sprint with her gadget not faltering, She should have an MP7 or MP5 to maintain her killfeed mindgames, and Warden should have the PDW9 and be a 2 speed.
---
Guarantee their pick rates would launch into the sky if they had that.
---
It doesn't really matter what nationality they are, if one or both operators are fun or add something unique to the already competitive meta then I'll like the ops, if Ubi added Israeli ops? Then I wouldn't care as it's just a video game and the controversy surrounding Israel doesn't matter in a competitive video game like siege. I can understand where you're coming from but the nationality thing doesn't really add anything in a competitive shooter besides diversity which is fine.
---
Why would you make a grappling hook a thing when we can already throw the rappelling line to the roof anyway
---
I like theme park and skyscraper.
---
Oh duh, thanks for pointing out the mistake without being a dick!
---
But don't you need coding to make the gun work the way you want in the game? I don't do this so I'm sorry if I have things confused.
---
They have a similar version on glaz and fuze, could use that and the cz full auto on vigil for the sp01?
---
Looks like we have another THICC operator
---
Ok ty
---
Oh fuck. Nice. I think I'm best with Cav, out of all of the defenders. But I use pretty much everyone. Have the most hours as her.
---
1. I'm using a standard DS4, I just have nearly 1,600 hours of practice with it.
---
2. Those numbers do display, they're telling you how much of each gadget you have left. MnK wouldn't change your HUD at all because the game still thinks you're using controller regardless.
---
3.  Have 200+ clips on my Reddit account, if I was MnK I would've already been flamed to death by this sub.
---
hatches.
---
Rappeling hatches. dahhh.  like for defender
---
Its on kapkan too instead of the makarov lol
---
I always take rook armor as a Cav player
---
Yeah certain objectives benefit a lot from her, in the situations when the team really could use her I pick her.
---
its good
---
Dokkabei
---
This
---
She doesn’t need them, and the leaks said Season 4 will have the Jäger competition.
---
amazing
---
Yeah I’ll add you tomorrow just send you username
---
Probably not. That speculation was done with Kaid and his Sabre and nothing happened with it.
---
[deleted]
---
I'm in a clan so that explains the first part
---
Its XTX Smalls
---
sort of but she cant pick up and move things.. This idea of a character is able to pick them up and like move them, place them, directly not generally like Doki
---
Not bad her LMG is my favorite of the two though.
---
[citation needed]
---
I can find nothing corroborating that claim
---
*CLANK CLANK CLANK*
---
no an attacker, thats what the leaker said, grappling hook for attacker to go up hatches, i dont think itll be very useful tho..
---
Have him crawl back to trains and get his ass up
---
Her at is very good, little recoil and good damage. But her ak would make any man have wet dreams because it does similar damage to the ak and has 150 bullets in a mag
---
§
---
Thank you, Sir. I've never actually seen a console player be complemented on their aim by a PC player.
---
But wouldn’t that be countered by the noise it would make?
---
As in I prefer to play casual as I feel that it's where my skill level is at but I'm constantly kicked from the game. But I feel if I want to accualy play a full match I need to play ranked. Was asking what people think about it.
---
Just cause you play in 4:3 doesn't mean the memes need to be.
---
Spelling on Reddit is atrocious
---
Completely correct, I did the same as op still can't control recoil *criesincasual*
---
yes
---
When is the full reveal?
---
Think of it as the Trax Stingers and Smokes Toxic Babes mixed together. It does the same thing as the Trax Stingers and cannot be destroyed by shooting the Fire and it also won’t last as long. You can also see through it and I knew it might be OP so I only gave him 2.
---
I could see it being more useful for secretly moving between floors rather than trying to enter site through a hatch.
---
Yeah I made a mistake and was already corrected on it, props for your aim though!
---
Kapkan doesn't use a Glock
---
Who cares its still a good clutch
---
Siege is fine. It's English that's dying.
---
tHaTs HeR EaR nOt HeR hEaD lol... nice headshot man
---
Mate cmon rappeling defender would beee sooooo fuckin dumb. She rappels faster and stuff. Plus lmao why need a rappel in defence, you cant be that dumb right. This girl was leaked months ago and the leaker said “now defenders gonna have a reason to reinforce the hatches on the same floor they are in”. And then the same leaker said 2 months later that she can rappel way faster than normal attackers. Plus we already have the defenders gadget leak. You think we gonna get 2 defenders... smh
---
Thanks I’ll add you tomorrow morning
---
still you hear that new grappling sound you rush to a hatch and spray em down, unless shes got amazing weapons dont see much use
---
Preciate it, wasn't trying to come at you or anything just wanted to make it clear that I'm not MnK, as that is a pretty bad thing to have tied to your name around here.
---
They are good
---
(I’d watch Rogue-9’s video about Zofia’s primaries)
---
Where she belongs xdddddddddddd gottem hahahah jajajaj xaxaxaxa
---
Ok I was highly considering vigil the most too.
---
its a disapointment
---
Man all it needs is a spot for a deployable shield in front
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IFYcjkbdLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IFYcjkbdLU)
---
He's gun great weapons imo
---
Thx
---
A grappling hook?
---
You know Batman is more well-known for comics, tv and movies too right haha
---
Sadly that's all we do know rn.  The Ubi tweet literally just said "Jäger will have competition."
---
I'd lower that to Vigil or Zofia, if you enjoy attacking more than defending then Zofia, if not then choose Vigil
---
Vigil-pro:secondary like primary, good weapons, special good for drone faze.
---
Con:when scanned I believe he still appears on cams, primary in my opinion not the best, not too good of armour
---
I like zofia better tho
---
Yeah I would agree, it’s very annoying to begin a match with less than 5 and have already like a 70% chance of losing
---
Before they change his look they need to change his vip animations
---
EMBERS RISE UP
---
It's a nice idea but I doubt it would happen cause I feel like they are never gonna catch up to operator release to a point where they all have an elite unless they speed up elite skin output
---
I usually don’t have a problem with ash
---
Don't play for 1 or 2 days.
---
Ah, gotcha
---
Amaru was a dragon in Inca mythology. Tupac Amaru was the last Inca monarch, and Tupac Amaru II was a rebel from the late 1700's. 
---
The rebel leader is probably a reference to Amaru II
---
Where in English is it not known as a Jerry can? We named it in WW1 because British cans sucked.
---
How can you like kanal?
---
Obviously I am not a designer of any type of systems like these. But I think someone should be done. Maybe not be as harsh to people who are disconnected compared to people who just leave. Every system can be exploited. Hints the ddosed problem. But you cant denie something has to be done.
---
He is to dangerous to be kept alive like that
---
Its really frustrating. Stuck debris, C4 not detonating and now this.
---
Castle: am I a joke to you?
---
Vigil can become invisible to cameras and has decent primaries, Zofia has a ok gadget and can revive herself only once. And Lion has ok weapons and can track moving enemies.
---
I just don’t understand how he made the recoil ez er that’s all but instead of explaining you just downvote
---
I’m soo bad at recoil control so thank you
---
I did a 3k the round after that, so you would just be toxic and lose if you cant forgive mistakes
---
Take a break, play a different game for a bit, come back and ease your way into it again with some thunt, then get back to playing
---
I'm in a similar situation. The thing that helped me the best is to watch a few pro games and see tricks/angles they use. Also pick a few ops and learn the recoil.
---
p.s. I still lose a lot of my gun fights but these things have helped me to pull some clutch plays (including my first ever ace)
---
Im pretty sure they can find some way to fix it.
---
Sorry I'm gold myself, just asking to see if y'all needed a hand
---
&gt;Operation Flashpoint
---
With the new naming convention that'd be the name of the Operation we got Ying and Lesion.
---
Probs people who are below lvl 30 and people who want to have fun and not sweat
---
I know
---
Yeah, idk why I potatoed so hard in this :/
---
I just hope that their weapons are new and good but not op
---
I think when you don’t have to play at a high level, because you are average at best, you can enjoy more of the maps regardless of whether they are balanced or not. Balancing doesn’t matter when everyone is just ‘ok’, and I like Kanal for the aesthetics and long corridors.
---
How are the maps designed as a team? Like does 1 group work on Map X while a different one works on Map Y? 
---
The past 4 maps releases were Kafe Fortress Hereford and Villa and like... Villa and Kafe are in 1 bag and then Hereford and Fortress are in a whole other solar system, and people love Kafe and Villa and just about everyone from Pro to Gold to twitch chat hates Hereford and Fortress which leads me to wonder: were they not designed by the same group of people? Hence why they turned out so differently functionally and reception wise?
---
The one on the right (assuming he’s the defender) is Mexican, and the one on the left is Peruvian.
---
Right
---
Either way you fucked up. Noone ever got anywhere or made any dialogue by starting off with a giant "fuck you." By all means keep wasting your breath this way if it makes you feel better though. Sometimes you just gotta vent. Do you booboo
---
Did you win the game though?
---
Seems like a visual bug
---
Get out of here. Outback is great and likely going to be in proleagues

What are the rules that you try to go by when creating/reworking a map? Of course making them competitively viable is the endgame but what are specific things that you look for gameplay wise when creating new/reworking maps?

Sometimes it just takes a minute to show up in your inventory. I’ve had the same situation but the skin shows up a day later

Doc and his words of advice 👌🏼
---
You’re right. It has never happened to me, or anyone else. You know everything about everyones game /s
---
Would 100% be OP, and it would change the meta drastically, would make many sites totally undefendable
---
You are not alone , lad
---
I made the point that the One X could at least run it. Where there's a will there's a way and Ubisoft clearly has no intention of even trying to add it.
---
Dont get me wrong but facts are facts,beside that really cool cosplay.
---
I believe the leak said it’ll be a deplorable shield with a Mira style gas-canister on the back. When the gas-canister is shot it’ll create a pool of fire in front of the shield making it impossible to push that specific door.
---
My stuff is there where I go to college but I’m working in Seattle so I wouldn’t be able to move around with it.

Yeah my stack memes in casual once a week or so in a discord and sometimes we only have 4 and the other teammate can sometimes become a victim of the memes. We try to keep the TKing to once a match for the guy that’s solo. Obviously for the guys in the call it’s free game.

I didn't know you could play 5 v 5 with bots in this  game like call of duty.

Thought it was P2P, it used to happen all the time in Halo 2. People called it the "Standby glitch"

That's unfortunate, sorry to hear you lose mmr

---
they made it so if they leave mid interrogation it still reveals the enemy locations but if they leave before you start then nothing happens to them
---
How do we know there isn't a new map?
---
me too 
---
my arms however, did not 
---
these things are heavy
---
LOL
---
Not necessarily. It could maybe be like a military base so like Hereford but with a lot of jungle themed stuff. And they could design it to be spawn peek proof and runout deterrent
---
Jungle map at night would be neat
---
Yeah then that wasnt me because I don't think I killed anyone and it wasn't a claymore that killed me, but the location where he popped out was about the same
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Bruh it's frustrating in ranked now imagine this in casual.....like why ?
---
yeah i just lost two matches lol
---
Like I remember that it was easy for spawn peeking but I loved it anyways
---
Hey do you guys know if this outfit as well as the other summer ones are exclusive to the season? Will they leave the shop once y4s3 starts?

Frank Castle aka “Punisher”
---
3 Armor 3 Speed
---
Loadout:  EVERYTHING
---
Gadget: Plot Armor.  Punisher is literally unkillable.  Can take an absurd amount of bullets.  However, if he takes too much damage he drops from a 3 speed to a 2 speed.
---
Not really.
---
Yes it was posted by the r6 twitter
---
Mate look at the other replies, I've been corrected like 4 times now. Yes I messed up.

You are forced to make a new account

They never expect it
---
Every op has a grapple it’s what allows you to rappel
---
2Skull2Rain
---
I think it's a cool idea but it wont be very good. Like the op is gonna need good guns to make it viable
---
Dang!
---
I like Chalet, although it is pretty shite in terms of balance
---
Hey guys, CoreRoss here with Rainbow6 News
---
What you guys playing on? If PC just do newcomer.
---
Btw it's in custom still
---
Depends how it works.
---
Black OPs 4 ruin grapple hook? No thanks. Zipping across the map, nah.
---
Being able to quickly get to roofs/ windows, and being able to go up hatches? Yeah.
---
What happens if someone kills the cav and goes for the res then?
---
How many spawn peeks are still in the map?

I'm sorry, but for anyone who knows any Cyrillic alphabet this is gonna look ridiculous.

I think this is a pretty good summary
---
This is not temporary . Year 1 operators should stay in your account forever
---
You play on ps? That name looks familiar, pretty sure I've played with u before
---
You run into the issue of now you're punishing people who randomly disconnected due to internet stutter, game crashing or whatever.  The work around they have now isnt all that bad I guess.
---
That’s my biggest hope.  The gadget’s are cool but at the end of the day it’s the loadout that makes the operator.  Phantom Sight has been so boring with no new weapons.
---
I don't think getting wall-hacked by the all-seeing narrator reveals your identity.
---
It's the chinese new year skin that game out a couple of months ago. It's a nice skin, shame that it's unavailable now

As is customary!

Once you leave, your body stays in game for the rest of the round.  Ez PZ.

**Getting rushed by a toxic ash main smurf**

It was posted by official pages

That's their problem, not ubisofts, not their teams, or the other players.
---
They really act like it meant something I don’t think a single kill was gotten from “I couldn’t see their (whatever) because of camo!”
---
Siege servers are dedicated not P2P. You used to be able to get every IP address of players in the lobby but you can't anymore so I don't know if they used to be P2P
---
An outside map with small houses and halfwall covers and stuff. Kind of like the cowboy map but in the Jungle.
---
Omg I love the jungle aesthetic. Has anyone seen [Triple Frontier](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1488606/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_9)?
---
Basically, its about a bunch of special ops dudes that bust a drug cartel in the middle of the jungle. Huge mansion in the middle of the jungle, raining like crazy. It'd be an amazing scene for a map.
---
If he can't handle it at its worst he doesn't deserve it at its best.

Look at him.. not even concerned about that defuser smh

lol didn’t even realise that until now
---
Their still Dced, so they're just the same as an afk player
---
yep
---
New player? Vik in the user name? What do you know about a guy named busted junk
---
Because it's a terrible map from a competitive perspective and reworking it will enable it to enter ranked
---
Now that's how you start a game.

Pick recruit, play like you dont care and usually it ends with most meme-worthy matches, best enjoyed with good squad.
---
Disrespecting 3 russians and one uzbek is enough
---
I've never been able to afford Siege in the first place, I own it on two systems because it was bought for me.
---
In the US most people can't afford to live even if they *don't* make minimum wage, so assuming they have 20 bucks disposable income when most of us can't even get a savings going is pretty optimistic
---
He can be on windows which is huge pain in the ass. And it can take 2 bullets. If you can aim then rest in peace enemy team.
---
From what I know, the player base has consistently grown each season. What are you playing it on?
---
Is it cuul if I bring my juul into the convention center?

yes without a doubt

It is a steep learning curve though

Hello elvingamer101, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cpzwvy/a_perfect_game_with_no_bugs/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I thought overwatches system wasnt that bad, as they give you a lot of opportunities to earn the boxes. The limited time events for siege only allow you 1 or 2 free packs and then force the rest as paid.
---
You will have to persevere a little bit, but each time you get a kill, it’s so refreshing cuz you can see yourself improve overtime. The game is also more fun with friends
---
He is really good at rainbow, sorry I was being lazy about it.
---
Oh very much so, her guns are transparent foreshadowing, Ubi testing the water to see if people would freak out over them adding completely fake guns to the game. Surprise surprise the very next season the new ops both have fake guns in the Vector 308 and the Saritch
---
Well because gambling is fun and is not a requirement to play the game - it's a bonus, a fun reward. Technically you can play siege for 10 bucks and unlock almost everything by playing the game. 
---
If you have a gambling addiction - get help. If you dislike their system don't buy those event packs.
---
Get good pc and 144hz monitor and you want even touch ps.

Hello SSO-M, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cpzxop/ive_just_crashed_to_desktop_the_second_time_today/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Ps4 is nothing but boosters, ddossers and pingers who live and breath Siege and I don't think they play other games. The normal people who have to put up with their crap will probably jump to the new cod when it comes out.
---
But once you hop over said curve, the fun really begins.
---
Because the PDW9 is an attacker SMG.  The same way Nokk's guns are all defender primaries.
---
I was planning on buying it for Xbox
---
I've played it before as it was free to play to a weekend, 4 times
---
But what if I like some of the cosmetics but couldnt care less for most of them? The problem is not really the total cost or the content, it's just the pigeonholing of the system that only allows random chance. 
---
It's a sad tactic and I'm amazed at the amount of people who will defend it for siege, despite all the lashback other games get for doing it.
---
The sound is directional so you need a 5.1 headset to make it easier.. but yeah.. it takes a lot of getting used to.
---
It's also kinda.. spacial awareness.. if you hear roughly where someone is, you have to keep your eyes open too
---
Yeah there’s a solution, but if I’m not sober or just want to chill and mess around it’s aggravating. No I’m not yelling sweaty, it’s just cheap and a blow to the balls for no reason.
---
Meanwhile in casual
---
I never understand people who write ace in global chat after ace..
---
The uniform definitely looks better then the headgear that is supposed to go with that.
---
It was intended
---
yes. But still, it takes a little bit to get used to everything
---
the game seems to still be going strong it is for sure worth getting
---
I disagree that loadouts make the operator, because I believe their gadget is what makes them them. But I do strongly agree that loadouts are important, and I'm worried that Ubisoft is going to stop giving new weapons, or at least start rarely giving new weapons to operators.
---
Finally not an alpha pack video where some dude gets it to 99 percent by quitting games
---
People are not stuck in high gold/low plat because they are inconsistent. They are stuck because they *consistently make the same low percentage plays or rely on crutches*. Be patient in the first minute of the round, anticipate problems and plan solutions actively, don't play offense and defense backwards, and execute at the same time as your teammates.
---
But he already has the MPX, why replace a 9mm SMG with a different 9mm SMG with comparable stats for no reason? If it were a weapon that actually gave him some kind of advantage I’d be on board.
---
In addition both sides share shotguns and machine pistols so why would sharing SMG’s be weird?
---
The bed in The Fortress is probably king size so this would be music to kaids ears.
---
What rank are you playing at that you dont see Zofia?
---
It is without a doubt, extremely fun. I have no life, so i grinded for all of the operators and bought them using renown. That’s how much I play. And even still, I’m not good.
---
#YOU FU YOU FU YOU FUCKING MUPPET
---
Yea true,they are like yea we are fixing stuff and thats why theres a lack of content,but does nobody talk obout how they made the leaning bug a feature after they culdnt fix it??
---
And that thing is why i dont play ranked some angels are so broken and the game itself is as Muda from someordinarygamers said"just bandage over bandage"as i said im also super mad that i can get banned for saying ez but the dude with wallhacks can have it his way,honestly if someone made a game similat to siege and put some effort,id already be on it,they have no idea how much potential and shit they wasted and i fell as while god forbit this game was menaged by EA,any other studio than ubi whuld give the game a lot more love,the sad thing is tho,most studios are trash these days,while if rocstar for instance had developed the game sure it whuld come to pc just oround now after 4 years,it whuld have a ton of content and no bugs you fell me?
---
Sorry for the rant.
---
You must have missed everything with the midseason event loot packs.
---
Content creators were even calling them out on it.
---
His gun is good but it has some funky recoil and takes a bit to get used to. And his AR is just for the .50 Beowulf memes. His gadget is good but with the sound nerf, which was needed, you can easily tell when he is doing his thing so you have to be really tactful with him.

Stop assuming that you're better than everyone else. I see it all of the time, some low plat thinks I got lucky 3333 times in a row and won't listen. Unless you're a god who's already gotten to diamond without your teams help, you need to work with the team. Pay attention to where everyone is even if you aren't with them. Ask questions instead of waiting for calls. Give fucking calls. Refragging, utility denial, and rotation locking is the name of the game.
---
They're coming out with a new/reworked version of kanal
---
If you like strategy involved in an FPS, and a real reliance on team based play, yes, buy it. There are a few hurdles to enjoyment. One, there are a lot of toxic people in the community; avoid this by using your mic to find people to squad up with. There are many people that will help new players get better. Two, the skill gap is high. Search and destroy type games with low amount of time require good map knowledge and strats, and a reliance on each member to remember their function and do it with minimum errors. Ive been playing since it came out and it’s still my favorite game almost 4 years later. Some of my friends have become burnt out on it though. I play on PS4.
---
The operation isn't out yet. This is an official teaser
---
Yeah I've encountered it twice on console
---
I'd say lesion belongs there more than kapkan
---
I haven't heard any response though! I combed through the post announcing it and found just as many people saying there was nothing wrong with it as I did people who were against it.
---
I like both skyscraper and tower, they’re both really fun maps
---
Everyone Smurf’s you fucking tard. There’s no problem with it
---
Idc about colors, they shouldn’t have touched Hereford. Hereford was fine where it was, not being competitive. It’s so mazy and big.
---
Not going to happen. A) split player base B) you'll have to have a separate ranking system.
---
I'm actually optimistic if they have UNIQUE guns. I don't even care if they're unique shitty guns, that's better than reused shitty guns.
---
I feel you dude. I‘m at around 1300 hours I think, and this was one of the greatest games I got to play. But its just not enjoyable anymore. Makes no sense to sit down and warm up to be angry half an hour later.
---
Rework as in adjusting the map layouts and stuff, like, Hereford was a rework, although they said they aren't going to do a rework on that level anymore.

Hello L3w1s_m1t_N3mer0, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cq00ja/thought_this_would_fit_well/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.

how would i have done that?
---
He asked for opinions, thats mine. And what is yours?
---
/r/perfectlycutscreams
---
So with me giving a solution to a problem - Which is open for discussion! - is me complaining about it? The community is beging Ubisoft to do something but Ubisoft simply can’t, it is impossible to recognise. Matimio is making vids about it monthly, other youtuber are discussing it. It doens’t give Siege on console a Good look which it defenitely deserves. And i’m not gonna switch because All my RL friends are on ps4.
---
Ok? Do you know the other symbolism of embers tho? It’s not JUST dark souls. 
---
Your just too into it.
---
Rook
---
I recently made the switch and it was a lot smoother than I had thought it was gonna be. It definitely takes some getting used to and using someone else's recommended settings could not work for you. What I found was best was just running through games and in downtime adjust your settings till you get something comfortable.
---
As far as working a keyboard, it just takes getting used to. Read through the control settings, most of them are good by default but depending on your playstyle having some keys being closer might be better for you. Its all up to opinion and practice though.
---
Good luck friend 😁😁
---
2 - 3 hooks should be enough
---
They nerfed him because they thought he would be to strong compared to warden, now neither of them are as good as Ubi intended
---
I agree with ur bandit main
---
He is definitely not useless, you just can’t use him as an op entry fragger anymore. You can still use him to deny spraying through smoke and for holding angles with an advantage of having a bright yellow target instead of bland colours.
---
Yeah, I forgot a word in there. Point stands, these are all CoC offenses, so tough luck mate.
---
What are the devs goal when they make/rework a map, which turns out to be unbalanced???
---
You know that at a bare minimum, a PC costs about $1,200?  That’s not current-gen items.  The specs for the new console series are going to compete with some PCs out there are will be just as fine to play on.  PC elitism isn’t cool, my guy.
---
Drugs
---
This community sucks. I know the first thing that happened to my friend when he tried it during a free weekend was he got votekicked instantly. It sucks that there are groups of people who 4 stack with the explicit intention of just making the game hell for the 1 random.
---
Jail
---
Do you keep losing or do you just have horrible luck?
---
I fell like you are attacking me for no reason,i just asked jezz,no need to downvote comments and go all into it.
---
All i said is there is a bonefire and its called ember rise,its fitting a ds player whuld assume its a small easter egg.
---
Undercover
---
Beat me to it 😂😂
---
HAHAHA YOU ARE SO FUNNY I AM CRYING HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA TEACH HOW TO BE AS FUNNY AS YOU HAHAHAHA
---
Ok I don’t really care at this point, I get it you are a PC elitest that can’t understand the fact that some people prefer console to PC .
---
I don’t think the extra deagle shots were necessary, especially after the aim
---

Btw you are here so you can explain me:
---
"Suggesting someone has mental health issues when being harassed/bullied by other people =/= "a different opinion""
---
That's opinion without a doubt, however you called it != to different opinion therefore - it's also your opinion?
---
Now you will feel the full power of the tk
---
K
---
oh ok... guess I'll only ever play competitive maps with a 5 stack -.-'
---
you are trolling right? you can get a better pc for 500$ you dont have to spend 1200 where tf did you even get that number from as a bare minimum wtf ??????
---
Brilliant idea and balancing but I’d let Alibi keep her impacts.
---
HA YA SACK
---
*YEAR 4* Season 3
---
 Which is kind of ridiculous when you think about it. 5 years to get matchmaking decent
---
1) restrict defense team to objective so they can lockdown/prep the objective
---
2) no more droning in the beginning of matches!
---
He’s agreeing with you bud
---
Echo is easy
---
Well i mean you just attacked me for asking a opinion,im pretty sure you have a small bit of toxicity in you as well.
---
Get rook
---
It still annoys me that Smoke's icon has 2 filters but his mask has 1
---
I never downvoted at all, but ok. And I’m not attacking you, I’m just saying your probably just making comparisons that don’t have anything to with each other.
---
Tk
---
Why did I hear the death noise
---
I definitely hear you there. The 3 you mentioned should for sure be gone though in my (and most people’s) opinion. 
---
I agree with the skill level comment you made.
---
That's really stupid. If I'm buying a console game, that game better fucking work with console hardware. 
---
And my console is set up in the living room, not somewhere I can comfortably use a mouse and keyboard.
---
Surely if you're going to "remove input" you'd remove the keyboard and mouse input.
---
In not even going to touch on the "shooter which is best to play with MnK" because I will be a dick about it
---
Why are you going through my profile damn. I’m sorry
---
Ooooo
---
Ah there it is. So I’m not allowed to play ranked just because me and my friends can’t play together 24/7?
---
No, rook is the only operator you'll ever need
---
can you not just limit to friends that can invite you in privacy settings or something?
---
Between those 3, lesion
---
Ok and thank you for your opinon,just lash out like that,thats how people get mad and into a fight,and i dont want that.
---
Honestly both but its mostly luck
---
You have a amazing kd
---
US? I never really have issues on EU, there'll be the rare TK'er but it's very rare.
---
At least it doesn't have a mind of its own
---
Conceal don’t feel don’t let them knoooowwww
---
Well now they knoooowwww
---
Oh  lol now I feel like a dick... I didn’t even read what he put 🤣
---
I'm at the point where I believe if you using M&amp;K and on console then you are a copper player and need to feel good about yourself by giving yourself a 1000x advantage on console kids.
---
Edit: copper on PC* not console
---
He said he isn't good at controlling recoil though
---
I don’t know why I’m going to bother responding to this pretty obvious bait but here we go.
---
A current retail console is about $299.  A PC that would be able to run Siege would run about $500, that’s true.  However, a PC at $500 can’t run Siege WELL, which would be the entire point of switching to a PC.  For graphics cards and other necessary hardware, a PC would run someone between $1,000 and $1,300 at a minimum.  If they’re going for real quality, they can spend upwards of $2,000, probably more if they wanted current-gen equipment.
---
Don’t talk about what you don’t know, my guy.  It’s embarrassing.
---
Gotta love Xbox. Kinda the reason I haven’t played the game in a while. That and I just got Overwatch
---
Quick! Delete this before MeatyMarley sees this!
---
Do you and your team have a map that you believe is the "model" of how a Siege map should look, feel, and function? Do you yourself have a personal favorite? Or perhaps a map (besides Kanal) that you worked on that you are the most proud of?
---
What is a setting for a new map that you would really like to see put into the game?
---
Is there another game (any genre) where the level design particularly inspires some of your work in Siege? Is there somewhere else you go for inspiration?
---
Sigh, please tell me this is a shit post of some sort
---
Kaid is actually Harold
---
💗
---
Imagine dying to someone named Goyo
---
No, sadly there’s no map this season - or next. We’re just getting a Kanal re-work.
---
wat time was that cuz i had a full lobby lag spike at like 1:00 maybe
---
Yes there is. You’re pushing lower ranks down for your own entertainment when you should be playing at your own level.
---
Wouldn't they break when they take Down the barricade? Or am I not ascended enough to get the start?
---
Stick together when you enter the build. Helps to prevent ambushes.
---
Practice setting up cross fires with teammates. The overlapping fields help to get kills or trades. This helps with defending and flushing enemies out of positions.
---
Communicate with your teammates. 5 to 7 words Ask for clarification and double check. If you dont want calls or want less, let people know.
---
Learn the maps. Learn where common transition holes are and which floors and ceilings lead where. Vertical play is very strong in this game.
---
K/D mean nothing if prioritize kills over objective play.
---
Isn’t Kanal getting reworked in either season 3 or 4 of year 4? Perhaps this is the one?
---
No dude all good,i always do that with any reply as im bored af,tho i just wanna point out as i did in my post dont lash out that much,be more polite in answers and opinions,the dev thing as well i didnt see that but i whuld not be suprised if people where trolling you cause you where screaming at them.
---
Not saying you did but you know what i mean.
---
I don’t see anything wrong
---
Sadly not. We only get one map this year, which was Outback in the first season. The rest are just map re-works.
---
*While we were busy studying the meta, they were busy studying the abstract...*
---
And people didn't know what his loadout was gonna be, I wasted 50k renown on those 2 ops and would really love to get it back
---
Well I don’t have clash or lesion, but my friends do and I would go lesion
---
i teamkill people who shoot my mozzie drones
---
A weapon to surpass Metal Gear?!?!
---
You know they can't do anything about it so what's the point in complaining about it
---
Glad the lube made the photo
---
"Ashen one..."
---
I don't think all ops should have a grapple.. the grapple should be an optional item instead of a grenade or claymore.
---
When you play thunt turn off vsync in the settings, itll let the frame rate be higher
---
They keep doing this ip to the point where I alt f4 every match in progress
---
I like that you can be spawn peeked. The fact that you are in a hostile environment from the get go makes all of siege a heart pounding moment. 
---
That being said, spawnpeeking like any other aspect of the game, needs to be balanced. Back in the old days of siege, there were a few angles to where attackers could be killed literally immediately. That was unacceptable. Now though, spawnpeeking requires at least some skill.
---
Not to say "git gud" but you can learn to avoid and or fight spawn peekers. Find which spawns are garbage and advoid them. Peek windows that you know there are possible spawn peekers and prepare for someone to be there or even better, leave a drone on your entrance point and know for certain. Or you could even kill ten seconds in spawn to deter people who are holding angles.
---
It's super frustrating to get killed in spawn before firing a single bullet, but it's super satisfying to slap kids who think that they are about to get an easy pick
---
I wonder what glitches thi... I mean entertainment this op will bring
---
Meanwhile..... Its been 6 months since the R6 credits store has been locked for certain regions.
---
I also said Valkyrie is a good alternative. Her guns have no recoil whatsoever
---
I don't have him either and don't really like his playstyle, but I would still go lesion
---
Literally spicy Clash.
---
Look up some vids on drone spots,and what i usually do is if im with a pre made team(usually am)just take a flor and stick to it,let your team know if its clear and wiggle your mouse oround and jump if you get shot at.
---
Bulshit meter maxed out
---
...you do realize that it even though it was a prototype it was a real gun right? The Six12 and Six12SD are also prototypes that were never used. Not going into mass production doesn’t make a design fake. And to be exact Zofias LMG is partially based off a Krytac but also a Valkyrie Armament Beltfed M4 (to which the Krytac is also based off). Considering that in the game world team rainbow is a joint **world wide** counter terrorist operation with an unlimited budget, so in that infinity I’m sure they could make a custom gun such as the V308.
---
I don't believe so. I've change all my setting like that I think. I'll double check.
---
No it was just now. They only lagged when we attacked and if they got plant down it would lag
---
