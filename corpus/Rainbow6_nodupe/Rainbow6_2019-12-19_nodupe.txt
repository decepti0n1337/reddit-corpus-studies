That's what I think too

We will be at DCC in march again. Saturday is Siege day for our group
---
In the top, the health of IQ went down as you were shooting, therefore you shot iq.
---
to my surprise!
---
Weird.. IQ‚Äôs health dropped. So it was either a skin that caused you to see her as- wait actually nvm it tells you about teammates.. Maybe it just bugged and the team name didn‚Äôt show.
---
Just one more question! Totally forgot to ask this. Is there aim assist in multiplayer on console?
---
I would love this TBH, same with Blackbeard's Assault Rifle
---
Srry dude don't like to sad bad news but his ban won't be appealed. You're friend was probably running a script altering application or hacks in the background (Even for a different game) and battleye must have detected it. Its you're friend's fault and not battleye or ubi's fault, specially after manual revision.
---
But how? I don't see any IQs on my screen, I'm pretty sure she was in the site like 10m behind me.
---
I want more AK variants. Why would special ops use an AK47 when an AKM or AK-12 is available? What would be best imo is interesting and unique AK variants like the AK-9 and AN-94 or even AK inspired weapons like the Vintorez or Val.
---
The ARX is on the Y5S1 attacker so we‚Äôll see what‚Äôs up
---
Tone down your pasive aggressive comments.... Sound didn't change. You could check yourself in all the change logs from every season.

I heard it creeping up in the background and got chills, love that song as well. Fantastic job
---
The idea is that by reducing the amount you get it gets you into your ‚Äútrue rank‚Äù faster. The issue is the system doesnt account for leavers and trash teammates. 
---
Sure the grind at the end of the season can be painful, but i always enjoy it bcuz it allows me to experiment with different ops, and try new strats
---
oh, didn't know this thanks for the info bois.
---
Nah that's obviously valk. IQ was on the other site behind me, and the valk ran around to the door on the other side and I died to her. Nobody else was even in that direction.
---
That's good
---
Well.... did you clutch the round??
---
Nope. People will still complain because we need another AR that has slightly better than average dmg, slightly lower than average RoF, or any mixture. We literally have every balanced type of weapon in the game. I get that people want more weapon models, but is that really necessary?
---
I was then only one on my team for a solid minute. Essentially it was the enemy team's fault. I get what you mean tho, when I see an enemy echo we try to get him asap.
---
Yeah I'm exited to see what new blood will do to siege. While the game has be improving each season it has definitely felt like 2 steps forward 1 step back.
---
Great video, I am so happy Thatcher got a lot of time as he is my main. Wanna go for a game ?
---
What was the song in the background?
---
Could balance by being on a three armor.
---
We lost and we didnt even get to play. Fix your shit ubi.
---
Ngl echo is kinda thicc no homo
---
Considering they did that with Wamai but in reverse, they can definitely do this now. I have been wanting this since seeing Wamai
---
** dial up Internet noises **
---
You will die in 3... 2...
---
Yes. But fix the fucking recoil, it‚Äôs still annoying
---
That was awesome!
---
I was observing the event and only saw you a few times when going to toilet or on the screen in the production. You guys nailed it. Awesome cosplays and this is an amazing picture. We'll done all of you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You thin kit went well pls it went amazing
---
I mean, Ubi has straight up said this is part of the reason so I'm not sure why you are acting like its some big revelation.
---
For example, they have talked about how making all the universal skins fit on new weapons is an absolute nightmare and takes way too much time (relative to the payoff at least) to accomplish.
---
They are cutting back on new guns because;
---
* the more guns the harder it is to balance
---
* legal issues
---
* its a time sink
---
* there is already more then enough in the game and many dont ever get used anyway
---
I completely disagree, it becomes much harder to balance ops when you DON‚ÄôT introduce new weapons. Take Warden for example, he sucks, a cool adjustment would be to buff his MPX, but that would also buff Valkyrie who is already really strong.
---
Even tho there are a lot of trash people and bosters i have faith in the community to know better and extra nice vid ceep up the good work!!!
---
Thank you ^^ we‚Äôll try to be there for most events like this in the future
---
Shit . they removed it in Shifting Tides then . It was there when Ember Rise was a thing
---
Are you saying you quit after it found you the match? Because then you're in the match, quitting was your decision at that point

I didn‚Äôt die from that guy also so you ARE taking it out of proportion READ THE POST BEFORE YOU CRITICIZE IT dumbass
---
R6 movie when?
---
But if they are still getting rff anyway then your system just gives someone a free tk. This is more toxic. Imagine if you accidently tk someone then someone else tks you and you get rff and they dont. I bet you come right back to this subreddit to complain.
---
Well fuck. Now I‚Äôm in a ranked mood. Very nice man. Did you upload this to YouTube? I would definitely love to show my friends this.
---
Mlm
---
Lucky :(
---
No, because that‚Äôs the point of the intentional team kill system. You don‚Äôt get tagged for RFF if it‚Äôs an accident.

That's my bad for MISREADING it, I thought you died. But you killed them so you had to have been able to see them? Just go play terrorist hunt, since your anger seems to spike up easily.
---
But what if you get revenge tked before it has been declared accidental or not. It isnt an instant process.
---
I have this one friend who has never gotten black ice in all his years of gaming and we make fun of him for it

Whatever the case, I don't have the time to argue with small peen kids. Enjoy your day and your trash game.

Im debating doing it, I have a YT channel but its not at all this type of content. Its all funny moments from r6
---
Thanks for the free karma
---
idk what you mean
---
More at 11 when we also talk about players who don't drone!
---
People do that all the time anyways. If their point of joining the game is to tk, they won‚Äôt wait and hope that you tk somebody on the team accidentally before they can tk you. That just doesn‚Äôt happen
---
Gottem
---
Here from r/all. Great edit man! I want to play the game now..
---
The recoil stay the same tho, but I guess it's more noticeable with it.
---
Question, who was the guy fighting in the bar? Looked like thatcher but im not too sure.
---
You think I have anger issues based on something I wrote on Reddit like how does that make sense thank you for diagnosing me with anger issues kind sir you saved me a trip to the doctors. Ok but actually I have a question. Do you have brain problems because you‚Äôre making a lot of wild accusations my guy

Wow a drone kill so hard to get

No they don't. They only exist in situations. I usually play t-hunt on hard and theres no bombers
---
Here, I'll throw you a bone. Getting spawn peeked sucks. But it's 100% your fault in most cases. Learn the maps. Learn to know what site people are at by audio cues or let some other sod find the bomb site. Use that first drone to watch the spawn peeks that are near your spawn. Move accordingly to deny the peek or contest it with the knowledge you have. Drones are useful. use them.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Cool thank man
---
Thanks bruh!
---
Np!
---
i agree you with so much, this game will always have a special place in my heart and it even got me some friends in school when i had none. FIRE edit btw
---
They changed it so now your previous rank affects where you place. So everyones is different
---
If you say so
---
No
---
He'll be too op
---
What if they continue on a sequel with a new engine but all your ops, renown, skins etc carry over?
---
Same someone explain why every person under the sun spells my name with a J even if they just read it?
---
What billion other reasons are you referring to?
---
Wow that was pretty great lol
---
not spawn peeks we spawn at outback gas-station or another site on a different map and all five of them run out and wipe my team in seconds of the round starting
---
2:36 is also so smooth holy moley
---
thnks a lot. Yeah, people on the R6 Discord can be interesting sometimes.
---
I get that this is sarcasm but it's a recent post and it's worth doing to change habits, especially because the average age on Reddit is negative
---
Seriously?
---
Seconds of the round? sounds like a spawn peek to meeee. If you're getting run out on while contesting windows or balconies on outback... pro tip.. they cant run out on you if you get in the building, no?
---
I was the Hibana here! Great game, wish we had more like it. Merry Christmas.
---
I was the green sign, have a good holiday guys
---
Bruh I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic in the slightest, I genuinely didn‚Äôt know that and will try to fix it
---
Obviously yes.  Name 2 other reasons that could happen, that make sense.
---
Wait what skin is everyone referring to? How can a skin be toxic lol what
---
Your reason doesn't make sense though
---
Just make a new account and grind to 30 without characters. Then you can play him every round. It‚Äôs great.
---
Oh, cool. I just saw I had been downvoted and assumed.
---
there running out. **RUNNING**
---
**INTRUDER ALERT!**
---
**RED ALIBI**
---
**IS ON SITE!!**
---
It was him. He said he would do it and he did it, twice! It would be a very unlikely coincidence that the server just so happened to get very slow (up to 15 mins) while he was claiming he can do it. Another guy in the group said its the second time someone does that to him and they do it by leaving the game and rejoining during the loading of the next round while preventing themselves to fully load(?) the map, or something along those lines.
---
See , you don't have one.  You don't even know what you're talking about, lol.  I'm a programmer.  Give me some viable reasons, just two out of your billion reason grab bag that makes sense.
---
what system and server u play
---
Which is lazy. A whole year of r6 and in that year the only gun balancing they did was add 10 bullets to the 417 which nobody still uses and took away 5 bullets from twitch. The op balancing they did was nothing throughout this year. All they did was nerf then buff glaz and nerf jackal a little bit and I think echo. Which is a useless nerf/buff. Considering jackal is still always banned same as echo. I‚Äôm not to sure about them map balancing this year but I‚Äôm sure its insignificant. They had a whole year to deliver new content and we got basically a seasons worth of ops. They are lazy I‚Äôm sorry.
---
**YOU CAN SPAWN PEEK BY RUNNING OUT OF THE BUILDING** see peeks like the front door of bank for reference. I'm trying to help here. Drink it in, friend. Let it settle.
---
&gt;  I'm a programmer.
---
So you know how this game works better than the people who wrote it?
---
&gt; Give me some viable reasons, just two out of your billion reason grab bag that makes sense.
---
Why? Where are these videos...
---
You are too nervous. Make a smurf, grind that shit to plat, it‚Äôs a smurf make ballsey plays. Come back to main, ur plat game is less stressful
---
I miss all the old operator videos when you bought them üòÖ amazing edit too
---
Same thing with explosives adding the ringing not to mention your screen shaking like crazy even if it's a whole floor above you.
---
This isn't a bad Idea, but I don't think there's an easy way to implement this. In lower ranks I could see teams just trolling one player until they leave so that a player can have 3 reinforcements or drones. Also what type of system would they implement for disturbing these, would it go to the top player making them even more powerful or would they go to the bottom player which would incentives some players to do poorly
---
It is a skin where on some maps or backgrounds you can practically be invisible and they‚Äôre so good they are banned in pro play
---
Haven‚Äôt played in two seasons. Making me expedite my return. Great work!
---
You can't discourage toxic people from tking, they won't care about getting killed cos of it. Goyo proved that by killing himself so you would get banned. Even so with your system in place, 2 people in a squad can still tk before punishment. Again it sounds like you care more about revenge against kids who outsmarted you than playing the game properly.
---
its a run out
---
No, better than you though, that's what I'm saying.  Prove me wrong with your points.  I'm not even at home, tmrw, you will have a video.
---
You're delaying bc you're full of it.  You have no reasons, you have no cue what you're talking about it, and now you're dodging.  
---
You could easily prove me wrong with just one reason, go for it and I will admit I'm wrong.

Although nokk can shoot or move through one without getting noticed when using her ability just so you know

Your editing is amazing, the way each clip started and ended carried so much emotion. And holy shit did this make me realize how far this game has come... Each character with their own short scenes that define them, I love it.

There‚Äôs only two real ways that this happens nowadays:

1) the diamond player is diamond in a different server, but silver in another
---
2) the diamond player queues with unranked players who have a low rank (unranked players actually do have a rank, it‚Äôs just hidden, but the system doesn‚Äôt stop them from queueing with anyone else)
---
bingo bongo your opinion Is wrongo and you should take ur fat ass back to the congo
---
Im about to tag some little girls with seed if you know what I mean
---
you're right my bad, I will take down the video immediately.
---
yeah idk what u did, but I can confirm the game is 77gb total
---
I know someone else probably said this but I can't stop watching this
---
The song fits so well
---
Dude went salt farming and came back with bananas
---
Did you post this on Youtube?
---
Bloody hell this Video is amazing. Good job on it. I bloody love siege and hope it stays around for a long time, even if it‚Äôs a buggy game. It‚Äôs a great game to play. Good song choice for the video.
---
It's vague enough to mean anything, and given the stunt they tried to pull and how poor their "apology" was, and how they continued with some of the censorship anyway (removing the words "casino" and "drug" from objective names), I wouldn't put it past them.
---
TK is where it‚Äôs at. Don‚Äôt trust anyone.
---
That is correct. I was just referring to the AK47 being outdated and a spec operator would be more inclined to use an updated AK pattern rifle like the AKM or AK-12.
---
Yeah all joking aside it is a multinational counterterror group haha. I loved the book in middle school. Even read the Bear and the Dragon, that is a *long* book
---
In all honesty, ah this point I feel like they don‚Äôt want to help me and are hoping that if they keep fobbing me off enough I‚Äôll just give up or forget about it. It seems like such an easy thing to help with.... they told me they could see I purchased a booster and I have taken multiple photos of my screen to show I don‚Äôt have one and I‚Äôm getting ZERO extra renown... It is quite unbelievable that it‚Äôs come to me complaining about this on the reddit after almost three weeks of trying to get the issue resolved through their official support....

Love this game it is the game I always come to but ubisoft still cannot fix simple bugs and are very incompetent.
---
With every new patch they manage to go one step forward and two steps back instead of prioritizing on solving this issues they just keep adding skins
---
For example - is it really that hard to fix the barricade glitch when u melee it and the wood still stays on blocking your view ?
---
I wasnt even talking to you kid
---
When you say year 2 is 15,000 do you mean to purchase all year 2 operators it costs that much or do you mean the individual operators. This shit is so expensive man and its gonna take ages to get that much renown.

I personally am a fan of jager especially if you‚Äôre new to the game. His equipment is easy to place and requires little to no knowledge of how to play
---
I've explained this about a hundred times, and it's really disheartening that people assume so much based on barely 2 minutes of a full game. They started harassing the other girl because she had a picture of herself in game. I tried to ignore, as I always do when people attack .. but she was really quiet and I knew exactly what she was going through. I started defending her in  solidarity in all chat, saying that I was also a woman, so what? and generally arguing back to the other team to try and make her feel better about the situation. They kept being toxic and I told her "Just focus, all we need to do is win to teach them a lesson" - that was during the first 2 rounds. I muted the guy who was doing the most talking so I could focus and not look at what he was writing. We end up 2-2 and my team has a good attitude and we're trying to play well because nobody on my team wanted them to win either (obviously). People start falling off and I'm left alone as you see in the clip. 
---
I use windows game bar to clip my games and the most I have it set to clip is the last 3 minutes,  which is what I posted here. The context that I have was my exchange of words with the other girl and the french guy saying he's proud of us because he was her friend and he was REALLY upset about the situation. I'm sorry I don't have anything else and if you don't want to believe me, that's honestly okay. But please believe that this happens to us all the time and we're really tired of it. 
---
I didn't think this post would blow up this way, trust me. I don't care about the karma, I care about having a discussion about the toxicity.
---
Because he thinks console people are bad because they‚Äôre console. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.

While companies brag to their investors calling customers who suffer from addiction problems ‚Äúwhales‚Äù the last thing we should be doing is defending these scumbags.

Its not your kids or your families problem, for now.

There's still some other youtubers that don't lie, but do titles like "DOES THIS KEYBOARD TILT HELP YOUR AIM?!?" and the clicks would probably be the same
---
I hate getting killed in this game then seeing someone make a reddit post about it. Third time this month. Gg tho
---
Haha, were you in this game?
---
Heres hoping for change. I wasn't really happy with the recent direction of the game. Unfitting cosmetics and events everywhere, monetization in every corner and the new operator gadgets where carbon copies of existing ones. Mostly they just took a defender and made them an attacker or the other way around.
---
Unfortunately not everything of that will change. But the development of Siege is in dire need of change. You can't keep people happy forever with "more of the same".
---
Good idea

Haters will say it was photoshopped.

Dang. We‚Äôre you in this game? Gg

It amazes me how many people don‚Äôt believe in the power of communication in this game.

The issue is from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs similar to R4c recoil when the R4c doesn‚Äôt have a vert. While I‚Äôd LOVE to see this it would be on a fragger with an okay ability

Good lord that a quick round. Thanks.
---
I low key think this looks better than the actual set

Ah, don‚Äôt worry just a little touch for the next time

more attachments is more for new players to learn. There is already so much a new player has to know to perform well and a plethora of different barrels and grips can be overwhelming.

Imo, it's a good thing that we don't have a battle pass. If they introduced one, they would have to pump out more cosmetics and the quality of them wouldn't be good. Always Quality&gt;Quantity

Bandit is showing Jager his double A‚Äôs
---
I feel It varies of which the opposing team chooses; if there was nobody with breaches, then It could possibly change the game, but that is a highly dubious presumption. If your team was using team coordination, you could possibly stop them from breaching in the first place. It, both, takes skill, and the way the entire teams plays.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Havent seen anything on this at all. is this new for this season? i notice it matches her legendary ar which im super lucky to get as a zofia main.... ngl it kind of looks like any other normal camo'd skin. proleague &gt; automation ?

How‚Äôs your scoreboard like that?
---
Holy shit my dude. This is truly top tier. Well done.
---
No, attackers are a little bit weaker (not as they where in past years ) but with kali i believe meta can change
---
But even with those two, if they use their cams at least, that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs bringing in intel and info on enemies where abouts. I‚Äôd rather have a sub par valk or maestro than a sub par castle. While he can win game he can also be a big reason you lose them, like if he closes off the obj.

I don't get where you at man. She was born and raised in India, enlisted into the Indian army. I don't know why you think she is not an Indian.
---
Ok, Kali is non-indian operator born in India and named after the Indian Goddess of War.
---
Something called overwolf. Download it and it can show predications and k/d, matches played, abandoned, average win rate, etc
---
‚ÄúOh shit!‚Äù We‚Äôve been spotted
---
The first line of my first comment. The rest of it was just counter arguments to your comment.
---
She's an Indian. But she's not an Indian citizen. That's it. Nothing else.
---
Actually it‚Äôs r6 tracker not overwolf. Might be a combo nation of both actually idk
---
Agreed brother.
---
Lvl 90, I've got 4 black ices and 2 legendary skins. Ubi loves me
---
Cool. Glhf.
---
Ah ok I got it so download overwolf then there‚Äôs a r6 tracker plugin for siege
---
Not to mention only the defenders can play the waiting game. I find defense easier to play too. Theres more things to keep in mind while attacking personally, including running outside and spawnpeeks. But when you do kill a runner or spawnpeeker, it feels amazing.
---
Acog is the Devil's Sight, its benefits just outweigh its cons too heavily, like being able to see a bigger clearer image of a person when not even in full view as opposed to the tiny pixels short sights give, giving the acog a headstart in reacting. But mainly because spawnpeekers use it do i hate it xd
---
Not funny didn‚Äôt laugh
---
Probably until mid-season or something? They have a fix, or a good lead to a fix on the TTS currently, so it‚Äôs just a matter of shipping it.
---
First off, I didn‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt believe you, I just mentioned why we might be skeptical. It‚Äôs not disheartening that we‚Äôre looking at what we see and pointing out what was said is not seen. What is disheartening is how many people go out and make things up for karma. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre skeptical. Also, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm saying toxicity is okay, and I apologize people are dumb enough to do something like this. I hope we‚Äôre able to curb this toxicity and make the community more accepting of all gamers
---
Yeah not a fan either, I'd prefer just the universal plain white
---
server?
---
Except for Frost ;)
---
Yeah.. might be just that.. no doubt.
---
Nice clip tho.
---
Ps: you are in denial and it is quite sad my dude.
---
Their team: 2 plats, a gold 2, and then 2 silvers
---
Our team: all silver 2
---
Are you being sarcastic or serious
---
Hahahaha xD hab ihn mir gekauft
---
You have only played 17 games thats nothing
---
Yes.

Too strong.

Other stats can mean more then rank
---
As a 2 speed, no thanks, not even to warden.
---
3 speed and acog is fine.
---
I think most people can relate but... I have encountered EVERY single reaction described in a game at some point.
---
^(Some were said by me when I rage but this is not relevant ok? f\*\*\* off you hardstuck plat3.)
---
Idk, it's been fine for me.
---
The prediction doesn‚Äôt just go off of rank man. They had like what a 94% chance to win
---
What region do you play? NAW?
---
EU but I don‚Äôt mind switching
---
The wall next to the bomb was soft though, Monty could easily have gotten the wall bang if valkyrie went to break the diffuser.
---
Wow, so cool.
---
Yeah but i can see their win rate and kd there. I would think that plat II would have better stats.
---
How did that match go btw?
---
I mean I am on Xbox it‚Äôs not as easy as it is on pc
---
Sound proofing would be expensive.
---
Instead just get over ear headphones.
---
IQ making nazi sign, I see what you did here.
---
Damm dude, thats some galaxy brain shit
---
This is definitely not true. Move your sensitive around and get a mouse that has a button on it to change dpi and find one you're comfortable with. Also you should change the field of view to make it as large as it can go so you can see as much around you as possible.
---
We actually won. I looked him up on the actual r6 tracker website and he was only a silver in America but a plat in Asia servers. However he did come out with 10 kills by the end of the game even with 150 ping
---
Is there any way to know the number of players on the SA server in terms of statistics ? As the matchmaking is taking some times to launch a match, I think it is normal though
---
How does that handle my voice and my other rooms lmao
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon

Could someone explain, I haven't seen goyo used at all, do you lose points for blowing it up, or did you break another gadget on the explosion?

Good news. The results have just come in, and ping abuse doesn't exist. Feel free to carry on believing it does, though. Whatever it takes to justify your losses.

Can you elaborate a bit how did Wamai and Kali "shift meta in regards to gunplay"?

Is a 30 second timer normal? I‚Äôm starting to question my sanity

Oh good, if you're actually a programmer than you can easily understand the technical reason why ping abuse doesn't exist. Here you go  [https://i.redd.it/98wjre7v9z341.png](https://i.redd.it/98wjre7v9z341.png)

Jesus dude I'm surprised you actually care this much to be acting like this over and input. I've said multiple times it's not for skill reasons, I play casual 90% percent of the time and kinda hate ranked and the people who play it so no I don't think I need to uninstall, your just salty because you think everyone who uses it should be a god vs controller, it's just more comfortable to me and I enjoy it more it's as simple as that, but whatever, think what you want about it.
---
Thanks for the explanation dude! I‚Äôve never watched E sports before but I do LOVE siege
---
Kids these days spend to much time on their phones.

* you‚Äôre
---
I guess I'm not a man then I really don't care, I've used controller before and have had problems with it which is part of the reason why I don't anymore.

Nice leaning mate...don't talk about meta when you can barely play.

I'm not going for perfect grammar so that's pointless and doesn't make your argument any better just because you call out a simple mistake.

---
That‚Äôs been crystal clear. And the reality is that you have no argument to stand on, as it has clearly been proven by the multiple replies from different gamers  including pc players.
---
as a non R6 player, what the fuck happened between 0:28 and 0:30
---
same, out of instinct i think to myself "fuck" before i realise this is real life not r6
---
Whats been proven? That I use it because I want to play better vs just using it because I like it more? Make some sense before making a post.
---
Pls keep center of sight at chest or head altitude.
---
I'd recommend watching the pros play, it'll help you learn new strats and it's entertainingly to watch 
---
The matches are quite long so if you don't have an hour to watch a match is recommend checking out a channel called SiegeGG, they usually post highlights that are about 10-15 minutes long
---
Ayye man the motivation from that won us the game and I was smurfing lol
---
OMFGüòÇü•∞üòç
---
You win..
---
At what cost
---
I remember thinking this when the first Battlefield 3 gameplay trailer dropped. Turned out to just be a quick time event. So disappointed.
---
If you have been plat with a k/d of 3...
---
Solo/ duo q
---
Oh... Thats sad, i thought i found something interesting
---
If a team doesn't want to work together and communicate then that team deserves to lose. It sucks, but that is how it is supposed to be. You are rewarded and punished as a team. This is a team game after all.
---
I can help but you aint bronze 5 cuz the solo queue
---
Owo
---
It allows him to more easily see enemies, such as how glaz‚Äôs vision just makes it easier to see people.
---
I can understand it being frustrating if you are starting out but it will get less bothersome
---
Fuze: okay
---
Ying: okay
---
Fuze + Ying: the hostage never saw it coming...
---
Too late oof
---
show them the money
---
silver limbo? it it where you are depending on your teammates but they are shit?
---
It‚Äôs alt account better saying than smurfing its account I use for duo or solo q
---
Dont you wanna attach a vid though?
---
But sadly only Fortnite has done this. God I hate how they done this but Rainbow hasn‚Äôt
---
This isn‚Äôt accurate at all! He isn‚Äôt carrying nearly enough people.
---
It was a gif of him mouse turning
---
Shhh! Stop sharing this! People will catch on... then what!
---
No shit yeah
---
A screenshot is NOT proof in that case ...
---
Here's an idea I had, let's say you wanted to buy a couple cosmetics, but you don't know how they look together
---
You should be able to preview how a headgear looks like with an uniform before you buy them, maybe add them so you can like, make a shopping list of stuff you want, for example, one headgear, one uniform, and a gun skin and preview how they'd look like before you buy them
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm bad at explaining myself, but hopefully that made sense
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I got a plan for carrying an actual full team of Defenders
---
Guys I‚Äôm sooo confused why is valk disarming the bomb lol

F2 is still one of the best guns

Really

Is it covering your head?

She submitted to the lords presence
---
Good game
---
I hate people who smurf. I don't really have to deal with it in ranked all that much but Unranked and Quick Match are infested
---
How much ping you used to get before South African Servers were introduced?
---
I want this so bad, sucks that I cannot see how a combo looks before buying.
---
I don't think they ever mentioned about the Middle Eastern Servers. I maybe be wrong but I'm 99% sure. They only talked about the African Servers only.
---
Could share the source?
---
I don‚Äôt even care too much to be real. Mostly I can‚Äôt even tell. But I saw this idiot bragging about it and had to smash him! Lol!
---
is it connecting you to the correct data center?
---
Yeah of course, I will check and send you it. I remember them saying that Microsoft has released servers in both Africa and the Middle East and since ubisoft's servers are based on Microsoft's, they will utilize those servers
---
Yes it is, WEU.
---
Actually yes, but the first one was deleted for some reason (i think, because i got a message from Reddit saying it was deleted so.)
---
Fucking smurfs

Good thing that dude couldn‚Äôt aim
---
Played that montagne.
---
very odd the. is the high latency consistent or does it spike? might be an active download on a device somewhere on your wifi

Same here! Hi there :)
---
This also happens when Dokkebi calls the defenders and if anybody pulls their phone out to disable it.
---
I‚Äôd like to see him do it with bosg
---
What platform?
---
defuse*
---
Tell me your rank and level right know because any normal functioning human being knows that the full auto f2, an insanely good weapon, is better than the semi auto shit joke of a gun the 417 is.
---
Its Consistent. I checked everything, I'm home alone and noThiNG is downloading

PC
---
On pc!!
---
pc?
---
yes
---
I play mnk on pc
---
Is it cross platform yet? Lol 
---
Ps4 here, nvm.

Use black ice lol. Best weapon skin in the game and even if you don't like it as much, it's still a heck of a flex.
---
Add GUCCICAF3.MOUR if youre up

Down to personal opinion. I have both black ice and Lovelace but use Lovelace because i personally find it to be the better looking skin and black ice is overrated imo

If my aim is that bad in t hunt i wouldnt play at all
---
used to play on neu servers with  160-200 ping which was terrible, I could constantly get killed behind cover. Was still somewhat playable , most often I needed to dump a full mag on an enemey before the servers register it as a hit.
---
Nah its a good looking skin so its no universal. Ubi only makes shit and boring skins universal.
---
Ah, yes. R6 mobile
---
toxic much?
---
Poor Monty missed a real easy opportunity before the wall got up then, for that rank
---
You know oddly enough I didn‚Äôt know if it was a new release or perhaps a different sub title of the same name. In a crazy scheme to turn a profit maybe UbiSoft has different games under the Rainbow 6 title.
---
Thanks for adding value.
---
I think you‚Äôre on to something. But spawn peaking is only banned in pro league.
---
I've only been on console for about a days thus the terrible aim but I know enough that a headshot is an insta kill and after I died it showed that the frost was still at 100hp and ik for a fact that atleast one of those shots hit
---
Aaaah shit could have sworn it said Ps4 in the title. There‚Äôs always one of you in these posts huh
---
I‚Äôm a plat 3 NA support main if this helps

No it didn't, and it's kinda clear to see that you missed every single one of them

No you didnt Hit a single Shot...

Hopefully it dies.

You just missed her hitbox bro, sadly.

Naw, sounds like it has been done before. I just can‚Äôt remember where. Hahahaha
---
The "expired" thing is just a bug, if you restart the game it will show that the packs will be available for 19 days
---
It's game limitations, been said a million times. If they could they would. 
---
I just use prismas in pre fire spots and choke points. people rarely fall for them.
---
stfu noob kid
---
Good idea. Because Siege is becoming more a place for milking players, than a game.
---
Packs were available for few minutes If you was fast you could open and get it
---
any black ice is good black ice but the only gun I have it for is 417.
---
I would kill for a black ice.
---
My friend usually forces me too
---
Search the subreddit first then you might find out.
---
MP5KSD OR P90. I would like the 416 carbine but that would be a bit op.
---
eh, clash's pickrate is quite low. wont affect many people.
---
tbh thermite isnt even that annoying
---
I got a skin for alabi's mx4 no idea how I think theres mew packs coming out soon
---
Saw Macie Jay do this before but fuck me is actually pulling it off impressive.

like ask ubi to not allow players changing servers
---
Initial building breach is always a good time, after that I usually base it on callouts
---
even after the imbalance, she needs to hold up her arm to see the screen, and it takes two hands to hold the primary, so it just doesn't make sense.

Alright but how much iq do I have if I pregire a caveira with a thermite charge
---
And MP7, M249 SAW, and a plethora of other weapons
---
I agree. I know it doesn't really make sense, but I want it.
---
I don't understand still kinda new to the game been on for a while how could twitch help with the wall breach
---
Bur Glaz wouldn‚Äôt be. Glaz was the worst operator in the game if you removed the yellow and can only see through smokes. That‚Äôs what happened after his rework. 
---
They upped his yellow glow and now he‚Äôs a really good operator. The glow really helps in target acquisition so this would certainly be a big buff for warden and puts him in a perfect spot overall I‚Äôd say
---
I whole-heartedly agree with this, like if your not gonna make my holograms look like the skin I have on then they should just stop releasing skins for her
---
Sad stuff
---
To be honest I like to play Lion when I feel like enemies rely too much on sound.

---
Atleast he has event cosmetics .Zofia or Nomad haven‚Äôt even got one yet
---
I will talk to my producers. I got you fam
---
that's great
---
you should stick with siege and make the core original vision greater. 
---
i always see people talk about tired tropes and i've followed some niche brands over the years. 
---
I don't believe that it's ok to just say, people come and go, everyone's need must be catered to, so we compromise and  do what's best for everyone---see there is no such thing as "best for everyone", if it is better for someone it's worse for someone else. 
---
In terms of getting more operators or less, that's also a tired trope. Or whether overlaps and stuff are bond to happen or not. The focus and vision should completely step out of these debates and considerations if you are truly talking next level.
---
on the other hand, I know you aren't exactly going to make siege the next mmorpg like bgne2, nor  for honor.
---

Can you buy them with renown?
---
No, it isn't. Just make it so you both get 0 timers, and remove the extra 7 seconds or so from the base defuse timer.
---
This results in the exact same balance and amount of time to do everything as it is right now, except it's consistent for everyone.

Neither of these ops are for rushing. And if you don‚Äôt think Wamai is for you, then didn‚Äôt you answer your own question?

You're the one placing so much importance on meta and insinuating that it is or should be the primary focus of DLC, so I'm asking you.

Alrighty thanks
---
Bad players just sit somewhere and don't make plays you'd expect a higher level player to make.
---
In soccer for example, a player who has played competitively their whole life is going to be better than someone who's just played recreationally. But then when the good player is trying to get the ball past the bad player, the bad player doesn't react the same way another good player would, and likely just ends up standing there instead of falling for a fake. Now the good player is caught off guard and has to come up with something else, despite there being a clear skill gap.
---
This is a pretty big thing in Rocket League as the game is played completely differently at different ranks.
---
I probably explained this badly, but I think there's a name for this type of skill discrepancy.
---
Release the pictures.
---
this is amazing, but why
---
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a mute button. I mute everyone at the start of the match. The only time I don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs a friend I‚Äôm playing with.
---
Honestly, I dont know how it breaks his shield, I guess its the little arrows on the side that collides with it?

I was playing casual one day on defence and a Rook managed to perfectly spell out FUCK on a soft wall with the butt of his gun on Coastline during prep phase. Don't think he had time for OFF.

I'm not proud of if, but in the first match I ever played, I was the last defender standing (Pulse) with the defuser planted. I kept trying to melee it because I had seen YouTube videos of people "hitting" it and I was panicking too much to think clearly. I (deservedly) got flamed pretty hard for that.

I love how people keep finding new ways to trick people . It‚Äôs like there is always something to learn with this game

I mant to say at the very beggining of the video lol from 0:04
---
Rip
---
Yes?
---
Damn these are so fly.
---
welp ive sent one and am on rn :)
---
In a new post?
---
Dude this is really fucking good strategy
---
I got a villain vibe from Kali that ubi put out when shifting tides released, the stuf she said on the phone gave me that vibe
---
I think more people would see it that way.
---
 IIRC, it was due to having the smacking animation move the model around so you could dodge bullets making it kinda difficult to get a headshot. The new animation keeps the model fixed so you're more vulnerable while defusing. At least that's what I remember.
---
Was the other team in Narnia? Why did it take them so long to get there?
---
Thanks man I appreciate it
---
They're not new it's a bug. You can see it says r&amp;d that stands for research and development
---
U right but I just took a pic in the gear of the moment. It was the end of the game that I joined.
---
I really thought the one tap was gonna be on your teammate at the beginning.
---
If i know my facts right there are slimmer filters
---
Is it too much trying to reach gold2/gold1? Or should I try to improve my game instead of just trying to get MMR?
---
Now try to spell you fucking casual üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I got the pdw skin :(

inv me ya

I got in a game with yumi and pulse mode but it is as 2 pictures so here is the second one.
---
And people say video games can‚Äôt be art
---
I‚Äôve been using him in ranked. Low plat. And he is definitely better than where he was. Gotten many 3 pieces and a couple 4ks. No ace in ranked yet. 2 in casual. Giving him his banana vision back added with the increase in fire rate should bring him back to reasonable state. Not too op but not unusable.
---
Oof
---
Just think his helmet looks silly.
---
WE ALREADY KNOW
---
It doesn't work because impeachment doesn't equal a vote to kick. The meme says he has been removed, but it won't end up that way
---
I got to keep it btw and it says nighthaven something
---
and another

ah i remember the same thing happened to me years ago lol
---
Wait, there are people who care about the lore of R6?

Same, but this cartoon make her even further.

Siege has always been a shounen anime, we just never realized it till now.

MMR will improve with skill. Queue with 5 stacks if you want to rank up more consistently. I didn't hit Gold till my 3rd season playing, and I'm fine with that. It's whatever you want man
---
It's possible that you didn't claim the award
---
I got the jackal uniform
---
She detects the device the defenders use to defuse the defuser
---
if you think your map knowledge and aim is ok/better than silver, then sure you can try. just remember solo q'ing is harder in this game, much easier with a 5 stack
---
Do you get one for free? or do you have to buy them all?
---
Get the fuck off Reddit, instagram normie.
---
All good and nice, but you should really aim for the head. Maybe full mag spray at body works against bots, but in real world you will never get above bronze with that aim.
---
This is what pisses me off. People on console get very lucky because they aim in and shoot and it‚Äôs already on my head.
---
Upvote for pure randomness

Hello SkepticalCy, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ecy7v0/you_can_buy_cosmetic_packs_with_renown_now/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What is this from?
---
Yeah but since her prismas don't not change with her uniform it's a terrible idea to use this skin
---
Operation health
---
I was yelling at him to move
---
Found it on the rainbow six instagram
---
Thats a Macie Jay strat aint original
---
Next time can you put the full game please ?
---
Bigotry detected?
---
Because it's not a model, it's an image.  The Alibi prism uses an image that changes states depending on what direction you look at it from.  This means that for every variant you would need a new set of images let alone every possible uniform combination, weapon skin and combination of weapon mods.  This is where the "data limitations" come in, it's "possible" to apply but it would take tons of time that could be put into better things.  
---
I predict in the future that if Alibi ever gets an elite skin it will come with a new prism model since the elite skin will be forced to use a practical uniform, that is if the prism model isn't already baked in or hard coded in some way.
---
It simply didn't exist back then, and no-one I ever played with claimed that.  That's back when games made you shoot ahead of your enemy instead of all this magic they pull to make the game seem in sync for everyone.  
---
No-one ever claimed that, and I played all those old games.
---
theres not supposed to be a christmas event this year
---
Oh snap. I'm excited
---
Apparently I had already upvotes him
---
Had the same thing while searching for unranked
---
Cav is a talented young lady
---
You sarcastically said "good luck getting higher" and then tried to coach him up. On a reddit thread in which he posted a play his friend made.
---
I‚Äôd be surprised if they did Israeli Commandos. They make sense for the game but the topic is very controversial and would bring heat to Ubi
---
Well at least your main isn't gonna get banned by your own team
---
Yes but the difference between Glaz and Warden is Warden is a lot closer to enemies than Glaz is. It's a lot easier to identify a big moving target than it is a small non moving one, which is why Glazs glow is in a different situation, so that he can snipe from far away without needing to squint. What I think needs to happen is he needs a better weapon in place of his SMG. Every other op designed against grenades (not many) has a powerful gun. Jager has the 416-C and Wamai has the AUG-A2. Why would you choose Warden when you can just use those 2?
---
Doesn't justify you killing him tho. Dunno how voice chat works on console but what if he muted himself? Cause he doesn't wanna go against tryhards like this in casual? Not only did you do that but you're trying to justify it now...
---
Generally, no.
---
Playing bomb there are a few things to keep in mind. 
---
One: don't reinforce between bombs - that should be self explanatory. You want to have multiple paths between so you don't get funneled.
---
Two: create exit and entry points that can be used as flanking routes - you don't ever want to be trapped in the objective rooms, and the default exits are easy to cover. Creating a entry/exit point at the stairs allows for way more movement, and an easier retake if need be.
---
The stair walls fall into the second thing.
---
Eye snacc.
---
Ah u got me xD
---
Solid loadout, but his gadget seems lackluster after the rework/nerf.
---
Thank you I feel honored.
---
What type of stuff is in the packs?
---
Wow another totally original post that couldn‚Äôt be solved by just restarting the queue after 2 minutes
---
Oh shit, this might just be the perfect Jager headgear. I hope I get it, and I don't even play Jager.

People using mouse and keyboard on there and majority of the team mates iv had have no clue what they are doing and teamkilling happens more for picking someones main which i think is just down to not enough communication because  they sit in partys rather than game chat. Its personal prefference really but i just think pc has it better than console. Oh and just having to aim to lean its only a small thing but if pc can have it why cant console
---
Could‚Äôve just gone down the hatch in construction instead of taking stairs down.
---
Now if only they applied to the holograms.
---
It's an old start from Macie Jay
---
Hot
---
What makes it so easy on console?
---
Omg that‚Äôs so true, god dang it
---
such a damn shame that I'll never equip an Alibi skin as a serious player. :( I wish her Prismas could copy operator loadout. It's impractical and difficult to put in the game but still...
---
No u
---
Mine disappeared before I was able to open
---
No her
---
Nothing. Just luck. Doesn‚Äôt happen often but when it does, it makes me angry
---
Shit you right
---
I‚Äôm in college but I know my former high school doesn‚Äôt get out until Monday. Sucks to suck
---
Wow that's sick but I dont remember asking
---
Thanks a ton bro. Solved the issue
---
Thanks mate
---
yeah holy shit and they wonder why girls don't fucking touch the gamer community. This is gross tbh
---
Where tf is capitao
---
I commend you soldier for your sacrifice but I could not tell you lmao I would guess maybe midnight or twelve hours after maybe?
---
I got one, it gave me the mp5k skin
---
Get one free then you have to buy the rest lol
---
I just got mine too, got super downvoted, idk why people dont like these!!!
---
You‚Äôre right you didn‚Äôt ask me anything. I‚Äôve just seen people post their queue times looking for karma a million times
---
hmm, this post makes me skeptical for some reason
---
Oh I gotcha. Yeah it always sucks being on the receiving end of those.
---
Holy shit you're the most annoying person I've ever seen. Have a terrible day.
---
Vigil? His backstory is tragic
---
See it more seinen
---
Yeah that's sick but I dont remember asking you about that either
---
Ok Boomer
---
Look at where the reticle is when you shoot
---
Currently unless you‚Äôre using plain everything all her holos are is just things to avoid whilst shooting. If they made them match her then she could be used more like she was intended. I don‚Äôt mind having to use a stripped down gun without a sight but not being able to use skins is annoying.
---
I didn‚Äôt get one
---
You can see blood
---
Wamai pulled a Captain America.
---
that's a bummer , i really wanted to upgrade it 
---
idk why steam/uplay doesn't let us upgrade
---
Do you know what separates an artist from a sniper?
---
Yeah, but I draw the line on attempted murder of friends who are holding back on you.
---
You hit em, just wasn't a hs
---
Lord forgive me for what I‚Äôm about to do
---
I hope they stop with the fictional CTUs
---
Well put, agree with all these points
---
Yeah, personally, I really dislike the direction Ubi has taken their character design with this whole Nighthaven bull, like, we haven't even covered all major military nations, like Israel, or Egypt, or the Gurkhas, but we're already moving onto imaginary, nationless PMC's from 50 years into the future, to me, it feels out of touch with R6 original creative design.
---
Also, if this PMC has all this fancy futuristic gear and tech, why can't they design their OWN GUNS, instead of copypasting everything but Kali's sniper.
---
He hit it head first....wamai is F
---
Mine won‚Äôt let me open the pack

I've been playing for sinse black noise (vidgel and dokabi) and I'm still way to scared to touch ranked

Same. I think that in our class everyone needs a holiday (vocational school to be exact)

I think it's all about what time of day you post. If you watch the community to see when the most people are online (usually between 7 and 12 thousand users i think depending on the day) and post during peak times I bet you'll see more upvotes.
---
Gonna cry?

Nah for real though reposting is Reddit's nature you can't be surprised anymore at this point.

Ela likes traps? Well shit

Call teh police!

No.

Yes

That doesn't really look like any of Siege's operators so it's hard to get the joke

Also the unreinforced hatch that is not broken open.

It‚Äôs Glaz‚Äôs bio that says that.  Buck mentioned that while testing Glaz‚Äôs rifle and scope.

Give people more renown for joining mid game, instead of giving less.
---
So true
---
I know, but they're expensive, I only had 30k on me and spent in on 2 packs, still need 200k to get them all. It's one hell of a grind.

Hey man wamai is cool. But I do agree with Kali.

It's pretty much the same ambience and shit.

‚ÄúNoob‚Äù really shouldn‚Äôt be getting to you. I‚Äôve seen worst, but if it‚Äôs making you almost quit, just mute / block them and don‚Äôt acknowledge their existence. If you actually talk to them, you‚Äôre just going to get more wound up.
---
Hell no

Wamai design is a creative director literally shrugging his shoulders and going make a black version of jaeger I guess. Oh and he's a mutant with yellow eyes that can breathe under water for his lore.

lol and because he‚Äôs op

Yeah maybe you right.
---
People still get tricked by the holograms. Most people shoot without checking rhe cosmetics.

Please speak english. Thanks

This is just useless. This has no benefit. This could also come as a nerf to him too.
---
No , try to learn callouts maybe
---
Bad decision

I got it but cant use it :(

I didn‚Äôt even get the pack

I‚Äôve opened it and got P90 skin lol.

Villa is a bad map?

I am speaking English, it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt understand my joke.

The Assassin‚Äôs Creed devs must be working on siege rn

Y3S3 charm? That looks like it was from last year
---
So you‚Äôre saying that whenever a new version of unity is created to suit the game it is made for (eg. escape from tarkov, cities skylines or ksp) it is no longer unity but instead an entirely different engine? If you homebrew a software, it‚Äôs still that software, even if it is not the same exact code as the software you downloaded 2 weeks prior. Also even if you argue that titanfall 2 changes the engine too much to be a viable comparison, it still only took them 25 months to develop the whole game, which most of that time probably didn‚Äôt go into the engine, so an overhaul of that scale in this case is not out of the question. Also by that logic csgo wouldn‚Äôt be running on the source engine which is completely untrue.
---
I would say every Y1 atacker is good
---
It‚Äôs dated for today tho.
---
Buck on the bottom left. Killin it.
---
gridlock. out of the ones you dont have she is the best
---
There‚Äôs gift cards.

Christmas is coming, ask that to your parents, not on Reddit.
---
gridlock/wamai/and kali I guess
---
honestly the rest I could go without ever buying them. nokk, amaru, clash, warden, goyo, they're not all useless they're just situational and not that fun
---
My parents said they wouldn‚Äôt buy me anything video game related for Christmas...
---
wamai

Then there‚Äôs nothing to do about it, don‚Äôt go on Reddit to ask a stranger to give you a game.

how many people do not fucking understand that the holograms rely on attacker reflexes and muscle memory. they are there for attackers to flick onto because they will shoot at anything that looks like a defender most of the time. if you are trying to pretend you are hologram then you are playing her entirely wrong

Well that was a quick event.

ubi plz, i am tired of playing Alibi and meanwhile she gets skins, the holo dont...
---
You can still buy the game right now, the only thing stopping you is your temporary annoyance. And after playing it on PC for a while you'll buy those cosmetics again because you want them. This is the highest probability outcome for most consumers of the game looking to go multi platform and it will make Ubisoft more money. Which is why I referred you to my first comment because we're going to keep looping back to that answer
---
??? People constantly talk shit about how the comsetics are trash in this game. You must be on a different subreddit.
