You aren't gonna get shot just because your fake gun doesn't have an orange tip, I was actually running around in full airsoft gear and the police just stopped me to say that I looked cool wearing it.
---
And while the last part is probably debatable, the fact that you aren't going to get shot in most "western" countries that aren't the US isn't, civilians simply don't have access to that kind of weapon anyway.
---
It's almost like being the country nearest to the country you're fighting means that you'll see more devestation than a country on an entire other land mass. Who would've guessed? Also you've said that successfully was the wrong word but nothing else you said was right either. When was France conquered? Besides land they lost on their Eastern border the vast majority of the country remained under the control of the French Republic. Also just because a country wouldn't have won a war against a far more industrialised and populated country without the help of its allied doesn't deter from the fact they still won. Britain couldn't have won ww1 without France. Britain certainly couldn't have won the napoleonic wars without aid from Prussia, Russia and Austria.  America wouldn't have won ww2 without soviet help. I feel like you're saying so much stuff in the context of France and not realising how literally every other country goes through similar stuff. The soviet Union was far more heavily affected in ww2 than France was in ww1 and yet both remained independant and won the war and yet u don't mention Russias tendency to surrender? Even when Russia did actually lose ww1.
---
Lol. Everybody else. There are plenty of people here that think it‚Äôs funny. Mostly because it is. It‚Äôs kind of ironic too. Spend all that money on a gun only to paint it like a lego.
---
I meant the more nsfw subs, i'm sure someone has drawn something with a machine gun
---
You spelled acog wrong.
---
What did they say?
---
pro tip. aim and it looks more like an alibi
---
It's not a ping issue, dude was fully on the screen just really hard to see through the fire.  Y'all are completely missing the point of the post.
---
Frost with an ACOG lmao.
---
I am already thinking about how busted that would be.
---
Remember when Basketball was good, and you could actually defend, allowing players like Shaq to get really high up on the ladder. Nowadays you have overrated little 5'4 players like Curry who are able to run layups because agressive defense is a FOUL now. OH no please don't foul me, I'm steph curry and my body is frail. Basketball kinda sucks now.
---
The idea Frances war record would be skewed because of aid from the allies is such a dumb claim too. I don't know if you realised but every major war usually is heavily centered on alliances. Why is Britain or Russias military record not also skewed?
---
the post is literally about how he is fully visible behind the fire, yet most commenters speak about peeker's advantage.
---
for shame
---
Lol busted is an understatement.
---
Why not?
---
Same objectives, same day, two matches, two seasons ago.
---

I agree. House was too much fun, it's coming back soon though
---
I too anialate
---
I'll add you. But solo is not easy. You must have gotten lucky every time. Most of the time I solo queue, my team either doesn't talk, doesn't know how to play the game, or can't aim. And I mean that's fine, gotta play the game to get better, but still. Lose most of those games.

It's 100% against the rules. It's against the terms of service to use any kind of third party service to give you an advantage. Using a mouse and keyboard on console REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY DEVICE.

You're wrong, it also doesn't specifically say that I can't use aimbot, does that mean I can? It falls under the blanket rule of using a third party service to give yourself an advantage.

At the very least I can flex my FMG black ice on her. God knows I don‚Äôt run that shit on smoke. I would happily change Warden and N√∏kk‚Äôs guns and I think Ubi knows reusing shit guns won‚Äôt go well. Contrary to everyone I actually don‚Äôt mind reused guns as long as they‚Äôre good/fun to use. I really like Goyo and Amaru‚Äôs weapon‚Äôs, so that gives me hope for S4.
---
It could be a smurf or he has friends that are good
---
He could just be a smurf
---
No. Casual is where most of the new players hang out. Siege already has a steep learning curve so shortening the round would make it even harder for them.

Stay with shotgun

Process of elimination, yeah? I‚Äôd have let that other smoke nade go.
---
Or reposting for a broader audience so that Ubisoft is more likely to make rushing less counterable, but that‚Äôs just what I say to try and justify my evil ways
---
Imagine how useless warden would be without his glasses... or mustache.
---
Aww shucks , well I hope you get more plays like this to bring more laughs to the siege community
---
play with friends, or pay people to act like your friends and play with them

if he was a cheater he probably wouldnt have a .7 kd

---
Your setup puts my cable-crazed PC to shame
---
Based off flair alone, you‚Äôre who I want to play with... as long as you got a second fav defence op lol. Yes tho, Mira seems like a dope person based off the bio and lore
---
First theres a difference between experiencing it and watch it on YouTube.
---
Second everyone had to go against "pros" when they experienced these on release so you dont really have a point there. I joined at the height of ela being bullshit and had to experience that and I still wasn't near as good when lion came out as I am now. And yet still matchmaking on casual sucks dick and it still happens to people meaning that the "pros" get to shit on them with other things as well. Basically that entire point was useless cause this is siege which is a ubisoft game which just like others before and after it have terrible match making cause I play for honor now almost as much as I play siege and get paired against people 5 times my rep all the time
---
Third there arent many "pros" as you say in siege cause being a pro and being a diamond/champion are 2 different things. Even average pros can stomp your average diamond into the ground. And most the game consists of high silvers and low golds which amounted with the number of average diamonds and plats there are means you'll almost never be paired with someone who's a pro player for tournaments especially considering that 1. Before they mostly played ranked when they played casually 2. Now that unranked is out they have less of a reason to play casual matches and 3. If they do play the even they will probably only play it a couple of times just to reminisce about some of it then go back to prepping for their next match. 
---
Forth newer can refer from anyone who started at the same time as me or someone who started playing last week. Newer just means they haven't seen the original version in this context.
---
Lastly if you think any of what you've offered as points are actual points against this you're ether very low ranked or basically brand new to the game having only played for a couple of season and have no clue what you're arguing about.
---

Are you threatening me, master Jedi?

My argument is that the roni is much better do to it's firerate being nearly the vector. The having a fast firerate means more of a chance to get a headshot when spraying. More dps. Less ttk. It's better.

It mostly works when you get a few kills then hide in your hologram.

And how exactly do you think that happens?

Yeah.

But op thinks so. As do LMG ACOGs. No clue why. His reasoning is pretty shite.

Congrats on your first ace. Always a nice thing.

Those exist?

Like the way he described it makes it seem like he's getting sprayed at a door and thinks "Is this a good time to peak?"
---
Im level 111 so its kinda sad i only got it today
---
He can't let go of his past.
---
How does it work more like a stab than a slice?  Slicing is more lethal to special ops as their armor is thick enough to deflect a stabbing motion but thinner parts are easily sliced.
---
Didn't this meme die like three years ago
---
If I was a slice people wouldn't miss it because they are an inch off target

---
Oh ok
---
Wow the shield animation
---
Should‚Äôve made him kill himself
---
Ew that was disgusting
---
I think the claymore was behind the monty. So only when monty closed his shield did it go off and kill all of them. (One defender started defusing, and so someone must‚Äôve given the call to monty to allow the defenders to set off the claymore behind him)
---
Now of to school
---
Shhh, don‚Äôt tell everyone
---
I'm gonna say it's very strong when compared to other shotguns but here's the thing , she still has to use a shotgun, most attackers are going to have the advantage at long range

You dont have to hyperlink it, you can just post the link and it does the exact same thing. What you did was redundant
---
Claymore ace
---
Damn boy that's 5 uninstalls for the day
---
I play on 180ms ping and cant do shot about it so believe me I know more about how ping can fuck up your ability to play a competitive shooter than most. Have a whole library of moments where I should have absolutely got a kill but didnt because of my ping. And that sucks, but I have to live with that, or move to Europe.
---
But this, buddy. This should not be how things work. This shouldve been a trade. The game shouldn't receive the data that on person lands a headshot and instantly deem any damage the person does invalid because they have died. There should be a certain threshold to the activity someone does where being killed wont cancel the damage you do. Yeah I know, ping abusers might find a way to exploit this, but I'm sure if you fire a shot, and the bullet leaves your barrel, and maybe even another shot is fired, that that should still register, because even if a bullet flies through my skull as I shoot another player in the skull, my bullet shouldn't suddenly exit existence because I died
---
If you leave a match you get an abandon penalty, but it doesn't count as a loss.
---
That's where lag compensation and tickrate kicks in. Some sources say siege has 64hz tickrate, so the minimal window for both shots to be registered should be least 15.6ms, making second scenario improbable.  
---
But then comes lag compensation. In the scenarios i've described you would have to shoot not where you see the enemy, but where the server sees him, resulting in having to shoot massively ahead of targets if you have poor ping. And they can't trust clients to send if they hit or not, because that's just a straight up invitation for cheaters. So, what they do instead is keep short history of game states, and, on every hit, kinda rewind the time back and check whether the shooter could really hit his target at that moment from his perspective. That puts frost from second scenario at a severe disadvantage, because she doesn't even know, that at a moment she saw the shooter, she has technically already been killed half a second ago.
---
It can be a problem tho.....competitive shooters dont work when things out of your control get you killed and lose you games
---
It'll probably have to leave pro league first then only ranked 
---
Personally it's one of my favourite maps and it's not that bad if you drone out and play with some friends
---
[removed]
---
yeah that's what hes talking about, new perspectives are fucked
---
I think it was widespread long before that but it‚Äôll likely breathe a little life back into ir
---
this just make me really sad because i dont have 2 screens
---
The thing you're looking for is SAM. Salty Ash Main.
---
Nah, default works well for me
---
I'm pretty sure ping abusing isnt a thing anymore. If you have high ping, the server dictates what happens, so if you're lagging and you shoot someone, the server doesnt get the info fast enough or reliably enough and it just wont connect and you'll die. Even just 180ms can be brutal to play on
---
Damn you didn't have to do him like that
---
Eww the teabag
---
Good map. Bad player
---
But the other country below straya. But that's ok you can have your milo, just know that we invented Pavlova

Red door ganger here: every gun on defense with no acog except vector, mp7, aug a3, mp5k I use red dot on. On attack there are a few more guns I use red dot on
---
This... this is good...
---
Nice job
---
Oh ok I tried finding the video I saw a few months ago and I cant but it was a huge issue then and is now a huge issue again
---
I'm gonna need a link for this plz
---
Why didn‚Äôt you make a BOSG with an ACOG?
---
what in the fuck
---
plus you were leaning to left not right. so he could see a part of your body beforet
---
 you could see him. Also dont wide peek like that 9/10 you would lose a gun fight :p
---
He‚Äôs probably a DDOSer.
---
When you down someone you automatically get the reverse friendly fire so you take damage, and the smoke killing the rook kills smoke too because of it. Same thing happened a while ago with goyo‚Äôs shield. People would instantly die when reinforcing something because group would place his shield down next to a reinforcement and it would break once reinforced. A player would stand in the fire and get downed, activating the reverse friendly fire, then the player who reinforced would die because the person would still be in the fire.
---
Sucks that one of them was *your teammate*
---
What
---
They had 2 nitros and potentially a couple impacts. How was their only plan everyone punch the front of his shield at once?  Also where‚Äôs the rest of your team?
---
Yea I was confused. At first I didn't even know what happened and I still was trying to go for a flank then it was like oh. We won. Waht
---
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt quite understand. What other islands?
---
Yea. Like right behind him
---
Yo I got the same thing!

We don't talk about that. We only talk about how it was a 6k. Not who

Have you ever shot a M16/M4/AR-15? I would assume it feels similar seeing as they are both DI guns, but how does the recoil compare?

Not quite below Australia, but that‚Äôs ok Pavlova is manky. Go shag your sheep

the monty is the real hero here

To tap or not to tap, that is the question

Really good for new players, because he is able to help the team without actively following them. His guns are also very good and easy to control
---
Psssst hey, you want some broken pay to win MTX in your 60$ game? Well then, this game is for you.
---
Both, you are simply brilliant
---
I'm probs quitting rainbow soon they are still adding more monitizatinons worse pro league is 5 bucks more a battle pass and now u can't share them.

they are designed to be fraggers

And US, it's only required for sale as far as I know.

If i'm by myself I prefer pc but the boys come way before the platform we play on.
---
Exactly, shitcunt New Zealand
---
I already imagine 5 recruits with R4C on attack and 416 on defense. No, thanks! I don't want this game to completely become run n gun sh*t like COD
---
whats in there is it the siege bible
---
You would have to 3d print a new model with the can attached.

Bruh moment
---
Nomad will be useful in more situations than Kaid
---
I know it sounds silly but it is more important than most think. For example I run my decontamination uniform on Buck when I‚Äôm in cas but since it‚Äôs a bright yellow I switch it out during ranked. It can make a slight tactical difference, and should be added.
---

It could possibly be a form of dyslexia, it's common for people to mix their "p's" and "b's" all the time.

Jesus Christ dude go back to tarkov if this game is too ‚Äúunreal‚Äù for you. News flash every game is unrealistic, you just like to use realism as a scapegoat for simply not liking an aesthetic
---
i kind of figured

I would call that a progress and an accomplished mission because i got 0.0001 to do that with our computers School

20 meters in Siege is a lot. If you remember the average kill distance is only about 10 meters.

Sir, it's a game based on experience, Ubisoft will not make HK police get more point for that, they are soldier from a game, nothing else.

I AGREE FUCK BRAD MARCHAND AND GO CANUCKS/CBJ
---
But did you lick the stamp?
---
none of the operators make any sense and neither do the elite uniforms make no sense either, Nokk doesn't make no sense but ubi put her in the game to fit the lore, Krueger in COD makes sense because a game like that he fits.

Imagine him doing a slav squat with his turret. That would be epic.

Usually with my luck it bounces off the window sill comes back and hits me. I was pleasantly surprised.

That is amazing
---
The other night while playing unranked I kept getting paired with a troll. Had to report him every game.  You would think at some point it wouldn't pair you with someone, but nope, three reports and was still in my games.  Went to playing casual because of it. And here I was thinking unranked was less toxic.
---
I love it! Not too flashy, its a little more realistic with the partial ice and not full ice
---
You know how the Capcha checkbox program uses AI and millions of samples of humans vs computers clicking a box to determine if you're a bot? AIs, given massive data sets, can notice things we can't. "Perfectly translated" is not true, it's impossible actually because the difference is in the way humans play.
---
This is gonna sound douchey, but you're a little behind on AI's capabilities (and strengths) if you think this is far from possible. 
---
Also, the new CoD sorts people based on peripheral. Also also, the m+kbs the manufacturers sell are specifically disabled on console. Also also also... I have a hunch you use a xim4 and are trying to justify it by saying it's inevitable anyways

what if the developers do it? we have swamp bitch

Hey guys, thanks for all the upvotes, I think that's my first post ever to have so many, I'm kinda proud haha
---
And thanks for all the suggestions as to how to improve this trick, I'll be certain to try it more often now.
---
I've actually tried many times before and it never worked, I ended up just setting Alibi to use her as a regular roamer, when I did it  on this video it wasn't actually even planned, the idea just came on that moment and somehow it worked lol
---
Funny, doesn't the game have a PEGI/ESRB/FSK/whatever rating of 18+? Not that anyone would care nowadays, including the parents of what sometimes feels like 10 year olds in voice chat
---
give my best to mr. chavez! 
---
a small group of us still play the original rainbow six games.
---
Big brain time
---
I don't have the og games tho. 
---
Would you like a souvenir from the plane?
---
One of the only reasons that Ash can do what she does is because she has such a small frame, it has nothing to do with her weapon. Recruit is a bit chunkier so that will negate the "Ash has no hitbox". You can already play 5 recruits with the R4C, and you can already play 5 recruits with the 416.
---
The weapons themselves are not godlike or OP in any way. I respect your opinion but I fail to see the logic behind it. I also think this falls under the "Fascist who wants everyone else to adapt to his way of playing".
---
IF 5 recruits rush in go trap operators or simply be prepared. A single well placed anchor who is alert can easily gun down ATLEAST 2-3 of the rushers, and if the rest of your team is worth a cent they can handle the remaining 3/2.
---
The other team went quiet as. Like the occasional trash talk but then my team was like at least we all didn't die to 1 claymore
---
Makes sense

Tom Clancy had many if his books adapted into critically and financially successful films. The Hunt for Red October launched Alec Baldwin‚Äôs career. Harrison Ford made a fortune performing as Jack Ryan in a bunch of different films.

She‚Äôs former RDF for sure.

yes pls!

you can get the og games from voobly. worth it if just to plan a single mission in single player.

The Hunt for Red October is my favorite Clancy novel. Arguably his best. Give that a read.

Guys... I don‚Äôt want to alert you, but I think there‚Äôs a body hanging there. *zooms in on her face*

I ment that in the book which took place in 1999-2000 the Rainbow initiate had an advanced virtual reality training program where the soldiers spent some time between missions and they hated it because it was clanky and such. Not a single charachter from Siege is in the book. The original Six was called John Clark and he was a returning character in a few Jack Ryen books as well. His second in command was called Rainbow Five who was a british SAS officer. The Rainbow unit was station at Hereford in the 22SAS base. The book and the original Rainbow Six game came out in 1998 so Clancy didn't know that the 22SAS moved his base out from Hereford in 1999 in the real world and many people still thinks that the 22SAS is still based at Hereford. Also most of the Siege characters were kids when the story took place. The other easter egg connection between the novel and Siege&gt;! is the heatbeat sensor. The original Rainbow team had heartbeat sensors in the last mission of novel.!&lt;  
---
I don't know who rare it is, but in my country the novel only got one printed edition about 20 years ago. The Rainbow Six novel is not one of the most favourite Tom Clancy books. The Jack Ryan books are still getting new editions.

Yes, indeed. Once I was playing solo and got stuck in a 1v4 on 4-4 match point. 2 Teammates left for that reason (you could tell by their stats) and I clutched the round they still got a loss for leaving. Never felt better. :D

Ich hatte mich auch schon gewundert, warum ich die challenge nicht schaffe, obwohl ich mittlerweile mehr als 3 Runden gewonnen habe mit den beiden Operatoren. Gut zu wissen, danke! Ich wei√ü schon, warum ich lieber alles auf Englisch habe

Fill the alphabet bois with lead then tannerite for when their buddies come
---
Sometimes the challenges seem to 'hiccup' and don't count progress until some time later. It will eventually catch up to itself and count 'lost' progress.
---
Nokk isn't bad. She's light on her feet and the guns aren't as bad as people like to say as her side can be a supressed desert eagle. Jackal is a good stealth op too. You can track foot prints of enemies. But if you play ranked or unranked its not a good buy because every player below plat and high gold pretty much ban him. Mavericks gadget is pretty good. You can put torch holes in reinforced walls and if you play stealthy enough, you can flank or penetrate an objective without letting the enemy team know your position immediately. But of course, know that holes made in walls work both ways in regards to who can see who. The big idea to stealth in this game is taking into account, who can you use that's not necessary to be pushing the objective or making a lot of noise or making their presence known by using their gadget. Nokk, jackel, lion, maverick (if you're careful), twitch. IQ can be stealthy too but you just have to be careful with how close you get to objective.
---
 Nokk w smg
---
Thanks, how is his 50cal vs the m4?

Is this unranked? In ranked that champion could not queue up with the silvers to get into this game

Fun joke-ruining fact: based on the speed of light, the minimum ping for someone playing from Mars is 261333, when Mars and Earth are at their closest at 78.4 million km apart. That's about 4.5 minutes of lag, so the round would be over before you could move your drone.

YEAH DOC WHY DIDNT U REPORT THERES A GUY ON WINDOW???

No, just tried playing Apex and oof it might take some time go get use to

&gt;I started making desktop backgrounds from the operator videos

Isn't his just a screenshot?

I‚Äôd say purchase the cheapest version, and enjoy the grind.

The cheapest version is no different from the normal base game tho right?

Dude. I‚Äôm super calm. Just confused as to why you‚Äôre reeing so hard at something you have no control of lol.

What‚Äôs karma whoring ?
---
I agree with welp sound just get the normal version and enjoy the grind
---
It is, but im wondering if the mechanics in unlocking and buying new operators is no different?
---
Doc
---
It's on the outside... Most operators that counter Maestro are countered by distance or an ads, this place has neither.
---
If the enemy team has:
---
Ash
---
Zofia
---
Sledge
---
Thatcher (brought on most garage attacks)
---
Twitch
---
Glaz (frags)
---
Dokka (frags)
---
Buck (frags)
---
Finka (frags)
---
Maverick
---
Then your evil eye and life was worthless. But if you place it in better positions like under white van, then they have to make a bigger effort to deal with it, first they have to find it, then they have to open garage wall, then they have to clear any ads covering it (unless you use Twitch but this can be countered by either Mute or someone checking) after that they have to either nade, Zofia or Ash the evil eye without missing nor getting shot. Can you see the difference between a good evil eye vs a bad one?
---
Gridlock
---
So good
---
I just noticed that the Thatcher has his famous quote 
---
"Fookin Lazer sights"
---
Thanks bro!

Hello Patriotism1776, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dcc1t9/perfect_timing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah, gave them all a little something, glad it was noticed
---
In order to improve, I would suggest:
---
1. Changing your sensitivity settings. The default settings aren't necessarily the best for everyone. Play around with them until you find your groove.
---
2. Change your guns attachments to better suit your style and the gun. Not all guns need the compensator, the flash hider and muzzle brake are all useful depending on the gun and if you unload or burst fire.
---
3. Play t-hunt often and on all maps. This will give you the chance to test your settings, improve your game sense by learning how the maps are laid out (also pay attention to your compass, because it will tell you what room you're in for when you need to make call outs), and will help you improve your aim and ability to control your recoil.
---
4. Don't run unless you absolutely have to. Running will give away your position, and the transition time from running to aiming down sights will get you killed.
---
5. If you can, always aim down sights. 
---
6. Keep your aim up. Leg shots do 75% the damage your gun normally would, so you'll lose gunfights that you could have won if you hit body shots.
---
7. Listen. A lot of this game is information, and you can gain an abundance of information just by listening.
---
8. Remember that you don't need to be in the objective to protect the objective. Besides roaming, lurking in a room near objective or with a good line of sight to common approaches can provide you the ability to ambush the enemy with lost risk to yourself.
---
9. Check windows when approaching the building. There are many people who will try to spawn peek, or try to kill you as your are approaching the building. Watch for any broken barricades.
---
10. Use your drone. Your drone is invaluable, and should be treated as such. You don't need to ID the entire enemy team, just try to find the objective and put your drone in a safe place with good visibility. All attack operators have a second drone, use it to check ahead of you before you enter a room.
---
The mechanics are all the same, the more expensive ones simply come with more operators
---
Damn and that's what I call original
---
Yesterday was vigil
---
Did you really though? Sometimes the news banner thing on the main menu glitches and will show that you own the new bundles, but you don't.
---
I‚Äôve seen it before as well. Fairly positive it‚Äôs a bug.
---
You get the new ops like a week ahead of anyone else, but you can test and fiddle with new ops in the test servers anyways so the advantage is lost. There are slight bumps in renown points, but its a really small bump, same for alpha pack wheel(which is purely cosmetics). I don't see the year pass as a pay to win.
---
Is that your only rebuttal? Quoting me? Grow up or learn how to continue an argument.
---
Please make more. This is dope
---
20 hours of game time total on the game yes it‚Äôs good
---
Oh you make these! I thought it was Ubi, great work
---
Are you on console?
---
Belka did nothing wrong
---
Unless you have a high refreshrate monitor then anything above 60 is good.
---
Then why did you repost it?
---
This tickels my pickle
---
nah you're not the minority, kid's bedroom is by far the worst objective in the game
---
 I thought Day 2 is defusing the bomb
---
I wholeheartedly agree half the operaters are rehashed versions of og ones anyone( e.g warden= bad j√§ger, Lesion= Kapkan)
---
I wonder if you got team killed alot on house
---
Do more!
---
Are you telling me leather pants and high tops aren't in character for this grizzled SAS veteran!
---
Might be a bit much but maybe you could put all attacker emblems on left in the black and defenders on the right
---
put a # in front of the text
---
In total, yes. This is spooky.
---
Thank youuu
---
I don't think it's themed, but I legit just ripped a Scott the Woz Image with him holding a DS and saying What the Fuck? And I turned that into Glaz
---
Only thing I would add to your statement is warden=bad j√§ger, good stash
---
 I reset my xbox when this happens for me

I have an IRL trumpet
---
That's a nice image. Which op you buying?
---
Afk farm. Is it casual? If so hes just super lazy
---
Run valk more, it forces you to use cams and get Intel before pushing an attacker, when your playing as an attacker place your 1st drone where you'll be entering it'll help alot
---
there's no other way he could die
---
ok cool last season i was plat 3 and this season im currently kind of fucked at a silver 3... i literally got like 10 abandons  because the servers

Ok that's weird then. Usually that's the issue it's your ssd is too full but you got more than enough space
---
Damn and you had even more kills than him
---
Lmao you‚Äôre lucky, I get randomly kicked before the game starts or after getting tkd at the start of the round at least 2-3 times an hour if in playing cas
---
The fact that Twitch wasn't Giorgio Moroder and Philip Oakey  - 'Together in Electric Dreams' upsets me.
---
People didn't seem to hate on blitz as much until he became a 2 speed, I think another 2 speed shield would make people furious.
---
If you leave before you lose it doesnt register it as a loss, tryhards who think stats means skill do this to brag
---
He was playing cas dude... and never underestimate people being dickheads and kicking for no reason
---
049 has breached containment

As long as your are going above 1.0 on average than you are reducing the gap between your kills and deaths.

I think full mouse and keyboard support for console and cross play between all consoles and pc would be an amazing direction for Siege!
---
I really like the Jack Ryan series. The Hunt for Red October is a classic, The Cardinal of the Kremlin is a great stereotypical espionage story and The Sum of All Fears.  All of those were published in the mid to late 80s so are kind of dated when it comes to spy capabilities but still good reads.

Doubt, cross platform FPS games have a big problem related to fair play because it‚Äôs easier to control your player via pc than consoles

No lie i was thinking something was gonna pop out
---
Well first, my tv is about 6 ft away AND 6 ft high, from top edge to floor (minded it was mounted), and second, I have no desk, I use coffee tables for my keyboard and mouse, and the reason for that is because I have a VR headset (HTC Vive) and needed space, but I've gotten so used to it, using a monitor feels off.

The recoil isn't that bad,  you can hit someone in the chest and you'll kill them quickly because of how high the rate of fire is 
---
Twitch's gun isn't what I would call "perfectly balanced"  it's definitely on the stronger side when compared to almost any other gun
---
In what way is buying a new entire screen just to look stuff up not overkill.
---
Bring back Advanced Warfighter! That game was epic. I remember playing like the 16 player co op maps on my 360. That game felt and played great. Haven‚Äôt seen anything like it since. Let‚Äôs go!
---
What the fuck
---
!remindme 1 week
---
I've never seen dominos boxes like that or heard of those pizzas. Where is this from?
---
So did the guy ever finish his tea?
---
Ranked or casual?
---
 !remindme 1 week
---
What rank are you ?
---
Gold 2
---
Quite cool

#TOP TEN THINGS SCIENTISTS STILL CANT EXPLAIN
---
was I talking to you dipshit? No fuck outta here
---
Uwu that looks nice
---
The hostage secretly enjoys it
---
the right question
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant to say. If they wanted to do cross play now they can.
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
actually how tf did you lose against coppers when you did that well lol
---
1v1s mean dick all in this game, for one. And another thing; why are you bitching about it here instead of with your friend?
---
Video chat with my other players is my second screen. Three rulebooks open at the same time on my third.
---
She so spooky she‚Äôs scaring connections
---
Very nice
---
#S #P #O #O #P #Y
---
But why clash
---
For the amount of hours I have clocked, I‚Äôm actually bummed about being a gold 2 but watcha gunna do
---
I'm plat 1 and get hit with diamond/champion teams all the time and get absolutely trucked. It's nice, though, because playing against harder competition makes you better.
---
my teammates had no idea what they were doing
---
F
---
Yeah I meant that siege should take advanced and allow cross play lol.
---
That‚Äôs kinda sad tho.
---
Because you're a Twitch/Doc main.
---
#big boi letters
---
If you‚Äôre brave enough...
---
Why did they nerf Monty and shield fuze? I feel like they were okay, and blitz was the only one who was really broken.
---
#WITH THE TOP THING IS HOW THE HELL WAS THAT NOT A HEADSHOT?
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
Marry her
---
1v1s mean nothing, this isn't COD, the game is team oriented
---
Clash is kinda like Monty. Shit alone, but a terror when played in a team.
---
I looks worse in breakpoint
---
I kno. Mine has a add minute button. 30 seconds. Start. Add minute.
---
Wow, I didn't know that.
---
Holy shit it's the Lord xddd 
---
I'm gonna cum bruh
---
Congratulations. I‚Äôve been one win away three season in a row now without making it and finally just have up and haven‚Äôt played since the beginning of this season.
---
For this you are to be punished by death
---
That aimbot strength is too obvious
---
Seen some people win mmr when they lose, usually happens if the lobby starts as a 1v5
---
She‚Äôs **grrrrreat**
---
Good argument for why console is the superior way to play, right here
---
I was here before this got to Hot
---
Am I missing something?
---
100 STEALTH
---
What do you mean
---
But you must be around copper rank rn to be placed among all the other coopers
---
Valkyrie, if youre playing against good players Frost is mostly useless.
---
I went into silent mode and i still had my shotgun
---
Firstly it needs to get into hot i guess
---
Same
---
yup because i only won 2 matches because no one makes call outs
---
Kapkan please?
---
Microwave drone
---
u/i_wanna_fuck_maestro
---
Can you even use aim bot on Xbox??
---
Honestly on pc you probably would‚Äôve gotten one tapped as soon as you walked through breach lmao
---
Just remove his thermal scope and give him the ability to shoot through shields bam
---
Now its like i_wanna_consume_maestro
---
If I had a gold
---
I did this too but unfortunately I don‚Äôt have the desk space to line it up as well
---
Fair. It just looks like the tracking on the other shots were pretty good, and maybe missing the cam was a fluke from panic or something.
---
Me neither, he never struck me as OP at all.
---
I mean at that point who cares it‚Äôs the same result: one less player on the board and info on the remaining players
---
I'm gonna be blank with you, I can't tell if you won or not. But I'm going to take your word and say that perhaps you won with or against other players that were some how cheating and got caught in match. It's possible because I see you're on pc, also screen capture that instead of using your phone, unless you're posting on social medias then in that case, my bad.
---
Im astounded you still haven‚Äôt unlocked mira dude shes great
---
Please don‚Äôt remind me how painful it was dealing with 7 F-22s with QAAMs
---
This made me laugh
---
look for a psychologist.
---
The squad punishment was already too much
---
I have a great idea a fuse pulse hybrid operator. He gets both of their gadgets. I think it would be very balanced and not hurt the gameplay at all.
---
Keep grinding m8!
---
All praise the Finka mains!
---
I love you
---
I'll add stickers to my dbh then if you need
---
I hate you for doing this to me. THE PUNS ARE TOO REAL. XD
---
Don't get warden he is the worst operator so far
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt even do the meme kick. Just sucks when matchmaking takes a bit, only to join and get kicked as soon as the game starts
---
Think of it as training
---
Pretty beefy, huh?
---
#WHAT THE CRISPY FUCK IS GOING ON?
---
But nobody expects him so actually he's the best!
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I think the story behind it is all the matches are fake and just practice scenarios (don‚Äôt quote me on that though)
---
Ayyyyyyy
---
I wish I had a bit more space because right now the speakers are behind the monitors
---
#BRUH
---
Tom Clancy never wanted people to play as terrorists in his games so it acts as a training exercise instead
---
But there are no operator from Isra.... Ooh wait, we've got Ash
---
lord omg lol hahahaha
---
There are three monitors on the table and a tv. 4 total
---
Wow your work is great, cool to blend the smoke at the bottom parts
---
Also the plague doctor we never got
---
It took me two years to read this book
---
Jesus.
---
it actually doesnt matter, caps or where the ! is
---
It's a stupid glitch, you can restart Ubisoft and Siege and get it. Or it will be there tomorrow or some shit like that.
---
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

That's just a sneak peek of the upcoming Glaz rework.

Hello CederSmuh, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dchsb4/fix_ranked/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I think they said once that it‚Äôs all training and the real deal could just be thunts
---
That's just rainbow nobody blames themselves it's all way someone else's fault this happens all the time on xbox plus with dosing ruins the whole game for me
---
Ahh, you must change your mindset. Flash hider is the best option on 70% of automatic weapons
---
[http://prntscr.com/pe2svt](http://prntscr.com/pe2svt). The software that XIM uses for example is a software that is used to trick the console/game into thinking its a controller. Its like walking into a bar you're banned from but wearing a different face.
---
Oh you play with him?
---
Brooooo0√∏o he got them HEELYS dawg
---
All fortnite does is steal content, the most remotely original thing is building, everything else is stolen (not counting guns and vehicles like golf carts and stuff) mechas? Stolen from Titanfall, planes? War Thunder, battlefield I could go on
---
Doot Doot!
---
Oh dear god, my life's a lie.
---
more than likely you have. The one I saw said ‚ÄúI love the new shields‚Äù or something like that. And it was this exact clip
---
took me a moment. well played...
---
Yes they do.
---
Imagine maining finka
---
Good. Because we just had a team with 2 griefing players with one playing Goyo. I wasn't even aware of this interaction and the Goyo player apparently was as they had RFF already and the Goyo came next to me while I was trying to reinforce wall and he intentionally placed the shield just before I finished reinforcing. I got kicked and softbanned for it...
---
Just to add, there are mtx but everything you can purchase can be obtained within game. Not defending mtx and I havent bought the game just saying there is no necessity to purchase things to get them it just quickens the process if you're impatient.
---
So does this mutual anger against most of Canada mean B.C. and Quebec can be friends?
---
That's a great concept for a headgear I hope it makes it's way into the game!
---
#is that an acog I see
---
Instead of giving you a common duplicate they just saved you time and took your %
---
Did they ever stop:(
---
What do you not like about it??
---
I never had the chance to use a commodore but from what you are saying, it sounds like a pain in the ass haha
---
#squigga is cool
---
Ok
---
Welcome to Siege.
---
It's been happening me the last few weeks as well. I lagged out of a ranked game. I played over 100 last season and that never once happened to me
---
Next shroud
---
Do y'all not have a calendar on ya phone???
---
Finally found a clash counter
---
Seriously guys I am a noob and have no idea how to tackle this bitch
---
Dont respond to him, hes a troll account. He just says dumb shit to get people mad.
---
Once again, been playing for over a year
---
That‚Äôs what the OP on IG said, and I kinda agree it‚Äôs a bit of a reach but to be fair when I first saw the Fortnite skin IQ elite came to mind so
---
Those pics were exposed to be fake
---
You seem pretty new to me ;)
---
The top 500 is flooded with people like this

Reduces Centering time, see? Forgot it also reduces first shot recoil as well
---
She‚Äôs obnoxious and is sleep inducing to play against. It just pointlessly slows the game down imo. She doesn‚Äôt really fit with the other ops either. And her voice is annoying
---
I don‚Äôt know what I think is worse, the fact that I laughed or the fact that I upvoted.
---
You know all jokes aside Clancy was a amazing writer (R.I.P Mate) ,and how he did it was well amazing as well it was helped a lot by his sources (note that his sources were the real deal ,but their identities have been concealed) ,so he knew exactly how things went for example the Splinter Cell series oh boy were they something ,and he knew what went down. (Splinter Cell series is the best on please @ me)
---
Why did you do this when you could have done that one fortnite skin where it is litteraly just blackbeard
---
No I don‚Äôt think I will
---
Why did everyone get  friendly fire warning like that? O.o
---
update?
---
It do be like that bro. I got kicked once at the end of first round after getting 2 kills and an injure. Only thing I can think of it that a few of my shots on the final kill cam missed.
---
Tom foolery

Vote to kick incoming

There has been some server degradation lately but it should be fixed soon.
---
Maestro too
---
this isn't even from siege originally, this was inspired by chun-li
---
looks like another FORTNITE BAD GIVE KARMA post
---
I already knew I‚Äôd see this down hereüôÑ
---
yes if they do it like modern warfare
---
input based cross-play  matchmaking 
---
would be great
---
I cry anytime I have that one :'(
---
Sensitivity seems a bit low but good job man
---
Thanks
---
monty looks like a classic Thomas the tank engine train
---
Honestly man, this game has one of the most toxic player bases I have ever seen.  People TK because they like to be assholes, constantly leave, are blatantly racist. It's honestly astounding.
---
Which is the most lethal?
---
Can you two not be super nice to each other? This is reddit. Nice things don't happen here except in r/wholesomememes . Rip each others throats out.
---
yes
---
*Every Rank Game During Burnt Horizon And Phantom Sight For Me*
---
Typically on console it's filled with mouse and keyboard... Oh wait... Thats all modes
---
it would be great, but there might be a few problems that would need to be sorted out
---
Have you been able to connect to an unranked match today? I usually only play that and ranked when I have friends on and I haven‚Äôt found an unranked game period. I‚Äôm on WUS if that makes any difference.
---
[uh dude, it‚Äôs called salt](https://imgur.com/a/EPbiYYb)
---
Seems like a typical thing for Ubisoft, For Honor is the same, I just expected them to have put some stuff in place to penalise people that leave and act toxic
---
#thanks
