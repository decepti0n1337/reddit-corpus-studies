His wife is alive, but you may be right about corruption in Rainbow

The underlying note may give a bigger hint but my latin isn‚Äôt that good.

If this ever in the game I‚Äôm yeehawing on everybody

Crowd Control means controlling the actions and movements of a group. I'm pretty sure a big fucking bear trap is gonna make you think twice about jumping through a window or over a barrier.

Starter edition just got free upgrade to standard edition for all starter edition owners
---
yeah true, wanted to get a gold charm at least though but doesnt look like thats happening
---
Yeah I know thats why I was confused
---
You're absolutely right, same as when you get frustrated trying to learn anything new, it's always good to take a small break and come back.
---
Yea I believe translated this means ‚Äúthe hunter Corp‚Äù
---
ADHD players just got their new main.
---
I didn‚Äôt even read that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Starter edition player here. All starter edition players received a change where all base ops are no 2k renown instead of 12.5k. it makes unlocking new ops much faster and makes it feel like less of a grind.
---
Yeah, I agree I was a bit to the side so that could have explained the melee, but I was still 2D and merged into the shield in the replay
---
sorry, I didn‚Äôt know the title ‚ÄúSick Mozzie Art‚Äù actually meant ‚Äúofficial ubi art‚Äù or ‚Äúubi art team‚Äù
---
That's up to you. Do you want to grind for ops or get several to start with. I bought mine with season pass starting year 2. But had to grind original 20 and year 1s. 
---
Happens pretty often.... 
---
oops lmao i meant deluxe

it's about the art not the characters

Vent: I love this game but solo queuing in casual is so frustrating. 15% chance you‚Äôll get team killed on purpose and 15% chance you‚Äôll randomly get kicked by your team. 
---
I just don‚Äôt understand what makes people enjoy ruining other people‚Äôs fun. I had time for one game before going to my second job and I get voted out of a game halfway through. Looking forward to the TK punishment going into effect.

Perhaps a loading screen for the loading screen? Maybe a loading screen for the loading of the loading screen just in case.

Because people on this subreddit are mostly faggots.

I‚Äôm pretty new to the game, so I‚Äôm just gonna go a head and study that top right corner

On console, with V-sync on its locked at 30, with it off its capped at 60 but dips from time to time to 50, but only for like a second

I missed that part of the stream then

I know, I'm just saying, if you wanna do all the recruit colors

Not only stole it, but really downgraded the image quality 
---
Spy would be a 3 speed 1 armor
---
Merc would be 2 speed 2 armor 
---
I'd like to see some sort of vision mechanic (like the Sonar Goggles) on one of the operators. I'd also like to see the Fourth Echelon Spider-Bot (though do we have too many drones?) or some other gadget like the Ring Airfoil and introduce a knock out mechanic or something like that.
---
I like ur art style
---
*NO RUNNIN‚Äô IN THE HALLS!*
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
Yeah same thing happened to me and my friends in ranked, we were all playing but then kicked from the game in round 2, but stayed in the same party
---
I must have missed that part of the stream.
---
Thank you 
---
Yep
---
Deus Vult(?)

congratulations 
---
Didn't it leak like a year or so ago?
---
 My internet has gone out only during ranked matches for some reason recently. Went from gold 3 to silver 3 in a day so I feel you
---
I know and it irks me every time. I haven't seen something quite like that though.
---
Love this style! Nomad looks so cute 
---
Man, must be so wet. Why don't you just live on land like everyone else?
---
you can buy Bundles for R6 Credits but the single skins for renown in the normal operator tab
---
I think after -10 you stop losing. 
---
Just like how upvotes and karma aren‚Äôt the same. After certain upper and lower limits they stop being equivalent.

I went from console to PC (700+ hours on xbox) and got the highest while kt was 70% off. 
---
If you can afford it, its too good of a deal to pass up, and helped push a few friends to PC as well.
---
Yea Idk why I felt the need to put those since it was pretty damn obvious
---
What if you could grind for acoldes or titles on your characters/guns (stat tracks on CS for example) and other shit without having to grind the ops.
---
I'm not against grind. I'm an osrs player. I'm against bad business models.
---
They could add new things to grind, new things to grind in significant and fun ways that actually feel challenging. We just have the lazy way of grinding which is passive grinding that isn't any fun and it's just there as a wall for content.
---
I'm ok with that form of grinding when it comes to none-core gameplay stuff, but ops is crossing a line since it directly affects the outcome of a game. Caveira right now is completely busted due to her "bug", but I can't play her due to not having her. I have to suffer in ranked against players who have her and abuse her mechanics (it's not really a bug, it's just a mechanic abuse) without a single chance of me doing it myself, I'm at a direct disadvantage due to it. Maverick too and many other ops. Don't have ela so holding stairs with her on bank is not a strat I can do either which directly impacts how much I can win the map.
---
That‚Äôs stupid
---
Eh, Buck has too much kick for an ACOG to be effective in my opinion.
---
They might look at removing it from Twitch‚Äôs F2, I can seem removing it from IQ‚Äôs AUG, which is fine since the commando is better imo.
---
In terms of operators that would lose their ACOGs I honestly don‚Äôt know lmao.
---
That latin doesn‚Äôt translate to anything significant from what I can tell. Lorem ipsum dolor is typically Latin placeholder text.

yeah i think ill do it, only 12 bucks

Clearly you just need to watch that flank until the round ends. 
---
no, this guys just a raging penis.
---
the fact that this appears on his bio page and in two official blog posts does though.
---
don't get me wrong I've commisioned stream assets and will ALWAYS give credit to the artist I paid because he is responsible for the amazing work.
---
i just think at this point snark wasn't really necessary and the onus of credit falls on ubi first before op can give it.
---
Dang I was hoping ubi would give a tease or something
---
Doki regardless is sexy mami
---
Looks a little like Paul George with no hair

Well I think both of our opinions have our rights and wrongs...let‚Äôs just accept that and call it a day

Add this without telling anyone, See how long it takes for the community to figure it out since no one ever actually picks their drones back up anyways.

you know, I was gonna say that we have other types of knives too but I honestly can't think of any others...
---
Idk... sounds fishy.
---
Yeah I think it was part of the roadmap reveal but I‚Äôd have to rewatch it.
---
haha you said the p*nis word
---
This is just an awful idea for both sides. Attack it would be broken, defense it would be terrible lol
---
Oh yep I‚Äôm putting that on rn
---
I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you chief but there are two
---
Not at all what I mean. 
---
My point is that the current hibana artwork shows a white teen male. With your logic hibana could be a martian but I'd still be in the wrong
---
If we go to the actual in game model [i'd say she looks more than half japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq7-wfYO_-I)
---
Please go around and ask your friends and family with a picture of the current hibana and ask for her race and gender. I'll be damned if they don't respond white male.
---
Link to the year 2 ops?

No, it‚Äôs downvoted because it‚Äôs literally a worthless comment. It‚Äôs like commenting ‚Äúlol.‚Äù Just upvote and move on. Don‚Äôt clutter the comment section.

Yeah. If a Ubi rep sees this I would gladly send over the account name of the player who force booted us out of the game. It was weird because it enacted that old bug where you can't search because it thinks your party members are already in a game.

Blitz is annoying and fucks u up mostly how u gne counter him if u have no nitro cell or lesion mines he is already getting a ads nerf but will still be toxic cause everyone only uses melee

Check config file is FPS is locked ? Or try roll back nvidia drivers if you recently updated them
---
look at the other lower case a's in the picture, I can see why it looks like an E
---
Really? :o
---
There's stuff on the left of the map that makes me believe there's a traitor in Rainbow. Do you think that Vigil could be the one? I personally think Alibi.
---
He is more annoying than blitz himself
---
Best year so far! (In my opinion)
---
Don't reload in front of your enemies?

yes but due to the autism i didn‚Äôt start speaking until i was 7 years old

Or, you know, we‚Äôre blaming M&amp;K because it‚Äôs effectively cheating. It puts you at an inherent advantage with how much more precise the input is. It‚Äôs not fair any way you look at it, but go on, make some sort of baseless counter argument so you feel justified in cheating.

Huh... guess I was wrong then but it wouldn't be enough to ban that one.

Why wouldn‚Äôt it be enough?

Harry became six at the beginning of the game. The old six is talking to Harry in those cut scene, we just see them through his eyes 
---
WHEN HE USES ALL OF HIS SHOTS IN HIS CLIP THEN WAIT TILL HE RELOADS AND STAY KINDA FAR AWAY AT ALL TIMES SO HE CAN'T FLASH YOU. 
---
What makes you think that 
---
Why does he use a hammer when he can just smash walls open with that fuckin jawline absolute unit
---
It's the new main antagonist, Mr. Harry Whitemask. He's responsible for Bartlett, Outbreak, and Jaeger's ACOG removal.
---
Ash pls comfort me :( I still don't have Ritz
---
I legit thought this post was r/Destiny when I saw it 
---
Aren't these part of the frogmen corps. though?
---
Yeah especially because his boat is named after her too. Iron Maggie.
---
Because I could say that I smurf but actually doesn't. Or that Iam a hacker for playing that good but don't. 
---
&gt;How are Cav, Jackal, and Alibi global operators?
---
Global abilities: an ability that affects opponents of an enemy team and is revealed to all the friendlies.
---
Now, go back to my statement.
---
&gt;Cav‚Äôs silent step doesn‚Äôt immediately affect everyone on the map.
---
Neither do any of those, unless they make themselves vulnerable to Cav.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs only relevant when she‚Äôs close to another operator.
---
Whaaaaat? It's relevant once she gets an interrogation. Simple.
---
&gt; Jackal can only track one defender at a time.
---
Still global, since everybody can see it.
---
&gt;Alibi has to rely on someone to shoot or touch her prisma, and even then it only marks one attacker.
---
1- lion has to rely on somebody moving, and it still pings for 2 seconds, not 5 like alibi, or 20 like jackal. Stand still is not a counter, but now, even running away is a counter since it barely pings you.
---
2- one prisma can be shot by all 5 attackers. That's 15 different pings. 15 ways to make your ENTURE team aware where the enemies are. If thats not global, I don't know what is.
---
&gt;None of those can be considered global 
---
They satisfy the meaning of "global". Hence, "global".
---
but like, look at Maestro and Smoke, they‚Äôre written normally, so did someone fuck up in the graphics
---
Yeah good point. Thanks for this civilized conversation. Don‚Äôt find much of them on reddit
---
There's a picture of old Hereford (at least I think it's old version) with some stuff saying that Rainbow may be compromised, and when Alibi was revealed the devs said she has her own agenda outside of Rainbow.
---

New cinematic. Look up rainbow six cinematic on YouTube 
---
First, go play on pc or go back to your conrtoller, it's not fun if you have an advantage over a majority of the players. Second, how small is your pp that you go play on a keyboard and mouse on console?
---
That is true and also quite sad.
---
He is the real antagonist of this whole game, he is the reason why the CTUs fight each other
---
So the fact that Cav's op reveal shows ALL the attackers to ALL the defenders doesn't seem global? Not does alibi's ping, or Jackal's scan? Or the fact that rook gives ALL defenders plates?
---
Has the definition of global been changed overnight?
---
Why are so many people taking this seriously, it was meant as a joke
---
Right.
---
Ok. As long as you have fun, problem solved.
---
Anyone notice there was a device labeled proximity alarm in the electronics part?
---
You have your heart rate on display? Interesting 
---
Yooo wtf Chimera was Y3? Feels like so long ago
---

I love Clash's face. üòÇ
---
I read the circle with the question mark like they lost him, like, they knew where he was a month ago, but he went on this mission and just like ??? Where is he now? Who know, hope he comes back XD
---
The thing is though, Mozzies device is one of those devices that only really works against team Rainbow... just like the phone calls from Dokkaebi, what's the point, the White Masks don't use phones or Drones, so all he can get at is... us
---
For real.
---
Who made this? I want to find more pics like this...
---
Such sad brother
---
That's not even true. Nomad and finka are the only female attackers that came out in year 3
---
i‚Äôm convinced that people like you have some sort of alert for when people post this topic on here so you can storm into these threads and make the same argument over and over again. no matter how many times you complain ubisoft is not going to do anything about mnk on console to figure out ways to work around that. you are not going to become a better player if your first instinct upon dying is to accuse someone of mouse and key. for the record, i‚Äôve been playing on console with a controller for three years now but i like how quick you are to call me out just because i don‚Äôt adhere to your stupid circlejerk
---
You the first chanka main I‚Äôve ever seen i salute u sir
---
yes thats the point , plus you can use your LMG to fire back which is a lot better then a pistol 
---
Dude probably got spawnpeeked by a cav with her pistol.
---
Cut him some slack. Clearly salty.
---
I hope the new ranked changes fix this
---
i hope Ubi will listen 
---
Yeah still sound OP.
---
Where can I find the original vid/pic??
---
I love all the salt here and it's not like it's well deserved cuz it is but I run in to M&amp;K alot and yeah that may best me in alot of him fights but not all cuz I learn how to react faster or just adapt 
---
So accurate 
---
I thought the US special service one was the gal and the danish one was a dude.
---
How does it feel to cheat? Officially?
---
Literally nothing mentioned in the patch notes would address this, unfortunately, except the TK thing but that honestly is a side issue to how fucked this match was from the start.
---
Or theyre giving a nod to the guy who made it as a nice thanks to their community 
---
yes it is its leaked year 4 ops
---
If I ever see anything related to lord Tachanka, bandit likes drugz xd, etc. I just downvote that shit.
---
Kill twitch with her own drone after she downed
---
 I never said to waste all your shots hip firing. You can shoot 10 and have some left over. Also, your teammates should have your back. Walk around the corner and reload while you back up. It's a Pistol not an lmg.
---
If your playing keyboard and mouse on console that would mean your to shit to play on pc which means we win sorta, I guess..
---
We can still hope. Hope is all I have left now that my Ritz are gone :(
---
I rewatched it just to make sure. They definitely said the Danish op is female, however they didn‚Äôt mention attack or defense. I think it‚Äôs just implied that the Secret Service op is a defender. 
---
Thanks, I was looking for a new wallpaper. If you still have more siege wallpaper can you comment it pls?
---
Maybe they got permission to use this image for some reason? I highly doubt Ubisoft would steal some picture from some other game without permission. That's way too high a risk for them.
---
Map knowledge is key. Performing angles is also a good strategy but you need to know the angles to prefire 
---

At least OP didn't have a red circle.

Holy shit I'm stupid. I just assumed it was console because of the graphic settings and low fov
---
It's a twitch inside joke
---
But... what's in the canister!?!?!
---
Almost 500 hours and still learning. Get a proper operator and map knowledge is the key.
---
Yo that's fucken spooky
---
Best thing you can do is either grind terrorist hunt on different maps or go into a private match by yourself and visualize clearing your way to different sites on offense. Defense is a bit harder to practice because it‚Äôs all about holding angles as an anchor or predicting movements of attackers as a roamer. To practice defense I suggest playing a lot of casual and just focusing on why you died and what you could have done to avoid it if anything.

I don't think the 707th really hate each other, at least. Dokka just thinks Vigil was sent to spy on her, and Vigil is too much of a uncommunicative weirdo to make it clear he's just trying to look out for her, apparently.
---
Sonar Goggles would be cool, be able to see exactly where gunshots are coming from, and maybe see someone running if they're close. Hell maybe if an explosion happens you get an outline of the whole room it happened in for a second.
---
 Only problem with his KO weapons is you'd have to line up a shot on an enemy and choose not to just shoot them, but Sam *did* have sticky cameras you could shoot from his gun with a limited FOV.

Learn the maps. That's like the biggest thing I can suggest. Other than that another good thing is to try and REALLY play the objective. These days I find most people are just playing for kills rather than the win. While there's nothing wrong with getting frags it's not gonna help you as much as I think playing obj does. You learn patience and discipline which is great for you, especially in a 1 v X situation. Once you have to play that objective because of the time it can really help you because then you're FORCED to actually win that engagement or else it could really cost the round.
---
Did you even read what I just said?

Of course, that'd be his biggest counter, non electronic traps and damage. Though I think there are some limitations that would be necessary, like not being invis to pulse through walls. Maybe a slower, fainter heartbeat would be acceptable however. Just a slightly slipperier attacker than usual to allow scouting in place of droning. And idk, maybe some less powerful guns to counter his stealth, combined that with two-speed and he becomes a fairly nice balance of useful and counterable.
---
Literally and conceptually
---
Good to know someone agrees.
---
Yes, using the shield is honestly the worst mistake you can ever make when you're playing 1 out of 2 operators with access to the best sight in the game
---

so let me get this you dont like the fact that it cost money to get characters that do and are going to get cheaper overtime if you actually play the game?You bring up games like CS or dota 2 why not play those games instead also the cavi "bug" your mad at because you dont own her and cant abuse her at the moment.There are quest you can do hell they even gave everyone a free pack that guaranteed a op.I get that you feel like its a scummy cash grab but there is worse things devs and a company have done *cough for honor and dead by daylight cough* or the community of fortnite living cancer look at the positives of this game

I don't think you can upgrade from the starter to a different edition. I don't get why it let you purchase the deluxe edition though, most likely a bug. Contact Ubisoft support and try to get some help with it (make sure you have proof of purchase ready to send)

nevermind, I realized i purchased it twice on my xbox account... I dont know why that would even work since i have all the ops on xbox. I really didnt want to spend 36 dollars on a 12 dollar game. 
---
... so the spawn rate was 50%...
---
Is that fucking chain mail? I love it. I may find my new mains if they look like that.
---
Even though it does sort of take away the objective of the game it still can be countered by awareness
---
It's really not a lame move you're just too dumb to learn how to prefire a spawnpeek. It's pretty predictable shit and if you die to it you only have yourself to blame.
---
Interesting to mention, smoko is one if my favourite defenders and it wont be the first time sombody on my team as ran into my toxic beauties on bomb. I hope its not, but i think it might be.

Ubi is doing shit recently 
---
Got a 1440p version?
---
is that happenning
---
I saw the exact same thing on Wikipedia. But guess what... it‚Äôs still classified as a military branch. And yes I guess GIGN would be a somewhat equivalent to the SWAT but the National Gendarmerie is A MILITARY BRANCH. They may do close to the same thing but the SWAT isn‚Äôt a military branch. You even forgot to take out the part where it says they have military status when you copy and pasted it. Also to start this, you just plainly said the GIGN and the National Gendarmerie wasn‚Äôt part of the military.
---
Most likely wont count towards TKs, there was a similar issue with Thermite's charges a good while ago. People would troll anyone playing Thermite by crowding around the charge for an instant kick so the devs made those TKs not matter.
---
Smoke's smoke will likely be treated the same if it's not already.
---
Won‚Äôt that incentivize people to not be toxic? In my book it‚Äôs a way to cut down on toxicity
---
Does this stuff happen a lot on Xbox? On PS4 I've only had it ever happen once, (well I'm pretty sure they ddosed our teammate but I have no proof)
---
I guess I'm not sleeping tonight...
---
Oh okay, well I still think 2 of something is too much, it wastes a lot of utility. Maybe if you do the extended think as well so it's easier/safer for attackers to place breaching charges. Idk I'm conflicted because I gave it some thought and I feel that your point is quite valid but I feel the in game consequences would be too much. If Ubi could run the test server differently than now, like use it to experiment then maybe but idk. My biggest issue is that castle is a finesse op at higher levels and making him too strong makes him less of a high level situational op and maybe too noob friendly and too noob problematic (like attacking is harder) but again idk. Yeah I usually roam or anchor out of obj, like upstairs and such. I like shotguns in general for flanking and up close fights. 
---
so stop being toxic, this game is incredibly stupid when it comes to shit like that, you can't even say cunt or whore anymore and if someone at ubi is like "oh this guy has said this a lot" then they have the right to ban you as stupid as that is
---
a lot of people have turned off their text chat for this very reason
---
If you couldn't tell it was a joke and 99% of everyone else could doesn't that make you the internet retard?
---
That‚Äôs because anti roam can mean 2 things:
---
If you are attack and anti roam then you make things hell for roamers (jackal, doki)
---
If you are defend and anti roam then you are an anchor such as Tachanka and maestro (Rook of course is supposed to anchor, but can be used as a roamer)
---
Getting some tchanka vibes not gonna lie
---
That ying and Ash tho.
---
They need to go back into TH and practice aim.
---
Good thing you don‚Äôt play with me then lol. I purposely say Kade because it‚Äôs much easier and faster than saying Kai-eeed. Also, people still can‚Äôt pronounce Caviera or Dokkaebi properly. 
---
&gt;Its not about me dying to it, its the fact that that's a key component to the game. If you just so happen to find better loot you have a higher chance of winning an engagement against someone else
---
Except that's not true at all. It's not a key component. The key component of BR games is having better positioning, especially mid-late game otherwise you will get trampled on by enemy teams who may have slightly worse weapons/gear.
---
If an enemy team ambushes you, it doesn't matter if you have level 1 armor or level 3 armor because they are going to laser you to death and 2 extra bullets isn't going to make a difference in all that chaos.
---
&gt;i dont no why you're having trouble understanding that..
---
Because you've shown time and time again that you don't know what you're talking about.
---
If it actually does say Dok is too young, what the fucks with Mute then? Im pretty sure he's the youngest Op in Rainbow atm.
---
What? So what you're saying is stop communicating in a tactical game? I understand where you come from with the "Stop being toxic" part but when you get reported for trying to STOP a toxic argument from breaking out and you get banned because of it then that's where it becomes a problem.
---
&gt; screws over the opponent
---
I can see how spawn peeking can be unfun but it‚Äôs literally the nature of a competitive game to screw over your opponent in a fair way. If you kill a Thermite by running out Yellow Stairs on a Consulate Garage hold, you‚Äôve just screwed over your opponent. If you twitch the Miras on an Oregon Basement attack, you‚Äôve just screwed over your opponent. 
---
Just cause spawn peeking happens earlier in the game doesn‚Äôt mean it has no competitive integrity. It‚Äôs high risk high reward if the Attackers know common spawn peeks. If you expect the Defenders to give you free map control you‚Äôre out of your mind. Map control doesn‚Äôt start inside the building, it starts from where the defenders have lines of sight towards the spawns. Attackers can use that map control to prevent runouts, cut off rotations, and defenders can use that map control to apply pressure to the Attackers.
---
Okay cool I like not killing operators too
---
for a second i thought it was abortion
---
U prob got banned for being toxic, smurfing will not get u banned in siege. There‚Äôs tons of YouTubers and players that are in Low rank but their skills are plat skills, while smurfing will not get u banned, boosting will. So stop complaining and go get a new acc, ubi doesn‚Äôt lift the ban hammer easily 
---
And here I am, waiting for a Finnish operator.
---
Remember, No Russian
---
Glaz is currently used as an Entry Fragger at higher levels of play. In Comp Play Glaz is banned I would guess around 40-50% of all matches. A good glaz is crazy powerful on some maps  
---
Other big bans for annoyance on attack (pre-kaid and Nomad): are Jackel, Shields, BB. 
---
It's not good.
---
&gt;!It's the best!&lt;
---
spawnpeeking sucks, but getting ran out on when you think they're going to just shoot you from a far away window hurts the soul
---
just to be clear. im not saying you shouldnt. siege is (lol) competitive game, and you should work within the mechanics to win
---
Black ice isn't that good, change my mind, and you all could have got it in y1s1
---
100% this. All scopes that are created should be on all operators. Period. 
---
You think the game being just "a hero shooter" is good enough reason for people's opinions on its artistic/representative content to be invalid, and that's just a flimsy mentality. 
---
Other games with selectable characters being colorful, cartoony experiences, somehow equates to "the content in a completely different game should follow the same tonal guidelines". That's a seriously odd mentality. That's like saying that every Moba has to be a fantasy game because "that's what Mobas are."
---
Siege stood out initially because it was a departure from both the tac/military themed shooters in terms of gameplay content, without straying completely from the aesthetic and world. Now it dabbles more in cheesy B-movie-tier writing, characters, and design, and apparently we're just supposed to like it because "Siege was always a character shooter anyways lol" and that's just reductive.
---
I'm not an active ranked player. All I know is that you get a charm, cosmetic to hang on your guns, that shows which rank you had
---
I got banned for reports lmfao, if you were getting scammed you wouldn't complain. People report people for smurfing whenever they feel like it which is abuse of the system am I wrong?
---
Been there, it sucks. 
---
Maybe. Valk seemed pretty hostile towards the Ghosts towards the end of that mission.

You get banned, you have to buy a new copy (new unbanned account). That just makes sense, it‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúBig corporate scam‚Äù   
---
I‚Äôm sorry you got banned when you think you did nothing wrong.   Not calling you toxic, but Ubisoft support seems to believe you broke some rule of conduct.   
---
When you said in your post that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been toxic before, but who hasn‚Äôt‚Äù ^(Me and my friends haven‚Äôt) what did you mean specifically? (If you don‚Äôt mind me asking(
---
Ying is 1.60 meters btw.
---
One of the best anchors if well placed, 9x9 and his lmg have very little recoil. He's just an ordinary op with a mounted lmg. It's not because you die a lot with him using his lmg that it means he's bad. Maybe people should change strats with him, but that's just my opinion.
---
You serious there, pal?
---
Just as awesome as previous two! Gj!

"So what you're saying is stop communicating in a tactical game?"

Yeah I agree I get the US has a lot of special forces but how about more from other countries 
---
How the fuck do you get banned on r6 twitch, I didn‚Äôt even know that‚Äôs a thing. 
---
Can‚Äôt you just make a new account though?
---
Oh, so everyone would be able to kill one person before receiving damage. It makes sense, but would keep toxicity levels high. 
---
According to my friends... This is also me.
---
A flick and swish *leviosaaa*
---
&gt;it‚Äôs an exception to an otherwise accurate rule.

Wait you just said it was an exception.  How am I wrong?  
---
They plan on making him louder, but they can't handle all the audio coding right now, so they're changing his swap speed 
---
A roamers job isn't to be stealthy and flank (a majority of the time). Roamers key role is to kill time for the attacking team and take as many people with them as they can. You could say stealth could be implemented into that but really once you make your first move, you're discovered, which is fine, since it's hard to lock down a  roamer in most situations. 
---
Stealth isn't really a huge mechanic in this game since it plays much differently than CS:GO.

---
On Bank you should always prefire bottom part of the left window when spawning on Jewelery. I can't count times when I did it just to be safe and killed spawnpeeking Doc/Rook/Echo. It's really easy and they are often salty because they were dead before they even see you.
---
That's what I'm saying, being able to go invisible and killing defenders without them seeing you would be broken, Although right now Gridlock is broken
---
are you stupid? do you really think your gonna connect to 15 million players? first of all there are factors that are gonna change who you find. What servers are you gonna connect to? eus? wus? cus? or scus? What‚Äôs your casual elo? low? medium? high? There are factors that are involved not just ‚Äúthis guy is queuing right now lets put these people in a game regardless of ping or skill‚Äù

---
I don't get why they didn't put in a Greek operator this year tbh because they even teased one in Year 2 during the mid season reinforcements when that was a thing, would have been nice instead of another U.S operator.
---
To make things short: this game wasn‚Äôt 100% made with stealth in mind so I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs why there isn‚Äôt much stealth in it. (I reread what I typed out and it‚Äôs all not really important to read so I‚Äôll summarize it)
---
I think the reason this game doesn‚Äôt really have stealth is because it‚Äôs team oriented and there isn‚Äôt much room for traditional ‚Äústealth‚Äù you can use some of the roamers as stealthy characters but it‚Äôs just reduced footsteps. I also think there isn‚Äôt much stealth because of the map sizes and the way the maps are made. The maps aren‚Äôt made for people to play stealthy, they‚Äôre made with the mindset to blow up walls, move with your team into areas as units and stuff like that. If you have ever played games like splinter cell blacklist and played spies vs mercs (the multiplayer) the maps are mostly dark and have loads of hiding spots for players to roam around in. A lot of the maps in siege have decent lighting so everyone can see what they‚Äôre looking at. NOW I KNOW splinter cell was made with being a stealthy character in mind but it‚Äôs the only comparison I can think of.

---
There are not 30 windows. Very few windows actually provide favorable peeks into a spawn. And those are very much known by the whole community that plays the game semi regularly. Stop being salty and start playing smart. 
---
can I get the sauce on were you guys got this?
---
Had a dream today, that this op will have a big breakable shield, similar to Montagne, and'll make him invisible for deffenders. But shure it must be noisy and maybe visible for cams.
---
Sorry, sir, but that's where we spec ops: draw the line
---
Reminds me of Borderlands 2
---
Am I the only one that realises that fuze isn't at the shield ops?
---
I was generalizing the games player count. For a game that has 15 million players among all platforms you'd expect a good sum of them to still be up at 10pm.  I'm from the region of North America so I have a good variety of servers full of people to connect from. And how would I know my casual elo which isn't called that by the way it's casual MMR. Which in case isn't show cased to you in any screen I've been shown in the game. If you were talking about ranked I wasn't in ranked and the rank of gold IV should give a good representation of elo skill level or level to where me and my friends like to dick around in ranked and actually try to enjoy the game and still lose. My ping like I said was actually pretty fine for my crappy internet that likes to give me the finger most matches, I even checked this in my network settings and I was given a nice bit of positives.

There‚Äôs will be a new operator is siege in the next update. He‚Äôs nickname is Dane because he‚Äôs Danish. I‚Äôm assuming the cat and mouse means he will be like an opposite to vigil. This probably isn‚Äôt Nomad from Wildlands and there‚Äôs a higher possibility that it‚Äôs Dane (if it was a ghost recon character, he would be wearing his canon/marketing clothing)
---
Let me help you to reach 100 updoot
---
I gotta say, it's really awesome to see operators from the same ctu actually have some kind of friendship chemistry. Like Mozzie is hyper and can't sit still and Gridlock is more grounded and doesn't really put up with his nonsense.
---
doc is good shallow roam and lurk, but he's never going to pull a flank, which you need someone at least, to be capable of.
---
You're right, except the Australian map, there will only be reworks. Maybe it's for Y5 ?
---
Yeah i found some good angles you can hold from up there, if you open up the top part of the wall you can hold defuser if planted for door, or watch the jump in on the window as a defender.
---
I do wonder why the decided to make the Danish OP a female. When all photos that exists of them, clearly are male.
---
It‚Äôs funny how there are youtubers that flex their xim clips with all their mnk buddies and they think they‚Äôre good

Is this from r6 or Alita Battle Angel?

It‚Äôs clear these kids never played halo 2 or 3 in its prime 
---
Ok $5000 dollars please

Ur shots with that revolver looked too fast for a controller player

Maybe: in the concept art of Mozzie and Gridlock where they arr recruited by Six, we can see that Six has two plane tickets to Greece.

Well yea, its VR training, its even tied in to the book and the hitreg is atrocious there as well.
---
True. For mixing them up I feel like that's Ubi's direction atm for all of the seasons that don't include a map. This is how they are able to include more countries, as in for example this year that we have 7 different countries.
---
But I still do agree that 2 Danish ops would be better than 1 Danish and 1 American
---
Oh, so vigil isn't useful? Let me tell u my friend. You're using him wrong
---
Yeah I think I might. You would think all the unlocked dlc operators and skins would be tied to his PS4 account but who knows if he bought the cheaper versions of the game digitally if it auto locks you out of that stuff.

Not exactly the same LMG, just the same scope.

Yes :)

And no present special forces look like WWII soldiers or a russian drug dealer (looking at you, Glaz). Those are secondary skins, optional, nothing else.

Would love that.
---
Team Rainbow needs an upgrade.
---
And the smoke grenades on defence too 
---
Sounds very similar to the smg12, only, slower.
---
Quick question from someone ootl but are the operators getting cosmetic reworks?
---
I like the old maps too. But the way I look at it now is them pushing this game towards being huge in e-sports will only increase the longevity of the game further.
---
If you LOVE this game like I do, this can only be a good thing. 
---
How do you use it as a wallpaper?

Yeah.....the upcoming lion nerf is fine. We don't need them to alter a balanced  operator.

Wallpaper Engine on Steam!

All I want is F2 and 416C Black Ice. I almost have most of black ice except my mains. :/
---
No, you divide by 4 because a leap year only happen once every fourth year. If you‚Äôre multiplying you‚Äôre saying February 29 happens 4 times a year
---
I agree with this one. If its something that actually works within the context of the game and doesn't look stupid I'm all for it.

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúJ√¶gerkorpset‚Äù we don‚Äôt use the ‚Äú√§‚Äù in danish language.

Cap if you have a coordinated team, buck if you want to be meta-proof and low responsibility-high reward op, Hibana if you want a meta proof hard breacher.

You didnt hear? He left the great war to fulfill his dream of becoming the best R6 history teacher.

This happens on all traps that can kill like Kaplan‚Äôs trap, bandits battery‚Äôs, kaids shock thing, etc

After removal of acog for R4C. You will see a lot of player will use G36C for the acog.

IMO, G36C is the one of the best wep out there.

As a Swede i‚Äôm triggered that the Danish will get siege OPS before us :(

Yeah but I still rarely play Ash. To me she is just a 3 speed with above average guns and a breach charge as an ability. I like to go either jackal or a hard breacher

---
You are objectively wrong, I'm not from Britain but they have some of best, if not the best, spec ops in the world, SAS in the forefront. JTF2 has the most has the most high ranked terrorist take downs in the world. Black Storks, Alpha Group, etc. US is up there not going to lie but objectively they are not the best
---
Ja. Se nedenfor
---
We have an ak74 though 
---
Denmark and Greece both on the board, as well as Australia. Couldn‚Äôt see any other new countries, but I might have missed one. 
---
Hammer time 
---
I saw Denmark on the map, and a note mentioned working with ‚ÄúDane‚Äù. So I think we could be seeing Danish ops. 
---
I think Britain has more
---
I disagree. 
---
The fans have delved too literally into this, I've seen arguments over it previously, whether or not the wiring is electrical, etc.
---
"It ain't that serious."
---
If you can stand in mutes jammer radius and not be detected (which isn't realistic in any universe either), I don't see what the big deal is about that.
---
People hate blitz so much, this is literally one of the very few ways to counter his flashes.
---
Momentarily, I might add.
---
The odds of it happening are miniscule.
---
IF it happens, it's serendipitous anyway.
---
IDK. I just don't think it's something that occurs nearly often enough to have that strong opinion on it personally. 
---
I'm always surprised when I see this discussion re-introduced. Like, "really? Is Mute thwarting all these Blitz' players THAT much?"
---
Just my two cents, though.
---
No the next one on the fire rate
---
Just like the simulations

She isnt jewish dude

Only when he has the demon mask on, though.

It's for all dbno resets 
---
good thing Glaz doesnt have a one hit kill rifle anymore. cant wait for his Thermal scope to get nerfed.
---
I dont understand, how you legends make these
---
Let's say Ubi has about 13k employees at its' disposal (which it does, and is already more than EA and Rockstar Studios combined). Let's say the R6s team is composed of about **2k** people which still COULD be more, and let's ALSO assume that only about 50-100 devs could work on Terro Hunt at once. And you're saying Ubisoft CANNOT dedicate a month to reworking Terro Hunt?
---
Great thing they made it clear it's "faulty" defuser scenario, because I cannot count how many times I raged when we died after planting the defuser.
---
Destroyer*
---
Its bloody beautiful!
---
Also yes I know that may be ridiclious.
---
Nice game ;)
---
What panel?
---
I think your suggestion would make Lion WAY more broken than he already is, even pre-rework, just based on the charges and timer alone.
---
Also, for consistency purposes, unless the throwable gadget is actually a camera, Vigil should not be able to counter it. Vigil's gadget works by erasing his image from *visual* recordings, he's not a walking mute jammer. So, if it's a soundwave-based scan like it is right now, or, say, a depth-measuring laser, he should be detected even if cloaked. 
---
I was literally just about to comment this

Said "*slur* is a waste of drawing" which is just a really odd reaction, do they not see the other non white people in the game?

Let me correct you: It's called Shitscraper.

You can combine two wallpapers side by side in paint, and maybe it will work.

This literally happened to me a couple months ago. I was in a party with my friends and they didn‚Äôt set it to Invite Only, so the entire enemy team joined our party and started ddosing us and they actually were able to get into my Xbox settings and change things around so that I couldn‚Äôt get in a party other than the one that they were in. It took me forever to figure out what they changed.
---
with their toothbrush

It used to do 185. Then they nerfed it to 85. I believe it‚Äôs 75 now.

the thread that goes to lesion is from thatcher

Sledge using his massively oversized sledge hammer helping Thatcher build his boat, by gingerly tapping in the smallest of nails. Meanwhile Mute is in the hull fitting Jammers so Thatcher has peace of mind of no enemy equipment operating around him.

So you‚Äôre going to sit there and tell me Black storks, Alpha group and JTF2 is better experienced, better trained and have a better track record than American special forces? Be serious for once, Black storks are all propaganda and the Alpha group hasn‚Äôt done much in comparison to American specops. I respect JTF2 but they‚Äôre Mr Classified, so you can‚Äôt validly much considering they never leave much info out. If you base it off their training, then yeah, they‚Äôre pretty much equal to the names special forces. Also, If I‚Äôm not wrong, I did mention the SAS being on the top (they are the best but not by a big margin).

Don‚Äôt ask other people if your sensitivity is all right. It‚Äôs all based on preference, cause I go for defaults which is like 50 and 55 at 800DPI and I do fine

Yeah, except for the fact that the Cold War is over. This is why I never understand why people feel the need to bring in Clancy over everything about this game. The dude wrote a lot of Cold War fiction, and that just isn't relevant today, where counter-terrorism is a more relevant topic.
---
YES
---
THE PROJECT IS COMPLETE!
---
It's not about whether they are able to or not, it's about whether it's worth the money. Since they haven't done it yet or announced any plans for it, we can assume it isn't.
---
The salaries of 50-100 people is quite a lot. And that's ignoring the wasted potential of having them work on something else. T-Hunt isn't played by many, and since Siege is mainly a PvP game, it probably doesn't make sense for them to put a lot of effort into remaking the mode. After all, there's always the risk of it staying unpopular even if they remake it.
---
I don't own a PS4 we might be able to arrange something though. Stop by the stream when you have time and discuss it with Slim\_PS. 
---
Play T-Hunt and only accept headshots. Don‚Äôt worry about winning it, just train for the head. 
---
Also, with the SMG 12 use vertical grip. And fire short burst, it‚Äôs actually not bad once you get good with it. 
---
SMG 11 is probably the easiest out of the 3, I still can‚Äôt seem to grasp the Bearing 9 personally. 
---
I basically quit playing Hibana because of the Bearing 9 nerf lol

Oh nvm

It's the most ancient street in Greece. In English it's translated "Sacred Way" which you can find more info in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Way).

1v1s are pretty useless, not a show of skill in a team based game, and don‚Äôt help improve you at all. Why do u want to do them

Forgot what a marine was. Pshhhh
---
**Sacred Way**
---
The Sacred Way (Ancient Greek: ·ºπŒµœÅ·Ω∞ ·ΩâŒ¥œåœÇ, Hier√° Hod√≥s), in ancient Greece, was the road from Athens to Eleusis. It was so called because it was the route taken by a procession celebrating the Eleusinian Mysteries. The procession to Eleusis began at the Sacred Gate in the Kerameikos (the Athenian cemetery) on the 19th Boedromion.
---
In the present day, the road from central Athens to Aegaleo and Chaidari (the old route to Eleusis) is called the Iera Odos after the ancient road.

Bad thing is, is that mute has an MP5K. We‚Äôd have to give the new guy a new weapon or it just wouldn‚Äôt make sense why mute wouldn‚Äôt get the same kind of ability with his MP5K.
---
Consulate has at least 3 peek spots per spawn, Kanal, and Kafe
---
Because giving monty and blitz grenades would allow them to clear out obstacles without help. Blitz wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about being shot when destroying barbed wire for example. This allows them to be more versatile overall and doesn‚Äôt fit the role of a shield, which should require team play around. Blitz could throw a grenade into a area to make a defender move and then rush or destroy frost traps and such that would require teamwork to destroy.
---
They're not doing it as P&amp;P with Six as GM, and we're just seeing their theatre of the mind? D:

It looks like it goes to cav

No problem

Y'all don't know... Amateurs.
---
They‚Äôre not glowing eyes it‚Äôs like a helmet (much like a skater‚Äôs), that has those two holes placed in the front. I thought that there were eyes too but if you look it‚Äôs those holes tilted down at an angle, giving it that illusion.

Recruit needs removed from the game

It is possibly Lorem ipsum but I did a post on this and almost got it taken down. I‚Äôll copy and paste the translation
---
This is sad
---
First 3 lines are just series of numbers, the 4th line ends in u.s. the 5th line has an incomplete word then ‚Äúmass‚Äù the 6th line has an incomplete word and then Lorem ipsum then dolo (I didn‚Äôt translate that one because I‚Äôm pretty sure that it has 2 letters that I can‚Äôt see). The 7th and 8th lines are relatively illegible. The 9th line is a little illegible too but the last word is ‚Äúill advised‚Äù. The final line is lorem ipsum ‚Äúdamage or devise‚Äù (not sure which).
---
While this could be Lorem ipsum, (this is a shot in the dark) his name could be placeholder.

One of them has to be a 140kg lady that is more manly than you and me together and her gadget would be politely removing you from the train or get your face smashed... politely.

Also, k√∂ttbullar shotgun is a requirement.

nice

Don't ruin it

What are you talking about? I made this.

Yes?
---
Yea the site

They‚Äôre also pretty intimidating

It fits. They mentioned in the high-res wallpaper how "Dane and Vigil do a cat-and-mouse chase..." or something like that.

He's fine, he just can't upload at the moment.
---
Ya don't say
---
Still suprised that OP still hasn't given up
---
Doesn't seem to stealrh
---
That looks like the kind of guy who'd bring a hammer to a gunfight. 
---
Glaz already has a high damage DMR. what more do you want? Echo on the other hand has a gun with a lot of recoil, so has to be balanced with a strong gadget.
---
Not a form of sas it‚Äôs our special forces, we have our sasr which are based on the original sas and do most of the same stuff and then we also have special forces commandos as well. 
---
I would very much appreciate if Ubi put everything you just said in the game

I upload clips off my PS4 to my YouTube and then screen-record off my YouTube on my iPhone then upload it to reddit ü§óü•∂

I believe this was some of the original concept are for vigil. 
---
mozzie is a guy

Got my first black ice at level 40 on the camrs and nothing since a year later
---
The ability to shoot through miras, higher damage bolt action?
---
Thankfully, bc that gun would suck in Siege. 
---
Twitch is the youngest wow
---
Fuck, they really should picked better names.
---
Australia explain
---
Yeah it‚Äôs probably frowned upon 
---
What if he's a 1 armor 2 speed while stock is unfolded and 3 speed while folded?
---
I never give up (although this post is severely under-voted compared to the others so idk if it‚Äôs still worth it Cx)
---
He obviously has a booter and just hits off the server whenever he‚Äôs about to loose. I‚Äôve seen it a few times. Doesn‚Äôt count as a win or a loss and you everyone gets kicked so the whole game was just a waste of 45 minutes. You just get a ‚Äúlost connection‚Äù pop up. 
---
Some just prefer higher sensitivities. Apex doesn't require anything specific
---
I think it's still in the game. Just start the Situation "protect hostage" (don't remember the real name)
---
ye i agree
---
When a jager main ildle picks mute
---
That would make him really weak, tbh
---
They should have some damn respect for those hostages' heroic sacrifice. 
---
Way back before they took Favela out of rotation. I was playing as Bandit on Secure area and kinda ninja my way around the map killing everyone.

There's also the MP5 and the MP5SD. And the Six12 and the Six12SD

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.
---
Please re-post your submission using standard letters.

The OP was just trying to put out an idea that is *Simple* while also helpful to Defence.
---
it‚Äôs actually Mute. 
---
Is it on wallpaper engine?
---
Yes in the interface preferences and in audio settings
---
Oh it is a wordpress site. We have our own domain [press-start.games](https://press-start.games) so we just setup a sign up form for the tournament so no one gets over looked and we can be as fair as possible. I actually designed the site still have some work to do I guess but it has come a long way since the beginning. We just found out a few weeks ago our web host is going out of business so in the near future we will have more work to do to migrate to a new host.

Bah, I still prefer to think of the Defenders as gone rogue, A-Team style!

Yeah, there's multiple links in the thread.

No, it doesn't. Please don't spread misinformation.

It gets you year 1 operators, so 8 in total. Grinding them is about 15-20h each
---
Well, 2 armor 3 speed is OP. Remember in the Beta when Fuze was 3 Armor 2 Speed? 
---
People might learn to look for information themselves
---
If you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôd like the game or not then I‚Äôd recommend starting with the Standard edition. Then if you end up really enjoying the game you can invest in some of the DLC operators.

Oh aight my bad mate

Bravely standing their ground while the fuze charge fills the room. A true hero

Thontcher and Twitch. Bullets moving pretty fast also help. And explosive balls.
---
Tower shield was actually a fan-made concept from forever ago that they included on the board. 
---
She was 26 at release I believe
---
Well... That escalated quickly
---
Yeah am i the only on that thinks that the new hibana looks garbo
---
Maybe... but that‚Äôs still pretty optimistic if you ask me.
---
True
---
I personally think Rainbow Six is based on the original 5 Rainbow plans that the US made during WW2 that laid out what to do in case of war in different scenarios. 
---
HEY FARVA...
---
neither of you are right or wrong, its all personal preference, stop being children
---
Finka is a year younger.
---
I can dream
---
I'm going to tell you the truth here. This game has to be balanced at the highest level of play. If it means changing operators that are utilized in a way that the DEVELOPERS do not intend for his playstyle, than change him or her. This is a competitive game with a large pro scene if you didn't know. Get your head out of your ass and accept change.  He's going to be useful watching choke points, which is his INTENT with his design. 
---
So it means that year 1 operators is already unlocked for me right? 
---
Abandon glitching should be fixed fast.
---
Abandon a match and don‚Äòt rejoin? Get -50 points when the match is over and you are not in it as well as a time ban. The more often you do the more the ban stacks. 
---
Just realized 
---
Yea that doesn't hurt either. 
---
The eyes higher up on the helmet with the veil makes them look bigger than they are too. Adds even more to it. 
---
I stand by what I said, this is pretty pointless.
---
Well damn
---
I bought the complete edition so I could have all ops
---
Ubis dedication to the source material is beautiful.
---
That is a balanced game 
---
Not that it matters at all, but the average age is 38. Not sure why I took the time to calculate that..
---
Why though?
---
No person would rather be alive after seeing a sight like that.
---
Now if only more Siege players acted the age of the player they were operating.
---
Wtf Jaeger is forty ?! Ash is older than twitch?!
---
IQ is 39? She looks great
---
They wear FAST helmets with a camo net over the top. It looks super cool and is great for breaking up the outline of a head, but does nothing in terms of defense. Most FAST helmets are rated at IIIA or lower, so it MIGHT stop a low-angle rifle shot at normal mid-range engagements.
---
Glaz the bush wookie? Yes please!
---
It‚Äôs always sad, no matter who is at fault.
---
Reading this mad me laug.  Thank you stranger.
---
&gt;the idea they could make it into SF in the first place
---
Why? U.S. SF does not discriminate by height anymore than their parent branches. It is usually more difficult for taller people because they are less efficient runners, swimmers, etc. Ruck marches may be tougher on small frames, but they are trivial to anyone who is a serious candidate for SF anyway. The kind of person who couldn't cut it at 5'3" wouldn't be any more fit at 6'2". 
---
You wouldn't expect to see very many from U.S. or Australia this height because our average male height is 5'10", but in countries like India, Vietnam, or North Korea SF soldiers or police specialists of this height should be fairly common. 
---
Where can you go to find this?
---
What do we think? Don‚Äôt care in the least
---
You know it brudda
---
i wish there was 6v6 mode, only so i could make memes about the six infinity recruits
---
‚ÄúBeware the old men in jobs where men die young.‚Äù
---
Wait. Isnt a low ping good connection?
---
Quality Shitpost 
---
What?
---
Does she have an Alibi though?
---
That's all well and good, Tom Clancy name gets slapped on everything, but the game themselves were realistic tactical shooters. If Ubisoft would stop advertising the games as realistic/tactical pre-release you'd have a lot less people bitching. 
---
Well no, but actually yes.
---
Didn‚Äôt they end up using this for ghost recon wildlands
---
go4 ?
---
Tower is hell.
---
What about it? There are no hit boxes
---
We should give these to Ubisoft, they‚Äôre good examples of stability 
---
I only just now noticed the eye, guess what I thought the helmet looks like... 
---
lol I forgot I did that.... It was a joke since I have too much corsair stuff
---
I use Shadowplay, and it is pretty good, I can get 4k60FPS footage with near 0 hit on my game performance.
---
Not at all, young enough to still have great bodies but old enough to have experience.
---
‚ÄúAnd he has his hammer out, we‚Äôll fu‚Äî‚Äú
---
This is why I‚Äôm really not looking forward to the new reworks year. 
---
It is, the point of camouflage isn‚Äôt to hide you it‚Äôs to make you look less human shaped so people won‚Äôt react as quickly because their brain is looking for a human shape
---
Cav is only 29? Huh
---
Like others said, looks like concept art for Vigil. If you zoom in on his chest you can even see the South Korean flag.
---
I can relate. I remember throwing a Kaid Electro Claw at a reinforcement. But before it electrified the wall, a Mute started placing his jammer down. I got my Electro Claw off the wall right before it electrified it. Mute didn't even notice.
---
My will is not my own
---
If you had my dad growing up, he would seem totally normal
---
Baby Mute
---
I want him to have a throwing knife as a piece of equipment 
---
Gridlock is the big female
---
You're forgetting the fact that being THAT short means a massive disadvantage when it comes to strength. Someone that size simply cannot lift or carry as much as their taller peers. They are a liability. If being tiny was ideal for soldiering like you claimed earlier, militaries wouldn't prefer people who are 5'8 and above.
---
Absolutely thanks

I know

I highly doubt ubisoft gives enough of a shit do :(

I knew you needed moar now there¬¥s enough for a recruit rush
---
Castle makes quite a bit of sense, think of the teamwork involved with his barricades. Without working together, they easily screw over the team. When I myself play Castle I often adopt a leadership role and people plan strats around my barricades. Fuck Doc though, all he knows is how to drug himself up and spawn peek 
---
this is why i left this game for apex üò¥üò¥
---
Black Ice with Thermite on Yacht. I somehow managed to drop 13 in a casual when I was like level 10 lol.
---
It'd probably be better to color both sides so it's more even don't you think?
---
Recruit?
---
Doc should be "This operator holds a cross up as self defense"
---
So any particular reason?   
---
The text box is there so you can explain your opinions.  Please explain.
---
The shield idea is sick. Fuze would actually be viable as a 2 speed but i‚Äôd hate him to be one when people use his shield. Don‚Äôt make it count for Blitz, though. Him being a 2 speed makes him easier to kill. 
---
Lol Valk looks like she's boutta bash Bucks head in with that cam
---
I did and got tkd
---
Pretty sure she‚Äôs been this way since she was introduced.   Whenever I place two windows side by side, one is always a few inches above the other and it kills me
---
Just wait until your 35. You get the mind of a 20 year old and the body of a 40 year old. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** Sledge4Life! ^(hug)
---
I mean I get it, the kanal one actually looks promising. At least in the quick description they gave. That map is basically just two buildings, no reason to care about one if the objective is in the other, just pay attention to the windows and hold the connector to stop the rotate back. So that needs changed, hopefully it works.
---
The Kafe teases already look like a more playable map. They need to make some changes to allow attackers and easier time to enter, but top floor defense doesn't seem to have only 2 or 3 spots to hold anymore. I think the new map design team is much more coherent about map layout than the previous one.
---
Yeah that's called placing it badly... You generally either want it at standing height or crouch height and vaultable (on a soft wall).
---
Jackal has aged incredibly well. He looks 15 years younger than Capitao.
---
Why would you do that now when someone messes up you can't spam thanks/nice one
---
I wouldn't hold your breath. This would be an extremely low priority.
---
LMAO this is probably one of the dumbest comments I've ever read on reddit. Put that one into perspective- holy fuck.
---
No need to be rude
---
IQ isn‚Äôt a Pawg 
---
I mean, true, the G8 at least kinda makes sense as to why it has the recoil it does, while the Scorpion is a 9mm that shoots like a .50.
---
I am *Spartan*...1337
---
Fuze looks like he is hugging the wire
---
I can't tell if she's better or worse than my normal teammates, considering she at least went for a revive. 
---
Yea the first one is immediately once it starts pretty much and easy to miss. But if you watch the feed it‚Äôs his name on all 5.
---
I think that is concept art for Vigil, if you look closely, you can see the South Korean flag

He's won 158 protect hostages tho?

Punish players for having good internet! In seriousness that‚Äôs stupid the low ping is a good thing it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone it‚Äôs not their fault your ping is high.
---
Lol
---
Would it shoot like a .50 since the desert eagle in game seems to have no ads recoil even though it's a .50 caliber pistol. Which most of the pistols are in the game which is why I only like the M1911's and revolvers since I compensate for recoil like I have in every game. The scorpion more shoots like a 20mm round going off Ubisoft's logic of recoil.
---
Link is from u/PCandCG you need to have wallpaper engine to run this, but it's totally worth the price on Steam!
---
I refuse to believe this. Thatcher was 57 when the game came out in 2015. Then they removed the year the ops were born. Kaid is 58 as of him being added in 2018. That means thatcher would be 59 by now, making him the true oldest operator. 
---
#JusticeForThatcher 
---
Doing it on the d-pad wouldn‚Äôt be fluent enough IMO
---
Well wouldn‚Äôt make much sense that special units take hostages, who are not terrorists. But this is the first thing that I encountered from Ubisoft that just screams, IT‚ÄòS A SIMULATION!!
---
University not college (Mute) 
---
I know but I don't know where else to put it. I just think they should implement it.
---
You may be thinking of Rook. He‚Äôs pretty young.
---
Does it need a lot of ram ? My pc is not the best and I have no fooking  clue about things like this. Thanks in advance ^^

Yeah, as much as people love that friendly fire makes you really think about your shots when pushing with teammates, it leads to a lot of trolling too. The lower levels are especially bad.

why dont you go tell the people getting peeked in pro league that....have you considered that it is not player skill.
---
Doc should have the acog removed because being able to juice up and run out on people is stupid, and not really what the op was made to do. Removing all acogs is dumb, but for rook and doc, it 100% makes sense.
---
Any way to download this?

Finally some one with a bit of sense.

They‚Äôre a branch of the SAS, like Lion and Finka are CBRN (A sub branch of GIGN)

SAS stands for Special Air Service.. SASR stands for Special Air Service Regiment. A regiment is literally a sub branch...

This is clearly the Helghan Op, not Danish.

Eh not necessarily true.  Look at that navy seal who became a doctor and is potentially going into space as an astronaut at 35.  Granted, that's an extreme case.

definitely miss it =[

Those games are competitive in their own rights. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever got high heart rate, sweaty palms and arm pits from any of them other than siege. 
---
Now forgetting about respawns, those maps I mentioned are terrible. The reason people ‚Äúloved‚Äù the Halloween house was purely for alpha packs trying to get bandits skull headgear. Other than that no one liked it. 
---
You can‚Äôt even get out of docks spawn if you spawn there. There‚Äôs no counter play to any of these maps which makes them not fun.

Recruit rushing died with the dinosaurs. Getting pally with the opposite team to get a group photo taken is laborious.

This is why they dont talk about area 51. Aliens never stood a chance. 
---
I guess those nerfs really got him down ;-;
---
Maybe that was their vision for his rifle before they added the thermal scope. But his thermal scope is a very strong gadget. It's not flashy like other operator gadgets. it allows you to see people in places where a sight like an ACOG or a Holo wouldn't. That's its power. If we increased the damage it would become extremely OP. Let's say you get one shot through smoke with a body shot, from 100 to 0 I'm talking about. That's not fun. The other player can't fight back, because he had no chance, he got one shot by a body shot. There was a time where Glaz was like this believe it or not. It was when he first got the Thermal scope. I remember playing against it. it was not fun, let me tell you. Site takes revolved around Glaz fragging through smoke. Defense couldn't fight back, because they would get picked off before they had a chance to fight back. He was the meta. Again, this was great balancing change for him because it forces him to stay back, while still not being useless. 
---
Its amazing how many people don't realize this.
---
Oohhh that makes sense 
---
There is.
---
There are a lot of OPs in the game 30-50. Seems legit that they might not even know where the silent button is. = p
---
Isn't ela 31?
---
Stop using the spear try the lmg u will like

YYYYEEEEESSSSSS DANISH FROGMAN CORPS

It makes me wonder what age they will be when Ubisoft is done adding ops to the game. And when the game becomes old will they technically be like 70-80 years old because they age with the game? Just something random to think about.

I know what you mean. When I used to play on xbox I used my elite controller with paddles and 100-100-90ads tons of people accused me of using mnk. Mostly because I  could lean faster, actually hit my shots and flicks, and was very shakey because I have my dead zones at 0 and am naturally a shakey person. Kind of funny the first few times, but got old real quick. It's just annoying to hear people accuse you of mnk when you aren't using it, and even worse when they blame the fact they died on you practicing for months to control the high sense. This is basically the console equivalent of "he's better so he must be hacking." Sometimes people do use mnk, but it's a lot less common than you might think.

---
Their bios used to have actual birth years, but somewhere in Year 3 that was removed in favour of official ages (which are in general 2 years less than this post), placing the game somewhere in 2017. These ages however, are mostly accurate for the *Siege* Icons in *Wildlands* since that game takes place around [July 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/a9nmye/story_what_is_canon/eckyncq/).
---
Vigil is one of the odd ones, his listed age and birthdate adds up to about a year less than everyone else I've calculated. For Montagne, January 1st 2017 means he's 48 years and 2 months old, matching the official age. Vigil's birthday is in January, so on the same date he's 32 years and 11 months old. Even if you shift the date to 17th January, he's about a year younger than official age at 33.
---
Do you feel powerful yet gamer?

so what. it‚Äôs casual. people complain about joining in progress and then get upset when their game isn‚Äôt filled

---
It was a special campaign during the free weekend. Normally it requires ps plus. If that has been permanently changed now, I don't know. But back in the day when we started it did require that. 
---
&gt; yes it feels easier to aim because enemies are slightly bigger zoomed
---
It is easier. Why would it not be easier. The targets are LARGER. So they are easier to SEE and to SHOOT. That is a real thing. Nothing placebo about it. Holy shit. 
---
With the FOV change and run speed, that is a placebo. I'm not saying the enemies grow in game. I'm saying they take up more space on your screen. We have all been saying that the whole time except for you. Don't use words you don't understand, like "placebo". Makes you look like a complete moron.

I have it on other games but not r6? Is there a way to enable it for r6?

yeah you should talk to support

I play on PC but I'm told on Xbox reporting them for DM's get's them banned for a week pretty easily(not in game but their other services). I'd assume the same applies here

At no point did he make an assertion about your behavior. He told you what to do instead. Which is use your mic, and not be a gigantic asshole. 
---
Use your head for a fuckin second bud. Lets say the person you would TK is a valk. They need to get off site to set up some pretty far cams ASAP. But they need to put up their reinforcements on site. It is *their* responsibility to put up reinforcements as quickly and closely to their spawn as possible, so they can go do their job off site. If you are playing an anchor, you do not have this time responsibility. 
---
Get off the cross, we need the wood.

Oh my god lol. This is exactly why I don‚Äôt mess with people who use Doc.
---
It's alright but given that I'm in EU it's really hard to communicate in solo queue given that people aren't willing to speak at all. In my stack no problem but I still hate having finka nonetheless. For PC Idm her but console she becomes really annoying cause it's not like you can stop moving your mouse and still aim for the head with her buff on.
---
Ubisoft said they‚Äôre delaying the new season one day for every post asking on reddit. use the search function genius 
---
I did say that in his last post bro
---
God you're just off being a dick on every thread today huh
---
Yeah, I think it's implied that he‚Äôs mentally scarred from trying to escape his unidentifiable country (probably North Korea because what other country could it be), which is why he wears the mask and doesn‚Äôt speak much. My memory‚Äôs a bit wack, but I think that‚Äôs the gist of it.
---
Nomad in reality needs a Nerf.
---
She takes too much control away from the defender.
---
In the meantime, use the AK. More rounds, negligibly low time to kill, 3 shot. No need of the secondary when you have enough rounds in the primary.

I love it when the land just bends (top right)

---
Realistically that‚Äôs not gonna help them tho, they‚Äôll just get tilted or have a panic attack and just end up avoiding reinforcing all together. It‚Äôd be better to just ping them where to reinforce, but who knows sometimes people just tune out of everything when playing games.
---
Why would you give him exactly what he wants
---
On- pros suggest it, ignores acceleration. Good for reaction time 
---
However, siege is known to suffer mouse stutters in certain systems. So, if that is your issue, turn it off. 
---
Thanks for wording that in a way I felt I couldn't do. I was at the point that I couldn't be bothered, seems like they can't get it through their head that this is why our community is viewed as toxic.

---
While we are at it: The Boltons did nothing wrong! Roose was poisoned by his enemies!
---
Use your fucking head Jesus Christ. Your example is literally in my favor. You know how long it takes to put up one wall then have to rotate around site finding another singular wall? And both players have to do it, they fuck over and waste 2 people‚Äôs time. Say I‚Äôm reinforcing border armory wall, and some fuck ass comes up and reinforces the other one. Now I have to rotate all the way to fountain and reinforce again **and so does the teammate** instead of having one of us go fountains and one go armory. 
---
It wastes so much more time reinforcing one and one. So now that valk has to run across the site and has to delay gadets EVEN MORE. AND I DO TOO. So yea, no time for idiots like that.
---
Depends.
---
Some squads don't communicate, but Never bring out cancer ops, even if the enemy brings them. Some have persona rules to not promote cancer.
---
I don't play lion and BB and Dok, but I do play finka, especially when the day has been trash and siege isn't going much better either.
---
I put a bandit battery down and destroyed all of them and I got tk‚Äôd
---
Doc and Mira are the same age.
---
I'm not sure how to feel about this.
---

Fuck it dude she still thicc 
---
How do you make your crosshairs black and white like that?
---
It happens surprisingly often. I'm just trying to clear barbed wire and gadgets, and clear the room for faster entry. I clearly tell them I'm fuzing. They wait for me to plant the fuze, and then start running in as I detonate it. They're fine doing everything else, I swear they're doing it on purpose to sully Fuze's name further.
---
How it's possible to animate a wallpaper?
---
Jackal looks really good for 51
---
Yeah ubi pulled a sneaky on us
---
stop posting these. nobody cares
---
how big she is 
---
Lmao 
---
No need to be like that, it‚Äôs just a question, calm down.
---
I actually agree with you. As a Finka player and someone who's had finkas in His squad, I haven't had a problem, but I don't see why recoil control should exist.
---
Recoil control is a skill and muscle memory. It is mastered over hours of gameplay. Operator abilities should affect that which we cannot control, like ADS time and reload. But not recoil. That stuff is personal.
---
I feel like this post took a lot more effort than a simple google search for the answer to your question. Next time try that first before wasting our time.
---
Deckard Pain!
---
Too old to change my entire personality and become a motivated and driven person 
---
You are right. But.. I will say she is also an ABSOLUTE UNIT. (BIGGEST unit currently) which is kinda.. strange? Idk. 
---
not when you can 2 tap with the torch (first blow in on the 3rd plank up, then on the 6th plank up)  on the door and have a free silent entry crouch walk through the door without breaking it.
---
Some of us don‚Äôt have the money though. But I do agree that it would be hard to do. 
---
u/xXBrajkXx has been removed from match

The point is we just need him to thank that our internet just fucked it and that we had nothing to do with it so that he would stop abusing us.
---
Mouse wheel up and down for the rapid tactical crouching

I wasn‚Äôt even mad, usually I get +/- 15 but I got -1üòÇ

R6 is a game of memers being memes, and sweaties being sweaty
---
There is no in between if you are a community member
---
So either have fun memeing or embrace the toxic
---
I don't stim myself so I can get the easy points by stimming a teammate.
---
Seems like putting him up for adoption might be the best option ngl.
---
For me I use either shift or control. Because I use prime less I put it as z. But if you don‚Äôt like that idea then you can set it as mouse 4/5 if you have one of those mice
---
Same thing has happened to me and it‚Äôs one of the reasons I quit ranked on siege. It‚Äôs useless to keep trying every season when this is a reoccurrence. 
---
 üëÅÔ∏èüëÖüëÅÔ∏è
---
Neither am I to be completely fair. 
---
No worries whatsoever. 
---
I‚Äôm happy for you 
---
Sometimes if you start to throw a frag then cancel, the detonation timer still ticks and it explodes. It's a known bug
---
Honestly I wish it was still burst. I thought it was cool to have a gun locked into burst.
---
Yeah, but it's still frustrating to go against five diamonds
---
Also, honestly, if you REALLY wanna go to an extremity, like his actions are getting seriously out of control that you guys can‚Äôt handle, threaten a juvenile detention center and maybe have a couple cops scare the living daylights out of him? My parents did that when I was 15 (extremely out of control, throwing stuff at my parents, literally throwing punches, etc). 
---
Honestly when it comes to defense i don't really know
---
Damn it, you got here right before me
---
wont kill you quick but you gonna still die from it haha like the vietnam pungi sticks
---
banned for 3000 hours
---
This is u/Thicc-Goblin 's perspective
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal
---
Hmm, and so you have the year one and starter operators you said?
---
But The Lord Tachanka should be as old as time itself right?
---
Yes my parents sat down with him multiple times.
---
My parents won't listen to me. I've told them that he needs a psychiatrist. There's a stigma on mental health in my country. I personally see a psychiatrist behind my dad's back.
---
Beige don't age
---
F
---
Tbh the guy spinning around is the worst part, that‚Äôs just being a sore loser
---
Who are the Canadian ops? 
---
Honestly them being fairly old makes sense. You're not gonna find a lot of young people with the skills and experience that something like Team Rainbow would require.
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt even realize until the very end, I just thought i was playing bad üòÇ
---
If they add invisible ops this game dies.
---
Sadly happens too often when I'm playing Bandit or Kaid :(
---
A poor Mute or J√§ger will set up their gadgets onto a wall or in barbed wire while I'm deploying mine, or I just don't see it before it's too late. Makes me a feel so bad :(
---
Great work man, this is really interesting.
---
What country do you live in? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking of course. 
---
Yeah! I didnt win ONCE!
---
Smh my head with these false titles
---
I never argued against anything. But good try
---
Who cares? I'd much rather have a bug or actual issue with the game be changed, not a couple of things with a helmet on one op
---
Does kaid and his beer belly look peak performance to you?
---
At some point why not has ban and recruit as an option.  Recruit one defender to attack and visa versa 
---
I honestly think r6 home screen animations going over time
---
Would you mind doing me your gt? It‚Äôd be cool to play with you
---
And yes I was solo 
---
That is true for even up to 15 min after the person left and longer if the person stayed or touched said object for a extended time. The shoe print part is not as well effective in real life but it kinda works. If the persons was wearing slippers and stood in one place for awhile haha.
---
If halo releases a good game that would be insane
---
They may add something like he can't use weapons while invisible or something. Cause yeah that'd be OP I think.
---
Wasn‚Äôt this concept art for Vigil??
---
Jackal 51!? What?! He looks 30. 40 max
---
Good idea. I don't know whether or not it'll work in my country, but I'll suggest that to my parents. Just bring to police officers to have a word with him and that if he gets another complain they'll throw his ass into juvie.
---
&gt; My parents did that when I was 15 (extremely out of control, throwing stuff at my parents, literally throwing punches, etc). 
---
Were you just a prick or did you have psychological issues?
---
Jordan :(
---
Yeeeees
---
Given how he seems to be a fan of Soviet era weaponry (in the Outbreak cinematic, he was cruising though EBay looking for *more* guns) his age totally makes sense
---
This needs to be posted in other subs, his video game addiction is not relevant to Siege dedspite it being the game he plays the most.
---
You will get better help in subs like /familyadvice
---
I wish you the best, and your parents should really get help if they cant handle a kid who plays too much video games.
---
Try forcing hobbies on him? Soccer/basketball
---
Again no one here will give you the advice you need, the issue is beyond R6 
---
Well i looked up their birthdates and took it from there. The ages are how old they would be irl. I realise some ages in game in the bios say different things but that's probably because the game doesnt have the same time as us. I'm not a 100% sure these are all correct but i do think they are.
---
I thought so too. It's really, ***really*** unusual to see a big corporation like Ubisoft open themselves up to legal issues by using non-licensed artwork.. So there must be a pretty interesting story at the end of this with a really simple reason behind it.
---
Correct
---
Capitao be 3 Speed while him being one of the oldest ops
---
‚ÄúBut that was some fancy shooting, you‚Äôre pretty good‚Äù
---
We shut this shit down, clowns, can I get a witness?
---
Yep 
---
Turn that frown upside down
---
I really hate that bitch. 
---
I got a -50% renown ans a 30 minutes ban because i went afk... un casual. Ans I wasn't even afk
---
Replace ‚ÄúAsh‚Äù with ‚ÄúSweaty Smurfs‚Äù and you know the reason why I drink.
---
By drug dealers that would burn you alive inside a pile of tires.
---
You're right.I'm posting to other subs but I need to wait for 10 minutes before I do that.
---
He goes to the gym and hangs out with friends/relatives. Doesn't seem to be helping. Especially not the gym because it makes stopping him harder.
---
Thank you so much!
---
You could play with the dlc operators until then? You could probably afford several with renown by then if there arespecific ops you‚Äôre itching to play as

Once I was outside my front door smoking a cigarette and heard a sound that sounded unbelievably similar to Fuze‚Äôs ability, it happened three times in short succession. 
---
I threw the cigarette and ducked behind my door so quickly that when I realised what happened all I could do was laugh. 
---
Fuze is actually good. Ak is a top 5 AR imo, has access to the best pistol, his gadget is very versatile at flushing out defenders
---
I can honestly say my time playing Goldeneye 65 multiplayer inspired me a little.
---
You are most welcome. :)
---
He becomes the Chariot, I like it!
---
Beslan school siege???
---
Yeah the Attackers would have real Sledge and defenders would have Sledge lite.  It works fine in Overwatch and Apex.
---
üî•
---
I knew it. Considering in the animations, ash and tachanka were on the same team
---
Yeah, Siege is hopefully going to give some space to the lesser known special forces of other countries next year.
---
I hope they‚Äôll add Sweden‚Äôs SOG next year (‚Äòcause I‚Äôm Swedish, of course), but I‚Äôm content that my brother Denmark‚Äôs J√¶gerkorpset gets the spotlight instead. 
---
oh
---
You would always have someone protecting your flank.
---
Thermite and Thatcher need another pair of bronosexuals on the attacking team to share their special bond with.
---
IKR
---
Same person you told not to cheat in online games a few replies below
---
GO GO POWER RANGERS
---
I believe you‚Äôre correct since it makes no sense for CTUs to engage in real fire fights. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all a training simulation
---
Just because they have engaged in counter terrorist operations, does not make them a CTU. Almost all SF have had to do some counter terrorist work in the past decade, so labeling them differently is pretty stupid.
---
Mute is 25, not 27

Hello EaterofSecrets, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/atnxvt/outbreak_20_confirmed_glitch_in_live_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yes personally Valk is the thiccest (also Nomad because she uses Valk's body model)
---
Yeah why the hell don't the bars start at 0? The names didn't have to be ON the bars, they could have been beside them, it just distorts everything if the bars start at -500k to -1m.
---
might be a stupid question but what purpose would defensive ops have 
---
I just thought it was a cool clip so I gave it that caption. I know it took a long time to set it up but the tap was definately worth it.
---
I don't like Mozzie. Gridlock is pretty cool. Mozzie is one of those OPs who is making this game go downhill. 
---
it says he got an extra 600 with the season pass
---
Ah. Ok.
---
It just seems impractical, and not something a trained special op would do
---
Also piddling of with the downvote, yeah?
---
But imagine having Cav-lite Recruit sneaking in to intel the hostage. 
---
Can you imagine secure versus this op lmao  *frantic searching intensifies*
---
If you slow it down, you can see that you shot each bullet around her head. Sorry mate, just unfrtunate
---
&lt;3
---
I thought they made the wooden roof thing non solid?
---
Ash is too what? üòÇüòÇüòÇSexy?.? 
---
Yeah, I'm not trying to go all "PC master race" here. It's just that as a system, the keyboard and mouse is easier to pick up quickly. 
---
I have no doubt in my mind that i would be worse on console that this Glaz. That's just how it is
---
They‚Äôll have another event according to gubisoft
---
That symbol appears whenever you have and outbreak item equipped
---
Defending VIPs and Important Assets in dangerous areas 
---
Mozzie is strong af in the right hands, Gridlock can shut down entire hallways and areas with her traps and as def you cant get past them without shooting and making loud noises, giving away your position, or taking incredibly much damage
---
Kaid has had a rough life. 
---
1F back entrance 
---
that‚Äôs real scummy
---
Nomad is the newest operator though.
---
Y‚Äôknow this is against TOS **and** subreddit rules?
---
Ah yes, our favorite spaghetti man.
---
Absoulute MADLAD.
---
How!? I've been trying to imagine a scenario where a barbed wire gets the kill , BUT I CAN't?! wth !
---
It can still be a weapon charm
---
I United you, my guy.
---
Also, the element of surprise.
---
You come charging at some dues with full riot shield.
---
They are like oh shit, lets cap this fool.
---
They can‚Äôt hit you.  They run in terror.
---
You turn around, your pint sized companion dumps a shell in um.
---
You turn back around while he reloads.
---
It‚Äôs perfection.
---
Maybe for a special halloween event?
---
Enter
---
What a babe
---
But it‚Äôs also what Denmark‚Äôs special forces look like
---
Year 3? No, not anymore.
---
Dope as hell
---
Didn't know that. Sorry. I'll take it down
---
Haha no worries man Siege can be a scary and confusing game at first. We‚Äôve all been there. Lesion is very popular so I‚Äôm sure there are people who play him that aren‚Äôt very good. But when used correctly, he‚Äôs without a doubt the most versatile defender. I recommend looking up some Lesion guides on YouTube for beginner and advanced tips 
---
Get a real job lol.
---
For the Halloween event they would get Dr. Evil and Mini Me costumes.
---
What if he just sees your comments at the bottom of every post he looks at?
---
He's probably not following your shitey posts, he just sees you being a bit of a prick.
---
That's a glitch
---
Selfish
---
but the test servers are going to three weeks now
---
I just saw someone else post the same thing (but different video. I'm not saying anyone stole anything). It was the same window and with blitz. I wonder if it's just a blitz at this specific window thing? 
---
doesnt finka flirt with tachanka
---
i‚Äôll explain it for them. you missed. plain and simple. git guud 
---
Tbh it should be the new ranked
---
Wow
---
ZA WARUDO - nice touch haha
---
This is untrue, most special ops are young, like under 25 years old young. While there are plenty of older guys they tend to be in admin positions and not go on missions.
---
27k for a headgear...

Because he‚Äôs a Maestro main.

I thought cav was way older than 29

How do you get the _____ main next to ur name

it would be a severe disadvantage. in a game with one shot headshots, accuracy is key and there is no accuracy with dual wielding

WHAT?! :o
