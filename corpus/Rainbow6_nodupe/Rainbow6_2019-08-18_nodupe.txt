They are satisfied until you stop picking her and pick someone else instead, that's their balancing principal.
---
---
---
Place her gadget in crucial windows for the objective and roam using her impacts to surprise people. Also, use the pocket shotgun to create murder holes or open hatches for you or your teammates.
---
Its a good drawing but the eyes are freaking me out
---
How much? Lol
---
Idk if anyone noticed this but on the back of his neck there is a scar that might be from some sort of gas or just some sort of burn
---
Gib me the Lord
---
And Kriss Vector has no Acog. Otherwise, this is an imbalance, given for Mira.
---
Exactly! He looked so lost..
---
Gay maestro?
---
Thx dude
---
Wait no please nooo
---
Smok
---
Fuck yeahhhhh
---
I hope you know this has been posted 100 times since phantom sight came out
---
A bullet to the head is how you counter any operator
---
lmao yasss queen
---
It does don't know why u are getting down votes
---
Hey what’s going on guys it’s your boy Braction
---
Clash is best op
---
 @ u/Krallorddark i agree with tachankadank and warden BUT with warden i disagree with the rook thing because i see that as op if all of his team is able to see trough the smoke flashbangs etc and the part where it can be aqquried by wearing them i however totally agree with the speed change and IMO i prefer the MPX to the p90 just because i feel like the p90 isnt really that good neither is the mpx i just prefer it TBH the slit thing is a no from me cause i feel like its a bit op at higher ranks which could make you say "but its not only used at higher ranks" which i get BUT they have to make it so its not too OP in pro league aswell but i fully agree with the drone blocking concept etc i also feel like it should take more hits to destroy it etc

Seems pretty normal to me. Try the higher graphics pack or whatever it's called on steam.
---
I don't understand Kapkans elite uniform. All the spetsnaz boys are from alpha group, not vympel. And Kapkan was 10 years old when the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.
---
Cool knife dance though. 
---
5/10
---
W-1 and C-2 for sure, having warden be a 2/2 would make him comparable to Mute and Smoke on defense. Having Castle Barricades extend all the way down would be more useful during the early game while also being better for the attackers since they won't have their feet shot.  
---
As for Tachanka, I'd like to see him given access to sights on his turret, that would make him a lot easier to use at longer ranges.
---
Kaid, Sledge, and Blitz look best in my opinion
---
Nice
---
r/lostredditors
---
Ok.
---
I'm pretty sure we have different definitions of "western wall"
---
Naw it's console to get to play you need m&amp;k /s
---
You shouldn't get R6 credits as the whole point of elite skins is so people can only get it if you pay for it.
---
[deleted]
---
I thought you could change up easily. They should still do it to at least waste their time.
---
How is it bad?
---
That Nora-Rengo skin is 👌
---
Amazing
---
I actually waited 2 hours because after 99:59 it goes back to 00:00
---
gotta get diamond i guess man
---
ok will do but i wont have evidence as it dosent say
---
Don’t forget the Kriss Compact SDP9.
---
it looks so weird and unnatural. even his hair is like flush with his mask. he got thiccer tho
---
There is,  you just have like a fingertip worth of flour so you have to improvise with dust, weeds and neighbouring children.
---
Well it was an important lesson, now wasnt it?
---
There are ops other than recruit? Are those what those little pictures are?
---
People are stupid
---
What balancing does bb need?
---
Mmk is fine, if you use it on PC or against people who are also on mnk.
---
I was level 12 at the time I had no idea.
---
At best he could do with some quality of life improvements, or maybe an extra primary option.
---
Being able to deploy and remove his own barricades faster would be convenient without being overly powerful, and his gadget is situational and passive enough that he probably doesn't deserve to have the worst SMG and the worst semi-auto shotgun as his primary choices.
---
I honestly don't understand the operator choices. Most of them either have elites, Pilot Program Phase 1 skins or both. Why not pick an operator who lacks any premium cosmetics? Capitao? Jackal? Zofia?  Castle? Ela? I don't get it. I was excited for this program but now I can't see myself getting more than 1 or 2 of these.
---
Interesting, don't know much about MIBR, are they big like maybe tier 2 org etc?
---
Not using weapons but by hitting him using either of these two
---
Give bandit the long flowing locks he deserves!
---
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE r/angryupvote
---
It’s not really one of the best though. Not in the top five at least.
---
I was level 12 at the time, I had no idea.
---
you don’t need to buy it to see it
---
INFIRMUS
---
Yes i agree with you on that but copy and pasting guns can create major problems in terms of balancing. If you take castle for instance a pot of people find him weak and in theory buffing his gun a bit could make him a better option but in buffing the ump you indirectly buff pulse as well, an operator that clearly doesn't need a buff.
---
Theme park bad
---
From what i have seen mnk isn’t the greatest on console
---
Frenchy ping pong grandmaster strikes again
---
And people say Elite skins don't match with their ops...
---
THIS IS WHY PLAGUE DOCTOR SMOKE CAN'T BE A THING, PEOPLE!
---
His Elite looks so bad (not the drawing, just his elite in general)
---
I love green tea and was drinking green tea at the time. So you be the judge.
---
/r/tea
---
Now this is some dumb ass shit.
---
Go to play, ranked, R3, then use the numbers to cycle over
---
It’s great! I love it so much. The red looks really good
---
wait dokkaebi has frags? heck yeah!
---
Beautiful work my friend. Perhaps if you were a supreme clash main like myself, such wonderful plays may be more frequent?
---
An arm and a leg.
---
Great job literally copying and pasting my Facebook post lmao
---
Arthur Morgan is that you?
---
What is love ? Maybe wont hurt me
---
IQ looks so happy too
---
Wtf, this is fucking dumb.
---
I run on attacker Thermite, Nokk, Maverick, and Jackle. On defense I run Warden, Mozzie, and sometimes frost
---
Because the teams doesn't care what cosmetics the ops have? They just pick the ops that they feel they use the most.
---
If you’re Irish...
---
So did you copy and paste this from your other response. I've already answered everything you've said how? Or no? Or no not entirely. You're wrong. I probably have a better kd and rank than you if you really feel that entitled to say that matters. Even though I likely do since I'm not someone who ignores stats. Because stats make a weapon. Attachments do add on to weapon but they don't make a weapon. They add on to it to make it better in some way or form. The FO-12 like every shotgun requires you to close the gap with your enemy. If you try to fight long range you will loss as the damage drop off, shotgun pellet render distances. The inability for shotguns to headshot, as well as recoil management becomes too much for a shotgun to compete. It can't and it won't. It is literally impossible for it to do so. You've said the thing with the Scorpion that it's CQC and requires skill to close the gap with your enemy. You said that yourself. Yet shotguns are all exactly like that. Please give me a stat, any bit of evidence showing a shotgun beating someone with an assault rifle past 20 meters. When they're both on full health as well. You won't find it because it's impossible unless the enemy is that fucking stupid. It can't out gun, it can't out range any weapon that shoots bullets. It's a shotgun shooting buckshot. It needs CQC to be effective. It does very average damage for a shotgun. Much less than most of them. It has somewhat better ranges than them for mid range. But long ranges the FO-12 falls behind all of its counterparts asides a very small few. The Super Shorty being the only shotgun coming to mind that does less damage than the FO-12 at ranges. Your argument debunked itself. I've stated it time and time again saying exactly what you've said. Exactly how you fucked your own damn argument over. Stats make a weapon, attachments may add onto it. That's  fact. Another fact being all shotguns require skill. They need to close the gap which requires skill. Every shotgun does and until you show proof asides from words. If you can show me how the FO-12 negates every single stat and proof the game has shown us, testing of years. Please I will take everything back. But I know you won't. You haven't shown anything. You haven't said anything that even gives any remark of how it's so overpowered and requires no skill. Yet it does because guess what? It shoots fucking buckshot. A shell that disperses.  Like every single other shotgun it losses damage as the pellets spread and less hit. And at ranges the pellets become so far spread apart that guess what, your damage is so miniscule it'll feel like just a little prick. It does have recoil. Every precious youtuber who showcases the gun, shows recoil. The stat cards show a nice bit of recoil. In game it has a nice bit of recoil. Because I don't know if you know this. But any gun shooting and ranges has a fair bit of recoil. Admit you lost, because you did a long long time ago. As well to that saying a gun needs to shot more preciosely and slower at ranges proves a lot. It proves that guess what, a shotgun that has heavy recoil to begin with. Can't spam fire. Your argument is in shreds my friend. It's very sad to see how close minded you are to think opinion without any proof or evidence to back it up would trump any kind of facts especially ones created by the dev team and the very hard dedicated community who test these weapons non stop. I pity you truly, I hope one day you can actually get past screaming at people for providing valuable information that instantly has destroyed your arguments. I don't want to call you AOC so please don't embarrass yourself.
---
Thanks !
---
I'm fine with a controller. I like the lessened recoil. I'm a casual gamer and frankly if you want to use MnK quite being a right cunt and buy a PC, quit messing with my games just cuz you can't win
---
He sucks
---
Also if you look at the chemical compound it looks like his logo/ icon
---
His nose is a penis. Stop body shaming.
---
I wonder if they changed how he looks with the Halloween headgear with his face burned off.
---
mosquitos don’t dress up as college students
---
An elite controller just has the paddles though right? I have a thing for my controller that gives it those but you have to have it plugged into the Xbox.
---
I know but it has a lot of goddamn recoil and I’m trash. I found that most of the kills I got were inside the shotgun’s range, so I switched to the FMG to get som more range, which is working out pretty well.
---
Easy way to play against diamonds.
---
Dang I want to possess this talent as well :(
---
I get this all the time
---
Haha, I noticed you man. Gave me a good giggle
---
That’s the point I gave up on rank cuz of boosters
---
Dropping on my birthday, I can already feel the money leaving my wallet :(
---
Thank you
---
“We” has no ppl in que w 🤡🤡
---
The devs won’t touch him, he is *supposed* to be the community joke, even the devs know that
---
I... I like this change. For ops with frag nades means for fun for everyone
---
This has literally happened to me
---
I’ve seen a couple fanarts of BlitzxConq and ValkxValk around. I can try to find the artist if you want, or if anyone else might know more artist who’ve done stuff like that

Bandit empire skin POGGERS
---
I will never unsee that
---
Just like recruit. Alas.
---
Because goobisoft disbanded the party when I restarted my game trying to escape i play w 2 other ppl
---
The thing is, ubi was able to obtain the license for the guns prior to phantom sight, but since ubi has what, 80+ guns in the game, they have run out of guns that they were able get the licensing rights for. Ubi has run out of guns that they can very easily obtain the rights for, and now have to work much harder to obtain the license to use the gun.
---
How long did you have to watch to get one
---
Hahaha! Poor Spacestation. No one will ever see the skin outside of casual with Echo on perma-ban status right now.
---
Secure servers, hit reg, shields.
---
next up as u cant kill bombers  flash or smoke grenades i will use sledge's hammer. deal?
---
220 points every round, fuck yeah
---
each of us has his own way of playing, and if you like it that way, it’s good :)
---
What about sheilds do you hate the most?
---
Yeah..
---
He looks younger :P
---
I want to get frost trap stickers to put under every operator sticker I find
---
LOL!! let's see what I can get tomorrow 😂😂
---
Gotta get that YouTube/reddit content haha
---
-220
---
Easy to do
---
This is cool? Is he a new operator?
---
I don't hate shields, I hate how shields don't block bullets half of the time.
---
I’ll be looking out for you my friend!
---
For me I'm a pretty consistent player, but I'll be inconsistent in how many kills I get, recently I dropped a 7 kill 3 death game in ranked, but other times I'll only get 4 or 5 kills
---
Yes it is! You just can't see the actual tournament. You can walk around, and even play the new ops early! We didn't get a ticket either. Just bring 7$ for parking and you're golden.
---
I think this skin is when he was younger
---
I ran a rank kd of 2.5 and solo queued to Diamond with pump actions. If you have a clue what you’re doing they can be excellent
---
~100 bucks but that doesnt stop turbo virgins from using them anyways
---
Echo ssg skin to remember redeemer
---
I know the solution . Bring Punt gun /s
---
.
---
Well ur pretty shit ppl for throwing when not in a five stack ur what makes the game bad to play
---
I think it's a problem with the feel of that sort of weapon. Sniping in its purest form doesn't really exist in this game, so it'd basically just be a shitty DMR. Like the BOSG but more infuriating both to use and play against.
---
Have you ever shot a shotgun IRL?
---
Well if you know where to park it’s free on the weekends ;)
---
I’m gold skill level at best
---
Edit: Thanks for all the support! Also I meant to say dropped!!
---
Is yours on the left or right?
---
That new shield looks sick
---
If bandit wore hair would he wear it like this? Or like this? Or maybe this? And this?
---
And against bronze or copper players ur like a god
---
Maestro if you like anchor I like echo
---
Agreed
---
Sledge, Jager, Echo. Moving on!
---
Give my girl IQ her nades back, goddammit!
---
They are fine the way they are. Shotguns should never be a meta. If they were, players with insane aim would dominate very easily. If they buff the range and damage if may become better and not op but considering how devs hadn’t I think everyone is alright with it.
---
Auto mk14?
---
Interrogate MoM
---
Maverick
---
The faze cav skin is kinda funny cause they got a interro onto empire, I think the first interro for like a year in pro play.
---
Why would adsing or not have effect on how the bullet goes if you shoot twice in the same place? Balancing. Every game is unrealistic my guy.
---
You should make this a text post, try and gain traction. This is a good idea.
---
Smoke looks.. good
---
Bearing is amazing too
---
Error
---
Glaz might want to place his crosshair a little better
---
F
---
sledge elite is one of the best though
---
I think in the end the biggest flaw with Phantom Sight is that the gadgets are near useless. Even if their guns were good, both operators would be questionable pick due to other operators' gadget just being much better option in general. 
---
People often overlook Nokk since Warden is in worse state but ultimately her gadget is only slightly better than 3 Speed Attackers crouch walking near the obj. By then, why not pick 3 Speed Attackers who have much more impactful gadget?
---
But i like it
---
If your not sure you are gonna commit just get the base. If you wanna go balls out i think the other version unlock the rest of the operators. If you like the game and stay you can unlock them in game or buy the year pass
---
my ps4:
---
honestly dude, there is no reason. i see new players asking this question every, single, fucking, day. if you can’t deal with being kicked and a toxic community then the game isn’t for you. don’t use a mic unless giving callouts, if you’re pre-pubescent then your gonna get kicked for being a squeaker. there’s nothing you can do but just play the game
---
Nope defender
---
It doesn't interest me though, it does the opposite. Love G2 for years but lately the melodrama BS they seem to create is putting me off. I have zero interest in drama.
---
I was thinking about doing that
---
Maestro - Has super cool laser turrets that are bullet proof
---
Maverick - Has blow torch that can burn through reinforced walls
---
We gonna act like that drone attempt didn’t happen thou...
---
Anyone can name gun stats, it doesn't prove shit. My scenario literally destroys all of your "evidence" and that's a fact. You literally can't disprove it. Do I need to explain it again in even more detail? And you know you've lost when you refer to the other person as "bud" or "buddy"
---
please stop talking to me, I dislike the idea of associating myself with a trash low rank negative kd fucktard. CaSe ClOsEd
---
The Biohazard CBRN is meant to be joint Ops between Spetsnaz and GIGN though.
---
lmao
---
Wow way to be that guy lol
---
wha- i was close to level 200. what do you mean, i have like 500 hours and i’m level 100. it took you that long to decide that the game wasn’t right? oh man, that’s like dating someone for 3 years then leaving them cause “it didn’t work out”
---
WHYYYYYYYYY
---
I laughed way harder than I should have😂
---
Alright bro bouta head out
---
I just watched this on your channel haha
---
𝖣𝗂𝖽𝗇𝗍 𝗋𝖾𝖺𝗅𝗂𝗓𝖾 𝗂𝗍 𝗐𝖺𝗌 𝖺 𝗅𝗈𝗈𝗉 𝖺𝗍 𝖿𝗂𝗋𝗌𝗍.
---
What, that I dont really support the proleague scene like most?
---
Its just the same people on the same maps using the same operators.  Overpaid and over hyped.  Worst part is that one team continually wallops the rest.
---
Just because i have different views than you doesnt make me petty.  It makes me different.
---
You’ll never understand the heat of Asia.
---
Huh, must be a cultural specific meme or a meme specific to those regions? I have no idea.
---
playing WoW does also help to get your fingers flexible af or start coding
---
Pretty sure its EDT but I could be wrong.
---
they complained about it over ash, because her hitbox was actually broken. the hit boxes still are broken, but that’s more server problems
---
I'd go so far as to say that pre-nerf glaz, minus smokes, would still be strong, but not the best entry in the game.
---
I think that RFF still needs a lot of work. Maybe the kill would be credited to the person who blew up the shield.
---
No G2 skin for Lion? 
---
What a disappointing ...
---
Poo poo aim
---
Great execution
---
Yup. The problem with Phantom Sight is that the ops had underwhelming gun AND near useless gadgets. 
---
The new ops look more promising so far.
---
Can i buy in store or do i have to do the ! On twitch ?
---
Incendiary deployable shield trap
---
not sure if trolling or serious...
---
Just rework the man at this stage. If an ability is overpowered by its very existence, it needs to be changed
---
I’ll give it a try I was interested in getting him I guess Ubisoft just pulled the trigger
---
How does it work?
---
Haha yeesssss!!!
---
I KNOW. This is why those clutches on here have no comments or upvotes
---
Then have it so his glasses show up on IQs scanner, which could lead to easy headshots. Have the glasses distort when shot, similar to Jackal.
---
cringe
---
Get onto Ubisoft Support? That never happens.
---
Playing the game since 2015. Maybe you got him while drunk or something and don't remember?
---
Ik I have bad aim but to silence that I just play Monty
---
butyful
---
Over paid and over hyped? So should esl just pocket the ad revenue and not share it with players in your opinion? Or should the orgs just not be allowed to pay the players? Really dont understand your point there. 
---
You can like a skin that's associated with pro league without having to be a pro league fan boy. To say it's a shame that cav has a head gear you like is a shame because its pro league relates just doesnt makensense, it doesnt actually affect you that its pro league or not.
---
I had to be really patient with him but it was worth it
---
I like monty and clash
---
I have bad aim on monty
---
Great on clash
---
I never played clash
---
seems like you can shoot it from behind to detonate it
---
Tell this to that M870 Recruit Rush that haunts my dreams
---
Bad Valkyrie. I thought you learned not to make the hostage into Rudolph.
---
She’s good if you learn the ways of clash
---
"I'm not too bad, I'm just bad".
---
🤔
---
Anyone want to mention that that person made whatever that comp game was extremely skewed
---
There are, actually. M45 MEUSOC is the official designation for that particular 1911 variant. Of course, it's a military designation and not subject to copyright.
---
Do you know if Nokk and Warden are getting any adjustments? They are in such a poor state now and with the new ops coming soon, they will join Tachanka at this rate.
---
Ah yes, 1 op is good? Buff another to make him not the best but still just as good?
---
I'm at least buying all the gun skins and charms, probably most of the uniforms too. RIP my wallet.
---
What do you play on?
---
Hello LoveLikeOxygen, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/crvij6/villa_should_be_disabled_from_ranked_pool_due_to/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
lol no i play finka and rook who never get banned but nice try
---
Terrorist Barry, that is.
---
Hahahahaha r6 is more demanding hahahahabab omg hahahahaha
---
Lions primary is a similar design to the vector except it shoots 308 rounds instead of .45 acp
---
It's just a bit blurry, apparently he runs Kaid's shotgun sniper as well
---
Cav’s ability literally shows the rest of the team where every enemy is so no it’s not
---
No, gg ez is just as spammed as gg
---
It's called Crossfader, it's a seasonal skin from operation Velvet Shell (Y2S1) meaning you can't buy it anymore.
---
I did read the comments, I got good feedback on electrified castle idea. The other two ideas were contraversial so I put them onto community vote.
---
Warden on the other hand was mostly negative so I made the flash reduction more punishing by forcing the players shake their cams to **reduce the duration of the effect** where I left out the number to your imagination/suggestions. I also made his 2/2 tweak a community vote as ppl were saying it would be a bad idea since it would reinforce the belief that ubisoft could not balance 3/1 ops. I also added the P90 as an option.
---
I tweaked tachankas ammo count as there were misunderstandings and lowered the deployable shield ancor angle from 105 to 90. 
---
I do not just read one good comment that alligns with my beliefs and take it as the definitive feedbavk. I listen to the majority of the community.
---
Deff toxic, usually tourney like that have rules against that type of thing.
---
Toxic can be defined multiple ways in siege, using mnk on console, or just even using blitz when you are up. It matters who you ask, but in reality that is on a level toxic but nothing to get upset about.
---
Because when you play the game casually, shields and jackal make the game less fun. So newer players typically ban along those lines so they can learn or enjoy the game. If your operators dont get banned why do you care? It's like literally not even a minute for picks and bans.
---
Ama get rid of it and youll gonna hear about it trash
---
It’s a CZ P-09 in Roni configuration
---
that was amazing
---
drone parkour
---
Ok thx
---
And he's 2s 2a
---
Not upset by it, toxicity is a bannable offense in this tournament, I was happy with how my team performed
---
I think I've seen this porn before
---
GodDAMN
---
Lets imagine that destiny 2 is more demanding. You can still have internet stutters on games. But if youre the only person that lagged in the engagement it is not the game. It is you
---
Yes it was in the rules which is partly why I was curious as to what the community thinks
---
What's your point
---
You’re getting 1.8% pack chances while I’m struggling to get a 50% lol
---
It's a seasonal skin from operation Velvet Shell . Costed 25K renown
---
In game yes, it's kinda funny though cause irl the para is a higher caliber weapon.
---
Would be too op and render shield ops useless unfortunately =/
---
Edit flairs
---
Don't worry, I have the same problem.
---
There are no good teammates in siege, just shitters and good coms.
---
If you’re playing this game for fun why don’t you go play casual? You can have fun in ranked but with the win is #1 priority. Probably why you’re bronze.
---
I’m pretty sure this image is already all over google but it’s still sick
---
silent step benefits herself only and there are not many times for you to interagate enemies
---
If he barely has to turn to block the c4 thats not anything to do with Monty thats just bad c4 placement. 
---
Same with Smoke, if he can just walk out with barely a scratch thats just bad gas canister placement. 
---
Against an almost dead aggressive Monty pulling put an impact should get him assuming you don’t just stand there holding it and letting him kill you.
---
And stabbing his legs and shield work its just hard.
---
You made smokes photo way better than the rest. ubi should make this the official logo
---
Longer than the rest
---
what flavor are the cookies?
---
The least effective way to share content to a subreddit
---
w-2
---
If you can't wait for 30 seconds then you shouldn't be playing this game. Hell, even in pick and ban you aren't waiting, you're (I'm assuming) deciding with your team which operators should the other team not get to play and take advantage of while finding workarounds of jot having that operator.
---
I agree. The only operator that can block headshots and shoot ads at the same time. Imagine him missing most of his shots and you hit him dead on but he kills you now, even though you deserve it.
---
I got black ice on this gun f
---
Just in ranked
---
From ranked
---
I cant wait.
---
Community vote options are options that I will only add if enough positive feedback is taken, also I will only add o e of them not.both since that would be a bit strong. The electrified castle would give sledge and zofia a good way to show themselves more too (as if they need that lol)
---
Its pretty convenient for op
---
It's the best one lol
---
IKR. Rip the vitality sledge skin 😢
---
As someone who plays Dok a lot I'm actually kinda sad about this. With Stuns you could burn an ADS, place a phone call, and throw a flash while hopping through a window for the kill.
---
That’s makes absolutely zero sense. Warden is American
---
I'll have to check but I think the shield damage indicator is glitched and doesn't show the correct info.
---
So I’m new to this game, does plat actually mean something? I’m most games plat is like actually gold and all the good players are in diamond and up. Downvote if it’s a dumb question but I’m truly curious.
---
yeah ikr
---
Welcome to the game.
---
Cross fader and Goyo the new defender can rock it!
---
Accurate
---
A more comparable analogy would be forced substitutions of a quarterback or other position.
---
I would also say, if every football game had the same plays every time.  And the same reads, and the same everything, every game played the same... people would start to not watch.
---
Also, real life players get injured, penalties, etc.  I dont see Ash getting a bad knee or Thermite busting a tendon any time soon.
---
They look cool but I kind of wish they didn’t make them stand out so much
---
I feel the same way. Either make them universal or make them cheaper, I want to support Pro League, but if they're all 600 R6C each, then it'll easily be €150+ for all the skins, and I'd rather just buy none and stick to the skins I already have than only buy a few.
---
I usually just look for nice sightlines, youll get the hang of spotting nice location
---
No new guns again, ubi just went lazy af.
---
So basically the Samsung Galaxy Note 7?
---
I personally like kaid for his ability to fully lock down floor hatches from below and keep them secure. And his shotgun is very interesting to use. His aug is weak but it’s a laser beam. Idk anything about gridlock tho.
---
I remember when I was 12.
---
good point
---
Cool stuff
---
They never said I couldn't talk about it just don't film or take pictures. Didnt sign anything. I am surprised they are not a lot more people talking about it.
---
No
---
Yeah me too I saw a few things online like their loadouts and stuff but there's been so few posts that I don't know how credible some of their info is but it's all tieing in now
---
I just hate how sometimes you don’t even have a chance. The enemy can be out on your spawn in less than two seconds on some maps while you’re still on in the open and can’t defend yourself
---
Just did that today too
---
You played with a cheater so you don't get the points for winning.
---
Basically you were boosted by cheaters but not in a bannable way.
---
If u had won, u had Cheaters in Ur team.
---
Im not saying it should be gotten rid of, just I understand why people don't like playing casual. Honestly though I pretty much exclusively play cas just because it's quicker to get renown.
---
Oh thanks mate love you!
---
In the match you were playing was a hacker, the sistem detected it and cancelled the match, i think.
---
I have been maining Jager since I started playing Rainbow. He’s a great operator, and is a must on certain sites. Personally, I like him better than Ela but it’s just a matter of opinion. I see no reason why you shouldn’t pick him up. His gadget is a set-and-forget, but the main selling point is his gun. The 416-C is easily the best gun on defense in my opinion, with stats so good it would be a good gun on attack. That’s the real convenience of playing Jager: you can play really long sightlines comfortably with his AR and not worry so much about damage drop off or recoil. 
---
I’d say give it a shot. If you end up deciding you don’t like playing him anymore than no harm was done. He certainly will feel easier to play, simply because he’s much less nuanced than Ela is, but that isn’t a bad thing. I main both Fuze and Capitao, and while Capitao is a great pick for team play sometimes I just have to play to my strengths. Fuze is 100x easier, and I’m honestly more effective because my role is simpler: rush, carpet bomb objective, then clean up the survivors with the AK. 
---
Best of luck to you, it would be nice to see a fellow Jager out there but as a Fuze main I can also say it’d be nice if you didn’t :)
---
Yeah it's frustrating when it happens but the attackers are equally able to shoot back. People that think spawn peeking is op are bad.
---
That Kaid deserves your friendship
---
Some of you, may die. But it is a sacrifice, I am willing to make.
---
No its your connection dont be rude its not the game stop looking for something to blame and face it
---
Uuhhhhhhh? Was it?
---
That’s a big boi!
---
I thought this rework is Kanal?
---
That's next season
---
ummmm its in a leak, since the same leak also contained the fact that Goyo has the vector, which is evidently true from the leaked picture of operation flaming yeet's desktop, I think the rest of the leak had a pretty good chance of being true as well
---
Absolutely unplayable
---
This Is 4 kanal is 3
---
Holy crap you’re the guy I saw doing the peek-a-boo live. Good shit man lol made me laugh
---
Glad to help
---
I love getting kills like that
---
Check my other comment I said how to
---
arent we tho
---
What?
---
I was joking
---
I  main Ela and I'll tell you this. In her current state compared to every other operators she's quite pathetic. She has the only primary in game the Scorpion, that has a random stat. Which being horizontal recoil. With it being the only primary with a random stat you're always at a disadvantage. Not to mention it doing the 3rd lowest damage out of any gun in game.
---
her pistol is just a niche really. It has a great sight, but it does the lowest damage out of all handguns and only has a fall off range of 12 meters. Which takes away a lot of advantages of the sight in the first place.
---
Ela's secondary gadgets I'll say it right here are useless. In my sense of the game Ela needs to be mobile to be good. Her weapons are very lacking in any range capabilities so she needs to be mobile and always be moving. She needs to close the gap with enemies and sneak around them to be effective in killing. As if she isn't every single assault rifle will instantly end her in the round. Yet even though she needs to be mobile she's give two stationary gadgets she can't use very much at all.
---
Her mines like every trap is very lackluster but can be used very effectively in the right situation. Not much to add there asides from it not lasting very long and compared to say a Lesion or Kapkan trap are very average in what they do.
---
Jager though has a great set of guns. The 416-C is great for all ranges and the Sorta M870 wanna be is also very good for a shotgun. Doing a decent bit of damage at all ranges until pellets derender from the game. Even more than Ela's FO-12. 
---
Jager has a well worthy secondary and can come in handy but I'd say just like most pistols shouldn't be you primary for a match. Use it if you run outta ammo in a fire fight and don't have time to reload. I don't really like it as it doesn't have recoil like most pistols and that really annoys me. But still good for spam firing.
---
His secondary gadgets pair very well with his gadget and his ability to both roam and anchor effectively. His gadget is placed in the area in or around objective. No idea why'd they be anywhere else. But his gadgets can assist with his main gadget and team or benefit him if he is to stay on objective which unlike Ela, Jager can do quite well.
---
His primary gadget doesn't have much to be said. it's amazing on objectives and will protect you and your team from oncoming throwables from the attackers. It's not inconsistent and is always useful no matter what objective. Unless it has a hatch then well, you know it'll get shot out.
---
But compared to Ela Jager takes the win any day. He has weapons tailored to all fighting ranges. Has good secondary gadgets and a worthy backup pistol. His gadget is consistent and works very well. Whilst Ela has one of the worst primaries in game the Scorpion, a very niche pistol. Horrible and pretty much useless secondary gadgets, and a lackluster main gadget. Nothing in her kit pairs well with another part unlike Jager which is a reason Ela is as bad as she is currently in the game. Nothing pairs in her kit, and she's very lackluster in her usefulness. Her shotgun is good but like every unslugged shotgun has very bad range problems. I'd pick Jager if you wanna main someone but Ela is fun. Pick Jager in a competitive sense but pick Ela for a fun and good time if you're good with her. She's very fun to play and that's what I love about playing her. I can have a bit of fun most of the matches I play. But she's not competitive like her counterparts or ever Jager.
---
It's your choice bot those are my own thoughts.
---
I saw an enemy drone staring and jumping at the objective and it never registered lol
---
Ah
---
Agreed idk why people dont like his automatic gun it's so easy to control
---
TaCHUNKa
---
That's me! Lol 😂
---
Cool.
---
Also, do you HAVE to shoot it to make it go off? Kinda sucks that you have to be in line-of-sight of it.
---
It'd have been dope if it was also proximity based and automatically went off when an attacker vaulted over it.
---
The lord has a name its tachanka wait now that think of it can you use his shield to bounce c4s?
---
Underrated post sofar
---
Thanks for the reply man. I dont understand the problem with the defender, flames do hurt, only he is immune and he only has one drone so if it gets destroyed to early his entire gadget is gone.
---
On the other hand, the attacker i kinda agree with. Maybe bump down the range or remove gadget spotting, i posted this so i can get feedback and make less balancing mistakes on my next ops.
---
Any explosive will set it off
---
And anyone anchoring could just shoot it
---
I'm more excited for the operators, it's questionable if they improve Theme Park or not, *Hereford*
---
its all good until they display the name of the team on skin! instantly loses its value given not many care for the team themselves and watch it for entertainment and also pro gaming scene is volatile as fuck, any non-gigantic org could get dissolved at any point
---
All g.
---
And he's a 2-2, right?
---
Roaming with the Vector gonna be lit.
---
Licensing clearly isnt the issue as barely any of weapons have actual trades on them.
---
Ok thanks
---
There's also a shelf one in Tower.
---
The test server is not open at the moment. You can use certain ops in situations but other than that theres no other way to play the ops.
---
That’s just seems like the intention of a racist comment.
---
You probably just had a bad game. Shit happens here and there lol. Can't give up that quick
---
Finally I can now support SSG in every game by putting they're charm
---
A fellow man of culture I see
---
Email them about it, he needs to be banned
---
Then do you know when the test server will be online?
---
I like to cheat because I’m better when I’m cheating. What’s your gt/psn name?
---
It Kinda looks like Arthur Morgan
---
Ash Birthday skin?
---
no one plays Alibi for her gadget, they play her because her SMG is a headshot machine &amp; she has impacts. she's basically a slightly worse pre-nerf Ela. not to mention she has a shotgun revolver.
---
Yeah i meant like how to get it bc that was 2017
---
Close, but no cigar
---
I love how, Fuze, Glaz and Mute all have a pistol in the air
---
Well you cant really just mind your business when you played against or with him 4 times in 1 single day.
---
&gt;1. if no one plays IQ lmg, it is basically a new weapon
---
F**king finally, somebody with logic.
---
&gt;2. So you want another Ash that is only viable because of the weapon? I rather have an good gadget than a fancy new weapon and both of them don’t have one
---
Thanks you!
---
They have stated mnk users will face other mnk users, controllers vs controllers. You are a hoot dude, you sound like a guy who would buy an adapter to use on console rainbow because you suck with controller
---
You betterdont look at caveira
---
Bruh just google it, they said it
---
It was 2017 so i dont think it will come but i hope so bc that skin is awesome
---
These are sick, too bad I have no clue what any of these teams even fuckin mean
---
I draw the line where the dev of the game says it’s cheating
---
IQ lmg+angled grip and smg-11 is EFFING POWERFUL.
---
Iq will be back to the top soon.
---
Where is Dark Zero ? &gt;.&lt;
---
When do I have to plug back the ethernet cable?
---
Waiting for the dokkaebi kpop skin lmao
---
Not even a personal belief, but an official stance from ubi
---
And i never saw it in a game after that one so im not sure if that skin exists today but i hope it may come somitime
---
Happy cake day stranger.
---
No thats 2017 there were no birthday skins back then

Huh. Try repairing the disk if you can. It may come down to wiping and reinstalling or getting a 64gb ssd just for siege
---
Not completely sure but I thinks last ones where 300 for headgear, 300 for uniform, 300 for weapon skin and 600 for charm and discount if you buy them in bundle not sure about price for that. Only r6 credits.
---
I don’t understand what’s happening... but I’m here for it i guess 😂
---
Next few weeks
---
Why the heck would i want an defender thats 1 speed and 2 armor (that already doesnt make sense), that has an ability that will make him faster with downsides. Thats it? Then why wont i just take a jager thats already 3 speed with no downsides and can also for example destroy projectiles. Also there is a reason why you cant quick hard breach...
---
They missed the perfect opportunity to give Vigil the G2 mask
---
I agree with all of those
---
I'm doing exactly this with my bandit on my office desk.
---
I feel as if Smokes would fit her thematically, and I doubt they could make her worse.
---
What part?
---
I personally love docs elite.
---
I’m just saying I don’t trust Ubisoft. They’ve got a couple good reworks here and there but they’ve definitely made more bad decisions than good.
---
Yeah, what I said before would be the worst case scenario, and it could totally change for the better. However, if it were my choice, I would prefer not to take the gamble. They don’t exactly have the best track record when it comes to maps, is all I’m saying.
---
Imagine if she could “vault” over barbed wire lmao.
---
Smells like... cigarettes, fresh bread and... acogs...
---
He win/loss ratio
---
LMAO
---
good ol' Chalet in Pro League
---
Try muzzle break and acog. I play buck countless hours on ps4 and i have no problem controlling recoil (you know pull the stick down)
---
Console has different recoil
---
Models can look like real guns but there are no official gun names in the game.
---
There are shorthand versions or names that can't be licensed like "MP5" or "Famas"
---
I already have downloaded it so tuesday I'll be able to play it right?
---
I did this exact thing the other day as blitz
---
Its not that dificult, but you can look for a pc with those parta. Not sure where you live so its hard to just recommend a pc
---
If my aim is good and i didnt have people playing mouse and keyboard against me, yeah i am lucky
---
[removed]
---
Isn't that abusing glitches if you do it in multiplayer? I mean you aren't supposed to do that. They banned people who exploited the IQ invisible glitch and this is exploiting as well.
---
2 - 1 = 1
---
Pretty good
---
Get a 7.1 surround headset. It will blow your mind.....or ears....probaly both!
---
I think it's dumb in every modern FPS too.
---
I miss games where weapons had unique mechanics and roles instead of being a general assault rifle #484939
---
RIP the solo queue Twitch that just wants to not lose mmr on a shitty map (aka me)
---
Yeah I mean if operation phantom sights is anything to go I'm a little scared and yeah I mean theme park is a good map theres an awesome reference to Bostonbearjew so they better not touch that and if there going to just clean It up a bit maybe touch up on a little LITTLE stuff it will probably be fine and theres map that to in fact need a rework
---
A sledge main would drive a minivan
---
Yep blame the game not the fact you are probably solo queueing
---
Oh god, in my 200 hours of thunt this happened a lot of times...
---
This just made me crack up. Whatta laugh.
---
I’m so confused on what they were doing congrats man!

Wasn’t a one tap

No way!

I think defender

They already showed the loadouts
---
Gib me as skin now.
---
Pls goldy golds
---
What is it
---
What the fuck did i just read
---
Maestro and echo
---
Bandit looks cooler imo
---
Well i have to admit i didnt 100% sure about Glaz
---
Seems fine to me, wait till the new patch, the 19th of August, and let us know how it goes.
---
You can not really port a game to a new engine so easily without kinda starting from scratch but if this game really wants to go for another seven years they might need to do that
---
They are already reaching the limits of their engine but this is still a very difficult decision to make and would require at least two OP Health like seasons one after another, and people were already trash talking OP Health even though it was the only reason the game survived in the long term
---
Yeah I hate the mpx and I feel bad because warden like you said is very situational and in my opinion just a weak character overall and the fact that he’s the only 1 speed without an acog doesn’t help
---
Attacker has
---
G8/supernova
---
Smg11/i forgot the pistol

Defender has

Vector/TCSG 12

I dont remember the pistols

Nah I can say for certain that the reason IQ's LMG is underused is due to the ADS times, since the stats themselves are actually very good and the reload times aren't bad at all either since it isn't belt fed.

Why have risk of releasing an overpowered gun when there are already balanced ones in the game

And R6 is still a good game and I'm sure they would have enough resources to implement new weapons and if we can trust Axel Remy this game will continue having new DLCs for another seven years

Siege has had it fair shares of delays
---
Sad but true.
---
Let's be real here, Ubi only care for Pro league and are only changing it because of Pro League.
---
If anything on reddit was ever worthy of an up vote....it would be this.
---
why do I never seen anybody suggest she actually become silent? right now she barely reduces the noise so people keep saying "just crouch walk with 3 speeds"
---
It would absolutely broke whole concept of operators with specific abilities, speed etc.
---
If they ever really did this, they would have to neutralize each operator to the same level, and make their guns +- equal (which obviously they aren't rn)
---
C4AsH

I painted the hair on a drawing software, Clip Studio Paint

Lesion
---
It's alright man, we all mess up from time to time. I thought it was funny, if it's any consolation
---
That's why u have a mute button lol
---
His secondary is the SAS pistol
---
coz the smg11 is still usable but it needs more training, smg12 and bearing9 however only work withing melee range most of the time which can be useful coz melee in this game is inconsistent
---
But not as heavy as BFV. We had one cancelled season so far
---
BattleEye would like to speak with you, sir
---
That's one thing ppl started to notice and ask for instead of just gun buff. 
---
If she can actually become much more quieter, she'd be much more threatening overall. We just have to wait for Ubi to actually adjust her (and Warden) to be more impactful. 
---
Unfortunately, couple of ppl who played the new ops said that they don't think there's any changes for Nokk or Warden yet.
---
Thanks
---
I'd quit.
---
Imagine the true sledge getting out of the car and trying to smash your head with his hammer, just to get the glory of his teammates around him

A really big fucking hole, coming up in a month.

Tell more
---
Insert 'ugh this isn't realistic they are ruining the game' comment
---
Ubisoft really needs to reconsider this whole system. At this rate, they shouldn't introduce new Operators, because if they're anywhere near to these ones at skill level, they'll end up the same.
---
Shit, Thatcher finna slap someone.
---
Oh thanks
---
Who are you?!
---
This is not a game, this is siege in game model in blender render.
---
Same

W h a t ' s  i n  t h e  c a n i s t e r ?
---
My thoughts lol always kill hungry af
---
It only works if both gun has that skin, in this case no
---
Sad to see this game go into the color explosion Fortnite Skin territory more and more. I wish we could go back to Historical Elite skins and extremely colorful stuff being limited to weapons.
---
Cav is high-risk-high-reward op, it's very hard to interrogate around 5 op4 alive but if it happens, the Intel is massive and often leads to eazy win.
---
Lion's ability is much much much simpler to achieve than hers. I don't think you can directly compare them like that.
---
13:30 edt. Could start a bit earlier.
---
This is me daily
---
when she runs out of dildos those ones don't vibrate, but they do "boom" which is satisfying too I guess
---
Mute is Indian already, mate
---
bloop
---
Choose one:
---
Warden's ability becomes passive
---
or
---
The team can pick up glasses and it works when Warden activates it. 
---
Both would be much too strong. Sure, currently it's weak, and he needs better gear, but to make him a passive flashbang-immune smoke-peeking operator and giving that immunity to the entire team is much too strong of a counter to too many operators. Glaz? Dead. Ying? Dead. Just because Ned Flanders gave the team some sick shades. I'll vote W-2 for that vote, but I think you're overdoing the skill rework. 
---
As for Tachanka, I don't think a full 360 degrees should be possible, because you need to be able to flank him otherwise he becomes too much of a powerhouse, but 180 degrees along with that great idea of deployable shield attachment limiting it to 90 degrees sounds like a great buff that pairs well with existing strategies. 
---
As for our friend Castle, I don't think he needs a lot of work to be honest, the first one sounds like a strong buff that requires a Sledge or a Twitch to counter properly, and I like it already. However, if I had to pick, C-1 sounds like the better option. It's too easy to barricade the windows and turn yourself into a nice box of easy Fuze kills. The little slit (which I imagine would be no more than the shields?) would make it possible to spot an enemy outside, giving a a good window for defenders to get out of Fuze's range.
---
yeah I know, I did that, but when I open back reddit after some time I see it's back to "Nokk main" and it changes automatically...
---
I'm also on phone btw
---
Just change the haunted area and we are good  
---
No need to change any other place  
---
This map is AWESOME despite the problem with haunted area
---
Can you fucking include this information in game instead of just posting it on a fucking website where people rarely go before they want to play a game? How retarded does a game dev need to not include important info in the in game notifications? It's like announcing a bomb attack in a random blog post and expecting it to go fucking viral
---
Microsoft has an API that can stop it afaik. The devs just don't implement it.
---
I call this "posted on this sub like millionth time"
---
You don't need it, don't make excuses and get good with the controller
---
That's exactly what the first part of the castle buff is for, making them electric means Fuze can't use his charges on it anymore. Bring your pals like Bandit and Kaid and you'll have a good, Fuze-free time.
---
The copper got a Nice name.
---
Its a big ass reward though, i feel like its a bit too much personally. Also don't find it to be that difficult to achieve an interrogation with her set perks. Maybe you are right though
---
Dirty and confusing
---
My teammates destroy them
---
Same, but that's what the first part of the concept is for. Making barricades electrifiable would make Fuze unable to use his cluster charges.
---
Rainbow is all feasible though.
---
Vigil looks like he stole his mask with the ink tag still on lol
---
Bruh
---
Shock wire destroys traps it touches. Not sure if it kills Frost mats though.
---
Yeah thats a good point, I mean even so the constant pinging never seemed like it was too much to you?
---
New hereford is probably the most hated map rn
---
Geforce Experience doesn't work for me unfortunately
---
Fuck some elo, he wants to play and enjoy the operator. Damn, not everyone is trying to sweatily grind to diamond in this game sheesh
---
It is strong, but she should almost never get it off.
---
SR?
---
Imo Mira windows are less likely to work in rl/ harder to create than that they found a way to create arsole and and have it in gas form in a small canister
---
Headshots
---
Solo-queue I'm afraid. The other team, however, were a 5 man stack. Also, the Josh guy on my team had also gone against them in the previous game (He was also solo-queue).
---
Are you PS4? Since the new Siege store redesign, R6 credits has been unavailable so I just got them directly from PSN.
---
I like theme park the way it is
---
Which update?
---
Imagine 'disagreeing' with facts
---
I don't think I should require two gadgets to counter one in this case I think it should just be a thing yeah electric thing is cool but u can do the same with mute
---
Bruh, I will take 5 of what you smoke. It's good quality.
---
could have been worse the Josh guy had gone against them the last game he played
---
‘Scuse me but the fuck is a SR?
---
An interrogation is hard to achieve at higher ranks where people communicate a decent amount, drone, and generally stay together more. Even then her ability either wins the round or has basically no effect on it. No reason to nerf it because the interrogation is hard enough to hit and not overpowered when it does.
---
What would you suggest to buff said ops?
---

Never said epi said it was, there was leaks back then showcasing what Nokk and Warden was meant to get so i'm basing it off that.
---
they were testing Y4S3 at this case also
---
Doesn't matter too much. Like 75% of the guns already in the game never see play outside of casual so reusing some stuff is fine imo.
---
Clarification please?
---
What if she had normal weapon?
---
Whats wrong with outback
---
yes
---
I think I just got a orgasm
---
Check previous
---
I hope they keep sharing because they make skins gun specific, not character specific. 
---
I was excited when i bought the Smoke elite and saw his sick weapon skin he came with, and i could put it on anyone with the M90 shotgun, i got to put his FMG skin on him and Nøkk,and his SMG-11 skin on him, sledge, and Mute.
---
I miss them making OPs with their face covered. We’ve had 1 in years
---
Every gun is a headshot machine on pc, like I said on the post. What’s your point? If that’s your argument then why not just give every operator the fmg9 or the mpx. That by itself doesn’t make an operator good.
---
That's too much to ask, do you really think Ubisoft balancing team can do that much ?
---
Tbh all of these were quite ugly
---
I was trying to make it look like Hereford , single choke point leading up to the objective so in the end it came out kind of a cluttered storage room with multiple exits.
---
Based on the mags she has on her uniform, it's more likely she got Blackbeard's assault rifle before they made the change.
---
This is a lot faster. Why crawl when you can do this
---
10 seconds
---
Because you only need to hit one just right to crawl
---
GIVE US NEW MAPS   
---
(And guns)
---
Ubisoft should just do that because it will make the playerbase happy and at the same time, Ubisoft can make slightly more money because of the 50 or so people who decided to spend some r6 credits on a alibi skin.
---
I know it's and /s but they were supposed to replace premium with a "Battlefield coins" or "Boins" as the community has taken to calling them, and they just didnt have it implemented for months, so they werent making anything essentially, not that they are now, they're used to get a few cool skins but otherwise useless.
---
They're fixing this next season
---
At least Glaz is useful on some maps
---
I'd love to have real weapons but Ubi just doesn't care about Nøkk nor Warden.
---
They were just here to look cool but are useless in actual games.
---
Hello NightmaresAlive, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cs0udy/mute_jammer_sound_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Didnt maestro get nered in that his evil eyes can be opened up by twitch or thatcher?
---
It was something like 20 seconds boost and 20 second recharge, if I remember correctly, pretty much can spam another boost just as one wears off
---
It used to be 20 secs . It got nerfed to 10 secs and got her frag nades from IQ
---
Still faster with this method. If you do this right its faster than hitting it twice and vaulting through
---
Quick and easy way to stop this, switch drone quickly and then go back to yours then move around a bit
---
"hah, whiskey tango foxtrot."
---
True
---
Can you post a video of it?
---
And when I say 144hz I mean LOCKED. If there is even a 0.01% dip under 144 frames per second I don’t consider this to count at all. 
---
When I build for a certain target my target is very strict. That’s why I always add a huge buffer as I’m a stickler for consistency.
---
Well yeah she was meant to get a Scar as well from the leaks.
---
I’m ok with them reusing guns. But awful guns? No thanks.
---
Recycled weapons wouldn’t be a problem if they weren’t so crucial to operator balance. Now if they want to tweak one of these weapons, it’s going to affect 2 or more operators. That’s the real issue.
---
I dont mind, i just wish they would re use the right weapons and not shit ones like nokk and wardo
---
I like this art style.
---
I could see this in the Sunday Funnies section of the newspaper (yeah, I'm showing my age).
---
The sad truth. 
---
My worst fear is Ubi saying fuck it and leave both of them in their useless state to join Tachanka. 
---
My only consolidation is that Clash had the worst pick/win rate (worse than Tachanka from Ubi's own data) for a while until the SMG buff and some other adjustments and she's much more useful it seem.
---
Because she is good a sneaking it's usually close encounters for her and her gun is fine to use in range.  I know I'm in the minority, but I'm fine with her and her loadout atm.
---
Personally can’t stand attacking it.
---
As long as the gadgets are fun to use and not total trite then I'm fine with it. Problem is Warden and Nokk are garbage, hopefully these ones are different.
---
Finally a g2 weapon skin
---
Guns have random spread when spraying.
---
This is a bug When you are on an enemy's drone and then someone throws a drone just to get into the recently thrown drone
---
But it's pronounced arse-all, not arse-ole
---
G2 hasn't struggled at wall during this major. Empire has, they struggled against FaZe, Fucking FaZe. So I think it's going to be 3-1 at least for G2.
---
It's good if you have an anchor to watch em if you wanna roam with Vector
---
Its as simple as this, shroud will kill 4 ppl, go for the plant and then sau will get him through two floors a hatch and a drone hole
---
nah he still has an acog on it. same attachments all round
---
Little disappointed to hear that no one so far has seen any changes/buffs with Nokk and Warden who are currently the second worst operator in their category.
---
I'm no gun enthusiast , but It was hyperbole in a sense.
---
But wasn't/isn't that an American semi auto marksman rifle that's been around since WW1 or something
---
Trust me, I know.
---
I mastered buck with the acog, the recoil isnt that bad with muzzle/flash
---
Then yeah he was queued with the bronze. That overwolf thing only uses people’s highest elo, regardless of season or region. It can show someone as plat when they are eu plat and na bronze

SMG-11 Best Secondary
---
Get the elite you personally like. But don’t buy it for an operator you never play or are bad with
---
Fair enough.
---
I made a blanket statement and was wrong about it. I'll own it.
---
Did the aliens already took over?
---
damn we need to learn that language
---
If this is a thing. can we then get acog on smg-11 again?
---
14:30 EDT, 20:30 CEST, 19:30 BST. 
---
or in 4 hours and round about 20 minutes. watch out, it can deviate a few minutes.
---
thanks man now i gotta stay up till two thirty am
---
IMI galil
---
haha you main valk and Mira i think you are used to it too
---
headshots are the key i know, was on console still hard for me to ge5 from a bodyshot to a headshot in a 1v1 fight situation, but on PC holy shit, i mean it's my first PC can't even walk normally, but im hitting headshots dude
---
Shhh let the tryhards have their moment
---
Because dude 2nd Africa operator
---
Neither is apex
---
Hes good if youre smart but there is better
---
If you mean take away the ammo box, no thanks. I enjoy being able to get more Claymores to troll terrorists.
---
Yea sorry I didn't look at em this time
---
Plane is going to be flawed forever. Theres no way to turn that map into something balanced because a plane is just too linear to really expand on. Plus unless the map turns into a wrecked plane, you will always have to go up the skinny stairs to get into the map.
---
 I just hate that map all together
---
Exactly. 
---
The Old Hereford had a lot of spawnpeeking but atleast the map was so crap and unbalanced that you could just screw around with different Strats that wouldn’t work on any balanced map.
---
Already sounding much better than Warden. May he rest in peace.
---
Bitch she the whole damn meal
---
Absolutely
---
Smg11 is the highest dps in theory, but it empties it magazine in under 1 second, its true dps is lower.
---
I'm pretty sure only like 10% of the player base is using disks
---
If that, even
---
What in the fookin laser sight is this
---
Maybe keep the box there just for grenades and claymores
---
Lesion, easily
---
Yea Warden is looks good plays ass
---
SLEDGE MAINS RISE UP
---
Exactly I love theme park and hate that map
---
In annecy, France
---
Haha it's usually a free kill if someone runs out to reinforce that hatch
---
I've heard from 2 ppl so far that they didn't detect anything different with neither Warden nor Nokk. 
---
I'm just hoping those two get buffs to be viable.
---
I main Thatcher with sledge as a backup. All of these are pretty high impact bans, sledge being the least so but still without a frag grenade on the board.
---
You can pay for more alpha packs during event but you can get 2 for free
---
imagine if she had ash’s gun, she would be the top pick for an op
---
the recoil in insurgency is so severe for me that i usually have to play it in single fire anyway though, so i can see where you're coming from
---
I prefer to try and C4 blitz. Because blitz is often faster than me.
---
SAS mains unite!
---
I am paying for the season pass. Why am I getting recycled content? Looks like I'll pass on next years
---
I don’t play Apex. Just saying that nobody should even think about ranting because those paid packs don’t mean shit
---
Yea damage to me dosent mean anyttning lol i still clean 2-3 people up with mira or valk.
---
Ive been hard stuck plat 2-1 for 5 seasons now so headshots are key to anything, if youre new to PC and disregard the toxicity, play casual and work on a set of ops you can play easily.
---
I play the same six and have become amazingly good with them. Plus past ops i used to play such as buck - i have 80 hours on him and mastered him with an acog on his C8.
---
Exactly but I think that's like the house situation where there something they could do but its probably very little
---
Fooking Lazer soights?
---
Ubisoft makes us sad =/
---
alley oop
---
Do you have Amazon prime? If you don't that's why, otherwise I'm not sure pal.
---
I guess Tachanka will have a drinking buddy at this rate and Nokk might decides to join after the new Attacker is added. 
---
In your opinion, which of the two new ops felt more satisfying?
---
Difficult question considering how little you got to try out but there's always that first impression.
---
I get the reason behind not adding new guns but the devs said they would add new weapons . Where are they then ?
---
Yet the f2, spear, vector308 and other rush op guns still have Acog
---
Anyone who needs that sight? I honestly end up against Thatcher to much to bed the reticle on the sight. I just center my enemy.
---
exactly
---
Not entirely true.
---
Is the update out today?
---
But of course, my sincerest apologies, you're right
---
Was watching and saw you it was pretty funny just seeing someone so hyped
---
Oh boy do I have some bad news for you
---
Its most likely gonna have frost level firerate btw so you can relax.
---
How to make warden insanely op
---
You're getting the content too if you don't buy the pass.
---
Vault but si
---
I spat out my tea, like shit that's funny
---
Video or it didn’t happen
---
Raleigh NC, the major.
---
I hope they do make it full auto, but for people already complaining and panicing, it will have a slow firerate (frosts).
---
So if remove the map they removed bartlet for a while favela and yacht had been removed. My point is not every map has to be viable for competative it's fine to have maps in casual that are not balanced but are fun
---
when did they say this?
---
I’m just happy it goes away
---
All I heard so far is the frag grenade with one person saying that her DMR got the full auto, which many ppl quickly picked up and started to spread around but not sure if that is actually true. 
---
I guess we will have to wait.
---
So I think the new attacker is really flashy and gunna create new strats like I wanna try onnkafe
---
Planting by bar and then rappelling up skylight to watch it
---
Defender idk I like his kit I need more time to decide if I like how he plays shafeel?
---
Some people like to wait for the reveal and get all the info at the same time
---
If u had a nickel for every time I turned on Frost....
---
Too situational to be viable imo, too close to use for no benefit, rather that hs.
---
I wouldn't have anyone to play with!
---
I never noticed that, thats dumb
---
Brilliant.
---
how will we eat crumpets in peace now?
---
Can I take a moment to ask that you learn to counter the bitch so we can have an actual useful ban phase? Want to get rid of Bandit or Kaid to take the free basement site away from the defenders but can't.
---
Same with Caveira, what the fuck is up with banning Caveira???
---
Id be rich and youd still be turning on frost
---
Good point, a full magazine of 17 will give 595 damage.
---
Satisfying
---
I think when white noise came out they said they would add new weapons throughout every year while reworking old ones to keep the game fun and replayable.  Something like that
---
Yikes.
---
Kaid’s shotgun with acog and Mira’s vector.
---
He has 2/2 and acog
---
That is true
---
No. We lost next round. 3 vs 5 was imbossible.
---
Is the SMG-11 any better than the CZ? I’ve had better luck with the CZ because there’s just too much recoil on the SMG.
---
Vigil is fine as he is imo, in the right hands hes a monster that can almost solo carry defense rounds in bronze-plat, hes a pain in the ass to deal with if he knows how to time and excute his ability perfectly.
---
So you mean like when they rework Kanal for this season
---
Neeko lmao
---
GF will fuck up every round and most definitely go negative, So a 4v5 with a a god on each team.
---
Ps4? Tbh I wonder if newcomers on pc is way harder
---
As a Brit myself, I take full offence (sarcasm)
---
If Echo is still alive and at that point and you haven't planted, that's on you.
---
I’m so impatient though 😭
---
I mean it’s upvoted
---
they should give diamond to everyone/s
---
So you’re on Ps4? Newcomer is just filled with smurfs and i choose to play casual only
---
So you want irl repercussions for things done online/in a game? Big brother much?
---
Look like a draw to me.  Vid was cut short, so kill feed doesn't come up, but she looks like she's entering the falling animation.
---
I think it's cool to have recycled weapons. Like having the new op and kaid run around being butt buddies spawn peeking every window with the tcsg12 with an acog. Or running around with mira mowing people down with the vector. People complain about recycled weapons then will turn around and say recruits a fun operator even though he doesn't have an ability or attachments.
---
I never knew I needed this as a headgear until now.
---
What are you even trying to say here
---
I’m interested in your religion
---
Blackbeard
---
its basically that, apparently (source dude trust me though) they pulled devs from siege for ghost recon and for R6 quarantine
---
It's what my gut tells me. I'm probably wrong \^\^
---
dOnT cOmpLaIn oTheRs haVE iT woRSe
---
Could be on sale soon considering the Majors are on and the new season is coming out in a few weeks
---
So they changed the operator loadout screen/background? Cool
---
I tried to be a German :o)
---
I use the CZ. The recoil breaks the smg for me.
---
Fuck. Clash.
---
So it takes well over 30 seconds of direct exposure to clash with no counter to even be downed. 
---
What happened?
---
Hmm, I don’t know how I feel about that. I feel like people will hate it though.
---
I would’ve been happier with Beaulo getting Bandit and Kharz getting Zof, but rip I guess
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bqp1tl/rest_of_year_4_season_release_dates/
---
The Talon icon is a really nice design
---
Disconnect your Ethernet cable/wifi, log on to r6, custom game. You can do this with new ops without the season pass too.
---
it looks like she's the first older looking female operator as there are none, There are older male operators like Capitao, Thatcher and Kaid
---
Oh shut up the ira attacked the British solders first and the " inoccent " people throw rocks and sticks to lead the British solders  to flats where the ira had an ambush ready and the confused British solders fired at the building and the people got cought in the cross fire
---
This raises a question for me. if you were able to have a full movie made about an operator, who would it be?
---
I'm going with frost.
---
I mean in all honesty I feel like Sledge is kind of a default main, there's rarely a situation where he's useless (unless you're playing Tower, seriously Ubi why would you make a vertical map with no destructible floors besides hatches?)
---
not really i think the map is fundamentally flawed.
---
Tram seperates the map into 2 separate maps
---
Even without tram they 2 halves cant interact the same way kanal or skyscraper can by peeking across.
---
Its far too big so if large chunks arent taken out its gonna still be too big.
---
I wouldve much rather seen favela reworked since its just a bunch of boxes stacked on top of each other that could easily be reshaped with soft/hard walls swapped out to make an interesting map.
---
Kanal is my favorite casual map. I'm pretty excited about it (probably) coming back into ranked with a better layout
---
The point of interrogation is that they’re hard to pull off but give you a big reward. You pick off the idiot who went on his own with a caviera around and hope his teammates don’t come buttfuck you before you get it off. Sounds like you got interrogated to much and you’re now salty about it, don’t worry we all get that way.
---
Because frags, firebolts, and various other options for eliminating batteries are a thing...
---
Or now you can do the dreaded double trick between bandit and Kaid, swapping back and forth based on who's nearby and what kind of anti-tricking tactics they're using.
---
Ddos I'd say.
---
Replacing a spawn peak map with a spawn peak map is dumb, if it was that bad they should have just removed it from the rank rotation like they did with several other maps instead of just ruining it for the sake a few deluded individuals
---
I saw this live, gave me a good chuckle
---
Is that an actually skull on his shoulder. Jesus!
---
The only one I did seriously, thank you !
---
Oooof. Unicorn Tachanka, Furry Smoke, Princess Beard, Infected Finka, Halloween skull Jager.
---
This game maybe is realistic, but not the skins
---
No, they shouldn’t give out diamond, yes, there are a lot of ddosers on console, but I hit diamond this season and I only got booted or stressed maybe 10% of the time. The rest were just mnk, who aren’t even that good. You can do it legit if you are good enough.
---
I think outback is fine. I kinda like fortress and chalet as well, even if they are flawed. Hereford and skyscraper are absolutely terrible.
---
I said serious hardbreaching. Maverick is for more for murderholes, not opening up whole walls.
---
Kinda sucks that in the couple posts where the OP just likes the Punisher comics, they still get roasted and called cringey even though they’re a good sport about it.
---
YES!! plz
---
What in the hip hop hipitty are you talking about? That's just false.
---
Points give good info, If your enemy is behind a shield and they get downed how will you know? It's a lot better to have info on whether people are downed or not, or whether the person you tagged is dead or someone else.
---
Please give her unique guns

YOU DONT NEED TO LEAN WITHOUT ADS
---
Maybe go for the torso:)
---
If a slightly different weapon model or two per season that functions almost identically to existing guns is the sole reason you bought the season pass, I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Well cause there isnt any other reason for not adding other guns, except that they want more time working on bugs and glitches everybody is complaining about.
---
Before the leak? well, there will be even more complains after the reveal then.
---
Yes but plenty of other console FPS’s have this option, id honestly settle for the option to just remap the knife button because that’s my biggest issue
---
5 counters is plenty, and there's more than just 5 anyway.
---
Sledge, Maverick, Zofia, frag grenades, Twitch and Thatcher would disable the electricity, and both have breaching charges, 
---
Frags have 3 other operators besides Sledge, who are Buck, Finka, and Recruit (although recruit can't be played competitively anymore, so count that how you will)
---
7 operators, 8 with recruit. That's plenty of counters, and there's probably some that I forgot.
---
There's 2 hard counters to hard breach denial (Thatcher and Twitch)
---
There's 3 hard breachers.
---
No one can properly counter Maverick, and there's no stopping Capitao at all.
---
Smoke if played properly can't really be countered.
---
There are plenty of operators with very few counters, some with none at all. Don't act like 5 counters isn't enough.
---
reuploaded
---
Yep it's

Dude I played console for literally years. When I came to PC all the map knowledge in the world couldn’t make up for being new at m + k. Newcomer mode gave me a place to learn.
---
I want him to have hair so bad!!!
---
What the fucking hell is your username
---
NANI?
---
The biggest problem is this just perpetuates an attitude of whining and entitlement. Oh, there's an operator you have a hard time against? Well forget practicing and getting better at the game, just ban the operator and ruin the fun for everyone else!
---
Absolutely fuming
---
it's weird cauz i never had ash
---
Your welcome master. It was my pleasure to please your overinflated ego. Your sick dude, you pray on others inability to be perfect in your imaginary imperfect world. You argue for the sake of hearing yourself speak, not to help anyone reach any kind of understanding. I don't know what's wrong with this country or this world or anyone it, I'm no Ultimate authority on anyone or anything, although I have my opinions and can respect others, even yours my friend, but I won't entertain you any longer. Good day sir.

\#\*characters powers\*
---
\*"characters powers"\*
---
Yea i know that, but what I’m saying is there is theoretically a timeline in which his is alive as crossbones.
---
This is unacceptable. If Ubisoft reuse old guns again on S4 operators, I swear they will lose at least 2/3 of their annual season pass sales.
---
And to those who use the logic "I prefer a R6S with balanced weapons to new but broken stuff every season", you might as well ask Ubisoft to remove every op and use recruits only, it's a lot more practical and realistic that way. And we've had some satisfying seasons, no reason Ubi can't do it again.
---
Smoke main here. Equally triggered.
---
done
---
yeah the ads time is horrible but when you actually aim down and start shooting that thing is amazing

Hello kaounasnik, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cs3u3p/we_can_all_agree/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Reuploaded atk clip, uploading def clip
---
The spawnpeeks on the new one are minimal and the map has been balanced a hell of a lot better than old Hereford.
---
A Legend says you'll get an orgasm Everytime you see this clip, Russian Badger the only and lovely one.
---
Lies
---
I love to see Russian Badger being himself even on stage
---
Something Something 26+6 equals 1
---
i use it :-\[
---
its a trash skin though
---
Thanks for your kind words my friend
---
More hype for Kanal. I'm a casual pleb and I DESPISE that map. It's so bad
---
Why do they keep messing with old maps, they work fine
---
Remy himself said that it's a licenseing issue. But yeah, balancing as well is another plus
---
It's because glaz's rifle has a weird fire rate cap, if you try to fire it as fast as you can you'll get inconsistent timing between each shot resulting in the 235rpm, but if you slow down a little and try to fire the gun around 320, you'll achieve the 320 mark. I also think that you can get a higher dps than what the 320 alludes to, because you can get a faster burst than the 320 which results in the next round coming slower than the previous, making the 235rpm, resulting in a second of higher damage than normal.
---
There are a lot more dumb mechanics that you have to look into when doing the dps of the guns in siege, I recomend looking up rogue 9 on youtube as he's already done a lot these calculations and I believe he has a chart for everyone to see.
---
boosted plat
---
*Looks at BF4’s list of weapons each having slight differences that still made the guns feel unique and fun to use*
---
Okay then.
---
so many shitty "montages" this week.. don't you feel ashamed posting something like that?
---
not even 1 single kill that was montage worth.
---
Where is it reuploaded
---
I've done exactly that in the same place. Lines up perfectly with that window haha.
---
reupped
---
Soon. I played with the new ops and might host a ama soon
---
Buck didn’t steal it, he just got the last kill.
---
meh
---
And Loki is probably still alive since that same timeline he escaped with the cube
---
I guess but some people like the fact that they are real guns
---
Moar badjr
---
no wayyyy. I was wondering why it wasnt working for me. holy shit im an idiot
---
That full on cockeye lol love it
---
I'm a youtube content creator, not the last, not the best and even not being the best it takes 4-5h to make a good one, if you think you can do better and judge anyone else, make it your job, because you'd be rich.
---
Finka's gun isn't real. It's based off of an old prototype that sucked ass and was never adopted. Lion's gun is also completely fake, you could never make a Vector shoot .308. The recoil system and bolt length aren't compatible.
---
:(
---
On a scale of 1 to rare: *that’s rare*
---
I’m so mad I’m missing this stream
---
Yep. I personally couldn't care less. New guns would more than likely be (very close to) a copy and paste of stats from other guns, just with  new name anyway. Less guns for me to battle RNG with to get decent skins.
---
R.I.P. my main as well :(
---
Im not up to snuff on the shit that goes on in ranked but I do know this ban shit is destroying Mira in ranked. I fluctuate my attackers at times but I never ever ever play any other defender. Honestly this is why I’m avoiding playing ranked
---
That seems to be the consensus alright, I will probably give it a miss. Thanks for the reply
---
I'm not familiar with the terminology ok...
---
I downed the last one and buck killed him is what I meant

Fucking IQ Lmg , cmon like it’s so bad
---
Honestly would like it any year
---
Oof ddos
---
You’re actually an idiot.
---
Just Ash rush him.
---
great job man hoping for more leaks
---
When did Mr. Remy said it's a license issue. I can't believe I missed that.
---
How did you play with the new ops?
---
If the meal is shit in a 5 star restaurant are you going to accept it because:
---
"Well I can't make it better so yea better i should not say my opinion"
---
smartass
---
And?
---
Lots of people like to practice recoil and get used to guns etc, so stop being rude for no reason
---
Yeah putting it on cop cars and military property is cringy as shit, but its still just a logo from a property.
---
No one should aspire to be The Punisher nor ahould antlyone idolize him. But the.people he kills in the movies, show or comics are hardly worthy of sympathy.

thnx bb

Hello Twuanuld, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cs4w91/oc_me_roaming_with_the_m870/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
watch him get the alda 5.56
---
Mozz and mav are only ones with blonde
---
Lion aint
---
Season 3 is Kanal, Season 4 is Theme Park
---
first of all lets see how they build canal
---
They look so cool!
---
Give everyone acog for everything, let's make siege great again.
---
They do not even use real names to avoid licenses - Glock is something special, they are really aggressive when it comes to their brand.
---
Some games still use the Glock, for example Escape from Tarkov.
---
It would be very cool but OP as hell with a ban on thatcher.
---
ACOG back On the smg 11?
---
Only if it gets a vast reduced recoil
---
would b cool if they made her a 1A3S
---
True like I was so disappointed when I so that he had a vector and nothing else
---
Are you kidding me they’re doing another rework!!?? I want a new map!!!!
---
The vector is a good SMG. The G8 is a fine LMG, the only downside is the sluggish ADS time. The TCSG is a nice weapon and acts more as a DMR with shotgun destruction. p226 is a damn good pistol with its high damage. Supernova is a bad shotgun, I will give you that. The SMG-11 is amazing, and I’m sure I don’t need to tell you why. Their loadouts are great, not nearly as bad as Warden’s.
---
what's APCA though?
---
The problem is people want the old GOOD map back. All they had to do was balance the old one, not completely remake it into this crap.
---
No new weapons,but i think i saw the supernova having a suppressor.
---
Not sure if it was the case,and if it has one right now,but it might be a new attachment for it
---
the grappling hook looks kind of rough
---
Why the nerf for Zofia? -.-
---
Goyo has impacts and c4
---
Source: varsitygaming just dropped a video of gameplay
---
I think it would be fun to let the players step out of their comfort zones like that. Would be something no game has really ever done before and making it a timed event like showdown, breakout, etc would make it totally optional so you don't HAVE to play it,  but the option is there yknow?
---
This pretty much sums up my opinion too
---
While he does explain how to do the glitch, the amount of people viewing the glitch then know the easiest ways to do the glitch and, for the limited amount of time that the glitches are possible, the amount of people who abuse it will increase because of the views on the videos. It would be better if he uploaded the video unlisted and sent it privately to Ubi (through R6Fix or other means) then it reduces the likelihood of someone knowing how to do the glitch and abusing it until it is patched.
---
Coming from my mind.
---
Why are they re-using old guns now smh
---
Yeah, opening the packs was half the fun
---
this is quick, nice
---
Wow, you are a little entitled.
---
i never said he was. i said his gadget was effective because he was playing below plat elo
---
Agreed. Especially on the mpx. It just isn’t him I fell like he should have a jager type gun maybe even a gun similar to vigils
---
at least we have new gadgets. maybe in the next season we’ll have new gadgets and guns
---
They removed smokes impacts for a deployable shield, and changed a bunch of other gadgets for deployable shields and swapping.
---
'ello, guv.
---
Warden is just straight garbage he’s need a much bigger buff than this in my opinion
---
But but.... muh Meme park :(
---
Ubi is going to act surprised when Year 5 pre-orders are in the fucking garbage.
---
It’s really stupid that they keep nerfing the purple tarps honestly
---
I guess to make his Vulcan shileds a little less.....usless.
---
zof and ash get a lot of play
---
I think Vigils gun would be good
---
Have I missed anything? Reply here with more information. Feel free to provide screenshots, clips or similar as well.
---
Because shes a hard counter to goyo most likely, she can take 2 of 3 shields down. Ash can also do it but shes slower. Also probably because she brings alot of utility to a team.
---
Im also upset about this but im just gonna stop playing her at this point. Shes received so many un needed nerfs.
---
It actually never was a thing because Ubi confirmed that it never ever worked to begin with
---
I disagree with mpx changes entirely. The gun has nothing to do with it. It's the fact that with glaz being near useless, smokes are used less and most of the time any plant denial gets the same job done over warden. If they want him used more, a gadget rework is the way to go
---
No new guns... again. Even if we are ignoring that guns are part of the operators and as such we are getting less content than previous seasons, using the same weapons on multiple ops will only restrict  balancing options down the line.
---
Where from tho?
---
Like what? I mean making him 2/2 is not the best in my opinion
---
No it's not, it's a decent gun that's overshadowed by the 552
---
They might’ve deleted it because it came out earlier then they were gonna reveal it
---
&gt; Yes you can complain but you can't expect always the best of the content and you know, that's what you still not answering but going around it. 
---
then use fucking question marks and ask it.
---
but I already wrote my comment about it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
" 
---
&gt;no one here says that content must be godlike
---
Did I say that? no
---
I just said it's total bullshit and asked him if he doesn't feel ashamed for posting trash like that.
---
Between shit and godlike are many other things like not so good, could be better, good "
---
and well his pst is simply total trash.
---
Would it be possible for you to make an Elite skinned version of Smokes gadget?
---
Really? Never knew that, thanks for telling me
---
Ruined? Hard to ruin a horrible map.
---
There is a matchmaking settings menu where you can turn modes and maps on and off - but the mode selection only applies to casual (ranked is always bomb) and the map selection only applies to Terrorist Hunt.
---
Stay tuned for changes to the ranked map pool in a few minutes (fingers crossed) on the R6 twitch stream.
---
Casual is a 21 map pool right now, which is outrageous, no question. You can play 20 hours without seeing a map. Learning them all takes hundreds of hours of play, it's absurd.
---
And not just in the last 10 seconds to say how trash the team is
---
You sir, are speaking  the truth.
---
I think its to make her a little more usefull for taking out hatches, and going through them without being gunned down..at the expense of having a shotty as a main wep.
---
Looks like a fast food cashier
---
2/2 Atk
---
iqs lmg, supervona Smg-11, miras secondary
---
Grapple
---
2/2 Def
---
Mira vector, kid shotgun Hibana smg
---
3 shields that blow up fire bigger and more damage that capitao
---
Your mom is crap
---
300IQ plays
---
Probably right. I also thought about garage doors. Instead destroying them, if Twitch zapped the switch it would open the door quietly Instead of making it explode
---
Not as much as your mouth
---
Nah, pcmasterrace
---
Already working on it!
---
When it comes to personal performance the vector is probably my best gun on defense (shit is a laser) so I guess I should be happy, but yeah it's disappointing. Neither of the new gadgets seem particularly interesting to me either so I'll just keep hoping that Season 4 is better.
---
Acog on kids shotgun that he has
---
Still... Zofia should be an Ash alternative. Why would I choose her now over Ash?
---
Yea, cuz your ass too close to your nose
---
That would break a part of the game but i wouldnt actually mind it. Just to see for a week or so
---
You sir dont know how to read but ok.
---
Wow what a bullshit design that only works after you nerf other ops to stupidity.
---
Check if you have v-sync turned on there obviously
---
Because budgets and datacaps I believe
---
Going to ruin another map, great
---
We do this loads of times when there's not enough players on our time zone.
---
Yea i would like to see this, smg 11 in its prime :)
---
It will make it this way due ubisofts design decisions
---
Go google what those words are, english isnt your forte right, dumbass.
---
The madlads
---
Me: "I'm tired of formatting so let's go friendly and with short things"
---
Him:
---
Making him into a 2 speed 2 armor and maybe his gadget could have a secondary function like iq where he could see enemy gadgets through walls for example thermite charges, claymores.
---
I don't think the problem is that they both see a lot of play as alternates, but at the same time.
---
I dunno. my best guess, and only a guess, is so the vulkan shields stand a chance lol.
---
as someone who plays a lot of zof ,its pretty lame. atleast give her stun back then.
---
Trying to prevent more colonization I see.
---
Stop self promoting
---
Still. You get an unfair advantage
---
Can you explain further?
---
It's ima and you'll wasn't spelled right and was used wrong you stupid dipshit
---
Ah yes because the art team works on fixing the game... please stop.
---
The unofficial acronym for Titanfall 2 is TF|2
---
The major has more viewers alone than fortnite. I am so proud of this community
---
Well your still not out of the woods my friend, hackers everywhere
---
the same as mozzie and kaid.
---
That was hot.
---
Honestly grom has gotten alot of un needed nerfs because of the straight up autistic siege community.
---
But another part of me says buff jeager - alot of ops are being added to the game with throwables, which means at some point 6 zapzaps can really do much, so why not make 3 per ads?
---
Enh that shotty is already garbage
---
pretty unfortunate we’re getting rehashed guns for new ops again. gunplay in siege is fun but more so when you get to learn and adapt to new weapons, imo
---
Please stop banning Echo now.
---
Did you not read his comment?! He told me I should be ashamed of myself for uploading something I’m proud of Jesus if your gonna be nice just don’t even comment.
---
I heard he gets 3
---
Ahh look a real question!
---
No sorry we don't use that shit in germany because we use direct conversation so shit like that can't happen, my dude.
---
Btw i've read about it and it doesn't work like that, my dude.
---
Agreed, no one is putting a gun to our heads. Yes it does go on sale often for the base game, and yes people can still grind for there cosmetics.
---
They literally said that next season is going to have things like animated comics locked behind the paywall
---
The BR sucks
---
I’m sad the G2 skin is for sledge, I have the sledge elite...
---
Then dont buy it? You lose actually nothing by just not buying, you get some free shit even.
---
I thought that was what you were implying, my b.
---
Overall, operation Phantom Sight was a big no no
---
This is the closest we'll get to a Disney remake of it.

How isn't it?
---
You already get a bunch of benefits with SP and you don't even need to buy it to get access to the main content (New ops and maps). Both of these are completely optional and I'm sure they don't expect people to buy them both all the time
---
Lmao
---
Yeah, they reverted on Premium Packs so fast it was neck breaking.
---
never asked why he never takes of his helmet?
---
THEY ARE ADDING IT FREE. and recycling guns is fine. imagine trying to balance a new gun where they're already so many guns.
---
I’m loving Rogue, Cloud9, Liquid and INTZ. None of them are terrible, I’m happy that they had a new phase of these skins.
---
you mean mera?

Yeah, that is big brain time

Kinda a niche thing compared to the amount of toxic 4 stacks

so?

The battlepass isn’t gambling? You pay for a set amount of items and then you just need to play to get them. If you didn’t think you would be able to play enough, you could wait until a day before it ended and then see what level you had got to before deciding whether to buy it or not.
---
That didn't really cross my mind
---
They explained nothing about pricing or interaction with the season pass. Is the season pass being retired? Are we expected to purchase both? Will it be the same price as a season pass but every season? They haven't told us. A lack of transparency on this is slightly worrying.
---
there's no one way to play any operator

dynamic smoke is simply more fun for some people, and now that prospect is gone

Damn that was quick meme making

but buying elite skins isn't a problem then? I can't understand people like you, for real. and it's only 60$ on console
---
Gotta get those charms
---
Exactly.  That whole answer just shows they don’t understand.  Adapt a current weapon a bit so it feels good.  Then you can balance ops differently as well, ex. warden needs a buff but call doesn’t.
---
are you gonna cry ?
---
Barb slows them for your toxic babes

Battlepass for f2p games why not. On p2p games? Fuck that. We already have year pass.

Hello Mxsl0an, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cs5zh9/issue_with_the_new_ops/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So then what about Finka, another operator who presses a button and effects her whole team?
---
It’s easy to execute both of their abilities, but the skill in it is timing and coordination.
---
I won't be buying it, but I am going to call out a manipulative cash grab when I see it.
---
But it's not mandatory to buy it to play the game. If you hate it then don't use it.
---
Not as easy as just adding them in. Have to take into account licensing, data limit etc.
---
Ehh, there's only so much they can do with new weapons.
---
How many shields does goyo get?
---
What you may have missed in this thread is Glaz and Dokkaebi having frags now. I saw it in the gameplay posted by PriesT
---
They're there for the charms, not for the actual stream.
---
So Reddit is Communist, damnit, should’ve known.
---
Im so proud of this community
---
This is NOT okay lmao
---
anybody knows when will the balance notes be released? is it with the season reveal or on the next day?
---
Wouldnt be better if we got one new gun and one old gun per operator? Example: nomad had 2 new decent guns why? Why not 1 old and 1 new and save the other new for a new oo. That should be the formula imo
---
r6 has a battle pass now xD
---
The Supernova has a suppressor, yep.
---
The G8A1 (German LMG) now has an angle grip.
---
Woof not even 30 seconds
---
I'm so mad and i want people to stand up this is not the siege way this is MONEY GRABBING
---
EXACTLY :)))
---
when you buy the season pass because of weapons, you do something wrong, siege is the game with the most weapons in it, and you still complain
---
Add new weapons for new ops? Does anyone even have to recommend this?
---
these are some really esoteric decisions
---
What are those faces???
---
Yes, thank you! People, stop defending corporate cost-saving bullshit! Their giving us less content at the same price and adding additional cost from things like this "battle pass."
---
THEY'RE NOT ADDING IT FOR FREE, THE FUCKING NEXT BATTLE PASS IS FREE AND PAID, ITS NOT FUCKING FREE, THEY'VE STATED THEY'RE LOCKING THINGS BEHIND IT. TELL ME WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO DEFEND A MEGA CORPORATION? THEY ARE PULLING IN A FUCK TONNE OF MONEY ALREADY. jesus christ man, and you can balance new guns fine, look at mavericks gun, its a good gun that doesn't share statistics with many other guns, they could add new guns in and balance them easy, you're literally at console war tier of fanaticism jesus christ.
---
Glaz has grenades
---
I think Goyo actually got good guns. I don't like weapons being reused, but his kit is really good.
---
Oh good, two ACOG slug shotguns on defense.
---
when are they coming?
---
Probably a charm
---
Rogue skins look good,I like how the blue and orange look.I also have the rouge skin for buck
---
As soon as i saw you not mention Chalet, this post lost its meaning. 
---
Chalet is worse than fortress and hereford.
---
And thank you, much appreciated
---
That’s why we don’t talk about the tab I have open in twitch
---
The best way for me to explain it and why I found it addictive is, it's like a RPG every single game. You pick a character and need to farm better weapons and then 30-50 minutes in the games over and you do it again, probably with a different character this time. Throw in ranking into that and if you're competitive like me it becomes even more addictive.  
---
It's like playing chess when you get to a decent level where your team understands the fundamentals, it becomes if we do this &gt; the enemies do that.
---
See my point. Most people are just having a rash bad reaction to it. Say they reveal they're adding new guns to the pass, I'd call BS on the spot, but they aren't. Most likely its just outfits, camos, and charms. Stuff that already exists in the game in the shop.
---
Likely experimenting.  
---
Prior to that shotgun, all the defender weapons with ACOG were all automatic. The SMG-11 (in year 1) and the MP7 were all high RoF and not too difficult (well, more so about the SMG-11, MP7 was easy) to control.  The MP5 and 416-c where very easy to control.  
---
However the TCSG adds a new dynamic.  It functions more like a DMR in that it's semi auto only, and comes with a fairly heavy kick.  It has a mag of 10+1, and because it's technically a shotgun it's damage drop off is fairly steep.  
---
What made the other guns with ACOGs problematic was because they were full auto.  All the defender had to do was hold the trigger and keep the sight relatively on target.  But this is semi-auto, each time your gun fires is a new, deliberate shot.  They'll need to slow down line up the shot again.
---
I hope we get Presidential Plane, Yacht, and House added back to competitive pool. Oh, and Favela too. They're pretty good.
---
I’d heard differently for the player count, but in the end that doesn’t really matter. Siege is experiencing regular gains and new players are joining every month. 
---
Also, people get new content every season by way of Elites, new skins, new mid-season events, new operators with new gadgets and playstyles, and new balancing. If one season doesn’t make you “hype” skip it, miss out on the cool stuff, and come back later. 
---
My point here is this: no one really cares about whether you’re hyped or that you hate that there are no new guns. We’re going to hear that repeated over and over and over and over again so please, don’t.
---
I wouldn’t be upset if they stopped doing yearly passes on top of it
---
Clubhouse
---
+ "Motoradfabrik" on the front
---
+ Police Cars in Green with 911 on them
---
Kanal
---
+ wrong colored German Flags
---
IQ Elite
---
+ "Walkman" translated with Google to "Gehender Mann" while Walkman is a german Word.
---
I mean unless you want to run around killing people with frags, c4s, or knives, I think the guns are one of the more important parts of this first person shooter game
---
This ignores how much can be bought for money and there is still stuff that can only be bought for money, the pro league items mainly which Ubi still take 70% of.
---
Please go fuck yourself, they could totally add it without charging people when there are 5 different methods of monetization, this is literally their most profitable game.
---
:D
---
It is. Ubisoft doesnt gives a fuck
---
Neither is Theme Park going to be a full blown rework but Ubisoft are still calling it that.
---
oh :)))
---
Na .. this is the internet.
---
It’s not only that it’s the fact that you paid 30 bucks for a season pass expecting to get that “premium” 7 days exclusivity and some skins and all that crap and out of nowhere that no longer matters or they just made another side category, this looks like just a plain money grab from ubi and a way to make r6 credits v-bucks, but I can agree with you when you say that I would be able to deal with it if it is just alpha packs and booster, even though I would still be pissed they are doing that shit. And being realistic it is not going to be just that and for sure there are going to be “premium skins” or some kind of perk or something.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I thought VarsityGaming created that
---
No I’m actually enjoying this
---
Only problem I see is it will limit how he can be played if she gets popular. You can no longer use your barricades to funnel opponents, but you will have to use them to prevent quick breeches on the windows.
---
They have no reason to lie  about it
---
If you spot 2 bombs you get 200 point and of you spot all the defenders that 50 point and if you pick up the defuser you get another 10 point for a total of 260 point.I think thats the best you could get.
---
Flowers , are you ducking kidding me where’s the Minecraft ores at
---
#Rainbow six quarantine monster audio leaked.
---
What the fuck
---
I really hope it will be a thing
---
So there are limitations for the devs
---
I dont have any source, I just wanted to say that these are separate passes. However I do admit it was bold to say that they will sell them separately without any sources. Sorry.
---
They get rid of Theme Park just to add it in next season and keep Chalet and Skyscraper. I personally like Theme Park and Fortress and I hate Chalet and Skyscraper. Hereford gone is good though. 
---
Everyone loves new weapons to play with. If we’re recycling weapons can we use better weapons or at least offer a larger selection to operators with lower tier recycled weapons? A larger weapon selection would really benefit Nokk. She’s basically restricted to one primary because the shotgun is one of the worst shotguns in the game. At least warden has a decent loadout. And you limit the new attacker to a slow ADS weapon or an inconsistent shotgun. And now two defenders the TCSG? That’s a crazy idea and I don’t know how I feel about that. 
---
Also thanks for bringing in a battle pass that no one wants and carries a very negative reputation when the game has so many glaring issues and lacks huge quality of life features and selling a battle pass on top of a year pass.
---
Kill a bomber with Clash's taser (a bomber always spawns on the last round of defence)
---
That pisses me off
---
The problem is people report for non toxic reason

I've loved Bajur since he was doing Bad Company 2 vids, but when his content became just stream highlights I've kind of fallen away from him. Miss his old style, but I'm happy this is working out for him

With the release of Amaru and Goyo I think I’ll be flying right into a bunch of new explosions in the coming weeks. In anticipation I immediately went to my own laser and started engraving!

If you have questions about the process please let me know below, tomorrow I’ll be posting a video on my social media covering the designing process and showing them being engraved. Feel free to check them out at ArcanicArtistry or enjoy the post here.

Thank you everyone – from developers to those in the community who’s brought this amazing game to life that’s still being enjoyed almost 5 years later.

Then ubi fucked up

I agree. I joined back with his bad company 1 review. Ive watched him ever since. Most of his siege content isnt as fun as other games, but i guess after 3 years of playing a game you get bored. Thats why he moves around to other games.
---
I actually thought Smoke's elite was pretty cool but I am not a fan of this legendary. Hopefully it looks better with a full body shot, but I have some doubts.

Yes

---
My favorite gun. Super 90 Nerged
---
Not a fan, for two reasons:
---
1. Battle passes are a grind, no fun. Especially if you pay for it, you "must" play in order to make your purchase worth it. 
---
2. Naturally, this update is also going to add another stream of "battlepass exclusive" skins. I am not a fan of exclusives in a paid game. 
---
I actually suspect this is a first move into eventually making Siege free to play, considering that a battleplass is really out of place in an already payed for game.  This would fit in the trend of Siege becoming cheaper and cheaper over time. Siege now has enough revenue channels to support the game even when not payed for. 
---
Honestly, depending on the implementation, this may be where I stop playing. w/e
---
Godly needs to chill bro doesn’t he know this is supposed to be fun back up from the monitor a little bit and breath lol.

I believe they said she can go through “rapellable windows” meaning you can’t go through trophy window

Yeah

It really is formulaic when it comes to his seige videos. But i find his other videos much more fun

What!? Why?

It's Ubisoft's responsibility to investigate reports. That's the entire purpose of a report button.
---
Just spawn helicopter for tea and the tower spawn for work. Killinf work spawnpeekers are easy and helicopter is pretty safe if you go right and rappel instead of going through the arch om the left
---
“Make things better quickly” I guess he means like the myriad glitches that plague each season and glitches that return...seems like they deserve more money.
---
Completely agree. I wish they’d stop trying to force that gadget on us.
---
Oh that's awesome!
---
its either that crappy music, or a 6 y/o with a cursing problem
---
As an E-Sports game, Siege is pretty well optimized to run well on almost any modern gaming PC.
---
You know you’ve won a debate when instead of addressing a single point made, the other person resorts to insults. It makes you look pretty simple. I guess people just don’t like when people point out the glaring holes in their arguments? There’s really no reason to be rude though. Just take some time to rethink your clearly flawed points maybe? Anyways, have a good evening bro.
---
What is the interest of removing the shield that fit well for some defender? Rook / Maestro / Mira
---
They removed first from frost / doc  
---
Soon they will remove this from echo  leaving defender uncover it's  not call of duty it's SIEGE
---
A Battle Pass on top of the Season Pass is complete shit. I don't mind paying for one, but this is double dipping at its worst.
---
&gt;Battle Pass
---
&gt;No new guns for the second operation in a row
---
I'm out
---
seen plenty of hibana using it for less :|
---
Add the premium version on to the season pass, and this is a great change. If it's standalone, then we're reaching a critical mass of demonetization which is overall unhealthy for the game.
---
Nah, to make a whole and break bandit batteries or kaid claws or mute jammers.
---
Ela elite? I never heard of her getting one but ik Mira just had hers announced
---
If you haven’t noticed, they give SHITLOADS of new content every 3 months that most people don’t even pay extra for. New guns is a very small part of the content you get access to every season.
---
Hello there!
---
Ok, but what about Variations?  Like.. when they added gridlock they just recycled Capitaós gun but swapped it to a mag feed instead of a belt
---
This subtle change makes the weapon handle totally differently, which mixes her up a bit
---
Surely they could make similar changes to the weapons they already have in the game without needing more licences
---
It does, it told us we were getting the Kafe rework, Kanal rework and next season we finish the year with Theme Park rework.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
Frost needs her barbed wire with her elite skin. :( I'm so sad about that change. Same with Maestro losing his shield.
---
What do secondary gadget changes have to do with fucking up the game?
---
An ace is five kills.

Didnt know their was a limit, great to know
---
Battlepass needs to cease existing
---
Wait, wait, battlepasses?
---
Yes, a video is out now showing the kanal rework and new ops.
---
I’m pretty much a brand new player (like ~25 hours of game time maybe). 
---
Been playing casuals with a buddy. We run into dudes in legendary skins one tapping from halfway across the map who then flame and I’m like, yeah... yeah man I’m bad at this game, I’m still trying to learn the basics and the map, what do you expect? 
---
Luckily just saying “uhh yeah dude I suck” usually makes them shut up.
---
I'm sure you could find and modify an air tank of a similar size and shape. Something like this: https://randrcountry.co.uk/products/point-two-air-cannister-60cc
---
Just cause they're a company doesn't mean they get a pass on a greedy business path. We can't stop them from making greedy decisions but we can surely call them out on it. They already have a Season Pass, and if this isn't included with that pass, then they're just Double dipping
---
He had claymores too
---
Lol, the PTSD has already set in xD
---
He looks like a smug little bastard don't he?
---
Tomorrow.
---
guess I missed it
---
Cross archon in the creator cup pissed me off to how sweaty he was
---
Hey, I saw your comment on a post yesterday, people replied with flair, username, and everything checksout
---
Some time ago when Mira's elite was leaked from the source code there was also some wording for an Ela elite.
---
Such an fing cringe
---
So who's going to make the 1812 Overture montage of dumb Amaru plays cause Frost and Kapan mains gonna be very happy to trap windows now
---
I run the cam for certain strats. However it’s so easy to spot and get rid of, it only really causes problems in certain places.
---
What is a pistol’s hypothetical RPM, because the wiki says one number and Rogue-9’s chart says another?
---
THunt used to take minutes. Now with higher playercount it should be around 30 seconds for a match.   
---
Are you connecting to your normal datacenter that is closest to your physical location?  
---
EU plays in different times than NA.
---
Memelord strikes again
---
I mean, that’s great and all but it’s completely irrelevant to the post.
---
Besides the team that designs cosmetics has absolutely nothing to do with operator abilities and shit.
---
to the people upset about the battelpass, here are a few of my thoughts on why it's fine.  
---
Siege overall isn't a high income game once you buy it you can play it without missing any content forever, meaning quite a few people will only ever spend 15 bucks on the game, this enables them to make more money which could be spent on more employees for their bigger rework projects (such as barricade breaking apparently)
---
Would I be right in saying that it's coming to the TTS on 19th of August EST time? So me down in Australia won't be able to play it early?
---
Yeah. I still want more guns. Because this game launched with barely any content and Ubisoft continues to dig into peoples pockets. Hell i’d even take some totally made up guns
---
Foto is a 2 speed defender with acog hmmmmmmmmmmm
---
Maestro idk why, but everyone used c4 on Mira bc it works so well with her gadget, and I always use impacts on rook for lines of sight/rotations which are important for acog anchors. Maestro is the only one I’m questioning here
---
You aren't, there's still going to be casual.
---
When is proleague again? Because whenever its on the same time as league of legends pro games those are #1
---
I pay $30 a season I will be as entitled as I want when there is new premium content introduced that is not covered under one of the *5* revenues of monetization I already support.
---
Ok that's a fair argument and something I agree with. Variations could work really well and change the meta. But there is also the risk that the modify a gun and accidentally make something really bad or overpowered. And I think they are just trying to stay in the safe zone of keeping the guns balanced
---
A few years after living in one house in a subdivision, a family friend bought a house in the same subdivision, but it was a mirrored version of our house. No joke, I walked into a wall because my brain was so tripped up.
---
It would be super entertaining to try and watch people try and play maps like this.
---
After all Apex's controversy this week, Ubi is going the extra mile to make their fanbase angry at them anyways? Bold move, dumb but bold.
---
Whats wrong with it being "Overused"? Its cosmetic so why are you so mad about it? It being a "cash grab"? Whats so wrong about supporting the game if you want too? Youre complaining either way you look at it. Youre complaining that theyre giving another option to support the game or youre complaining that its "cash grab"
---
rainbow six siege is now a:
---
- paid game
---
- that has a paid season pass to unlock completely game altering characters
---
- and now a paid battle pass
---
it's too much
---
I saw this and nobody else in the room noticed and looked at me crazy lmao
---
Ubi hasn't done nearly as much for this game as they should have.
---
4th year no training mode, or custom thunt, or anything to really practice on.
---
Recycled content, fuckton of bugs and cheaters, but they have time to add another monetisation method to the game.
---
Abysmal balancing work, "fixes" like jackal having 4 pings instead of 5 and the mistake thats called Phantom sight only shows their superficial balancing decisions.
---
The new attacker looks underwhelming af, def has ton of griefing and tk potential and honestly, i was hyped for attacker especially, but my hype got thrown through the window with recycled guns and how painfully slow her gadget is. It even destroys the window before shes in the room, basically announcing herself 3 seconds before she enters the room. Also frost mats directly below the window still trap her, wtf? 
---
Ubishit, this game is the best product you got, yet you beat us with bad decisions and lack of action, that every positive change, even small ones like adding unranked playlist, will drown out the complaints from the community that constantly calls you out on your dumb shit, because we love the game so much. You abuse us, and you know you can go to town on us because as soon as you do a step forward, you take two steps back.
---
Hopefully an ela recoil buff
---
True, though none of this matters if you’re accurate with your headshots. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I see nothing wrong with what he did. Gamerw are toxic fucks that need to be called out.
---
Didn't even get CGI op trailers this time too.
---
I dont know why it did that... i tried submitting it and kept saying it failed
---
Aw fuck guys I don’t think i can control myself on this one 🥴
---
There's a reason why every operator doesn't have 50 guns because guns are not the focus of the game guns are just a part of the game
---
I understand why they stop adding new weapons, however it takes some uniqueness from new operators, it hard to fell that you are playing with new ones. With the Lion/Finka they add new weapon for them and it was fine, especially that reusing old weapons was understandable because of their special CTU. Also with Warden/Nokk I feel like this is fine too, probably beacause I didn't saw them as a CTU but more for a Special Forces within the whole unit. Not gonna lie, pretty disappointed with this choice.
---
No, I don't mind it either.
---
Villa is the absolute fucking worst though
---
The same dude kept on opening the door for all of the staff. He quickly became a celebrity, thus starting the chants
---
The third floor is just all about run'n gun. This should not belong in a game like R6
---
I'm an xbox lad
---
Pulse's C4 has different markings on the phone then any other defender. If you get close enough to the C4 you can read it with the scope zoom..
---
....like they just did?
---
Okay then you live in la la land
---
that’s what Y4S2 is
---
What the...0 HP ?
---
Half the reason I still play the game and buy the pass is gone. Warden is fucken useless, valkrie is always a better pick over him.
---
Top floor no but the other ones are actually fun to play on
---
Edgar was funny but he was an absolute tyrant on the discord and him and badger dont really talk anymore
---
Hypothetically speaking, how much would you pay for the Battle Pass?
---
Keep in mind that some cosmetics are only purchasable with real money.  Therefore, I feel that the price should be similar or even cheaper since we have to then unlock the stuff.
---
There's a hundred guns in the game do we need like 300 no
---
u can do this ur not stupid. its already on the list as someone requested on another one of my posts like this but i dont want  to do this as i need to record it and its hard a fuck. i dont want to record it cuz i have no ability to edit at all and it means i have to record the entire game play
---
Lag lol check my other recent post
---
The new attacker is not getting good guns lol.
---
They just don't want to fuck up the balancing again, and I'm all for it. Better for them to reuse old weapons that are already balanced, than to have another launch Ela, that takes them 6 months to fix.
---
*Khm* Ghost Recon Wildlands has license for about 200 weapons and Breakpoint will have even more *Khm*
---
Why is BF4 an argument to not recycling weapons?
---
Easy for you to say tachanka main
---
nobody: 
---
ubisoft: we're making a legendary headgear for zofia that makes her look like a fuckin table saw bud
---
Too bad?????!?!?!?
---
They literally said their reason for giving the supernova a suppressor the hell are you talking about.
---
Ok fuck balance
---
Just why
---
Alpha packs can stay. I mean the r6 credits only packs that come with events like the outbreak's ones
---
Wait, the recoil got buffed on console? I'm fairly sure it got nerfed on pc. Didn't know they had different balance changes on that front, though it does make sense
---
Is there really a reason to complain about that? It's natural that Ubisoft is looking for more ways to monetize their game. I would do the same. It's just some cosmetics no interfering with the actual gameplay, not giving any advantage. Actually they deployed about 15 seasons now - all with additional content - absolutely for free. I really appreciate the fact I paid for this game once and I am getting 5 years with new content for free every a few months. And that's why I think blaming Ubi here is a little bit unfair.
---
C4 deals damage on impact, right?... If so I'm pretty sure I might have one ironic idea
---
The new yeet sling! It’s been released to the terrorists.
---
Tbh that’s headgear looks like the no mercy metal facemask from rust
---
I’m done with this, just as I was told if I ever try to argue with someone more retarded then me all they will do will make me more retarded, you are just repeating the same things.
---
It was. I am Not shure in they changed it but as a Hamburger (its the right word) i can toll you that does Not look like Hamburg.
---
Without this damn battlepass they would still continue supporting. This game is making big part of their profits and with that new mtx they are just getting greedy. Dont be foolish
---
Actually Black ops 4 has already done that, but look how that turned out for that game.
---
Skyscraper is okay-tier to ranked
---
Good. It's almost a real competitive game! 4 years to get ranked working somewhat decently....
---
Now, make it so bodies stay once downed and the player leaves and were in bussiness.
---
What's wrong with Chalet?
---
Excuse me? The Vector is amazing. 1200 RPM with low recoil is a headshot machine
---
Opening the hatches from below is still gunna make a lot of noise.
---
Yea I guess I’m really in the minority about not giving a shit about new guns 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Who's Glaz?
---
Or they know statistics to their own guns what's your status stick into the game and give it some numbers
---
Okay this stick fires acorns at 900 rounds per minute but it does 26.
---
And then there's a banana that fire 38 damage then 600
---
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
---
The point of the game is guns are part of it they're not the main reason the gadgets are
---
This is awesome. Been a big problem for a long time. I hope people will be more willing to play casual if they don’t have time for a full ranked match.
---
It happens to me all the time and I think they secretly changed the hit boxes because I get random head shots from shooting their feet and non head shots when I shoot their head some times.
---
Just ban her lmao
---
How
---
If so we would only see modified m4's everywhere.
---
They just announced that it is
---
Mexico and Peru
---
As it should be
---
You don't understand: Ubisoft only has SOME of the money, they want ALL of the money. That's why they want 6 different types of monetization.
---
Eww who tf still plays secure
---
Thoughts on any of the gadget changes?
---
They made a map with four fucking floors and most of the sites are tiny and very awkward
---
Wait, they nerget super90?
---
&gt; Map pool changes: removed Hereford Base, Themepark, and Fortress
---
made a post with these three maps and yall roasted me. now they gone. HA
---
He did nothing wrong.  All the articles about it leave out basically all the context.
---
Still believe it's real? Now that everything is revealed you can see it was clearly fake.
---
Damn it I hate battlepasses
---
Some attacker , are you kidding ?
---
The absolute mad lad. He is truly the meme lord we deserve.
---
I think he’s gone on record saying gaming/streaming/YouTube are all things he does outside of his day job. 
---
Also praise be upon LordHeadass
---
I'm not arguing you're the one with the banana that's thinks it's more important than everybody else's banana
---
You shot below his head
---
I’d argue that the SMG-12 and Bearing 9 also have very difficult recoil patterns
---
Probably
---
Man.. You sound like me!  Finaly someone who sees the game for what it is....
---
Yes I get it, and I too would like new weapons but of course unless Ubisoft really felt like it, they aren’t going to add new weapons until maybe what next year or something. All I’m saying is just to use Counter Terrorist Groups that have the same weapons that are already in game that way it at least makes sense.
---
Ok go ahead and complain that you have the option to support the game. Youre bitching like all the other 4.2k people bc they think theyre entilted. Go ahead and call me retarded but atleast Im not bitching about something retarded that doesnt affect or effect me or my gameplay in game. Legit delete this dumb ass post dude.
---
Go to their pockets to fund on of them stupid animated shorts apparently
---
If this isn’t a joke then he’s an spetsnaz attacker who’s gadget is a thermal scope
---
It's a lot easier to balance when everybody knows the guns in the game
---
It does now, it's being added in the new season
---
That doesnt make him fake though
---
Not true they are removing maps from the casual pool. Says it above.
---
I believe I heard that they also have to pay licensing for new guns
---
The issue is the bait and switch that ubisoft did with the year 4 season pass. They presented burnt horizon and everything was normal, new map, new operators and new guns. Then after they sell everyone a season pass they then go and start making excuses for why they cant release new weapons, tell us the last 3 seasons maps will just be reworks.
---
The first season of recycled weapons relased with 2 operators that were both horrible. A 3 armour defender without an acog and a 2 2 attacker without an acog. Get about halfway into the season and Ubisoft releases the win delta statistics and cone to find out that they are the second worst in their side. Warden is slightly better and more impactful than tachanka, and nok is slightly better than glazz who got nerfed to the point he was worthless. So yeah people have a right to be a little skeptical and outraged.
---
Didn't know pro league players were in the inferior ranks
---
So they’re getting rid of Glaz’s smokes or his claymore?
---
Yah, people will definitely post it on YouTube or reddit. There is no way UBI can enforce the lore to be viewable by premium members only.
---
I just think it's cheesy
---
Oh god i hope this isn't right . I don't wanna see secondary SMG meta all over again
---
I'd buy their business and make console mnk
---
Thanks Kanye. Very cool
---
fair enough.
---
Beautiful look up, same thing is for the invitational charm, quality is improving guys.
---
Plain and simple, the game gets stale. The enjoyment of the user is still necessary to the.. y'know, the enjoyment of the player lol. Just because you don't think so doesn't mean you should dismiss it.
---
Definitely equally, gadgets are  mostly pointless if you dont have a gun to use with them and siege is just a boring shooter without gadgets.
---
Maybe they will make the season pass a bit more expensive. Like 5€/$ or whatever. And the stand alone BP will cost 10€ or $ or whatever currency. I hope you get the idea. Season Pass including battlepass: 35€. Battlepass stand alone: 10€
---
Its a tactical shooter what did you expect would happen if you're matched with random people, Of course it wont be cohesive. ~~Lots of toxic and uncommunicative people solo queue because nobody wants them on their team~~
---
Whats funnier then 26? 24
---
Because it adds more variety? A good deal of the guns being reused aren't bad, just out shined by the other options. IQ has 3 good-great guns, but 2 of them hardly see any play because the 552 is just better. The G8 isn't a bad weapon (not to mention being buffed) it's just not as good as the 552. Same thing with the P229, not bad, but most people opt to use the bearing. 
---
Not to mention, people use the Vector, TSCG, ITA12s and SMG-11 so it's not like they're only giving bad guns. The vector and TSCG are two of the best guns on def. 
---
Giving a new OP the FMG wasn't a bad idea, putting it on Nokk was however.
---
Ash can make 5 holes you can walk through, Hibana can make 3 “walk-through” holes, a crouch hole and a peek hole
---
It has that one VERY broken spawn peek, but other than that it's a fine map. Skyscraper can fucking go tho.
---
Search bar man
---
Because up till now they didnt do anything to bad other than being late to fix some VERY OBVIOUS bugs
---
None it is insensitive and I’m not saying they should leave, but Publishers are notorious for pushing stupid shit for their Devs to push to make money, things that the Devs may not agree with, but have to. The Devs are subject to their publisher. EA is a big dog, you can’t just find another Publisher. They have to deal with having EA, frankly because it doesnt appear that they have a choice. 
---
People will always get mad at the wrong people for wrong reasons. Right now, I don’t believe that people are mad at Respawn for the wrong reasons.
---
Agreed.
---
Guns have nothing to do with the season pass guns are not included in the season pass only operators that are and then the little other benefits not even maps are included
---
You are paying for a 7-Day exclusivity and instant unlock of brand new operators.
---
Exclusive skins for operators not their guns you get one universal skin.
---
You get discounts and more renown.
---
It does not say new guns anywhere included in the season pass.
---
What a mad lad
---
I just hate chalet because every site feels impossible to defend, and the two best sites feel impossible to attack. I know that sounds kinda weird but i just cant find a strat that works on that map. The only way i feel i ever win is by getting picks early or if the other team is awful.
---
In casual if you join mid game the rest of the team has a tendency to kick because it takes too long to load in. Other times is prob a 4 stack fucking around in casual.
---
I keep saying that, but people seem only to notice that Warden is luckluster (he is..) but completely overlook Nokk.
---
She brings nothing to the team, her weapon choices are bad (except for the Deagle, maybe?) and her gadget is.. meh. It's good in concept but it's not very impactful and she brings no utility to the table.
---
Looks pretty good to me, well done!
---
Honestly I just want to see what the Black Mirror looks like
---
**RUSSOOOOOO**
---
**YOU HEAR MEE?**
---
**I'M GONNA WATCH YOU DIEEE**
---
But what if it's not an answer what if it's a tear in the space-time continuum
---
What the fuck 2!
---
I told you in the post: when i ads with a 1x optic it buttfucks the sens.
---
I'd say just shoot him at round start and leave
---
Definitely! A strong gun with a strong gadget would definitely be too OP. Meanwhile, a weak gun with a weak gadget would be too weak.
---
So your argument regarding longevity and new guns are... what exactly? You still haven't answered me yet.
---
You can hear Nokk, if she's sprinting. Which you would have to be doing if you wanted to get to the objective in time before you gadget runs out lol, which is what we're talking about. And that's assuming there's no roamers. Like this whole argument is making me scratch my head, to be honest
---
Hello ukwargrave, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Whoa
---
Hit the woah
---
It’s like the 4th post down in hot posts
---
what arre you talking about its already in the store
---
People need to stop buying this shit period. Fucking pisses me off, they add it became morons eat it up.
---
Playing warden is equivalent to throwing. That’s just my opinion
---
Man my favorite thing about new ops are the new weapons I like to see new I know gadgets are new but that's only 1/2 an operator
---
That is likeness
---
Every gun company is different there is a reason why we don't have anything that resembles a Glock
---
god yes i see some good patterns!
---
i farmed 150k renown because i hoped for some sick skins like we had this season
---
Hello michnaj, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
If you are on console then it's MnK users.
---
Operators are kinda useless without guns fella hence why when you buy one they come with a few guns.
---
I didn't like the specific selection, but I'm 100% fine with using existing weapons.  Some ops have great weapons that can be easily used on other ops - like the Vector that the new defense op is getting.
---
Yeah, definitely not, I agree! Which is why I'm trying to understand others POV. From my POV, the new gadgets bring new ways to attack a site, but a new gun does not bring anything to the table.
---
If what someone wants is a strong gun, then they can reuse a strong gun, but a new strong gun and an old strong gun is no different.
---
Meanwhile Destiny 2 is gonna be 150gb after Moon’s Haunted DLC
---
&gt; Better for them to reuse old weapons that are already balanced
---
except the weapons are balanced around the operators that use them, so recycling weapons inherently makes balancing weapons harder
---
it would be very easy for them to quickly make adjustments to weapons to rebalance them but they dont... hmm... I bet the reason has *something* to do with the actual reason they're not adding new weapons in the first place 🤔
---
Well I'm glad I'm not appetizing to you
---
They aren't selling any single item for a "few hundred dollars". You can buy loot boxes to hopefully get the axe for Bloodhound, and they say it can c ost you $170. That's not a few hundred, it's not even a couple hundred.
---
From the videos with the new operators, the rework is mostly the same as Kafe, they didn't change it like Hereford but they also made a couple changes. I was pretty critical of the Kafe rework when I first seen it considering what they did to my favorite map, but I actually like it, and I'm feeling pretty good about the Kanal rework.
---
I cant believe they removed Theme Park and Fortress and not Skycraper and Chalet, the most unbalanced maps
---
•_•
---
So don't play it, it doesn't change casual at all. Why do you care that they added it of you can ignore it, it didn't take anything away. Do you think they decreased casual map pool because of it?
---
It’s a pretty easy attack in comparison to Hereford, Kafe, Chalet,
---
*Glock would like a word*
---
I’m Plat 1.
---
The survivor looks interesting
---
It looks like these new operators are getting guns so I don't see where your argument comes from they're still getting guns
---
it takes fucking nothing from the players. free players get stuff from this, from the free track! if you don't want to buy the pass then fucking don't!
---
He was never meant to have impacts.  While in development, the most recent deplorable shield glitch came to be and they knew they couldn’t release him with only one secondary gadget so they tossed in impacts and said he would receive his shield at a later date.
---
Zofia or Kaid
---
Well then I'm a 5000
---
It’s all about the engine and servers. Two completely different games and companies.
---
I'm not saying it's a balanced map. I'm saying it's way more balanced and easier to attack than Theme Park. Attacking Theme Park is quite limited and it's whole design just doesn't work in a game like siege. It's the same with fortress too. Fortress is a terrible map that is really hard to attack. Skyscraper is much easier to attack. For example let's take karaoke/tea vs drug. Drug you have the window, restroom, hatch/cafe above, and the main lobby area to push into. For Karaoke/tea, you can push from terrace, geisha, either staircase, tea doorway, and both windows. Theme park and fortress are just not balanced at all.
---
Not really, the vast majority of operators only have pistols, and only 1 operator has a special secondary in this, and half of that is because she'd be grossly underpowered if she wasn't able to open up hatches from below.
---

They will take out maps which I won’t be able to play neither in casual or unranked. That is straight up BS.
---
Look at this freeloader here!
---
thats why i have ectoplasm lmao
---
Me too baby
---
I think a lot of people who say he’ll be worse after his impacts are removed are forgetting that he was never meant to have them in the first place.
---
New defender looks op because the explosion lasts too long, and he has three of them. If they are blocking a route come near the rounds end the defenders will be laughing
---
Nah
---
yeah for a period of time. now it isn’t free
---

No, retard you have to get all the items for the OPTION to buy the Axe, there is no chance you dont pull it from one of the iron crown boxes. You LITERALLY have to buy evrey box to BUY the axe

Quarantine seems based off of Outbreak. I believe that Quarantine is going to greatly expand on it more that the outbreak event could so it might be promotional content too.

Well you don't really have to care about it..but are you really beliving that Ubisoft doesn't have the money to buy licenses ? There's plenty of guns in Ghost Recon that aren't in R6 for example...its laziness and grabbing all the money on your way out...Sure for some its no big deal..for some it is.
---
And I'm sorry if I suddenly don't get the "usual" load of content (I know new guns were never part of the season pass or promised or anything) but I still paid the same amount of money in good faith that "quality" will continue as expected I kind of feel...taken advantage of ...100 guns or not is no excuse to just "randomly" unannounced stop adding new guns...why not just copy over some Ghost Recon guns this just seems like a cashgrab / reduced dev team and if thats the case just be up front about it ..like during the panel the guy said "its another way of monetization"regarding the battlepass and im OK with that..he was honest...be honest.

If Battlepass won't be included in season pass - R6 will be oficially most monetized game on current market

So at this moment we have:
---
Renown and R6 points:
---
-skins for everything
---
-charms
---
-operators
---
Paywall:
---
-renown boosters
---
-elite sets
---
-limited time lootbox colections
---
-season pass
---
All this in game priced as AAA. Season pass is valid one year and is priced as AAA as well, providing less digital content than it should for sure.
---
And now battlepass is revealed. Yet again, only with cosmetics - but showing how tricky Ubi turned experimental tactical shooter into cash machine.
---
Don't book it as a rant, just my thoughts.
---
Nice.
---
I bought Y1-2-3 season pass but before Y4 and having 250k renown I said fuck it
---
Why the fuck they add a battle pass!?
---
I honestly could care less lol, the licensing problem makes sense too
