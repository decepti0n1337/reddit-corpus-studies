No I am just want to have a discussion about him see if he needs a buff or nerf

Fantastic, just remember to take it a step at a time. Whenever I did mine it took me about 5 days in total, so just go slow to make sure it comes out perfect! Let me know know how it comes out!

So it takes longer for the AUG to kill someone with bodyshots than the MP5K?
---
yah its not the injury its the fact that i played while on oxycodone
---
Slap now
---
Some pretty _cool_ jams, from a pretty _chill_ guy are hapoening. (I'm not sorry. :))
---
I dont fuggin know im just guessing
---
Damnnnnn, I've been playing since Y3S2 and have it on Bandit MP7, GIGN Revolver, and IQ's LMG
---
There's not that many M&amp;K users than people make it seem like. Often people just accuse someone of using M&amp;K when they actually just use an Elite/Pro controller or high sensitivity.
---
I hardly ever see any.
---
To be honest I think alibi is a great way to teach people to check your target before shooting it‚Äôs probably stopped me from accidentally team killing
---
Why comment if you don‚Äôt know? Lmao

yeah, the developers themselves

I'll forgive you this one time since you're the lord and all haha

the cap is set to 144 fps
---
I‚Äôm a total noob here... how do y‚Äôall have your operator mains next to your names ?
---
It's a 17+ ESRB and ubisoft tries to lure the kids to sell more, they should make another game and not wipe out Tom Clancys memory.

Just make sure to give it a good slap when your done

He was my first to play or buy I forgot but I loved him then I got my first black ice skin on him and it was a wrap

Anyone who unironically thinks this game is serious or realistic may need to have a long hard thing about things.

Also what sort of a masochist uses green text on a red background?

This would be perfect for the Dooo! Honestly, might have to message him about it...

Can ubisoft fucking ban children already ? Yeah TAKE MY PERSONAL ID INFORMATION AS LONG AS YOU GET FUCKING 8 YEAR OLD KEVION HOOKED UP ON MONSTER BANNED ! Because you clearly know that the fucking parents dont care !

How tf do you get banned from a single player game

Thank you

How long did it take you to make it

No but seriously that is cool

That's epic! Do you play bass too?

Thanks

Doesn't need it. If you don't use iron sights on the 417 you're weak.

Just as long as you dont q in rnaekd whiel nto basically knwoign the maps and callouts as you and your teammates wil nto have a good time as it gets quite heate adn toxic so i woudl say stic kor quick and unraked till lvl 45-50 then  join the r6 reddit discord ( [https://discord.gg/rainbow6](https://discord.gg/rainbow6) ) and 5 stack ur hearts content away this will also help you improve as i anyone is toxic u can report them but most people are freindly and will hel u out my man.

Dude thats pretty damn sick

Ppl who use mouse and keyboard on console are just gae. No wonder all of us are silver

You might have to check it yourself

It's just weird to see an empty map from the bottom. When was this game made?
---
That‚Äôs the coolest looking LP I‚Äôve seen in ages, holy fuck man. Great job! Makes my LP look bland as hell
---
My cpu is at 100 percent and my GPUs like 60
---
I think it would be fine if you play newcomer mode. There are only 3 maps so you'll learn them quite fast. And as you're playing with other new players they won't be bothered. Just be aware that there are quite some smurfs in the newcomer mode.
---
Get an i7 or higher
---
idk today?
---
did the kid say anthing after that lmao
---
Hmm. Well idk what to tell you. My only suggestion would be to bump up your GPU. But I don't know TOO much about PCs
---
absolutely do!
---
Thx
---
ubi should add a voice chat ban for people like that. nice ace btw i never could‚Äôve pulled that off

Damn that‚Äôs cool. Love the bridge and pickups!

Really appreciate it! Glad everyone loves it!! This really made my day!

nice

This has only ever happened to me maybe 2 times before, but HOT GOLD does it feel good..

If you never jump in you aren't ever going to learn more. If someone is being a cunt, mute them. Chat mute them fi youre on PC too. Just focus on improving and playing your game, man. Casual and new comers is fine for people getting into the game.

I mean either one works right you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell from Ela considering she dies her hair most the time

New to siege, and what‚Äôs a copper?
---
If you‚Äôre not sniffing feet there‚Äôs no point in playing jackal
---
Have you played 035 on it yet?????
---
It was stolen to begin with, from some Twitter account that doesn't even speak English. So be quiet saying I stole it. I cited the original stolen one.
---
You got a point
---
I love how you‚Äôre post is actually looking for a team, yet some dude earlier up was simply asking if he is brand new to the game if it‚Äôs fine if he just jumps straight into casual. Stupid ass shitty autobot shut him down for ‚Äútrying to recruit a team or looking for a team‚Äù. 
---
Love this sub. (You did nothing wrong, btw).
---
Is every op in order or just bunched up in a tier with no specific order?
---
Thanks for the replies everyone! I'm looking forward to getting in the game!

I am too savage on reposters to be even a mod . So no , i can't be a mod :)

Excuse my skepticism but wasn‚Äôt this on Stone Mountain 64?

Shes a good op so you got really lucky fam
---
Could you hypothetically do the exact same pattern but with orange black and red for a cracked lava look?
---
No specific order inside the tiers.
---
Pulse should be higher
---
I agree
---
Yes, that would look great. Might have to try that next!

Ya... and no one is in pro league.,, he gets banned rarely in ranked even in plat 2-plat 1. Don‚Äôt be an ass

Thanks I‚Äôve been playing pretty aggressive with her is that right

100% agree

I prefer red ice from Detroit become human,, but its still cool tho

&gt;Although I think that in-game shop should be bit cheaper.

Wouldn't mind, tbh. But the 2400+270 deal is still pretty neat.

I think this is a White mask religion.

Oh god. One time I got a kid(unknown nationality, but not english speaking) making sex noises, and another kid (a little older) in the lobby cursing at him, but then fucking joining in, my sister walked into the room and said she thought I was watching porn and laughed with me, it was ranked.

I didn‚Äôt mute anything ? Literally just started the game and this happened.

you and me both üòî

lets get black ice smg 12 woo woo woo

For future reference you can edit the comment with the pencil
---
I fully agree
---
there's nothing there because the only reason those buttons are there are to mute people; there would be no point to mute yourself
---
Give them an Uzi
---
imo that probably wouldn‚Äôt happen. people were constantly finding a way onto certain roofs and reinforcing the hatches until ubi finally managed to put a stop to it
---
YES

If you buy Siege on Steam you‚Äôll need to have both Steam and Uplay installed to play it.

Well done I like it

I understood it when I was, say 11. That voice really ticks people off. When I heard it just now, I had the instinct to just cause pain, I hated hearing it so much.

That's great! How'd you do that black ice finish

My RTX 2060 has a metal plate on top of it as a ‚Äúcool‚Äù design feature by MSI. If I touched it my hand would melt.

That‚Äôs not a one tap u fired more then 1 bullet just saying
---
I‚Äôd say use it anyways. If the opponent is paying attention enough to notice subtle details on your skin, they will notice the quality differences between alibi‚Äôs model and the prisma‚Äôs. For example alibi‚Äôs goggles are see through on her model but on the prisma they are opaque.
---
But can you spawn peek with it?
---
Nah this happened yesterday
---
It‚Äôs a 102 gn download because you checked ‚Äúultra hd textures‚Äù btw. It‚Äôs still 70gb without though lol
---
Thats fair, srry for being cringe
---
just learn to play what you buy, easy
---
And even if you do, most people don't so it's basically useless
---
I prefer to use idiotic teammates who rush in and then instantly die to find where defenders are
---
I want to disagree but not in a disrespectful manner. This game has always been focused around team play my problem would be if they added this then what would the point of playing regular ranked would be. Maybe if you get a separate rank for playing solo but even then that, to me personally, feels just wrong in a way.
---
He was helping the enemy team win. AKA throwing matches
---
Very sexy guitar amigo
---
Right, friend. *wink
---
When you get one kill but thats more than your team combined.
---
Anytime you make an LFG post. Put your region in it
---
i spy with my little eye a battle royale player
---
Doc and his good damn spawn peaks Every round enemy outside LEMME GUESS GOD DAMN DOC if his on your team may aswell be a damn 4v5, the worst part is starting on copper you are screwed and if you mess up and de rank to copper GUESS WHAT YA SCREWED. Either way bend over open ya ass cause youre about to cop the long hard dick of a smurf dick.
---
Unless it was ranked or unranked I don't see the problem but even so you can't get banned for that
---
It‚Äôs not a banable offense not like your playing in pro league in the game
---
Kaid,but I can add more operators too.Tbh doesnt sound that great but ok
---
It‚Äôs also just kinda a shitty thing to do. Even if it‚Äôs Casual helping the other team win is just a dick move
---
The best advice is always stop caring about your rank and play ranked
---
sans is that you?
---
The only issue with the ‚Äújust join another lobby‚Äù thing is that I am a very impatient man, and the vote to kick option is used for toxicity 9 outta 10 times so I vote to remove it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to fook spiders, I‚Äôm here to be licked by rook‚Äôs p90‚Äù

Also the ‚ÄúI trust my teammates joke‚Äù
---
I got out into a 2-1 match point as a brand new player and my entire team left. It was a 1v5 with no idea how the other team plays
---
Yeah there's no excuse for it but no one can tell if they're just having a bad game or throwing unless you admit to it
---
You realize mnk don‚Äôt give you major advantages over a game pad the only thing a mouse offers is quicker flicks
---
Hold up....the fuck?! Gotta sight your gun in I guess lmao
---
üóøüóø
---
They're multiplying
---
I guess mute got to server room
---
game never had mnk support for console. you go buy an adapter to trick the console into thinking you are using a controller. it's really easy to do and gives you an inherit advantage so there's really no reason not to unless you can't afford the adapter
---
Over a controller? It‚Äôs a huge advantage. Recoup control, flicks, rotation, all huge advantages.
---
Do you have a adapter I was playing the Xbox version of stellaris and I wanted to to use a mouse I needed to get an adapter to make it work
---
I respect you slightly less now
---
There is no vote kick option in unranked and ranked. Go play it.
---
^ Doesn't change the fact there should be a soloqueue tho.
---
Both the PS5 and Xbox are said to be fully backwards compatible with current gen games, so there will be no need to transfer accounts  as you install the game on the new console and just continue on the same account.
---
This is so fire IQ I love uü§§
---
I mean I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt a problem because I agree with you it is . Like when I play games I may hear a sound that sounds like it‚Äôs above when it‚Äôs actually a floor below or a sound could sound like it‚Äôs in front of you when it‚Äôs behind you . It just sounds stupid to dedicated a whole season again to patching sound when they could just do this and also release new content .
---
Is this console or do you just play on PC with a controller? Hacking doesn‚Äôt exist on next gen consoles
---
It's been old for a while
---
This year was wuch bullshit for people whp already have all ops. Cmon ubi just give me the renown and let me buy what i want with it instead of shoving freakin mint monty down my ass
---
I‚Äôm on console and that‚Äôs what confused me
---
Yeah but it gives you a 100 renown when you can do it for just a minute on classic say . Whereas you could spend 12 minutes on a causal and get 200 renown if you win so it‚Äôs quicker renown .
---
Seems legit monty and rook same team
---
God its hard to watch console players..
---
Game probably just had a moment, it‚Äôs happened to me when I join in progress but not this extreme
---
3 minutes for queuing? Your complaining about that?
---
Mozzie
---
This is desync because you joined mid match
---
But is it as much fun. Not really
---
Ah ok thanks
---
If you like roaming a lot get Vigil. If you like to play different ways, roaming, lurking, and anchor. Mozzie is a great all rounder
---
Get a pc
---
I see some bias by your name ü§î

Nah I had a leaver three games in a row, one guy was just like "Sorry guys I have to take a shit" and just left.
---
No one hates jackal. People just know how powerful he is.
---
Looks great!!, Think it would look great with some clear coat on it though, looks a little unfinished when I look closely. (not trying to be mean I absolutely love it!)
---
What color blue did you use?
---
I was scrolling on r/all and saw this abomination. Honestly would love to erase it from my memory. It doesn't look frozen, it looks like you can tape out a leaf but can't be fucked to tape the pick ups or knobs or bridge.  It's a fail to anyone without R6 colored glasses. Sorry all these compliments have gone to your head. It looks bad. Someone has to fuckin say it.
---
Cool
---
With my luck, my black ice skin would be for a Squire Strat.
---
Possibly
---
something is mentally wrong with you retard that's why I edited, Oh you expect me to not retaliate bitch you tried it
---
Nah it‚Äôs boring as fuck but if you want to get a new op or a seasonal skin or something it‚Äôs not a bad idea to do .
---
This dude mad lol
---
How do you do, fellow warden main?
---
yes and give users access to a program like Valve Hammer Editor and let me make de_dust2
---
I free hand painted the leaf and meant to paint the pickups, knobs, and bridge. Again, I would absolutely love to see you paint anything just so I can call it garbage.
---
I got clash from my pack and was excited to try her
---
But ohh wait
---
I be 
---
Getting headshots with the MPX
---
Just look at the TSM rec game from last week, vigil ban had a massive impact on bank.
---
that's not what hacking looks like
---
that's what a buggy spectating cam looks like
---
Have they not said multiple times that they try to avoid enabling spawn peaking? So, why would Clash get an ACOG? And aren‚Äôt they moving down a path of trying to remove/nerf ACOG‚Äôs power in game? All of these suggestions seem kind of counter-intuitive to what the team has been trying to do
---
Engine doesn‚Äôt support it and no one would be able to actually create a good map in this game
---
Lmao
---
Nah bro he cheati
---
Damn my brain just broke from stupidity
---
This guy really just took a shitpost seriously and wrote a full paragraph rebuttal saying how clash Acog is bad lmao .
---
I only do kovaaks and t-hunt. Learn how to convert your sensitivity on [mouseseneitivity.com](https://mouseseneitivity.com) for kovaaks (for hipfire, holo and ACOG) and dont listen to all the subreddits about how to convert your sens, they have no clue what they are on about. It'll put you back like 10-20 USD but if you want to improve its worth the money.
---
Black beard
---
What level are you? 5 operators is ridiculously low. Buy the operator year bundles or at least get the version of the game with all the ops for 5 extra dollars. No operator is perfect, you need a diverse collection for all the different types of maps and objectives. Just pay the extra $5 and buy the base 20.
---
Oh no
---
I don't remember Ubisoft ever saying anything about, "enabling spawn peaking" If that was the case, goyo wouldn't have gotten an acog on one of his guns last season.

Buck and Maverick are powerful utility ops

## Christmas Holiday free op pack is not working on xbox one (please help)
---
&gt;So on my xbox account I tried opening, quitting, signing out while in the game menu, quitting the game, opening and quitting the ubi app, playing a local game, but too no avail I can't get the free pack to come up. My brother is about to download the game and play it for the first time but I'm worried he won't be able to see it. Is there something I'm doing wrong?
---
True, and that upsets me. Why should 0.01% of the player population decide what is balanced and what isn't. Nook would not be OP with an assualt rifle, that's BS.
---
Can I pay you for your services?
---
Fuck you
---
There‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt  been any info since e3. This is their website and the Twitter for the game has been pretty quiet and less than 1k followers. Ubisoft hasn‚Äôt promoted the game at all 
---
https://www.elitesquadgame.com
---
I believe that's covered under "Thermite/Thatcher mains".
---
Most would.
---
As someone who does most of his playing late at night I can confirm this is about half my cas matches
---
Kek. What‚Äôs your uplay?
---
Sit down and try to find the natural angle for your hand. Remember how you generally write with your fist angled inwards? Same for moise and keyboard. Placing it at the natural arm angle reduces strain and reduces risk of carpel tunnel and other deadly disorders.
---
I know it was a big deal upon announcement. That was the last I heard of it though.
---
For the last time, CAN I HAVE YOUR MOM?
---
A) you shouldn‚Äôt be playing ranked yet
---
B)you most definitely do not know the maps well enough to be a good squad member. 
---
C)you should only play ranked once you learn a good Chunk of the maps do you can be somewhat helpful to a team.
---
No one is gonna want a whiny lvl 40 unless you can show something, usually kd or win rate with you have neither so just stick to learning the maps and not ruin other people‚Äôs experience just because you wanted to play ranked but don‚Äôt know anything about the maps or what not.

I know I‚Äôm just messing with you. It‚Äôs a pretty cool thought. I wonder if it was done on purpose or not. Hopefully it was done on purpose lol

Let‚Äôs just say people with hate you for it

Uhhh u mean by open the UPnP ? or something like that ? or just contact them
---
PRETTY THWICC
---
Thicc and quicc
---
I mean if youre tryin to learn the vertical spots on a map this is a start. Or if ash still has the same loadout from your last ranked game. Dont be a cunt.
---
That simply isn't true. In the event of a 5 minute stalemate, it follows the rules of round draws; defending team wins, because attackers failed to complete the objective.
---
UNLIMITED POWER

This is r/nextfuckinglevel

I'm consistently confused by how this system confuses people...

A cheater was on your team.

It looks like an undersexualized shadman drawing, which made me crack up. I love the artwork though man! You're really good at it!
---
Good idea, i would also add if they are dead their portrait looks gray.
---
Is he using a controller or smth?
---
Tyty
---
People who do run outs like this at the start of the game ruin it for me. Sure it‚Äôs a strategy and a tactic to surprise the attackers but it just ruins the idea that it‚Äôs a team based breach and defend an objective game.
---
LOL My friends first time we were also on defense but as soon as we spawned he just shot our kapkan "Because his logo was red"
---
Even so you need to have aim.
---
The *R O U N D E R* the better

Looks more like pyro from tf2 and given how many memes related to tf2 i saw there, i'm 99.9% sure that this is pyro

I heard him shooting, thinks you need new headphones bro
---
Nah, bought from Steam. He's in DE for study.
---
Yea but it sounds like it‚Äôs much further away than it should be. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint where he was exactly because of that.
---
Holy shit ranked must be fun to you now xD
---
This is the most stupid thing I‚Äôve heard so far this week.
---
There was no melee animation at any point though
---
Will lose everything.
---
You can make a new account and and buy the game.  Keeping two accounts.
---
Or you can contact support ask them to remove the game from you account and then buy it in English.
---
Don't buy it from a key reseller. Supporting credit card fraud.
---
Your friend is silly then, there is a language option in the main menu
---
This has been asked this day release day of Rainbow Six, I'm surprised they have yet to implement it
---
Well I have started to do that but still suck at the game
---
I prefer quickness over thiccness

Just contact them and ask if your speed is being throttled

The best part is that 99% of those post are fake or a plat 1 goofing around lmao

Yeeeeees i hope they fix that i have 2 friends from England and thay sound the same i cant tell them apart lol
---
looks like me with 900h+
---
I had the opposite situation.  
---
I shot a part of skylights glass after enemy ran away but I still managed to kill him with a head shot.
---
Honestly better than I was hen I started nice job
---
Bruh, it's not the language. He has the Russian version installed in his laptop, but he bought another one (english version). And for some reason if he directly starts the game, it needs the CD key. Ubi gave him a workaround and it solved the problem, but it takes so much time and very impractical (verifying game cache in Steam take years).
---
yeah let's go with that
---
This is so cool. Nice job!
---
Bloody hell
---
please do i need to make some milk.
---
I like both and move between them. With mozzie you can provide Intel and counter Thermite, Fuze, ect if you get a shock drone. You have good guns and a nitro. I typically use Mozzie on bottom or middle sights. Vigil has a weaker ability but superior weapons and impacts. He makes a better roamer but mozzie is a better valk alternative. Honestly I'd go with vigil. Hope this helps
---
Awesome!
---
This is making me want to turn the discord overlay on just to try testing
---
Hmm I guess they should? Give them a shitton of life but at least make it a little bit useful to shoot at it
---
I would love to see NVIDIA highlight integration in Siege.
---
Nice fps bro
---
I‚Äôm genuinely scared of what I just witnessed
---
shotgun+console
---
Fuze is op in hostage. Easy 6k rounds
---
Oh no, he's retarded.
---
Well, just PM I've pretty interested!
---
Vigil imo, was my main for ages
---
Also u and kapkan are loud af when sprinting im surprised they didnt hear u coming down the stairs and prefire smh literal bots. Congrats on the ace tho with the P90 no less.
---
What the fr*ck
---
What's in the canister??
---
Yea, it‚Äôs pretty rad
---
How dense are you if you call this a good play? The guy just walks around while the enemy get in  the room one by one...
---
No, cos then that makes the shield moot, shields are a different type of operator, they have nerfed ADS times and nerfed speed, but shields shouldn't cause an issue most of the time unless you're coming up against someone who actually knows how to use a shield, guy in the pic didn't have a clue how to use a shield, otherwise he just wouldve pushed the defender
---
I'd pay for connection based casual

I‚Äôm guessing the 2.5 w/l with and k/d. All I got to see was the joining ongoing match screen. And I was out.

Or when my gun fire sounds distant and the reload sound doesn‚Äôt exist. So fucking annoying and happens way too often.

"But why? Why would you do that?"

Because Ubisoft keep crippling her

It's cool

I am still pretty noob.. level 5‚Äôish. What does hibanas special shit do?

damn boi she *THICK*

To be fair joining an ongoing match takes way too long. I easily load twice as long as when I'm joining a new game.

Check before comment. Literally nothing on your link.

Basically. Ur copper
---
there‚Äôs no draws now.. how did you both get a point? tachanka mains are always fishy
---
They break your silhouette so you're harder to spot in dark.
---
Pretty much in ranked was thatcher or Monty on attack.
---
There's always a stupid idiot that doesn't even know how to read and craves a single kill he won't get on a normal round.

Thanks, only really started playing a couple of months ago so at this stage I‚Äôll take all the ugly clutches I can get

Yeah all cool except when trolls trap your team in the room with that stuff...
---
I am new and got the game for Christmas. Can you please explain to me what free weekend is.
---
I may have been playing for years now but I still play like a new player.
---
The fork is an arm. The top right leg of the table is the second arm. The two bottom legs of the table are the legs. The cup and knife are the eyes and the plate is the mouth. I've always seen this table as a face. Never ever questioning it in my life. Been playing since beta and never realized it was a table lol. I still see it as a face tho instead of a table. I'm happy about that. I like it as a face.
---
Using Hibana gadget is usually considered a noob thing
---
Good Job!
---
#JustFavelaThings
---
I actually put x kairos‚Äò on multiple windows/doors at the same time and then blow it to breach multiple places at once. It‚Äôs actually quite effective
---
So far in all of my free weekends ive seen : Mira trying to put her mirror on a window barricade, jager successfully doing it and a guy not shooting at enemies because he thought that we are his enemies
---
I don't even play siege on console
---
Howdy
---
Since the retards that make posts like these are matched together with new players, wouldn't that mean they got shit mmr anyway?
---
Kill or die
---
Lynx Africa &gt;
---
Nice shootin Tex
---
Some new players are clueless on how to properly use the ops and their gadgets so for example, as Hibana they will use the X-Kairos on barricades instead of walls
---
I was getting ready to say .300 Winchester but then realized you were maverick
---
Probably not the best tutorial but still really helpful to learn those routines before going to a game. It will help people save a lot of time in the beginning of rounds.
---
I at least had the issue of wasting a lot of time on every round so that I was only ready after like 20 seconds of the enemy spawning. It caused me to die to early pushers a lot.
---
It doesn‚Äôt tho. Every time I join a match in progress, I‚Äôm spectating my teammates walking through barricades and soft walls.
---
Oh okay, but well that‚Äôs not really their fault, I mean they‚Äôre new
---
Dude thhhhhhhhhick
---
Y‚Äôall mind if I *SNEEK*
---
yes
---
Yeah I know, I was like that when I started too
---
Siege isn't a casual game. Sure people meme and have fun, but at the end of the day its an uber-competitive game environment. That's why they changed it to Quick Match, even if it is a superficial gesture.
---
the reason i quit playing this game after 2500hours its just to much bs 
---
you can clearly see how he painted the with blood but nothing happens lol so broken
---
rainbow 6 goes free weekend so often I should just install it one of these days it goes free weekend and just keep it saved on a flashdrive until it goes free again and play it continuously over multiple free weekends.
---
U play mnk on PS4?
---
What platform ?
---
Ah ha thanks for the help xd
---
What do you play on
---
lol just shut up
---
Sorry to tell you this, but if you can't hang in ranked, you're better off picking a different playlist. I avoid it for this reason.
---
I found that playing regularly you learn the map layouts pretty quick. Once you know most maps layouts you will become more creative in your approach towards enemies and the game becomes 10x more fun.
---

You're staring down hundreds of hours of grind time to be truly effective at this game. The longer the game goes on, the longer that grind gets due to the increasingly higher skill ceiling.

Holy shit I love your style
---
I cried when I saw this, yesterday I had to clutch 2 rounds in a row because I had all level 10 and below, ended up with an ace and a 3k because teamkilling is a thing, so it‚Äôs fine ig :p
---
It‚Äôs not that bad I think it might be cool for the game to get some more attention
---
Classy. Can't compete at your own level so you want to curbstomp noobs.

I tricked my friend with it but all the randoms decided they wanted to be barbecue that day...

Nah just wanna play with a friend who‚Äôs at a lower level.

I‚Äôm like you and I refuse to play ranked. 
---
I don‚Äôt really play ranked in other games either. Depends on the game. But usually I don‚Äôt play ranked for one central reason: people are fucking dicks.
---
Like I mean not just dicks in voice or team chat, but they don‚Äôt even want to play the game. They just throw all their shit out the window and are like ‚ÄúI cAn‚ÄôT pLaY wItH a ShItTeR oN mY tEaM!‚Äù
---
I just play the quick matches in Siege. Good enough for me.
---
Yea it is, when I bought the game I got a special edition with all the y1 operators, witch includes frost so I also mained her at the start and I really like her guns, especially her smg
---
Your username finally makes sense
---
She drank too much and tried jumping to j√§ger and bandit are saving her
---
I mean yeah but why be a douche? He‚Äôs proud of it, let him be
---
a stat tracker / match analyst app would be great.
---
Maybe you could cooperate with the people over at r/tabwire
---
Lol, I mean the event. I never got to play, I didn't have the game then, and I would love to have some way to play
---
Well I got teamkilled every turn by a party of four even if I did nothing. Funnily enough, I was the guy with the most kills
---
I'm in the midst of transitioning from Overwatch myself. I realize I'm behind and don't want to ruin matches and soft-throw by not really knowing what I'm doing, so I'm just playing terrorist hunt and watching stuff on youtube. It's not the most fun, but it's probably more fun than having zero value in a match. Take your time, also. Drone things out in T-hunt. Fail a couple times on purpose just to get comfortable with your gun's recoil pattern.
---
Mom says it‚Äôs my turn to borrow those shoes &gt;:(
---
There are only 3. Plus 2 of them can be countered. That would destroy balance of the game. Imagine that your only hardbreacher got spawnpeeked. You lost the round because all entries are blocked by metal.
---
Uhhhh
---
Sounds like a good way to make an obsolete operator even more obsolete.
---
Buck isn‚Äôt exactly a ‚Äûsupport op‚Äú you know that? 
---
I mean he can be very helpful to a team but he still is very much a frag-op
---
-good gun (challenging to learn but once mastered devastating)
---
-gadget that allows to play by themselves
---
bonus: frag grenades
---
Good luck on your learning journey! I can't recommend enough going through the "situation" missions, they're great for learning the basics. Then you can play newcomer to focus on learning the three maps in the rotation
---
I had a similar idea, thanks for the extra input, will check :D
---
its annoying, like 3 randoms talking and you only see your name for the rest or the one was speaking first until everyone stops
---
Looks tasty
---
Welcome to seige
---
It was either that or a screenshot. I miss the days of having dual breaches. Used to time them just right.
---
Well ya get three of them. So opening one wall and a pesky castle as well can be just as good as opening one wall to wall through and another to just see through. It's case by case.
---
Lol, I don't main buck dude, wish I could for sure, he's my favourite op but I primarily play thermite or thatcher, mostly the former now that my friend plays Kali all the time, just because I have that flair doesn't reflect my current state of play, ya dig?
---
Coastline. It looks amazing. Every room is colour coordinated. The two stair cases make rotations not easy but not impossible. There is a good amount of vertical play. The healthy mix between CQC rooms and long halls allows for gunfights at any distance. And I will always love the view from Hookah Balcony towards pool. Just looks amazing
---
That looks friggin cool man
---
Tachankas shield also breaks.
---
Jeez. I've played with so many Miras that have put up such terrible windows that had the gas tank towards the attacker's side and when opened were a direct line of fire into objective, ruining any decent chance of defending.
---
No it doesnt, lmao. Learn to drone and shoot

When I was a newbie at the game I didn't know how the hibana pellets worked so I'd shoot them at a wall or something, but I didn't know how to make them explode so I'd wait and wait and wait, then shoot them with my gunüòÇüòÇüòì
---
Yea you just go to settings, then press video, then shove it up your butt üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£xD
---
Because they try to peek a sniper at long range, then die and complain about it being op
---
my first time playing Hibana, I thought her gadget was a kind of grenade launcher and was trying to hit enemies with them..
---
Your sens is perfectly dialed for you, that flick from the cash stairs to lesion in the garage was nasty!

Man I felt cool hitting the clocks of the wall first shot, only time I actually hit something now even that I can't do

Wth that guys stupid then I‚Äôm 1.1 kd 2.0 wL in plat 3 and I was not boosted. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre still good at the game on your own.

What it looks like is when you pulled the trigger your reticle was over his right shoulder, and by the time the second bullet came out over his head his body was already behind cover. It sucks but not much you can do ü§∑

You wasted 35mins of your life for a downvote. Was it worth it?

They'll never be a replacement, only a distraction

Oh my god, me too. I actually called them out because it seemed like they were getting kills through walls and it seemed like they had wall hacks. They were saying they weren't hacking and I was so confused it was hilarious after it happened a second time in a different match and I found out it was a bug

Stop posting and complaining about long queue times, it's old and no one cares. All you have to do is cancel after 2 minutes and look for a new game, that's it.

Ikr, I'm gonna have to make some ez karma posts to recoup
---
I would agree, you almost missed his shoulder lol and the recoil went way up left past his head
---
that must be what it is. makes sense but honestly I wish it wasn't like that. it's too hard to judge whether your projectile is going to make it especially when ADS'ing
---
if youre comfortable flicking a ton inside a scope and you hit your shots, kali‚Äôs sniper is a god send and if you know where people are youre just the winner. *confetti*
---
We monty's are more than support! People think Monty players are trash so they pay no attention and I just center screen their head, L2 + R2 and goodnight lol. The best is seeing how different they react to me from Round 1 to Round 3 if I get attacking first.
---
That‚Äôs very nice to hear!
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
You're right I'm surprised kali didn't kill me but I managed to kill her before she did
---
Thanks chief
---
No, but you have to consider it.  Why should the opposing team also lose members only for your team to reconnect?  That would put them at the disadvantage.  Now what?
---
ur art is trash
---
Well Zofia only has two so you need to use them carefully and methodically. Ela has four if I remember correctly so you can be a a little more lenient. Good Elas will use them to stop a rush or as passive intel. They are basically the same thing as Yokai 1,000,000 proof shots that make you drunk in a millisecond. Overall they‚Äôre nice gadgets I think and can definitely be used wrong.
---
I never said, that leaving the game something you should do
---
well, get shorter triggers
---
It was mostly lucky cause they didn't even look over where I was but I was close to death by buck
---
Dokkaebi will have more effect on round wins in the average match, her gadget is far less situational and works regardless of what the other team does (aside from standing on mute jammers). I prefer her because I like to hunt roamers on immediate entry too.

Ubisoft needs to word it out better.

But to make it easier, anything you unlock in siege, is yours, permanent.

The only thing that is time based, is when you use boosters.

yeah i remember taunting lion by running around in them but ive never even seen blitz in the same game as a mute except one time when lion was new and broken and blitz had super speed and i never entered a jammer radius

On console you never get a kill with it because you deserve it, the person who died just shouldn't have been standing there. We call it victim blaming recoil.

If you don‚Äôt, check your router settings to see if there are any blocked ports, and if a setting called SIP-ALG is enabled. Unblocking the ports and turning of SIP might fix it for you
---
Nah
---
Sometimes the most valuable thing people can do is intel too. Then again I'm not a stickler for anything other than people doing full on dumb stuff in games like if they sprinted outside and tried to 1v5 knife fight the attackers.
---
Way before even that. This is skull rain at the latest
---
Though that's not the only problem, what about those games where you join and automatically get kicked without even having to spawn in first.
---
People might not leave as much, but there's always assholes in ranked depending on where you go. Casual or "quick play" has more teamkilling, but you're more likely to learn the important things in it. Never reinforce between bomb sites (there are some exceptions), that'll get you killed/lose the round, also, if someone knives at you when reinforcing, then you stop. Last but not least, don't barricade doors until after action phase, especially if your castle, but it's kind of acceptable to do it if your kapkan. Overall, if you want to learn better, then you should look up Varsity Gaming, he gives tips for new people and has a ton of strats

When 2 people do that dance thing in the hallway when trying to get by
---
Why does toxic players not avoid ranked instead? :D
---
Because he‚Äôs a Corporate shill
---
Ranked in competitive games usually brings out the worst in people in my experience. I used to play lol and in *bot matches* people acted like shit. There was no way I was going in deeper.
---
Thermite on wooden barricade
---
J√§gerhimself?
---
I did this. 
---
I was just hipfiring with an LMG in a half circle and somehow got three dudes
---
Ci
---
I may become one
---
Yw
---
I mean, I don't like weebs either. Too many players anime pfp's.
---
Whatever you like
---
Wires, batteries, a button and whatever mechanism (probably a spark gap) that activates those flashbangs. Maybe also some mechanism that cycles each row after it's been fired.
---
How do you guys record clips in PC
---
Ela only has 3
---
Double XP. Hackers with no self esteem
---
I‚Äôve already written the obituary and sorted out the funeral
---
How are you so shit at siege
---
Some people just don't look closely, and only notice the parts that are most important. And besides, you can at least credit them instead of being a jackass everytime someone calls you out.
---
Won us the ranked pretty much too
---
Just has a good gaming chair, gg
---
What map again?
---
Ah, that makes sense. Being that 2 shots can put you into a ‚Äúcritical health‚Äù state though: I think even more now that that was the case this time.
---
Budget cuts. For sure.
---
Goal‚Äôs to win. Not to click on heads: You played it the best you could and got the W.
---
You hit his ear muffs.
---
That's not in the hitbox.
---
it did look like you were shooting just left of his head
---
Oh that is truly horrible, more please
---
Same here, I scrape low gold but get matched with plats every cas and unranked game.
---
We go to ranked hoping for some better matchmaking and its all smurfs looking like they're on crack sprinting around the map
---
I was gonna say this. You try this shit on PC and you get smacked on the ankles. Also, a lot of standing still on the enemy team. Will say though, sledge/buck/finka rushing this site works well for me on PC ranked.
---
Why unranked, either play ranked or casual
---
he wasn't one shot
---
He hasn't lost a single game this season he is obviously cheating or playing with boosters can ubi ban him already
---
Says the Jager main
---
We also should get pings like, ‚Ä¢Spotted an enemy! ‚Ä¢Going to check out over here! ‚Ä¢Blow up this wall!
---
Fine job
---
Wow looks fantastic. Great happiness. Hibana is secksy. :}
---
Make a app where you can see the floors and plan strategies with drawing on them/operator icons/etc
---
You aimed a bit above his head
---
Oh that‚Äôs old. I don‚Äôt usually play him anymore
---
Oof
---
+10
---
Of course it's the Jager that's like hE iSnT ThAt StRoNg!!1!    Jager is a 3 speed with one of the best weapons on defense and a gadget that's good on every site now that he has a substitute ubi can finally nerf him into the ground
---
I would eat baby J√§ger... He seems tasty
---
Stop grenades I will.
---
You can trick the win loss if you leave a losing game. Youll get a temp ban but at least his precious stats arent messed up
---
im playing ranked not casual.
---
I got vote kicked because I didn't know of a certain rap artist...
---
Will do thank you very much
---
What? What are you talking about. Please explain!
---
O just beat the same kids 1 game later

Could be a good pencil holder, you can make it taller and put pencils in the holes. Also would look really cool with some paint
---
Just beat the same kids 1 game later
---
You like Roaming, Defending the Objecting, or Fragging?
---
The newcomer playlist is not toxic at all, I have a great experience so far. I'm playing on Hong-Kong servers so they speak mostly cantonese and I don't understand crap but they seem to have a good time. And when they speak english everybody is friendly. Also I haven't seen a premeditated TK so far.
---
I played a game as IQ today, I was the last one alive and died to a kapkan boobytrap. The opposing team laughed at me because.. well that shouldn't happen to IQ, but we all had a good laugh
---
Thanks for the response! I need to play more Chalet for sure. One thing I've started doing is taking screen shots of the top down maps and studying them but I haven't memorized Chalet. 
---
What in your opinion is the best feature of Chalet?
---
Also a woodsy stage would be cool. Maybe a more primitive and natural location.
---
"REPORTLA ƒ∞BNENƒ∞N EVLADI"

Hangi map bu?

'Befriended'
---
But people want to grind more than once a season dir their ranks /s
---
I mean its all pretty much the same shit. It's not like they can ping abuse. Where do you live/connect to? I literally rarely see shit about 200. In most of my lobbies there might be like one guy there with 200+ and the rest of us are sub 30.
---
technically you can. that's why there's multiple regions and that allows people to switch to whatever region they want
---
This would help so much you cant‚Äôt even tell
---
West Europe, regularly match with and against mid 100 pings. Just don‚Äôt understand why?
---
This has happened to me before. Hurts, lol.
---
Free weekend players stupid gib upvote
---
Champions being in silver ranks is probably just as bad as cheating in EU. Just make your rank universal for all servers not different for each region
---
I like chalet so much its because of the ruralness and how peaceful it is ehen you not getting shot
---
removed from match
---
smg-11 and 12 are different
---
That would make queue times so long. 
---
Also high ping ain't that bad anymore
---
Interesting
---
Thats classified
---
I like roaming, already have vigil (just to let u know)
---
Hmmmm. Idk. I'm on NA servers so yeah, not sure, man.
---
Probably
---
Rabbids...yeah..
---
Any operator will become more viable with map knowledge. For now, stick to simple gadgets. Base ops like the SAS bois, And the Russians will be relatively easy to use without a lot of map knowledge. Best of luck, have fun
---
I don‚Äôt remember saying or asking if you can buy renown?
---
Confused
---
How
---
The ads time is like negative 2 seconds
---
My ping goes from 40 to 70 and I'm too western European... Barely see someone with 150+ ping
---
This is the absolute worst drawing ive ever seen.WTF get better ir stop deawing. üò£üò£ü§§ü§¢ü§íüò∑üòµ
---
Houseflipper
---
I mean he kinda has to do his placements... At the start of a season I play against mid golds as well which is quite unfair as a higher plat especially with a stack
---
Cool ideas! I also like a good aesthetic and would like more stylized or thematic maps.
---
Someone else said a jungle map and I agree. I don't know, I think with enough effort you could make a jungle/forest map viable. It would have to fit the Siege template.
---
I‚Äôm talking about warden not smoke
---
It's not because of you, if you're connecting to your nearest datacenter. It's other players specifically connecting to your datacenter. You can choose what datacenter you want to connect to, so you can choose what region you want to play.
---
By default, the game will connect you to the nearest. (Or next nearest if there is a connection issue with your nearest)
---
For NA, if someone is over 140ms (Roughly), there is a decent likely hood they are playing from Europe, South America, or Asia. (Possibly Hawaii)
---
Or are possibly Streaming / Downloading / Purposely throttling their internet. It use to be an active thing known as "Ping Abuse" to purposely through the server data out of sync from player data to get abusive kills, but Ubisoft anymore has made that non-existent, and has taken steps to ban players for networking abuse. (Or players using VPN's in countries where it's illegal to use.)
---
Sledge Elite‚Äôs hammer looks like a xylophone mallet.
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.
---
Thank you, sir,  for giving this post a transparent background
---
Honestly, good reply, I get what you‚Äôre saying
---
The claymore has a short time it needs to trigger by placing it that close jager already moved away from the laser therefore the claymore didn‚Äôt trigger. It‚Äôs all down to bad placement on the claymore
---
Fucking love playing fuze in this cardboard box
---
I forget what it stands for, but it basically means how sensitive your mouse is. Higher DPI = more sensitive.
---
*cries in Xbox*
---
Ez gg
---
I already made a multiple paragraph long suggestion, yes it will be great. My suggestions were: a shield, an X, a question mark, and an extra one for looking at a teammate, using it, then pinging somewhere else their main or secondary gadget icon.
---
You are confused with TAA 2X. There is taa and taa 2x. currently on taa 100 scaling im only using 1633mb. I know the difference.
---
Ye that happens, even in ranked matchs.
---
My bad I read that wrong
---
XD Its ok buddy
---
Again a very valid point but say that don‚Äôt call it saving kd that‚Äôs you making something out of nothing, right? I didn‚Äôt push into the obvious areas to enter. I won‚Äôt deny that just speak facts okay. Rooftop camping isn‚Äôt kd saving because you said yourself it‚Äôs a bad peel area. Which should leave us at one point left to discuss. 
---
Okay mic always with me I don‚Äôt play without one and you said earlier mute button exist for reason so wouldn‚Äôt not talking be as effective? Alright that should drop that hopefully. 
---
So communication seems to be the last thing left which was never established and instead of trying to establish them just turns on me.
---
Why not? :D
---
Does what?
---
would upvote but 69
---
Which bug are you talking about? I havent heard about this yet
---
Bro your dumb how are you gonna reply to my comment agreeing with me and now switch up and say he didnt hit any of the lasers??

What platform are u on

Have you never played the game? When you break a barricade and it stays there and sometimes its only th ere for you and not the enemy and they see you and shoot you.
---
Its just mustard gas bro it aint really a secret
---
Smoke shouldve been german
---
On a free weekend, little jimmy isn‚Äôt gonna come in and use it like a minigun. It requires skill and practice to control its recoil it‚Äôs not for beginners.
---
‚ÄúKNOW YOUR PLACE, TRASH‚Äù
---
When you break it and it doenst actauly move. Its a big issue.
---
I'm console noob
---
Hell of a play
---
I don't see any tables here
---
My eyyyyyyyyeeeeeeessss!!!
---
That sounds like lag and i have never experienced this, do you have a recording of it since maybe im just lucky
---
Believe OP is talking about client side debris
---
The system compares your rank to everyone one else in your match and decides wether or not you should've or lost that match. If it thinks you should've won and you don't then you lose more rank and vice versa if it thinks you should lose but don't. So it more than likely thought you should've won those games you lost and the games you did win it was confident that you would. All it cares about is wether or not you win or lose
---
No, you can‚Äôt. Companies will give you a bunch of bs excuses to cover up the real reason: owning the game on different platforms, without the ability to connect accounts, means more money for the company
---
No kidding. When I play as Blitz, the entire enemy team might as well have Wardens glasses. I run into Blitz on the other team? He's harnessed the power of the sun
---
In apex there‚Äôs a setting to mute pings from your teammates, works really effectively but you do have to open up the menu to activate it so if you‚Äôre in a firefight you‚Äôre kinda screwed.
---
How did you get blamed for his gadget going off?
---
Damn nice
---
Fax. Still a dick though
---
I'm mainly arguing your point that KD doesn't matter when it is one of the most important things in Rainbow 6. You can have wallhacks, beat awareness evee but if you cannot click heads, you'll still lose. Just doing your "job" and calling it a success is not simply enough.
---
Its not lag and i can record it but there's no way i could send it. Well i cba just look it up. Im sure its been on the sub alot
---
This is a icon I'd except to see in XCOM. xD
---
ohhhh yea ive experienced that once or twice, sorry i didnt understand your post
---
Yes, both sisters receive the +10 point bonus for killing each other.
---
Dunno. Personally its not hard to get used to. Too much fps games probably...
---
Nice
---
my steam name is yaboyhpoo
---
Go 3 armor ops like fuze.. dont fuze the hostage tho
---
And maybe rook on defend
---
It takes into account your last rank. 
---
Also kd has 0 impact on your ranking.
---
i understand the issue now and yea that can be kinda annoying, luckily it hasnt happened to me in ranked or unranked yet
---
Look at the kdr...
---
OH SHIT OH FUCK
---
If you are referring to the battle pass there hasn‚Äôt been any news but I think it‚Äôs more than likely being redone or cancelled due to player feedback
---
Leave Tachanka to the pros.
---
u/EaglePhntm good point

Tachankas one is so overpowered

On ps4 it‚Äôs horrible, it‚Äôs genuinely hard to find a match without someone using it, either that or I have really really bad luck
---
You can‚Äôt just plug it in and use it, you need a xim which is really hard to detect
---
Not yet, I'm a beginner and still studying stuff, but I'm planning on doing R6 related art!
---
Thank you, sir!
---
I think everyone understands ‚ÄúNO NO NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING‚Äù
---
I see, so im the tasteless one here for always picking Nitrogen over BI
---
At what rank?
---
You can‚Äôt ban someone cause of movement either , I have lots of high plat - diamond mates who look suss as hell but they use controller
---
Dedication! Fuze main?
---
Yikes people still use this meme
---
In plat 2+ basically every game. There's rarely going to be a game where at least 1/10 players aren't using either MnK or macros.
---
raping the mic also works, just make sure to call their ops
---
Mira‚Äôs love this.
---
deebs
---
It was copper ranked anyway, hence the silencer too
---
I don‚Äôt play ranked because I suck and I usually enjoy playing with my friends, which is better when you don‚Äôt care about winning that much.
---
Moving differently than controller users doesn't mean anything unless talking about aim. That's be pretty difficult to do since footage would have to be had, then decisions would also have to be made. That process is a long one and it doesn't even necessarily mean that it's a guaranteed ban. And once again, 3rd party adapters can be made (sadly) if you tried to make the software something like BattlEye
---
If I can clutch a 3 v 1 with Ela's shotgun in ranked, I'm perfectly happy with the shotguns üòÇ
---
Absolutely, anybody who picks anything over black ice should be crucified because black ice is always he best without a competition /s but tbh people will mostly say black ice because its more popular
---
Or you just use your bloody microphone and tell your team to reinforce there? People really need to learn to communicate in this game, i've had lots of complain about losing a round because THEY couldn't open their damn mouth.
---
I hover around plat 3 and dont really see it at all so I guess there must just be a huge jump of usage within that 400 points of mmr
---
Most definitely
---
Ummm, what kind of revolver is that
---
I don‚Äôt think it would be that crazy considering any headshot is a one shot, but maybe they should injure instead of one shot.
---
the blazer with the hibana symbol i think
---
Hopefully bc I want some food cosmetics
---
Okay, recoil is not a problem, cos i can handle smg11 and 12, but ingame my mic succs ass so.
---
Ikr?? Why all the hate ü§£
---
Nitrogen Blast, easy.
---
Its in the community flair
---
I missed one? Darn, is there like a chart that shows every outfit and headgear for every operator?

Im an idiot when it comes to software and stuff but would it be possible for ubi to make it so you cant use third party controllers entirety?
---
Number 1 in EU last season was snake_nade for most of it, he's an EX-Pro and streamer so it can 100% be a legit player

Yeah i didn‚Äôt realize it until recently as well üòÜ

How did that hit her leg
---
retard
---
I meant the one you get when you have the Y4 season pass
---
Just give‚Äôm a try amigo, you‚Äôll love them ü§£ü§£
---
I would but I don't have pc, sorry
---
What server are you on
---
I'm not a collectible guy but I want the Thermite just for that dumbass smile.
---
I only care about a loss outside of ranked when a player with critical info doesn't have a mic and it loses us the round.
---
Right now I‚Äôm I ranked but I usually place around gold 2-3
---
*large sigh*
---
I don‚Äôt really get it but none the less more air came out of my nose than normal so it‚Äôs all good üòÜ
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Map is oregon i think
---
Renfs destroy gadgets that are really close to wall, and I guess the destruction is given to the renforcer, so since the source of the damage of the goyo shield is given to it's destroyer, it was given to OP in this scenario
---
No one is selling them anymore, some sold them when PL finished but they were asking for well over $300 for them
---
Managed to get it this season as well. Even getting near to plat2. This season just seems to work for me. Been a few seasons there i kept getting towards 3150 mmr. Welcome to the plats!!
---
I wanted lesion and for attackers i didnt know yet
---
My map name knowledge is quite bad with some and brilliant with others.
---
I also think that helps r6 maps stats. By that, i mean so ubisoft or siege can see what maps people like the most or least. It also kinda helps in choosing new maps for pro league
---
Tower is useless in R6S
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have thought of it but well, still only cheaters and the best of the best
---
Same
---
Oh nice can I still get it? I have the pro league one as well
---
That's true, but good god did he cheese the hell out of his rank.
---
Unfortunately yes, you get more at the beginning of each season
---
Only with the Y4 season pass, got the pl one too ^^
---
Let me see if I still have the Photoshop file on my computer, I'll share it with you.
---
Bruhh plat 2!!! Thats like 400mmr from 3  well done. What do you play on.kinda afraid to play incase i lose it but my squad got me.
---
What a save!
---
I think she's good, but only if you work with your team to leave cams up
---
Nice I‚Äôm getting that then thanks my friend!! üí™üòÅ
