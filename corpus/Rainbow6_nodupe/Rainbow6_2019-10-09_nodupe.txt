Bruh the dude in the sweatshirt spooked me but other than that nice

aye yall got any soup?

Ubisoft did not want to maintain two different codes for the same game. because it would increase their dev time for debugging the new ops and maps. 
---

---
But they could maintain the two and just make it so China ver is delayed by a month or something
---
That Ela cosplay is excellent in every aspect, it looks identical to in-game. 
---
How are people so good at cosplay?
---
?
---
There are keys at the bottom instead of buttons. He's on PC
---
What camo is the jacket?
---
So like 6 defender elites this year I‚Äôm guessing it will be in year five season 1
---
I would
---
its like photoshopped from the game lol. its just perfect
---
Twitch, i feel like I‚Äôm cheating when I play her.
---
This looks really good
---
What's the source on the grunting guy at the end? Keep seeing/hearing it, but I can't find it.
---
his traps are too good. they shouldnt do damage, but i think the developers dont want to remove that because that removes a counter for shields especially Montagne. beside that, Lesion traps are good enough for intel that it doesnt need to do damage.
---
That‚Äôs kinda scummy
---
This is such a great cosplay, nice job!

I mean it's cool. But there goes the magnification for the Acog

Zofia of course

Looks like I‚Äôm purchasing Mav for my next operator
---
hrrrrngh i‚Äôm gonna coom! ooooooahhhhh i‚Äôm cooming! *cooms*
---
c0ns0Le is the future
---
Like the elabei phone case
---
What does scummy mean? My english is not that good and Google translater couldn't help me.
---
It all depends on what‚Äôs fast for you, I know Xbox diamonds with a 30-30 and 25 ads,
---
I got my first plat 1 with 42V-83H and 37ADS and my first diamond with 42V-65H and 32ADS.
---
I ended up getting slower the better i got at the game because controller aim buildup without aim assist works like this:
---
Beginners shoot and get lucky hits because they can‚Äôt control recoil, aim or movement properly. Advanced beginners will have general movements and aim control but fail to control recoil and flicks. Regulars will have some sort of recoil control and great movement control, aiming and flicking are good but improving. Advanced regulars (high golds) will have full control over movement and recoil, but still struggle with flicks and precise crosshair placement.
---
Now we have reached plat territory. There are two types of players in plat essentially. Those who aim and those who don‚Äôt aim.
---
The Aimers play a low sens, they know where people will be so they pre aim and pre fire, the low sens helps with precise micro flicks and recoil control, but turn on shots are hard. They have an easier time with low rof guns and half automatics.
---
The non aimers will prefer fast movement and reaction shots, they see or hear something they will spray in the general direction while making most of their shots depend on their reaction speed, not their aim. They have an easier time with full auto and high rof guns.
---
Big difference is that aimers actually control where the bullets go while non aimers don‚Äôt control, they react. Sure they have recoil control and all the necessary skills but they rarely slowly control the aim even in hipfire, they will flick and turn and do all the crazy fast stuff tho.
---
I personally am a non aimer. I can‚Äòt snipe for shit and pistols are the bane of my existence but give me a nice high rof full auto and I will absolutely make someone‚Äôs life miserable.
---
Never realized they added a shock wave animation
---
Snowflake

It's not realistic at all what are talking about? They are literally shooting you from their FOREHEAD their gun is not visible at all.
---
It has to do with the fact that If you were kicked one you wouldn't be getting him back and two that he would lose his mmr which is unfair
---
All you see is peepee cause you‚Äôre GAAAAAAY

Damn I didn‚Äôt know that much. I just knew the money part

I remember I was once in a 2v5 and the other guys still ran globals and blitz.

Apparently i cant like to it. Blizzard banned a pro league hearthstone player for a year, is holding his prize momey, and took away his status because he made a public statement about supporting hong kong.
---
I like it, would change up casual quite a bit without upsetting ranked and pro league too much since they communicate their positions anyway (or at least should).
---
Keep in mind that house tower favela and plane will come back soon and they will take out other maps. I take house over Bartlett anytime. I‚Äôm not saying casual player shouldn‚Äôt be heard but I feel that the game should be design around the more competitive players. If we listen to all the ideas from the casual players the game will lose all its charm imo and be poorly balance.
---
me too thanks
---
The sub wont let me link to it. Blizzard banned a pro league hearthstone player for a year, is holding his prize momey, and took away his status because he made a public statement about supporting hong kong.

Who decided at hq ‚Äúwe should make an FPS on our assasins creed engine‚Äù
---
I'm not sure their internal policy but i know they have something about being able to if someone makes the company look bad. I guess looking bad to the Chinese government counts since they get a lot of money from them
---
Not gonna lie, thats a good cosplay.

yeah i agree to that

It‚Äôs possible. In the mean time I would try https://squads.tm/game-r6 and r/R6STeams if you are looking for people to play with.

We literally say Ela is the thiccest, I'm just sad I didn't get the popcorn
---
"she"

it would become like some causal matches where you are put with a 4K squad and get kicked instantly

...like Ela you mean?
---
Wow, she literally looks like Ela, in the face.
---
Blizzard has a special clause for just about everything they come up with it seems.
---
Sony has allowed all games to have cross-platform on them now(Sony was the reason why we don‚Äôt have cross play available on most games) so it might be in the near future that rainbow might get cross play
---
You'd be surprised but the clan I've met did f\* same thing
---
Hell yes! Looking awesome!
---
Glad you still like my Elaebi! :D
---
He goes to conservative subs and says anti-Republican things that are also totally unrelated to the posts. He's just a troll
---
This happened to me earlier. I was the defender and he was a thermite. Im defusing the bomb and i hear movement and gunshots and i see his head pop up from outside the window

why

Talking about cosplay, do you have any idea what type of bike Mozzie rides, or know who may? (The one in the concept art, trailers burnt horizon main menu and on the Outback map.) I've been planning on getting a bike for a while and would love to try and make an all out Mozzie cosplay including it one day.

True, but using the shields like this to waste Attacker utility isn't a bad 2nd place prize. That's one less explosive they can bring to the shootout.
---
I agree. What characters do you like?
---
I know but I regard pistols as low-damage weapons. I use them to destroy drones, not opposing operators.

Too futuristic?

Yeah I‚Äôve had this game for years, I remember when Blackbeard came out so that was probably around the time I got it but anyways, I‚Äôve always avoided the game because my brother always talked about how much I wouldn‚Äôt like it and how I would get mad and how toxic the community was, I completely disagree with him, I love this game, I‚Äôm a little above average at the game and the community has been great from what I‚Äôve seen so far! So glad I finally gave the game a try in phantom sight!

Hey but I'm no welcome mat. I'm just their humble bf. SquadW

No one complains in Tarkov when they get 1 shot. And in that game you dont even have to aim for the arms. R6 was marketed as a slow, tactical shooter yet everyone eats bullets for breakfast. They also run and gun like its COD but that's a different problem.
---
 Fuze

Idk what happened. Swear to god this season just sent everything to shit for me but everyone else is a diamond player

In this particular instance? Probably about 10 minutes. But I've seen and addressed these claims previously.

I doubt that I‚Äôm most cases.

Almost every game you are paired with your own language because of region-based matchmaking.

However,at times I feel annoyed that I cannot communicate with someone speaking Spanish because of the barrier.

It‚Äôs based on rank and region, idk how many languages this game comes in but guessing ALOT

When you went behind the corner for that small second
---
Wait until they give some buffs for Warden; his gadget brings virtually no utility to the team, and his guns leave a lot to be desired. 
---
Until then, Goyo is the better pick for now.
---
Tarkov is also a way bigger game than Rainbow, making guns do more damage would just make the game even faster because everyone would get melted. Just because something works for one game doesn't mean it would work for this completely different one. And if you think Tarkov is the better FPS then go play that.

I wanted this to be real so bad

That made %200
---
Arm shots are the same as body shots, anything below the waist is 0.75 damage multiplier.  So yeah, it's possible that if only one bullet hit, in the feet, it would do less than 20 damage.
---
What really bothers me, though, is how his first shot wasn't a headshot.  I'd be more mad about that, honestly.
---
Ranked only really gold 2 or 1 on Xbox
---
Hohoho this'll sting a bit!

I wouldnt think there would be a difference because console is capped at 60 fps. It would be the same if anything.

I can recommend a couple great general gaming podcasts though.
---
1. The Game Informer Show - hosted by the charmingly goofy Ben Hanson. Really fun, light-hearted podcast with a lot of enthusiasm for the gaming industry as well as tons of exclusive interviews, info, and insight.
---
2. The Giant Bombcast - Has the feel of just a bunch of friends hanging out chatting about games (among other things), but also has insider info and hands-on impressions from all the big shows and stuff.
---
If your'e just looking to fill your podcast feed, I'd also recommend The Complete Guide to Everything. Not gaming-related at all, but it's hilarious, and has become my all-time favorite podcast. Note that the name is ironic. It should not be considered a guide to anything, let alone everything.

You're referring to the little white skull that pops up, no? I'm just saying the suppressor already gets rid ofnthe white lines the bullet trails make when you shoot
---
By your attitude it seems you are unwilling to actually work on this issue and just want to be edgy and scream fuck ubi. The thing is with PC's you can almost always find an answer or reason if you take the time to research it. Plenty of people are trying to help you here and all you say is "fuck ubisoft" if you don't want help, then don't bitch. 
---
If you actually want help with this problem, find out what equipment you are running and take the advise but the fact you don't even know what processor you are running is a pretty sure fire sign you likely aren't taking good care of your pc.
---
"Pathetic"
---
Fucking beat me to it

Um how did fuZe fuze freezer and kill train?

Perfect.

Also back when the range of his mute jammer would only cover one reinforcement instead of two

Jager would've spawnpeeked blitz and the rest of the team before they even would've planted
---
lol, i spent almost a month trying to fix this issue. dont wanna waste my time on this shit. tried different versions of windows, bios, gpu bios, and other shit like that. no thanks. they even accept that is the bug with this game on rainbow six siege main page. but only thing they can do for us is giving advices about fps cap.
---
So you're saying the defenders shouldn't pressure the attackers but instead just let them in the building peacefully?
---
You did all that but don't know what your processor is.... ok bud. Good luck.
---
Best cosplay action 10/10
---
Thank you this is a big help!
---
Ubisoft doesn't deserve praise for not bowing to the demands of a dictator that has no power over them. That should be expected. They saw how pissed off the community was and how much money could be lost by proceeding and backed out.
---
Jesus why do people have such bad situational awareness
---
Yeah because her hel has a reduced silent step effect it‚Äôs like cave but not nearly as good
---
There's still friendly fire
---
If they didn‚Äôt the rank system wouldn‚Äôt work those games didn‚Äôt happen they were removed from the system it sucks but it‚Äôs for the integrity of the game
---
I think Maestro is more useful in most situations.
---
In my opinion, Kaid has better weapons as well isn‚Äôt as bulky as Maestro, but I still like Maestro more üòÑ
---
I‚Äôm unsure. When you start adding these extra layers or realism you take the game away from what it is now and push it towards ARMA. That‚Äôs not a bad game but I don‚Äôt find it fun to be fighting my guns. Gun wobble. Drop off etc

when the green triangle sight was the cheapest so it's all i used because who'd spend 4x as much for only 3.5x the zoom on the acog... simpler times

Do people think BB should be nerfed? He's my new favourite Attacker
---
Yeah in the moment it's weird, like I can't really put it in words, but like u entirely mean to do what you do, but you sort of just do it subconsciously but then can't do it if you try
---
Thanks! :)
---
I think a large part of Ubisoft‚Äôs stance is due to their market in China. I‚Äôm no expert in these things but I do know that Activision/Blizzard are in a very large part, owned by Tencent, who are a massive media company in China. 
---
The decision of them to do what they did probably came from how big Blizzard‚Äôs games market is in China and how most of their company is Chinese owned. 
---
Ubi probably isn‚Äôt under control of any big Chinese corporation that needs to comply to the country‚Äôs censorship policies, plus I‚Äôm sure their market there isn‚Äôt as large. 
---
Good for them for not caving into them though. If they really wanted they could‚Äôve expanded into the Chinese market and the game would be wildly popular I believe.
---
Is it though? I wonder why you say that because litteraly almost every detail is in this cosplay and it took quite some time. I'd like to see your Cav cosplay in that case. ;)
---
When you're an enthusiastic Fuze main who just wants to blow things in at an objective.
---
Dang imagine if he actually were Jason lol
---
But they shot afterward
---
She is seriously pretty.
---
Yes
---
Ah yes, BiBana and Bachanka
---
But Ubi never said "no"!!! Just want to remind you that they made separate version for china and rest of the world. Despite fact that was perfect way around - it still doesn't count as resisting.
---
Thank you
---
You had to buy attachments at one point?
---
Holy shit i feel lucky
---
Why would it not still be happening? You cannot stop it 100%
---
Considering I've seen spawnpeeks in Pro League i can't agree when you say it only happens to new players. Its called an action phase for a reason, if you can't be bothered to drone or be cautious on your way out of spawn then its your fault that you get sniped.
---
Yep
---
The shield doesn't actually cover the whole head, if they are on the same level as you they can see the top of your head. So could be people getting lucky or knowing about that spot and if you are crouched vs them standing it makes it that much easier to hit.
---
unplayable
---
if you're crouched you can get shot above the shield to a direct headshot if the defender stands up or his higher than you.  
---
technically he has the high ground
---
It's ubi. I've a video where i was killed while looking trough a Maverick hole, from a Doc with his revolver. Also 1 tapped. I had 100HP and killfeed said headshot. 
---
I stopped playing BB cuz of this.
---
Ah right I see, being new I obviously only know his current playstyle and it matches my attacking quite well!
---
This is soo cute ahahahaha
---
2017-2019 (shot to death)
---
Ikr, if I didn‚Äôt see this i am calling him out for hacking.
---
My favorite kill was when I randomly threw an impact nade at a giant hole in a wall and wound up getting a triple.
---
Thought this was top quality till I clicked on the picture and saw he‚Äôd already captioned it that üòÇ
---
Noice
---
I mainly use shields to dick around. Except when the defenders have Clash. Then I go all out to kill Clash before messing around again.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was anyone there. I just threw it for the hell of it.
---
I know what I‚Äôm doing now. &gt;:D
---
They increased ads time of shield operators to prevent cheese. It turns out ads speed is actually a *huge* deal in who wins a gunfight.
---
I only play Fuze on Hostage mode for that very reason.
---
My god, leanspam the terrorists harder.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

ads speed is the time it takes to "aim in"

I played 3 games today. I got kicked out of 2 games. The third game, 3 teammates wanted to kick a 4th player and I was the only vote that kept him. All different players in each of those 3 games.
---
Oh shit really?! Just when I was about to breath a sigh of relief. Not doubting you or anything, but where can I read more about this?
---
But it would be like skeet shooting with a shotty
---
Theyve been there since the rework.. obviously they were placed there to cut down on run outs, dirty angles and pixel peaks on that spawn point.
---
I think the plates are new, I looked at a couple of the early videos of people showing the map off and the plates aren't there though I'm not sure if they were just added with this patch or not.
---
‚ÄúPretty good I‚Äôm going to leave the obj now.‚Äù- Monty
---
Back in the first seasons when you could go to work and come back still in queue
---
Thicc
---
It is, it makes it a bit harder to spawnpeak
---
They didn‚Äôt say no, they got showered with hate for trying to censor the game for the rest of us to appease them. Too much backdraw made them do what they didn‚Äôt want to &amp; create a separate client for China. Catering to both. They didn‚Äôt say no they just found a different way to say yes. 
---
It‚Äôs a shitty situation because I‚Äôm still boycotting Blizzard because they went way overboard with punishment just to bend the knee. However I believe almost every publisher would‚Äôve bent the knee if it came down to it.
---
Can I make a request for the next one?
---
Not my proudest fap
---
Do you drone? Do you know the maps? Why don't you get kills?
---
Well you can go wrong with Ela.
---
What about before Alpha packs?
---
Did this still go through? Did you end up having 2 kapkans when you loaded in?
---
Communication. Communication. Communication.
---
You'll get so many more kills with callouts and coordinated pushes, and on that note, use ya damn drones.
---
maybe record a match, watch it back and see what you could've done better
---
I mean it fires slugs not buckshot.
---
I don't remember. It wasn't anything bad, just completely unrelated to siege
---
I think that‚Äôs on you
---
so i can watch my flank with my own drone? i can have some on cams all the time? comp players could have dedicated cam watchers all the time?
---
Well there really is no point because we can see what we did right after we die.
---
Woah, that's great news. Can't wait for the halloween event.
---
By these I also included gridlock and nomad
---
Dude why
---
What I want here is to have better aim. Nothing more.
---
then use your email instead? you can choose if you want it to be on your email or googles dumbass authentificator
---
Hahaha
---
How difficult is it to base the matchmaking on the highest rated player!
---
Still awesome, don't play it down!
---
yeah i only understand human language
---
All of the above. I just have my good and bad games. But I'm sick of the bad ones. I don't get kills because the enemy usually has a better angle or knows where I am.
---
When your operator gets on his/her drone, the screen is displayed on your phone. When your operators off it, you're off it. It's nothing mandatory either, just optional.
---
but maybe earlier in the match you missed something or you are using the wrong tactics
---
They buffed the smg recently so now it's actually kinda great. Even some pro players using it over the shotgun.
---
It'll sting a lot
---
was it only a visual bug or did you guys ended up having actually do kapkans?
---
The soundcard is fine, it only happens to discord when i play rainbow six siege. 
---
I checked my cpu usage while playing and it didn‚Äôt reach above 90%
---
Looks like an i9 processor
---
Yeah but you didn't say whether you use mnk or not, just that you like mnk better
---
bruh
---
So you want to give the defender with the highest pick rate and a solid win rate a buff?? Sure man why not, there‚Äôs nothing that could go wrong here. Plus I saw you wanted acog back. Just no.
---
I'd love to check that :D
---
Tho I don't have a third account
---
That's one quick repost
---
How long is a while?

Bruh imagine having 5 cavs against 5 jackals

When I played ps4 it happened a lot, I'd never vote people out so 9 times out of 10 there would be a 3/4 vote for someone then after that I'd get kicked. It's the reason I stopped playing siege, I really love the game but I only started playing again when I got a pc.
---
It was the most unholy thing I have ever seen
---
Sounds like a great idea for a limited game mode, the team votes on what operator to play and all of you are that operator.
---
Imagine 5 fuzes on house. Or 5 lesions...
---
So mister super intelligent. How would you deal with the hackers?
---
I could probably make this in PowerPoint
---
I though it was a drawing it was that good
---
The AUG got buffed this season, so now it's kinda great. If you want, look up rouge-9's video on it. Even some pros are using it.
---
Any news for the DDOS fix? Still it's nightmare in EU Server.. they have new way to DDOS. They lag the server once in a while specially when they are attacking so you won't move or reinforce anything then goes back to normal for couple of seconds, when they enter the obj they open the DDoS and it's free kill,free plant and free MMR for them.. this is the worst season ever!
---
Because I wanted to make my own?
---
Tchanka have a shield yet non of u even give attention to the lord
---
**No.**

Neither of those, he is very fun and overall useful in most obj.
---
Why is rainbow so fucking toxic? Honestly it‚Äôs making me start to turn my head to better things now.
---
I dunno how new but they certainly weren't there when the map launched
---
Halloween
---
Happened to me on favela. I was last alive against a few enemies and lost because of it
---
They buffed the damage. It's now the third highest damaging SMG in the game
---
The game simply doesn‚Äôt exist anymore it‚Äôs normal that you lose or gain the elo ( yes  you can also gain elo it‚Äôs not that rare). Imagine the situation you play a game of rank you have a cheater in your team, ( and you know he‚Äôs cheating )you decide to continue to play as team you win x amount of game. How is it fair for the other teams that loss to a hacker?
---
This is amazing, where did you get that gas mask though?
---
YES
---
There is epic drop shot
---
I think he‚Äôs good as is
---
Its not epic
---
Goddamn the way you move
---
Hmmmmm 2 speed makes him able to get to the hostage and fuze him faster. Deal!
---
This is so goddamn GOOD
---
Had these kids kick me cause i didn't go recruit. As if i wasn't carrying them &gt;;l
---
For console it is
---
How is you gaining extra Elo unfair to them?
---
They still won, and if they aren't penalised because they only had 1 hacker per 1hour or maybe less, they wont lose anything
---
There‚Äôs a couple things you can use to record. I use medal and all I gotta do is hit F8 and it saves the last 30seconds or so. You can make it higher or lower depending on need
---
Imagine not even playing the corresponding ops that have the smg11
---
Me too :(

It's all preference I guess, but regardless, you cannot deny that the aug is very close to the top in terms of performance. This is why I'm saying the aug is better than the Tcsg in most cases when playing Kaid(since the gun is actually good now).
---
too afraid to admit it they admit defeat as soon as they hit leave

Hey hey, I can hit something, the wall behind my enemies.

Sorry I don‚Äôt speak beer and soft pretzels.

Will check it out , thanks homie
---
You're probaly joking but the fmg is the same as Mutes smg and used to be the same as Doc and Rooks smg and his pistol isnt even as bad as you think it is
---
Did you try to restart?
---
I just always save incase something I like more comes up but my bf wastes all his on alpha packs
---
It‚Äôs because you were searching, I think it‚Äôs a good thing...
---
Save for diamond camo
---
If you team kill and get reverse friendly fire in two matches in a row, you should get it enabled persistently through the next three or four matches. A decent player shouldn‚Äôt accidentally team kill more than that. I accidentally team kill maybe once every 8 matches.
---
I was thinking of it , i just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it lmfaooo
---
So that‚Äôs an option but it‚Äôs a crappy option imo cause alpha packs always suck
---
so they only made 2?
---
I'm hoping in the future there is an MMR roleback on console since DDOSers are getting banned now.
---
SMG 11 is a secondary, fmg is a primary
---
Well I‚Äôd hope so.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not that nice. It‚Äôs way to much for what it is.
---
thank you man your a lifesaver &lt;3
---
lol isnt lesion part of the hong kong police thats beating the shit out of protesters?
---
Never ever. Just buy the skins diretcly for your best operators. Also i would always save some stuff for new seasons because sometimes they have some nice weapon skins
---
I was talking about pistol not having recoil, not it being fast. I can see how you got that from laser beam though.
---
For someone that has all the operators (except Vigil), and owns the annual pass, it's the only thing I look forward to saving for.
---
Let them come
---
Nah was just making a joke
---
What do you want them to do? Ban them permanently when they 'lag out' of a game because Ubi's servers are wack? Ban them when the game crashes? Ban them when their internet literally gives out? Ban them when the power goes out? And if ANYONE else ran the game, we would have to pay real money for new Maps, Gamemodes, Operators, Skins, etc. The only other company that comes close to doing what Ubisoft is doing is Respawn with Titanfall 1, they gave away all map packs for free for their 1st birthday.

If you don‚Äôt like something, you just don‚Äôt appreciate it, hate hackers? You just don‚Äôt appreciate them, got traumatized by the holocaust? You don‚Äôt appreciate it. Nice logic u/secretelyaTrain

It's more complex than just "kids are playing R6:Siege". The very same "phenomen" can be observed in other games, where you can competitively or semi competitively interact with people online and they all have the same in common. When game lacks quality/content (thing generaly doesn't work as expected), yet is addicting (weekly challenges or grind), then boredom bring people to "inventing" new ways to "enjoy" the game or add something "more" to gameplay.
---
-fuze
---
But the 2 Armor 2 **Speed** is a problem. Goyo is a little different with his Acog because it's a Slug loaded shotgun.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen this before
---
I know but I just wanted to have some fun
---
But what if *I* want Twitch?
---
Yeah go for it. I got into ranked at about the same amount of hours as you have and I was fine. It takes a bit of adjusting but you should cope.
---
Oh great, just another thot. Move along...
---
But youre suggesting that I think you should find something to appreciate in anything.
---
What I said was, some people will find something to dislike in everything.
---
And, Reloading is a Suggestion is a joke amongst my friends, because in Seige, my best weapon type is LMG's. Because everyone reloads an LMG after firing like 12 shots. Or they fire in bursts.
---
Whereas I will fire an entire clip into a hallway, because people are sometimes dumb and poke their heads out anyways.
---
thats a good answer ty

Dude you're nuts. She's perfect. She had a claymore. They gave it to someone else to help utilize her better.

Sdu (Special duties unit) has not yet join the HKPF for beating protesters.
---
idk why you're posting this shit that's been reposted countless times and is 2 years old but ok
---
What?
---
Smooth as eggs.
---
I kinda agree with him you got one headshot form hip firing not that impressive
---
The way I think will be best to tweak him is. Let him have 2 drones but they only have 1 shit each. Lower the time it takes to recharge a shot. The other is keep him how he is now but make that his shots don‚Äôt stop the plant but it make it that you go back at the start. This will help in last second plant where echo can win a 1vs5 with his drone.

Hello lorc_gaming, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dfjjwq/clip/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You can't jump in siege? What is this? THIS IS UNIMMERSIVE!
---
You are mine se√π m√≠sarav√≠√©l
---
My guess is they are going to use the ban percentages to look at nerfing those operators soon or buffing others.
---
Personally Echo needs one of several nerf or even a couple of them. A few choices are, other defenders should be able to use his drones or at the very least move the camera, he only have one burst before a recharge or different nerf idea is he can't use his own drone outside a certain range outside of for cams. I've heard the opinion that he should lose a drone but to me that would be way to much.
---
With Jackal footprints should last half as long and when he actively starts tracking people the pings should happen much faster forcing Jackal to go after the person or risk wasting one of the gadgets uses. I think this would put Jackal close to where he really should be and push players to actively use him in a hunting role with the change to the active tracking.
---
This motherfucker probably would be participated in beating the protesters

Doki's main "Doki.NaVi" account or whatever it was named got permanently banned from Uplay. These bans are always manually done which means a Ubisoft employee (or multiple), investigated the account after a lot of reports, or evidence of the account being very toxic. 
---
Obviously they investigated the account and found it to be toxic as fuck, and so they banned it. 
---
Ubisoft has a policy apparently tries to force ESL to ban Pros who get Uplay banned. Which is currently why Doki isn't playing. Otherwise I think ESL would be quite happy to let him play on another account.

And also custom buttstock

Lesson here folks is that money runs the world, and corporations are more than happy to ignore millions of people's suffering just so that a totalitarian nation can shove their blood money up their assholes

The drone is not meant to be the drone in the box I think.  
---
It is meant to be a sticker of the drone which has been taken out.
---
I like the 3 round swap maybe make it that it takes 5 round to win the game and I‚Äôm happy. If you feel that villa don‚Äôt have enough entry point then you don‚Äôt know they map. I have easily at least 3 ways to enter to attack the top floor. They already placed a rank limit of 1000 mmr in a squad it really helped the boosting problem.  TK will always be a part of siege that‚Äôs just something we have to accept.  Keep vite to kick in casual. Yes sometimes people vote to kick the last one because they want to play faster it‚Äôs dumb but that‚Äôs the siege community in a nutshell. It will take a system for the game to detect if the player is trolling which is a very different definition for each player so it hard to say what is and what is not trolling.

Your cosplay is fantastic. Smoke elite is horrendous

Siege is very toxic, i have over 500 hours on record, but siege can be really fun of you just do the dumbest shit and try your hardest!

It‚Äôs casual get over it

Siege can be so toxic. But you really have to look past it all. Even if it's EVERY OTHER ROUND. I took a very long break. But I came back it made everything better. It's a great game, it's the community that's fucking trash. Really just reporting people is all we can do.... And that sucks.

Reroll anything that requires a full team

Some dumbass on ranked killed me because i was reinforcing the wall next to laundry room hatch on oregon, i was playing mute and didnt put jammer down (on the laundry basket on the table) yet because i didnt want to risk a twitch drone to kill it while im busy doing hatch, guy told me that a thermite would‚Äôve destroyed both hatch and wall, even though from the mute jammer spot the wall can be jammed
---
Ok. That‚Äôs a few examples. Of course a couple are going to be accurate
---
But what constitutes hard to use? Is Vigil‚Äôs ability hard to use effectively? Yes. Is Vigil hard to use in general? Not at all

Is Jackal‚Äôs ability hard to use effectively? Not really. Is it easy to use? Not entirely.

One of the best cosplays I have ever seen.

The shotgun is busted good, but I don't prefer it.
---
It‚Äôs bothersome home unreasonable some people are though. Like I offer to prove that I‚Äôm not cheating and this not alone done accept the offer, but still accuse me of cheating lol. I can say as someone that plays pretty consistently from Plat II-Diamond ranks that there are plenty of MnK users that I slam. Most actually aren‚Äôt that good and you can only tell because of how jittery they are. It‚Äôs def a problem, but not as much as people make it out to be. Maybe that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt really have trouble against MnK players though.
---
I'm the same as you coming from console to pc and learning to aim with a mouse. Think of how many hours of experience you have on a controller to get to where you were. I'm prepared to put hundreds of hours more into FPS games until I can get my aim to be more consistent. For a long time, I was still far better at aiming on a controller even after 250+ hours on siege and even now I still would say im more consistent on a controller. I personally don't really play T Hunt anymore unless ive taken a decent break from the game. Ranked is the best place to go
---
Frost was my first one, and mainly because none of my friends had her and I thought she‚Äôd be fun. Show she sits as one of my most played operators.
---
I‚Äôve finally gotten my Mira wall bangs down it‚Äôs soo satisfying
---
resulting to ad hominem attacks nice one
---
First op was mute at about 3 days thatcher about 3 days after launch, because my friends said he was good. First not core was Frost because I decided to buy her then buck in season one.
---
Buck and Valkyrie.
---
Both have great gadgets, guns, and are actually helpful for all maps.
---
Not to mention I too have magically pulled off 12 kills in a ranked match early in my Siege days and I'm not even sure how. Still can't do that consistently today...
---
Valkyrie, Extra portable cameras are super helpful. Especially when you‚Äôre trying to hide them
---
the first operator was was buck because 2 guns seemed fun to me and my first speciality operator was prob cav because i was a low level and it worked
---
I'm sorry we're you comparing a phone to a God?
---
Da cyka! Do you think I am joke? You fuck bitch, to gulag with you
---
For the ones who says weapon and c4 is a weapon. I meant shooting, using bullets...
---
My first op was ash after I bought the started edition( big mistake) first specialty op was frost just because of a russian badger video. Had lots of fun using her
---
What is going on with that screen?
---
The knife miss(I‚Äôd probably fuck it up too tbh)

I get diamond on multiple accounts. Up until this season with champion, there was no reason to keep playing a diamond account after getting diamond.

I mean if you're looking at the ground all the time you have other problems you need to address.
---
I honestly don't really care about my rank anymore, ddos and mnk has really put me off this game, I don't see the point in playing anymore so for me i want to just play a ranked game couldn't care less if i win or lose, you might say "play casual" but you probably know why saying "play casual" isn't a good argument.
---
I don't think so. Just last month ubi released a statement that siege hit 50m players [link](https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/player-count)
---
Not anymore. You used to be able to put a mira mirror on the middle of 2 reinforcements which then makes the 2 walls into 1 which then allows Bandit to only use 1 battery for 2 walls. This was fixed a while ago though.
---
To gulag with you

i like it

I wish I could do something as cool, got a 3-man with Monty but I don't record gameplay

I understand what you are suggesting, 1 click = melee 2 clicks = lean. But I think you don‚Äôt understand why it would not work. Go into the game now and time how long it takes to melee after you press the stick in, it happens instantly. So when you press the stick for the first time when you try to lean, it will melee and *then* you will lean. Because melee happens instantly.

You must be trolling...

So when most of my buddies started to play the game between  Black Ice and Skull Rain ( I was prolly lvl 100 or something), I just made a new account to share the progression with them and mostly help them learn , we didn't even ranked.
---
Wtfff I thought it was the actual one ! You have a great outfit and mad photography skills !

Twitch‚Äôs 417 also have the same problem

Yes but if you double click the game won‚Äôt read that as a melee it will read it as lean

May I ask, how do you get there?
---
I believe it was Mira. At the time I just liked the idea of seeing enemies while they couldn't see me. I played her a lot for about half a year and got pretty good with her, she is still my second most played defender. However I eventually came to realize that she just doesn't fit my playstyle very well and nowadays I only bring her out when I feel it's necessary.
---
Almost every issue with ranked is caused by people being at the wrong rank for their skill level. This can happen when someone's ability to win is significantly lower when soloQ or when playing with a different team to usual. 
---
I have a main for playing with my main team, a smurf for playing with alt teams and a pure soloQ smurf for solo ranked. If I didn't do this, then I would end up deranking when I play without my team and bringing the team's MMR down (giving us easier games) when I play with them.

Hello lebowskipei! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:

Just make it so you cannot quit a ranked game outside of using surrender.

He should be called —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞

Wouldn‚Äôt be siege without the random vote kick. I clutched a 1v2 as frost and got vote kicked immediately afterwards, feelsgoodman

My question is how did IQ miss that knife? Got to love knife hit Reg

I just cant cope with the constant call outs and people talking over each other man, conflusters me.

Click on their names and it should take a lil bit to pop up

Absolute imbecile

Next operation leaked? Operation minecraft, I'm down for this

You can‚Äôt find out until after the game is over

Same
---
Have you never played a COD title like all of them have a doggo in them that can be killed
---
Go to unranked, there is no vote to kick and it‚Äôs more casual than casual. So causal in fact I rarely ever get spawn peaked.
---
Actually it‚Äôs who‚Äôs the canister
---
You can onky see their level in ranked if you so that

It'd be better if there was a Grzmot mine and two Black Eyes slightly lower on either side in the groin area.

You're a bit late

Haha, it was just a joke because a doll implies a human figure. No im not doing some PETA stuff haha because I absolutely loathe dog enemies in any video game. Bloodborne? Hate dog enemies. Far Cry? Hate the little fast bastards. Little Robot dogs from the Surge? Hope they rot in android hell.

not only as you said is it totally out of place, it's just such a ... stereotype. like they asked a 13 year old what makes a cool biker guy and then put everything he said into that skin.

ACOG. Can't control the gun with holo. It's one of the only guns in the game I can't use without ACOG and I'm not entirely sure why

I thought the title was Almost 100 **ATTACKERS**

Wait... Then how do you add more?

insane

&gt;the best characters in the game

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Nice

typical eu server...

Oh shit we are losing 2-0 on defense attack will be worse. One guy quit nobody lose elo. The other team that would have probably won don‚Äôt gain elo. This will be broken.
---
My opinion mate

Indeed, a play

But have you seen the video where a guy throws c4 and it bounces off a drone mid air and kills OP?

Im gonna suck it thanks to My autistic mouth hole

That's true - I did get a good chuckle out of it tho, after a rough game, kids like this can make it better.

In Change User Flair go to Edit then choose any one and make it say whatever you want. You do :OPname: and it‚Äôll show up, can also write whatever you want

It's a good thing the knifing is ass

His weapons are way to strong. He has  acog on a full auto weapon and has smg-11. On his ability let‚Äôs not make anymore global every pros say that‚Äôs it way to much value on a single button press and it requires 0 skills. Also he won‚Äôt be a good lurker at 1 speed.

Ok thanks.

Thanks chief!

Mira i liked her weapon is other games and i really her abilty. I later on bought hibana and yeahhhh shes my most played OP by alot
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter really since it‚Äôs cosmetic, just get what looks good to you.
---
Didn‚Äôt use him until recently, greedy players always want his assist points
---
I don't want one at all
---
Or [this](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
I don‚Äôt think so. That sounds crazy
---
Lion, because when I very first started, I played against him (this is operation Para Bellum) I thought he ability was so broken and useful so I decided to get him ad a handicap to being new and bad at the game
---
U get stuck?
---
I take it you've been in gold for a very long time
---
Mira elite is one of my fav. But smoke would also be a good option.
---
The perfect play
---
It broke the game all three of those years
---
I‚Äôm kinda torn though ‚òπÔ∏è. I really like the look of Mira and Mute.
---
I'm not colorblind but I feel like a blind because holographic sights are not actually holographic but a dark red whatsoever without emission. Ubisoft do something!
---
Hear hear
---
Who do you play more out of the two then?
---
Those are the two I‚Äôm torn between but also mute
---
Where do you get this screen?
---
Mira is my main
---
Then get her :)
---
Most people would just just fire and show bm
---
Ps. We lost the round against a high pinging Squad. But won the match.
---
This comment makes me laugh so hard. There's 2 captured drones and five camera options. And no, there's not a dokabi as you can see the echo drones
---
Twitch if you want an advantage
---
Dont give them a reason to ban
---
What‚Äôs the end product gonna be
---
it was removed because, in combination with crouch spamming, it would be a ton harder to hit, but since they‚Äôre not bouncing back and forth, and the animations have been changed a bit, lean spamming wouldnt work, and it‚Äôd just make the game quicker when peeking
---
Very original
---
I‚Äôm just a really indecisive person in nature so I guess which ever one I get I‚Äôll regret not getting the other so yeah! I‚Äôll get Mira thx xxx
---
First of all why tf that Doc have all 3 stems and go out there with less than 75 hp? He probably wouldve made it too if he had healed
---
It's gonna be a nixie tube display
---
IKR
---
Glad to see a cav who actually plays cav and not just use the handgun the whole round. I've lost more rounds cause a cav does that then I have one swapped to the SMG or shotgun
---
I never really liked the mute one tbh.
---
I think outside should be covered by "helicopters" üöÅ and snipers like it would be in the "real world".
---
Hoping out a windows, capping someone, jumping back in always takes me out of the moment.
---
Maybe it could be a future operator that calls this skill in? Just ideas ‚ò∫
---
Someone‚Äôs a Jackle/Echo main
---
Ebic
---
Huzzah! A doc of quality!
---
I only really like the mask, my faves are smoke and Mira. Smoke‚Äôs victory animation is cooler but I prefer Mira‚Äôs skin
---
Iq and doc
---

I didn‚Äôt actually start ranked until I got my new systemDuring Parabellum

Ash:Oh god... RUN!!!!!!!!!
---
*Thunk Thunk*
---
Rook: GIMME SNACKS!!!!
---
I got hibana's bc shes my main. You should probally get it for your main
---
Quick peeking WAS the problem
---
Agree with what you said, I miss those days. I had more than a full squad of friends that played daily. I could give callouts and help even if I got killed. Now? If that was me in OP's shoes, I would have been vote kicked because I didn't go kamikaze like I was playing COD.
---
Not a lot, but definitely spooks me.
---
Yeah I just figured that out as well.
---
The only shot that even came close to hitting the head was the first one, and it was still a miss
---
It needs some dubstep in the background
---
Dying light fucks up aim for me lmao
---
Attacking operator name: Steve
---
Primary weapon: Diamond sword
---
Secondary weapon: Bow and arrow
---
Unique ability: Diamond pickaxe - Steve can use his diamond pickaxe to mine a reinforced wall, which drops as an item that anyone can pick up and use to reinforce a different wall
---
Happy cake day
---
I had a lot of fun playing him and I hate greedy people in siege it‚Äôs a team game
---
Yeah its kinda annoying
---
Acog, suppressor too if you can control it and like to make the other team mad
---
A little bit ago I was in a casual match and I was 3 stacking with friends. One of the randoms ended up in a 1v5 so we started a vote kick on them. The vote was 3/4 and the random was clutching it up getting it to a 1v1 with like 40 hp. It was looking good until out of nowhere it said round lost. The random got kicked mid clutch.
---
No problem just next time make a quick research on the sub.
---
Smonky boi
---
Incredible shot doc

Top floor of Chalet needs some love though.

---
My advice is if it's not fun for you to play anymore, dont. I've been playing for over two years now myself and the past two seasons have been very frustrating. Theres no point playing a game that just makes you mad. Or just try taking a break and playing other games for a while.
---
Hello An_Alt_009, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dfp0q0/casual_isnt_fun_anymore_due_to_matchmaking/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

40 percent worth which is close to a controlling share asshole

Thats the best part of this game
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xxEfFjvwhZw
---
What stat website is that
---
shotgun, your attack main (when he was older) took no skill and donns defense main takes no skill (other than knowing ads spots).  blitz got nerfed because of how annoying it was to try and fight him 1v1. please dont just say shoot him in the legs or throw a c4 because any good blitz/shield player can bait a c4 or know when to crouch. i agree that the ads time is too much and really shouldnt have happened but honestly there isnt much anybody can do about it.  
---
Lets all just be happy that they didnt keep the original blitz operator idea
---
Sights have nothing to do with ADS time.
---
I think it is a lot better. They made it shinier, less gloomy. More open and the OBJs are a lot better.
---
Ah yes, the classic case of "FUCKIN TIMING". Happens quite often even today.
---
SAS is 3 speed too
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone in the Siege community asked for this

Well at the time, Ranked was just casual with more rounds and tracked MMR.
---
Is there gonna be a way to watch it
---
It's an interesting story though. He also said that there wasn't any story in Siege, so I mean it was his choice though it's still interesting.
---
But I still made the idea, and said it would be useful. People disagreed. That‚Äôs all.
---
The op can just ask the shadow bot on r/shadowban

Wow. If i was that IQ player i would have just left the game.
---
Castle buff we need.
---
I'd prefer they rework maps that are actually good before they take an unbalanced map (Hereford)  and turn it into something boring 
---
Personally the two maps I'd like to see reworked are border and oregon, I like both of them but feel like they're kind of repetitive 
---
A map that I think could be turned into something decent is chalet
---
Why would they take balls? To cave in to popular opinions and needlessly be political just to make arm chair activists happy?
---
Seriously. It's a little boring right now because I only seem to get the same 5 maps, but when I first started playing (right before ember rise) I was really excited because there was so many maps:/
---
I think you just didn't hit him. The last two bullets I think hit the wall because he was moving out of the way. At least, that's what I'm seeing.
---
I remember this post. Lots of people were being toxic about the idea, and now I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre the same people that are praising Ubi that it was added.
---
True. Maybe I'll update if it works out good and try to let everyone else know lol
---
I think you were right in thinking that there should be a place for people to learn ranked, so there is that.
---
it‚Äôs just you guys don‚Äôt have text chat
---
Favela
---
Idk could‚Äôve sworn I did
---
People like all the poor ideas on here and hate the good ones, unlucky man.
---
I agree on they take good maps and make them better but skyscraper is too unbalanced to be in this game right now
---
Yeah. A lot of people had this idea, and as for implementation of unranked, I think it's been a failure. Somehow it's incentivized toxicity and it's full of all the try hards, yet also somehow they don't give a shit, but they still are toxic about winning.
---
it‚Äôs a circle jerk i‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre being deleted
