You’re fuckin ten ply bud

I think this will be in the live game once next season drops as well as 3:30 in casual instead of 4:00.
---
Thankyou. I agree that it should be quieter, I exaggerated the sound just so that people not listening through headphones would have a good idea of what’s going on in the video.
---
Scorpion is the most unreliable weapon in the game 
---
My problem in movies is that people in movies that have guns fighting an unarmed man by running up to point blank just to get punched.
---
That looks like a headshot
---
Lmao no 
---
If I could do it, I would 
---
Where is thermite?
---
Looking for ladies to play with,im one myself. Uplay is Eva--. If you have a discord please inv me
---
Definitely a headshot 
---
You also missed the part where I said those traps are lethal while the airjab is not which is why they're more identifiable.
---
The first two on the left are the only ones that makes sense. Both actually look Asian along with the last pic but the first two actually look Japanese. The third one looks American and the fourth one looks like an alien.
---
Ventilation shafts but not much anymore
---
Pretty dope
---
OnE v OnE mE
---
That's the exact reason people Smurf it's why I did it a bunch during red crow since it was so easy to get diamond
---
It looks great, nice job! 
---
Congratulations mate
---
No this is forbidden fuze only loves the potato
---
THATS THE POINT! why should players like beaulo be able to tip fire while others players cant? its because they are tryhards. 
---
Oh intresting
---
I had the exact same problem a couple days ago. What’s happening is the game is not fully installed yet, so you are using the vanilla version of the game, meaning the updated Glaz scope is not in it yet, so that results in a glitch where you can’t use his sniper scope at all. Just wait till the game is fully installed to do it, or just do it, you don’t really need it tbh

We sont play ranked. We just go fuck around in terrorist hunt. Theres always fun to be had there.
---
Yeah I like this change. Casual will still be bad but it’ll be better to prepare for rank since you can see what site you are defending and better prepare for it with certain ops instead of guessing every round.
---
Im not really sure of any methods. I personally just made it a habit to drag down when I'm shooting. Maybe work on that or something?
---
Have you thought about weathering the helmet at all? Looks a bit too shiny/plastic and might be remedied with a bit of weathering or sanding

DAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMNNN

The sheer amount of Ela boners this sub pops...

also if they can do it without macros what's the problem?

Damn that makes two of us bruv

Im caught back by that kill on rook, jesus that was brutal

Yes! Happens to me as well.  Its usually in between rounds. I think it happens when u alt tab before the round is over then tab back in when it ends

How did loin fall to his death?

Have my children

He have the same acog as Finka and it looks like i've missed than language option. xd

Lmao good post

owo what's this?

I'd use it. 
---
Did I ask?

Thanks but i was meaning like a good picture to make my avatar the pro league skin
---
But if im correct, there is no way for me to know that you are correct, if you are correct
---
okay and what’s the point of posting this. 
---
Go back and look. Lmgs do it when it hits around 1/4 of the clip. Can't remember how many times I was playing around with them, then switched when I had enough bullets left xD Or panicked reload. 
---
No u
---
You didn’t say it directly, however other traps being lethal was your counter argument as to why they are deserved of being easily identifiable. 
---
I’m not going to resort to typing in all caps, however you clearly fail to understand what it is about nomad’s gadget that requires a rework. It’s not a case of *if* it needs one, it’s a case of *when* it will get one, and *what* the rework will entail, this post was just putting my own, and some of the communities idea’s into a video for other people to see.

Owo my LMG is full mounted and loaded, and it’s ready to shoot ;-)

Dota 2 has a company that has been creating a bot, that is meant to be a challenge against pro players. 2 years ago they had it developed to "in theory" play against itself in dota 2 until it learned what it's doing, and kept learning, until it could play a game itself, and beat the majority of pro players tested against it, last year was a full 5v5 team but both teams had the same characters since that's how far the bot has gotten, and itll eventually learn to be a standalone 5 man team of itself
---
The thing fucked up il try fix that 
---
r/hitboxporn
---
Looks good, the only I can think to improve it would be gloves.
---
It's ok, it was posted here about 3 months ago
---
Gun pretty good, gadget crap. I'd play her, if she had impacts.
---
Love the design of the op and the guns! Very detailed, great job! 
---
How can we help our lord feel better
---
Moist!
---
I didnt even noticed 
---
Mira, Maestro, Lesion, Valk, Rook, Jager, Smoke, Echo, Bandit, and Mute are generally more useful tho smh
---
Yeah.  Vigil's a great one.  My personal favorites are Cav and Alibi :p
---
I might start using Vigil tho, he seems fun to use
---
Np
---
You could download moot
---
Implying that she isn't the Princess of Brazil /s
---
Nah, she really does.  Her face actually looks like a sack of potatoes
---
So sad. F
---
I don’t really like Maestro. His gadget is pretty much a bulletproof camera, which you can get with a Doc, Vigil etc.
---
Lmfao I love this so much
---
what happens if you get 417 black ice. no one should go through that pain
---
Can confirm
---
Unfortunately we were only three when making this because no one else was online
---
The recruit speaks the truth
---
I think cosmetics should transfer but stats shouldn’t. Pc and console both play different games.
---
Acog is king!
---
Nooooo, his gadget is sooo much more.  The whole shooting thing is great, *especially* for countering hard breachers and breaching charges, as well as getting some chip damage on attackers, allowing your teammates to drop them in 1 or 2 less bullets, which is crucial, *especially* end round.  He can also shoot attackers while they're planting, which is incredibly useful.
---
Gets caught, deletes post
---
All hail our lord
---
I never thought someone would shipped them, anyway nice drawing! Keep it up!
---
you have to wait til next season to buy the year 3 pass
---
Maybe I just don’t know how to use him :P. I’m getting on now, and he’s definitely going to be the first that I use. Any tips on how to use him? 
---
Can you see the hours per operator?
---
My strat is to have absolutely no sense of self preservation. What ever happens, happens. Also, never go where they might look for you. Go into the weirdest spot you can find. You'll confuse the enemies long enough to kill them!
---
Articulate why you think he might be underpowered. 
---
Turn your fov up :)

That’s a big oof

We did this to a Mira yesterday.

It didn’t turn out well for Mira. 
---
oh bartlet i miss that map even tho y’all don’t like it 
---
Hey, Kaid main. Thoughts on AUG vs TSCG12? Aug needs a buff IMO, but I can’t use shotgun reliably. Too much vertical kick.....
---
&gt; First of all, HOW DARE THEY change Hibana to make her look more “Asian”. Who the fuck cares??!!!
---
I agree.  Hibana's operator card photo looks perfect, they should keep it.  
---
&gt;Then, WTF??? They change Cav’s face too??? In a way there is almost no visible difference whatsoever???
---
Yeah really.  The old one was better, now she looks like Dora the Explorer.  Her head is actually massive.
---
&gt;Also, PLEASE change Ela’s (my waifu) face!
---
Aight, making fun of the Queen of Poland is where I draw the line, pal.
---
I just say what you're all to scared to speak aloud.
---
So much talent! Goodjob!
---
 Clearly this was done on purpose. 
---
Nonetheless, I swear the loot roll is rigged. I've never gotten a win below 25%
---
Thanks totally forgot about it 
---
I'd give the 2$ (but I want you to make an educated reaction and not one based off of mine)
---
Your second point is weak since the issue is that the entire team hunts you down, not just Jackal. Your first point is also weak because it is often not viable for a roamer to do so. 
---
Lol
---
The first skin I ever opened was adh's G3 black ice.
---
When you are on drugs, you can be everyone, including Twitch.
---
Just play him how you'd play any anchor.  Use him with the deployable shield.
---
*USE THE ALDA!*  Use the Keratos.
---
Place your Evil Eyes near obj so you can protect reinforced walls from hard breaches and defend against attackers trying to break in or plant.
---
same lmao
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You okay?
---
They work well together like Kapkan and Frost and they're shipped so I had to make them a thing, thanks for the positive feedback. 
---
r/therealjoke 
---
Tbh it's not giving you much choice on the matter. You can't play fair in the situation.
---
Thanks 
---
Especially since this guy had to ruin a whole lot of other people's games to do this. (Unless he partied with people which I kinda doubt he did.)
---

---
Their boss is probably chanting clutch or kick in their headsets.
---
Calm down there, Agent 47.
---
You don't barricade kid's room because there's only one entrance from inside and it's cramped in there. It's much easier to defend from across the hall or in master and when the walls are blocked off you can't do that. It basically turns the room into a safe zone for attackers, while giving them an easy chokepoint to hold.
---
One in a million is 1*10^-6 in scientific notation. Missing this at 93, 95, 97, and 99 percent in a row would be 1.05*10^-6, with additionally missing it at 91% putting the odds at 9.45*10^-8, which is slightly less than one in ten million. (Slightly as in, the original fraction is 189/2,000,000,000
---
Rng - won bet
---
Never tell me the odds
---
Never heard of it...
---
Xbox has a Ubisoft sale and I think their website too.Its not on steam.
---
My favourite gun. You lucky devil.
---
Probably started a vote kick while telling them to clutch or kick because he got hit while trying to spawn peak.
---
So it’s not just me lol
---
I would but I’m on mobile and don’t know how. And I’m not using the official reddit app either.
---
I see that you don't play ranked with a squad 
---
I think you mean practically everyone. It's amazing how inconsistent faces are across all the cosmetics and pictures. 
---
You are not alone! 
---
I uninstalled it on PS4, then reinstalled it and I had all my saves so I think that it is.
---
Says the Frost main 😂

I do agree that they need more healers, but I think that this operator would be a little too overpowered
---
F
---
Yeah like I’m not about to stick up for my boi. 
---
He’s got the aim...but bomb will give him the game sense and experience! 
---
That "giggly boy" is letterman from the comment thread down a bit
---
execute order 66
---
Did you just call Ela your waifu? Yeah sorry I know her character a lot... No I'm not addicted to her but as my favorite character I know she loves no one, probably not even herself so yeah not your waifu. Not anyone's either. And no her beautiful face doesn't need a change as one it doesn't matter like you've said with the other ones and two Ubisoft like everything they do would make it shit. Or maybe that's what they want since Ela has been given a trash bin as guns and a dumpster loadout for gadgets.
---
Cav face change is bullshit. Hibana's is also bullshit as I don't remember anyone complaining. Oh wait Ubisoft does that all the time \*Ahem\* IQ and her one useful gadget asides breaches that Finka stole. But hey what will Ubisoft change next? Vigil's face? I mean maybe, even if he just has a mask.
---
Also also I don't care if you were joking but fuck you Earth is not flat. And feminism shouldn't exist in the US since probably most flat earthers believe that too.
---
Yep, fix your network. 
---
What if you lose?
---
My alpha pack before I stop playing mentality would have me up all night.
---
I check the comments on all the posts I thought were cool. That's so strange to me 
---
That too turned into 10000 internet points pretty quick.and the rewards of the alpha pack are usually so bad I take the 10,000 points lol
---
I like to think that if he misses again, the programmers didn't account for the possibility of over 100% chances, and it just wraps back around to a 2% chance.
---
I get them 90% of the time. So I gave up on ranked 
---
Is this the power of ultra instinct?
---
you're the one who made a post about how people shouldn't be able to click m1 multiple times in a row
---
Did you not see your other comments? I’m downvoting you now yes but that’s because you decide to continue this pointless argument. 
---
All you ever say is “ever consider other people’s feelings” 
---
And every time I say no because I’m not a brain dead normie who lets randoms on an online video game affect me. Not to mention no one gives a shit about your feelings online. Can’t take the heat then gtfo. 
---
I come from both sides of this argument my dude. Toxicity is a problem yes and it’s not good. However, censoring language and banning those for using said language is not a fix for it. As people will just figure their ways around it. 
---
Now I’m done with this pointless back and forth with your obliviousness. Have a nice day. 
---
한국인?korean?
---
Valkryrie would be proud of you
---
This is a good guide on how to run into the c4 room and rage quit before you even start playing 
---
Gratz man!
---
Rook and montagne look like they are about to push my shit in.
---
Nope
---
Nah, just go into settings and change your t hunt settings. Oh wait
---
O.O that was my expression
---
I had a five stack which helped me.
---
I started in Black Ice and I thought I remembered people talking about being removed right before the first year of DLC. Maybe I am crazy though
---
idk if it's weird but i always play better when i solo queue,rather than playing with friends which makes me anxious to hear the constant callouts and panicking! yes i got through plat3 this season being solo

It's the stuttering of operators my network doesn't have to do with any of this 
---
Blood Orchid was Y2S3 my guy. You should get the Year 4 season pass.

Year 4 Season 1: Australia Map and SASR Ops

Year 4 Season 3: Kafe Rework Peru and Mexico Ops

Oh damn I’ve been gone that long lmao alright I’ll totally do that. Did I really miss a whole season of content holy shit 
---
Finally, an operator I can relate to. Feelsbadman
---
could only get skin during limited time to late now
---
I have done some research and apparently it was in the beta but was removed before the game was released.
---
Omg they are doomed!
---
Best LMGs? (Talking offense here) PDW9 (fight me), 6P41, and LMG-E. Their main selling point is to provide sustained covering fire. Play with covering fire in mind (prefire when appropriate as well), and reload only when you have expended all bullets, or eat a long reload time (only applies to belt fed lmgs though)
---
Kenny
---
Yup you missed Y2S4 which was Dokkaebi and Vigil, and all of Year 3
---
Also man, I know you didnt ask about it, but I have had experiences with bad relationships in the past so if the girl wants you to stop gaming and look at her face and you dont have a compulsive gaming problem, boy that's a sign
---
Have fun out there bro. Lemme know if there's a question you have about new ops

That sounds like boiler plate legalese to protect themselves from even the smallest potential issue. It's important to keep in mind that at the point they said that they were also saying that it was extremely likely they'd sell packs at a later time which make those legalese even more important.
---
This doesn't mean they haven't removed items but it's not proof they have or do either, they just throw it in in case they ever need to for any reason even just to increase rarity of an item.

You’re probably his alt.  Fucking loser.  You’re probably gay for Thermite.  You’re probably all gay for each other.  You, green faggot, and a Glaz body pillow and a thermite body pillow are all probably in bed right now fucking each other.  How can you even defend his guy.  Oh wait, his gay ass is probably giving you a blowjob rn, and your gay ass is probably closing your eyes pretending it’s thermite
---
Like $7 AUD I think
---
I should try that next time 😂😂😂😂😂

---
I feel like this post is just one gigantic meme due to the fact your name is Zofia and one if the other people is named Ela and the fact that all three of these accounts have 123 at the end of them but who knows
---
Are you seriously telling me this shit? You even use "gay" as an insult? 
---
I’m convinced you’re a troll.
---
Worst change idea ever. Why would you give a defender an AR for fragging especially if the defender is 3 ARMOR? Stop complaining about the gun and be real with yourself
---
I was waiting for someone to make that connection as well.
---
This gives me anxiety to look at. That took some shear will power. 
---
Someone did the math and said that if you were on a win one lose one constant for matches that by the time you reached 50% chance for a roll there was a 90% chance you would have gotten an alpha pack already. 
---
At least they made cav's face less creepy and more like a woman
---
Pay him in exposure 
---
Screenshot where? 
---
Yeah, I am telling you this shit.  Fuck you for defending this guy
---
Read my comment. Also, dropping the damage of the r4-c will legit just make it an smg. If you want castle to have a high fire rate gun at least give him his own weapon + there are no complains about the ump. Take extended barrel and angled grip and have 0 recoil and good damage.
---
Just to clarify i'm not salty we lost, obviously we played worse than the other team and they deserved the win. However, the fact that their is no rank gap limit in competitive matchmaking is slightly ridiculous. Basically a person who is nearly the lowest rank should not be able to play in the same game as someone of the highest, because generally speaking it becomes a detriment to the team. I think they should implement something like csgo where you can only queue with like 4 ranks above or below you unless in a 5 stack. A team with such a massive rank disparity should quite honestly never be able to exist
---
I can assure you I have no affiliation with this guy or the Ela guy.  I have no alts, this is my only account.  
---
it was match point 
---
Im not defending him I am just telling you to stop insulting other people that did do anything to you and you to chill down! I mean what's even the point? 
---
NO
---
&gt;Yeah, I can see that.  But, in exchange, we could give a really high reward, like 10 alpha packs or something.
---
I'd love that, but I don't they'll do that.

No... he is not illuminate but if you spotted a yokai drone invisible it would be a little hard to spot but ghosts cloaking is a little easier to spot
---
I know how to uae the ump I aint a newbie, but the ump fits closer to pulse than castle.
---
Maybe she has a ammo box for ya know if you wanna run maestros shotgun ;)

Also
---
There's a snake in my boot

You are defending him.  Now I hate all 3 of you.  I’ll go  and add your username to the post, too

---
It's similar to glaz because they both have attachments on their guns which are the gadgets so to get a gadget kill it must be killing with their gadgeted guns
---
because he is completely broken OP, even worse than blitz at high level
---
Your names on the wall of shame too fucking idiot
---
EVERYONE GET READY TO BE MENTIONED IN PART THREE LATER TONIGHT SO JUST KEEP SORTING BY NEW
---
Do you like fucking losers 
---
Whos queen ela
---
Oh no its the end of the world, someone I dont know dosent like me! 
---
Well im starting to like you
---
I wouldn't advise leaning with mouse buttons since it throws your aim off
---
It was specifically designed for cavs kit and roaming based design also headshots to down. It could also be that they felt bad for people having to get interos to get gadget kills and wanted to throw them a bone 
---
Your conscunes cuz yodue a rufjcuit loser you ticketing bircu likcebeusjshejkd
---
I saw the first conversation got my Tag included in this one and still don't know what the hell is happening
---
Well I’m straying to fucking hate you fucjing green shadow loser
---
Oh no duck you that’s what oh not kebabs fuckifjdjsuakvkgld
---
English motherfucker do you know it?
---
But do u like bread
---
Na, you play him because you wouldn't win any gunfights without his crutch shield
---
I just keep asking him if he likes bread lol
---
Queen Ela morhwrfucker don’t you jerk to her like the fucking faggot

---
Damn good shot also please use the acog its really useful

Yeah but then I have to upload it from my browser on my computer taking time away from my ranked match. Plus it’s easier this way. I’ll appease you tomorrow if you’d like 
---
Multiple times in part three I hope
---
Ela looks lies. Fucking man.  That’s why You and shadow and the other fucking losers like her so much cuz you all like men cuz your fucking gay 
---
Casual is also for getting sweaty. 5 stacks of plats squashing and BMing silvers/gold's.
---
Yes you do.  Fucjing loser
---
Part 3 is just for you.  The likyeetis and elamain special:  fuckface mcfuckface
---
eSporTs reADy !!!
---
I understand your sentiment but given they're both *different* cuts of Badger's video it's not a repost, just two people making the same thing.
---
Shut up stinky zofia main
---
i literally can't picture a worse clip lmao 
---
I'm salty? XDDD look at your comment! Ash would be good yes but you can say it for any operator if you take their weapon and leave them with another xddd
---
Also you forgot that they still need coding to remove the r4-c from Ash and give it to castle.
---
lmaoooo you are insane dude! I don't about the ACOG cause Ash mains don't use the r4-c for the acog dummy XDDDD i'm still using it with holo :) Seems as you are crying and not me :) also seems as you are triggered about Ash, a simply operator, maybe you should post about removing the r4-c from Ash instead of hiding your shame with a stupid Castle buff. 
---
GIT GUD KIDDO
---
Thanks man I appreciate it
---
That's intentional. I take it you didn't play the game at launch? When every part of a character model counted as the hitbox and GSG9 ops were getting head shot left and right because their earmuffs apparently contained bits of their brains. Oh and can't forget that SAS ops stored their medulla oblongata in their gas mask filters.
---
Start watching some video for maps and how operator work. Go on terrorist hunt and start messing with sensitivity so you find what is comfortable for you.
---
Nah, usually they’re always the guys that rush, 1 tap me, and get the most kills in the game. They’re extremely good most of the time which is why I hate playing against them cause I have no chance
---
It's not ok to throw in Casual either, but I think you'd sleep better knowing this wasn't done in Ranked.
---
Most of AnJ (ash and jager) mains play them for weapons. They will tk if you wont let them play  them and will run and talk shit. Run and Gun. This is not cod. BUTT! if you see an Ash or Jager main that are playing for fun and gadget, give them a "u r cool bro". 
---
Q and E
---
I think it's when you kill during silent step
---
Same
---
That was amazing
---
Q E.
---
I tried to look for better ones but it seems as there aren't. At least for me
---
Maybe not have a another Sig P200 series as pistol, maybe something like a tec-9 or another revolver like a raging bull or even a single action like a colt .45.
---
Use Q for right lean and E for left Lean. 
---
wait people still chalk that up to toxic? I type 2ez regardless of outcome hell I type it when I lose and im the worse player.
---
honestly if you chalk any regular trash talk (you're bad, you're trash, gitgud, 2ez, ect) up to being toxic then you are wrong. 
---
If you like playing Frost with her ~~Sniper 90~~ Super 90 shotgun then you can still buy a bundle which includes Black Ice for it.
---
This is 200IQ, I might try this 
---
Mouse side buttons
---
Debated this, but felt like it would mess with my aim 
---
What the fuck happened to Jager's neck?
---
Does it get taken out if they use EMP on the hatch? It looks like it could just be in the zone.
---
they could have built a new data type that overflows at 100 thats not the problem
---
It will change based on who you are teamed up with, as player skills get higher in ranks you tend to see more Ash mains failing to get easy kills by run and gunning as people are more aware of it.
---
If anything it ends up being that they rage quit from said games where they got taken out, find games where perhaps people aren't readily expecting it and get their kills, rinse and repeat until death, rage quit, requeue, etc.
---
Sounds relatively unfun to play that way in such a game, if you ask me but many clearly get their kicks out of it. 
---
A mad man like sledge but he can dig under the map and pop out of nowhere
---
He's the 'operation health is designed for fixing and repairing the game' guy. 
---
my man you have a 4c/4t cpu in a day and age where some games (battlefield V) people say you need atleast 6c/12t cpu. honestly you should have atleast a 4c/8t cpu and you would be fine (depending on cpu).
---
Same but i have corsair harpon so they fuc up a bit when clicking some times because its so cheap
---
They are. But mods here only delete what they don't like.
---
page up and page down
---
correct me if im wrong, but i don't think that's allowed in pro league.
---
I believe they do post new updated patch notes after TTS and just before season start, however the initial patch notes shown before TTS is to let people know what is on the TTS itself as to know what they can try out and test out.
---
That’s doesn’t sound good to hear lol I’ll keep it in mind
---
I was like "how does that post have so many upvotes!?!?" and then ended up upvoting it, too.
---
russianbadger
---
That's something that I had to get used to. Some pro players will bind their shooting buttons to keyboard, too, to eliminate any micro-movements in their mouse, especially in arena shooters like Quake. In Siege when you're playing at a very low sens though I find it acceptable to bind things on the side buttons 
---
You pull that off and just say lol?
---
Don't be in a hurry to get into plat on console. Get ready for kb/m and scuff warriors crouch peeking everything now. 
---
Yup
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
We do have designated flankers. It's called roamers 
---
Pretty sure In the bottom left on the home page where it tells you about new bundles and stuff there will be a slide that leads to the patch notes page
---
Did you read the entire thread?
---
And the only ones who actually use voice chat are screaming children. And when their mom tells them to go to bed they teamkill twice and get a ban instead of just leaving the match 
---
the amount of times i’ve genuinely seen this.

It feels weird at first but you will adapt to it very quickly. Someone on PUBG subreddit suggested me this!
---
If they got put into a separate queue I’d be fine with it. The current users don’t care about that though. They don’t want to play MnK, they want to get easy wins so that they can feel an unearned sense of accomplishment. 
---
But you’re still cheating so..... 
---
Okay?
---
Error: File size too large. 
---
A separate queue would mean longer queue times, add that on-top of the new queue being added in the next season and the times would be extremely long.
---
Reminds me Wilson
---
Idk about any websites or anything but theres quite a few r6 discord communities out there but you have to find them by playing. What are you playing on?
---
By default its not something Ubisoft endorse or allow. 
---
You can bypass the restrictions as it isnt natively supported on Siege, with an adapter that mimics the controller, tricking the xbox/ps4 into thinking the control is being used but infact its actually a M/K set up. 
---
Not sure if anything can be done about it due to the nature of the adapter and how it manipulates the systems. 
---
Nothing will be obsolete about the hardware people have bought already, the idea that people have in their head when they buy the adapter and mouse/keyboard is their ability to be better than those with controller, they dont want to be on an equal playing field otherwise they would have went and played on pc.
---
Nice idea but it still doesnt tackle the current influx of XIM users. 
---
He didn't throw anything the percent only goes up if you miss a role. And you only.get a roll if you win
---
Wasn't it shown that the TS was the universal build since it had the mannequin kill icon and stuff?
---
Nomad is 10x better for flankwatch

what does this question mean?

I really like how a shitty drawing of Dokkaebi or Tachanka can get more likes than this \^\^

Damn, I only started playing in Para Bellum and still never bought a single skin until this season I got the "year of the pig." I just couldn't ever be fucked to save up 30 renown when there were ops I needed to get instead. Really wish there'd be an event where you could buy old skins. Can you get the seasonal skins in alpha packs still? 
---
Was watching the same vid not long ago lmao

While we are at keybindings. Please dont tell me I am the only one who put crouch on space to spam it better :/
---
“Have a chance to instantly get rid of his advantage” I mean what advantage will he have then if he can’t effectively peek windows? It’s what he’s made for. He’s not someone who can run inside a building as he’s too sluggish and slow. He’d struggle without an effective shield unless you buffed movement or ads. 
---
Thats a pretty good idea tbh
---
It was a 4v5 the whole game because one of our teammates kept saying the N word and we let him have it for being human garbage. He left first round before we got the chance to TK him. 
---
Jager looking like a fucking archon
---
Wanna play some poker? 
---
Yeah but the point is the gap would be very hard to his idk if it would have to be smaller or something, the idea is that a good player could quickly break the shield but it would be hard and risky to do as they would have to pop up and aim at it. 
---
Maybe  a charm of hockey buck or stick, Mable syrupe or Canadian flag or emblem
---
Well buck didn’t have camouflage in the first place so why not 
---
Nothing to see here mr admin. Just a regular image.

Porb bc people see 1  dot whrn tbey shoot at each other lmao

The EGG IS BACK

Be a shield op
---
Lol yeah especially when he is under the floorboards opening everything above 
---
Yes! A hockey stick would be perfect. This is so Canadian lol
---
He is not retired. He never made a statement of leaving Twitch
---
Also they just rerolled the previous streamer charms, regardless if they still stream or not so there is no reason not to include Tangy

It ain't that simple

Chances are if you play oregon basement you are gonna have a mute

My highest was in Para Bellum and Chimera, I was Gold 2, there were multiple times where I was 1 win away from Gold 1... For some reason I couldn't hit anything higher than Gold 4 in Wind Bastion, even though I'm playing with the same friends, let's hope next season will be better. (My placements are really shitty recently, but I'm proud of my Para Bellum push, started in Bronze 3, finished in strong Gold 2.)

Remember when the lava skin actually looked cool but it looks like it's in 240p resolution

thank you

It was a pun to do with the dlc coming our soon(on the horizon) and the lava skin(burnt)

Believe it or not they where just using words that ads use

Interesting considering on the board in the Thatcher film they had a bunch of pictures of pantheons and other Greek stuff
---
that suck coz ive been playing on console for quite some time and i would like to see the cosmetics i have to move to pc... ubi should add such a feature
---
You've clearly never played XCOM.
---
The same Day as PC
---
In order to be faithful to the real operator it would have to be absolutely useless

Watch it be a common.
---
Yeah I hear ya, I was level 250+ on XB1 before I made the switch to PC. 
---
You talking to yourself?
---
If you were vaulting it properly you would dive head first and slide over it. But Ubi suck 
---
It happens more often to me, too. From what I can tell I just got better in the game and matchmaking works good.

Thank you comrade**salute**

They had us in the first half. Not gonna lie.

Montagne needs higher standards

Surprised FM was so high for so long

I am very much in high school, I specifically told this kid to play Terrorist Hunt, I went out to eat my lunch because I was forced to keep him company for a while. I came back just in time to the Rook eat buckshot from him.

I yelled at him as well.

Wednesday 6th is the date that Ubisoft has mentioned in the desc. Of the hibana elite set which releases with the launch of Burnt Horizon. 
---
They will probably announce it tomorrow. 
---
However, theres still some bugs that they have yet to fix and so they may extend the test server a further week. 
---
The drone sounds like a awesome idea!
---
do you know what is a repost?
---
I'm pretty sure this is the drill ops use when they put barricades
---
The PR-15 Ragun which is the RG-15 was designed in Poland so no it's not a Russian gun. Also why would you use a silencer on a gun that has the most range out of anything in Ela's kit? It's supposed to be the backup for the Scorpion when someones not 2 inches in front of you and the back up for when someones 30 feet in front of you.
---
SMONG looks dope asf
---
Yeah, I feel scammed.

It’s the same image and joke ppl have posted like a 100 times on this sub. Does this not qualify as a repost?

My friend uses lime green on every "Bad"  gun, he'll whip it out and say, "Gotta disrespect 'em with that lime green". I'm under the impression that it was a universal skin.
---
i said: do you know what is a repost?
---
If you're willing to do the research, you can build a PC good enough to run siege better than your console for ~$500.  Sure you can't max the settings but you'll be competitive with it.
---
It doesn’t glow like the image above and it looks like the aftermath of a gun dipped in molten lava.

Starter edition is no longer a thing.

thank you :3

It feels like it's been ages since they started advertising y4s1. I've been playing the game since release but can't tell if they're actually taking forever this time or if I'm just anticipating it more than I have in the past. On that note, have there been any concrete dates released or should I still expect it to be weeks away? 
---
Lol not true. 
---
wait what about other maps though
---
as opposed to straight emojis?
---
r/R6OperatorCreator
---
Dope idea, but might need some tweaking
---
I was just throwing out an approximate number, My point was that it doesn’t have any more range than other shotguns, it’s effective in the range its supposed to be. Hating shotguns in general in one thing, but singling out hers over others I don’t see. I think they’re are a few better shotguns in the game.
---
Someone doesn't look before taking a step... It's just the emojis tho...

do you actually think anyone who stumbled across this checked the comments, much less read this wall of text?

That last sentenced saved this whole thing holy fuck
---
Im legit confused why anyone who has played this game longer than a couple of weeks would want ro play it solo. Since launch ive always played with my friends. Tried solo one time after we had a good afternoon and it was night and day difference.
---
because you could have taken the extra 40 seconds to format so that way it didnt look like a POS writeup thats just you complaining
---
These casters are very pleasant to listen to I must say

Wow incredible
---
This would be cool in-game.

It’s on sale like every week

Dope ideas btw, might be a bit strong, but with some tweaking, they can work

If you're playing with random, not scanning is a good thing!:D

m8, you might just want to get a newer CPU and MOBO I currently have a Z370 MOBO from MSI and an I5-8500 and it runs siege at 144 FPS and quite stable
---
What rank are you playing? 🤮
---
Try playing on 1000-500 dpi. Also bind your keys to something comfortable to you
---
Doesn't thanks have gloves?
---
Yeah. Figured that would happen.
---
Doesn't tachanka have gloves?
---
I guess this wouldn't be depending on movement.
---
r/SiegeAcademy and also, if your on PC 16:9 is what you should use if you like ACOG, 4:3 if you like HOLO sight and 3:2 or 16:10 for both are the general recommmendation
---
alright thanks

Aspect ratio doesn't make anything bigger, it makes it *look* bigger.

My friends aren’t always around, we work different schedules. I like siege and sometimes just want to play, even if none of my friends are on.

I just hope they use protection, who knows where that exhaust has been? 
---
thanks, I have the picture pre-death if you want to see that as well

Need bright for the skin!... Come on Ubi...

Dude I don’t care my only point was this isn’t a recent thing siege has done. I really don’t give a shit if it’s unrealistic the point of the game is to have fun.

If so, what are the conditions?
---
Yes, he can only see through smoke and highlight enemies when he's standing still.
---
An amazing photo

You misspelt Caveira.

I knew what
---
How did you manage to make it look used? 
---
He's a 1 speed attacker 
---
I'm pretty sure all 1 spewed attackers are supposed to have shields
---
So gridlock is special in some way (but she has good guns)
---
Rip
---
Fortnite did it
---
That's not how every round goes dude. Just think about how broken that would be. Having to waste a grenade or Zofia impact or ash charge to gain entry or face certain death? There's a reason every trap in the game thus far is destructible to bullets. Idk I just think its astronomically overpowered. Also I forgot to change my flair but I'm an IQ main so it's not like I could deal with the trap anyway.
---
Ohhhh....yeah I feel like he needs further balancing to be in a good place.  That's what I meant lol.  I was asking if he was going to be reworked.  Lol
---
The tedious part is intentional? Makes it harder for defenders to abuse it. And did you not see his idea for balancing it? 
---
Attackers are used to having drones on their side, while defenders might need the extra icon to be told to not shoot the drone. That's why I think they didn't give attackers the same outline at least
---
Lol aight.  I get that
---
U made my day. Here, have an upvote
---
I don’t remember, what beef did she receive after para bellum?
---
Silver paint
---
Is it just me or is this comment clearly legible and just missing some words/punctuation.
---
Is there a plan to buff ela? She's one of the most under picked operators
---
Im pretty sure he's getting a complete rework (which means he won't be Tachanka anymore I think) but imo they should probably buff him by making him able to take the gun of the mounting
---
I was disappointed when I didn't see that name in the lineup
---
Specifically looking at Capitao and how it was quickly determined that his buff was to strong and how fast they removed it.
---
Why does it take so long to fix/buff/nerf something? Why did it take 9 months to lower some damage numbers and increase recoil for Ela? Why when you knew Lion was grossly overpowered has it taken a FULL year before something is being done to him AND from what we've see is just removing the outline?
---
i think the mountie is the obvious choice. for the animation id rather have him sitting on the horse and then have it buck up onto its rear legs (sort of like on the ferrari [logo](https://moneyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ferrari-Logo-750x469.jpg)) then he turns to the camera
---
In Parabellum, she didn't have the weird horizontal recoil, it was just vertical recoil that went up in pretty much a straight line, which made her balanced.  In Grim Sky, they increased her horizontal recoil.  I think she got a tiny damage buff tho, not sure, to 23 damage instead of 21 or 22 or whatever it was
---
Yeah I do totally see the issues. I think it would take a lot of work to keep it balanced but I still this it would be a fun addition to the game if it’s ever added
---

Vote to kick  jaki003 (4/4)
---
Can you tell me how to do something like that?
---
jaki003 has been removed from the match
---
Tbh I wish they actually tried on the seasonal uniforms, this seasons uniforms for mozzie and gridlock barely look different
---
Damascus steel is so nice
---
I prefer reinforcing the hatch on that floor into obj and the wall directly behind it. Returning to site and throwing my claw up to cover both those walls. 
---
Speaking of alpha packs I've gotten over 6 commons in a row! It's getting ridiculous.
---
This is so good and wholesome! Make more soon &lt;3
---
*looks at SASG-12*
---
Lord talks to me..
---
imo they shouldn't remove it but nerf it because they are already making ADSing slower
---
Vigil Nailing is head, because is parents are dead :)
---
she just need recoil to be completly changed to be managable again and reduce her mag size to 30. Everything else is fine where it is
---
But I've been thrown into ongoing ranked matches as well? Or did they fix that? 
---
Exactly
---
You cant watch the DLC op videos ingame, no Idea why tbh
---
just go on youtube and search for *operator* Video R6siege
---
Ash and jager rolled in one
---
Unfortunately yes people are toxic in this game a lot
---
Yeah man i even heard chernobyl is less toxic than the community and they are just jealous and shamed becuz a level 7 is on top of them
---
Yep
---
Will get any way to properly warm up without going into realistic TH or casual to help us with our aim?
---

---

---
I wouldnt mind her getting either k1a or mp5 xD
---
Ohhh you may be right 
---
Ye I've literally thought about that since I started playing I just cant see it being a thing :(
---
This game is the biggest salt mine in the world
---
I won't upvote this and the problem is likely with your mates internet, as for the hacker. He will be banned in a week or two
---
Mouse pad is brand new, so it’s very smooth, I clean my mouse every week, and my drivers are all updated so yeah, everything is fine in that area. As far as posting a video I spent all day yesterday messing with Sens and found something I’m comfortable with and I’ve given up on the 800 dpi, so I’m gonna just stay where I’m at 
---
K so 
---
1. find a squad at least 2 other people to ply with consistently playing solo is fine but the R6 is a lot about communication and teamwork 
---
2. If you can’t find a team don’t give anyone a reason to just vote kick you 
---
It will probably happen for no reason whatsoever anyway 
---
As for actually playing the game 
---
Depending on how much experience you actually have with shooters don’t be afraid to play at your own pace take corners slowly if you need to 
---
Look up map guides knowing the map and call outs are important when your dead it’s your job to SAY where people are don’t spam ping you often only need one and they will move or shoot the cam 
---
“Use every part of the buffalo” 
---
You have a lot at your disposal and everything has a use and EVERYTHING in your kit should be used in a typical round 
---
Use your drones it’s basically free wall hacks once you get good at it 
---
There are a lot of thing to learn in siege and the community is not very welcoming but it is worth it  
---
Yeah but they actually try to make the SI and esports skins different 
---
That's true, the am 12 is really good and the Russian LMG too
---
LMAO no he wont
---
Her weapon is so shit that even if you are hit by her gadget as any attacker, you still have advantage in firefight
---
they didn't lose their ACOGs because of spawnpeeking lol they lost it bc roamers were dictating &amp; winning too many fights. ACOGs on defense are ok for 3 speeds, bc it's balanced w them being on shitty guns (besides Maestro, maybe remove ACOG for him) but the MP5s all have average fire rate w below average damage, &amp; all 3 speeds are slow as fuck. ACOGs on defense are totally balanced.
---
No you can’t noob
---
Thats honestly amazing.
---
How it looks in game. They were showing the skin with pro players before release and it looked way better. 
---
I love how jackal just swoons in with Lion
---
So it's from the Six Invitational 2019, if it's that easy OP could have just said it in the title. It's not on us to search for the source.
---
Lion is perma banned in competitive scene until reworked. ANd those stats are from Invitational
---
“Sponsored.” I also said it aloud, you’ll just need to take my word for it.
---
Damn. The worst I've ever had is 75%, missing, and then getting it next match.
---
The pack rewarded me a Common.
---
A new price scaling system will go into effect at the start of year 4. Price of DLC operators will be based on how long they have been available. Longer an operator has been available the lower the price.

yeah it’s the old, pudgy looking twitch from pre red crow. they buffed her looks lol 
---
Oh thank you for the info!
---
Realistically? It wouldn't. No increase and one roll for 6 wins in thunt? That's close to none alpha packs per month across all playerbase 
---
He will. Just you watch 
---
Can confirm 
---
How do you get up there?
---
How do you feel about Mozzie and gridlock? Too op, needs a buff? What are you planning on doing with them 
---
I mean it did have siege.gg's logo on the bottom and the invitational logo up in the top right corner. I think you should work on your critical thinking skills. 
---
I never understood this. Sure she has weapons she is comfortable with, but the moment she picks up anything else the lore is shattered?
---
I think they want it to be different in that has bigger mag than most guns but do you really think the concussion effect doesn’t need a buff? 
---
watch out for me special move
---
It is basically a DMR with less range as it fires Slug rounds instead of buckshot.
---
I'd never be able to even if I tried😂
---
I think he’s talking about the animated artwork in the middle and not the background 
---
I know that you can play discovery first and that’s what I already do. But I’m not gonna play this all the time and it’s always annoying to play the new map in ranked when you don’t fully understand it.
---
For an equivalent PC you'll pay lot less.  You'll be paying extra for that portability advantage .
---
So you disagree with it disabling sprinting again?
---
No it's not lol, horizontal recoil can't be controlled, and that weapon has one of the worst for the AR category. 
---
Xbox 
---
Situation 8 in a nutshell
---
The mp5 is still better
---
I’m just used to it
---
I don’t want to play discovery playlist 24/7 until I know the map though just for the off chance I’ll get it in ranked 
---
Oh ok, I'll look into just regular pc's
---
Why is the debris from barricades not reverted to like it was before?
---
Not talking about client side debris here, the broken pieces that get stuck once broken thereby obstructing view, this started happening later, it wasn't an issue before and why is this not addressed, if not reverted. 
---
sounds interesting but they would have to add a social playlist first.
---
weird flex but ok
---
It uses 9mm pistols rounds and has the same damage charts as a standard smg. 
---
Are the rumors true about using Uplay points to buy booster packs?
---
Frost is one of the worst ops, change my mind

If you beat the T hunt within 1 minute then you can’t get renown that why if you grind T hunt play recuse the hostage so you can just return the hostage right at 1 minute

My point is that why should I get punished for walking two floors away. The realistic point isn’t what does it for me. It’s the same as lion and dokk- it’s straight BS. Just because I walked somewhere 10 seconds ago doesn’t mean you get to know my exact location 15 seconds later

That one is so good. Outbreak packs had such awesome skins too! I wish they'd repeat the event (or something like that) again this year.
---
Yeah, he didn't have walls, I got the drop on him a few times. But they were definitely not using a controller. Was really more upset with MnK on console, especially in my placements after taking a 3 month break.
---
Thank you and I understand the trapper thing just didn't wanna bring it up. My problem with rushes isn't so much that they are hard to counter but rather they take little to no skill or tact to pull off which was the big part of the 2nd possibility on how to limit them. Rather then completely remove them make it were you can instead work and build it.
---
For instance within 15 seconds just saying on ranked were you can pick your attacking spawn and the maps border. They enemy takes armory well in that 15 seconds your thermite and thacher can be ready to breach the outside reinforced walls on armory while you and your other 2 teammates set up to rush the other side. 15 seconds up you do it and within the 15 seconds to though all the defenders got set up further too so now a kapkan main like you got all your traps in the correct position you want them In or even managed to find and set them were the enemy is rushing through at manage to get their ash with 2 traps all this while a jager prepared to run out. Basically it's meant to be like a prep phase for attackers to get were they wanna get rather then get instantly mowed down by the jager running out
---
I love the facelessness. Encourages people to discuss their ensemble rather than their appearances
---
Yeah Id fucking love that skin man Ive been playing fo r to long to have such shit legendaries
---
Tachanka=Daddy
---
I honestly wouldnt be surprised..
---
Oooooh
---
the plat is my buddy and he's only like 50 - 100 points in.
---
So no, I don't see that being the reason, even if he was high plat 3 , there's a big difference between that and a diamond.
---
Don't play to win. When I stopped caring about winning, I had a lot more fun. Do stupid strats. Punch penises into the walls. Recruit Rush. Its all for fun.
---
I believe that it hurts newer players too. I'm sure a lot of them hear all about the "Lord Tachanka xddd" meme and will unironically play as him because of that meme. It doesn't really help the game if you ask me.
---
When will we get servers that keep ping abusers (or just bad pings) from joining rooms when their ping is so far above everyone else, it’s pointless to play with them?
---
Any player with a ping that’s so blatantly high shouldn’t even be able to join the room. Having a 20 ping playing against a 400 ping gets a little ridiculous. It affects the whole room. 
---
Caviera: *slowly hands the hostage to monty*

---
Oh a fuze main wants to talk about friendly fire huh?
---
The actual gsg-9 wear adidas military boots that navy seals will pay to get
---
It's not a buff at all. I think he meant to say that the reset HP is now closer to Zofia's own self-revive ability.
---
I have noticed and died by it. In a way, I think it's a good thing. It makes run and gun less viable. I wouldn't be surprised if it was an intentional feature.
---
EXPELLIARMUS
---
Oh :c
---
What about lean on console without Aiming down sights like how pubg also has it or atleast having pro controller support in it like nacon razor etc.
---
moreover a text chat to greet gg after matches😉
---
So you think he needs a buff because pro players don’t use him?
---
Hey Epi, thanks for coming on.
---
I was just wondering about maps, specifically Favela and Bartlett. This might just be a personal thing, but I absolutely hate Favela. It is way too attacker sided. Especially considering that room that has all breachable walls leading outside, and when you're on bomb, there aren't enough reinforcements to do both objectives. I was just wondering if something is ever going to happen with that map?
---
And as for Bartlett, is that map ever going to get reworked and added back? I really do like that map, but it has so many issues that make it a community-disliked map.
---
no such thing as friendly fire, only acceptable casualties  
---
Fuze 2 Speed, and better trajectory on the pucks

Nice! Although maybe change the plastic thingys to string or leather?

Wow. Balanced much?

Fuze

Bring back the insane puck bug

yeah, which is why i don't get it. Why give Zofia the ability to whitstand at 1hp , and then make the reset as effective as her passive?  
---
r/upvotesmeanimright
---
What are you talking about? It comes 5th. This ts is 2 weeks and next ts are 3 weeks.
---
Because not only is that a Korean rifle, it would also give her some actual fragging capabilities. DMR's suck, especially the Mk14.
---
Still, let them play against diamonds then, his fault for queing with a higher rank, no reason we should play against him
---
thank you.
---
Too bad I just get domed by my teammate just for spawning 👍
---
Might as well make Blitz a 4 speed and give him a nuke as a weapon
---
We really will never know until it happens again to be honest since the only reason we caught this was some guy noticed that a tweet announcing the new season pass has the same words as the new season after it was revealed 
---
I "main" him too (have the most time with him, around 60 hours) and all I say is, use the emp's effectively. Dont just throw three in the objective hoping to destroy something but try to figure out if they have electronics on specific places. More I really dont know other then stay alive ;) 
---
no problem, idk i was just confused and I feel like it's only right for all the operators to have one. Just a simple short video you know lol.

this will kill ranked lol
---
Fuse needs a buff. His guns are good but his gadget is so situational and requires so much teamwork. Never mind that it will still sometimes kill him.
---
It actually is, smokes are a good repositioning item and Glaz support, while breaching charges are necesarry part of his vertical game.
---
I think the most painful (and other Mira mains can probably confirm) is when someone barricades the wall i leave open for Mira strat...

If you’re into skins, sure. If not, also fine. Depends on you and whether you want to wait to get packs or just treat yourself here and there. Every paycheck I tend to treat myself to something game-related either in RS6 or CSGO

Yeah, idk. I just thought it would be natural or normal to have videos for all of them lol.

Hi Prodigio. I think I can give you a lot to talk about with the following post, that sadly the subreddit has ignored and even downvoted: [Suggestion for Nomad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/awslv9/how_nomad_is_op_and_how_to_fix_it_long_analysis/). 
---
I think you could discuss this suggestion with Epi in a really interesting way. You grasp details very well in your podcasts and you analyze everything to the max. I think you will catch up the essence of my feedback very, very well. That's a conversation I'd like to hear, more than any specific questions

Very true. But it also ticks down their health and cuts off drones. And he has a reinforced wall electrified too. Seems practical. Seen it done in plat plenty of times 
---
Nah duh. You still have enough to time to up to her and melee her shield. People have been abusing resets since this game launched. This is a change to combat though. Yeah clash should punish you if you don't know how deal with her and you're low on health. It's her job. If you can't play around that I don't know what to tell you. She had one of the lowest one and pick Delta's for a reason.

Pretty sure it's just a K1 carbine

I mean I don’t blame you I have the season pass (so I’m not speaking out of butthurts) but I do wish Ubisoft would put more effort into skins like a system were you could have custom skins for Helment, glasses, gloves, shoes, pants, vest, and gadget

It's because he had an ability that can effect everyone on the map without a real direct counter other than maybe mute. That's why he's kinda broken

Let's say, rn you are roaming and and you need to get back into the obj, but all the walls are reenforced, you use the gadget. That's one situation.

The worst of it is when you have shot your whole pistol mag into their head and they still didn't die. Then your only options are to make an attempt to run or just accept your fate and wait for the devastating *beep, beep* *BOOM*.

Yep, I got team killed by a rando upon starting a casual, and then all his friends voted to kick me. You gotta learn to expect this stuff on console, sadly. That's why this game shines when you play with friends.

I thought something was off XD
---
Isn't that what they're doing when defending?
---
Nah she ain’t to bad if ur the type that’s good at rushing
---
That would make it so much more fun instead of sweating plats coming in and recking everyone
---
Do you know if the year 2 ops will be discounted like she year 1 ops were this season?
---
The greater good
---
Got it thanks
---
!RedditBronze
---
Her elite is the best, shut up 
---
This is like when someone noticed the forza horizon 4 devs teased the return of Mitsubishi by spelling it out with the first letter of every tweet. 
---
I’ll check them out thx
---
Cool I’ll try it
---
Good idea
---
maybe not for the 417?
---
look at my boi
---
yeah but with way higher firerate
---
They need to start making separate patches for PC and for console. I used to love ela but like you said, her gun is uncontrollable on a console
---
It is easier to do this on PC because you guys have text chat to communicate. On console, you have to pray the attackers won't kill you as you are Tea-Bagging outside.
---
Well aren’t you a bundle of fun 
---
Because it makes fully automatic weapons op. 
---
Did you clutch it??
---
It looks like pewds background pattern thing 
---
Ofc its a Clash Main idea. 
---
YES ELA WITH A 0% PICK RATE! MY BABY IS COMING BACK! Or not it's probably just because she's the worst roamer in the game which is saying something because Vigil does nothing for the team and only benefits himself with his gadget. Also she's not picked at all for the most part which makes sense since no one seems to know that her shotgun is much better than the Scorpion and everyone just dies with her and quits. probably because everything about her is horrible asides from that shotgun and pistol.
---
F\*ck Theme park. I can't wait until they rework it.
---
I would buy hibana but i got the deluxed edition of the game so i don't need to cause i have them all already lol
---
That is NOT redbubble. Link redirects to tshopzoneDOTcom. Damn scammers
---
perhaps 
---
Finally, a worthy opponent! Out battle will be legendary!
---
Whats with Lion and Cats ?
---
I mean... i get it he is a Lion but... is there something in his lore related to cats or something ?
---
"Frost is fine"
---
Need to NERF Echos blast effect, it pisses me off that a flashbang can go off 5 feet away from you and barely effect you, but a blast of noise literally turns you into Hellen Keller for the rest of the round
---
245k currently 
---
I have a little over 30K right now, Saving up to get the new Seasonal Weapon Skins when Burnt Horizon releases.
---
__Oh yeah I forgot that the only thing that matters about an operator is their gadget.__
---
what is mobility
---
I think he's not bad in ranked bc if you know how his gadget works it becomes a very effective tool but he's still defenetly out of the meta and extremely situational, there're few spots where you can confidently get a kill with the first nade without giving an opponent time to react and run away 
---
Smart 👍
---
Thatcher’s situation (I think)
---
I am at 406K rn trying to go to 1 million before august
---
cosmetics are useless. worry more about balance 
---
Ahh...duh.
---
None of the challenges are ticking for me. Just tried to do the Shotgun T-Hunt kills and even that wouldn't tick.
---
See my other comment. I threw the last 2 out of maybe 20 matches beacuse i was so curious. But at that point I was so low rank it was basically casual. I apologize for my behaviour
---
I think I got about 14K
---
I'm still trying to buy operators though
---
2k
---
They downvoted him, because he told them the truth. 
---
So you want her to be impossible to counter because it requires teamwork to stop her?  Cav isn’t good in higher ranks because she preys on loners and that doesn’t happen with players who actually know how to play
---
I never save up more than 30k. I buy what I want, I have an operator skin for everyone that I generally like. 
---
how many matches did you throw to try to get some internet points 
---
Like if they go Archives on Bank, Fuze from above Vastly OP. But any other obj is almost useless, unless you know the team is going to pick alot of trap operators, then you can fuze an area to destroy them as best as you can
---
Cav, I definitely think her lore is one of the better ones and would be a cool idea :).
---
Happened to me but i got finka'd while cav was looking around for others lol
---
Oh shit that breathing was the bomber?! I thought it was Gridlock sprinting down a hallway, damn my bad. 
---
2
---
ZULUL 
---
When you run out of rifle ammo right when he turns the corner
---
That is literally the most practical operator idea I’ve heard. That would be fun to be on both ends of though. They could also have a time period where you can speak through it and just say stuff to the enemy.
---
That's the point though of it. It's a tactical thing my dude to I encourage smarter rushing rather then straight rushing. And yes any team can rush and win any pro will tell you that any plat or diamond will tell you that heard them say it myself. Its skill and not the strategy itself. The strategy on it's own is no matter what gonna always be considered toxic, the least ubi can do is lower the toxicity around it and give everyone on the game a proper chance to counter it in some way
---
They are about to add the new comers playlist. I'll easily bet the first round of every round of that will be a rush I'm almost tempted to make a smurf account just to prove myself right
---
I used to always shit myself when I would forget about the bomber in Glaz’s situation
---
A better bandit elite than that trash junkie they call an elite. (I know bandit used to be a 'junkie', but still this elite is just...bad.)
---
I’m utterly disgusted at this poor and tasteless representation of riders. What a bigot. Everyone knows a real rider sleeps on their garage crawler under their bike. 
---
Wonder how many airsoft rounds it takes to down someone with it, oh don’t forget to interrogate either 
---
Holy crap
---
Hello ZippoNipples! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
I prefer to believe that OP form 4'd a legit suppressor just for an airsoft gun lol 
---
People act like making Fuze a 2 speed will fix his fundamental problems. Being an incredibly loud operator with a gadget that trained ears will hear while needing to be on the side of a soft wall or barricade is innately dumb. Allow him to deploy his gadget onto a surface from a distance kind of like Ying so that he doesnt need to put himself into the line of fire to cluster charge and I think he would become a lot better.
---
they’ve literally said they’re working on it. calm down 
---
Where the hell did you read that i *want* her to become anything? A shitty op is better than a broken one, be it in PL or pub.
---
Siege on console is a cesspool of toxicity.
---
So i guess there actually IS a reason for the beta tag...
---
because not having it ruins the game and makes it unplayable 
---
Like league levels? 
---
That’s probably your issue. Learn how to communicate. I solo queue half the time and I still don’t get rushed. Idk how you can complain about rushes yet say you don’t get rushed. Like what? That’s like me complaining that Glaz is OP even though he never kills me. And smoke only stops a rush for like 10 seconds. It’s stupid to waste your smoke so early in the round when you can save it and be much more beneficial for the team later in the round. You can just use a roamer or trap operator and pressure them out of a rush 29 times a better early in the round. You don’t need to waste a gadget to stop a rush for 10 seconds. No one plays him like this unless you have an easy kill. Smoke is so easy to counter early in the round. Just go a different route and laugh because he wasted his gadget. 
---
I tend to try to come up with practical ideas for the game rather then off the walls stuff. A lot of it gets hate but ultimately on almost everything I say on reddit is ether something that would actually work or something that could help the game
---
waste of your time and your teammates time 
---
You still need suppressor height sights for an Osprey. You can even see on SilencerCo's page that they have it outfitted to a Glock with raised sights and it still doesn't appear to clear the can.
---
Hot take: all of your idea but it’s just bombers with no non-bomber AI 
---
Thats imposible.
---
Siege is one of the best games I’ve ever played. I have more than 2500 hours of my life wasted on it. Probably gonna have another 1000 hours before I’m done with it. Best $60 I ever spent and now it’s only like $20
---
Is it possible for solo queuing to be less frustrating, I.e: making it so solo queued players are matched with other solo players and not going against stacks? Other games do this and I think it would be worth implementing in Siege.
---
Also a ping system like the one in Apex Legends would be amazing.
---
Alibi needs to change decoy uniform. I feel bad when i bought the pro league skin and it puts me at a disadvantage.
---
Also ela' higher horizontal recoil than vertical can be mitigated to an extent with angled grip. Just my two cents. I go gripless on jager for the same reason.  Just my 2 cents.
---
I get one when I hear that bomb click and I get blinded from his blue light
---
Smh...
---
Cav's gun has zip ties holding the cloth on in-game though. I'm pretty sure they're not even flush cut, just like the ones on OPs gun
---
Flair doesnt check out
---
I really want to get into it, but I only got console, so like do I suffer the toxicity or wait til I get a PC?
---
Ye hate to see it
---
True. Im sorry. Im admittedly selfish and will never throw again
---
Wasn't this graphic already been posted?
---
I think we need to get badger, Anthonypit1, tuxbird, and another 7 big R6 tubers and have them play a few matches with pro league rules
---
Siege take so long to learn i have 500 hours and i still haven’t learned everything, you need as much time as you can get
---
What?!? You’ve been spawnkilled by Alibi with a shotgun. Bruh. Smh. Yeah any character can do a good runout, but if they get instant domed by a prefiring team, they won’t get a kill. It’s so easy to counter. So damn easy. Just because you pick an operator with a DMR that doesn’t mean anything. I don’t need thermal imaging if my bullet hits their head before I even see them. Learn how to prefire boi
