He has the commando and the SMG right

Ubisoft are remaking old ppl skins due to the fact they are money hungry (no momo) and also she still gets another weapon skin, they‚Äôll be re-releasing all the old skins but updated

I rock the roni with a comp, holo and a foregrip with the secondary shotgun and a nitro.

I'll try it out. Thanks

I'll try that too. Thanks

Her guns are pretty good too tbh

I like the commando personally, more of a straight roamer than you but with him I‚Äôve started camping early game quite a bit too

Thanks

Yeah man. Reload animation is sick af too
---
It‚Äôs actually a sound clip from one of the NPC‚Äôs from the PvE event Breakout. Some reason it still bug it‚Äôs way into the game from time to time.

Yeah, her AR feels really good and she has probably one of the better LMGs.

I do try my best to ignore them. But it doesn't mean it doesn't annoy any less.

True. But it may just be me, i would rather trade a bit of realism if it meant i could actually play a game instead of running into TK‚Äôing jerks.

Stop calling me I'm fucking depressed

Pretty much all of these are bad ideas. I would kinda be against it. No offense.

whenever she's down, you hold 'x' to get back up. You only get 1 hp though

This is why my teabagging sprees stay inside the objective room, and only happen if the other guy isn‚Äôt Doc or Zofia. I‚Äôm not above mashing C and spinning around like a doofus, but ya gotta have a small amount of planning.

Because your Acog is gone?

What I would do is screen record on PS and then put that recording on a thumb drive then transfer the recording from the thumb drive to your PC.

Just failed a 1v4 clutch because of this glitch, some dude was being revived outside and shot them but the fucking tree blocked the bullets.

its only a side ability, but overall she's a pretty good op

OMG.... This is just... awesome and hilarious at the same time!

nvidia's geforce experience stuff
---
Hi

Im listening

?

Her side ability is so OP though!

What was that maverick doing? Honestly?
---
It's been called out tho
---
It IS being fixed with the forgive system that's on tts rn

That 5% useful has often gone up to 20-25% off late.

No, Mirage is hilarious, I don‚Äôt know what you guys are on about.

If you ever, come at me, with that **bullshit** again. I will personally see to it that Tom Clancy inverts your asshole inside out

What level are You? (I'm 111)
---
Ehh it can be, ive only managed to actually use it once (Cavi down me from a distance and i got back up just in time to knife her) otherwise i forget to use it or i get killed trying
---
What
---
XD do it
---
I‚Äôm level 104
---
And hasn't been adequately addressed. You could scroll on by and not bother commenting. 
---
Can‚Äôt You just turn it off in the settings?
---
Why didnt you just upload the game clip 
---
I'd prefer that over standard on literally any gadget.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to 1-up you, but one time I got a 2-3 victory and came out with a 2 percent alpha pack. It had that crappy bird of prey Blackbeard legendary.
---
Gridlock's trak stingers are really just spiky dragon dildos
---
It turns it off for every gadget though, even ones you presumably want it for like Breaching Charges and Claymores.
---
Think about it, if your taking 5 to 6 shots to kill someone your either really far away and shooting through walls, or using a machine pistol, most assault rifles only take 3 shots to the body to kill, if your only hitting body shots then a slight horizontal recoil on your 4th or 5th shot shouldn't make you miss. And maybe I'm just a scrub but when I'm aiming where someone that's crouching head should be and they come into view and they're standing, I use the consistent vertical recoil to try to get the headshot.
---
Appropriate slow Mo if you ask me. It's unfortunate really. I have no idea why the shields seem to 100% fail to work sometimes.
---
It would have worked better put over a clip of the volatiles from dying light
---
Still great either way lmao
---
Shield killcams be broken this season

I just had a match with 200 ping, not sure what's going on.

Bronze is normally smurfs and bronze is normally solo queuers who got really unlucky... I would know. Never been in copper though

Just today I loaded into a ranked game and there were only three people on my team. I didn‚Äôt even see anyone leave I just loaded in with two other people.  After that one of the other guys was kicked for high ping and didn‚Äôt even bother rejoining, leaving me and my random teammate in a 2 vs 5. Needless to say we then lost 4-0. It‚Äôs ridiculous that either two people would leave before I even got in the game or for some reason our game wasn‚Äôt filled with enough people.
---
Yeet.
---
Plat 3 here, this is accurate.
---
New cheese spot?
---
15 to 25 is like 4 or 5 games. You don't get rolls on losses.
---
thats actually the coolest thing ive seen
---
 
---
It‚Äôs been done already but that‚Äôs still funny af
---
Just a heads-up, the first alpha pack you get is guaranteed to be an epic or higher.
---
That is a horrible Hibana &amp; Thermite easy to get around the trick but no communication on there side making it a good and easy job good for you.
---
Good clip but you should spend some time messing with your sensitivity to get it exactly how you like ie. Lower or raise ads sens
---
maybe make a meme about leavers and the devs will reply. All these people do is care about lining their own pockets. IF you have legitimate concerns over the state of anything its either no response at all or a generic (and basically fuck off) "sent it to the team". Oh but make a joke and they will respond Fuck these devs, I hope they get fired like activation and EA have been doing recently. 
---
Lmao no it isn‚Äôt that is like 20+ loses to get that far and there is no way someone can get that many in a row. 
---
i have jager black ice on pc and ps4 but good 4 u my friend has 2 black ice and hes envious of you.

Close enough... nom

Change everything to smurf.

No guarantee - usually the bandit will have one wire down on half the wall to prevent it. But if you have a thatcher it's pretty trivial to do it.

[The alternative "ACOG" I have for Jager.](https://imgur.com/1tNYIZ8) Had to do it.
---
imagine gold. Thats all I can say. recoil literally does not exist down there. Honestly, this entire games ranked system is a joke unless you are top percentile. 
---
"I'm not going to listen to you because I don't like it"

Solid argument

---
Rng like I always do
---
I absolutely despise that it doesn't take points/performance into consideration. Rank up the support players and top fraggers who actually do work and leave behind the shitters who can't get kills or support their their team. I'd take a good Mira who can't aim for shit over a mediocre Jager any day of the week. Leave the shitters behind in bronze and let the team players and good fraggers move up
---
I 'FINK' shes great 
---
The alpha packs are one of the best addition ever added to the game ,cheers to developer team,the best decision by ubisoft was to make them not included as a microtransaction, but seeing the current state of them i think they are not in a good place, they feel like very less rewarding ,more and more commons and duplicates ruin the immertion and fun of having a good collection, since the items are exclusive to alpha packs (you cannot buy them in the shop) should be dupelicate protected and thus it will make alpha packs more worth and more rewarding,also if you see the ration of someone getting a legendary or an epic is so much less ,i hope devs notice this . See you in game ;)
---
This new season feel like health 2.0
---
Everybody gangsta til the candela goes to level 3
---
I just wanna win games. I'm always pretty much the best or second best on my team and if I get clowned we are guaranteed to lose the round.
---
Looks amazing, whys it sitting on the barrel of a gun though? Just curious.
---
I dont known some are already downvotting ,i mean who wouldnt want this??
---
It‚Äôs the candela lol she prob held down the timer however there used to be a glitch only one person heard and I had it twice in a full squad(they thought I was crzy). In this glitch that sound was intensified louder and appeared to be coming from the ceiling. And it was infinite but it was only in one location
---
of course a dokkaebi main would say that
---
What do mean? I‚Äôm not talking about cod. Look at other games like overwatch for example where your outline gets cooler and cooler the higher level you are. In that game you look at a super high level and go, ‚ÄúWow look at that guy‚Äôs golden outline. Dang that guy must be really good. I respect him.‚Äù In rainbow it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúOh look it‚Äôs a lvl 200. Wait is he plat? No he isn‚Äôt he‚Äôs trash.‚Äù
---
I've been using jackal as a main for a while now and I have to say he is a good choice. Jackal not only has an extremely helpful gadget but he also has some of the best guns in game. 
---
Man you really need to get some pussy or some friends chill homie chill. 
---
All the terrorist hunt
---
she's the hottest one
---
Sledge is pretty much the character that portrays the game
---
Yuuup. That‚Äôs goobisoft, best you can do is just keep playing the game and just hold angles. P.S. what do you play on????
---
I play on ps4.
---
Noice same here:)
---
I main Montaigne, great for bomb and it‚Äôs always useful too. But it‚Äôs easier to play with him I‚Äôm a square vs solo queue
---
.What rank is this?
---
Horizontal and vertical: 6
---
ADS: 45%
---
DPI: 400
---
FOV: 90
---
What about you, OP?
---
The original 20 should be prominent but if you had to choose one to build around:
---
Recruit.
---
Idk but all I see is goga
---
They know they got whacked. Sucks to miss out on the double interrogation but making people leave is just part of cooking it up with Cav. 
---
And give her SMG Holographic. Please.
---
Oh damn I never knew that. I haven't unlocked her yet so maybe that's why. That's a brilliant ability. 
---
And where is any kind of proof that this is correct other than someone's opinion? You can literally go in game and try the different barrel attachments and see that the compensator is the best at reducing horizontal recoil, which as I explained before, is the only recoil that is not manageable by simply learning how to pull your mouse down
---
People are literally just talking out their asses based on the incorrect description of muzzle devices in game and not actually using them to see what they do
---
How did you get caveria main next to your name, I am a cav main with 70 hours on but idk how to get that badge next to my name... I‚Äôm new to reddit lol

---
I plan on doing Buck's emblem next
---
I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening wrong here?üòÇ
---
My hands were shaking after this.
---
Most of the old ops are super straight forward so they could fully explain them in a sentence or two, but as they get more complex it seems like Ubi can't figure out how to concisely explain them. 
---
Finka has so many unexplained interactions it's unreal.

this happens all the time, considering Ubi hasn't told us all of the words you cannot use. Just ride the wave for a couple of days or up to a week, that's the longest it has ever been for my friends or me. Don't sweat it too much, it'll go away soon, and try to be more careful about derogatory slurs for race or sexuality (you also cannot say whore or retarded, as I have learned the hard way in custom match 3v3s)

Nah, the balance is that Russian guns are worse, but the sights are better, and other ops sights are worse, but have better guns. If you mess with that equation, then the whole balance doesnt work

Yeah, because things like a twitch drone can follow you and steal your kills

That's generalizing honestly, I've seen Gold 3 players with great aim which I would say would definitely fit your description, and then I've seen Gold 3 players where that rank is way, way too high for them considering both their aim and how they play.

Literally everybody can see it...

I'm not allowed to answer that question. It's the name of the sub. But since you asked, it's 7. I'll just leave out the units.

Eh, as someone who can consistently hit Platinum 2-1 on PC (And often can't be bothered to reach Diamond just because I don't have a five stack team): If you are going to take this seriously and not as the meme that it basically is, remember that all of us differ even if we seem to have the same rank.
---
What I mean is is that i've definitely seen Gold and even Silver players that would definitely deserve more than their current ranks, and others where that rank was way, way too high considering both their aim and expecially how they play during a match.

Because spread shotguns in Rainbow are very inconsistent. Especially on attack. But that could just be a whacky console thing. Also, this a personal preference, but just nailing someone with a slug bean bag (weird combo of words there) seems really satisfying

lmao perfect

At the start of the season I was like Silver 4, then I got down to Copper 4 and now I'm slowly climbing back up in Bronze 4.
---
lmao, I once played against a Glaz that saw the hostage and UNLOADED into him. A hilarious round win
---
Bro mine was the lords smg beat that
---
And thats the definition of SOLO-QUEUE my friend...
---
is it an airsoft variant or just a decoy?
---
I played against this guy a few weeks ago in casual. After killing himin the first two rounds I lost connection to ubi. Coincidence. I think not.
---
I get the oposite, i dont pick recruit and i get an op
---
i reached gold 3
---
went down to copper 4
---
Airsoft, A VFC HK416C Gas Blowback Rifle
---
We need this fanction lol
---
Sounds like a virus
---
Ik, After a specific update, we now get ops, no longer recruit. This is a joke for a long time ago. If this is what you ment
---
I thought memes were not allowed here. 
---
The sheer versatility is everything. It's a handy gun for sure, especially on Sledge imo. But the fact that it can be used across all 4 SAS is nice for a first Black Ice
---
And stop getting duplicates and just be able to keep multiple of the same skin
---
Looks like a nice charm for the breachers.
---
Call Mute and get him to pick up his jammer near you

Oh absolutely, and it‚Äôs such a powerful and satisfying weapon to use even at quite surprising ranges

Yeah.

Yup. Lost a game once because of this.

gave him the xbox yoink

Thanks for the credit!

I got plat 3 on my first season. He could very well just be good at the game

HMU and we might be able to figure something out :)

That's quite rare for r6s players, seeing my teammates.

Kronovi... That u?

Your about the fuck them laser sights. 
---
Magic Voxel
---
Yeah but like how does it work scientifically? 
---
He's not American, he's a texan. Two different things. 
---
I think it works via echolocation, hence the deep sound and vibration.
---
Wrong comment?
---
Does this mean he can build me a mini ads if I become his friend. I need a mini ads. So happens I also need a friend. 
---
Hello joodit_plavner! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!
---
Should you still have any unanswered question, [let the moderation team know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRainbow6 "Click here to compose a modmail message") so they can improve the guide for future buyers.
---
Thanks bro 
---
Well, I take it he's playing on PC? If not, he won't be able to go pro (there's no console pro league anymore)
---
In terms of finding a competitive team, he just needs to get active on the ESL website and check for teams who successfully play Com Cups and trial there. He won't be able to play any major tournaments until he is 18yo though.
---
Mayve he'll even find a CL team that's willing to pick him up and keep him as a stand in for scrims and stuff. (This is VERY unlikely though)
---
One last remark, just because he is good as a ranked player he's not automatically good as a comp player. I've kicked or turned down several players from my current and past teams, because they just couldn't adapt to playing as a team.
---
Anyways, does your brother stream/make videos? Id like to see how good he is :)
---
No one, just buy weapon skins instead
---
I wouldnt confuse constant ringing for music
---
My personal favorite at the moment is mozzie. Mainly for his guns. Gadget is smart too if you can pull it off to get the drones.
---
Note. This is a personal opinion. 
---
Never too late 
---
One of the 2 operators that can make a big fucking hole on fortified walls
---
I think you need to reconsider your definition of p2w a bit tho, to be p2w your paid operator would need to give you a good advantage over a non paid one, suggesting that operators are available in renown and others aren't, wich isn't the case. You're referencing a pay to accelerate scheme, or freemium if you want to call it that way
---
The force is strong in this wall
---
so cool but your friend has so much time on there hands looool 
---
Hahaha I feel you!
---
Wait why dont you have all the original operators? Because I got them all for free.
---
Just aim better xD 
---
Yeah, they are the first operators u *must* buy
---
Zofia
---
Happy Microphone day

Well I think he is trying to make it into somewhat of a business while he studies
---
Thermite would be my vote.

I love this, the faces are so simply but there is sooo much emotion!

FOOKING LASER SIGHTS

---
Fair play aha lets see more in excited to see what he can do can I suggest mute jammer :))))))) totally impartial 
---
r/oddlysatisfying
---
Finally a good answer. Its still p2w no matter how small the advantage though imo
---
I've found the best cure for those things is to stop playing the game.
---
Simple solution tbh, can only play with ranks adjacent to your rank and you‚Äôll be matched corresponding to the highest rank in your party. This would also make solo queuing a lot better.
---
My friends kick me before the game even starts
---
You think that shit is funny? We are at war and nothing about it is funny soldier 
---
Please please make this happen
---
its mutes doing
---
Don't bully eachother :(
---
I'm a mid gold player, but just match with normal people that plays for fun, or at least the Most of the times. ^^
---
I would give you a crisp high five if I could 
---
But islets much easier in siege. I main sledge and normally will compete with people that play the added operators. The main ops that are game changers are defensive but you can still easily get around them with most of the original operators.
---
Same here. Won 5/10 placement matches, got Gold 4. Then reached Gold 2 and after that a rediculous loose streak dropped me to Bronze 4. 
---
You will rarely find situations in r6 where you're facing more than one player at a time. So yea to an extent you're right, but you still have a possble disadvantage if you can't choose the same operator as your opponent
---
Traitors!
---
Lesion will always be bae, no matter how much they try to nerf him.
---
yea, u?
---
I deranked like 4 ranks yesterday from just incredibly bad luck with trolls/bots/derankers
---
I will get them back without much issue, but jesus christ soloQ in this game sometimes is just... bad...
---
hey alexa
---
You clearly is just getting personal and toxic because you take my statement as an insult to r6 and you lol
---
That's the point. There are disadvantages. 
---
Jager, Thermite or Doc
---
I am not sure if you mean selling them back to the game for renown or being able to trade them, but both options are a terrible idea. 
---
Do understand, i can totally get your frustration, my Alpha packs are amazingly terrible, my last non common or uncommon skins were 2 purple duplicates and a blue duplicate out of 20 packs or such. 
---
So let‚Äòs imagine the not so terrible and debatable version that you can sell your skins back to the game. Now what would happen? 
---
Everyone would sell their common and uncommon skins ASAP, buy a hughe bunch of Alpha packs to get them Black Ice or Legendaries.
---
Opening a pack would lose it‚Äòs value and thrill. Now that doesn‚Äòt seem to bad, does it? But you miss something big:
---
You would be able to buy Alpha packs for real world money.
---
One could potentially buy R6 Credits, go to the shop, search for the best value to rare skins pack, resell all those and buy Alpha packs with the won renown. 
---
It would be a big problem and even if you get around that buy locking items which are bought with Credits, it is still difficult to due and prone to glitches. 
---
You don't understand pay to win, change my mind.
---
Says the filthy recruit

We'll see I guess

Same goes for heroes in bf2 which was raped in the game community. Its not fair that you can't buy skins and other cosmetics because you want to get to the same level as a payer.
---
I still dont get why would people get excited because of a girl gamer is in their game, Im usually like "oh a girl? cool"
---
idk i've heard the game got better with the new content but i stopped playing when i learned they lock content that was available on launch behind a the dlc and also that you really had to buy those expensive dlc to have a good experience. I dont think the game itself is a failure but the business model isnt healthy imo and i chose to not invest anymore into it. I like cayde because he stood out the most in the game lel
---
me too , but the flash from the weapon firing is annoying , might change again to the flash hider.
---
Bro I gotta prep all day for a game of ranked 
---
Out of the way, Ant-Man
---
Fooken lazeh soights
---
&gt; Simple solution tbh
---
Would be a shitty solution though as it would stop people playing with their friends. Though letting anyone queue with anyone and then matching based around the top mmr also has its problems.
---
I was in game when I realised this, just had to share it üòÖ
---
Were you recording the entire thing or after the fact it happened 
---
Just give some good call outs and try to give your team good information and they will start to follow suit. 
---
And what software do you use
---
PEngu was the first person to hit 1000 hours, and that was before he was pro league
---
*i dont wanna play with you anymore*
---
Honestly if you consider the game a team game, then advantages coming from newer operators impact the game almost negligibly. However, if you're comparing operators directly to one another I can see how you see p2w style advantages. At the same time, Doc can literally heal himself back up once over, or a teammate, giving whoever a statistical advantage. Whereas Vigil makes only himself invisible to drones, for only a limited time, while still giving his position away while doing so. Do I think Doc is better than Vigil? No. however if you compare just the stats of their abilities directly to each other, imo it appears Doc reigns supreme, even though Vigil IS a dlc operator. HOWEVER, Comparing buck and Sledge, just their abilities, Buck seems like the better pick with him almost being an upgraded sledge, Unless you look deeper and realize that sledge can also take out bulletproof barricades and gadgets. I suppose to each their own, however personally I do not see an overwhelming argument for siege being p2w.
---
TL:DR Base ops can certainly be better than DLC ops. Siege is a team game, relying on the operators of your teammates to coincide with yours. I don't believe siege is p2w.
---
Anything but the blur would be better. Maybe even something more stylized like a slide.
---
Probably just lucky because when you play in high levels happens
---
After it happened. Xbox one can record five minutes back.
---
Probably, and I haven‚Äôt read up on/checked yet but you probably got a renown refund
---
Zofia: "I'm about to ruin this man's whole life"
---
I am level 136 I think and I have been hitting diamond every season with an overall of 1.5 KD. Trust me.... if you are very good at FPS, you can easily join E league before 500 hours game time.
---
Like allot bruh... Most i see that are Plat or Diamond ate atleast lvl 250 wich takes a good amount of time. 
---
You gotta get good aim and recoil controll wich does not need to take forever, map knowledge, strats and learning OP's does for sure tough. 
---
I got 420 hours in, my lvl is 137, KD is 1.1 and Rank is Silver 2 - Gold 3, going up and down allot. I first started actually doing good after 300 hours i would say. 
---
Also depends if you have played allot of FPS before.
---
I would say you should expect to be atleast lvl 250 ( prop atleast 1000 hours, since after lvl 200 leveling up takes allot of time ) before you are very good at all parts of the game. Some players are kinda dumb and all but get by with extremly good aim like Beaulo. 
---
I have played 4 seasons, 2 first seasons i was Bronze, third season i was mostly Silver and a bit Gold and Bronze and now this season i have been mostly Gold.
---
Take your time, watch youtube videos and just try your best i guess. Even at Diamond and lvl 300 players like Beaulo and Pengu will prop still destroy you.
---
Looks very nice! I made one myself half a year ago, yours turned out much better though! 
---
Hahaha i have been maining him for a while
---
typical console copper xD
---
He doesn't, but at least it's a little nicer to hold angles with Sledges gun than with Bucks. 
---
Happens randomly
---
Should have written this in table for long barrel: "it's useless, don't use it."
---
Can I see it? All credits goes to my friend through u/TA5TY 
---
Because he fire
---
No no no not for smurfing, but for the cheating thing
---
Shut up and take my karka
---
Cause he‚Äôs a smooth operator 
---
Dude chill, it's not everyday that a teams throws a 5v1 hella hard. &amp; if you see this everyday, tell your team to stop running out.
---
man that mic...
---
Well it downs you, so if you get revived you are back up to 20 hp, so they technically do 80 damage

Hello A77Fordo, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b6iw2z/bug_with_air_jabs_in_kafe_and_probably_other_maps/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

It‚Äôs one of the settings, called ‚ÄúEnable custom team names‚Äù or something. The host writes the team names.

Most of the guys in the pro league are like 14-17 so if you get 20 you should be the best

You main clash, what you level

Cool story buddy
---
Now you understand the stupid power of blitz
---
I get stuck at the top of plat 2 every season any tips for pushing to plat and diamond also what‚Äôs your gamertag 
---
I also wanted to main vigil but I think his gadget is just too useless now, like yeah he‚Äôs getting a buff that lets him counter lion but literally no one plays lion
---
Hahahaha
---
Bro, how do you make one of those? I so want to make one for my friend too. 
---
Doesn't every new player get a free epic alpha pack??
---
Not necessarily me and my friends for the past 5 seasons have been placed low gold but then drop all the way to copper IV because we have throwing teammates and most of them aren't even that good, we don't try to throw or try to derank at all we just try to get them back
---
You can see it on the screen right there! I used to main Echo but my love for annoying people with the shield has overcome the power of the Yokai since then. Just for proof -- https://r6tab.com/e27bfc79-6a5c-43db-a82c-1f5eee24f723/operators
---
If you get shot in the head you probably would die who the fuck though up this idea
---
playing in a 5 stack helps if you don‚Äôt already. And I also play secure area because at this point in the game I don‚Äôt care people call me a ‚Äúsecure star‚Äù, I just hate playing against MnK teams in bomb, it makes me hate the game
---
Getting diamond in secure is easier than bomb because of the simple fact that bomb has more keyboarders 
---
I‚Äôd say the difference between plat 2 players and diamond is consistency, plat 2 and diamonds can peak at the same level of skill, but plats have more shitty games followed by good games, I‚Äôd say just try and get consistent with your aim somehow weather that be lowering sensitivity (I play 30-30 40 ads) and something else 
---
My gt is cheesepie37
---
Impossible to be sure. It definitely happens by accident, but that seemed extra questionable.
---
Dibs

I'm pretty sure it's just -15% damage. It's just more noticeable at long range with damage fall off

---
Wrong comment.
---
Ask my friend r/TA5TY he is the one that made it! He also commented about it somewhere on this thread
---
Maybe even add some gold fingernails Ubi? Just a thought üíÖüèæ
---
That's extremely satisfying
---
make that 6
---
I thought all the y1 ops were 15k renown 
---
Are Silver and Gold players trash?
---
It's the previous persons comment. He just formatted it to look like that
---
yeah  i guess so. idk i had problems with dumb teammates even in to GM, people who will just run in alone sometimes or not pay attention to whats going on. low gm is still really bad imo when you look at how the game is 'meant' to be played, unfortunately 
---
surprisingly in siege i've never been 'rage TKed' but i only play ranked so that could be it
---
This is the only map other than Kafe at the moment that I don‚Äôt want on the Ranked playlist. At least Kafe is getting reworked next season. 
---
That's genius
---
*Platinum players have left the chat*
---
Yeah i try to not bother from them too, but grinding like mad hours in and get a alpha pack and hoping for to get your fav headgear but good chances are you still get a dupe. 
---
Fuck you don‚Äôt ever try and take my acog. I use it for holding angles which is why defenders have then in the first place, I don‚Äôt roam I don‚Äôt spawnpeek. There is a reason only 3 armor defenders have acog

I really hope this is satire

Its all based on luck, if the game wants you will get dupelicate for the rest of your life and its also a problem for those too who dont have time to play this game all day long.

I never said that this didn't look good, I'm saying that this is nowhere near the level of quality of the official cinematics lol
---
You probably rush with ash or blitz
---
I wasn‚Äôt supporting but it‚Äôs not a big enough deal to make it an issue 
---
If you use your secondary shotgun to shoot out where the mirror will be it will take care of that, but also give you a little better field of view 
---
why??
---
amazing
---
It really do be like that
---
nice stuff, you friend should sale them too.
---
Stop trying to save face and just admit that you're incorrect. It's not that hard, OK? 
---
Did he jus paint an alexa?
---
*emp blast*
---
How is this an insult? Lol
---
I‚Äôm upvoting this for the great clip + you‚Äôre Saudi and I support my people.
---
He turned on Rainbow and went rogue when they took his ACOG
---
Because it‚Äôs fucking toxic and annoying, more of the ash tho. I understand that‚Äôs probably what they intended for blitz
---
I think he wants to, he told me someone from this thread allready ordered something from him, so if you want something from him, just reach out u/TA5TY that is his username
---
Needs more hats 
---
It‚Äôs not toxic rushing is a strategy that people use
---
QUICKSCOPEEDDDDDD
---
The ump, cav's gun and alibi's gun all benefit greatly from the extended barrel.
---
Man people really still out here not realising you can just run at clash and she's useless eh
---
A bullet to the head is what all shield ops deserve tbh.
---
An Unexpected ending, but a welcome one.
---
Its partially fault of shotgun itslef. They are debatably shit at cqc. At mid cqc they are good, but if enemy is touching your barrel its really easy to miss.
---
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs toxic
---
Thank's for the suggestions guys! I decided to pick Echo for now and I will save up for Lesion afterwards. Time to grind some T-Hunt.
---
This was made in conjunction with the most recent set of recoil changes.
---
&gt;going by the in-game recoil graphs...
---
never use these they are broken / wrong. 
---
gold 1s who don‚Äôt have the game sense for plat, but do have the keyboard, operators and mechanics to abuse to push for plat are worse 
---
What this guy said 
---
Ash mains b like 
---
Yea I‚Äôve finally stayed pretty steady in high hold and it‚Äôs making me take a break from the game 
---
I'd disagree. This has more passion put into it.
---
Dude this is a masterpiece.
---
Thats Sick
---
Thank god. Now those fake plats who rush in with Ash and just spam teabag get their due justice.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much ying tho
---
Damn.
---
Got bored of waiting for glaz to come into objective so my teammate and I had a Mexican stand off with our explosives right before round end. Just being silly

is the diamond like this &lt; &gt; or like this ()

Will try this
---
I think obese is better 
---
Thatcher's EMP grenades turn off the lights and it does fuck all 
---
If ur talking about gridlock, there is no way that a special ops soldier who went through tons of physical training would look as overweight and unhealthy as she does. Ubisoft was trying to make a political statement and r6 is not the place 
---
This is great! Glad to see two of my favorite games mixed together! Did you use SFM to make this?
---
Why is this happening at all? Season health 2 soon?
---
I have a couple of times lol it works well when you have a caviera trying to use your being down as bait and she isn't paying attention. But not much other than that. Its a lot of things that have to happen while you're trying to get up in order for it to work. Lol

Thanks. Corrected.

Oh I don't intend to change the current sound. I intend to add a Nitro cell like, nitro cell volume beeping **only when an enemy operator enters the 500mm radius**. The current explosion sound volume remains unchanged.

I like to use it on Sledges L85, I make tons of holes on the roof and shoot from random ones. Unless the enemies have insanely good comms, they don't know where I am.
---
Not sure, but maybe is a new issue with the alt+tab
---
Its in its 4th year, this is what I meant
---
What was that melee
---
Are you the same guy that said they‚Äôre all going to silver when drop shotting gets nerfed 
---
Good droning is fair play. As annoying as it be when you on the receiving end constant drones and ops pushing you, that's just part of high level good team play. 
---
But the toxic, Ash-Lion-Blitz-Finka with either Jackal or normally Dokkaebi is just pure abuse. It turns the game into a run and gun, no brain all aim CoD-esc shit show and Seige is not meant to be that. It's meant to be a slow-ish methodically strategy tactical shooter. Kids, and it is literally kids, who run that toxic line up are literally cancerous tumours. 
---
Well guess I‚Äôll go kms

So no ones talking about the 400+ Alpha packs and the 1.8million renown..

Because rule 34? Thought this was obvious lol

I also used it once when someone (I think Jager) downed me, I then got up and shot him as he tried to push me.
---
No it's because I want a game like that to happen, people have different opinions
---
I am shocked he lived.  Each of them had plenty of opportunities to kill him but where just bumbling around and didn't notice.  An Ash would have done the same thing but faster.  
---
shoulda called out diffuser down

Right, knowing damn well he's trying to flex lol

Just switch aspect ratio to something and back, will fix it.

Am I the only one who thought of the avengers theme?
---
Nice dude

---
Im complaining about the fact that this game is in its fourth year and that they deployed a patch for AMD that is supposed to fix this, but nothing for nVidia yet.
---
The developers gave Rough-9 this information so it is definitely correct. 
---
really?
---
will try that. thanks
---
Well technically, the game is pay to win during the first week of each season. This is because season pass holders (season pass costs money) get the new operators a week earlier than anyone else.
---
Oi, I‚Äôm OP
---
Imagine if there was a tf2 spy in siege. The amount of team kills (accidental or otherwise) would increase exponentially 
---
Thank you! A few years back I tried with 3Ds max but when I tried converting csgo characters back to sfm and import my animations the bones and models get all fucked up.
---
The only thing I got working fine was using kinect but can only get so far using that.
---
Really appreciate your video tho and great job! Seeing it really motivated me to give it a go again. I always appreciate seeing sfm shorts that goes for realism/seriousness and not straight up cartoony comedy! 
---
Etsy is great for handmade knick knacks! If only someone made a twitch drone.

---
The only thing I found weird about the second clip is that he takes his aim off of the door for no reason and (if he is indeed cheating) thinks about pre aiming the guy through the walls. If he isnt cheating hes just weird.
---
Can't really argue with realism in a game like Siege.
---
That's really cool, I was wondering about that. I've seen people set up budget motion capture stages using an Xbox Kinect, have you ever looked into this? I don't know how good it is.
---
Finka got one tapped holy shit üòÇ
---
Accurate
---
I've found suppressor on Glaz is really nice on occasion because it sometimes takes that extra second to figure out where you got shot from and leads to an easier follow up. Mostly when I'm shooting long range.
---
They will not be useless at one side you can buy any item you want and on the same side you get rewards for winning but its reasonable because you will not care about dupes because everything is in the store already

To be fair. That clip just has a dumbass enemy.

I‚Äôd say a better example is PL. Where I‚Äôve seen it happen 2/3 times. One of those times entirely saving the round (can‚Äôt remember the exact match, might‚Äôve been Empire, and it was for sure on coastline‚Äôs hookah/billiards site)
---
to be fair, I play ranked more because I would rather have a smaller map pool than casual's shitshow, even if it's only like 6 maps difference. Ranked also just gives you more control so you get to choose where to defend and what to bring. It's generally preferable, even if you don't want to try your hardest.

Still doesn't address the elephant in the room, another R4-C skin.

It's still not p2w, because you don't have an advantage over your opponent. If it was, that would be like "if you buy the season pass, all y4 operators will have 125hp and +10 damage".

Exactly, I think it would definitely help the newer players that just want to play and don't care about skins.

---
It's not that they have to be supermodels. It's more about fixing a bad/broken model.
---
Valkyrie's face wasn't even human, so that was a needed fix.
---
Hibana didn't have a neck. That was a needed fix.
---
As for the other OP's that get reworks when they get an elite set. It just makes sense. The characters with elites are usually 2-3 years old and the models are dated by then. It just makes sense that Ubi goes back and remakes them with newer technology and resources.

Had to actually go and do some research where Latvia even was. Apparently its a Scandinavian country. But sadly, I think the chances of them appearing in siege in the next few years are VERY low. I wouldn't say it isnt possible though. Just highly unlikely.

No, you will permanently have 9 r6 credits in your account

That‚Äôs why I peak that with Blackbeard

Thank you!

I used to have "Lights Out" for my flair until I accidentally changed it while looking through the available flairs on mobile. I'm still mad about it
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree with this. It‚Äôs fucking annoying to play against a team that uses this strategy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say that this isn‚Äôt how the game is meant to be played. Ubisoft made operators that are at their best when played a certain way, and it‚Äôs up to the players to decide how the operators will work together in the game. Blitz and ash are designed to rush, and the utilities of the other operators you listed helps them do that. It‚Äôs an annoying strategy, but if it helps win the match without exploiting unintended mechanics of the game, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fair.
---
But that‚Äôs just, like, my opinion broski 
---
Really let the salt drip on em. 
---
Add a mute and bandit or kaid and echo . Stops the rush. Mozzie  is good to f with their drones as well. 
---
Obviously it was the guy above typing it after a lot of spaces 
---
i knew it
---

That‚Äôs insulting! Just because I‚Äôm not the prettiest doesn‚Äôt mean you can just call me a goat

Yeah. So you can get shot and killed, but you can't shoot back.

Did he win?

Yeah last time I asked for help I got told fuck off lol

Doubt. Ubisoft has a bad habit of breaking things while trying to fix things and are way too slow to fix things. I love Siege, but they just take too long and break stuff too often. 
---
My only "criticism" [more of a pointer] maybe work on mouth movements and running animation a bit more, this is a wonder animation and I got to give you props on the ragdolls here. I hope you someday remaster this.

Some wisdom from my experience that may help you -
---
I usually tend to take notice of where people spawn in the early rounds or what doors &amp; entries they push to get into the buildings, then the next round they dont know whats gonna hit them or I get them with a spawn peak, so maybe if you know they know where you're spawning, change it up...also I tend to just wait 5-10 seconds anyways after the round has started, because any good player will be expecting you to be there or running out of the spawn in that time frame, anything after they usually move on. Hope you that helps a little.
---
P.S. House and Plane are notorious for their awful spawns and spawn kills. Just the way it is and happens to us all don't beat yourself up and only try improve.

I don't think shields should melee 1 hit considering how OP they are, i think it should be a 2 hit melee kill with a shield, or 50 damage per hit.

I‚Äôm not, bet. I don‚Äôt find any operator fun enough to play for an unnecessary amount of time, Edgar Allen Toe

TF2 is for shitty mics and shitty custom games and maps.

Yeah, it was done in SFM.

I've extracted animations from Black Ops using Greyhound, ran them through Blender, then wrote a shipload of lines of QC to compile it and then through a very painful process I've transferred them onto Siege models. Painful and a very time consuming process, but at least it paid off.

Lean spam was fixed already.
---
I think blitz and montage shouldn‚Äôt be about to melee with their Shields but the Recruit Shields and fuze should be able too but it‚Äôs not a one hit melee like each hit does 50hp or something 
---
the only reason its good is the red dot its got below average stats its like clash's p10-c its a statistically terrible pistol but it has a red dot

Oh my god, it looks beautiful

Blitz simply shouldn't exist, just like lion, bb, or finka, they just don't work with the game mechanically, they break it.

Yea sound good. Try Monty and rook

I was under the assumption they buffed the hit points to the mat so we couldn't do that anymore. I might be mistaken.

It's also why I stopped playing the game.

While I won't sit all the way at spawn, I will drone if someone asks me to. Not getting your drone shot is a game in itself, bonus satisfaction points if the guy you're droning in knows the map well and can wallbang someone when you tell them where they are.
---
Okay, so joking

Exactly, the red dot make it so much easier to get kills with. Most pistols I only use as a last resort, and I can count on the RG15 for easy headshots when I need them.

Why not just play casual? People rarely, if ever, coordinate like this outside of ranked in my experience. The most coordination I normally see is a thatcher + thermite/hibana combo. It‚Äôs also just less sweaty in general, which is why I never play ranked

If they are boosted by good players thats not too big of a problem. Until they put in a rank lock that prevents high levels boosting low levels then you just have to deal with it. If thats what you are talking about.

I feel like despite all the nerfs Ela has been through, she's in a very good spot now. She doesn't feel outrageously powerful or weak anymore.

Honestly, its iffy. Do you know most callouts on most maps? Do you have friends to play with? Are you willing to deal with teammates judging your skill? I ask the last one bc some people take ranked a bit too seriously and can get pretty toxic if you have a bad game

I want a trade option so I can get rid of my twitch chibi/F2 black ice.

I know some twitch mains that would be very happy to have that.

Ranked is best with a team..2 man at least...that be said it‚Äôs more competitive and less forgiving when you mess up so be ready for hate mail even if you did nothing wrong. But the feeling of a tank up with your buds and a good game overall is far better also add randoms who talk you‚Äôll make teammates fast

Yeah I‚Äôve been doing it it‚Äôs great when droning out upstairs lockers and want to hide your drone. This is so that way if the defender tries to rotate through the window and they didn‚Äôt break it we can hear them.

This spot has been around forever, I've watched it for about a year or two now, my friend does too, he's only seen one or two people there in this time - but now it got posted to reddit and it's this huge thing now.

I've set a fps cap at 50fps and lowered all of my graphics settings to the lowest competitive quality. I feel at a disadvantage if I done use it in fullscreen.
