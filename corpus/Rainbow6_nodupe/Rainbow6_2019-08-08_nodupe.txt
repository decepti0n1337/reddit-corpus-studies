Ive never heard someone complain about loading screen times being calculated in play time. That is some gatekeeping right there.

I think she acts as a better learning operator rather than a main, shes taught me how to flank better, aim better, and flash better to maximize the use of her gadget and sub-par weapon (fmg-9)

I have several questions

Thanks

Are you going for the achievement? Mute on plane, take the front room. Reinforce as much as you can first round. Should have darn near every wall reinforced by the second, mutes up on each wall and they can only come in one door.

Got that the other day too. Guess what a got

yep! thanks again! i'll owe you a match :)

Yeah its nothing wrong with the strat, the enemy team just sucks ass

It's only an ace if you kill 5 opponents and yourself simultaneously

I made this as an easy cosplay to go along with a group that had pool party operators as well. Ex. Rook was wearing a life jacket, blitz had a shield made of pool noodles, everybody in beach gear. That is all. They're kind of joke cosplays that no one seems to understand unfortunately.

If the defuser stops working when you make it fall, why can't we just hold the defuser and yeet it out

Stalker: Call Of Rainbow Six
---
Kapkan in my elo area (high gold/low plat) is actually pretty good intel gatherer. It is really helpful that they have to make a sound when they are near, either by shooting or triggering it. The only annoying thing is that they increased the number of traps along with his speed, thus making the change minuscule, as he again doesn't always have enough time to set up 5 good traps and do reinforcements.
---
so if I win a game even with a cheater on the other team, and that cheater gets banned I still lose ELO?

---
I stopped doing those half year ago, I used to have the mentality of like if something is there for you to complete then you have to complete it, I learned to ignore these win 8 round challenges after I looked at my own operator stats, that I have so much time dedicated to those Spetsnaz/GIGN/GSG9/FBI/SAS, I started playing DLC ops that I have unlocked with my hard earned renown, life is so much better :)
---
Hope Ubisoft review their own challenges, now I've officially burned out from these vanilla operator, their pick rate is like so low to me now which is a problem :P
---
Restart your fucking queue you god damn fucker

Since it telegraphs your position to the enemy team, I find it to be more of a detriment than a benefit. Realistically, you should never be hip firing in Siege unless you desperately need to. Shield ops are the only exception to this rule and I always run Monty and Blitz with lasers. Otherwise, I avoid them like the plague
---
I'm a noob so sorry for the dumb question but did she have a Galil before?
---
You literally just said its standard. So i wouldn‚Äôt expect someone with a pea brain to understand if you playing literally against the same ping. GTF

No

Defenders don‚Äôt need ACOGs, change my mind

that d50 has saved my life so many times. I play as Valk and bb. I don't run suppressor and It chunk chunks through even rook and doc
---
It‚Äôs an old one that got filter away along time ago but it‚Äôs like like blue dragon or something like that
---
it's kinda balanced but it feels so chewed out. every attack feels the same. it's not a fun map imo.
---
I spit out my drink when I read this

FUCKING IDIOT GET OFF MY POST.

better a constant 120 than a stuttering 144 imo

Well one way to change your mind is some defenders need the Acog specifically j√§ger and bandit they deserve it even if there is toxicity that comes with it (spawn peeks)

This task a grueling one

Hey man I‚Äôll play with you.  If you play on PS4, my gamer tag is Mbrez69
---
Ok thanks
---
Hibana is a little questionable but the rest I totally get. Hopefully this is the next trend because let‚Äôs be honest, Jackal and Echo are not the deserving of being banned EVERY MATCH.
---
Yes
---
I mainly play casual. I don't like having to stress about how I play, plus ranked is really toxic sometimes.
---
Yes - Armor Piercing
---
Ok thanks for your help üî•üî•
---
No - bad idea
---
The K1A is an AR platform compact rifle, and the V308 is modeled after the kriss vector, which is an SMG.
---
It's cool.
---
I love that pistol lol. And yeah, I also run the AR, with reflex or red dot. i also run an angled grip.
---
not enough
---
Most coppers/bronzes aren't really that rank, they're there to derank to boost their plat friends, and occasionally play the copper match and stomp. Next season Ubi are going to fix the mm so that high ranks can't queue with low ranks, which should eliminate most of the fake players in the low ranks. I'd give up this season because it's currently a shitshow with people running wild whilst they still can.
---
Why i dont play ranked
---
Sledge rush of Bar hatch on chalet is super fun when they are defending garage.
---
Please do
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I‚Äôm no gun guy. But the game says the K1A is an SMG and the V308 is an AR. Don‚Äôt care about the model tbh.
---
Lmao mad cuz bad.
---
Seriously though, if your crosshair placement is good, you start to get those headshots and then the game becomes a lot more fun and easy(-ish) to play.
---
I‚Äôd prefer more black people tbh. We only got castle and he sucks
---
no, because 90% of castle walls would still be torn down by teammates because castle locked everyone in or out.

his barricades need to work like garage doors, that can be opened and closed.

Maverick. DMR or assault rifle with high damage pistol, and can quietly put holes in reinforced walls
---
There are actually some really good videos out there to help.  My best tips 1 start with low sensitivity and slowly bump it up as you progress.   2 play t hunt before playing online and do not stop ads.  Ads the entire time and practise reticle placement for head shots. 3 do 2 again but with a dmr  slower rate of fire means accuracy is important.  And 4 every t hunt you play at the very beginning throw your drone into the sky and try to shoot it mid air. I promise you'll see significant improvement very quickly of you do these.  It's frustrating at first but you'll get there.

Practice on your aim you need it to be a bit more stable, also don't clip every kill you get it's kind of cringe.

There is though...

Ying's never been trash.

It could be because the environment around is at a higher temperature than normal, try turning on a fan, either pointed straight at it or in the corner for the whole room, it's been a hot summer and my Xbox has been turning the fan on at max, normally it's at a low speed
---
Not in Rainbow Six Siege
---
I don't post much to reddit at all but this has gotten bigger than I expected. I am so happy to know that now 1k people have actually gotten at least a little enjoyment out of something I posted. Nothing I have uploaded online has ever gotten this far and im so happy that I could make some people (hopefully, I like to think) laugh. Thanks.
---
That makes so much sense. Thank you
---
When you take a guess but get accused of hacks
---
I don't usually have a problem with accidental team kills, the worst experience I've had this season was today, someone shot me in the back at the start, and I dismissed it as them trying to get the camera, but after I passed the camera they shot me again so I just killed them
---
My steam says i have 1.4k hours but my uplay says i have 300+ hours on pvp
---
I only use them on shotguns and shields, although I've heard that Jackal's PDW-9 with a laser has hipfire that's terrifyingly accurate.

yup just checked the server status and ps4 is down

next time google  rainbow six server status and click the first link

Whatever attachments you use on normal guns. If you can control the recoil (which is non-existent btw), go angled.

Yet so does Rainbow. There‚Äôs an op for everyone, wether it is J√§ger and his speed, Nomad and her Counter flanking capabilities, or Rook guarding site. There is also stealth in this game too and is a big role. If you‚Äôre roaming you don‚Äôt want to be loud and be heard from a mile away, you want hide your footsteps and stalk your prey before finishing them off.
---
Um Hibana elite says otherwise

Are you running a AIO/watercooler for the CPU?

I hate N√∏kk but this is amazing! GG man
---
The new game mode looks great
---
Slow load ins arent caused by bad internet, they're caused by shit load speeds. I have gigabit internet and siege used to be on a 5400 rpm surveillance drive that had like 2.5 million POHs and that shit literally took over a full minute. Ssd means that's no longer a problem. Hes forcing the game to hang by preventing it from loading the map, ergo the game never starts.
---
Lmao
---
Very nice, but I think the mag is a bit too bent.
---
So a gun less, vigil-ablitied bomber? I like it
---
Default cam&gt;
---
\-lets ban echo!
---
\+why?
---
\-idk
---
Even his mouth is accurate :D
---
Why do people keep complaining about the same ops being banned. If an op annoys you or you don't know how to play against it, its pretty safe to ban it. Majority of players aren't playing in pro league or maybe aren't even too sure about what to ban. Banning annoying ops is a pretty safe bet. Jackal can fuck up an roamer pretty easily, Echo is just plain good/annoying, clash is hard to deal with if they play smart and most teams aren't coordinated. And again same with blitz, some people don't know how to play against him so if you ban him, you don't have to.
---
Makes sense doesn't it? Just because theres "better bans" doesn't mean everyone banning those 4 ops is bad. Difference of opinion and all that.
---

And I got told jackal was a good first op to play in offense üòÇ my stats look about the same for jackal, he's my number one played, eventho I didn't play him for a few months now.
---
Nope because swastikas are tilted
---
you'll have more potential help to team with rook. 
---
you won't always have a chance to use stim but generally everyone takes a armor. and also you can open rotation holes with impacts

---
yeah
---
Steam ads everything. It counts from the time the game is started to when it's closed again. You would be surprised how many hours add up. With siege you have the cool feature to actually compare the times (cool in my opinion) and people have differences of not just a few hours but 100s of them when talking about a player that has 1000+ hours.
---
Thank you

You are playing against literal retards.

Wow so you played siege for a complete day? Jesus did you even shower?

The four dots are for the hindu symbol specifically and the hindu swastika is not mirrored. The swastika symbol used in other religions such as buddhism do not have four dots and are mirrored.

Why does this remind me of Deus Ex‚Äôs cover photo?

Your gonna burn alright.

Jup same, its a joke. It happens so frequently aswell, around 4 out of 10 games or so. Because me and my friends live near the data center in Amsterdam we always have home advantage which means we attack first 99% of the time. This sucks cause when you get Ddosed you cannot do shit in attack. 
---
It is amazing that ubisoft hasn‚Äôt spoken about this issue yet. It ruins the game. 
---
Shittiest season so far: first IQ glitch, Clash Glitch and Shield Glitch then all the Doss. On top of that we have recycled guns with operators that are ectremely lame and a map that we already have in the ranked rotation since the beginning.

They are good but mic monitoring is when you can hear your voice through your own headset slightly ( stops me speaking too loud)

I now use a astro mix amp and sehnheiser headset and they are great.

If you have never had mic monitoring or won't miss it the hyper x are great

Let's look at other games:
---
League of Legends only requires you to get a win every day. However you want, no restrictions. Their events have multiple ways to complete a challenge. Maybe destroy towers or kill dragons. If you play ARAM, you can destroy towers instead of being force to play Summoners Rift to complete the challenge. They don't force you to play a certain role either. Even if one of the challenges says you need to heal, there are two options and You can get healing by healing yourself.
---
Example of bad challenges: Battlefield 1. Grindy and unnatural gameplay to unlock new weapons and perks. I remember one of them was getting killed with your syringe, which is less efficient than melee bc  you have to charge it up first, not to mention that you need to also not get shot at. And these challenges are completely necessary to unlock new shit. Challenges should not frustrate players. 
---
Operators cost 25k renown. That's over a hundred games that you have to play just to unlock an operator (using an average of what i usually get when i win and when i lose). They're a major source of how you obtain renown.  Giving all players the same weekly challenges is also bad design. Entire teams trying to fight over who gets Spetsnaz doesn't make the game better at all. 
---
If you're gonna have a *challenge* then why do you only get one week to complete it? Why do you have to get the same amount of kills with a SMG one week as a Shotgun the other? SMGs are used more in natural gameplay than shotguns because they're better in the vast majority of situations. Shotguns don't benefit from headshots at ALL. I'm not saying they should instakill from any headshot, but they should get a damage multiplier. I shot a guy 3 times at 8 meters with a pump shotgun where mostly his shoulders and head were peeking out and he lived with 25 hp. 
---
Battlefield V's weekly tides of war challenges have improved. Instead of forcing kills, they usually land on damage. Their challenges tend to not force you to play a certain way, offering more generic requirements that can be completed in a timely manner. Siege's challenges haven't changed at all. The devs don't give a shit. Both Battlefield V and Siege are full priced games that rely on MTX to sustain them over the years, but Siege ALSO requires you to buy new operators or grind hundreds of games to obtain them normally. In Battlefield V, you're not required to do the Tides of War challenges at all. They're just skins or if they're a new gun, you can buy it next week for in game currency which is easily obtained via end of round rewards or repeatable assignments that you can *choose* what you want  to complete. If you don't give a shit about skins, you don't have to do anything differently at all, and it won't affect your play experience because you can just buy any weapons from the Tides of War. In Siege, the challenges are tided to unlocking renown which is essential for unlocking new operators which directly affects gameplay.
---
Tbh I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt get banned for being boosted by a cheater. One of my friends got in 2 games with one (not queued) lost 50 elo and banned for 15 days, ubi system is pretty broken. Also by the fact you get more elo when you are a diamond queued with coppers and less when playing at your real rank.
---
Despite swastika on the flag being tilted, this one was used just as commonly as well.
---
I don't own kaid, therefore I can't use his shotgun. The challenges are there to earn currency to buy operators, but I don't own the operator that has a shotgun that isn't a piece of shit.
---
Very likely
---
Can‚Äôt complain if you got involved too
---
Same

I don‚Äôt see why not but unfortunately Ubi probably wont do it because he has a perfect win rate and pick rate according to mid season patchnites

You are right but some of my friends are very bad some of them are really good. So while I am playing with my Copper friends (we generally have a boosted gold with us) I lose a lot because they don't know where to put their gadgets and stuff. It takes a lot of time to coodinate the whole team so I die while trying teach them the game. I don't want them to feel useless.
---
yeah i understand that
---
Very very nice
---
Stop playing for the rest of the day

I agree, what she needed to feel whole in my opinion, was a new gun
---
As Thatcher once said, "Fookin Laser Sights".
---
Because it‚Äôs removing the game, like it never existed, so how would you earn elo in a game that never existed
---
Ok, most people who draw Swastikas in siege aren't nazis, but you don't know that because you can't take an edgy joke.
---
Dammit, thought this was real then
---
Original or not it's true so it isn't invalid
---
250 ping on eus isnt eu players eu olayers get around 80-100 ping on eus
---
not just the rotation, but the direction of the "twist" of the swastika matters too.  A nazi swastika is diamond and spins counterclockwise while the "old-school" swastika (i.e. the religious symbol) is square and turns clockwise.  It also typically features dots.

I wish there was a megaphone italics you could write it in

Because the game still fucking happened. People still spent time to play the game. If the players dodged because of the cheater, then they would have been punished for dodging. They had no choice but to play. If they weren't cheating, then they shouldn't be punished.

Nope. When wage growth stagnates, and inflation outpaces wages, you're making less money. The cost of living is growing faster than wages are rising.

At the start of the game the ops were different heights, they changed it Y1S2 when blackbeard was released

Its not tilted 45¬∞ so it's actually the Hindu swastika which is a religious symbol, not a hate symbol, but I'm sure he didn't know that and meant the Nazi one, great clip tho :)

Do you really like it? I think it looks kinda weird (you can only get the little charm next to 'Club')

This melted my brain. HOW.
---
Yeah, they're usually pretty bad, once after I logged on after not playing for like a week it said I lost elo for playing with a hacker, but i never queued up with one, but I also heard that if you beat a hacker you will get elo taken away, so I don't know if they were just on our team or if we beat them.
---
I didn't even see the Gu my god

absolutely not. casual matches are meant to be casual and have no effect on anything. penalizing people for leaving casual games would be moronic
---
The cyborg was Sonnie‚Äôs original body.
---
Console doesn‚Äôt run the same hardware, Xbox one, XB1S, and XB1X all have different Specs

i seen that. isn't that only for people attending the event in person? my concept is one for purchase or through alpha pack events. like the invitational skin in 2018. which twitch prime skin do you mean?
---
Make more
---
nah 2d charm. I would 3d model cat
---
I would 100% buy a doc and put him in my sister‚Äôs Barbie‚Äôs dream house and say he‚Äôs spawnpeeking Barbie.
---
Well, I mean I see your points and agree but the whole reason for casual is in the name. It's supposed to be casual. Just peeps playin for fun. Competitive players should probably stay on ranked or get a squad or some friends for cas.
---
I like those
---
Yeah literal scientific studies and first hand experience from these people that have, im not just touting shit out my ass
---
Looks more like lion to me
---
I still want a charm that is a 3D model of the moon
---
I just say it like Nohck
---
They are not. In-game everyone has the same character model they are only different in the lore
---
Also it could help to implement an "Overwatch" (CS:GO overwatch not blizzard overwatch) System like to find abusers, cheaters and shitters.

You are doing it right

This is such a cursed image
---
I think it‚Äôs best to be a flex player anyway, my favorite ops are Echo and Maverick but I play a little bit of everybody depending on the sight, map, and whatever else my team is running. I made a goal to try to be somewhat proficient with every operator and it‚Äôs been a blast. The only one I need more experience with is Smoke because I pick him for certain sites where I know he‚Äôs good at but I know he can be universally good on every site due to the nature of his gadget.
---
GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD

Flash hider is good for short bursts, compensator is good for repeatedly spraying (lmgs and high magazine smgs) and muzzle break is good for single shot weapons (pistols and dmrs)

Yeah, I also like the idea of his 3 speed but I don't know if I'll be able to use his gadget effectively
---
Also dok's dmr sounds nice
---
I think they‚Äôre doing it intentionally so people might use them.
---
Do you solo queue or play in a squad
---
Maverick‚Äôs gadget is really weird at first same for me I did horrible at it but I‚Äôve been getting better he isn‚Äôt my main attacker but I really like him as an operator.
---
This is a really cool idea! I also have a concept for a season, ops, etc. but I cant really make anything of it cause I suck at design

‚ÄúDonny! Another German here wants to die for his country! OOOBLAAAAIIIGE him!‚Äù

There are definitely more categories to add for them, but perhaps giving us a favourite and hide/remove/sell option as a basic feature would help. I worked with website design in the past for games that listed in game cosmetics with images, at a baseline it was just about hosting the images and having their names visible, until players asked to sort them by release, price (most expensive to cheapest) collection, theme and even tags for them to be searchable - it was a task for sure but once the leg work was done it was a much easier system to maintain, both for the development side and the viewer/player. 
---
Even with the staggering number of available and unavailable charms in game it would require someone at Ubisoft not only to code it up but to make a database with all the background work - something that would only see the light of day on siege if it was easy enough to produce and a feature that would be welcomed with open arms. I wasn't really sure about how many others would appreciate this type of feature before I made tbe post but it felt fitting to make it anyways, in hopes to hear feedback from others. 
---
Glad to hear that I am not the only charm hoarder :)
---
I would say jackal or nomad then
---
Maverick, nomad, jackal, dokke in that order. Mostly because Mav is solid across the board (weapon and utility) nomad is very useful to help with flank watch, jackal is amazing but he tends to get banned a lot during Pick and ban phase, and dokke is an acquired taste but can provide great intel with hacking cameras
---
I see the girl angrily pointing at a cat meme
---
God's been playing too many videogames
---
I think I'll get mav first then jackal bc he is only 15000 renown
---
Nah is a barricade shield
---
Sounds like a good, viable system. There are definitely more convenient ways than how they have it now! The way it tends to work for me is, I get a pack, pack something decent, then jump into a new game and forget all about what I've just unlocked! It's only when I scroll through a few weeks later that I realise to be honest
---
Tachanka is shit
---
His M4 is amazing it‚Äôs my choice of weaponary with silencer red dot and I forget if I use vertical or angled. I‚Äôd get him out of all of them honestly
---
Thank you, I'm getting maverick first then jackal or nomad
---
I don't think that was him who got banned if you got it after the next match. It was probably a hacker you played another game.
---
Now that is crazy
---
Ah I see, thanks man!
---
Look at swastika cuz hitler funny.
---
There is also room for improvement on adding an (!) and some visual glow around charms that were recently added, or perhaps when an alpha pack item is earned it is added to the notification tray, this would work in harmony with a possible charm sorting feature. Win win really!
---
Idk bro I upvoted you because regardless of info wholly agree with a person I respect their opinions unless they are arguing something illegal and morally wrong.

Similar. We had our teammate unable to fully reconnect after afk disconnecting and eventually the enemy team gave up. Same result though. Pretty sure everyone left and got the ban
---
No you don‚Äôt. The game was unfair so they voided it. 
---
If someone in a team sport cheats, the whole team losses their medals. That‚Äôs just how it works

I post them to YouTube then use a app on my phone to download it from there

You support Trump, you have a retarded fascination with guns, you're enough of a chud, mate.

If u think that‚Äôs sketchy, watch the first clip of [Smii7y‚Äôs video](https://youtu.be/f7Y2ol-dUOo)
---
Do we have a screenshot of the reward?
---
That's prolly because you can't without just punching out a circle instead.
---
Yeah if you‚Äôre playing against bots
---
I like the pic, but shes not a great operator.
---
In real sports people are paid, and intentionally choose their teammates. Also, your point would only correlate if all of the opposing teams had their medals taken back too.
---
What's Mira getting hit with
---
well, just make a recruit with all available CTU, problem solved XD

N√∏kk because warden sucks.
---
&gt; There isn't a limited amount of ELO in the world
---
Yes there is.  They only want a certain percentage of players at each rank.
---
Looks like a C4
---
&gt;You support Trump
---
Says who?
---
&gt;you have a retarded fascination with guns
---
An interest in self-protection is not a ‚Äúretarded fascination‚Äù, as you said so eloquently.
---
imagine having a delay of 100 seconds...wtf
---
Surprised someone was there. Nice job!

Same here, and I left yesterday
---
Yeah mate

Your sub reddit you follow, your talking points, and your profile picture put you squarely in the ashamed conservative area with an easy chance to get radicalized into a full blown nazi since you're so politically blind. If you looked into it (and I'm not saying just left wing ideologies.) you'd find that overall you're a capital L Liberal in the sense you believe in capitalism. So there's a good start. Horse shoe theory is complete bunk that peeps who want to keep you blind will feed you. There are easy to find defining features of different economic/philosophical systems and its important to learn them for your own sake. We currently live in a world plastered wall to wall in propeganda that we're honestly just not taught how to defend ourselves from. So honest to God all I ask is you look in politics and philosophy to get a better grip on your own beliefs and understanding of others.
---
Yeah, I know exactly what you are talking about. 
---
Ngl I never made it into plat. I am always stuck in gold because my friends are pure coppers and only troll.

Yeah, my main takeawat seems to be that it looks like they softened out the AO, it gives Battlefield vibes as well.

How did you get that charm?

Oh yeah~ It's a shame, I enjoy the mechanics the the stories are always Michael Bay worthy.
---
... 100 million deaths in 100 years apparently doesn't mark commies as bad. Got it. Sound logic there.
---
Fuze's AK and another weapon (I forgot which) do this. I don't use the AK but from what I've heard it's pretty annoying.
---
hell fucking yeah
---
Hahahahahaha omg listen to yourself I don't like you therefore you are a Nazi. You have seen Antifa and the way they attack the elderly in the streets and riot destroying shop fronts all the time? The last time a Nazi (of which I am not) did that was Kristallnacht in November of 1938 so really I'd argue it is the left that are far more radicalised in the 21st century. "Think like me or I'll call up your boss and tell him your a racist and get you fired"

5-?. I don‚Äôt care about

This also clearly affected so many people. Top priority to take care of (please forget about all of the other actual issues going on right now with the quality of the game).
---
We still have until September 10thish for the new season to start. So still plenty of time.
---
That‚Äôs an F.
---
If you assumed that ping was the distance from the server to the players, then the 101443 player is about 2 million miles away from the server.
---
On attack

Yep 20 kills for a boring wooden cat charm. The picture showed different cats with the tack helmet on and stuff like that. That would be way cuter and funnier to have.
---
It actually is on the picture (I dont have it yet but I assume it is the one next to the UbiClub logo)
---
I like how the ones who died first just left the game
---
Those fingers, I feel it
---
Your sensitivity in this clip looks way to high, you‚Äôre crosshairs is moving so far for what would normally be a small turn (based off of the general area you should have been looking at) I recommend lowering it if you are looking to improve :) (Mine is 0.002230 multiplayer, 43 both horizontal and vertical then 83 ads, 4:3 aspect and 90 FOV)

Nice! I wish you luck in many more wallbangs to come.

Hello SpicyPepperMints, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cnrwm2/weird_bug_on_yacht_its_stuck_on_this_screen/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

similar thing happened to me on bank, except it was stuck on a brick wall (those yellow bricks that use in bank). I could move and shoot, just I couldn't see where I was going or shooting
---
Like I said man I get it, that shits hard, if you see my sledge that I made on my profile, it's pretty shite
---
Yep pretty much 20 kills for nothing special just like most charm challenges or birthday skins
---
I mean you should probably look into why that might happen but most the leftist circles I run in (and I'm talking deep leftists, not socdems) might say something follows main tenants of fascist ideologies but unless you're like Richard Spencer they don't actually call ya fascist. Antifascists tend to have a deep understanding of the history of fascism since antifascism has become a bit of a tradition for most leftists. It's about deplatforming people who follow fascist ideologies so that they can't get enough power to put others in danger. If you want a clear example of modern day fascism look at peeps like Proud Boys. They're unabashedly fascist and clearly a threat to anyone who isn't like them. When we see antifascist violence it's often scuffles at protests. Nothing like the terror sprees that fascists have committed. Then the media points to video games or mental health all while ignore the ideologies that push these men to commit these large scale acts of violence. Like how the Columbine shooters had very clear appreciation for Nazi Germany. Instead they blamed Doom much like they are doing now. The reason that they have to is because of how many touch stones they share with fascist ideology. Traditionalism, nationalism, xenophobia to name a few. Republicans aren't fascist but these touch stones can get people to start to realize maybe it's not the best to keep them.

Why did it get downvoted
---
What are decent servers???
---
And thx
---
I mean I‚Äôve heard this myth where you grind *hardest* although I‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs only a myth
---
you've no idea how jealous that makes me.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to play hijacked in r6
---
Cause people dont like spawn peaking I think people like that should just get good at the game
---
I have black ice for mp5 rip
---
How is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Tread On Me‚Äù bad?
---
Tru spawn peeks are not hard to counter unless it's one of the op pixle peeks
---
Funny one
---
Don't worry guys, we only have to wait until next season for any of these problems to be touched on..
---
Thanks, how many frames do you think i can get at max / high settings?
---
Exactly it‚Äôs really not hard to place a drone where you spawn or just pre fire
---
The weak point here is definitely your ram, but everything else is more than enough.
---
Don't have a bunch of shit open though or your RAM might start swapping.
---
Ok why did he reload and then switch to the deagle?? I play mostly casual and have never seen anything like that
---
How to get this page up on PC? I've seen other people post similar pictures but don't know how to access this page myself
---
Because it makes it impossible for the roamers to come back into the objective, and it also makes rotating out of the objective impossible.
---
Never barricade off site unless you know what you're doing.
---
shoulda had broken the wall instead
---
At max settings you can probably get like 60-80. But if u go to like medium/high settings, probably 90-110.
---
Welcome back! I just started playing ranked again for the first time in 10 months and it‚Äôs so good to be back. If you‚Äôre looking for a squad on PS4 add me, it‚Äôs the same as my reddit username
---
When I roam I'd usually play a roamer with an impact and save one for that reason, but I always play with a 5 man and we co-ordinate our moves.
---
Make him a 2 speed? That's really the only thing they can change except his gadget that wont affect Clash, Korean ops, Valkyrie, and British ops. They could also give him his own guns but it's maybe too late for that.

Israel is actually, as a whole, competent unlike Palestine
---
No? The ump45 is 600rpm and the CZ is 1000, you can literally google this stuff.
---
Avoid what exactly?
---
1050rpm, so incredibly high firerate but not the highest.
---
Why you booin' me? I'M RIGHT.

Get gud lol /

Look up State capitalism. The USSR never even claimed to be commie lol

Don't celebrate it until they roll back some of that elo.

I think we have a winner.

I‚Äôm glad to know he‚Äôs alright. Btw D A T A L I M I T S

Because having an attacker than can get free kills based of the buggy sound engine is unfair.
---
He's a 3 speed fragger who hard counters bandit and mute, just accept what you've got.

idk why ur complaining, u have the best ping in the lobby. be grateful

No gpu?

You do realize that the USSR wasn't even communist, right
---
The sound engine is buggy af, sometimes you will just not hear it.
---
In Pengu's latest video the enemy thermite starts burning a wall he was literally sitting next to, but there's no gamesound at all to indicate he had placed it.
---
Can you show?
---
I've always seen it associated with the "They're tryna take my guns!!1!" crowd, but to be fair it's anecdotal.
---
What's the GPU?
---
Sometimes not barricading site can really work in your favor if you know what you're doing. Unfortunately a lot of times it just involves trash people trying to pull off strats that are out of there league and they fail miserably.

Literally

He was on a smurf account playing against low gold lobby‚Äôs is there any way to avoid playing against very good smurf.
---
She‚Äôs busy being dead
---
That's reasonable then. But most door ways should still be left open, if only to create angles.
---
Barricading them also allows the attackers to walk by without worrying about being shot, whereas having them open forces them to play slower.
---
She‚Äôs gonna interrogate his ass lmao
---
Maybe
---
Thank you for the Reply man :)
---
Ah ok cool
---
So he‚Äôs fully shielded if he‚Äôs prone?
---
Ahhh toxicity, the thing that will kill Siege, at least before Ubisoft does which will likely be next year at least. Especially for the console community at least.
---
Top left looks like Michael Myers from Halloween change my mind
---
The gadget is supposed to enchance creativity! Each canister would have the potential to make a wall as tall as you aim it and as long as 3 operators in line.A total of 3 canisters would suffice i believe...Its balance in the way that if you make more walls you essentially giving Veg more surfaces to shoot his scanner darts.
---
hah lord tachanka meme lul
---
No it was on Xbox
---
I mean it depends how many skins you have
---
Good job!
---
Sick.
---
You on xbox, my friend had a game like this
---
and still it doesn't pop up. question mark
---
did you delete the game at any point. question mark
---
Your concept? https://youtu.be/-bZnIgWOWuU
---
I see. I‚Äôve had this happen a few times on ranked when the opposing team is about to lose, it always crashes the game. I‚Äôm not sure if people glitch/trigger this somehow
---
4:3 goat
---
It's on my ps4 i did to save up space
---
Eh, thats not the worst siege has to offer. 
---
But its because a copper &amp; higher tier friends can play ranked together

The game is so used to the OPs getting banned you can see all of them outlined, like memory foam.
---
Twitch drops?
---
i cant hear what jager says ugh
---
You‚Äôre not wrong. He probably has a fuck load as he‚Äôs level 323 lol
---
He needs it desperately,  nothing a flashbang, grenade or explosives etc or even a cross angle cant handle
---
Of course you dumped on, the aim is not a joke almost everyone can get a headshot in PC so don't over peek or try to run to safety. 
---
If you know that then maybe you'll change your play style.
---
Probably because a good majority of gamers are right wing do to deliberate recruiting tactics taken during the gamer gate "movement". This shift leads to leftists ending up being down voted when they most likely bring up criticisms of the games you look up. There's a few good videos documenting that transition. Plausible deniablity and what not.
---
IMO this is even more impressive on console because you can‚Äôt make the recommendation to everyone else in game chat
---
This was already posted homie holmes
---
If you hover over R6 on the dashboard and keep pressing down you can go to the avatar section on the very bottom. Each one costs $0.49 USD (at least where I live).
---
Probably custom pictures but I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
I do not remember, I've had it for years :(
---
Etc 750?? I don‚Äôt really remember
---
Nope and they won‚Äôt come back. I get what you mean though lol I made a post like 10 months ago asking if I should buy the year 1 pass or cool pro league set, I should‚Äôve gotten that. :(
---
I'm not a chapo fan girl, I'm a communist.
---
You did also claim that having a ‚Äúreport MnK‚Äù button on console would be a great idea in a previous post from about a month ago? What‚Äôs up with that?

Mozzie

K/D isn‚Äôt balanced.

Charms earned from watching the rainbow six streams.

I don't know why they kept peeking you. I feel bad that the flash bang completely missed.

Ohh gotcha. I didn‚Äôt even know what was a thing. ü§î

What did Valkyrie do to deserve death?
---
I‚Äôm only level 3, maybe 4
---
Plus it'd be really risky to use on certain corners if the walls are soft since you can just get shot through the wall when they see your peeker.
---
I think they can trace it back to their ip address
---
The same thing for me, I bought the game on Steam. There is no option to buy any r6 credits in Asia and there is nothing we can do at this point. The only way to buy them is by using a VPN, but your account might get banned for doing that. Let me know if you find a solution for this.
---
I'm going to probably get hate for this but can't fortnite detect the input?
---
Get a group of people to play with. The discord is full of people looking for groups. Or find a clan if that‚Äôs your thing. If you have a steady group, you can mess with your play styles more and have them pick up the slack when things don‚Äôt go well

Lmao looks like one of the community devs saw this, your link doesn't work anymore

I agree man! Let's start banning random people till we hit the ones doing this! I'm sure we will only ban like, what, 5 players that didn't deserve it.
