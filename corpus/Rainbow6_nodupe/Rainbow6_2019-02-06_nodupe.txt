I've played enough casual to know that the round would probably have taken the full time to finish. Console casual is very slow, people who don't know how to play the game or don't really take it seriously or whatever. And when you get spawn peeked by some try harded who's sitting running out on you when you're afk for the first 5 seconds in spawn, you can't be arsed waiting to watch someone take 3 minutes in a 1v4 to die in the first or second fight they get into.

It's not hard to figure out the difference on code dumbass, litterly work with it daily. It's not all the same saying they just left. You have to execute a command to leave the game yourself versus a network drop.
---
Maybe goobi will fix it when they buff tachanka 
---
Why would you take time to paint the magazine? You are throwing that away anyway
---
i have a rare for thatcher’s AR33 called “Smiths” it’s pretty nice.
---
No really I didn't know it was a free item. Wow what a revelation a pack you earn by waiting for spin wheel to bless you with a common is free. Wow. And also how come everyone I fucking talk to even myself always have to wait until we're above 50% or more to get a shitty pack? Also when they're cosmetic it shouldn't be a chance system nor should it be as pricey as it is to get a fucking rare from the shop. And no shit you earn renown but the amount you get is absolutely horrible. Especially when half the fucking crap in the game that's worth getting is above 25k renown which in fact can get you an operator itself. 
---
You are the dense one. Just because you will never get caught does not mean that it is right or not cheating. And yes, I have read the Ubisoft code of conduct, thank you very much. The fact is they have no way to enforce vans on the xim, but that doesn't make it any less of a cheat.

highest i got was 43% my roommate 66%.  70% is just wrong boy.
---
It's just a matter of skill and luck.  You can stand on the counter in the middle to pick it back up on that point, so you can definitely outplay Thatcher. 
---
 Keeping that hatch secured is huge, since it denies the attackers LOS on basically all of the front of that point.  They're left with trying to push meeting hatches (which isn't great, with the Mira there) or trying to push the front or back where there's a Mira watching them with (hopefully) her C4 not wasted. 
---
Lol, utter bs. You telling me that 95% of the time I play only ranked, both solo and with friends, have plat all the time, and it's not my actual rank because of some casual cesspit having 'different ranking system'? 
---
If so, then why do I always completely demolish these silvers and low golds while high gold or plat plays decently if they happen to be matched with me?
---
I play from day one and casual (SI as well) has always been a mode where everyone plays with anyone. I even got matched with and against diamonds in casual.

2 V 4 and 3 of them decide to push ONE stair case , idiots smh , 
---
I assume that was a spider verse reference? Such a good movie!
---
I know but a random chance system is far worse from having a bar that fills up after you did something in a match. Even if you win or lose if you did well and say got 6 kills or more you get a decent percent of the bar completed because you did well. Not because oh you lost the match because your team guess what you get nothing asides 400 renown.

I really do just want a siege two at this point with a brand new engine made for siege. 
---
it's one of his grenade lines. Can't tell if it's the smoke grenade or frag grenade line. 
---
I'm starting to do it all the time now especially since I figured out how to record 1080p 60fps with no problems. But man it takes up 50 gb for one play session. GL HF in your next games
---
Right? Tired of all the toxicity. By the way can you help me complete a Ubisoft Challenge? 
---
This is one of my favorites tbh. I don't get the debate about whether a skin deserves to be legendary or not. I really don't know what people are expecting. 
---
SHHHHHHHH
---
I select my operator but as I’m loading in my game freezes/crashes. Could play fine yesterday. On PC by the way. 
---
That’s casual for you. 
---
Yeah Xbox casual is the worst, and I say that as an Xbox player. Ranked isn’t so bad on there but never play Casual. 
---
I've gotten the Ash headgear at uncommon the one that's blue and red I don't know the name of it because I don't like it but that head gear I've gotten like 8 times and sometimes twice in a row.
---
That's recruit straight booling on yatch
---
It's nothing to do with money lol. "I'll pay the game to fix its self". Negligence happens. Name one bugless game.
---
That's cool. Is it an alpha pack drop or can you just buy it? 
---
Eh its probably my favorite but that might just be because it was my first.
---
That's nice of
---
how would that work with alt+f4?
---
And I guarantee that neither of them thought after that kill “hmm maybe we shouldn’t have all pushed one stair way” they probably blamed the sledge for not shooting lol  
---
I would encourage you to try this: pay close attention to Hibana's body, her head specifically. Wait for Blitz' shoulder pad to be in position, you'll see it then. From the angle where you were at I completely see what happened. You were standing, Blitz was crouched, Hibana was more or less flat with her head up slightly. You had to have been aiming at a downwards angle to shoot his shoulder pad, making it plausible, dare I say most probable that you were hitting Hibana's head.
---
And as far as the blood spraying goes, there are no odds to dwell on. Huge blood splatter has been in the game forever. Her head was literally behind Blitz' shoulder pad, obscured from view but if you had X-ray they would line up. If Blitz' shoulder pad had a hitbox, the blood splatter would look identical because like I said, Hibana's head and Blitz' shoulder pad are in perfect alignment.
---
And for the last time, (or maybe you didn't read everyone else's comments), you are not hitting Blitz in the shoulder. If you look at the red outline of his body behind the shield, right before the kill cam, you can clearly see that what you were shooting was not a part of his shoulder. It was the excessive padding. You can connect the lines on his red outline to form his hit box.
---

The fps is really bad on PC. I have had 44fps solid and i'm dropping to 60fps a LOT.

Thanks for the help anyway, is there a formula you used to get those hipfire values?

I honestly like both styles (crazy and plain/realistic) but this sub posting these circlejerky posts about skins not deserving to be legendary just because they're not covered in neon or something crazy is just dumb. Like, what are they expecting to be legendary?
---
R6 engagements are to close quarters and too fast for a complex ping system anyways. It works in a BR because you can spot someone and still not engage them for a long time.  Arma has a basic ping (if enabled) and it's fine. You still have a compass, room callouts, drone pings, etc... Why bother investing development time for a feature they don't even want to promote? Especially when there are still numerous glitches to be fixed.  
---
Ping is fine as it is, get a mic, use the callouts, play with friends. Game is doing fine without "innovation" through copying a new game.  
---
lol
---
I have seen a teammate run-out trigger the claymore but killed the last guy before it went off. 
---
Blame the CSGO fanbase that branched out to siege
---
It's casual it doesn't count.
---
Just kidding, nice kill.
---
Not sure if ginger or redhead. Max effort for a profile pic though 
---
That’s where you’re wrong kiddo, a PS4 player isn’t intelligent enough to understand. Also it took you forever to respond with your slow ass PS4 reaction time.
---
Nothing at all
---
Play, multiplayer, create game. Not sure the exact steps but in the custom game settings there is an option for server location for dedicated servers and a whole host of options. You can basically make any game mode you want from PL settings to casual with insane round timers, turn on/off sprint or leaning, or just toggle on tactical realism. Experiment, have fun. 
---
You get to start again 
---
What’s the issue?
---
See why banning words can be a bad thing
---
Lol the Mira suggesting a Mirror.
---
Yeah man. I picked nomad about two weeks after launch and someone in a four stack messaged me saying “pick her again you’re gone” and tked me. 
---
What exactly is the problem here? You just got fuzed, no?
---
what happened 
---
So I unplug my ethernet cable, you got code that know I unplugged my ethernet cable vs a legitimate internet drop? 
---
Freah start

The emoji was for your post, not the comments. That I’m pretty sure was the first comment.
---
That's fun
---
I had a problem a few weeks ago where my frames would drop from 20-40 after a few games. Was a nvidia driver issue and I had to roll back my driver to the mid-summer driver.
---
Not really relevant to this issue, but it turns out Ubi is aware of this issue, they mentioned it on Twitter.
---
There's no sound on the cluster charge which is one of the loudest things in the gams
---
It’s not that they’re mad, it’s that they think it’s funny you worked so hard to win the round then get kicked
---
Weird flex but ok 
---
Ubi is aware, check twitter.
---
Thats a lol, how that even happened...
---
I think he likes kaid
---
Whats your next idea? Make a skill system that is implemented into casual that puts you into games based on your points or skill and you win more if you win games and lose points if you lose games.
---
Oh I didn’t have sound on. Understood now
---
I mean, Need For Speed and FIFA are built on Battlefield engine.
---
Im down to put bans in ranked. No more echo or cav.
---
bruh there so bootleg 
---
Ahh shit was that in the patch notes?
---
Funnily enough Alibi in the S.I menu uses the same gun her profile pic has, when we both know she uses two revolvers.
---
Who’s kaid
---
Even if it was a corpse blood would still splatter from his dead body , hits shots aren’t registering regardless
---
People who fought against racism also were the minority. Clearly they were wrong... you majority argument seems to be your last resort, because that is worth nothing at all. And, luckily, people who support kb+m on consoles become more and more.
---
Can u record it? 
---
Excellent work! With 22 health to spare. Hopefully, you guys were able to bring the match back with all that momentum!

We’re brits dude

smoke particles. origin point must have glitched out or not loaded in time for the ending camera shot
---
You wouldn't use a lightning gun to play a racing game. Why expect everybody to use a controller in a shooter?
---
To be fair with a bit of practice you can learn to lean very fast with a regular controller too , I’m pretty quick with leaning myself but I practiced it a ton in terrorist hunt , at least 3 hours a day till I got it down perfect 
---
This shit is the reason I stopped playing
---
This is reason number 1 of why I also quit playing on Xbox. Vote should not be in casual, people vote to kick for the most trivial bullshit. Don't like their name, op they chose, not in their party, didn't rush with them, didn't choose recruit or same spawn, "stole a kill", etc. It's toxi af.
---
Im visibly better when im sober....but its more fun when im high
---
They gave Kaid's shotty the PC recoil on console. Literally can't be controlled with a controller. After one shot you're looking at the ceiling, no matter how much you compensate. 
---
My first game is always really good but my play rapidly declines after the first game. 
---
I prefer black
---
Eww tower used to be in ranked?
---
What the fuck is this? Lmao
---
so, next year by ubisoft patching speeds
---
This legitimately pissed me off.

I think it goes without saying you'll perform better without anything impeding your senses.

---
What has this to do woth anything? Sure its better. Thats why people use it. The exact same how you wouldn't play a fighting gane with KB+M or a racing game with a lightning gun, they aren't playing a shooter with a controller. When you want to play a shooter with a controller, then please do so. But don't get mad at people using an input device which is better suited because they don't want to deal with shoddy controls.

Why the tea bagging?

I really don’t think you would get people choosing to play against other m+k the whole point they do it is to win and get a serious advantage. If they were to play against other k+m players they would loose that advantage and may as well just go to pc.
---
I can understand that people have preferred input methods and that but if you preferred m+k wouldn’t you buy a pc?

Lol. That's what those idiots get

Already showed what my level was when I killed em.
---
i actually used it for the first time ever today and got 2 kills with it 
---
Audio is super bugged lately 
---
Sometimes you can't hear footsteps , you can't hear reppellers or them entering in and it got me killed several times 
---
You can't hear explosions , cluster charges , guns 
---
Sometimes the whole sound system breaks where if you're an attacker the sound is fine outside , go inside all you can hear is comms , reload and drone jumps but no landing 
---
On defense your right is left , shooting at something yards away it sounds like it's right next to you 
---
You have to restart your game to fix it .
---
They need to fix the audio I got killed a lot of times by missing and misleading audio 
---
Ahh I did not see that
---
lol I remember when his shield was able to withstand those suicide bombers in terrorist hunt 
---
Now that's a salty response dude. Take the dub and be happy without showing off
---
That would straight up kill a muffucka
---
You're joking right?
---
Baiting the tkers into another tk feels like nirvana. 
---
It really is. And I, as well as most of us, have ignored and, well, tolerated a lot of things. But as you say, when things keep adding up and you don't only have to deal with bugs and questionable audio, but also objectively unbalanced or plain bad maps, cancer like the crouch/lean spam and other exploits... It affects so many aspects of the gameplay and experience that it's hard to keep enjoying the game like before.
---
Yokees ?
---
Everything frlt slower since Para Bellum.
---
😂
---
While I agree the recoil is bad, it's not completely unusable. 
---
Yeah, especially, because all you can do is report them for toxic behavior. Which means most likely Ubisoft isn't going to be listening to how they're communicating. I've literally had matches where one of my own team members has killed me if I played any other hero that wasn't a female like what the fuck. 
---
*NOOOOOOOOOO*
---
Do you have an umbrella?
---
That's indeed true for a couple of US States where you pay sales tax on top of the 29.99. If you live in such a state, you should get the 5 USD discount.
---
IIRC, in most states there's still no sales tax for Steam (software) purchases though. But I haven't really been following all that news that much, since I always pay in euros myself.

Plat and above is literally 24/7 scrims in ranked. It's just 5 stacks sweating their balls off... Meaning yes, they do play coordinated making BB the 300\*HP window God. 
---
Regardless. The operator, when used **PROPERLY** is fucking stupid. Just because you play against people who use him wrong does not mean he's balanced.
---
People being stupid =/= proof of an operators balance.

---
I’ll give you that, some legendaries don’t deserve to be legendaries, this should be like a rare/epic. But there are some really nice looking epic/rare skins that look nice!
---
No u
---
for me, it's either play casual and listen to all of that, or play ranked and most of the time nobody in rank is communicating.
---
Live in AZ, can confirm
---
Personally I think they should have native M+K support on console, however using a M+K will put you on servers separated from controller users. Then anyone using a xim or something like that in regular servers should be banned.
---
The only problem with this is that Ubi decided to let Sony and Microsoft handle the bans (at least that's how it was last time I checked). And I highly doubt Sony will ban anyone since they have their own licensed keyboards for PS4, idk about Microsoft tho.
---
I mean, not necessarily, professional boxers and martial artists can deliver a few hundred pounds of force in a punch, and this force is spread across the entire body, rather than localized. It's also a high estimate. If the airjab dispersion time is .2s instead of .15s, the force drops to around 450 lbs.
---
Caveira punched her. When Cav uses her Silent step the knife changes to fist and downs the enemy instead of kill.
---
That jackal lion combo is so cheap. I played a Jackal, Lion, Dokk, Blitz, Ash team call me cheap for spawn peaking them once and I did that specifically because they played this team the last time they attacked
---
As far as I know that’s the first and only time they’ve done it. Hopefully because there was such a positive reception they’ll do it again eventually.

---
I swear I thought I was the only one

Treat them like the bullies from when you were in school. Just ignore them. Giving them a reaction validates their dickhead behavior. Don't leave the game, don't talk shit. Report (if you believe that button does anything) and finish your game. Mute them if you have to and don't tk.
---
I don't think anyone does this shit when they are solo-queueing... So they're looking for a reaction from their friends. The "joke" to them is that the person they're fucking with could react negatively to a tk. If you don't react, the joke has no punchline.

Guarantee you most players won't have that kind of skeptical thinking in banning operators. 99% of the time its "I want to ban x cause I think I'll win". And by win, it turns out to be the operator that is most inconvenient to their favorite operator, and not to the team.

2 cents: some people like me dont like controllers they just feel off in a Fps or 3rd person games. I play on PC so it's not on issue but you cant really hate on people's choice of controls. Also I played with a chick that would destroy on PC with a controller but couldn't use M/K to save her life.

Yeah I remember the days when I was a hardcore top tier xbox player, and now when I play it looks like a caveman grabbed the controller lol.
---
How do I get to the steam support?
---
What did they say about him?
---
This is photoshopped 
---
Yes. Now that i've played that SI playlist I don't even want to play ranked/cas anymore. I only play the game on the weekends now. It has completely ruined the other modes for me. Feels like the way the game is mean't to be played.
---
There's a support option in the top drop down on the desktop application
---
Hacking on console is either extremely rare or impossible, because the diamond you tubers on console never report hackers. Furthermore, playing kb&amp;m it would should his key binds on his hot bar with keys, not buttons. And this guy is playing ash on console so ez recoil control, and he’s obviously a higher level player because he knows how to aim for the head.
---
There was Cav's slight rework, an MP5 nerf, and a recoil fix for Kaid. Along with a ton of bug fixes. Problem is those "bug fixes" have introduced more bugs than were in before. Like they apparently fixed a P9 sight alignment problem but instead just reverted it back to the old version!?
---
idk what to tell you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Just because it is played a lot doesn’t mean it’s too good and needs to be nerfed. The win % May be so fucking high, but why?? Is it because they go fast and you can’t aim or is it because the gameplay is broken where a 3 speed with an acog and spawnpeek and dominate where there’s a clear issue. The only clear issue with 3 speeds any brings up is the win % is high. So what??
---
BLACK
---
Thats a bold claim from /u/analleaseholder
---
There has always been problems with melee and hitreg in general. Server problems are not helping.
---
Everything you said is accurate. I just switched to pc from Xbox and I can confirm console is permanently on ubi’s back burner. No gun sound glitches that were always on Xbox (which are still unfixed on Xbox) is one example that comes to mind 
---
U bet he doesn't even get 20 kills.
---
r/woooosh
---
I know someone who is a consistent low silver player who insists they're plat. 
---
They don't play the obj. They just run in, try to get a kill, die and then get mad at teammates for not helping.
---
I don't play ranked with them anymore.
---
Yeah plasma pink. Its the one legendary that i would really want
---
: (
---
We are getting word it was spotted on the other side of the border
---
They were talking about security on the US/Mexico border. “Security on the border” is what the text says. 
---
Hahaha wow that's cool!!
---
The leftover balloons from “Up”
---
It says in Spanish "Blackbeard nerf incoming lol nubs" 
---
Yes but please try a display port maybe that will be the solution
---
But.. it is bannable
---
I don’t speak Jager main 
---
Lmao
---
They should announce Tachanka on wheels next 
---
Welcome to Siege on Xbox. Not sure how PlayStation is but it's become really bad on Xbox. 
---
i fux wit dis
---
why would you say something?!?!? NOW THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of more toxic players are going to use this you fucker! I know youre trying to help but you arent! you need to report this to ubisoft instead!!! God damnit dude, the crouch and lean spamming is already awful and now a FAMOUS YOUTUBER and a reddit thread has been shown for this!!!
---
I got this one out of a pack. Made me kinda sad lol
---
No way that only 35lbs of force would send a 300lb unit like rook back like 6 feet. *AND THROUGH WALLS*
---
You messed something up. Force isn't constant in this.
---
I think he should have AP rounds in his lmg so he can do damage to shield ops, not to much to where it’s overpowered but enough to make it viable. 
---
Unfortunately the truth. 
---
Yeah
---
Do you need anything?
---
I'd be surprised if it were defender sided. In almost all of the matches Mira have been banned (a lot of them) people are genuinely struggling with holding certain sites and are still going to sites that absolutely requires a Mira to hold efficiently (Theatre/Penthouse being the prime example).
---
It’s only toxic if you too frag and lose the match, then proceed to call your own team shit 
---
not detectable 😴😴😴
---
SOUP
---
I hate the small metal bars and grating in this game. That last clip basically shows why. You can be perfectly lined up on the enemy and they can see you perfectly too, but god the game decides that you hit the 2d thin bar with your massive DRM.
---
OP's a silver lol
---
DAMN 
---
What kind?
---
Is the Y3S4.2 patch the one that finally fixes Kaid's shotgun primary's recoil?
---
CHUNKY 
---
*Bandit has been removed from the game*
---
I remember when that bad boy could withstand the suicide bombers from T-Hunt. 
---
superb!
---
Too op!!
---
I think you blew your cover as a time traveler.
---
They “support” mouse and keyboard but just plugging and chugging does not work on either console. I’ve tried many times to use my razor keyboard on my Xbox and PS4 and it does not work. You have to have some kind of special bullshit to make it work correctly. 
---
Legendary for finkas weapon is neat
---
Wait, is ubisoft gonna Nerf him in front of the country?  
---
 Ye this is terrible, I'm going to report this to ubisoft... (considers cav main for the next week) 
---
Meaning that i have to create another uplay account to make a smurf account? Aside from the uplay account that i made when i first bought siege using steam? 
---
found the silver
---
I'd have to clutch first :(
---
Well I suggested to have a 2 second delay before it can start electrocuting the wall and make her have to be up close to the wall for it to work. 
---
I would have liked the S.I playlist a lot more if people used the ban system properly. Everyone only votes for Lion, Blitz, Echo and Caveira (in my experience) because they're annoying even though there's potential to limit a strategy like Thermite/Montagne push from dirt on Club House, or Mira/Smoke in vault on Bank which could be more beneficial than banning Lion and Blitz, especially since there's still Jackal, Dokkaebi, Ying and Finka to make up the cancer meta
---
I got huge fps drops after the last update, but the the weirdest thing is that sometimes it feels like being blocked by invisible objects. So it is not just the fps for me.
---
Report toxic behaviour does work and map preferences are for T-hunt only. You can select modes to play in multiplayer, but not maps.
---
i had this happen last night on consulate. the cav was in the upstair secure room while the secure room was down below it and she could see through one of the dividers and shot me and i had no idea where i was being shot from. 
---
I think it's likely that they did not use English words for the search. 
---
Then again, you could make the exact same argument with Mute, having a great primary, ability, a nitro, and he still has the best machine pistol in the game, as well as having defender's advantage. I think Ubisoft prioritizes defending Operators way too much now that I think about it, giving them game-changing gadgets and abilities, while attackers are just getting lazier and lazier with each new season, with the exception of Dokkeabi and Maverick. 
---
You realize the gun basically shoots the same thing as the d eagle that valk and black beard uses, which is the 50ae. This gun does not shoot what the Barrett shoots
---
Laser sight.   
---
Acog or whatever 1x sight you like.   
---
Muzzle break   
---
Grip is your choice, but recoil is pretty controllable imo.  There’s basically no horizontal recoil.   
---
Also the secondary shotgun is amazing for floor destruction.   (You can scan footprints from the floor below, and it’s a great way to kill anchors)
---
#LEAVE ALL LUGGAGE BEHIND

You still get outbreak packs.

Desperately needs a more competitive gun.

Skin for the fmg-9
---
Watched all of it.
---
He has shifted away from Siege School to do lots of solo smurfing, where he just complains a lot.
---
I mean if he wasn't on your que then you have nothing to worry 
---
do you know what operators you get?
---
I’m gonna rock your world right now. Rook is only 160 pounds. Caveira is also 160 pounds. Rook weighs the same as cav
---
I'm just saying it would be nice, no need for the toxicity 
---
You can make custom emblems that looked like operator icons in r6
---
Yeah i kind of agree. Shotguns can be aids for running on attack most of the time and LMG's as a whole are in a pretty bad place. At least she has a good ability to compensate for it a bit.
---
Duplicate common 
---
Idk what else the gold edition gives, but you get the outbreak packs, but you can't buy more, just the ones they give you, i know this bc a friend of mine bought the gold edition and i explained him the same thing
---
Same here. I've crashed 7 times in the past two hours.
---
Gläser, three smoke grenades would be good
---
A bit? The only lmg I actually have fun using is the Alda 556 but that things recoil is tough on console. I wish lmgs weren’t as frustrating to use 
---
Frost, her gun isn’t good and her gadget is bad, rework or buff to smg would be nice
---
Oof
---
It should be there until at least next Tuesday? Since Tuesday is when PSN updates.
---
I have that one! Too bad I hate non-lethal fuze!
---
Gold?
---
20 base ops and 8 year 3 ops.
---
Nah
---
Ubi couldn't deal with that hitbox
---
Ok thanks 
---
Imagine complaining about kill stealing in casual doe
---
What was it all about?
---
i’m honestly so sorry, i have no words 
---
You know that how? Any links?
---
I agree. He has a lackluster AR and only has an lmg as another option.
---
yeah, im pretty sure this was on purpose
---
Rooks mp5
---
Whoa what's Keemstar doing there
---
I think glaz with 2 smokes is already good enough seeing as how he's the only operator who can actually see what he's doing when he's in smoke.
---
Really?, i saw the mute jammer and echo drone one but never seen a bandit wire myself.
---
A vigil ability buff, bc if you use cloak the Radius is 12m and you are basically yelling "hey drones, watch out theres a vigil Main in the room nearby" and they will be extra careful when pushing
---
I gree with the traps. They are just way too easy to spot. 
---
Same
---
*Or the ability to think.
---
FTFY
---
Give it a try. It's a really good gun.
---
Ah okay that explains a lot
---
Democrats claim thatcher will show simply show up.
---
1. This last one wasn't for a pack (don't know about the first one since i didn't play that week but would assume not)
---
2. You have to have contributed at least "1" to qualify for the reward
---
They always said it was more of a mindset thing. Basically they wanted their designers to imagine a LOT of operator options, not necessarily 100.
---
Need to buff his gun output damage. 
---
Well shiii. Here I was thinking the reward was a pack. I’ll have to go back and see what the rewards actually were. Thanks, friend.

Umm csgo isn't all that smooth. Multithreading is limited to 2 core realistically in that. Still that engine is optimized for potato pcs pretty much. CoD is also pretty outdated tbh. Damn now I don't feel that bad about siege's game engine.

Better to upgrade the engine but that's laughable cause I remember back in August 2018 they said they testing a new physics system to reduce on the TTS.

That was followed by two game breaking operations xD😂

Oh my bad. I missed that part. I recently reinstalled and mine was like 60-80GB (cant remember exact size). Id recommend re-installing. I cant quite think of anything else that could help you. Goodluck though. 
---
EZ
---
Sounds like a viable buff. Ubisoft should look into it. 
---
it's already out!
---
Agree. I think both pros and casuals will be happy with the changes.
---
A bit like when North Korea used footage of CoD MW3 to show it attacking America.
---
Yeah but I do remember them saying that they are invested in making this game last for 10 years.
---
Well its an optimistic outlook, and if they pull it off. Kudos.
---
That's why I am waiting for this year's roadmap before buying the season pass.
---
Cause that might make or break the game. 
---
It's not a bug, the old one was misaligned. You can see it in the patch notes.
---
You are correct sir however the Key word there is "start". As a Cav player myself I can honestly tel you that 70 % of the time they leave before you can start interrogating unless you play very recklessly witch ends in your death 90 % of the time.
---
Nomad is good imo
---
thanks i guess
---
Personally i would hate for the banning system to Come to ranked. But i would welcome a compromise with a separate gamemode called competitive or something. Where only 5 stacks play against other 5 stacks. Considering the banning system is ment to destroy tactics and not Just operators you dislike to play against. 
---
Google search results vary depending on your metadata. Creepy, I know.
---
I guess you’re welcome 
---
Yes that's correct. But it matters if I only had to deal with one Famas or RC4 per team with attachments. I agree in that sense that ranked is a frag fiesta but again these changes would just push it towards to that direction. " Well, the answer is that gadgets are important enough that the meta naturally gravitates toward them " -&gt; that should be the whole point of the game. Why we should encourage players to disrupt this. Play as a team by using your gadgets to solve certain problems. Just imagine what would happen for example to casual after this. It's a joke as it is now but imagine after the changes what would happen.. it would be not be a pleasant experience. Also when you would like introduce changes in the game you have to think how could that be corrupted on the highest levels. There I see big problem.  Again would you enjoy destroyed by a diamond/plat team of smurfs with recruits?  "This change would not ruin the meta, but it would allow for more player choice. " - &gt; That's the thing which is a current issue.. people choosing operators based on their guns not on their gadgets Ash is the prefect example 70% pick rate is way out of control. Also playing twitch without even trying to destroy gadgets/mira windows. The amount of people who would be satisfied way less than the amount who could be potentially affected by the negative part of this. That would only solve a problem which is quite easy to handle now. If you like a certain gun just choose an operator who has access to that.
---
They should've used that White House movie. 
---
She’s way more fun to play than the other three options . If you got any of the other ones you’d just get bored of them and go back to you’re usual main. I have all of the ops and I don’t ever touch lion jackal or finka unless the other team is being toxic.
---
Daaamnn Border rework coming. Where can I read the patch notes?
---
It's a shit situation but this is technically against the subs rules as which hunting. Remove their names and it'll be alright.
---
There's not much you can really do besides what you've already done mate. Keep on hounding ubi with it every time.
---
Try to use mobile hotspot
---
I’d recommend valkyrie then. You may not score many kills, but you provide the team with vital support with your cams.
---
thank you! I'll buy Nomad 
---
I mean this is super old but sure 
---
What anime is this?
---
It’s definitely a myth that people are kicked constantly on console. I’ve been kicked a handful of times and my friends have been kicked a few times. So, yes, it does happen, but it’s not 24/7. It’s the random team killing that’s big on console. If I said team killing was rare, that would just be a lie.

i pick this one yesterday

is there no yellow on that skin or the quality just prevents us from seeing it? Otherwise odd name

Do you understand Spanish? If so you can watch DriD, he uploads full streams and competitive matches, he’s a former pro league player and now is trying to qualify for CL

Yea thats the other thing there are sooooo many maps and I juust cant learn them they're so complex and all... 
---
Nice loop lol
---
Lol what is this a Kpop music album???
---
The story of Blackbeard is the story of the wall. It was initially sold to us as this indestructible, impenetrable barrier, but it has been nerfed so many times that getting through it now is no problem.
---
True some exceptions like Maverick or Glaz can be good. But comms and cams with general map knowledge can counter this easily.
---
 If I know where Glaz, Maverick or any op is then I can know how to avoid them. On defense, they have to come to me. If your defending you can be droned out and your already at at disadvantage for your low TTK and no recoil deduction. Spawn killing, maybe but again drones and my gun resets less cause I have no recoil reduction, unless I'm a headshot god.
---
Just think the negatives doesn't outweigh the positives. I don't think they are in a good place. But you have good points.
---
And when you do T-Hunt, go Glaz or someone with a DMR, do ONLY HEADSHOTS.  Don’t worry about winning, just headshots. 
---
237253-10
---
Good code
---
&lt;3
---
Omg I want that Legnedary, I was looking to mix with his Handgun skin "Lookie". 
---
Got a bit of a Twitch there
---
It was a big problem at the time, if you used a shield operator too it meant you had 12 smoke grenades. Each smoke grenade lasts 8 seconds, so you could have 96 seconds of permanent smoke for Glaz to abuse, thats more than half the round timer. 
---
Honestly I think Flashbangs need to go down to 2 too. As at the moment you can clear an ADS and have a flashbang spare, so it pretty much means Jager ADS does nothing. 
---
True Glaz would get a definite indirect buff, maybe add tracer lines back for rebalance. Would be interesting to testing and extended barrel needs some love as well. 
---
Why didnt u shoot
---
Look i played CSGO 1200+ Hours and i am so happy with my aim in CSGO i can hit so many deagle headshots and i always be top fragger , but when i play R6S its not the same i mean its all about strategies and positioning and holding angles , i have a tip maybe it can be helpful for you it worked for me at every game , any game you want to master it you have to watch guides and tips and tricks on youtube , you may get some tips that will change your play style and maybe you are doing something wrong , spend more hours and watch some guides .
---
Thermite is already extremely useful with the strongest hard breach device and a good gun. Giving him smokes would be overkill.   
---
However flashbangs are not great for him either and rarely used. Would it make sense to trade them for Breach Charges?
---
Emotional control is part of performing well. It is tough when surrounded by negative randoms. Just worry about the next game. Maybe wait a while before you queue the next game? 
---
Solo is tough.
---
Ranked has a smaller map pool, which could really help learning them. Also - watch your killcams and understand how you got outplayed and if you can steal the idea (was it a pixel peek? did he open a hole and push from the other side?) or if you can counter it (was it a pixel peek he held earlier? so you could just go a different route or (with map knowledge) sneak up on him).
---
Pretty much everyone sucks in the beginning. If you're good at CSGO and similar games, you can just rush in and deny the tactical aspect of the game. I despise it, but it helps doing *something* in this game.
---
Yeah I agree. Either that or increase the amount of projectiles an ADS can shoot. I reckon they’ll bring out an operator with a similar role to Jäger later this year anyway, similar to Kaid &amp; Bandit.
---
Blackbeard came with Border tho, it's just natural XD
---
The mods lost control of this subreddit from very early on, they let all the cosplay and artwork flood through without a problem and now it means 70% of this subreddit is artwork. 
---
Honestly I would much rather have more discussions and ‘better’ gameplay clips. Because most of the clips at the moment are pretty lacklustre. Something that resembles the CS:GO or competitive OW subreddits, where people actually talk about the game. 
---
OP is a state of mind.
---
OMG how did you sync beat on game XD
---
They are honestly pretty good weapons. The smg had No recoil and the shotgun is an almost 100% kill at close range
---
he scared me shitless
---
Honestly Clash’s MP9, that thing shreds now. 
---
Do they peek a corner quicker when crouch spamming? Because it looks like it
---
Bandit is selling some of his products again

That's exactly how it goes. The amount of clips i have of me getting vote kicked while in the midst of clutching and finishing the job is obnoxious.

Thats actually satisfying. Not for them
---
Ranked isnt like that in siege from my experience (close to 700 hours) ranked is usually eons less toxic than casual. People try, are more likely to be using mics and work a little better as a team. (so long as you're mid gold and higher) copper and stuff is pure cancer, but gold is pretty decent player wise.

Fortunately though, there is a very slim chance you will run into the same person again that same day. I think the experience is better when I queue during certain times of the week than others. I keep note of these a lot. It’s usually Sunday afternoons that have the highest amount of trolls and bad games over all. So I’ll just play another game those days.

They've got about 300-360HP. Depends on whether melee is supposed to do 100 or 120 damage. Nonetheless, it takes 3 melee swings to kill one.
---
Alternatively, you can shoot the screen on his back, hip or shoulder to neutralize his device. Electrified shields, barbed wire and walls also work, no matter if Bandit or Kaid. As do Mute &amp; Thatcher. Twitch is also a possibility, but you need to hit the backpack/screen 3 times, which can be challenging.
---
Also, if the bomber is the last enemy alive, no matter if Classic, Extraction or any others, he can't detonate even if his device is still online.
---
While I do agree it's outrageous that such a simple bug got through and the patch got delayed, a lot of this is also Microsoft/Sony's fault couz they hate hotfixes and micro-patches unless your game's in BETA
---
Rainbow 6 was probably the most welcoming game with a high learning curve I've ever played. I told people I was new and they helped me through things and showed me the ropes. Honestly I sticked to it because around 85% of who I met was friendly enough to have patience for me being new. Now when I see someone doing bad, before actually criticizing them I make sure to check their level and ask if they're new, if they are I offer help and tips
---
So now we are making fun of school shootings here too?
---
I agree
---
I bet he hadn't tried German recruit rushing with a shotgun while autisticly screeshing. If you haven't done that have you really sieged at all? 
---
Isn't a alpha pack around that price? You could just buy another one :/

I play on console and I can say both his guns are easy to control

Yes, I understand that. 
---
Sorry Ela not everyone has 1080rpm
---
that one doesnt suck i have it and like it
---
Mate have you see his win delta
---
More terrifying than some scary movies out there.
---
His winrate could be bad because people who play him suck brother
---
Its called Joystick and its purple
---
Sorry meant to respond to u/sakaka99
---
Its simple. They dont care about winning they just want to troll/annoy you. They seek "fun" and if they cant have "fun" with them "owning" the enemy team they will see you as "ruining" that "fun" and will try to troll and make you mad as alternative "fun". 
---
I would recommend rogue9 and varsity gaming. They are both my go to toilet YouTube between matches. 
---
If you kill 2 teammates the 30 min ban is automatic... Go to drink a coffee, smoke a cigarette and you will be able to play 
---
It’s either that or my whole team is full of unfunny edgy teenagers who’ll team kill, and spam mic with their lame jokes.
---
Every operator who isn't OP starts out with a bad win delta 
---
Soloqueue is a fucking nightmare, on PC it's the least bad I think because you can still communicate with your teammates, but on console it's a true nightmare and I'll often get fucked by my teammates if I do soloqueue.
---
I suggest you should find some ppl irl that want to play siege with you or online. 
---
Increase the AUGs damage to 30 and give it an ACOG. Let’s see if that’s enough.
---
And instant activation on hatches seems a bit too much. 
---
Based on nothing? I could provide examples and examples of why this sub is going downhill in quality and how the game has gotten bland over the months. Btw like I said, you assume it’s a recycled BR when you’ve probably never even touched the game. That’s how you are ignorant. I’ve had 1050 hours in rainbow and I’ve been here since health. I used to play this game to the fullest. I’ve experienced everything with this game. However, it’s starting to follow this trend where Ubisoft prioritizes pro league and pro league players over the community and the game. I’ve seen this before with call of duty. Ubisoft is making more decisions based off of pro league player preference than they are listening to the community. I mean it’s evident based on how slow they are to reply to player feedback and how fast they are to listen to pro league players like pengu. That poor communication with the community is what is making this game bland.

Ah okay

Bandit probably had higher ping is my guess. I play EU as a US user and only go this cancer when people like to make a deal about "Peekers advantage" \*Frankly it doesn't exist anymore unless crouch spamming is involved, IE popping up over a shield constantly.\* I feel when I do, it mostly works on lower aim skill players who can't adjust aim to center mass as well. &lt;Aiming for center will likely get you an incidental headshot in this case, said from experience.&gt;

It’s a bug that’ll be fixed. Holo sight reticle is also thicker again. A lot of minor details rolled back for some reason when they released the update, so if you prefer these irons, play with em while you got em.

Especially right after planting lol

This.
---
i think there should be a gamemode for new players with only Y1 ops. don't know how to keep the pros with smurf acc away tho
---
Siege has never been realistic
---
I mean lion is an issue, i just dont see him as big of a problem because ubi is already working on it sure it could take a minute that and theres ways around it try to stay near cover or spawn peek but Monty can melee me well after ive pressed the button and almost hit him in the face with my knfie/gun stock
---
Siege has never been realistic ever
---
~I SMELL PENNIES~
---
Yep. We know
---
Well, can't speak for this guy's experience, but my first casual game I got team killed for pulling down a Castle barricade, after he enclosed the entire team in one of the bomb sites.  Haven't looked for a PvP game since, just occasionally playing TH, whilst looking for team mates starting out to team up with - 1 1/2 months later and can't find any, just decent guys around Gold level offering to help out, but I'm just not interested in Gold lobbies.
---
So yeah, well, maybe not hates new players, but it can sure be punishing, off-putting even. I'll give it another month and half, but if at the end I can't find anybody starting out, I'll probably put the game down for good.
---
That being said, I'm a solid Rocket League player and chatting with new guys in the Discords I visit, it's the same for them: guys trolling, own-goaling, AFK'ing - so I imagine this could be said for any established game you start out in.
---
Np. And I found that playing fast paced games like black ops 4 heavily improves your tracking ability like crazy. This is pretty important considering you’re gonna want to track your enemy’s face ASAP for this game. Either that or constantly practicing on fast paced levels on Osu which a lot of people said improved their aim as a mechanic so I’m giving it a go too since it seemed kinda fun with how hard it is
---
my favorite thing to do with cav, nice clip!
---
I can see it 
---
I played my first match on pc last night and it was just one sweaty dude harassing some other dude, I wonder if it gets better 
---
The fact is, all things considered, there's no better shooter on the market than Siege. I still routinely learn new stuff about all maps even though I've been playing since Black Ice.
---
Ps bring back Bartlett
---
I am upvoting so that more people will know of your shame. 
---
Heck both bandit and ash have my uniform and headgear mf and they're my main its a heavenly gif
---
I suggest you give [Official Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/rainbow6) a try
---
IMO the concept is very bad 
---
i wouldnt say it hates new players. its just a LARGE learning curve, even though they probably get tk'd alot, i did
---
It's great I wish I could only face diamonds so I can improve.

Casual is full of sweats. Got into a game with 5 200+ players on opposing side. It's not fun when I wanna chill instead of playing ranked

I watched a 1v1 once and it lasted 7 minutes of us watching a guy with an M870 and the objective was contested and we lost the round

I'm just saying, crouch spamming doesnt work as well in the high ranks. Like yeah it's annoying, and it can be a problem, but most of the people i run into dont spam anything except their pistol. I get a diehard crouch lean spammers once every like 10 games, and in ranked it's like one in 8. Oh and about your comment, yes most people that I play with and against have a reaction time of around 220 ms, with the best being around 150. This is very similar to pros, and reaction time isnt even really that essential unless you have awful reaction times. Most high level gameplay is prefires and flicks/really good positioning. I would rather see posts about ping abusers, because ping abuse is a much larger problem IMO. Oh and peoples hands blocking headshots, that's also bullshit ubi fix pls. Even hackers are a larger problem, just because they are still really common. Client side debris is also bullshit. My point is that ubi has already announced that they are working on a fix for crouch spamming/lean spamming but all of the other problems that I mentioned have been around for a *very* long time with little-no reaction from ubi

Oh ok.

Don't feel bad over Sandman. Every modern warfare game they cheaply killed off as much main characters they could to "create emotional impact". It was just ridiculous when literally only Price was left in the last one. They could've totally created emotional impact without just killing everyone.

Hello ThaiMylace, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ans2ul/why_do_the_small_issues_take_so_long_to_be_fixed/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
To much for one operator good concepts though
---
Play ranked, you will get to rank where you belong.
---
Casual Is broken
---
I did the exact same thing, except my alt was my walk. You're not alone man. I laughed for a solid half an hour after I figured it out.
---
Ahhh yes. The speed of lag. The only universal unconstant. Determined by the classic equation of: E=MP² where E is the latency, M are the mothers fucked and P is obviously your ping squared. Most famously used by people with "Walmart connections" and poor people.
---
Why does the console update get delayed cause pc is having issues?  
---
The Lord never rests...
---
Siege is *brutal* for new players. You not only have to learn the layouts for the maps, you have to learn the cheeky spots where someone will lay a trap or knock out a murder hole. You have to learn how the operators work, some of which can actively hinder your team if used incorrectly.
---
And then the purported casual mode is a nest of toxicity, with taking and vote kicking being quite common. I think Siege could use a training playlist where under 10s-20s could go. Higher players could come in to mentor, but if they were reported for toxicity they'd be banned from the mode. 
---
Platform?
---
Unlikely to. 
---
I get it. Them players have just as much right to play casual as anyone else, but I just can’t catch a break. Every game is there is a couple of plats and/or some diamonds. 
---
The worse part is they use operators like Ash, twitch, jäger, bandit etc while abusing lean and crouch spamming and very likely using M&amp;K. They constantly run out and abuse that mechanic as well. 
---
Don’t get me wrong. I like the occasional sweaty game but this is just ridiculous. This games needs purely a random matchmaking system for solo casual players, and then a squad matching system for when 2 or 3 diamond players queue up together for casual
---
Oh, so youre frequently called the cancer? Interesting. Wonder why that may be

After 2 weeks of having smooth FPS at 144 constantly this update started varying my statistics from 140-90 everytime. I tried lowering graphic settings but nothing showed improvement.

I’m pretty sure it already does too
---
U/vreddit bot
---
I read BARK HARVEST lol
---
Exactly. 
---
The issue is that they have just as much right to play casual as the people who just wanna chill, but this completely ruins the experience. This is why pick and ban needs to come to all modes in this game, so you can at least rule out one of the cancer operators they’re guaranteed to play

Not going to lie that actually scared me.

I started at the beginning of year three, so a few maps and ops ago, but it really wasn't that bad.  It takes a bit of time, but I just started out by doing the situations (helps a ton as it holds your hand through pretty much all the basics), then a few terrorist hunts, and some reading on the operator page.  Picked 2 on each side that had abilities that seemed like fun, and just started to play.  It took a bit for map knowledge, but I anchored a lot on defense and wandered a bit on attack until things started to come together.  Continuing to just to classic terrorist hunts solo also helped a lot with learning the map.  Honestly, I just think a lot of the people who have exceeding amounts of trouble at the start of this game just want to buy it and jump straight into MP without learning anything about the game
---
I did come into the game with all operators unlocked, so not sure if that actually helped or hindered.
---
Sweet fake clip dude. Way to record on your phone too to crop out the teams at the top to hide the fact that its just you and a friend. 
---
OP is a huge faggot 
---
Yeah because the audio is so important and necessary for showing a new visual feature
---
You know the volume slider exists for a reason, right?
---
#NO! NOT TACHANKINA!
---
not too long ago she was able to yeet cameras too another damn dimension 
---
Doc is a tank so he's very versatile. He can be great while roaming but he's loud and slow so situational awareness is a must. He great for anchoring too, just hold tight angles. He's also the perfect OP for spawn peaks imo
---
I roam as doc. Spawn peek like nuts and just stim myself when I get shot. Can usually waste a minute or get 2-3 kills roaming doc.
---
Don't you think it's about time for an operation health 2?
---
Yeah I just want to get proficient in a couple operators at first to get a handle back on the game before I start using everyone, I can be flexible with Lesion and Rook and stuff like that but I’m looking to improve my game sense before learning many ops
---
Are you actually retarded and need an explanation?
---
Because you're being an ass about it my guy. No one likes an ass.
---
Maybe, now just maybe, he's Iraqi.
---
I think the main issue is that across the different modes (Terrorsit Hunt, Casual and Ranked) the mechanics of the game vary widely. 
---
Terrorist Hunt has you locate and defuse bombs in an order. Casual you cant choose the sites or spawn locations and forming strategies is much less important. In ranked people scream at you for doing to minutest of errors, bomb sites need to be chosen and you must understand which is best to hold, why and what operators to bring. Then there's map knowledge and even though I've racked up +/- 400hrs every time a new map is released I feel paralyzed by lack of knowledge.
---
Yes a lot of these issues are time related but the process can be a lot smoother, for example: universal game modes, would be a much better approach for starting out. 
---
A lot of the knowledge is nuanced and most people in-game arent willing to help you and raise you up.
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
a map in the mines would be like that scene in sicario
---
I think OP was referring to the bullshit title "Rainbow Six Siege Hates New Players".
---
Probably because this looks to be a private lobby and they're testing this. 
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Make yourself a small infirmary room in the objective or nearby.
---
Heal the ones that pass by and shoot attackers in your vicinity. Not hard at all, eh?
---
Challenge everything and peek everything also never heal your team mates just yourself 
---
ubisoft, fix your shit

lmao

OK so kaid's shotgun has been useless on console and the killcam has been broken for 2 months and when we finally get a patch for it the game breaks?  Can't wait for new bugs to be introduced when we finally get the patch

FOUR DRUGS
---
Thanks. I'm glad if even one person gains something out of it. Forcibly making the siege community better one mind at a time Haha. 
---
There’s a skin you can buy for the type 89 that is almost identical so I’ve never understood this legendary 
---
I thought you added patch rollback. Clash is straight up broken and I get half the fps I use to and Pros with 2080Ti and i9 can't even get 144fps
---
Maybe it gets activated when she initiates the Candela. The glasses don't work all the time and only start when Candela is about to be thrown. 
---
At least you were able to see them most of the time I cant even see them before i die.
---
I can’t tell if this is satire or not based on the other replies 
---
I've had that happen as well as not being able to hear a fuze charge go off and hearing the hacked phone.
---
You forgot the /s
---
If you think about it, any movement should reduce accuracy (/ increase spread), and especially any kind of movement that greatly affects the position of the head (leaning, crouching...).
---
You put Bandit in a nightclub and of course he’s gonna find some gear before he claps that ass.
---
Lol context be damned. That's funny 
---
I agree, people should stop filming screens with their phones
---
Are you talking about a skin called ka?
---
Exactly my point. People are complaining about the toxicity in the game but here I am and what I’m getting is “tough shit”.
---
Smoke has left the chat
---
I have that charm haha
---
Fuck it's so annoying to die by but I'll be damned if it isn't funny to watch.
---
I mean, you stand in the doorway and that’s where someone’s gonna pre-fire, you stand down the hall a bit and they get caught by surprise. Except for a cracked out Bandit...
---
That’s how people play Doc bruh also never use him as an anchor roam
---
Because they're concerned it will adversely impact console as well.  Makes sense for them to figure out what the problem is before deploying to consoles.
---
I did..?
---
F
---
Stop trying to argue with idotic toxic kids mate. Its just not worth it. We have already won anyways because Ubi stated that they are going to remove it.
---
I may roam but I’ll at least try to heal other people, I actually like playing supporting roles in most games 
---
This is a 1v1 custom game. Fake af. 
---
Here’s what you have to do. I have 1.5k kills with doc and am willing to help. What you want to do is run mp5 acog and revolver. Also use the shotgun with a holo. Never use the p9. I can’t stress this enough. Spawn peek and always heal as soon as someone is hit.
---
He's not entirely wrong - this game does have a steep learning curve for an FPS, and with that comes players that just don't have the patience to teach newbies on the fly.
---
That being said, this just screams click-bait.
---
Yeah youre right about that. Maybe something like get 40 headshots with  the year 2 operators and then youll get a headgear/uniform for one of those?
---
Breaking news: Games Journalists are bad at video games.  More at 11.
---
now just add "dance till you're dead" onto this and it'll be perfect
---
They’re trying to stop Tai Lung from escaping 
---
Doc is not a support character 
---
True but doesnt change the fact that crouch-/leanspamming is cancerous.
---
As toxic as you guys think Siege is, YOU GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE ASIAN SERVER YET. Oh boy, it's soo rich in toxicity. You become immune to it.
---
Not really im plat 2 tbh. 
---
Played this game since release Dec 2015 and this shit is most annoying to play against. 
---
‘Lol you must be copper’ typical toxic little boy, and frankly there’s nothing wrong with copper players. Stop being a toxic little boy. 
---
The toxicity is quite a problem because people will kick or TK newer players because they don't understand how the game plays
---
yes please !! ubi should really fix the crouching, maybe adjust it to how it is in csgo 
---
Not lying but ok, If you want an example of a game ingrained Toxicity, try League of Legends
---
I thought it would look better without the face, the idea was to simplify the image
---
Are you telling me I can dodge bullets?
---
Apparently it makes the sound travel louder through the reinforcements. But I don't know if someone tested it 
---
I read that in the tone of a CSI Miami opener where you pull your sunglasses off and look into the camera 
---
It’s like the League of Legends perk LOL
---
Custom game?
---
Rule of the game here is simple, these people do not know defeat because their only win condition is to push people off. I thank you for trying to be the bigger man. Unfortunate these people enjoy your frustration. 
---
Absolute dickhole of a human being
---
Like the one guy said, sound travels through it better.
---
God damnit, bandit got in the evidence locker again. 
---
Just write Ni gger the text filter only notices the "nig"
---
They should have Doki go through their code and clean it up for them 
---
Firstly why are you randomly putting shit in quotes "i have both platforms" "although i dont play it" make no sense in quotes
---
Secondly Fortnite can update weekly because its an early access title so isnt bound to the update constraints of fully released games, those have to deliver the patch to Sony/MS first and let them test it before they OK an actual release of said patch, Fortnite being early release still means it can just update without going thru that process
---
And Black Ops might have had more updates(which I doubt) but the content of said patches pales in comparison to the patches R6 puts out
---
As a console player myself I dont feel cheated or left behind, they already said they were moving away from mid season reinforcements so thats gonna reduce the number of patches received anyway
---
Lean/crouch spam if you use Blitz and always main Caveira or Clash.
---
Granted, everyone posts their greatest moments on Reddit/Youtube and I find that although some people are insane at this game, it's not always like that.
---
Get used to playing Bomb 24/7, my squad pretty much exclusively plays that, and teamwork and communication is significantly more important on PC. Not to say that is wasn't on Xbox, but I find team composition and good callouts make or break rounds more often then not on PC.
---
Rainbow Six Siege HATES him! See how this new player went from unranked to bronze 2 in 10 simple games
---
Gold 4 is average. Gold 1 and higher is considered “Good”.
---
What’s wrong with Ela, Monty boy

I'm new. Shot the hostage by accident few times now I'm banned.
---
oh ok 
---
Better sound travel 
---
My literal first casual match I chose Mira because I had found a few spots for her on Youtube, and someone said he wanted to play her, but he chose someone else before I did. He teamkilled me every round and called me a "useless shitter faggot." 
---
Nah what I’m saying is specifically Blackbeard has fairly  bad guns because his fire rate is as fast as the people who play him think.
---
Soynd pretty much like my problem
---
I’m not sure about the fuse time, as the other guy mentioned, but the third light allows the candela to roll along the ground. So maybe each light is a longer roll. She can also place them on soft walls and floors, similar to Fuze.
---
I usually play bomb or hostage on console anyways. It's not a new thing, but PC may be a little difference. 
---
Yeah I guess you're right, people only post good things and leave their potatoing out.
---
How do u even do that? I've never even seen it that bad
---
Sound pretty much like my problem
---
Yings gadget can also be deployed on a soft wall/window/door, exactly like Fuze's cluster charge. Deploying them on the other side. She can also hold down her gadget button to extend the timer so that she can roll her gadgets under doors or in drone holes
---
Hello There!
---
why is the holo sight thick again?
---
Amazing!
---
What points do you want addressed? Np matter what they say the community tears them apart bc "they know better"
---
They cant just release patches as they please on console they have to follow the same guidelines as every other game, except Fortnite and other Early Access titles bc they get around that, so instead of just sending out a bunch of little patches like they can on PC they bundle everything together into 1or 2 big ones
---
Learn about ping and peekers advantage
---
Theres a reason Fortnite can update daily/weekly and R6 cant
---
Yea Im gold (is 1 elo into gold 4)
---
&gt;Theres a reason Cancer can update daily/weekly and R6 cant

I’m pretty sure casual has a ranking system but it’s just hidden. I’m lvl 187 and I only play against plays and lvl 200+. I mean technically it makes sense
---
Maybe change it something like those sound grenades (don't hate me I just didn't play enough to knwo all the names) from CSGO so it's more situational than just, oh let's block this rotation for the defenders for the whole game
---
I did the same thing, dont worry so much about you what you already know but practice your aim and think of strategies in online matches. Just see what you like and find what suites you best.
---
Yeah I'm done with this bullshit for a while. 
---
PL?
---
Everyone despises new Hereford...
---
It's obvious use of a macro. The fix is not as easy so it has to be hardwired into the game code to detect use of macros. Banning people for pressing the series of keys in an inhuman manner would be a hotfix that would be quite appreciated by some but a full on ban might be too harsh. 
---
Unfortunately I use a gamepad so if they were to ban macro use in game I would be out of luck due to having a semi disabled hand that makes crouching hard for me due to my dead finger.  I dont use macros but the gamepad would possibly make it look like I was. 
---
The one underaged player would be banned until his 18th birthday. Than he is unbanned. I don't know if the whole team gets penalized, but i think the match is going to be a free win for your enemy when they protest. 
---
Maybe just TRY cropping the photo

lmaooo I'll never get how people will just straight up play Siege or any other game in their family rooms while their whole family is just right behind them having a BLAST watching TV or something. I feel for folks that have smaller spaces or whatever the situation is.
---
Welp now they know you play with someone under 18
---
I just don’t like global abilities , they require no skill and are just a push of a button . That’s my opinion tho.
---
I'm asking for a friend ;) 
---
I’m just saying that was dumb; winrate isn’t dependent on player skill
---
That actually not true. Casual is not as sweaty as Ranked, but way sweatier. All jokes aside, this game is so toxic to the point where I've taken a break from play for about a month now. GG gamers, I'll play once it's fixed. S.I. looks fun but still. 
---
Yes they could for a bit then XIM pushed out an update and it was undetectable again and also lead to a bunch of false bans 
---
Right i see, thanks for the info.
---
Ah right mb
---
This is honestly at its truest form. 
---
Fuck I hate bots, smarter plays will reward. If people crouch spam just stop fucking holding an angle until they peek you. Then maybe you’ll get out of gold
---
Save your twitch drones, move them slowly and do not taze ennemies. It will get them destroyed and then you'll have no utility left. 
---
Spill the secret how you know its detectable and every game developer out there says it isnt
---

Don't you think that whole operation was a waste of time? The amount of resources they put into it, the new models and textures they had to make. New animations and everything. All that work, which is way more that goes into a regular season. It was actually pretty ok and fun. Just to sack it off and be done with it...
---
Haha yeah
---
Badbot
---
Sorry bud but this is staged. One, you didn’t even shoot and he knew exactly where you were. Two, the camera shake revealed you had no teammates leading me to believe this is a custom game. 
---
And that somehow makes this a not broken mechanic?
---
Jäger going to harvest some Acogs
---
mira?! source, please
---
Maybe two years ago 
---
Yes but you can do that without sounding like a total cock.
---
I just got invited to a party, sorry about it. Thanks for the offer tho!
---
Casual always pits new players against diamonds/plats, so it's understandable that a new player would rainbow as unforgiving and inaccessable.  
---
I'm down, just hit me up on steam, ill pm u the name
---
Maybe gold 2 is too high for you 😂
---
I appreciate that Ash was the one that died this time around. Though I suspect that you tried this with Ash first, but she never appeared on screen before you died.
---
Here we go again, Pengu you have to FOCUS for the invitationals...
---
Okay, I don't know about anyone else but I love Cavi, she is my favorite op with over like 62+ hours played with her, along with Mira. Anyway, my point is, I know a thing or two about her. First of all, her load-out is based on either killing or opening stuff. My favorite load-out is her shotgun, no sight, no laser. Then with her pistol, I put on a laser with no cross-hairs (the reason behind this is purely because it helps me see my enemy better, I don't know why) but sometimes when I need my cross-hairs, I will turn them back on next round just in case. Then I always take impacts, she is meant to roam freely, not stare at a camera waiting for someone. Secondly, as soon as the round starts, open as many hatches as you can unless it's directly above sight. If it is directly above sight, reinforce it. But open up any and all hatches you come across. For example, let me give you a scenario. Let's say it's bomb on coastline and you spawn in Sunrise/Blue Room. The first thing you wanna do is reinforce any walls, but not the hatch in Sunrise/Hookah or the hatch in office. On this sight having as many hatches for quick and easy access is best case scenario. So you wanna open up the hatch in office, main lobby, security room, and sunrise with her shotgun, you can usually do this with only one mag but it'll take some practice to get that one-shot hatch-destroy. Then with the impact you wanna open up a rotation hole between Sunrise and Blue, and the other impact you can use for another good rotation hole somewhere else but I usually try to save an impact in case I run into an attacker and throw it at them or wait until I fight one and need to escape or something of that sort, so save one in case. Third tip, always be moving, listen closely for any sign of attackers opening something up, but be quick. Let's say you run into a Blackbeard and happen to lose some damage as well as deal some damage but lose the fight, relocate but relocate fast. Be unpredictable and use your environment to your advantage. Any other questions just ask, I would love to help out a fellow Cav main.

Just get better

I used Alt for Years in CSGO to crouch, it just felt more natural to me. 
---
As for the F4, my mouse already had F4 assigned to a button (for whatever reason), so when I assigned my mouse button in siege, it recognised it as F4 and not a mouse button.
---
U misspel peek
---
That’s the most annoying thing is this game rn but why are you holding that angle in the middle of the hallway 
---
No face? What are you Amish lmao
---
A more built up section of the mine would have support walls and such. If it was some open pit thing as well, you could have a full on temporary structure .
---
I disagree, if you play smart that doesn't matter 
---
his shield would cover all 5 heads
---
At least it's sorted now! It took me about a week to recognise the issue and what's more embarrassing, is that I build PCs regularly, so I should have known better!
---
*also has a kaid on his team*
---
BOY that looks EBIC
---
The second one
---
Capitao
---
Yah, if "good" is equated to binding crouch and qe to your mouse, then spamming them while your aim is barely affected.... Then yah, "if you're good enough" is an applicable statement.
---
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to sort of, disagree with you there.
---
Spamming buttons doesn't make you good. It isn't skillful. 
---
Positioning and communication are what make you good at this game, second to those comes being an aimer. 
---
Q E crouch spamming is just abusing a poorly implemented game mechanic. Which is why ubi is looking into improving it.
---
Nah, a bullet in the head is a bullet in the head and siege is supposed to be a tactical shooter apex is the opposite and this would make siege even more of a run and gun.
---
Just find people on discord insteD
---
And distance 
---
In real life all wood breaks differently, that might not be why they do it, but it's more realistic in a way. 
---
Hello NutPeak, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/antptc/weird_issue_that_ill_do_a_zoom_in_animation_twice/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Pengu needs to STFU or play a different fucking game. He's making hella money off of siege and all he fucking does is complain. 
---
I think it promotes movement to favor the attacker. Otherwise defenders would never lose a choke. Defenders have the advantage of setting up and having line of sight on a doorway where you know the enemy has to come from. The attacker has to push through that choke and locate and kill you and any other potential enemies it only makes sense that they receive an advantage. 
---
What is this angle you're holding. You're just in the middle of the hall
---
I dont think anyone would be ignorant enough to *try* to kidnap tachanka's daughter. 
---
I can verify this. If you go to the R6S Discord and type "new players" in any channel, everyone there will instantly fly into a blind rage, foam at the mouth, chant in tongues, summon the antichrist, and bring forth the apocalypse.
---
^^^/s
---
Probably around 220,230
---
i feel for your suicide but for me the highlight of this post was that rappel , almost 2k hours in this game and never though of doing that , really cool.
---
i was kicked from almost every game when i started to play. how are people suposed to learn if they cant even finish a fuckin match?
---
You didnt even shoot hello? He would have killed you regardless of him spamming shit. This is what I mean, excuses
---
They should have a pouch that holds their gadgets.
---
 A gun range will be epic i love to switch ops and its hard to track recoil and such 
---
What saddens me the most about this is I went into searching everyone up expecting to see that they queued with a bronze or something to get easy games... But nope. They didn't have to take advantage if the system in any way whatsoever. It all goes on the fact that the current matchmaking system is a complete joke that thinks it's completely ok for all golds to go against diamonds.
---
No it would remove the some of the skill of rainbow if you could just run in and spray targets down and not die from a headshot it would also make the defenders worst as there weapons are less powerful and if they can one shot head shot and they attackers can it would be stupid 
---
The best part is the replay when it shows the person coming around the corner 10 seconds ago and taking their time to line up and kill you. 
---
I always think Candela’s flash is in extremely short burst, synchronized with her goggle.  
---
Her goggle is some sort of electronic dimming device, capable of rendering itself completely dark for a split second. This is how some 3D classes/tv combo works.  
---
This can explain why she can be immune to her own flash but not others.  
---
So Blackbeard is meta?
---
/s
---
This is exactly why I stopped playing for awhile
---
I started it just before wind bastion. I think it's great. Sure it took me a bit of time before I started doing good, but I think the learning process is pretty fast and fun. I think that playing with and against people better than you is vital to improving. So yeah, spawnpeakers were annoying but I learnt to avoid it fast.
---
I would say it's hard to catchup the renown. I wish I'd picked the complete edition on sale. £30 for the game plus all ops is decent.
---
These things take time. It's not like a bug where they find a fix the code. They have to design a new feature and implement it and then test it. 
---
If you’re toxic and tk the siege gods will never bless you with an ace
---
Considering you’ve probably never played a game without the net code like this I have to say that you are making assumptions about how the game would play out. 
---
Bad idea Pengu. You can’t just remove the main center point gunplay mechanic 
---
This is such a weird comment what the hell
---
Typical buck main would kill himself with the granade.
---
Swiggity swoogity
---
Dammit I was gonna say this 
---
Definitely that would be amazing
---
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
---
I know you can't control yourself any longer
---
The peeker's advantage is amplified because they're head is essentially teleporting whereas normally they move in, so by the time they see you you are starting to see them, so it kind of equals out if you're holding  a hard angle, but with this they see you and you can't see them for longer since they're essentially teleporting their head around. 
---
It does promote it but it's a consequence of latency and the way the game handles it, not an incentive for attackers. 
---
I'll be back
---
I fucking hate crouch spammers 
---
It's a glitch with the grenade, moderately common. When you did that cute little grenade pull cancel the game continued to tick the grenade. Stupid bug, but it's existed for a long time.
---
I believe there ia a new event coming, there was a leak that it would be named fallout or something like that. But what it would be is unknown, maybe same thing as outbreak this time but with terrorists instead of zombies.
---
Exactly. He looks to the left, then turns forward and vaults, then turns back after the vault. So while he’s going through the window he’s not facing the valk. He turns back afterwards but especially if his ping is high he will have not turned back fully yet. It’s like when you peak around a door and stop and you can’t see any part of the person that, in the replay, saw half your body and shot you in the head.
---
Read somewhere saying they’re looking into limiting crouch spamming 
---
How did this only become a problem over the past few weeks? Why was no one complaining before?
---
Welcome to the subreddit, where nobody knows what they really want! Good luck! :\~\]
---
By no means do I think they can’t do more. I agree that a few more things can be added.
---
I thought maybe we could see something like
---
- all operators available in terrorist hunt but only purchased operators award renown
---
- new operators come with 1hr trial of playtime (only active when using the operator) in terrorist hunt and casual only
---
A lot of things are out there for new players to benefit from, but at a certain point it’s out of Ubi’s hands and up to the determination of the player. Siege’s learning curve shouldn’t be expected to look just like another FPS. So much of the reward from playing comes from outsmarting your opponents rather than simply outgunning them.
---
Different resources. Companies are able to do two things at once. Adding a quick animation they’ve been meaning to add is simple. Working on a fluid solution to crouch spam takes a little longer, and it’s only been a REAL issue for a short while.
---
This is how I imagine the U.S. Navy Seals killed Osama Bin Laden 
---
Well C9 don't have an active R6 team and no plans to pick up any teams in the foreseeable future, so it ain't them, chief. 
---
G2 is like the final boss of R6, they are great at adapting after bad rounds.
---
Drowning in all that drip
---
Yea I guess that makes sense. Dupes should probably also be changed tbh. ~5,000 renown from a Legendary dupe feels kinda low considering how rare Legendaries truly are.
---
Clearly outplayed by someone with a great gaming chair
---
Im sorry but as soon as I would see him go up the ladder I would have shot him
---
Probably the Ump45 for Castle/Pulse.
---
All it would take is a 1 - 1.5 second buffer to crouch and lean. Maybe we'll see it in a few years when Ubisoft decides to do something about it.
---
Its not hard to make a new account. You clearly missed the point of this post so you can stop now. 
---
This may shed some light on this problem. Last night my 4 stack played a couple games without issue and then randomly while searching the squad just gets broken up and kicks everyone. We send out the invites and now the party leader can’t start a search. The problem was it put us all in a game and then had an error or something that kept us in the menu. Only after we all restarted the game and reloaded it would let us rejoin that old match. Problem is it was 1v5 for all of that time and we join 0-3 mid round, lose and get a 15 abandon penalty. Well played Ubisoft, well played...
---
Evil geniuses, no question
---
I remember when I first started playing Siege, it would happen often since I would do Alt + Enter pretty often.  Make sure you are and full screen and you might want to play on a different setting of graphics.
---
hopefully communication will get better, it has been pretty bad over the last months...
---
add toe.eatr
---
i play pc
---
To each their own
---
I agree that I'd like to see a buff to the renown granted from duplicates.
---
Saw someone doing this last night on my team. It took a lot of will power not to team kill them...
---
Welcome =) 
---
Alright thanks 
---
Considering there is no Cloud9 now... 
---
But EG is and always was better anyways 
---
How do they even do this? With hacks or what?
---
Hello RkhamKnight, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/anum4d/sound_bug_please_help/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Ironically happened to ash

I like how the gun moves when that happens

Oooh shit..

Congrats and I look forward to seeing you around the community! :) 
---
When you don’t shoot out the cam
---
That’s cool
---
that is super cute
---
If it's not a bug then it's either an unintended design they should be addressing promptly or shitty design by some idiot in the office
---
Ubi will say it’s because ranked is in beta
---
He’s streaming right now. Someone should tell him about this post. 
---
in that bond movie, Live and Let Die, the end action sequence happens in a mine, because the big baddie is going to detonate a nuclear device that will set off a seismic event and flood silicon valley with water.  
---
Why is this a thing?
---
this was just “cringe to the max” to watch christ
---
Hey, don't worry man, I'm still pissed about it too! I was in that game with you...
---
Lol, I have proof it does:
---
My own gameplay.
---
Yet again you proceed to name call. Congrats man congrats. At this point you don't even sound old enough to play the game as if you were of any age older than 16 you'd be smart enough not to be an idiot and keep coming back again and again. Do you not understand you're creating a little cycle that ends up not working every time you make a response right? You're literally just neglecting the fact that this is a a good thing to think about. Having a system be based upon skill which the game is based off of is a good idea. Random chance isn't. I enjoy the game most of the time. But when one part likes to fuck you over and screw you in some cases that isn't game feature. Calm down and actually think when you speak because you literally sounding like you can't even comprehend why I made the damn post in the first place.
---
Welcome

“Those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it” I’m saying that I think that people who look for symbolism in things that aren’t  related it at all are dumb as fuck We should work make ourselves better than what our ancestors were But a lot of the far left and right idiots want to keep bringing race in to it what difference does it make if I’m white or black I mean seriously WTF 
---
I laughed quite a bit
---
Why
---
right! got a duplicate charm. 25,000 renown points to buy, game gave me 1,150... sure. lol would rather gift it to a friend for that price. Or eliminate duplicates from the alpha packs altogether 
---
Isn't this from a COD? Like MW?
---
I love that because if you pull the pin on a frag its unlikely you can cram the pin back in place before it blows.
---
Noice to meet you, to meet you Noice.
---
Any news on the delayed Console patch for the mid season update??
---
[VTK 1 of 4]

...as is the traditional greeting in Siege.
---
Welcome to being a Ubisoft overlord! May your rule be merciful and just.

Reminds me of the characters in the game Ashen.
---
Who else had to watch this again to understand what was happening
---
r6 radios ubi cakes whats next

These are the same people who said Destiny was officially dead.

They need to quit video game journalism. My buddy just started playing last month, and he loves it.

Obviously you didn’t buy enough R6 credits

Sorry!! I keep forgetting it's on the consoles as well! fixed!

Ahhh yes, gives me something to listen to while I’m bleeding out on a frost mat, and it’s educational!
---
I see blackbeard
---

---
Didn't call him retarded in that post so congratulations on reading. I'm happy you passed the first grade. And no I don't hate the game just some parts I really do. One being the random chance system that isn't fair towards anyone or anything and needs to be replaced with something actually meaningful like a system of skill. I don't understand why people like you and Zman don't get that. This would actually benefit everyone. Also last sentence of yours should be, "Let us enjoy it AND play it" But this doesn't conflict with any of our gameplay features as it's a system for a pack not a game play feature. This doesn't harm you and your shitty tactics. Okay?
---
welcome &gt;:s

I started playing Siege around Operation White noise, and I was addicted right away. My first online game I played was Halo 3 when I was a kid, because my parents got an xbox 360 for the family that year, and I had many siblings, so we usually played split-screen. I got pretty good at it, and I wanted to have a real challenge. I decided to use a gold membership card that I got with the game, and played an online match. Much to my surprise, I got fuckin rekt, and you know what? That unlocked a door for me. It was as if I was seeing an entire world I have never seen before. I would pour hours into multiplayer, and I started getting better. I decided to start playing Modern Warfare online as well. I would just get punished for not knowing the maps, guns, recoil, sensitivity, and I was immediately hooked. Getting attachments for guns, working for that next gun skin, getting killstreaks, and all the other dopamine induced factors that make you want to keep playing just fascinated me. Finally, I decided to try out rainbow six, because a girlfriend I had used to play it all the time, and I was curious about it. Loaded into my first match, and I got fucking destroyed over, and over, and over again. People you getting headshots off  of me, because I would walk into a room like I was playing a run and gun game. I would potato like a moron, because I wasn't used to playing games without aim assist. The funny part is, I got addicted, and it was sweet nostalgia all the way back to that memory of playing halo 3 online for the first time. I fucking loved it, and I just started putting as much time as I could into it. I would watch how someone killed me, because I knew I would only learn if I watched people who were really good at the game. I went from placing in low silver, to high gold within 6 months. If you get frustrated, because you're bad at something new, or because you keep getting killed, then I would stay far away from this game. If you appreciate a learning curve, and you look at failures as opportunities to be better next time, then this game is for you. Don't listen to what I have to say, or even what a dumb article says. Play the game for yourself, and decide whether or not you like it.
---
That's it, let's put in crouch &amp; lean charges with limit 5 each per round!! /s
---
Jesus fuckin Christ XD
---
I also got the hemorrhage skin for one of Lions guns and I love it 
---
"I like to think R6 is based off realism"
---
It's not a realistic game at all and there's nothing wrong with that. It's an amazing game for what it is. 
---
Yes, but again all the walls would be stone that wouldn’t be breachable, and mines don’t tend to share thin walls with other parts of itself 
---
Even if the ping delay was non existant peelers advantage is still a thing. The peeker is ready and expecting someone to be there, therefore is more primed to shoot than the defender, who might've been watching that angle for some time now, and has no idea when someone will peak.
---
Yes
---
Black ice for the g36c. Youll wnat to die
---
I saw some came with the outbreak packs , how does that work? I know that thing was a past event that’s no longer in session.
---
Do you get any extra  golden ticket points for unlocking new characters too? Or just the renown credits?
---
What a fucking dick
---
people like this is ehy we can't have fun in video games
---
What happens if you pull out a candela then walk into an ela mine or get hit by an echo drone? Do they still have full effect?
---
On the latest siege video of his he said that the games is really fun but it makes him so mad
---
While you are picking it is loading assets.
---
I got this as my first legendary ever! Pretty happy with it. :)
---
That’s pretty cool
---
From a realism standpoint, it doesn't make sense. Defibrillators don't restart the heart. That's pure Hollywood. They're used for arrhythmia to return the heart to an appropriate rhythm. 
---
Hopefully they do a 100%+ renown day
---
too frag? is that a mis-spelling of top frag? because i feel like when you call your own team shit, your position on the scoreboard is irrelevant, you're toxic no matter what if you do shit like that.
---
So little whiners can ban people now?
---
Oh jeez that got me scared for a moment. I thought Kalyrical is going to be a mumble rapper that will participate in a R6:Siege ad campaign. Welcome to the wild life reservation. 
---
i started playing one year after launch and yeah thats true, its really hard for new players either you get used to or die trying
---
Maybe in alpha packs
---
Later this week, it was causing issues on PC so they delayed it, but it doesn’t seem to affect console, so they’ll announce when we get probably tomorrow.
---
I play both of them very much. Pulse is my favorite operator in the entire game. I would say if you are going to play within a team and give lots of callouts, Pulse is the way to go as his gadget works best within team composition. Bandit is a good solo play operator as in he has a good gun and you can place your utility down and go amongst your business. 
---
🤯
---
I got the universal skin on my main and my alt account lol
---
Didn’t read the article but I have to agree. I’ve been playing for about a month now and I can’t tell you how many “go back to Minecraft” messages I’ve gotten. But I’m kicking ass on it now so they’ve stfu.
---
Because Siege is a unique game with great potential that has completely turned to shit by greedy publisher and incompetent developers. 
---
*Smoke main intensifies*
---
Me too bro
---
No
---
wtf is that music
---
Its vigils skin lol
---
anyone know who they are picking up?
---
It looks like Attack on Titan
---
Nope. EFT has some realistic elements, but it's as much arcade shooter as Siege is.
---
Alright thanks man so I'll keep a lookout for the update
---
Co za kurwa
---
That's my favorite feature, what needs fixed is the client side debris.
---
Wow. That is beyond petty. Hope your internet issues get turned around and that guy stubs his toe every day for the rest of his life.
---
He really shouldn't take his "Mute" cosplaying that seriously. 
---
They need to add an Operator with an explosive drone along with a mine map
---
Villa is so damn fun.
---
I hate crouch spamming
---
But I didn't even know it did damage until I saw this
---
Metro?
---
This is so far my biggest problem by far with Apex. Looks and feels so dumb when your opponents in every close range firefight spend 70% of it with their feet off the ground. I don't know why devs dont expand your crosshair to the size of the sun like it actually would be if you were bouncing around like a crackhead on a pogostick in the middle of a firefight.

Fuck you 😭

The only difference is that one of the Jägers is electric.

Every *throwable* gadget (not drones) does 5 points of damage on collision.

Don’t they usually release it at the beginning of the year? 
---
I can't believe this guy's still relevant at all. Just because he was some big player. The guy is an absolute narcissistic idiot..

This tweet is fucking stupid. It's one of the main gimmicks that makes this game what it is.

God I hate it so much but i can’t help but giggle when i see it. It looks so god damn ridiculous 
---
How so?
---
Choose your gunfights, dont be scared to send it the other way. Make sure your presence is known to keep the other team on edge. Dont play incredibly aggresive
---
No, she shouldnt be a special snow flake
---
He got problem with foking everything. 
---
Gtfo. If you would have said its not 100% realistic i would agree. No game is 100% realistic because it would not be enjoyable. But you can't say its on par with siege for lack of realism. That's like saying flight simulator is the same as gta 5 flying
---
Why not
---
Not to be a dickhead, but were you playing with an arcade joystick?
---
The same reazon they are reworking cav's gun, consistency

ahh yes nothing better to start the day then a good quote

Didn’t know that worked, thanks for the tip

Same. My first instinct in this game is to shoot. 
---
Wait why did your brother spit on him? 
---
I know that every time I get shot in the head out in the real world I'm operating at about 50% for the rest of the day.
---
I stopped playing for a while cause of that too! It’s so dumb. 
---
damn this is awesome! any proof this is real?
---
Arrogant player bitching about everything of Siege
---
Well, guess what? [3 armors should survive headshots, then.](https://youtu.be/W0yY4DCShog?t=19)
---
Ok just finish this ranked. You have 4 guys?
---
Realistic, aint it?
---
this looks so cool, any proof this is all real?
---
Wow so the dumbass complains about not being able to buy the year 1 and 2 season passes? no fucking shit you cant because its not those years anymore. the operator bundles are also $20 in game, not $30 like he stated. Already I can't take this article seriously. 
---
So this sub now is just circlejerking over "G2 PENGU DUMB!!!!" or what?
---
" agreed, he bitchs about everything siege has." OP, grow the fuck up. Why do you care?
---
Nope, alone unfortunately. Will put up a post on r6teams tho! 
---
Why‘d use a pencil?
---
Why do it yourself when robots do it better?
---
It's my own creation, not a leak.
---
Go ask on r/pcmasterrace
---
The one shot headshot mechanic is a core feature of the game. It separates it from other shooters. Besides that, Ubisoft needs to focus on fixing what's actually wrong with the game before they even look at something as big as this. I'm actually very surprised someone like Pengu would think this. Do people who play Siege that much really not understand the game?
---
Suicide by words
---
I play pc but I would assume they do it to have an advantage. A pretty major advantage 
---
I can't bring my yokai to class unfortunately :)
---
For a sec, thought the next Australian operator name is Kalyrical.
---
when will this get released? 
---
Some stuff for my main? Nice!
---
A hero as always
---
NEVER take out a nade and immediately switch back to your weapon, this will happen 99% of the time.
---
isn't this a bit like castle tho? this is like the strong version of castle 
---
Probably because they're not good enough to win in a fair match.
---
yea my bad I forgot to add that I meant if I rebuy  it through UPlay
---
Mud rank -10?
---
Speakers on big speaker pole 
---
Mostly every new player I encountered is also really toxic so...
---
Not usually my sort of thing this but well done man. Quality job
---
F in the chat
---
that’s true, i agree, but quite a bit of operators in the game have helmets, like doc and bandits for example are strikingly similar. it is clear though that the intentions of these helmets added into the game were purely for the looks/accessory/whatever, otherwise pengus idea of a new headshot mechanic would’ve been a part of siege a lonnnggg time ago. and besides, like that guy said, we do unfortunately have blackbeard, so siege basically already has what pengu wishes for. 
---
Honestly couldn't disagree with him more. This is exactly how you break the game.
---
Is mentor a euphemism for booster? Im tryin to hit plat, how can we do that? 
---
TBH it gets worse the higher you go. IMO the most toxic ranks are Gold1/Plat3 and Plat1/Diamond. There is a sizable portion of people stuck there, who try every shitty thing possible to win the game. 3/4 of the games that I played on both of these "levels of play" consisted of constant QEC spam and/or lion-dokka-blitz-blackbeard-ying combo (either 3 or more of them). And the other 1/4 is frequently skilled and very aggressive Ash/Acog-mains, who are pretty hard to deal with (with how I play, at least) even if they are playing completely solo. 
---
I've had [this](https://streamable.com/7pc7f) happen. Not sure if it was hit detection or a misalignment between the highlighted player model and the hitbox that caused it. (No lag, as you can see I didn't have any of the lag indicator icons.)
---
(Sorry about the poor quality, for some reason the game automatically set itself to a downscaled res by default and this happened before I realized it.)
---
Welcome to the community!! 
---
(aaa its so cool to see developers on here!!  I haven't nessecarily decided what occupation I want to go into yet, but it would be so cool to do something with a art/math degree while working for Ubisoft! I've grown up with their titles )
---
Agreed you could ask the people I play with. Shoot first Blake them second 
---
lol you did great!
---
Guardian can only reinfor e windows, not doors and he/she has to use both reinforcements to close a large window.
---
Bring back Jäger ACOG
---
As a mute main this would be lit, but I feel like it would be like the scrambler perk on COD.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Has he played black ops 4? 1.1x headshot dmg muktiplier is the most retarded shit ever
---
u/childishlemonade
---
Watch out Alibi!!!
---
Sub zero?
---
Is it any big pole or just one (Away from PS4 so I can't check), btw Happy Cake day.
---
Thanks!
---
Ew. **EW**
---
The darks side of r/rainbow6 
---
I’ve had it happen with Clash and Echo so I’m not sure if its an issue with everyone or if I just barely missed.
---
I play on console and PC, and Kaid's Shotgun has a ton of recoil even on PC.
---
Well it's not going to be the Australian operators that I keep believe that we are getting.
---
Holy shit pretty sure you could read the whole Harry Potter series quicker than that
---
This is getting so many dislikes and idc
---
Heyo
---
And i thought I came up with it first
---
I can get you max prestige for 1600 MSP just join my party
---
Just get better and tsp they're head
---
hoooo
---
Obviously it’s a cross-over event with Stranger Things.
---
You find "defusing" quite confusing - I find that quite amusing...
---
I dont mean to be an ass or anything but pls stop
---
I mean they are communist...
---
Go Irish baby
---
Yeah I agree, you do need to fix your video quality.
---
Yeah but when you think about it even if you see someone on the sonar its tough figurin out where they really are 
---
It was pure luck. The enemies all came through the same window on that one map that has a open fireplace on the  objective ( I'm bad at remembering map names) and I had thrown a yokai in there 
---
I was wondering the same thing 
---
It’s interesting and I’ve never seen someone with one 
---
Yeah true
---
Yeah, exactly what i had in mind
---
Why don’t they just add a one second/ half a second delay between the time you can crouch? 
---

I always get crap luck. I’ve had too many 4Ks to count at this point, but I never can get the ace
---
lol it was a recording of a recording because my computer is in maintenance
---
 Think of how much harder it would be to kill someone. Every game the attackers would rush.
---
 Fucking dumb cunt. Further down the tweet comments he talks about worse player favoured mechanics. Theres no such thing as that. Theyre just mechanics in a game. I stopped watching king george cause of the amount of bitching he does when he dies, not gonna watch pengu anymore either. Snake is more fun to watch and has music. Hes like a mahvel movie while everyone else is DC. Macy is the batman trilogy so he is still good
---
His laugh sounds like Matt Damon sobbing.
---
The only thing is how fast you can kill someone in this game. They could crouch/lean spam for even a quarter of a second and you could still kill the other person 
---
No. You can't pick and choose. They both abuse peekers advantage and bad hit reg to win gunfights in a game that's supposed to be about strategy and positioning. 
---
I agree. Though I don't think it's THAT important. Apex is a high TTK shooter, shouldn't compare to it. That's like saying HALO doesn't have 1 shot kills except for Snipers. Well duh?
---
The wallpaper? 😂
---
The whole "turning it around" works both ways, if you get shot in the body twice from behind you may be lucky enough to turn around and one-shot headshot your attacker.
---
I game at Ultra 4k 60fps so the HD texture pack looks amazing on my PC. Watch some videos online comparing the differences. They change the landscape on some maps. Of course it's better to game at a higher fps but if your PC can handle it then why not? It's free..  
---
Well this shows you did a very good job aha
---
What buck skin is that?
---
Look into Hibanna,Buck,and Frost! Hibanna has a good amount of recoil that goes up a ways and to the right. Buck has a little bit of recoils but is a great breacher and Frost has little recoil with her 9mm C1 and her Traps  are annoying 
---
hah. He used the measurements that people who didn't put a man on the moon use.
---
I guess we have wildly different ideas about what is interesting.
---
Villa I think.
---
They saw NEGAtive I guess.
---
Lol he's only asking for other peoples' opinions and y'all are attacking him like he has the final say in this decision.
---
But when you get 5k with spawn peek, then you have spawn peAked.
---
And I have legitimately spawn peAked in my life before back in R6 Raven Shield days in a map called "Peak".
---

---
I guess 🤷‍♂️ 
---
I don't think pro league players get that much money. I remember King George estimating a while back that maybe the richest teams were getting only 2k per month salary, if that.
---
Streaming is most definitely giving him more but R6 is not CSGO/Dota/LoL money where pros get anywhere from 10-100k per month. I think if r6 keeps growing though it will eventually get close.
---
Lol I was just joking hope I didn't come off as rude
---
Banning someone for spamming crouch even if an exploit would be dumb as hell.
---
Yeah, just took a while lol
---
Oh boy you should go take a look at the Battlefield V sub lol
---
questionable title
---
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Buck was floating for a good few seconds 
---
r/notinteresting
---
Oof, sucks to hear that man, I hope you get an ace soon!
---
If you want game play like Apex in an actual death match shooter, you have Halo, just gotta wait for the PC release though...
---
doc the doctor, you may want to set and appointment for him. He absolutely had a stroke.
---
r/dontbeadick
---
Random superhero analogs engaged!! Lol love it
---
Fuck off ying 
---
Yeah probably
---
That's a good story right there! Did you win?
---
I'm trying to heal him
---
Don’t like the mechanic that is the basis I for the whole game. Don’t play it
---
R6 was a much smaller game back when King George played in pro league. And now R6 is a HUGE title right now so I'm assuming that Pengu gets more than 2k a month from pro league.
---
I like this sight better, fuck that triangle green sharpie bullshit.
---
I hate that the enemy team has guns and explosives. Pengu says the dumbest shit sometimes and if you disagree with him he'll give you the "you're a brain dead player you don't know what you're talking about" i've seen him do it to people in his stream. just let him express his opinion nothing will come out of it.
---
:(
---
Deleting thins comment so I don't have a -12 comment
---
I thought the title said nerfed again
---
I think its be cool if i only detected them while the were moving un-crouched.
---
Granted , in the tweet people who say no to him get an ear full and get shot down were as people who agree get praise , not really asking for opinions imo 
---
I ALMOST agree with him, but if you can hit your headshot before the enemy can, you earned the kill.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks!
---
Game still crashing from something as simple as checking my teammates by pressing tab. 
---
It sounds logical, kind of, most helmets will block pistol rounds, though if this was implemented it would cause issues where half of the head would be invulnerable while others are an insta-kill.
---
Add me loner.boner on now
