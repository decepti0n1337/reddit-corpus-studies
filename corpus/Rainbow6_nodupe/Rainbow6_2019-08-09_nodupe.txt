Thank you for the Reply man :)

Ah ok cool

So he‚Äôs fully shielded if he‚Äôs prone?

Ahhh toxicity, the thing that will kill Siege, at least before Ubisoft does which will likely be next year at least. Especially for the console community at least.

Top left looks like Michael Myers from Halloween change my mind

The gadget is supposed to enchance creativity! Each canister would have the potential to make a wall as tall as you aim it and as long as 3 operators in line.A total of 3 canisters would suffice i believe...Its balance in the way that if you make more walls you essentially giving Veg more surfaces to shoot his scanner darts.

hah lord tachanka meme lul
---
No it was on Xbox
---
I mean it depends how many skins you have
---
Good job!
---
Sick.
---
You on xbox, my friend had a game like this
---
and still it doesn't pop up. question mark
---

---
did you delete the game at any point. question mark
---
Your concept? https://youtu.be/-bZnIgWOWuU
---
I see. I‚Äôve had this happen a few times on ranked when the opposing team is about to lose, it always crashes the game. I‚Äôm not sure if people glitch/trigger this somehow
---
4:3 goat
---
It's on my ps4 i did to save up space
---
Eh, thats not the worst siege has to offer. 
---
But its because a copper &amp; higher tier friends can play ranked together

The game is so used to the OPs getting banned you can see all of them outlined, like memory foam.
---
Twitch drops?
---
i cant hear what jager says ugh
---
You‚Äôre not wrong. He probably has a fuck load as he‚Äôs level 323 lol
---
He needs it desperately,  nothing a flashbang, grenade or explosives etc or even a cross angle cant handle
---
Of course you dumped on, the aim is not a joke almost everyone can get a headshot in PC so don't over peek or try to run to safety. 
---
If you know that then maybe you'll change your play style.
---
Probably because a good majority of gamers are right wing do to deliberate recruiting tactics taken during the gamer gate "movement". This shift leads to leftists ending up being down voted when they most likely bring up criticisms of the games you look up. There's a few good videos documenting that transition. Plausible deniablity and what not.
---
IMO this is even more impressive on console because you can‚Äôt make the recommendation to everyone else in game chat
---
This was already posted homie holmes
---
If you hover over R6 on the dashboard and keep pressing down you can go to the avatar section on the very bottom. Each one costs $0.49 USD (at least where I live).
---
Probably custom pictures but I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
I do not remember, I've had it for years :(
---
Etc 750?? I don‚Äôt really remember
---
Nope and they won‚Äôt come back. I get what you mean though lol I made a post like 10 months ago asking if I should buy the year 1 pass or cool pro league set, I should‚Äôve gotten that. :(
---
I'm not a chapo fan girl, I'm a communist.
---
You did also claim that having a ‚Äúreport MnK‚Äù button on console would be a great idea in a previous post from about a month ago? What‚Äôs up with that?

I don't know why they kept peeking you. I feel bad that the flash bang completely missed.

Ohh gotcha. I didn‚Äôt even know what was a thing. ü§î

---
What did Valkyrie do to deserve death?
---
I‚Äôm only level 3, maybe 4
---
Plus it'd be really risky to use on certain corners if the walls are soft since you can just get shot through the wall when they see your peeker.
---
I think they can trace it back to their ip address
---
The same thing for me, I bought the game on Steam. There is no option to buy any r6 credits in Asia and there is nothing we can do at this point. The only way to buy them is by using a VPN, but your account might get banned for doing that. Let me know if you find a solution for this.
---
I'm going to probably get hate for this but can't fortnite detect the input?
---
Get a group of people to play with. The discord is full of people looking for groups. Or find a clan if that‚Äôs your thing. If you have a steady group, you can mess with your play styles more and have them pick up the slack when things don‚Äôt go well
---
Kaid
---
Lmao looks like one of the community devs saw this, your link doesn't work anymore
---
I agree man! Let's start banning random people till we hit the ones doing this! I'm sure we will only ban like, what, 5 players that didn't deserve it.

Yeah, it‚Äôs 3d abstract geometric.

Your final point dude
---
Thats not how ddosing works. You dont ddos a server using a your personal pc or ps4. You buy the service from a 3rd party bot net which has nothing tracking it back to you unless ubisoft gets into the cyber security business.
---
i‚Äôve actually got a clip where i managed to glitch his crossbow into his main gun and it acted as a 2nd sight
---
I've never seen this before. Weird how it's inside the wall.
---
i hit plat 3 yesterday. I don't think I'm in the right to give tips to be pro or anything like that.
---
but I play mainly casual and only play ranked if i feel like i have a good day. for example when get nice headshots and get good peeks then i think about to play in ranked. the main statement what i want to say is don't try to hard in ranked have fun at playing a great game and enjoy it. trust  me you get higher when you have fun and accept that sometimes it is not the time to tryhard in ranked
---
#ADD A HASHTAG TO THE START

Repeat offenders to what? anyone in the 10 players on the server can do it. It has nothing tracking back to a particular player other than the idiots that say it on chat.

Hide in stupid spots realistically no one check and  sneak behind with the pistol down them get an interro be a team player boom

I doubt Israel will ever be in the game because of the controversy about the country and I‚Äôm sure it could negatively affect potential sales if it recognizes Israel as a country  and I don‚Äôt think the big wigs in the corporate office wants to take this risk   But personality I would love to see them in the game with there long history of counter terror operations

You belong to Sam now.

Nah I like seeing buck teamkill him self or others. Its great

i hate this fucking game pls ubi id pay 200 fucking dollars to buy the glacier skins

I did after I killed his friend

whatcya want them to do fire and rehire the art team everything theres another major issue in the game?
---
lmao i always do this
---
I did later in the clip
---
Of course! Let's balance the game for low elo. Good idea man.
---
Check out the rainbow 6 website on how to link your account for twitch drops, you can earn ones next week during the Raleigh Major!
---
You have to change how you play, I was diamond one Xbox and since switching have stayed in plat. You just have to adjust to players better aim
---
But this is a really great strategy when it comes to defend since when you breach some area if you shoot through the wall you will compromise your position or at least defenders will know you there and YOU as attacker don't know if mira is looking behind or not, she could easily wait behind the reinforced wall, see the glass and shoot through the wall and kill you
---
Thank you for the advice! I'm just trying to hit gold but I'll definitely start taking the game less seriously and have more fun with ranked.
---
What? This is a normal game when a Ddoser is playing in your game.
---
I don't believe they said anything about it as far as i've seen but i'm sure they know, and the servers are microsoft azure servers
---
go and t-hunt until your aim is good
---
Nice ace!
---
Try and pre aim or predict their movements before shooting and get on an angle where if you do have to correct your aim it doesn't go all over the place and it is only little movements though it stays on target.
---
Angles is everything try and sit on a good angle and even when moving or a target is moving that the angle you're on doesn't effect your aiming it's all there is to it. If you sit a bad angle and shoot anyways your aiming won't look as good and will be harder to hit no matter how good of a shooter you are angles never lie.
---
See but you want an immediate solution since your season has already been ruined and doing that takes time to do. Time your poor poor ranked season doesn't have. There is nothing more important than your ranked season so what's a few false bans

i‚Äôve got the same problem with fuzes gun
---
It‚Äôs a competitive game mode. It‚Äôs aim is to emulate the competitive scene as best as they can.
---
The only legitimate method is via farming Terrorist Hunt - Hostage. You learn the spawns of whatever map you pick, and you rush to grab the hostage. The more kills you get the better your renown gain AFAIK, but you should aim to finish in under a minute. If you finish too fast you'll get 0 renown, so you'll have to aim for around 50 seconds.
---
it‚Äôs not you getting worse. Ut‚Äôs just everyone else is getting better. I experience this
---
Np
---
I thought you were referring to [this post] from earlier where they're talking about a report option similar to report for toxic behavior, that's what I'm saying would never work. An actual place to submit footage for it is a different story, but even that has been proven to me as a bad idea since that post because at the end of the day a human still has to review it and human error still exists so they're not going to ban on anything less than 100%
---
Is it bad I don‚Äôt understand what this is

Oh yea, you‚Äôre right. Actually forgot about the distributed part and also forgot about those sites that basically offer ddosing...

Operatoon Blood Orchid brought a lighting overhaul, three ops (Lesion, Ying, Ela), and Theme Park. The patch was massive, 20-30 GB iirc. Ubisoft removed Favela and Yacht from the multiplayer map pool completely to prevent reaching the data limit, if the data limit is exceeded, the game's file size goes up, which was necessary because of a massive patch size on top of a 30GB game.
---
Yeah she would be really good for casual even for slowing down a rush
---
Now if you really wanna destroy ranked players, use nomad. Her gadget is a copper crusher. However, her two primaries are just so aggravating, though her pistol is good.
---
Dokkaebi is good, but she requires great teamwork, and even better execution. The MK14 is ok at best, but the CZ 75 and SMG 12 both shred. I would go through the effort to learn the SMG 12, but the CZ 75 is easier.
---
All in all I would buy nomad, but Dokkaebi is a good option
---
Unfortunately ddoss is very very frequent in diamond. It‚Äôs very frustrating but nothing can be done about it.

You should look up Xiahou Dun. I think youd enjoy his eye story haha

May I ask what happened?
---
One abandon? Rookie numbers.
---
So true man. I got 4 black ice but a duplicate of one of them (jaggers rifle) such a bummer. Not sure if you can get a duplicate of one you paid for though. Have you had that happen?
---
Honestly maybe they could at least reduce the number of players using keyboards. It seems more and more people are doing it.
---
This is super annoying, even just in casual. I‚Äôll get distracted by my phone not drone at all and get kicked 5 seconds into the actual round. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm glad it happens sooner but fuck man.
---
I‚Äôm assuming community matches are 5v5 custom games?
---
first line describes literally all of copper.
---
I feel like they're both good operators. Jaeger can waste the attackers grenades and also has good weapons while Valkyrie is used for intel and has slightly worse weapons. They can both be used effectively.

So you can see the person that killed you really giving that crouch button a solid spamming.
---
About 10-15 minutes, but halfway through I accepted a squad invite from a friend but idk if that did anything

heh, [let me one up you] (https://i.imgur.com/Y027Rvu.png) I dont get this game man.
---
Elite skins aren't in alpha packs afaik
---
It was more for when you boarded a ship and went under deck where it is dark so they could uncover their eye and see perfectly in the dark and fight the crew members. They covered the light eye so the brain doesn‚Äôt just blend the lighting
---
Yeah they made a whole team to fix it, i think it was in one of the latest dev patch notes
---
Get off the self pity train bud sometimes things just don't  take off and get 12k upvotes

Gotta cover up one eye so that if you go in a dark area, you can take the eyepatch off and see in the dark instantly with the other eye.
---
The fact that it's obviously fake ruins it anyway
---
Im a say this now, they are all dumb ideas that no one will want or care about. They will still be underpicked. Ubi wont give N√∏kk frags, no way my man. Fuze is already good, his Ak had the highest DPS out of any AR. Warden is just stupid since he is supposed to be a direct counter to Blitz and Ying in which didn't work as the thing that hinders him is his speed (make him a 2-2 ubi). Kapkan and Frost are fine and not undertuned or underpicked, especially since Frost got nurfed. And we finally get on to Castle, the onlu thing in my opinion that would make him stronger would be to make it so his barricades we unbreakable by frags or maybe even give him a fourth as there is always that one doorway or window not secure enough. Not gonna lie but the changes you have proposed are quite drastic and are somewhat stupid as it would make some opps (looking at N√∏kk and Castle) op. For one N√∏kk is already a selfish op so lets give her frags, what a wonderful idea make her like IQ again except shes a two armour. Now Castle, giving him 5 barricades with no drown passage is stupid as he could wall off an entire objective and not let the objective be found. Also what would Warden gain from getting the P90 he has a low recoil smg, decent shotgun, good semi-auto pistol and a happy go lucky recoil headshot machine. Sorry if this is too long for a reply but gosh those are some dumb ideas.
---
Idk about that. Of course you need to have fun but playing casual isnt the best way to improve. When I started playing siege in Velvet shell I only played ranked for some time on cooper 4 (12 MMR a game) I keept doing that and 2 seasons later in Blood Orchid I hite Platinum the first time. All I want to say is that the most people I know did only improve when they started playing ranked like casual.
---
Why didnt you withstand
---
Re teamkilling a team killer is literally defeating the purpose of reverse friendly fire.

Yeah you‚Äôre right. I started reading on this because I just couldn‚Äôt make sense of it. Turns out it‚Äôs all true. I learned something tonight.

---
Florida Stanley doesn't team kill
---
It says in his story or whatever that he was captured and tortured, and when he was rescued the damage to his body was done which I‚Äôm guessing was his eye
---
He got a glass eye from a talking rabbit
---
I agree with you entirely I think what does need to happen with jackal is similar to what you said. 
---
Jackal should only be able to scan footprints from a 3 foot distance at most. The footprints also should disappear a lot faster since footprints on tile, concrete, lamenent, and carpet don't stay very long. His charges don't need to be reduced because there are plenty of ways to use him tracking you to your advantage.
---
Just speaking the truth. No set group should decide the fate of a community like Siege's.
---
It's been 70 years since North Korea was formed, I guess they're alright in your view as well.

Yeah I just meant if I need to use my phone for something could I switch to my PS4 partway through and have the time for either one count, so if I watched 30 minutes on my phone, turn my phone off and watch 30 minutes on my PS4 it would count as 1 hour.
---
I'm pretty bad at explaining stuff sorry
---
[Here is a official blog explaining the different stuff you get from the different versions.](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/faqs/000032916/Content-of-Rainbow-Six-Siege-Editions-R6S)
---
That said no version now comes with the base operators, they take 500-1000-1500-2000 renown each to unlock (total 25000). 
---
You get around 300 ish renown per casual win and 150 per loss. 
---
Maps, Balance changes and anything gameplay related updates are accessible via all the versions of the game. 
---
You can unlock all of the operators by just playing the game.
---
I think they are a legitimate state. A terrible country but a legitimate one, yeah.
---
Yes that works, I have done it on most events. Doesn‚Äôt hurt to just leave your PS4 on though. Viewing numbers help, more numbers attract more attention to the event and game.
---
Are you sure you aren't getting confused between gpu and CPU usage issues?
---
If CPU is at 100%, then it's a problem. But if gpu usage is 100%, then good. It means you aren't bottlenecking. GPU usage should be at 100 or close to 100 at all times. You can search for this if you need a second confirmation. Gpu must be used as much as possible.

smh
---
I peaked at gold 2, and am now in silver 2. If you want to stack up I‚Äôm down, I got to where I‚Äôm at because I solo queue
---
May I ask a question, do you think that people using things like the Clash glitch should be temp banned? If so, why do you think that this, which is arguably just as bad, shouldn't be? I feel abusing exploits should absolutely result in temp bans of the account. It is a game ruining exploit and there isn't any way around it. This punishes people who actually abuse it, and does nothing to anyone else. This also would wipe the game same way it does as cheaters, so if you're on the team of someone being a cunt then the only thing you lose is some time.

I bought the 50 pack not too long ago and I got the same Capitao head gear about 5 times. Only thing I got of value was 1 black ice, the rest were throw aways or duplicates. For 180,000, I should have just bought the items I wanted instead.

It's a band-aid solution, but it's by far the best available. If you get tired of getting stomped by MKB players, you now have an option to avoid that entirely. That's all there is to it. It may draw some players away from using an emulator, which is great, but that's just a side effect, and is in no way what the solution is intended to do.
---
Many players would love to use MKB on console, but they won't as it's effectively cheating. I'd personally never play an FPS with a controller, I'm sure there are many others like me. There is zero reason to limit players to a certain control scheme, as long as they're segregated. Yes, regular controller queues would still be infested with MKB emulator users, but if you wanted to be able to aim you wouldn't be forced to cheat.

Same thing happened to me a few days ago. No notification. No disconnect. Matchmaking gave us a 3v5

Iron sights can be not very good on certain guns. For example the f2 is considered one of the best guns in the game, but the iron sights and the recoil is so bad that for many people the recoil is to bad and they can't aim right. Acogs are generally considered the best sight as they have the most zoom and are the best for snagging headshots and holding angles. They give a huge advantage over other sights. A vertical grip can turn a gun into a firehose into a laser beam and muzzle attachments can make a world of difference. In short term attachments make weapons more convenient, easier to use, and they give an edge over the competition.
---
sounds like mad cuz bad to me
---
Definitely agree! I have like 162 credits that I can't do shit with
---
Huh. I always assumed the ACOG was a crock of shit, since zooming so far in cuts out your peripheral vision.

Hello HotdogAu, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cnyhpz/ddos_is_a_major_issue_on_console_couldnt_move_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I've been playing this game for a while yet I never thought of this.... if I should give one advice I would say new players should by rook as their first defending operator and you him to try learning gun playing and positioning on either OBJ or around the map.
---
He just uses an eye patch to always make sure hes reDy for a night mission so his eyes dont have to adjust
---
I generally agree with you there. I run alot of holographic but sometimes the game boils down to holding an angle waiting for the enemy to fuck up and peek you so you can blow their head off. Just remember you don't have to follow the meta so I would use the sight you enjoy and the operators you enjoy. Whether it's the recruit with the f2 or an ash main, use what you like and what you have fun and do good with.
---
I know how to counter them already they are just annoying to play against
---
Explain this, Ubi.
---
Thanks :) I'm probably going to try to unlock Mute, since he looks the coolest out of the characters I can afford, and maybe drop $5 to buy Warden.
---
I managed to get up all the way without any vault prompts once, though I haven't been able to repeat it since. I just kinda strafed back and forth on the cabinet until I slid up onto the shelf.
---
yoo.. what charm is that? sorry if its a common thing.. i‚Äôve been off siege for about a year and a half
---
I highly recommend mute as he just keeps getting better and better and counters like a thousand things.
---
ash is the fastest mofo in r6 but to answer your question I do agree zofia is a version of ash but shoots pokeballs that can do a max of 40 dmg
---
What does he do?
---
Do you know the Max damage of ashes breaching charges to a person?
---
fine I‚Äôll say it myself 
---
gg

i could be how Xbox players probably grew up with Halo which helped develop their teamwork early on. While PS players had to wait for COD which lead to a faster pace gameplay

This was oddly wholesome and I feel happy reading about your interaction.
---

---
Also, yea it is 1:1 how Arya killed him. Did you enjoy S8? I am one of the people who refuse to acknowledge that S7 and S8 Exist and basically S6 ending was left in a cliffhanger, that's how at least I prefer it since from there on the show gone to shit.
---
Finally,my time has come
---
S8 is to GoT as TLJ is to Star Wars.
---
A fucking disaster.
---
Though I don't particularly enjoy S5 onwards and think BoTB is widely overrated.
---
The main guy in the movie Valkyrie had a glass eye, so it makes perfect sense.

He's a cheat. Like everyone else who kills me in this cheese ass cheaters heaven of a game.

Ya that's walls and maybe a bad aimbot that cant recoil compensate well
---
Thanks for catching that. Fixed it.
---
Nevermind, i cna to explain just so we can argue about it. Lets agree to disagree
---
&gt;why dont they hardware ban these people
---
All the hardware info can be spoofed ez. Nothing is unhackable.
---
Accept what i know for a fact that there are more than a 1000 items in alpha packs and that they do not remove items
---
this one time i watched a dude track my head through three walls for a whole 5 seconds and then headshot me as soon as i become visible, and then he tried to pass it off as "youve never played with a diamond before have you" this game is so full of cheaters.
---
Can't connect to the rank server, so it can't tell you what your rank is. It's just visual
---
honestly, platinums should just be banned from casual
---
congrats, that there are more than 1k items, be happy, grind packs and don't cry about dups
---
Umm, last time I checked it was a pistol
---
U didn't pick up my idea, I mean that such non-team abilities are too useless in Siege, look at Caveira's or Vigil's pick rate in pro league, Vigil is sometimes picked by JoyStick, but only if Jager is banned. Nokk has the same problem. I'm playing in the squad and we can't include Nokk in any tactic because she is completely useless for team
---
Im not crying about duplicates it was a suggestion. I just want the packs to work better. The percentage to get a legendary or epic are extremely low  and the fact the you can get a duplicate legendary is ridiculous
---
why is it ridiculous? when you open a lot of packs you have a lot of legendarys, I have most of the good looking legendarys, and most of the trash
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not blind tho
---
There are plenty of content creators who think the same way i do

have there been any plans to add a "backfill" reward for people who join ongoing casual games (maybe around 100 renown)? the majority of the community doesn't enjoy joining ongoing matches because of the long loading times and small renown award. i think adding this would entice people to not leave when they get put in the middle of a game.

The update went live 25h ago. After 24h you are forced to download the update

More like I was able to hot breach and reposition into an advantageous position while he was rotating from bar. My guess is he didn‚Äôt know I hot breached and was already inside. He probably thought it was an attacker setting off a breaching charge and hanging outside. If I were any other operator, he would‚Äôve heard the footsteps as I was repositioning and probably got the drop on me.

Hello xKPAXx, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/co4ac9/he_forgot_reverse_friendly_fire_was_enabled/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You have to understand, with all the conditions you set up, you might as well be asking:

&gt;hey how to get access to any account if I don't know the password, don't have any proof of purchase (account too old) and can't recover password cause email is also inaccessible and also seemingly unrecoverable as well

Tbh it is a way bigger part of cod. That's about all of your intel.
---
If we didn't have drones etc, we would fucking need a minimap for Intel.
---
Navigation isn't the problem, it's decision making based on intel.
---
My argument is as follows 
---
1. Imperialism is a crime
---
2. The state of Israel was established in an imperialist manner
---
3. Therefore, the establishment of Israel was a crime
---
Your argument was "it's not a crime because the US and other countries backed it". Is it then not a crime if I killed 3 men but got Warren buffet, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos to say it wasn't. Crimes are crimes regardless of who's on your side and who isn't

Yeah, I got an F in coloring, but I passed because I would read to the other kids while they graded papers or whatever.

do i have to register every time there‚Äôs an event or will it still be activated from last time

I understand that but you would think that a company as big as ubi would have the resources to combat it.

Admittedly I relied on it solely for the longest time. Like I'd even only use Doc and Rook because I was most comfortable with them defending
---
Peacekeeper bud. Think about it.

Yes by far.

just change the aspect ratio ingame and leave alone the resolution

How?

Yeah. But then you run into the problem of people not wanting the new one, but they already paid. I like him as a character, but this will never work properly. 
---
People may say that "he's useless! His shield only blocks one bullet!" But the thing is, if the BB can aim, he only needs the one shot to be blocked.
---
Holy shit, talking with you people is like trying to convince a wall to move.
---
i always activate, just to make sure
---
Shut up you probably only enjoy the map because you run out every time.

Teammates cannot kick you from a ranked match. You probably just lagged out, it happens. It sucks that it happened at such a crucial moment, but losing a single game won't throw you off too much.

Yea I checked their profile and they were platinum I'm silver so I thought they might have had a strat on that map that I didnt know but everyone else did

Oh right my bad. I don't play BB at all so I forgot how much his shields hp is

Thanks, can you elaborate a bit on why it would be more fun on pc?  I don't have my pc with me for a few months and just took the Xbox with me but could get it on pc as well later.
---
Aren't they for different guns? Black Ice for 5.7 Usg and the other one for Meusoc?
---
Black ice was a year 1 season 1 limited skin. So for a while the game was struggling and the player base was low, then the game grew in popularity as QOL updates saved the game.
---
Black Ice use to be a ‚Äústatus symbol‚Äù of someone who‚Äôs been playing since the beginning. Now that it‚Äôs available in Alpha Packs (low drop rate) it‚Äôs seen as a commodity.

How did you paint this? I‚Äôm interested to hear your technique and what all you used to again such a clean look.
---
I really dont like the idea of goblin as it enforces Ubi's growing culture of just recycling old content. I think that if he were to be introduced into the game, players would refer to the op as simply a "mute on attack" 
---
Many of us pay ¬£25 (i'm british and dont know the equivilent in $) a year for the season pass, which is ubisofts insentive to work harder to develop creative ideas for new ops, maps and guns. I really dont think letting them get away with operation phantom sight (which added barely any new content anyway with no new guns or maps and recycled abilities) is a very good idea. 
---
I think the majority of us serious players would agree that new ops should be added to make the game more exciting and interesting, not just to fill a hole in the meta.
---
Apart from that, i think that your ideas are brilliant and inspired, and i agree that a jungle themed map would be cool and simple for ubi to design (many relitive assets from assasins creed could be used).
---
That sounds fine to me, thanks for the heads up.
---
No need to be pedantic, I apologized for the quality. Had to take a pic on my phone because my taxi arrived while I was finishing it.

Counter to the first part pc is more competitive and win deltas would be vastly different for console. Also pro league is on pc hence they tend to balance more for pc than console. As for banning they may not show it I honestly have no idea on that one.

It also has a passing resemblance due to the carry handle.

Why doesn't ubi make the lower ranks play with the higher ranks? If a team had a plat and coppers, make the coppers play at the plat level, don't try to make it even because people will just boost, make the lower ranks match to the highest ranked player on their team.

Until you actually learn the game and maps what operator you choose will be irrelevant. Just pick someone whos gun and ability you like

What graphics settings is the console version running on, it looks like below very low. I want this on PC.
---
It is absolutely not. Unless the last patch changed it you can run right up on people without making a sound
---
I like your style, Mira mains rejoice!
---
Not anymore it isn't. I'm talking in terms of health, they are low. Obviously a good black beard player can get the kill before gettin taken out but I honestly find him boring and campy to use effectively. It's down to personal choice but I'd say buck in the long run is a better choice because of his kit and ability to use vertical gameplay. Buck teaches ppl to be more aggressive with the destruction in the game.
---
Speechless
---
 Nobody is talking about the suppressed SMG-11.
---
3 speed and acog?
---
The last time they had it, they lost it. For obvious reasons of excessive versatility.
---
We don't need any more of those.
---
Ah, I would suggest figuring out your play style first, playing with all of the base ops should help you figure a good amount of what you as a player need to get ahead of your opponents
---
Is that the name of the anime?
---
Shhh...I don't even know why I have that on there
---
It still makes sound
---
Yup
---
eh
---
K√∂b√®
---
I would go for a more passive operator, such as Rook, Valkary or Twitch that way if you die early on the chances are you had a positive effect by using your gadget early in drone/prep phase
---
Well in that case Thermite is pretty good for getting into the objective. I can't really suggest a defender without knowing how you play but I really like Bandit since he can stop hard breachers.
---
Nice 4k either way.
---
I have black ice for that Shotgun so I've been playing more mute/smoke and I've gotten pretty good with the recoil in the SMG-11, for console.
---
His shotgun is one of the better ones for sure.
---
Great at talking but is actually useless maybe?

Thats just retarded, why not allow everyone to play. This guy's idea is much better, as than the coppers and plats can play together but they will be at a disadvantage.

It was ranked, in whatever game i only play ranked. Its nice to see how good i am compared to the rest, even when im bronze lol (yeah i wrote silver in the original post but i forgot that i dropped to bronze today)
---
This will be put on my youtube soon
---
Wait there is an operator named jackal? Hmm sounds pretty OP probs should be banned.
---
You're just assuming there's one light source only.
---
Awesome
---
Warden is pretty good tho, kafe is also a lot better than what it was and it was already one of the best maps before its rework
---
Personally, very disappointed. I'm likely to be taking a very long break due to work soon so I really wanted to main Nokk and master her before I leave. 
---
On paper, a stealthy Attacker sounds amazing and I didn't understand why we didn't have one until now. However, her issues became glaring after a month of playing her mostly. 
---
1. Her stealth is very easily countered. Barbed wires and Gu mines hinders her so much. Bypassing cams isn't actually that impactful when 3 Speed flankers rotating around takes out almost every cams within the area to begin with. That leaves her with the quiet footstep, which is only slightly bit more effective than 3 Speeds crouch walking. 
---
2. It's rare to actually catch someone off guard and only really happened when playing against bad players. In the end, it's almost always a straight out gun fights and Nokk lacks that damage and range benefit the other Attackers have. With Defenders often having the angle advantage, it's not easy to outgun her in general as a Defender. 
---
This is my favorite quote someone said in other thread: 
---
&gt;"Playing Nokk is all about being sneaky and wedging yourself into a difficult position for the defense, and then realizing you could have done that with literally any other 3-speed operator with better guns since Nokk's ability is only marginally better than just crouch walking."
---
Unless both her stealth and gun are buffed, there's no reason to pick her over other flankers. IQ taking out hidden cams, drones, and gu mines before crouch walking into the obj is far more threatening while still providing utility for her team. 
---
Maybe if Nokk can run while using her gadget, it will justify her being 2 Speed, weak gun, and having no utility. I'd also be very happy if Nokk gets that Galil back as Pengu mentioned that she had one when he was test playing her. 
---
I am just hoping that Ubi does adjust the two new operators by the time the next season arrives. Otherwise, those two will join Tachanka at this rate especially when we get the new operators.
---
With that idea, if a plat and a legitimate copper team up, then there's 3 other plats who have to play with a copper and be at a disadvantage jsut for trying to play the game. If a plat wants to play with a copper, they can play in casual where rank differences don't matter.
---
so cool

That‚Äôs sick! I‚Äôd really love to see Echo with the devil skin.

I was waiting for Sledge gets 4k by the frag.

It started in the top floor, he didn't reach his hands down through the floor boards before he threw it
---
Valk would've also been a good option.
---
Report them directly to Ubisoft that‚Äôs my recommendation
---
If it's a full squad, then there would be no issues with rank differences, then everyone is willingly playing at a disadvantage. Short of a 5 stack, the best way to deal with it is to cap the difference between ranks.

Zofia main here, personally I run the AR with Acog/Flash/Vertical and play her as an entry fragger. Once you're droned in and have information use her impacts to blow up utility. Wire/Kapkans/Grzmots/WelcomeMats/ect. or go through walls/hatches. Than stun and go for the kill.
---
Another great way is on a vertical heavy map like border take breaching charges and get map control above the objective before making anchors lives a living hell.
---
In a pinch use the stuns as a drone, since they're proximity detonated you can check if someone is in the room.
---
If you do play her as an entry fragger remember not to get too aggressive, play smart aggression not dumb rushing, use the utility to put pressure and concuss before the push.
---
If you can't control recoil well start with 
---
Holo, Reflex/Muzzle, Comp/Angled to learn the basics.
---
How do you play Shot Gun Roulette
---
There are so many counters to any shield. If anyone says otherwise they clearly have never play a shield. I‚Äôve been maining shields for a while and after getting kill in almost every way imaginable you learn how to easily deal with them when the situation is reversed.
---
Idk what jackal does I bought him at the beginning of the season and he‚Äôs been always banned guess it‚Äôs time to play casual
---
True
---
He revives them to 75 with his pistol that‚Äôs good enough
---
I‚Äôm fine with recoil control. When I do play vertical a roamer gets me though.
---
Oh I never knew that tbh. That‚Äôs crazy and in fairness one person said they tk me cause I‚Äôm trash but I shouldn‚Äôt generalise that to others. Thanks for letting me know
---
Wie spielt man shotgun Roulette?
---
Yes/No, if they are like teleporting they you might with a support ticket. if they are using walls and stuff you probs won't be able.
---
even then seems they only really manually ban if you are a huge streamer!
---
Looks like wrench from watch dogs 2
---
Yeah I guess that works to XD
---
If she peaked the corner as you was jumping out it would cause this affect. A major r6 YouTuber ( honestly watch to many to remember which one. ) covered this on their channel. I do agree with you that it is frustrating though.
---
Also I‚Äôd say blue bar takes a much more coordinated team usually
---
You're discusting.
---
Right but they can just hit the server so the game doesnt count anyway. If they made it so the game just disconnected and didnt count if, in consecutive rounds, the pings all get absurd the cheaters wouldnt get elo
---
One question, would you say shields are balanced?
---
I‚Äôve been laughing at ‚Äúsmonk‚Äù for a while now.
---
Well I‚Äôm on console and this kid on my team was teaming with opponents.
---
He also said we have 3 weeks of test server again even tho I‚Äôm pretty sure it was ONLY for phantom sight
---
I couldn't agree more. We must have learned to play the same way.
---
I really wish it wasn‚Äôt the case, too, because I believe anyone should be able to enjoy a game to it‚Äôs fullest no matter the platform, but it is. If someone starts getting toxic on pc (in my experience, at least) the entire team just pulls out a ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do that here‚Äù on em. The target audience of consoles is much more casual, though, so they‚Äôre less likely to actually give a crap about etiquette.
---
thank you for not calling me disgusting but instead discusting
---
Oh FUCK ME
---
Forcefully pronouncing AUG as a word instead of an abbreviation gives me Schwarzenegger vibes. "Get the AUEEHG!!!"
---
Have you tried the pistol that Hibana/Echo uses? That thing is insane.
---
Not really anymore I‚Äôm 267 and most high level players are 300+
---
depends on how long you've been playing &amp; how much you play everyday
---
What about the shield is a castle, and when you extend the shield the little drawbridge in the centre rises.
---
¬†"Hamas-run al-Aqsa TV station showed chaotic footage from the scene" 
---
Other then the fact that says a lot,
---
Do you really wanna compare "atrocities"? 
---
We shoot at "hospitals" because its known hamas uses parts of the hospitals to hide weaponary, whats hamas's reason to LITERALLY shoot rockets at homes, hospitals, schools ETC other then thier intent to kill whoever? To drag us to shoot at thier weapon stashes and rocket launchers possibly hurting civilians although the idf is known to do its best to alert citizens before a strike unlike ANY other army in the world
---
Im talking about flyers from a plane, radio transmissions, phone calls. what does hamas do before it sends missiles to areas with innocent population? nothing.
---
How many did they kill with all thier terror attacks against civilians and casualtiea from the rockets? Uh?
---
I can‚Äôt answer that question until they fix shields. There are so many problem with them that the gameplay you see with shields is not what is intended.
---
That's a whole different thing, that categorizes under game throwing not toxic/cheating, siege doesnt necessarily have a policy against that....
---
Ass aim for me. Transferred from Xbox to PC last year. Sometimes I‚Äôm good. Most times, not so much.
---
The instant ‚Äú1v1 is winnable‚Äù panic realization haha love it
---
Really oh my god.
