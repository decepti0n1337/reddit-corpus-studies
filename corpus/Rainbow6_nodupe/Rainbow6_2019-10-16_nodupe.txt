It wouldn‚Äôt really put that much of an edge on it, vigil‚Äôs smg would still be way more viable in any situation. Acog would just turn it into a meme cannon.

Mira's great, if you know the default spots for her gadget and how to play her. This guy is just not great with mira.

I don't know, why don't you ask...

...YOURSELF!

What is
---
Sounds good! Pro tip: stay positive! And even if you have a weak moment and get toxic, just calm down, maybe if u handle it in the same match, apologize and go on!
---
Just play a lot, watch some videos about the game and all that to see and understand things like angles and perspectives, basic set ups for defense and attacking, etc.
---
Dammit now I can‚Äôt unsee it, thanks
---
This happens to me sometimes, I just alt-tab, open the start menu and close it and the taskbar should go away.

Yes!!! Also r/unexpectedkoolaidman
---
Yea, I‚Äôm not sure all what happened. I still can only count 3 shooting kills. I know one of the other guys stepped on my trap (the last guy I kill) but not sure how I downed the other lol.

Better than random look boxes

Yeah, it would be fun on casual or unranked

Who cares, you don‚Äôt have to buy it. 10-20$ for a vast line of cosmetics and it will give people something to do. It‚Äôs better then paying 10$ for one skin
---
The responses on this thread... 
---
They do put a smile on my face.
---
Man, I've argued with people like you before on the internet. Instead of admitting a small thing or arguing against it, they will go for insults and straight up denial. It's kind of sad but I know I can't persuade you so hope you just have fun in siege man.
---
Yep, the official one
---
If you mean why they don't all have the same ones, simple, Mira running around with an acog would be horrifying.

If your question meant something else then ask away

Disgusting
---
People like you actually make me puke. The entitlement in this subreddit is actually hilarious. The game is around $30, you have the ability to get every operator in this game for *free*, maps for *free*, reworks for *free*, and you're going to complain that Ubisoft wants to add support for the game in the future? Give me a fucking break.
---
Call me Harry!
---
You can buy a mini keypad with an analogue stick for your thumb. IIRC, Razer make one. There's even a pro player that uses/used to use it.
---
Your statement literally is invalid as i already pointed out why.
---
They put all the limited and cool items players WANT behind a paywall to put pressure into them into buying the pass.
---
It's the same like the event packs,only difference being one gambling and the other one putting effort into unlocking the content you PAID for.
---
That took a turn holy shit
---
FOR HONOR
---
With the bosg you get 1 shot body kills if they are close anyway.
---
I need explaining
---
F
---
Eh Ill pass. I think its kinda dumb to have a battle pass in a game thats not free to play
---
Okay, bye. üëã
---
I know there will be. I was just talking the current mini pass. Taking their opportunity to show people not familiar with battle passes how it works and its only 7 levels and third of it is empty. If they cant fill 7 levels how are they gonna fill 100 levels in the paid pass
---
Whelp, thanks
---
They mean why cant Ubi give different attachments to operators using the same guns. E.g. like giving ACOG to Nokk's FMG but not smonk 
---
And to answer the question, Ubi has stated that theres limitations on that due to the way the guns and attachments are coded.
---
Carry us to this victory all mighty one
---
Sure the premium will have better items but if as a player you can‚Äôt say to yourself I don‚Äôt need it and I don‚Äôt have the money to put into this it‚Äôs kind of your fault. I never buy any special alpha packs or any cosmetic items from any games. As the consumer you have to ask you: what value will I get from this? They are a business, they need money in order to be able to 1. Keep the servers 2. Pay the devs to make more content. If players want to buy it and have the means, they should but the game doesn‚Äôt pressure you to buy the cosmetic items, you pressure yourself.
---

Is this an actual post?

Once again, you don‚Äôt have to buy it. It‚Äôs not pay to win so what‚Äôs the big deal? After all there just cosmetics. You WANT THEM whether or not there behind a paywall. You want to buy a nice sports car, just because it‚Äôs behind a hefty paywall doesn‚Äôt mean the deal ship can‚Äôt sell it. AFTER ALL YOUR THE ONE THAT WANTS IT

You've completely misunderstood my comment. 
---
&gt;Time gating would be making the new OPs only available for the season they come with and you can't get them again at all or until a specific times comes around. 
---
This would be timed exclusive content, like certain skins being only available during a single season. Timegating is literally content gated behind time, like if they instituted a limit to the amount of battle pass levels you could gain in a week.
---
Brand new operators are 100% a paywall situation which is exactly what my comment you quoted said. You might have misinterpreted the part that mentioned "first week of the season" as being an example of timegating.
---

---
I do this sometimes in plat as well! It's great fun
---
Of course! I'm not arguing against bosg acog here
---
I never understood the mentality that casual vs comp should play out differently gameplay wise. It‚Äôs still the same game, the only difference really is that the skill levels should be more even and you get fake internet point for comp. 
---
If anything you should expect it more in casual because doing that is a very risky/bad way to play, which people are more willing to do when there‚Äôs no rank to risk.
---
The movie is amazing i saw it a few days ago
---
Honestly I find it funny but my teammates were like, "WHO WOULD DO THAT?!"
---
According to game lore, the fights that we experience are training exercises for the operators so the bomb isn‚Äôt real.
---
A while ago as in a couple of weeks
---
Okay. They already have multiple revenue streams for the game, they have R6 credits, the season pass, and there are items that can only be bought with real money (the Bushido sets). There are more items that can only be bought with R6 credits than in previous years (the R6 team sets of Headgear, Uniform, Charm and Weapon Skin), there are seasonal temporary lootpacks almost every season that cost upwards of over $100 USD to complete a set and are a gamble to get the items you really want, and they are saving money on making new assets by recycling old ones for new operators (in the form of recycling weapons). Now, for an even bigger piss off they are introducing yet another revenue stream in the form of a battle pass, which would make a great addition to make the season pass more worth buying. 
---
Ask ANYBODY the reason why they buy the season pass and the first and most important reason is for the operators. Now, speaking of the season pass, you're right, I shouldn't expect multiple cosmetics in the store to be season pass holders for free, that's been the case for four season passes and I've come to accept it. However, I should expect that after four years they should have come up with more of more significant benefits for shelling out thirty dollars for content that hasn't been released yet, or, in the cases of Operation Health and with the whole Clash mess, may be delayed or disabled for an entire season. 
---
It's not a season pass, it's an operator pass. It would feel like more of a season pass if you were given access to the seasonal Battle Passes as well. But we probably won't. Ubisoft is double dipping, and is asking for you to pay again for content that will last for a season or two. To put it another way, it's almost like these battle passes are yet another season pass, fancy that huh?
---
I see what you were thinking with Ignite but just not very practical.

The bosg on ps4 feels so unreliable move an inch while shooting and your shot goes wild like a cod sniper no scope

Horde mode type game as a capstone project, using various different models with the same animations to add some diversity to the outward appearance, to answer the last part. I realize that is completely different from a first person shooter, and it's only speculation on how I would have handled the problem.

Timed exclusive is how, technically speaking, the new Ops are now.  They are only exclusive a specific time, one week.  Time gated is locking stuff for only a specific time frame to unlock.  This is seasonal uniforms or event items.  
---
Brand new OPs aren't behind any paywall either.  Sure, they're locked for a week if you don't have the season pass, but you don't need to buy it, you can wait a week and unlock them with the in game earned currency to unlock them.  You can unlock all post launch OP without spending any real money through either passes or R6 Credits.
---
You're a bottom feeder.
---
It didn‚Äôt exactly kill them but the ads nerf especially does kind of change how you need to play them.
---
The melee nerf is stupid but its fine since very rarely does anyone survive and it just delays their death by like 1 second.
---
The hipfire nerf is also stupid as you can somehow miss at point blank range yet the lucky headshots they were trying to stop still happens quite often.
---
The ads nerf is probably the worst out of all of them though and actually does what they were trying to fix.
---
i see many really big fucking holes in your future
---
Although there backrounds include their hight, it really has nothing to do with the gameplay. All characters modles are at the same hight to ensure balance.

Vigil- "You can never have too much protection."
---
This was fucking hilarious. Good job dude. My favourite siege video now. ü§òüçª
---
My use of saying skins are timed-exclusive was wrong though and calling them seasonal is much more appropriate.
---
However, operators aren't timed exclusive either. For an example of potential timed exclusive content in R6, if a new season was released and was exclusive to PC for the first month and then it was released on PS4/XBOX. 
---
But new operators are still a paywall situation since you have to pay real money in order to use them during the first week. You even say it yourself: 
---
&gt;they're locked for a week if you don't have the season pass
---
So they're walled off for the first week of the season unless I pay real currency for the season pass. How do you interpret that as anything other than a week-long paywall.
---
no

def stay away from a negative mindset and don't doubt your skills, this happened to me once, i usually drop around 7-8 kills a game but when i hit this block i started dropping donuts and started to doubt whether i was good or not, all that doubt will do is just bring you down even more, take a breather from siege if you start losing games or dropping donuts or breadsticks, and then hop back on once you're refreshed and ready to go, make sure you're confident in your abilities in every match you play

Yea I didn‚Äôt notice that the first shot hit. You‚Äôre definitely right.
---
One thing about the reflex sight is that I always have to remember that the tip of the triangle is the center point
---
The only saving grace of a season like this would be a major Tachanka rework imo. I think the hype would be unbelievably high
---
we already have operators who this is. nomad and gridlock. throw a gridlock in a hall and defenders can‚Äôt walk pass it without making noise. nomad can use her air jabs to deny flanks in doorways and stairs also claymores exist. we don‚Äôt need more flank coverage
---
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt know either and I‚Äôve been playing since Dust Line
---
it just doesn't have to be done at all
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking but if they are going to do a rework themed season you gotta do something crazy like plane imo
---
bruh, ur forgetting gridlock in that. both burnt horizon operators are great.
---
Nice.
---
Because then you can really focus on fixing Ops that may not be extremely strong, but extremely frustrating. I think it would improve Ranked by incentivizing strategic bans instead of ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù bans if they reworked the global ops.
---
Thank you!
---
The flicks are real
---
I‚Äôd rather they just do mid season tweaks rather than dedicate an entire season to it, unless its like operation health where the next two seasons got three operators to make up for the ones we missed out on.
---
It has 0 recoil so if you can aim for the head it‚Äôs nasty
---
Which issss???
---
The ACS is infuriating at times when you pump a dozen shells into an Op from 2 feet away and they don‚Äôt die, but then you get moments Luke this and it‚Äôs all worth it
---
She turned into the koolaid man
---
Wish they'd pay me, but no. I have a ton of problems with them anyway.
---
I just don't care for two kinds of cosmetics that I don't really get to see. This battle pass is shit anyway, only thing I like is the ring and only because it reminds me of uncharted.
---
(also, I'll be honest, but I hate the concept of battle passes, dailies and weeklies. They make games feel like jobs)
---
I do hope that the next battle pass will have a ton of cool headgears and uniforms too, so that you can be happy too :)

I'd say this applies almost exclusively to nokk, warden, amaru, goyo, and (to an extent) finka and lion. The argument behind them receiving duplicate weapons is that not having to code brand new guns in saves space and cuts down on dev time for them to focus resources towards things like map reworks and cosmetics.

How can i get my main next to my name?
---
If you have less then 2 hours on the game you can ask for a refund and re-purchase the game.
---
The recoil for buck and maverick auto weapons are awfull.
---
if the enemy pushes and warden can quick peek while still being able to see through smokes and glaz can't,
---
its still op. or the enemies throw smoke to cover site and warden just looks through it and kill planter its still op. the whole idea of looking through smokes with an operator specific gadget is stupid in my opinion.
---
What the fuck is a bosga cog?
---
I was able to control it still am partially i am a buck main, well idk just feels difrent af like more vertical kick
---
Already in game for +-12 hours.
---
Everybody gangster 'till the defuser starts returning fire
---
On Valk it's actually justified because of how powerful her gadget is. But please Ubi, give Warden something better.
---
did u win tho
---
What are these comments man. Yeah South American people are most of the time more likely to be shorter in height that average but you can still find tall people there its not like they don't exist in these countries..

dont pity me, i know what I paid for and got exactly that

You fell down that hole bruh

you got outplayed
---
Clash and solo queue is bad but clash in a party can be a threat a huge threat
---
Bosgacog
---
Most certainly them. See there was 3 of them they all decided to rush him from the same door then during the ensuing firefight they could not kill the 1 man they were aiming to kill but displayed bad enough aim to firstly kill one of their own and then allow this guy to win a 3v1.
---
But you.. play.... These are confusing times
---
Bosg... ***THERMO SCOPE?***
---
Lmao my guy why wouldnt i enjoy top fragging with warden or clash fuze and gridlock ü§î. Now most ops are better but unless we talking warden. No one picks them and ever one loves to die to useless ops . Its called flexing my guy you flex your jager and ill flex my gridlock.
---
#Bosgacog
---
it's cosmetic stuff...they're already doing that now with events except events are better
---
I think last week. But yea at times it can be a hour match then you get kicked
---
#BosgACOG
---
I'm not bitching because they're happy about a skin they got. I'm bitching about how these types of posts are the epitome of low effort. Any more of these posts in this subreddit, and you got yourself another r/overwatch.
---
why not plat 1?
---
&gt;why would you pick an op just because less ppl play
---
So he can get to play them.

J√§ger had a 100% pick rate now.

He will grow up when he use BOSGACOG

if you're trying to troll around in games and be toxic in general, then yah, she can be fun to play
---
What rank?
---
If you actually do the math, it's significantly cheaper to pay for a battle pass and grind for an item (and more subjectively satisfying) than to try and get that item out of a loot box. And having loot boxes in battle passes as between milestone rewards is excellent. It gives you the opportunity to get even better content without having to buy extra loot boxes. The average consumer spends more on loot boxes every year than they do battle passes. I think battle passes should be included in the season pass though. Yes, you can earn lootboxes for free and never spend a dime, but your odds of getting a good skin for something are incredibly low, and I'd rather know what I'm getting and work towards it. 
---
TL;DR: Battle passes are better for the consumer, period. They are cheaper for the same content and actually give you satisfaction of success for your effort.
---
Yes she does a passive play style but so does any other shield op.
---
That would not happen, if you use #BosgACOG next time
---

I play her cause she's genuinely fun to play if you have a squad all the cool synergys you can do. One of my personal favorites is clash plus chanka
---
If you like roaming so much then get Cav lmao
---
gIvE mE cAv!
---
But should it not count as a kill? Since its a soft hatch and he was clearly shooting him?
---
Or just banned for the remainder of it
---
rekt
---
literally the point
---
This. Play a different genre for a bit.
---
Scary!
---
A really small fucking hole, coming right up!
---
But she is anoying, her taser range is 15 m to much in myopinion and that turtle strat
---
Just drink redbull like fabian and you'll get champion

The first shot at least hit and when he pulled out his pistol it clearly shows he was hitting his shots.

Just give him AP rounds problem solved

Ok. But you still pay to win pve?
---
*Sad sledge noises*
---
We need tha bosg acog mei bruddas

Doc boutta examine my ass

There is no such thing as "win pve". You pay to progress faster, not to win. There is no "end of match" in PvE, you play the game and that's it, no end. P2W is when you pay for an advantage over other PLAYERS.

no it still wont be used due to of you miss one shot your dead

That would be crossing the line imo, would make a lot of people angry.

Um no we don't all agree the fo-12 is op. Because it's nowhere near being so. It is the lowest damaging primary shotgun for both cqc and long ranges,  that's with the extended barrel. Yes even with the extended barrel, every other primary shotgun is better for range. The fo-12 has high recoil, and is buckshot so you're doing pathetic damage at range to begin with. The fo-12 by itself is the only good thing left in Ela's kit. Everything else is either lackluster or completely shit. This is coming from s main of hers. Her scorpion is the only primary without a recoil diamond in the game still, and is the 3rd lowest damaging wespon in the gsme. Els is already at 8 nerfs, mostly because ubi is very incompetent when it comes to balancing things. She's never been buffed and this what you're saying would only make her worse. It'd change nothing really,  the fo-12 now would go from just a well rounded balanced shotgun to a pile of shit. The scorpion would be at best mediocre. This fixes nothing.
---
It‚Äôs an amazing idea!

No offense, but people who play like this are hella annoying. They end up missing 90% of their shots trying to do *woohoo the flick* instead of aiming or prefiring like a normal person.

This is quality
---
HAHAHA
---
Yes
---
They reached a limit for how many licenses they can acquire for the new guns each season
---
We kept letting each other win and killing ourselves, it was 2-2 and my defending team tried to let them cap the point but they ran away when it was time up!

Would agree.

Yeah he was trying to kill us so his own teammates killed him lol

You have great aim for a console player!

Camouflage has always gotten me killed. I still can't see enemies that my spectating teammates can. Color blind people find it harder to see certain still colors. That's the problem. It's not a physical thing but rather how our brain processes images with the help of shape and color to improve reflex. That's why my reflex is slow. I can't see an enemy most of the time, until they shoot at me. I also have issues with sights but the Holo or reflex helps with that.
---
No not every game is unbalanced. Examples: Dota 2, Hots, Deathgarden and more games that i don't personally play...
---
Riot is focusing on pro league which sucks. As it is important to look at it, revolving the game only around those players is annoying af. Most of the player base are not above diamond, and just a tiny bit of balance comes from high elo that is not pro league. It's why some champions like Zed are not nerfed even tho they are kinda op as i cannot farm and if i will try, my hp will go down in a second. And please don't be that guy that is like "im diamond i know better than you, stop complaining about the game and get better maybe you'll get out of gold"...

This was back when you could shoot through plane windows with it an it was actually viable

Them. Literally a 3v1 that all they had to do was be a little patient and let IQ push for the obj...but of course in true casual fashion they got kill hungry and threw the round by funnel out together through a killbox.
---
The bottom line answer, which idk why it‚Äôs so hard for people here to just say, is yes it‚Äôs supposed to have. 
---
Before the patch the team with the lowest set of pings joined Attack first to start the match. Now it‚Äôs just random. So I‚Äôm theory it should be better than before. That‚Äôs all you really need to hear.

To be fair, he's a soldier not a bodybuilder so I would hope he doesn't look like he spends every waking moment at the gym pumping roids. If he's strong enough to run around with his LMG then he's plenty strong.

yes im looking at her but its tough to not make her look like valk which i already made

Now this what you are looking at is called Rainbow six siege. It is a really shitty game made by ubisoft. Hope this solved your problem have a good day.

Thanks for the input

Understandably, her AR isn‚Äôt chosen as much as the LMG or sausage because of the stats, but you have to remember she has a very busted global ability.  She buffs recoil to the point of nonexistence, she clears tinnitus, she cancels the disoriented effects of Yokai and grzmots.  She increases movement speed through barbed wire... the largest downfalls of her gadget are that Smoke‚Äôs ability affects attackers faster due to the increased heart rate and Pulse can detect them from farther away.  I can‚Äôt think of all seven thousand buffs off the op of my head, but you get the point.  Her gadget aids in making her primaries viable.

How many people even buy the season pass?  In my opinion the season pass is not worth buying because the only major benefit from it is a week of early access to the new operators every season
---
The rest of the "benefits"  like the store discount are worthless in my opinion 
---
The battle pass is not taking anything away from siege, it's just adding a new way to unlock cosmetics 
---
As long as the battle pass isn't pay to win it's fine, there are uniforms in this game that give players an advantage yet people would rather complain about the battle pass

Sucked his stomach in and squeezed through that tiny hole.

Do you know the MMR imbalance that causes? Simple math. They can't let you keep the MMR and also have the team that lost get the Mmr back. That would mean both teams got a raise, and nobody lost the game, so everybody got free elo. Multiply that by thousands of players, and you have officially messed up ranked more than it already is.
---
They have clarified it countless times as to why they can't do it. It's legit just math.
---
this is very impressive. I assume you have a very large penis as well?

OH YEAH

If you miss your clicks on the main menu so often that you're requesting Ubi to redesign the menu... I can only imagine how horrible your aim is in game.
---
Tbh most of it is ok-ish. It's only that "if you win against a ddos or cheater you should get your mmr back" is what is silly.
---
I‚Äôd do doc or rook. They both got that nice acog and there abilities are pretty useful
---
Bank main entrance is a genuine issue that I will accept, however, most spawn peeks are able to be countered and should remain in game.
---
Wow please take me to your mansion so I can suck you off. Just use your normal account and get better in Plat. Hell, get a squad to purposely lose every game until you are copper, and go up the ranks from there.
---
Revolvers underrated in my opinion
---
Some water should help.
---
Yeah, but Finka can give himself 0 recoil and quicker ADS whenever she wants. It's not a good idea to give her a better gun and let her exploit that even more.
---
Happened in many games last night. I shotguned one part of the hatch and my teammate fell though. It only had a small hole in it. Seems like a new bug, as usual
---
Pretty sure the ACOG sight is widely considered the best sight because of the two time zoom...
---
I once had this moment, except we're all recruit.
---
That's fine. If I get spawnpeeked, that's my fault. I didn't pay attention.
---
You frost and alibi are super strong you just gotta play smart, but between maestro and vigil I go with maestro every time, his lmg will pop grapes like no ones business and his shotty pistol leaves you perfect murder holes, vigil is great but with the bosg if you miss a single shot you're dead before you have the chance to reload or swap to his kind of crappy secondarys

That would take a while. It takes a while to go from easily wanting to get frags to accepting that you simply got outplayed because of your own fault. Frustration takes time to handle and curb. Most people that complain about spawnpeeking that I see often also get frustrated by the simplest of things, so it's just their character. People take literal ages to change.

2x magnification can be a serious handicap sometimes....
---
they just remove every game from the stats that a cheater took part in. ddos counts as cheating. so if you win against ddosers you will lose this elo. if you soloq and play with ddosers you will lose this elo. if you play with a ddoser that didn't cheat in that particular match because you were winning anyway, you will lose elo.
---
If you lose against them you will get it back obviously. 
---
I lost 350 elo in total, because in the beginning we managed to win against a bunch of ddosers
---
oh you should see some of the idiocy they've suggested
---
I haven't exactly been playing this game long but I've dealt with similar games like this where some things can just be really annoying the stand put example being for Honor tub kind of build up a hey everything is counterable if you're good enough mentality
---
More like Rhett

You covered yourself in butter for a tactical advantage so you could crawl through the hole.

Casual doesn't count, some other players can join the match. I'm talking about ranked, where if you leave you can rejoin. In my case no one ever joined those matches

This would work better for a defensive operator and change it to 1 hive but make it somewhat loud

I think it can and would work on attack, it would just take a little finesse as it doesn‚Äôt provide instant healing but over the long term, would be just as, if not stronger than normal heals
---
Heck yes
---
It‚Äôs the same behavior, if you say, add points for kills, to the point system, people will be going out of their way to steal kills, bait teammates, recklessly chasing kills when they should play for time, etc...

They are on rotation, bc there are too many maps in the game right now. Next season they will come back plus the new Themepark in exchange for 3 other maps I believe.

Last night was just the worst. Wanted to come home and unwind, but my ping kept shooting up to like 1k+. Even across a few games. And I was the only one, none of my buddies had any issues. I'm wondering if it's my local net then.
---
Remove both grips and add acog. Will never be op and it would be the ultimate disrespect
---
If you try to communicate over voice chat ends in endless chaos and thru chat nobody answers - and if then not in English
---
Maybe it should ignore Rook's armor plates?
---
go commit die
---
Well usually I want to see if there‚Äôs anyone behind the hole I just made, otherwise I‚Äôd wait for them to punch a hole
---
&gt; giving it a much longer range
---
The drop of damage is still whack though.
---
th...this was a meme?
---
Do one tier a day. Get it in no time.
---
 Nice! Lol
---
The Second should have killed him
---
For a second I thought that was Zironic xD
---
Very cool art!
---
Oh sorry my bad man
---
Either that or disable collision for parts you knock off and let them phase through the floor or something.
---
Select fire does not mean full auto
---
what does that mean
---
thats a filter
---
Yeah just IG meme pages are the worst. I like to keep my memes on Reddit, my drama on Twitter, and my dog pics on IG.
---
But In attack you cant anchor so it is not reasonable as most teams do not stay close together finka is better because there is unlimited range
---
Is it just me or do the rewards aside from the ring blow? I know it's free but ffs.
---
Want to try that again?

So no sweat?
---
then so does EVERYONE ELSE
---
Well a witch burns and so does wood. Wood floats and so does a duck. So if she weighs as much as a buck she is a witch
---
That secure was close tho lol
---
No sweat
---
Shields definitely don‚Äôt need any help right now
---
Nah,it‚Äôs good b.
---
–ë–û–°–ì –ê–ö–û–ì
---
Siege was still banned after that altered version they released?
---
Jesus. I'm lucky enough to have access to fiber so my ping sits at like 12-15ms with spikes only putting it around 20-25. But after playing for so long on a 144hz monitor going sub 60 honestly give me a headache whole trying to aim. Last night was pretty funky though too compared to the rest of the previous week. Not sure if something was up in particular.
---
they‚Äôre never going to add it though because they are going to be worried about the spawn peeking with it and ubi hates spawn peeking üò≠
---
i don‚Äôt get it what‚Äôs the point of this video
---
Ayup
---
now I've seen some weird shit on this sub but this death quite literally feels like it has no explanation
---
i think there used to be an old bug where if tachanka got killed on his turret or something like that, anyone else who tries to use the turret instantly dies. I thought it got patched tho
---
She had rook armour on
---
The tcsg doesn't one shot to the upper chest. The bosgacog would be a monstrosity that makes vigil literally the most powerful defender for spawn peeks which is the last fucking thing this game needs rn.
---
oldelarecoilwitha25to30roundmag
---
Complaining about kill stealing is dumb as hell.
---
It makes him worthless. The only time he is ever played is to deny flashes.
---
If you're a Rainbow fan and don't watch him, you're missing out lol
---
I would love to have it in the game, just take of the helmet.
---
I'm genuinely curious how this happens. I have to get people to think I just want to be their friend too; maybe I'll be able to get kills that way.
---
Can't see what it says
---
What else is Reddit for?
---
I've played since 2016 and I'm level 181
---
Thanks, I appreciate it.
---
Duly noted! Thanks! ^-^
---
And of course everyone's on their phones, typical millennials
---
Nah, i completely agree with that statement. I use the Spear .308 all the time and have no problems. I don't understand why everyone says it's bad.
---
You could've just turned also though.
---
Did i ask? Lol if I didnt reply, take a hint
---
I genuinely wonder why Ubisoft don't just hire people like this to draw concept art, their concept artists can be really shit sometimes
---
Haha, thank you thank you :)
---
Maybe hide behind a shield?
---
BIG Oof
---
49 damage but it has very sloooow firerate and weird recoil + slow ads
---
Rip the one geez that died
---
Omg you're hilarious. You come at me because I did good and now you're too scared to even reply. Lol, what a world we live in
---
That would be cool
---
What the fuck... I've never seen that lol
---
Gound rood
---
True
---
*tut* nice
---
Isn‚Äôt that LOTR and not Harry Potter?
---
That's good to know, thanks ^^
---
Thanks a lot! :D
---
No u c:
---
Yeah youre so good plat 1 still playing like this even tho you played since 2016. Yeah bro youre a god
---
Thanks for tips aswell ^^
---
Maybe tomorrow or else next week for sure.
---
No you didnt copy me, it was just the same reference with blitz elite and iphone 11 no big deal. Nice post tho
---
That's the plan
---
Year pass owners
---
It got taken down anyways sadly
---
Yes, anything normally rappel-able, she can get to.
---
Whatttt
---
Best charm for Goyo.
---
Mine too, because apparently this sub reddit doesn't like memes
---
Why did they make Bandit bald?
---
Thats my only question
---
üëåüèøüëåüèæüëåüèΩüëåüèºüëåüèª
---
That's because it is specific to Blackbeard as a balancing mechanic.
---
Remember that they added these nerfs before the 160HP Shield?
---
IMHO if anyone else had MK17, it would be like having a shield on 24/7.
---
Umm maybe because it‚Äôs very easily exploitable?? You play in a five stack you take turn for quitting  the game your teammates don‚Äôt lose elo.
---
\#giveBOSGACOG
---
It's cool and all but I hope nothing like this ever gets added into siege unless it's like a fun game mode or something.
---
bruh who hurt you?
---
Thank You for a good amount of informations!
---
I was really wondering about her ability since it's easy to 'know' where is prisma, but the tactic with Mira's windows is kinda nice, yeah ;) 
---
I gotta watch some videos about the playstyle.
---
Btw has Alibi been picked in any tournament? I do not really watch them, but I'm just curious.
---
Wtf ahaha
---
I don‚Äôt hate/like Harry since we still barely know much about him.
---
His gameplay
---
Pre-teens always think they know everything *facepalm*
---
Jet fuel doesn't melt wooden beams.
---
Too soon.
---
We still get alpha packs right?
---
Band of Brothers
---
I missed the old recoil bullshit
---
I just wish I could get from a long day of bullshit to just drain some stress on casual without some sweaty guy fucking my day even more
---
Fair
---
It was in COD4, Chinatown was the same map layout, just different textures.
---
HURAAAAHHHH
---
It would be enough. If the scorpion wasnt the only primary without a recoil diamond giving it a random spread. And it doing the 3rd lowest damage in game.
---
Could just tell the team where the objective is from the start. They then have the option to drone when they're nearer to find out what ops there is.
---
DRUUUUUUGS
---
Classic insta person
---
Love it.
---
Kinda disgusting, kinda champ, and so glad to see Warden finally being put to good use
---
Makes sense. Was it ranked and if so what rank?
---
I just corrected myself
---
This was one of my fave skits.
---
Yer i know and thats sound, i only corrected you as legitimately, thats pretty disrespectful to the uk special forces community. Marines are good operators but they arent all special forces.
---
Currently this is for everyone but they are still in the process of making a paid version
---
Casual is basically death match sadly. If I wanted DM I'd play COD.
---
Nope. Uplay big garbage
---
Ash mains: I hate when people underestimate my fastness, I'm fast, I'm so fast you couldn't even comprehend how fast I am \*proceeds to rush and dies
---
And one ring to find them
---
I didn‚Äôt even notice this
---
And into the fire
---
I'm curious to know exactly what is written inside of it
---
Nope, I know Zofia is married but I'm not sure which ops are widowers or widows.
---
I'm british it's not disrespect it's just a mistake
---
Here‚Äôs something you can do to prevent that as a whole, get a squad. https://squads.tm/game-r6 and r/R6STeams are good places to look.
---
Greek fire
---
Weird how these types of posts show up all the time. What happening is that you are lagging and you have a terrible connection to the server hence the red plug on the top right so there is a huge latency issue so "bugs" are bound to happen  since you aren't connected properly.
---
Ooh that is goood
---
Your right its not as you accepted and realised your mistake and corrected so ill take that comment back. Enjoy your evening.
---
ty
---
Thank you
---
not according to the us government
---
I try not to waste energy arguing with fools.
---
I play compensator always but I switch sights and grips depending on how I feel
---
Idk
---
MPX is love
---
Bruh this shit is DOPE! great job
---
Now the question is what rank are you? Lol cus with this art work I say your rank diamond champion!
---
Yeah i can‚Äôt imagine a 6‚Äô2 woman flying through windows with a grappling hook as much as a can with a  5‚Äô7 woman doing that
---
Echo
---
Fr tho I‚Äôm just trying to chill and have a relaxing time in casual and get matched against 2 fucking plats that sweat like crazy.
---
There aren't many of us out there anymore
---
i was sooooooooooooooo disapointed when finka didnt release with the as-val :(
---
Y he's a great op
---
So does he stuff his beard in his ski mask
---
Really dont understand how he fits that beard. Or the fact that they let him have a bear at all in the military
---
My friend is and a dam good one at that
---
Shut down
---
Wish it was real
---
Potential or you just came up with it
---
S P 0 0 K
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the first one set of the next two?
---
That's what happens when you choose the easy button operator.
---
I didn‚Äôt know Ant Man was an operator?
---
I did they just say nothing, or sorry we cant do anything
---
I was looking for another frost main in here. I don't know about you, but I never mind people finishing. Honestly, I am just excited when I get people with them. But for a three catch round, I get so pumped. 
---
My favorite was a round we had on Plane. I had a trap right on the corner of the hall by the stairs, and you could watch it perfectly from the camera right there. Round got down to 1v1 in the final round, and the last person on the other team was blitz. He was right in front of the trap but didnt see it because he knew our last guy was right around the corner.
---
Everyone was watching the trap through the camera, and I got so excited because someone else said what I wanted to say, "bait him into rushing you."
---
Our last teammate did exactly that and the blitz walked right onto the mat and we won. Probably my favorite r6 memory haha.
---
This looks awesome, only thing that could make it even better is maybe hints of the operators colours threw in there too
---
This is one of the best fan arts I've seen! Really love the pose, shadows, and everything.
---
"You look like shei√üe today."
---
lol nothing's wrong with me
---
i think it's stupid and even more wrong that people are saying fuck China and free Hong Kong for karma. they don't even care about the actual situation, they just want to be part of the "we spread awareness lul xD" even though it's all over the news and reddit has done jack shit to help the situation. yeah, saying that what China's doing isn't bad is kinda fucked up, but I'm making fun of the circlejerk here.
---
Hmmm idk man I like the scanning fingerprints aspect, very creative
---
Win 25 games is the requirement pretty much. Losing gets some points, as does each round you win, but playing perfectly it would take ~25 games to finish
---
Blitz main brother
---
And I don‚Äôt fucking care
---
Oh yeah similar bugs also exist. Suddenly a problem arise in such a way that you move the mouse and your character doesn't change its angle (i.e. doesn't look left, right, up or down) but you can shoot.
---
Smoke is my favorite op, because you can do anything. Similar to mozzie. However smoke has significantly more clutch potential than mozzie.
---
Love it
---
but.. but... bandit is **BALD**
---
Lion fucked his GF, got her pregnant, left her, and now pays child support.
---
Honestly pretty sketchy backstory for him. It was like the devs were trying to write a sob story but it really came off as weird and icky.
---
You're just restating what I've said and have credited it mostly as your own. She does have one yes, but if you couldn't see it the multiple times it was listed. It is so big she basically doesn't hsvd one. The one present one on all other primary weapons does contain the recoil. Within the area it's random but it's not anywhere even close to the scorpion.
---
I‚Äôm not concerned lol
---
They fucked everything a shield op had. They should atleast finish them off and remove them from the game if they are going to nerf them into the ground like they have. If your gana kill something atleast finish the job. Give blitz the commando and a blinding tactical flashlight.
---
Give monty the 308 vector and let him take 1/2 explosive damage or something.
---
Did you wait thill the exit match button popped up during the stats?
---
He dealt drugs
---
Yes pls
---
out in the street
---
How can would a scan of a finger print would block the use of a gadget? Also 1 minute is way to much to not be able to use your gadget.
---
If they're still alive, it's not kill stealing.
---
I've lost too many rounds because people were being "polite" and the frost mat injure ended up getting revied.
---
Hello big_bois_are_bae, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/diuwje/ela_or_mira/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Hows. It going bros my name iz
---
No. Check out "Caustic Customs" on instagram.
---
I agree. Could be interesting as long as they dont make the mags ridiculously noticeable.
---
username checks out
---
Who can? Kapkan
---
Too much RDR2 I see...
---
situational actually. which isn‚Äôt much better than being useless
---
I like that
---
No it‚Äôs castle hahaha
---
finka has a low pick rate yes, but dokkaebi is far from low. must be the rank you‚Äôre at
---
Been awhile since I‚Äôve seen Secure Area. I turned it off on the release of Phantom Sight, or whenever Ranked became Bomb only
---
Thank god it wasn‚Äôt just me
---
here i wrote it again
---
But your the one who multiple times said I was wrong for saying that
---
A. Ela has a recoil diamond
---
B. All guns are random
---
I‚Äôm right about both of those things, and you said the opposite of those things. I didn‚Äôt restate what you said. I said the opposite of what you said
---
This is kind of the same as maverick tho.
---
Yea like used mags aren‚Äôt something I ever even thought about, tbh I don‚Äôt even know if they disappear
---
I thought that was the hot pink one.
---
looks sorta like zironic
---
plat 3 on pc not picked that much.
---
He really needs a buff.
---
Maybe his clock could work like the Jager's ADS, a human ADS. Once Jager is unique, this buff would bring us a new alternative against frags
---
I don't know about this because of the fact that some of these sites are just purely better than others which may cause an issue with pay to win, however I think skins for the attachments like a different suppressor or maybe the original tan holographic site could be good. As well as different looking grips. But allowing an ash to use something like clashes red dot could cause issues.
---
Yah sortod but you don't have to put it in door ways only
---
We all know characters would end up invisible and all pistols would have acogs. 
---
Go for it
---
Ive only seen one prototype for M5 tipx adapters. If this was an M17, id put a vector body kit on it and use zeta mags. (Hint, I already have)
---
interesting. maybe it‚Äôs different since I‚Äôm on console? I hover at gold 1 and plat 3 and I‚Äôm hard pressed to go through a game where she‚Äôs not brought at least 2 rounds or so
---
!claimcharm
---
you said it is. you said im an ass because i smurf. am i an ass? i only play on my main with a 5 stack because its my comp account and i want a good rank on that account.
---
Maybe after a month break go back to vert for a little while
---
You just said your other acc is on the same elo. So you are not a smurf and not a ass. God damn
---
Took: "Yeah, me too."
---
I care
---
The End

We are

Nothing changes, except that you waste an emp

SMG-12
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
would i be an ass if my second account was gold q instead of plat 2?
---
That looks sick is there anywhere I can buy it
---
You still don't seem to understand context which i just gave you. That's actually kinda sad.
---
LOL I wish
---
Nice job. Now lets hope you got some epic camo‚Äôs for me.
---
Heheheh good, thanku!!
---
The fact that he thermited a soft wall next to a reinforced wall and killed himself at the same time. Smh
---
Did a FULL Windows Reinstall. Used Windows Tool &amp; made a Bootable USB and Fresh Install.
---
Re-downloaded &amp; Re-Bought the Game. 5 matches in, Right at 1hr of PVP playtime. Got a ban. Had 33 Kills total.
---
This is such a GREAT game. i love it.
---
Basically me this morning, but my sheets are a mess and I'm depressed as fuck.
---
 ‚Äú...the future of Rainbow‚Äù sounds bigger than just an operator, no ?
---
Yes you would be. Because you are intending to playing against weaker people.
---
you do know you can lean in this game?
---
PERFECT
---
Nope
---
Or how about just using the PMM? It does dmr level damage already
---
**HUMILIATION**
---
See here ladies and gentlemen. The exact reason why echo gets banned 100% of the ranked games. Tadaaaaa
---
u/yung-husk... I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Can these not make a comeback?
---
I know, I usually do. I actually don't know why I didn't.
---
r/warframe is leaking again
---
but i dont do it on purpose i just dont wanna lose a good rank on my comp account? or maybe i wanna see how far i can get on my own? im still trying to win, im still a good part of the match. am i an ass?
---
It's because of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/InterroTalks/status/1184570190350245888)
---
You're doubting that I care when you dont even know me. Dont listen to this guy OP he reeks of ego.
---
Lol
---
# B O S G A C O G
---
They specifically said semi automatic weapons. Or.. well i suppose you could do that but equipping the acog turns your MP5K into a SP5K :)
---
Personally her SMG with a red dot. It works well with getting headshots, especially if you ain't center mass
---
Well, if your second account is on the elo you belong to there's nothing wrong with it.
---
Is kaids shotgun not enough for those people?
---
The as valk would be a great gun to play with
---
I use SMG 12 holo but for console I would use c7
---
Imagine running from spawn just to get killed by a spawn peeking Blackbeard
---
Fuck off stop defending this low effort shitpost. 
---
"i like it when the community I'm a part of is shit"
---
-No one ever
---
Awesome
---
I would love this as a headgear.
---
Well that's lovely
---
Half the matches are either full of plats and diamonds (which I definitely am not) who are so far ahead in the game that it makes my lack of knowledge of room names and callouts pitiful to listen to, and the other half just vote kick you cos you opened your mouth. That seems to be the way of siege as a solo player, there *never* seems to be a time where I'm balanced with the ranks and levels of my teammates, I'm either matched with a team of xXSn1perG0dXxs who installed the game yesterday, or thrown into a team of elite 1000+ hour diamonds, there's no inbetween.
---
Oil painting?
---
What else have you tried
---
Yeah but somethings makes less sense than others. Keeping out the realistic aspect. This won‚Äôt be very useful, most of the times the magazines will be outside of obj and not in a very nice place for you to go scan them. It won‚Äôt help warden that much.
---
Ubi pls make this work
---
so smurfers are only assholes if they willingly try to fuck with lower ranks? because then yes, id agree. but saying people who buy soloqueue accounts are assholes is just wrong, they want to win aswell and try their hardest.
---
don't
---
Yep, within the next 8-10 days from memory.
---
All looking at their phones except the 3 who enjoy the moment. Smh this generation is fucked
---
I already spend too much time in a hospital
---
In the foot it will be maybe 4-5. Look rogue 9 maybe he did a video about the d-50.
---
Reminds me of TheHumbleNoob (YouTube)
---
Mate just went thru and downvoted all his most recent posts on his profile. Who‚Äôs laughin now
---
DO NOT ATTEM TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER
---
Oh, you‚Äôre approaching me?!
---
Zophia has the better gadget anyway
---
Something about 556 not penetrating body armor is what prompted gign to switch. 7.62x39 is the version they got.
---
Don't mind him, he's probably one of them incels.....He always holds the door for women, why won't they date him?????
---
Really? Ok thanks man
---
Wish they nerfed it and in exchange us Ela mains can  now remove the sight on the Polish pistol.
---
Im fairly certain i kill 4 shots on 3 armors with suppressed d50
---
That second photo is my face before pelting my teammates with my cams
---
Lmao saw like 10 times. Laughed every time.
---
it‚Äôs fine as it is tbh it‚Äôs just a no skill brainless gun any one can use. it‚Äôs only good for like 4 m outside that you can easily kill them as it won‚Äôt do much damage
---
Wow, guy on Reddit makes fun of another redditor for not being invited to parties. Isn‚Äôt this the most ironic comment of the year.
---
The damage in the foot is extremely low. I once tried with the magnum ish of nomad and I shot a good 4 shots in the foot and he didn‚Äôt die
---
Hi r/ihavereddit
---
bruh my do all of you guys sound like 5 year olds ü§î
---
No you're ignorant. They don't license half the guns in the game that's the whole point. That's why the tweet you posted is BS.
---
Do people actually get paid to cosplay; or is it just a hobby?
---
Just like a lot of Valkyrie players
---
AHH right, I mean that's also easy isn't it? They push from two angles, they can't aim and get stuck in doors and walls although I agree you get basically no renown
---
When I play its lion instead of blitz
---
lol
---
This community is toxic and so are you. This post was made to hopefully spread a bit more positivity
---
Wow okay
---
Well you can‚Äôt regenerate Hp. The first few rounds are easy but maybe round 3-4 they start aiming for the hostage and they destroy reinforced walls. Solo it‚Äôs really hard but in a squad of fairly easy.
---
WHIS GONNA COME OUT THE POKEBALL?
---
dont play if you get butt hurt and this post isnt gonna change anything so what even is the point
---
Ok this is cute.
---
ah i see. well your missin out on some quality fun mdude
---
The Deagle suppressed is a 3 shot to 3 Armor, 3 Armor + Rook armor, and 2 Armor + Rook Armor. 
---
1 armors take 100% damage, 2 armors take 90% and 3 armors take 80%. 3 armors + rook armor take 64%. Rook armor upgrades armor one class.
---
Edit: also, shots to anywhere besides the head do body damage. No limb modifiers.
---
Just for fun :) some people get paid I think but for like appearances and tabling at con or whatever
---
Same

Tysm

I mostly enjoy his content, he certainly is about as average as a player can get imo

That is sick as hell

lmfao

thanks for that

Attach two wheels,call it a cannon

Me when I pick Valk vs me when my stupid ass runs out a minute after drone phase is over to get an "elite" camera
---
I have 2 legendary charms, the alpha pack one and the knight helmet, it hurts but I have black ice on: Bucks AR, F2 ,SMG 11, FMG and the sweet sweet J√§ger AR. I have the elite skin as well but I‚Äôm not a j√§ger main, I just play him if I play roam
---
A Greek Map would be cool too. Athens, the island of  Santorini
---
Thanks hun

Santa? Is that you?

Watch out got Kaid

What the fuck is this?

Yes BlackBeard it‚Äôs be St Maverick
