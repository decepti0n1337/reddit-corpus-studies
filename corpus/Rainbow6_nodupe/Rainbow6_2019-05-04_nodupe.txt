Still fairly new at the game and haven't done a lot of PvP, aside from a few casual matches. Twice there were some teammates on voice chat giving me a few tips during the match and I was thankful for it. Other than that I've been team killed, cursed at in chat and yelled at in voice chat, which is why I'm reluctant to do PvP. It's not that it I feel bullied, but that I actually want to have a fun time and chill with some friends in casual and the amount of insanity some players have makes it awful
---
---
---
It was literally nerfed in January
---
I kinda feel like you didn't... I kindaa feel like you don't know what a shitpost is. you see its not a literal shit-post, maybe look it up again I think you may have spelt it wrong
---
Damage drop off has already been done and adjusted. The pistol already has been adjusted with recoil as well. Don’t let them sneak up on you and it’s really not an issue
---
One second
---
You need to get fairly close with cav to kill people, so if you cant roam well you cant get close due to being caught out, decent cavs are scary though
---
Reload animation is so cool though
---
She’s not a healer. The only heal she does is when she revives someone. Every other instance is just a temp 20 hp.
---
I don’t like the points system that r6 has implemented because it would happen to me all the time. I’d win 2 games and get to say gold 4 from silver 1 and the lose a game due to bad teammates and be back where I started. I gave up
---
Im not talking operators, im talking about the bugs in there game that need to be fixed and i'm trying to bring attention to those and put a little more priority on fixing their bugs instead of the new ops.
---
There are rifle shields for semi-automatic rifles and sniper rifles, however there is nothing like the plexiglass lookin shit BB uses, most rifle shield are too heavy to walk with so that why they are used in these Semi-automatic rifles

You should play ranked, you’ll get destroyed in your first placements but after you do you be matched with people with the skill as you and you’ll improve much more than just playing casual
---
I’ve been getting 5 points and losing 25
---
Yep. Get used to it.
---
I have the same question, got mozzie a day ago and i’m just switching between the guns not knowing which one is better. Currently I like the Roni because it’s so simple and the sight is cool, but all my friends say to use the Commando. Any mozzie mains out there to help me out?
---
I’m nearly level 300 but I haven’t had matchmaking this bad before.
---
I can deal with TK and toxicity in casual. It’s common but not sustainable, so it’s not really a game ruiner for me. Plus The amount of stupidity in casual (usually by platinum MnK smurfs), occasionally warrants the TK. Also if They are MnK without a doubt, I TK them. MnK smurfs on the other hand, I encounter every game, and they absolutely ruin the game. Pretty much every casual game I play is an MnK, typically smurf or boosting.
---
being proud of pedophilia isn't a harmless joke lol
---
YESSSSSSS
---
For some odd reason. She's a solid OP already with decent guns and good ability. You'd think she'd be the next Ash with her win rate but nobody plays her
---
Boosters and Smurf’s. A lot of them, especially if you’re anywhere near decent.
---
We going back to these low effort posts again...?
---
This is Reddit. I'm sure plently would laugh about it
---
People upvote because they like it. Someone spent hours working on this content for you to sadistically cast it aside w/ a hateful comment. Tired of seeing shitty comments like this on this sub. Parents need to start raising their children proper
---
I disagree in a sense. So let’s grant that Ubi has started allowing MnK on console (99.9999% chance this never happens and I will explain why later). 
---
PC does not segregate controller players and MnK players... so why should console? That is my first question. 
---
Second, what would splitting the player base do for the population of console? Especially on games that aren’t as well populated as Siege. 
---
Concerning the first question. PC has it right here. You are allowed to use whatever peripheral you want... as long as it doesn’t edit the game code (or whatever definition we want to use for aimbotting/wallhacking, etc). It is up to the user to use whatever they like best or whatever is more comfortable (with the exception of macros). 
---
Why should console be any different (funny enough rapid fire mods and macros ARE allowed on console via licensed controllers)? Because that is how its always been ? Is that a good answer?
---
Who are you to say what peripheral I can use? Why is it my problem that I want to use a better peripheral for the job (in this case a MnK for fps)? If you want to use a controller that is fine... If I want to use a mouse that should be fine... If you choose to use something that is generally inferior for an fps game but you prefer it that is fine. Btw, you can plenty easily comfortably play MnK on your couch now (even Microsoft/Xbox and Razer have teamed up for this. 
---
So why wouldn’t a AAA developer (for fps) allow a native MnK? First, splitting the user base just isn’t a great solution. Unless you have a super healthy and consistent population your game will dwindle. Why not put console MnK users with PC ala Fortnite? You then destroy for the console MnK players why the console is a great choice... a secure network to keep true hackers out. Second, because most people just have a not thought out view point on the matter which is console = controller and PC = MnK (which it isn’t!) A developer will never allow MnK to mingle amongst controller players for this reason. It would hurt their image and they would get massive backlash.
---
We are going to be in this stupid thing where Sony/Microsoft don’t give a fuck about MnK users (which they shouldn’t anyways like PC) because they have officially licensed MnKs! So developers are left with dealing with (and I am sure many/most developers also have this backwards view) of dealing with people whining over and over.
---
Nice
---
Stop being a toxic player then maybe they would reset

 But it’s casual
---
It takes a while to pick your soda
---
Yeah
---
Well in the game its just called scope so I don't really know.
---
Did you run out of ammo?
---
It doesn’t matter my dude some people don’t want to play ranked and players like you make the game unfun.
---
Bro those are sick. Keep it up! You’re killin it
---
No players who play casual like it’s ranked makes it boring af
---
*Aurthor Fists Intensifies
---
Bartlett, dat U?!
---
I got tkd today and I believe it was because they called a vote kick on me during 1v1 and I won... the toxicity is palpable.
---
I get that and it’s annoying. What I’m saying is some people just unwind a little and don’t want the sweatiness if ranked. People that treated casual as ranked do get on my nerves as well
---
These are badass!
---
My 1.9 kd with ela shotgun + laser says you’re wrong
---
Thanks did my best
---
Why wasn’t it a draw?
---
Exactly why they deserve to be put down like a fucking sick dog
---
it really do be like that 😔
---
I'd assume so, but I bet it's not made of plastic wrap. More made of the stuff Rook uses.
---
Alternatively you could just leave and not have to worry about the ban. I’m just trying to say don’t be toxic and get banned then wonder why your ban is taking so long
---
I don’t know. Human sacrifice hasn’t worked for me, how about you?
---
Highly skilled opponents you had there
---
I've only seen Tactikiwi for a minute and a half, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself.
---
83 same hipfire and 1x sights but acogs will be something like 25% slower.
---
If you raise the ads sensitivity above 83 your acog's sensitivity will increase but hipfire and 1x will still be 1:1 (still not able to do 1:1 to hipfire with acogs unless you change the xfactoraiming multiplier in the .ini file)
---
Most of the time you think you hit a headshot, you didn’t.
---
Thx dude
---
Right, what you should've done all those ywars ago when you first got your xbox was get a PC. No offense but a selling point of a console is a controller. If you wanna simulate the feel of MnK play on high sensitivity. It's outright scummy to use MnK because it gives an unfair disadvantage the enemy team and takes the fun out of the game for them. At the end of the day if you wanna play MnK, play fortnite.
---
You missed 5 shots and missed seeing his foot that sticking out. 
---
He timed and pre-fired with a quick flick. 
---
Frame by frame made sense.
---
Maverick is great for taking out people if they're holding angles and not moving if you can make a line of sight as well as helping your team out when they're distracting so you can pick up a free kill or two and Maestro cams should be on indestructible surfaces so they can't be destroyed as easily and remember they aren't the easiest to destroy without the right ops so know that you have an easy cam on them without them doing shit about it. His recoil is a pain so spraying is never a bad idea, by camp down near obj is my favorite strat and prefiring angles because you have those cams. They're also great to prevent breaching in because they can destroy hard breachers gadgets. Best of luck and I hope this helped!
---
Either this is Copper IV or just luck. My opponents be tryharding in a casual.
---
peeky holes with mav, and place maestro's where ever you think it'll be good to either get the thermite charges or stop a plant
---
That solution definitely works for Fortnite because they have so many people playing it. I don’t think splitting the playerbase will work for most other games though.
---
Looks sick! What you gonna use it for?
---
Fellow SAS main lol. No problem.
---
The BSOD will give you an error code. Next time write it down
---
Different strokes for different blokes. If it works for you by all means rock it. Seems like a lot of scrolling. Does the fire rate keep up with the scroll speed?
---
I know, that was sarcasm :D
---
Mods?
---
I hate fortnite so no and i used to have a PC before it broke so thats why i didnt buy one when i got the xbox. And all my friends were on xbox not PC. Tho i would love to have one and am saving up. I just want to play MnK earlier
---
theres plenty of ways to promote you and your content, but just saying "hey sub to me" is the worst kind.
---
Sorry for the confusion
---
Lol this is just casual. I wasn't trying to post it to flex or anything mainly to show how all they had to do was shoot me instead of going for the knife kill.
---
Good old fashioned casual
---
They have a way. ME. Every third fucking goddamn game I play. That’s a bullshit argument. Put a moderator into the games. I’ll do it for free. I’ll even do it in spectator so there’s no bias.
---
No worries man. I’ve been drinking myself so I didn’t think about the mains next to names lol
---
Up to a certain point it keeps up so it makes the pistol fire as fast as Ubisoft wants it to.
---
Lol
---
Again, on paper, it might seem like an amazing thing but I can assure you it isn't that simple. Fortnite was able to split their servers based on the number of players they have, if Ubisoft was to remove these players from console ranked the wait times for higher ranks would double or triple. I will never understand the stigma behind PC being expensive when factoring the price of a console + subscription it really isn't much cheaper.
---
Ok thanks
---
Fuck no lol
---
I don't know how to break it to you but it's never going to happen. If you wanna play MnK you can, like I've mentioned before you can buy an adapter that tricks the console into think the MnK is a controller. But remember you'll be the reason nobody will have fun in those matches you're in, another reminder people will literally tk you over it. Heres some advice: Just dont bother with MnK and play console like a decent human being and use a controller; Alternatively save up money and buy a PC, that way you can keep your xbox so you're not ditching your friends.
---
No, the idea that aspect ratios change your skill level is placebo. Stop being a smart ass.
---
Yeah but all my friends are on one platform id be lonly af if i bought a PC
---
Fair
---
I do this so much with Kaid and I feel so bad when it happens
---
Just see it from someone elses perspective, its a dick move to do it and even Ubi have said it. Just do what you want but know what you're doing isn't appreciated. Anywhere.
---
All that matters is you got the job done. Those were acceptable casualties.
---

9/10 I throw down my electroclaw down first as kaid and then some idiot puts his shit down in it and then blames me

He didn't see me until I came around the corner lmao. He just knew where I was due to me interrogating his teammate, I would prefire that as well. It's not the hard to figure out.
---
lmaoooooo
---
In PL it’s disabled and they don’t get the notifiers so they play without so they don’t rely on it for information. Sometimes you can spot the bomb. And get +50 and think you downed someone while shooting, not having points avoid that confusion. 
---
The only way they know if they get a down is physically seeing it or droning it. They still get the kill feed though.
---
Because people are sheep and they regurgitate anything a streamer/youtuber/“pro”player says
---
What was he trying to do there?
---
i actually do only play secure bomb is a scary place some times
---
This is the vapid analysis I've ever read. Jäger and Ash have 2 similarities 3 speed and being fan favorites. That's it, Jäger has one of the best guns on defense and it's the only operator that can stop nades and projectiles, he's literally the only one, no one can do his job. On the other side you have Ash, that literally shoots 2 breaching charges, that's half of what Zofia does, that's something you can accomplish on walls and floors with Sledge and Buck way better and many times over, that's something a well timed nades will also do ( adding Finka to the whole equation ). Her kit isn't special, she doesn't offer anything you can't find on many other ops. There are many 3 speed with great guns, IQ has a gun pretty much as good AND will detect electronics, something Ash doesn't do. While a wide range of OPs can take on the role of Ash if needed the opposite is just false. That doesn't mean she doesn't have a very good gun and can't frag out thanks to the 3 speed but you literally need to forget about every other attacker to claim she brings anything exclusive to the team
---
It's one thing of you're just playing with friends and just playing it's another to be posting LFG coppers only
---
Yea i feel like the most toxicity is in secure area
---
absolutely
---
I like them
---
Dont you love team killing
---
although i don't play hostage so i guess i can't say for sure
---
only when necessary
---
Outstanding mo... I mean artwork.
---
Controller on pc?
---
I was a low gold maybe silver level player but all my friends were high plat so they carried me to low plat and honestly this is the type of shit I would pull. They’d be on objective and I’d be off doing some random dumb shit and end up with 3 kills and a confused other team.
---
"Do you like hurting other people?"
---
Hostage is basicaly first round your defending one person on your team kills the hostage then leaves
---
lol
---
ha
---
Could we get a download for the files. If not I don’t blame you, you worked hard to make cool coasters and that’s your artwork to give out or keep.
---
I don’t understand
---
Is this a pasta?
---
Most people on unranked hostage have no idea what there doing
---
And lets add 75 stim pistols just cuz we can
---
And Valkarie cameras instead of nitro cell
---
I thought my accuracy with Glaz was bad.
---
i mean free easy kills i guess but the game mode kinda sucks so trade off i guess
---
Yea pepole you can literaly walk over
---
Did he? Where?
---
Yep. I came from xbox's R6 so I'm used to it even though I put myself at a disadvantage
---
Yea you can walk over most matches
---
I saw someone today called like "CthuluFan" with a few thousand ping
---
If I had an alpha pack for every time an enemy made a stupid play, yet I still died, because I wouldn't expect anyone to do something dumb like that, I probably wouldn't get any Black Ice lol.
---
good way to break the game and make it the most defender sided game ever(imagine having flashbangs thermal scopes being able to control echo and maestro turrets after they die) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
no thanks
---
Oh wait it’s actually you, I didn’t realize that lol. How’s it goin man?
---
this community has some of the lowest players i’ve ever met, it’s insane
---
“OOOOOH KILL EM”
---
Working as intended
---
Isn’t that literally what doc does tho..?
---
It really is. I've for sure met a lot of toxic players in other games (for honor, csgo, even Warframe) and a lot of them are very bad. But some of the ones here in R6 are just too damn crazy.
---
Good evil eye spot

1.0 siege was also fun

* Damage: 40

---
* Capacity: 35
---
A defender with a 540 dps weapon the same dps as IQs primary? ye that seems really balanced Ash Jager mains would turn into Ash Mr Black mains instantly and never even touch the gadget
---
Same thing happened to me earlier today lol I was big bamboozled
---
Thought they were 4 min
---
Didn't try it, but i'm not sure if a 1 speed can get up there. Couldn't get on top of the shelf next to the door with rook tho. Might try later
---
Not necessarily, because against a team of hard breachers which will breach fast, and on small maps, he’s near useless. Plus. He would only realistically receive one or two intelligible and useable readings every 30 seconds in a 3min round.
---
Happened to our team on skyscraper last season.  1v1 and the last guy was laying down in the middle of the hallway floor between the bombsites at tea room.  Our entire team including the last player alive on our team thought it was just a dead body, but nope, dude legitimately was laying in the middle of the damn hallway.
---
i guess the ability to reliably and safely teamkill and be a prick in any way possible is too much for some people to handle
---
I wish they just remove the 3D modes from the main menu. It really put the GPU at 90+100% load for no reason.

He’s not op at all imo, his shields feel like plastic wrap  and don’t make that big of a difference if you can aim properly
---
Hey! Happy Cake Day and May the Fourth be with you!
---
I would just back the f out. No way I'm playing with these idiots.

Yes, your teammate was helping the opposition
---
Spoken like a true copper. I cant count the number of times I've lost gunfights cause of those retarded shields he has

That’s a bit op
---
Do you really want a healer on the attacker side?? Imagine you get a Montagne one shot and he pulls back and gets healed by his teammate, doesn’t sound like a good time to me
---
Maybe check which server you’re in. When I play in European servers there’s a fair amount of ping no matter what I do, and when I play local it’s always pretty good.
---
You didn’t read this
---
Yeah good points, I'd side with you there
---
Hopefully there is still room for this op considering the Dane that is coming in next season

I don't even know how to switch my servers, does it randomly switch sometimes?

Well said for the first part. Btw saying someone is toxic is pretty toxic but that's a different discussion.

No you think blackbeard isnt op so you are copper. What do you play on? Console? Lol
---
I called the "act" toxic. I don't know the person enough to call them Toxic.

How i feel after coming back to the ranked game i left for tendie time with mummy.

If there was news about new ops it would be at the top of the sub. There are only op idea posts (which btw is a legitimate post) because we're on the tail end of a season and awaiting pro league where the new ops always get shown off

You are seriously misunderstood on how you think game development works. If you think it's easy to make a change like this to a core part of the game you're mistaken. What seems simple to the end user is more often than not extremely complicated. Even if they had finished implementing it before the end of year 3 it's a better idea to give yourself more time than you need. This season they worked on reverse friendly fire on the TTS so they can have it ready for S2 when they remove the beta tag from ranked
---
Look great! Should do em all! Are thosee operators just your fav?
---
STL file please
---
I think glaz is one of the most annoying operators with his sniper.
---
Aww, yay! Your comment made my night. :)

Though it's true that it's snappy after a while. 
---
Do idiots own siege? Samsung or apple doesn't find in the discussion at all.

The context is just the kool aid ads....

No, people like you are cynical and baron.

If you don’t know how to knife and get some ones attention in a less toxic way. You are what’s wrong with this game.

---
I tried having it unplugged but unfortunately that does not fix it
---
I did everything, even closed every app i could running on my pc, unplugging my keyboard while testing, testing with a different mouse and even moved the game to a different drive but nothing helps.
---
Use your good aim to headshot her first
---
That's why I love playing Cav on Consulate, Kanal, and Kafe especially. The sound works well for me and I can get around really easily.
---
Having good aim whilst spawn peeking also helps, but that's another subject 😂

Godamn you just don’t shut up do you?
---
According to the latest stats, Rook has the 2nd highest win rate among the defenders at ~1.6%. While stats aren't everything he's been near the top by a noticeable margin for a long time. He doesn't need a buff.
---
It is an issue with buttons on controllers. Currently there are not enough buttons to usefully make it possible.
---
You idea with the A or on PlayStation X button is counterintuitive as it requires you to take your finger off the aim stick to lean.
---
There is no way I could think off that would enable it without screwing up the whole layout. You could of course move away knife and sprint, but where to?
---
An idea might be to only enable sprint when going forward and leaning left when going left or right. Knifing could be set as a double tap so that leaning right would be necessary to knife....you see the issue.
---
Before paddles arent a thing on default console controllers (maybe next gen) there won’t be such a thing.
---
This aim hurts my eyes
---
Nope, you’re wrong. 5v1 is NOT a guaranteed loss for them. I’ve clutched so many 1v5 rounds and seen others do it also. Don’t ever think numbers is a guaranteed win.
---
It’s clash lol
---
idk how can you yeet that drone literaly meters from the obj and sometimes the window is not even barricaded
---
The same argument has been used over and over again for reinforcing certain walls LIKE IN KIDS ROOM. 
---
It doesn’t matter what it is, teamkilling for what you view is right is a thin line. Congrats on his quick wit, but it starts next game with “he might try and tk me back, so someone needs to cover me and kill him if you have to”. 
---
It’s still toxic, regardless.
---
Not saying he’s awful for doing it.
---
But it’s not an advantage, but some people won’t like it.

No they do not you have the odd one but usually you mute them. They never help
---
In fact the system is only there to get you a “better matchmaking experience” the addition of ranks and rewards for ranks to this system not meant to be a ranking system, added a motivation to abuse it and because it is not a ranking but a matchmaking system it is easy to abuse.

Check the YT video by rogue 9.
---
Pretty risky without an ads
---
Does anyone actually use that in combat?
---
If one were to encase them in a clear resin they’d be really cool
---
Knifing to get someone’s attention does NOT work. I try this every single time and every single time I have to kill them before they finish doing whatever stupid thing it is they are doing. 
---
If they are new I will explain why I had to kill them in a message. If they choose to get butthurt over it, then that’s their own issue.
---
Wait I'm sorry am I missing something is that a acog on the smg 11
---
Whoops, oh well
---
51 bullets. 1000 firerate. 29 damage(I think). No recoil. A place-and-forget gadget that screws the enemy's aim, sprinting, vision and sound, and used to last longer and she had 4 of them. U N I Q U E.
---
yeah I got 20 points for getting back to gold, but was at 2550 and got hit down to 2494
---
Rogue 9 just did a YT video on that, watch it
---
Grammar Nazi

You can only be revived once.

I wonder who got the joke.
---
You’re a little late to this one my guy
---
New players will learn then won’t they? If I have to kill a new player for something I will explain why I had to do it so that they know for the future. 
---
Also, 5v1 don’t mean shit. I’m guessing you’re in low ranks because if you were a good player you would know that a 5v1 doesn’t mean you automatically win that round. I’ve clutched 1v5 rounds against Diamond teams in ranked.
---
Rarely when I used to have not all of them I had all ops for two games or so. I always thought it would be so could try out some of them or is it a bug?
---
how long is this a thing
---
I had one win gold 2, 10 points, dropped 98, each time for 4 loses
---
Since the beginning of this season. It was there when the map was released
---
Team killing tends to beget team killing. I played a round where a random got teamkilled by my friend (random shot my friend through a wall so my friend reacted by shooting back in a 2v2 danger-close situation). Random team kills my friend next round (2nd OT), so my OTHER friend avenged him, leaving us 2 on 5 on defense instead of just letting it go. Had high likelihood of winning that round since we were winning a lot on defense.
---
damm

Also they’re usually in a party.

"5Head people rushing to the comments to say casual for no reason"

Read over before posting
---
I was looking to do some recording of gameplay and whatnot, but nothing really intense.
---
I was looking to start at around 800 (my friends have all built PCs and said this would be a good starter price but idk)
---
I tried this, it's real, I just had to scam them before they scammed me, it's like peaking, you gotta be prepared to die.
---
Still it's fucking casual on console so a 1v5 is basicly a win
---
oh, it wasn't me, I rarely up or downvote anything on reddit, dunno why but kind used from 9 gag, only comment and sometimes post, but I'll upvote now, to repent someone's downvote :D
---
Bruh sound effect #2

I haven’t played in a while, but I don’t think airman works that way. When you shoot your last shot, you still have to manually switch back to your gun.
---
Yeah so lived in lie until this moment
---
:(
---
That's his ability though. It's not OP, you just have to use different tactics to disable him. That's how the game is supposed to be played.
---
The absolute disgustingly accurate hip fire on shields was so fun to abuse, but so nasty to play against haha
---
Good times!
---
I swear somebody posted just this clip when Hibana first got changed at the start of the season

Just from an objective standpoint, if you arent overclocking that 1600x, you might be CPU bottlenecked. Just speaking from experience :) but yeah I have trouble too sometimes but usually stay at 120.

In ranked, most people talk as long as you’re around plat but mot in casual
---
It had an acog. It was removed in Year 1 season 4.
---
That’s all fine and dandy, but the uncooked throw takes way too long to go off. I’m fine with them not instantly going off, but awkwardly waiting outside of a door for 5 seconds after throwing one really deflated the excitement and energy from the push.
---
I’m cool with them not being instant anymore, but it’d be nice if they also removed just 1 second from the overall detonation time.
---
To all the idiots saying no one has a mic. You’re idiots. The reason you don’t see people chatting in game is because Xbox has a beautiful thing called Xbox party chat. No one uses game chat anymore.
---
Maybe they tweak that in the future but Ubisoft balances around Pro League and there she was way too strong.
---
More like airDAB amirite fellas
---
AHAHAHAHA LOL. Nice shot
---
Not disagreeing at all, but I don’t think going from 5 seconds to 4 would re-break her in PL.
---
What
---
Just kill em
---
damn
---
My history teacher needs to step up his game
---
Who cares  about Romeo and Juliet when we have this

I mean, the attackers are suppose to pop the cap of the hostage, while in this clip I guess even the defenders got tired of their jobs.
---
amazing dude
---
BeTa
---
These are rad. I'd love to get a Maverick and Echo one! I gotta figure out how to use a 3D printer 🤔
---
Redundant because we can see the ammo go from 21 to 20, meaning the airjab didn't kill him regardless.
---
thought maybe someone knew what the Brawl stars subreddit was
---
Why would you bring it up here though?
---
Yes i know but u dont have to be all triggered about it
---
Takes one to know one
---
What do you call high ranks? I play low to mid plat and every time I queue without my team of 5 and it’s like 3 of us and we get 2 randoms 80% of the time they are mindless ash/Monty mains

Dwayne the rock Johnson as tachanka

Yet, it happened the first month usually.

2080 and a 9700 can confirm get frame drops. I do have the ultra texture pack installed tho

Most plat 3’s don’t deserve plat... so it’s a gold vs gold game
---
Brian dechart as ari
---
The last part is exactly my point. Instead of just bashing ubisoft we should start reporting and being nice. Assholes will stay the same but the rest should think how they behave.
---
my speech. Its the person, not the console.
---
Yea I have had two trades since wind bastion and only one before which was forever ago.
---
Just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean everybody should.

Because Battlefield and Siege has the same recoil...

Cheating in video games involves a video game player using non-standard methods to create an advantage or disadvantage beyond normal gameplay, in order to make the game easier or harder.

Actually, they use 19 rnds trying to kill Mira, leaving 21 in mag. He uses the last air jab, and shoots 1 bullet which just so happens to be a lucky headshot.
---
I do have a good pc so maybe it me.
---
But that's not the point. You can attach everything on page making it simpler and faster
---
I use shotcut. It’s free but I don’t know if it can slow down or speed up clips. ( I haven’t done that before)
---
Is it weird that without prompting I heard the Soviet anthem in my head when I saw the last pic?
---
you see comrade,enemy cannot headshot you if you have no head.
---
That's splitting the playerbase. Unnecessarily. You would have ranks, but 2 different ranks. You would see all the serious players go to the Six list, but then when the get 5 of their 10 placements there and their friends don't want to go tryhard, all those 5 would become a waste of time as he would have to start again.
---
Besides, it sux to lose to no fault of your own, like a single staircase of Hereford and bad site balance of chalet.
---
I do sometimes but usually people bitch and moan about my mic quality, so more often than not I type
---
thats why you dont use them...
---
Yeah I’m subscribed to r/marvelstudios too so I was very confused very briefly
---
All those head shots
---
You're right. As much as the player here was ignorant, good design means that mistake would never have been made. People are too quick to criticize users for messing up in ways that weren't necessary to begin with.

If you want them in a camo you can’t find on their site, contact Gorgoth Orionov and he can get you a pair in a different camo (if they make them in that camo)

All free sites are scams. They keep giving you surveys to get your email, phone, address, and credit card.
---
The dumb thing is that Mute shouldn't place there anyway. The jammer is vulnerable.
---
If you put it off to the side, when someone drones in, they die because they lose contact right as it gets shocked.
---
It's still effective to place jammers slightly off to the side. It's ineffective to leave barbed wire unelectrified when you have the opportunity to do so.
---
Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make
---
I think because it wasn’t the same person they didn’t consider it a team killing and processed it as accidental. If you would have killed one person in back to back rounds that would have giving you a ban.
---
None of them.
---
Vigil is seriously one of the best roamer's in the game. He has two great weapon, impacts, three speed and a gadget that dodges drones. He doesnt need any changes.
---
No, it’s 5v1, and it’s casual. Literally nothing on the line.
---
If you down the hostage a whole bunch, it wil start to give you negative 2000 points and call you a monster. Every time you down the hostage after that, the amount of points lost increases by 1000

Finka has headgear that doesn’t have a gas mask though

"clutch or kick". It's something that people in siege like to do, maybe more on console (in my experience console player are sometimes more toxic) than on PC.

What about sledge or thatcher

Your r6 is running in debug mode somehow?

Another question, all the time it's "9", but 3-4 times during the match, my screen freezes for 15 or 20 seconds then continues. Why does this happen?

Chanka with omnislash? Ubi plz nerf

It all happened so fast.. the Germans charging us.. the bright lights, the gun fire.. the footsteps. It was nothing like an action movie. It was horrifying. I can't get the images out of my head.. there's one particular one though.. of him.. *clunk clunk clunk clunk BONK clunk clunk clunk* as his footsteps faded away I would come out from the desk I was hiding beneath to see his path of destruction.. four of my closest friends lie dead in his wake.. help me get this out of my head doc, please.

The AK successfully fills out 2 philosophies of use:

---
The only available editions I see right now on the ps store are deluxe, gold, and ultimate. The regular or original edition, whatever you want to call it, is not there.
---
Probably because i played so well and definitely didn’t panic at all
---
Yeah, that makes sense
---
Aight. It’s just casual. Not like I’ve got anything to lose

Yeah I suppose, sometimes you have to throw some wholesomeness into the mix

Ultimate "What are those" to ash's boots
---
Agreed. Extremely strange. 😂
---
Depends. Some old ops are good, some new are good.
---
Honestly, I just think that they should make black ice skins as expensive as they can and just get rid of Alpha packs all together. Alpha packs are just closet Loot Boxes that require you to gamble on them. You should be able to know what you're getting so that your time is actually respected when you end up getting a new one. Imagine playing for a few weeks straight just to get rewarded with nothing but some Chibis and Commons and Uncommons out of 25 alpha packs. It's honestly a stupid practice and I don't understand why nobody is actually talking about how bad it is. Probably because they had the genius idea to make Renown boosters a thing so that nobody could call them out about having Alpha packs being a micro-transaction so it's "Technically not bad". They literally only have them as an option because they deliberately made so many items that are the simplest things cost as much as a new DLC op which takes quite a while to get if you didn't already buy a season pass. 
---
  
---
I have no problem with them having things like Elite skins and Pro League skins. Those are good, non-crappy ways to give the consumer something they would want because 1. It actually has special value to players and is a great way to give somebody an item by supporting you and 2. It's not exactly something they give you by chance; You actually know wtf you're buying without having to hope you get it.
---
If you compare the Loot Boxes of Overwatch to the Loot Boxes (Alpha Packs, but they're literally loot boxes) of Siege, Overwatch actually gives you MORE things that people would actually WANT to use more frequently than Siege EVER does. Overwatch at least gives you 4 items at a time and normally there's a drastically higher chance for you to get something that actually has high value. They're still horrible as a practice, but Overwatch is more fair. Alpha Packs are so bad most of the time that it's literally a running joke in the community, but for some reason we're complicit with it. We're complicit with just letting them use this system as an excuse to play the game more so that you try to get something that will take forever and that you may NEVER get, and their "solution" to this time consuming problem is to buy Boosters so that we can "Support them" but at the same time that doesn't increase your chances of getting anything. It just makes it so that you can be disappointed **faster** when you go out and get those alpha packs. In the end, you're still sitting there frustrated that you're not getting anything in Alpha packs, and Ubi is just sitting their proud with your money in hand and is just waiting for the next person to fall into the next trap

zofia is aight I guess

They don’t want to make Siege too realistic, and the addition of more gore is unnecessary. This is Rainbow Six, not Mortal Kombat.

With these upgrades, you never stood a chance.

I'm no expert as I'm fairly new to cosplaying but if you're just starting out too I'd say pick a character that's fairly easy to cosplay so you're not trying to attempt something super difficult to start out with.

It’s all about mindsets. You’re going into ranked games with the mentality that if you screw up, you have royally screwed up.
---
You need to go into the game as calm as you can, thinking it’s like that casual game you always play, where there isn’t any high stakes.
---
Focus and play your game, and don’t let people bring you down when you screw up. 
---
Don’t celebrate when something extraordinary happens, as it throws you off. 
---
Remember to breath deeply, control yourself, and that will control any adrenaline you may have. (Has happens to me before)
---
And all this should be in the front of your mind rather than other negative thoughts. Those negatives should still be their, like the consequences of the loss, but they shouldn’t overpower the positives and the mentality you go into the game with.
---
And last of all. Be confident. If you aren’t confident that you will win a gunfight, you will loss the gunfight. But you need to be careful and not get cocky, as if that happens, you loss focus and underestimate the enemy.
---
They to implement these as best you can, and overtime, you should see some difference.

It’s lame as fuck.  But yeah, it’s the culture on console.  I’ll always vote no unless someone is deliberately playing to waste time.  But I’m not going to votekick someone who is anchoring and trying to fend off 3 attackers.  They’re doing everything they’re supposed to.

Him being stationary is the exact reason why he’s bad in the first place.

In mother russia, ash IS Wall
---
Exactly! But of course I'm not maining Twitch anymore cuz I realized it myself
---
General Resposti, you’re a bold one
---

The whole enemy team must not know what a “headset” is...
---
Hmm.. honestly i dont have these problems cause i mostly play this game competitively so most of my options are low-medium, plus i have a quite good PC.
---
I dont notice that much difference in visual quality when its on high/low so if it keeps happening (and you dont find a fix), one thing you could do is put it on low if it fixes it..

At least Ding Chavez and John Clark are still kicking ass in the rest of the Ryanverse.

or make the shield break in sections maybe

Fuck you

To an extent they are right. I encourage you to give it a shot anyway.  While it happens in ranked its likely not as much as casual.

No input lag on my minesweeper

Back in a time when inverted controls were the only option.
---
I’ve been getting a lot of this in ranked the last day or so and have lost games because of it.
---
I’m not completely surprised though. With it getting tougher to team kill it was only a matter of time  before they found another way to be toxic.
---
Alright I’ll try it.
---
Assuming you have good communication and proper turret placement he can hold site like it's nobody's business. Sorry your experience with people who play him has been sour.

I've seen bandit players do this so many times, but I've only seen one mute that placed his jammers on my bandit walls. Dude tk'd me when I asked him why.

"And dat renown m8"
---
Needs more tachanka turret crosshairs.
---
Did it as you said, not working
---
Uninstall m8
---
I can’t say for certain, but maybe there’s a reason you were tk’ed every round of two games...

He’s just toxic, help him not be toxic

Remember when she was actually good farther than 3m....
