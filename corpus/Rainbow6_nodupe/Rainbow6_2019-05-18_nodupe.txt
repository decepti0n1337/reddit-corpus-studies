Nokk doesn't have a secondary smg but ok

Nokk should have an MP5SD

Game is now heavily unbalanced without claymores. Especially for solo queuers.
---
Idk, I don't really mind the load outs they have since allegedly a lot of the team were re-alocated to help out with the new Ghost Recon game. It's a good time to probably also balance said weapons or rework them... *idk, just my 2 cents.*

007 is jealous right now

They could have given her a HK44 or a C7A2 (Rifles Jægerkorpset actually use in service, not some random ass bullpup shotgun prototype and FMG9 that never even went into production lol)

Or they could've given the FMG to warden because...

".. It was developed for potential use by personal protection details such as the United States Secret Service."
---
Ok pal

You very good man

That’s just mcJay with a beard

Almost as unbalanced as someone being able to glitch. Im sure we will all be just fine without claymores for a few days.

Can confirm for PS4. You can still choose shield/claymore, but it will say you will have none remaining from the start of the round.

However if we have underpowered ops the game gets extremely stale and doesn’t bring any new things to the game. An overpowered op gets people talking brings eyes on the game. Where as with underpowered ops people don’t come back for the new season. With overpowered ops people come to check it out. And both of these can be patched so I can take an overpowered op if it means players stay interested

Adidas partnered with Russia in the 1980 olympics. Since then Adidas became a status symbol. So much so that millions of counterfeits were manufactured. Just Google "slav squat" and you get pages of Russians squating in Adidas tracksuits. LifeOfBoris on YouTube is never without an Adidas uniform, as an example.

Warden is a 1-Speed, 3 Armor Anchor Defender. His Primary Weapons are the MPX SMG (Valkyrie's) and the M590A1 Shotgun (SAS Shotgun). Warden's Secondary weapons are the P10-C (Gridlock/Mozzie pistol) and the SMG-12 (Dokk/Vigil). His Deployables are the Deployable Shield and Barbed Wire.
---
His Gadget is the "**Glance Smart Glasses System**". When activated, Warden gains immunity to Flashbangs and reduction to other Flashbangs (presumably this means immune to normal Flashes and reduced effects from Ying Candelas). While active and standing still, Warden can also see through smokes/fog-of-war effects like dust.
---
What? Are you having a stroke? None of this makes sense. 
---
A game like what? Who cares if the Polish is male? Why are you so condescending while being so nonsensical? How do I suck at controlling recoil? And why are you even saying that? Why does me playing Ash matter? Are you fucking high?

They're done with a posca paint pen, theyre my fave for highlighting watercolours 😊

So what was the whole teaser about you’re going to want to make sure you reinforce the hatches that are on the same floor as you?
---
I dunno, most of it kinda makes sense to me, even if it comes across as lazy.
---
The map pool is already pretty saturated, even in ranked. I'd much prefer them balancing and fixing already existing maps that have issues.
---
As for the gadgets/abilities these will challenge the current meta where defenders have way too much intel capabilities (hence Nokk) and attackers love to utilise a smoke/Ying plant (hence Warden). 
---
I understand the boredom but balancing seems to play a big part in their decision making for future content. I think there's more thoughts going on other than 'we released it early because we're not thrilled about it'. 
---
You don't have to agree, but just my two cents.

&gt;The current sidearm for USSS agents is the SIG Sauer P229 chambered in .357 SIG (which entered service in 1999). Agents and officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the FN P90 submachine gun, the 9mm Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun.

I remember arguing with my friend about how this is all they need to do to fix it and he was going on about how Ubisoft would never do this. And I was right.
---
So I guess we don't need to watch the reveal?
---
Well... It wasn't a fair fight...
---
I would so buy one of these if you were selling them.

Player icons should be animated too. For example if they get flashed, take smoke or fire damage, or when they use their gadgets.

If it goes over one minute then stop matchmaking and search again that usually works for me.

That woman in the gown, obviously Warden in disguise.

i saw the mpx in his hand and was really hoping i can play attack with my favourite gun, sadly thats not the case, hopefully valkyrie isnt gonna get a nerf when warden releases absolutely broken

At 2:11 Glaz shot Warden in the head and the game didn't register. Not sure why they would look at that and say; Yes, Put that in the video!
---

Only when he’s on cams tho
---
Lol. You sound like you use MnK and are offended. This is hilarious.

Hope you arent one of those 1v1 me cunts. Ha! It is an unfair advantage. I'm not sure what language to put that it. I dont speak dumbass like you do so I give up on explaining that to you.
---
Thatcher will ruin him.
---
Cheaters who use mouse and keyboard on console currently have to deal with a lot of very noticeable aim acceleration, which apparently feels awful to control.

This change will reduce that hangup and allow them to perform even better with less effort.

In short, it makes an already large problem worse.

So it’s a stun gun on crack

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.
---
Please re-post your submission using standard letters.
---
Yeah, but it shouldn’t be such a heavy counter to a mechanic like Warden’s, especially since all you’ll need to do is run Thacther and throw a made at Warden, then you just smoke plant. Easy counter.
---
Yes but I'm fine with them reusing new guns since it's getting to the point where some weapons are just reskins of existing weapons bit I'm not to pleased with the loadouts.
---
I don't know if they could do this, but the player could leave and their downed body there for 10 sec after they quit, just in case if that player is downed by a Cav.
---
All they need to do is make it so when you leave a downed player stays on the ground if you have been downed, why cant they do this, i return to this game after months of being absent from it and this is still an issue, its been an issues since caveira was added.

Is it just me or does the danish operator’s kit feel more American than the American operator’s
---
Yeah? I don’t see then any “hot” post about it
---
I don't know, I still think if they have enough modelers to model two new operators at least 1 new weapon for each would be a breeze. I think it's more of a choice they made. No one truly knows though except for Ubisoft. Maybe they'll touch on it at the reveal.
---
Sorry that's what I meant my bad they're still in the game I played for the first time today and I've seen several Jagers with the shield glitch.
---
Nothing new if you're talking about the recoil that's been like that for a little while
---
I know it's frustrating to see. I think its partly because marciu (the spectator for most games) is so used to default placements of gadgets that he focuses more on the rotations and drone routes.
---
NØKK already feels unoriginal enough (attacker vigil) like at least give her some original guns right
---
I'll be honest, I'm one of those terrible players people hate to play with. I struggle with this game a lot and all that but I still enjoy it for the most part. That being said, from my experience there are three reasons people don't use a mic.
---
1. They are so bad that everyone just hates on them telling them to kill themselves and that they suck. So why listen to that? And doesn't bother wearing a headset (with mic) anymore. 
---
2. Doesn't own one. 
---
3. Just doesn't like talking to randoms. 
---
The r6 community is very toxic and I've been doxxed a couple times just because I messed up. It does suck and all I can say/ ask is, have patience, try to use nonverbal communication like tagging, knifing the air, etc. Most things are common sense but when has anyone said there was an abundance of that. 
---
I wish you the best of luck and remember, it's a game :)
---
&gt;why not switch him and Nøkk as attacker and defender.
---
Because we already have Nøkk on defense :^)
---
sike author of this thread is gonna keep it going
---
Me and my friends also lol I would love to know how many times it was quoted.
---
That's not a glitch. As far as I can tell, he didn't clip through the geometry, and he didn't do anything that didn't make perfect, logical sense.
---
Is it intentional? Probably not. Is it a glitch? Arguable.
---
Okay these new ops look good. Might reinstall my game now for these two.

Because I can say that oranges are sea animals, that doesn't mean it's an opinion, it's just wrong. If you really can't figure out how the game mode that Ubi has stated multiple times is the game mode they balance around is more balanced then the ones they don't frankly you're an idiot and not even worth talking to.

Would capping max sensitivity be a good solution? Ya it would hurt those on console able to play at really high sensitivity but they're a very small portion of players and it wouldn't allow M&amp;K players to flick so easily.

When you don't have gsync or free sync, anything below 60 on a 60hz monitor will feel laggy.  I've experienced this. Because the screen stays the same for double the normal time for a few frames and will therefore feel laggy

Honestly I fucks with it. Understated but not boring.
---
You're opinion isn't an opinion, it's just wrong. Ubi has stated multiple times that they balance the game around bomb and bomb alone. If you can't figure out how the game mode that the actual devs of the game say is the most balanced game mode frankly you're an idiot. It's an opinion to say you prefer secure/hostage over bomb, it's wrong to say secure/hostage is as balanced as bomb.
---
They already explained why they look away and why they don’t have replay and camera options as in Dota. If they leave replays like that then people can easily break down enemy strats, valk cam position, maestro evil, and a bunch of other stuff.

At least AN-94s are actually cool and interesting and M16A4s are relevant and good.

Taking underused/already balanced weapons that are already in the game and giving them to new operators makes them easier to balance. Besides, the FMG and Six12 SD are basically new guns to most people because nobody uses them.

Here on console the community can get pretty toxic but exploits aside it has been much less toxic since all the kids play Fortnite and Apex now, gotta thank them for being virtual daycares.
---
While I doubt that they are placeholders, there's always a chance. I just find it unlikely that they'd have that placeholder loadout on a leaked TTS build + fully developed animations and skins for those weapons. There definitely has been a trend with reversals, but as long as they work, I'm fine with it. If we start seeing some dumb stuff like breaching grenades on defense I'll be a little worried.
---

The BEST feeling in gaming
---
I'm mostly talking about their gadgets in my post. I personally agree that the loadout is a little lame, but in the long run, that makes very minimal difference in how the operator plays in a meta. It's just a less flashy and new.
---
This should be his elite skin TBH.
---
If that's him in his gamer pic it's likely that he's fucking his sister.

---
You will get all of the Y4 ops with the season pass.
---
There are other ways for example you can use something like wind blowing sound. The ringing sound is really bad for ears.
---
It's a somewhat fix to the current smoke-and-plant submeta right now. Makes you worry more about clearing a site and it's surroundings rather than just popping a smoke, and running in there.
---
Glaz doesn't have a cooldown he can use that scope whenever he likes, Also about Nokk that chick can go invisble outside avoiding the starting cameras she's also invisible to hacked mozzie drones, Echo's yokai, black eye cameras, bulletproof cameras and Maestro's evil eyes, Not to forget she can also ADS and fire her weapons, crouch and go prone without it deactivating same with Warden
---
Fookin’ facial hair

Too bad Clash got removed for a bit.

It's been pretty updated on PS4. Map expansion and being able to use your gadgets more.

IQ the op that counters everyone in theory and no one in practice (except Valk and Echo)
---
Fr, I’m mega bad at the game and I abhor these cheaters for making me feel worse.
---
Things happened, people died, we are all the best of friends now. It was a bonding experience.
---
Any youtuber that pronounces "think" as "fink" should be banned.
---
Glaz will have to stand still next season if he wants to use his thermals, same with Warden (I believe this means no crouching and whatnot). Valid points about Nökk (though you forgot about Vigil) but she has really bad weapons (for attack) to offset this anyways. Her gadget also makes her visible slightly on cams, just harder to see btw.
---
Not to mention if he had to go up against any smurf bronze accs too which people do a lot for the fuck of it
---
I would say that the guns they chose to use are very disappointing the fmg is so bad that people take the shotgun and just use the smg11 and the mpx unless its going to get acog i dont think its going to be that good for the new op. I feel that the main weapons of the operators are getting worse mozie got a decent gun in the p10 roni but out of the last 3 operations only one good gun came out of it
---
dude. you were promised 8 new ops early. you got what you paid for. these ops provide new opportunities with their gadgets, and yet you're "pissed" over the fact that they didn't add 2 new models to the game.
---
I think this is just something every needs to suck it up and deal with.
---
I'd be more than fine with the MP5SD on Nokk.
---
You have to remember game engine limitations. You cant have 200 guns in a game of this size
---
Pretty great show that is definitely just a casual reboot of Batman.
---
If the smg11 didn't go too far this single counter won't do much
---
So, so dissapointed about the FMG-9 on Nokk.
---
I can't believe they sent even getting 1 new weapon each.
---
I mean, it's definitely a possibility. I'm not too worried about the ACOG, I just personally don't like the guns they chose(probably my least favorite primaries in the game, barring the shotgun on Warden).
---
"ı saw nothing sir let me go"
---
Map expansion doesn't really count. And use your gadgets more how?
---
Not technically, but you’ll soon wonder what John and Finch are if not just Bruce Wayne and Alfred
---
shield hipfire is fine. increasing it would bring back the 1-tap pistol snipes
---
No, you don't have to pay for the content. And if your next argument is that in-game currency doesn't count, its still a currency you have to earn, and by still using that logic: you work a job in real life to get early access to free food and shelter.
---
Honestly, we've broken too far from trying to portray the different organizations realistically. Getting shot square in the knee is barely a flesh wound under most circumstances, an operator that's out of ammo just consigns themselves to death as opposed to picking up a different gun, and getting interrogated by Caveira doesn't just reveal where you know your team is, but gives her whole team magic omniscience as to their movements long after death.
---
If you're going to recycle weapons under this pretense, atleast go the extra mile and let Operators use *every* weapon they'd realistically have, including smg for attackers and AR's for defenders. Valk can only use this one shotgun, this one smg, and this one *wildly unrealistic* pistol. No other weapon from the wide array used by the USMC. Not a one.
---
Only Ash is allowed to use a G36. No one else. If Thermite goes to the armory and tries to take one, Ash drops in like a ninja and swats his hand with a ruler. Not even Operators from the COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS MADE can use it.
---
I really wish we had something more akin to Rainbow Six Vegas, with a customizable character that can use any gun.
---
Just get the skeleton kickflip one
---
I mean, Ubisoft themselves consider it cheating. It’s unlicensed 3rd party hardware specifically designed to give you an advantage in multiplayer games. Plus, I don’t know how playing on PC is supposed to help your case unless you play with a gamepad. I play both console and PC and the advantage offered by MnK on console is absolutely undeniable.

Bruh man, along with others, won’t stop harassing her so at least I got evidence of some of it. If some people can’t keep words to themselves and mind their own business, they can learn to do it alone in their homes after they get suspended/banned
---
It‘s Not going to happen. Maybe the increased hipfire with shields. Bit ecerything else... naaaaa
---
Six12SD is in a good spot right now imo...
---
I actually like what they did.
---
Just remove something temporarily and fix it.
---
IMO thats  134 680 279x better than just keep the glitch in for the entire season.
---
He's annoying to play against
---
Ubisoft has said it's cheating to use mouse and keyboard on console
---
No they are bad, given that smgs are already at a disadvantage to rifles the FMG on attack means that Nokk will probably have some of the lowest dps on attack, besides maybe blackbeard. If you look at rogue 9's weapons table the FMG sits very low on the list of defending weapons, and this is a problem for nokk as she will not win cqc gunfights with a pea shooter. She is meant to be an entry frag, but with shit guns.
---
Time tells a different tale
---
Defenders' weapon usually have lower dps because they have the advantage of preparing the site; decent player can force attacker into their trap, or simply hold an angle and wait for the kills. 
---
So, attackers are always given high damage weapons to finish their opponents as quickly as possible when given the chance. Fmg-9, on the other hand, is inferior to all rifles and even some other SMGs.
---
In theory. Main problem is that whatever curve they have set in this game is clunky as hell.
---
Yeah I saw your earlier reply. I was mostly joking, but it does look really nice. People pay for that kind of quality.
---
You got killed by IQ doing the glitch.
---
The killcamscreen shows the place where she did the glitch with her current camera movement.
---
This game's broken
---
Thank you!

iMovie, good for beginners
---
You didn’t have to do me like that
---
I feel like that aswell! Exspecially the casters need to get out of their comfort zone and get some more emotions into their casting about the gameplay. They just talk way too much about the previous or the next round and forget to say something about the present gameplay
---
Dude NOOOOOOOOOO.
---
SHOOT THE HATCH MY MAN
---
I’m not sure but I think 3-4 hrs
---
Also make the smg 12 and bearing 9 recoil the way they were originally
---
Prime example of the following advice:  
---
"Next time you have a chance to kill someone, *Don't hesitate.*"
---
Looking at this list it looks nothing like what pro players actually pick
---
Kill =100 points
---
Assist = 75 points
---
Injure and assist=  50 + 75
---
Nano machines son!
---
whats low effort then?
---
Go for it then.
---
Make my main proud
---
Yeah that's pretty good considering the game has such a steep learning curve. Ranking up is way easier with a consistent team, but if you can solo queue to like gold 1 or even plat, that's some pretty good skill.
---
Damn! Hope i will get that skin for my Thermite
---
Agree
---
She had one early on in development.
---
It was way too strong.
---
Is your internet bad?
---
How did you kill 2 people with 1 shot?
---
How do you get “mira main” to show up
---
I like the new animations, specially the smg12 animation, it's more cool
---
This + hold to quit
---
Implication is that he's in Russia
---
Well, all i want is Map preferences in Ranked, and ALL maps in this mode, i’m just fucking tired of Hereford and Villa
---
If your on pc you can go to community options on the side and choose different ones
---
No at all
---
HOLY FUCK THANK YOU I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS
---
I thought the Secret Service used the P90? Would love to see the thing make a comeback, maybe a rework as well.
---
But... it does so much damage, let alone damage... something don’t add up ere
---
On PS4 the game is a fucking mess, glitches left right and centre and mouse and keyboard is a fucking plague atm
---
Fuck blitz
---
I recommend you Maestro and Lesion, they are very cool
---
A very invisible implication.
---
imo if Ubisoft simply can't/won't have player bodies remain after they've disconnected, it'd help a lot to trigger an interrogation, like the leaving-during-it, if a player is knocked DBNO by Caveira, or Caveira is in close proximity to them when they disconnect. It'd miss some edge cases where someone gets downed from afar, but that's pretty rare, and the time between being DBNO and dying is relatively short that this is unlikely to be accidental.
---
Part of the clutch is the defusal, just the way things go sometimes.
---
It glitched
---
You are very late
---
What exactly would removing IQ completely do? The glitch needed a claymore
---
All good, but only Bomb mode? Fuuuck
---
Save up for the seasonal skins.
---
Unpopular opinion,but i like Hostage
---
And funnily enough, a fix for these ranked system abuser is wayyy simpler to implement.
---
Worst challenge of my life. Definitely my least favorite map, run outs every single damn round and it's a shame that most attack rounds depended on how many of my teammates died to spawnpeeking.
---
How do you get those main stuff 😅??
---
On phone.
---
I do think that. I also think that in the year since they said they were working on it, I refuse to believe they wouldnt have come up with a working model to test in the TTS. We do not have glitches all the time nor is the rainbow team small enough that all of them can only work on one thing at a time.
---
You can’t on mobile to my knowledge.
---
Solo queue is a frustrating experience and a different beast than playing with a team.
---
It’s allways personal preference. Just for me, i hate skyscrapper and border and love chalet, but thats just me, maybe someone loves what i hate but no need to let the hate flow :)
---
Oh yeah
---
Deed
---
Their a bit deer though
---
With that wooden base it resembles a chess piece. Still looks amazing.
---
Top floor was defender sided, bottom floor was almost impossible to defend.
---
It’s not bad tho :) It’s just nut my waifu ;)
---
When I got while for past few months I was playing only to finish my birthday charms collection. Then quit , having 300+ charms and never looked back
---
Thats a super good idea.
---
oh my bad, i misunderstood you
---
They literally picked all the worst/situational guns in the game and gave them to new operators. I wonder, what was the thought process behind this.
---
Nah man 
---
I played after they announced removing clash, shields and claymores
---
We can live with that :)
---
Yeah others have said that and I hope we get a reason on Sunday during the milan finals, Because I kinda don't see the community keeping quiet about reused guns tomorrow, They'll make many threads venting their frustration especially for Nokk.
---
I myself can't see them giving Nokk anything else except making tweaks and adjustments to the FMG-9 to make it viable in the future, An ACOG would be nice but since she can ADS while using her main primary and ability together it's pushing it.
---
Lol is this an Xavier wulf song?
---
They specifically said in that announcement post that it would take six hours to activate just the Clash change and it got pushed back a bit too.
---
I think so
---
nice
---
The pants need to be more baggy.. but overall its nice!
---
The FMG-9 isn't a bad weapon in itself. It's because of the stigma that's remained since the days of the SMG-11. I believe that Nökk will be in the right place once she is brought out: OP gadget wise but worse weapons balance it out, like Valkyrie or Vigil in the opposite direction.
---
Hello oty930911, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bq2k3s/starbucks/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
How about they reuse everything for console and give PC actual guns
---
fuck that try planting with echo and warden on the same team lol
---
Yep, they removed her because of the glitches, she will be added by Operation Phantom Sight.
---
People aren't annoyed with just the preused guns it's because they literally both don't even have 1 new gun, They'll probably buff the FMG-9 for Nokk only and increase it's damage, But I can't see them being able to do it because Smoke would need the same.
---
Ubi disabled clash due to the exploit same with Claymores and deployable shields
---
Was there a delay? The schedule linked here says 4pm for the 2nd match, and 7pm for the third match, but the livestream shows 4:15pm for the second and 9:30pm for the third.
---
I play about 200-300 ranked games and never experienced someone leaving and returning to improve the K/D ratio. Seems like I‘m quite lucky, lol
---
She's been temporarily vaulted because of glitches
---
Are you fucking kidding? why should we suffer and you on PC get exclusive guns lol fuck that lol.
---
One thing I like about bandit's gadget, is he could just steal car batteries out of someone's vehicle and use it lol
---
That's the point. Even though the FMG9 falls short in terms of damage, at least it doesn't have a terribly slow ROF like the M12, or a BS RNG recoil like the Scorpion. Plus, the vortex sight is a VERY good addition to it.
---
She’s probably been vaulted until she’s fixed. There was a clash on the other team recently who had their shield up while firing their gun.

Hello Vendetta_be, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bq2l4r/glitch_clubhouse/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It depends on which Spot you defend/attack and which operators your enemies plays. So there is no general answer
---
Yes you can. They could literally just make 2 mpx guns with identical stats that use the same model animations and textures but the other mpx has acog and the other does not. And it wouldnt even fall under the excuse of data limits since they would use the same models and everything and the data for the gun stats and stuff is not big. Its completely possible to make it.
---
Yeah thats a cool idea :O
---
That’s basically just Kaid, maybe the devs were like, ‘oh snap we should’ve done this’ and realized the potential!
---
“YOU ASK TOO MUCH. Improved ranked and bug fixes is more than enough”
---
Ubisoft 2019
---
The best duo
---
Would work best on roamers to cover rotations.
---
/r/foundthemobileuser
---
I think they did the perfect choice and when they talk about their choices on Sunday we will see why they did it.
---
Nokk gives us a completely new playstyle and that's awesome even though they reuse old ideas. Warden is the same thing but he also counters two rly big strats the smoke plant and the rush combined with, flashes, Blitz and Ying.
---
The abilitys are awesome and iam rly hyped about them.
---
Now to the weapons yes the p90 would be a bit better but seriously the mpx looks so much better to his look and fits better to his role. Secondarys everyone will play the smg 12 so who cares
---
Nokk has a weak loadout but it's the two weapons everyone combines with stealth, yes echo would work too but the acog would give her even more utility. And if they use the smg 9 or the mp5 isn't such a huge thing.
---
Ur worst and maybe stupidly patriotic point is about the difference between the two ctus and yes u made comparison to seals and what ever these are two of the most known ctus on the world. Ur country is not interesting for the west world because u don't have huge military actions like the US. On top iam a German and seeing many fails like the wrong police number, and such stuff is just not important. I don't know why ur upset about false information or just freedom in designing a character?
---
i don't mind of the attacker use the Fmg9 ... her ability is good so it's kinda balance .... but the defender is just ..... SUCC
---
It's only slightly annoying, and very situational, and I don't care a WHOLE lot, but I'm glad someone agrees.
---
Who cares? Ur country is just boring when coming to military actions (that's a good thing) but makes research hard and so ubi tookbthe freedom in design
---
Shit, you're right.
---
Finally pro league becomes interesting. Previous ones weren't as interesting as you always knew who is going to win.
---
fake plates
---
Remind me of...Apex Legends' character Octane's running animation.
---
Yeah thats a good idea dude :)
---
If Ubisoft cared a little bit, they would give both new ops at least ONE. F*****. NEW. WEAPON. They are definitely not.....
---
Dont go! ;^;
---
So Nøkk is basically vigil but better in every way
---
it comes out today for ps4, is it out yet
---
Where did you get this screenshot from?
---
Can you link the patch notes? The disabling patch happened yesterday.
---
This UI looks nice but frankly, is functionally fairly useless. HP is already displayed at the top, the operator loadout of each operator is normally pretty standard most of the time (I know the current UI displays this for each player and frankly I think that information is fairly useless as well) and knowing whether barbed wire/Mira windows are used for example adds nothing to the spectating experience. The only useful information on this new UI would be gadgets that are used throughout the round e.g. smoke canisters and grenades. 
---
Having said this, I would be opposed to a stripped back version of your proposed UI to only include operator and standard gadgets whilst omitting the guns each operator is using (which could replace the current individual operator cards when spectating).
---
yep. i think as long as the glitchers have an excuse it doesn't matter how lame it is.
---
Judging by your language you’re about 11, 12 and if you’re older then thats just sad
---
Then ctrl-alt-del
---
Don't say a user mode app can block the OS
---
Fanastic
---
i have no idea about the whole thing tbh
---
If you exit through the options menu it should automatically count as an abandon. In that way they would be forced to restart the game and possibly lose a second round just to save their precious kd.
---
It reminds me of pubg vector
---
If someone downed by cav leaves, she get the interrogation
---
Just like people lagging so hard they just get disconnected at the start of the match
---
yeah im gonna be so surprised with no new fucking guns
---
There is no patch you need to worry about other than you need to switch from claymores and deployable shields.
---
Definitely. I am waiting for new weapons. What about you?
---
I’m intrigued
---
Then some ppl with less than perfect internet will shit around
---
Then they shouldn't have left
---
Beast damage and very manageable recoil, even with controller
---
Only Glaz
---
Ela is genki tomboy, Zofia is athletic onee-san. Miracle is chibi geek, Gridlock is fatty bully.
---
That’s fine, but at least it’s not a hot key to close the app. If you do use ctrl-alt-del at least it takes longer and would have a lower success rate
---
so it’s already out? it wasn’t like that last night so just wondering. i went into thunt and it still had a claymore, maybe 3 hours ago
---
Because most people understand when Ubisoft has bigger issues, aka the glitches and hardware limitations.
---
I use impacts on clash this ain't fairr
---
Everyone complaining about claymore being gone never played Y1-early Y2
---
Because everyone has alt-f4, not everyone will make a macro, I have said this 3 times. I’m done now. Bye
---
I agree I am disappointed with the new ops I was looking forward to nokk so this just disappointing and this next operation is heath 2.0
---
Nope, it’s just a regular “D50” Deagle, identical to the Navy Seals’
---
I like how not over-the-top these ops are.
---
See through smoke and flash
---
invisible to cameras
---
Well... I guess it's not any weirder than Nøkk is getting Mozzies Vortex sight for the FMG-9?
---
I thought this was a screenshot for a second
---
Ubi isn't blocking alt-f4 now.
---
Wow somehow I’m even more disappointed then I already was. Well there goes my money getting the season pass lol
---
How is that glitch?
---
What I'm scared about the FMG9 / MPX swap is that Warden could be Smoke 2.0. Just think about it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Smoke has the FMG9 &amp; shotgun for primary with P226 &amp; SMG-11 as secondary. Due to increase his effectiveness, players prefer to run Smoke with Shotgun &amp; SMG-11 which ditch the SMG. If Warden swap MPX for FMG9, don't you think his loadout will be similar to Smoke?
---
My suggestion if Warden to swap for FMG9 would be too also chang the shotgun or swapping the current SMG-12 to another pistol (M45, I guess)
---
But what if you accidentally hit it mid air and suffer fall damage
---
The garage doors are not reinforced/10
---
[just one major tournament?](https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/Major_Tournaments) 
---
The spectating is mediocre but it could be worse for sure. 
---
The ever shifting meta is a good thing I my opinion, makes the game not get stale. games like CS:GO get boring after watching the same strats all the time.
---
Looks awesome, enjoy buddy!
---
I know it sucks. I hate how warden is a 1 speed but doesn't have an acog.
---
Yea I know, which is why I asked in hope of someone might know the tradition
---
Ehhh, considering all the P.O.S players that use exploits, I don’t think it matters too much.
---
He mustve put on some weight
---
Ubisoft Montreal have done so much for the big details. I know you mentiones some of the GSG-9 numbers doesn't match, but that's smaller details. Blackbeard is kinda a cliche yes, and you mention Mav. And I think he's an exception, he has really detailed background story about how he became what he is, so I think he's an exception.
---
But if you take these too phrases and copy/paste them into google, and then look at the pictures tab, I think you'll understand what I mean.  
---
Jægerkorpset (Jaeger Corps)  
---
Frømandskorpset (Frogman Corps)
---
So your basing your thoughts on the FMG-9... because it doesn’t have an ACOG.... it had the same stats as the MP5 pre-nerf
---
I can see where your coming from but thatcher can’t take out lights
---
I can’t lol I have a life and I need my phone and pc to do other things
---
The fmg 9 gets it so smoke can use it as well
---
I can definitely see a Halloween theme to this like they usually do when it's that time of year &amp; we're at house again
---
Oh ok thanks.
---
Well yes, but that’s how Ubi tries to balance the ops, taking Twitch as an example: people still use her because of her gun and not specially for her gadget, because it’s not that good anymore. Nøkk will probably work the other way around. I imagine that her guns will not be that good. Because her ability will compensate for the lack of firepower. Lion is the exception on this rule, he’s just broken as f***
---
bro u just posted cringe
---
What is MnK?
---
I use my old phone and just leave it in my room with the stream running and go about my day

Yes, that annoys me too

I get ur point but it's not important for the idea of the game especially when u consider that nokk is special and is made for stealth so she could copy the frogman look even though she initially comes from the Jaeger corps. I mean we don't know the hole story and it isn't such a big detail.

---
Smoke can kill mute and sledge just as easily
---
Nah you good lol
---
I mean even if it was a pistol with one, but it just feels wrong to not have one
---
It wouldn't take 8 months to literally just take the C8-SFW, remove the shotgun, change some stats and call it the C8-CQB. Then you'd have a weapon that was easy to make and it would fit perfectly with the operator as the C8 is the preferred rifle of all Danish CTU's.
---
Imo, the MPX needs an acog on warden, if I remember correctly, the way weapons attachments work is if one gun has attachments on one operator, they need to be on another with the same gun, like the special scope with gridlock and capitão, so this could cause some problems, giving valk an acog, but they could make it work. Just having a regular MPX could be extremely underpowered, especially when trying to counter glaz.
---
Who busted one for Gridlock lmao
---
From what I've heard so far, it was only Nøkk. But I'm not ruling out that Smoke might get it, I think it would be a fine addition, even tough it's very few people who would pick the FMG-9 above the M590A1. But I still think it kinda proves the point.
---
There is nothing they can do

---
Imagine using the word cringe in 2019.
---
People do choose twitch for the F2, as she is the only one that has it. Why else are people not using the 417? People know that her gadget is pretty good while her F2 is a god-tier gun
---
Kinda surprised you haven’t seen anyone do that until now
---
Like in Dayz only there its 5 min and if there are other players around - if you leave the operator stay's ingame for about..1 min / 30 sec / end of the normal death timer?
---
Thank you so much xD
---
I guess
---
The official patch notes announced it as on the FMG-9, not specific to any operator in particular. This was prior to the Nokk leaks as well, I see no reason why it wouldn't be on smoke as well. It isn't something to spice up Nokk's weapons (like Mozzie's lesser smg), but rather an attempt to buff the FMG-9 overall (people have asked for a holo on it for some time now).
---
Would you rather they fix bugs or use new guns that would proboblay be unbalanced anyways?
---
He already is
---
People who comment this don’t understand how this works. Ubisoft can patch it out, momentarily, just to have it patched out by XIM or whomever. So they then have a dedicated team to basically patching out XIM patches in the hope XIM will maybe run out of code. They can’t ban people either since on console they do not control who does or doesn’t get banned. It’s not as easy as pressing a button labeled “address M&amp;K on console”
---
Looks like my dad

What?

The same developers gave Blackbeard an 800hp shield and a 50-round recoilless gun to Ela.

So, was doing my thing today, and shot a fire arrow through a window, figured I'd be safe from getting the hostage. Half hour ban. :(

I would dig tachanka with his helmet and a suit giving away his daughter in one hand and in the other.... lmg
---
I would check out Lightworks, you can get a free version and its really good for beginners. If you need help with it either google it or hmu.
---
Ubi probably knows there is no point legally trying to force the videos down and that a ban can be circumvented anyway. 
---
Be interesting if any of the youtubers who show how to do the glitches get invited to events, betting they don't.
---
Why do I like this

I might have been able to do this with the old Bearing 9, but not anymore.. nice job pal

Was this casual? Please tell me this was casual
---
Yeah I really dont want this ever again.. :/
---
I have the exact same thought for many other ops: IQ and Dokkaebi/Vigil (secondaries) especially come to mind.
---
Giving operators more than one choice of an automatic gun just makes balancing more annoying.
---
F
---
Nope, it’s why I quit siege. Not grinding out another lvl 220 account. Rip the game for me
---
The "take out light idea" isn't new though the way he does it is new. Also the main issue here is that the game engine can't allow that.
---
Well....Also think about the fact that you can have 5 recruits with F2 or R4C in the same round.
---
Claymores and clash aren’t. Everything else is.
---
Your art and style are both crazy good!
---
If u do My main Mira like that imma get sad
---
But that’s not a reason to have an extremely strong weapon on her though
---
For 2 seconds and it's barely darkened
---
True but he didn't show the clip for analyzing the situation, so it's irrelevant if he died because of the holes.
---
Body parts are still clipping through walls and that is a big problem.
---
I destroy it to deny the 10 points for destroying the rook armour for the attackers!
---
Which one's extremely strong?
---
Honestly just set it to thunt classic outback. No annoying barlett or c4 rooms. Sure it gets repetitive, but it's better than the other maps.
---
So you're thinking something more like highlighting the possible options on the image and labeling them "A", "B" and "C" (for example) and having the user choose one?
---
It had to be. they are in match point on round 3

The 416

Mmmm I'd say it's personal preference.
---
It’s good on EUS
---
That’s true but the FMG has more utility and more power
---
It would’ve been badass if the switch animation for FMG-9 (if given to Warden) would actually have him pull it out and unfold it.
---
Didn’t the pool have aids?
---
Well I didn't know that...thank you for clearing that up. 
---
So they could add the MP7 / 416C as a copy and paste and call them the "MP7-DK" and then give them the ACOG ?
---
This sub needs to have a rule about reposts, it’s getting ridiculous
---
In my eyes, these changes are the next step towards building a fully competitive playlist in an extremely competitive game. Many people, including Ubisoft themselves, argue that bomb is the ONLY competitive game mode, and that it's the only one that belongs in ranked, as the other two changes coming would not work without a bonb-only system.
---
Imagine ash with maestros LMG
---
If I could upvote a thousand times I would
---
Honestly map preferences outside of T-hunt would be nice
---
Would break the game
---
Kind of unbalance the game. Imagine if say IQ picked up an F2 off a dead twitch. Now you have a 3 speed with an amazing gun and good ability.
---
~~it won't be balanced~~
---
Since when has fortnite or apex ever been toxic ? If anything the toxic people are no life’s in their 20s who take the game op seriously and tk you

No it’s not your aim is shit, the enemy is shit, and you can’t even use buck ACOG.

I don't think it sucks on PC compared to PS4 or Xbox, joysticks just suck for aiming.
---
well i was right about it being worse than the MPX the only 2 smgs that are worse are Cavs M12 and the P90 and frosts C9 but you are correct pre nerf mp5s are all just as good as the FMG 9 BUT unlike the Mp5 the recoil on the FMG 9 is worse imo (its random left or right instead of just right and it cant have an acog, so nokk will always be worse off when she gets spawnpeeked which I feel is a bit aids\_
---
Aah in that case, yes.
---
I'm REALLY excited for Warden. Moustache man with m590 and smg12, hell yeah brother!
---
That's not a bad idea
---
The blood is on the right of Mav in the Stairs. If the one bullet that may have hit, hit the blood would not have been that far down the stairs
---
She's cute as well. In chaarcter model as well.
---
~~now now, let's not speculate~~
---
Wow... Apparently most people that've seen this post, or my comment at least, have not so fond memories of the acog... Haters gonna hate
---
Just to clarify, at least based on the leaked video, the vigil interference occurs all the time as long as it's being viewed from either a Yokai drone or a Mozzie-hacked drone. On any other camera type, her only indicator is her someone glitching when she runs or shoots.
---
lol, let's just hope they start waiting before they add a map into ranked.
---
She hasn’t even come out yet and people are already making waifu fan art of her lol
---
Siege is made with Anvil Next, which boosts games like Wildlands or Odyssey, both huge games with feature and content creep. Data limit, bullshit.
---
Aside from many of the original ops, Vigil, Lesion, Maverick, Gridlock, Alibi, Blackbeard, Zofia (off the top of my head) all have primaries used by their corresponding CTUs irl. So it’s not like Ubi disregards this information.
---
Yes! Many people have mixed feelings about the bomb-only change, but I'm all for it. 
---
There will be countless noobs running around the ranked playlist not knowing how to play bomb properly :D Makes my job easier!
---
Year 4 by the way.
---
From the Philippines, so should fall under SEA server, and I was able to get R6 credits just the other week. I own the game on Steam.

Hello GoatedUP, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bq5czi/coconut_brahs_secret_channel/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I am a little bit ashamed now that the 91 is only my birthyear and not anything fancy like you described :/
---
If it counts as a different weapon then yes, like Mira and Lion's vectors, but knowing how lazy ubi is this season, I doubt they'd even do that
---
That's actually a thought I had for a gun for her, get the stats of a gun, and make a different model for it, boom
---
Nobody would complain
---
\~60 CPU

\~60 GPU
---
You get more points if you shoot someone , then a teammate downs them and then kills them.
---
While this is true, his title leads me to believe he blames the clipping on his death. If this is true he wont learn anything, and will probably do it again. Clipping is without a doubt a problem, but it didnt get him killed anymore than his little murderhole and bad awareness did.
---
I think it was 12 hours, or maybe 8
---
Actually, another thing I did while writing the post was trying to prematurely end any arguments before they started.
---
If I just said "give Nøkk the MP5SD", that would be incredibly unconvincing and boring to read.
---
So first, I attempted to point out *why* I didn't think the FMG-9 wasn't a good enough fit for her and why it needed to be replaced. I explained why the MP5SD wouldn't have been overpowered while also thinking of how it *could've* been OP (ACOG on a potential rush operator). I then thought of a counter to that. 
---
Basically, I attempted to deter any doubts the reader would've had - you have to put yourself in the reader's shoes, in the shoes of a person who has no idea what you're thinking and can only see what you've written.
---
I knew about it already and is pretty obvious that you can use it both ways
---
#VIGY
---
What? The MPX in carbine form would not make it any stronger. It would just have a little better range over distance, like putting a long barrel attachment on a UMP or any other gun.
---
Making an AR weak like the FMG?? What the fuck are you talking about? And do explain to me how the FMG-9, a weapon better suited for the Secret Service, makes sense for Nokk. And yes, I know why they're recycling assets, that's why I've made an entire post dedicated to how they could have done it BETTER.
---
Oh my heavens! I was wrong! My bad. That means rook, doc, echo never actually had better guns, just that they had ACOGs. Good thing mute got the smg11.
---
But I'm ok with the recoil.
---
I hope to see you have most on tachanka :D
---
Nobody has to know the truth.
---
We've been ass farted
---
Unfortunately I tested this and they still get stuck very often on windows... The sound to hit the barricades and the texture is different though.
---
Barricade debris should just shrink and disappear after 2 seconds in my opinion
---
u on console fam, obviously it isn’t the best
---
upgrade to the high life, pc master race
---
Exactly that, kinda disappointing though, I thought it might be something significant
---
Power doesnt mean when comparing guns look at the time to kill because between 27 damage and 30 it doesnt change the amount of bullets needed HOWEVER the firerate means you can send those bullets down range faster and win the engagement
---
&gt; (Also i believe that we have no females in the danish CTU's, which i find funny that they made Nøkk a female.)
---
Same    thing with  the  polish  GROM, which   for  some reason has 2 women in R6.
---
There are no fat special ops people.
---
Saying “kinda cringe lol” is a bit cringe in itself
---
Ubisoft: eyes begin to glow* so its treason, then.
---
You mean wait for a few weeks before adding a new map to ranked?
---
Not a fan of that. I'd say it should come immediately. best way to learn strats is in the heat of battle.
---
how to have people completely disregard you, but having a valid point
---
damn man I think only India has that problem then I guess cuz I asked in r/indiangaming and everyone says it's locked there as wrll
---
I've already disabled hardware acceleration.
---
Ok, I will try the chrome thing.
---
Thanks!
---
the person who killed u just needs to say it wasnt intentional and then rff is disabled
---
Upvote this post pls
---
I opened this wondering how many comments were going to be about trigger discipline and was not shocked it was the top comment
---
&gt;realized the potential
---
Funny bitch
---
tower was put into ranked day of release.
---
 "Cover your monitor with a sheet" a new option on strat roulette?
---
50% Chance. No exceptions. 
---
You must have some terrible luck
---
Ok, thanks for the help!
---
It's an open bolt gun similar to the SMG-11 meaning that when the trigger of the gun is released the bolt moves forward, picking up a round from the magazine, inserting it into the barrel and firing the round instantly, so no cocking required. Of course this means that the gun shouldn't be able to chamber an extra bullet when performing a tactical reload, but this is a logical inconsistency that is present with many guns in this game.
---
Idk I just took the song of YT and put it into a timeline of photos to make the meme.
---
It clearly wasn't.
---
I never post for karma but the discussion, so idc about downvotes. I only hate that these people never comment.
---
Does this mean warden can do nipplegate on other ops?
---
flair: news
---
Exactly...I was thinking Ash's G36 ...have some seaweed / camo hang off it.
---
Give it a smaller / bigger magazine or just leave it as it is. But atleast put SOME effort into this.
---
Stream is fine for me too, looks good for 1080p@60fps, better than YT stream, no issues with low fps either. Issue is with your internet, and you trying to insult others won't change that.
---
Dude I have waaaaay too many erotic op edits on body pillows in my gallery bc I saved them as memes to curse my friends; now I gotta hit em with this
---
He looks really cool
---
If we’re talking p90 as in the top fed sub machine gun, no it’s not concealable. Collapsible to save space but not concealable in the normal fashion.
---
Yes, but don't make the highlights obvious or its probably going to be Easy mode.
---
“BuT ThE gUNs ArE RecyCled”
---
Let's be real. No one is going to be playing kn the last days of this season based on the state of the game. 
---
Great idea, but not for a game like this.
---
I don’t main any operators. Maining OP’s legit make no sense. Mira and castle are not even in the same bracket so I don’t see why you’re bringing her in an excuse? What does drones going through windows have to do with castle utility and purpose when he’s on the board 
---
All I’m saying is Castle is probably the most balanced defender therefore, he doesn’t need a rework. I would say give him a different UMP or give it more bullets
---
That's not even the right quote.
---
Where can u see which one you've got so far?
---
Well i saw a valk cosplay while browsing earlier i will try find it again
---
You somehow managed to make nokk wholesome, and for that i applaud you
---
Give Warden a P90 so he can have an ACOG while not having an OP weapon, plus as someone who has played Vegas and Vegas 2, it’s sad to see the P90 not used in a competitive setting.
---
I hope you guys asked on why they gave Nokk one of the worst guns available.
---
I hope you guys begged them to change their minds.
---
i just started watching now, is it to late to get all?
---
If you didnt potato at the beginning you wouldnt have had to use it in him.
---
There’s not a lot people in the matchmaking pool so it’ll take awhile
---
Pretty similar, but the name for kelpie in danish is Bækhesten, or at least that's the closest thing to it.
---
why is Mira teamkilling tachanka
---
Well it wouldn't be Ubisoft if it wasn't a half working fix. Give it few more months and large barricades will be back to the usual bullshit.
---
No ur sweaty
---
should jagers, bandits, and alibis be nerfed too?
---
Look up the roald dahl book "the twits", sums it up pretty well.
---
its MUCH stronger than the FMG9. So if that was Ubis balance target, none of the weapons you listed are actual alternatives (except maybe the mp5sd). Theyre all just a lot stronger.
---
Her name is u/beccCosplay or something like that
---
Holy shit lmao
---
Me &amp; the boys always do m870 on defense and either that or shields on attack
---
How does it feel to be a clash main and have her being banned for the time being ??
---
That's a fair point, but I'm assuming that ubi can detect if you leave on purpose, I mean you have to hit the return to menu button, so it's different to straight up disconnecting
---
and if you disconnect it is unlikely that it happens exactly when your downed i think
---
Howdy Doody?
---
Please be excited
---
Do you know what a meme is?
---
Do you prefer it to the old one ??
---
He says "Neighbourino"
---
Granted, it's locked inside a paid pack with 30 charms though.
---
Oh. Guess I didnt really pay full attention to that.
---
Of course I was a being nice
---
camo***
---
It would be nice but I think they would have to buy the design of it to actually implement it into the game
---
Do not test me or my bae
---
Slightly: defending is easier: you feel less harassed from all sides
---
Yea I saw u/BeccCosplay too. I'll hopefully be at invitational next year so I could bring it
---
Hello Chicken_Villain, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bq6887/this_game_is_fucking_full_of_boosting_party/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I see it aint shield team 6 so am alittle dissapointed. But hey a full team of recruits is always better than even elite animtions.
---
Ironically that would be unbalanced since the gadgets arent all the same strength.
---
it's ok :)
---
Could be a Valentine's day special?
---
recruit shotgun rush on attack works 100% of the time no cap
---
I’ve waited a couple times over 10 minutes.
---
🅱️oi
---
honestly i think with the amount of people who played mw2 theyd sure make some sort of profit off of the skin and pay back what they had originally payed for the design
---
The secret service IRL switched from the mp5 to the p90 if I remember correctly. Would still make sense if he got it.
---
Why don’t you go work at ubi? Seems you understand everything that goes along and how the engine works so well.
---
where did you get the tattoo sleeves?
---
Ubisoft would make so much money if they released a skin like that.
---
Oh yeah defo but I'm saying that it's probably copy righted So they would have to sort something out with cod
---
And to answer your question it is a sad time for all to have one of our only black defenders ripped from us
---
Possibly, but like I mentioned it makes no difference honestly.
---
noone remembers the original trashcan release, echo :(
---
But hes op now so fuck him
---
To be honest, at this point we might need a secondary rebalance. For example, buffing both the pistols and the machine pistols, by that I mean reduce the recoil of the machine pistols and add sights to the pistols. Also, another buff to make the pistols actually useful would be to remove/reduce the hipfire.
---
I would upvote this but it is at 69 and I will not ruin that
---
"Autobots, roll out"
---
I hate getting caught in that main corridor
---
How is it refreshing is it’s the same gun. Same stats and everything other than looks. Stop being so needy
---
All im saying u clearly could see him placing the charge and the window being open yet u ran in well aware he would probably detonate it
---
i mean aren’t copyrights limited ( i don’t think that’s the right word) to ten years? and mw2’s tenth anniversary is coming up sooooooooo
---
True
---
That pc will literally blow siege out of the water. You could spend less than half that much and be able to play r6 at 1080p60
---
Somebody already did it’s cool
---
Sorry. Might have been false alarm. Tested this on Live, and weirdly it doesnt actually get stuck in this *specific* door in Kafe. There're specific doors that get glitched but others dont.
---
Just letting u know. Gonna delete this post.
---
If they replaced the FMG with the Vector, I'd actually be happy with her loadout. Even with the Meme Shotgun. FMG is just lame.
---
r/anime
---
Would people who used the IQ and Clash glitch be consider "cheaters" in this case?
---
Sully would probably make a smokescreen with his cigar instead of being able to look through it.
---
Yep. In every other seasons we actually got new things, and here is the operation "recycle"
---
stream quality reminds me of the days when the R6PL Finals were in Brazil.
---
.... Don't most operators use the same hitbox?
---
I land plenty of headshots on ash..
---
Sure, it's a funny meme. But it's not exactly an actual ingame problem any more.
---
I'm watching on my 32" tv and it looks good, it's gotta be an issue on your end
---
Stop stealing other peoples content, you filthy slime
---
Exactly, they only need to put out an explanation to satisfy me, but that’ll probably come later.
---
I don't want to say anything but he is worse than smoke imo... A worse ability than smoke, and a his smg is much less controllable
---
Mate. It’s not you DPI. If you go to game settings, you’ll find a sensitivity option. What is the number there, you seem to have missed the question about 5 times
---
She's not even out and I already want to main her just for this elite skin.
---
Man it’s almost like a part of the community is trying to make the game only for them but they just don’t realize it’s not sustainable to drive new players away, quite a shame if you ask me
---
why give them such shit guns? And no dude, the weapons this guy has mentioned are not op at all.
---
You mean Mr. *Bear*!
---
This comment section is a fucking trainwreck.
---
lol your eyes must have issues man, like don't get me wrong. It is not atrocious, but it is grainy and not full 1080 definitely.
---
Zeg makker
---
The hb uses subsonic rounds I think. .300 blackout.
---
It's...beautiful
---
Is everything you post on reddit a stolen meme w/ no credit given?
---
"Finally"? Didn't it just come out yesterday?
---
These Warden jokes are actually really funny not gonna lie
---
*They said I could not make it hard enough.*
---
Yeah dude like, i get that generally the playerbase is younger but cmon. Its common sense that he sacrificed himself.
---
This is exactly what I was going to say in here.
---
The abilities that these ops have, while allegedly "reused" and "unoriginal" are really strong for the sides they are on. It will change a lot, and having weaker guns makes for better balance.
---
THIS\^
---
Yeah kinda spooked me at first but hey do you man, I'm not judging...
---
The battery is supercharging the stun gun, which is then wired up to the wall
---
I also think it’s just for aesthetic reasons to show off bandits undercover illegal knowledge
---
Oj! Jag menade inte att låta arg! Jag tänkte bara va lite fjantig ;)
---
Is it possible to buy these in Europe?
---
It took literally like 7 minutes for the first OW porn to show up after the original reveal.
---
Internet does **not** fuck around with its Rule 34.
---
The devs can't feel shit about this game looking at some of the changes they are doing (and no I am not complaining about Ash's acog removal)
---
They removed the other maps because they were too unbalanced. If one of your arguments for them to bring back secure and hostage is because some of the bomb sites are unviable on current maps, how could bringing back maps where all of the bomb sites are unviable help at all?
---
No because lesion is a very good op
---
I believe it was excluded intentionally to match the default colour
---
Isn’t the season after Phantom Sight featuring Mexican and Peruvian ops? Correct me if I’m wrong cus I’m not sure, but I thought i saw that in the roadmap
---
[deleted]
---
Seems like a small garage.
---
Yeah dude I think we don't have to worry. They recently keep listening to our complains, for ex. with magazines on guns etc.
---
Let me just tell you that "creddit" is fucking wothless
---
Yes, indeed
---
what operators are you considering?
---
It's not as extreme as you think. But there is a *massive* amount of smurfing going on in silver. It happens all the way up though, I've seen 4 plat 1s queued with low ranks to get ez matchmaking to gold.
---
that's and opinion from 1/100th person
---
Kapkan mains: (angery as fuk)
---
Good job on reposting with the worst quality ever😁
---
Put a bayonet at the end of the turret.
---
I know, it’s just a decent thing for someone to do when the repost an artists work
---
I agree w/ u. Must be some bots in here to push the belief that the stream is 1080@60fps lol maybe 60 fps but not 1080. it's like 900p
---
Each drone starts with and holds a max of two bursts but they will recharge over time
---
console?
---
The decent thing to do is just don't post it
---
Take away a cam and make her MPX better cause that's also gonna suck for warden
---
I already main smokes FMG cav/ and vigil, I'm thinking I'm going to like her.
---
Yep
---
So true, guns are like pea shooters now
---
Yeah, scorpion is literally useless on console
---
sliding out the stock like the honey badger pdw

Why tf did I buy the season pass...
---
Ive Been thinking alibi,but I also heard good things about Ela
---
Nutty that
---
Damn right it doesn’t
---
Your opinion doesn’t matter
---
those are two that i don’t have yet lol, but i’ve heard really good things about Ela.
---
We're not going to talk about their gadgets and how recycled THOSE are?
---
Y’all mofos must be plat+ cause when my gold ass plays Mira (and I play her a lot) vector is either a headshot machine (if I’m lucky) or a fucking nerf gun. I managed to master the recoil because they told me it’s worth it but the 26 mag and the long reload is unbearably annoying. I’m not really good with headshots yet so I have to unload the whole mag on their torso to kill somebody if they are more than 7 meters away. Could you guys give a noob some advise?
---
Thanks nitro cell was my first post ever on reddet
---
I think it's just the opposite - people using mouse and keyboard won't need to deal with aim acceleration any more either, so they'll be better.
---
It is but suit urself
---
Shame we know know how Warden dies.
---
Dude this is really old I saw this 2 months ago.
---
Yeah thanks I expected that concincering everyone was typing in "get reward"
---
Ehhhh, I'm thinking more Corpse Bride.
---
It’s not even close to the abomination of Operation Health. At least we are getting *something* with it, along with a long overdue overhaul to Ranked.
---
People may not like the ops, but to be fair, they aren’t that bad. Attackers are getting a character that has a ability unlike any other attacker, and defense now has something to counter Blitz, Glaz, Ying, etc.
---
You may not like them but they add *a lot* to the competitive element. They may not feel new and shiny but in the long run, they’ll serve a greater purpose than most.
---
"I said 'IUD', not 'IED', dammit!"
---
Thats because he is. They obviously meant for him to release the bolt with a charging handle powerstroke, instead of the bolt release, for *some* reason. But the charging handle wouldnt catch the bolt with such a short pull, so it would stay locked back.
---
The deagle simply wouldnt go into battery all the way.
---
same for me, already cleared cache, verified game files, started both uplay and steam on admin and nothing, i just want to buy maverick damnit
---
Yet it still has almost 500 upvotes
---
I'll try to make a video but my PC sucks, I'll try with shadowplay just give me some time
---
I can't breathe xD
---
Someone do this with the Jojo music instead
---
would be better if the quality wasn't 160p
---
Just watch and you’ll get it
---
do gridlock next :)
---
Alibi  is pretty much a better ela
---
using an exploit is cheating, so yeah they did cheat
---
Everybody gangsta till the tachanka start rollin

I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is the single most important issue Siege has ever had.

Siege is very different than every other shooter. I highly recommend putting hours upon hours into each Operator, studying every map (except Bartlet which is basically never played), becoming an expert with leaning, knowing the good and bad sites, and much more. With games like Call of Duty, to be pro you just need good aim know what guns are good. It is also best to play with other people that know the game well and will help teach you.
---
It is a long and hard journey to the pros and semi-pros, but it is possible.

AND

هههههههههههههههههههه

I wouldn't doubt that the new ghost recon game took away resources from the R6 team. Forcing them into this position.

The GIGN definetly use revolvers in real life.

Im interested in PDW without drum mag

Seriously lol I could care less for these operators

how does this post have upvotes? you just redrew this.
---
Do you dislike the mp5k too?
---
Nice repost
---
Repost
---
Love that
---
They didn't do well in the pro league series so they didn't get a LAN spot.
---
Don't forget lockers on Bank. Or lockers on Border as well. Hell I'm beginning to question what is it with Siege players in basements or rooms with lockers? To most people seriously just pick certain objectives just because everyone does it?
---
That's actually quite impressive.
---
Nokk’s elite skin - The Bride
---
I would actually liked to more guns to be recycled. AK-12 is one of my favorite weapons, but it's locked to Fuze.

It pisses me off that people defend this type of shit, like it’s literally in the rules of most subreddits

That’s why her being almost inaudible is good. Just sneak around him

“Omg i tked someone! Time to post on reddit and youtube!”

Hey sounds even more stolen than the new ops but hey u tried
---
Elite skin plz ubi
---
Wow these are actually some really great ideas ! I personally love MP5's but all of these guns would be great. Did you tried to show it to ubisoft directly ? Because i think it deserves attention since the majority of R6 community thinks original guns for nøkk and warden are shitty or/and unoriginal.
---
The TTS was leaked two days ago but they removed it shortly after. I was able to get the build back by downloading the depot through a steam console command. Here's an explanation from a comment I made in another post:
---
&gt;I downloaded the depot through a command using the steam console, then replaced the current(old) TTS files with the new ones and launched it with both steam and uplay set in offline mode
---
&gt;I got the depot string thanks to this guy: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpi1ie/how_to_redownload_the_y4s2_phantom_sight_tts/
---
Come back when you're feeling less toxic and are ready to have a mature discussion.
---
The purpose of nøkk is to just run in and kill people, without them knowing she’s coming. Smgs are better close range than ARs, and most your fights are going to be close range.
---
China: *deletes cosplay*
---
Do you play on pc?
---
It's like Ubisoft just put up a bunch of guns on the wall and threw darts while blindfolded to decide these loadouts
---
The devs had no choice this season.
---
How about you comback when you got a pair and can handle what I have to say ok bitch boi?
---
Thank God for the scanner zoom. I was always using it while ADS to get the wider detection range.
---
Yeah, someone else already mentioned him. I'll have to look over all of them and see who peaks my interest the most.
---
Would be weird if she wasn’t ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yes, I do.  Why?
---
I agree, but I think the FMG is fine. Objectively, it's got a good fire rate and low recoil, only really lacks in the damage department. In my opinion, the only reason it doesn't see much use is because the shotgun interacts better with smoke's kit. It is statistically identical to Mute's MP5k, which nobody complained about at all, and yet most people abandoned it for the shotgun when he got the SMG-11. For an attacker, it's for sure sub-par, but you could do a lot worse. At least it's not the SCAR or the M12.
---
Yes you’re right but i knew my teammate was going to plant very soon so i had to take some risks and prefire everywhere to focus enemy’s fire on me. And on that last kill of caveira i admit i didn’t give a shit about killing ash, i wanted that first ace!
---
Idk what platform you're on but team killing happens throughout the day on ps4, its still really toxic on our platform tbh.
---
LOL someone really thinks Valk's MPX is anything but total trash.
---
No, it has a higher fire rate. Per shot recoil of mozzies gun is higher.
---
It's about the only thing to complain about though, and there has to be complaints about something! (Except if you count the game breaking bugs from the past week but they are actively showing a response to that so it's hard to complain)
---
Exactly what I'm talking about, every player in this community acts like an entitle little brat. Has no ability to rationally think or discuss.
---
It’s true I was the wrench
---
Ik but he harasses on a daily basis
---
Dunno, saw a video mentioned it
---
Yeah but not as much progress is made when they’re not the new operators.
---
So what? It's obvious that a lot of people enjoyed this clip, even if it was a repost.
---
I’ve always liked this idea, but I think it would be too good at delaying time. I think I’d rather see defenders get flash bangs. I think would be a really good addition both for roamers and anchors.
---
My fat ass thought this was lasagna
---
I was just wondering if you wanted some people to play with. I'm on kinda infrequently and I'm not great, but I know a thing or two
---
Well if your gonna come in uninformed, and uneducated to the subject and south of some dumb shit like this then ya your gonna catch some shade grow a pair and deal with it
---
And that gadget is?
---
I love frost. And I love that her pick rate is low cause no one steals her from me.
---
My thoughts exactly. The entitlement in this community is absolutely unreal.

they wont

Where is that gadget?

He can burn a hole in an exterior window with no noise.  I like his single shot too.

Update your drivers

How do you do this?

It's cool I'm like 40% noon so that's fine 😁

I didn’t. I just got matched up against 3 plats.

Man your ideas need to be hear more here take and upvote great job

Oh I did rationally discuss this with several people just not you because you come in to MY comments and act a fool what the fuck did you think was gonna happen dick weed. Fuck grow a pair man the fuck up and deal with it

https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/816r8f/only_thing_worse_than_a_bomber/ all you changed was a word

&gt;If that doesn't work, try fps cap at 15 above refresh rate, triple buffering, fast sync, and max pre rendered frames at 1.
---
You'll find these settings in Nvidia control panel, and the fps cap and fast sync (you'll get this one in Vsync option) are available in "Nvidia profile inspector". You need to download that one.
---
I don't remember the exact details of each, but these settings should typically help you.
---
I mean is this a website or something
---
They are, but it's encouraged they're original and don't use common templates. If too many low effort clog the sub then they'll start being removed.

I was really questioning whether I thought this video was funny, but once the volume got boosted I knew for sure that is was absolutely hilarious

---
Did you really need to have this giant watermark? Anyone with the steam copy can download this build lmaooo
---
I agree that it may have been a bad position  but that is not really the point i will however take it as advise.But the biggest issue for me is uncertainty factor that was removed by the clipping . There is always a factor of uncertainty while playing the game if nobody is tagging the enemy or spotting them then the enemy could be everywhere . behind you,above under left , right .
---
But when things like this happens the factor is gone you know for a fact where somebody is  but the person who is clipping is not aware of this fact. seeing the hole is a part of the factor is somebody behind it? or was it caused by gun fire? there is always a level of that uncertainty factor keeping the game tense but then this happens and it just doesn't feel right  especially after  like 4 years of fixes and patches. However i will keep what you said about placement in mind
---
Thanks you're the first person to ever mention this.
---
Warden be like,

Lands on a plastic fork, yeah that'll do roll it out boys
---
I have year 4 but rarely use mozzie is it really that good? 
---
It feels like light recoil but really?
---
ok nevermind just tested it compared to other guns
---
SLEDGE!SMASH!
---
Casual player or Tryhard?
---
Buck is the better OP, but Frost is more fun and not much is more satisfying than catching someone in a Frost mat.
---
Isn't that the one that tries to charge you for video with sound, then says "pay whatever is fair" for the program with a $7 minimum, something I'd probably use like twice ever, if not just go to a free one the next link down
---
You need some people to play with. Even if you are the worst in the lobby by aim, you can still make up for it with being a good teammate and that’s a lot easier when you have consistent people to play with
---
4.5 thousand people wrongly gave this guy karma for something that isn’t his. If the OP pointed out it in the title that it wasn’t his content, people wouldn’t be half as mad about the repost.
---
I once was tachanka (was playing with a friend and we were doing only russian in casual). I knew roughly where an enemy was but he was peaking true a small hole. I had my lmg that looked true the barricade and I just completed sprayed true it. A full mag continues fire. Guess what. And ally walked true the fire at the last bullet. I hit him right in the grape and he didn’t say accidental teamkill so I had RFF for the rest of the game (but no team damage, just a brutal fuze kill on a tachanka when he was 1v3 and we planted.
---
or you could easily just make everything server sided...
---
Uh, you must not had been around in the beginning, the original icons would've wracked your brain.
---
They said Nok had an AR in testing and was too strong. I could see that. Imagine Cav with better weapons.
---
Where did he brag exactly? Everyone in this thread is shitting on op like he's been a cocky prick but I haven't really seen anything
---
Alibi is a great pick. She has a really good load out to compensate for a medium ability.
---
What’s kuudere, senjougahara and kanbaru mean?

I would have been so mad if that person stole the ace
---
go on vc and tell em to not

Maverick’s from Boston.
---
please just google the answer this question is posted atleast 2 times per day
---
Fuck no, there showing the whole world a flaw in the game which forces Ubi to fix it.
---
I do but most people dont fuckin listen also castle as an operator is bad for the team imo
---
Lesion, you already got an ancor with Mira, he is something like a Hybrid. Selfdefending/Enemy-detecting Roamer
---
That was so risky, could’ve got that ace stolen
---
Ok thanks
---
Its called "Instagrammer joins Reddit"
---
Yeah and updates are quality over quality  *cough cough* Fortnite
---
From my friends who play in console, apparently everyone uses mouse and keyboard so you are probably getting outgunned because there is nothing you can do against the mouse. Unfortunate, but being in gold's is still impressive against mouse and keyboard. Keep going.
---
Yeah, but not console xD
---
That’s why I put “For PC players” in the title.
---
Ayyy ima send this to my buds when they fuck up a breach, thanks bruv
---
I like how her body just flung after being stabbed in the neck lol
---
I’ve had some games where I’ve been carried but most of the time I play my part
---
I'm on xbox and was in the same position as you.  I was high gold/low plat 3 from launch until a year ago.  Now I've been diamond 3 of the last 4 seasons.   Dont become a scrub like most diamonds and buy that cheating bullshit.  Trust me it's a lot more rewarding knowing you're spanking m&amp;k users with just your thumbs.   
---
Take a break, even frequently.  Play other games, especially non-shooters.  I dove into monster hunter and didn't touch rainbow for almost two weeks.  Also took a few weeks off of gaming completely.  
---
More importantly, find a good team that you jive with not only in the game, but as people.  I've been playing with my squad for years, since the og xbox.  We also have guys that we met in siege.  We compliment each other's game play.
---
And MOST importantly, dont stop having fun.  It's a great game, but dont get tied up around ranks and shit.  That's when you lose focus on why you play the game.  If you're getting frustrated and upset, you're not having fun and shouldn't waste your own time.
---
*Then spams a bunch of other stolen shit after*. Typical instagram normie
---
Is that Cav on the left?
---
I honestly wish they would’ve made a secret service attacker, that was caveira with an American assault rifle of some sort, and a beretta 9 millimeter as a secondary, (suppressor optional) and a silent step but with a different animation, and interrogation with a different animation.
---
Do smash and get hot slash
---
She has a low damage of 23 and past 20m drops to 15. It's vertical recoil is okay but horizontally is basically random in its state. Her secondary gadgets are a shield and barbed wire which don't fit with a roamers playstyle. Her mines are very lackluster and unlike lesion aren't lethal and aren't shown with a marker above them like most other traps in game. They only last 5 seconds most time they're triggered and most of the time don't last for its full 10.
---
My main gripe is that every other defender even the roamers can choose what type of playstyle they want, or engagement range to be specific. Every one gets a shotgun or smg/carbine. Ela does to but her guns don't have the ability for those long range engagements,  yet everyone else on your team can do both long and close range which really leaves Ela in the dust.
---
General Reposti
---
Most of them aren't game-breaking, like the Clash glitch
---
It's true i was the motorcycle
---
That depends because a good castle will block off certain windows and door ways. When im castle i wait to see what the roamers are doing and plan my strat around them mostly.

The official announcement video showcasing their gameplay mentioned the leaked loadout so sadly no new guns this season.
---
However if, for some reason there’s a .1 percent chance that tomorrow they announce them using a different video they could have new weapons but I HIGHLY doubt it
---
This is on scrims on xbox? Why is everyone playing like silvers?

Btw Ying is 160 and is shorter than mozzie.

Lol, of course Deus Vult is a The\_Donald user
---
Maybe if they do the exploit in a ranked, ubisoft would do they MMR rollback feature
---
Tbh the 416 makes sense for that reason and the fact that (if I’m correct) it’s the only AR on defense or one of the few.
---
Yeah me too, for me Empire vs FaZe in the Final
---
I would love an nr design, their logo looks like hyperbeast or smthing
---
What if I told you and the rest of the siege community that there are other sights in siege besides Acogs and that you don't have to play exclusively with Acogs.
---
Happy cake day
---
It’s a legendary skin /alpha pack exclusive
---
Depends. On. Situation.
---
I like playing as mav better. Nomad just doesn't click with me at all.
---
You mean the last PL finals?
---
Ok i upvote now
---
"Accidentally"
---
why do people mock MPX this much? it has perfect recoil and RoF to win most of gunfights. I mean isn't that no.1 rule as defender with Smgs? go for head.
---
Maverick is my main, trust me and get him

Hello AR7YT, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bq9v0j/only_do_if_bored_or_have_spare_time/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Being not very useful. I like the idea, but it lacks in many situations. For example; the Attackers instantly knows which area you are located, when the ERC is active. Plus, how many times did the ERC aid you in the combat? I'm pretty sure not too much, whether the loadouts he has made him very useful in a lot of situations. 
---
Now check Nokk, wtf. She has similar gadget but better. Plus, it's the defenders who uses the cams a lot, not Attackers. Even cams they get in every different maps, it gets destroy very quickly; which it limits the gathering intels.
---
IQt too thiCC

Wich one would fit the most situations
---
Pics?

&gt;The glass on windows is now slightly dirty: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/sW5zRnN)

The best change man, i was wondering when they'd change the glass.
---
Coding is not that easy which can cause glitches ans stuff but really its the people who share it instead of reporting it. Ubi arent finding the glitches and they cant tell when it comes out unless its reported or shared.
---
Maverick.
---
I actually think way to many people are giving ubisoft a pass on this bullshit!
---
Give them a pass here and this shit will become the norm. I don’t care if they have bugs to deal with and don’t have enough manpower or whatever. Ubisoft is a multimillion corporation who is making good money of this game and they can afford to bring more people. The only reason they’re not is because they want to see if they can cut costs and get away with it.
---
We also payed for a season pass that for the last 3 years promised 8 new ops per season each with their own ability and THEIR OWN weapons.
---
Give them a pass here and this will become the new normal where all we get in the future will be half-assed seasons with recycled weapons.

Well you see the patented shotgun barrel cuts the bullet into many pieces to make any gun an effective shotgun in minutes
---
I want elite cav
---
Kaid.
---
I'll try
---
I don't get what role they want her to have.
---
There are major benefits to being able to avoid cameras but she can't really benefit from the most crucial ones.
---
1: The enemy lacks intel on your location. Now that's always useful but the 2 most useful cases are for both entry and holding angles (especially from outside angles where only usually a Valk gets great intel on). Her weapons are not good for the latter as they're clearly not angle holding/contesting weapons, her lack of 3 speed isn't good for the former.
---
2: Planting. Which could actually have become her specialty but being invisible while carrying out an action isn't possible AND would probably be too OP as only Pulse would be intel against a plant by her.
---
Not 3 speed, but lacks a proper gun to hold a long, tight angle.
---
Invisible to cameras, but not in the most crucial moment.
---
They should've made her a 3 speed with a high RoF gun to contest with Ash's entry role. Doubt she'd be better but at least she'd be a good substitute.
---
She just wiped the whole team... With a fucking pencil!
---
Just last night I supposedly got domed by an ash, but on the kill cam she 1. Didnt even see me, but 2. Shot through the doorway anyway even though it was a half a second she ran past
---
Ah so adding broken weapons and ability’s that don’t actually help the game become more balanced is good? Ok. Statistically the FMG-9 IS better than the MP5. And it does matter if you have or haven’t experienced it.
---
Ok thanks so much
---
yea i agree with the others, of all the broken things about r6, i think the non-premium currency system works, plus alpha packs reward good play/team play, so overall its a pretty fair system
---
besides, if youre not earning enough renown to buy more then 2 new ops a season, youre either not playing enough, or youre so bad at the game you get no kills/assists every game
---
He needs HE rounds
---
Ye m8 whats ur psn
---
Maverick M4 good ability with blowtorch 3 speed I say maverick
---
Noice
---
&gt; inferior methods
---
You mean just press the 'share' button?
---
Statistically the fmg 9 will be amongst the weakest attacking primaries in the game and with no access to acog... she offers no “team” utility she’s strictly a solo operator therefore in a coordinated environment I don’t feel she is worth choosing over other alternatives (if you just wanna run around and frag just play ash or twitch)

My psn is Sauce_b0ss1231. Add me
