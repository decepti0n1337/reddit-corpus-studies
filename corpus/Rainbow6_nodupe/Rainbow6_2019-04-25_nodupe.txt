Did they change the type 89 firing noise? It seems different this season
---
---
---
I'd say Favela is worse, but yeah Tower isn't fun
---
The only time I enjoy it is throwing a Valk cam into the elevator shaft

Pro league? Where I stated I used to play in Pro League? National league is some decent but not really serious torunament with small prizes and other leagues like Faceit are filled with cheaters hunting for prizes and wannabe 16yo proplayers
---
Lol that nerf changed nothing. I spawn peek with doc now.  I just swap to my pistol and relocate pretty quickly. 
---
To me acogs are better at any range. Even up close because the target is bigger so I can react quicker. I can also track better with it. If someone is strafing or spamming crouch I can hit them better. Not to mention I’m far more comfortable with the arrow of an acog than the triangle of a reflex. It’s personal preference but in the end to the average person, acog is better
---
just play ranked lmao. But in seriousness, its shit, fucking horrible.
---
Hibana didn't get down by the frost mat though
---
Just had a game like this and lost
---
Perfect
---
F
---
I've never noticed a cap. It usually fires as soon as I pull the trigger and I have a faster than average trigger finger.
---
I’d legit still argue if anything this was a buff more than a nerf the only way I see this as a nerf would be in terms of the duration, lion still accomplishes the same thing he used to which is isolating roamers and cheesing them. Plus now he got back a use so he’s back at 3 which is great in my eyes.
---
Bro... that actually hurt a little
---
Don't worry I lost too
---
Lol I was just wondering if it was a controller or some guy messing with a trackpad or those nubs in the middle of keyboards
---
So... exactly what did the message say? Lmao
---
Put it in google translate
---
I feel attacked.
---
It was never a very noticeable cap, it just kept people from firing it at the same rate of an automatic either through spazzing out on the mouse or using a macro. It was quite the plague back in the day. I'll check it out next time I play.
---
"Sit still ffs!"
---
hes asserting dominance
---
I put it and compare it, for me, it sounded alike.
---
"Why you kill me"
---
Did you watch the killcam?
---
"Yes"
---
Running between buck and a barricade is dumb
---
"No youre"
---
It's Thermite's Halloween uniform.
---
HOLY MOTHER OF RIGHTEOUS FUCK
---
Fair enough. I don't play Buck on PC so if that's the only place the cap was then I wouldn't notice.
---
Sensational.
---
Who thinks he’s useless?
---
wait, isn’t just obvious they were in a party but playing on opposing teams?
---
I'm already used to holo, acog and red dot. Reflex is my least favorite since the mechanics for it isnt similar to any other scopes.
---
What about Jager’s :(
---
wow
---
Tachanka would be a well aged bourbon that's been marinating for well over 100 years just for your tasting pleasure.
---
Why wouldn’t you take Rook armor it makes you take a bit less damage
---
Ahh i see then gets you immediately drunk
---
*Forgets to put armor on*
---
But he is blackbeard w shield on
---
He's out here playing on a track pad
---
Jackal is a really solid attacking operator. A little slower and steadier of a playstyle but geared extremely well. Hibana and Ash are your aggressive speed breachers, and Blitz is just fun to fuck around with. 
---
I personally use Zofia on attack, I like her loadout and find her more or less universal for any game type
---
Vodka.... but no bite, just pleasure and warmth in the lords grasp.
---
he became too powerful so Ubi took his away :(
---
Hey agent!
---
Thermite is fireball whiskey
---
Play casual then
---
When you’re this good at being bad, you need all the help you can get, I’ll take my free T shirt thanks rook
---
Well as far as I can tell, and I very well could be wrong, the plate doesn’t actually take any damage away, but just ups the chance of being DBNO from a non headshot to 100%. If that’s the case it seems kind of pointless for a roamer. 
---
I should clarify I’m just two weeks back into the game after a break since Outbreak, so this could have absolutely been patched since then
---
Mans packing that extra Russian
---
Nothing personal, kid
---
Maybe make it a little longer?
---
Who’s the top
---
This is why I look for footprints before entering the building XD
---
I don't find casual fun, I have like 2 hours a day max for gaming and want to play fun games. Not waste my time against hackers.
---
some of the abilities are overpowered as fuck lie Nomad is one of them, Clash isn't fun to go against, Blitz is fucking literal cancer and Glaz.......... that operator is worse than cancer that's why he's being reworked.
---
Shit I forgot. My bad
---
r/cursedimages ?
---
"Hostage has it coming."
---
Part of me misses the old days of playing siege on console. Most of me doesn’t. But part of me does
---
Yeah
---
Im actually screaming at 9pm watching this in a hospital bed. good job.
---
Certainly
---
Thanks
---
Downing a teammate and not being punished seems abusable by people.
---
I prefer holos, but yeah ash isn’t really the one who needs acogs
---
Using the Echo shotgun
---
*sweat rolls down forehead*
---
Lol I'm new so just wanted to ask. I see you have your main next to your name!
---
Happy cake day
---
Lol
---
Haha, thanks, hope you have a rapid recovery!
---
FELIN for life
---
Buck, really easy to use and really helpful in ranked
---
Fuck, Duck, Muck, Luck, Tuck, Puck, Suck, Buck!
---
By reflex, I mean optics with no zoom and a simple parallax-free reticle. The red dot, reflex, and holo all fulfill that metric.
---
Valk. Her gun is super nice and her utility is priceless
---
You have an elite controller?
---
Yeah shields are buggy nowadays
---
actually a thing though
---
No i wish
---
They need to nerf vigil.. John cena wouldn’t even have a look in..
---
Huh. You are really good at leaning and aiming at the same time. Claw grip?
---
The pea shooter strikes again
---
Honestly I like monte, I know he’s not the most popular but he fits my play style from other games being the tank with a shield (I played rein in OW until it became bad) and I just really enjoy the mindset of the stars down that neither of us are going to kill eachother just sit there and stare.
---
Yessir, this clip was from way back when i started using claw grip. Im a little better now

---
Imagine how  confused and sad he must’ve been after being kicked 😂
---
Proof that siege is now mainly retards.
---
Very inefficient with some ops, and noisy
---
First round too
---
How about a school map?
---
then just upload the videoclip?
---
This was my first day on thed game about 12 days ago, and Buck's Skelton Key was reworked to make him a soft breacher
---
Lmfao
---
Sorta, 12 days ago
---
This should not be a thing. There's no way he could've avoided that and he still gets banned
---
One day
---
as a player who only plays ranked, i don't remember last time i played house. sad though
---
Yeah :/
---
I love how making baseless accusations of hacking/DDOSing is the new norm on this sub
---
Exactly. It's to breach soft walls. Not to breach barricades. Just hit or shoot the barricades open. But granted, it is your first day on the game
---
Paid Redditors.
---
Didn’t know the cloaking devices worked on humans. Ubisoft fix this now!
---
So nothing changed lol
---
Holy shit, what a play.
---
and console games in general are going to have to be a little less changeable by the devs simply because everything needs to go through the company who ownes the console beforehand
---
Ironman dies
---
I had similiar thing happen in platinum. I was looking down a hatch and jackal just ran past me and dropped down lol
---
I've played from operation chimera and got 760hr on record with starter edition,  
---
I still haven't got two newest op and 7 OP from Y3 and Y2
---
You can't. You can only tilt without aiming on PC.
---
I’ve been hosting rocket league tournaments since u can trade in that game but I want to include rainbow since it’s my favorite game, so u think 1 dollar to get in the tournament would work?
---
I'd rather use her shotgun for breaching trapdoors, it's hard without impact to maneuver like before
---
bad form of it, considering he was referencing mortal kombat
---
You mean "(*in british accent) HE IS RIGHT THERE SHOOT HIM YOU FUCKING TWAT"?
---
He could be you! He could be me! He could even be... *splatter*
---
This is the best play I have ever seen ever
---
Basically if you could’ve brought all what I have and put it in micro transactions it would cost 50$
---
You sending a risky text but the FBI guy saves.
---
HAHA! thats hilarious content
---
Lol, they didn't know you're there? xD  
---
Glaz should've covered ying instead of going up with her... x'D  
---
I think he might also be blinded...
---
\&gt;:(
---
Not really but they fixed the drop shots and spam   crouching.
---
Fuck, I meant boys
---
I’m reposting
---
One of the players in pretty sure was me were u a doc exact same thing happened to me
---
There is no skin that goes by the name sapphire in game.
---
Skyscraper?
---
It’s only theoretical for what if discussions. Don’t want to break the delicate balance and incorporating too many of these ideas would definitely do that.

Best thing to do for Xbox, is to not message or join their party. Other than that you’re just SOL if they DDoS the server which happens more often than not.  It’s frustrating I know..

Lol I remember posting this. Dont really care if you did either but others do for some reason.
---
Restart the queue
---
i did bro like twice
---
You’re better off with a frost + lesion combo. The gu mines automatically kill the attacker once they’re in the trap
---
If the silent step is active when the ping is about to hit that ping will not appear. Has to be timed right so that the cooldown matches but it's easy. It's a good way to throw off a jackal. I do believe that if the first scan happens while in silent step it doesnt matter but all pings after can be tricked.

---
No
---
Please use the search function before posting
---
Yea it isn’t just callouts I find it hard to also pre fire hold good angles and stuff
---
How do I find a team to join is there another app or something
---
wtf is going on in console
---
Oh I neeeeed this!
---
Discord is kind of an app for that (idk if you need a code or inv) sometimes reddit works, you’re prolly just gonna have to make friends on PC to get consistent players
---
[removed]
---
Congrats on the milestone. Diamond next eh? Hehe
---
Dunno i got 900hours with all ops + 250000 renown
---
OK so funny story, i deleted my comment about what i could find about my pc specs because i fixed it. Here's how:
---
So my other screen was turned off. Or at least wasn't plugged. I guess someone messed with the plugs and the plug that makes the screen display turn on was unplugged. I noticed it after i messed with the screen plugs cuz idk. So the other screen was ACTIVATED but i couldn't see it so i didn't know it was. And for some whatever reason the siege was running on the other screen (the one that i couldn't see was activated). I really do appreciate your help though! &lt;3
---
If he’s Mexican just get him to get the other team to overdose by yeeting little bags of heroin at them
---
Was the sight fixed? The actual hitscan, IIRC, was or still is a little higher than the dot itself (compared to Holo/Acog/Triangle). If it was fixed, I may change my preferences
---
Is this basically copper?
---
Haha well that was a lot simpler than expected, either way glad you figured it out. Enjoy your game!
---
would make sense if he wasn't level 32
---
I recently did it with a friend and everything is OK for both of us. We didn't lose any bought agent, level, skins etc..
---
Nope.
---
Same, I have only icons on. And by now I can recognize characters so well that I know wether they are friends or foes.
---
I haven’t noticed much of a difference from last season
---
If this isnt tunnel vision idk what is
---
no, please no... thats a new way of trolling...
---
your team winning? Just leave.. 
---
Also, just if someone leaves not to troll you but because he needs to go, we should not get a negative effect from that.
---
if someone leaves in casual, they should get a time penalty or something. If you leave because you have to go you dont really have to worry about the penalty because you cant play anyway.
---
Yeah that's either ice or sapphire.
---
Remember, BI has a white, crystalline, almost matte barrel. That's dark blue ice throughout.
---
See the game hates me. And I often get cursed in various way. Right now it that I can win every fucking match cake. But as soon as I get one match from gold the says fuck you. I hit plat before. I just want to get another charm. I even placed gold this season. Big sad.
---
U are welcome
---
Kinda anti roamer, with lion, Finka, nomad and GL. And anti-intel.
---
I dont see "the impossible"
---
They did say they’re removing ranked from beta in s2
---
&gt; Also what happened to the reverse damage back on to the players like when a player that tks and then they get hurt not the teammates if they were to shoot their them?
---
Coming soon.
---
Good Job man! Although if you really wanna fo the impossible try to play a casual game without people being retarded
---
So you use him to make the games slightly easier oof
---
I got it from Velvet Shell and i have only 400hrs and i have 10 ops to buy (tommorow i'm buying one)
---
I don't think you can kick them, it just asks if the tk was intentional or not and if you click yes the reverse friendly fire will be enabled for them, if you click no it will not be enabled. At least that's how I understood it when I read about it.
---
This seems less than 50$ easily
---
Console could be a matter of input lag. 
---
PC does have it moments but this season has been really solid for me at least.
---
I wish there was some interaction in the game with these kinds of windows
---
What did I just witness?
---
I now have a headache trying to understand all this stupidity.
---
Top tier diamond plays right here
---
This won't work.
---
But the garage consulate one is fireeee
---
how the fuck did you put up almost 700 hours in under a year holy shit
---
I had a game where the entire other team TK'd and we won in prep phase
---
What happened? Kinda stopped playing Siege but still use this sub for the memes
---
That's what you do to em
---
Thanks, I forgot 😂
---
Poor nomad
---
I'm not paying respect to an ash main 😂
---
Task successfully failed.
---
That’s not stuck that’s called being bad
---
Idiots putting Gu under windows so you can't put a frost mat down
---
I have a feeling that you waited all that time just for an Easter joke
---
Takes you only 20 seconds to put on.
---
Especially this one
---
Pardner
---
True
---
Damn how long did it take you to find it on Internet explorer?
---
Pretty much everyone covered all the new charms and details when the event came out.
---
&gt;actually play the game
---
LOL K
---
&gt;in terms of ttk
---
Assuming both players have equal skills, ttk is extremely important. Lol k bruh i get that you have a 99.999% hs ratio but im really shit at the game and  my hs ratio is near 28%ish sry dude.
---
Did you see the last image or did you drop an /s?
---
Not RNG gods, but this pistol is bugged so hipfire is just 100% accurate.
---
Would be neat if Rook armour saving a team mate from being downed gave him like 50 points, and maybe 10 for DBNO if they would have died outright.
---
No, if you play more you earn and lose a little elo. You started with like 110 elo and I played so much, I only get 10 elo
---
Uggy
---
Clearly fake. If it was real she would be dead in spawn
---
The hitboxes for the most part are on point with the exception of netcode and client side lag, they just made the hitboxes tighter to the actual person and not all the extra armor and clothing. And then killcams have bugs in them 50% of the time with the complete wiffs and other things like the shield bug currently.
---
Yea imma just ban you now just in case
---
I'm not sure if this still happens but I've definitely had times where a shield operator has died and their shield still blocks bullets on my screen but the enemy shoots right through it and kills me because the shield is in a different place on their screen.
---
Did you just cast charm/confuse spell on the enemy?
---
Wait...why does Jäger have two right hands...?
---
How did you end up being the last. Did your team mates all team kill?
---
Nah I just don't know my left and rights...
---
Sorry I didn’t know I’m still kinda new to Reddit
---
Shit, that thing countered her finger
---
I knew that I got it and started checking it out when I first got it.
---
When i play solo, i play EU. When i play with friends, i play on whatever server they happen to be on. 
---
Was playing with some friends in Nevada yesterday, so i imagine theyd be WUS. I compete internationally in sports, so ill play with pretty much everyone during a season.
---
No, I think they just got destroyed really badly. I went straight from that kill in the beginning to that door to place the breach and they all died to Cav before I got there lol
---
I was mainly just goofing
---
I don't really care about it, it's a 18+ game that is filled with many people under that age playing it. You do have the ability to text mute everyone and vc mute your team if you so choose. Along with just clapping them in a gun fight normally will make people shut up if they are being toxic.
---
I was the 1 thousandth upvote :)
---
697 hours stealing mom's credit hard, damn ur good.
---
Jager: You can stop worrying about throwables..
---
I can relate
---
Sorry but thats a stupid blitz, like why would you do that
---
Whats with the assassins creed talk? I dont get it. Also why is her finger missing?
---
In the the back story for Nomad it says that she lost her finger due to frost bite when in the Antarctic. (Pretty sure it was her pinkie tho)
---
What
---
Sometime first week of June
---
I know. I got spooked!
---
Can’t even spell. Just goes to show how brain damaged they’ve become lol
---
Sorry that everyone cannot be as good as you are
---
A crazy clutch just isn't the same without that one kill you have no business getting.
---
oof rekt
---
I love When that happens even if it happens to me. I love the message they end up sending you my favourite message was probably “go die in a hole you Germans nazi bitch” funny thing is I’m not German best day of seige I ever had
---
Jagger has 2 left hands and in the first frame you can see on her right hand her middle finger is fully intact
---
it’s not that, he’s posted a video of killing 2 robots. sorry but reddit would end up closing down if i posted all mine. it would be like a ddos attack
---
Aww thanks! I’ve always cared about movement in this game and people tend to look past it! Thanks for noticing!
---
Nah, Jäger's SMG is still one of the best guns in the game
---
When you wanna be Fuze but all you have is a hammer and a couple grenades.
---
Idk why I found this so funny 
---
 He just... *nyoomed* in front of the scope
---
Definitely! Especially with the mouse and keyboard meta on Xbox

We are almost halfthrough 2019 and people still think that Tachanka/recruit memes are any funny
---
Valkyrie has some of the best/most unique headgears imo. Apart from pop art, the mask that looks like the SAW doll it's also awesome.
---
A carbine is an asault rifle
---
The body at the end lol

That was hilarious, have a broke man's gold 🏅

Are those gamer shoes? If not what am I looking at?

Fus Ro Dah!

r/lostredditors

Of course they are
---
They removed the no memes rule.
---
That I dont know, but it may be a residual file under the programs folder. I would just search your entire computer for anything "seige" or "ubisoft" related.
---
Uhhh yea
---
I think that they’re technically known as “machine pistols” in the game. If that’s not the reason idk what is
---
Is this only for pc?
---
I think the only attacker with a “smg” is Jackal. Use him.
---
ENEMIES ARE ABOUT TO SCAN THE AREA
---
STARTING THE CLOCK
---
No, the way they worded it was horrible. The receiving end of the charge does the most damage, the blast on the "attacker side" does 50 regardless.
---
I swear they can actually smell you
---
Jackal isn’t really in need of a nerf imo
---

I did it with the PDW first, didn't count. That's when I went to SMG12

Those movement lines are actually the stock, not her arm.  She’s just dropping it out of spite.

Oof

Fuck the same teammate rule, it prevents self defense against tkers.
---
Oof thanks I guess.

Why does everyone use AK? I don't understand. It's inferior in almost every way.

Wow, looked it up after I saw this. SMG-11 and 12 are labeled as just "machine pistols" but you can use Frost's 9MM lmao.

Here's all the "SMGs" for the game.

It is definitely pushing too small of a mouse for me, my pinky isn't resting comfortably anywhere, just kind of relaxes off to the side by itself. If my hand were bigger I don't think I could even manage that

Oh lord...
---
We got crashed, almost won 1 round but that's all, enemy team wasn't rushing or anything they played like we had all the teammates
---
The HK 416 series are assault rifles though, and I'm a pedantic asshole about the term. It's a select fire, intermediate calibre rifle.
---
 Not really, it allows you to find them with greater accuracy. Wheras with the length in between pings they have your last position, you can move quite far in that time. So if they are shorter pings it gives you their exact position, not an approximation.
---
They can still be team killed
---
The Aussies are coming...
---
What about them, they can still be team killed
---
I disagree with most of these tbh
---
Haha joke I was a ps4 player for years but these things just don’t happen often on pc
---
Technically a carbine is any short barreled rifle, including old bolt and lever actions.
---
Well 1.) Carbine is literally in the name of his gun (in game) and 2.) Im willing to agree on rifle and short rifle for both terms
---
I don't like valk, echoe or mozzie because you have to look at a screen and lose situational awareness. Some people maintain and pull it off well, I don't. Mira is a great anchor and her vector is made for terrified sprays of defense
---
Idk.When she thorws it,It looks like she throws it further..

I'm sorry. I just imagined gridlock **rushing**

I'd love for jackal to have more skill and more reward, and most importantly, LOW ABILITY TO BE BAITED, but that would involve reworking his gadget completely, which could be a risky bet. Right now, given the fluid state of the game, even overbalanced and underpowered is ok. Jackal is the epitome of excellent firepower to balance a highly situational gadget, which would have worked before, but given how ops are getting more and more self sufficient (nomad, Mav, kaid, Moz, all who can do the work of 2 ops in one), we shouldn't end up having somebody who desperately needs 2 or 3 others to operate at Max potential, but that rework shouldn't compromise balance.
---
I'm all in for an improvement, but it shouldn't tip him off balance, that's it.
---
Here's to hoping.
---
Anyway, good chat! Glhf!
---
*rushes in thiccc*
---
Tbf Get flanked isn’t exactly the best player lmao
---
it hasn't always been this way. used to be able to do pretty much unlimited bullshit and it it was only like a season or two ago where you only got banned the *second* time you got kicked from a match for tking. this is just the current status which will be irrelevent when they add the new TK rules later this year.
---
The nitro cell is different. If you walk forward while throwing it it'll go further since it carries momentum
---
*rifles*
---
My point is that the longer duration means you are out of the game for longer. On the extreme side, you’ve got alibi, your location is only known for a couple seconds and it was entirely your fault. Whereas for jackal you could do nothing wrong and have your location more or less known for 30 seconds.
---
Reeeee no twitch interrogation

I recommend the verified R6 community on discord. Here’s an invite link to it https://discord.gg/Rainbow6. Just join the many servers and you will be greeted with positive people. When I joined the mods were very helpful but beware some people are pieces of shits but mods will help you. Play terrorist hunt or all the situation to be familiar with the game then move onto casual.

Maybe if you didn‘t waste your time zapping the enemy with your Twitch drone you would‘ve made it out.

Can I get a name for that cancerous song?
---
A carbine is any short rifle, even a stubby musket is a carbine.
---
They literally do. They move towards sounds of gunfire/explosions, as well as patrolling normally. So if you enter a building and do nothing, you'll probably be ok, but if you start gatting off and a lobbing nades around they'll descend on you like flies
---
That is actually a good idea and I like that. It would save a lot of drones lives lol. And it would make the game feel more fluid and seamless

But what if they are roaming or not in the bomb site and you just planted a bomb.  you can see less if you are looking at the floor, but you will see if they are coming if there is a barricade you can scan.
---
No I meant that’s why this is better than ash, sorry
---
I see your point, but i don't think any changes need to be made. For one, if you get tracked, you can use the fact that Jackal is most likely going to tunnel vision against him, and either put yourself in a position to take him down, or have a non-tracked teammate help you.
---
Because when playing Defence, the same universal rule always applies. They are playing against the clock, and you play with it. Even if Jackal kills you, it was time he might have spent holding an angle, using his smokes to cover a plant, etc. 
---
Even if you die from a Jackal track, you still run down the clock getting him to hunt you down.
---
Good job! I’m hoping to hit plat by next season. My highest has only ever been maybe 30-ish points from plat III
---
Why the extended barrel tho...
---
got the kit and it's on all the time. Who cares if my face is white as daylight.
---
Jackal, and not because of my flair. Both of his guns are very good, his gadget is good against roamers and his shotgun secondary gives a good combination between long and close range with his primary
---

That's it I ain't watching the video. Only gonna listen to the laugh

*The man broke a hatch without touching the hatch.*

I used points to get Jackal but right now really suck at using his tracker, my thinking is that using him relies heavily on map knowledge, any tips from you guys?

shit happens

Tbh Siege really does that one thing that makes people go crazy, even the most Christian hippies will scream and swear at their setup after getting spawnpeeked by Jäger or rushed by a Blitz

Ah. A meme reference. Noice.

Good luck to you in your future seasons!
---
?
---
What game refers this to?
---
It will
---
Yep, that's why I edited. Realized after I posted that.
---
It's been nice knowing you
---
Nice idea, but there's only one operator in your line-up which has frags.. so it's very easy
---
Like wise
---
Highest I've made it was gold 2 then lost my group
---
idk i never use the p20 I just happened to have it on there.
---
It looks good but doesn't really doesn't fit dokkaebi
---
This is useful, but I really hope they patch it at some point. You shouldn't be able to breach a reinforcement without even touching it.
---
Cool find,can't wait to capture it
---
Plz tell us where
---
I disagree, you don’t have to stayed glued to the turret, you can move around and if you place it well it can fend off attackers
---
Put them in hard to see spots and choke points. Dont put one directly in front of an enemy, they need time to arm.
---
I'm saying that 5.56 is a mild cartrage comparatively.
---
Best Valk EU was on Mira, explains it all
---
i mean it's free. plus this is only the "First Tier"  after hitting 3 bugs found.  not that bad honestly. I would be interested to see what the other Tiers are. I might try, i don't feel like downloading the TTS unless they have new ops &amp; map. so this would be a good reason for me to download it and keep it on my computer.  ( I uninstall the TTS once new op's are live.)
---
The thing to keep in mind is that quality reports are more important than anything here -- one great report which you, as a developer, can directly act on is worth *much* more than 20 other reports that only hint at an underlying issue.
---
*The* critical problem with a program like this is attracting low quality/spammy reports as that would hurt R6Fix more than anything. You need to have rewards that popularize the site while predominantly enticing the most loyal/engaged players as they are (probably) more likely to submit a high quality report.
---
I like the charm as a rewards. It's something the general player base would pay attention to but only loyal players would go for. The fact that this is a bit of a throwback item only adds to that. I mean, raptor legs have been fixed for a *real* long time, I can even remember when exactly this was around.
---
Just a bit sad that I won't be able to claim it myself as a console player.
---
Another fuck you to console players I suppose.
---
Btw PS4 alone has a bigger player base than PC. Both consoles combined trump the PC player base.
---
I agree, he is a great team helping operator in terms of strategy, and you can definitely get kills with his DP-28 turret. Also, his SASG shotgun is extremely viable also against shield ops. (I also got an ace with his shotgun). Tachanka is the lord anyway.
---
I have to agree strategic placement of the turret is great to catch people getting on in and playing with it.
---
I would actually tend to agree with you. I’ve gotten some pretty insane clutches just because the enemy team doesn’t expect a prefiring mounted LMG in a random hallway. He’s not terrible, but placing his turret is really dicey sometimes.
---
I totally agree with u on that
---
No sloth valk smh
---
he's probably lesioned after that
---
Thats a great idea
---
if you're on xbox you can make as many smurfs as you want for free

*omg, hibanabeans?!*

I've never heard that before, I love it, and I have to tell my hibana main friend about it
---
Is she missing g a finger? Is that on her ingame model?
---
His meme value makes him even better
---
I'm 200% interested
---
Ubisoft: Here's a cute little Frost charm with raptor legs
---
Hentai artists: \*starting up editor program\*
---
Well first off all Tachanka is a bad op his turret is EXTREMELY situational and yes it does leave him a sitting duck but getting off your turret you are a 3 armor 1 speed with no utility what so ever you have a mediocre SMG with Russian optics no plant deny capability you are so fucking loud when you move that you give yourself away so rotating off your turret into a different spot gives you away any half way decent player would never get killed by a tachanka let alone use tachanka when the plethora of other defensive ops you could bring are vastly superior for anchoring
---
Hahahaha Nice xD
---
New MVP animation?
---
I find at least two different kinds of audio bugs on Xbox every time I play, as well as constant matchmaking errors where one squad player gets kicked. Guess I can't help?

Yeah that.

That's twice this week I've had to switch off the game and play something else because I couldn't find a game. 
---
I've also restarted the queue multiple times. I play solo plat 2.
---
Is it ok for a gold iv to get matched against plat star or the guys in the comments are rextarded?
---
You don't have hackers on other platforms.
---
Well, the middle finger is blocked by the arm so you can't see the part that is missing. I guess op forgot the ring finger
---
The file is a picture of the problem.
---
Not only that but looks like there's a bronze there too.  Yikes.
---
"Nomad's right-hand model lacks the middle and ring fingers. The loss of these fingers were referenced in her Bio's Psychological Report section and her interactive journal, where they were frostbitten during an expedition and had to be cut off."

Nah

hah! knew it.
---
This is why I stopped playing on console, I was level 215, and a an average player, mid gold and the highest I ever got was gold 1. Yet I ALWAYS got matched against plats and players with a higher skill level than my own. And it was very obvious that most of them used mouse and keyboard. 
---
Now I'm level 80 on PC, and yet again, an average player who is constantly matched against people much MUCH better than myself. Shit matchmaking completely sucks the fun out of games.
---
Whatever you say
---
Yep
---
that buck headgear looks freakin awesome! wish it was a darker/gray/blue color though instead of this awkward desert camo which wont fit most maps.

After the first person reports it, the next people that report it don't get the charm. Nice try

Yeah. Does it seem to you like everyone’s been leaving the past couple days or just me?

i fucking love these, the problem is that they're 45k renown and the uniforms are very similar to seasonal ones who are only 12k.

basically they're too fucking expensive

Honestly thought mate. Also we all know Jackal would have Patrón.
---
He's definitely an alternative to Jackal but I'm not sure I would call him better. Jackal still has a very good AR and can still counter a roamer that's not moving. I think they're on the same level.
---
And blue lights instead of red . For both attacker and defender
---
no, booters. they kick you offline lol

Id pay for that

Excluding the lord my main boy trapkan

I picked it up recently on ps4. I've had a good experience, no major issues. I recommend it!
---
Yeah they're trying to introduce an assault weapons ban that "Bans any assault weapon that accepts a detachable ammunition magazine and has one or more military characteristics including a pistol grip, a forward grip, a barrel shroud, a threaded barrel or a folding or telescoping stock"
---
By strict definition, assault weapons with those characteristics are already heavily regulated, because most all machine guns that are regulated by the Hughes Amendment of 1986 like M16s, MP5s and such have detachable magazines with pistol grips
---
On Bandit's mp7 exclusively
---
And they are only shown with the lights and outline when in use so this should stop once a couple more sets of operators comes out or if the meta changes and play-style along with it
---
Whats with the assassins creed talk?
---
Oh yeah, that's the shit
---
When you first start the game make sure you buy operators, they all have have unique abilities. Please make sure to customize your character when you buy them ( new players tend to not put attachments to there weapons ), and lastly to get operators you need renown ( the in game currency you earn from playing, start off by playing the situations to earn renown and gain a little experience on the game). I’m on ps4 as well, i can get you started on the game if you want, I have loved this game ever since I first started and am happy to help new players
---
I get matched with silvers and gold...
---
Me too lad
---
behind Castle. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yes. The lmg does have more recoil. Also the weapons play differently. The lmg is used for sustained fire. The rifle is used for maneuvering and killin.

What res are you playing?

It would more then likely end up only activating for one at a time because if they would go with the 3 per que of players would end up causing to many problems with people accidentally shooting someone if they had one toxic player.

yes

A pair of glasses, a tactical headset, a mask, and and headband are waifu bait? Either people want all the ops to be weird lookin ugly bastards or super models, but this is neither. Hell, I feel like the ponytail would work in a practical sense more than her hair now.
---
At least have something that is militarily used. Not like something that would be impractical as the Tec-9
---
I am gold 2 and ( will eventually climb ) but i can queue with my friend who threw to bronze 3. The matchmaking is broken af. I agree completely.

I guarantee it, can’t hide it from us.

Amazing, Nice aim BTW.

Also would it be ok to use your video for top of the week giving link credit to you?
---
Ill greatly appreciate it. New Channel to grind CylonTV
---
I honestly think so as well, maybe the 17 or 19. Not like the Glock 18 which is never even militarily used as a full auto pistol is highly impractical.
---
Yeah, that skin is nuts!
---
Love the lighting in this!
---
it says the article is not linked to the account or something like that(other language).and if i click link then it says error
---
smg12 or cz? i THINK both are full auto
---
Sweden doesn’t use it. The standard pistol in Sweden is the Glock 17
---
Congratulations!
---
they made a bit wider view, it was really slight buff.
---
 came out long time ago maybe before Wind Bastion and many people are using it ever since.
---
This isn’t new whatever you say my friend and I have been doing this since Year2 season 2
---
Nah, they’d use the MAC 10 or an Uzi
---
Been around for a long time tbh
---
Congrats mate, I've been stuck in gold 1 for ages

I think it should let us but give the high plats way less Elo if they win but lose a lot if they lose. (Btw this already happens but I think they should make it more severe)

Just picked it up at well (goodwill is awesome)  so far only read the prologue. Great book so far.

Some people knew, but I’m sure a lot didn’t so thanks for informing the newbies!
---
Well not really, but it would be nice if cosmetics were less. Like uniforms and headgears are really bad and cost a lot. Though there are some really nice ones you can buy but it’s not worth an operator.

No you will not

PS4... for pc... what are you talking about
---
It’s ugly tho aha
---
Can't really argue against that

There are no graphics settings for PS4. Consoles have graphic settings for very few games, and Siege isn't one of them. PC does though

I'd assume medium but I might be mistaken. Personally though I'd run low except shadows at medium for 180+ fps but that's just me
