Yep
---
Do better
---
K thx

I partially agree that people with high kill potential can get further metaphorically but the thing is R6 is also heavily reliant on map knowledge. Take Shroud for example an absolute insane aimer but he usually dies to someone holding an angle he doesn't know about or a flank he wasn't aware of, the only reason hes in diamond is because he can out aim most opponents in a straight up gun brawl also the fact that he ques with MacieJay and other proffesionals.

Yeah compared to the new dmrs it's really bad that's true, I know I still use the r4 despite the lack of acog
---
Sau has got some great comics.
---
No just the regular ones. Shit their scope would be longer then the pistol lmao
---
Ah. Thank you very much.
---
CoreRoss and rouge 9 on YouTube do evaluations on weapons to see which are better for the operator

---
Nice tachy and mozzie
---
In addition to what was already mentioned (less noise and no threat indicator for enemies) using a suppressor also removes all muzzle flash, which is nice. Sometimes muzzle flash can make it difficult to maintain visibility on your target while you're firing.

That Chanka was about to bamboozle you so hard

Woah , siege has come a loooong way since I took a break from it a few months ago ... think it’s time to strap up the boots

now if only it would do that on console for going against asshole kb/m users

Wait what does any of this have to do with thatcher?

Hello qixoh, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bf6035/found_this_gem_in_my_camera_roll/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I do agree on that, map knowledge is the key for R6. I can say that I don’t know almost all spawn peeks on all maps, but I know one here and there, also how to rotate and etc, but the thing that screw me all the time is timing and aim. Most of the matches I’m holding an angle, and then I just look to another direction and bam, I’m dead. 
---
Beyond this point about gameplay and map knowledge, the worst thing I notice on ranked matches are the toxicity between players and teammates. People for some reason like to say how good they’re and highlight how bad you are or something like it :/
---
Times to use Lion's ability:
---
* Right before making a solo or coordinated push
---
* When your teammate using Blitz is in combat or about to enter site
---
* When a teammate is planting the defuser (and again during the defuse phase when the defenders are trying to retake)
---
* When you need to buy some time to revive a downed teammate
---
Took me a solid 2 minutes to figure out what was wrong in this pic

What about hostage where you grab and dash and it turns into COD outside the map

But seriously now it's impossible to avoid it

Old uplay was shit.

Why shouldn’t they get the kill, since they are the ones that killed the player you didn’t? You assisted with the kill, so you get the assist

No, I’m illegal

well if it makes you feel any better, this one guy who does shit like this still hasnt been banned after 2 years. Enjoy. Yup, its literally just a placebo.

It was pretty much just sarcasm, but if that guy really is legit then props to him.

They have one [for sale on E-bay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Italian-Body-Armor-Vest-Cover-AP98-Woodland/173872258673?hash=item287b981e71:g:f~oAAOSwj61cn60q) without Maestro's signature neck protector for the next 15 hours on. Better act fast.
---
There's also real ballistic [Czech armor](https://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/czech-military-surplus-ballistic-vest-with-kevlar-used?a=2138008) for sale that looks extremely similar with the signature neck protector.

Well there’s always an excuse. Like you can’t shoot someone with a anti air gun, but you can if they’re body blocking a plane.
---
cool thanks
---
Also, apparently Marksterbater is now considered offensive on XBL and has been banned as a Gamertag
---
I know right, some of the legendaries in the game make you question whether they should be legendaries. I mean there are epics that are a lot better than some legendaries.
---
Probably less likely to be banned for no reason from this server
---
I acctulay mark the times finka started at 6:57 and ended at 8:37
---
No, it doesn’t
---
And alibi took 1 hour
---
Is that really a common occurrence?
---
Could you recommend a way for a Jackal player to know the difference between fresh and old steps? Will they be similar to Apex's system where it shows the seconds since or will the footprints be slightly faded based on time since placed? Fresh steps are super bright while old are almost completely gone for example.
---
Yes it’s very specific, but in general unarmed people shouldn’t be killed. Either way it was more of a Fuze hostage killing joke.
---
Well that’s what legendary skins in this game look like.

Oh man I would've raged so hard if I was playing against this in a fairly new elo I would be yelling out hacks 100% lmao

It happens on Xbox too. Spread this Information and make sure no one accepts invites from peeps they don't know.
---
As uninspiring as this may sound, the best way to improve is just playing and paying attention to what's happening. It takes a lot to get to higher ranks, and most of it is just game-sense, which can only be built from practice. Watching others can help, but in my experience, just playing the game and building that sense of the other team's movements was the best way I improved. Then again, I've never been higher than plat II so I'm not  the most qualified person to answer.
---
I actually used it today on her 552 with ADS grip actually is deadly recoil is easier
---
Its fine fam 👌
---
Hey man, plat 2 is still awesome. Plat 3 level is what I'm aiming for then I'll build from there
---
We were in a match and we all received invites to join a party from members of the enemy team. Two people joined and they got booted offline. One was able to use a mobile hotspot and play the rest of the match but the other got back on and was immediately booted off again. I recall people doing this in destiny but I thought it was fixed....
---

Why would you make an esport team for siege on PS4 when the only pro league is on pc?

While I still disagree with the idea of a global ability he’s now in a much more balance and less frustrating position

---
You don’t realise that the PS4 Siege player base is the largest of all the platforms? With pc steadily gaining more people as they become more affordable. But your right, PS4 has no “Official” Pro League but it is still massive in terms of GO4, ComCups etc, also orgs run their own tourney for cash prizes etc
---
When you're too in love to let it go

That’s fair enough I just wasn’t aware of any official esports siege PS4 teams, but I am now enlightened.

how did Fortnite copy siege?
---
Oh but if you never try you'll never know
---
Look out! It’s Live
---
Yeah, all units as far as I know are effectively equivalents to the FBI/in a few cases kind of the Navy Seals. To use the pre-DLC CTUs as an example the GIGN are just France’s counter-terrorism force in the same way the FBI SWAT are for the US, same with the GSG 9 for Germany.
---
The SAS and Spetznaz are covert military units that mostly do Counter-Terrorism seeing as there’s no war to fight, similarly with sections of the Navy Seals, at least in the Rainbow canon. SAS in particular are pretty much entirely famous for their CT work like for example the Iranian embassy siege during the 80s.
---
But I’m no expert, so anyone feel free to correct me if I got anything wrong.

I'm not asking for wild, funny camo. The opposite in fact. I'm asking for camo in the future to have more effort than giving people wearing jeans a pattern. Some of these look like they're just wearing a big onesie because there's no change between pants and torso. Look at IQ, she's wearing snake print jeans? Tf? Clash??
---
They just took the snake print camo and paint roller'd the entire mod and said, "done!"
---
Idc this one is cooler

---
Im sorry if you did it on purpose but....  r/woooosh
---
No. I just want more effort from the military camo they want to implement. Currently it just looks like they use the paint bucket tool and call it a day.
---
Personally I don't mind people picking recruit on attack too much, but on defence it is just a bit of a throw. Only 1 reinforcement can be a big let down for hold an objective
---
I am suggesting? They they quit being lazy.
---
Here's one for you too, "shut the fuck up"
---
Goodness gracious it's a Jackal with the USP
---
Simple, to counteract the Acog removal, Ubi put Ash on Attack and Defense to balance out her nerf /s

That's the ghost rider

I like the military camo they want to use. I just think it looks silly when there's no change in tone. Not all of the ops are wearing standard issue gear, so why the fuck does IQs jeans look exactly the same as her shirt? Laziness.

Well it’s not slavic but the original colonizer language aka Dutch

Thats probably your xbox not the game. Try closeing all the apps, reset power cycle, or clearing some space on the internal harddrive

huh... how???

it's been confirmed jager is saiten

thank u now ik wat u mean

Especially when you don't follow orders and when you can't clutch 1v4. Solo queuing at its best
---
There's probably a large common area too, and elevator shafts, maybe
---
Since its abandoned, a lot of the walls have been broken. Now it looks more like the second floor of outback (Around Doms).
---
thx
---
And the difference of that gap is even smaller.
---
I do not like rook
---
Yeah, only gun that benefits off that is P90 but even then its not worth it for that high recoil pea shooter.
---
Nice one dude! Keep on grinding 👍🏻 i hope my friends will soon realise how great this game is compared to csgo -_-
---
I sympathize with that Castle. All he wanted to do was play the objective while his team suicides on the last opponent. Still good shit though.
---
sorry i thought it was staged
---
Everyone has their preference am i right? One thing can't possibly work for everyone. Keep on grinding my dude 💪🏻
---
Ffs... You know what, fuck it imma go dresses as a white mask with a full bomb vest, let's see they block me
---
I don't play IQ because unless I'm in the same room as a defender gadget, I have no idea wtf I'm looking at.  Is that a Valk cam?  A Yokai?  A Gyrzmot?  I sure as hell see the biocontainer but aside from that it's anyone's guess.

If his legs are in the air, then what makes him move from side to side?

Yeah, for anyone wondering, I've tried doing it this way before. I gave up after about 20 minutes of failing. It is incredibly difficult. I can guarantee that him throwing his arms up after getting to the big white railing is because this was attempt #673.

But that’s not the end of the world I’ve got 5days on Mira and even still the crouching is marginally slower and the half Mira still works fine
---
YES everyone deserves cool skins
---
Well it is in the game and it is very annoying but if you have an acog on attacking and you are prepared, you have a huge advantage.
---
I think so
---
That sad feeling when no one takes ur trama packs...

Immediately looked up to see scoreboard and it's in fookin ranked

Yeah just hopped on after about 3 months of not playing and first game of ranked was with a squad of four de ranking , team killing and basically forcing a surrender

You tried 👍

Ah we found the ash jager main

Firstly, love stauber, secondly I love the idea that you just walk up to your dbno teammates and are just "you don't need help, good bye"

Hello Intermidiatebow6Play! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:

A graphical bug, I took the pic and posted it while waiting for something to happen... once she left the game continued as normal

Capitao guns are fun, frosts shotty is OP and her smg is good to

Go on the main r/rainbow6 page in the upper right hand corner there should be a button with three dots. Click on that then click on Change User Flair. Then pick your op then there you go!

I used to have a 7700K and a GTX 1080, also with a dual monitor setup I was able to consistently push 200 fps, I used to cap my frames at 170 and it would literally never drop below that. 1080 is not that much more powerful than a 1070Ti 
---
Wallpaper engine does definitely use resources so I’d recommend not using it or just setting it so that when you have a full screen program running it will pause.
---
thonk

Nice work

Gee bill, two whole frames per second?

Lmao me too! I bought an NVMe SSD a few months ago but now I want to ditch all SATA drives and go full m.2, I plan on getting the Asrock Taichi has 3 x m.2 ports so 1 is going to be for game storage, 1 for windows installation and programs and the 3rd for mass storage (game recording,pictures etc.). M.2 is so much cleaner than SATA.

God forbid anyone compliment someone in this community. Christ man, im saying this guy is nice how can you be such a dick about it.
---
Well, i definitely had fun in the latest event. I even played every day which for me was a very big thing as i hadn't played before this event for, let's say, a month. And now that I'm back, people accuse me for being tryhard or being noob bc of my rank/lvl like "at this rank/lvl and you lost/died" or "at this rank/lvl and plays in casual" etc. I just want to have fun man, lemme just play with my pink lord
---
And of course the time I forget to place them down right away EVERYONE WANTS ONE

Thatcher is strong enough as is he does not need smokes

I’m saying that when you want camouflage, you want it to match. The vanilla outfits (for the most part) are not camouflage.

I used to play Rook, and damn you hate it when teammates won't pick up armor.
---
And IIIIII . . .

That’s one way to win a game! Lucky you got to keep the win and the elo!

Idk maybe the flair

When the prep phase ends and the count of rook plates is still at 4

My favorite op
---
Scorpion EVO 3 A1 20 ammo mag nerf already?
---
What laptop is that? Mine has that gold 1080 sticker on it too lol
---
Been playing since launch and I still get killed by the first enemy.
---
Srlsy? I feel like that's unecessary since all explosives and sledge can destroy it, plus when it shoots
---
I wonder if the real one is the one with attachments or different uniform. Honestly i think they should be the same clothing but not gun and attachments since other wise it makes different clothing less effective
---
I thought that's what it was but I have a 0.9 W/L in ranked, I do top frag pretty frequently since I'm in bronze just now so could that possibly effect ELO gain/loss?
---
Relatable. I have 80 hours in the game and still do basically nothing every match.
---
Bug mood
---
Ummm so it’s not a good skin because people talk about it too much?? Lol
---
It’s still a good skin despite that.
---
Oh wait, have a grenade
---
I agree. If you see a Twitch drone, it's not that bad because you can just face the turret straight up, but Thatcher's going to be hard.
---
The realest rook main doesn’t even have his armor
---
Do you know what is in the canister? I don't know. Do not speculated anything until you know what is in the canister. But i guess you will never find out.
---
I know right :)
---
This isn’t true at all, it was not removed because some maps weren’t getting played the map preference setting did not work and had no effect on which maps you would play. The only way you could 100% avoid a certain map is if all 10 players in the match also had the same map/s disabled. However, matchmaking is based off of MMR, not your map preferences, so the likelihood of 10 matched players all having identical map preferences was extremely unlikely, hence why it didn’t work and was removed.

Go to the r6 subreddit and choose 'Change user flair' and choose the one you like.
---
If you are on a phone you should have that option on top right of the subreddit page.
---
I have this minimum twice every season 😅 relatable. But you got this!
---
Oof, where to begin. Lots of friendly fire because I was startled by teammates, accidentally shooting the Yokai drone or a friendly Twitch drone out of habit, upside down rappel teamkills.
---
One I still cringe about was me rappeling on a window on Border (sandwich) with Buck, , throwing a grenade into the small office type thing and getting kicked for TK because as my buddy told me, the grenade bounced around, went down the opened hatch and my friend was in server room at the time.
---
I believe the term for lurking is actually shallow roaming - for instance as Lesion you're gonna want to shallow roam the halls and stairs around site but if you're Vigil you're gonna wanna deep roam the halls away from site because it makes the attackers waste time trying to clear you out and it also allows you to potentially get picks early in the round
---
Do you mean try not. To look at kill cams or to watch them?
---
You need to upgrade from a 4gb gpu buddeh
---
I've seen both used, doesn't really matter though when they're effectively the same thing.
---
Looks like hes standing on a ledge with his foot out like that. The drone helps with the illusion.

I've played too much siege and recognized the area immediately. Maybe that's why it isn't confusing to me.

I think that this is fuckin epic, imagine seeing this in a music school.

STOP I have questions 
---
1 how is there a Mira window up there?
---
2 why did you reinforce 1 wall but shot up the other to walls?
---
&gt; BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS THEM
---
No plz im not the devil
---
Idk perhaps
---
The Greatest Rook Player places the armour down before even thinking about Rainbow Six Siege.
---
because the defuser is always the same time. You are legit asking for ubi to extend the time pf defusing to however long it takes you. that would mean that you could start defusing like .1 second before it’s done and still have it count as defused
---
I don’t know about letting him win. But i wouldn’t recruit rush him or bring a bunch of asshat operators like ying and blitz like most people would. Lol.
---
I'm fast af boiiiii
---
No it didn't, this happened to me and i have recorded it, and this is the first time i upload it to Reddit
---
I did see it happen to some Nvidia users, but for majority of AMD users it's been going on for a while and we weren't getting any response
---
Im typically not roaming with castle and play OBJ and rarely need to worry about my barrel sticking out anywhere, and when I play cav I have usually have the shotgun equipped, and when I dont I rarely am not holding the my pistol
---
cool!
---
He's pretty solid right now his Scar is very hard hitting (49 damage) tho it shoots very slow and recoil is pretty intense tho you can use a vertical grip to control it or you can use angle to increase his ADS time (which is pretty damn slow) and for barrel attachment I use muzzle break on his Scar. BB is best used for holding angles cause of his shield taking a free headshot for you giving a peek advantage. His DMR damage was nerfed but it's still a solid choice to pick. 
---
Overall I'd say he's worth buying just gotta put some time into him figure out his play style he's pretty strong pick.
---
It’s not a Ubi issue, it’s a internet issue. That’s in your end if your ping is high
---
I didn't archive it but it was some blabbering nonsense about "Having a elo counter on your stream is toxic because it shows you only care about rank". Not his exact words but close enough.
---
That’s hilarious man 😂 I’m so sorry
---
I am very confused how this happened???? Did you get to keep playing during the end of round replay or something??? I’m just so confused and it’s hurting my brain how this happened. Please explain
---
Except for us who keep getting stuck with lilpp69_420 who is a bot and ruining low elo...
---
Did you get the ace?
---
What?
---
Black ice is overrated
---
In eu it’s did/mm/yy
---
No no its the right one
---
Honestly same. Try solo queuing ranked. It's a lot less sweaty and if you have coms on then everyone is more or less useful. I've solo qued up to plat 3 now on PS4. Give it a shot. Casual is toxic garbage.
---
Well it's 50/50 sometimes you meet level 10 people, other times you go against level 150. I don't know, casuals weird..
---
Who needs an acog anyway
---
Takes time, but you'll get there.
---
Theres been multiple time I'm taking cover behind something in a corner and need to lean into the corner for more cover if I ads I would lose visibility.
---
Makes no games sense either, tbh.
---
I've thought about it but I know I'll start worrying way to much about my rank. Maybe I'll do that soon.
---
But why?
---
these Ash face posts are so funny AND original. they aren’t against the sub rules and posted every 10 minutes or anything
---
Lmao
---
i second this
---
What barrel are you using?
---
Do you happen to also be a smoke main?
---

Wow, ubi actually did something good for once

Flash hider + reflex usually
---
Are they ever gonna nerf E.Piano?
---
Watch kill cams so you can see where enemy killed you
---
Thanks for the heads up, I’m definitely looking into it
---
Yep, I'm the same. I'm awful at the game, so I play Rook and help the team without having to do anything
---
Try muzzle on it though if flash isn’t working
---
Thanks for the info
---
Will do thx
---
Luck? You pre-fired the correct angles and got rewarded by getting the kills by doing so, nice kills
---
Bro, this clip is cool and all, but take a step back on your next post and put yourself in the mind of an average person reading this. I literally have no idea what that title is supposed to mean or be a reference to,and I don't think I'm alone
---
2 to see how high this window :)
---
I have better luck in ranked with people
---
I re-watched it, didnt thought about that he didnt lean at all.. so his shield should be straight. My bad
---
I have better luck with people in ranked.
---
Oh no worries haha, same thing happened to me
---
same thing happened to me the other day on border and it was jager too lol
---
Yes it would so thankyou. Would definitely be a game changer at pro play, as it can protect special areas of the map better to better help reinforce specific strats. Mira and Kaid would both benefit a lot from this.
---
*Especially Blitz. By far most annoying op, only CAPIBARA can rival his annoyance.
---
If your only getting packs every 10-20 games you need to practice a bit lol
---
Vocals looks like a no no zone.
---
Yep it’s actually pushing me away from playing the game more as it’s becoming a cesspool of smurfs and tk leavers even in ranked.
---
Yeah, I guess so
---
Since February it doesn’t matter which edition u buy u have to unlock the basic operators no matter what (but they are cheap from 500-2000 renown) and the credit bundle for about 35 bugs credits u 4950 credits so u only have to buy y3 operators separate or just wait till the y3 bundle is available as well

Nice Looks amazing

120? Not a lot
---
Did you post this twice?
---
When i first started playing the game, I picked up on a lot of things like positioning and gadget placement just from paying attention to what my teammates were doing round to round. Bits and pieces that added up over time.
---
the only thing ATM i can see Ubi would nerf in future is cooldown timer. It could be increased by 5-7 seconds.

---
There you go an argument 👏👏. I had to take stats hated it and I dragged myself through it though, math ain't my strong suit I am Biology and Chemistry major. Also never addressed math so don't know why u started to go on this tirade. Also for the last time Heart Attack and Ralphie we're only promotional skins, not seasonal Black Ice is a seasonal skin. So stop saying seasonal b cause it makes me chuckle. Now to you argument you would be correct but there was a significant amount of time that you could have bought those skins post ptomotion. Those skins we're soley developed to give to people that stuck through the miserable start up to the game, which if you were there for you would know was God awful. Lucky, Heart Attack, and Ralphie we're all released for this reason and to be honest they aren't trully special as most of the early skins weren't as well. Also people never use them in game for a reason, I think I saw ralphie like 6 months back, heck I see peacock more and it's arguably more rare then Lucky, Ralphie, or Heart Attack. So with you basic numbers you are correct but who really cares I suspect 70% of the people that saw your post knew what the skins were and the few of us that do know about them don't care about using them either.

Just went against a coordinated cancer stack, while playing in a 4 stack. They got buck, lion, dok and one more.
---
Lion called, I moved (my mistake), Dok called at the same time, sound cue, buck took me out.
---
In a coordinated stack, he's still batsh*t powerful AS LONG AS THE TEAMMATES PAY ATTENTION TO THE PINGS AND SPOT IT AS AND WHEN THEY COME AND COORDINATE THE CALLS. No coordination, no go.
---
You're severely overestimating the complexity of the problem that needs solving. You wouldn't need to look at the input for the right stick at all, just the left, and you wouldn't give the player a "severe" consequence like a ban, you'd just reject the input locally if it consistently enough met your heuristics.
---
I fully agree with you that determining whether the input for the right stick was generated by an actual controller or by a device pretending to be one would be a difficult problem to solve, it's just not the problem that needs to be solved here to effectively combat the issue.
---
Flash hardly reduces horizontal recoil, though. Flash and muzzle are best for vertical recoil.

Ur welcome

Actually had some trash guys on my team do this today. Doc shoots the hostage with a specific loadout. Lesion then throws a Gu at the ceiling and leaves the game. 
---
When the Gu falls on the hostage, it goes off and injures the hostage and for some reason it says the enemy team downed him. Then lesion rejoins.
---
Benis
---
Not defending them, but my speculation is that they wanted to wait for the lion nerf (and nomad nerf) to go live before the bundle. Remember, there are more year 3 ops with issues, like clash, Mav, finka's fluctuating win rates. I think they want to be sure before releasing it.
---
Just a speculation.

Nope.

Technically she got a buff.
---
You couldn’t be wronger but ok
---
But then surely that makes no sense as most people have them from the year pass or purchasing anyway? Might as well let everyone have the broken ops if that is the thinking, its just limiting options for op choices
---
How is this killing ying's utility? If anything, it is a cooling buff.
---
Like I said, for lack of a better reason, that's just a speculation. Because, as you said yourself, there's no logical reason otherwise for the delay.

If that helps put it into perspective than sure 😊

The tk ban rules in casual are different to ranked rules I think

Nobody saw it luckily, but first time I ever played ela, I was hid in a corner a someone came walking right past me, I had ages to aim, line the shot up, and pulled the trigger and thing went everywhere, missed every shot, guy turned and deleted me, safe to say I've never touch that SMG again in my life

Your argument with 'the enemy got banned and I lost elo' is **really** weird since Ubi does not tell you which players are banned when you get this message.

?

👍👍

**Downs enemy from 30 meters away**

This gun is so shit it only injured him wtf

Yeah, you can already buy most everything else with renown so why not. I personally purchased my Twitch elite skin because I love her, it, and wanted to contribute more money to Ubisoft for a great game. However, I also had some Rcredits from the edition of the game I got. Some people may not feel like it's not worth paying $20 for a skin pack...and really it's not. I feel like the reason people get so defensive over this is because they spent the money on it and hate the idea of someone else getting it without having to. If you made elite skins cost a lot of renown and/or added an in-game challenge to complete in order to get them, the idea really isn't that absurd (and wouldn't take away the "elite-ness" of it). All in all though, I just want to see more elite skins. #JusticeForAlibi

Thanks for the feedback! I see what you mean thanks for pointing that out
---
Is this real or a bug?
---
At my school seniors can paint a parking block, so I’m assuming that this is a variation of that
---
Mine did but you had to pay for it
---
does seem pretty crazy lol
---
YES DUDE. FUCKING MACH 10 ROCKETS. 
---
This man is a real OG
---
can someone explain me what 4/20 mean ? I know its in rapport with weed etc etc but why ? I heard that was a code law about weed, other say its the birthday of bob marley (meh) and some other crap but I want to know the real explanation ! 
---
thanks a lot !

Real we/the two teams never killed each other but the hostage found multiple ways to die.

I enjoyed getting them the first time around back in the beginning but when I bought my secound acc In operation chimera I was annoyed that I got them all. It brings a fun challenge and makes you spend more time with operators.
---
After playing siege for so long my eyes naturally find all these cameras everywhere.
---
That looks amazing 😃👌🏻
---
I don't get it
---
Those are very good lol. Had to be post nerf Ela for sure, cause if you missed, I could only assume the gun had actual recoil.......at least I hope O-O
---
Hot
---
I wish for this so many times
---
wrong race, ur not asian
---
John wick?

#THONK THONK THONK
---
At the moment I'm personally preferring the Roni because of firerate and low recoil and that holographic sight is just so pretty
---
Tbh it may your teammates not watching certain spots or being too slow to get into position. Or you idk.
---
Advanced Gadget Deployment is really nice honestly, there's a few really handy things you can do with it like stopping placing a Thermite charge if the wall becomes electrified, because it isn't destroyed until the animation finishes
---
IKR. Using renown to unlock the operators is way more satisfying than straight up buying them. It also gives you time to try the new operator before unlocking the next one instead of being overwhelmed.
---
Are you quoting RussianBadger? Cause if you are it makes my heart happy
---
They need more siege stuff at GameStop! swear everything is all overrun with fortnite now
---
I honestly can't look at cameras like these in the same way anymore
---
My dear lad you cannot compare cod recoil with siege. Play a lot of thunt with different guns/ops to learn their recoil. Sledge’s primary AR and Ash’s R4C have some of the easier to learn recoil, maybe start with them. Like I said, you can learn with time.

Question; Boot Bands or Boots tuck?
---
Couldn't agree more
