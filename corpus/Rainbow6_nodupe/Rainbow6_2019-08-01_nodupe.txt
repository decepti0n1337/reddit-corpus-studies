Ez pz, just play frost and put trap there
---
I play on console and PC. My mouse has buttons that i just remapped. So i lean with my thumb on the mouse. Makes it easier for me but maybe not everybody.
---
I think it’s a pretty good idea but for balancing I would say decrease it to 3 total uses and decrease audible breathing to maybe like 5-7 seconds instead of 10 seconds.
---
Jager means Hunter in German you know that right?
---

---
I think it is a good change to it. Is there a suggestions subreddit I could crosspost too?
---
I understand why. But smoke still has his? It just seems like it fits with his gadget. He should have it. If your teammates aren't cooperative it can be frustrating.
---
Yup

---
thanks
---
Good just wanted to make sure
---
I would’ve pissed someone off if I did that
---
Dude I can't even play Minecraft with a controller and have a good time, fuck that.
---

---
This kid could accidentally hit someone through a wall and I'd be impressed.
---
Jammers for life
---
You just put it back lolll
---
then everyone would ddos when they're going to lose
---
what they need to do is get better servers/server protection
---
Mute them. And they're 12, and you're a grown man.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
In CSGO if you send too much information you will get kicked out of the game.
---
I never would have guessed TheJFKexperience would be so weaboo
---
Oh right, sorry I thought you were talking about the vents. I have never seen the solid wall places.
---
I knew it
---
Nice one tgat genuinly nade me laugh
---
Its tough to solo queue, if u wanna add me to play ur welcome to. My uplay is Awien.
---
He probably ate it
---
Better than losing elo?
---
Flawless loop
---
F
---
My guess as to why no one is talking about it is because the majority of the people who play siege regularly use aiding software of one sort or another, just go watch a random R6S streamer and youll see that they have no vertical or horizontal recoil at all, everything they use from smg-12's to acoged and silenced C8-SFW's is completely recoil free and thats the majority of streamers and youtubers  
---
Im guessing that ubisoft thinks its too big of a hassle to actually do anything about it, same with people abusing aiding software for the deaf to get unfair location awareness, EVERYONE fucking uses that shit unfortunately and its disgusting
---
clickbait btw and just a troll of Interro
---
#F
---
Not a valid excuse try again
---
They put the f in john f Kennedy
---
Tip: use jackal with the shotgun as the secondary. This allows you to bring smokes and still provide soft destruction. Also allows vertical play which is really useful on a good few maps.
---
I had a dream where I went to the John F. Kennedy dick museum, and it was just a guy's house where the walls were filled with framed pictures of dicks he suspected could be John F. Kennedy's
---
Lol, id recommend maybe switching to PC that helles for me
---
Ty!
---
Lol
---
If you look at the photo closely you can actually notice he did not claim the kill and rather an error occurred when the game registered it as his kill despite the real killer being a Glaz main on the grassy knoll
---
Let me guess . Military grade protection ?
---
Meant it could have decent detail
---
I saw the title, and I thought it was the For Honor subreddit. I got all excited, i thought we won the war!!!
---
Oh have you reached out to ubi?
---
each to their own I guess :P

Absolutely, I think it’s a beautiful piece of art and very well done, just not my taste.

thanks I think?

Warning, the Council of High Intelligence and Educational Findings (C.H.I.E.F.), has detected an "uwu". This is a code BRUH #4 level threat. Stay indoors and do not interact with cringe weebs until the threat has been classified as "it". Unless the code BRUH is retracted, "uwu" will be classified under "not it" until further notice.
---
That is really well done
---
I hate people like this, they make the whole game worse, and I honestly wish they would play an other game
---
The moment you hear the word "bro" that pretty much is a red flag that you are dealing with half wits.
---
Who do you play?
---
Yeh it’s got meme sound effects what’s your problem
---
That doesn’t mean it is automatically good
---
Sorry. Ment or* pdw or semi shotgun
---
As in jackals pdw or m59
---
Havent put much thought into guns honestly just the gadget.
---
You edit a video with siege clips and put music and sound effects then talk
---
Its 25 actually
---
This is the first thing I post and your being toxic about it
---
Ok. I didn’t know I don’t play on console.
---
Well its not that good. Sorry *insert lenny face*
---
Inb4 comments about how i was should have died
---
You got it all wrong, he shouldn’t have gotten damage because on his screen you are still looking at him with your shield up
---
Happy cake day!
---
That cosmetic is so disgusting.
---
Don't worry, always happy to help everyone to know most recent or older news!
---
Well sorry you don’t like it
---
WW2 wouldn't have been so bad if it was the weebs instead of the Jews
---

---
Honestly I don’t know. Just thought I would mention the changes I thought made sense
---
But it’s you...!?!
---
I was pretty versatile and played what the team needed but I usually floated around.
---
Attack - buck, ash, valk, sledge and occasionally fuse and glaze
---
Defend - valk, ela, mute and a little of lesion and mira

Thanks! :)
---
I only have 2 within 3 years 😅. Mute’s P226 MK25 and IQ’s 552 Commando
---
So, you've saved up renown and bought each OP individually or did you get some from season passes?
---
Thanks c:
---
Bruh you finna have the jfkexperience?
---
Thank you, my Lords
---
Now I wanna see it
---
Whom’st the frick downvoted me
---
Ash doesn't even get to plant before she drops dead with defuser and makes her team mad
---
ez claps
---
&gt;I still believe we need a sub menu of reporting that says what the offense was. Each report option has a level of severity on how quickly Ubisoft reviews that player. 
---
Getting that next season
---
Thats a neato idea
---
Lol ur welcome
---
Very well done tattoo!
---
Bc youre a coward and giving your team a disadvantage even if you are downed
---
Nia's a catgirl
---
I shall upvote to counter
---
Yeah
---
Nice
---
Thank you, allied one
---
Those guys are bots thats why
---
That's alot of frag grenades. And a nitro ce- wait a minute...
---
Ok
---
&lt;3
---
Hol up there cunt
---
Ah, that's hot, that's hot
---
Yeah I know right, everybody I meet is fucking Beaulo and people in gold 3 out here playing like bots
---
I can't believe THATCHER gun didn't get taken from you.
---
3,5k on 4 different accounts...
---

---
Nah bro you’re a hacker get banned hahahah :|
---
Fooling lazer turrets
---
So like low copper on PC
---
Ash is from Israel fuckwit this sub is so retarded
---
fun fact: putting r/redditsings in the middle of the song ruins it
---
When you realize it's a loop
---
Xxmentalman . You nailed it i have an elite and mnk and im so much better with my elite controller no need for me to even use my mnk in plat ranked even if 7 of the 10 players are using mnk game play knowledge and knowing your recoil on guns is how you get good not by blaming mnk.
---
No, do not do that.
---
Yea but since when was jew an insult and I’m scrolling through popular, anti-semitic fuckwit
---
metal
---
I’m only in low gold because I suck and almost only solo queue, I don’t care about my rank that much. Down in lower gold I almost never get the problem, even in casual where I will play high gold and low play players I almost never get ddos’ed, but I see it all the time everywhere else.
---
Star Platinum! The World!
---
nope
---
well yes, that is what Jaeger Corps is.
---
Fun fact nobody really cares about kd, don’t drop to copper and ruin their day just for a meaningless number
---
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
---
Tachanka...I've come to bargain.
---
Thanks, don't want this ruining anyone's games, but thought it was funny enough to share.
---
Maybe nøkk the danish operator is actually danish.
---
Are you sure causes last time I checked (on consle) you could turn on and off maps for casual
---
Denmark doesn't exist. It's a conspiracy theory
---
*a welsh cat girl
---
Reason?
---
I don't see this to be as exploitable as it's very situational but it's still somewhat of a problem in those certain situations :/.
---
During your 10 matches to get ranked you have an MMR, it's just hidden. So during one of those 10 matches, you reached your highest MMR.
---
I wouldn’t recommend doing this because it’s extremely unfair, but if you want some advice then if you leave a game it doesn’t count towards your KD, so with that what you will, don’t leave too many though because it will ban you forever!
---
Reported for rule 3.
---
I get what you mean but I mean it sucks to join in progress every game. It’d be cool if people that regularly finish their games got prioritized for new matches or if you completed a streak of games, it’s prioritize you for a new game or something. Plus I always join right at the end of the prep phase so I have to sit out an entire round.
---
still woulda been better if jäger’s name was tennis shoes...
---
You're a jäger main, it's in your nature to be unintentionally toxic ;P
---
For everyone that keeps saying "Just play T hunt" 
---
T Hunt runs like pure garbage on console. A solid 30 fps, max. It isnt a reliable way to learn how to shoot like it is on PC, instead you just have to be patient and get better with time
---
Mayhaps
---
no, I came
---
Yeah but the American market is huge.  And while certain people may not like us, it's nothing compared to the hate Israel gets from some countries in the middle east. 
---
Also Ash is Israeli iirc.
---
If only we got a tool that allows us to win those angles that are looking at your spawn area before spawning in. 
---
Idk maybe in year 5 they'll add an operator with a "drone" that they can use before spawning in as an attacker.
---
Is that keemstar
---
I was going to ask why they would make the setting like that automatically..but then I remembered it's Ubisoft we are talking about
---
Thanks
---
Any advice on how to handle panicking?
---
I'll look into that. Either way, I rarely play Thunt so it doesn't affect me much, but maybe I might now.
---
Don't mix up webs and furries, that's fucking insulting to japan and weebs
---
Go to the operator tab and do the math lol
---

I also believe you have add more icons by putting them in colons I.e: without quotations "My Mains :Blitz: :Vigil: :Zofia:" not too sure about proper format tho.
---
Oh boy, I do it all the time. Sometimes you're just going to panic, but what I've gotten into the habit of is just always expecting someone around every corner, even if it makes no sense for them to be there. 
---
Better safe than sorry
---
Fuck ma you have a hard cars of downs
---
lol no, it runs at 60-70, turn off vsync...
---
NoOoO I nEeEd AcOg To dO gOoD
---
No, that would be your mother!
---
You are correct, much worse than weebs.
---
Like I've been there and I get it. Just right now theres no real fix to this, someones gonna miss out on something regardless. Theres no fair option unless to actually punish leavers.
---
Jesus that guy at the end.
---
Wasn't really begging, but mkay
---
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like Castro?
---
Well it sure helps.
---
Go fuck yourself
---
That Cav was really bad
---
Yeah, I just checked an old thread and that was mentioned. 
---
Really dumb of Ubisoft to turn on Vsync by default.
---
lol we just played you right?
---
To be fair, unless it's a twitch drone I dont care as Mozzie. I actually also shoot drones on prep phase too, that way I can snag their reserve drones and then they have none.
---
A lot
---
true, considering it’s not even properly integrated
---
what is CNC machine？
---
Let’s do that then. Case closed boys, join in progress is no more.
---
Good for you man. I wish more people realize how horrible it is to use MnK on console.
---
Op does not like the new pick and ban I think
---
Wow I watched that for too long
---
I like it. Weird op... very weird
---
I also like it but people are different
---
ooo a nice one
---
Wait I know the roxy person he doesn’t act like this he competes for fair gameplay

Depends on circumstances.  If it’s 5v1, yeah.  If it’s 2v1, well...  If you play your cards right, you can dominate.
---
Neither can u
---
Just fyi you can turn off any map in the matchmaking settings so you don’t get those maps in terrorist hunt.
---
Not it's mustard gas
---
Seeing as Maverick is situational, good in some maps/sites and useless on others, it makes him a balanced operator. He is getting a nerf to his torch anyways - it's being made louder.
---
Ops that are OP or unbalanced are considered ones that are ALWAYS useable (in high tier matches at least).
---
Why would it? It followed all the rules of the convention.
---
It was at a closed convention so it was hardly public.
---
Hmmm yes the floor is made out of floor
---
Yes.
---
People who do it don’t deserve to play this game, Ubi’s best bet at this point is to just allow it but seperate queues. Im so fucking sick of going against clans on the other team of full mnk. Its so bad in plat 3/gold 1 pretty much every 2 or 3 games
---
Simple. You change into the outfit inside the convention.
---
Might want to add this to r/perfectloops

---
Look i dont like playing fps games on controllers as well. i wish they do add native K&amp;M support and have K&amp;M lobbies. 
---
But thats not going to stop the adapter issue, Just like hacking on pc, Glitch abusers and server DDOS players, online gaming communities are extremely toxic and will use anything to get a 1up.  
---
Also anti cheat software wont so anything since A: Console games cant run anti cheat softwares like battleye on the background so thats up to the hardware guys like Microsoft and sony. B: The hardware guys have their own official M&amp;Ks that have emulation support to trick games that has native support turned off .
---
Glad you realised your mistake. Hopefully more of them wake up
---
Man that nerf to shields hit like a fuckin truck.
---
I’ve played a lot of ranked too and when he ain’t banned, which is rarely, he hasn’t made a significant impact. So both of us is just telling from personal experience.
---
Wdym they can't run it in the background ? It's not that hard to make software that can detect rapid changes in sensitivity. It's more than just hardware. Who are the hardware guys lol ?
---
Hold on theres two of them? I read the first one years ago I never knew there was another though...
---
Headshot + 20

How did you do it?

Nice recoil control on that bad boy.
---
You can’t escape from cav
---
You can still report them on the console itself, if their are enough reports or hard evidence, they will get their account banned on that console.
---
The question is, what console?
---

---
Haven't seen any mira players lately. Did she get nerfed? (I just got back into the game after almost a year)
---
Today I also had something similar turn the time of this post In csgo I headshoted someone named JFK with a awp
---
Think the highest I've been is gold 3. I never really cared for ranked on Siege and neither did my friends. Sure in ranked we'd get a bit more serious but just a tad. Normally it was all about the memes.
---
Well considering he is banned 99 percent of the time, the stats are kind of on my side. You can't just dismiss it all as people who are as you say "brainless bandwagonning"
---
&gt;Wdym they can't run it in the background ?
---
Almost all of the consoles highly limit what data the applications running on the console has access to. 
---
&gt;It's not that hard to make software that can detect rapid changes insensitivity.
---
These adapters that are converting the K&amp;M into controller dont need to change the sens multiple times mid game. They just run on high sens. But A lot of controller users also run on high sens. 
---
&gt;It's more than just hardware. 
---
Its a external 3rd party hardware thats doing the conversions. This is a console hardware issue that Microsoft and Sony needs to fix not the game developers. 
---
&gt;Who are the hardware guys lol ?
---
Microsoft and Sony.

Silly mustard is what you put on your hot dog
---
Initially started with dude spamming his mic with a high pitched noise.  TKs the 3rd round and his buddy tries to say it was an accident.  Team killing or dropping from the match happens more often than not.  I just random queue to play when my friends can not.
---
Smurfs have what advantage exactly?  They are better then you?

Silly gas is what comes out your poophole

Alright that’s good then lol

Buck, alibi, lesion, mira

Can i have my ACOG back
---
She is a danish operator so you know maybe she would look like one
---
This is true, it was more me being frustrated with him because he was trying to throw earlier
---
Worst addition to a map in the history of ever. I fucking hate that room. And yes, they did add it back. It was gone for all of a week at the launch of Phantom Sight.

Good chat, nice to have a mature conversation on the internet for once
---
Right back at you good sir.
---
nice
---
if you listen to subreddit it was the best map of all time. lets be real... it was trash
---
So I should avoid newcomer playlist?
---
Honestly feels like I sometimes I get people my level and sometimes I get people who just shit on everyone in casuals even though I'm only level 14.
---
“Great now those teleport hacks are on console”
---
No. it was a bad idea in LoL its a worse idea in siege
---
He also takes double damage from Smokes gadget
---
I have a weird multiplier, so no straight advice here lol. I'd say go into a t-hunt and practicing aiming with one of your mains and focus on how you aim at places, and how well you can transfer between targets. Better yet, if you have the space to, record yourself during hunts or casuals and try to nitpick at what you can better yourself at.  
---
Sens overall becomes a more preference and space related thing, as everyone moves their hands differently.  
---
For FOV, 90 is typically what most people run at unless they're on absolute potatoes, or they prefer the closer up look with a smaller FOV. Your turning rate will be different than others if you run at a different FOV than the calculations you're looking at, so keep that in mind.
---
If it doesn’t matter then perhaps Ash mains should stop crying about their crutch being taken away.
---
This video is testament to the fact that lean spamming has not been properly fixed.

Is that Jagers acog back there?

Nice 😏

Is that a Airsoft or real. I’m more interested in that lower.
---
Question. Does thermiting a castle make sense? You could just breach charge it, punch it a bunch, or Ash it. I understand maybe if you need through it FAST. Am I missing something
---
That's one way I saw it too. But if the exact same information is already publicly announced to all the players of R6, then what more rules are they violating to notify a specific person of it? :/
---
&gt;I quit because I realized how toxic it
---
Yeah it takes time when you're stupid a f.
---
Give her MP5SD at least. Suppressed and ACOG. It fits her quiet approach really well.
---
It's airsoft, but if I could legally own a real one I would. Ireland doesnt allow guns without a valid reason (farmer or in a gun club).
---
Selfish people exist everywhere. My own squad was overloaded with them. Eventually my bro and I left to form our own. We communicate with each other in Hindi but we communicate with anybody else in English.
---
Me and you might have the same ps4 of that's the case
---
Depends on where you're at and the time of the day.   
---
Try going for casuals and restarting at max 2 mins, because that's typically too long for a wait unless you're up at the darkest hours of the night lolol
---
3D printed with white PLA and spray painted it black, once it dried, I scratched it up to make it look worn.
---
Well he does get pretty strong vision penalty for moving while his gadget is active.
---
Is that thermite putting down a regular breach charge because that’s not the regular thermite charge he has
---
Which leads to it abusing by these kind of players:(
---
send it to support

Nah maybe silver 1, it takes in account the rank of the last season, bur should be close to gold.

Can you share a link for it

That door tall asf

Black ice isn’t that special, stop overhyping

I'd just be googling it

Isnt there colourblind options ingame? Well either way idk anyone who is colourblind so idk how useful they are.

Agreed. Tachanka is the best operator and he doesn't have one.

Sensitivity is all preference. There isn't a best sens. Do the dot test in a custom game. See how well you can follow a bullet hole strafing side to side while ADSd and Hip Fire. If you keep going past the dot, lower your sens, if you cant keep up with the dot. Increase it.  
---
Just fiddle around, I like my sens where I have room for a 360 on my mousepad from left to right. Makes it easier to 180 to avoid getting shot in the back.
---
for example buck's automatic weapon with holo is good and doesn't have acog
---
Had the same issue, searched reddit, tried a few fixes, nothing worked, sometimes it worked if I restarted queue, sometimes it didn't. Changed the game to an ssd and the issue disappeared.
---
This is really weird since an ssd should not have an impact on the matchmaking time, only the loading, but that's what fixed it for me.
---

I've had 84,000 ping

Since when is a minute considered a rush?
---
Wow is it like that alot?
---
Im shocked!
---
Probably just maintenance? Can't see any patch notes anywhere

even in not estimated time measures?

How the fuck is this cosplay?

Me sitting on skylight the entire round

You should be careful, those spawn kill are insane
---
It was jumping all over the place and then it shot up and then he left. I think I still have a pic of it somewhere. It was on console too.
---
It’s shorter than 3.5 minutes. That would’ve been a horrible rush
---
IDK cause I wasn't lagging, it was just someone DDOSing during selection phase, everyone had 10,000+ ping, I think I hit the highest that game.

This only means that he should have dual wield secondaries

They probably preffered to push out the update ASAP instead of optimizing patch size.

Then it kind of becomes too much like an EMP for me. Others might disagree but for me, I don't see a real need for this operator with Thatcher there, without making him/her too strong.

Ubisoft had to remove the terrorist Hunt achievements because no one ever completed them and they replaced those achievements with really easy ones instead.

Basically no one is realistic  even sledge has a hammer which can break and big enough hole to crouch through.
---
It happens sometimes but I’ve never seen three people potato all at once.
---
maby
---
Yep. I got eager; wanted to show it but this photo from the pro studio had not arrived yet :)
---
How many characters do you need to fill a line? Assuming the length of your name matters?
---
Thanks gamer
---
STOP using EMOTICONS. It ruins everything.
---
Has a realistic aspect if you're strong enough you can break a hole in dry wall with a hammer
---

I have black ice for it so I have to use it.

Ok. You are different. So there goes your karma. Upvoted.
---
It's honestly like being in high gold with a sprinkle of actual coppers, given the amount of smurfs.
---
I mean, it’s not too far from the mira at all. Sure it could be much closer but it’s not unusable.
---
Might be light escape from Tarkov where you go in get gear fight hordes of zombies and try to escape
---
Let me know if you figure it out
---
True. Just much more difficult to use accurately.
---
Damn I've never thought to use that that way. I've done stuff like making it look like one guy said "don't bring bandit I have a strat" and they didn't bring a bandit for chalet basement. No idea if it was actually because of what I typed though
---
It has a realistic aspect compared to other games however it is no where near realistic even since the start. You can pull reinforcements out of you.
---
Omg I love it. If you have or can make a Lesion version I'll make it my background.
---
How active is the in-game LFG?  You can always find a group looking for coppers on Xbox NA servers.  It's not ideal (since you'll usually be acting as a pusher), but at least that would negate the smurf effect.
---
I hope they do cause it was one of the most fun maps IMO (for casual)
---
Sorry to admin that I contribute to all the smurfs
---
Ubi might add it back like they did with yaucht and favela doubt it though because it's reworked. You can still play old hereford in the first situation but some areas are blocked off.
---
So fucking funny

Ubi saw you using sheild ops in 1v1s and decided to punish you, what’s wrong?
---
Your definition of “quick” is a lot different than mine
---
Too much COD
---
Realistic aspect: His shield is bulletproof
---
Not C4 proof a C4 would destroy most of a building and him
---
Lolll
---
Technically an ace, also technically a 4k.  The community can’t decide 🤷🏼‍♀️ Nice
---
Yeah but the realistic aspect is that the shield is bulletproof
---
Go into t hunt and find it out yourself. Harsh but true.
---
Thank you so much! Spent a lot of time on it!
---
I HAVE NO HEROIN NOW
---
That's impressive.
---
Well yeah i get that but siege is a game about strategy. It's not about getting the most kills, it's about working as a team to win with unique operator abilities. So if everyones just running around with shotguns, it's not really going to be siege anymore. Who knows, maybe it'll be a mode lots of players will like, but personally for me, not one I'll be playing.
---
Even though jaeger basically steals clips from other players to use on his own videos, at the very least he wasn’t monetizing his videos before, I think he is now Cus he needs money, bikini bohdi makes both informational and entertaining videos, try his channel out

By the way were friends and it was all chill for those of you trowing hate

Then simply don't play it if you don't like it, your not being forced to play

what the fuck? Why he would need to be bandit for barbed wires?
---
Sorry I said I wasn't going to reply but Holy fuck how retarded do you have to be. This game year one season one was realistic. my "dream" is to be the best Real Estate agent in London. So you never came close to that apart from the fact that I'm now realising I may have to try and explain how a mortgage works to someone as fucking retarded as you. The game has always had a basis of realism in the ops ability other than cav. And I feel sorry for someone to have to live with themselves knowing their retarded but tbh I shouldn't have expected more from and ash/jager main
---
Looks about right. Nice work tho.
---
Well can you at least recommend some because I asked a discord of twenty people and they all said Jäger himself?

Repost

That was a pretty dead clip...and in casual

Something's fishy here.

In casual, I'd much rather play old Hereford than new Hereford.  Not sure how feasible it is (even if Ubi is willing to give up on new Hereford, which I doubt).

How does this relate to the post?

(Also it’s casual chill out)

Bro one day you'll grow up and realise you're not going to save your self or others from a mass shooter or murderous gunman by karate chopping them. I wish you the best of luck in this world because sadly you actually think like that and you're going to realise that martial arts isnt going to do shit in today's world. I really hope you get a wake up call sooner rather than later and realise what horrendously stupid your points are.

Oh God...

Sadly I didn't cav jumped out window and stole the ace... One of the players on the enemy team dm me saying I should kill the cav for steeling my acr

Alright, I’ll remember that

I’m sorry, I’m confused. What happened?

HDD speed doesn't affect FPS, right?
---
You and me both, my dude.
---
It can effect the speed of your computer witch can effect fps
---
What happened? I don’t get it
---
team kill
---
Even before multiplayer games people were getting each other to Alt F4 in ICQ lol.
---
I need more plz
---
It was good for site building and deleting walls, which it can still do, but yeah it was mostly a meme gun.
---
Oh watching for them ain't hard at all. I however want rid of them for that very reason; I've gotten sick and tired of the idiots thinking they're good enough to not day peeking from the most common angle on the map, making it a 4v5 before they even get in the building.
---
I've gotten more sick of the idiots trying and failing and putting the team at a disadvantage than those that succeed while I'm on Attack.
---
Username checks out :D
---
Are you stupid? This a real common equipment
---
I have seen it years ago in siege, and it takes some practise to pull this off. How many times you seen it in game?
---
Or, each team picks the operators that the opponents have to play, then each player picks between the 5 operators chosen by the enemies for which one they will play
---
Doing this on minecraft servers with color code
---
It could put an eye out! - love, mommy
---
He made it seem like the other guy said to team kill him while he goes afk.
---
Apparently Indiana Jones and Indiana Jane are the best choice for counter-terrorism units, are they.  
---
Okay now I actually want Indiana Jones in this game. MAKE IT HAPPEN UBI
---
I don’t get why people care so much about getting a rank when they know they don’t deserve it. I don’t know about y’all but I feel guilty and dont feel as I deserve my rank if I got boosted or cheated in order to obtain it.
---
Don't fail
---
*cries in console*
---
Imagine paying $100+ just to get a blue shape on your screen

It’s clean as hell, especially with the real accents.

You do realize siege didn't invent this unit right?

You call yourselves gamers ? You're just a toxic kid with a dumb redditor. This isn't being a gamer, it'is being a mf. People complain everytime because of the bugs, glitches and hackers. And you think that being toxic deserves an award ?
---
100% sure this guys probably ddos’s servers if he’s guaranteeing ranks. Forwarding this to ubi
---
Very good effort
---
It's purple now, but yes, an expensive price for a bragging right that they don't deserve.
---
MY EYES
---
FUS
---
How is this toxic it’s a joke if you think this is toxic I don’t know how you can play any game. I think the guy who got team killed would have found it funny but then again you said you got kicked why didn’t you play ranked over casual I haven’t played casual in 2 years so I don’t know about the kicking much but can’t you just play ranked and have fun there
---
I've seen people try similar things, but I've never seen it successful.
---
The emoji wasn't needed
---
Yes, because the Danish frog men were a real thing, but in modern warfare seems like a little like a miss placement for frog men
---
That's a casual match dude.
---
My man just discovered code injection. Outstanding move.

Not a bad idea tbh

Funny how you talk about having a brain when you literally falsified the info I gave you which is being generous since you could've just been too dumb to watch the entire video. You exaggerated your claim that it takes 2 shots to injure when at 15 meters, the spread with/without the HB is unchanged and still RNG and the amount of pellets that he connected wouldn't have changed the STK. If you're dying to a shotgun at 15 meters because you don't know what cover is and you're unable to connect shots with a 800 RPM gun that can 3 shot a 3 speed with a semi auto then you're just bad, sorry to break it to ya. At that point, any gun would've killed you quicker, the shotgun probably gave you more of a chance than an SMG, or Kaid's slug shotgun, Jager's 416 or Maestro's LMG.
---
You know that castle is best used to deny angles instead of rotations, right?
---
Dude, it's literally just a joke. You don't have to be serious in casual. It's just a game.
---
All is forgiven

Ah yes, make sense. Thank you.

100K IQ play
---
This makes me both happy and sad.
---
I’m not flexing. They said an operator isn’t bad if they don’t have an acog. Literally the only possible way to agree with them and give proof that their claim is accurate, is to state that a good player has never used an Acog and is still good at the game. The only way to prove that is with stats.
---
Have you ever played high silver/gold on console?  Especially this season, that's a tough place to get out of. I don't if its the increase of MnK users, DDOSing, or sheer amount of people that are really good.
---
He used the chat to trick the other team to tk by saying he’s going to be afk
---
I'm a potato aimer so the more ammo definetely helps lol

I did try capitaos LMG today as well. And I think my first time ever playing cap lol. Love the ACOG on that.

---
&gt; I’m not talking from the killed point of view dumbass, I’m talking from the killer 
---
This makes no sense.
---
&gt;  given the fact that snapping onto someone with joysticks is a lil difficult 
---
Sounds like a console problem, in which case sorry but FPS games shouldn't balanced around console, especially when it can't even support hipfire lean and when its competitive scene is none existent.
---
Did you buy them with money
---
Well it shouldn't. Every player has this choice. You can play without cheats/hacks/glitches, or being tempted to try some of them against other players. You want to try them alone / with friends ? Why not ? It's part of the game after all. But in multi (regardless of it being Casual/Ranked), against players who just want to play without that bs ? That's disrespectful. This trick is funny to do, but is probably not for the entire enemy team, and then is toxic.
---
That’s the most I’ve seen taken away
---
Hover over ranked and there will be a thing that says "Guide" then the button you have to press
---
I got to plat only using shotguns lmao, easiest thing ever, and I am hardstuck gold on PC. You need to shut the fuck up Xbox normie and face the fact that console players are dogshit

On the right hand side (Larry's left elbow), says Antiquity trafficking, and there are Aztec building pictures next to it, just like what this leak has shown.

Something something "Crosscheck with Capitao anti-drug operation for common ground".

The jungle picture looks like an operator holding a silenced DMR. And on the sub-world map, Peru and Mexico are highlighted.

0 aim 3 kills.... no comment...
---
11 is fine as is. 12 not so much
---
Oh man that game was great 2 player! One of my last qualifying rounds the enemy team got really cocky and went power rangers. They wiped out my entire team and i wiped out theres. Got my first ace, and it was a 1v5, and it completely boned me outta copper lol. It was truly bittersweet.
---
I'm not saying its good, but my friends tried to derank to copper 4 and they said it took them forever. Like 5 stack had to abandaon a lot of matches and still took a while. I hear copper 4 is all diamonds bascially
---
I get around 150-200 fps in this game. 4-4, round starts, attackers spawn then about 20 secs later my team has FPS lag, enemy is most likely 5 premade guys but one of them left mid match and came back for last round (skiiies) that is why he left alone at the end screen...
---
You literally had 2 kills with the LMG lol.
---
Nah just the guy you killed must of not had a headset or earphones
---
just saw this video and just decided to try it in-game and it actially worked haha

What is this I’d love to play the sneaky op in this game?

It's been always fun to mess around with people like that. Also, this is a reminder that the chat STILL has no message history...
---
It’s the new modern warfare coming out
---
Hello inwardjoe, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cksdah/any_experience_with_this_visual_glitch_ive/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah rank only changes when you play ranked matches
---
I don't get what happened
---
I like it the old on was just to boring and plain
---
I tried this and it worked lmao
---
And he probably did. So did you, and all the players who upvoted. But I think about the killer and the killed. Being tricked while trying to have fun, that's kinda disgusting. Everyone can have fun without having to be a 100% toxic player.
---
What console you play on? Or you pc?
---
The top image will be the Defender who’s leaked to have a explosive shield and I’m guessing that’s what will be causing the explosion on the road
---
The bottom image will be the Attacker, who’s leaked to be able to grapple up hatches. With her looking like an explorer/adventure type it makes perfect sense that her gadget would be something she’d use whilst exploring also (Similer to Nomad developing her gadget during her travels)
---
Before these pics I wasn’t to sure about this season but now I’m hyped
---
The jungle picture looks like an operator holding a silenced DMR. And on the sub-world map, Peru and Mexico are highlighted. And if you scroll up, it shows a bigger South American continent picture again, those two pictures might be the Peru and Mexico operator, one with a big bolt sniper rifle.
---
This season hasnt been good to any of us.
---
this is hands down one of the most funniest shit I have ever seen
---
i love the r6 community
---
I don’t play this game lol. This is front page cuz it’s hilarious
---
Someone who knows what Castle is good for can be a huge game changer, someone who just blocks off the three main doors to site are just annoying and a waste of an op pick
---
"*comedy*"
---
I call it toxicity but to each his own
---
Thank you so so much! I spent a lot of time and it means a lot when people like you are so supportive!
---
I know it’s a lot
---
Woukd
---
I have just had a realization that my life experience has vastly differed from other people. Boba tea or tapioca milk tea has been such a staple of my life that I did not realize other people arent aware of it .
---
Also please give it a try. Its a delicious drink
---
Click the link to the video then! Much more entertaining and easier to listen to!
---
that would be perfekt
---
We were friends we just had a good laugh and went on with the game
---
H
---
Thank you so much I will!
---
you deserve it for playing blackbeard
---
Permadeath usually means your character is forever lost with 1 death. 
---
This either means in this context, you go through 1 long journey with a set of characters, for example 9, and if 2 of 3 players die, now only 7 are available throughout the journey. 
---
OR you just die once per match and dont come back. Could still have the journey stuff but it's lame to lose 1 of 3 players early.
---
It's most likely just a flashy way of saying you only die once per level, but I wanna play around with the first idea. If you do get to choose ops per level in a long set of levels, it introduces risk and strategy.
---
oh
---
A likely story
---
oh that’s nice
---
that tracker concept would be sick
---
Its strange since every other semi auto shotgun either have a similar or higher fire rate than the AA12 but also have more damage, better spread and range. Some of the pump actions have a higher DPS which is pretty sad for the only automatic shotgun in the game. They can increase the ROF to 300 and either buff the dmg to 30 and/or reduce the spread while also reducing its effectiveness at opening walls and its mag size from 30-20.
---
well it depends on your type of play.
---
assuming you know each operators utility and what they bring to the table
---
if you're someone who wants to run around well get fast operators like Ela, Vigil, Alibi, Maverick
---
if you care about gun power get Jackal, Zofia, Lesion, Maestro, Lion, Finka, Kaid (shotgun)
---
if you want to anchor and hold site or hold angle as attacker well get Mira, Zofia, Lion, Maestro, Kaid
---
not to forget Mozzie and Gridlock. Mozzie is really good even if you don't use the drones and has the best reload animation with a powerful gun. gridlock is good for blocking or delaying roamers trying to flank you and has a good LMG.
---
not sure about Nokk or Warden cuz they haven't shined yet.
---
Why use a suppressor? Anyone with a half decent headset and basic common sense can directionally locate suppressed shots unless it's Glaz from across the map, so why nerf your own damage when you could use a much more efficient attachment?
---
Gotta catch em all!
---
In higher ranks Jackal is underpicked and suffers simply because a) players drone efficiently and use comms and b) choosing him thus wastes a pick. In lower ranks he's oppressive because while his pings are less useful than a drone they require little to no skill to attain.
---
You're right, the bans are definitely QoL driven, and it's all the more reason to fix him.
---
None or reflex.
---
Please for the love of god let me use defenders on Thunt Classic
---
I know usually I used it because of its big drum and the high fire rate but I can spam any semi automatic shotgun faster than the aa-12 so there goes half of the use for it
---
B R U H
---
Well if your friends that's a different story
---
Toxic
---
Most likely officially announced at major and then release shortly after
---
Super Saiyan
---
Should look up why the removed it during alpha. There isn't a "yet" to soft breaching shields.
---
pellets\* and every shotgun fires 8 pellets from 1 shell.
---
🦀🦀$11🦀🦀
---
Yeah I dunno what that means
---
.                                              I gay
---
The true 3000 iq play!
---
that shotgun flick was so satisfying
---
That’s my intention 😎
---
That’s some chaotic evil shit
---
I was thinking the same thing when I read the edit.
---
In context of the post, the op would be a mute main for life since they have a TATTOO of HIM on their ARM... so the answer to my question is yes, you are.
---
Yeah the highest peak you achieve in R6 ranked is what you get. We dont have rank degradation.
---
I probably will if I ever see it anywhere. Definitely not gonna find anything like that where I live though lmao
---
Where's THE LORD???
---
And gold
---
I’m plat and I wouldn’t change a single thing. Maybe clash for lesion
---
No... I do not just say "fuck it" I DO IT ALL THE GOD DAM TIME
---
That was a Chi Long Qua move right there
---
downvoted for emoji
---
They sounds great pretty clear and loud without the surround sound in game. With the surround sound they don’t sounds as good in game.
---
What's your first order of business?!
---
Jager acog
---
THIS BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!
---
Jesus you really got fucked
---
Man, that is nothing like my experience in casual. Its usually two guys chasing each other around shooting each other, one guy AFK and one guy barricading every door within 100 ft of the obj/jumping through the first window he see's and dying.
---
Idk but it’s nice
---
With the way the new ranked worked it’s still very possible to win. This lobby lag can make your ranked experience awful yeah but you can make up for it by wasting these guys time. People that do this are typically boosters being paid by players to boost their ranks. Never quit these matches. Waste their time and make them annoyed. The only way it’s possible to win is if you get 2 defensive rounds on overtime. But if you’re about to win it almost always results in the guy who’s doing it crashing the server all together. But that just means you won because they gave up. It’s infuriating when it happens but don’t give up because a win in your heart is very much possible.
---
So you're telling me you will be facing gun barrel to alter settings on your sight ,mr. "I shoot guns in real life" ?
---
Actually looking now, I can't find single holo sight that would look like that with battery facing user, so only thing you could have meant is that it's mounted way too far in front, otherwise I have no idea.
---
 I know it too now, thanks
---
I love you made art about a cosplau of ela instead of ela her self
---
So they give u a great sound and every detail?that almost gives u advantage in game?
---
Rewarding toxicity, good going mate
---
Glance, obviously.
---
This is like making an essay longer by repeating the words.
---
Cursed image
---
Fixing *Glitches*
---
What if we use 100% of our brain?
---
I'm sorry, wdymbt?
---
Fukin toxic
---
because its rare. That is all the different classes mean. It has nothing to do with how they look. 
---
I mean, do you actually want the best looking skins to be nearly impossible to get?? That would be stupid.
---
#as you can see * *snort* * your lagging due to the 3 yellow and red symvols in the top right corner, therefore op is a big doofus head and should uninstall
---
No problem
---
His gadget is called Glance, watch is part of his gadget, or so I assume by the way he is using it...yeah.
---
Another one : 
---
#Nøkk Nøkk
---
Oh, I meant the real life equivalent
---
Personally, I haven't encountered them so far.
---
Your reasoning?
---
It's not.
---
I doubt you played then, but again, you don't provide any examples or reasons... so I can't really argue your opinion.
---
I want a siege movie.
---
Oh
---
Same bro, they say you can but they don’t tell you how
---
I totally get what you guys mean. It does look suspicious as fuck. I am 100% over everything I love in life, this was pure luck. I just was panicking and super shaky as you can tell from when I killed Castle my aim started going wayyyy above his head. I just panicked and prefired a shot on accident and it was just insanely lucky and accurate. No word of a lie and I am sure there are going to be people who doubt me but I have never, ever in ANY game, installed, or used hacks of ANY sort.
---
There everywhere in high level ranked
---
The servers are at lowest peaks rn, its raining with hackers, and ubi isn’t doing a thing
---
It’s in the game, yeah, but it’s coded in to that one situation.  I think it would be more difficult to code it back into casual while its successor is still around.
---
Instagram refugee!!!!!!
---
Once saw a person do something like this to a guy on my team. He legit thought he got hacked until we explained it to him
---
Oh agreed if you use lower ranks to get up then your shit should be taken down.
---
Be sneaky and flank them.
---
*kick vote intensifies*
---
Oh, okay. I've gotten to Gold 3, max this season [mostly as I soloqueued until I found a 5 stack to play with], but I'm right now in Silver 1 as I've seen more and more Gold players using M&amp;K and crouch/lean spamming, and I won't be surprised if DDOSers exist in droves in that rank as well.
---
I Wanted to make a joke about some movie featuring siege like "Brest Fortress" or maybe just about "The Siege" movie but I am way too lazy to do that, so you will have to insert your own right here.
---
But yeah, CGI siege movie would be neat, but you know how everyone will go "T.C. is rolling in his grave" and stuff.
---
interesting, i didnt know that, and i’ll have to start changing my attachments.
---
I quit both solo-queuing and casual and it’s the best R6S decision I ever made. It’s amazing the difference having 4-5 players with mics in a party can have.
---
It’s not even hard to find like-minded players in the age of LFG posts and other social tools we have at our fingertips. When I’m not playing with friends I can still find a group in the time it takes to load up the game, so it really doesn’t require much from me to make my gaming experience far more enjoyable.
---
Occasionally you get tryhards and jerks, but often the party doesn’t like them either so they get replaced in between matches. I’ve seen a huge drop in trolling, team killing, throwing, and general douchebaggery; even the opposing team is less likely to ruin their own game when you compare it to the cesspool of casual.
---
Wtf are you even on about? All he did was do an unconscious flick to a target on floor, if you think this looks like hacks you belong in copper.
---
Thanks!
---
Which is exactly what I’m trying to stop.
---
898764 - sub 1m account baby yeah!
---
I love how someone typed “Hi reddit” in the chat. They knew.
---

---
I mean, it very much depends on your region and how many friends you have.
---
Low gold can be an absolute nightmare to get out of unless you are insanely better than your rank would suggest.
---
I have a friend with 2k hours in the game who is a hard stuck gold 1, simply because he enjoys soloQ'ing ranked.
---
I can bring him into high plat matches and he can do okay, but in lower ranks you need to rely entirely on yourself and ignore your team 99% of the time.
---
Also certain regions have different skill levels, a gold on US servers is not equal to a gold on OCE or EU servers.
---
Add bos g acog plz
---
I’m a solid gold 1 90% of the time but I have this one friend that sucks which sucks cause he’s my best friend and as much as I love playing with him he carry’s down so hard. But I still love to play with him and have fun.
---
Ah!
---
It’s technically cheating if it’s unlicensed, which... most are.  A ton of people forget that Sony licensed a device that allows mnk play, though.  Not to mention the disabled community that cannot play normally with a controller but may be able to set something up on mnk for console.  But dedicating the time to a PC is the better option, I’ll agree.
---
Here's the link for customer support to report players. Also just so you know posting people's usernames and accusing them in this sub isn't allowed, but more often than not the mods won't catch it.

---
This must be extremely rare
---
Never saw that before, got any source? Would like to read more about that
---
It did happen on either Bank or Consulate, don't remember which. Even if it's just one map (though it's in the newcomer queue cause I'm playing with my friend who just got the game), it still shouldn't happen, yet it did.
---
You’ve cleansed the server of evil NICE
---
If you can soloQ that close to plat, you are probably already good enough to be one, especially if you're against 5 stacks.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
He obviously wasn’t
---
as soon as the last kill of the game happens you can leave and still roll for a pack if you win.
---
I tend to disagree, you just have to understand how it works
---
By whom?
---
Hello SiddhuBatsy, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ckuypp/maverick_code_bundle_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Nice.  Now I can hate myself without the breaks!
---
It took me longer to grind from gold 1 to plat 3 than it took me to get from plat 1 to diamond, gold is legit a nightmare rank.
---
The difference between a plat 1 and a diamond is that the diamond will 5 stack and have refined their play style.
---
Gold is a rank where unless you can literally carry your team every game you are basically fucked to soloQ out of.
---
That’s just good ol’ rainbow six cheese for ya 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Throwing her holograms in front of doors and barricades is good
---
First round as alibi, got voted out straight away 👍
---
It's a fundamental issue with the siege engine. I can only imagine the nightmare of trying to solve the issue.
---
If i recall correctly they actually DID do a recoil buff about this time, so I think you're right.
---
does this count as spawn peeking?
---
We used to do this in AOL and MSN instant messenger
---
Oooooooooh 100000 IQ plays right there.
---
Sorry for cutting a little short.
---
Epic gamer moment
---
This is probably gonna sound rude from my part, but I have the least intention of being rude.
---
But neither of that is a solution to the issue, that just pauses symptoms. We don't ignore serial killers or pedophiles, we arrest and prosecute them.
---
Yeah on the bomb. Didn’t choose snackbeard btw... auto pick 😅
---
*uses an emoji in the title*
---
Me: \*strained upvote\*
---
Cool. :)
---
Unranked bc I got a new job and can't play much anymore :(
---
(4-1 in my ranked placements and at 3500mmr accounrding to r6stats though)
---
Ranked doesn't have night time in the map pool anymore, and for whatever reason the mist is there at night but not in the day.
---
DID YOU JUST *DISRESPECT* THE DP-28
---
Why don’t bully her brother again.
---
Why Frost looking like some grandma
---
Bitch that my Pringle
---
Oh shoot, I didn’t realize it was DansomeWoja at first
---
He shot through the shield, I was at 100 health
---
*instant pistol shoot when someone tries to knife you*
---
Yep I think so
---
I was doing this trick in WoW 10 years ago.  And in warcraft 3 15 years ago.
---
SQL injection in R6s😏
---
Blitz is good to ban
---
Get you get a $10 chibi or a $20 chibi?
---
Yes I know so
---
Fix what that’s honestly pretty balanced
---
Blessed, thank you
---
That's what I call missed opportunity.
---
A skin like that should be used by Hibanana.
---
They are
---
It’s actually sad. I lost like 200 mmr just because of this.
---
Blitz' shield is not impenetrable. Assuming you hit the shield in the right spot, the shield will not protect you. But per the video, your head was visible and that is where he shot you. The bullet tracers even show the position where the bullets came from. Again, completely legit kill.
---
Yikes
---
Genius : 100
---
Chicago server?
---
yes
---
 Seems useless compared to Jagger, but with our opinions and suggestions we can define improvements  
---
\-the damage reduction was not said, but what if the grenade damage was only 20 when inside the capsule?  
---
 
---
\-What if he could intercept more grenades than Jagger's device?  
---
\-maybe bulletproof capsules?
---
even thinking about the loadout  we can imagine some balancing
---
Absolutely beautiful

unless your using hacks, no

Comment editing is a powerful tool.
