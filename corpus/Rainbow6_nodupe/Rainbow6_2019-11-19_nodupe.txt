Hey there ya’ll, commissioner of this icon here! (I made a reddit account just for this.)

You guys can use this icon on your profiles and whatnot, just be sure to credit /u/naphta1ene for his awesome work! May you spread the good word of the Kermite/Thermit army my friends.

When a projectile enters its radius the fuse resets, it gets pulled in onto the magnet and the detonates normally.
---
You already can in custom matches lol I agree with others and it’s a no from me dawg.
---
Good idea, it would be great to see somebody detonate a C4 right beside him by accident
---
Also look at Nomad in final kill cam
---
While your driving with your drone to the objective you see a Mozzie hold a sign saying “drone check” as he violently sticks a robot on your drone.
---
Be cool I guess, don’t think it would apply much cause most people just throw and instantly detonate it. What would be good is if they have it in their hand and it detonates as good players sometimes pre pull out the c4 so the attackers don’t hear the rip sound. Dokk seems to be in a good state rn, her win rate is very balanced.

Wham

Worst map, I can‘t understand why it‘s still in ranked.
---
Hmm, yes these comment are made out of words
---
I probably will, thank you
---
I know what you mean, but people make smurf accounts to get better stats after becoming a better player too, or to get out of high gold\low plat once they are really good so they can get insta placed in plat or diamond
---
Mobile or web?
---
oh no.
---
Yep definitely, even with a pro controller u can’t do those quick movements
---
At least matched with 3-2 and not just a bunch of solo players
---
On mobile: the 3 dots at the top of the main subreddit screen and pick change user flair.

It says I've got between 12 and 14 maps when I swap back and forth between ranked and casual but I'm fairly sure I've never done all that yet. Keep seeing maps with like a big pagoda and stuff in it

I'd really like to say well done but ehhhhhhhhhhhh. Personally not a fan but glad you're making other people happy.
---
The only operator you’re allowed to pick if everyone else is recruit
---
Cav?
---
I'm gonna say it's easy to Ace with frost but her gun is so easy to use with angled grip extended barrel and red dot
---
What’s  wrong with him? (Genuinely curious because I don’t watch his videos very often)
---
I think it resets the timer though
---
On what planet is Warden better than Nokk? Plus, the speed buff didn't do anything for him. His core gadget is the problem, not his armor/speed rating.
---
Ubi made him 2-2, and what did it do for him? He's still just as bad. When you buff horse-shit, to dog-shit, it's still shit at the end of the day.
---
Jäger vs. Yeaga
---
Don’t always rely on sounds, audio is fucked. Use you eyes, common entry points. Map knowledge applies to usual peaking points. Use them valk cams!
---
Every time
---
You have to admit that she's weird. She's basically just a super baity or super aggro thatcher, but if you try to play her as anything in between it's just riskier than taking thatcher, for no apparent benefit.
---
That’s not even the point anymore. It’s how shitty they run. And there support isn’t helpful at all. The skin isn’t the problem. It just revealed the problem.
---
Okay bronze :)
---
When did u start playing siege
---
New weapons YEARS ago weren't an issue, because not all stats were in the game.
---
AS OF 2019, enough weapons have been added into this game that cover all damage ranges and RPMs.
---
It is NOT a priority now to add guns into the game.
---
You asked me what I think about 3 seasons having recycled guns, and I told you why.
---
Its really good! Lightning bilts are always an ass to draw but you really nailed it
---
*Sweats in KingLio*
---
It's honestly sad when people just just keep using ad hominem because they're too stubborn to admit that they're wrong.
---
Does this make you proud? That you refused to cede defeat in an internet argument with a stranger?
---
Ah yes beacuse if you have a ela on your team with the shotgun you win the round right or that you didn’t bring an op to counter her right sounds very op for lower ranks but in higher ranks her shotgun is useless and never used
---
So ur gonna tell me elas  smg when it was first released it was a reskin to which weapon
---
I only use headphones when im trying, which is almost never
---
I started playing Siege back in Skull Rain, back when Capitao's Para was AIDS to balance.
---
And what does your question have to do with the conversation? I already told you that guns years ago weren't an issue, but now they're redundant because so many have been added.
---
I don't know whether to feel ba dor be impressed
---
That and an outfit you could pick up for less than the cost of the elite in a charity shop or something.
---
weapon sway affect aim
---
sooooo the sas is a 3 speed?
---
Op probably knows this but it takes more time to take a screenshot and then try to use the Xbox app to upload it to reddit.
---
What’s the matter?
---
Can I get ur opinion on this so in the loadout screen have the weapons show the  damage they do to all of armor types
---
Good but C75 is the superior gun
---
Most untrue statement I’ve heard in a very long time, so you’re telling me Warden and Nokia were OP when they released?
---
Capitao elite update: he takes out a cigar and lights it, takes a few puffs then lifts his eye patch and puts it out in the empty socket. He replaces the patch, bums the cigar and winks. Fade to black.
---
fair enough.
---
Big yikes
---
Who's icon should I do next
---
Why'd you comment twice? I already told you Ela's SMG wasn't a reskin back years ago. But your statement of recycled guns in 2019 is invalid because enough guns have been added since Year 1,2 and 3 to cover all ranges of stats.
---
How many more times do I have to explain that?
---
"I got bored" I'd call that, I took a week off
---
Correct. Muscle memory is everything. Don't switch to something you're not comfortable with.
---
Muh immersion
---
My computer fuck s up time to do I didn't see ur reply
---
How is this possible
---
Cool next time I play I will look for it
---
Tbh I don't really know but I would say something with 
---
a lot of versatility like a balanced AR (decent in every stats)
---
or a rapid fire SMG for those that excel at luck rather than precision
---
Maybe call it Meat Ball Laser Boi
---
Give him a Thompson in the animation
---
Pretty sure its in a display cabinet
---
Rush spawn, die, leave game. Repeat. - casual players
---
Big Boi Italian LASER MEATBALL
---
I've never understood the argument that because a queue for the existing game mode gets longer, that somehow that constitutes a valid reason to not implement a new game mode. If so many people would leave to play a different mode, game, or specific queue, that probably means the current one isn't what people want to play.
---
Forcing people to play an awful game mode because it's what you want to play is a terrible argument.
---
Level 35 Mafia Boss Maestro
---
Most of the time 1 is all you need. Its Way better than none. 
---
Also what good will the operator do when your teammates are not dead? Entry fragging? Cause that means you need a good fragging operator that can also pick up items which will be OP as fuck.
---
Or a operator thats useless until someone dies.
---
That would be amazing!!
---
That turns me on
---
I would love to see this
---
I can see them doing this when crossplay is released. Though I imagine the queues will be separated by input it will boost all the player counts so queue times will be much less of an issue. 
---
Totally agree, solo players should never queue with more than a 3 stack but ideally other solos and duos. Playing solo is a totally different experience, it's totally not representative of your skill and performance.
---
Yeah, at least the solo can do their own thing and generally rely on the 4 stack knowing what's going on and leading the round
---
Which server?
---
So like, The Most Interesting Man in the World? I could dig it.
---
1. Probably 
---
2. For balance purposes
---
This is console footage so they do not have BosgAcog yet.
---
Yeah
---
&gt;Goyo shields can be placed just outside the reinforcement destruction zone
---
This HEAVILY restricts the freedom of shield placement.
---
That being said, yes, it's pretty frikking bad that scumbags exploit this. Your best bet, for now, is to be aware of a shield placement before reinforcing.
---
Because they won't be touching goyo for a while now, on account of his low pick and win Delta.
---
Yeah, like Fabian says, it's soo much better if solos at least have the option if they want to have a longer queue and not be put in with a 4 stack. That way at quieter times they can still get games
---
I have only played warden because I wanted to wear a suit, not because he is useful or fun.
---
Or Giorino Giovana's outfit. Either way, still cool
---
I will never be this good. I love this so much, I could only wish I had your talent!
---
“DruGS”
---
If this isn't his elite we need to all get together and say no to it. It worked for getting acog on bosg so it'll hopefully work for an elite skin
---
Well let's put it on their radar that we want it. It's a change that would massively improve the health of the game epsecially for solo players which is a good portion
---
This... i like this
---
Might wanna check the original post of this as well
---
Fuck it. P229 Acog
---
Upvoted the video as the video cut out and thought I broke my reddit app. 😰
---
To add to this,
---
2- balancing.
---
Ignore the blindness for a second, and see the complete lack of coordination.  That team, if they aren't a bunch of solo Q's, needs serious work.
---
have you thought about changing your name?
---
VG should know this but the playerbase at a Diamond level is already really thin. If you are attempting to soloQ at Diamond prepare to wait half an hour or more before finding a game. This sadly can't work in R6S, there just isn't a large enough playerbase at a high elo unless you want even higher wait times than it already it.
---
Rule of thumb: you are usually ok to do anything you want ten seconds into the round and not worry about a rush.
---
F
---
Seeking you as a Kapkan main, wouldn’t an EDD Acog be better?
---
Yeah it was lol.
---
Again look for another game then, none of the guns are truly wacky and most of them are actual made guns so I don't get your problem.
---
Rainbow is about the opperator each opperator having his own load out is what makes the game diffrent from cod and so on

How about every operator gets a acog
---
Imagine 35 gu mines. Or even worse, 20 kapkan mines.

With a solo queue system, you can't really get boosted because it's what you get while exclusively solo queuing.

---
Higher than you want them to be
---
Mildly infuriating broom handle that i always think is a claymore
---
here is a bright idea, how about instead of leaving as soon as the round is over, you stay make aquaintance and add the people you just played, then gather around and create your oown stack ? that is how i made all the friends i have in uplay from siege
---
To be fair, there have been times I've initiated a vote to kick or a surrender just to let that last guy know I'm not trying to watch him (as an attacker) hold a random angle 80 meters away from OBJ for 90 seconds. 
---
It's more of a "make a play" message. I don't care if he doesn't clutch against 5 full health defenders but don't just sit outside in spawn or opposite end of building.
---
Imagine an army of Lord Tachanaka!!!!
---
I keep getting this damn skin for everyone lol
---
When you ran out of shots I thought you were toast
---
Got kicked for not going in fast enough after they died. Also got kicked for clutching when they didn't want to win. It's bizzare to me how those people enjoy the game.
---
I swear I watched a YouTube video with the same evil eye lighter a while ago lol

Nice thanks this girl I’m talking to has been wanting it for all of 5seconds aka a in lol
---
Just out of curiosity, what streamer do you enjoy?
---
But how is it confusing? I mean its a piss-poor way of getting renown but it aint really confusing, its t hunt, you have an autoclicker chamge settings to a certain map and def and if you survive for at least 39 seconds you get renown, so your autoclicker needs to press right ops and site to stay alive longest
---
I am going to have to agree with this, people who run our, run, and spawn peek are easy kills to vigilant people who check their windows when spawning in, put traps down and hold their angles, and cover the run out spots.  If you lose the fight, doing those things then opfor was just better (or maybe alittle lucky).  If you die to a rush or spawn peek, or runout then its on you.
---
i did, there was no definite answer, so i asked here
---
fuck yourself
---
I know that, but they leave before you can even get to them.
---
i’m sorry to inconvenience you so severely.
---
I’m happy to say me and my crew never kick, unless we’re kicking each other
---
It’s it’s like extra try hard fake stuff gotcha I’m a crappy console player so I can’t do that I have to work for it all

An unwinnable war.

Why did this get downvoted?

That's not what the original comment was referring to. He was referring to the end of the round killcam. Pull it together my dude

Quick google search answered it for me, and the start of winter should be your best guess since they change seasons with literal season change.

Bruh I’ve watched all 3 seasons so far hella hyped for this thanks for sharing
---
Even if it is an unpopular opinion, I have unsubbed from many subs just because they turned into people posting images of crotch goblins. Never seen a baby I thought was cute
---
A laser sits parallel to the bore axis to allow a shooter to see where his gun is pointed. This means bullets should *always* impact at the same point relative to the laser when firing at point blank range. (Assuming it's not a cheap airsoft knockoff like ours that shifts when you fire) While lasers are mainly used to help with point firing they can also be useful for shooting with night vision, a visor, or other gear that would prevent a proper cheek weld (Which now that I think of it is also point firing). They can also be used to mark targets for close air support or for general squad communication. Although we dont have air support and can mark things with magic yellow arrows in game.
---
However in R6 the laser wibbles and wobbles so our bullets land nowhere near the laser. Because it no longer provides a reference point for your aim its functionally useless.
---
and I thank thee for the upvote

Its the bandit buff, he gets an acog but cant headshot
---
Yes I really just want that extra second to save my ass. I'm actually really good at getting kills with pistols, even against the best primary weapons on defence so I think if Cav fails to kill me instantly, I'll be able to kill them.
---
I haven't had them wait that long. They initiate the vote kick with me left and then once I get the last kill the last ones to vote always kick. It's a shame but it's only ever in casual for me so I just boot another match

Wow nice drawing

Well, you could be right. I am not sure, but since Quarantine is going to be released in July-December, well.
---
You're what's wrong with the game.
---
Now, let’s collectively buff Ela’s Scorpion
---
This most likely isn’t tick rate, it’s ping and lag compensation
---
120hz servers would be awesome but I suspect extremely difficult to pull off in a complex game like siege
---
CS go is the only game to have 120hz servers, and it’s a much older and more simple game
---
NINE NINE!!!
---
Wow, how were you able to kill everyone without being able to see anything?
---
He tasting them valkyrie pussy
---
It's not tick rate. It's your ping. I play at a constant 9 ping and this never happens to me. I tried switching servers where I had significantly higher ping and this happens a lot.
---
This game tickrate has always felt awful to people who take the game seriously an understand tickrate know how bad siege can feel. i cant speak for the zofia whom killed me but i have 100/40 aussie net with a ping of 3 on speed tests an my ingame ping is ALWAYS 9, trust me it wasnt my internet
---
OP’s asking if the same should happen with attacking shields.

So what do you mean by "sweat"? If someone is 10x better than you, they're not going to have to try to beat you. Are you seriously upset that someone is better than you at a video game? If it bothers you so much, just leave - it's only casual.

I dont think its very practical but they do stop bullets regardless if they are holstered or not. If youre really lucky, you may hear them shooting your back first, giving you enough time to react to them.

I've got kids and a wife and when I get the rare luxury of playing siege once or twice a week I usually go SoloQ, because I don't have the time to wait for a 5-stack team to be put together. This season I Solo qued 100% of the time and was 4 points off Plat 2. While until that point I got mixed with different teams, suddenly I got qued up against 5-stacks for the next 5 games in a row while my team was still a mix of Soloquers and 2/3-stacks and I lost all of those 5 games in a row, setting me back to around 200 points off Plat 2 now.

Oh man... Main reason I quited Siege
---
Csgo has 64hz servers for Matchmaking, which covers the vast majority of players. 
---
You only see 128 tick servers on private servers and systems like Faceit, ESEA and CEVO.
---
At this case after Y5S1 gets released :
---
*Recruit picks up G36C and SMG-12 on defend
---
I’ve been getting these end screens as well on ps4
---
Maybe he's a james bond villain instead. Always gave me that aura if he was put into a evil position
---
Sometimes that ass whooping you get in solo rank isn't because of a 4-5 stack, but mostly due to simply sucking and the enemy team knowing that throughout the whole match. Right now, I'm a Plat 3 having an absolutely horrible experience in mid-gold tier. Sometimes you simply can't win if your team consists of worst players than the other team. Solo queuing in rank at the end of the day will always come down to luck and that crucial headshot; which sometimes comes down to literal dumb luck.

It’s funny cause it’s true
---
Hostage extract, currently Favela is best map. It's the same as renown grinding but it gives you like 1200-1500 exp every 1.5 minute or so, whilst casual gives 3000-3300 or so if you win for what, matches of atleast 10-15 minutes?
---
wait if you put the magnet one one side of the wall it can grab granates on the other side of the wall? does that mean that you can place the magnet on the ceiling it can catch grenates on the floor above??
---
How do you enjoy playing against an operator that’s silent. It’s like the crouch walking 3 speed meta but even worse
---
buff bandit by giving him better elite skin
---
i would buy mafia maestro so fast.
---
vietcong
---
i use the pistol for long range and it's not okay
---
They should have a LoL style accept to play when getting into a ranked game so people don’t leave as often.
---
This is definitely mozzie his work he joined up with NASA for the money
---
Left control
---
Alright I’ll take it down.
---
But come on. The Thermite skin is awesome.
---
Why always best to have a team. I once was able to knife 4 people in a row due to them not talking.
---
Congratulations
---
As bikini bodhi would say stooped ash main
---
Stolen idea
---
Super Kicker!
---
not bad but there will never be an entire year with male operators
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
I hate this. People who suck get killed and expect you to pick up for them or you get kicked.
---
I really love the smoke elite, cuz it picks up on his backstory!
---
Yeah nothing funnier than 4 idiots suiciding and then forcing the last one to do the same or threat him with kick.
---
When i was new to siege i got kicked while in a 1v5. I had killed 4/5 and had almost full hp. I’m now 2600 hours in and still pissed
---
I mean we can get info on future ops through the lore within the game, how do you think we found out what Amaru and Goyo's gadgets were. The lore can be used as a means to predict where the game is going with in terms of ops.
---
Players that die in the first 30 seconds of every round should receive a TK penalty, votekick suspended for their group throughout entire match and receive a -100 for rush penalty. This will solve most of the toxicity problems in the game. The first thought that a group would do is teamkill or votekick players that are smart and cautious that actually play the game as it was originally intended.
---
I have had it up to here with the large amount of stupid players calling me toxic trying to votekick me in the middle of a firefight. It is distracting and wastes my precious time invested denying me of my hard earned renown as if the server disconnects from Ubi and hackers weren't bad enough already.
---
What is a booter?
---
Even "better", when they wait till you reach a 1v1 and then kick you.
---
I honestly thought about this idea too when she first came out..
---
That was dirty
---
Oh good you’ve convinced OP! He no longer cares his idea was stolen! He read your post and immediately saw the error of his ways.
---
Aw, thx fam 💕 Had fun makin' it
---
Right shift mah dude
---
Its tuxbird
---
Wish my notes were counted the same XD
---
It's called "competitive quarantine" and it makes great sense in context of competitive Siege. Sometimes meta shifts a lot with new ops and such a drastic change should not find its place in competitive game. Lion is a great example for that.
---
3 months of waiting gives a lot of time to Ubisoft to balance new operators and it's great for teams to slowly start practice with them.
---
Recruit should not be insentivised cos he is not meant to be played other than for people  with no ops.
---

i personally have a clap on/off light wired up to my keyboard so if i need to sprint, i just clap twice

I only care about being in a rank where everyone knows how to play. So, silver and up is what's enjoyable for me.
---
Just watch your step.
---
Thanks!
---
Lol what a fag, wht do guys like that even bother?
---
So a pre-nerf blackbeard but even more overpowered ?
---
I like Apex, but I just can't stand teammates that go alone, get downed, and then leave immediately. Which happens too often.
---
sick of seeing Amaru on my home screen so this is good :p
---
That's called a bot. You run into those quite often.
---
Let’s hope he looks thicc
---
Ok absolutely not, kite seams either useless if the wire are too big or OP if they are too small.
---
The other one is a big no no, can breach 2 wall? That’s a hard breacher job so no.
---
Ahhh BOŻE
---
But can it jump?
---
But when someone asks a question that can be EASILY googled and I reply with Google exists, I get downvoted...
---
Nope. Found it elsewhere no idea if it’s been posted before
---
Or how about, crazy thought, stop trying to slap a band-aid on such a stupid, godawful idea like a fixed machine gun for a gadget. Throw it in the trash, start the entire operator again from scratch. Throw it all out; the stupid gadget, the stupid lore, the stupid helmet, everything.
---
lmao he didnt even know it until that sledge hammer dusted his skull
---
Add me I'm down to play any time. I_Am_A_Zookeeper
---
There is supposed to be a rework coming for s1y5 it’s been leaked and on top of that ubi have put right said they are looking at ways to improve the Lords current situation.
---
actually, his commando is a great gun but i feel like he has 25 bullets so you reload more and see the sick animation

Welcome to ranked. All I can say is try looking for lfg for xbox. I usually have a squad i play with. Smurfing or not. 
---
I've just accepted that smurfs are part of the game now even tho I think they shouldn't. There's no punishment and there's no draw back to smurfing. Especially since you can make damn near an unlimited amount of smurfs so long as you have a gold account set as home on that xbox. 
---
My biggest gripe is ddosers and stressers.
---
I lost a casual to a stresser...how fucking sad is your life you stress casual.
---
Yes
---
He's too thicc
---
please don't uncle thermite
---
My guy, playing recruit itself is a power move
---
It would make him better. But it would notreally touch his amazing meme.
---
Call it Typewriter. 
---
You know, like the Chicago Typewriter.
---
What was that? Nice shot btw 😂👍
---
It's a nice ideal but I'm not sure how practical this would be for regions like mine (ANZ) where the player pool is low and this may only increase queue times. Might work better once cross platform support is added.
---
That's his loading screen mugshot.
---
&gt;Ubisoft is working with Tencent again
---
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;they’re keeping the free world in mind

These are contradictory statements. You can't work with a major Chinese power base and support "the free world".
---
I was cluching and I got a vite kicked luckly the one person did not vote and I cluched seige is super toxic sometimes

Why the hell does that sound like it’s ready to be done
---
DBNO never left you with explicitly 20hp in all situations, it was calculated based on your armor, hp before going down, and damage you took to go down.
---
Which might explain the uptick, if there's more people going down with less health
---
Reposttttttt

This tutorial helped me a lot of time, hope it helps you: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PHj943_zug)

Yea fuck 4 stack premade's.
---
Wait so does vocaroo automatically (with options) change your voice to Kermit? That’s lit.
---
For real...
---
Again, very untrue as most operators are fairly balanced when they release only getting slight adjustments to them, the only exceptions were ela, Blackbeard and lion who were extremely broken upon releases
---
Yeah I played bc+bork rush before it was cool.
---
You don't understand. Soldiers NEVER one tap. they always 2 tap. First in the chest second in the head. 
---
Or at least that's what the NAVY Seals dudes said in the documentary I watched
---
Is it out or is this another leak?
---
r/lostredditors
---
Well there then
---
My secret but impossible theory is that due to the graphic and loading screen being water/oil rig based, we will be getting a map similarly themed for Christmas or possibly a event. Last year we all got one free Op we didn’t have, why not this year a new Map.

I'm thinking wine instead of scotch

i saw this in r/csgo...

if it’s a problem in more than one games it probably isn’t anything on ubisofts side but something with your isp. download an app called ping plotter and use it while you play your game and try to see if the problem is packet loss and where the problem is.  happened to me this summer and they had to come out and fix something down the street.
---
I wish all elite skin victory animations would use the gadget
---
try a doctor

i feel like they should just add player colors like in csgo comp so people can say green behind you instead of going YO PUSSYSLAYER420LMAO._ THERES SOMEONE BEHIND YOU

Hello CorpSixClanOnReddit, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dyleih/do_you_like_the_corp_6_clans_logo_if_you_want_to/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

It’s a lot like valks gun. Headshots are necessary, or surprise. Recoil isn’t bad, so just improving your reaction speed and aim is what’s super important.
---
wiat, you died and won the round
---
I can just imagine the fear in both of them as they look each other in the eyes as they stand in front of each other completely vulnerable. They just proceed to yeet and run.
---
Default controls
---
Honestly I play all 3 systems and don’t get me wrong BOTH Xbox and PS4 have hella kids I feel like in recent years PS4 has more kids. I think this is because  parents are starting to get there kids PS4s instead of Xbox’s now. But generally I don’t have to deal with it much anymore because I’ve mostly swapped to pc and there’s not much kids in higher ranked lobbies thankgod
---
AAAAAAAAAA
---
Bot?
---
Yep, attacking team wins a draw that happens like that.
---
Its even an underhand sidearm mix
---
Yeah that's not how it should work because the defuser wasn't down. That is perhaps one of the most overlooked bugs is sometimes the game doesn't follow the proper win conditions
---
Aw man, it takes skill.
---
I mean I've been going for more headshots recently w everyone bc I always play it safe, I'm a body shot bandit and I need to get out of that habit/comfort zone
---
Garden hose rank
---
Is it just me or does the red dot look thinner/ smaller than it normally does? Am I crazy?
---
A drone could drive straight into your nuts better watch out
---
i already checked my other games for packet loss. cs and r6 has no packet loss but the sudden lag spike throws me off.  only fps games does this to me
---
Always the same low effort Posts and Answers from People who know nothing about this Game.
---
Neckshots count as Headshots but without the Headshot multiplier.
---
My understanding is that anyone can sign into Uplay on PC and get it on in the test server if you care to test the waters while waiting for a sale.
---
Is it a bug? I've seen it happen now 3 times I think. I always assumed the attacking team wins a kill trade like that at the end because defenders are the team with the "advantage".
---
i’ve done this countless times, never gets old
---
No one cares

To be fair those knifes shoulda hit, id freak out too

I also like to mock the dead when they get overly vocal.

I agree, it's improperly modeled for a 20 round magazine instead of 30, so they should either correct it or drop the capacity to match the current model.
---
Zgadza się milordzie
---
He should be ashamed of himself.
---
Belive it or not, I've read your comment multiple times while writing original response. Your problem with that comment is that you starts with wrong assumptions. 
---
&gt;Whats the difference between a 5 stack and 5 solo players who are communicating and playing as a team?
---
The difference is that 5 solo players **do not communicate** 99% of the time. You can't assume 2 different groups of people doing exactly the same and ask for difference, while in reality the difference between these groups is that, they **do not** act in the same way at all.
---
&gt;Most solo queue players have zero interest in communicating  or working together which is why they get stomped by people in a stack who **are** doing those things. 
---
Yet for some reason you want these 2 different groups to play against each other instead of separating them in respective categories, allowing communicating people play with and against other communicating people and non communicating play with other non communicating. 
---
&gt;(...) making a solo queue playlist isnt going to change the fact that a team that communicates has a massive advantage over a team that doesnt.  
---
Yes, and it's not the point of solo queue playlist at all. Point is as above to not mix people who communicate with ones who don't, because as you've acknowledged, communicating has huge fucking impact on the gameplay. Can you tell us, which part of your own comment, you do not understand?
---
Happens to me when I play Buck

What do you play on???

Also *she

Nomad
---
I’m actually in agreement with this. Thanks for the explanation. I don’t see any positives coming out of this for the “free world” side of the community.
---
WOW ok thrills... Thrills ok.. ok thrills
---
Zofia or Nomad. They're very versatile (you'll get some use out of either one on every single objective on all maps). I saw someone recommend Jackal but he's getting a substantial nerf next season.
---
100/100

Animal abuse

It has been almost half a year sinds you posted this. Still not done?

I'm sorry man. I had to :)

I second this
---
now u are the big intellect 😎
---
Thanks bunches
---
Do it, pick ela
---
well come 🤡
---
While I do believe that to be the date, that isn't a confirmed date.
---
You can also put the third one up it's asshole!
---
Jackal go in order
---
I think the list is solid, but Vigil is waaaaay too low.
---
I'm biased towards Ela, but I don't think she's good a roaming, her strength comes from locking down rooms with her mines and ambushing. 
---
Vigil has a great gun, impact nades, while his gadget isn't amazing it's still useful. 
---
I'd put Vigil in B tier, he's not awful, but he's outclassed by someone like Jäger.
---
The moment that I saw vigil last I stop reading. 
---
Intel in key in siege, for attackers droning is the most powerful tool they have, having the ability to deny all intel from them it’s really powerful. Sure you could just shoot the drone but he already saw you. With vigil attackers don’t know where you are, they can’t pre fire and you have an edge on attackers. When vigil is used properly he’s way more menacing than any other roamer.
---
Is it one of the ones from thingiverse? If so are the tips on the syringe also 3d printed or are they real?
---
ITS BEEN NINE YEARS
---
Stabs you
---
Caveira came out over 3 years ago.

You’re talking about Kali, whose gun does not exclusively injures. It will still kill you if it hits you in the head.

Doesn’t matter it’s what is up and the only info u have unless ubi says otherwise

Sobe

December 2 when u do

Which is why people are asking, so they can get a confirmed date.

Bruh, I couldn't imagine playing Siege without quality headphones.

#ATTEMPT
---
And the Harambe in the classroom.
---
Ubi CEO confirmed that crossplay is coming
---
And 5 opfors remaining
---
Honestly, I never here if diamonds who solo and more, now we have to 5 stack to get diamond, and some games we face solo or duos even though we consistently 5 stack
---
Wouldn't mind testing that.
---
The eyes are valkery cams
---
Well my bad. But yeah I think it's just a quick sponsorship thing.
---
Ard you one of those people that insists on playing the meta every single round? You can't deny that having flashes and smokes is some pretty good anti defender utility. It covers your team and allows you or them to easily push enemies.
---
Is recruit the best op you can pick? No, otherwise pro league would have had more recruits. But he can still be useful and offers a fun playstyle
---
You must be joking...
---
True, unless you’re priest, then the M&amp;K players get styled on
---
You're almost two years late to the party man.
---
You can make friends being the solo one too
---
CIAO CIAO CIAO!!!
---
I love Ubi.
---
Nope. Look at it
---
She's probably a softball pitcher.
---
I posted another post with the actual VIDEO trailer and it gets removed smhhhhh
---
Well, now you know.
---
Good chat. Good.
---
so...the event is playing hostage with new skins for 5 days?
---
Can’t wait for Gridlock’a Shrek skin
---
My bad, not sure where I got that idea from.
---
I personally think that she should have  cavs smg (idk the name sorry) with a built in suppressor
---
Ok, as much as I like this, I have a much better one!  He's in a chef's outfit, with the big poofy hat.  For the animation, he is spinning a pizza, and he throws it up in the air.  It lands on an Evil Eye on the ground by his foot.  The camera zooms in and he does a loud Italian chuckle.  Italian pizza music in the background.  But I also like your idea!
---
Please include a link.
---
Then buy Ela I suppose.
---
Get good,
---
A bit unrelated, I have watched this movie but cannot remember the name. What is it?
---
Really I got sniped on birdie when I was at tellers window and he was at that tiny office thing. And I was at the far window.
---
No, the e11 is the Sterling s11
---
Maybe you could feed it some of that nitro cell of yours.
---
Nevermind, you will figure out why the post made by the MOD is the one that stays pinned.
---
Oh you’re cool...
---
Yeah I suppose so.
---
Bombers don’t exist anymore
---
did he headshot you?
---
This. They can at least prepare and let us know before hand they are aware. Take the release of operation velvet shell for example. It was a true disaster.
---
I think not, maybe ubi could work with a new weapon instead of just removing the silencer from the mp5SD, perhaps a mp9? Who knows
---
This is why i hate discord.
---
People Join and mute the game comm,so loners never hear their calls.
---
I dont do That and Tell them to mute me instead, would be nice If the game remembered the mute between rounds
---
The mp5 has the same stats as the mp5 and I doubt ubi will give nokk acog
---
I found that months ago
---
What about April's fool? It was hostage only but still an &gt;! event !&lt;
---
Dmg has the same stats tho
---
bruh we just got an event
---
Yay hostage mode so much fun!
---
God no
---
Exactly
---
Yeah but it had the element of april fools with the silly outfits and such. This is just...weird.
---
So this is basically just Habana and Vigil bundles with a custom hostage but it’s the same old Bank?
---
I use the 5.7 usg because I can't aim tbe the D-50
---
I NEED A MEDIC BAG
---
Can’t say I was expecting that. I do like red though.
---
They really need to tread carefully with this shit after the last time they tried something like this.
---
&gt;Ard you one of those people that insists on playing the meta every single round?
---
Ideally. But I always discuss the strat in the prep.
---
&gt; You can't deny that having flashes and smokes is some pretty good anti defender utility.
---
I can, and for valid reason, because A, smoke meta is gone, and B, I'd like to see which op you'll replace with a liability.
---
&gt; It covers your team and allows you or them to easily push enemies.
---
Doesn't cap have uncountable smokes and uncountable fires, and 3 flashes or a claymore? And a 308?
---
&gt;Is recruit the best op you can pick? No, otherwise pro league would have had more recruits.
---
They tried.
---
Accidental pick. Failed miserably
---
&gt;But he can still be useful and offers a fun playstyle
---
Useful? No.
---
Tell me which op and why you would replace them with recruit, and in what scenario.
---
You want fun? Sure, have fun. But make your your team is aware of it and is in agreement with it so they can bring in countermeasures to deal with a lack of an op and it's gadget. You wouldn't want to unknowingly destroy their game.
---
Just google - TGA AWARDS - and it'll come up in the browser
---
agreed
---
Sorry to bother you with something not related but I'm new to the sub and only recently started using reddit (although my account is over a year old I think) but how do you get multiple emojis? ( I'm on mobile)

Thank you mods for not deleting it and saying its a 'repost' even though the mods copied my post.

To be honest this seems lazier than the house halloween mode they did last year, at least they put halloween themed props and changed the skybox there 
---
This one sounds incredibly boring, I'm not even gonna bother with the skins since I don't like them that much but that's just me.
---
I do that to the samurai statue in the bedroom on skyscraper. Even in ranked, but that's only during prep phase
---
How did this happen to you tell ME
---
stretched res gang 👌
---
Is this from test server?
---
Why are people complaining about a 2nd free event during the same season.... this is cool
---
Leak from a guy on reddit
---
Just in case anybody is going to watch the show because of this. Watch the show with subtitles instead of voice overs. The English voice overs are so bad and they lose all the emotion that the original voice actors have. just watch it with subtitles. :)
---
Bump
---
I'm not pretending to give you a fake reason so I'll go with the real:
---
**Netflix:** *Ight Ubisoft, there is &lt;huge money amount&gt;, we want a sponsor in the biggest game you have.
---
**Ubisoft:** *Damn!*
---
Yes. It was bullshit luck or skill or the BOSG is badass
---
You play against bots on xbox
---
Hope it’s not. Pretty big nerf for dokkebi imo.
---
No problem! Hopefully an OP Redditer comes along and replies with the answer lol
---
Dafuk?
---
Same goes to lion tbh
---
I mean...that is exactly how it works.  It's almost like, idk, commons are called common because they're...common?
---
Lol yeah, that's what I figured. Netflix are sticking their money fingers in all the pies.
---
Mate, your post is only the promotional picture while the post made by the mod has the official ubi blog entry + information about it + a transcription for the people who can't view the website on the phone.
---
It's always like this every time there is a new event / patch notes, don't be so butthurt because you can't get the karma for posting a picture who probably another person put it before you when this stuff is always handled by the mods smh
---
Love this reference
---
Save for kali
---
Agreed. Tencent - and the PRC - will not yield in their attempts to change the game. The R6 team will be under unbelievable stress to make changes that benefit China.
---
**Cosplay Comment Reminder:**
---
Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it clean and on topic, please.
---
Yeah, hopefully lol
---
Cum
---
Hey, unrelated. How do you get multiple emojis in the flair. I'm a mobile user
---
I totally agree
---
Is this genuine ? Or a godly copypasta ?
---
Ok
---
So smoke meta is gone means smokes are not good utility anymore?
---
Cap has 2 smokes and fires, not that hard to count. 
---
He is kind of similar to cap, if you play him with that loadout, but then recruit can bring a shotgun, which can also be a breaching tool in a pinch.
---
You don't destroy a game by picking recruit.
---
Unless you play this game competitively, stop taking it so seriously
---
I have fun killing my friends, it’s hilarious we do it all the time still to this day, hell we pull up in a ranked and throw the game because of stupidity. But if you TK randoms, then you’re just toxic
---
‘Maverick main’
---
Honestly stopped maiming her recently thanks for the reminder to change my flair
---
Damn thats cool
---
I’m sure you have any kills with the bosg under your belt yet
---
This would be awesome, but I don't think Ubi will change anything about her Elite if it is about to be released. Half of Elite MVP animations are mediocre and boring. Doc's MVP is deafening everyone, Ash is while calling someone, and that's just two of wacky MVPs.
---
Ok countering her isn’t the problem I’m aware how to counter my issue is within she picks off one dude and your whole team is screwed. Someone like me who like to go in a lot dies and now the rest of my team is screwed. That’s my issue. My team shouldn’t have to suffer from me dying
---
How much is it
---
cough maverick main flair cough
---
😳
---
I was uh, listening to that nice music that was playing in the beginning, a classic indeed🍷
---
Because if it takes me 15 minutes to find a game with my dumbass friends, I'm not going to play Siege.
---
There's nothing wrong with higher queue times within a certain margin, but when you're splitting playlists and the other one is effectively DOA you might as well just restrict the initial one.
---
Time to dust off those fuze charges.

That's an epic ending to this story.

Idk why ppl complaining when this is very good for the game. Its 2nd event when they promised only 1. This just an advertisement, which means money... More money, longer lifespan for the game.
---
This.

The YouTuber GodlyNoob has addressed his issues with Cavs nerf many times on his videos. Spamming the spas at long range has been shown to be more reliable than trying to use the lusion. As the spas will do ~36 damage at a decent range and is more consistent with it's shots than the luison.
---
CAVEIRA: Nerf to Caveira’s Luison.
---
Given her current win delta, we feel Cav is a little strong and want to make her less frustrating to play against. This change seeks to put more focus on emphasizing her role as a stealth and precision operative
---
Damage decreased to 65 (from 99).
---
Adjustments to damage dropoff to align with other pistols for consistency.
---
Reduced magazine size to 12 (from 15).
---
Increased recoil to make chaining shots at long-range more challenging.
---
Increased hipfire spread to reduce viability of spamming non-ADS shots
---
Ite but if we talking maverick or nomad then who
---
Thanks for the explanation on this matter.
---
That's definitely fake.
---
Mav or nomad?
---
Take my broke man's gold 🏅
---
Gridlock or nomad?
---
Mav Jackal or Zofia
---
Oh it’s because it has an acog, it’s much easier to aim with an acog and helps with longer shots compared to the fmg
---
Thanks you
---
I would get the Twitch and IQ ones if we could.
---
League. Dota. Any blizz game. Warframe. Removing people that are a major pain in the ass for the community is really not a novel concept.

hehehe
---
Awesome drawing style, love it :)
---
Also, how do you get multiple emojis in flair?
---
That mask is meme material waiting to happen
---
Larach
---
Both are good but don’t serve the exact purpose. Nomad is your go to flank watcher while gridlock can be a flank watcher but she’s way more stronger when she helps the plant by blocking a whole room.
---
Not gonna lie, I didn’t know  there was a hatch there
---
As I said in a different thread. I doubt she’ll get the acog on the mp5 if she gets it, ubi has said they don’t want her to have an acog
---
Maverick for sure, Gridlock have good weapons and a gadget, but you need a really good teamplay, than you have Maverick, you just need to be careful with the holes your making or you kill your team with accidentally, and Maverick's gun is really good, like good af
---
# TO
---
So basically you’re saying that whenever you or anyone else dies the team shouldn’t get punished? That’s what I’m getting at. Lol. 
---
Only other thing that I can suggest is get at least a 3 stack and not die.
---
I keep the points thing on because how else am I supposed to know if somebody's in my frost mat? If I tossed a grenade randomly and it injured someone? If I jammed a gadget as mute?
---
"Hi, welcome to our new event.  You can spend 30$ on two skins.  Get fucked ^.^"
---
That's impossible, though? After the first, maybe second I don't remember, TK their whole squad should get a FF penalty that reflects anymore damage.
---
Got it a long time ago
---
I understood your post, I was just adding on that now the game makes hard to have fun TK’ing your own friends because you get the friendly fire ban after a kill sometimes even if you don’t accept it. So they’ve made it nearly impossible to have tk battles with my friends...
---
Goyo looks like me when I see food
---
It's not just English subs, pretty sure this is a universal problem. The original is always far better.
---
Yes thank you. You’re probably the first person so far to get what I’m saying
---
Gotta play ranked it still can be toxic but not nearly as much as casual or unranked
---
Is that a UMP with Mute?
---
Oh please no, anything but the downvotes noooooooo, team killing is jokes, game is dead anyway
---
Honestly would be nice to see the MVP linked to the body so we can use event headgear with them.
---
It’s a legendary skin. Any legendary skin is rare.
---
But it’s good skin, 10/10. I prefer Black Ice UMP-45 though, so if I ever get it, I’ll probably use it a few times then switch back.
---
That is exactly why I am only playing ranked from now on
---
No I tried to make his mp5

If you learn how to use Mav he can be extremely useful but can be difficult at first. His gun is insane so imo maverick
---
Yes I’d love that
---
I'd rather see him drop out of a tube at the top of the screen while riding a dinosaur.
---
Always restart after 2-3 minutes, after that you basically have no chance to find a game.
---
Unranked has the smaller player base out of the 3 modes so it’s normal it’s longer.
---
THAT’S MY BDAY! ye

No, no, they removed the thing that says 'beta' so its perfect now. No more changes necessary.

I got this but no black ice :(

Mp7 would be a perfect fit then, it doesn’t have acog and it would be miles above the fmg and can actually rival defender weapons

Am I the only one that doesn't really like normal Crucible but Momentum Control is *excellent*?

I’m down

Still a nice skin though, don’t get me wrong.

That feeling when major point of super short trailer are not even 1 but **2 new bundles** of cosmetics and not the new mode itself. How very cash money of you Ubi.
---
I’d be so fucking down for that.
---
No, it's very possible, albeit with current tech it's be too big to mount on a jeep, let alone a handgun.
---
Just because I said that it should be shorter than Pulse's 9 meter range doesn't mean that the sonar's range should be just a couple of meters. So the range could very well be around 5-7 meters and you would still get a lot of information. The idea is to limit the places where an enemy operator can hide, because in a game like Siege there are a lot of spots you normally need to check, but with this ability you can cross out a lot of those. You shouldn't be able to just rush through a big open area by using this ability, because the drones are there for a reason. This ability would mostly allow you push near objective or scout out roamers you know are nearby. And anyways, this was just a simple concept. Nothing more.

The algorithm is Microsoft's true skill matchmaking system, not the elo system that chess uses. The term elo is just kinda a holdover that got translated to other ranking alogorthms. The calculations are significantly more complex then the one's for chess matches. Good matchmaking systems calculate wins or loses, because once again at the end of the day in a competitive game WINNING IS ALL THAT MATTERS. If you play like a copper but always win against and are in plat, then you shouldn't be penalized becuase you are still winning. Trying to quantify player skill into weighted in game performance into an MMR algorithm will either be nonsensical or a abused. If kills are weighted everyone goes entry frag, if it is gadgets placement you have people removing and replacing them constantly, and any implementation of such a system will have clear biases towards certain operators depending on the weight.

smol gas grenade looks weirdly cute

i think same... but after all if i would not hit that shot i would died

Ok, but we’ve already had good events this year. Just take it for what it is, it’s just a collab with Netflix, the bundles look cool, Money Heist looks like a good show, and i doubt that we won’t see another event during Season 4.

LPT: a thing I learned ages ago that's really cool is set push to mute on discord as the same button as push to talk ingame.

That way when I make calls in game it mutes my discord, my friends don't hear everything double (but should still hear me through in-game comms) and I can shittalk the randoms to them without anybody outside my group being affected like normal.

Hahaha wtf!

Hey if you wanna play. LMK. The harrasment for being a girl is not worth using a mic, from my experience, so I usually jus type in chat or Ill already have 3 or 4 people in my squad playing too.  My boyfriend is insanely good, and although I love playing w him and his squad, I wanna branch out on my own.

tbf it is skill that he decided to peek when he heard the gadget. It was unfortunate for gridlock but she could have avoided it easily

Don't buy Clash if you dont want to Main her, she's really weak if you cant play her. Also not very good in solo queue

So your telling this happened in plat my sliver 5 games are sweater then this

dude I've put so many hours in.  It's the only game I've primarily played for 3 years.  I love it :)
---
Thanks, what about past that? Does it stay at a week?
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been trying to say reddit won’t let me post any of my YouTube clip directly from the site 🤷‍♂️
---
when do the offenses reset?  Because my friend has had a few and they've all been 30 minutes
---
Not from youtube from your computer or is that lost?
---
Toxic behaviour imo. Outside peeking needs a death timer.
---
They were probably doing Strat roulette and got the "follow the leader Strat"
---
I noticed this also.
---
I enjoy the games way more, instead of previous seasons. I think the MMR squad limit has helped, I'm no longer up against 3 silvers, 1 gold ( prob a smurf) and 1 plat2 with constant run outs and shield rushes
---
They could've just as easily not done something though
---
I'm guessing 50k for each bundle, since they are bundles, ofc.
---
But I did post that link in the chat feed and no I upload directly from my PS4 not computer
---
These are sweaty. But when you play like a bot for some reason you're unkillable.
---
I'm more of removing it all together, it doesn't have any place imo (most of the time it's always unfair matches)
---
Same with unranked (in this case it should use ranked one imo)
---
Warden Buff?
---
Top 10 bruh moments
---
yeah, same, it’s like the UMP, low rof but low recoil and super accurate, very strong if you can hit headshots. But it being a pea shooter in-game doesn’t really makes sense since it uses .223 remington, (I believe) way stronger than any other 9mm or .45acp smg in siege
---
I can relate because I see her often getting banned and people telling me that she's overpowered. They dont know how to 1v1 her, usually dont know how to counter her turtle move and dont want to take the risk to meet a good Clash Main. Also, often people her because she's annoying like Jackal and they dont know what to ban instead of her. Pick &amp; Ban is really comfort related and not really strategically bans are being made.
---
December 2, but the operators themselves come out a week later i think (december 9)
---
Does unranked not use the ranked mmr? I thought its the exact same thing as ranked with same mmr but winning or losing just won't affect it

Just come out of a game where second round I was left defending clubhouse garage as Pulse... Slowly trying to move through the room 'cause they were up top.   
---
Peeking, gauging, waiting for them to make a mistake.
---
As I'm sure they're about to peek, I get the kick vote pop up 3/4 (In party playing with a friend, so obviously it'd not go through.).   
---
I look up thinking "What? I'm the only fucker with kills..." And they peek as I fucking look away and headshot me.
---
Thanks team.

\*Shrugs\* Ended the round 10-4 and their kills didn't even add up to mine.

Alright that makes sense

It’s so weird, this morning I was on 9 ping... 5 hours later I’m on 300? Never had this problem before and it was fine yesterday and this morning

Wow such an original idea bro

I don't get how people can complain about the siege team wanting money.  Like no shit Sherlock you cracked the code, games are made for money, but guess what that money = more content for a game you like playing.  Like honestly, give up the complaining and enjoy a cool heist themed event.

You will still need to buy them for real money unlike doctors curse packs.

so one time I was playing fuze and there was this sledge on my team that got downed, I thought he was in the objective and was expecting that although he would die my cluster charge would also down at least the person who killed him but it turned out that he was actually in a hallway just outside the objective room and my cluster charge only killed the sledge and I felt so bad about it.

---
M870 op... change my mind!

You can but thats after getting reviewed by a staff member. 
---
If you get reported a bunch and a staff checks your account and you have multiple major TK bans, they can hit you with a longer ban.
---
Outstanding move
---
I love you
---
Oh wow, thanks, im definitely gonna read it!
---
Valk can I guess
---
I’ve wanted this for a long time I’m not gonna lie
---
it has fixed a lot of the major issues in the game, It has been growing in player numbers, viewers for the proL, more teams by major orgs are joining, better events. 
---
but sure the games dying /s
---
It needs a suppressor first bro
---
Oh, so we basically have the same settings except for leaning
---
If it was an early match (likely as the cheater was probably on a new account) then that could be all from 1 match
---
what about a reverse lion? you have to move
---
Well considering it’s extremely likely you’ll win a game if you have a cheater on your team it’s fair, also the game only deducts the exact amount of mmr so that could have been 2 games.
---
Where's the glow stick chief?

Game sees you're queued alone, matches you with hacker, bans hacker, punishes you for actions of others, including the system that matched you with said hacker. You're right, that's logic alright. What do you do if matched with hackerman? Quit? What logical thing comes from this? The other team get my rating because the game paired me with a cheater?
---
It’s really worth it! I’ve been playing on Xbox since Operation Black Ice and hit level 281 before finally biting the bullet and buying a pc. Totally worth it though, people seem to care a lot more about winning and working together.
---
**Ⓧ** Doubt
---
What is the point to this?
---
High risk high reward. If you get a kill free 4v5 if you die 5v4. You need to know which maps it's easiest and safest to do it on. And you need to know when to back out. It's honestly fine by me. I've been spawn peeked a ton. And I've spawn peeked a lot of people in return.
