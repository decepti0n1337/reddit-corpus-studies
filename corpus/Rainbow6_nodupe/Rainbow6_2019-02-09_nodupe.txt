I think I’ll draw another one for ela, I don’t like this one much

That’s bad?? You seem happy?

The choice is obvious.

I don’t think he did lol
---
It's on a relatively high spot where it's kinda dark and it's also a small space. Go into a custom game and see how hard it is to see.
---
Id say wait for the reveal of the specifics of the new operators and if neither one really interests you that much, go ahead and buy maestro because he has a lot of utility and a solid LMG, not to mention an Acog.
---
Mom?
---
If your settings are set too high, and your internet isn’t great, it will send too many high quality packets with not enough internet. Try lowering your in game settings if you can

Wait until they revel the new ops then you can decide.

From what ive been told by many people, the kill cam is what the server side saw, so it will be slightly different from your client side. Not sure if true though.

Why would I? No point in lying if they post my chat logs I’m not going to be exposed I just feel like a perm was a big jump

You could have played it like a year ago in ranked or casual without smoke but now only the unsmoked version is in terrorist hunt if you are lucky. It is a 1/20 chance that it won't have gas.
---
Well tbh like I said in game brightness is relative to your tv as well so someone can still see you if they have default settings on rainbow but a little
---
Higher brightness on their tv so you probably won’t get a direct answer ya know

Probably hax

This is so satisfying

&gt;You're asking female players to jump through all these hoops just to enjoy a game.
---
I am asking all players. You are setting up some really pathetic strawmen here.
---
&gt;You can't be fucking serious with this.
---
I am.
---
&gt;This takes some serious moon logic just to justify letting toxic shitbags to continue being part of our community.
---
Another Strawman. I never justified anything. Such people will always be part of communities and there is no way of exterminating them. I just believe that all genres of insults are equal and the only difference is in the magnitude of the insult. To keep my point short, there are many ways to ignore or even fight this, therefore I dont think we should give these issues the amount of attention we are currently giving them.
---
Sexism and racism of any kind are bad, but everyone has enough ways to combat it. This is not an issue unique to female players.
---
Jackal
---
I conquered 
---
Appreciate the updates!
---
Knowing things are being worked on make a huge difference peace of mind wise.
---
I just want to say a thing about your first point, in a game like siege it is hard to balance it for everyone, if they balance it around normal users pros will be punished and there for the esports scene might suffer or maybe even die, the pros and streamers are the people who bring in the most of the playerbase and if those dissapear so will the playerbase, no playerbase= the game dies this means they have to think out a way make it work for everyone, which is why a game like CS is good as they cant Nerf a certain skill range in the same way.  But on the other hand if you balance it around pros the normal players get punished and they might stop playing the game which lowers the playerbase.   
---
im not good at english so these sentences might be incorrect spelled and other stuff but i tried my best  
---
Lol
---
My GPU isn't even OC. It started just after that stupid update they out out on Wednesday or whenever it was. Every time I hop into a game on attack it instantly crashes.

that sucks

Context matters, just saying the word doesn’t make you a racist
---
. 
---
You need to use it in a racist connotation, which means you would have to profess that a race is inferior, sincerely, that’s the keyword, if you’re making a joke, then you aren’t racist. 
---
The kind of logic is what gets people arrested for making jokes in Scotland about their dog being a wee Nazi.

Yes its casual and yes its console.

Still like it. Especially the ash-pain-sound is satisfiying caus normally you dont hear that too often.

Tachunk, not only is he the lord but ive gotten pretty good at spawnpeeking with the turret...
---
yeah i was really confused and then almost frustrated. playing as Ash on a map covered in smoke maybe wasn't the best choice. i got blown up by that bomber guy within the first minute of the game. i could hear it but couldn't see it, and spectating my teammates was just as harsh. we won thanks to my teammates who have obviously been playing longer than i have, but i was still very confused the whole game. thanks for answering!

We know they don’t get matched with them but it still could be a plat players friend who’s a copper. There’s no way for ubi to really know outside of MMR gained on that account, so in terms of rank, the teams are even

Agreed. I like playing Zofia and would love a good uniform for her. I missed out on the Year 2 pass uniform (which I really like) because I bought the game half way through year 3.

Happens from time to time.

I personally don't like it. Pick ban phase takes way to much time, and it just feels way to long for a match to end.

it's not letting me send u a color difference comparison, I don't think you can reply with pictures on reddit. lol

let me update the main post so that you can see what I mean, its definitely the new seasons pink coloration, don't know why it defaulted to the 4 stars as well.

The map desperately needs more rotations between the new buildings. One underground, another bridge, maybe make the bottom floor go all the way across or the top floor. So defenders can actually roam

If I abandon a game with a cheater in it, will that MMR reduction also be rolled back?  Or is the leaver penalty a separate thing?
---
Talking about how folks in every multiplayer game can be toxic.

Imagine if they started bringing back maps or even just map themes from older Rainbow Six games, updated to work with Siege's mechanics. That'd be so awesome

that was sad on everyend

---
Ohhh. I gotcha now. Yeah, it goes all the way down to Minecraft even lol
---
I mean. Not having it activated basically means you’re running windows for free. 
---
So it’s a trade off, but I think it’s fair. 
---
Ok, I have a few questions about this system that I believe have not been answered in this (I haven't read the entire thing well though).
---
1. How does the system work where if you are matched with a cheater, no matter the outcome of the game, your MMR is then capped at your current level? I was in copper 4 in Wind Bastion and through practice and improvement worked my way almost up to gold. If I was matched with a hacker when I was copper 3 does that mean no matter how much I improved my skill at the game and no matter how many games I won after this, I would never be able to go above copper 3 until the next season? This just seems a bit harsh for the people that get matched with cheaters unintentionally.
---
2. With the whole rollback system, basically, my understanding is that, if you are matched with a cheater, not only the people queued in a lobby with the cheater (getting boosted etc...) but every player in the lobby has an MMR punishment put on them where they lose a ton of MMR. This seems unfair for the people who want to play the game properly and get matched with cheaters out of bad luck. I just don't understand your reasoning for this. Wouldn't it be a better idea to place this punishment on the cheater and every person he has been queued with in the past rather than the normal players just trying to play the game?
---
3. You mention in the article on the R6 website "we will be moving forward with **resetting** the MMR from matches that player has participated in from that entire season." The use of the word resetting here confused me and I would love it if you could just explain what that means.
---
Just as a side note, I think this is an excellent idea and I 100% feel it will reduce and even eliminate boosting services and therefore the motivation to hack in this game. I am just in the dark here about how this system works.
---
Thanks Heaps :)
---
The kangaroo looks scared now it’s upside down.
---

---
Attack wise its really hard to say because I play three attackers regularly and thats is Thermite Hibiana and Dokkabai
---
My go to defender though hands down is Frost only elite skin Ill ever purchase (besides for the free Ash one and if Dokkaebi gets one)
---
Cav already gonna be banned every game anyways. 
---
I've seen plenty of women with faces like that, honestly. Don't know if she's a native 'strayn though, face looks more Russian than anything.
---
ok crouch spamming is bad. spawn peeking is counterable if you are good. and complaining about having to play good players is why you all are golds and not plat/diamond. and they cant do anything about the m&amp;k on console because they are using a xim that makes it detecable as a controller so they literally cant tell whos using it and who isn't. just play PC and then everyone is m&amp;k. 
---
Well I'm no SJW but damn the misogyny in this thread, Jesus. Applause to Ubisoft for not listening to those whiny neckbeard pricks.
---
Its Ma'am!! Holy shit Ubisoft actually added the gamestop tranny
---
Logan Paul is early 20s, brother
---
Its not?
---
Now for the question of course is that I eternally debate if I should get the game on PC too; because I'd lose all my cool unlocks and earned rewards (including all my Plat Charms, my unlocked skins like Black Ice, and my few Elite Uniforms etc.) just to play the game on nicer settings and have slightly less BS to deal with than on console.
---
(Though if Ubisoft offered a similar system to what SMITE/Warframe etc. did where you can have a one-time transfer of your stuff from one platform to another platform that would be amazing and I would definitely get it for PC then)
---
It may sound shitty, but remember that information is king in this game. Not only would you be preforming mute's job of blocking drones and denying intel, but you could also potentially have up to 10 Valkyrie-like cameras deployed throughout the map that can move and spot enemies at any time. Pretty strong if you ask me. (You will probably only be able to hack X amount of drones though so 10 is unlikely)
---

this dude must never have played halo 2 lol. its literally been around that long

10/10 man. Amazing
---
A flintlock pistol for opening up walls? Which defenders can’t open up walls already? Pretty much every defender has access to an explosive (impact/nitro) or a shotgun. Two with shotgun pistols. Not trying to be a dick but I see no use here.
---
Nomad had a different face in teaser art if you remember. I'm sure there's a better art model that will ship with her.

Looks like something from Farcry new dawn.

So this has been posted a 100 times.  In all of those posts I have gathered that it is possible to detect a XIM, per Microsoft's own statement on the matter.  However, it would cost the publisher money based on how the game would have to interact with the console software.  Also, when people cite fortnite they do so incorrectly.  Epic tried making their own detection system instead of using what Microsoft provided.  That is what I have gathered from the hundred posts I've seen on the matter. 
---
Why are you like this? Now I’ll never unsee this

You had bad ping and aim

Is it one time though?
---
I bought the Complete Edition when it was on sale and I'm glad I did. If you plan to spend a lot of time on R6 then go for it!
---
maybe the second option. making it slower in general wouldn't be good. some of the 3 armors already move like they are retired trigger pullers with arthritis on both knees. but a diminishing speed on use sounds like it could work.

Yes. You may have heard of his YouTube channel. He did that one video with the Japanese Suicide forest....
---
Mark this as the 30th post of this

I'd rather just keep on playing on Xbox though, simply because of all the time I already have on it and the unlocks - it's not like I'll suddenly be Diamond on PC instead of Plat (or Gold) either.

honestly doesn't bother me at all. most of the time people blame ping for them making dumb peeks or holding an angle not moving for like a whole minute and then getting popped in the face. this whole high ping abuse is dumb. slower internet does not give you an advantage
---
Well that's true. Do you prefer Xbox over PC and can your PC handle the game?

---
My PC can more than handle the game - I got the Starter Edition as a gift a while back and I can run it with the HD DLC on High and still get 100+ FPS constant, so that isn't an issue. I've mainly just been using it to play the TTS so I can try the new maps on Ops before they release so I have my fill of them before they come out to everyone else.
---
Bitch you stole this
---
I would really love Greece. I feel like the EKAM would be a great addition

You haven't played much IQ have you?
---
I’m reporting you to ubisoft

I demand a look rework in pre-launch.

I think I'm the only person who got the full outbreak set for zofia and I love it cause everyone comes to check me out 
---
No problem, happy to help.
---
Between this and mouse n keyboard it's out of hand and makes the game not fun anymore
---
Oooh I like it. Like before the ability you're just some big dumb oof that can tank. But after you use the ability you get smart and can hack things or something. Idk, it sounded good for a second lol.

I recommend finding a streamer on YouTube that you like, and watch that to improve your tactics. I personally prefer MacieJay. Good luck!
---
Right, I get that and can agree that people need to be handled for leaving matches. I know this is an inevitability and there isn’t much that can or even will be done about it. But it’s aggravating and I wish it could be handled.
---
Which solidifies my point, because hate speech is not censored in this space. If that's what you want, you should *really* move on.
---
well good luck man hope it works out for you. most high schoolers can get jobs at fast food joints you tried that? or retail stores. dude I mean you could mow lawns or shovel snow. I just paid a kid like 40 bucks to shovel my sidewalk.

You cant have all the 12yr olds that play the game visiting the website now...
---
It’s your opinion that she looks like a man, multiple other people feel that if Ubisoft set out to create a masculine woman, they most definitely have succeeded, so to them, the design is good. Another point I would bring up is that the context matters. A zucchini rifle in rainbow 6 would be terribly bad design, but I wouldn’t put it past fortnite to somehow make that work. Something that does work in rainbow 6, is the concept of masculine women, something they have done before if you look at Valkyrie. Whether they tipped the scales too far or not this time is entirely your opinion, but that doesn’t mean you get to objectively decide what is or isn’t good design

No. He would have to buy the y2 bundle and currently y3 solo. If he waits until y4,  y2&amp;3 operators may be bundled together.

No he won’t get Y1, Y2, Or Y3 operators from the Y4 pass. He will only get the operators that come out during Y4.

Yeah, against other coppers! Haha, if you use a suppressor you probably haven’t and will never be in high plat- diamond .. what a joke.

Applying for a cleaner role at Ubisoft doesn’t help with crouch spamming.

That’s some good PR spin on your game being unplayable solo.

I definitely won’t be in High Plat/Diamond haha, but I imagine you aren’t either. You’re probably stuck in Gold with the rest of us buddy 👍🏻

I installed it on my ssd and i finish loading instantly, but sometimes there are some people loading for like 5 sec. I assume those are the guys using hdds. Its nothing too bad at all if you have even the tiniest bit of patience, but keep in mind most casual players on your team do not

Nerf Nomad’s AR damage while you’re at it
---
So you were being accidentally abrasive and assuming that a masculine woman can't function properly in a military setting, just like a zucchini couldn't function properly as a rifle? Because that's the only context in which that comparison makes any sense at all.
---
Just because you can't clearly picture the genitals of an op doesn't mean they're designed poorly. There's 0 logic there.

Whether she's a woman or not has no bearing on her function as a character. They haven't confused your little pp yet about the gender of an op and we have over 40 of them, so to assume that your pp confusion is unintentional is a fucking stretch. You're reaching for things to bitch about.
---
Grow up.
---
IDK man.... Low-key dont know which one tour talking about but if I got to fix anything I would look for majority vote and if enough people wanted nomads damage reduced a tad bit then I'd let ubi operator ppl do what they think is best

restart the game

Good luck! I just transferred to a new school to get a degree in game development so maybe one day i can join the team as well

Lol shields are terrifying. I play at plat 1 and was diamond last season and let me tell you Montagne is a bigger force then anyone on attack. He either walks up to you extended melees you, or hipfire's you with his pistol. Or he is lean spamming make him very very hard to hit. He could also crouch and lean to the left, making him very hard to hit while he two taps you with a magnum. Seriously it's horrifying even without a Finka.

Hasnt worked so far :/

They’re working on a fix. It can’t come soon enough.

You're soooooo fucking triggered, it's literally an r/gamingcirclejerk bit. You said it's not good that she "looks like a dude," I said it's fine cause some women look like dudes. End of story. Now show me that filthy hog, big special boy.
---
How many games specifically have you consistently sat at the top of your total mmr? You are talking about a very small minority of people. Thinking about the alternative, where an entire lobby of people have messed up mmr from boosting, the one person who after that game had a massive winning streak, lifting themselves up many ranks, would probably be happy with the news that the hacker got banned, and no-one was dicked over. It’s one match, which late season usually averages about 30 mmr, not an entire season’s worth. And - regarding the current system of fuck all happening - a damn sight better than just wishing away the mmr.
---
In terms of reward vs punish, you are punished by losing mmr if you’re carried. The non-hacking team physically cannot be punished, as they don’t lose any more mmr. You just aren’t getting any back which, again considering it’s only one match out of the many afterwards you won, isn’t that much of a deal breaker. The winning team will be punished. They will have mmr taken. So boosting services can’t just churn through hundreds of accounts any more, as once one gets banned their entire progress is lost with their customers.

On ps4, it was a 5v2 on consulate, then my team all died and I was trying my best to pull a 1v2 and then I got kicked for trying to flank from a different angle

I’ve never failed to find a match on ps4, or xbox one, so I guess it’s up to whatever platform you’re most comfortable on
---
You arguing about nothing fam, sure, you may have tried so hard when looking t the picture to see a female, but couldn't, but a lot of other people can. Ubi wanted her to look like this, a very butch female, and I'd say it looks like that, so to me and obviously them, it's a good design. You don't have to think it's a good design, but I really don't think it's that big of an issue.
---
Nice to know. Thank you. =)
---
Hell yes.
---
I agree, back when she was leaked I really liked the look. Massively disappointed and not a fan at all of the dyed hair.

I always thought this game was a CPU hog due to the highly destructible environment. Constantly uses more than half of an 8-core Ryzen's resources when in-game.

Where does it say something about names? I had looked through the official website on 2 languages and only found out that attacker is female and defender is male.

Maybe if you’d scroll down you’d realize that’d a thousand other people have made a post about this.
---
They aren’t 
---
I’d disagree on her smg sucking, but I do agree she’s very situational.   I don’t think this makes her a bad operator though.   I’d say she’s one of the biggest meta chanting operators introduced, although her impact has certainly dropped some as people are used to the “usual spots” and how to deal with most of them.   
---
That being said, on a coordinated team, Mira has the ability to shut down certain corridors completely by herself.  A great example is (ironically) kitchen on coastline.  Placing windows on the walls facing the desk area bomb site (I don’t know the exact room name) can usually lock down that doorway completely and will require attackers to use a lot of utility to either block her view or shut Mira down.      
---
She doesn’t fit well in uncoordinated teams, but that’s not how Siege is intended to be played, so I don’t know what else to say there.
---
tldr: She’s super situational, but that doesn’t make her bad.  Her smg is great and her gadget can lock down hallways completely, requiring lots of utility to negate her.
---
It’s like a whole new world too. Game feel so much smoother and recoil is so much easier to control. Other than getting used to hotkeys I’ve pretty much got it. I’m usually not the best with aim when using a mouse but with this game it’s different
---
Seems like the prick who drinks Fosters "ironically" in Newtown, but actually likes them deep down.
---
I don't mind Jackal and even Dokkaebi that much because they can be dealt with. Add a blitz into the equation and it's just super annoying though. As long as the new attacker is fair and balanced it really is fine but I just don't get why this is what they're focusing on. Thanks for the support man.
---
No one

Calm down, smartass. Both maestro and maestro have colored berets, and it doesn't impact jack shit. I'm not talking neon, I mean a realistically colored beret.

Yeah, I fucking guarantee that it’s him they were going for.

If Ubisoft tested it and saw that it will cause performance issues, it’s their right not to add this function. They already made a statement on this.

You can do it legit if you sneak past Elijah. He doesn't activate the energy grid until he finds out he's trapped in the SM Vault. If you sneak right you can move behind him and he will activate the barriers after you've gotten through. Then use the Long Haul perk to fast travel to the  Lucky 38 or something and store all your loot.

What op has a war crime for there ability.

They dress up like every fcking unit over the entire world wow what a surprise. They made mav a afghan horse rider looks cool but the delta force is more than that so what's ur fcking point.

This game has only a few very realistic ops the rest has a few not fitting details.

No aim assist on console siege my guy.

Maverick is pretty useful but Kaid is my favourite OP so I would pick him. Kaid has a really good slug shotgun which you can put an acog on, and his secondary also has an acog. Plus his gadget electrifies hatches and walls so it's pretty useful on certain sites.
---
Echo because its bomb, plus his stun effect probably needs a nerf.
---
The description for Y4S1 also says he "is a quick-witted Defender who’s in it for the guts and glory.". Quick witted combined with the fact he's not in it for serious business, the "finger gun;" sounds like a reasonable guess.
---
Don't even bother, there's no helping gamers that haven't seen women outside of covers on magazines and in porn.

No not all 5 need to pick the same op its the operator that gets the most votes. (If its even it gets picked randomly between the operators with the highest amount of votes) If only 1 player votes his pick will be the operator ban.

Thank!

I don't believe this is true.

Now this is one ive never seen, shout out to ubi for constantly surprising us with these easter eggs.

Pengu only wants to get rid of the RNG of the game. Removing one hit headshot is one way of doing that, that's all he was saying really...

Pengu is one of the most reliable people when it comes to balancing the game in reality. 
---
I don't even know how to explain it.

Yes

True, that's some damn inconsistency.

Mental image of Nomad discovering Maverick half-buried in the sand
---
They've said they're going to look at the binary nature of her welcome mats in the future (as in they either trap someone, or they do f all), but the only thing I think her gun needs is a few more customisation options for grips and sights.
---
We have to look at it from a much bigger perspective then 3 games.
---
Let's take 10 for example, with the following pattern :
---
Win win loss win win loss win win loss win
---
With these, the players rank would stay relatively the same even though they only lost to cheaters. That means they are winning these matches at Gold. Once the MMR is rolled back, they would potentially be pushed into the Diamond MMR range, even though they only won Gold matches to get there.
---
nice that you play with almost only the broken ops
---
Damn! Thanks for the very kind words my dude! Feel free to check some of my other montages!
---
Any source on that?
---
Download english localization files. You will do it after almost if not every patch. Shouldn’t tried to save 2$ 
---
- the free packs
---
And if you don't want ops being banned they can still be better than ranked and casual:
---
-it can be played as casual but you can chose where you spawn 
---
-it can be played as seriously as rank but their is no stress and losing has no effect on your rank. 
---
I agree with Pengu on a lot of issues but that was simply foolish and a case of idle hands are an idiots play thing.  If you want to remove RNG then fix gameplay aspects.  Such as there being no collateral damage.  Getting into a gun fight, shooting someone clearly in the head, but getting a hand shot because the character model is doing something bizarre, that is RNG.

How is it bad?

2. Why does she look like a man transitioning?
---
Probably the best R6 post I've ever seen on reddit. Gj man 👏🏼
---
Honestly she looks like a mtf trans person. Which would be a cool inclusive move by Ubisoft in my opinion. Did we ever get to play as a trans charcter in a AAA game? 
---
Bro why... I mean I get it it's easier to get kills but I disapprove
---

Not long before this is flagged too.

You're not alone. I was concerned they'd bungle it up and now im well worried. Theres alot more too australia than madmax and the desert, but they are probably seen as our most iconic aspects to the rest of the world.

Gridlock looks silly but awesome at the same time. Motorcycle helmet is kinda badass but would be weird in a legit tactical setting.

So what about the controller players playing with a k&amp;m on their team? Someone's still going to have an advantage.
---
They don’t play against m&amp;k
---
Yeah but for a video game you think they'd reference either SASR, 2 Commando or TAG East/West...not SERT...
---
No one cares tbh old news just play recruit no one cares either pick a OP or face the consequences it’s basically cas not game changing or effects you negatively 
---
👌 No more words for you man, cheers
---
Can you provide a source for that particular reason? Cause the most they've officially said as far as I'm aware was that he's way too strong.
---
Maybe Nomad will be stronger than Lion, I doubt he will be as bad as Lion was given that I've only heard G2 complaining about Nomad. I haven't heard anyone else really complaining about it.
---
One of my favourite maps completely deleted from the game. Why it was removed and not just replaced in ranked but left in casual is beyond me. Nice clip tho lol
---
They have to do it now because of the six invitational who starts on the 11th feb 
---
You must not be hanging out with the right boys. Or not staring at their ass like I am, I guess.
---
No one in this thread is having problems with whether she is attractive or not, the problem is that these characters look like they came straight out of mad max.
---
Now make em phuck
---
have transsexuals in Australian police?
---
I play on console BECAUSE I don't want to use M&amp;K, OR play against M&amp;K. So no, if you want it go play on PC. 
---
For a second I thought that was really smart
---
GONNA ROLL IN ON ME RISE UP LIGHTS (say it aloud)
---
Fair, fun, and balanced.
---
I’ve heard this is a tranny. I’m not trolling, im serious. Does anyone know for sure?
---
If you as a m&amp;k player partyd up with me a controller player (just an example) then searched for a game it's either going to put me in a lobby with k&amp;m witch won't be enjoyable and unfair for me. On the other hand you get put into a controller lobby and it's unfair for everyone else in that game. 
---
1. Ubisoft
---
2. Ubisoft

3. Ubisoft

But... I’ve played R6 on console for 2 years and now I want to play it with m&amp;k without buying a pc 🤨
---
uh what thread are you reading because 80% of the comments are about her “looking like a man” and straight up calling her a tranny? gridlock has funny comments about him looking like he’s from mad max but mozzie is all about how she’s unattractive and masculine apparently

He puts down a spiderweb (wide enough to cover the width of a stair) that can damage enemies and makes a lot of noise
---
Would be quite funny if his in-game lines were muffled
---
anyone else getting the feeling that Nomad might be into Maverik? Just that look shes giving him makes me think shes into him, I mean come on hes taking a picture of flora, Nomad did tons of field research which would likely mean she took pictures of and documented local flora and fauna

There better be a picture of Steve Irwin

Yeah this is shit. Mates and I are pretty unhappy they went with this generic, cartoon depiction of our country. I get they have to stylize the OPs so you can't identify them and/or else most of the operators would simply look like Blackbeard if we went for "realism" but fuck me what is this nonsense with the Mad Max shit. Who are they representing from AUS? Not SASR, Not SF, not TAG...just some generic Mad Max shit and some Aussie Rosie Rivetter rip off..
---
Okay.
---
So what?
---
Mods aren't gonna make a rule because something is annoying. I totally agree with you, it is fucking annoying, but it'll blow over. Just sit tight and wish for it to end soon
---
HAHAHAHA TOP!
---
Why? So what they have bad art? Lion had good art but everyone still wants him out of the game
---
It worked
---
Maybe because the algorithm... yup you got it. It's the algorithm
---
It was easily counterable and not even an issue tbh.
---
epic skins are better than legendaries in most cases for some reason.
---
OP out here flexing on everyone with double Black Ice
---
I'm already reporting every shitpost. This is so mean and stupid.

Jack up the fire rate on the smg is my suggestion but stats show she’s really balanced but I feel she’s underpowered and really lackluster in the words of Matimi0
---
GEO, although that's more purple.
---
Depending on the HDD speed, it can either be painfully slow, like 1-2 minutes slow, or it can be like 10-15 seconds.

TIME TO COME ON OUT SHEEP -- lion

I call heards of people in retail sheep, so lookimg for roamers or groups with lion is JUST AMAZING

1 speed 3 armor bandit
---
Hope this will fix the crash problem too, I've tried to reinstall both battle-eye and the game three times and still it doesn't even let me reach the main menu, crashing during the seasonal loading screen.
---
So, if it's planned to release the patch on Monday, I'll stop trying to delete and redownload Siege, and I'll play some of the old Rainbow Six games, because, why not?
---
"..." -mute
---
Bandit: dammnit rook stop stealing my uniform
---
Cosplay is cool. How you make this costume?
---
Dunno watch ya talking bout dude, with the latest update my FPS have gone sky high, try checking on YouTube for some  FPS boost tutorial. 
---
Off to fight some fucking emus?
---
the best edit I have ever seen man, well done!
---
If you're creating a character with a trait that has no purpose to the character other than to represent real world people with that trait, it's bad. Honestly any of the operators in siege could be trans they could all be trans and it wouldn't make a difference. I'd rather it never got brought up in the first place so I never have to see the transphobic comments in the community I generally like. 
---
More than anything this character just has masculine features for a woman. Could be cis could be trans, don't really care it's a first person shooter.
---
This uniform makes ZOFIA so hooot dude 😍😍😍
---
If someone has the execution for good movement they should use it :s

The use of macros for this is the real issue.

A ton of money only bundles were taken out a bit ago. This was one of them.

Let’s be real though, an upside down/capsized cruise ship map would be incredibly cool looking
---
Because people think he’s oppressive and unfun, but even I can admit he’s not OP
---
Thank you so much! The finka one does not seem to be here, is there any chance you could link me that? 
---
Mute is sort of a counter to a ton of ops. He can block phone calls and is immune to lion scan,  but you have to be within a tiny radius. He can stop Blitz's shield, but thats barely ever going to happen, plus Blitz is still strong without the flashes.
---
On her screen she knocked your shield back. On your screen you extended your shield so nothing happened when she meleed
---
You can only blame your own ping here. Either you need to get a better connection or play on your own servers.
---
I can’t tell which one is the GF bro 😂
---
I mean recently we've mainly been getting 1 speed, 3 armor anchors and I feel like ubi don't plan on stopping that soon, But if she can take control of drones I can see that being the reason for her being slow.
---
So stunning and brave!!!
---
Misleading title? Fuck off lmao
---
Tranny it is!

Happens all the time when you plant on the border of obj. See it happen to many time and wonder why people still do it
---
its not up to ubisoft. it’s up to Microsoft. 
---
Bad day?
---
That's awesome, good job
---
I have actually had this happen to me before, I was rappelling upside down and when I got the ground my character just never flipped over, so I was stuck walking around like the guy in the video till I died. Actually sucked cause it was ranked lol 
---
Misleading title? I just see a good Australian map?
---
Nah he’s successful so he’s an Aussie
---
Yeah I came to the comments to say I just saw that clip in his new glitches and bugs video.
---
Maybe females don’t belong in combat roles in general and people are tired of sjw nonsense? 
---
Nah, can’t be. It is everyone else that is wrong!
---
I think it may have been NarcolepticNugget’s clip, but I also could be as wrong as the gravity in that video.
---
O shit, smells like AnthonyPit replacement in here.
---
Think I'm gonna sub you.
---
No official news, but leaks suggest a defense op that can hack drones somehow, and an attacking op that can set some kind of net trap to mess with roamers, possibly hurt them and making noise. But that’s a “leak”, so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Yah true
---
When his shield isn't completely broken yeah he's probably stronger than other ops but rn he's really unreliable
---
Oh I saw the replies and the post itself, I'm talking about the replies to THIS post.
---
I’d just as soon opt female characters out of every combat game I’ve enjoyed and I’d probably like it way better. I understand it’s a fantasy game but if we can’t have *some* semblance of realism we might as well play as unicorns shooting gumdrops at each other.
---
The game is borderline unplayable without your own five stack. If you have to rely on even one person you get bit in the ass
---
If u shoot enough bullets the enemy will get confused and get himself killed

They are gonna add it in March lol

I never understood why people get mad when other people play the game the way they want to. People trying really hard in casual? Good for them. You want to fuck around and not try? Good for you. Play your game your way and they'll play theirs.

OK, you win

Don't

It’s kinda basic, you shoulda seen the red crow skins.

No. They’re the same *weight*!

But Rook armor is heavier than Caveira.

There might be alternate season pass headgear like with Lion and Finka

Yes but if someone is around you, they aitomatically know where you are. Lion doesnt.

And guess what? The majority don't play it for a job. They play it for fun, or for a competitive mode. I've said this three times but since you can't fucking read, I ENJOY THE NEW MODE.
---
But for the longevity of the game, removing ranked as in and only having casual and pro league is going to kill it.
---
You can either play a toxic, no reason to win playlist or sit here for an hour and play only some operators. Goodbye new ops at the begining of every season, oh and the map pool is reduced as well!
---
It's a good game mode, it's very fun and tactical. It should be added, and using wait times as an excuse for a game with 45+ million players is fucking laughable. I've never waited more than 2 minutes for a game. Whine more. 
---
Watch, next season the new operator is going to have suction cup boots that allow him to walk up and around any surface
---
I'm seeing all these cowards deleting their comments so imma be honest about this nigga's cosplay
---
nice headphones
---
Outbreak was a testing ground for the new time-limited lootboxes. They got the info they needed, they stated that there won't be any coop PVE events anymore. 
---
There's literally no incentive for them to invest time, resources and efforts into something as big as OB since it will make as much money as simply releasing another batch of lootboxes like Summer Packs or Halloween ones. 
---
Come on you can't expect everybody to be polite online 
---
You're arguing with bigoted assholes, I don't think this is a fight that you're going to win any time soon.

Original Seige, only the original ops. The original ops have the stuff they had from day (Ex Smoke c4, jager acog, doc shield), only original maps (with no fixes). Pretty much day one Siege.

I’m not a noob thank you very much. Day 1 player. Just out of the loop as I don’t play often.

Your new aren’t you?

On console you don’t have to buy on pc you need to buy another copy

It's not reqlly about teammate awareness, it's about unfair wins. If you win a match where a teammate is cheating, chances are you won in part BECAUSE of that cheating (in other words, the cheater ruled out the other team's chances of winning), and so the points you received are "tainted".
---
3d.exe stopped working

You don't have to like the operator, that's fine.  You (general 'you', not you specifically) don't have to make a fuckton of transphobic "jokes" to make the point.  I think Mozzie looks great.  Strong-jawed women have done it for me since I saw Ripley waking up in Alien.  If it doesn't do it for you, that's fine.  That doesn't mean "make offensive jokes because I'm a fourteen year old kid who thinks that bigotry is ~edgy~"

This happened when i turned my dpi to the max i could set it on my mouse with tachanka turret, have no idea how it happened because i couldnt replicate it
---
You know what will also kill the game? Slow ass queue times which already a slight issue at higher ranks. Or people continuously running the same fucking meta strategies in to the ground over and over. They plan have 100 operators, just pick a different one. Stop crying because someone won’t let you hide behind a shield op all of a sudden. 
---
If you get your wish and they add this mode then it should be the only mode with a rank attached it to it
---
3 armour operators do have a big disadvantage roaming though. They are slower, almost always have slow ADS guns, much louder, less equipment for roaming and often gadgets based for anchoring that are just wasted if they roam.
---
we need the game to be fixed instead. XD
---
That looked like a trade
---
Don't play shields either buddy, but try the next one! You think you're better than me because I disagree they should completely delete a game mode that's been in since fucking launch. You're adorable.
---
And they don't run the same meta in pro league? It's fucking more predictable than ranked but okay! 
---
&gt;Fuze's default helmet is the SSSh-94 Sfera-C, a steel helmet used largely by Russian MVD and OMON forces during the Chechen Wars. Available as an alternate headgear piece is the Russian Maska-1 steel helmet with no visor.

not felin dis mane. white noise seasonal skins were much better imo
---
I know but you can’t say “great again” because it is the best it has ever been. If you compare the abuse of mechanics now to last year with quick peeking, dropshotting, shield glitching, then it’s already “great”

Dude I played against you once and thought this was brilliant!

It was just a lucky hipfire. Don’t peak shields, RNGesus might be on their side.

---
3 armor bandit.
---
I completely agree that Siege has gotten much better in many ways, but Ranked has never come out of beta and Casual simply is not a viable way to play Siege. And considering that they’re the only two modes available (Terrorist Hunt doesn’t count), making them the best quality game modes that they can be is an important priority.
---
Is it the same on PS4 too?
---
You must have seen the bundle only. Just pick a gun and go to skins and scroll down and you’ll be able to see and buy it for 30k(27k with season pass) renown.
---
No they shouldn't.
---
Siege is simply different from the previous games by having a huge emphasis on PvP. While it's true that ONLY Siege has a lot of environmental destruction mechanics (as far as i know), if we really wanted PvE we'd ask for another installment in the Rainbow 6 series.
---
I'd rather we just make Outbreak permanent, improve T-Hunt a little bit, then leave it at that.
---
Where’s the claymore¿

We got a live one

It’s already a guaranteed kill on Light Armor till 15 meters, wdym?

---
Dramatic? I play the game since launch. R6 lately takes a lot to acknowledge an issue, and more than an entire season to fix it. Seriously, why the hell would you put 2 original operators in the fridge during 3 years before reworking them? That's a douchebag move. I'm not being dramatic. I'm being realistic. When an amazing, polished game where you can shoot and kill people gets released and caught so much attention, even though it's another genre, a big portion of the playerbase could migrate for a considerable period of time. I understand that for you those might be "normies" because you must be a pro player level 400 diamond every season, but that doesn't mean that "normies" leaving isn't something to worry about. Numbers bring attention, attention brings money, money brings Siege for more years. I dont understand why someone would comment something negative in a thread that is basically requesting good stuff for everyone, even you.
---
If they do, don't add in any more ridiculous abilities like teleportation.
---
Holy fuck Siege on the PC is broken to this day because of the teleporting they added in Outbreak. Hackers just go 'yoink' I'll take that and can now do it freely.

Like how you snuck in release an elite skin for Hibana. Someone's a Hibana main it seems. But yah, the game is doing fine. And most of your wishlisting is part of their plans anyway. They will release 8 new operators this year, same as every year. They do plan on fixing castle and tchanka and have been working on a way to make them viable for awhile.
---
Huh what makes you think im smurfing that was my main account and im usually plat 3 i just lost some games and ended up in gold one

It’s not about their gadget it’s the problem with the macros spam crouching. I stopped playing ranked on siege cause my last 4 placements had annoying spam crouchers. https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/anuvrq/pls_ubi_i_cant_stand_this_i_am_taking_a_break/?st=JRTSFNVM&amp;sh=5eee96c1

I really can’t understand those who say Outbreak was bad for the game bla bla bla, it was so much fun while it lasted, and I definitely would like to have it as a timed even that is available in like one week for a couple of months.

Why does everyone think Mozzie is the guy? In the teaser it said the defender is quick witted and in it for the glory, while the attacker is stoic. Judging by the guy's pose, he definitely doesn't seem stoic, which would mean he's the defender, which means he has the drone hacking device, which makes sense with the name Gridlock.

Yes.  I'm fucking terrible lol.  I doubt that was actually me in that particular game but I can definitely recall setting a few breach charges on those haha

Completely different genres. Stop being so dramatic.

People aren't going to dump the SWAT simulator for a battle royale just like they didn't for PUBG or Fortnite.
---
Now if someone released another breach 'n' clear but with less bugs and better servers, sure I would be with you.
---
For clarification, I was talking about your 2nd point. The one that was about the game being centered on CTU vs Terrorists.
---
The last part about the Australian operators I totally agree with you though.
---
Sorry for confusion!
---
I didn't say they can't coexist
---
No.
---
NO!
---
Because I don't have a PC and I would be jealous if others could play it 🤔

I mean, setting breaching charges on those isn't bad BUT setting one of those on that IS bad lmao
---
op you need to lose weight being that size cannot b healthy
---
Oh dear God, I've only proved how terrible I actually am at this game by calling whatever that thing is on the door for a breach charges

Leak 2 months ago says Gridlock he's the attacker and Mozzie she's the defender.

I don’t know, I mean I like playing her but I always get the same thing and it always confuses me.

Her primaries are garbage and the “wallhack” requires her to make herself vulnerable to interrogate. If it was broken you’d see it used more in pro league or in higher ranks but it’s not because of the fact she needs to get someone who’s alone.
---
If they did do something like outbreak, it would bring me back to the game. 
---
This thread is an example of why I can't get on Reddit after a blunt.  God damn it
---
Explain you missing your shots?
---
No it’s affecting tons of PC players. 
---
By removing potential operators and gadgets that could be used in a match
---
It's not the same though. Watch an xbox play and a pc player then reply 
---
Nah bro I've seen people with crazy aim, you just got pwnd don't be mad my dude
---
Watch every kill cam, use your ears more than your eyes, map knowledge is probably the most important aspect of the game
---
They already said there will never be anything like Outbreak so this is pointless.  
---
And yes, of course I‘d love something like outbreak again, maybe with adjusted reward.
---
Garbage performance and repetitive as hell after a few runs. It is however extremely fun with friends and I'm kinda perplexed why they removed it for the amount of work they put in, makes no sense.
---
I never thought of it that way, this is so true
---
Alright thank you I started getting worried 
---
spider web op 
---
I feel they should bring outbreak back just for people to be able to play because I actually liked it
---
Or by forcing teams to use a different strat than the exact same meta strat every team uses every game?

Just get over it man.

Very true, don't even need an elite controller you could get some scuffs controllers with the paddle battery packs. Also claw grip....there are many ways to crouch spam and aim at the same time don't be closed minded
---
Fair point but I don’t see identical strats every round 
---
Adds character lol
---
But you technically aren't voting so it shouldn't go towards an operator.
---
YES.
---
Yes, I mean, it was fun.
---
No just no.
---
First of all, you started paying before you even got all of the free packs? Nice one.  
---
Secondly: This system is extremely transparent in what it does. Anyone going into it with real money and not expecting to pay the full price (for all packs) to get what you want, you better start thinking about how to spend your money.

No it got boring after the first few days and I only played it for the charms, all it did was force operators that weren’t made for multiplayer into multiplayer 
---
If it has that many players why can I never find a match in under two minutes? Like for god sake Battlefield V a game which will never sell as well as Siege can get me in one in three damn seconds. And hell War Thunder is a lot less popular and yet that gets me in a match a lot quicker too even if some nations take hours... That's an exaggeration by the way.

Hello RA3DKILL3R, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aowpr6/what_does_rook_say_before_dinner/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I never got to try it, so I'm down for anything.
---
I meant in terms of recoil. Yes it has high DBS but that doesn’t matter if you can’t string three shots within a metre of each other. 
---
They don’t ban for it 
---
I know but idk if anyone outside of Australia rlly knows what they are
---
Definitely 
---
I’ve just made a post about exactly this! 
---
First I thought the map was Tower LUL
---
Ja
---
Lore, make a story. Limited time op.
---
Does this come from someone who doesn’t have plasma pink? I have it and I hate it
---
Hell yes, I loved it.  Maybe not necessarily aliens/zombies whatever fantastical scifi thing, but even just a special type of event for counter-terrosism would be badass! I'd love to have them go somewhere and actually operate like how Rainbow works in the novel
---
You hit the arm , the blood appears later because the game has to wait for the server to acknowledge the hit onto the enemy player.
---
Cool, but what's The odds you could do this in a "real" game? 
---
I would have easily paid 20 bucks for an outbreak dlc. I think its ridiculous that they got rid of it and refuse to bring it back. 
---
They put all the effort into that and used it for only like a month. Let’s hope they bring it back.
---
It was fun, but it wasn't enough content imo. People were finished with it within a few hours on the test server, and then nothing changed on live servers
---
also its mode where Tachankin is actually Lord
---
Jesus that’s scary as hell. Hacker?
---
She is just awesome isn’t she. 😍
---
Maybe not every round but there are a lot of sites that are more or less played the same way every time. You ban operators based on that it forces teams to have to adapt and come up with new strats. Pick and ban really doesn't show its strengths when its just the same Lion/Blitz/Cav/Echo bans every game, which is what a lot of the SI matches have been the past few weeks tbf.
---
Well they never got their own Operation Name. We never got to find out what the Polish operation would of been.
---
I thought the same thing. Honestly, you would have to get lucky. Though, it would make a great clip if you managed to do it. I'll definitely be trying in ranked, just for the meme value. 
---
I wish we could get uptaded version of outbreak like more missions. Also im sad that we didnt get any ending cutscenes.... 
---
I hope that what Matimio said is true.
---
He hopes that they're delaying the roadmap to reveal another coop event similar to outbreak. That would be pretty cool c:
---
Outbreak was amazing please bring it back more fleshed out
---
Icons.
---
I think...
---
Well fuck.   Gotta love crouch spam cancer.
---
If he is actually using M&amp;K unfortunately you can't do anything Microsoft officially supports M&amp;K now, Ubi can't do anything either cause Microsoft controls the compatibility options for their products. You can either join them or get a PC where at least it's even playing grounds. I consider it to be fucked up personally but best of luck dude and I agree with you the play styles are very different and very noticeable.
---
Downvote this, I got black ice for jager on my first alpha pack
---
Honestly I enjoyed outbreak fully,sure the lackluster what 200-300 renown reward was discouraging and it got repetitive over time. But you know what else gets repetitive? Playing terrorist hunt day after day to warm up my aim.
---
 I liked that they tried something different, it spiced up the game in my eyes! But what I enjoyed most of all, the characters and the interactions. I enjoy t-hunt for this very reason too. The operators actually talk to each other and have a personality!
---
When I play terrorist hunt I always look forward to the unused voice lines that just are forgotten. My favourite is one of bandit's, "Today, we are a team. Tomorrow? Who knows." It really shows a personality other than the one the community has created over playing multiplayer! Which is just d r u g s.
---
Dokkeabi has upward of 7 minutes of lines just for terrorist hunt. Maestro has around 3. Its insane how much they let go to waste! They could use these already existing lines to make a really immersive story! Don't believe me? You can take a listen for yourself by searching it on YouTube when you get the chance!
---
They've shown that they can do it! Whether it was the fact that another studio worked on outbreak or not, they can make a very promising story. The only reason this isnt going to happen is because of pro league sadly. They're too focused on pros and the competitive scene to add any PvE I imagine, and for good reason too! I can't imagine how much money pro league makes.
---
If anyone reads this entire comment, did you enjoy outbreak? If not, what would you change to make it enjoyable? I loved the stealth aspect and the flashlights! 
---
ah sorry didn’t realise you were an elite 
---
Based on the hex code, it's apparently "Brick Red", which makes sense, given that Australia has the "red desert".
---
In the video we were just seeing if it was possible. 
---
Yeah running is a problem too. I've hat blitzs sprent at me and I didn't hear shit
---
Buff would have definition, sure she doesn’t have elephant ears hanging off her but she’s heavy set lol
---
I guess so, still a cool color nonetheless
---
Gun sounds are fucked on XBox. Fuze charges aswell.
---
This is Epic! Great work brother! 
---
Your connection is shite mate
---
The valk looks good, the bandit helmet could be worked on a little more but otherwise it looks good
---
Why don't they let us play multiplayer matches on the hospital level from this? Would be a great map.
---
Any russians will do
---
Yeah, when I first tried to post my answer, I got an error message about the comment being deleted. So I refreshed and clicked your comment not noticing it wasn't the same one. Apologies, have a nice evening.
---
Oh I didn't mean the actual gameplay of article. It's just bomb... But dusty. And it should only be queued if you pick article 5 from situations imo, so I feel you there.
---
I just meant story wise. How it has the cinematic. Hell I'd take more situations. Give us 2 new ones for each new operator. 
---

They should make outbreak somthing you can play all year round either solo or with friends kinda like terrorist hunt
---
but your roamers will hear that shit from a mile away and be able to flank him.
---
ya
---
For what it's worth the 90's kid tv shows were amazing as well. Round the Twist, Ship to Shore, a few other ones that I forgot the name of. Those series spread throughout the whole world. 
---
Wait, when is this said? I've never heard it before.
---
Well, if there was a CTU of our country, based on what the real spec ops here use(d), it'd be either a SA vz.58 (not to be confused with SA58, a modernized FAL), CZ805 Bren, a Mk.48 Mod 0 or a modified FN Minimi. Or maybe something else, but this is all I know.
---
**A.)** Compromised the balance of operators due to development on the mode/maps (A.K.A Lion) 
---
**B.)** Boring because repetitive
---
**C.)** Time spent on limited mode/maps wasted when could have been spent developing better, more balanced and fun ops or maps
---
**Conclusion:**
---
Why didn't they just 'black ops zombie' mode it on an existing map like that's what we were all hoping for i think and so if they do a low *effort* (but no so cheap and crappy like 'Halloween house' where all they did was take from  the theme parks map paintings and copy pasted on walls) *mode* and designed the ops TOTALLY separate, then id be happy with that
---
You always had to throw 2 impacts to break walls wdym. /s
---
Also on PS4. It’s probably because console is more accessible for younger people than PC. There’s nothing to do about it though really, I would suggest the voting/reporting system to be tweaked but it seems to be too much work for ubisoft.
---
The old one lacked something. The operator card screen feels more complete.
---
Mostly teenagers unfortunately. Also there is no communication what so ever lol, no one speaks on mic, unless you party up. 
---
Doesn't New Zealand have similar equipment?
---
I thought the good thing of the p90 was the recoil? Litteraly you can aim where ever you want and after like 3 shots you'll get a headshot
---
I do but dont. Itd be cool when you got a 5 man but if you solo queue or dont havr a 5 man then the 6th pick is grounds for trolling in ranked.
---
*What in upside-down nation?*
---
I  LOVE THE SMELL OF PULSE AMMUNITION IN THE MORNING 
---
I'll be in bathroom stall number three, see you there sweetie.
---
Oswald Light with drop shadow is pretty close.
---
Cheers!
---
it's like the other plain color skins, but with the best color. I don't see what's wrong with that.
---
Restart
---
You can use the eyedropper tool on any of the past season icons and get the hexidecimal value.
---
I mean the same can be said of a few DLC ops. Hibana with the Emo hood, Dokkaebi with the stereotypical nerdy look, Caveira looks like she's out of an horror story, Capitao would be considered disabled. And this doesn't include headgears where this becomes really problematic (bank robber clown masks and blindfolds). 
---
Great cosplay! Must be a big hitbox. Or is it rook armour?
---
Yes. I couldn't even try out the outbreak ;-;
---
I had the same problem. I had to reset all my bindings to default then go through and and put in my preferences again. Then it worked for me. 
---
Did you miss the part where I have first hand experience as both sides of the matter?
---
I've been gaming online for over a decade, and of those, only one year as a woman (not "a female", purge that dehumanizing shit from your vocab). I've had to deal with significantly more toxicity this year than *almost fifteen years*. 
---
Does that put into perspective? 
---
Like you said, there are significantly more men playing online, and significantly more women saying they stopped playing due to the *sexist" toxicity that's rampant in online gaming. Because I, or any other woman, should not have to hear love confessions, lewd suggestions, or general sexist bullshit when I'm trying to have fun. 
---
thats a macro
---
Just don’t leave 
---
We should have a jigsaw themed event. Where spooky lady is jigsaw.
---
Who don't you have?
---
Bro, i play monty since i started playing (Dust Line) and i never thought about extending the shield for 1 sec just to counter the knife swing like you did...
---
Literally every time I get shot I jump 😂
---
The BOSG is a disappointment to me.
---
It's a double-barrelled shotgun that only fires one pellet.
---
Well the same thing happend to me. I think i made a new acount some time with out noticing it or i just forgat about it. 2 weeks ago i bought the Complate version of R6S and i realised that when i opend R6S from my computer's main screen it would put me in my first account, the starter one. At that point i had to wait for a Ubisoft server update than come back to opening from the Uplay thing. After that point i just had to open Wildlands from my computer and it would put me in my old account, The deadpool one. But whenever i logged out and came back in i was in the new one, The batman one. I have to say that i bought the Compleat edition from Unisoft store and the starter one from Steam. 
---
Just have it be a toggle in the graphics options? Loading up a 3d model shouldn't be a big deal though, the main menu does it just fine. 
---
Pc Eu Shammy.
---
I don’t have maverick, jackal, dokkabei, hibana,finka,lion
---
In any FPS game you should aim for the head, not aim center mass expecting the recoil do the job for you... It's veeeery unreliable, you lose precious milliseconds and overral it's dumb.
---
Not since they fixed The glitched recoil. It’s great now.
---
I’d be so fucking pissed.
---
Not just that but god forbid you do speak because you could just be giving a callout and get vore kicked.
---
Imagine a cyber attack theme. White Maks hijack a nuclear power plant and the tech based operators are the playable ones. Thatcher acts as the announcer and we could get some cool cutscenes with Echo, Vigil, Twitch, and Mute. 
---
Really not a big fan of his design, at least not the helmet, i hope that the season pass skins are good and add a helmetless/ alternate helmet like with Finka and Lion
---
Wow that went downhill real quick
---
Type australian special forces into Google images and the dudes in those photos look like any other generic military personnel, they add post-apocalyptic type stuff to the characters to give them some character. Ya pickin up what I'm puttin down?
---
I wish there was a better bot mode to perfect your aim. Where bots actually move, try to take cover and not stand in the middle of nowhere while you kill 30 of their friends waiting for you to come and light them up.
---
Aliens are not really fitting for Rainbow, but I think it was great to have this side story with operator interactions. Excellent way to showcase their character.
---
Here you have
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/WM7tdpC
---
&gt;Or Phil and Lil's Mom from The Rugrats.
---
I just want you to know the Phil and Lil's mom comment had me fucking rolling dude. Too fucking on the nose lmfao
---
I actually enjoyed it
---
Ah then ya hes better now
---
Just bring back Outbreak nuf said
---
See that's how a bandit will look like i he put to much time watching cams
---
It is a litle old at this point but that tounge tho. She is from slytherin allright.
---
I disliked Outbreak but like many others here I'm totally on-board for a White Masks event, but maybe not Time-Limited this time around
---
i never pick ops in casual and for some reason i always get clash, doc, finka, and sledge
---
GOT 'EM! HAH
---
Hell yeah
---
It's 30k
---
Although outbreak was a nice change I personally feel like development time, money, and effort could be better spent elsewhere...
---
Terrorist have taken control of a skyscraper and are planting explosives ln key points.
---
We send in team rainbow on the top floor and they must work their way through white mask floor by floor to defuse the bombs.
---
Include new types of white mask:
---
Heavy:carrys lmgs and heavy armor. Will attempt to keep the team pinned down with sustained fire.
---
Demo expert.: grenades, breaching rounds(ash mimic device) places nitros as traps. 
---
Basic grunt?: carrys standard rifle. Uses flashs and. Smokes to keep the enemy pinned.
---
Shotgun grunt. Little more armor and health. Carries shotgun 
---
Scout. These guys carry smgs and will be constantly patroling. Once they see players the "notify" the other terrorist. Breaking stealth and drawing a squad towards them.
---
Bomber: just as is in game already.
---
Include some story elements. Banter between team rainbow. And a "boss" terrorist
---
The mask: defends the final explosive. Heavy armored with a mini gun. He shreds through cover like crazy. Tons of hp.
---
The brains: he uses holo tech. (Stolen from alibi)  to have holograms run around the room. When shot they give off a defeaning frequency that makes it harder anyone in the room to keep gun steady as well as blocking sound.
---
The "real" one attempts to flank with high fire rate smg's and flash bangs.
---
Projectors are in the corners of the room. Require an explosive or a lot of damage destoryed. They reduce the amount of holos.
---
The crazy: this guy is erratic. Constantly throwing explosives. He is heavily resistant to explosive damage. He throws cluster grenades that shoot out similar to cadelas. He is throwing out one liners and is trying to annoy and make the player make bad decisions.  
---
This was what i came up with. I think something similar could be fun. Just give us a actual mission. We dont need alien zombies. 
---
Hey, sniper was from New Zealand. :(
---
This is wrong. Around 240 died to the sz force (40 terrorists killed 200 hostages) and 2 hostages to the terrorists
---
Because every kid wants the next fortnite.
---
IMO, the card design makes Siege feel more "cartoony" or League-like. Don't really care for the current aesthetic.
---
I SAID DO YOU S P E A K A MY LANGUAGE
---
i always vote no vote with my friends and so far we’ve got the other team to do it 3 times. Once the only operator banned was lion
---
TIL knowing what someone looks like makes them not crazy. This is wonderful news.
---
Your roamers are the people he’s targeting. Clear all rooms, never leave your back exposed, never go in a corridor. 
---
The game is fucking amazing but the player base is SHIT
---
I have black ice on all GSG-9 and FBI because I bought it in Y1S1, as well as glacier PL universal. PM if you’re interested 😏
---
(This is a joke, pls don’t ban, I’m not selling my account)
---
I’d happily show you my point
---
You should whatc smii7y predictions if you call that hacking. That is just dumb luck.
---
Same I was worried since I had 45 FPS max after installing a new RX 570 graphics card 
---
Damn, sorry dude.
---
Yes!!
---
It was a really fun change of pace.
---
Just out of curiosity, did you ever plan on getting the game?
---
He deserves to be named shamed. I messaged him and he knew exactly what he was doing. 
---
Y’all mind if I protecc ELA 
---
I honestly don't believe this took THAT much developing time to develop, if Ubisoft can spit out so many Far Cry, Ghost Recon, The Division content under short amount of time.
---
But I mean, one of these event every year still seem a lot, but may be one every two years, they should still be limited time event but not limited like 1-month, but like season limited. Because these are zombie modes, they don't belong to R6 Siege.
---
i want them to stop thinking about content and slow down to fix the game, we need an operation health 2. everytime they add more content the game gets more unstable and more bugs are added and ubi doesnt have time to fix them.
---
It’s crazy what people do... sorry for your shit luck with that stim pistol tho.. real tragic 
---
This is how you should view casual.
---
It didn't remove any features so why not?
---
True 
---
Disgusting 
---
Look whatever type of game mode they decided to put in the game, please just let me be able to EARN whatever packs came with, so I've some sort of motivation to keep playing it.
---
Doesn't make it allowed on this sub unfortunately
---
Yeah, but I’m sorry about your story. It’s annoying how toxic some are.
---
but you can’t just i’m R6 O.o
---
Yes. But don't make it a limited time
---
I just lost a casual match 2-3 cuz my entire team left me mid-game
---
am i the only one that thinks they both look completely different in this
---
Cor blimey mate! What are you doing in me pockets!
---
You are a Ubi employee, am I right?
---
The last paragraph is what my friends and I (Australians) have been saying since we heard the news, so disappointed.
---
is it allowed for private usage?
---
This will be taken down by the mods cause they have the big gay
---
Yes but some story for the love of god! 
---
Power strip with PS4 plug in. Just hit the off switch
---
We know nothing about them really. Let’s wait to see their kits.
---
Nothing. Because that's what our laws allow.
---
Lmao nothing better than seeing blitz get owned 
---
Actually the scenario you invented is wrong, but I am too playing gold ranked matches on a Saturday to really gaf about responding to you in greater detail. Anyways you’re reported, so I hope you enjoy the ban for toxicity. 
---
That sucks. I hate terrorist hunt bomb anyway. My favorite is realistic hostage. 
---
Hopefully not with aliens, something that makes sense in this universe with the white mask, tell that tale. I played one game of Outbreak before it was enough/repetitive for me. 
---
Which TF2, because both have awesome Australian characters
---
Hahaha agreed 
---
Just use Tachanka
---
Imo I didn’t mind it but what Ubi really dun goofed with was the release date. This could’ve made a perfect Halloweenie season easily but for some reason was released during IIRC the beginning of the year (pls correct me if I’m wrong). Good idea, cool designs, wrong release period, would enjoy something weird again. 
---
True. The ai is literally just better aimbot. I've seen them have my head snapped before they turn a corner. 2000 iq
---
What if he has the same exact face as Thatcher? 
---
I mean, I put faze in front of my name but I don’t really do any of the other stuff so I think I’m not contributing to the problem.
---
Already happened to me. Its fucking weird
---
I did nothing, except spawn with my team. I literally did nothing, no chats, no movements even because they killed me as soon as they were loaded in.
---
yeah ik what its like on console just toxic, teamkilling kids
---
An event about white masks would be great you know the main villains 
---
As of right now Gridlock looks pretty cool but there’s not much else.
---
Rip
---
I know that, but ela mines suck aswell. 
---
Uhhh what? 😂
---
A story mode where you explore all of the operators while following a story which makes sense (no weird things like aliens/zombies). A little bit like mortal kombat. It would be awesome and would help new players to get familiar with the game
---
Because blitz is OP. And if you are a low rank then I might understand a blitz being trash, but I’m plat 1 and a blitz is the worst. C spam, lean spam. It’s terrible. 
---
Your GF has missing fingers?
---
10vInfinity Thunt?
---
just hit the power button no?
---
Idk if Mozzie is a male or a female
---
Is this not from Tower? I'm pretty sure there's a gift shop there, and the writing in this image doesn't look like it's all in English.
---
"it's ma'am"
---
I’ve missed something haven’t i?
---
Personally, I'd go with Jackal. He has good guns and equipment and is versatile
---
It does mean something, what are you complaining for?
---
Smoke mains unite!
---
I look more similar to him when I don't have a mustache than when I do, funny enough.
---
They are already useless operators in the game. 
---
Honestly operation outbreak was fun at first, but got boring as the season went on.
---
YOU WHAT?!
---
I can think of two reasons that make it painful. A solo queue team being matched against 5 stacks. Getting put on the same team with people that you’ve previously muted, blocked, and reported.  
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Well as you can see on the gif, i got killed after the bar was full and gone, and Hibana wasn't dead
---
Honestly I didn’t care for it. It was different, which was super cool that they stepped out of the comfort zone of the regular play style. I feel like it got played cause it was limited and people just wanted to experience it before it was gone forever. I don’t understand why they’d work hard on something then make it gone forever. That’s so silly to me. “I worked hard on this. Let me delete it now” at least let it be recurring or something. Props to them for doing it, my friends loved it, it’s a shame that they didn’t let it stay/don’t play on having it come back. 
---
Hell ya
---
I have been using for about a month and saw it in a previous Reddit post. I doubt it will get patches soon.
---
Thx mate =) Glad you liked it.
---
But think of it, twitch, useless, castle, useless, maverick, useless, kaid, useless, I’m not gonna sit here and name all the useless ops but there will be too many
---
FUCK YES OUTBREAK WAS EPIC
---
Outbreak 2 but it's actually just Team Rainbow Dealing with Resident Evil 2's plot (plz ubi)
---
her DMR is good if you know how to use it too. if you use the BOSG, there are several variables/odds that don't lean in your favor.
---
I agree we need more events, like this, Halloween, and S.I., but maybe not "outbreak" specifically
---
Beautiful
---
I'd like something similar to outbreak, maybe terrorists using enhanced weapons, security measures, exo suits, so that our OPs can use their gadgets...... Something non alien/zombie. 
---
When are these operators being released, or are they already?  Also, really nice drawing!!
---
me to :p (was the guy screaming in the clip) 
---
I think they should but they should do some drastic changes with it as well. Like add in a straight survival gamemode. 
---
Basically this.
---
Reson I take some time to load is I have to stream the game to a different PC to use a mouse because my PC has only one USB port which my hard drive is using and I can't play on the other PC because it is missing api-ms-win-crt-runtime and I can't find a fix
---
But blitz is scary :(
---
Same in the UK, but I had a brainfart and couldn't remember the proper name.
---
The easiest solution is to introduce a warm up mode like csgo, when the individual doesn't connect, the match should be canceled.
---
Did your brain undergo reassignment surgery too?
---
Would be good for sure
---
You think the Germans really use car batteries?
---
This stopped counting shots fired about a year ago I think. My accuracy has improved dramatically since then. 
---
Maverick create peak holes castle contain an enemy or clear out a bomb sight and castle it up twitch similar as echo but instead of becoming drunk you get zapped you would just have to come up with new strategies 
---
Is that Apex I see?
---
He literally has the best gun on the defensive side IMO &amp; he block most projectiles.. They don’t want him to be OP 
---
IMO Outbreak was fun.
---
That hand be lookin like slender man
---
What 
---
Yes, but it never takes more than ten minutes if you actually measure your loading time.
---
Ten minutes + is intentional and is undeniably an exploit.
---
To be fair your argument isn't scientifically proven either.
---
Personally, I'd like an event where people can work together against AI like outbreak. Terrorist hunt is decent but the AI for the white masks can see you through walls. I'd favor something more like outbreak that has people work together against AI and gives personality and some story to the operators.
---
I think they've done a great job on representing countries special forces so far, especially BOPE, but seeing the Australian operators is kind of a letdown to be quite honest
---
Yea my hand is weird 
---
I loved the idea of outbreak but it did get a little repetitive. If it was a bit more dynamic ala left 4 dead I don't think I would have stopped playing it. 
---
I prefer the spear anyways. It's easy to control with an acog.
---
Knock em down*
---
Idk what this is, but I wish I had been there to play it
---
why can everyone on here draw but me :'( great job tho!
---
“but you can’t just i’m R6 O.o”
---
Yes, that is a macro. 
---
Lmfao why just why 
---
they are implementing a system like CS. where if you played with jacjer that match wont count so you dont gain or lose elo. now im afraid that hacker will keep hacking so that we cant gain elo and advance into ranked
---
a)  If you solo queue going up against a 5 stack is to be expected, make friends and play with them.  b)  How often and why do you have to mute / report (and why)  for context I'm a diamond player from Australia on PC
---
Yes I genuinely did and I forgot to screenshot.
---
