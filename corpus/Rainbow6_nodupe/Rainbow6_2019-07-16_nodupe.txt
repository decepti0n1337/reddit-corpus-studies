Nice

---
---
Alibi and echo. Easy.
---
?
---
Lesions mines are okay as they are with the damage nerf they received last patch
---
It started as a bug but they left it in as it didnt bother anyone as people knew to just check corners but then new players joined complained about how this was abuse of the shield and they nerfed it (still in game just got corrected by another guy)
---
When he gets banned, it‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt know how to counter it properly. The character in defense is pretty useful.
---
Rage. It happens to the best of us, the trick is not to get disheartened. Maybe you can say ‚ÄúThat Guy was shit I shouldn‚Äôt have lost‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat was my fault I died there‚Äù and that‚Äôs ok, the next step is learning from those experiences.
---

---
Maps. There are a lot of them, all maps are in casual and I think there is 12(?) in ranked, try learn them as much as you can. It will take you a very long time and it is trial and error but you‚Äôll gradually get better.
---
Sound. Sound is very unique in this game, there are videos on YT explanations how the sound works, I would highly recommend watching them. This takes some getting used to and even the best players make mistakes with sound so just try your best.
---
Operators. The characters in the game all counter each other directly and indirectly, certain ones work well together and certain ones don‚Äôt, as you play you will realise who does what and who plays certain roles. You won‚Äôt be able to get all of them immediately but the basic ones you can get are what the game is based around so you are not missing out that much.
---
Enjoyment. It‚Äôs a game after all, while it can get tense and frustrating you‚Äôve got to remember that it‚Äôs for enjoyment, if the game is stressing you out there is no need to carry on playing, just stop for a little while or maybe for the day. No one will judge you or look down on you! I made this mistake a lot a few seasons back.
---
Best of luck!
---
He's French, of course he did.
---
No it doesnt, it depends on how much you have played
---
Wow this same thing again. I haven't seen this exact same spot posted 30 times before
---
Impossible, cav isn‚Äôt banned
---
They should nerf the concussion effect, it‚Äôs ludicrous how long it lasts. That‚Äôs my only gripe with him.
---
and other games work just fine, don't know whats wrong with siege
---

---
Yup, I started ranked in Gold 4 this season as well. Decided to play it somewhat regularly for a few weeks. Now Casual players bully me for being Bronze 3. Help me guys.
---
Yeah I know, but I just hate that guy's attitude, I know I wom't convince them, but maybe someone else reads that interaction and changes their viewpoint before they end up too far gone as well
---
Hahahah you actually took me fucking seriously holy shit
---
Ikr that‚Äôs rare but cav is a pain in the ass
---
I work in Software Development and do game development for a hobby. 7 months sounds like a system rework or major overhaul. My suggestion could be coded in a work week or two (depends on their tools), QA'd within the month and tested in the next season.
---
Both quick and right. Even if it pushes their planned changes back or this fix would be removed in Y5S1, it's solution for sooner rather than later.
---
But I obviously have no idea how the Ubisoft's internal workflow and systems functions, nor will I pretend to. I problem is this isn't a "7 month" issue, it's been a problem for over a year and will be closing on 2 years by the time Y5S1 rolls around.
---
It depends on how many matches you've played. It's part of getting to your "sweet spot". The more matches you play the closer you are getting to where you belong so you start gaining and losing less
---
You have the best username on this sub
---
That's what the 2 frame option does, yeah. If you had a 60 fps monitor, turning on 1 frame vertical sync would limit your fps to 60, turning on 2 frame vertical sync would limit it to 30. That should consume far fewer system resources. 
---
There's also an option to limit your fps in menus, I think. That's usually where the gpu starts going wild in some games. Just poke around the graphics and display options, most of them should have descriptions of what they do.
---
Actually none whatsoever besides the fuze elite skin I use on the PMM. I just got extremely lucky with alpha packs
---
I also noticed Kaid ‚ÄúThe Moroccan Cobra‚Äù has a bounty in his head as well.
---
That's what I'm wondering
---
I‚Äôm sure if he stood still, he still would have dodged your shots.
---
The insane amount of discipline to not fire at them is very impressive. Shooting the breach charge broke me lololol
---
WHEEL he take home the win? Find out next time, on terriblepuns!
---
Ikr i have never seen anyone do that
---
nah its se√±or sin casa
---
At least he didn't surrender üòÄ
---
Because it is abuse. Allowing people to glitch into unintended locations is a slippery slope. How long before players start finding walls they can clip into again if they left it completely untouched?  
---
And they didn't nerf it, they "fixed" it by making the shield collapse immediately on detection. It still being possible is still an unintended bug. It was never changed "Because people can't check corners", it was because it's a bug.
---
I believe there was simply no debris. Not like the current one anyways.  
---
Which is honestly preferable, I'd take less eye candy over dying to bullshit any day.
---
Blitzraptors!! I knew it!
---
I potatoed of course I‚Äôm going to miss
---
That‚Äôs what she said!
---
All we wanted was another alpha pack that‚Äôs it not a skin for a gun most people prob don‚Äôt have
---
Ayy lmao
---
You weren't in the game...
---
The Legacy operators doesn't cost much . While the DLC operators are pain in the ass . Thanks to operator price reduction . it started to become easier to gain for DLC operators
---
Do they have ninja defuse award
---
It‚Äôs not bad but rather you were unlucky that happened. 95% of the time I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs solid in terms of stability.
---
So if you buy the base game you get the basic 20ish ops off the bat then you save renown(in game currency) to get all the other ones. I've been playing a year and a half and had to spend renown on all the base ops as well and just got all the operators. It's a bit of a grind but Atleast you get time to learn each operator instead of a bunch of operators you know a little bit of but it not much of a chance to master each. Also now it's way easier to buy since when I started buying dlc ops it was 25000 renown but since February it costs less for older ops so shouldn't be too bad

No scopes gives you better view, acog takes up tiny portions around the ports that you could be using for peaks, plus slap a grip on and that bitch is unstoppable, acog prevents room sweeping, iron sights makes long distance and room clearing that much easier

If you want to get there you gotta prove you can make it
---
How did it go, did ya ace
---
are people deaf?
---
For some reason I was under the impression the Starter Edition had less than 10 playable ops.   20 is a decent start.    
---
So a DLC op is at most 25,000 renown?   And whats the renown acquisition rate you guys would say?
---
Lmao, ‚Äúmaybe in lower ranks‚Äù it‚Äôs definitely jackal, I‚Äôm a plat player btw, it‚Äôs going based off the most common ranked bans which are jackal, blitz, echo, and caveria
---
How dare you underestimate his power
---
Yes we know you're retarded OwO
---
But it's still finka...
---
&gt;concussive cameras that are **99% invisible** are very difficult to play against without an IQ.
---
  
---
Maybe on consoles or PC players with small screens, but I have no issues spotting and prefiring Echo drones. Its glowing effect is a big giveaway, especially in doorways and such.  
---
On the contrary Lesion is a bigger issue than Echo with how much he gets rewarded for his 0 skill invisible mines.
---
Every time i seeing post like this, i always have question: What about start doing something? We don't need to know how much info on some issue/problem you got. "Less talking. More action". Stop this "We know about this issue we have a plan to fix it", just fucking fix it. Then you finally start fixing something , this game will lose a lot of players. What is your problem you armless lazy bunch of a-holes? You are fixing release problem for 5 years, fixing small problems for months, lol. And we have to do is struggle and waiting. For years.
---
How did you get this
---
I've played 800 hours and I ain't never seen this shit.
---
Blackbeard has an entire body where you could hit him. You don‚Äôt have to go for headshot all the time. You can outmaneuver him. With lion, you had enough time to get in a  good spot, and yes,  stand still while the ability ended. Now it‚Äôs quick and you either risk getting spotted while moving or you stand still. With echo I already told you how you could handle it so I‚Äôm not gonna ware my time repeating it.

Hello Reversefrostyy! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
I‚Äôm going to respectfully disagree with u/tornadocan , as maestro is incredibly useful. He specializes in defending reinforces walls from hard breachers. 
---
As for the vigil or maestro decision it heavily relies on if you like to play aggressively or not. For example, if you want to get kills and that‚Äôs your main objective then vigil is probably better. If you like holding angles or scanning enemies then waiting for them to push to get a kill then maestro is the better option.
---
Do you 5 stack?
---
All jokes aside vigil is the most fun and the deadliest, lesion takes more iq but barely, and is a beast, and has more possibilities for information and set ups. Kaid is amazing when needed, and his shotgun is super fun. Clash isn‚Äôt even worth your time in her current state. Can‚Äôt go wrong with any of em
---
How long have you been following this game? I‚Äôve been playing since beta. Can confirm these targets will be missed. Honestly, prior to operation health there were less issues. This game needs operation health 2. They cannot keep up with these bugs.
---
Bruh
---
Cause it will always be a thing and not something that they can just fix. Most of the issues stated here are fixable issues with a end point. 
---
Hack detection is a ongoing process with the help of battleye and wil always be a issue thats being worked on.
---
Why are we upvoting someone for smurfing to make fun of low rank players when higher players smurfing to low ranks is such a problem as is? OP should be ashamed of themselves and so should all the people who upvoted this, this is not something that should be promoted as an acceptable thing to do in the community.
---
I was so proud of my self when I got gold one by only doing random matchmaking lol
---
If the challenge isn't complete, will they give out the prizes anyways
---
They're probably wearing Rook armor.
---
That‚Äôs rainbow for ya
---
I don't think they believe operators are getting banned because they're too strong -- they have win deltas for that -- however, the issue is that the same operators are getting banned every match, which is reflected in the pick rate deltas. These obviously aren't the only data points they're looking at for this issue, but they might play with ideas to make banning other operators *besides these 4-5 operators* more appealing. What that might look like, I'm not sure. Your suggestion of adding other operators which perform similar roles might be something they consider, but I think it's unlikely that they'd add something similar to blitz to the game at this point. 
---
(TBH I'd rather they change blitz back to a 1 speed, as I think that would certainly affect his pick rate enough to the point that he wouldn't be banned every round.)
---
Fair enough, I've been like trying to figure out if I could change it üòÇ
---
Yeah, i would add a 3rd claw, and maybe a little buff to the aug
---
Quite common, its been around for a long while. You vault on the blue little thing and then climb up
---
I see your point, I guess i just didn‚Äôt come across any good maestro players bc everyone that I see who plays maestro are bad but if you can handle him go for it
---
Can mozzie actually take a twich drone
---
they prioritize PC far, far more than console even though console has the bigger playerbase
---
Nice to know we found some common ground on what the game caters to lol. Hey and guess what Diamond and Plats mainly fall for frost traps than Bronze and Silver players, gee I wonder why that could be?? Surprised no one wasn't screaming for a frost nerf.
---
Username checks out
---
I think Tachanka will get one with his rework but Montagne I‚Äôm not sure when he‚Äôd get his since they started giving Year 2 ops (Lesion yo start with) Elite skins so who knows when or who will get the next one.

Clash is amazing if you have a 5 stack to communicate with.
---
This shouldn‚Äôt even be a discussion in the first place. The answer is yes.  
---
It‚Äôs not a balance issue. Alibi is already capable of matching her Prismas, so looking different wouldn‚Äôt change that state at all (aside from edge cases in which uniforms can match surroundings, but that isn‚Äôt exactly exclusive to Alibi).  
---
It‚Äôs just a question on whether you can.

Actually, we can do it with the revolver too. And the BOSG, as already pointed out, is a slug shotgun. However, they don't allow us any custom sights, so getting headshots with iron sights and our main weapon as a BOSG, pretty hard to do in my opinion.
---
No, I didn't think we'd be able to do it, and I don't think we still can. Honestly, Ubisoft probably expected a large increase in player count.
---
Tmi if you want it: As a Mira main with 800+ hours (hours =/= skill, hours = experience) I did actually come back from my break to play the game, but I still don't play much due to the toxicity this game holds beneath it's layer of initial fun.
---
Sorry, I accidentally flashbanged you.
---
Tachanka won't get one until his supposed rework (which should have happened by now). The only base ops without an elite skin are Castle, Monty,  and Chanka

It does make a difference. Two rounds would make 100% more sense

How many wins you need to win the match? 4

Why isnt it 2 rounds rot then? 2+2 makes 4
---
Much more equal
---
Console players don't look up, takes too long.

Yeah, we could tell your age by your weird overuse of the crying laughing emoji. Since you want to compare this to riding a bike; this is more like an able bodied biker constantly cutting off someone in training wheels.

i think it's around 700 IIRC, but I'm not sure
---
I agree with you, in that it's hypocritical for the subreddit to both

upvote this post AND to keep bitching about smurfs. Either smurfs are ruining the game, or it's the coppers' faults for being inexperienced at the game, there is no inbetween
---
So when is smurfing and exploiting a fun thing? 5k upvotes? Alrighty.. don't get mad when the community is labeled toxic.
---
Outstanding move
---
Vigil for purely kills. Maestro if you wanna play slow and have good map knowledge.
---
interesting but it didn't prove any point lol. that initial comment was pretty irrelevant to the topic at hand.
---
Stop being a party pooper, I'm just trying to make people laugh
---
OP is a deranking smurf, this is against brand new players and copper accounts.
---
My only problem with Jackal is I'm the dedicated roamer on my team that I play with and unless I play Cav or we have a mute on our team, there's no way for me to counter out or reduce his utility without running back to site. 
---
That and being able to scan footprints from the floor above is a busted mechanic.

I don't know enough to answer you yet!

how the fuck do you fault on the blue thing

if only the challenge was for another pack instead of a mediocre weapon skin for a gun that no one uses. if this challenge was at the beginning of showdown, it would be done already

Looks like doc is having sleep paralyze again
---
If you win 3 rounds as def and then 1 round as att where does that make sense?
---
With 2 rounds each it would be much more equal. Its simple maths

"Hopefully these damn terrorists won't strike for a few months, I need to ship in me parts, try to find an ol' hydrogen bomb chamber, fill it with big emp"

vigil is pretty great and I'd think J√§ger as we

They're talking about the bug introduced in last week's patch that makes Echo's drone almost completely invisible.
---
It seriously recommend watching the video and then come back and say 3 round rotation is bad. Or maybe remain ignorant, I don‚Äôt really care, just trying to help people realize why it‚Äôs a good change to ranked.
---
why does the grip look so L A R G E

I would rather have the consequences for the issue be forced on those who initiate the issue rather than those who did nothing but get matched against them. Plus casual exists.

But that might be op? My point is being able to use cosmetics while not getting a disadvantage because of it.
---
Only a literal fucking potato would at all compare pro play to regulars.  If you aren‚Äôt a complete idiot then you would realize that the metas are entirely different because of the absurd difference in team work.  It‚Äôs beyond stupid to even make the comparison.
---
These operators are all banned in my elo of plat and above, acting like it‚Äôs only coppers that don‚Äôt like them is objectively false.
---
Literally all of your stupid counterpoints are just ‚Äúget gud‚Äù.  You can reposition all you like against Jackal, he will still give away your general location with the easiest and most risk free ability in the game.  It‚Äôs stupidly easy to close off and kill any roamers he tracks.
---
Just fuck off already
---
Ubisoft plans on making elites for every operator in the game
---
Epic. Btw how do you get up on that spit

Lol don‚Äôt waste ur time they don‚Äôt give a fuck about play experience. They just want u to buy cowboy skins and season passes

You look like you're about to have a *peaceful* protest in Portland's town square.

Every roll is a separate event though. Even though 20% is equal to 1/5, it doesn't necessarily mean that if you roll 5 times you will end up with a pack.

Woah there. Chill man,I‚Äôm sure if they see this they‚Äôd be happy to help
---
This is exactly why I main Monty lol
---
I am incredibly unlucky when it comes to lootboxes and all that microtransaction bs. On average It takes me about 63% to get a pack and when I do its just a duplicate or a rare skin for an op I dont have or want. I have a theory that the game knows who I play and always makes me have a significantly lower chance for a skin or outfit for an op that I like to promote buying packs. I suspect this because every time have gotten many rare skins for Alibi. The operator I have the lowest time on. I dont know but I feel like the odds arent random because the devs have to code it in right? And there is no law against altering the odds yet right? Maybe its just a conspiracy theory thats 100% wrong because I keep seeing people get cool skins and .01% packs and Im stuck with Maui on a shotgun I dont use for the 2000th time in a row....
---
If you're copper IV you just suck at the game. Take time to learn the maps and callouts a d what every operator does. You dont play smurfs every game.
---
Alt-tab out of the game tab back in by clicking the game icon, playing in windowed could also be causing it.
---
Oh, well that‚Äôs unfortunate . Maybe go in a custom game and see how it looks i guess lol. They might bring it back to casual like how they did with favelas who knows
---
Godspeed
---
At that point just take a break from the game for even a couple hours or a day. Youd be surprised how you play when you start again.
---
This is my highest concern, none of that thinks listed have fucked up my games than a troll or worse, a squad of trolls/hackers/shitters

The most often used place to put her holograms is in windows to get pings on prefire.
---
My point, is being able to more frequently put holograms out allows her to catch people off guard even more by throwing one out where someone may have already checked.
---
I also tend to find my most successful uses of her holograms are always at the end of the round.  Put a hologram out at a key angle with 30 seconds left most often than not gets me the win.
---
Her gadgets successful use is more about timing and placement as opposed to its accuracy to the real thing.  Ive used her season pass outfit since launch and still get detections.

I just saw it today in PS4 .

Ah console players. You never see this stuff happen usually

Seems to me like you're not being there for your team when they need you

Pineapple main.

Wait would you be okay with someone calling you the n word then saying it‚Äôs just a joke?

Reeeeepppoooossstttt

The real question is why you‚Äôre using smoke‚Äôs pistol
---
I'm considering valk or hibana
---
Big oof
---
Anywhere he wouldn't have to turn frequently to be effective. Supply room on Kafe 2nd floor, for instance.
---
So would you be okay with it?
---
My bad
---
I can't just stay in the site all the time. Someone has to do the roaming job.
---
If only
---
Personally I like mutes the most. I also have hibanas.
---
She‚Äôs like vigil, a solo op that‚Äôs mostly used for fragging, you could run into site quietly while sneaking past echo drones, valk cams, and maestro cams and take out unaware ops that are on their cams or holding a different angle
---
What should be expected and what people actually think are often not the same thing.
---
Just reset your modem and force the DHCP to issue you a new IP.
---
Console
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt care the word is old as fuck and shouldn‚Äôt be taken as a horrible word
---
That stupid pirate head gear is get EVERY TIME
---
It‚Äôs harder to solo queue on console because atleast on pc there is text chat
---
Sorry if this was rude or something . I didn't mean to
---
That sentence did not really make sence
---
Because getting killed by Nokk alone is no where near as detrimental as getting downed by Cav alone.
---
Yeah let me back track my trail, off site, while I‚Äôm being pinged to the entire enemy team. Ez kill
---
So do you think through this logic for a gay person that‚Äôs it‚Äôs just a joke and that they should lighten up?
---
Wait...is strafing not a viable strategy on PC?
---
Being team killed is never a joke unless it's with your squad even then unless you're a 5 man it's not funny as others not in on it suffer. 
---
You honestly sound like you deserved it cause you're a bitch. 
---
I called you a bitch as a joke btw. 
---
Not really though you sound like a dumb bitch. Fun and game to you fucking with people but when the script gets flipped you sperg out.
---
How can i sleep after this now....
---
Gotcha
---
i will never get that shit, im mostly a moba player and i never knew about derrankers till i started playing games like csgo and r6..
---
fucking stupid
---
Oh ok :(
---
That's ok :(
---
i bet he plays rust too
---
Yeah because if it‚Äôs a joke then it‚Äôs not serious
---
It kind of fits
---
Clown
---
its a red doot on the worst operator in the game currently
---
Terrorist hunt. Play a metric shit ton of it. Not just for practice, but you need to hone your sensitivity down. My recommendation is keep your horizontal fast, and vertical lower. Always be aiming chest to head level, because one shot head shots are a game changer. Personally I use 90 horizontal 36 vertical and it works well for me with my elite controller with custom settings, and the long right stick.
---
&gt;he is not good.

5000+ elo on two accounts with a like 1.5 kda?

Wow. Everyone in this comment section fucking sucks. Yeah it's not right to TK but his response to that is to DDoS an entire server. Pretty sure that's illegal isn't it? Cuz the servers are bought and owned by Ubi right? So they are essentially "destroying bought property. I'm no where close to know anything about law so idk. 
---
But as I said everyone in this comment section suck, calling op names because he tk'd in a fictional game. Calm down you fortnite players. No need to swear because little Timmy caught you with your pants down with a tactical shotgun and default danced on your corpse
---
How do you get the wallpaper to act like a video like that? I also have an iPhone X so I would love to know.
---
Okay . i regret asking
---
I do agree with your statement but to be fair on console it‚Äôs pretty fucking hard and I consider myself pretty good at gun control.
---
Some mixed opinions here
---
Weirdly, my favourite part of the video was when you both (in unison) turned away from the stun grenade and then turned back.
---
How do you get the main tag?
---
soloq i can confirm this. most of the games I'm 1 v many because people die early in the round, no callouts, playing what they want not what we need, people in plat barely knowing how to defend and attack and now I'm hard stuck in plat 3 even though most games i have 10+ kills clutching rounds ... 
---
soloQ is hell especially when we get mm against diamonds and full stacks of plats
---
Thatcher trying to secretly eliminate all electricity on the planet with an EMP nuke is my new favorite thing ever.

He hides a barricade in his shirt, gotta keep it lookin slim
---
Both are strong in their own way. Use either one depending on what your strategy is.
---
Clash problem - can be fixed
---
Ddos - Absolutely no way of fixing or solving
---
Those enemies are terrible. No wonder it's 3-0. But well played. A rush will catch everyone off guard.
---
Either that or give us more time.
---
New player, u/BullyingCoppers deranks so he can destroy new players, hence his name.
---
imo, he‚Äôs an asshat.
---
Mp5 any day
---

Clash just continually prowls around screaming at everyone trying to have fun.
---
Lag switching most likely
---
The event was live for 3 weeks &amp; they added the challenge during the last week when most people have lost interest. Makes sense.
---
This is like lowkey wholesome but also makes a lot of sense lol
---
If you need anyone else, I‚Äôd also be interested in helping out.
---
We r6 trackered them all and it was a plat 2 I‚Äôm triggered
---
I have 1
---
I think a good nerf idea would be for him to scan footprints and only him to see the ping... it makes no sense for the entire team to be able to see it. 
---
It would make him play the way he was intended. An antiroamer by hunting the roamers down
---
So just like Ranked on Xbox. Got it.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs sucks. Worst part is that Ubi can‚Äôt fix Ddosing because it‚Äôs impossible to.
---
You make a fair point, thank you
---
Is this ranked? If so, not cool.
---
If it's casual, then nice clip.
---
did you soloQ before ? I'm not the best player out there but so far I've yet to meet good players last game i played yesterday my teams died 20 seconds after we start attacking on defense some try to spawn kill end up dying, no one gives intel, .... so yes soloQ sucks massive nuts
---
Yep, came here to recommend Alibi as well. Her SMG isn‚Äôt quite as stable as Bandit‚Äôs but honestly I like it a little more
---
ez 2k

Say it louder for the ones in the back (Ubi)

"High rate" is closer to almost every game. I've started voting for not them just to get a semblance of variety

Nah its technoblade
---
Playing with 4 retard isn't a big deal as long as the Guy or the two guys in the other team play with 4 or 3 retard as well facing premade while your own team mate are a Bunch of trisomic isn't fun waiting for the solo queu play list
---
They could still change them to be less frustrating while not seriously nerfing them. Jackel being able to scan a player once for instance isn't a huge nerf but would make him less annoying at least.
---
Personally. I run the mp5, it‚Äôs a fantastic gun. Shotgun works as well but I prefer the smg.
---
Jesus. U need to tag this NSF1amredditor
---
Bruh it‚Äôs not gonna happen

If you're gonna camp longer angles etc, mp5. If you're gonna sit on sites etc. Shotty.

---
I rarely ever see Cav banned. It's always echo, lesion, or mira.
---
lol this is why I quit every season after hitting plat 2 or 1
---
I'm a plat 2 normally and decided to play solo queue with some randoms. None of them talked. They rushed the objectives solo and overall played like its CoD team deathmatch. I typed that this team is full of fuck ups and retards, and my comment got flagged.
---
Yeah for me literally 2 years now
---
Ok
---
I forgot about this spot
---
Seeing as how much you like bullying people you see as weaker than you im gonna go ahead and say you only said nice things because they patted you on the back first.
---
I'm probably not the best person for this advice (fallen from gold 2 to bronze 4) lmao. But having a good DPI you're comfortable with whether it's small mouse movements or long mouse movements is a good start. Slower dpi should be more in game sensitivity and a faster dpi means a lower in game sensitivity. Playing games that make you flick to things also helps. OSU kind of helped me a lot as well as that steam aim game or whatever.

Happened to me too today, very confuzzled

The same thing I tell everyone that says these things.  You have to find a group to get out of that elo.  G2 and up you‚Äôll see some communication if not all the time, and below that is people in party chat listening to music or keeping themselves on mute till you piss them off.

It‚Äôs far easier that way than to just endure it and push yourself into a funk of negativity.

I‚Äôd also suggest taking a break for a week, do something else, play something else that you can truly enjoy. Then you‚Äôll be back after at full capacity again, and hopefully with a few friends to queue up with you

Ubisoft said im not the owner of the account WTF im literally balling my eyes out, not even ubi can help me, im done with siege im actually fucking sick of this game

Glaz doesn't only work in the last 30 seconds of a round and yes, a lot of maps are a bad Glaz pick but a lot of operators are like this. Not every site needs a Bandit, Frost, Kaid etc. Glaz is good when played right. If your team makes a strat about going for a fast plant, then Glaz is amazing. Planting is the literal objective, and playing glaz helps you plant as you can easily cover. I know the new Glaz is nowhere as near useful as the old one, but I'm trying to say that he can still be played right. Obviously, any other operator is more viable then him OVERALL, but certain situations call for a Glaz which is when he should be played.
---
jackal isnt just a comfort ban, he is banned a good amount in proleague (unless youre saying those players dont do strategic bans as well). but you are right he gets too much info for free
---
shields do need to be nerfed though
---
I have it for the M59041, SMG-11, G36C, SG-CQB, LFP586, GSH-18, FMG-9, MP5K, UMP45, P90, 9x19VSN, I had to double check and see all the ones I got.
---
The ones I want are R4C, 416-C, 556XI, and maybe the MP7. Though I do have it for the 416-C and M870 on my smurf and it‚Äôs bittersweet.
---
There was one left on the enemy team on Chalet near the helipad and I decided to jump out the Trophy window and run to the tower and climb it. Immediately after I look over to the helipad and I killed the poor sucker.

Tell them that they literally just helped you. You should have gotten an email with the support number give that to them prove it‚Äôs you and they should be able to return it.

My point is what does it look like when a gold 4 doesn‚Äôt take it seriously?

I highly doubt that.
---
I main Moz and gridlock in my squad now (since Mira gets banned a lot) and OH GOD is that shotgun potent! It has almost similar Killing potential to Buck's MASS, and that shotgun by the way guarantees a down in 5m, even 7m at times. Same for the super shorty.

I hope that was sarcasm. In no way is the team that made this challenge and skin related to those fields at Ubi.
---
I have no idea
---
I played against him last night in a ranked and he stopped me from getting back into gold. Oof. I‚Äôll get the meme back though. I clipped it too so we have more proof anyways. He wasn‚Äôt even good, he teleported outside during our attack round right after spawn and I flicked on his head. Still lost though
---
They‚Äôre  not getting it

Did operation health have a seasonal skin? Just curious lol

That shield looks about as effective as his current one, tbh.

What do you expect. Every post about it gets downvoted and the poster gets told to get good or group with friends... Because that has an impact on matchmaking... Wait no it doesn't.
---
Looks great
---
Sosig op
---
I'm not sure how I managed it, but I fuzed myself last night...
---
It's a game mode with the most god awful shotgun in the game. If you want to see bad hit-reg use that shotgun. And Ubi wants it to be only headshots?
---
Jackals power is like cavs. Its only useful against uncoordinated teams or players with bad positioning on there own.
---
And how exactly do you know hes a smurf, maybe the other guy isnt the best of players

The ban list is easy to fix.  Give players a vote in percentages. If there voted ban doesn't get banned then they get a weighted advantage and count for a higher percentage next time.
---
This repeated until your pick is banned.  This alone will see bans change.
---
The middle one is horrifying. I would rather get interrogated by Cav then turn the corner and see vigil with that headgear charging at me.
---
&gt; but this implies you even have a mute
---
So you're basically complaining that there's no counter. When told what the counter is you complain that urgh you have to use the counter though.
---
No fucking shit sherlock.
---
Yeah i just see both real and tan, this game so over intricate so i never know
---
and mute.
---
What about a gamemode that would give you a random op, then mix up the guns for both sides and gadgets for both sides
---
maybe bright blue-ish
---
Except he isn't.
---
His flash is crap unless in your face.  He has a charge between flashes and he isn't a speed demon.
---
He only kills people with bad positioning.
---
It was at this moment, that he knew, he, fucked up
---
Who knew a company whose number one priority is to make profit would put making money first.

Kind of, play ranked games, try to be friend with your team-mates if you see that they have an actual brain and know how to play and ask to stick together for future matches and carry eachother up, like that you might also get live advices to what to and what not to do

People in the same game say they want to win and still ban blitz and ash like wtf wasting bans

---
But i understand what your random teammates are talking about. Hibana is in ranked a needed breacher, therefor the team needs her to stay save and defended till she has opened the way for the Team. They might be afraid of you playing her like a entry-frag Ash
---
Problem is, debris give away positions of important things when they are on the ground. The window that's boarded up but has debris laying in front of it? Could indicate a valk cam or lesion mine outside. So it's kind of important for game play at the moment.
---
&gt; have some other counters
---
Like caveria. Like literally operator who can use his scan against him. Do you know how many maps have verticality or destructible walls? I've tricked jackal into thinking I'm one floor, immediately jumping down and coming up behind him for a distracted kill.
---
Maybe you just need to learn how to actually counter jackal, instead of complaining that there is no counter.
---
No that's not needed. This game needs coordination. Specific trap locations specific to the owners is enough.
---
This is why you're trash at Siege. CANNABIS IS BETTER THAN BOOZE.
---
Learn to use punctuation, mate.

Use what you want as long as you succeed. Don't listen to anybody else unless you want to.

I said cav is the only real counter to him if you learned to read your see that we were talking about mute pal no stfu and go take ur shit somewhere else
---
Dude chill I found it on the internet like 6 months ago and decided to post it now. Its not like i said ‚ÄúLook at this Tachanka i drew‚Äù
---
Well I would only justify doing it so that the overall team strategy isn‚Äôt blocked, like if a common rotation is reinforced, like between bomb sites. To me, it would be worth it to tap them a couple of times ideally only dbno and then reviving. To me, killing them as punishment the next round leaves the team at a disadvantage
---
Same shit, different day.

Can‚Äôt keep original for 4 years straight.

And that's a fact, jack!

And Finka boosts.

yes me and hundo clap our opponents like that &lt;3
---
???
---
Thing is if I actually saw drastic improvement in the back end and with balance id defend them. But the game is in a awful state right now. I cant even play ranked without either a hacker or lag or some other bs ruining my game.
---
if you‚Äôre going to post anyone‚Äôs art, even if you didn‚Äôt claim to draw it, you should credit them. it‚Äôs internet etiquette

no

Have you ever had a full 5v5 in casual? Because for the last two years I dont think I have lol.

A timer for leavers is a must, but I wouldnt brand it as a penalty or sanction, call it a "cooldown" to make it seem less harsh, and Id start with a rounds' lenght timer first.

We've had a similar event before but it counted headshots across all game modes, which means it was ticking up passively regardless as everyone was playing the game as they would normally. Unsurprisingly that challenge got completed way ahead of time.
---
This time it was limited to a game mode specifically, and with guns that have a high chance of just killing on body shots, so it was less likely to happen as quickly.
---
Had they put the challenge up at the start of the event maybe we would have had a shot at it overall, but hey this is a way for the devs to better judge what goals to set for the next time.
---
Unless the bug is completely game breaking then she‚Äôs not going to get removed
---
You are the guy in all of my ranked games
---
Yeah this shit is happening often to me as well
---
Yeah people with high ping no longer have the advantage
---
\*sag J√§ger noises\*
---
G29 with adapter?
---
It's a challenge, we didn't beat it so we shouldn't get it.
---
idk maybe it will return someday. maybe they'll put it in alpha packs?
---
It's not  monitor it's a TV that I play console on you can see a ps4 and a ps4 controller in the picture plus I was in a ranked game so i just did what i felt was the fastest
---
Yh I like the fact they don‚Äôt break the meta it‚Äôs just it seems like a lack of creativity with this season that‚Äôs all
---
Well they would have to first address what makes Echo annoying to play against first.
---
As of now Thatcher in theory does what you suggest Dokkaebi could do, one thrown EMP nade would disable the Yokai and render Echo unable to use it for 10 seconds or so, similar to what a call would do in terms of disruption.
---
So even if Dokkaebi could call Echo's wrist phone, people would still ban him a lot in ranked anyway, but devs have mentioned in their recent "Known issues" post they made that they are indeed looking at how to balance ops based on pick and ban, as in see what the reasons for the bans are and work to reduce or eliminate that reason (usually being "They are annoying to play against").
---
Once they address that, then we can see if Dokkaebi calling him could be required or not.
---
Yeah, that's how R6 used to be.  Could even choose JHP or FMJ bullets (or slugs/buckshot).  Full loadouts should be available to "Tier 1 Operators".  Saying "Oh, well your guy only gets an FMG-9...well, just because" is silly.  Was never a balance issue in the past because even though some guns were better than others, everyone had access to them.  I.E. 99% of the player base would probably choose the R4-C and an acog, but it's not unbalanced if *everyone* has the option to use it against one another.
---
I think Ubi has said before that it will increase the load on the server and cause a lot of lag which I think is definitely a real reason for it to stay
---
Oh, it was ranked? You're right, that makes it different. He probably ragequit, reconnected, and ragequit a second time.
---
But it‚Äôs now essentially a free game so I can‚Äôt complain and I‚Äôm not bothered but they definitely could‚Äôve done better
---
G920 but yeah, + Aliexpress drift steering wheel haha

Hmm I don't think I've ever been killed when using it. Quite often don't get any kills either though

Jackals ability should be reworked so that the ‚Äútracked‚Äù players footprints appear on the entire teams screen, being brighter for more recent and more transparent for old, allowing players nearby the ‚Äútracked‚Äù player to have a good idea of where he is but not the exact location every few seconds.

2 weeks of pay to win Wild West skins will clearly solve all these issues. It‚Äôs sad because this game is great, but it has the potential to be so much better.

Oh yeah because I am sure the enemy team was full of joy that this happened.
---
Hindsight is 20-20
---
&gt; including individual performance within the match
---
Pretty sure this isn't a thing, as Monty/Echo players would get quite pissed lol. 
---
&gt; it‚Äôs an average between the lowest and highest MMR player score on your team and that‚Äôs the area of opponents you‚Äôll get.
---
Seems to be the average of the entire squad's MMR, not the average of highest and lowest. 
---
From the link:
---
&gt; **If I usually play with the same team, how do you determine the difference between my MMR and the MMR of the other players on my team?**
---
&gt; We don‚Äôt. If you play exclusively with that team, then we will have a fairly good estimation of the MMR of that team. If you start playing without them, then your MMR will change. It won‚Äôt represent your skill, it will represent a mixture of your ability to win by yourself and your ability to win with your team, and this mixture will represent the probability that you‚Äôll play with your team: aggregated, it is the probability that you‚Äôll win in general.
---
But this still doesn't answer the question as to why I should gain the same MMR/Elo as someone of a higher rank when we beat the same team. 
---
And it's not to do with condidence values either, as this season a Silver 3 was getting same points as a Gold 4, both having played equal games (as they played only together).
---

oh no i had to scroll past a picture FUCK

Meanwhile, be me, with 40ish% and still not land on it 3 games in a row.
---
No person would have that small of a head.
---
Because it views the team as one unit that should have a 50/50 chance against the other team. You're not individuals in the eyes of the system.
---
No such thing. Or you mean the CSGO one?
---
Hey, let's outline the enemies.
---
You know what other operator did that and what that did to the game.
---
No outlines... Not even for a second, not even to just own operator.  Pings are sufficient.

I didn't say to make Debris server sided, I said to get rid of it. We have disappearing debris already like papers, books, boxes etc. Don't see why this behaviour can't be replicated with barricades.

For bodies, i'd say make the bodies sink into the ground like in CS:GO so you can tell where he died but they are not as obstructive.

Hello EcKhan, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cdvnbl/no_luck_all_skills/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

we can all agree this could be called ‚ÄúTrip to Copper‚Äù
---
You are a bunch of weebs
---
That needs to be a sub
---
It's working exactly as Ubi intended, it's quite a simple system. 
---
- yes a party is matched by their average rank
---
As far as how much MMR you gain or lose there are only 2 factors:
---
- difference in average MMR of 1 team compared to the other. Silvers beating golds means they get more than beating other silvers. Golds  beating silvers means they earn less etc. (Same for everyone on your team)
---
- how many matches you have played this season, the more you play the less you gain (individual)
---
Nothing else is included in how much MMR you gain or lose.
---
Nokk and Warden are both kind of a waste of time. If you know how to turn away from a flash you'll be fine as any operator. Warden having to sit still to see through smoke is a waste as well. Nokk is actually noticable on cameras as a pixel blur running across the camera (if shes running only I believe?)  so can still be called out.

I guess Echo makes sense with the Yokai cloak nerf.
---
That's not counter playing Jackal specifically. That applies to literally anything that pings an opponent and even then you're suggesting I'm close enough to Jackal that I can flank him within the 3 seconds or so between each ping.

Whenever I‚Äôm in private match with my friends I always reinforce and castle it. Top 10 strats

I'm in the UK and don't have to pay a penny for a static ip.

Your Internal ip changes on most UK networks if you turn your device off and on.  An ip ban doesn't apply to this ip.

You can get around an ip ban easily but simply waiting a day or turning your device off doesn't resolve the issue.
---
Not here goddamit
---
You aren't even roaming correctly if you're across the map lmao. If you're that far from OBJ with no rotations back, you deserve to die. You are out of position. If he tracks you, that's intel. Remember where you were and now you know where they could be pushing. Take your ass back to OBJ and communicate with your team, you could conceivably counter push that or just wait it out. On defense, you don't lose anything by waiting.
---
There's ways to counter Jackal, but like I said, people are lazy as hell and/or bad and would rather run around with impunity as a 3 speed or spawn peak as Doc and when they caught up they feel dumb. So they ban Jackal or Blitz. And on offense, they wanna run around and stall for kills and push at the ass end of the round trying to thirst for their K/D and not have any environmental awareness so they ban Echo, Cav or Lesion. Creates a stale meta where tactical decisions are pretty much null when you can get just get rid of the problem and run around.

Yeah, it would be a lot worse with the number of votes being hidden. Random opponents would be banned a lot. Many times I change my vote last minute if I see that my first choice won't win, but I have the deciding vote on other operators.
---
I also often use the bandwagon effect to my advantage, I hurry as fast as I can to vote for the operator I want banned and more often than not the rest follows me.
---
Well this awkward, but thank you anyway lol

Thatcher also works as counter, at least if you are about to plant; just throw your EMPs and try  to cover the whole room. But yeah he is very powerful.
---
I strongly suspect that the percentages Ubi has listed are not representative of the actual rolls. It's hard to believe that someone could go from 50-80% without getting a pack (even assuming not all games played were wins)
---
No take more
---
Where can I find this video?
---
Nah, close to 0 utility isn‚Äôt worth buying instead of others
---
TV series
---
I'm not to sure I'm a fan of it either, since I played ranked for the first time, and I got 2 abandons in my 10 placement matches, because my internet crapped out at the end of 2 matches and I can't always count on it when I do play ranked
---
I think Siege needs a new engine...
---
The problem is the game mode isn't any fun, and it didn't help that they waited until several days after the new mode started to introduce the challenge.
---
I would opt for that too. But knowing Ubi, the pricing would be all over the place in order to increase the sale of R6 credits. Even if the system changes, Ubi will find a way to stick it to us.
---
Yeah you either need an IQ, a Thatcher throwing EMPs right when you are about to plant. Or a few extra seconds and a teammate checking the ceiling to shoot the yokai when he makes the first sonic burst.
---
I think Ubi is full of shit, however it pisses me off when gamers treat all DLC the same. Cosmetic only DLC is worlds apart from stat-changing DLC. Yeah they all suck but in no way are they even in the same ballpark. It makes it difficult to rally against stat-changing DLC when people refuse to make a distinction between them. It really waters down the argument.
---
I like you

Thanks cap.

The issue with this cosmetic MTX is you purchase the *chance* to get the cosmetic you actually want to buy. I don't think most people really cares about cosmetic MTX otherwise.
---
I personally do, because it incentivizes default cosmetics to be shit to mediocre so people will buy the MTX.

Why the fuck would you repost this meme without editing it at all? Didn't even add a fucking caption to the image.

Happened to me and my friends as well. We 4-5 stack most of the time but we all lost 150+ points

That guy guessed correctly a lot of leak before they were announced, sadly it should be true...
---
It doesn‚Äôt look half bad.
---
IKR, so disappointing.
---
So you didn't type anything that could get you banned?
---
It had the same principle people claim hacker when their not. 
---
And hacker is someone cheating at a game using foreign software so by definition hacking=cheating
---
More like aim to the left of his toes and let it go everywhere but his head
---
No hackers in copper.
---
It will be easy if it was truly a community effort. Just stand still and let opfor headshot you. Then next round swap.
---
Nah
---
Restart the game.
---
&gt; It had the same principle people claim hacker when their not
---
They're entirely different sentences. They talk about different concepts.
---
&gt;And hacker is someone cheating at a game using foreign software so by definition hacking=cheating

The problem doesn't lie with the terms hacker/cheater.

Is this your vid?

Uhhm I found it in Facebook maybe?

Sometimes I love this game and other times....
---
It‚Äôs hard to reconcile that Jackal doesn‚Äôt have a better win delta. I‚Äôd still want to bring him even if all I could do was see footsteps, without being able to track them. That‚Äôs still useful intel when you‚Äôre clearing out roamers (e.g. to see feet running upstairs when you‚Äôre attacking basement of clubhouse). 
---
But even my personal stats, I have a much better track record with other operators. I think it must be that chasing footsteps distracts from being prepared for a gunfight. While I‚Äôm busy staring at the floor, puzzling out where the footsteps are going, I‚Äôm not listening closely enough, and my gun sights are out of position to react to someone coming at me from around a corner.
---
Yes
---
You can‚Äôt self promote on here dude
---
While I see your point I also think it would be difficult to ask people to buy a new game but cant play competitively with their friends in ranked until levels after 30 because of how long it could take. I feel it would discourage new people from buying the game however you probably are right about learning everything in 30 levels
---
Yeah, mega oof
---
Hey that's pretty good
---
Because this community is garbage
---
As a tip: Search Rouge9 on Youtube. Can't search out the exact Video, but he did about 2 on this "problem". If you're interested watch the more recent one. Helped me out to understand why and how. It has to do with distance to the corner you're peeking.
---
I guess we can agree to disagree on this one lol don't know how you can defend the broken system haha
---
Those spawn rushers are going forward
---
Porn title
---
You should play ranked at least at level 50. Keep in mind that you'll have your KD forever and you shouldn't ruin it because you're inexperienced.
---
Where would I post this then?
---
&gt; I guess we can agree to disagree on this one
---
No, the two things you wrote do not mean the same thing.

I bet most games are losses for people who get regularly above 50%. Assuming all wins by 40% the odds of not getting alpha pack are below 1%.

There are so many good cosplayers out there though, I could never compete with that + I'm too lazy +  I prefer standing behind the camera rather than in front of it  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø. But this one was fun, maybe i'll try more in the future
---
I'm scared, and a little aroused.
---
Blitz doesn‚Äôt get picked because his gun is trash, and his shield doesn‚Äôt fully protect him. Pro league aim will win against him more often than not. Monty is the much more powerful shield pick. Cav doesn‚Äôt get picked because she doesn‚Äôt bring any utility to the team (no cams, no ADS, no traps, no Mira window), and her guns are relatively weak (her pistol is pretty powerful, but there is a lot of pre-firing in pro league and automatics will beat pistols in most standoffs). Vigil has the same problem of no team utility, and is also very rarely picked. But he is sometimes picked, whereas Cav is never picked - because he has good guns. 
---
Your advice for dealing for dealing Jackal is naive. It‚Äôs rare as a defender that you are holding enough safe territory to be able to sprint around the map like a toddler on a sugar high. Especially if you get tracked later in the round, you‚Äôll hit an angle that an attacker is holding and die. Or get pinned and die to a grenade, a shotgun through the floor, a wall bang. BEST CASE, you‚Äôve just wasted 30 seconds being useless to the rest of the team running for your life. And when the Jackal track finishes, you‚Äôll probably be tracked again!
---
I want to sell the diamond skin because I put it on zero weapon, because it's ugly and idk why I have it.
---
Exactly! Or better yet getting shot by someone you physically can't see.
---
This comment explains more than I imagined
---
Now thats a breakout
---
It's not just you Aussies its us Americans too.
---
Lesion should be getting reworked instead of cav. Lesion isn't that big of a problem compared to cav in low ranks. But, lesion is just far too good
---
ITT: Gamers who don't realize that Ubisoft has to make money in some way to keep supporting this game with maps/operators 4 years after it was released.
---
CSGO offbrand mode that only sees people magnum spamming. I would be surprised if anybody played after they got the alpha pack.
---
It's still pretty lucky, I got an IQ headgear for my first pack, which was only a blue.

---
That was the system before Outbreak. But apparently the loot box system worked in Outbreak, gaining them more money than by selling the specific skins individually, so they kept it for every event afterwards.
---
And I mean, I can understand them in a way. Why would they sell the skins individually, maybe getting 10‚Ç¨ from a couple more people, if apparently a bunch of people are willing to buy 30+ lootboxes for 2‚Ç¨+ each, which are full of shit like ugly skins you don't want and charms.
---
It isn't consumer friendly, and I don't like it, either, but it won't really change as long as people buy lootboxes, I guess.
---
if you cut xp gain it's going to be a pain in the ass leveling up as a high level. It already is. 
---
Granted, considering you don't get anything from it exept the satisfaction of saying "PROMOOOOTED" they might as well remove it. 
---
But nonetheless we need those milestones to achieve so I think raising the level cap is probably for the better. 
---
However, this raises several issues. For example:
---
1. How high? With how much playtime can one be considered a good player? I have hundreds of hours in this game and probably still don't know everything about it. Which brings me to...
---
2. Playtime doesn't equal skill. I've seen people get killed from basic spots at level 150. Later more to that.
---
3. What even is an appropriate level of skill? That varies from player to player, from rank to rank.
---
With this in mind, I think we should probably get rid of the idea of "minimum skill level" all together. I instead propose that we should rework the situations to be more reflective of ranked mode and make it a requirement to play them. Playtime doesn't help us, if it's not used to actively aquire the skill you need for ranked - and how many new players do that from the beginning?
---
Why hereford 3F is free win in my opinion - 
---
Hard breachers are useless.
---
No soft floors on the core defensive positions.
---
Very limited paths to come from. (pretty much only 3 - the 2 indoors stairs and the main stairs from outside. There's also the balcony but its very risky to rappel into.)
---
Enjoyment of games isn't just about winning rounds.  Some people like to enjoy a games auditory and visual elements as well.  If cosmetics didn't matter, then why did they put them in the game?
---
‚ÄúHang in there‚Äù
---
I see nothing wrong with pick/ban phase in game. Jackal is a pretty strong operator and banning him is a legit move that opens opportunities to roam. Echo is too strong on every possible gameplay level and something needs to change.
---
Cav and Blitz on the other side are really crap and they often get banned on gold level or below because...well they just work on that level because players are not coordinated and don't know how to fight against them properly
---
Lucky bastard
---
Cosmetics do matter, and that is why they are behind a paywall. How do you expect them to keep this game going for 10 years without any funding?
---
Too much lmao
---
I think that you shouldve got the packs either every 10 wins or instead of a normal alpha pack roll so that u could sweat for the packs
---
Yup, you are limiting yoursellf to a small group of operators which are, IMO, pretty out of meta and not really useful in current state of game
---
I personally hated it
---
Yo you have literally the same weapon as i did 2 days ago (changed the sight to holo)
---
Easiest way to get them to change is to not buy them. When they first started it was only like $40 now it‚Äôs like double. The only items I find worth it are the pro leagues because you get 4 for roughly the price of one elite
---
Casual is a bad place to learn the game  and I think raising the level requirement for ranked is a good move. Game is just too complex and it sucks to play without a group of people that would introduce you and help out with the game

We are talking about Siege, not about newly released games. Siege should be more and more optimized as time goes by but exactly opposite happens. People even with insane PCs fail to run this game with frames they deserve. Average fps is decreasing with each and every season released for no reason. Exact opposite should happen, fps should increase more and more, game should be more optimized with less and less bugs and glitches.

Okay let's start with the most recent topic.
---
Is it true tha BattleEye has different tiers of service? From what I heard this is BS but hey, maybe you know this.
---
IMO if they started the challenge when showdown came out at first they would‚Äôve gotten extremely close to finishing it because a bunch of people were hyped for the new mode and a lot of people were playing it
---
Yeah honestly there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs an actual copper. De-ranking to stunt on low rank players is ultimate cringe.
---
seeing that they are optional and in no way necessary to play the game, and are purely cosmetic, I don't really care.
---
That would be as if you would count up all the cosmetics in the whole game and say "to get all cosmetics in the game i would have to pay 12.000$, that's rediculous".
---
I normally never buy any of them, I only accept the ones I earn/given. Most of the skins in this game aren‚Äôt appealing IMO.
---
Okay, then why the fuck would you post it on reddit?

To the first part of your response, we both know there are a fuck ton of smurfs in this game. Also I‚Äôm about lvl 110 and I still get kids &lt;lvl 20 in my games who are solo queued. Secondly, the complex maps is what keeps the game fresh for me but that is more of a personal thing. Also the diamond charm off one map wouldn‚Äôt really be ‚Äúskill‚Äù, it would be a unfair way of getting it. Also you I‚Äôd like to hear of your plan would be playlist driven like CS, T hunt map selection style, or something else. Final point, it is unnecessary because bad maps (ex: tower) are filtered out of ranked already.
---
Lol i literally just posted about this at got 9 upvotes. And people told me to stop complaining because it was how they can still make money to support the game when everything else was earnable...shoulda put aussies in my title.

The two main FPS I play now is PUBG and CS. CS I suck at as my aim isn't that great as I'm getting older my reactions aren't quite what they used to be, PUBG I'm pretty ok-ish because you can use tactics to outplay people, would this game be suited?             **Yes**

Is there a competitive scene/ranked thing in this game?    **Yes and it's growing.**

What online modes are there? Are there deathmatches or is it all tactical?   **Tactical with the occasional goofy event for flavor. No respawns in any game mode at all.**

**As others said, this game has a very steep learning curve but is worth the effort.**
---
 **A few tips:**
---
**Use Newcomer mode until you get to level 50. It only lets players level 50 or lower into the lobby. This is a big deal, some of us have more than a thousand hours in this game, and you don't want to play against those people if you don't have to (1100 myself).**
---
**Use**  [**https://discordapp.com/invite/rainbow6**](https://discordapp.com/invite/rainbow6) **it is a great place to find people to play with. There are literally always hundreds of people on and looking for others to play with.**
---
**Someone already said it but it's worth saying again. Play with friends. Leavers are a big problem in this type of game. Especially in ranked where they don't get replaced by the system.** 
---
**Lastly do yourself a favor and set your terrorist hunt for bomb only so you can learn the ranked versions of the maps. Try to ignore the maps that are not in the ranked rotation. They're not worth learning imo. The most balanced maps in the game are all in ranked. Below is a list of the ranked maps:** 
---
* **Oregon**
---
* **Border**
---
* **Consulate**
---
* **Clubhouse**
---
* **Coastline**
---
* **Bank**
---
* **Villa**
---
* **Theme Park**
---
* **Kafe**
---
* **Chalet**
---
* **Hereford Base**
---
* **Skyscraper**
---
* **Fortress**
---
* **Outback**
---
**Good luck, if you need a friend to play with you can hit me up in game.  My Uplay name is JagarSantovenia, and nope i'm not any good.**

no gold dust skin and no diamond charm. seems lame

They can make money while disclosing the probabilities of their gambling practices, that's required by online gambling, and real casinos in most countries. Yet that is not the case when it comes to computer games.

I thought they patched that spot? I cant get up there anymore using the old trick. Then agian I havent played for almost a year so I could just be doing it wrong

Headscarf is spot on and the phone case looks like something Valk would use.

It‚Äôs cosmetics so I don‚Äôt really care, if you want to buy it then buy it. If it‚Äôs too expensive just don‚Äôt buy it simple problem really

Haha! Thank you \^\^

Then buy a different skin for them.
---
You have to press the 3 dots in the top right corner when youre in the subreddit main page. Then click change flair and choose which one you like (you can also press edit flair in the top right corner when in the change flair screen to ttpe in your own text)
---
This must've been why they did maintenance. They were just deleting the skin from the files.

I love low-budget/lazy cosplays, there's a charm to them.

They are also a good reminder that the heart of cosplay is fun, not looking like you deadass jumped out of the universe, though that's also really cool.
---
I didn't get a Black Ice until I got level 140, and I got it for Sledge's shotgun.
---
They're still all winter themed.
---
Those packs cannot be gained by in game time. Purchase only/unless you by the whole bundle (partial purchase = roll attempts)
---
Damn, that's a hell of a low sensitivity.
---
Try to increase the horizontal to let's say 50, horizontal on 25 or 30, and ADS between 25 and 35, should yield you better results.
---
And of course, don't forget leaning while aiming..

I don‚Äôt mind it at all. Do you like how cav is dressed like a prostitute for every map not just clubhouse?

You should get the elite for your most favourite operator. If your fav doesnt have an elite skin then I cant really help you besides telling you that my fav elites are for IQ, Mute, Sledge, Valkyrie and Fuze

Not about competition  buddy, its about passion, heart and soul.

The best cosplay I ever saw was still just "okay" in terms of appearance but the way they rocked it and really owned it really shined through!

I want a sniper that he‚Äôs supposed to be, not just another op with a dmr and a fancy scope
---
I play lion more than I probably should lol. Save his ee-one-d (or at least one of them) for when you get to the objective. I primarily use it to ping someone coming to the objective, or when I'm about to breach into the objective and want to know if someone is waiting for me. However, remember that he only pings players that are moving. If someone is camping out at objective, you're not going to know and that's his major downfall. I find Dokkaebi works better and serves as a decent distraction. You can also take dead enemies phones and use their cameras to your advantage. 
---
Both of these operators are better as support though and limited to what you can do.
---
I really like your scissors.  -- Is that a webcam next to it?

Sure. It's been reposted tons of times. I mean sure, if you browse reddit once a month, this could be new to you. But the majority sees it as a repost.

Hello Nootnootrecruity, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cdzn0d/my_current_outfit_for_the_lord/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I‚Äôve noticed vaulting rotation holes works amazing having a frost mat on the other side
---
I'm going to guess what's happening is something like this: 
---
They probably missed certain failsafes (poor programming no excuse at an AAA company) and banked on the fact their code properly stopped people from entering another state before reverting the effects of the current state (clearly not)
---
leaving u in that new state without the old state effects being properly reverted (because the timer/animation never ended or whatever is happening). So you end up with the effects of the old state + the changes that happen from the new state which makes for nasty bugs if there isn't a failsafe in place
---
Unfair you lose points from losing that sucks
---
By PL do you mean placement or playlist or what?
---
I can get into Siege but it says I failed to reach the matchmaking requirements.
---
But they're just cosmetics. They are not needed to buy...
---
So does skynet
---
Yeah you‚Äòre right, but pc is alot less toxic than console and you are more likely to find ppl that are up for some fun at least from my experience
---
By the end of this year if all the legislature passes, what Ubi is doing, and even Apex and Fortnite, will be classed as gambling in videogames and banned in the US and EU
---
That Clash is livid
---
There's 2 operators that only have 1 fully functioning eye
---
Probably but the ipad thingy is made specifically to have an insane range, phone probably won't have that.
---
Latency maybe?
---
had they released an alpha pack challenge along side the CC then it would have been completed i think. week 2 we had no reason to play it, unless a game mode is REALLY fun people only play it for the rewards, wich showdown lacked severely, reduced renown and alpha pack gain.
---
skynet knows all
---
Idk what's going on
---
How do i survive the sun? It's simple, I just say inside :') Im not a fan of hot weather, I prefer to stay inside with my AC. And if i'm outside i just hide in the shadows like a vampire
---
I don't think a few people disliking some maps is really a concern.  Those are three of my favorite maps, although I would at least be willing to concede that Hereford has some problems.
---
No sense in wasting time trying to please all the players with the ranked map pool when there are actual issues at hand that affect gameplay.
---
I got a legendary in my second alpha pack on pc, now I can't even get a rare.
---
For fuck's sake, quit crying like a baby and just fucking move on. Christ, you're annoying.
---
Honestly, still a pretty good crossplay. Low budget or not.
---
But then it works the other way so that you can't just run through when you need to rotate
---
I've played against that guy! He is fucking bonkers!
---
well i was gonna play some ranked today but since all these damn glitches are back i think i‚Äôll stay put
---
Does she have the same thing I do? Can't bare being in direct sunlight, it's absolute agony and sends shooting pains down my eyes through my head, doctors diagnosed me when I was a kid so I can't remember what it's called, this it starts with Hem-somethingsomething. Basically never take my sunglasses off before 8:30PM
---
Interesting, might have to try that
---
I was thinking the same thing when it first happened. No way of telling for sure though.
---
This sub has been brainwashed and hasn't believed that this was going to get worse ever since Outbreak.
---
The game is monetized like a free-to-play that you pay $40-$60 USD for, and the in-game currency system is garbage enough to justify that kind of payment. Making these """""""""""events""""""""""" around not using that currency you worked so hard for is the kicker.
---
There hasn't been a game within the past year that genuinely gave people an advantage for buying things, because every single developer across the globe knows what a problematic system looks like thanks to the money-printing Star Wars game and EA.
---
The fact that there *hasn't* been at least some sort of majority of people against it is baffling. And the people arguing "it's just cosmetics durr" need to realize it's not about the cosmetics, but it's about the premise behind it. 
---
And the people arguing "I'm trying to support the developers" -- Dishing out $40 a year for a season pass is enough. Ubisoft has made enough money off of the Year 1 Launch of this game *already.* Also, it's Ubisoft. If something has a substantial playerbase for a long enough time, then Ubi is happy as long as people paid for the experience. Continual profiting off of these """""""""""events""""""""""" is only increasing their pocket size, and feeding into the idea of randomized lootboxes/chance for cosmetics is only going to keep the system alive.
---
Classic goobisoft

Yeah whenever I play ranked, it‚Äôs always those four getting banned

It's like talking about designer clothes. They're just as good as anything you can buy in most clothing stores, it's just for bragging rights. They're aimed towards rich kids who don't care about spending that much on stuff they will probably replace in a few months.

You can use any keyboard in the world to play siege. It's the mouse that's important.

Also try to increase DPI in mouse settings and lower sensitivity for more precise aiming

I don't have that either, haha. I don't have a lot of stuff, i spend 90% of my time in front of the computer anyway

But for defenders most of the time vaulting is fine, you won‚Äôt really be in a rush most of the time to rotate

Why is this the last one I would be interested to see more extremely low budget cosplays

Play if you can tolerate the fps...if you find joy out of the game then why stop playing it.

"No u."

Wow...I see no reason for anyone to pay mind to you anymore.

Just give him VS Val.

I don‚Äôt want any more maps in ranked until Hereford base is removed. Fuck. That. Map.
---
Ok but tower is a good map change my mind I do agree though
---
No, you lose points from winning either with or against a cheater. If you lose the match, again either with or against the cheater, you get the points back. It takes that match away so any changes made by it are reverted.

it's the Ashe main that solo rushes every round

Then don't. Aside from being a meme, it was also a pretty valid point.

Gotta rest up from carrying his team
---
thats why i wish they bring back certain events like this like once a month type of thing, they do this "exclusive" tactic into making us buy all the packs thats over 60$ for the skin we want or collect all of them unless putting 20hr+ grinds to get them
---
same :(
---
Tower IS a good map though
---
Too little, far too late.
---
wtf is the tachanka glitch
---
If it was another pack, be goddamn sure people would've done it.
---
EA might have the worst marketing decisions but they have decent servers AT LEAST. Since when are we waiting for France and African servers for R6? Oh yeah over a year now. Great. And dont forget the weekly maintenances, DDOS in console everyday and more bs.
---
Probably because this game is actually going to shit worse than ever, and it's player base is slowly but gradually decaying.
---
Does the in-game report feature actually even work?

Assuming you start at 3% and win 10 ranked games in a row there us only a 10% chance you would NOT get an alpha pack.
---
Y last
---
Would you be content with a clothing store where half of the items were only purchasable via spinning a wheel with a 2% chance of getting an item of clothing you actually want?
---
The only reason to lock stuff behind alpha packs is to try and get people to spend a bunch of money trying to get something good from the pile of crap that is the alpha packs loot pool. Then, they release great cosmetics for their events, but give no way to purchase the things you want, instead you have to roll for a chance at the thing you want. 
---
I‚Äôm saying that I‚Äôd be much more inclined to just spend a bit of money and get exactly what I want from these events. I haven‚Äôt spent a dime on the packs because it‚Äôs bullshit predatory gambling tactics. I would spend a bit of money to buy the cosmetics directly though.

Y‚Äôall remember a few years ago when they had the Halloween event and you could buy Hibana‚Äôs ghost outfit, headgear, weapon skin, and charm all for 40k renown?
---
I can agree with you
---
That's not bad
---
Low budget but still good
---
(btw i didnt downvote you)
---
im not saying the items should be free. i realize they have to make profit and agree with that. 
---
what im saying is they dont even test out the price point of $20-25 for all the packs, which i believe would have more people buying them and they would make even MORE money. myself + 3 people i play with would have put up $20 each for the packs, none of us spent anything because you need to spend $80 for the whole thing
---
also it adds to the stigma of predatory lootboxes which is bad for the game, you could write an article how ubisoft is preying on kids/gamblers because they give you one 'teaser' pack so you get something then spend money trying to complete the outfit, in teh same way a drug dealer gives the first hit for free so you come back for more
---
How is that ridiculous? It's not like you have to grind for the originals.
---
No because they‚Äôre just cosmetics, the only time you even see yourself is at the end

Hello the_real_Dmoontj, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ce0rca/what/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I‚Äôve given up on this game now. Ubisoft are so incompetent it‚Äôs farcical.
---
PlayStation players had to get something crazy like 9,000,000 headshots because of the larger player base. There's no way any platform made it
---
Lol its HD i dont have Xbox one X so dont matter. I know they're cheating. They had one diamond
---
halfway through i stopped playing it lol

In other words, if stunned by a yokai, try and stay as still as possible so the effect wears off quicker. You can still look around but walking will worsen the effect
---
Red rectangle made in Photoshop and made as a joke-cheat
---
And thats gambling with strict regulations and age requirements.
---
Yeah, I do it for the joke +I make call outs in Russian, which make me get removed from the match, but it‚Äôs fun when with my comrades.
---
Who are you missing?
---
And I'll reiterate again. He's supposed to be long range support, he is not supposed to be an entry fragger. If you're engaging at 9m then you've screwed up. This is not a matter of opinion, it's what he was made for, long range support.
---
So you're telling me that when you play as glaz and you're hitting yellow and it's not having an effect then you're perfectly happy, because I've yet to see a glaz player not losing it when that happens.
---
Ps. I'm still waiting for your ideas.
---
Where would the shield go though..?
---
I would suggest Lord Tachanka or Caillou
---
How do y‚Äôall have titles
---
...I don't know what I'm looking at.

User flair checks out
---
There for sure is however, that is 1, really hard to so and 2, you need good communication.
---
Holy shit it says you have a 40,000 Gb update
---
like on their back, how it is when you swap to only a pistol in current siege
---
Well 've got the cheap ones
---
almost all of them just missing the 10k+ ones
---
You dont need all of it. But you might pay for all of it to get the one you want.   
---
its like asking for a your new car to be painted Blue.  "oh im sorry you will have to just pay for every car until one comes out blue at the factory."
---
I will never cheat in R6, this is my favorite game, i put like 980 hours in it
---
should ban monty then cause he's actually good.
---
It's not random at all, casual uses a similar mmr system to ranked but completely separate
---
I personally don‚Äôt like the diamond skin. It took me all of last summer to grind for and I was honestly let down. I would get the ops or alpha packs.
---
Is this real?
---
Thank you salt, very cool!
---
No one upvote this it‚Äôs perfect

haha def has some problems but issa discussion for a reason

Yeah, I kept seeing people flying around in it when i played last night. Literally flying into the skybox smacking heads.

I never said you were wrong

Yeah... but why?
---
Operation Flatline...
---
You know they just using a rubber band for recoil compensation
---
Don't have to survive the sun if you never go outside

---
Idk but 40,000 GB is a lot . 40 is a lot to never 40k
---
Yeah?
---
 Yeah, that‚Äôs why I just take my free pack and live with whatever it is I get.
---
looking at his post history, I'd say yes.
---
unfortunate we haven't had a non seasonal bundle in over 7 weeks and this could be the first one we get lol..
---
I think the main factors were that the gamemode wasn't all that fun after about an hour or two, and getting headshots in a closequarter semi-auto small mag shootout people won't really be aiming for the head with their 6 revolver bullets or their 2 BOSG rounds.
---
Sensitivity is 85/85 for anyone wondering.
---
It was my understanding that Clash is banned because she's still bugged
---
Its not 40k its just 40
---
This happened to me as well i got the 1gb downloaded in a minute but then the copying was taking forever so I deleted the update and tried again and it jumped to 20gb so then i put it in rest mode and when I checked on it again it was 40gb
---
I don't know about where you live but for me the nearest game dispensary is far further than any sane parent would let their kids wonder.
---
I feel ya, buddy.
---
Wtf is going on xD
---
Get Mozzie and save the rest of the renown for other better skins/future operators if Ubi makes a fun one at some point.
---
Also a garbage game mode tbh
---
&gt; however when you see a message pop up saying that your MMR was adjusted by "removing" points it's a loss.
---
Net zero on that game. So no.
---
Not saying you have to, but I wouldn't write it off. Just treat it like a casual hobby and only do it when inspiration strikes.
---
Hes in a different language where they use , instead of .
---
You may have to save a bit more, I don't know the prices because I haven't bought a operator in a while but I recommend maestro or nomad for sure.
---
Wrong place in the wrong time. They should move a banwave after the event.
---

---
So because someone posted a video showing iq abusing the claymore glitch, you think this post is only about iq? Its about the claymore glitch dude. 
---
If they posted this but with Maverick abusing it, this post would still be about claymores dude. 
---
You sitting here saying ‚Äúthis wouldn‚Äôt of happened if they fixed iq‚Äù is irrelevant because people would be using another operator you dip
---
I WOULD BE SO MAD!
---
Nope
---
On Xbox we only had to get to 2.5 mil and we only got to 1 mil
---
Yeah i don‚Äôt really know because some of friends on console say it‚Äôs the most broken gun in the game and they can‚Äôt do anything about it. But while playing on pc i don‚Äôt see it of as big of an issue
---
No they were fixes coming up not what was currently fixed
---
So.. this skin is never coming back and  nobody has it too?
---
2 plus 2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3 quick maths
---
Their accuracy depends on your. Again. It‚Äôs up to you. We can‚Äôt make that decision.
---
Rainbow Six constantly gives us free DLC so I don‚Äôt mind
---
Given this has only ever been about IQ, and its been happening for near a month - if this suddenly applies to another operator ill happily reconsider, but currently IQ is the only known operator to use this glitch.
---
Godammit battleye banning the cheaters when we need them
---
That's not really an effective counter-argument.. Video games glitches are usually considered something which gives the exploiter "supernatural" advantage. 
---
Jumping over a shield isn't a "supernatural" power. It's an in-game-embedded-feature.
---
Reflex is better for guns with more recoil because the tip of the triangle is where the bullet goes, so if you aim for the neck, you get headshots more often. But honestly, whatever is most comfortable... holo takes up more peripheral sight but the bullet goes directly where the red dot is. Swings and round abouts...
---
Both are fun, Mozzie is stronger because he‚Äôs more team focused.
---
Nokk is great but she is very selfish play style that only helps the team if you frag out or her very situationally like planting a bomb in a spot being watched by cams. Her best ability is her silent step. She won‚Äôt win body shot fights with people who know where you are, but if you play well, they won‚Äôt.
---
I like to think people with usernames like this spend their days scouring the internet looking for post to match there name
---
The Jaeger headgear? That's so dumb
---
We wanted another pack not a shitty skin
---
I spend 15 minutes a day on reddit, nothing wrong with that.
---
I'm gonna clarify this for you. It doesn't matter if 1 person reposts, but when tons of people do it, it becomes a problem. For example, imagine this: 1 person throwing trash outside doesn't cause any problems, but when tons of people do it, it becomws problematic. Same applies to reposts since they're also fucking trash.
---
This event was ridiculous
---
real copper moment
---
you can't cheat on Xbox :/
---
randomized cozemtics is the worst. let us purchase what we want instead of having to rely on luck and overspend. but that is the point unfortunetly. most if not all new unique cosmetics are limited time to real money alpha packs.
---
We pay the same amount as much h as a brand new game here in the US.

Shiiiiiiet you are right sorry, got it all mixed up.

Congrats my man!!!

Vaulting over a shield to get to an UNINTENDED spot is glitch, stop rationalizing your desire to abuse the game.
---
You‚Äôre literally arguing for the claymore glitch, you know that right? Its an in game action that is caused by a set of inputs any player in siege can do...
---
You can though :/
---
no. you literally can't. the most you can do is DDOS and use mnk
---
&gt; still costs more than the price of a triple A title to get all 31 cosmetics
---
this is not the issue imo. the issue is that depending on your luck you have to dish out that amount money just to get the item you actually want.
---
No you literally can, I have seen people using aimbot back on 360, I have been with people who have used aimbot, just because it's not talked about doesn't mean it can't happen

It‚Äôs not bragging. If I wanted to brag I‚Äôd tell you to look at how much karma I have total... plus I‚Äôm saying if this many people upvoted they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bronze/copper tier gameplay.
---
And I don‚Äôt play this game as much as you probably do. I started end of grim sky and didn‚Äôt actually play the game until the end of burnt horizon.
---
It‚Äôs quite easy for me on the Star Wars sub.
---
I didn‚Äôt really think that far about it, well i see it like Ddos gadget can work on the principle of the Tesla towers
---
what comes into contact with the ground or building is affected
---
so I assume that the whole map gets under the influence and everything is in it
---
except Lion ESP device
---
Defense:  Maestro--one of the great guns in the game and a strong gadget (that's good for support).
---
Attack:  Gridlock (smoke and retake denial), Nomad (retake denial, flank watch) and Dokkaebi (smoke, anti-roam, general PITA) fit what you do.
---
God damn it Ash, she literally has no head, how do you expect us to get headshots????
---
Yeah the way the system works now is that if you're matched with a cheater it just doesn't count the match so the ELO loss/gain becomes 0, as if the match didn't happen. It sucks that it takes ELO away if you win, but sadly not much can be done about it .
---
we're not talking about xbox 360. we're talking about siege. you can not run hacks on Xbox one.
---
there are other ways to keep cool unique items rare without having to rely on predatory buisness models.
---
Thanks for the method I just learned kafe in like 15 minutes :)
---
Well we disagree. Having a thing that you shouldn't have had in the first place taken away isn't losing it.
---
The devs banned claymores because they needed to be reworked, not iq. They banned clash though because clash was glitches. Obviously it‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äúfix iq‚Äù if they didn‚Äôt just ban her
---
You made the star of David...
---
Only a small and very linear portion. It's also completely predictable like all other situations. So that sucks.
---
big diffrence is that ubisoft actually make good games, they just put scummy micro transactions in all of them.
---
The diamond? It got changed so diamond is purple and plat is blue
---
no they dont
---
Once I get home I'm checking if this works on PS4 and it does I'm going to annoy the shit out of my friends with hide and seek on Coastline
---
It‚Äôs the 3rd worst balanced map in the rotation coming in right behind chalet and skyscraper. And it also has the most heavily defender sided bomb site in the game.
---
I like the new one and the map is only defender sided if the attacking team lets it be. I would understand if the map had just come out but its been nearly a year since it‚Äôs release and people are still bitching about it in Ranked when it‚Äôs one of the better maps.
---
Good point. I guess that's just the nature of analog sticks.

they dont have servers in egypt nor turkey but if you connect to south east asian servers on pc you can get \~80 ping which is nice

Well we all know what we're getting you for Christmas this year.

old hereford was unbalanced but still fun to play imo

You just destroyed this man's career

It's called free weekend

But old Hereford was at least fun in casual. This one isn't fun in ranked or casual IMO.
---
Reports ready
---
You quit playing it.
---
I personally never liked clash in the first place. Her ability never interested me and I don't like the idea of a shield on defence, it was the big that allowed you to shoot through the shield that made me really dislike her. Personally I only use her as a meme or to annoy people in custom games. Other than that she's just like caveira and blitz, more obnoxious than anything else. Exept I play blitz, and *sometimes* caviera because I like what they can do.
---
Works with defenders too, and all you have to do is jiggle the right stick around, and it will eventually move your camera up to the railing, which will give you the press A (X on PS4??) to vault, you have to hit it immediately though or you will fall iirc.
---
As much as i love this game, i cant play it anymore. There are so many glitches, bugs, exploits and straight cheaters that its impossible to enjoy it. Then you got people plugging in their mouse and keyboard into their console, and i‚Äôd rather just play dead by daylight.
---
Perfect punishment for the cheaters as well, forcing them to play that terrible gamemode.
---
Is it bulletproof tho? ü§î
---
Sorry I mean L96
---
Not sure what they expected.  The weapons in the kit are best for quick 2 shot kills.  If you are playing to compete (Like most, it's a game after all) most people aim for body shots. Not to mention these minigame playlists always die within a few days or so.  Shame too, I'd love a wood grain BOSG.

They tried to address the audio bugs at one point when their effect on thermite and hibbana (they somehow didn't notice maverick) was causing problems but it seems what they did was a half measure at best and now they seem to have gone back to just ignoring that it is an issue.

Every ranked map that is not in Pro League is bad.

I have transitions on my glasses (30/80 vision with astigamtism) so I don't ever have to worry about the sunüåû
---
What do you mean it‚Äôs only defender sided if the attackers let it be?! That‚Äôs not how it works! It‚Äôs the 3rd worst balanced map in the game coming in right behind the very attack favoured chalet and skyscraper, and the 3rd floor is way too easy for the defenders to easily deny the attackers entry entirely. People don‚Äôt just complain about maps for no reason. If the vast majority of the community is not satisfied, as well as all pros saying it‚Äôs not competitive, and ubi deciding not to put it in proleauge, there is a reason for it! You may like the map because of the limited strats you can use on it, but your arguments are clearly opinion oriented and you are not looking at the facts.
---
Both maps are bad. Change my mind.
---
One laaaaaan
---
Hopefully they just put it in the shop for renown
---
Beautiful. Let‚Äôs start figuring out Ranked matchmaking now eh?
---
and the whole ass-qss thing to that subreddit was started by me, like the Claymore Cult subreddit
---
This took me a couple times before I even saw it. Wow

Well, I figured it out on like the 3d game on this map cause I jumped in trough the window and saw a wooden wall so I breached it.

"As of the 2.2 patch deployment to consoles this morning, the previous Clash, Claymore, Deployable Shield exploits should now be fully resolved across all platforms."-I feel like I've heard something like this before... I must be imagining things

Lol alright all hostility a side for a minute. I got this game in red crow. Played on and off. Went full tilt in wind bastion. Learned a lot. Now I am where I am. Do I have amazing aim? No. But my IQ has grown from a low gold player to a high plat player since January. I was trolling, psi Russia is someone I play with. My main account is Highliights. I'm the rank that i am because i know things not because I'm shroud and I have a good team. I play hard support and igl so I'm not running around fragging.
---
You can‚Äôt hack on Xbox One, you can cheat with MnK, DDOS, and abuse glitches. But there has been no documented cases of hacks on the One, because you can‚Äôt run unlicensed software on Xbox while online. 
---
If you have some proof, please post it.
---
If I were a betting man, I‚Äôm thinking you‚Äôre confusing glitch abusers and lucky prefires/wallbangs as hacks.
---
Joined on a 4 stack
---
The most similar looking thing it the phone lmao.
---
Did you get voted off?
---
Another thing that they should implement is the ability to get alpha packs for the event, not just the normal ones, when the event is active.
---
If it was for a show down pack it probably would have been done
---
It's just preference to the dev really. I mean this wont happen often enough to where it's a problem in my eyes and if someone is that close to a rank and mad they didnt hit it then idk what to say either.
---
Both top floor sites are viable on skyscraper tho?
---
The kitchen site also isn‚Äôt half bad if you can bring a mira
---
Oh lol
---
Wouldn't be a true siege clip if they weren't trying to vote kick you
---
Yea but over the long run your K/D is still the same somehow. At the start it was 1.3 and at the end it‚Äôs still 1.3
---
I don‚Äôt get why they couldn‚Äôt just keep both versions in the game
---
Too. Much. UTF8.
---
This is, why I really wish there would be a blacklist feature in the game.   
---
I wonder how long it would take for those people to reach +10 minutes for a single match of casual, because they are on the blacklists of 95% of the active players.

You could grow up and not use those words

You have to press it to hold it. Unless we're talking about half F presses
---
Come on, the map was a shitshow. Who ever got control of the one staircase won the round 9/10 times.
---
Ubisoft just nerfed Glaz's thermals for the specific purpose of getting rid of the aggressive Glaz play style. They want him to be a long range sniper, not an entry fragger. Giving him a select fire rifle completely goes against the dedicated sniper role.
---
There should be a lot of custom melee animations.
---
Make the baseball charm a skin for his impact nades and they‚Äôll be the richest company out there

HOLY SHIT!

the only way we could get to 6 mil headshots is if it was a cross console challenge (pc,xbox,ps)

What does he mean stressing the servers

You shouldn't have blured the name so we can report him.

*because he sucks as an operator and his gadget is more of a hindrance than a help most of the time*
---
It‚Äôs great cause people don‚Äôt watch for claymores anymore, I get so many easy kills with them now
---
classic
---
That's been there forever
---
Mute elite gang where are you?
---
I‚Äôm not sure why this is getting downvoted as much as it is. I think that‚Äôs worth talking about. I think the reason they don‚Äôt do it is that it creates asymmetry with the MMR; they can‚Äôt delete the game for the cheater‚Äôs team but not delete the game for the other team. But even that weren‚Äôt a limitation, games with cheaters can turn into toxic messes; honest people stuck with a blatant cheater will TK him, or abandon the match in disgust.
---
You wouldn't have even needed to tell me it was the MP7, I know my favorite gun when I see it
---
I just want it back in casual. It was such a fun map, it's casual so fuck competitive play.
---
I legit thought this was just a high resolution in game pic of fuze lol, looks good!
---
For real. It is however Ubisoft's responsibility to continue to make money in order to keep share holders happy, continue to produce new games, and pay their hundreds of employees who rely on that paycheck to support their families.  
---
If they make some pink goggles or cowboy chaps with a huge price tag for your favorite operator and you want it bad enough, that's not Ubisoft's fault, it's just meeting demand.
---
It's a luxury within a luxury product. If everyone got everything for free or cheap it wouldn't be special at all.
---
It's not very good to play vertical on. Hatches are in corners and e.g. in bathroom there is a wall covering the whole thing. Hatches in Hereford are 95% useless. I only see horizontal gameplay on that map.
---
It lacks points of orientation. The staircases are indistinguishable from each other. The entire first floor is never used.
---
Why is it your last one?
---
I'm used to getting attacked for literally no reason after playing clash for a while.
---

---
Why do i like this so much.....i want more
---
Look, to be frank here...
---
Base game, takes money.
---
Pay to win, is shitty and will kill the game/franchise/company
---
Pay to fad, is a good middle ground that (besides very few instances) allows players to support the game in exchange for goodies that have no to almost no tactical advantage.
---
it's so bad for me, I've given up playing :/
---
I gave in 1 headshot. No need to thank me
---
It happened to my friend today while playing ranked. I feel ypu fellow stranger.
---
r/softwaregore
---
It‚Äôs not something I plan on doing ever, put too much time into collecting seasonal skins to throw it all away. Like I still have the Rudolph skin haha.
---
It just makes me sad that legitimate players decide to cheat and risk throwing all that away. Those are the types of cheaters that bite off more than they can chew, thinking they‚Äôll be fine. Right after battleye hits them with a ban and they lose their Year 1 skins to the abyss. 
---
If for whatever reason you decide to cheat, don‚Äôt. Siege is a game that IMO allows so much opportunity for cheat inspired behavior like using drones to setup wallbangs, that it‚Äôs infinitely more satisfying to setup you‚Äôre own blind wallhacks just using your intel gathering alone. I used to joke on or around launch day that everyone had wallhacks because you can just find out where someone was without them knowing by just using the intern tools.
---
If I might add, another way to reduce hacking might to be offer an arcade feature to reduce the likelyhood a percentage of players will turn to hacks when they‚Äôre stressed out, not having fun, loosing game and game, and generally not doing well. If they have a breather and something to remind them how to have fun, they might toss the hacks altogether.
---
Yes.
---
Same here, contemplated grinding to Diamond, but this season was stressful enough getting into Plat'; one of the rockiest I've played yet.
---
That should have been fixed with this patch as well.
---
Google.  Google has a picture of the FMG-9 black ice...
---
Only top floor isn‚Äôt. Easy fix
---
Yes that would be lovely.
---
Third floor is pretty much unattackable. Everything relies either on stairs or very tight windows/doors where pixel angels can be held easily.
---
so you dont think vault is as close to a free win for defenders that you can get?
---
Like I said already I dont use slurs for the most part but I dont get offended when people say them to me
---
Really, grow up
---
Here, here.
---
yikes
---
Yay :)
---
I guess Ubi saw what their designers had made and realised they looked really good so more people would buy them.
---
TLDR giving more packs means those buying the whole set would see less value was what Ubi's marketing thought.
---
Whatever happened to those cosmetics from previous events anyway? I hardly see other players equip them.
---
"I wont hold that angle, someone else probably will"

Tachanka

I'm sorry if that is what you thought and that wasn't my intention.

Always leave on in the mag, for lmgs then lol

Oooh and your on console looks like that cheater gets off free

Bottom tier map
---
thats great, thx
---
Until it's your turn to play Maverick, then it's a ball.
---
At least your teammate did something. Too often these situations have one player on 20 kills and another on 2.
---
Maestro is great for zapping people.
---
I mean, you can take twitch drones with Mozzie so yeah.
---
I really hate these comparisons why would anyone buy ALL of the cosmetics at once? Do you have that little self-control? They're priced high yes....but they're not priced so that any sane person would buy them ALL. I can pick up one mcdouble even though McDonald's is willing to sell me a hundred. It would be nice if you could buy specific items though I agree with that but they really don't make too many really nice skins. You would have everyone running around with black ice and they would make 1/20th the money they're making now.
---
Geniunely curious, you don't like rolling your Ranked charms on your primaries? 
---
I generally do and a themed one for the secondary if allotted or certain characters I have a theme going on for their primary, but mainly I always put my most recent Rank on at the beginning of a Season.
---
Really? They look like they are chilling out at their vacation when their super secret Rainbow transponders were activated so they came from the Swiss alps. Just like IQ rushed over from her Yoga class.

Maestro for the zapping people.

Mozzie and Echo for droning.

Villa is my favorite map. I can understand not liking it but to say Bartlett is better is just... no.

I apologise for the initial downvote. I instinctively tried to as soon as I read his message.

I think a GRU ctu would be awesome, maybe that could have a vss?

He gets banned quite often. But most tines it is Echo and Caviera.
---
Did we get the skin anyway? I don't have any operators with that gun
---
Thank you! I haven't really been playing at all because its been ruining my experience TREMENDOUSLY.
---
It's pretty rediculose. You can place into diamond amd only be facing gold 3-4's lol. Like one of my buddy's recently started playing and hit level 30 last night. Got boosted up to plat 1. His placement match was against a team of silvets and he got 0 kills lol. Going to be a diamond after 3 more easy games. Literally a brand new player boosted by a plat 4 stack of coppers. It's broken... But it was fun seeing just how broken.
---
/Unexpected
---
Honestly instead of automatically selling your duplicates, Ubi should do something similar to Cs:Go. If they don't want that then why not a trading system between skins instead of money like CS?

No one noticed the mirror

Sorry to hear man; high Ranked matches have gotten so botched this season between carries, glitches, DDOS, etc. that I just gave up once I hit Plat' and taking my break until next Season.
---
Ah, but it is good
---
i hate you. unless you like the old one. if you do, PREACH. if not, i will hunt you down
---
Realism. The M1911, in real life, also hold only seven bullets.
---
Alright. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say is I think the challenge is unreasonable and maybe should be brought down another million and they should‚Äôve released it with the mode and I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. I never use the BOSG anyway. It would be worth it if it was a universal weapon skin.
---
It used to be hype, but now it's quit on spot
---
Never
---
Haha indeed, I still quite like it though
---
who gilded this?
---
Ok. YOU don't get offended. You aren't everyone in the siege community. People don't want to be insulted every game they play. The siege community was asking for chat filters for a long time and they did it. You're so stuck in your childish selfish thinking that you can't see past your own emotions. Seems you really need to grow up if you ask me.
---
Why your last?
---
what‚Äôs the skin for the MPX?
---
Well I got insta permabanned back in 2018 for my first ban sooo (apparently I said some bad shit in chat which is plausible)
