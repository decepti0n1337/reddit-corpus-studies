*chuckles* “I’m in danger”

On pc he would die immediately after showing one mm of his hat
---
Nice
---
where was this explanation given? definitely not in game, because I received no notifications about it.
---

---
regardless, if they take it from me, the refund should be given immediately.
---
I'm not talking about millimeters. I'm talking about this video. Full auto firing at point blank range, and it was like what the 48th, or 49th out of 51 that randomly clipped lesion in the head? Guns don't do that. Video game developers seem to think all guns behave like a shotgun. As in once it leaves the barrel, the bullets path mushrooms out. Which is ridiculous. The bullet will go dead straight from the direction the barrel was pointing when it was fired. 
---
Maverick looking like chef Boyardee
---
I’m turned on

Buy Maestro. As a Ela main myself I know how much she sucks to play. Her guns are pretty bad unless you use the shotgun which is her best weapon. Her Scorpion is manageable but the horizontal recoil is random and quite bullshit. Her gadget is sub par and her pistol is just standard. She out of any roamer is the worst roamer in the game most likely but I still love her... Sadly Ubisoft never will.
---
A I think ban is unnecessary, but this definitely should be fixed
---
I know. I hated it that I bought other headgear and uniform, but after they fixed it, I couldn’t do anything but equip it right away. It loons amazing now.
---
Copper six this isn't how it works fucking idiot

In my general experience, the high ranks do like to ruin casual. I’ve started going against higher ranks when I play casual (which is what I mainly play because of how try-hard ranked is) and I will get runouts on spawnpeeks done to me against plats &amp; high golds. Not saying all high levels do casual to destroy low-levels, it just feels like they go way too toxic to “warmup” (my first match as a lvl 80 a lvl 300 plat 3 jumped out a window in casual and now I don’t like high ranks anymore)
---
No. There is a reason that Rook is picked a lot thanks to the added benefit of the armour. The fact that only go into DBNO with armour equipped and the fact that the one extra bullet you can catch can go a long way. This idea adding on that is pushing it, and Rook isn’t in need of a buff anyway.
---
You could not be rude JV.
---
But that elo though
---
Its for scale
---
Why does this subreddit circlejerk over black ice skins? They look pretty mediocre at best.
---
Mute
---
Aside from the face that article 5 is available in the hunt, and the fact I hate it, it's ment to introduce the player to the multiplayer aspect of the game
---
And for most of the clip the barrel is bouncing around and either to the left or right of Lesion, so there you go, your wish has been granted
---
Glacier is way harder to get. To get Black Ice all you need to do is to have enough luck. Glacier is only for R6 credits if I remember correctly.
---
They might just have a show network connection. It's not right to ban someone for having a slow network connection.
---
Ubi have been told plenty of times about the no abandonment bug, but they're choosing to ignore it. 
---
I mean Mute can also get some hatches like laundry room on Oregon and completely cover garage door on Chalet with one jammer as opposed to two batteries AND doesn’t destroy every team gadget on the wall/in the barbed wire
---
im indebted to the devs for making the newcomer playlist. having only 3 maps to learn is a godsend. I hope the game lives on for many more years!
---
I have that too. Switching to windowed and back to fullscreen is a temporary fix.
---
When peepee not standing. That’s ruler for
---
Does anyone know what causes this stuttering in the menus? It happens every game and the only way to fix it seems to be changing in and out of full-screen.
---
Last time I posted a drop from alpha packs it got removed so fast
---
The Toy weapon skin 
---
lmao
---
That's outrageous, it's unfair!
---
That just seams that you accidentally pressed a the swap button twice because that never happens to me
---
_what?!_
---
Stealing a kill isn’t that serious that you have to make someone sit out of the game for 2 rounds. 
---
I had it for one day only after i overclocked my monitor , i just restarted UPLAY and rainbow and it seemed to work out fine . I haven’t had it come back ever since . 
---
Lmao you straight stole this from r/shittyrainbow6 how low can you even sink. u/tchankauniversity
---
I thought maybe bronze idk. But yeah they're aiming with movement so it's console.
---
No auto-reload on BB when his shield is attached
---
My stress level increased once I saw smoke. 
---
Lmao
---
But your breaching charged and flash bangs don’t have black ice!
---
Thank you so much! I can’t wait to set it 
---
Everyone knows the one who doesn’t pick recruit dies from a friendly accident 
---
The problem is you conplained. I am saying i couldnt use the ruler, whoch is not complaining about the contents. I learne dthat the hard way to. If you dont word it like complaining, its fine
---
Rigged 
---
Good enough
---
Acog on defense with spawnpeeking was broken, but thanks for your mature response anyway. Everyone has opinions. My opinion is that ash has always been broken. Downvoting will not change my opinion. Thanks anyway. I just feel that people find ops like blitz and mozzie broken but the most picked op in the game is not. I also feel like saying ops like Ash have “never been broken” is detrimental to the balancing of the game. Thank you!
---
wins and how good the other team is (their elo)
---
Yeah shotguns are like balloons against bombers in R6 siege.
---
Yeah, the AK is objectively the best gun in the game.
---
Earthquaaaaaaaaake 
---
Why is it always a Zofia main to ruin all recruits or all elite skin teams 
---
Yh, still could be ping abusers
---
This happens to everyone it fixes by itself
---
Just a bug where the game doesn't load so you're left sitting there, and they both don't want to leave in case they go down a rank
---
Yeah I agree it’s bad. 
---
So, who gets upset about it? The other team?
---
Just be blind lmao
---
Conga motherfucker!
---
I’m level 141 and have black ice for g36c and ump45
---
How do i get that? Still available?
---
Leaving this comment so I can come back later. 
---
r/substhatkeepsgettingbetterandbetter
---
Random firing 
---
He wasn't expecting that either.
---
Glacier was only available in y1s1 for a very extremely short time. It is literally the rarest skin in the game by far, so it's actually way more impressive to see Glacier.
---
WAIT WTF IS THAT RATIO AND RESOLUTION!?!
---
What you said is 100% accurate omg
---
Silver. YIKES
---
What was ubis justification for taking off the acog? Just cause it was too op? I don’t understand really
---
*jesus christ*
---
Thats just plain not true lol
---
new hereford is fifteen times more balanced
---
Except Acog encourages you to hold angles, whereas the 1x sights are easier to rush with.
---
Luck
---
Well ya 
---
You can play it as a squad because no one ques it and if you que at the same time as your squad you're likely to get in the same game. I've done it with my friend multiple times.
---
there is so much wrong with this picture
---
Still one tap her in a spawnpeek ty 3 speed ash
---
I was expecting spicier plays.
---
This is good jerky

i was expecting the shield to fly into you and kill you

The oofinator 9000.
---
I think he gets it though.

You guys do know you can shoot and ADS at the same time right.
---
*oof 100*
---
One of the main reasons I’ve stopped playing this game completely it might have one of the most toxic player base 
---
I like to remind people about screenshots once in a while... 
---
Shucks, I was literally about to get alibi lol
---
Well no, the replay is featuring a bug, it doesn't look like that in game. People seeing you when you can't see them is actually how it SHOULD work and how it works in every first person game ever.
---
You look genuinely intimidating 
---
If you're 444 then I'm 555. And if you're 555 then I'm....
---
That's where you wrong buddy. Her lmg is very powerful 
---
Why does this exist?
---
This video is showing a killcam bug, it doesn't look that way in reality the opponent sees the side of his head because he's too close to the angle and his opponent is far from the same angle. It's working as intended outside of the replay's error.
---
PC or mobile? Mobile if you go to the homepage of rainbow 6 reddit there should be three dots, you need to click that and press change community flair. PC, you have to go to the rainbow6 reddit homepage thing, and in the community details tab, there should be subscribed and stuff, in the same box, just underneath there should be flair or whatever, click on that.

Yes sir, screeneecording f-Ed up
---
Deal with this every week. Some idiot in casual will first try to vote kick the lower level guys like me (lvl88) and usually nobody votes yes. That guy then teamkills as Soon as the match start. I stay though so I can get revenge and tbag their body.  I don't understand this though,if they want to be teamed with high lvl players ,why not play ranked. It's casual for a reason.

Will do. Just out of curiosity what is your favorite defender? I seem to have trouble finding an enjoyable one

Done

Start playing ranked or play more. You are with the dumb dumbs.

That’s a rip

They do it on purpose, just lag their connection.  I've let my PC go for 4 hours.  Went to the store, got food, got a pizza, came back and then watched a movie.  The person left, I was last and got the ELO and win.
---
I was recording but the recording failed... :/
---
Its a joke I’m just trying to point out that there are (obviously) a lot more cheater on pc than there is mnk users on console.
---
nah she should 
---
If you didn't start a vote to kick poll after this, you are not a true siege player /s
---
Da fwick!?!
---
I'd say Maestro because 
---
1. He's easy to pick up and is really fun 
---
2. He has a great set of weapons
---
3. He is one **Thicc ass boi dayumn**
---
not richmond but the bay lmao
---
This post makes
---
I have to do this now
---
funny cause this the type of thing low levels do, you almost never see level 200+ players being toxic like that cause they actually care about the game and the community. this is just so frustrating i feel ya homie.
---
I wish it was that easy, but sadly there’s no lean in Vegas 2. Instead it’s cover based but you have to hold the button to stay in cover and use the movement keys to peak. Thanks for the help though
---
Or alternatively, you shouldn’t give a damn about kills 
---
Why would you care 
---
He’s not OP... he’s AIDS
---
This^^^
---
Um perhaps using a controller could work I know my brother played this very often and cover based games like gears of war are made for controller 
---
Why is it so slow? Does gfycat do that normally?
---
Ban them
---
I wouldn't say that nobody knows of it, it's been a meme cannon for the longest time. 
---
same its locked since december i contacted support they say they cant do anything lmao ubisoft support best support
---
Dude that's low
---
If your team is that dumb u should die
---
Nah outback is one of the best maps 
---
Maestro is the definition of "Beefed up". ACOG + laser LMG + two gadget that can be used as anchor. Could be nerfed at some point IMO.
---
Maverick you will have access to the most ironic firearms in the real world, and a blow torch that allows you to silently take out enemies.
---
Nomad is not a great fragger but could be quite hairy for the enemies post plant situation.
---
Kaid is when you want to experience using a DMR as a defender because his SMG sux, his gadget is not fun at all, just a thing you throw at the wall or ceiling in the beginning of the round, no tricks whatsoever.
---
And I’m Billy Mayes
---
Agree, just a tip, his charges are actually very consistent and follow a very strict pattern! But I agree with everything else. His charges go from right to left pretty sure. I believe Macie Jay made a video about it? Can’t remember
---
Strongly disagree
---
Sadly no
---
Yes. 5
---
Yea I’m 160 on my pc so usually everyone is acting cool but being a level 20 on console is just infuriating 
---
Kills are not very important but you have to admit that it is kinda annoying when you are about to shoot the person you downed and then your teammate shoots them 
---
That looks really good, your girl is talented.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I love a match of secure area on Commander’s Office. That’s the name of this map right? /s
---
Are his glasses under his ears?
---
Ok, but what are your reasons, there's no point if you don't have any reason to.
---
Is it the design, the objectives, the looks, the feel..? 
---
I think a well thought out, opinionated argument would help me understand why you don't like this map. 
---
that's why I'm using it to make sure everyone knows of this meme cannon ;p  
---
  
---
.  
---
~~now if it only had ACOG like Kaid....~~
---
Well they did implement a new leaning mechanic if you didn’t know as well. Basically there is times you can be leaning holding an angle with your head sticking out far more than it used to be and you won’t even see an opponent. 
---
What a good girlfriend, I’m jealous
---
Good point, A change is good, but a good one.
---
I have been in plat since Blood Orchid. Plat 3 atm this season, 3 last season, 2 before that, and 1 before that. The reason my rank is getting lower is because I stopped playing for a while ( Plat 3 this season and last season due to lack of gameplay)
---
Whats that ?
---
What's IMF? 
---
I like her old face
---
I literally Just watched anime, and my friends did other things, then someone would me like "Were in game" (something like that) and we all alt tab back.  
---
(except a few times we alt tab in just so we dont get kicked for afk in menu because that has happen before)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I do believe they do it on purpose because he wouldn't leave and probably expected us leave
---
Your laugh made me laugh and I always say “A laugh that makes others laugh is the perfect laugh!”
---
Nope, it wont be nicer. For starter you already have more point for getting kill steal that way.
---
Not to mention it's not like you can frag them right away after downing them. So if you cant get there in time for your precious kill it's your fault.
---
Not to mention various factors that including in the game.
---
People will just being toxic if they want.
---
This is not an alibi drawing, its a fucked up spider with a ballsack.
---
yeah but female gamers can never be as good as male ones.
---
Blitz v Roamer would be more accurate 
---
Lol that's some committment
---
It is not like it is going to get changed to get changed or anything so you don’t have to worry about it is was just an idea 
---
That would take to long

The wallhacks are real

Wanna play Ranked sometime? (If not I understand) I've been high Plat 1 In Para bellum and Grim sky and Wind Bastion was tough cause I played other games so I was Plat III and This season I'm Gold I cause we weren't as great as we once we're cause we all stopped playing for a bit. But I am starting to get back into siege so ( conjon17 if you wanna play sometime)
---
Macaroni if i might add
---
How do u find matches in newcomer? I was in queue for 1 min and just left after that
---
When its 2 am and you try not to wake anyone
---
Barb wire is supposed to be a non trivial impediment though.
---
its the replay happened to me too 
---
Yea absolutely! I’m a bit rusty atm as well so I completely understand. I only play on Fridays and weekends but I’ll add you tomorrow. My gamer tag is toyo0821
---
Well my idea is just keep thing as it is. And fix things that actually matter. Like the toxicity.
---
Have a nice day :)
---
Thanks!
---
If they fix the spawn peeks it would be amazing but right now its only decent.
---
Polish Resistance / Warsaw Uprising probably
---
Maybe even a martial arts themed skin
---
I don’t see a problem here
---
It’s a reference to the SAS motto “Who Dares, Wins.”

[Oh shit] (https://youtu.be/jOzBhuTEBT0)

That's the sanest thing you could have said
---
You? i mean maybe it is because i dont have enough money for an actual gaming pc and headphones etc.
---
I'm unranked while going against all golds.
---
You still have an mmr while unranked so it’ll still put you in different lobbies depending on your skill
---
Also, u/UbiNoty Mute's Gravel Blast bundle is not appearing on the seige shop (ps4)
---
logically that makes no sense. imma be honest. if your teammate downs someone, and is finished, the kill should go to the player who downed them. if your teammate downs them, and they are picked up again, and then you down them. obviously the person who downed them last should get the kill. whether or not your dead shouldn't matter. because if you down someone, then die, and they bleed out, you still get the kill
---
Im thinking along the lines of the motion detector from the battlefield series, so it only pings if you move around. I think its too strong if it always pings whether you are stationary or not
---
I think its a good idea if theres some way of knowing you are near one before triggering it and maybe they only get 1 to 2 or mybe 3 devices.
---
I like the thought that maybe they get placed close to default plant spots as an echo/maestro alternative
---
I really like the elite too
---
Hello everyone, don't mind me, I'm just waiting for that Danish attacker who has Cav feet to be confirmed. He'll 100% be my new main. Bye-bye Maverick. We had a good run.
---
Nice! The art style reminds me of hotline Miami for some reason!
---
Yeah dude there is no issue here
---
funnily enough, she's actually a huge fan of hotline Miami as well!
---
Ok I see it
---
You don’t care but a lot of other people do. I always have to take at least a second to think about killing a downed guy, because I don’t want someone to get angry about stealing their kill.

---
There is no such thing as a kill steal. If you need to reload after a DBNO then you're exposed, be thankful your teammate finished the job for you. It's a TEAM game.
---
I came from CS GO as well.
---
The playstyle and the operator basis of the game suits me very well. Not to mention the non linear 3D gameplay
---
Can relate 
---
I got lucky on my second attempt and loaded in within 30 seconds.

Don't exactly know any level requirements but if you need someone to run with hit me at 
---
Nama_Jeff on ubi
---
I generally would take kix's word, given how much knowledge he actually has, but that does sound a bit controversial:
---
1- pengu still complains about it, and even shows on his stream and YT how high ping is dying before you can see the enemy
---
2- how did Ubi fix it? They never told us how the countered it.
---
https://downdetector.com/status/rainbow-six
---
Servers, you mean?
---
No, I mean in higher tier ranks the enemies also know most of the strats and are ready for them with just better gun skills.
---
Yes, please
---
Suggest using FlamePeppee's link.
---
thank you i added you we can play sometime tomorrow 
---
Kaid's outfit looks nice, Maverick on the other hand...
---
It was silver you fucking Ying.
---
Overreacting.
---
A mix of the three would be legendary. Open world third/first person tactical looter shooter.
---
which means you either train your aim to get on their aim level or improve your strat knowledge to think up newer strats and outsmart/surprise them.
---
The higher ELO you climb the better aim and strat knowledge your oponents will have. But just raw aim itself just can't get you anywhere. Shroud is a good example of that.
---
ddos
---
Oh I know how you feel. I started playing around Christmas. Played 12 hours on my first day. Some fucker teamkilled me because I shot his Yokai on accident. Ran into that fucker again a couple months later, and I was higher level with a better ranked kd than him. 
---
I've realised that people who've been playing for longer are a lot less toxic because they realise that even the most retarded of players is better that a 4v5, and that one guy can give you rook plates, and as you said, thernite breaches. 
---
Play ranked. Play ranked because even at the lower elos people want to learn the game. They know not to reinforce the wall you opened, or the wall next to where you want to Mira. I played in Copper 4 for 2 whole fucking months, and thia season I'm Gold 3. I have never been Silver, though I might be pretty soon.
---
Keep learning the game. And watch VarsityGaming. That dude knows what's up.
---
I dont know man, whenever I try japanese servers it doesnt work out for me.
---
**JOIN THE CAKE DAY** (you are welcome)
---
I understand, I wasn't trying to be a burden. Any way you know I can transfer my game? I've heard of people doing it before but Ubisoft support isn't any help for me right now for some reason.
---
why is this flaired as "news"?
---
Now this is a joke.
---
The other one, is not.
---
Just a casual day of ash main 
---
Its still very much an issue. They say its a disadvantage now but thats not true at all. I can remember at least 10 times i got domed before seeing anything
---
I found a way to join friends if anyone have the problem where everyone shows as oflline invite them to a group and invite the whole group. 
---
Yeah he looks like my uncle.
---
In the higher ranks, peolle expect valk cams, so that's harder to do. But in the lower ranks, you could do that Runout on Skyscraper and people won't know how you guessed. Watch cam placements on youtube.

Nope both teams win or lose elo. It’s like the game never happened

Rook is already OP in terms of body damage resistance, dbno time and dbno chance. i dont think he needs a buff

Try find yourself a team to play with, and make rough plans before a round on who’s doing what

I didn't start playing until Wind Bastion, meaning I had no idea Chimera even existed until it was way too late to play it :((((

And from what I know about barbed wire in Siege, it is not supposed to be a serious time waster by itself. It's main purpose is to notify defenders and slow down rushers. Kind of cheap alternative to Lesion mines.

I will take your advice to heart and get to rank asap.

you try restarting game? restarting computer? trying a new mouse? reinstalling the game?
---
You’re right, but that’s not going to be their priority because I think they would expect a level of maturity from their player base, most people are pretty chill about it. But also to add on to it being a team game, someone told me ages ago that when someone “steals your kill” they could be saving your life by doing so. That downed person could’ve gotten doc’d, finka’d, or simply given accurate call outs quickly and continue to give callouts until they die that gets the person that downed them killed. Just finish them ASAP unless it’s for a purpose (interrogation/bait) but call that out to your teammate ASAP.
---
OHHH SHIIEETT
---
Had my reasons back then. I don't know about upvotes since I'm pretty new to reddit. But you can search the original post on google as it's still cached and look at the username if you don't believe me.
---
I disagree. That's the equivalent of saying that if you did the most damage to an enemy, and then a teammate did one last shot that finished them off, then you should get the kill. No. This is a team game, and kill count shouldn't mean anything as long as you're contributing to part of the team.
---
People are too desperate to have a high kill count on their scores, and it's that same mentality that ruins games. 
---
Why not? Finka rush is one of the most fun things I've done in this game. 
---
This is something that I always tell my squad when I frag out, when I get a 3k or. 4K and they say go for the ace I get real pissed. No Alex, we aren’t going to let them everyone else on the team just stand in front of the last dude to get gun downed and have the Zofia pull off a withstand clutch because you thought that my ego needed to be stroked that hard.

Hello Fr34k_10, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b63dqp/shields_in_this_game_are_fundamentally_broken_and/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

---
Why don’t you do it?
---
Personally, I've seen very little toxicity but I'm on (PC) West EU. East NA was a very very different story, no shortage of idiots running their mouths and trying to upset the team.
---
Don't let it get to you though, I always try keep a joyful and stable game, because after-all its just a game and we are here to have fun, and we have a report button.
---
Don’t buy Blackbeard. His shit was nerfed to the floor, vigil and echo are good picks, vigil is probably one of the best roomers in the game and is great for  a 1v1, same thing goes for echo, he’s great in 1v1 and depending on how you choose to play him he can be great just sitting in the obj or roaming. Lesion is okay he’s really who you go if you want a lot of points or like using a low recoil gun or shotgun. If you are gonna get an offensive operator get Finka, Hibana, Maverick, or Jackal. Those are the best offensive operators. Finka is great because her ability lowers the recoil of everyone on you team, and I’m pretty sure it makes them faster too, so it’s not just a health boost. Hibana is good because if there is someone camping in a corner you can expose them without getting close. Maverick is good because he’s almost silent when torching and is great for sneaking up on people. Lastly Jackal is good because if his huge advantages in 1v1 situations due to his tracking ability, and he’s just great for helping you not get flanked. 
---
Thanks for the information. Since ubi patched something in Siege, So in other games most likely high ping players have an advantage? 
---
I still can’t wrap my head around the concept, must be technical i guess. Back in the day, i would play counterstrike 1.6 from home, but i’d join the server of a nearby pc cafe. My ping would be about 50ish. Whereas my friends who would be at the pc cafe on the same server would have about 10 ping. They definitely had the advantage as against me, their shots hit me faster, and when I’d duck behind cover or scramble around a corner, i would often die a second later.
---
So that’s why I asked about the high ping issue.
---
*Delete this*
---
My boy, what are you talking about. Rook is a default operator and Buck is not great. 
---
&gt;Smurfers have been solved with team balance like I already mentioned. Most servers have it enabled. Within 5 or 10 rounds, the team gets an auto balance and the problem is fixed. Of course, you can't do that in Siege since there's a max of 5 rounds in casual but that could always extended. 
---
I'm done. You must be trolling, there is no other explanation how you can even think of suggesting 'team balancing' in the middle of the match by shuffling players around...
---
Check response above
---
It's the actual OP he deleted the old post
---
#2THE LAMB SAUCE!!!!
---
yes
---
Hehe, Alvin Yakitori. I know where that's from :)
---
Yeah a block function would be nice.
---
It's capitao 
---
agreed
---
Thanks homie
---
Idk looks like Nazi propaganda to me...🇩🇪
---
Yeah I guess so lol
---
1.oh, you meant chat itself. I thought text in chat, like font. Yeah chat can be better
---
6. agreed, me and my friend exiting to menu too. Leader change option - i can see why it may be necessary sometimes.
---
7. Shields are Merphy's laws embodiment right now: if you play one - most probably you will be shoot right though it, if you play against one - it's like invisible mini shields are covering all that little of his body that aren't protected already.
---
8. Well reworks is quite laborious i imagine. You need to fix flows, not make new ones in process, test it, if results are sad - do whole cycle all over again. 
---
Also, Epi (community developer) said in interview that new op creation process takes like 9 month. What it means - they plan way ahead. Probably other maps are getting early rework concepts right now. 
---
Also also - House was stated too canonical and unfixable so they don't plan to rework it bc it will be whole new map after that. Yacht and Plane - something similar. That's why it stays in Casual - better than nothing by their logic. 
---
18. that's overly complicated =)) Question: can you invite non-friends to lobby? Like, you open "friend suggestions" in Uplay overlay and invite randoms? If not - maybe it's lobby system that cause all that. (i know that your friend can invite his friend that maybe not your friend, but non-direct friend\_relationship\_chain still exist)
---
19. flashbang will blind you no matter where you looking if it within 3 (or so) meters of you. same as Blitz shield. BUT i find out that cases when you get blinded across the map happen from time to time, so i guess complaint legit, congratulations =))
---
21. Levitating drones are funny
---
23. Just wanted to clarify =) Still, could be worse if enemies could get kill points for TK lmao
---
25. ReaListiC PhYSic
---
28. i got you point
---
29. In Cav case, she changes her state ( crouches slightly ) therefore transfer animation from one state to another must happen. Maybe they don't create specific translation animation from leaning state to leaning state. In Vigil case - no idea, but probably something similar
---
P.S.
---
Wow productive discussion on Siege SubReddit, am i dreaming?? 
---
=))
---
Avoid as *teammate* 
---
So you can avoid toxic fucks on your team like the Mira who teamkills you because you reinforced a wall she didn't like when she didn't communicate at all where she was putting her Black Mirrors
---
Not "avoid this person in my matches" which you could use to avoid playing against really good players
---
This is something Overwatch has that is a great quality of life improvement, you only get 3 slots to avoid and it lasts for 7 days, if you want to avoid someone else you have to remove someone currently on your avoid list, to prevent tooany matchmaking issues
---
Is Cav Rorschach IRL?
---
This was my first thought but I've seen it ripping walls and the same blood you'd get from buckshot. Also seen it ripping up close like a normal semi auto shotty. 
---
Ohh ok, yah I’m being dumb, it’s a good idea 
---
Well. Now toxic people don’t have to chose to be a toxic vigil main or a toxic cav main so I guess that’s a plus
---
All the comments concerning the buttox have been deleted I see...
---
I like that this sub is very active, but at the same time it is *too* active as nearly every topic on this sub gets reposted several times a day.
---
Well I knew it. I just expressed myself. I was not sure whether to buy the pass before. 
---
Only to avoid them as a teammate, wouldn't stop good players  (or toxic ones) from being on the other team
---
When the drone is a better shield than your actual shield.
---
It’s one of my personal favorites for the AR-33, but people always feel me it is terrible

---
Who tf uses the AR-33? The only reason anyone would use it is because sledge doesn’t have it and thats a *fact*
---
The map is solid, I hate it aesthetically and the compressor room site is atrocious to defend. Other than that the map has a really good flow and plays well. 
---
Just curious what makes a toxic vigil or cav main? Not trying to be facetious, legitimately curious.
---
Oh god oh fuck is that still an issue? Thought they fixed it. Haven’t happened to me in a while. Did you try restarting the game?
---
Thank you, someone who is educated.
---
no u
---
r/whoooosh 'ed
---
It really is annoying to play on.  I have to play shields because the terrorists always see me before I see them
---
Before Blitz was buffed it wasn’t a huge deal. It used to be way too easy to melee shields and kill them. The counter melee was Blitz’s only way for defending himself and he was next to useless. Blitz used to be the Tachanka of defense. 
---
Now though, it’s the exact opposite. No one can defend theirselves against Blitz’s melee attack. He went from way too easy to counter to way too hard to counter. I kind of wish they’d take his counter melee away since he’s the only 2 speed shield.  
---
Well if you win a gun fight with either of them, they will either quit or flaunt that this is their alt and that they are beaolo on their main. Also they usually teamkill before like round 3
---
I'm gonna be honest with you, it's because your demographic is really annoying. I'm not saying you are but young kids are the demographic that will screech useless shit on mics, or blast music on their mics or generally be really unhelpful. Like for example, I had a kid start fucking wailing after he got downed trying to roam and no one went to pick him up. No one cares to hear that.  Now most people I know will tear those aforementioned players apart. If you're giving legitimate callouts and not dicking around, a lot less people would care about your voice. 
---
Bish please, women complain in articles about the things men experience daily. Screaming idiots, harsh flaming, bullying, name calling, death threats. Men experience and live with that everyday, and women can't? Now that's sexist
---
I have one for twitches f2 and iqs aug one good gun one bad one lol
---
A really long time, well eventually they have to cycle back around, after all if four are released a season and 2 operators are made a season it should loop at some point
---
*There drones my hero, watch him has he drones*

Thanks, glad to hear it!

Entering the building early definitely can feel like a bad idea but if you enter with your team or at least a few teammates and gradually take control of the building it’s effective
---
both. and I hate playing shields. I don't need to get another shield op to be auto selected. I don't like the design or concept of her. I think the gameplay and strategy would be better when a full sized deployable shield. And don't get me started on the stun lock. Stun lock is the stupid thing.
---
Nah it’ll probably be tomorrow (Thursday) as that’s when most of sieges patches/Updates get released 
---
Got the same mobo eyy.
---
Did you do the same as me and give up putting in the top left screw because of the IO being so bulky on the back? 
---
Even with an acog, the recoil on the type-89 is quite controllable, but maybe I'm just used to high recoil guns because I play so much Twitch
---
Try restarting Uplay
---
plot twist: *he only has the shield to intimidate opponents. bullets will go through it.*
---
Watch other streamers those guys aren't worth your time
---
We both have restarted it twice, ended it in task manager and force quit it in the application nothing has changed 
---
Joke already made
---
More or less. How Long will it take for this bug to be fixed? If not so will we be compensated back for them?
---
 
---
You do get credited with an assist. Because that persons still alive. And that person can be helped up. Their still a threat and even if they don’t get picked up they can feed their team into the whole time. There’s no reason downing someone should count as a kill.
---
For me it's not really the vertical recoil but the horizontal recoil and how jumpy it is
---
I managed to get them all in but I've got some long and thin screwdrivers for the job. There's definitely sacrifices running micro atx. 
---
You can see it on deathcam as well. 
---
He literally said "us" sooooooo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The guy may have been pretty blunt in response, but he does have a point. All I've gone for here is some added character that's got meaning in the group I play with, The Lion character has an IRL Lion's head tattoo, the Wolf character's parents literally gave him the middle name "Wolf", the Shibe has had [a Shibe wearing a french hat as his profile picture for who knows how long](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/f5/4a/c8f54a966c1117ab3e81e2ee1194506d.jpg) and I just love Umbreon, Pokemon in general really.

---
* Alpharius liked that *

NlGGA WHAT 
---
That's why I use comp+vert grip on the type 89, really helps smooth out the recoil, same with Fuze's AK12, although that one is still hard with an ACOG
---
Just set your profile open in the settings tab. You can join him without a invite
---
Fair enough lol
---
Can anyone explain to me why coon is one of the banable words?
---
Impressive, but not godly. That's a flick of a competent fps player. Faster would be super human, slower would be closer to average. So yeah. Above average. 
---
I find fuzes gun easier then the type-89
---
Racial slur.
---
Why do it yourself when a robot can do it better? 
---
I don't mean characters I mean the role. I'm not saying I'll take a Monty every round over a Buck. I mean that I would take someone who takes teamwork seriously any day over someone who only cares about their K/D. I've seen people in 1v5 scenarios not contesting Obj and staying in a corner because the risk of dying without any kills and affect their K/D was more important than winning a round. That type of mentality, someone who will be silent up until he has 9 kills and his teammates are having a hard time and the only reason he starts talking is to give them shit instead of trying to make plays since round 1. Those type of players will stay in silver/gold forever because they'll never be able to carry their way to plat, you need to enable teammates to make plays to get there. Supports are people that even in death will make callouts, monitor all cams and relay any information they have. Heck even spectating players and telling them where the sound is coming from if they got shit headphones. Those are the type of players that are going to enable teammates to get more kills and make better plays.

I am not talking about her type 89. The bearing 9.  In both cases, the idea is the same in control.

Hey man, as someone working on a history degree atm, I thought your joke was funny.
---
yeah your are alright
---
If anyone manages to recreate this I don't even know.
---
You can't just say something like that then not give us your channel! I'd watch it!
---
As someone with a history degree I was rather pleased with myself. Best of luck to you with yours
---
Hahaha
---
Mr president get down
---
That’s true, I didn’t assume to look twice 
---
*holywoo 
---
So you played only one game and concluded that
---
I wonder what would happen if they had a Nomad Bandit away everytime he tried to bandit-trick.
---
Lol flex lvl 284 plat 3 Jager pro league uniform and invitational charm with Jager elite p12 camo 
---
I thought it originated from the press f to pay respects thing 
---
Yeah those are probably the type of people to eat the peanut with the shell.
---
Bugsbunny level of mind tricks.
---
Really? I solo queued when I got to plat, has the game just deteriorated? I guess I've never been this low ranked, was always silver +, this is just aids. 
---
No, technically this is my third or fourth game. I played it a little last year and the same thing happened. Was curious to see it was gonna happen again, which it did  
---
Better love story than twilight
---
I feel like I've been seeing it a lot when people shoot at hibana and somehow dont get the kill
---
Did someone get his pass?
---
He’s not wrong 
---
This is why if your trolling dont take your eyes off the downed opponent
---
I was just thinking the same. Would help with the learning curve seeing where strats went right/wrong.
---
V O I D  Cav
---
stop reposting this
---
Oh, I just dislike the in-game one and preferred this.
---
I don’t remember what this is from but, I remember it being so funny my friend shot milk out his nose🤣
---
I hate when this stupid shit happens.
---
Also does anyone know what weapon skin that mav has?
---
Ela and ying 
---
Avg age of the playerbase on consoles...
---
Nitro incell
---
Pretty much, it’s really bad Silver and below. Mainly throwers and smurfs down there.
---
Is that Rocket League?
---
Wasn't it a problem like a year ago that everybody was being banned due to their shitty chat filter?
---
Regardless this image is probably years old and is a garbage joke, because... you'd have to be pretty fucking dumb to fall for it. 
---
Esports ready 
---
I was so hoping for a member of Scotland Yard ctu. Then maybe we’d have someone with modern equipment for the Brits. 
---
GET DOWN MISTER PREDIDENT
---
Silver II is basically "decent players that don't communicate enough and sometimes Mira the wrong walls."
---
Nigga means like a friend or someone you know. Its no where near to saying nigger
---
GET DOWN MR BLITZ
---
It’s ~probably~ Ying’s Candela, the start of the sound was identical
---
If you play blitz it is very easy to melee a bomber
---
It's la Candela.
---
Oh, thanks, was looking for that damn \ everywhere.
---
I was about to call you out for stealing this from a guy on Instagram and then I saw your link, kinda saved Myself that embarrassment
---
That’s really cool. I didn’t ever realize the cosmetics playing a role in the game. I’ll take that into consideration.
---
rocket league
---
Looks like a pissed off nietzche 
---
ziptie a yellow dishrag onto the suppressor
---
We have all had those day brother, we have all had those days..
---
You mean last season? 
---
Oh no, he's on a rufle he's going to fall!
---
Fuze. He has way better guns and ying's ability can just stun the enemy and still have to run in while fuze can displace their entire defence
---
Fuck up cunt
---
Operation Burt Reynolds.
---
I wemt to australia.... It doesnt exist
---
Doesnt look like the flash was on him. Feels like it was on the shelf left of the door 
---
Yep looks cool
---
That resistor has 2 bands....
---
cant find it s resistance,can you please tell it 2 me or you randomly colored it?
---
(And yes it is nice work but i wanna know it s resistance beacuse yes)
---
Alleyoop!
---
Guns tend to be a matter of preference, since they all kill in one hit on a headshot. In terms of gadget Ying is just far more useful. 
---
I do prefer Fuze's guns compared to Ying's, though. 
---
he has stats like me, but is 5 ranks and 430 levels higher. 
---
Dokk &amp; mute currently
---
Yep once I was at 9999 but never more
---
As a GOLD V - SILVER II player I can safely say that 
---
- everyone has potato moments, happens in every rank
---
- 99% knows how and when to lean
---
- 90% knows basic or more advanced strategies
---
- most have good or even excellent accuracy
---
- in most games there are at least 1-3 players talking
---
- mira mirrors are sometimes put in stupid places
---
- no one thermite charges wooden barricades
---
- deranking is real
---
- toxicity is real
---
How does this even happen? This game is entering its 4th year and I’ve just now come to find out drones can actually hit c4’s. This is just one of those rare moments I love siege for
---
Dont think I dont see them yeezy boots 👀👀
---
You say that but when you’re trying to squad up with people saying “Your kd sucks!!!1!1!!!” it matters
---
"Play what?\`Is that what the kids do nowadays? When I was 25 I was working my ass off in a parisienne kitchen 18 hours a day, not play games on the computer. These dainty little flowers don't know what hard work is"
---
Aim and being actually bad at controlling recoil are two different things but whatever you say, mister.
---
Is that legal?

Welcome to a typical Middle Eastern Gamer’s life... even with good internet shit still horrible because of the server being far from ME
---
Best way to counter glaz in smoke is to just shoot 
---
A lot of OGs have it on because you used to be able to hear enemy in game call outs like “Reloading” so it would be more noticeable with words 
---
Why do hibanas never shoot directly below the window?  It blows the windows and makes a vaultable hole with one charge
---
Ok wtf
---
I hate to say it, and I don’t necessarily mean to be rude about it.. but she’s just the basic female character lol. She’s “Attractive”, not very difficult to put together, and she’s one of the most known operators in the game. 
---
Yoo r u like ram3dda on insta, sickkk i follow u there
---
Rochester MN? And why health why not white noise
---
a lot of these seem out of order to me because i fit a lot of them sometimes
---
also i rarely see diamonds recruit rush on cas
---
How did you get it?
---
Zofia has great guns, a useful ability, and overall i think she's pretty balanced. Hibana for me though, however i think her gadget is mighty useful her guns are a mixed bag. The type 89 is ok in my opinion and the supernova is kinda garbage if the barrel isn't inside their nose. As for Mute great team helping gadget, good guns and a nitro cell is good utility. Lesion is ridiculously good as it stands right now with a great SMG, and an ok shotgun.
---
Sit in a corner crying and hope you don’t get killed
---
Just play ranked, that’s it

This happened to me yesterday, same map, same site. And guess what my Mira did? When the thermite went up to put his charge on the wall SHE POPPED THE FUCKING MIRA even though I specifically told her i was bandit tricking.
---
Fuck, that’s big. 
---
Tucker: “that’s what she said” 
---
We should not 
---
noice you duel wielded the battery like a real bandit
---
I got great accuracy, I lean when needed. And I'm in diamond. But I have mate's in silver who can and will kick my ass in a 1 v 1. Innacurate as fuck. 
---
.... 
---
Compensator doesn't start to reduce recoil until about the the 17th shot in the clip so its basically useless for a 20 round clip
---
Oh shit waddup RAM
---
Click their heads

1. Best option is to find local siege community discord etc. and find group there, obviously if it is big group you might end up playing in different groups all the time and that is much like playing with randoms, but atleast it gives you possibility to find a group you mesh well with.
---
2. For ranking up there is always the good advice to avoid now about first half of the season before ranking up giving more stable groupings and thus avoiding those nasty drops in the begining when you are put in random groups.
---
3. Ranking up from bronze to silver to gold is rather simple to solo. Just relax and take no pressure of rank in mind, just play. Take operators that best suit your play. If this op happens to be support then stick with your natural op partner. If this does not work and there is no teamplay then steer away from those ops and focus on more frag heavy ops. Drone for yourself and never expect anyone to help or support you, get the frags how many you can and hope advantage you give will lead to team to take care of the rest. On defense take the role others don't and use it to fullest advantage. Most of the time roamer role can be crucial for solo play. Aim high impact frags like thermite, tatcher if you can.
---
4. Crazy plays pay off. Don't try to play siege the way it was meant to play.... that messes up your opponents the best. And finally never ever yell to your team m8s.... ever. Not in chat or not in voice, every trigger you end up doing is sure to cost you a match. Never ever think you are carrying or even hint you are doing so... just play and don't think about it. When you play solo you are not going to carry or get carried ever thinking like that will just tilt you and make you lose games.
---
5. Take breaks if you get to loosing streak 2-3 games in a row. It will get under your skin and make you do mistakes. Also never expect to win all games either.
---
Shit. We've been d e t e c t e d
---
Maybe on the upper end of the spectrum...but no
---
 All the stoners wouldn’t leave the grass rank
---
Id be in dirt 4
---
It looks better than real life.
---
Aim head level all the time
---
Why did you get tked

Late response I know lol sorry

New meta?????

Church: “Can you just shut up already?”

Watched this 10 times in a row

wouldn't they be in the stone rank

---
Herpasaurus, there is no spam here.... 
---
I have successfully conducted two studies prior to this one, and within both a winner received a game. Utilising multiple sub-Reddits oriented toward gaming is not indicative of spam, I am just trying to maximise my recruitment prospects and gather meaningful data.
---
I would appreciate if you didn't circulate such rumours. 
---
Thank you
---
lol why is he in silver ?
---
*Caboose starts shooting*
---
Yeah, Thatcher was of my first go to characters when I was new because his gadget was easy to use and his gun had very little recoil even with a Acog. Then I started using Thermite because not having a hard breacher was losing my teams game when no one would pick one. I actually love his gun, easily in my top 5 guns. 
---
Cav I love to play because I was always a big stealth game fan. And she’s basically a genderswapped Sam Fisher. She really needs a Splinter Cell Agent skin. Then Jager has an indispensable gadget that I see placed poorly or not at all far too much. So might as well do it right, myself. lol
---
Same, weu is full of middle Eastern people.
---
Carolina: goddamnit... 
---
We avoid ranked, I get my rank (alone) at the start of the season then refuse to play it. 
---
shroud 2
---
Washington: You get used to them eventually
---
Cue Red Team in warthog 
---
Says the Caviera main. 
---
I'm gonna give you a list of all operators released after White Noise that aren't situational, because I'm a petty asshole.
---
Lion, Maestro, Nomad, Kaid, and Mozzie.
---
So that's like... half of the operators. And I didn't even count Finka, mostly because I hate her
---
*warthog music theme plays* 
---
i already know how that seasonal skin is gonna look like lol
---
Cav. went 1 Speed?
---
Let him pick who he wants
---
When you play Siege but also are pro in Rocket League
---
Sarge: PREPARE TO DIE YOU DIRTY BLUES
---
Zoom in on that tho like jeez
---
Also what are you talking about. Only Mozzie and Gridlock don't have new flairs.
---
Just push winery you muppets. Also, I would seriously consider shooting this mira
---
What rank i am? Im constantly ranking from Copper 4 to Gold 1 and Then back down.
---
Ooh I said that but don’t get her, she is really boring to play
---
Mooooooore plz

Simmons, in back seat: RATATATATATATATA *fires Gatling Gun*

Clash is Mets on defense, an absolutely absurd defender if your team is not brain dead and covers her instead if treating her like monty

I laughed at this so hard....even if he is right

By bigger map do you mean tower or fortress?

What a save!

No problem.

*for reference I’m 270 and plat 3 last season*

I'd go Maverick with the blow torch you can really mess up an enemy's defense

Which movie was that end clip from?

Nah man I'm pretty sure that's a widely shared opinion among the Siege community
---
Which SMG he has 2
---
alien 3
---
He has the commando and the SMG right
---
Thanks! I knew I recognized it I just couldn’t remember lol
---
I imagine just ignoring or blocking them is the only thing you can do really. 
---
f
---
No a PSG and small MP7 style smg
---
Ubisoft are remaking old ppl skins due to the fact they are money hungry (no momo) and also she still gets another weapon skin, they’ll be re-releasing all the old skins but updated
---
I rock the roni with a comp, holo and a foregrip with the secondary shotgun and a nitro.
---
I’ve only got one legendary skin from a pack and was the shitty bird of prey skin for Blackbeard 
---
I'll try it out. Thanks
---
I'll try that too. Thanks
---
Her guns are pretty good too tbh
---
I like the commando personally, more of a straight roamer than you but with him I’ve started camping early game quite a bit too
---
Thanks
---
Yeah man. Reload animation is sick af too
---
It’s actually a sound clip from one of the NPC’s from the PvE event Breakout. Some reason it still bug it’s way into the game from time to time.
---
Yeah, her AR feels really good and she has probably one of the better LMGs. 
---
I do try my best to ignore them. But it doesn't mean it doesn't annoy any less. 
---
150 hours is a warmup, I log that in a weekends time. Gotta pump those numbers up 
---
…it’s casual…
---
We need (Clay)more

Alwaya bleach to white then dye to desired color.

Preach, my fellow based Thermite main!

Wow, lot of effort my man nice job!

See you on the front page again shortly!

Actually a lot of people care, given how many upvotes it has, how many complaints we’ve seen about this, and how often this has been requested in the past.

Oh fuck.
