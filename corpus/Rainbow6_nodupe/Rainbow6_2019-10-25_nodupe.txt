Removing ACOG from all AR might be too drastic, but we could try to intermediate, the rifle scope on the M249 SAW that magnification should be main stream. DMR will have its place for its exclusive access to ACOG. And I don't want to comment on the state of LMGs yet because they have recently changed the ADS timer on everything, it takes awhile for the community to adapt.

Cancel that

I totally forgot Zofia can self res

Between rook (that helps all of the players in your team to take 1 more bullet and only go down on body shots) vs Warden (Solo ability) people in higher ranks will pick Rook.
---
It's supposed to be the other way around
---
Make it not worth the time who dont care about rank to play that mode. You not caring shouldnt be my problem when I'm playing ranked.
---
I mean it's not good but it's fun

But why doesn't she has to the same reload all time

I got one for the SG CQB (French shotty) and the UMP

&gt;Is 35 more ticks gonna cost them banks? N
---

---
For all of their servers to run 100+ tick? yes thats a lot of higher performance servers.
---
Even the money fountain that is CSGO doesnt have servers with 64 tick. 
---
&gt;If ideal the game should have 244 ticks

For the third time, the recording is on my Xbox account. It's my clip. @xLlngLlng (the I's are L's) check the posters bruh
---
I didn’t understand the first sentence, it makes 0 sens.
---
OK thank you.
---
I’d like to see something similar to apex legends.
---
Worth it
---
I do think they need to speed up animations on the defense side
---
Yeah I got it in a pack
---
Prowler and knockoff pulse are the best
---
1. Stellar username 2. *Perhaps he's undercover, again*
---
He has chemophobia
---
Well that's not a very nice mentality to have
---
As I said not as good as maestro or rook but a alternative for these two.
---
Not to mention console
---
Cavi portrait looking dummy thic
---
Honestly, attacking is WAY too ez. They eother need to slow down the hammer and gadget movement, or take away pulse. Or they can make defense have 4 spooky modes instead of 3, and speed up their gadget movement
---
That’s what I thought but I was like naah that’s just dumb. Anyway thx for clarifying.
---
The room with the flipped table under the hatch, sometimes the hostage sits there.
---
Looks too cluttered
---
Your role in the match, and how difficult it is to do it well. Doc keeps people alive. That's kinda hard.
---
No it's not. Ubisoft doesnt have to do these events at all. You get 3 free packs, a special map you can play on for free. They put alot of time and resources into these events so there should be a payoff.
---
That's a nice skin and pretty rare
---
Sell these.
---
Also do Maestro’s revolvers pls
---
I will be grinding for renown this weekend. I suggest you do the same if you are trying to get packs
---
Yes will be playing a lot of terrorist hunt
---
I was kind of hoping the terrorist would blow up the wall behind you as you were grabbing ammo
---
Haven’t played since Tuesday.....is there still a renown boost in casual?
---
I wanna buy the full collection but this headgear made me think twice
---
You cant even do that anymore
---
I would do the doc packs because it’s limited edition
---
Idk, I've been playing the new minigame for now
---
Most of it isnt worth it honestly.
---
I definitely agree
---
Imagine you get the weapons and gadgets from that event... cowboys/girls get bosgs and haLOLween people get their speed boost
---
No, you gotta find a one entry room and place all your traps AROUND the room then barricade
---
I think objectively these have had the most effort put into the models
---
i whole heartedly completely agree.  the western player cards are awesome but we might never even see them again. i would love my twitch's or cav's card to show, especially for the money they cost
---
Is that an actual pumpkin you did ?
---
How
---
Ive noticed. I guess imma buy seperate packs and pray i will only get the ones i want
---
holy shit dude that yt video was so aids wth. His callouts are cringe lmao keep smurfing on him HAHA good content xD
---
Fantastic idea
---
I might main twitch now that ive got this skin lol, the gun is great im just not used to using her
---
No bully.
---
Yeah...my plan is to grind the mini game for the second pack then maybe play casual if the boost is still going on I guess. *sigh* At least we have the option of buying it with renown this time
---
The only things worth it are the headgears, frosts uniform maybe
---
Yeah, the minigame is ok for renown but terrorist hunt is always the best option
---
YES!!!! At least just the headgear. There is no way they are not able to somehow work this in.
---
Remove stalker, fucking too Op
---
there is no doubt that for the money they cost, the least they could include is to have the operator card also shown in a game of causal/ranked.
---
I want kapkan, frost and lesion. But knowing the rng i will get the others instead
---
Once you do get used to her you will fall in love. Her gun did recently get a nerf but it was only to the mag size
---
Yeah I suppose I think that as most games have the features in at launch LMAO
---
My friend tried spawnpeeking me and it literally looked like a lightbulb was trying to spawnpeek me..
---
That’s actually a dope idea ! I’ll give it a try!
---
I mean, hopefully you get what you want. Best of luck man
---
Yeah you just gotta find people willing to rush into house 100 times in a row. My friends lose focus fast
---
What are you talking about. I literally get put in a game for a second and boom insta kick or I choose to play as an OP that I HAD TO PAY FOR and someone else apparently "mains" only that OP so I get kicked or TKed. It's a damn game, people need to stop being crybabies when they don't get their way.
---
Speaking of....are you a console player?
---
on attack i saw a recruit with Thatchers ar33
---
Lmao
---
I was curious myself so I told my friend to stand still and holy shit. It's the same as the light flare you had back in the earlier days of siege when you tried to spawnpeek
---
It took me 40 matches to win one round with Ela. And I main her. I can't have fun when she does nothing to attackers. Not even her mines really do anything as the match I last played someone activated one yet still out ran me whilst affected. She's not fun in either the main game or event which is really pathetic on ubi's part. Not only is the entire event flawed and bugged when it comes to alpha packs. It's just unbalanced. Ela should be a 3 speed like attackers, giving her extra agility for her no damage
---
ill add you and play w you on my smurf but i don’t really have a mic i have the ps4 mic but it’s audio is ass and i have a headset and the mic don’t work so i switch for coms so lmk if you wanna play
---
Thanks man
---
Nice

Why is pulse better? You are slow af when you use ability.

No because then you have more coverage, and one shirked covers a decent amount of space. It could be fun, but realistically I think it give a bit to much to defence
---
I want the body to complete the set, but that won't happen unfortunately.
---
I would love to play Quarantine. It basically Ubisoft's version of Left 4 Dead.
---
Honestly, I'm interested since its apparently a roguelike dungeon game, potentially with character building, permadeath, and randomly generated maps and such. Always love something to do with friends too. It's all speculation, but I'm interested.
---
I'll play now if you want. I have to use earbuds for my mic because my headset is broke so it's not like I have the best quality
---
Yeah that would be sick
---
[removed]
---
Potentially unpopular opinion: we need more micro-transactions.
---
Not game-changing ones but paid drone skins, victory animations, and character cards could add more personalization to the game and provide Ubi with more resources to support the game, similar to the options we have now. Maybe that way they don't have to introduce a bunk battle pass no one wants. 
---
As long as they don't provide a tactical advantage (see: Twitch Elite's drone).
---
On what platform
---
Try to be more of an optimist than a pessimist
---
Gonna be honest this is a little suspect, can't find a nerf stryfe model that would suggest you used it to create this.
---
One way is a feature, it's how the edges of smokes work (a true one way smoke is difficult, so like Bhopping it is allowed). Bomb stuck spots are only used when a player is throwing, and isn't even the most effective way to throw (one can do it better in Siege and CS). Kid you not, over 1k hours in CS and I haven't seen one used. The first one I'll give you, but got patched quickly and isn't enough to topple the massive piles of bugs Siege has had and has.
---
I wouldn’t mind that. I just thought it would be cool if the operators stood there (in cosmetics we chose)
---
How am I pessimistic? I’m just realistic.
---
Pc
---
That's how they get more money.
---
I really like this idea but it most likely won't be implemented. It detracts from the elite skins which may affect revenue gathered by Ubi.
---
Not a lot of peolpe play realistic cause its not really realistic. Its just AI with the aimbot and walls turned up and they spawn outside the building even on normal thunt. 
---
Also you dont get a lot of renown compared to the time you spend on it. People play the multiplayer or normal.
---
Full sets, like these event ones, can end up costing more than elite skins in the amount of alpha packs that you need to purchase and open.
---
Aight, casual or THUNT?
---
Too bad I'll never get to use them.
---
I would but I can’t. I was asking for others because I noticed  you didn’t have it.
---
You pick
---
Most of csgos "features" are just shitty side affects of the engine that players just accepted
---
He’s joking 🙃

Press Spook mode. Your tracking gods have no power here!

It’s Jäger.

Also, why didn’t you spell it correctly when you were capable of doing so?

I noticed that too. So excited.

I don’t have a mic. You have a discord?

Ok thanks

Every time you see some guy that’s clearly switched, his rank and K/D are always higher on his main server right? It is, because [ping abuse doesn’t exist in Rainbow. ](https://www.pcgamer.com/a-former-rainbow-six-siege-developer-explains-why-players-think-hitreg-is-broken/) If he shits on you it’s because he’s so much better than you that he can still shit on you despite the high ping, not because the high ping is an advantage.
---
As ela in this mode I place mines of the entry way to where I'm hiding and as soon as one goes off I run show a bit of me then nightstride and throw them behind me and repeat at new spot.

Bruh how do you get that Cav skin 😯

Stop right there criminal scum, You have violated the law. Now pay your court of fine or it's off to jail with you.
---
Sadly. But if they add this feature in a lot of people can finally happily spend their odd credits.  Ubisoft gets a bit of money from people buying credits in order to finally spend that odd amount they have leftover, people are happy because now their balance is a nice 0 instead of some odd number that can't be spent. And they might even sell more credits because people who hate odd credits (like me) will finally buy them since I can get the exact denomination I need instead of having leftover that can't be spent.
---
Wrong again, One Way Smokes were actually broken and considered Over Powered, so Valve *nerfed* it. Nerfed it, not removed. They know of it's existence, and changed it so it's difficult and skillful and thus being a feature that allows for deeper and more in depth play for top tier players.
---
I kept waiting for a frost trap to be at the top of the stairs
---
He could be any one of us
---
Dammit, I knew realist was the word but google failed me
---
'AbsorbMyBullets' what a fitting name
---
This seems to be a recurring theme
---
I have the same problem dude. I've already tried everything. I've been talking with support for more than a week now but they refuse to acknowledge the problem.
---
There is no fix other than them fixing it but god knows when will that be. They just don't care.
---
Yeah as soon as they have a track on you then you are absolutely fucked.
---
You mean like to type out?
---
you can just use reknown also but it is pricey
---
Can confirm, cost 50 bucks to get all the alpha packs for the event :))))))
---
they were probably fired because they didn't make shit tier skins like black ice
---
Other's are fine but i desperately wanted the new Twitch's Game Face headgear and got it
---
Uhhh where is the Pony Lord?

I just want to be a cowboy again
---
This is why I love living in Montreal, so many people are bilingual qu'on peut pas mal tous parler en franglais and we'll all understand plus ou moins

For real. I get hitted even if I am a few feet away.
---
I’ve seen a lot more Castle’s since Amaru was introduced. But yeah he’s very situational and depending on map/bomb site. They could at least make his barricade go all the way to the floor to block out drones Id say that would be a easy fix and balanced.
---
I’d be able to see what would happen
---
I see that now
---
Definitly a hack and not a bug, a really odd hack one at that, but one none the less.
---
*starts dialing the police*
---
Anything goes in casual/unranked so give em away
---
PriesT isn't a PL level player. He's a common Ranked player like varsity gaming who ground his way up, with a controller, and THEN started go4s.
---
I SAID GOOD DAY
---
For one character or ALL of the characters' gear?
---
Yeah. The texture is not bad, but takes a Keen eye to notice.
---
That's some heavy dedication.
---
I’ve never seen hentai of someone with 3rd degree burns.
---
They're not limited time. They were available last Halloween too. They'll probably be available again this year.
---
More condescending trash talk. Boy you like starting shit with people.
---
Oh yea bud, keep stalking my replies LMAO
---
Yep ur right
---
I would do this in ranked.
---
If a team resorts to mindless, barbaric toxicity to deny somebody on their own team the fun of the game, they don't deserve to win. I'll lose elo, but that's a small sacrifice for teaching them a lesson.
---
Yes, because they asked what was in the canisters
---
Been playing the game since beta and I’ve never been above Gold 1 🤷‍♂️ terminal gold for life
---
agreeable
---
let this map come back for one week then you can all remember how absolute dogshit it was
---
if as a roamer your anchors lost top or 2nd floor control it was next to impossible to retake site with only 2 narrow staircases, 1 of which was outside and got you spotted
---
Lol when Frost did this to us she got trapped by the player caught in her trap
---
I would definitely buy all the packs if this was the case
---
I just got vote kicked for no reason :(
---
Darn
---
Where else can I post this then?
---
If they do that im lucky as hell. I got the full ela set from my 2 free packs. Best part is i dont even have ela.
---
Shitted*
---
One of the best pieces of fan art I have seen in a while.
---
They won't be available again.
---
The average player base improves over time, so you are most likely improving at the same rate and remaining well above average.
---
Id say I'm below average in the my veiw of my self and own skill.
---
Well it's random what you get, worst case scenario you have to buy all the packs which will run you around $60 for all the event cosmetics.
---
All good.
---
it’s ubisoft, why would they do anything the community asks?
---
Im starting to
---
You want a camera in an alpha pack? U wot?

Guilty of coordinating, or of getting swollen cheeks?
---
Sure goyo is somewhat meta, but give ol’ Ned Flanders some love will ya ?
---
Looks like Lord Tachanka, but he seems to have lost some muscles.
---
Is it true that there is a place in a recruit's head that, if you shoot it, it will blow up?
---
It's the new hide and seek mode, attacker only has access to three "operators"  (Jackal, Pulse, Lion) but each operator can be used by more than one player. Which leads to some ungodly abomination like 5 Lions or 5 Jackals.
---
Are you sure that isn’t Goyo’s vector?
---
Pulses heart scanner would be op

Hey have you ever noticed that really buff people look like they have a skinny person popping out of a muscular meat suit from the shoulders?
---
Or just coordinate with your team, instead of creating unnecessary direct counters.
---
They already tried this. Back then during outbreak you used to get those icons on your operators card if u had a full set on. Same thing with the splash packs
---
Fuck it. Making him shoot through reinforced walls too since we are sharing bad ideas.
---
I’d just run with what looks like a shotgun pistol
---
Ive never seen this massive downvotes before.
---
And you took mine too :)
---
This just happened to me. Please remove this mechanic ASAP.
---
Those are only defender skins.
---
I bought Lesion. Sad about my decision :(

Shoot through concrete
---
Another cheat creator will take his place.

Wtf, that was mine give it back!

If you're surfing you're a cunt no matter the cause.

I just opened 2

They look disgusting tbh
---
If you get badly tunnel visioned try turning off points as it helped me so if you knock someone you don’t rush for the kill becoz you don’t know if the still alive 
---
Idk it helped me tho
---
Also try getting into a five stack as you’ll win more
---
This idea has been around as long as the game has existed.
---
Also, glaz can still shoot through the barricades but doesn't destroy them anymore...

Deagle is also my favorite side arm in the game. I know that it's super big making it hard to see when aiming but I still love it.

12 packs. Lesion uni kap body. Charms
---
I had a stroke reading this
---
 Add pro league aswell
---
&gt;I mean the option would probably span the entire game
---
Oh good.
---
&gt;I actually meant I see the drone easier, but also the operator but that would vary person to person
---
Interesting......
---
Seen it as I posted it. Can't say I care too much, find something better to do.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes
---
My side hustle is video editing. Very nice. You make it using green screened assets? The smoke looks premade?
---
If they are not visible you dont. Either you take a risk and set them off to not worry about them. Or you can try another angle.
---
Yeah, it’s really easy. There are multiple strategies that I’ve used to evade and kill attackers.
---
No please
---
your problem, if we didn't have them than the game would be shallow and empty
---
Nomad
---
well i know where they are but as soon as i peek slow or fast i get kaboom
---
I’ve noticed that this is hit or miss tho. You either end up destroying or getting destroyed. Plus, it’s incredibly boring to play this way. It’s like playing prenerf glaz. Sure, it’s strong af, but just not fun at all.
---
Just have to reskin the impact grenades maybe
---
To my house
---
I predict Blackbeard hate
---
It had it for me too, I got scared
---
These are genuinely amazing, and you should be very proud of your work.
---
Really? I’ve been playing for 5 hours total and I love it. I wish they had 3 maps (Theme Park, Consulate, and Villa), but I love the thrill tbh.
---
Every Black Ice is better than any legendary, mind changed
---
Next to the living room downstairs
---
It’s pretty easy to win defense tbh.
---
I had one clip where I Nightstrided through a door as attackers were swinging around and was like OH DAMN THAT RANGE THO
---
Watched the kill clip the guy who 'killed me' didn't even swing he had his heartbeat monitor out and it literally looked like I bumped into him then got thrown out the room and he just looked at my body in shock/horror.

Does he actually get to shoot?

*evil french laughter*.   Lion is le best
---
I had to exit the game and come back in and that worked for me
---
Thank you man!
---
Hol up
---
I had no idea!!!!
---
They should take the glowin off from his head tho, not gonna use the headgear on ranked if i get it from packs. And sadly i dont play anything else than ranked so the headgear would be useless for me, still like it tho but its not good for trying to not give free head
---
My friend had the same that he didnt have it but we played one game and he got it then
---
NO. Am I the only who hates all these clown skins in tactical shooter?

Also showing what camo you have on your secondary, I have a lot of black ice pistols but only one primary :(

5 Lions is garbage

Wouldn't you be able to kill trapped enemies faster by throwing gu mines at their face over and over?

Thats an insult to bots

Just making sure you’re mental faculties are in place

K
---
Did they actualy change anything or did you just destroy al the walls?

When you crouch you do reduce noise..

Lol yeah I made it bandit and laid because they have very similar gadgets
---
The blackbeard logo is clearly not a black image photoshopped i recreated it notice how it does not look the same as the actual blackbeard logo
---
**Kaid**
---
They called me a hacker.
---
I love this idea!
---
What if we had one of those snake cams they had in in tc’s rainbow6 Vegas
---
IDK I find the mode fun as is. Won more on defense just by slowing the attackers down.
---
Is that your grand argument, to call me a kid? Ironic.
---
Did you figure it out?  Could you let me know please!!
---
I had a funny moment where I was being chased, turned around and set up a booby trap on the door I just ran through, and kept running, and the guy chasing me ran right into it and died. Like, he saw me putting it there while he was approaching and everything.
---
 no fucking way your so lucky
---
y the pic
---
Nah just straight up make it a little slightly see through ghost sheet that goes to translucent when up.
---
Would love to see that coming to the game. Especially when you have a Pro League Skin or maybe the Sledge G2 skin.

Yes

Wait, I'm pretty sure I did that when Goyo was released.

So much situational that at least a gadget buff is still a necessity. 
---
If only Ubi could give him something more powerful than UMP from the start.....
---
RemindMe! 1 month
---
So nook with interrogations
---
But you can buy them with renown now so it’s an improvement
---
Even if you buy new ops, you gonna end up maining one or two ops anyway, just like almost everyone else, so after all it does not really matters...oh and dont forget that every little kid wants to pick new ops, so the chance that you'd play with them is kinda low...so absolute no reason to worry...
---
The Lord givith, and The Lord Taketh
---
Don’t forget about Ela :)
---
You can change it thru your INI file. There are youtube videos that will show you how! It's super simple
---
4 packs for 50k renown is a little steep in my opinion, but you're right, at least it's something.
---
Make it really small but when used have a little yellow light so it’s not invisible but let jägers gadget stop them
---
But you have to sacrifice 5 to find the objective and scan every enemy...
---
“She basically only shoots foam darts now”
---
Nobodys going to acknowledge the fact that he came an inch to toching the goyo
---
more examples being pro league and outbreak sets
---
I will try this. Thank you so much!
---
Balancing idea: 
---
The cam can be accessed by the operator only. 
---
Can be countered by ADS. ( as I know next operator will be Jager type so why not )
---
Cam cant be move or rotate. ( bulletproof cam )
---
Have lifespan? Maybe batteri effect?
---
Servant, prophet, the one who gives the sacrifice
---
We can expect one more nerf - removing ACOG. Still, gun will still wreck.
---
Cool.
---
Only On Console**™**
---
Bye
---
Hmm. It’s an interesting idea, but it would probably need some balancing. Would the cam last forever? Would you need to pull out the deployment device?
---
hehe hardens
---
bye
---
You don’t need to buy the battle pass
---
No, you can’t move it and it’s glowing yellow
---
What do u mean a battlepass, the previous one was free for everybody so u could get free items by playing.
---
Now, all that left is finally buff Chanka.....
---
Well that was idiotic, off to hang myself
---
I mean I guess you can do that to.
---
Cya
---
How did you break all the walls?
---
I hope those are googly eyes on the banner.
---
I’d also like to be able to double Kaplan a door then.
---
I disagree. Think of it like this: if you take tho op, dokk, and twitch, that’s three spots on your team. Yes, you have the opportunity to have more observation tools, but how helpful is that when you need to get through a reinforced wall? When there’s a vigil that evades cams? When you know there’s anchors on site but can’t do anything? Obviously, you won’t want all intel ops on attack. But giving us more variety in how to gather intel sounds great and necessary if we want 100 ops
---
That hibana is just... Copper 6
---
U will get used to it trust me :).
---
Nope you’re right, I guess I’d never seen the purchase in their stores and never heard someone complain about it before you so I never heard about it before.
---
Yeah I was trying to figure how to balance it. Likely it will give off a slight glow an ally can see and they will have to melee it off.
---
I mean... they want 50 ops on each side. There’s more than likely going to be more intel ops
---
What did ela do
---
Bruh this is valkryrie with extra steps
---
Spicy
---
When you have no more drones left so you become the drone
---
Make it so it can't rotate or spot, callouts only.
---
[He said the thing!](https://youtu.be/7u0wg3t6osM)
---
Happens to the best of us.
---
Wait you can turn them off? Where?
---
Ehhhh Idk about that. That makes it impossible to pull it out if you’re the last one left or if your team is too far away
---
and spiders
---
"A single jpeg", no need to transfer a jpeg at all anyways, and as well they are pretty huge lol
---
I got Black Ice Smg-11 pretty early
---
Don't forget to follow me if you liked my video &lt;3 Thanks for supporting my contents.
---
You can toggle it
---
I like the arms
---
Casual = challenge completion mode
---
Where is the Halloween headgear
---
Well since majority of the comments are for yes, I shall stand for no because its just increasing defense power, when in some maps, defense is already overpowered like outback.
---
Sam fischer?
---
What if it is countered by Jager and the cam is only active for 3-5 seconds? Then it stops working, makes a loud audio and visual alert that it was there, but no longer works.
---
You arsole! Now he will kill us all!
---
happened to me to lets share some information maybe we can glitch it
---
Looks like they bought a kriss vector kit and painted it accordingly and also bought a scope prop, looks great
---
You called?
---
Splinter Cell did it! Splinter Cell did it!
---
It was Hibana elite
---
Ehhh... really depends on yourself really. I can only give my own opinion but I try not to have value judgements.
---
I think cosmetics are cool, but more so is the feeling of playing a new operator. I have 75k renown and am not planning to use any of it to rng packs that are overpriced. Rather I have it saved for next season for new ops. Also, ubi pushes out these limited time packs rather often.
---
The perfect bait, they will never expect the shield to explode since its electrocuted
---
This, is cool
---
That's already how nomad is and shes very strong. You just need to be quick with it or shoot it outside of a gunfight.
---
Are you stupid
---
I would like the idea shooting this thing onto defenders to see what they're doing. The defender can take off the cam. But if they don't realize it, then free information for the attackers.
---
They always release operators in pairs. There'd be nothing stopping them from adding this operator idea and bringing in an alternative to Jager at the same time.
---
Thanks
---
Just use your drone lol
---
Would be handy to have an iPad on your arm so you can see the camera while in action. Similar to Pulse and his monitor. That might be OP though.
---
I support this idea, the operator in question should also be able to team up with a teammate to send a C4 towards the enemy.

Water you talking about, we need religion to be able to do that but according to 5 year old son. Mind if I stop by this weekend?
---
Run the situations and terrorist hunt. I made the switch too and struggled so freaking hard for almost a month. Then I decided to take a weekend and grind out 3 stars on all the situations with some solo T hunt in between to take some breaks and mix it up. It helped a TON. You can practice a hundred gun fights in t hunt in the same time you'll practice like 10 in casual or ranked. Just because there's so many more enemies and you can restart so quickly. Plus with solo t hunt you can take your time, try different operators and weapons to get used to different recoil, etc. You can shotgun rush, sneak around, try out DMRs, try using only a pistol, only go for headshots, etc. Seriously, take a few days and make games out of it. Time yourself, try using a gun you've never used before, whatever. Make it fun and soon you won't even be thinking about the controls and leaning and all that. Then move it over to casual and enjoy :)
---
this image is actually highly detailed
---
In poland we doesnt need orange thing on barrel
---
Would've been better if they didn't have enough time to defuse but still pretty dumb
---
I knew it ikmew it
---
I’m guessing that when you are aiming with the dart gun it’s going to be kind of like nomads and give off a yellow “laser”
---
Cons , cams cant be moved , they also make a little hmmm sound only they are used
---
Those are all for bringing bandit to life😳
---
Literally amaru
---
Ok I know u can do that with seasonal skins so it was my best guess
---
The one is the enemy team rejoined the game?
---
Because he hadn't a symbol
---
So he was still loading
---
A crappy harddrive is not ubis fault
---
yup
---
Just want to point out that you were a ball hair away from being the crispiest jäger.... but I guess your aim is just too on point
---
I'm getting anxiety from you. You don't check corners ,or any peaks that enemys might be doing
---
The community already hates Blackbeards gadget.
---
Imagine how salty the community would be if instead of a 50 HP piece of plastic the headshot shield was instead a concrete wall.
---
So basically unnerfed Blackbeard
---
Someone switched your n and m keys buddy
---
He's strong right now, you'd be stupid not to use him.
---
Don't know if you know but that's console
---
This is basically a drone that can't move
---
Ubisoft wants to know your location.
---
Maybe only that OP can use the cam through their particular visor?
---
Except we have valk
---
Wait wtf. I didnt take this picture upside-down
---
Yeah I’m only joking mate, she has gone to shit but baby... that F2 is too saucy not to play with
---
Valk 2.0
---
This operator isn’t a defender
---
Yeah it’s been all over here since the event came out.
---
My joke is ruined. The point was that it was being called a rainbow is magic pack, and somehow the picture got flipped upside-down
---
Why is it everytime I fall off a game an event happens?
---
Oh
---
Kinda like valk and nomad mixed together
---
That just sounds like valk with extra steps
---
Valkyrie but better?
---
r/EmojiPolice get the fuck down on the ground
---
it's a good idea, but gameplaywise it would be a improved version of  valk, offering the same basically
---
The Scorpion was like a weapon that came from  the heavens it was one of a kind until ubisoft nerfed it into a hot harbage hell and made people abuse the shotgun. Ela is weak but she is still my favorite female characters in r6. Btw best way to get ela buff is to get half of the r6 community and vote for it to get buffed or a new gun
---
imagine if it worked like a lesion mine that can get stuck to the operator
---
I never make it to the tk part
---
The cams should disintegrate after like 20-30 seconds
---
It would be cool if he got a screen on his gun so he could use this gadget to get a view on the defender's back while he pushes in
---
Maybe they just think you’re a cunt
---
ThAtS wHaT sHe SaId
---
WJA is west japans center maybe theres another issue at play?
---
tell me how exactly you can tel that somebody is a cunt just by looking at them?
---
Kinda cool
---
True, one of the best weapons in the game!
---
Technically you can still grind for them, as newly in this event you can buy them with renown ( I think it's like 12,000 per 1)
---
there always be douche everywhere, but when we understand each other, it's good.
---
(english is not my first langage)
---
I'm getting Splinter Cell vibes out of this.
---
Heroin
---
Like a Nøkk/Valkyrie mix? I like it
---
So it's like Valkyrie but more portable
---
ngl, I audibly gasped when that happened.
---
So basically Valkyrie on offense? Could be good but I feel like we've already got a metric ton of observation tools in the game.
---
Attacking valk
---
Amaru can stick to ceilings? Cool!
---
Probably
---
Mix between doc and Valkyrie, I like it
---
Are you low rank? They probably check your stats before the round starts and if you have bad stats (k/d, win/lose ratio).........well........you know what happens.
---
It adds a lot more variation and customisation to the smaller things like the player card
---
he wasn't, they had 50 customers, didnt provide rage cheats. It was due to the BBC report, pissed them off.
---
Really? I’ve played since early 2016 and never saw that.
---
Hey, I mean, well yeah I guess
---
Amazing cosplay!
---
Looks sth like Jhin in LOL
---
It has good intentions but the fact people abuse it for all the wrong reasons is all the more reason Ubi should change the kick system.
---
It might be an Easter egg to re-animator, the stuff the main guy uses to re-animate the corpses is a greenish liquid
---
Happy early birthday then my good sir
---
EU leagues have been doing amazing with her but, like Warden, it relies on defenders doing a very specific playstyle (reliance on cams and indirect* intel gathering). Against this it is very strong but just eh against any other team combination.
---
(*indirect as in cams, BP cams, Evil Eyes, Valk cams and Yokai, compared to Lesion mines, barbed wire, Deployable shields or Mira windows, which is where she kinda fails as she relies on negating intel but still has nothing against so many other types of intel).
---
Imagine holding the dumbest angles while sticking to a ceiling
---
Exactly. If you could trade them then there would be no reason to open the rest of them.
---
If its not for attacking team then its just a better valk
---
Might be cool to see a display attached to the weapon.
---
This is why we have drones lol
---
Night
---
ash BAD
---
Can’t believe Ubisoft nerfed Twitch’s Thiccness. IQ’s probably next.
---
Do you not understand that the right data center by ping times is a bad data center to ever get a game because the population is so low?
---
So valkyrie just stronger and as an attacker? :o
---
Did you get the ace or just the spawn peek 4 piece?
---
“Everyone liked that”
---
I feel that would take away from the bosg , and than it would just be a crappy, 2 round shotgun
---
Spawn peak 4K
---
Lol ok cunt
---
No fun allowed.
---
Thats actually great to hear. I respect that.
---
&gt;&gt;I never said these skins gave advantages. I said skins do in general. And considering gambling is the only method to obtain these... yes they are.
---
please say which skins provide an advantage
---
&gt;&gt;They aren’t forcing me to buy them. That doesn’t mean they can’t receive criticism for it either.
---
why are you criticizing them for no reason
---
&gt;&gt;Your dumb apologist mentality is what let’s these companies do these things. 
---
you can call my mentality whatever you want. it doesn't make your point valid
---
&gt;&gt;Vocal feedback gets attention of media and news which is really what these companies don’t want. Gambling shouldn’t be in these games. It preys on people with addictions and it’s disgusting. Why I’m glad governments are moving against loot boxes finally.
---
gambling is taking a risky action for a desired result. if you're paying for cosmetics there is a 100% chance you will receive a cosmetic. if there is a specific cosmetic you wish for and decide to not pay the full price for every pack, it isn't the game's fault you're deciding to take a risk. it's absolutely your fault if you decide to risk money to get the item you want. AND it's completely optional, nobody is forcing you to buy anything, you literally cant argue that because it's factual.
---
I was expecting someone to comment that!
---
No.
---
The hostility is unnecessary. All I said was that I still want to ask even if they haven't done it before.
---
Mag color isn't changed I think. Nice otherwise though.
---
Got what he deserved.
---
Yee tell em ya radgy.
---
What did u get out of it?
---
A good way to buff the BOSG would be to make it one shot to the torso from ANY range! That would make it no longer the meme cannon!
---
But then you'll lose them... you dont want that to happen.
---
Shame though as he isn’t going to see any play this season
---
Have you done any others?
---
&gt; holds a monopoly on his gadget type
---
This is why nerfing Jäger is stupid lol. He's strong because he holds a monopoly on anti-projectile gadgets, so the solution is... make him worse against projectiles? What? If you *don't* nerf his gadget then his pickrate in PL will only decrease by a small amount, so you've just made the defending side a bit more uncomfortable to play. If you *do* nerf his gadget, then you're just nerfing defense as they now have no one to turn to for the same amount of grenade denial.
---
Same man.
---
Good.
---
Practice man. Simple as that
---
[In WW1, they allegedly did it with shotguns, and it is plausible. ](https://youtu.be/2t_RW1z7pUs)
---
Nowhere close to glacier
---
They just need to hurry with that op that’s supposed to hit projectiles too
---
What’s wrong?

Overwatch is friendlier in quick play well unless your team is really doing bad that will create leavers.

Ranked is another story though there

Been playing online fps since cod4. All skills transfer from one shooter to the next.

Yh same here was actually hyped 2 get that more than the Halloween pack
---
And on attack
---
Seems like a cool idea!
---
Love this picture since he is my main.
---
So... Valkyrie?
---
Oh wait.... wth???
---
GeForce NOW
---
Pshhh.. no w-what dongle what do you mean haha
---
Isn't that just valkyrie but I guess nokk is like cav
---
Sooo thatcher ....
---
But running around as Princess Blackbeard IN-GAME doesn't have the same affect?
---
these are all of the ops?
---
What about year 4 and Kaid, Nomad
---
Wow, what are the chances of that
---
Maestro and alibi are pretty fun to play. Maestro might fit your style but you can get super creative with alibi
---
there's 50 ops... this is fake considering this photo was taken on Operation Grim Sky
---
Sleeping in saved her from the doktors curse though
---
What? The title doesn’t make any sense
---
Thanks a lot!
---
All except goyo, Amaru, warden, and nøkk
---
You don’t have goyo or amaru here the two ops from the current season. Also looks like you haven’t updated to the latest patch or your menu would look different.

how's it fake?

And if I did want to try and play aggressive. Would Vigil be a good idea?
---
I should be 19 to 5 but a nitro did no damage and i was so freaked out i 1v5ed it for the win
---
Warden, nook, Amaru, goyo etc
---
who's that
---
But, it is the only way to play house and plane, both which feel like true siege maps to me
---
Quit your bullshit. This is the old UI from a year ago and all the new operators are not there.
---
mozzie or maestro they have good abilities and you’re able to be very flexible. they both have great guns some of the best defender guns for sure.
---
Valk, Echo, Maestro, Cav, Lion, Alibi, Jackal, Pulse... 8/50 not too bad
---
Well, he has the capability to heal others. Most just don’t have the desire to lol.
---
I took this picture like 3 minutes ago why are you so upset
---
Don’t try and wooosh bait me. Do u actually not know or are are u trolling?
---
Imagine if they add an OP like this and their bio says they were mentored by the one and only Sam Fisher in infiltration and intelligence gathering
---
Lol wut
---
Showdown
---
Congrats man👍
---
lmao why are you upset
---
So Valkyrie?
---
It did Insta kill
---
Yeah but this would completely counter bandit and kaid tricking right?
---
I give this epic status
---
first of all the layout of the operators tab has changed. secondly, where's wind bastion, burnt horizon etc?
---
Thatcher but overly complicated
---
is that a pmag in a vector?
---
Fuck off
---
Well, you should place ADS in good places, you can say the same about most of OP's)
---
Hmu guy u got mic and discord?
---
*Pizza time intensifies*
---
Definitely not. There are 8 more ops after Clash and Maverick.
---
its operation grim sky
---
Uuuuh this is really old
---
Yup
---
Nice b8 m8. Really threw them for a loop
---
I like this a lot 
---
It has good counters too, which helps balance right away
---
I just went to the unlock ops button and it wont let me
---
Also, make it so if you own the elite skin, you can equip the animation to one of these other skin sets. Would be cool, like how the animations were in the Mad House Halloween event.
---
I don't get what's happening in this vid.
---
His gun is great and he is fast so if you like roaming he is a good operator for you
---
thanks brotha
---
It's a troll dude
---
\*pouts\* need more spoopy stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Exactly what i was gonna say
---
bruh we all in operation ember rise... 😂 4 operations ahead
---
It would only be for complete sets from events. Not random stuff thrown together.
---
That is also an old operator unlock screen. It doesnt look like that anymore.
---
bro wtf is ember rise
---
I know it is I’m just double checking cause I’ve seen dumbasses who don’t know what the new ops  are
---
Too bad they couldnt kill him
---
Precisely
---
honestly i really like this idea. attackers need to have an operator that gives them more intel rather than more ops that deny intel.  would it work like a valk cam where you place it and it stays there forever? or would it have like a limited battery life?
---
omg
---
What is happening
---
I see someone's Internet Explorer finally managed to upload.
---
Going for him since I’ve been wanting to have him for a while now. Thanks for your help.
---
bruh you're like 10 updates behind if you're still in operation grim sky
---
Let me guess, Clash main?
---
"bro, am I totally tripping or is that a drone flying in the air?"
---
"sit down mozzie, you're baked"

---
That Operator Emblem looks like an Owl and now I can't unsee it nor stop laughing cause it looks like it's confused af😂
---
bro 😎💪
---
U said ur pc is decent, shouldn't be a prob, bump up da graphics, go in thunt n check f ur game needs to load r not
---
I’d say you should give Mira a go. Probably the most influential defender to be added to siege and can completely change the way objectives are played. Also, great gun with low recoil and a 3 armour so can be played passively. Also Mira allows you to be creative with where you place and how you use her black mirrors. Also has the same gun as goyo (smg)
---
How come?
---
steam says there's no update but now it wont let me back in the game
---
I already have an attacker I main, so I would get vigil instead
---
Only used her once actually
---
L4d
---
I originally saw Carter from Halo Reach and was really confused since I'm not subbed to anything Halo related.
---
Jackal in Blue with that stance just reminds me of him for some reason.
---
brooooo 😎😎😎😎👍🤛✊
---
I don’t want a fucking gun that can do 125 and has on acog on a quick boi who can hide from cams. Think of how broken it would be
---
NA was doing decent with her too. Same with Warden. Aceeyz Nokk plays were much better though.
---
 
---
.
---
"all ops"
---
must be broken. 8 ops have been released since grim sky
---
Exactly
---
He could ask for a job on ubi and help them counter the cheats
---
Spitting image.
---
I’m like 90% sure dying light just did a crossover like this
---
Thanks, my plan changed and I’m going for vigil. Thanks for helping tho, my friends say Mira is good too. So will definitely have to buy that soon. Am new to this game, been playing for 1 month now and enjoying it really much. Also really like the community on the subreddit. Thanks for your help.
---
Lol dude nice comment bait trick but damn you are a douche for doin it. Enjoy the fruits of your labor, blocked for sure.
---
I was thinking about this and if it was a corner camera just give it a little riot shield in front of it that way if you can place it right it’s almost impossible to shoot down unless you go round the other side and take the wall out. Give it a 30 second usage before throwing up a “battery low” sign and it gradually degrades in quality and eventually disconnects
---
21-5 with Twitch and doc
---
Try borderless window if it doesnt take away too many fps?
---
Reinstall the game? Maybe on another harddrive?
---
These are just guesses
---
Im the same way
---
This is a thing that varies from state to state, some states allow you to paint over it and it's perfectly fine even in public places, that doesn't mean you should take it to a public place even with an orange tip someone can think your airsoft is a real gun and panic.
---
The only thing that is a federal law is that all airsoft imported into the country must have that orange tip, the manufacturer state that it is illegal to remove said tip but that's false you can remove it if you wish.
---
Alt + enter switches back to full screen when you get this bug :)
---
Who the hell makes a 4 man push through the exact same entrance, jeez.
---
No cause that would also give away it's position. Also that's just not realistic, less so than alibi
---
How about the further away you get from the camera the worse the quality until you can’t access it anymore
---
no
---
You know, I was having an actual Harold decent day up to this point
---
suppressors decrease damage but remove bullet tracers and near bullet detection.
---
Staying within Tom Clancy’s universe, I’ld like to see Division 2’s CHEM LAUNCHERS..
---
Healing Chem Launcher or Riot Foam Chem Launcher for a defensive OP, Oxidozer or Firestarter for attacking OP.

---
Why would the cheater talk about his stuff on BBC? Anybody got a link to it?
---
Hmm...
---
Interesting design on those things. I wouldn't want to carry too many of 'em around.
---
So a reverse Valk
---
just put the second one up

Wow the only way Ela can kill someone or do any damage. Throw a grzmot for 2 damage at an enemy. Eh still doesn't warrant why she's not a 3 speed in it.
---
Kinda memey but I like where the idea is coming from
---
I support this and my acogs
---
AR33 is fucking amazing - its DPS is only solid, but it's actually a laser. You can put however much rounds you want, wherever you want. Since I discovered it, I play Thatcher as a fragger. I cannot ever go back to L85 because of its horizontal bounce.
---
You can also destroy it with one or two shots if you shoot the hatch at a 45 degree angle from about 1 - 2 metres away
---
Having to walk around all day with a gas mask on isnt fun. In the Marines we used to have to do mask runs can hardly breathe in those things.
---
Yea 100% nope on that
---
So it's just Valk with extra steps
---
Icon looks like the blue angry birds
---
A gadget that costs a lot and doesn't work all the time?
---
hmmm
---
The BOSG is stupidly bad. Compare it to the TSG12 in power, a gun on a 2 speed with ACOG. The BOSG takes the same amount of bullets to kill someone as the TSG12 unless it’s point-blank range, but one both reloads faster and holds 11 bullets while the other one only holds 2 and can’t have ACOG...  
---
It would be a really nice buff for the gun. Honestly, it’ll probably still be bad even with an ACOG. But I do agree that it isn’t something we should prioritize as an update.
---
It would be viable to take out a pistol, shoot a cam, put back your weapons, check that cam for enemies and go back to your weapons, but it is not viable to drone it out? K then
---
Good, hope they sue that POS to bankruptcy.
---
Valk 2: Electric boogaloo
---
Don’t respect Ubi for ruining Thermite Face
---
It also runs out of power really quick and its functionality is unoriginal and has already been done
---
No, they just play on console
---
IMO Nokk needs a buff to the one unique thing she has. Her HEL needs to allow her to ignore Lesion mines and barbed wire. The latter is a bigger deal, because she's currently the only op that's hard countered by a secondary gadget.
---
Leave the big dick gunfighting to entry fraggers. Nokk should always fight on her terms, and the FNG is fine for that. She simply has more counters than advantages right now.
---
Y'all just throw in a guy who's only main is a impact grenade launcher and his side arm is any of the full auto smgs and pistols.
---
That would be great but BI being available for base ops only is what makes it rare and good
---
Well....at least he looks like a grown-up now
---
Thats actually a really good idea, how had noone thought of that before
---
Operator symbol is pretty awful 😂 but I totally think this could be an operator or a variation of something Ubisoft already has in the works possibly? Keep up the good work I like concepts 🔥🔥
---
I’m usually sliding around silver 2-gold 2, and I’ve had good luck with her once or twice against a cam heavy team or two, and man is it satisfying, but I always felt like I could be bringing more utility to the team. All my other times my op has had almost no impact whatsoever.
---
And fragging might be another problem. What use is an operator who has a selfish gadget, such as Cav, Amaru and most Docs? Either it’s to put yourself in a position to help the team (flanking unhinded like cav or getting an angle easier like Amaru), planting or to Frag (like Blackbeard or Glaz). The only problem is Planting solo is so risky and Fragging is just hard with her guns.

Jager, echo, smoke, Mira, maestro, valk. Idk you should probably say what u already have or who u are thinking about.

It should just be for sake of time whoever got to it first and defuse. You really tripping over 100 points for a defuse that much.

I’ve been having this glitch occur more this season than all the past seasons combined (up to Red Orchid).

So what's your opinion what should I do

what platform you got ?

Nice team work
---
I'm the 669 upvote

Best comment.
---
15k votes for an operator we already have?
---
So what exactly the problem you have ? You need more operators or something ?
---
I like this as long as they have a way to limit how long they are active, like a battery life or something, cause if they are coming from a gun they are gonna be pretty small and hard to see.
---
I would buy it sooner now personally still a lot of value to it
---
U right but I don’t think she should be just like cav
---
Night mode makes quiet sounds louder and loud sounds quieter, so night mode is usually considered the best one because you can hear footsteps more easily.
---
valkyrie + doc OwO
---
I have thought about what would make a perfect new operator, and I came up with, an operator that can make a hologram of itself that aimlessly runs around the map, and can't be destroyed. Would make 1v5's more interesting. "squad spots last survivor running on cam's. Everyone leaves obj chasing him. A bomb diffuser has been planted."
---
Why? It’s not even hard to hit plat 2 solo...
---
No I'm trying to decide what ver. Should I buy or should I wait for year 5
---
Were you hacking?
---
&gt;so one game using a method to make profit = every single other game must do the same thing. huh?
---
You’re the one claiming there’s nothing wrong with it. Despite everything else saying otherwise. If that was the case we wouldn’t have companies bragging when they don’t do it.
---
&gt;they aren't manipulating anyone. if you decide to pay for items then that's your choice. weak argument
---
You don’t know what manipulation means clearly. 
---
&gt; correct me if i'm wrong but i don't remember seeing anything other than headgears and uniforms in the halloween collection this year
---
You’re wrong. They’ve head gear, uniforms, gun skins, charms. And considering these things can be for operators you don’t even have, they very much can be useless or unusable to you.
---
&gt;so you're going to become addicted to gambling by spending a max of $60 (i think) on a small collection of limited time cosmetics? also i've never head of someone not buying a game because of "gambling features"
---
I mean that’s essentially how addiction works. Do you laugh at the idea of a single cigarette making someone become addicted to them? That’s how addiction works. And it’s not a single 60 dollar set. It’s a single set THIS season. What about the 250 dollar set during outbreak? Or the sets during summer? Or last Halloween? Or the cowboy set? And just cause you’ve never heard of it doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. The BBC published a piece a few months back about how a man with a gambling addiction got the new Call of Duty last year cause it promised no loot boxes and then they sneakily added them in after release and he slipped into them and spent thousands on it. That’s why this scummy shit exists. It’s to prey on those with addictions. It’s why they do them after release because it lets them hide it.
---
&gt;it is a fact that you are not required to spend any money at all.
---
Then guess we can never criticize a game ever again. Or any movies. Cause you don’t have to see them.
---
&gt;do you think that's free? they need funding.
---
So then what is the cash shop funding? Or season passes? Or the price to buy this not free to play game? Or elite skins? Why do these packs need to be gambling loot boxes?
---
Fortnite makes billions a year from a direct cash shop. No loot boxes. No gambling. Free to play game.
---
Ubisoft doesn’t need funding. They make millions. You’re such an apologist it’s hilarious. How did they fund this game for the years before loot boxes?
---
Look at what Ubisoft did to Ghost Recon. They make more than enough money. Their higher ups are just greedy as fuck and want to exploit and monetize everything they can. Keep encouraging it and apologizing for it. It’s already killing games. Those poor billion dollar companies can’t afford to make games that make tons of money.
---
Just lucky I don’t shoot IQ

If you like to grind a lot . Buy Standard edition . If you hate grinding . Go for Ultimate edition

Fr doe he just kinda vibin

omg this is literally what i fucking did but i ended up dying lmfao
---
Ubi policy with names are a fucking joke.
---
I had to contact support to change my name because it didn't let me put "Jesus" in my name.
---
Funny because when I created the account many years ago it didn't gave me any problem with it.
---
(Before someone says it, I tried many combinations and always "Jesus" was the banned word)
---
Which version do you have
---
that’s a joke right?
---
Alibi if you play as part of a team, Vigil if you solo queue.
---
Well yes but actually no.
---
Bro my 2nd black ice was a duplicate of the first 😂😂
---
Cav was my first roamer and while she’s a bit different because of her weapons she’s a ton of fun after you’ve graduated from anchoring obj to roaming. 
---
Jagers pretty fun and has a nice gun for roaming. His gadgets are also passive so once they’re deployed, you can forget about them and just roam the map and hunt people. Valkyrie. Ela. Typically you want a 3 speed character if you’re outside obj. You’re a tad quieter and swift at repositioning.
---
As far as strats, many people have different ones but I basically find likely entry points for attackers (you’ll learn them the more you play on each map) and then I find a spot to hide. If someone enters near my hiding spot I wait and listen until I think I can get the drop on them and kill them. Sometimes I pair this strategy by hiding in view of a cctv cam and basically wait for an enemy to enter my killzone, turn back to my player, stand up, and shoot them. If you hear no one enter near you, just take it slow, crouch often and roam the map. Listen for gun adjustment sounds as they are a dead giveaway you’re near someone who’s leaning to check corners around you. The only new thing you’ll really have to get used to is learning when it’s time to wrap back around to the objective. I usually return back to obj to support my team once only 2 people are left holding obj (3vs.X-number-of-enemies) and I’m a far distance away or 1 person is left holding obj and I’m close (2vs.X-number-of-enemies)

The attacking valk with a cam gun, I like
---
You were cheating don’t deny it we can’t help you. BattlEye is extremely accurate which is why Ubi pays for it. You were using external software leading to your ban.
---
Just about every 3 speed except for lesion, he’s mostly anchor or on site roamer, Cav is prob the best of off site roaming, like opposite side of the map, and vigil too, they both have abilities that are great for catching people off guard
---
So is Ultimate one worth that much
---
Take it, leave post-it note with vague directions on how to find it. Don't leave it anywhere near descriptor place. When you see a new one being printed, lay the old one with it.
---
hahaha...Right though  :p
---
Hey, that pretty neat! How many alpha packs you had to open until you got that?
---
For me I use the noise of them hitting the ground and I can normally tell by how many bullets I hit them with. There have been plenty of times where I didn't realize I injured someone either from wallbanging or quick peeks
---
If you ask Ubi directly they might say why or something?
---
So basically blackbeard when he first came out
---
Even since year one, it's not been very realistic
---
okay then how old are you where you think that this guy got banned for having a trigger finger
---
the process is automated and based entirely on what information the PC is giving to the game
---
If BattlEye detects third party software obviously a ban will be given out
---
That’s like saying all champions should be banned because they have trigger fingers
---
Because it's more shiny?
---
Amen

Ok wanted to know of the meta has changed! Thanks for your opinion!
---
Having her ignore Lesion mines is an absolutely ridiculous idea. Think about playing as Lesion and not actually being able to trust your own gadget. It's not the right way to nerf Lesion and certainly isn't the right way to buff Nokk.
---
I think tbh if it was like Nomad's deployable, it would literally be nbd, if its shot at long range? No laser, and it would encourage attacker pushes at harder angles. Maybe making it so its like a bulletproof shield, with smoke vision maybe?

I bought vigil, but can you really run out without being detected?
---
I think the simplest way would be a button. You’re looking in the screen but hear footsteps, so while driving the drone, you hold L2/L trigger to look around. You should be able to move your character while looking in the screen too. They’re going for realism but only when it comes to gunfire and not much else.

I love you Otta, but Macie did this on launch.

You know I have never thought about console and this mode, is it more balanced? Or is it an attacker slaughterfest most of the time by attack?
---
It takes the sole input from your mouse/keyboard, meaning if any other programs change the input ie, any software that would cause mouse acceleration you can change it to only take input directly from your mouse or keyboard.
---
I like this idea a lot!

Hot shit,  I think this would be a great alternative. Good job :)

He’s 2.

this shits been so overdone.

Actually a good idea. Easy to balance - give it a short lifespan (30 seconds for example), maybe some mediocre resolution, only useable by the operator.
---
I saw something about if i have a good cpu, its better to turn it on, i have core i7 3770 3.4, should i turn it on?

If defenders play right, they can win rather easily, but otherwise, usually attackers, but not as much as a sweeping victory than on pc

What is that game mode? I haven’t played in a while

If you have the BDU skin you're basically god
---
mozzie because of his reload animation
---
Yeah I think Google does that too, if Ubi is forgiving and he's smart that may not be a bad idea
---
It would give you an option for grenade defense other than Jager, so hopefully it will make jager's pickrate not be 100%
---
I have a habit of saying "I CHOOSE YOU" when I down someone as Cav that I can't kill and have to pokeball them instead.

HA! Take that you scumbag

The video feed from the camera should also be a screen that attaches to the gun so you can be mobile while having visual aide

Guns would have to be weaker though because it seems like just a better option that Jaegar

mira and ela-theyre waiting on ela so she doesnt overshadow halloween skins probably
---
Yeah exactly, sorry for having no visuals. I just thought about this in the shower and typed it up before going to work. Maybe someone can make a visual or go more in depth about this. Just thought it was a good idea to have as an alternative to thatcher. I was thinking about my engineering class and came up with this.

That seems a little harsh for making cheats in a video game. I think charging $25k per cheater that bought it is reasonable enough lmao
---
Idk about operators but I got ash’s elite from it
---
It’s cringe to think that cheaters are complete losers irl. It’s fun to be able to do things in a game that you can’t do normally. Only incels will downvote.
---
No you can’t get ops from alpha packs, there were special packs a year or two ago that gave you an operator. It was either Christmas or six invitational
---
It will be soo strongg
---
You are not wrong but if, for example, you only got two. You were almost guaranteed to not be able to use it on site because there will usually always be a jäger or two on site. It’ll still be strong for entry and such. Idk, unless you had a communicative team who had utility to dispose of ADS traps then it’s pointless to try and use it with jäger on the board.
---
Real funny, kid
---
It mean they’re only available for purchase during the current season and cannot be purchased after season end. So yes if you buy it you will have it permanently.
---

I feel sorry for you.

I told you I’d find it
---
This is a lot better than my idea, Screen door man.
---
wow so edgy
---
There are tutorials online that can help
---
It just suppose to be like an alternative version of thatcher. Except more player interactive, so you can stop bandit tricking and other electronic gadgets without destroying most of them. It has the ability to do it, but most likely will be used for bandit tricking or removing Mazzi’s pest past door ways. 
---
So let’s say it’s a sling shot, you can shoot a magnet that can stick onto surfaces and stop electronic devices near that wall or above the surface. If you use the gadget that way, it will only “jam” them. Like a mute jammer, thus stopping any bandit trick or kaid trick if it’s in the radius of the magnet . 
---
A second affect is that, you can shoot it through a doorway, anything that would move from it because it’s a metal, would be destroyed rather than being just stuck to it. (It would be easier to code rather than having 3 ADS, lession mines and ect. In one spot) however, anything that is an explosive, like kapan traps or ela mines. Would be destroyed in the process but would destroy magnet as well. 
---
So overall it requires the op with this ability to go inside the building and place this under the cite. But if the defenders find its they can just shoot it and everything will function as normal again.

The downside to this new op is that it can only be placed on doorways or windows.

All you need to remember is : dont reinforce kids bedroom on house, dont reinforce the wall between bombs, dont shoot the drones mozzie catches, dont reinforce next to mira windows.

Remember those and you will avoid a lot of team kills and votekicks.

Oh and try to make clear calm callouts, they are important af in this game.
