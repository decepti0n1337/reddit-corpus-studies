Yes.

---
---
same happens on pc my dude, depends who yiu get matched with
---
That's true. I try to remember that no really gives a damn, but I overthink the situations. I'll give it a good try next time I'm playing.
---
I found it really hard to convert my friends (playing online for at least fifteen years) off of the free weekend. I've been playing this game since Skull Rain, so I can kinda look past these problems for the game I like. But if you have no real stake in it, it's easy to look at the writhing morass online has become and think, no thanks, I'll stick with Destiny 2.
---

---
I mean, even rough sports like hockey and football have penalties (even ejections) for unsportsmanlike conduct.
---
What the fuck
---
I'm being serious
---
They also pretty much only banned people for chat abuse that said offensive slurs. You can argue banter is on the table in competition but it's really not that hard to leave the n word out of it. But people always seem to argue that this somehow takes away from the competitive spirit when again, no one is taking away swearing, it's just racism and homophobia. It's really not that hard to get creative with banter and it's still totally possible to crush a person's spirit without swearing at all.
---
Shroud isn't, since this is a Twitch thing and he no longer streams on Twitch.
---
Oh I didn't mean for Quickmatch for being a warm up for Casual but I compared the two to Unranked and Ranked since Unranked and Ranked are almost the exact same except that in Unranked you don't gain or lose MMR so my thought process is that if one small detail can warrant a separate gamemode then I think the small detail of round rotation of Quickmatch being AA/DD and Casual being A/D/A/D warrants Quickmatch being made into it's own gamemode.
---
You’re not funny
---
Why is it so much longer now?

Thank you!

Yeah, I figured, I meant like that wave of charms, should’ve been more clearer, lol, thanks!

Remember knife fights using nomad chargers? Well that’s gone

No fn way

What servers are you on

Agreed it's like a maze, would take skyscraper back in a heartbeat

Probably to keep rook from being too powerful. Prep phase is valuable, and each second for high skill settings is an extremely valuable resource.

dang they really be mute doe

It's not tho

 it has no stock, and the chamber is not side fed
---
Lol
---
people don’t wanna chat, they want call-outs man
---
While I don't completely agree, I do understand where you are coming from because I play with a few guys who aren't as competitive as I am and they prefer the casual play. I will admit that there are times when I want to be able to goof around and not worry about people being toxic to me, I mean any more I didn't care if people TKd me on cas, I just came to expect it and was surprised when it didn't happen. But mostly I feel for you guys who just love to play for the sake of playing, and for that I throw my vote in to get casual back.
---
These would be nice as a webcam

How else do you propose people get ranked? If you won 5 matches your mmr was atleast a mid gold even if it doesn't show your rank you still have an mmr rating.
---
Username checks out

It's quite late and that probably affects it but im eu and i havent had aby issues today.

Doesn't the self-driving cars use ultrasonic? If yes then the waves would just bounce back. Otherwise yeah, you can run him over

That's why you only go for the 30/90 day boosters. Any other is just a waste.
---
[deleted]
---
Thank u
---
You support removing basic features from the game, no use in hearing out a corporate apologist.
---
yes
---
God damn it's me then...
---
Probably yes but why would he be walking around in his mask and uniform
---
Ash charge works on any bulletproof cam anyways... relax dude, have some fun
---
But I'm pooooooor
---
I knew someone was holding the other penny with a thin cable behind the camera!
---
Who the fuck thinks smoke is an anchor? 😂
---
Opening that angle on garage is actually super important in comp play, at least at the t3-t2 level
---
Feels sad man :(
---
Aw, don't worry, you will get to that age soon enough ;)
---
How quickly after the start of the round was the Frost TK’d for not picking recruit?
---
I'm on the Xbox one and she is underwhelming to say the least in my opinion, a lot of people just do Kaid tricking to make sure they can't destroy there electroclaws and she for the most part is not great in combat since I think Ubisoft said about a year ago that the average engagement length is 30 feet so a 8 to 12 times scope is not ideal for most engagements and even with her SMG secondary in my opinion can't compete against assault rifles since they have the range and damage advantage and most usually have grips and special muzzles to control the recoil. I would say in the next three to four weeks she will be in the same position as Glaz is in now, very low pick rate and a even lower win delta. She is a Operator in concept but in execution she isn't particularly amazing but like with Glaz there will be a few people who can use her properly and who will main her but like with Glaz I think her and Wamai will both share the same fate as Warden, Nokk, Goyo and Amaru with some of the lowest pick rates and win deltas in the game.
---
At the very end he looked like the girl from the exorcist doing the crab walk 😂😂😂
---
Why did you put OC on this? You didn’t make the artwork, it’s been around for ages. You just slapped some text on a pre existing image and called it art
---
What? You are going to accuse him of being toxic when he is explaining something that you should've obviously understood.
---
Read before commenting, genius.
---
feels like a indie 8-bit game
---
Honestly if you bought an M rated game you should be able to take the abuse. They should throw the executives in charge of these decisions into a room with speakers blaring random mw2 voice chat to in an attempt to desensitize them
---
We ArE PrOtEcTEd
---
Yes
---
What I wanna know is why the fuck does sledge have the 9mm c1 aka frosts SMG??
---
Really wamai aswell I thought that because all the new ops being underpowered I thought they would of made them op af
---
*Did a player just try to communicate with the team? Time to teamkill*
---
Didn't read the title and thought it was supposed to be a meme on the picture of the white chick sitting on the couch surrounded by black guys lol
---
Ive left my vpn on all the time on accident. I get like 30ish ping instead of 9. Never had anything happen
---
That's dumb.  I don't participate in any toxic behavior and dislike it myself but some people just like to trash talk.
---
Play any sport and you'll see people pull this off to try to psyche you out.  It's just part of being competitive.  Sure, some people are immature pricks and go overboard but that's what the reporting/evaluation process is for.
---
Thanks for the feedback, we are removing the all chat now.
---
Game mechanics: *leaves*
---
Ubisoft: you guys are naughty we're taking away 'All' chat.
---
I like to imagine instead of being on mobile you use your thumb to click with your mouse
---
So like, you’re approaching a building you are supposed to SIEGE, your whole objective is to get in the building and capture the objective, but you don’t like when I prevent you from doing so?
---
It ain’t cheesy if you’re too robotic to consider to look at the windows of this enemy controlled structure you are trying to capture. Don’t like dying after the round begins, don’t play the game maybe?
---
Happy cake day!
---
Thx
---
46 gadgets, 1 Thatcher
---
Yo gaba gaba
---
HeY gEnIuS is very toxic. I was merely stating that from my experience an ip ban will do that i never said he was ip banned or anything. Your toxic as well. But no wonder as you are a mozzie main.
---
r/wowthanksimcured
---
A small price to pay for salvation.
---
Fair enough
---
If you hit two you should die. They are really easy to counter
---
/s
---
uhh that's before chumans obviously and it was dinosaurs take a historey class
---
uwuarmy has been banned by battleeye
---
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not
---
Why does it matter?
---
“What if we used 100% of the brain?”
---
Getting rid of scum.
---
I still buy disks occasionally, It's nice to have a physical collection. not very practical though.
---
Tcsg12 still takes two shots to chest to kill, however it makes 3 armors go down instead of kill
---
Its back to normal again thx tho
---
More importantly it's dumb as hell that the ability to leave the game and return exists. Shouldn't let them back in. You leave you're gone.
---
Fuck You BlackBeard
---
smh I heard traps aren't loyal but this is ridiculous
---
Idfk. I haven't been on in a while. I know mode preferences aren't since I accidentally had bomb on and was wondering why that was all i got for casual
---
Nope, got it like few seasons ago
---
Why even bother.
---
I said "Chumans" so I hope you're joking
---
Yes. Blackbeard causes me pain. However im sure your a polite lad though.
---
I don’t like using him because he’s so slow when you use his shield. I don’t care if other people use him though
---
Bro who cares if you main BlackBeard if you are good why would they make fun of you for it, if its because it's funny, oh well
---
That is a good suggestion actually. It won't hurt if they ban teams only for the first 10 placement matches. so at least every player is placed in a rank where his actual skill allows him to be.
---
How.... how...... how could you say that! You monster. Recruit is the best operator.
---
No Fuck this guy
---
Imagine not using the 417 as a preference over the F2.  Wow.  Wild.
---
You know I did that on accident once
---
it's 2019, I don't know what to take seriously or not anymore dude
---
I've had maybe 2 in the span of over 1200 hours, and both times someone decided to ruin it and go guns blazing.  Too many people are treating this shit anecdotally.
---
If you roam i'd recommend carrying her shotgun and the keratos so you have a ranged option, throw 2 prismas on site and keep one on your person so you can do some slight trickage with it. Use a redot on her shotty and you'll do fine. With her speed is easily able to sneak up on the enemies once they get inside. You could try using her rifle and roaming, but if you use the bailiff at all for frags, you basically need to be point blank and hit them with 3 shots from it to kill/down.
---
Imagine imagining.
---
No such things as "non-combatants"
---
gn
---
I can't hear you. Come back when your lord and savior qualifies for Ranked.
---
The whole other team is dead and you’re standing in front of the only live camera:   
---
YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED    
---
YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED
---
Lmao, who actually cares? Good riddance. 
---
In my experience 10% of text chat is useful and non toxic.
---
The other 90% is full of “gn” or random toxic banter.
---
There’s no reason to talk to the other team in ranked. It’s just a random group of players vs another random group of players. 
---
That said, if they were to implement it back, I still wouldn’t care. I mute all you fuckers in ranked anyways.
---
He's too good to be in ranked, that's why he isnt there, it's to save the rest of use from his terror
---
Oh shit I didn’t even think of that
---
Those first 3 kills are so smooth.
---
No, it came out a season or 2 ago
---
It's okay. You can stop crying and go put up your one reinforcement.
---
They brought it back tho
---
Shotguns too imo. I get the destruction argument, but 99% of the time you can just take a step back and be able to destroy stuff still very effectively.
---
Me: **mute**
---
My team: **some inhuman talk**
---
Or you can recognize that people suck and just add a function to hide all chat. Even LoL recognized that is the  better option
---
Literally getting sweaty while playing siege instead of just trying hard. 
---
My body movements would probably ruin my aim while I pedaled... Good luck!
---
*snow clap*
---
I used to think he sucked but I had some really good rounds with him this past weekend. His full auto gun does quite a bit of damage.
---
Wish I could give you award 
---
🏅 
---
That’s the best I could do sry
---
I place the reinforcement, place my barbed, and throw my c4 onto the ground, detonating it instantly
---
I still creamed, even if I’ve seen it before. It’s actually better the second time round
---
2 ROOK BACKPACKS! 10 PLATES! EVERYONE GETS PLATES! PASS THEM PLATES!
---
this is more like for honor
---
Is this real?
---
And he has a great beard!
---
Blackbeard is the pinnacle of busted operators. So no, he does not suck.
---
I would also like to know
---
Thanks
---
C’mon Ubi why? What happened to freedom of speech?
---
Basically impacts lol
---

---
Because i dont lag in any other game
---
Uh... well that's kinda racist.
---
Oh to who? You just kinda made a comment saying oh
---
Yea, well, y'know that operator called "Mute"? Yea, that's the one
---
Happy nomad noises
---
You have to realize that you’re just proving the point about how toxic this community can be when they’re anonymously using text chat.
---
I have the same laptop and I can hear the fans running from here
---
Even the ''kys nigger'' is quite enjoyable in my opinion. Shows you're doing something right
---
*it's for the meme. but if you think it's actually racist, I can take it down!"
---
That’s an oddly specific issue that I have never heard about so it’s probably you
---
If you wanna feel even worse  use hk416
---
Thanks I’ve been using it and I’m now doing good with it. I think when I was testing acog I was just happening to be facing diamonds lol.
---
If you have ACOG on the MP5 or P90, aim it at the teammate you want to heal.
---
Next, pull out your stim pistol and your reticle will be perfecto.
---
sorry for the quality Btw
---
Granted but all other acogs are removed from doc.
---
U could do that before
---
No more fun interactions between teams in casual because people are too braindead to click the mute chat button
---
It's your call.
---
They added it back
---
Yep, same here. Its getting annoying to say the least.
---
Yah its nice that they made a operator that doesn’t look like a tranny
---
Why would I heal a teammate? I wanna spawnpeek with the Stim.
---
Which, is possible, but not easy...
---
u mean 180?
---
Well, I'd prefer your legitimate opinion. I can edit it if you'd like, I value what you guys think.
---
Zofia main
---
Horizontal recoil control is non existent is Xbox
---
He won't. Doc just jumped out from second story and is coming to kill him
---
This is fake. Elas don't reinforce
---
TTS?
---
There's a setting called ''PC chat on/off''. Also you can mute everyone individually and even choose only voice/only chat/both. So everyone who's bothered by the all-chat has numerous of ways to avoid it.
---
Removing all-chat is dumb and unnecessary, all it does is stopping you from interacting with the enemy in a friendly way.
---
Ubisoft vibe checked them cheaters and they couldn't handle it
---
I love them
---
Giving away a free year 4 pass rn for xbox only dm me if you want it. Even though its almost done but still if you dont have the ops yet
---
bru i love it m8
---
Well i kill valk fuze kills doc,vigil,and me with a cluster charge
---
I do believe "spooky bitch is in there" is a little common, from what I've seen.
---
Nah man plenty of other people have it too
---
I think you have to participate in proleague, but not very sure
---
But you gotta talk shit to the other team
---
You sound like the kind of person that gets called shit in game and goes and has a cry about it.
---
Simply for bragging rights and stats it is frustrating. I don’t mind them leaving the game, there’s just no reason why Uni hasn’t fixed this, because they fixed it so that it still counts as an interrogation, so why not also make fix the kill issue?
---
The Chinese stereotype includes the "ching chong" stuff. 
---
I'm sure it wasn't your intention, but I think you should edit it, just to be safe.
---
Yeah but if I throw it at my friends head can it be a go pro?
---
Ikr
---
*Nee Flanders
---
P-90 red dot at that
---
Amaru isn't for getting into a room with enemies, you have to enter from some unexpected place to flank.
---
Perhaps. It would add to look
---
I ran into this dude named Dr_Cthulhu66 last night that I could've sworn was in the same Discord I'm in, but I guess I must have remembered his username from either going against him or being on a team with him mooonths ago.
---
Not new, from last season.
---
Wrong sub buddy
---
So what part of the bathroom are they gonna be at
---
Maybe don’t sit next to a claymore
---
Reddit isn't fucking google you imbecile. No wonder you want to use MnK on Xbox.
---
Well he's 2 armor now so...
---
I thought ubi removed the wamai dance
---
They both aim for the head and shoot killing each other resulting in a draw
---
Snowflakes ruin the fun, EVERYWHERE, even in games where you shoot each other.
---
I have the purple universal skin so...
---
I just finished 5 games and witnessed 6 ban waves. Battle eye ain’t messing around RN.
---
Yeah it’s because you bought it this year. This is from when it came out
---
Probably an unpopular opinion but Theme Park was better as it was. The new version is garbage.
---
Thank you, hadn’t seen it before and haven’t noticed anyone with it cause it’s not very obvious of a skin lol
---
wont the pan fall down if you shoot at the metal stick hanging from the top?
---
Probably because this new season just started so a new rank season, plus the game was like $10 before the season so people just buy smurfs/alt accounts to cheat in ranked
---
Дмитрий Дзен, спасибо за сливы 21 века, чёрного цвета 🚙
---
Explosives are the only thing I think
---
Think of yourself as a witness to a historical event.
---
Menus. Permanent toggle
---
If you care about your rank, my advice is to always wait a couple weeks after a season starts. Less griefers, less cheaters, and less try hards.
---
She lifted that heavy reinforcement with her back, very form for your health. 0/10
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
They walked it back - they aren’t doing this anymore after all the backlash
---
Aww man I can’t write gg ez now
---
How do you defeat an enemy that thinks like this?
---
Ubisoft kinda forgot they implemented a mute/report system
---
Probably, lately I have encountered many smurf accounts, and since I am not of such a high level I think they ruin the experience quite a bit
---
Try playing as Blackbeard, gets 10x worse.
---
Congrats! I reached Plat for the first time as well today. It feels great knowing you can start to hang with a higher tier of players! Don’t let anyone shit talk you out of your accomplishment.
---
You be lvl 44 with a black ice 
---
I'm lvl 92 and still struggle with getting anything above common
---
This will ensure I probably never return to the game.
---
bruh
---
Im only mucking about... as for whats in the canister, its best you didn’t ask.
---
thats rough bud, my best advice is to play with a buddy or when you match with a decent human being add them and play with them
---
There should be a "Tap C to disrespect" or something.
---
amaru is only good for breaching close to an obj and rushing or droning a room and then hopping in for roam clear. also breaking a hatch or going up an open hatch works a good amount
---
This can happen if youre monitor isnt set to 144hz. Sometimes windows still natively locks it at 60hz
---
then provide the source??
---
I feel like I can do the same with another op and not waste a gadget. I'm talking about not an enemy on the window. I know that is stupid. I mean, whats the advantage over another op. These enemies can hear from so far its ridiculous.
---
I need his gaming chair
---
OmG uBi PlEaSe NeRf ShIeLdS tHeYrE sO oP
---
Imagine the sound of the fan like every 5 seconds. Gonna need some serious headphones if you wanna hear footsteps
---
Counted as a headshot in the killfeed too
---
Cant get window peeked by BB if he's banned *shrugs shoulders*
---
I'm salty? Mate, I literally just gave you data. That's it. Nothing else, no attacks either. You ok there hoss?
---
hey here's favela you guys enjoy joining mid match favela right?
---
Probably a 1 in a 100 lucky hipfire shot
---
So just twitching your wrist, barely any movements?
---
Yeah
---
You sound like the type of person who throws a bitch fit if the enemy team disagrees to knife fight. You're the one offering a band-aid solution to a problem that 9/10 people have with casual. Cant play unranked when its DOA. Its as simple as that.
---
There has been a lot already, at least 10
---
Maybe, looks like it went clean through the shield though
---
You sir are a god of men or women. Absolute class, Rook is best roamer. *Salutes Rook*
---
Chill out my dude
---
Pretty sure they’re trolling
---
Utilize a dancers belt. Other than that, nailed it.
---
IQ?
---
Well, I mean, you got her. That's a plus, right?
---
Oh that.
---
Well congratulations. As a roamer, he made you look towards him and wastes your time in taking you out on the other side of the map. Sounds like he did his job just fine.
---
*sigh*
---
That's.......idk, how do you even play with such a high sens?
---
Delete him from the game entirely IMO, he doesn't belong in siege.
---
If you really don’t like the map pool, either play ranked or unranked, or don’t play the game at all
---
She does not need a buff all the things wrong with her are to balance out her one shot sniper.
---
When you shoot no but when the enemy shoots yes.
---
I also love having disc's because I actually own the game, oh your downloaded copy of red Dead Redemption 2 got taken off the store, tough shit we already have your money. I will always prefer physical copies of games, movies whatever as long as they are around.
---
Guys we've noticed that a very high percentage of harassment cases involve interpersonal communication, so we're disabling mics and the crouch button moving forward. Also please see your mouths shut.
---
I’m stupid I meant warden
---
Nah there’s blood coming out of your head in the killcam
---
Controller bindings probably/you'll need a special controller i think
---
W
---
That's right, termites eat wood
---
there ya go
---
Dude it means you'll find less cheaters this season. I'm happy it's happening
---
But he wasn’t using a scuff controller he was using a normal PS4 controller
---
Actually the extra eyelets in the chucks weren't designed for ventilation but a special technique for fitting shoelaces for basketballplayers. It's just a myth that it is for ventilation.
---
You were a complete waste of my time- got it.
---
It becomes easier after a season to identify, and possibly because Devs have some free time after a season starts.
---
Before season starts they maybe doing some work and tweaks for new operators and game mechanics.
---
Glaz is different. Defense has multiple gadgets that can see through smoke. Maestro cams, BP cams, Warden, and attackers only have Glaz. So if the enemy team has warden with smokes you’re essentially fighting a Glaz with no counters and a full auto SMG or super strong pump shotty. The way you fix his situational gadget can be fixed in many other ways. Make him immune to Zof’s concusses, make his gadget usable at 20%. I just recently put out a post listing all my thoughts and why warden shouldn’t get impact smokes. Go read that if you want to, but I won’t force you to. 
---
Even if warden’s gadget stays situational, I’d much rather that than a defending Glaz with no counters other than Glaz, whose thermal vision is much stricter than Warden’s, and a full auto high ROF headshot machine. If his gadget stays situational, then he can provide utility in other ways. Impacts would be a great way. He’d be able to provide rotation holes to the team and keep him easy recoil SMG.
---
I get a lot of characters mixed up, it’s the names mainly
---
I definitely will.
---
It's already reversed. and to repeat from another guy in r/Rainbow6TTS , Ubi should do these kind of things regularly on the test server to see what people hate and like.
---
Fuck Ubisoft, how are they still crying about toxicity after all they’ve done to stop people from saying no-no words in chat? It’s an M-rated game, not a pre-school.
---
Its fucking retarded that you get these bannotifications all the time while playing! It sometimes distracts me, boom, dead. And with a banwave like this being displayed, I would probably be pissed as fuck if I had to see it during a ranked game
---
I for one think it's fantastic that toxic players not only get to determine how bad our days get but they also get to determine which features are available in the game.
---
Sweet justice. Good times.
---
“You’re a faggot kill yourself.”

“Wow this community has a problem with toxicity.”

“OMG JUST HIT THE MUTE BUTTON AND GET THICK SKIN HAVENT YOU EVER BEEN ON THE INTERNET BEFORE WOW WTF!!!”
---
Banning a day after the season ends would have the same result AND you would get the lost elo back. Did you get what I meant in this thread?
---
You can go to settings and to “button assignments” (On your ps4 home page) and can switch all the buttons around there. It would mean your melee and sprint will be R1 and L1 also, but it’s up to you.
---
There isn't any adive besides dont use it. Mav's AR15.50 is the weakest DMR in the entire game and Ubi should really get around to buffing it.
---
Just think thick=thIQ, that should help you never confuse iq again
---
Just look in your settings for your controller and you'll probably see. It might be whatever the equivalent of the xbox elite controller on ps4

Where did you get the info that it is easier to identify after the season?

Man a world in which toxic people actively determine how they rest of us actually live sounds super great doesn't it?
---
I mean I know the best use for warden since well I am a warden main. To flex your snazzy suit on all your enemies. If you want to go farther rush in with glance activated and boom flex.
---
I hate myself for understanding this
---
damn, one of the reasons i wanted to switch over to PC was because of the chat

Nah man you have to place it on a glass window, it works much better that way
---
Hey i was thinking about starting boku no pico, is it any good?
---
Someone give this man a badge/award already!

Uh burst fire with a .50 cal Beowulf? Do you *want* to dislocate your shoulder? Just give it 10 more rounds and it’ll be fine. I’d rather they reduce the recoil on the M4 tbh, but maverick’s fine.

Nope. Thats why it was so wierd
---
I'm okay with peeking and run outs in ranked as it's competitive. If you're doing it in casual/unranked as if you're trying out for MLG, that's where the toxicity starts.
---
I have my golden skins still
---
I'm literally copper but have the pass because I like siege and nøkk and warden are hige dissappointments because they look so cool and are useless to me because I die before using them
---
Probably just a new way of banning people at a set time

Warden isn’t that bad if you use him right. I’ve had people deny smoke plants that won us the round cause they used him

How many

I was one game away from plat 2 and lost the placent so I got gold 1 :( I never have a 5 stack and always solo queue

My bad for the accents my keyboard mess up

This game has become a fucking joke. Ubi doesnt care about any of your opinions and this game should have died years ago. Every "new" operator is the most uninspired bullshit and the developers couldn't care less about real issues the game has and would rather perform dipshit actions like this and pretend they're doing something right.
---
So do I, imagine him having black on it before🤦🏼‍♀️
---
At least Nokk can be bit more impactful when going against very cam heavy team. 
---
Against flash and smoke, Jager and Wamai together is far more efficient and enough while other anchors can handle defusing better than Warden.
---
I'm an og
---
Well done bro, we need to see more PC content on this page. Poverty ridden console is ruining this page.
---
Haha
---
My greatest siege moment was when I activated my glasses as a Warden and caused much confusion in the enemy Blitz. To date the only time I've ever got use out of his gadget, but who needs that when you've got that kind of moustache.
---
what a toxic chat, should get deleted. /s
---
So.  The methods to hack games are pretty much the same.  You have to insert information and change code somewhere.  One of the more common methods is by changing the RAM values for example.  A lot of trainers and cheats just hook into RAM in a specific way - a way that Battleye detects and bans for.
---
You are making an assumption that your cheat somehow works differently from others but the fundamental way it operates is likely the same.  So it’s not BE fault.  And it’s not a “question” for battleye.  The WeMod trainer could have been there for any number of reasons such as to bypass battleye or insert game code.  It recognizes the hooks and bans.  It is working as intended.
---
Well.....i know that those things on the end of shoelaces are called aglets
---
I got the xbox glitch and I couldn't play for 1-3 hours
---
Custom games settings should be reworked ,to make whatever u want whenever u want , like at least infinity ammo and ability to fly like in csgo would make a huge difference and make learning new things way easier
---
they already changed it, stop talking trash
---
Bro ur entire page is anime so you should probably stop talkint
---
You should have (800?) R6 credits, they're for unlocking base operators.
---
Echo, Jackal, Cav.
---
That reaction tho
---
Looks good dude
---
I swear if they ever release Elite skin for her and it doesn’t have her sniper replaced with an intervention from MW2 im gonna riot.
---
I freakin
---
*I LOVE IT!*
---
Looks great 👍
---
You start it.. alone.
---
Well really depends. As a general rule of thumb I would say that is the case, not really out of try hard per say but because a console player isn't going to be used to the slightly different meta, and shooting with MnK.  They will have the map/operator knowledge, and hopefully the correct call outs, but the rest is going to be an entirely new experince for them.
---
Bruh, just the enemy team with the frying pan
---
&gt;I'm trying to understand the timing of these ban waves
---
There is no timing, that's the point. It's random so cheaters can't expect it.
---
Doesn't seem random they did same thing last season...
---
Yesterday, i have witnissed 5 Ban waves in total.
---
So well cooked you deserve a Michelin star.
---
Was in a lobby and getting our asses kicked. Guy said he was working with Lion to find us and destroy us through soft walls with the sniper. 0-2 and just as we start running out of spawn 3 of us get picked off then POOF! All 5 players on the other team are gone. A moment of silence. Random guy with voice chat on ALL GAME: "I F\*CKING KNEW IT!" Everyone just burst out laughing. I was damn near wheezing.
---
IQ actually

No, bandit used to be used for it too, both had acog at one point.

I know for Microsoft at least, if you buy a game on the store and it gets removed you will still be able to see the entry and download it.

I'd imagine it's the same for most digital platforms

This is what happens if BattlEye regocnizes a certain cheat program. They'll be gone in no time!

It’s meh. I like the weapon skins but it’s not really worth it IMO.

I have it on kaid and nomad because it suits them really well

They didn't want the Xbox One to have a disc drive at all when designing it

Lmao noticed it too, wanted to post but was like nah, but fuck this game is LITTERALLY UNPLAYABLE

it's to just have fun. Should we remove the end of round killcam?
---
No, it stays in your inventory.
---
Youre asking an utterly retarded question, of course they didnt add new lines of sight you fucking idiot.
---
Actually two
---
Imagine reading your name here, now. Got you, scum! :)
---
Removing it wouldn’t be a bad idea, stopping people from mindlessly running around just to be seen in a killcam, I see your point but even the end of round killcam can cost you the game
---
Its impressive
---
I always get the super colorful skins only which I hate :(

# SLEDGE 2.0
---
They do big ban waves at the beginning of a season because that’s when most cheaters are active, most people would be willing to pay for boosters (making it hard to pay for boost services) most likely, your the highest MMR at the end of the season making rollbacks useless.
---
It doesnt, and you obviously cant comprehend what the word casual means.

I have that

With an explosive finish

Have it your way Gordon Ramsey.

no map is attacker sided? have you never played House or Favela? I cant believe you just said something so stupid
---
Looks like Thanos has joined the game
---
I remembered two of the names
---
I swear they just turn on the anticheat from time to time so that people don't say they don't have it but then just turn it off again
---
But they kinda are. For example, if you're playing Shalet as defenders, you ban Thatcher to defend garage walls, but the other team just brings Kali. However, if you didn't pay for the season pass, you won't be able to do that when they will defend garage after side switch.

---
God, im worried that it's just banning at random people, or banning everyone who gets reported without checking first, and I don't wanna be one of those that gets banned
---
If it was, the letters "TTS" or "TS" would show up
---
I saw three ban waves while I was on for about 2 hours yesterday. It was glorious especially when people in a ranked match stop to watch
---
It's gone
---
O_o
---
No this is normal, like many other games Ubisoft/Battle eye tends to ban by big waves instead of banning single individuals right when they get caught
---
This is very calming
---
Battleye with infinity gauntlet
---
hmm, yes, this gun is made of gun
---
Who gave him two eyes?
---
Sorry, I play on play on console. So tts isn't an option for me or other console players. I feel like you didn't take any of my comment into account. As I did agree with you to a point.
---
God no.
---
looks great
---
WOOOO ALBINO POKEBALLS
---
Usually most bans happen like this in waves. So I think the system gathers evidence, then the developer looks at some of it to see if it's truly hacking, then all similar cases are marked as cheating once they know how that cheat works. I don't have much information on it so I could be wrong.
---
Another way to do it is like Valve currently does: gather the reports, let their anticheat AI analyse the game, and then send the cases they are likely to be truly cheating to overwatch so members of the community look at the recording of the match to see if they are indeed cheating. Since they implemented their anticheat neural network less cases have been analyzed by people and a larger percentage of those cases has been marked as cheating which means that the AI accurately picks up on cheating and wastes less of people's time with reports that are not cheating.
---
They reverted the change
---
I am :)
---
&gt;I feel like you didn't take any of my comment into account.
---
I don't think any of it is terribly relevant to you deciding not to learn maps before going into ranked.
---
I want this on Apex too...
---
I doesn't protect you from bullets, so nah
---
OK DUDR!!!!!11
---
Banning in waves is better for removing cheaters, they could at least have an option to disable showing battleeye ban messages if people don't like it
---
I normally side with you cause the hit reg is shit but you got the wall neck then to the right of the person who was defusing. As for the guy in bathroom couldn't tell what you were hitting
---
Lol nice
---
Getting boosted is about a 2 week ban but it depends on the severity
---
My friend got banded and he didnt even do anything, he just had really shit ping
---
Can somebody please venmo me 10 cents? I'm literally 10 cents away from being able to buy Pokemon for switch with my venmo card. I didn't account for tax.  @Iamnickjones420

---
You cant buy the pathfinders with r6 credits, renown only
---
Why is it that these ban notifications pop up for everyone everywhere? Is it just a thing that the community liked seeing and decided to keep or something?
---
u/Nekopawed has been banned by BattlEye^TM .
---
No, because they use FairFight, and its about as useful as a paper mache bomb shelter
---
Vigil plans to BOSG ACOG on you
---
Huh, TIL. It didn't use to be like that when I started playing.
---
So after your ranked you couldn't play a game with with your friends, just because they had 1 game left to be ranked? Forcing that player to solo queue and probably lose? I feel like that's punishing the first few hundred people to get ranks every season just because they play more.
---
Yeah.
---
Must be a new animation!  Cool!
---
It’s been out for while..,
---
You were playing on a Border
---
This isn’t my comment, but someone else’s just earlier but here’s what they said,
---
“You ban in waves so hack makers can't deduce what exactly it was that got picked up on and banned.
---
If you push a change and suddenly people get banned you know to roll out changes.
---
If you push out a few and suddenly everyone is banned you aren't sure what the trigger actually was.”
---
People don’t usually play ranked for the renown, you play to get the highest rank you can
---
No.
---
At this point Im wondering if its just made up names to make us believe the whole world plays the game.
---
Looks good
---
Does BattlEye still have the problem of banning innocent players with no way to appeal?
---
me looking for who asked
---
I like her. I thought she would be op and annoying. But she really isn’t. She pretty balanced. The speed to chamber a new round is pretty fair. And the damage isn’t an insta kill. Unless it’s a headshot or chest shot from CQ
---
Yup that is what I prefer on a daily basis because its just cleaner and less distracting.
---

The game should have options to clean the UI and remove unwanted elements

Freash reinstallation of windows is required

Ubisoft shaming all the hackers just like they used to hang the traitors in public during the medieval time.
---
Well there about 50million players and every wave like 20-30 ban
---
Now this will haunt me whenever I start the game.

That is true, banning in waves means cheaters won’t know how they got banned. It would be nice to disable the ban messages.

My and my friend noticed it and it was like 2 minites of ban waves twice

Why is this getting so disliked it’s not serious

Oh yeah, just stop being lazy. i'm sure they'll do that, and then maybe bake everyone a cake too. Maybe give everyone a crisp tenner and a free hat.

Honestly dont bother with ela. But zofia, thats an amazing operator. She can withstand while down so you dont have to rely on teammates to get her back up. Loadout is extremely solid, her ar is really good. Her gadget is fantastic with two impacts and two concussion grenades. She just has so much utility. A must have imo
---
Brings back memories
---
Not super relevant but the latency speed is for the servers is 23ms  so anything under 23 has the same reaction time, because that's how long the server takes to send info back to a player. Sorry about your deal though it Sucks that you dont live closer to a sever/have a better connection.

No because iq isnt the one spectating, its overwatch

R6 needs a game mode where it’s just the og game like no one picks ops and  no skins no new weapons just the old game style

I think he’s referring to Banjo Kazooie?

The cleansing, it is inevitable cheaters beware.

I think last season. and they changed it again in the middle of the season. When it first came out, they would grab really quick and looked silly but then they made it slower.

That's good. You made the conscious and willing choice to go from a 5 round total, 2 round swap, 3 minimum to win mode to 9 round total, 3 round swap, 4 minium to win with 30 seconds per round less and pick and ban mode in a smaller, more balanced map pool. You're getting better at the game and your standards are improving. That's good news.

minus basement all of house can be attacked without ever entering the building, and Favela is all soft walls that you dont have enough reinforcements for...those are literally the two biggest complaints of the maps

Favela is "spawn peek heaven" because you have to to stand any chance at winning on defense, if you just let them have free reign outside they are gonna open every objective up from 4 different waya

There have been a ton of those waves, A LOT of players being banned. This is just one wave, must have been over 50+ waves I think

That's too OP. Iq detects some 20 ops gadgets already. That's enough Intel for one entire team.

Unnecessarily overhyped change.

Damn you and your valid point
---
Ok that's a fair assessment. The only reason I said versatile was because of her load out it gave me the ability to rush Valkyrie and eliminate Cav. If I were playing last season Glaz I would've lost said engagement.
---
Dude a stair case full of lesions traps and defenders watching it from a million different angles is not safe lmao
---
She went home, Coz everyone keeps on banning her.
---
I try not to.
---
You expect a logical approach from people here?
---
old smg 11 recoil \*crys\*
---
Die, die, DIE!!! AHAHAHAH *MANIACAL LAUGHTER
---
Well of course you could limit to how much she can ping for attackers, balance reasons and all that
---
its cool, sure, take it to dms bc we're filling it up here
---
Or, just enable native m&amp;kb support. People won't use any adapters at all. Keep everyone together, just like PC has always done, and let players use whatever they want.

Why tf would your team mates ddos you?

this is too true
---
Belgrade by battle tapes fits perfectly with that video
---
Game companies like to sometimes wait and ban cheaters all at once. They do still ban a handful here and there, but it’s a common tactic to ban a huge group at once as it makes it harder for the people that make these cheating programs to realize they’ve been caught and allows the game devs to catch more people. These are referred to as “ban waves” and in the case of a game like Siege, anytime a player is banned it shows a message in the top corner of the screen saying “Player has been banned” usually includes a reason why. The new season in siege just started and Ubisoft has been banning a shit ton of people the last 24 hours or so.
---
Not to make your ret4rded teammates run around without armor
---
Christmas time
---
Hm..........
---
That's interesting. Might not be the most balanced in it's raw state, and iq might now be in a state to be deserving of buffs, but some changes could be experimented with on the TTS.
---
it was glorious

Nah obviously but does anyone know if it’s next week, the week after etc.

Given the nature of her primary and it's fire rate I would advise against it. Rainbow Six is based primarily on indoor engagements and without the CZ her pick rate would be abysmal.

Blitz shouldn't be 2 speed anyway he's a shield, and Clash takes the same amount if bullets and damage as a regular one speed. And if he can be 2 speed why can't Clash be the same speed as someone like Rook?
---
Not true, you shouldn’t say all Chinese business scam people, it just you haven’t see the bad side of American or Europe yet

Fist of all look at what your typing before you send it. Second of all look at the post before you respond to it. I know it's hard to wrap your feeble child mind around what he said but you might understand if you try really hard.

I would give you gold but I'm not rich
---
I mean, anime isn't all that bad, 
---
NSFW and being a dickhead are reasons to stop however
---
More T hunt/ aim training. Not trying to be condescending but you can be bad and still get high kills every now and then.
---
there's always one
---
His hipfire is shit(as it should be), hitbox is broken af(shouldn't be), his flash works more like a laser instead of an aoe like a normal flashbang, and the pov is fucked where you can get headshotted while looking right at someone. and with the introduction of Warden and his Nitro Cell, Blitz is absolutely powerless against Warden. The last thing he needs is a nerf to his speed.
---
1 % of what
---
I liked it better dark. So much room for spooks! We also used to play custom games with the game brightness down to have a real hide and seek.
---
This was like meteor shower you see once every year.
---
She no longer looks like a man.
---
Hell yea dude can't wait till they put out a Somali operator. 
---
But that's wishful thinking.
---
Ah thank you
---
I don't screenshot scoreboards because why would I and idk how many I lost because placements
---
Basically homeless’ wet dream
---
Sometimes the connection from others will hold up a game from starting or after the first round someone will join and their connection will make the game take way too long to load/ they will be lagging so badly they can barely play so the vote to kick helps remove those players from extending wait times before and during games
---
The BattleEye will take all, teammate or not. Dread it, run from it, destiny always-
---
*xXThanos_SnapXx has been banned by BattleEye*
---
I remember when this finally happened 
---
I couldn’t help but cry with happiness and laughter
---
God sake
---
r/LostRedditors
---
So the reason many people vote kick when someone is loading in is due to the fact that it stalks the game from entering the preparation phase until the person joining the game loads in.
---
The screen is supposed to be showing Kali and Wamai, I assume, due to this being the "Get these operators now with the Season Pass" as well as "Operation Shifting Tides" above it.
---
Tbh that spot is Just Ubisoft flexing on new entries, anyway, bandit got even more bamboozled
---
I know what battle eye is and that it bans ppl but I’m on Xbox is there something special with it going on now
---
I never knew you could do this. thank you for the information!
---
Really? wow man i wish i would've bought more of these skins from back then. I thought this one was the sickest then and went on quite a few guns.
---
Imagine it's 1v1, it's the win or lose match, your team is depending on you to make this win. You hear something in your peripherals, there's 20 seconds left... then in the right hand corner you notice words are being displayed, so you look for 1 tiny second and then boom, you're dead because it broke your concentration. True story.
---
It almost certainly does not overcome DotA, but I am curious how many more are added onto that with people who only use uplay and not steam.
---
Literally 99% of players don't use Warden, Hipfire fo all shields are ass, no it's not, his shield is designed to have a different type of flash not like a normal flashbang, and that headshot thing is with all shields, and literally 99% of players don't use Warden. So no, he is not bad or "doesn't need a nerf" he's a very frustrating operator to face in the circumstances, not really on long range maps though.
---
Top 1%.  Everything else, bottom feeders.
---
It was Nomad then. I don't really know either of them too well, because I don't have either of them
---
Its such a tiny hole tho
---
Yeah 50 bucks is 100% worth it thanks
---
I only have a single phrase to describe the people being banned.
---
**"Fuck all of you."**
---
The more you know. Happened to me 3 or 4 times and the most I lost was 2 points.
---
The deluxe edition gives everything EXCEPT the base operators (for some reason), you can get them cheap with only a few games however
---
Someyhing happen?
---
Sounds to me you have no idea how CS works
---
I've had a similar experience to you in ER my first 10 matches were hell I had DDoSers and MnK/ Macro users, but I haven't played any ranked in Shifting tides so idk yet.
---
Yea it be like that sometimes

---
Wrong you moron. Its annoying.
---
That's true, but the playerbase is already divided on this topic so like with most things I think a compromise is needed to try to satisfy both parties since we already have enough issues in the Rainbow Six Siege community. This is honestly a bet I am willing to take and I hope Ubisoft is willing to take also.
---
Well don't post ya memes here
---
Blackbeard is jealous
---
Ohhh. I didn't know that. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Damn, that's  so uninspired. I  hope  we  get more tacticool stuff.
---
So weird that they wait till some people are mid game. Like just ban them as soon as they load the game up. 
---
Also why do they only ban like 20 at a time?
---
This time it even showed that there was enough space.
---
"Error 404: Operator not found."
---
"aww fuck, I can't believe you've done this"

Yeah it should not be displayed in the same area as the kill feed, at least it should not make the kill feed disappear any faster

Oh, old kanal.... damn i miss you.
---
Ayo what the FUCK?? You’re OP
---
It's because CSGO is perfectly balanced. R6S is so full of bugs and other shit that makes the game a headache to play.
---
But thanks for caring to give me directions: been seeing lots of lost redditors these days... have some quite funny examples!
---
all hostiles eliminated.
---
It isn't the worst gun I will say but most people I've met never seem to like it since it takes up a lot of the screen and I've had that experience too since I like guns that are more slick but the ttk is pretty good but like if I'm playing IQ I almost always pick the G8A1 just due to it having a higher rate of fire but that is up to personal preference. I also watch a lot of proleague games and it would be pretty interesting to see if they'll ever use him since if they did that might bump up his pick rate outside of the proleagues since it's already very low.
---
Future tip:
---
Use a phone app like Shazam to get the name of most songs.
---
Don't have the app or want to use it and the song has lyrics? Type in some of the lyrics into any search engine (the more words the better), followed by the word "lyircs". 9/10 you'll get the right result.
---
BattlEye is now maining Fuze
---
why? its a solid song.
---
You look like if quackity had a sister
---
2 turn switch is terrible for other game modes.. one of the worst decisions they could have possibly made.  
---
it's designed for the most balanced game mode.. hostage and secure are not balanced... 2 turn switch makes those game modes even more imbalanced.

Big oof
---
What song is this?
---
Took their time. But doesn’t grieving always start with denial?
---
The video tempo was so close to the song,shoulda slowed it down a bit
---
And isn’t it a little... repetitive? I find repetition distracting!
---
Scum.
---
Gotcha. Nah he definitely didn't play any free weekends. 
---
But still tho,  I would think that if you buy the deluxe edition, you would get base game ops plus deluxe ops. If that's not the case, seems kinda scummy on Ubi's part (I get it tho, more money to be made). 
---
I'll ask him which ones he had to unlock when we play tonight. I remember him saying he had to unlock a bunch of 1k renown ops.
---
Rank plz? There are odee hackers up in plat idk what ur talking about. I get my mmr readjusted very two days
---
an IQ can solve nearly all of Kali's problems with that. Ayyyy team work. I don't think anyone will ever replace the *ease* of use thatcher has, but he's certainly not mandatory these days. Just depends on what your team is picking.
---
Rip OrangeDesert590
---
I would suggest Maverick. My go-to for flanks.
---
IQ is also a pretty solid flanker. She's fast, and her ability allows her to more effectively solo through potentially trapped interiors.
---
Big 🧠
---
let him be, he clearly is justs peaking out of his ass thinking shotguns have the same rules as the other guns
---
It’s heavily implied if not flat out said in your comment that only people who are bad or have low standards play causal. That’s toxic 
---
This might blow your mind, but I, as not op, can see your comments and what you say. I can also reply and give my take on things. I know this is a crazy concept. In fact lots of people who will message you may be strangers you don’t know . This is due to the fact that the internet has lots of users. At least a hundred so there may be people who you don’t know. 
---
It’s also not casual anymore. The name and aspects about it have changed. It’s now quick play. It’s why they Gave it a different name, because it’s a different mode.
---
Yeah, an original outfit is uninspired but the 17th le epic WWII soldier outfits gonna be so epic.
---
F
---
Whos the guy on defense on the far right
---
Also dumb, scopes on a shotgun....
---
I’d say maverick or nomad
---
They really aren’t
---
Not as many as this video, but yes
---
Repetition is easier to tune out IMO. Also I can’t play while listening to music but i drone and prep with music using the Spotify app (Xbox).
---
Got one earlier.
---
New op: hat kid

Shields don’t need a nerf. End of story

Say  what you  will, but  a WW2 outfit is more creative  than random casual  attire.

---
ah yes an intellectual
---
or at all man. its nice to know bans are happening but honestly i couldn't care less that some shitter is getting banned.
---
It's actually pretty good.
---
People do this every season with the new maps. It's because you don't know it yet.
---
Coreross tested this and Jager had priority
---
Wamai pulls it in, Jager destroys it, I believe.
---
Who are the two on the right for defence?
---
when did I say anything about pc parts, and when have you ever heard someone in-game (on console) talk about pc parts? I get spammed by squeelers and burnouts every game I play. So no, that doesn't go both ways at all, bud...
---
Mira showing L
---
Yeah it is different, but trains were causing a lot of confusion. We are going to get used to it anyway so...
---
There is a video I saw yesterday on all of the myth of Operation Shifting Tides and they tried this out and Jager's ADS intercepted the grenade first. Here's a link to the video :)

For every ban is a Fuze bomb
---
Ohhh gonna change my data center and get some premo laggy kills /s
---
Seriously though, I gotta hand to them for really trying to make the game better.
---
I legit reported this aimbotter directly through the Ubisoft ticket system and he is still not banned. Here is proof: [https://youtu.be/DPO1hI4iADw](https://youtu.be/DPO1hI4iADw) here is his profile [https://r6.tracker.network/profile/pc/Biskit69er](https://r6.tracker.network/profile/pc/Biskit69er) I already have 30+ reports already and I have yet to see any of these cheaters banned. No reward. No response. Battleye is total garbage.

Sorry, my keyboard has Spanish English and French and sometimes it doesn't know what I'm writing. So it leaves my messages with a weird meaning.... Which is odd, because it's their first time it has happened in years.

Are they like random players or cheaters?
---
MM in a nutshell
---
Hahaha her voice is annoying

Yessir 👍👍
---
It just doesn’t feel balanced
---
I’m more surprised Netflix made the tweet
---
NØKK FOR THE WIN
---
What if they put angled grip for the sniper
---
So it's like adding flame decals to a car to make it faster...
---
They just changed it this season and everyone hates it. Like if we wanted this, we’d just play unranked
---
Congrats! I just want to make it out of silver this season
---
That's a possibility, there really isn't anyone even with Wamai that can compete against Jager with intercepting grenades because if you use the Mag-NET inside your objective you're still facing the risk of being injured or killed by explosives or fire bolts. I had a bad experience last night with a Mag-NET and Fuze's cluster charge lol, it grabbed them and threw them around the objective and this was Secure Area so it was even worst so I don't think Wamai will replace Jager and him and Kali will probably go down to the pick rates and win deltas of the last two seasons operators as you can see with this:

I mean does his record count tho he kinda cheated tho
---
I'm sorry what?
---
Ping abuse is the exact opposite of what you are saying it is. It is you having high ping, and using that as an advantage to rush enemies. Because of your high ping they can't even see you turn a corner, but you're easily able to shoot them in the half second you're able to see them earlier.

very low

Correct version would be swell

No it impacts the way the shotgun works
---
Yeah and my in game audio gets all distorted when I die or sometimes in mid game and I did a sound check on my headphones and they're fine.
---
You, sir, have just outplayed me
---
Waht they did this time?
---
Credit to original poster is at the bottom of the pic btw.
---
It's so stupid
---
To be honest Warden is still mostly useless with the Nitro cell but it help me get a 4k this morning so it is a welcomed addition to his loadout!
---
Better luck next time chap
---
i think this happens more often than you think it does
---
They will remade two ops and make some for the recent operators like Amaru and Goyo
---
Silver and down is aids, gold is a mix bag,  plat and up you need a squad or horseshoe up your ass if you solo queue
---
It's just a glitch
---
Yeah I would love to do a poll to see how much of the Rainbow Six Siege likes it or if they like Casual.
---
I nitro'd a blitz earlier today as Warden, had a good laugh at how the stupid idiot tried flashing me too.
---
I dont even see them ingame
---
Good stuff my dude. It’s always frustrating when you play a fantastic game and end up losing, but it kind of dampens the pain of a loss if you do that well in my opinion
---
Seems op.
---
Best part is that she'll shit talk defenders when she downs them, she's kinda just a madlad
---
You gotta spin around to counter it lol, I play Montagne a lot when the game mode is Secure Area and that's how I counter Nitro cells and it works 99% of the time lol.
---
How does that even work… are holograms a thing yet?
---
She's just your average person in real life. Granted she doesn't play the game much anymore nowadays, but yeah. She's no psycho or anything, in fact she's a good friend. I guess she just likes doing it for the reaction from other people, because she both used the stealthy cheats as well as the obvious ones where you spinbot around the whole map.
---
I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but, I looked up a lot of these account names, and most of them were pretty clearly banned  as far back as a year ago.  It looks like battleye is just double banning previously banned accounts.
---
Agreed
---
As others have said, you get it when the season ends. But note that if you raise your rank by the time it's over you will receive the charm for the highest rank you achieved during the season. You're so close to Gold, so keep playing!
---
The wall literally just birthed a dead Fuze.
---
the answer is yes if you slow it down i shot through the umbrella for the head shot.
---
Sledge, Hibana, Jackal, Dokkaebi, Nøkk and Kali.

Thanks for karma kind stranger
---
My guy has a core stronger than the center of the earth
---
I hope they rework her Scorpion because that thing will never get picked by anyone playing console due to its random recoil.
---
O//w\\O
---
My bad
---
Ive gotten a couple aces with it. Fastest one was about 36 seconds after the round started. Most of that was getting to obj  because he not sanic like ash be
---
I really enjoy the new theme park
---
I hope to God they don't buff her. I hate Ela more than I hate lesion.
---
Ban waves have been heavy lately
---
no
---
Thanks, now every time I hear this song all I will think of is Hat Kid dancing
---
Yeah for sure. It's been a while since I've played with less than at least 3 people in stack, but I see the toxic shit from time to time on PC. Its really easy to just mute them in move on, but then again I still have the friends with me. 
---
Official discord probably has some people you can reach out to at your relative skill level to maybe make some new friends. Other than that, if you find even just one other person being polite in lobby, add them. See where it goes. Good luck! I know it's rough out there.
---
Did anyone else notice the 3 punch holes in one of the walls are still in the rework?
---
Πρεεεεεεττυυ γοοδ μυ μαν
---
Have they banned for no reason?
---
Honestly your best bet is just level up then  hit ranked. It'll start off worse but nothing but ranked represents the game.
---
I thought it was really good actually..
---
Old theme park wasn’t even that bad imo
---
Why did you replace the original Kali with this one? Doesn't even look anywhere like the in-game character
---
Prediction 100
---
Sorry to be that guy but posting on reddit isn’t going to help. Have you tried contacting Ubisoft to resolve your problem?
---
Well if they trow the grenade they are responsible for damage
---
yup i included the screenshots of the 2 matches i played with them
---
Close but nope
---
For April Fools I just want every weapon with ACOG
---
I tried searching and it put all us south Africans in an EU server so the whole lobby had 200 ping
---
ik, really hate cheaters
---
Hello and welcome. Genuinely mean welcome. 
---
When R6 siege first kicked off this community was amazing and supportive of new players, after about 18 months it’s gained a lot of toxic players from other games and the toxicity became the focal point of many posts. Which is why you see the new play options like unranked and newcomer which is suppose to help reduce this.
---
Unfortunately you can’t stop people from being pricks, they do it because they think it’s funny and are just out and out dick heads. 
---
Majority of the community isn’t like this but it’s still a significant amount that is. 
---
Stick it through and you’ll meet good people.
---
r/PhotoshopRequest
---
Honestly it doesn't feel like a bunch of clumped up rooms to me. Sure, there are some nasty corners and what not, but it's not all hard to drone with clutter. It's all pretty straight forward honestly. They also made it much easier to get in the doors/windows with immediate cover so you don't have to contest 3 angles at one time (heres to you outback). 
---
New maps can be frustrating, for sure. Especially when you knew the old one very well. You might warm up to it after some time.
---
Nypa
---
for hibana , i meant as a main weapon , not as a pistol replacement
---
Who would they switch? Besides Warden I can’t think of anyone that would work on offense
---
I don’t think going blond is considered a buff.
---
OP is clearly not joking.
---
This was posted already bucko
---
Siege is on Origin and Uplay on top of Steam. A lot of other uplay games are on origin too, like The Crew, Ghost Recon Wildlands and Far Cry 5.
---
Wdym? It’s obvious Ubisoft stole it from Police force arms
---
lol the toxicity got to ya head fam dont let the anger follow you off the game cmon now
---
with frost you lose out on the extended barrel. the extra damage it provides at long range can be good since the gun  has practically no recoil.
---
r/siegeacademy
---
Actually you are right, just checked and the leaker said it was "soon".
---
it looks like a headshot to me, just at the very bottom of the hitbox
---
The fact that she is Japanese makes it so much better
---
pretty sure ela and zof have special DBNO interactions because they didnt get their own season so ubi gave them special interactions to compensate.
---
Mr Clancy I don't feel so good
---
That’s hilarious.
---
I'd love some more furry stuff

You caught me, I’m really an Ubisoft PR rep trying to cover up the real truth
---
Smoke 2.0
---
So....
---
I kind of feel like this was a potato cover up.
---
It's mostly a mechanics thing. Attackers have to come in the building. They gete lots of goodies to open up lines of sight from further away and what not. They get, in general, much stronger/long range guns because of that. 
---
The defenders get to, in general, dictate how they take engagements on their terms. After all, they just have to guard the objective. Not attack it (unless something goes terribly wrong). So because of that, and the fact they're usually forced to be in the close angles they usually get those SMGs.
---
I saw that yesterday it’s great
---
Smoke, Frost, Kapkan, Lesion theres a bunch
---
I actually looked for it and didn't see it, but thanks, I deleted.

It’s 4:3 on an ultra wide monitor

Oh shit typo sorry

Honestly if they make you vomit just move on to the next person
---
Lol all good mate
---
Shut up you fuckin troglodyte you’re probably just as shit as that echo is
---
Not for the same account for other account that had the game in uplay
---
Damn, shamed to everyone who plays, or just your regional servers?
---
Well, I know what you are saying but they could have just thrown a C4 or they could have stunned my with echo or they could have come to kill me from the back
---
invalid :(
---
Extra honey mussy and dewy plzzz
---
Tickets are free
---
No there’s no way to transfer accounts youd have to buy it again and even if you used the same Uplay account your stats wont transfer.
---
DMR weak as shit. For comparison, it does less damage and has a smaller mag size than Blackbeard’s.
---
That’s the only reason I don’t play ranked. I have young kids running around and I have to get off when ever they need me. I understand your frustration, that’s why I keep myself of those servers.
---
i dont think they understand. hackers and cheaters if you play with hacks,cheats whatever, it dont mean your good at the game    please go back to fortnite we dont want plebs in this community
---
Idk is was to fun for siege so they removed it.
---
I don't think so. The elite is 100% finished, it would be a waste. It will either be a battlepass reward or released later
---
Dat zie je correct!
---
Yeah your right that’s a good point
---
Unless of course they [pull the plug](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/07/739316746/microsoft-closes-the-book-on-its-e-library-erasing-all-user-content) on the service.

Yes thy could have but again they’re bad players which is why its not something to boast about. Its like me a fully grown adult going into a preschool and fist fighting every child in there. Of course they dont stand a chance theyre young and dont know what they’re doing

Ela was probably delayed because of her nerf. Or she's a battlepass reward ( her name is in the leaked list of rewards )

I've gotten maybe 90% of my aces when I play with friends and I'm not worrying about how I play. When I get mad and overthink, I play like shit

I would pay a fortune for a LEGO 6 Siege set. Just shut up and take my fucking money!

Mozzie is probably supposed to be the Lord instead

You just sweated on him lol

The additional stuff is stuff that he can get for free. It is a lot faster to just get him a more expensive game, but only if you think he needs it.

I was literally just making a point and you came in here trying to troll to get a reaction. Maybe instead of coming at someone with insults with no substance you go back to your little cum filled den and write some better material

It’s honest work my friend

It does sound interesting. But Ubi would bite your ass due to copyright.

My most recent find has been in the animated Starwars show from Disney called “Star Wars Rebels”. So far I’ve caught it twice. I’m thinking they are slipping it in once per season. Was literally just watching an episode and heard the scream.

There's an unacknowledged by Ubisoft rappel animation glitch that happens sometimes-if you watch closely, Buck's animation jumps a good distance to his left when he exits the rappel.  Apparently, he's not really where it looks like he is.  I've had it happen to me before, and there have been other videos like yours posted.  If you don't see what I'm talking about, when Buck is at the top of his rappel, his left foot is to the right of that little "block" just under the roof ledge, but when he exits his rappel onto the roof, his left foot is on the left side of that block.

Oh I don’t know

Man just wanted an ace

But it’s a charm
