Sometimes, you just have to keep words to yourself.

Super police LoL

I couldn‚Äôt agree more man, nothing better than a good game with a solid community to back it up
---
Like toy story toys when no ones looking
---
How I look when my mom yells at me in the middle of a game
---
The more games you play in a season, the less points you get/lose per gane
---
The old throwing mechanics...
---
There are 2 things, first the game take time to get good at alot of the time when someone buys the gsme they don't lile how slow the game is which drives them to not play it. So if you are looking to play make sure you even like that play style, next is that there are tons of people who smurf in low levels so that will most likely be a problem in playing but after a while they will fade away
---
Ubi yyyyyy?
---
Catherine Zeta Jones, she dips beneath the lazers
---
Don't try it

This is literally the best thing
---
What do you mean exactly by slow?
---
when the hostage realizes he can just leave whenever
---
If you‚Äôre on Defense, DDoSing until the round is over means you win that round.

Here‚Äôs a comment I made explaining it

I second, also, happy cake day
---
nice
---
there are copies of ac, the devision, r6, rayman and
---
Splitercell on the default site next to what looked like a Nintendo 64
---
I just realized, the ability is nearly useless on tower
---
We already have poor Nokk whose gadget is not only selfish but also pretty underwhelming.
---
However, I feel like if the new Attacker can really flank hard with her gadget, it might be enough to make her viable.
---
good joke
---
yeah so basically you‚Äôre taking about Cav
---
Use your drone 
---
The game will take time to get good at, people can only tell you so much. But a lot of getting better at this game comes from learning the maps, how they play, and common player tendencies and spots.
---
Thx didn‚Äôt even notice
---
 Unplayable
---
it‚Äôs not. read the sub rules before posting
---
I'm sorry. I just dont see. Your op and the new seem different to me. You cant claim that becuase they both have exploding tanks that they are the same. An explosive tank is a unique idea. Propane vs gas can. Being placed on a shield vs a wall. To me atleast, they look different and their names are nowhere near similar. I just don't see it.
---
Cant wait to see what new (or old) glitches will come with the new season.
---
I seen all Austin powers but borderlands was first thing that came to mind
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs my first one.
---
I don't get it, someone explain me please.(maybe i Don't understand because I'm from Argentina, so, please)
---
Man are you missing out. You need to go watch Austin powers ASAP
---
Then I would say it‚Äôs a little bad
---
Hager?
---
I have a question do you guys think the volcan is the whole shield or just the red explosive that can be attached to any ops deployable shield. Because the shield looks like the reworked deployable we were supposed to get a while ago
---
Probably copper 4 on your server and diamond on the other server
---
For example diamond in EU is the rank that would show up on r6tracker. But if he‚Äôs copper in US and playing US servers with you that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll see in game
---
Changing a name and ctu doesnt change the fact that they are mechanically the same thing (excluding the location of placement)
---
Ood
---
I mean, killing the enemy provides a ton to the team.
---
Wait.
---
OP didn't stalk my profile?
---
He didn't attack me for my beliefs yet?
---
Oh my...
---
It was. You couldn‚Äôt even look out of windows as a defender it was so bright
---
that's a lot of text for a two second video clip.
---
We do what we must
---
I sometimes use 2x reading glasses for cheeky optical zoom
---
Speed will be a factor.
---
They were this close to greatness
---
You cann'ot be sorry enoguh.  Why donn'ot you just go and go?
---
Then don‚Äôt rush
---
Yeah but in the r&amp;d report its says shes way more agile and more easier to use on windows and overall better at rappeling and entering than all the other ops
---
I don't know, looks like it may be pretty fast.  I mean, if she takes a hatch direct into OBJ.... Yes.
---
But give her a silenced shotty secondary.... And she'd be a pretty solid rush/push op
---
you know nothing about balancing an operator
---
I go the long way of taking map photos and filtering them to black and white, then color coding each op different... Or... I'll take screenshots of mira setups or valk cam setups of stuff like that and then use an app to put all 5 setups in 1 pic for ease. 
---
It' about a 20-40 min process but the team I play with says it helps.
---
what, I hate people who rush..that's why rushing sucks
---
What if someone mistaken the rappling and got launched into a wall creating a new door ?
---
Ohhhh thanks! Sorry didn‚Äôt know good to know
---
Almost as good as twitch's tickle drones
---
Yeah its ok, we'll know on sunday. hopefully she can also rappel off a hatch too
---
The took down the ones on the building though.
---
ahh whatever people on this sub rely on it for cheap wins anyway
---
*being toxic*
---
*Aztec dubstep intensifies*
---
Ohh okay... Thanks
---
Yeah I'm seeing she's more better for windows but what's the point in having a grapple hook if she's meant for windows.
---
I hope she can pull her gun out while she's going up.
---
and you're sure it's not your team
---
So 4 or more weeks ago you played with a hacker that got banned 
---
You gain points too if you lost with a hacker it just acts like the game never happened
---
Honestly I couldn‚Äôt care less if they recycled weapons
---
Thanks for the input
---
Imagine if fuze was chasing the hostage with the cluster charge in his hand

so using her for hatches is risky and almost pointless? she can just go up hatches in other objective rooms that are empty right?
---
I hope she has a secondary shotgun and doesn't need a Hibana that would suck.
---
Lol
---
When you play with newer players in your squad you get those unlocks. So when they hit lvl 5 and get custom games you'll get that notification too. Same with lvl 30 when they unlock ranked.

Getting boosted by a cheater probably ?

Wait a minute . I see a keyboard and a PS4 ? Such a dirty fucker

This video is cursed in itself

I would flat out delete the game if I died to this person

Although he uses a MnK on PS4

He wants the season pass.....

[removed]
---
Its the most fair and competitive game mode
---
The entire game is broken and ubisoft wont fix it
---
yeah you're right. I can't remember if drones can jump over electrified shields without getting shocked but that could be another potential issue
---
I know. I was just being a troll.
---
Lol. Boosting DDoSer. I bet HE makes posts saying ‚Äúwill boost coppers and bronzes to Gold‚Äù as soon as they reach Silver 4 they get kicked.
---
Then say r/woooosh and i'll accept it
---
&gt; I know it's bad
---
Yeah, so bad done that my heart is broken again because it looks real BUT I CANT GET IT!
---
Proof
---
For me it was the same. I guess when you kill someone and he dies while breaching the game thinks you killed him with a breach matt or they just give out the achievement time after time to every player since it is very hard to get this one especially with the changes to the breach matt
---
When in the history of siege where that Kaid‚Äôs  AUG was ever better than bandit‚Äôs MP7?
---
yeah if only we had a separate sub for memes or something...oh well maybe some day

Honestly

He asked what's new in the last 12 months....

The Hereford Base rework is really bad.

Woosh

Is this what ranked is like because I sure hope so. I‚Äôm only level 26-27 so I haven‚Äôt played ranked yet but I‚Äôm hoping that people actually use vc to be helpful rather than annoying like casual. The guys in this clip are helpful even though I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre in a pre made team.
---
so how many games are you team killed then?
---
The game goes on sale but Season Passes don‚Äôt and you won‚Äôt have the preorder bonuses either most likely.
---
the TTS will hit 19th or 20th of this month next week . The full reveal on 18th
---
Thanks üëåüèº
---
But she's fun and is one of the best good looking ops
---
that's irrelevant to the quality of console; there's a reason why m&amp;k is a problem on console, because playing with a controller is intentionally handicapping yourself. Its like csgo on xbox 360, some games just arent made for console. the moment you actually try pc siege you literally will not be able to go back without having an actual aneurysm
---
you done fucked up showing mnk son
---
That was the season where I joined rainbow six. I even remember despising Blackbeard back then and I didn‚Äôt even enjoy playing him
---
The best gun on attack is the f2 even before the ash nerf
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the exact name for them is but they are red, concave, and are the same height for both sticks. They are the taller kind.
---
Is this possible to use with wallpapper engine?
---
yeah well try being a legitimate bronze player gettting tossed by plats in copper because its what the cool kids do.
---
I believe it was most people startimg point but i played beta and played since but blackbeard was unappealing to me at the time and still cant seem to stay alive as long as someone else playijg him.
---
Doc : Please hurry . I have bandit's drugs
---
Literally unplayable
---
No problem.
---
the short answer : 
---
#GET A SQUAD
---
Yeah Ash is a nice gun, not gonna lie.
---
Hmm, how would that look w/ red, like the dot from the flag?
---
Plot twist: they actually didn‚Äôt talk, they communicated using spoopyness
---
Wraith king, slark, troll warlord are solid options as carry right now they can fight early-mid, amd do well on laye game.
---
In late game, spectre is very good too, also counters some mets cores (like slark and troll).
---
 In midlane, ember spirit is a beast right now, and windranger melts people with just a javelin. Also, alchemist is back (sometimes as pos1, but mostly as pos 2) and depending on the setup zeus can be an option.
---
I dont playo other positions that much, but centaur warruner and dark seer are pretty good as offlaner, as well as warlock and chen in the position 4.
---
Of course there are lots of options, i personally dont play almost any of those heroes lol
---
Damnit Goobi, why?
---
I don‚Äôt like the elo system. At an certain point it is just frustrating.
---
I am Gold 2 and get 60 Points per win so it will be very hard for me to achieve my plat 3 goal for this season especially in solo q. I did it before but it is still a bummer.
---
it was probably delayed sometimes i get trophies like 2 minutes after i do the achievement
---
I don't know how much have you been around the "competitive fps world" but Bombs are always the game mode chosen for the developers to create their competitive scene. Basicaly Secure the area isn't fair enough for both sides because it would be 5 people holding the point waiting for the attackers without moving. That's why bomb is different. It offers a variety of options and not just one target  so teams has to create strategy around all the possibilities.  Also it gives more emotion to the situation ( In hight level competitive gaming for example).
---
In my opinion if they would add  Secure the area to ranked that would be a pain in the ass for whoever has to attack first because the basic meta for the defenders would be like full "anchor" agents with a lot of traps so no one would be able to enter the area.
---
There‚Äôs 5% of the playerbase in plat3, if not even more. It‚Äôs a higher number.
---
While creating a wallpaper in WE,there are a lot of presets that you can apply.The falling leaves were a preset , you have 5 types of leaves and I picked sakura. 
---
The remaining circular visualizer , time date , song identifier were from another software called rainmeter . They were all pre-made and I had to just import them
---
It's a new operation
---
Is that the tts
---
As a j√§ger main I approve
---
He wasn't a bad player, it was just the peeks and aim of the other team.
---
Look on the bright side. U WENT POSITIVE AGAINST A TEAM OF DIAMONDS
---
The top one is a teaser for the new season and the bottom one is a screenshot from the operator video for Jager. They are just in the same testing facility. It‚Äôs just cool because they have continuity from years apart

I played with a 3 stack of throwers who tked and left the first round. Seriously why isn't their like bots from csgo or the cancel the match from overwatch
---
I mean I can tell you are on console due to RB in the menu so MnK could have been in play on the other team.
---
implying you havent done stupid shit in your life
---
I know but apparently ,even if you have already got drops from previous events you have to activate the drops again. Something  I think is dumb as fuck tbh. Because I have already my account linked so why would I have to link it again to get the drops....
---
your watch time has been useless. how are people not reading the twitch drop part where it's on the 16-18 lol

Love this guy reaction

I came back yesterday after 8 months off and i'm loving it. Im on pc though, so the tk issue isn't as bad as console. It all seems pretty much the same other than new ops

Might work if you were running it at 4k.
---
Ranked is competitive but i feel like it shouldnt be so competitive to the point it feels like pro league.  The devs took all of the pro league atributes and put it in regular ranked. I just wanna have a more competitive game mode where it has more variety to it instead of the same mode and the same couple of maps.

That's what you call a "tactical mobility vehicle"

What is this
---
Data limits
---
(‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢)

 So I was playing ranked, and I go paired with a fucking idiot that wastes his time, by using hacks and making the wait time longer. I've been in this game waiting for at least an hour or two. Why is R6's anticheat so bad that they cant ban people like this.
---
Too real
---
yah it‚Äôs a new glitch. happened with me and i joined three different games!! i lost around 260 elo and i was super salty
---
Bruh thats google adsense, Its not r6 stats purposefully adding boosting services to the site. 
---
Thats based on your search history. Google knows that its a gaming site, R6s site and that you like r6s/stats.
---
I think he was going for the memes. Counter-memed

They have a copy of rb6, watchdogs, assassins creed and another I cant remember all on the shelf together.

Its an automatic ad.

Wait, if your grapple hits a person can you yet yourself into them just cause style

That happened to me once. On one of my other accounts I only had ash and sledge but for some reason they banned ash and my teammate went sledge so it auto picked me to recruit.

No he's using the same exact shield as the one coming with Ember Rise, What's the point in that because last season we got re-used guns now we're getting a reused shield.

How do you change the optics triangle to a dot?

-console players will get mad getting rekt by MORE MnK

-the percentage of ddos will increase dramatically on pc

nah i'm good

it would be difficult for Ubi to unify ps4, Xbox, and PC accounts together and all that type of thing. also this would have to be casual only otherwise it would pretty much ruin ranked

Wrong, as much as he wants to be able to, Kaid will never be able to bandit trick

When you miss that first shot with your pistol: Animal instinct takes over, all faith in your own ability is gone, and you either channel the elder gods to pull something like this out yer butt, or get rekt.
---
It varies on the reason I can pretty much always come up with an excuse for dying whether it be my team8s fault or something somebody did or I was listening to music etc. it also depends on the skill level of the game
---
10/10 masterpiece
---
All we know is that it can be placed on a shield. That's like watching a Bandit video and saying ubi is running out of ideas since he is places the battery on the same shield.
---
But I've been playing since release. I miss being able to hop on and play ranked with a bunch of chill dudes in gold 4. Now it seems like peoples personalities are taking a shit.
---
You only need one to trick two walls though!

I started in Red Crow. I hate that they nerfed the lighting. It's great that they fixed it when looking outdoors as a Defender (it used to be blinding, but it was meant to be somewhat realistic). But at the same time, the game's overall lighting, even indoor, was way better before. I play at 1440p with HD textures on PC, and I still think the game used to look better at 1080p with the better lighting (before I got my new monitor).

...we don‚Äôt speak of those bots..

Wow you're right, if he was playing ranked his whole P90 mag would've registered
---
Some people turn off the points notifications because they appear at the side of the screen, while you should be looking at the center of it, helps focus. I tried it, but didn't like it all that much, but the change isn't that big.
---
Why couldn't it be permanent :(
---
Level 3 bots will deflect you before you even spawn in
---
I believe they are limiting what ranks can play with each other, so like gold 2 is lowest with a diamond, or play 3 and gold IV
---
He was being sarcastic
---
I think this could be legit look at the gun if looks like it's definitely designed in the siege engine and the attachments are exact matches to the siege ones. in Killzone they look different. if it's fake somebody wasted an awfull amount of time

Lol sledge thought he was about to be the hero.
---
Male sure to drone efficiently and use the map vertically, if the point is on the 2nd floor then use breach charges on the 3rd floor to peak from above.
---
Siege is a game of angles, find the ones that work for you on each map and refine them; open up the walls, they can give you some of the best angles.
---
Also find the sensitivity for you, most people I see on siege (console) play around 25-30. I personally play with 50 (vertical) and 40 (horizontal), I find that this allows me to flick to heads easier and still maintain control of the gun.
---
Your patch notes are from 2 years ago. Ela's been nerfed recoil wise 3 times. Once vertically,  twice horizontally. The once horizontally which came in Grim Sky, after your precious patch note thete made it random.
---
Again you're proven wrong,  so I'll take your white flag of defeat now.
---
thats a little much but would be intresting. i think they could try that in a test thing and se how it works out.
---
Who's ready to die on a Zipline? ***I am***
---
It's fine with me if they leave while I'm doing it but it's when they can leave before hold F on them that bothers me
---
Thanks. Hope mine works tomorrow.
---
Good one
---
You done fucked up not seeing that the ps4 is off.
---
I have 3 consoles connected to my capture card into my monitor, and I play siege on PC.
---
Guess I am a mkb aswell.
---
literally me
---
I play on pc too
---
yeah, nobody will ever hear you and just shoot you in the fucking face. And people are always just standing around in the middle of the kitchen waiting to get shot through the window, right? Totally. Makes a lot of sense.
---
I mean plat 3 is still top 18 percent or so not 25% but yeah I get your point
---
For honor bots still haunt my nightmares, they are faster, stronger and smarter and they know it, they taunt you with their dickish fight techniques and complete absence of every form of honor
---
Just r6 things

Although he doesn't, and has several consoles and a PC.

You‚Äôre thinking far to logical, especially with a community that lives their memes

Acog on the turret or the smg?

But being trash is the first step to being sorta good so don't worry and keep grinding

This is interesting. It seems less effective for digital artwork from this description. But I'm sure it has some use and idk enough to tell how much specifically

The bug is back?

I'm not exactly a diamond but it's like I pick up this gun and I forget where my right stick is
---
I have 54 hours &amp; (1.2 k/d for reference ) on Valkyrie to back my statement and I can conclude the MPX is trash and let's me down very often, this why I no longer main valk.
---
You are already using an acog though. You basically have an 8x scope now
---
Sounds good

you can‚Äôt buff a god

15/5 cute points
---
I mean they could give him a slightly different gun, so they could balance him independently. It would still start out with basically the same stats bu then could be tweaked to make it balanced with a acog
---
ACOG on the shotgun.
---
Coz shes too op to be 1
---
So no official numbers? I know that on some of those stats websites, they only have information on searched character names, so the higher your rank the more likely you look up yourself or opponents. The numbers could be inaccurate.
---
ok
---
Oh alright that‚Äôs what I wanted to know I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell , thanks
---
Hmm... the force is strong with this one
---
Wow sorry I didn't expect Beaulo in my comment section
---
Not gonna lie, the Lion is me. "Roamer?! That means use scanny drone"
---
I've lost track of the number of times I've had to tell the Frost to take their mat off that window.
---
I desperately want to be good with it but it so inconsistent in terms of damage and even recoil, the chart isn‚Äôt as accurate as I‚Äôd like
---
That‚Äôs why I think a proximity style mine would be best
---
I‚Äôd only talk shit if I couldn‚Äôt do that situation better but the fact that I could makes my point reasonable especially with u admitting you potatoed that hard. That doesn‚Äôt mean your aim overall is shit only in that specific situation
---
Imagine being able to Castle barricade hatches
---
Buy Maestro. He has one of the best defender weapons in the game, and has one of the most useful gadgets. 
---
If you love Doc, then Maestro is basically Doc that cannot heal himself. 
---
After all, Doc is an anchor with good guns and bulletproof cameras, Maestro's weapon is better AND his bulletproof camera shoots lasers.
---
Nokk is a selfish operator with no utility, and she's also weak. Terrible weapons as well results in Nokk getting out-gunned by almost every defender because their weapons are better.
---
I understood that reference

Congratulations, you would have done better in the specific circumstance I repeatedly claim to have handled poorly. Why are you even commenting?

I seen this video and was wondering...is this shit really coming in next update? Lmao

It is a whiny thing, for sure. It's also accurate, for Siege's matchmaking. :P

---
"No, I did NOT drink my mushroom juice before queueing up."
---
Is that a new Bandit trick?
---
Cause I‚Äôm at work and doesn‚Äôt have anything better to do right now
---
Or maybe give him a gas mask and make him immune/take less damage at lower rate from Smoke canisters
---
We need someone else who can entrap projectiles and make them redundant, just like Jager. The issue at the moment is that Jager has a very high pick rate with part of this coming down to having a gadget that no other defender has in terms of mechanics and importance. 
---
This is why I came up with this operator idea. Her name is Pitcher ‚Äî&gt; 
---
Pitcher is equipped with 2 MK12 LDD‚Äôs (Localised Detonation Disperser). Each device can be placed on the floor only, and contains 3 redundancy projectiles each. The device will launch one of these redundancy projectiles at any incoming projectile. That projectile is then encased in a fabric that absorbs the blast and makes it redundant. The neat part of this gadget is that the fabric still allows all sound of that device to be emitted so a grenade will still make the explosion sound, a candela still makes its unique sound etc. The difference is that the effects of it are completely negated. The mind games and counter play options are very high with this gadget, which is always good to see. 
---
As this device isn‚Äôt actually destroying the projectile, instead encasing it, it means the device is a lot quieter overall making it less obvious overall further adding benefit to your team as it is likely to fool the enemy a great deal more. 
---
Another interaction I‚Äôd like to see if that they can entrap Capitao‚Äôs arrows if they pass over it‚Äôs radius. This is a nice mechanic and buff to your team if you pick Pitcher.
---
Pitcher would be a 2 armour, 2 speed defender. This is to have a clear distinction between her and J√§ger. She‚Äôd also have a completely unique weapon selection, with only having shotguns available to choose from. These would be the DP-12 double barrel pump shotgun or the SRM 1226. As for equipment, she‚Äôd have C4 and a BP camera. Another note to make is that she wouldn‚Äôt have access to a machine pistol. It always occurs that the machine pistol becomes the primary for that operator and I don‚Äôt want that. I‚Äôd say give her some stronger pistols such as a nice handling revolver and maybe a high damage pistol. 
---
A balancing change I‚Äôd want to make before Pitcher would be introduced would be to lower the amount of ADS‚Äôs that Jager has down to 2 (from 3), therefore stopping only 4 projectiles. This means that j√§ger just isn‚Äôt the better option in all situations and that if you pick Jager, you‚Äôll have a good gadget but it protects you from less projectiles overall. This means there is a real choice between the two. This is completely necessary and would be a great way to keep both viable when completing with each other and means that if both are run together, you can‚Äôt stop an absurd amount of projectiles overall
---
I agree. They watch pro league or pengu stream where he says it made him more Keen on sounds. They want to be like the pros so bad they do it for the swag factor when there is absolutely no need.
---
Don't use it seriously then why do you complain about it?
---
There isn't a solid fix I can provide you with. It just started working again after a couple hours.
---
You can add me on Uplay @HIR2001. I play Siege a lot. If you also want some nice people to play with then you can join the Discord server that I'm part of. [https://discord.gg/C9tXrW](https://discord.gg/C9tXrW)
---
I think he would be way to op at that point. 
---
Think about it, last 20 seconds, pop a smoke and it would be pretty difficult for attackers to counter.
---
"I'll show you why my reinforcements have to be bulletproof..."
---
No problem. Also note that receiving the charms may take a few days after the event ends.
---
Bruh imagine having an attacker just yeet themselves through a window
---
They didnt deem nokk too op to have one she didnt get it because the fmg doesnt have an acog
---
Technically doesn't recruit have all the weapons from the main operators when it was released?
---
They said it could not be done
---
That's the answer i got when i started playing
---
It's probably still the same
---
many newer players crouch walk a shitton. that's about the only thing i can think of tbh. also when its a callout, it could be for prefire.
---
It isn‚Äôt, sneaking is impossible except your name is cav or nokk, test it out.
---
A lot of pro players and I‚Äôve seen many community members saying the same thing. A simple search on the inter web will highlight this.  
---
And if they increase the audio of it for it to be realistic, then they‚Äôll have to increase movement audio overall. If they want to keep crouch walking the quietest while still clearly audible, a full rework would be needed. This isn‚Äôt going to happen. 
---
This game is hardly realistic so I see no problem increasing its audio significantly so it‚Äôs clear. Just keep it as loud as a 2 speed operator (most common) moving around. Easy fix that allows it to be heard
---
would be kinda useless considering warden is defence op. also, have you ever tried to push thru as a smoke after throwing the babe? it rarely works
---
Fucking goofy
---
Not useless if Smoke and Warden can coordinate a hold, with Warden lying in Smoke's smoke with his glasses.
---
And I was never talking about an attacker push through Smoke :)
---
That is so not true.  You can have just as much success with Ash, or IQ just crouch walking around as you can with Cav or Nokk. Only plus Cav has is that she can sprint a little quieter. Still doesn‚Äôt add much in comparison though
---
Even then they can just aim nearby and it should still destroy it (i think)
---
Rainbows used to be just a cool color scheme that a lot of people liked. Now it can‚Äôt be used without being associated with LGBT. I got nothing against them but still kinda wish they picked something that wasn‚Äôt something already widely used. The disappointment can go both ways.
---
&lt;3
---
pushing AS smoke was what I was talking about
---
defender push
---
POLICE FORCE | ARMS
---
You don't push as Smoke, you hold as Warden *inside or close to canister smoke*
---
Lemme guess, wanna get 69,420 renown?
---
Can give some
---
why would you want to do that
---
No i want to get more 1st year ops
---
Nice
---
The same reason you're recommending smokes for Warden - his goddamn ability
---
Need a better gaming chair
---
I'm very confused did they make the jager test into a real thing?
---
&gt; A lot of pro players and I‚Äôve seen many community members saying the same thing. A simple search on the inter web will highlight this.
---
That doesn't mean that it's not meant to be that quiet.
---
&gt;Just keep it as loud as a 2 speed operator (most common) moving around. Easy fix that allows it to be heard
---
But that's a fucking stupid change
---
What was his ping?
---
I didn‚Äôt
---
What everybody else said, I don‚Äôt know what first person shooter you come from but for at least the first month you‚Äôre going to get the shit kicked out of you. Just like all the rest of us. Stick it out though and it is still one of the best shooters I‚Äôve played.
---
However, the player base is still huge and rainbow six isn‚Äôt going anywhere for sometime. I am pretty sure the developers said they‚Äôre going to get to 100 operators so we definitely have plenty of criteria left.
---
Europe, haven't played much na lately, but have been diamond there too. Currently plat 3 or 2 on na, but i try to avoid it unless buddys of mine from that region want to play due to my unfair peekers advantage.
---
Wish I had my pc is not strong enough to run recording/shadowplay and the game at once
---
Wtf I wonder why this keep on happening, It happen to me as well.
---
That was hot

only one and only the highest

Not fair that out of the original ctu‚Äôs the americans have 8 Operators and everyone else at least 5 while the Germans still have 4

Not sure if it‚Äôs true, but I could see why it would be. Letting a bunch of young kids play your M rated game at a public event would be bad news

it's actually a common skin for the other spetsnaz pistol , The GSH-18

I played a few games on EU servers just to see how much of an advantage pinging is and it‚Äôs really bad. Makes the game completely unfair and it seems like more and more people are pinging now which sucks. What do you think about what I said about EU vs NA?

And let it grow

what no it's probably the most defender sided map in the game
---
It's translucent from the Seven.
---
Please teach me Lord!
---
Zofia lol
---
lol what? It's literally one of the worst maps in terms of attack - top floor is barely winnable if you don't kill the guy behind tractor... why do you think most people want the map gone from the ranked map pool?
---
So... Why do they need that message then?
---
I love how they basically walked up to you thinking they were completely invisible and capable of knifing you.
---
The game is not that broken, the op is just trying to boost his account playing along a bronze player. The matchmaking probably tries to match the mmr of both team so he likely played against bronze/silver. If anything he totally deserved that.
---
Well there‚Äôs a plat 2 on the enemy team so somebody else is boosting

I didn't reply to you then because honestly I couldn't  come up with a big enough reply to your mammoth of a reply, but I can now.
---
Neithe J√§ger nor bandit need to see a massive drop in pick rate upon the introduction of an alternative. Bandit didn't, and J√§ger won't either. It's but natural that a 3 speed will get preference. But even a noticeable drop is enough to ease the load. There're absolutely no balance issues with J√§ger or bandit. So they most definitely don't need a nerf. Kaid is there because of his own disadvantages, not due to him being outshined by bandit. Same will be the case with J√§ger. Situational drop in pick rate is sufficient. Tell me I'm wrong, but bandit is nowhere near his pre-kaid pick rate after kaid was introduced. And bandit has see no Nerfs either. I can give it in writing with my blood signature that J√§ger will see the same treatment.
---
And true pick rates are only seen in PL where the ops are use at their fullest potential. In ranked, solo plats and diamonds will cause bandit's and J√§ger's pick rates to sky rocket, which isn't credible data to buff or nerf. Kaid is used sufficiently in PL and that's ok.
---
Yep.
---
We'll have this discussion elsewhere.
---
Part of the problem is just ignoring it or padding against it, not everyone has some insta squad to jump on their dick at a moment's notice. Ubisoft could do more about this, no fucks given so far though, beyond a reverse fire strategy that can easily be used to troll.
---
Lmao, the old map was so easy to attack. Jackal could probably win it on his own
---
Yeet
---
Zofia
---
Well yeah I do, but like - why is pulse the Duracell bunny? It doesn't make sense. Is it because she can see electronics through walls and she can see the battery on his back similarly to how she can see his cardiac sensor? I don't get it.

Small changes i recommend, The claw should do different things.
---
On normal shields (Fuze, Recruits) it slows them down and stops them running.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On Blitz, it disables his flash and running
---
On Monty, it hurts him but only when his shield is extended.
---
To get rid of the claw, they must hit a wall with the shield.
---
The claw should also have the setup timing thing like normal
---
Anyone know why the disconnect sign is shown on my alpha packs??
---
Now I'm no tec geek, but I'm pretty sure client side hacks can't affect server side results of the game. If other people are seeing it, then it's server side and not due to anything a hacker did. It could be a fail safe encase the game detects anything fishy.
---
She's a slav.
---
Not many times fortunately, but here and there you get a 2 or 3 stack and if I don't do what they want, they kill me or kick me oout of the match, and the worst is, usually I'm playing better than them =(
---
Most likely a fail safe encase the game detects anything fishy.
---
Argue stupid shit? 
---
You are the one who said that Epi " literally stated the tried her without the ACOG and it was still a powerful gun" when in fact that person never said it.
---
Lion is imbalanced but still broken (pros say the same).
---
Finka is fine. I don't see a massive pick rate at all, so that's not a problem. And the Finka design you talk about was what Capit√£o was in alpha stage, where he had to shoot ops to heal them. They realised that "retracing your steps on attack is a time waste and frankly and realistically not possible", so they changed the design. The result was Finka 2 years later. So that idea is over 2 years old and was tested to be impossible in siege.
---
Oh, every single attacking round.
---
You..you headshot ash
---
Nomads Airjabs, Zofias Lifeline, melees, Capitos firebolts. You can Thatcher her shield and it won't do damage or slow you down.
---
You thinkin' of drawing more of these?

If she‚Äôs pushing you and you have nades, cook one of those bad boys off and throw it behind her at the last second. You might die if your timing is off but its usually successful with killing her or downing her
---
It will push her shield aside like if you melee it, it just won't be to the side as long

Yes! I really hate the new hereford, the old one was better.
---
Thanks that's good to know
---
At first it looked like a Scooby-Doo doo chase scene lol
---
Search on the internet after that error code
---
My issue is not her pushing but her just backwalking and slowing while constantly doing damage and every time I start cooking a teammate of her pops out and catches me with my pants down
---
üéµ*Nobody gives a shit*üéµ

Zofias concyssions arent a good counter unless you have a teammate with you
---
exactly, thats what it says? it can also tell that some people own strikepads and what not, its up to the developer to do anything.
---
No . you would see an option is set to "Push to talk"
---
Fair enough. Maybe play capi or thatcher more? If you‚Äôre good with droning and shit then you can twitch her and try to go for the kill while she‚Äôs focused on your drone
---
imagine using anything other than a silencer.
---
Nic
---
To he honest I uses to main her when she first came out and I forget that all the time lol
---
Is shooting the impacts on the floor behind her viable?
---
Imagine trying to kill the Nokk without killing the hostage. Lol
---
Lol what??
---
2 impacts dont do enough to kill someone and they do even less because shes a three armor so all youll do is make her mad and a bit lower on health
---
f to that rook
---
She can just walk out of the fire and twitch drones aren't a real threat since they don't have enough darts to kill her
---
Just tell them to set the siege push to talk button as the mic mute button in discord. Works wonders.
---
Draw Twitch.

Same as the beginning "change my mind" "it's illegal everywhere" then you tell me to prove you wrong.
---
The processor is a bit overkill and the gpu is kinda meh
---
Porn hub
---
That ad ruined my fap
---
Someone missed the /s
---
If your having an issue with that then call ‚Äúclear comms‚Äù that usually works. If it doesn‚Äôt then move on.
---
It's not even the same thing teabagging is done to disrespect or taunt someone in a video game I'm pretty sure most endzone dances are done not to taunt the other team but to celebrate
---
People giving up is my biggest source of rage in this game.
---
 I have a friend who does it every single time he is last alive. Makes me want to strangle him. It doesn't mater if it's 1v5 or 1v1, the second he is last alive you can just count the round as lost. he refuses to try and take site back, and if he does he will just slowly walk over from across the map, complaining about how he doesn't even have time to get there. If he is attacking he will jump off a roof or blow himself up.
---
Several times we have lost when the last enemy alive was stuck in a welcome mat and he just wouldn't push in even though everyone on the team is screaming about them being downed.
---
Her gender is [REDACTED]
---
i feel the same i fucking hate this sub, literally post a screenshot and get 5k karma
---
I don't think the average player who's probably a gold 4 and solo queues would want to face cav. Nobody I know bans cav but then again I only play ESL and scrims. Put yourself in the other player's shoes then you'd understand.
---
If you have loli in your siege name then you're actually subhuman and not funny at all
---
Oh so your whole deal was me choosing my words poorly. ok bye
---
you mean it wasn't the better version of hereford that gave it away?
---
I wish I could play either but I just have to stick with the broke man's Echo (Maestro, I love him tho)
---
Could this man be of my *Bizzare* people?
---
Do you have a suggestion of which computer I should use?
---
But honestly some maps don't need reworks, like kanal is still a great map regardless. But what about a new map and a rework released together. Ubisoft has enough workforce to do so. Besides it not like they are fixing the game at all
---
Very abusable
---
Have a nice day tho, no hard feelings
---
That specific operator has a passive ability to pick herself up from a down, but she only gets 5hp back when she does. None of the other ops besides her and doc can get themselves back up.
---
I like and hate this at the same time. Casual should be fun but it should be what you consider fun. If trying your best and playing the game to the best of your ability is fun, the go for it. If fucking around and doing weird Tachanka strats and whatever is fun then go for it. I just don‚Äôt see a point in holding back in casual considering this is a competitive game.
---
Oh no none at all
---
Good
---
r/cursedRainbow6
---
Yeah, But you got duplicate protection so its not illegal. Lol
---
I won't downvote you because you share your opinion, actually I agree with you.
---
Normally I wouldn't even spawnpeek but our enemys in that match started it in the first round by running out as a whole team (two where I was, one at the window below and two at the door below) and trying to spawnkill my entire team, luckily they failed though.
---
I main her as well and it‚Äôs only happened to me once. I thought it was a glitch lmao
---
1V3\*
---
I would have absolutely teamkilled him/her the next round with zero hesitation. Hopefully a vote kick would follow.

Well if you think about it he is shooting compressed air at you that moves really fast so it can just recharge to the air around him
---
For readability:
---
Map: Tower
---
Mode: Hostage
---
Settings: 10-min round timer, 1 round, no setup time, all other settings normal
---
Players: 1v5
---
Defender: Caveira
---
Attackers: All (No shields)
---
‚Ä¢	Watch your back! In this special mode, Caveira must track down and eliminate 5 intruders in her Spooky Tower. Attackers are so scared that they can‚Äôt even fight back! Lucky for them, Caveira can only use her interrogation to kill, or else the attackers can open fire! When only one attacker remains, they can use their melee to stop the spooky menace once and for all! 
---
‚Ä¢	Everyone runs from Caveira, who must kill with only interrogations (melee while in Silent Step).
---
‚Ä¢	Attackers get 1 minute to hide before Caveira can leave the obj.
---
‚Ä¢	If someone enters the obj during the first minute, Caveira can leave early!
---
‚Ä¢	Caveira can use her shotgun and Impacts to open walls or hatches.
---
‚Ä¢	Defenders can only run; they are not allowed to use weapons or unique gadgets to slow or kill cav. 
---
‚Ä¢	Smokes and flashbangs are allowed. Shields are not allowed.
---
Good Luck!
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
this would be really cool
---
Also doesn't help that you literally have so little health that you can kill yourself by pissing upwind.
---
Very predictable
---
All ops of the year (with early acces)

Renown boost (I think)

And I think some other stuff

Oh oops

Ubi can't make a good solution
---
Microsoft can
---
Kk bye üëã

Jager is a great option.  One of the best defender guns and a vital gadget in addition to being 3 speed.
---
Dont even hold your breath for a second on that. Its come back before and it‚Äôll certainly come back again, as do every other old bug
---
i miss it because it was a simple map. it was a great starter for learning maps, since i came back to this game and played the new one a few times, its just outright confusing to me
---
Yahyeet
---
Ranked or overall?
---
Ranked is 1.0, 0.6.
---
Ash? What a surprise.
---
Fun fact: Skull face paint was invented in Summer 2016 when Operation Skull rain released. Nobody had ever done it before.

You not only got whooshed, you double downed on it and were wrong both times.
---
Anti-spawnpeek. Building the communities reputation one stim at a time.
---
1.2 w/L 1.1 k/d
---
My k/d was stuck hard at 1.0 for over a year, I just got it to 1.1 pretty recently
---
I literally stated that it wouldn't make sense but ok...
---
Don‚Äôt listen to them. There‚Äôs gonna be a bunch of vocal idiots who say dumb shit when it comes to this style, I see it all the time on here. That being said the majority of people aren‚Äôt gonna react the same otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt see this stuff hitting front page.
---
You were firing blanks bro clearly
---
I can imagine rook storming a buffet, shooting a hostage for good measure, stuffing every dinner plate in a bag and some spaghetti in his pocket, and running out as fast as possible
---
Can't cosplay as Bandit. Drugs not included.
---
Better than the reworked Hereford for sure
---
Fun in casual bad in ranked but to be fair that could still be said about a lot of maps
---
Most people hate it, I personally like it too. Definitely better then a lot of the previous ones. Lesion's looked so crappy, like he came straight out of a Call of Duty game.
---
Ask the real ones
---
Yes
---
Yes it was way better than the new one.
---
I disabled points bc it distracts me honestly. And i would rather not know i downed someone, if i did i would get greedy and get myself killed
---
Noice
---
Yea me too dm
---
Are we looking at the same picture?
---
Why don‚Äôt they just put some fucking stairs on the roof at this point?
---
I reallly really do. New one is ol, but I‚Äôd really like to have them both. Or just like a special playlist with the old one or something.
---
Not really, if it gets to at least 1 minute restart, it‚Äôll find a match quickly
---
Ela elite confirmed.
---
They really should
---
Is that how it looks when nokk takes the hostage?
---
No I meant does the fact that shooting medicine at people heals their bullet wounds
---
It‚Äôs fine it was joke
---
The cool downs are more than enough
---
*Danny Phantom theme*
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt just turn collision off on the tarp. It‚Äôs so stupid.
---
Yes and no. It was really not balanced and fun to play at the same time.
---
It‚Äôs the new recycling op who re‚Äôuses plastic bags as a form of *stealth*
---
Well answer me this: Why is your twitch drone inside the shower.
---
i only play siege so if thats your only game then just dont buy games you wont play and get the pass instead.
---
tell me how long ago was it and maybe i will believe you
---
r/expectedthanos for balance
---
Because spooky.
---
I play the game a lot and like having the new ops, and I typically get a little money at that time of year, so it‚Äôs worth it for me. But it‚Äôs really a person to person thing.

I do
---
Also, runouts, why you aren‚Äôt detected as soon as you run out is beyond me. How can you be expected to play when you have people jumping out three different windows at once on Hereford or Kafe.
---
I got this edition when it was 20 dollars. Totally worth even though i don't play as any of the ops in it besides buck and cav.

It's just him throwing a gas canister

this is the bullshit this sub is known for
---
*My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.*
---
Typical console
---
When you are attacking you should not expect to be able to enter the building safely. If you don‚Äôt shift-w right when you spawn and actually take it slow then spawnpeekers are free kills.
---
Ok. I understood how people react to anime, I did't draw in this style before:D
---
Ubi should put that in his bio
---
He‚Äôs a beekeeper
---
1.1 and 1.1
---
Idk if anyone else liked green stair spawn peek but I did
---
Those sets looks great. Too bad 3/4 of those operators aren't even competitively playalbe
---
Did I say that? It's better than the old one, still shitty map.
---
OMG stop with this. We get it.. you're a veteran player. Neat. The map was terribly unbalanced, so it's gone. Now everyone pretending they liked it. People need to stop this nostalgia karma circle jerk.
---
idk? just a idea. thanks for the feedback
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me in Copper.

&gt; Porter was not an academic, although in secondary school, he excelled in science. He took a particular interest in biology and the unit on dissection. During his gap year, Porter enlisted in the British Army, using a fake ID to circumvent parental consent.
---
&gt; Porter is a thrill seeker with very little regard for his personal safety. He is fearless in battle and can be a great asset for defensive maneuvers. However, he seems to enjoy the havoc and chaos of war. He tends to have an odd sense of humor in stressful situations. Can be narcissistic.
---
We then it is another common glitch where you get all your current elo added on from 0
---
Definitely because New Hereford is my absolute least favorite map in the whole game
---
The only Doc spawnpeek we actually want
---
Sadly my hi-baby went down and rushed garage &gt;,&lt;
---
Not really, his gadget range is lower and he has Nokk's shitty guns.
---
I got Ash Elite and Pro League set already, they aren't adding loadout selection feature in this game, and I have to change item one by one ... so I'm not bothering.
---
New Hereford is not perfect but Old Hereford was bad. And now, with Gridlock, Nomad, Mozzie, Maverick in the game it would be unplayable.
---
Cheaper is debatable tbh. They definitely have less upfront cost investment but over time consoles can be quite expensive when you contrast the lifetime, cost of games, peripherals, etc.
---
Only once you start spelling more* correctly
---
It was awful - there was 1 stair-case in the entire building! So attackers could easily shut down any rotations from other floors.
---
No moar
---
Not stonks :(
---
It looks very nice tho
---
czemu nie
---
Yeah sure, you learn the game the hard way. But is it fun ? No.
---
Is it fun to *insert bad word* kill platinium players duoQing with smurf/low level playing like they die IRL if they don't spawnpeek ? No it's not.
---
I said it, idc about spawnkilling in ranked. I don't even care when I die now when I get spawnkilled.
---
But those bloody bastards just smashing new players with their smurfing friend because they spawnpeek are just ruining casual.
---
I get kills on spawnkillers, am I happy when I do ? No.
---
Spawnkilling is just a way to play, but spawnkilling noobs when you're plat in casual ? That's just toxic. I hate players who do that. It's not even about me anymore, I don't care when that happens to me. But when my lvl 30 teamate gets spawnkilled when 2 plat players are already hard to handle for the majority of players (including me), it's just frustrating. Same thing for smurfs spawnkilling in newcomer.
---
At least give them a chance to discover the game, not everyone here has been playing since beta, but the sad thing is that they know it. They just spawnpeek noobs because they know they will get kills it's so cool wow, wrecking noobs is so much fun. 
---
I know I'm salty, but those players are straight cancers for the game and new players.
---
Please note that I'm not speaking about experienced players who help their friend discovering the game. Some are nice and have fun playing with their newbies friends, I've played with a lvl 1 some days ago who was following his lvl 150 buddy through the map, teaching him how to play. It's fun for everyone, even for my friend and I, we were just laughing so hard because it was incredibly wholesome to see.
---
Fucking evil üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What did you use to edit this wallpaper? Love what you did!
---
üòÇ cash
---
I miss it cus it wasn't in rank
---
Can we rename these "Elite sets" to something more fitting?
---
Uh, you guys know not all lights are on all the time yea? Usually they're arranged in sets, those two could easily be in a position where they'd blind the camera
---
This is 100% my exact thoughts. If you look at the best maps in the game like Oregon, Bank, Club House etc, they all have their own distinct areas on them and you can tell exactly where you are in relation to everything else. Maps like Villa, Fortress, Tower, New Hereford, and theme park are just dingy and everything looks the same. It‚Äôs so hard for a new player to come in and learn the map
---
Shhhh he might shoot us with his AR's of we're not careful!
---
Exactly. Old Hereford was a mess with the old operators. Add in Mozzie (even more drone denial) Nomad and Gridlock (hard rotation denial) and Maverick (silent, tiny breaching) and its god damn unplayable.
---
Imagine defending top floor against a team with a maverick and a blackbeard. Good fucking luck.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a year and didn‚Äôt even know Zofia could self revive. Thanks!
---
Really hoping her Elite does her justice. It‚Äôd be funny if she somehow had Easter Eggs showing how much the entire Rainbow team relies on her now.
---
Easy to understand also very easy to make.
---
Geneva Convention prepared to be ignored!
---
-Smoke
---
"His gadget range is lower" dunno what you mean by that, but he can throw as far as capitao and area of effect is much larger. 
---
Also, no one uses the FMG-9 on him. Shotgun + SMG11 gives him one of the best defender loadouts.
---
Absolutely perfect
---
Hope its jackal with just a rose in his mouth and a shirt ripped open showing his bare chest, like a true Spaniard.
---
Just give her the acog back already
---
no w≈Ça≈õnie, czemu nie
---
I don‚Äôt imagine Ubisoft will announce 2 elite skins back-to-back. From a business standpoint, you want to funnel players into buying a specific premium product. I may be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll release 2 defender elite skins at the same time, either.
---
Since almost every console is sold with a DS4 I don't see that as a problem. I know, It's crazy!! everyone playing with the same controller against each other instead of m&amp;k or scuffed controllers, what would the world become!
---
That‚Äôs what we typically play. But I like the idea of Cav sneaking up on people!
---
I want to hold him in my arms and tell him he is the best of the bois
---
How is banning Ash and Twitch tactical? They're simply fragging ops.
---
Both suck in ranked
---
When having a non-elite skin,smoke holds his shotgun upside down ON the shoulder,not holding it laying on the side of the shoulder(like elite shows above).
---
It's a really small detail
---
He can't throw as far as Capitao can fire a bolt.  Capitao can have a bolt cross map, through a window, against a far wall in under a second. Smoke can't do that.
---
As for his shottie there's a reason you rarely see Sledge or Thatcher running the shottie on attack.
---
You really are a muppet.
---
Seems like theres people who love the old world war stlye ones, others the more tacticool ones, and others the casual ones.
---
Im personally in the tacticool camp, with ones like Lesion's being right up my alley with slightly futuristic and not world-war brown.
---
Im not impressed. Fuck that dog.
---
/r/hitboxporn
---
Could have done much better
---
Considering some of the stuff she'd be tinkering with, probably for the best to have head and face protection on hand.
---
Ayy with his smoke canisters the violence can actually be closer to equal now
---
The same counts with his smg,he holds his smg like in the reveal trailer.
---
I think the Jager knew , he was just being extra toxic . While the mute (or smoke) figures jager would finish her off like a normal person would so he went to defuse .
---
Is he gonna kill us all now?
---
It was, and it was beautiful
---
funny thing is I still cant hit my teammates with it
---
The screen will say 
---
‚ÄúYOUR POSITION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED‚Äù 
---
If you were watching your teammate, you know what‚Äôs about to happen. 
---
If not, be prepared for a flank.
---
My Smurf accounts are strictly casual. And usually in a 4 or 5 stack with buddies. Playing ranked on those would be dickish. I have more game knowledge than the average legit level 30 and it's just unfair. 
---
People that do that please stop
---
I do legitimately wonder if a Yokai-but-weaker style active camo effect would be better for her
---
Is the skin out yet? I didnt see it in the store yesterday
---
An absolute shame you weren‚Äôt playing twitch. Otherwise, a certain *someone* may have made an appearance.
---
I grew up with a ps3 and a 360. Never going back.
---
Save this clip for when you appeal your permaban for wall hacking.
---
Hysterical
---
Does anyone know if they plan to rework Hereford any time soon? Because is there really ANYONE that likes the new one?
---
That's because they have decent ARs.
---
I thought hereford was a simple and fun map. It looked sorta bland but it could‚Äôve been fixed with some visual changes. I personally can‚Äôt stand the new version.
---
...but he's sprinting.  Shouldn't Nokk's gadget be glitching?
---
I really do tbh
---
I used to get spawnpeeked all the time so I know which window to watch for on pretty much all maps
---
"They can't stop us all" 
---
\-Events surrounding the september 2019 area 51 siege, colorized
---
It's now out and avaible.
---
Nokk's looks like they just put a sticker on her forehead.
---
Hey it's built to stop bullets, good in case of shrapnel
---
Good point.
---
Bottom floor was a shitshow and I loved it. And the spawn peeks were wonderful too
---
I know what I'm doing when I get home
---
My suspicion was that they weren‚Äôt supposed to play the skin before it was revealed. But it seems like there‚Äôs an official reveal video out today, so we may see a bit more of it (not that it was a well kept secret to begin with).
---
The new one suckssssss
---
unlimited power
---
Look up Derrin Errow. I may not be the best but at least you won't have to worry bout any teamkills but if some idiot does TK you, I'll return the favor.
---
Why ash though?
---
Who wears leather pants nowadays?
---
Spawnpeeking is okay to a degree. 
---
Runouts are broken if you aren't listening for the footsteps if they're close or the boards if it's all ready broken. 
---
Not to say I don't do a runout every now and then
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying????????
---
Is this bronze?
---
I think cream is a better colour to describe it but they did look very different
---
And because shottie on attack is a meme, not a practicality.  Notice how you don't see anyone running SIX12 on Nokk even though it hits like a train, has good range, and is suppressed.
---
I play console and I could probably beat you in a 1v1
---
My W/L is 0.8 my K/D is 1.2
---
Because its just a classification of how rare something is. It has nothing to do with how it looks.
---
I mean, think about it. If all the best looking items were legendaries, no one would ever get them because legendaries are the most rare class. Is that what you want? No chance of ever getting anything cool looking?
---
With some tweaking, I feel this is one of the better fan made operations.
---
only zofia and doc
---
zofia
---
Yeah I agree but I‚Äôve never had any console overheat just bought a 50$ mic monitor and I‚Äôm good
---
All it will cause is smurf accounts.
---
The changes might also affect winning screens(when smoke isn't mvp)
---
r/unexpectedoverusedmeme for balance
---
Hey thanks! What do you think would need adjusting?
---
Inicial
---
He is talking about console. MnK is so shit
---
Same thing happening for me
---
your pfp is amazing
---
So...Smoke is a Chav?
---
Never had my PC overheat either lmao. 
---
Good luck on your eventual plan to buy a PC! :)
---
After reading your essay the only think I disagree with is counter spawnpeeking. 
---
To fix that I think that when you que it should take your rank into account just like it does in ranked. That way the sweaty plats can try to spawnpeek other plats. 
---
If you're in a squad maybe a you get matched with a squad with a similar average rank (MMR?)
---
Idk, the osiris eye (just make it function a bit differently, like the parameters, while keeping the  same function). And the defenders gadget having a slightly different effect, as I feel a true pull would never be utilized right or would run into the same problems that nomad had. Overall, they are good concepts that would just need some balancing or tweaking
---
Runouts are ridiculous on some maps for sure. And with Clash and Alibi in the game now it‚Äôs actually broken sometimes. But hey I guess we have Lion too (as if that‚Äôs actually much of a counter).
---
Alright that doesn't matter lmao, it's physically more difficult to aim on console so don't be trashing players because they aren't some pc kid who thinks he's better than everyone else.
---
I could‚Äôve sworn there was a thermite pro league set! 
---
I saw the pro league themed camo on his gun in one of the matches
---
That is wank
---
I feel like maybe giving wedjat a new weapon and the dosg shotgun for his primary
---
Nomad is a good counter. Place the airjab in a spot they can only trigger outside around a corner. 
---
I think this could be fixed by reducing the time before they're compromised. Maybe
---
Mouse and keyboard is objectively better than a clunky controller. Stop being dumb.
---
Yes. You are not shooting the hit box.
---
Now it‚Äôs saying ‚Äúthis twitch account is already linked to another Ubisoft account‚Äù holy fuck Ubisoft sucks
---
*insert Paul walker music*
---
My squad bans twitch a lot because of us using Mira a lot
---
I mean lolis need love too
---
The antifa idea came from a buddy so we call it that.
---
He went Alda way!
---
yes
---
Didn't know they were coming out, gonna claim later, thanks.
---
Lol that‚Äôs gotta suck to just instantly die for what seems like no reason at all
---
We need Castle + rework
---
It‚Äôs actually really funny/cool do to the ‚Äúwack‚Äù. Looks like a mouse riding a hawk üòÇ
---
Real matches are 5v5 though. You aren't getting practice by fighting 1v1. You are basically playing a completely different game.
---
Yah in a firefight you could miss that. But Jager should have seen it for sure.
---
It‚Äôs better then the new one
---
I enjoy the destruction in the map because it allows for creativity
---
Oh dang, that is pretty cool. Wasn't expecting him to have a doctorate.
---
Why does everyone like this skin?
---
Well, it started today. You're welcome friend!
---
Ok
---
I'll give doc some more space next time when I add the new operators.
---
I had this problem and my friend had too, he waited 3 months, I waited 3 days, I don't know what is this about but hope you'll fix soon.
---
Old Hereford made sense. It was a kill floor built to mimic a warehouse, it had rooms that flowed like they would've in an actual building, even if it was a maze it still followed where you should go to get to a place on a basic level. There were other ways that were less intuitive but there was always a fallback if you didn't know those ways.
---
New Hereford has rooms for the sake of rooms connecting to other rooms. It's not built like a real building and it makes absolutely no sense getting around in it in some spots. There is no central hallway or space that links everything together like a real building or even a well designed map. Dust2 is one of the simplest maps imaginable, it's just 3 lanes with two pathways connecting them and a second route between the 3 lanes close to each objective. You can spend 30 seconds running around the map and understand the layout completely. I still don't know how to navigate Hereford now.

Go look at Apex Legends and come back to complain to me lol 7$ a fucking pack and then they have the audacity to give you the option to pay 30 something dollars for the axe for Bloodhound. Somethings are unfair in this game, but personally, especially compared to other games, the cosmetics are fair. They're trying to make money for a game that gives free DLC content every year for over 3 years now.

It just looks nice, skins are all subjective.

They already did enough with the knock-down nerf instead of insta-kill imo.
---
I would have done but the idea was to have all the attackers on the left and the defenders on the right
---
And that‚Äôs the fatal mistake, never assume your teammates are anything even close to a ‚Äúnormal person‚Äù

Well done Ubi!

I completely agree it wasn‚Äôt what we were expecting but at least it‚Äôs not a WW2 skin again and he does remind me of subway surfers.
---
Just because something is worse doesn't mean this is bad.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs not competitive, but it‚Äôs all good fun.
---
His furry skin is much better
---
nope i think its the bad render setting I had in vegas at the time
---
Are you solo queuing ?
---
the rose tinted glasses are strong, old Hereford was straight garbage
---
Fake diamond
---
Agreed. Sometimes you just have to leave the match entirely.
---
My man out here saving lives.

I love and hate her.  Like her gadget, but it needs a small bug Imo (yellow laser, yellow light, beeping.. Have two, but not all 3). Her guns are.... Ehn.  The AK is too slow, and the arx has pretty crap recoil.  Her pistol is God tier though.
---
I do too . BIG FUCKING HOLES COMING RIGHT UP !
---
Yeah, I miss it too. It was one of my favourites maps to play in. Small and simple, unlike the maze that are the new maps
---
You can‚Äôt complain about smurfing and then complain about raising the ranked level. Sometimes need to sacrifice something to make the game better, r6 is the only game that doesn‚Äôt have some kind of smurfing/boosting protection in ranked
---
¬© Neat she

Credibility, meet window.

The only real solution is to switch to PC if you need a kb&amp;m. Cheating isn‚Äôt cool buddy.
---
Personally I love nomad, very good Fragger if played as such and extremely useful in post plant situations, so if you like to have diffuser and have an objective-playing team than she is a must have
---
You stole obutiu3's content!!!
---
Lol... Imagine putting water marks on this shit
---
Oh, didn't expect that. Thank you, have a good one :)
---
&gt; rather antifa than fa
---
there is no rather, either are as equally shit
---
Well done, you have achieved greatness.
---
Look at the top right you can see the designs that have been ‚Äòreleased‚Äô
---
This would just make him widely overpowered, being able to SMOKE OFF attackers is already insane on smoke (and his smokes are still see through) being able to throw 5 smokes out from 2 defenders is insane.
---
As much as it's a bummer they may reuse guns.... I'd be ok with the G36 being the attackers primary.  It's great... It's just no r4.
---
This is just factually incorrect. Silent step does make your crouch walking much quieter.
---
Thank you sm
---
Yeah we know already
---
Probably right. Im trash so maybe I‚Äôm just experiencing some better players in ranked and some coked up monkeys in casual
---
So... can we buff Smoke to allow him to trigger his smokes before throwing them? I‚Äôd like to be able to hold an off-gassing canister, and throw one already releasing gas. Or is that too hard of a cloud dispersal mechanic to build?
---
Fuck you.
---
Console gameplay
---
2nd floor is easily winnable as long as you don't push from bathtub, basement is easily winnable as long as you push from ground floor, 3rd floor is easily winnable if they don't have a Mira, and ground floor is easily winnable as long as you don't push either site window.
---
Just don't make easy mistakes and new Hereford is a lot easier to win than old hereford, where every spawn had six different peek locations.
---
Take a look at this guy
---
‚ÄúGot any more of those pixels?‚Äù
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Not basement lol
---
I‚Äôm but a Silver II on console so when I say I‚Äôm trash... I mean it lol
---
It looks cool but unfitting imo, there are many other cool concepts which could've been better fitting
---
People play ranked with the mindset of "winning is all that matters." It's why so many people queue with copper IV smurfs, relentlessly exploit glitches, etc.
---
Getting killed by the lv 40 4.6 kd copper silent sprinting around the map, quick-peeking some obscure pixel angle on Outback while his Plat 1 buddy is 0-4 is a pretty normal sight these days.
---
Im going to canda tomorrow
---
Damn gotta do me bogus like that
---
Make Bartlett U playable again.
---
Theres like 3 that are actually cool and then the rest are lame as hell
---
wuts the red line?
---
School shooting joke. It‚Äôs just like the victims, never gets old.
---
I bet that the HP on the shield is 5000
---
Not at all man:) I know I‚Äôm not the first, I don‚Äôt try to be. But I‚Äôm excited because I love smoke. I don‚Äôt exactly like the costume but I love the skins for the weapons:)
---
I was kicked out of match for being copper

Hello MarafadusTheGreat, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cqw9pm/this_is_newi_couldnt_see_anything_even_after_i/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Can I ask why you are salty? For no fucking reason?:)
---
An issue with my graphics card sorry
---
*they said it could not be done*
---
Coincidentally, every time I play this map in ranked, I start off as attacking which then leads to a 1-4 or 2-4 loss.
---
Even at higher levels of play you're not always going to be hyper-vigilant when spawning. Round starts, get a sip of water, and \*bang\* dead.
---
Also on some of the ~~shitty~~ not-in-competitive-rotation maps, there's so many potential peeks and runouts you'll waste a lot of time trying to preaim all of them.
---
I‚Äôve done this once, but the person didn‚Äôt know it was me at first. They were just really confused (apparently) and said nothing, so I thought I missed.
---
Wow
---
You do, but it's clipping at an angle through your body:   [https://i.imgur.com/XwEhQ4O.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XwEhQ4O.jpg)
---
The only concerned I have is how he can still be in his own smoke in a hoodie. I thought Finka and Lion would be able to pass through his smoke easily since they are based on anti chemical warfare but idek now. What the hell is in that dam canister.
---
ESL rules require it off, because it provides information for free.
---
I‚Äôve only played 190 hours and I‚Äôm level 108... Weird
---
No charge my friend
---
I can‚Äôt sympathize with that enough. For the past ~5 times i‚Äôve played that map in ranked has all been on offense
---
Welcome man!üôè What part?
---
Lol you think this game could handle 48 players in a lobby?
---
I was not able to move my camera, but I was able to move my character. I could hear it walking and the prompts to barricade and jump appeared. Strange bug.
---
People disable features like points often to make the switch between Ranked &amp; Competitive more natural. Though it does come with the disadvantage of not knowing if you downed someone or killed the defuser carrier.
---
And I‚Äôm only 13, I‚Äôm doing photography as a GCSE (qualification) if you just give me the size of the canvas and I‚Äôll try my best in photoshop my friend
---
I'm not Salty.  It's jsut liwk every brain dead kid goes "gotta take my phone out, get a picture of my screen and post it on reddit"! Hours after it launched.  This is easly the 30th+ post of this today...
---
He wants a pat
---
I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/brpsh8/smokes_new_elite_skin_has_a_little_joke/) on that a while ago when the Smoke elite was leaked two months ago.  Also, it's not arsenic, it's arsole, which is a play on the word "asshole".  So, this post is late and wrong.
---
No.
---
lol i thought it was like to help tell you where  the middle of you screen
---
Windsor
---
That would be too tedious for console
---
Totally this, maps with thouse distinct properties just make sense in your brain, you learn them quicker and can have the map model in your head all the time.
---
For example it makes sense that laundry in Oregon, garage in Consulate and Vault in Bank are in the lower floor. The bedrooms and administration offices usually are upstairs. Also, garage! Of course, it is conected to the outside, etc etc. And in many maps you have open areas that let you see and conect various areas like the center of Coastline.
---
All old maps have really diverse designs that guide you, for example Blue and Sunrise Bar.
---
New maps as Tower and Hereford, and to an extend, Fortress, seems like just square rooms piled into one another. At least with Outback I think they returned to the essence of the old maps.
---

The canvas would be 8 inches by 8 inches. And giving you gold is the least I can do.
---
I can't use rainbows any more in regard to anything, kinda sad they took gods creation and ruined it.
---
üëç
---
I wonder what that other guy was thinking when he got hit lmao
---
I'd like to see it in custom games like they did with bartlett, or at least a limited time mode to play on it.
---
So those "sweaty" players may just be higher ranked players playing like they always would.   It's like NBA players and pick up basketball at the local gym.  If they played together, would the NBA players be sweaty? Or jsut better? :p
---
Lol you‚Äôre just mad that if they implement that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to smurf, gtfo smurfing trash XDDDD
---
This.
---
100000 renown
---
Lol well house was removed from ranked
---
I solo queued to plat so I don't really see the issue
---
nani the fuck is that situation
---
naw i wish
---
Cheers for the gold bro, but is there a deadline, I‚Äôm on holiday atm so won‚Äôt have access to a computer until Monday morning UK time
---
We're gonna get this exact post dozens of times in the next few days. This community does my head in sometimes
---
I like both ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù and ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù elites but this is pretty bad imo.
---
You have a guy walking around freely in a fully smoked room while having a fully automatic primary and even a secondary while the only other person on the attacking team who else can see through smoke has a bad dmr and has to stand still to be able to see through smoke? Yeah,totally balanced...
---
Tachanka still hasn't gotten his elite smh
---
My first time using photoshop ever also it was photoshop express on an iPhone.
---
U should  get recruit
---
H...
---
He's 38 years old
---
no
---
I don't remember there being nearly as much complaining about the map pool in previous seasons.  There were occasional complaints, but nothing like the ongoing war about it that we've seen this season.
---
There are also some challenges and potential negatives to implementing it.  The biggest is that it would increase matchmaking time on unpopular maps.  Personally, I think the impact would be minimal (this game has a very large player base split between relatively few game modes) and be far outweighed by the positives.
---
Huh

Isnt that just hacked by Dokkaebi?

Does the stim do damage to enemies? I feel like a noob

Not gonna lie, I do feel kind of scummy doing it haha

it is don't get me wrong it is but you really need to be able to control its recoil now

It‚Äôs entirely subjective as it is just a cosmetic and in the end is down to personal preference. Personally I‚Äôm a fan of all of them, except for Ash‚Äôs, to me she has the most dull looking uniform and has a really lackluster animation to go with it.
---
I want more like lesion :(
---
Sorry can‚Äôt play tonight
---
I DJ the USSR national anthem if I get MVP with the full rainbow is magic Tachanka, people usually enjoy it
---
Ah okay. Angle is off but I could see myself using it if they integrated into the mesh
---
No
---
Thanks!
---
Well you don't have to use the LMG in the objective always . Use it to spawn peek instead
---
But you get 3 defence rounds too, that means nothing tbh.
---
People who complain about getting spawnpeeked actually are booty at the game 
---
CHANGE MY MIND
---
Fuck beat me to it
---
Take out the meth part and yeah that's pretty much his origin story.
---
Yee
---
I like it the best
---
The biggest problem with Tower is there is almost zero vertical play which really limits options on attack.   On top of that, its way too big and has way to many angles.
---
I feel like attacking on tower is basically just a countdown until you inevitably get domed by someone holding a pixel angle you cant even see.
---
Because rework
---
I really like Lesions.
---
I have to completely agree with you . Not everyone want to play competitively . And people will say their old excuse "Go play casual" . Casual is worse than toxic teammates in ranked
---
