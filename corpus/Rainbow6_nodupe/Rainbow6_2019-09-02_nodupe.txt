Well I do have OP blocked and I refuse to play with him because he's a cheating sack of shit, so there's that.
---
---
---
Remember and Aim Down when checking corners.
---
I was thinking the 5.7 would actually be godly, as it basically fires a mini 5.56, which is a fast boi, and is also pointier, which is better for armor. The Beowulf would also clap major cheeks too.
---
Idk why.... BUT YES
---
It would be cool and not unreasonable if they just made it so they were bulletproof during the duration of his animation, so once he placed it in front of him he can’t be shot while he’s pegging it in
---
I know, I haven’t even bought Nøkk and Warden I just don’t think they are worth the renown, especially for Ranked.
---
No, no that's impossible, NOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I’ve been there man 😂
---
Nøkk is ehhh but warden is more useless then the 417 probably
---
Oh dont get me wrong I love one and I'd love to irl own one. 
---

---
But its certainly a pea shooter compared to the Meusoc and Deagle. 
---
And nothing compares to sneaking up to someone and yeeting a full mag into them. But if I'm warming up I run 5.7
---
PROMOTED
---
I think that is the case right now. The problem is there is a loooong 2 seconds before the barricade comes down to his waist, even then he can be shot on his foot
---
IKR especially with the constant Blitz ban in Ranked.
---
I think the Twitch should’ve have me there tbh
---
I feel like I’ve seen this before in a gif version of this that looked exactly like this but was animated.
---
Quite sus.
---
[removed]
---
What OP would look best as Colonel Sanders?
---
Gotta get those GB points.
---
Exactly plus blitz has always been crap I mean all you need to do is throw impact nades and just kinda crouch spam. Much harder to get shot or meleed so making warden still useless
---
Always stay calm never get to wild. U will never know where people will be. Have fun. And don't let a loss stop u.
---
That's a null argument really, as long as you can recognize that it's a pattern, voting yes on kicking a clutching player without the clutcher getting involved in chat/voicechat and successfully winning the game. If a person follows this set pattern many times over, without utilizing the kicking feature for much else, they could be given some sort of penalty.
---
This would really just be a way to disincentive people from doing it, as when you know you can be punished for it you won't just do it for the meme.
---
Wait how do u find your drivers on your computer and how do u uninstall em I’m not very techy
---
? Is it the key binding reset?
---
Im still waiting on a dual wield operator.
---
i know, but some things are looking way better, especially when you have a good friend that can build so good that it coukd be a youtube channel
---
You should try limiting your FPS to something below your max FPS but above your monitor refresh
---
I also started in wind bastion, but I’d say it’s worth just saving up tbh
---
This actually happened to me earlier I was pissed off
---
It’s a horrible and inconsistent shotgun
---
It’s funny for memes though
---
Yeah I only find Blitz irritating and dangerous if I’m playing against Diamonds that are Blitz mains.😓
---
haha funny thing, the right monitor died today
---
Once I hit high silver/ low gold in ranked there's very little toxicity. Queuing with teammates helps too. 
---
The new friendly fire system has been working pretty well.
---
I have done nothing but teleport bread for 3 days
---
So would everyone just prefer Siege to be a CS rip-off then? No ops because you can’t balance them, no unique weapons because you can’t balance them, no ADS because you can’t balance that. Why should a game lose its entire identity to try and abide to this sort of shit?
---
I see thanks for the heads up.👍🏼
---
Update C+ Distributables
---
Only skilled people should use him. My friend thinks he is good with blitz even though he dies first while I play clash and almost never die. It's usually to some stupid teammate but whatever and he is wondering why I'm telling him not to get clash next
---
should be sept 10.
---
No worries
---
Last one is on stairs, don’t rush him.
---
LOL yeah it’s safer to play Monty TBH.
---
It’s good for making pretty big holes in walls, kinda a budget buck
---
wHy aRe tHeY mAkInG sKiNs wHeN tHeY sHoUlD bE fiXiNg bUgs
---
Yes. Though you wont use it after couple of days
---
not that rare anymore
---
*Duel of fates commences*
---
Please

# Delet this
---
But minecradf
---
Yas
---
wat? no it should be balanced. cs:go is has better balance and is comparable since they are both tactical shooters. that's why cs is used. im not say the game should be more like cs, im saying it should be balanced
---
I like that flare, too bad I don’t have a pc to change mine
---
Second round we lost the first but its cool having people who arnt total jackasses on my team.
---
I think that's the only black ice im missing for GSG9 very nice!
---
They mean the chances to get it out of an alpha pack,which is rare.
---
Not the amount of players who have it
---
use ur drone before pushing, unless theres no time
---
ignore, mute and report toxic teammates
---
Yeah that’s true
---
I hope we get a chicken wing charm or some kind of weapon camo that would be cool
---
same thing happened to me, but when I joined two retards had mics so one said to the other, “Eyy, should we vote kick them?”, and after that they started a vote and then I got kicked
---
Sorry dude I was trying to teach new players I will stop killing people now
---
Yeah it doesn't make sense how Monty dies from a headshot of a 9mm from more than 50-60m away. At the very least he'll walk it off, and the most it'll either just crack the glass on his helmet, or put a dent in it
---
60hz and yes its set to 60hz
---
I feel that. You didn’t do anything
---
I love that the only thing keeping this man from not using this ACOG’d drum mag pistol is whether or not it had mozzie’s reload animation
---
Colonel sanders bundle for kaid
---
I love rainbow six siege so much, but minecraft was my childhood so I'm a tad salty bout this one chief
---
It’s like half guns
---
In casual you can get kicked for anything. People will even nake 4 stacks just to kick others. You did nothing wrong here and they were just being toxic.
---
Probably took someones main
---
Yes
---
He doesn’t need a nerf he is statically the worst op on attack the lowest win and pick rate also the way his guns have been nerfed just makes him worse they are even going to need his smg next season
---
BF4 has 130 guns
---
That reminds me of that snake from family guy
---
i do this with my friends🙂🙂🙂
---
*pm
---
i know
---
but i feel bad for killing my own teammates
---
Kaid
---
Titties.
---
No the most overdone meme is jackal needs a nerf he is statistically the worst op on attack
---
I play on console and that rarely ever happens to me. You might just be playing in a low population server(?)
---
Thats destructive finish. Dramatic finish is when u end with a heavy attack and it corresponds to the story plot like Goku and Frieza on Planet Namek.
---
Bitch hold up..
---
Stop! I can only get so erect
---
Not allowed to brag about grind if u have a season pass
---
yes.
---
Warden should have a Colonel Sanders skin change my mind
---
I’m sorry dude but, to use mk on console, you have to use an emulator to emulate a controller.
---
So, the game thinks he is using a controller, so it displays it as such.
---
Sauce: know a guy who complained about not knowing controls when he plugged in his mk for the first time because it displays it as controller.
---
Nomad is busted and rarely gets banned, I'd look into grabbing her. She can help the team by watching flanks and has 2 super strong guns
---
Is it not in the breaking animation? He is leaning but the shield is completely vertical, strange.
---
Let's hope they do expand on it, that could indeed work.
---
Okay now I remember well, thank you
---
jager no this isn’t how it was supposed to go
---
Shit.Didnt know that joke would be made so quick
---
CmonBruh In chat ...
---
"ow"
---
Yes, he is very strong. If you drone someone out you can hit your gadget and know exactly where to shoot
---
You bet your sweet ass that it would be.
---
i thought this was a mirror or some shit at first lmao
---
First what the actual hell second it dose t auto switch from airjab mode to regular mode and third zofia isn’t broken there’s no bugs with her launcher
---
dude oof you got me
---
Bruh
---
Indeed
---
## bruh 💀🙌🙌💯💯
---
Cav was so stupid...
---
By the way how did you get that Mozzie Main icon?
---
Our amazing
---
Noice
---
Of course it’s in russian
---
Probably because they were all friends and didn’t want u in the game with them or just saw your low level and kicked you straight away
---
Try fiver. I saw a coconut brah video about it
---
When you scroll through all the posts on the siege page, top right of the screen there are 3 dots, click that and then click change flair then there’s a list
---
Oh I don't know why but I capped my fps at 60 and it was on 30 the whole time and then I went back to uncapped and now I get 60 - 80fps
---
lol i saw that happen
---
also i think posting this is against the rules so be careful
---
We need a bucket of KFC to be a universal headgear
---
I love it.
---
Great thanks again!😉
---
How much ram do you have ?
---
Welp
---
Happy to help 😁
---
Mountain Dew has the Mountain Dew League (MDL) for csgo. It's a pretty good way to support the amateur/semi-pro gaming scene. If KFC is gonna do something similar for rainbow six, that'd be cool!
---
“Siege is a perfect game with no noticeable flaws”
---
-russianbadger
---
That’s not what I’m saying. Games are meant to be fun. Getting mad because someone is using better technology then you is kinda sad. Monitors give you a huge advantage over TVs but nobody complains about them.
---
You made a mistake you meant 10 players including himself
---
it was 1500 then 1000 then 800 on down to 200 with 2 shields then dropped further to 60 with two shields and let's not forget the changes to ads time as well.
---
90k for the ugliest skin... RIP
---
Add me on Xbox, reubenbell149
---
Thanks man im kinda new to this whole r6 comunity, even though i've playing the game since outbreak
---
How did fortnite not win?
---
Who shadman
---
I think it looks nice, unpopular opinion but I think it's better that black ice
---
I'm proud to be straight, can I get a flag as well?
---
150/150 was fine, but 60/60 is just shit
---
As a jackal main I actually approve of this, just toss me a couple extra scan bar thingies so i can scan 4 or maybe 5 times instead of just three with this and I'll be happy.
---
kfc universal skin?
---
Yeah but it's pretty bland. Actually it's kinda in the game. The straight flag is the black and white stripes.
---
This is an anime i would watch if it was real
---
Aaaaaand nobody likes you now, congrats
---
I also approve of this
---
They said that they wil now be investigating the power level of 2 speeds with the ACOG sight on SEMI AUTO ONLY.
---
You are one thirtsy boi
---
Where did you get all this info?
---
“Statistically worst op on attack”?
---
Firstly,he has one of the best gadgets in the game.Absolutely no counter except for Caveria.
---
Secondly,he has some of the best weapons in the game.An assault rifle with low recoil and high DPS,and an SMG with an ACOG AND 50 rounds drum mag.
---
Thirdly,his SMG is getting a buff and nerf.Damage upclose is getting buffed to 38 damage,and drop off is going to be more severe.
---
In total,your statement is completely false.
---
You don't need one
---
The year 4 pass has everything on the year 4 road map. So yes you do. And everything in the next two seasons (I think)
---
My friend, shadman is an artist who is notorious for making r34 art
---
O, I deserve to be fuzed for such a mistake.
---
Season comedy the 10th, you'll get em instantly, everyone else has to wait a week.
---
Never understood this type of editing  I feel like it’s over edited and to much in your face.
---
Hell no, MMPR.
---
ahh, okay thx
---
Who tf keeps making flags for random shit that doesn't need flags
---
cyka
---
Ya heads serious
---
I accidentally went both shotguns on mira. (Ranked Matchpoint) Scariest 3 minutes of my life.
---
Ah thats the new titanium dey wall very cool
---
Nah it is slimmer than old one too.
---
No lie I would buy it if I had to
---
Ok well, I don't fucking know. I'm pretty sure the LGBT community feels like they need representation and so they get a flag to represent them.
---
You don’t get every op with season pass, only all the ones in whatever year you bought it.
---
I'm new too. Be on r6 of two months now.
---
........
---
I wasn't even aware KFC had a World Cup of Games
---
happy cake day btw
---
It's 50 hp now.
---
I'm not new is the shitty thing I'm level 155
---
This post is cursed.
---
The attacker has a soda machine that can boost you up and if you drink the water,(long animation looking for water spout), you cure the salty affect of the chicken.
---
Lol
---
Spoiler: you can't use money to get diamond camo!
---
Well then he shot my shield then idk. Even if it is misaligned, he shot my elbow while I'm looking directly at him
---
imagine being proud of winning a poll from fckin KFC gaming
---
Yes shame on everyone for having fun.  Games aren’t meant to be played for fun
---
Your playing great for a new player
---
Big improvement. Thanks for the comprehensive comparison.
---
I feel like you should be able to wack someone with the mag it would be hilarious if this was real
---
You're right, that is the joke
---
one of the easiest games to clutch on and people still play every round recklessly
---
I just hope they will add a new polish map in the future or at the very least SHOW us what it would have looked like. The polish operators are my mains.
---
No it’s not there’s something that Ubisoft releases after every season it’s called a win delta and he has constantly the worst or close the the worst his absilty is ok but easy to deal with if your know what your doing  his weapons are mediocre and just beacause a weapon has a agoc doesn’t mean it’s good and his smg is still getting nerfed so please don’t allow personal feelings get in the way of facts
---
*Casual*
---
It needs to be buffed
---
I know, all good.
---
*muffled "Audaces fortuna iuvat"*
---
My boyfriend gets frustrated and I honestly don’t blame him.  It sorta turned me off from the game but it’s not a dealbreaker for me.  He’s still miles better than I am and I loved playing with him before he switched to PC.
---
Some people, though.  It’s like Siege is everything and they get soooo mad when you’re the last standing and you die in a 1v4 like you’re supposed to clutch every time.
---
The joke is that they’re both short. Unfortunately, this is neither funny or useful in anyway. Kinda distasteful even.
---
Turn on sound.
---
Lmao why didnt u just callout?
---
Im close to a mute jammer
---
I went 11 and 2 today in ranked, my team won the game, and I clutched the last round. My friend beat me by 10 point because gu mine. Am angry, and am still copper 2
---
Nah it’s just not funny.  I get the comparison but the whole shooting thing is a sensitive subject my dude.
---
Fuck no that would get annoying
---
Fuck Minecraft
---
No russian 2.0
---
Ooou thanks for the info :)
---
Shitpost activate
---
You don't need to understand. It's a type of humor. Or you like it or not. Simple.  
---
For me is funny.
---
Yeah, that would *never* be abused.
---
It’s a bad joke, both in humor and taste.  People lost their lives and loved ones.
---
Is that real?
---
What’s your opinion on soviet Womble
---
Didn't they give someone a shotgun when the game was still new, because they had on in their portait but not in their loadout?
---
I got DDOSed today I do think that is a good idea. But feel like it’d be abused
---
&gt;level 1
---
I personally would consider myself unlucky.....
---
Overwatch has this system and I gotta say it's really amazing! I think siege should have it either
---
No :(
---
He's hit or miss, some of his videos are great, and some aren't. Bur you can't compare Soviet to this guy, the way that Soviet paces his subtitles and places them add to it, not to mention that he and his friends are hilarious
---
Chet mcbadbat lookin ass
---
You can actually put an ACOG on the BOSG in the new Call of Duty.
---
I always tell him that he can choose not to play with me if my gameplay makes him that angry.
---
I mean you can’t really call them bad (“can’t hit your shot”) when they’re winning lmao I guess you’re a worse shot.

id doubt they will change it because house is just what siege is. Its our brokenap and itll stay that way
---
Well done. I’m currently sitting high plat 2 unable to get over that hurdle.. but seriously good shit dumping on those scrubs
---
And the insane editing he puts into his videos, his subtitles even have shadows and stuff like that
---
how so?
---
Screenshots of the following are NOTallowed

Scoreboards, ranks, levels, experience, Renown, R6 Credits, trophies or any other stats

Ping
---
Comedic/humorous account names (including BattlEye ban messages and other social media platforms)
---
Then at the end the game should give ya more points based on kd
---
they ran into it, dumbasses
---
A lot of four stacks would kick the fifth as soon as the game starts.  People would constantly kick anyone who makes a mistake or even doesn't clutch or doesn't play the way they want them to.  It really sucks when you get someone who's throwing, but people abusing this would be far more common than throwing is.
---
I think its a dumb rule and i dont think they enforce it anymore though
---
Swing your knife and if they keep going tag them in the dome. Only the harshest lessons are learned in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.
---
Obviously not, this game beat minecraft so something is broken besides Ubisoft here.
---
They ahould but like affect the overall kd
---
I WANT IT
---
If no one cares why reply?
---
I think there's a fried drumstick charm already ,maybe ?
---
Get good
---
This 1000%. Its always someone that yeets me from close range with no footstep sound at all. Siege feels like an abusive relationship at this point because I love most of the game but if I can't rely on my senses for approaching enemies what is the fucking point? I have noise cancelling headphones and have the volume turned up, so its not that.
---
The only problem that I have with this is that often when I play in a five stack I will get disconnected in the ban phase because I have poor internet connection so maybe instead of forcibly shutting down the match it should give the remaining four players a prompt on weather or not the would like to continue, even though I do get discounted at the beginning of the match I often return to the match before the first round and am able to select an operator
---
Probably a bunch of copper shitters who die to spawn peaks cause they don’t know how to drone
---
It's all r6 fanboys, it's pretty much KFC r6 gaming
---
Ahh, I see. Good to know, I'll be reporting these posts now
---
The ADS is above the room that it is catching the projectiles. So the enemy doesn’t look up to find it. But it’s has long been patched
---
Idk, u can abuse that by leaving if u see like a five stack of champions on the other team

Ah, I See You're a Man of Culture As Well
---
If only they could fix that damn CPU glitch so I can play my soon to be favorite game
---
Nah it’s airsoft
---
&gt;It happens for me as a defender more than on attack. On attack I nearly never have sound issues at all.
---
STICKY FINGERS
---
To point out that it's weird you care about getting MVP at all, much less in casual.
---
Maybe an mmr loss reduction would be better
---
Lmao who tf cares this much
---
I’m not sure about the exact way but the first step is u gotta be a real piece of shit
---
 Uh,I’ll just stick with my PS4 controller,thank you.
---
to quote interros response, 
---
"To all the people saying "but players will just queue dodge!"
---
Then you hit 'em with a harsh penalty for leaving early. And the more times they do it, the longer their punishment lasts. There are solutions out there, folks."
---
I feel like just reducing the number of pings would be fine enough.
---
Holy shit I want a warden skin that looks like Harland Sanders! ( kfc logo guy )
---
Wanted the elite shown off been playing like shit all day wanted to fles and feel proud can one not feel proud of even 1 match in cas a 6-1 none the less when getting nothing but 1-4 all day?
---
It's important to keep forums on topic
---
Always happens at the wrong times.
---
Didn’t have to say you were in console. It’s quite apparent.
---
Thanks
---
Hmm I guess that will work
---
no, it's a person playing the game how they want to play
---
Ok. But, I'd like to show that I'm proud of who I am, and I accept myself that I am in fact trans. That I am in fact bi. You are as we call, "Homophobic", you don't like gay people (etc etc) bc they are not straight, or cisgendered, or " normal". Basically everyone is sick of your shit and thinks you should go and respect people who respect themselves and are standing up for what they believe is correct. Oh shit you aren't the person I was just- fuc. You are annoying. I typed out that for another person, but still. Respect people.
---
Because it's true, atleast in my world.
---
They are giving it 21 rounds so
---
I’m sad but happy
---
lel
---
Cool bruh i respect that
---
wtf ew. Pervert. I'm just trying to insult you online. You're the one who is accusing me of coming on to you.
---
I was using discord. Literally used it for the first time today
---
They gave it 21 rounds
---
Yea, I was hype when I got b ice for buck, but looks like ima be a Mira main now lol
---
Having too much of them subtitles just dilutes the content yeah
---
They’re invading!
---
Not my proudest fap
---
I was making a gun joke but ok
---
It means you pretty much can't play the game for 1/3 of the round because you're worried about being found by the other team.
---
My impatient ass over here on ps4 is waiting
---
I don't follow. What do you mean "headshot only"? Can't you just explicitly go for headshots? That's what most of us do.
---
Nice bruh hope to see it at the next pro league match
---
It is just MCedit
---
Poor jager
---
You said it yourself. "He's not too good of an op". He really isn't. It is a 5 second refresh ping where you only know if the defender is at the ping for the first split second. If the defender moves, you're screwed for the next 4 seconds. So he demands the use of excess utility to ascertain the position of the defender at the ping, which definitely isn't OP or game breaking.
---
He's fine. Needs no changes.
---
No it’s not he’s my friend and he actually made it w/out being retarded and using mcedit
---
I had the thought of if a defender really didnt want to put down a reinforcement then he could drop it for another defender to pick up
---
Did you get your PC from some second hand parts store, or build it using 2nd hand parts like hard disks or something like that?
---
Nobody wants house to be changed
---
I was making a time joke but okay
---
Bandits been selling to jager hmm? Poor jager, no drug will ever bring back your acog.
---
Can probably be because of apps or browsers running in the background
---
Hermit purple and killer queen would be cool. Every other one is OP as FUCK
---
Docs arms are gridlocks bruh this dude is jacked
---
Aerosmith is just Lion 2 Electric Boogaloo, Hermit Purple is a grappling hook, killer Queen is just an operator with like 4 nitro cells, sheer heart attack is a roomba with a claymore attached to it, and moody blues is Alibi Requiem where the prisms can beat the shit out of an attacker
---
My only disagreement is that Jackal's screen should be *complete static* when getting shot. Most people just run around with it on because the effect isn't that big of a deal.
---
Why are you being a prick about it if “no one cares”?
---
Chalange excepted... money thats why money MONEY
---
You failed to disarm the bomb. Says it right there at the end
---
Just spam that shit Boom kill
---
I have a Franken pc built from several others I pit together. Could that really be it?
---
Cool
---
It’s like red flag laws for siege
---
Remember before when the shield had 800 health but now it’s like fucking paper
---
Because his win rate is through the roof already right?
---
He means an option to set where only head shots kill, body shots would do no damage.
---
He's just getting a good, long sniff in
---
Nice job, solo queue?
---
Dont be, your showing devotion to the game
---
Reminds me of LoL's thing, if someone stays afk in spawn or doesn't join, the team gets an option to call a vote to remake the match
---
I don’t infringe on the LGBT community, I don’t understand why everyone should show it.  I don’t show anyone that I am heterosexual, I don’t need it
---
I miss it quite a bit as well but I don't hate the rework
---
Closest to the l85's rpm of 650 is the UMP with 600 and The Aug a2 at 700.
---
Mp7 on attack? Mp7 does 900. You have f2 at 980 and r4c at 860 a couple of others at 850 and c7e and pdw at 800.
---
I see what u did there
---
Every time I see one of these I have one guestion. Why?
---
Take my account
---
By nerfed to the ground I meant nerfing them extremely hard. His gun was nerfed his shield was nerfed. I'm not arguing that most of them are still pretty good nor am I saying all of them didn't deserve them, I'm just trying to say this shouldn't happen to Jackal as he's not nearly as op as these cancers.
---
Well hopefully it isnt an actual charm tho
---
still doesn't help when she attacks someone from a 4m ledge like she is tarzan.
---
That took you less then 10 seconds to kill them all
---
It was slightly off at the top and I was saying it would be an easy fix, like at max 100 blocks I wasn’t trying to offend anyone and if you actually read my comment you would see that I was impressed even with the small difference and I probably couldn’t make it so don’t jump to conclusions and assume I was being mean I was just saying that there was a slight difference from the original maestro icon, go look at the original icon if you don’t believe me and I wish I could give your friend an award or something but I cannot so shut up and don’t assume.

All it really requires is a direct connection to your console via your computer. From there they can get player IPs as well as server IPs, and do what they want with them.
---
Overwatch not competitive, are you living under a rock?
---
Maybe like a castle barricade, it would take a while to destroy via melee
---
Oh yeah
---
Ik it was sick
---
looks like gta lips when you pick your mother as misty in GTAO.
---
Mmm not really
---
Then I will count it as an ace if it was before prep phase ended if not the a 4K
---
DOTA2 has the exact same thing, where if someone is AFK or fully disconnects within the first 5 minutes of the game, that someone just takes a loss and penalty while everyone else just goes back into queue. Sure, a smurf might not care, but if it happens more than a few times, the penalties just keep getting larger and larger. And if it worked so well for a game that is literally free to play (DOTA2), it should work just as well for a game that is pay to play (even if it gets ridiculously cheap during sales).
---
Pretty easy tbh, wireshark the ip addresses of everyone in the lobby, ask your friends where they live, if the ip doesn't match then send it to your ddos botnet and boom, that persons offline

I got spawnpeeked like 10 times in the course of 2 days and when i try spawnpeeking you get a hail of bullets lol.

People are at least refunded rank points when the hackers are banned. Kb&amp;m users on console are never caught and just the game for players who use controller and that to me can be even worse than hacking.
---
Ah. *looks at username* A fellow man of culture i see.
---
it also makes it realy easy to track you down and you wont hear footsteps as well because of the shooting
---
Someone said Valk's feet are really big and I can't unsee it now.
---
*metal doors slamming*
---
He said he was kind of a big deal, he wasnt saying "oh you got plat, big deal!" Basically he was just telling a joke
---
well ya, need to shoot a fuck ton though
---
It needs some shadowing and a bit of a touchup and it will look hammer.
---
So is everyone copying i\_wanna\_fuck\_twitch now?

Only 3 EDD kills

Honestly. Its a pretty good gun

Just curious, why arent you using the SPSMG9?

To me it just seems like a direct upgrade but Im probably wrong

I was almost never killed by jackal as a roamer

Fucking ooof

They got it at the exact same time lol

if you can run back to site, most of the time you will get pinched from both rotation and ends up having to camp at the floor you're in or the floor above.

First of all that is wrong, and also how could you be an active Reddit poster and commenter of 2 1/2 years and only have 8 karma?

I just play with my squad exclusively and only play when im feeling it, it used to be waaaay higher, but evened out  after a while

he got that full gaming room in his crib. chill out newb, he has optimization softwares and shit

Gib plz.

If you start interrogation animation and person that you interr leaves then interrogation counts
---
Well i dunno.. this is the wrong game mode for starters.
---
Karen you whore, release me from this tactical fps game at once
---
Yeah but if you gotta get to em first tho
---
Why you gotta hate on my dokkabae? Getting access to defender cams can be dangerous too. Also popping the logic Bomb from spawn is terrible. Not the issue tho. Why you gotta hate on my dokkabae?
---
The more I think about this the more I like it. He can still give callouts of course but then he'd actually have to communicate to get help from his team.
---
Me likey!
---
I agree they’ve pushed the esport too hard, but I don’t think Activision would be putting this much money into something if it didn’t make them a profit, that’s not a smart business move.
---
People get butt hurt if they dont release a guy and a girl every season

I mean you cant really exploit that if she was gonna get one in the 1st place

Won’t trolls just do this on purpose to close out game and waste people’s time?
---
Dang that sucks, and no xbox only, idk if ps4 has a game club, but if they do try checking that out, people are always posting for people to fill up there squads
---
He's referring to perosnal ip addresses, not public ip.
---
I think their body should still be there after they leave
---
Can you explain why he’s cheating?
---
Amazing? Meh. I used to find it annoying before role  lock. Now as a tank main its easier for me to get into games
---
Or even a full female group... looking at you, GROM.
---
Recruit needs a nerf. Too op
---
Thx mute is amazing lol
---
I doubt you're a jackal main because he's banned every game.
---
and have a penalty after quitting the first round if you lose
---
hey if i buy year 4 pass then would i have to buy the year 5 pass again , i mean pay again with real money or i can grind and earn some kind of in-game currency to purchase the pass again just like in rocket league and many other games ?
---
This guys fucking chin good lord it was sent from the gods for our viewing pleasure

do you play on pc?

Idk but its kinda douchy like just instakilling new players when they are trying to see if the game is good or not

please just rework all global low/no risk abilities in a game thats about positioning and stealth

This is a high skill 'two tap' gun, don't tell me this is op, it will be a blessing to vigil and dokki
---
Imo jackal is more annoying that op since he can scan the same set of footprint repeatedly, if they change that he would have been so much better
---
What about them? Just ban that trash out of the game for a month.
---
If you purposefully make others matches horrible you shouldn't be playing online
---
OP
---
But what if cav spawnpeeks with her pistol, downs someone, person leaves, I don't think that you would run out to him and interrogate him
---
For me it was a hardware issue. The vram of my GPU had issues and that's why my game crashed. I would check your hardware if it fits the requirements and if so, I would check if the hardware gets to much heat. If other games crash then I would say it's also a hardware problem and would check the components
---
Anyway I'm sorry if I came off as an ignorant prick, I apologise and I agree to each his own
---
People would deliberately seek out cav just to fuck with their team lol. I've been playing for years and the toxicity of alot matches is astonishing.
---
Happens in CSGO, makes sense.
---
No. Every single time i log in i get elo taken away from me. Ive had about 600 elo taken. I dont even notice them but they must be there. I play csgo now because of how awful it has got with cheaters
---
Contrary to ~~popular~~ your belief, a video game needs to be built competitive to have a pro league. Probably a reason nobody plays Minecraft at EVO or No Man's Sky at the HCS
---
That's the whole point basically. It's tried and true, so why don't we have it?
---
You’re so lucky, when I don’t I get tk’d by someone behind me.
---
He looks like PubG on bad graphics
---
Overwatch has the exact same system that's mentioned in the tweet by Anne (Which is where Anne probably got the idea as she's been playing that a bit lately) and it works perfectly. Groups can't keep queue dodging cause of escalating penalties, 1 person leaves to dodge queue? 5 min suspension, the entire group wants 5 mins, they wanna dodge again with another person, that's a 5 min suspension got everyone has to wait, then once they all dodge once and wanna dodge again, next suspension for all of them will be 15 mins and then it keeps escalating more and more. Such a system basically tires all queue dodgers with massive suspension times and deters them from trying to game the system.
---
I feel you a couple of days ago I had 2 people DDOS'ing the server, one of them was in my team and complained about the other one doing the same shit as him
---
I know when my aim sucks, it didnt in those cases, but I get your point!
---
Also I didnt have any connection issues. A ping of 9 and an open NAT type. Maybe the enemy was lagging?
---
are there any other place to download the fan kit?
---
the download rate for me is so bad, about 40-60kbps..
---
if anyone could upload the fan kit to gdrive and give me a link, that would be neat..
---
they're likely mistaken and can't aim
---
I wanna fuck your sister
---
That's what every single person says when they post their video
---
I'd say it'd be somewhat "incorrect" if we still had the hit-the-defuser-with-your-gun animation as it wouldn't really make sense to hit something with your gun through a small gap, but with the current defusing animation it's perfectly fine.
---
Tf. So if someones game crashes they can just rematch and they get a penalty
---
Can confirm. It’s hysterical and sad at how many post there are like these.
---
Ruined it
---
Does that mean leaves in a row (example: someone leaves 3 times back to back in 3 days) or leaves in a timeframe (example: someone leaves 3 times in 6 games over a day) ?
---
Agreed. They should also bigger penalty's for leaving because now there are a little to none...
---
na...NANI!!!
---
Only in ranked. Some of the most fun I've had on this game is when all my teammates disconnect and leave the whole operation to me and my buddy.
---
Good idea but it will be annoying if people want to play, wait like 10 minutes thrn go back in the lobby
---
Lardex ate the kfc bucket
---
No idea, I think it was a seasonal for the Mira jackal season
---
did it to not just me, but all my friends too and the last guy had to 1v5 the other team
---
Crossfade or something like that, I think?
---
That idea came up the first time during the first few weeks after release and is re-apperaing at least once a month since then. Not only on reddit also on the forums and on discord. However I dont know if Ubi checks discord actively so lets not count that one.
---
The fact that it is still not implemented can be seen as a kind of confirmation that Ubi will not implement it.
---
Classic is the setting that it’s always been, where depending on how much your joystick moves, thats the speed you will look around. Updated adds acceleration to that, so that it is a gradual speed increase as you move the stick. Variables included such as sensitivity of course.
---
Thunt. It also gets you renown a lot quicker but it gets really boring
---
It’s from operation velvet shell
---
Then jackcal gonna be another brainless ash with best load out in the game, just smoke site and frags people out
---
This happens in Dead by Daylight now and it's a simple yet great fix to stop just dropping ranks or playing annoying games where you're destined to lose.
---
Alright thanks. Damn tho. I wish it was still available it’s clean af
---
Ugh
---
TTs make sense in a tournament or in pro league but normal ranked it's a waste of time. Ranked games are long enough.
---
When your connection sucks that much you should get a better one.
---
Im getting the feeling that youre one of those "git gud"-idiots. Bye
---
if you upgrade it will only install new content im 99 percent sure its the same for siege
---
wait that's illegal
---
Crossfade from operation velvet shell
---
Lord lardex has spokith
---
Ubisoft wouldn’t do that... because this would take over Pro League
---
So 1 or 2 seasons ago they made her manlier/fatter, not they are reverting it?
---
I bet he is a brick at parties. Literally a red brick about 6 feet by 3 feet by 2 feet standing in the corner.
---
No, when a player dcs the player does a vote which the all of the players have to agree upon. So if they know ypu crashed they wouldn't vote or if you reconnect it wont remake. The system works almost perfectly in league due to the fast load times and other facts, there would need to be tweeking for siege of course but all in all it is a better system for players in general since if that player did really leave no one would have to lose LP and MMR.
---
I'm surprised you didn't get instantly team killed.
---
Saran Wrap me baby
---
Also Ubi if I am dropping 15 kills in a ranked match and my team is getting between 0 and 3 then your matchmaking isnt balanced.
---
welcome to the community. I wont tell you what to use because the other guy covered that but ill give you vital advice
---
never ever use fuze on hostage
---
Sorry to ruin it for you, but its just total PVP headshots, so more you player the "better" you are. It would be more accurate to skill if it was headshot ratio or average per gun kill is a headshot.
---
I wield Ela Shotgun myself and based of other shotguns I think Ela shouldn’t have 61 rounds in mag/reserves while I’m seeing others with half. One time I did get a triple kill with one mag then proceeded to get the final kill in the 1v1 making it an easy 4K. It’s broken and when someone asks I tell them it’s broken. 
---
In most ranked games I get 6-8 kills with the shotgun alone, so broken.
---
That’s still incorrect grammar, you meant at most. At least means nothing lower than the number you listed.
---
Trash idea,
---
Some people leave cause they crashed
---
It removes the aim acceleration. I would recommend using it, it might feel worse in the beginning but eventually it should start feeling better than classic
---
More like quit and find a different match
---
Why so defensive?
---
Also, If someone intentionally clicks the 'Return to Menu' button, then they should be penalised weather or not they return. I am sick of people leaving after I down them with cav or frost just so that I dont get the kill. :(
---
No updated removes the acceleration, classic is the one with aim acceleration
---
Can we talk about how annoying Jeager is?
---
Nothing that I've said has any relation to "git gud"....
---
Yes, that’s right. Why do I keep getting it mixed up.

To be fair their competitive league is a shit show (look at xqc situation) but yeah it's def a competitive game

Y8S3, Armageddon has been revealed as the newest operator, he has built in aimbot with 3 charges that each last 10 seconds, and can be played on either Attack or Defence.

Wow I left OW some time ago and I was just thinking how siege should have something like you just explained. Nice to know things have gotten better.
---
Or/also work on balancing the points system so that it actually accounts for how the match goes and who you're up against. Tekken can give you some pointers
---
Deluxe edition grants you the year 4 pass, including all year 1 operators
---
Adopt Dota system. Flexible and works against leavers.
---
You sound...experienced, hmmm..
---
No but really it shouldn't be so easy to do.   I love sweating it out in ranked and getting put against mouse and keyboards and this shit sucks. I cannot for the life of me hit plat 1, I know if the playing field was fair that I definitely could. I solo queued myself to plat 2 once and that was some of the best games I ever had on siege, now I can get into plat 3 with a good bit of determination but still, the M&amp;K shit is ridiculous on top of getting lag switched or DDOSd or whatever it's called.
---
No, I only got the year 1 ops
---
Same bro on ps4. Good stuff!
---
What is this app? I couldn't find any expanded stat tracking and i'd love to know how i'm doing.
---
So people can keep disconnecting before the game start and fuck with 9 other people? No thanks
---
In the game it says that I can upgrade to the ultimate edition but once I go to the PS store it says “purchased”
---
nothing lucky about that
---
The Weapons are nice but the gadget mhhh not my thing and tooo glitchy and too much work to put them in that game
---
Ok. Now get black ice for all the guns
---
Nah, different jawline.
---
I like this a lot. Makes him less oppressive and actually adds some counter play for the defenders. If Jackal has pinged you, you know he's somewhere you've been recently, not half the round ago. So you can make a decision to either get aggressive and hunt him down or to run away. Either can work because you're going to have a rough idea where he is because you were there recently. Compare that to how he is now. "Oh I'm being tracked, is he right around the corner from me or is he on the hatch I reinforced 10 seconds into the prep phase, that I had to do or else I'd screw over the team? I guess I'll find out based on how many bullets are in my body in the next 20 seconds or so!"
---
Why would they downgrade something that already looks good. That too with every operator.
---
I think this would actually balance the BOSG out, I mean it's fun to use but realistically not competitively viable unless you're against players below your skill level. A scope would allow more precision and sniping potential, but the limited rate of fire would prevent it from being too overpowered.
---
&gt; If you will choose Cav you will kill enemies and make your enemies annoyed by interrogating their mates
---
assuming you're playing against dribblers
---
He activated Wicko mode for a split second
---
That is dumb. Ppl just should gid gud
---
Don't die
---
No lmao
---
The look of concern on Blitz is hilarious to me.
---
aces are still aces my dude.
---
What is your playstyle like so far? Do you run around the map on defense, or do you sit in objective watching angles?
---
Actually, the footsteps color have nothing to do with how many, it's about freshness! Most recent footsteps are red, the older are blue.
---
the fuck are you on about

Always

*Ubi gives me the strength to finally end my own suffering*
---
My connection was fine until this exact moment. You can see it freak out suddenly. Add to that that I have really good internet and you have a clip that is proof that the servers are very inconsistent and just bad in general. And even ignoring that, it’s pretty funny to see the game fuck me like that. I’m not sure why you have an issue with me posting it. Are you just in denial that the game has issues? The game isn’t perfect. It’s not even close and it never will be thanks to Ubi forcing the devs to release it when it was nowhere near finished, forcing them to balance catching up with fixing technical issues and adding new content. A task that’s already impossible for a game like Siege even before Ubi took man power from the devs to make a Zombie spin-off and another Ghost Recon game. All we can really do is point it out when it happens in hopes that by some miracle it gets fixed and laugh it off. Still love the game. But I’m not gonna pretend like it’s in a perfect state.
---
Have you used it? If yes can u recommend it ?
---
Ah victory
---
Jager has one of the best guns in the game, what are you talkin about
---
Ubi: "You don't have our permission to end it."
---
No games shit lol but so was your internet
---
That's certainly because you're not playing on very high elo.   
---
Try playing with like 2-3 diamonds and plat 1-2 i can assure you will get ddosed 5 out of 10 games if you win against them.
---
lol i was kidding this was posted by someone on this sub the last sentence is fucking hilarious
---
Ubi: “We’ve included it at the very end of the paid battlepass, right after the “Nae Nae” Emote”
---
Why the fuck have you made like 6 threads concerning this?!
---
This is false
---
That we know of. Still a cool ace even if they were
---
*gets MVP just because of the shield*
---
That black ice for Thermite, I want it so bad
---
IM STUCK
---
I feel like tachankas shield would be better than blackbeards
---
And im offended by the skeleton key missing
---
This meme is so overused
---
So you needed 6 posts? So many people have already answered you.
---
BUY WHO THE FUCK YOU WANT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT USES
---
Thanks!
---
Idk that's the thing
---
ADD glaz thermal optic
---
It not tho, if you look at 0:11 you can see the shield is faces throw the door frame and wall. It not suspended in the air, it being held there by both.
---
They should at least give the BOSG an ACOG. I mean Kaid's got more rounds on his sluggy and that thing has an ACOG.
---
Sorry but i cant upvote this
---
Or just give her the Galil she was supposed to have instead of once again giving ops guns that are already in the game...
---
So you wanna make Jackle a recruit?
---
Suka blatj
---
 0:11 you can see the shield is faces throw the door frame and wall.
---
What’s a D1?
---
I’d be happy if she had mozzies commando 9 no acog
---
I’ve never had an ace and this is just flexing on me
---
But speed does though. It’s so impactful that it single handedly dictates operator selection in a lot of cases. People want the speed as they know they aren’t at any noticeable disadvantage compared to not having it. This is why it’s an issue. 
---
You hardly ever actually feel any noticeable different in TTK if you get killed as a 3 speed, say compared to a 2 or 1 speed. It just feels like a huge advantage with little to no downsides. Yes sometimes a rook will tank an extra bullet or two if you have a weak weapon but that’s so rare. 
---
This shouldn’t happen. You should feel a noticeable difference in TTK against yourself if your quicker so you know you have to play smart to avoid the damage. But that’s just isn’t the case in most scenarios
---
add hibana x kairos launcher to the top
---
He gets cool looking gear, usually jungle themed
---
Damn homie
---
Where is the Shotgun Launcher or Grenade Launcher?
---
Digital content in the store?
---
Blind rushing, you might get killed and ruin the win for your team
---
&gt;Devs said she had an acog in her early stages, but it made her too strong.
---
I really have a hard time seeing how it would make her OP.
---
She would still be a 2 speed operator with an average weapon (for attackers standard), no smoke or frag and with a gadget either too weak or too situational.
---
They have mentioned it however they can’t really fix it
---
You just completely balanced the entire game. We can't believe how obvious it was.
---
Also obvious /s
---
And suddenly,
---
FUMP FUMP FUMP FUMP FUMP 
---
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
---
Round 2 lost, all friendlies eliminated
---
The problem is it takes just 2 bullets to completely neutralise her utility. The fact her drones can't jump make them weak, and with all the new gadgets being introduced they need more tasers again. It's not that her gun is too powerful its that her gadget is too weak now. If the drone got buffed, Id say nerf the weapon but right now, she's OK.
---
I mean, he kinda looks more like the Thermite in the outbreak trailer sooooo.
---
Zofia is like a better but slower ash 
---
Dokkaebi is good if you have a good headset and a good trigger finger
---
now THAT would be good, I love that gun
---
😂😂😂😂
---
So it won't be fixed any time soon?
---
looks like something out of RDR2
---
King George literally has a video explaining how he plays with everything off except textures for the stream, all the other settings are minimum with exception of LOD
---
If one of my buddies tks we always make the tk ace were everyone has the symbol. Love it when the other team reacts so negative
---
It needs a heart beat sensor
---
not a bad idea.
---
Is the new gun the turret or is it just his normal gun
---
So you’re really trying to convince me you’re meant to be smart/successful when you pick arguments with someone over something petty
---
Fair enough then. Then my short input
---
Thermite - commonly picked hard breacher that can open one huge entrance into a bombsite with decent weaponry. One of the most commonly picked operators. He was #2 most picked ATK operator during Raleigh [Source](https://cdn.siege.gg/img/infographics/siegegg-six-major-raleigh-2019-infographic.png) 
---
Hibana - great hard breacher that acts in a different way than thermite. Her weapon gives her better advantage in gunfights because of decent damage + high rate of fire. Her secondary weapon (Bearing) is amazing in close quarter. She is used more on bombsites that have hatches (as she can open 3 hatches with her hard breach gadget) or bombsites where you don't have to enter through a breach, but rather create a line of sight to cut down rotation of defenders and restrict their movement.
---
Capitao - great support attacker that is currenty part of meta. His gadget is important for bombsite executes and denying bandit trick + flushing out enemies out of position. Great weapon too, with M249 you can do great suppression, while Para is great weapon in many situations
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now it all comes down to your playstyle :)
---
I play on xbox, thankyou for the offer though!
---
Question HOW?
---
Why’s that?
---
These are great ideas and I hope that at least some of your ideas make it into the actual reworks
---
That's why it has a laser it's perfect hipfire
---
Np, gl newbie :)
---
we need one headgear without those stupid glasses
---
She would not be broken with the c7e, she would still be a terrible op with no utility. Anything she can do iq can do better. She counters Intel for the whole team, and counters other ops like Jager, pulse, vigil. Then she can just crouch walk and make as much noise as nokk with better guns. Nokk will never be a good operator, unless she gets something like the release skorpion. She has no place on a team where you already need thermite, Thatcher, IQ, and then 1 or 2 flex picks depending on whether you need another hard breach. Those picks are much better used on capitao, nomad, gridlock, buck, jackal, montagne, dokki, there is no reason to pick her at all in her current state. Right now she's a throw pick. People make fun of ash mains for playing selfishly for frags, nokk mains are even worse
---
Nah that's the old Blackbeard shield you can't break that thing with a nitro lol
---
Irl counter terrorist units don't act anything like in siege. But regardless I'd rather have the gun than not is all I'm saying
---
I would respect them 'one deags' xD
---
ah yes very realistic game, pull 2 ton reforcements out of your ass, deployable shields, ADSs, etc. im pretty sure the names of the guns are the thing you should worry about the least if you want this game to be realistic.
---
Not trying to convince you of shit. You brought up education (nb not intelligence or success). Then you managed to misspell the name of a University while trying to put me down over my education, then tried to ride it out. Very much looks like you're the one trying to be convincing.

That is the link to the deltas for season 2, which was released part way through the season. I’m not even the first person to post this, yet you keep acting as though it doesn’t exist. So again, you’re wrong. 
---
My point on the pros was for one specific operator (not even Jackal, I should add), and that point was to refute your logic of “low pick rate + low win rate must = bad operator”. And even so, anybody can use a strat a pro league team uses, its not like it’s illegal to use new strats. 
---
Again, I never even mentioned professional players using Jackal. I only mentioned a well coordinated team using him. This could be a regular 5 stack, or randoms all using their mics in game. Professional teams should not, and are not, the only people who can use an operator well, so saying we’re not talking about them is irrelevant, regardless of the fact that I originally mentioned them for somebody who isn’t Jackal.
---
can we have bucks shotgun under it?
---
Once again I don’t spell check on Reddit and you’re the one that brought up stupidity at the start ;)
---
Fun fact, no body can fix dossing, it is impossible to do so
---
He meant ''Is that an actual object or a 3D render.''
---
Even a simple p90 would be cool on her
---
4 years later I still do that, especially when the match is already lost, it's a good way to end XD (I mostly play casual, before someone ask)
---
It’s different but hey, flex tape exists
---
Trust me you don’t know how much debate this video sparked, both on my gaming squad and on this post
---
&gt; Once again I don’t spell check on Reddit 
---
It's not about spellchecking. You'd know it was wrong if you had half the mind you're pretending to.
---
&gt;you’re the one that brought up stupidity at the start
---
Oh you're really trying aren't you? Irrelevant.
---
Maestro? Don't you mean Mozzie and his 3 stolen drones?
---
I personally do not think it's too strong. Like I said, she does nothing better than 3 Speed Attackers especially IQ. There's absolutely no reason to pick her just in general other than surprise picks toward the late rounds which I can see pros doing it on specific maps. 
---
Only way for Nokk to stand out on her own despite having zero utility (unless she's gonna use her gadget to find cams and destroy them) and weak gun is to make her 3 Speed and thus actually be better than the other Attackers in one aspect at least. In her current state, she does nothing better due to how the 3 Speeds can replace her efficiently. 
---
A possible buff without making her faster would be increasing her gadget usage much more and buff FMG enough to make Nokk feel better but not enough that Smoke suddenly wants to use it over his shotgun/smg combo. This would make her feel much better overall but still probably not enough to justify in using her over IQ.
---
Haha foken
---
How?
---
You haven't been home for 4 hours. 
---
It's time for a fucking crusade
---
So? 
---
It would make her viable? She's a 2 speed meant to succed in CQC but she can't because she has a bad gun and a ok speed tier.
---
Because Ubi said so? I think its in Finkas bio
---
The one that’s on his turret currently, becomes a primary option, with a more updated smaller compact turret on his shield turret with the rework. Gets the best of both worlds
---
Thanks a lot
---
hm... her face looks more refined and nice but i prefer the squarer jaw over the slim one..
---
It’s not just the names of the guns, they have to change what the guns look like so they don’t get sued. Would you rather have an IMI Galil that looks like it should, or a Galil that isn’t called a Galil, and that looks different from what you wanted?
---
Seems like you’re the one really trying and you’re trying to dismiss my valid argument and spelling doesn’t matter on Reddit so I don’t check it
---
Gridlock is in the mess hall eating mac and cheese.
---
No. I generally have higher ping (90ish to 150ish) when I play on console so this kinda thing happens often
---
it's not that bad all the time tbh. it's usually just a 100 - 150 ping and some unregistered head or bodyshots every game.
---
Ehhhhh this was a stupid comment now wasn’t it?
---
Like I said before, keep trying little one.
---
yea it's beautiful.
---
And I didn’t say that the game has aspects of realism, but that most of it was BASED off of real life. All of the CTUs are real CTUs, the guns are named and look the same as their real life counterparts, etc.
---
Wasn't Caveira the only one actually capable of countering Jackal with her silent step?
---
He's doing his job of being a pain in the ass, but if the roamer get rid of him like you said that's a relief for everybody on the defender's side and not only for the roamers. 
---
I like some of thoses ideas that people brings like the footprint color changing with the distance.
---
I agree with all of that.
---
However, no utility and good guns is better than no utility and ahit guns.
---
Should have marked this as NSFW, I'm scarred now

None because they both get banned 99% of the time
---
They don't go pewpew enough
---
Because I like new stuff? Even if it has the exact same stats as an already existing gun, its basicly an elite skin for it with new animations, sounds and even its own skin variations.
---
How did you down Ela with a Melee...
---
Yeah, I'm well upset - on the verge of tears even.
---
If we get an attacker from the GARUD, we may finally get a proper healer on attack. That could be pretty sweet.
---
I love the thought of creepy Nokk doing that flashy reload animation.
---
You found out that you lost so you don’t present a valid argument. I bet you vote Labour and support Jeremy Corbyn. I think it’s best if you have a timeout ;)
---
A desert eagle with a sniper scope, PDW drum mag, fire grip, carbon stock, cav suppressor and damage output, Blackbeard shield, and a laser sight
---
Maybe add Bucks Skeleton Key or Nomads YEET launcher
---
Mostly because the whole idea of a stealthy operator using a folding glock over the MP5 which is actually being used by the special forces in general. Not much other reasons actually. 
---
There are some ppl who are not even aware that the only benefit MP5K has is slightly lower damage drop.
---
Bullshit, everything. 🤠
---
It's so dumb that they're removing maps from casual rotation. I don't mind ranked as it should be as close to pl as possible, but casual is just for fun ffs
---
Exactly
---
wtf
---
No counter? Shes countered by running lol plus barbwire and lesion mines show her on cams
---
If they could rework Lion into shit Jackal should be reworked as well.
---
I don’t think the damage buff would be too impactful overall. Has the same TTK value and the slow fire rate keeps it balanced. But thanks for the positive feedback
---
It seems to be an good idea....
---
But i think the weapons combo is to strong
---
if anything adding the shield is a nerf. U need to add blitz shield on it lol
---
Yeah, so they really have an advantage plus they usually have stronge guns, I mean, ash’s gun does like 40 something damage, three shot anyone it seems
---
Hello aledrhys01! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
in danish it would be bjørk
---
Is that a deagle with a stock, drum barrel, acog, cav silencer, bb shield, laser sight, and vertical grip?
---
Whilst in real life Gridlock and Capitão use the same weapon they are actually named differently in game, Gridlock’s is called a M249 SAW and Capitão’s the M249. Its why they have different unique weapon skins and you can’t put on the Brazil skin on the M249 SAW.
---
Somebody is stressing the server (DDosing the server).
---
hahahah tachanke is me me hare u upvete
---
lol alright then
---
Ultimate Edition gets you all the DLC operators through year 4. If having them unlocked now and not having to grind for renown or spend more money later to unlock them is worth it to you, then I'd say yes.
---
Tbh ur pretty much as bad as each other here
---
 Bruh I’ve only played about 10 hours of that, when I unlocked fuse I put his wall mine up and killed my entire team as they rushed a room. Got banned for 30 minutes and haven’t played since lol
---
On the note of Smonk and using FMG-Pistol over M590-SMG 
---
Hes losing his impacts so that takes a lot of the oomph out of using his FMG at least for me who needs to have some ability to make holes at will.
---
At least not until Pros get to use her to her full potential. Until then, Ubi is not likely to change her. 
---
Just pray that changes WILL happen afterward and that's the most realistic expectation I'd say at this point.
---
Hah you wish .... but seriously ubi plsss :(
---
Why not just code a new gun in that has the same model and name
---
We’ll meet again
---
Not bullshit
---
Yeah I'm willing to give it a try, just wanted to point out why some people are annoyed.
---
The main reason is if you place the barricades down in the wrong spots then it can do more harm than good for your team. (And there are some pretty sweaty people out there)
---
fookin sight lasers
---
How do think he's that fast with all the shit he's carrying
---
Yes they are removing house and I think presidential plane :/
---
Bullshit for high level I got ddosed in casual a few days ago
---
Add Muzzle Brake on the silencer
---
I don't have an answer for that but probably something along the lines of "data limits".
---
Needs an angle grip as well
---
I would’ve taken even the standard git gud
---
Wow, this is expertly made. Nice job!
---
I have seen some of these problems. I've seen a lot of videos on this sub where people shoot right through shields, for example. I do wonder if blackbeards shield is also iffy sometimes also, but it could just be some lucky shots. 
---
The sound issue is a problem, sometimes my sound (Xbox) outright glitches out, things stop making noise, or sound muffled for no reason, but it's not constant and sometimes gets fixed the next round. It is a little annoying though, and if it's happening on my end I wonder if other people are hearing sound correct or if they are hearing what I hear. 
---
I do think you are coming off as a little over aggressive though, I have faith fixes are being worked on. This game is pretty huge compared to other titles, and the ongoing content is very much appreciated.
---
It deals 39 currently but the TTK, low recoil and the speed advantage while having a gadget that’s always useful and a small hitbox, is too strong
---
How can i claim fankits because i have 2 fankit and i don't  know how activate them.
---
This is basically just Maestro putting a cam on a reinforced wall/shield to cosplay mira.
---
I’m not against weapon recycling, IF they do it right... like I’m all for using the same gun on different ops, but they need to plan who gets what better
---
Yes of course, just like my dad who left for cigarettes about 15 years ago!
---
Dummie thick &lt;3
---
&gt;Reply
---
she already has quiet steps, so giving her that mediocre gun is better, any gun stronger than that would instantly demolish defenders. Already met countless nokk main that know how to use her properly and excel with said gun.
---
I honestly can't believe they are getting rid of one of the most iconic maps in siege
---
I understand why they are doing map rotation but this map and arguably the plane map are what new people will love and remember. 
---
I'm not saying they are the most popular maps but I defo think most iconic
---
LOL
---
Just loop that
---
Seems legit to me
---
Nice
---
The only case where your cover is blown is when you're trying to stand still. She still has all other utilities.
---
Dark Souls 1 character creation
---
wow, that was a nice ace.
---
You got the idea right, just didn't kill any hostages
---
F
---
imagine posting this and not thinking it makes you look just as bad
---
Sad, people who complain about spawnpeeks are really just trash at the game. 9 times out of 10 a spawnpeek can be a free kill for attackers if you play it smart lmao
---
Where’s my stim pistol at :(
---
It’s 100% situational
---
me neither :(
---
even tho i equip skins to her but people still cant see me...people still dont know if im fake or real,this is amazing
---
U sure u don't have epilepsy
---
yeah ok i can play in about a week (computer broke)
---
Thats is very true, but If you play some casual and custom matches and learn good placememts he can be really good.
---
I think put the drone to one or make them really slow
---
is it not 30 dmg where as the fmg 9 is 25?
---
Whattedehelle?
---
Why? She’s so underpowered with the largest head hit box, gadget soft countered by every deployable, and she is virtually useless to the team, finally to top it all off, she has some of the worst guns compared to every other attacker in the game.
---
Facts
---
It's only going for three months
---
But tower is still a thing
---
Thermite is made for a breaching hole while hibana makes murder holes and can break them from a distance
---
Could be epilepsy, or you just might get motion sick easy
---
0.02000
---
Some people, like myself like to use 0.002230
---
msg me ur ubisoft account
---
Where’s the attached ash rocket launcher?
---
Give him a default drone in prep phase and 1 kamikaze in attacking so that way he isn't blowing up everyone while they are reinforcing but decent idea. I dont know guns so j cant help you there
---
should have tried to get him to try it for the free weekend

September 10th
---
I swear to god i never been cought in my life by Lion before nerfs and rework and he got reworked into shit anyway.
---
The new stupid defender is 2 speed and has ACOG? Why shouldn't she have it?
---
They come out about around September 10th
---
The new season starts on the 10th of September
---
The FMG-9 is honestly like kinda bad
---
people who can’t read the sub rules before posting should be banned
---
Not neccesarily. The fmg9 is a good weapon for her. Not neccesarily the best weapon but its a good pick nonetheless.
---
The new face is fine, what irks people is the lack of shadow on his face.
---
I know lots of people don’t play this game for the guns but do the guns they’ve been giving the new ops actually correspond to there real life counterparts ? Like they have Goyo the Vector which doesn’t seem like something the Mexican military uses, once again I know lots of people don’t play the game for he guns but I think the units having the right guns is cool
---
Could be epilepsy or when I started playing I did feel a bit sick first playing just being confused and lost but eh
---
Um srry...
---
He already have Japanese operators though
---
He probably abused your ping. Its likely that he killed you as soon as he peeked, but the information took a long time to get to you because of your latency.
---
Absolutely disgusting this is , consume ketamine I will
---
They come out about September 10th and then anything be that doesn’t have season pass will get them around September 17th
---
It’s just gone for a month no big deal I hardly ever get that map anymore
---
Even those who report a post uselessly only because they read the title. You cannot report a post just for the title without seeing the content.
---
i used to use IQ frags all the time but i didn't think she was overpowered. but finka was a fine op to put them on. however if they are trying to change glaz from a pusher then why give him frags? if you want to have frags more available change it back to IQ having frags.
---
But it doesn't FIT, see what does a frogman what a suitcase gun for? It'd fit a secret service guy WAAAAY better, for concealment
---
What’s your flair? I really like it a lot
---
(new siege player) I was thinking about getting her cuz I enjoyed playing caveira and she seems like a mix of her and vigil.
---
IQ doesn’t need frags. She had to much utility before. She’s fine where she is now
---
As long as it's around for terrorist hunt I'm happy
---
I never said iq was op with them they where good but gave them to finka like I said but glaz is going be even better know that his thermal scope is a lot less anyoying it will be easy for headshots
---
I can't say i wouldn't like it as she is my main, buuut, she would literally be god
---
It would help the overall experience imo if you’re getting stomped two round you could take the time to prep for the Third
---
Elite
---
Thats the joke
---
Im strictly talking about a gameplay point of view.
---
You're a fan a heckler and koch
---
sheesh dude. not a single need to act like that
---
yeah except the console playerbase is the majority of Siege's playerbase. it's fucking pathetic. people will start to move on.
---
Yes!
---
There’s not a hitboxe problem maybe when vaulting but that has been fixed mostly and the audio is t messed up either
---
Buck uses implosion it was not effective

Set thunt to classic only play only plane or house as maps. Do a squad only thunt on normal together and keep doing those over and over again. About 1500 xperience every 2/3 minutes you can speed that up to 1 min each run
---
Somethings missing
---
Stonks
---
Idk about you but I think the fmg 9 is amazing
---
I would love it
---
That would be good plus it’s the same stats
---
Better weapon replace the shot gun with that
---
both Phantom sights operators would be more useful if they got diffirent guns, give Nokk this gun and Warden a p90
---
Casual is where the real sweats are. Got kicked after pulling a clutch ace
---
momma blackbeard and daddy valk double-suicide after killing the kids. what a shame.
---
What the fuck am I looking at? This is like a downgrade from when the game comes out, how is this any better?
---
#FakeNews
---
That would be great. The P90 is a beast if you can handle the recoil.
---
even Frost?
---
Doesn't Lesion just throw his GU?
---
It depends on the weapon and your playstyle.
---
I suggest you take a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9dk0pm/cynibots_attachment_guide_20_recommended/) created by [u/Cynibot](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cynibot/)
---
Whelp, i'm stupid lmao
---
How dare you stand where he stood!
---
Haven't played her. Whats wrong with her gun?
---
His smg type gun is bad for acog but his ar is good with acog
---
Even Frost, heavy barrel doesn't add anything positive. Heavy barrel is like FMJ in COD.
---
i main bandit and jackal (pdw) usually (when he’s not banned) and i tend to shoot in continues fires
---
Yeah, but isn't it a great idea?
---
Mate.....just fire up the game and check. You'll be proven wrong.
---
I wouldn't have gotten 1400 upvotes if I was so grossly wrong.
---
The whole reason of playing the game is to rank up and reach diamond from a competitive viewpoint, so DDOSers just want that without putting in any effort. It’s the same idea with cheaters, they want to rank up without putting in effort. I am in no way justifying DDOSers but I’m just giving their reasoning
---
I suck with shotguns. i tried finka with shotgun for a while and it was awful so i stopped.
---
Nothing says stealth op like a Deagle.
---
I mean, still I’m not putting the suppressor on it so might aswell
---
That's actually amazing. It looks even better than the original version
---
Prefire and aim for head, everyone gets headshots on pc
---
1 month was the stress point. Which people are grieving about because they aren't aware that it will return quicker than you can say "GG".
---
Cause why not?! *Shrugs shoulders*
---
really? i didn't know that. who is the host then?
---
Her weapon now is very good if you use it with a silencer, adds to her persona too and gives you a good weapon in competitive games. I would like to see her get a better shotgun though, something I’ve been bothered by since her release
---
Ty my man :)
---
r/screenshotsarehard
---
While this is true and specific for siege I was just referencing a general problem in the gaming world right now.
---
Yeah but Operation was unplayable dang near due to this issues. Also was kind of a slap in the face to all of us who had the game since launch that finally they are going to do something about the game. Plus I know my group was pretty amped for the Polish ops only to have the release of one delayed and the other pushed into a new season.
---
how? you should change your isp probably.
---
Smoke
---
Because they are sniffing their own farts. Why remove night mode too? Why remove all the other modes in unranked and casual? How about I decide?
---
Exactly.
---
Supressors in general are useless in siege. This one is worse.
---
She needs the mp7 and a gadget overhaul.
---
His recoil for the AR isn’t too bad, think he’s a decent character. I’ve been loving Ash recently for attacking, her AR is really good with low recoil.
---
Honestly the maps are so small stealth is generally hard to pull off once you shoot so you may as well go loud and deadly.
---
No you have to play hostage and kill the enemy with the objective sign on the top of his / her head its a boss.
---
Trust me no one here likes people who use kb&amp;m on console. It’s the dirtiest thing you can do in this game
---
To silent too op
---
Why would you have an issue with a 1 month rotation?
---
I can understand if it was a 3 month rotation, but it is just a 1 month. It barely makes a dent, and I play more casual than ranked so I know the casual experience.
---
I thought so too!
---
No that’s fucking retarded. If they disconnect it could genuinely be a connection error. To make people go back to the lobby, party up with their friends and queue again would take forever
---
I hope it doesn't come back devoid of personality like Hereford.
---
you can try to ask your uni to fix it or just use a vpn/proxy
---
Flash or muzzle usually for me
---
Yeah, that's why I had this feeling where I needed to share it.
---
Yatch
---
It adds recoil, so it's honestly better without it! But if you like it with the extra recoil and the sound difference use it!
---
Yeah that integral supressor does more damage now than the unsuppressed mp5, which is kinda funny.
---
Yea let’s just take out the best map in r6
---
1 ft drop off
---
I never knew! I’ll try it now with out it
---
Nøkk is as if vigil and cav were siblings and had a child. Just a pretty useless one. I wish I could leave out the last part
---
Soft and hard floors, walls, common gadget placement spots, where vigil or pulse are if you spot them on your sensor. You should be able to know where the gadget is by seeing it on your sensor.
---
BTW, yes, they had the (not apartment number, but) address correct. So they obviously violated PSN privacy by wiresharking(?) my IP from PSN AND THEN continued to threaten the address, report me, and I get the ban.... Good job, Sony, good job.
---
Hate to break it to you, but this is an old cam. Seen it many times before, so reckon you will find it on some youtube vids if you look around. Still nice you found it on your own.
---
very helpful thank you!
---
So they didn't rewrite the whole engine, they rewrite and structured the recoil animations.
---
Bruh is that a smash Bros invitation letter?
---
## bruh 💪💀💀🙌😤
---
I think they’re vinyl figures, kinda like POP figures but for Siege. You can buy them from amazon, and I think you can order them from the ubisoft site.
---
Anyone know how to re-enable the operators voices? I disabled them in 2017 because of "you can stop worrying about grenades now" shit and now I can't seem to find them in the options.
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Her smg is the exact same in all stats as the MP5SD, why do people keep proposing it as a "buff" ? The P90 is even *weaker* shot for shot and is pointless without ACOG. 
---
Give her Vigil's K1A, the UMP45 or the T-5.
---
thank you all ^ very helpful info
---
Which is why I said a much better solution is how csgo allows you to select a few maps to never queue for.
---
Link the sub to post it on
---
Best to report or use it at risk of ban
---
Oh fuck it's worse
---
Can you educate yourself they are already fixing the way that PC players normally ddos the whole server.
---
Newcommer is even more limited , and restricted to level 50 or below. And is pointless.
---
We had 14-16 when we joined. Easier for us. I see no reason why new players should be overloaded with 22 maps. They should have it easy and methodical as well, especially considering that these maps aren't all in ranked and most of these are utter garbage.
---
And especially considering that it is for just a month, it is a good clean rotation that allows new kids to learn it gradually.
---
The camera isn’t even close to invisible.
---
Well they added the suppressor to the deagle for nokk without Blackbeard or valk getting one
---
nah it's pretty mediocre
---
I can't remember if source had it but I seem to recall csgo having it on release. You can select a couple maps out of each map pool to never queue for
---
What are you trying to say?
---
Stop it right there
---
Invincible* sry
---
The ump is worse at 600 rpm. It's fine to have high damage low rpm guns, but low damage low rpm guns on attack? Bad idea.
---
She needs the Kia or the mp7.
---
Deadass the mp7 would be amazing.
---
&gt; They literally rewrote the whole engine for the ember rise season
---
did they? i can't find any info on it. the most i can find is some ***rumor*** that the "engine limitations are holding back much of [ubisoft's] wilder operator ideas" and nothing actually saying that they're changing the engine. i highly doubt that they would have the time and resources to rework an engine. something like that takes years of development.
---
&gt; And it is surely not that hard to change it, they just for some reason don't want to.
---
i can almost guarantee that it would be extremely difficult or near impossible to allow different operators to have the same gun, but different access to attachments. i haven't seen what their code looks like, but i'd bet money that each gun in the game is either an object or a class that inherits from a superclass "gun" and is told what attachments that gun is allowed to have. then each operator holds an instance of that gun object. so there's nowhere that allows the devs to specify which operators get which attachments. to do that, they'd have to rework that entire system which includes working in a lot of exception handling, unit tests (i hope), playtesting, bug fixing, etc. all of that would take more time and resources than they have (i assume)
---
aside from it being technically difficult to implement, it's also not a necessity. in a game that's ever-evolving, there's a lot of work to be done day in and day out and while a feature like this may be nice to have, it hasn't proved to be a problem yet. this is the sort of thing that you only work on when you have to because there's so many other things your devs can be doing that would be more impactful. 
---
and even before thinking about any of that, the devs have to ask themselves if adding this would make sense from a game design standpoint. it's easier for your playerbase (especially newer players) to remember and understand which guns have which attachments with the current system. so when the player sees that nokk (in this example) has an mp5, they don't have to wonder if it has access to different attachments than all the other operators who have one. if they're familiar enough with the game, they'll know immediately what attachments can be put on it and can gauge how strong or weak it is.
---
&gt; They could do it just like they did with gridlocks' weapon. They just put a "SAW" behind the original name and let it have different attachments.
---
this is a viable workaround for the problem (obviously) in which they create a whole new gun that acts and looks almost identical to a different one, allowing them to differentiate the two. and while this works, i think the devs want to avoid this when possible for game design reasons stated above. but i think giving nokk an mp5 is seen as "too powerful" from the dev's point of view. not saying that i think that personally, but judging by her kit, i can see that the devs think her ability is strong so they gave her sub-par weapons to balance her.
---
Giving the FMG-9 to Nokk neutered her for any serious play.
---
it did it. it was infinite damage wasnt it?
---
Ye they aren’t in the game store tho
---
That doesnt make her bad.  It makes other operators less risky.
---
No, I won’t read the patch notes. You tell me what I need to know
---
Some people downvoted, but they got rid of it
---
She also probably needs smokes to make her at least somewhat appealing.
---
Bout to come in here saying Warden looks like he wants pictures of Spiderman
---
#KILL IT WITH FIRE
---
Ubisoft has stated in the past that they cant distinguish between ops who use weapons. Its why valk and BB got barrel attachments for the deagle, smokes fmg9 got a new sight, and why iqs LMG will be getting a angled grip. If they removed the acog for the mp5sd, then it would be removed from echo.
---
Should add the skeleton key and Glaz's flip sight
---
you know that is getting fixed next season?

The worst map other than tower ... Or is it skyscraper?

Not the one that has the tea rooms, that map is sick!  But the other one

Ps: and maybe favela.. if you even consider that a real map

PC, PS4, Xbox?

Aah yes.

Then again, the same actor played both characters, so it fits just about right.

That was one long knife lol
---
1. They can do that without removing it from Echo
---
2. You replied this to a guy who explained why but i'll do you the favor to explain again. The gun has an ACOG and comes suppressed without taking away the damage
---
Nope fuck house. I never can do anything on that fucking map.
---
feels bad who ever is on the other side of the gun????? is it even a gun guys?
---
I had the same thing happen to me with a fuse lol
---
U 4got clash shield.
---
2 shields better than one
---
Stop trying to force your notes on me
---
Why tho
---
This needs to be made into the "To be continued" meme.
---
Quite the bug haha
---
My notes? Homie that ain't my notes! That's what you'll be seeing 1 week from now!
---
It's similar to the Master Key Remington 870 under-mounted shotgun. It can be attached to most rifles.
---
Haha yeah, would be good lmao
---
Waluigi is his father
---
That seems like every new players experience mine too lol i had quite a few games that my whole team killed each other
---
Defenders have the advantage of better CQC guns. Lower recoil, faster ADS, higher ROF.
---
In my opinion, that's what makes Nøkk so unique. If you are an attacking roamer who doesn't focus on long-range encounters like all the others, an SMG suits you very well.
---
They need to buff warden or give him better guns
---
That gun is phenomenal
---
thank god, and no, I didn't know that. Thanks for telling.
---
Not enough rounds in a mag for a roamer/fragger
---
This isnt that impressive but good job to your friend anyway!
---
Killing a blitz rushing is always a relief
---
this and 3 speed would be an absolute treat to use.
---
I DONT LIKE CHANGE
---
Someone explain please, 
---
I stopped playing but this map WAS THE BOMB
---
*chuckles in ballistic storm headgear*
---
Not as bad as your grammar.
---
How's he cheating?
---
**THAT STILL IS LOSS OF CONTENT**
---
Tbh I’d be alright with multiple house type maps. There’s a tonne of variation they could do and they likely would be quick enough to put out than the other more complex maps.
---
No worry about your aim, I saw much worster and nice 4k
---
But the last one for your ace was injured this is sad
---
That just proved my point that there is demand for other modes
---
It's not gone permanently, bruv. Temporary. To make it easier for new players to learn and for **just 1 month**.
---
YANGGANG
---
Jackal no more tracking
---
Glad you’re enjoying the game so much!
---
Many of the newer maps are trash, yeah.
---
I don't either, but I had to adapt to Monica losing frags, cause I had no choice.
---
For one month on rotation. Personally Ubisoft can go fuck themselves.
---
ah thanks, i knew it was tame impala just wasn't sure.
---
The hero we need but don’t deserve.
---
Bandits want to be laid duh
---
I put skins and uniforms on alibi, because honestly people don't notice, I still truck so many people
---
You can stop worrying about feelings now
---
And from what did I take dmg cuz we were secure no walls breached or holes? Teammates maybe?
---
Noted.
---
Nah mate xD
---
Yeah except ur character is in the bottom right not left
---
[deleted]
---
Nøkk is kind of a cutie huh
---
The new operators are available everytime a new season comes out in that year.
---
hope we won't
---
Yeah, it’s probably. Lions’s drone doesn’t do damage
---
Wait what? NOOOOO HOUSE WAS THE BEST MAP :(
---
atleast its new, iunno, i like club house and kafe. hereford top lvl needs a rework imo but otherwise i think its a good map
---
Fair
---
Perish
---
they remove House from it but not Hereford
---
xd
---
yeah it's weird, they said test server will be 3 weeks, and they released it monday, but they also generally release updates and new operations on tuesdays like 95% of the time unless they have some problem then they've done it like a wednesday or a thursday
---
Please don’t tell me you are serious
---
Oh I'm not that sad to see it go to be honest. Like, house is a bad map, but it has meme potential. If ubi had just taken it out of rotation I would've been happy.
---
If you don’t know what that is delete your game
---
Sorry man I thought you might have been a higher rank, and you’re also not in my servers, I’m in OCE :)
---
Nope I only get commons, only got one gold item in my two years of playing
---
Y'all forget high sens exist
---
It is the rarest skin in the game
---
Well that is just bad from me. Thanks for telling me :)
---
His SMG11?
---
Everyone because I suck
---
I don't think you remember how the game looked like before they changed the lighting...lol
---
For real now, this is most annoying and overrated map there is, its only purpose is being played on t-hunts and I'm so glad it's gone. Finnaly less trash in casual
---
Ok sorry I’m only 12 I’m not that good at um redditing if that’s a word
---
The unranked plays EXACTLY like ranked, but it doesn’t count for points. So hopefully the real casual sweats will move there to practice their strats and casual will be just another chill gamemode.
---
Why?
---
I guess you can say that since the Canadian operators can get it
---
Wait there getting rid of it?
---
He peeker Glaz
---
Just melee the shield man
---
Unranked is between gold and silver last time i remember.
---
Because I fucking hate ACOGs and every redditor that relies on them as a crutch, learn to aim.
---
c8
---
That s a regular size reinforcement.. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I dont since i didnt play it back then but i know how bad it was thats why im saying that i dont want it back i just want something a bit better then what we have since the game's is really depressing
---
How about you just click on your profile on the Uplay game platform, and click sign out?
---
It's not
---
&gt; who's pengu
---
I hate this timeline.
---
Unranked places you around low gold or high silver then it determines where you should be based on wins and loses.
---
You don't work your way up from the bottom.
---
No ubi won’t let us transfer skins they’re too greedy
---
Then I would say don’t play with him if you don’t enjoy playing with him, or tell him how annoying he is being. Sometimes conflict is okay.
---
I have that too, but I'd rather have the camrs since I use the rogue skin for the sfw
---
PUT DOWN THE ARMOR GODDAMMIT!
---
Why, because there's people who don't give a shit about those shitty ass leagues?
---
Oof still an awesome clip tho 😳🔥
---
I've never heard anyone praising either, why would you not run the shotgun on those ops anyway?
---
I mean in game it does but the joke is that hisADS destroyed the letter
---
 
---
Because he threw it
---
it puts everyones mmr together to a number, and finds other players closest to the same number. and in between is silver 1 and gold 4, and the middle is also where most people start
---
(sort of start because now theres also soft mmr reset which means it puts you close to the mmr you were last season)
---
also you don't need a vpn if you're on pc, you can easily change your region in the settings file
---
When your position was revealed someone must've shoot you through the walls
---
This is do sad
---
Agreed
---
i mean it is, but my friends and i have indeed played 30+ games of ranked and never started as defenders :o
---
30sec = 1/5 of the match time.
---
He was just giving advice
---
Pretty sure they said it would be getting a massive rework at some point

I read that they’re available until the end of Year 4, and I hope that it’s true. The charm should take 24hours or more to get there.
---
Fuck new players
---
Nah maybe not that, I would lessen the drop off a bit more but I don't think they should ever touch the rate of fire, and no drop off might be a bit much
---
Oh no they did they actually did it RIP
---
I know but these are tips for a really new player i have been playing this game for about a year now lol
---
Lmfao what. I’ve run rook with a shotgun since the game came out. Play the game how you want,  jfc.
---
Or they could rework a map that needs it. Like favela
---
Yes that’s how it’s supposed to be. They went back to how the game originally was and now ball the legacy ops are buyable with renown but they will still be dirt cheap to buy.
---
Ehhhhhhh, that's a very very complex topic. It also depends how the server handles the connections, P2P and ipv4 vs ipv6.
---
he was level 90 something too :)
---
Don’t make fun of the guy with the name lllllllllIIIIIIIlllIIIIIlllIIIII on the other team
---
We both know that not moving for 30 sec should not make you leave the match
---
Yeah but they’re fucking around with Oregon too, which ought to be an untouchable map.
---
Ok, first off just becuase you picked an op and played 2 rounds, doesnt mean that you cant go afk and also, the lag may have contributed to you being kicked for afk. Also, 30 secs is alot in siege. Also, if you were so invested in this round, you should have not been on your phone. I have replied to multiple text and not been kicked so idk. Stop acting so entitled and move on with your life.
---
But that’s what hinders her.
---
She IS an Attacker in the end and not a Defender.
---
She doesn’t have the angle nor wide area utility advantage that Defenders have.
---
Rip Smash invitation
---
thats what i thought. havent received twitch prime ash either. maybe just takes time
---
They had it for awhile that you got all the base operators for free for a few months and then reverted it when they introduced the reduced cost for dlc operators system they have going on. Base operators start at 500 renown and then for each one you buy, the others in their ctu go up by 500. It's confusing to explain but the base ops will be the cheapest for him to start buying
---
Please explain
---
A warning on the top right (like the FF one) might be good, but after 45 is a fair kick for me.
---
Fuze if he has one I don’t remember
---
I think you may have to claim the Twitch Prime drop.
---
People actually like night maps?  It’s garbage in defense.
---
Always fuze the hostage.

Definitely not Ash, there's barely anything to her. I'd say Sledge because it's always funny how he's about to dome his teammate in the chase, and also because of how mich better he looks

Still sucks a fat one though.  Second rotation they’re taking out Oregon.  Fucking *Oregon*.  I’ve never met a single person who complained when Oregon popped up.

Why
---
nice
---
Dude, even though I am not colorblind, I appreciate this post. I knew Game Filter has a colorblind feature, but never thought of using it in Siege.

Congrats mate, you probably just helped many of the colorblind players in our Siege community. Cheers.

Ora!
---
They would just need to finish a full match, either the one they are in (if they were in from the start), or the next one they are in from start to finish. After that RFF gets deactivated.
---
did that
---
This this is the rainbow community sadly
---
**WHY ARE WE YELLING?**
---
Twitch
---
Funny, because most people yell at me because I keep my visor on all the time and tell me that other Jackal's NEVER leave their visors on all the time like I do lol. That is way too big of nerf to cripple him that much for just getting shot at.
---
In the upcoming season they’re taking 3-4 maps out of the casual playlist for a month at a time, then rotating them back in and taking others out.
---
They say it’s to help new players learn maps.  
---
I hate it though.  You should be allowed to opt in or out of it.
---
No this is a bad suggestion.
---
Thank you kind stranger :)
---
Well, he's not doing any harm to the community, if people are upvoting them, then let them be.
---
And in my opinion, they are definitely not ugly, but the amount of upvotes are definitely overrated.
---
Reply NO to opt out of casual playlist rotations.
---
Did I mention anything about consent? Bitch I know this is public imma show your mom my consent values in public since it’s okay to do as I please lol
---
A tipp for fuze if I remember right. I heard this somewhere and dont know for certain if its true but the higher you place a cluster charge on a door, the more it will spread as it wont hit as much stuff. The lower the more likly the charges will bounce and stay towards the same area. Also, Jager cant stop all your cluster charge
---
What, just because I want IQ to pin me to the bed and whisper sweet nothings to me, I’m not allowed to admit there are women who are not quite as cute as my German love, yet cute nonetheless?
---
Definitely finka
---
I'll be happy if they burn it to the ground and never have it return.
---
Thank you very much, I understand exactly. Was just confused over when they had the thing with the free ops and when it ended. Couldn’t find much relevant info by just googling either.
---
No your not. If you dont like it than you shpuldnt have bought it
---
Please tell me you're 10, because if you're older there is a problem.
---
I feel like every time I'm spectating or watching kill cams I feel like the visor is on
---
Finka not even a question
---
Actually, they basically just removed the shadows from the customization menu, every operator there looks like this now.
---
Buy it quick
---
/r yesyesno
---
I didn’t understand why the person wanted it, but hey, who am I to judge.
---
Gone for a month, along with Yacht and some others.  Then they come back and others (Oregon among them) are taken out for a month.
---
Literally SOO many people were upset with Nomad because you couldn't counter her at all at release. She'd knock you on your ass and you couldn't do anything about it at all until they added the sound, and even then she and Dokka are way more annoying than Jackal will ever be because of the fact that Nomad stops you from doing anything, and Dokka literally can just sit in site and get you out of your hiding spot.  
---
At least with Jackal there is a risk and reward system in scanning foot prints. As Jackal I have been baited following pings, and I have also baited enemy Jackals with my teammates.
---
Id say sledge
---
Does that mute the audio?
---
I have heard that is not a good idea
---
TBD bronze is mostly smurfs particularly on pc I feel real sorry for the genuine players at that level just trying to learn and have a good time get rekt by arseholes who don't dare lose their plat3 status they got carried to so go and ruin someone's game for fun.
---
It does improve though if you keep at it and make it into the upper plate players improve as those are the ranks where people take it seriously the most as they've worked to get there
---
Your not the only one bud
---
Ok thanks
---
Mw4 has console text my guy, rejoice.
---
Wait what's happening?
---
I have 3,000 hours in the game. I have probably played more of any given operator in the game than you have.
---
We knew that already it’s Been known for like 5-7 months now
---
Nah, can't be
---
Are these nostalgia posts going to stop anytime soon... or?
---
Wait... HOUSE ISN’T GOING TO BE THERE?
---
I sure as hell don't.
---
I found it there when I posted it, just like the ADSs when I started the round
---
Wait is it actually going? I'm confused this is my first time hearing it.
---
Mate I played since beta and have about 400 hours more than you and mostly spent on castle and got diamond on twice thanks to castle only. What is your point
---
Ruby, it looks good and matches a lot of charms
---
Have you tried verifying game files? And when you started playing the game again, did you download with ultra HD texture pack?
---
I had a ridiculous one today too that I might as well vent about while we’re at it lol. 
---
Duo queueing, got with a three stack that had a plat 2, a gold 2 with a 0.62 K/D, and a silver 4. Third attacking round up 2-0 we get it to a 3v1 and as I’m entering the bomb room the gold 2 runs in from a different door and I fuck up, whipping over and shooting him thinking he’s the last defender. I apologize and start to pick him up but we’re gonna run out of time so I stop and plant. Then his plat buddy seems to be watching the only door we’re exposed to so I start to pick him up, but his buddy blows it and the last defender kills us both first and then the buddy who had all day to kill him. I don’t argue or blame the friend though cause obviously it’s ultimately my fault, I apologize a couple more times then he starts bitching in all chat. At the time I’m 6-2 and he’s 1-3 even though I’ve been playing Thatcher and he’s been playing Ash.
---
Next round his buddy slows down my prep by reinforcing the wall right next to me making me have to go over to the other bomb room to put up my second one. His other buddy then gets in my way trying to place my second gu mine slowing me down again then I end up running past a window a second after the round starts and a random spray through the window catches me in the head as I run past. The other team even types how lucky it was, but this guy is going off again about how shit I am and saying I was standing in front of the window that I was actually running past for a split second. We lose the round and now I’m 6-3, gold 2 0.62 guy is 1-4. 
---
We keep arguing about the fact that I was running past, not standing in front, and they’re shitting on me for not prepping fast enough even though it was them that slowed me down and made it possible to even get that unlucky in the first place, then he shoots me in the head the second the next round starts. His buddy team kills me the sixth round and we lose while I finish 6-5, including two deaths from intentional TK’s, which is better than two of those three(the plat 2 went 7-6)... Especially Mr. 0.62 who finished 1-6 but that doesn’t keep them from talking all kinds of shit about how bad I am and how they’d have won easy if it weren’t for me.
---
Could’ve been a couple mistakes and some bad luck we move on from and win, but people can’t do that, gotta bitch about it and team kill then drop four straight rounds.
---
Eh didn’t know myself
---
That's why after more than 200 hours in this game, I played less than 10 times in ranked. This community is so toxic even in Ranked. What more frustrating is that there are a lot of simple steps Ubi could take to reduce this, but nope, better ban people saying the n-word in text chat.
---
Do you play on ps4
---
Yeah I think it was at E3 but we got some sort of trailer or teaser
---
Women get way bigger than Valk. Valk is pretty thin actually. Mostly her arms are just big
---
I had trouble reading this just cause I read it in manga directions
---
I still think a cool thing they could do as a House “rework” is to have like 20 different house layouts and each time you play it’s random which one you get. Still isn’t great for ranked or pro league...but oh well.
---
Doesn’t work for friendly gadgets tho. ???
---
It was horrendously unfun and unbalanced. There were so many spawnpeeks every round was over within 30 seconds, but if they ever got to the building then it was impossible to win on defense. The only people that enjoyed it were the people so bad they never learnt the insane number of flaws the map had.
---
The new one is also insanely terrible of course.
---
Ok. That doesn’t change the fact that she’s muscular
---
That’s a hot stack
---
At least it wasn't a legendary duplicate
---
(Meanwhile i get alpha packs at 50/60% for find a duplicate white item.
---
Make it white Ela’s gun
---
I've known this Strat since Habana was released
---
Can you pick “turned off” maps for custom games?
---
We’ve know this sense the game was announced
---
lmao this is bait
---
Mute is literally the best op in the game, can jam 3 walls with a singe jammer, can counter 90% of the enemies. The guy is kinda op in a passive way.
---
You have to aim
---
*unfortunately.*
---
yeah, its just for casual
---
Ngl, I’d have to agree.
---
People are really out here unironically calling people buddy.
---
Goalpost shifting. Gridlock is almost impossibly large, I have never met or even heard of a woman of her build before.
---
Warden: if you activate his gadget and stand still, he can see thru smoke and flashbangs, but his gadget disabled after a while, and needs to recharge. he’s mostly useless.
---
Nøkk: Very straightforward, goes invisible to obervation tools, but only when she is slowly walking. if she runs, shoots, punches, vaults, reloads, the invisibility wavers. like warden, the gadget disables overtime and must be recharged. 
---
Both are very situational and i would not recommend either.
---
What kind of women do you know that valk is "pretty thin"?
---
Wow that is the most toxic thing i‘ve ever heard, I‘m sorry. This community is just trash, I‘m also getting a lot offended by my teammates cause I‘m a girl playing r6. It sucks, I just want to have fun and then I‘m getting TK‘ed, insulted or vote kicked (if I play casual). The best thing to do is mute them and ignore it. It‘s hard, I know. But that is probably the only thing we can do. I don‘t know why people are so toxic, maybe they have a bad life and want to feel better by insulting and being toxic anonymously
---
I like it for the laughs i had with friends and randoms. The map was unbalanced sure thats agreeable but thats what made it fun pure chaos
---
Nah he just thought there was a female op in the game with a skirt.
---
It was ironic
---
Thanks. I think I will.

What made it fun for me was how I could rush with ash and annihilate teams of casual players effortlessly every round. But eventually I got so bored of stomping that I stopped enjoying the map, which is where I'm at now.
---
You thought M&amp;K users who play on Console
---
I don't think your alone, I say I have a main but I play a wide variety of opps all the time.

Same
---
Its a refrence to the map, because the backstory to the map is about a nuke that was being transported in the area and it got hijacked and crashed at the map site. And nukes well... Burn the horizon...
---
Good for you.
---
One of my first memories of this game.

At least they weren't threatening your life
---
I can find plenty of females with a similar body shape. 
---
Gridlock is large, but that doesn’t mean (to get back to the original point of the post) she’s trans or looks like a man
---
Also use her ability a lot if you roam
---
Nice playstyle
---
Youre funny, you act like proleague doesnt have uncoordinated teams/moments.  Like i said, agree to disagree.  Seriously not being used doesnt meant she is bad, it means others are capable of their full extent more easily.
---
Good on you. You get my like
---
So you're saying hardware doesn't matter, then saying that hardware can and will affect it?
---
In most cases, installing Siege on an SSD vs HDD will result in much faster load times. Obv this depends on the individual SSDs and HDDs being compared, but there is plenty of users who can confirm this themselves.
---
thank you
---
Yes of course.
---
I'm not sure what you meant? They were completely upfront about it to the point they were talking about details and aspects of the game that in my opinion - they shouldn't have been. Some of the stuff they talked about - did end up coming back to bite them in the ass. 
---
 Maybe it's because I have an engineering/IT/programming background so I have a pretty good idea of what was happening behind the scenes. I've been playing since launch. Health was probably the best season ever. It was not brutal for me because shit was actually getting fucking fixed. Shit that I was super annoyed about it. Shitty matchmaking - shitty servers - shitty gadget bugs - etc - All of that got fixed.
---
10 bucks this gets top post
---
nope
---
What does holding a shield look like in third person. I’ve seen so many clips of this but only in first person view
---
When I first saw her I thought she was a man. My friend did as well. Hell, I showed a pic of Gridlock to my friend and he was genuinely confused as to what gender she was.
---
Also you're confusing fat with muscle.
---
Lol imagine ps4 players 😂
---
Downvote this comment
---
yes
---
That map was unplayable otherwise. The only possible way to win was to spawnpeek and win aimduels.
---
*laughs in mira,echo,kaid,maestro,smoke laundry*
---
Blitz smonk and jagger are all good. As a secondary attack main i usually fall to ash or buck as secondaries, although nobody ever picks IQ.
---
i won't
---
Uninstall ultra HD texture pack?
---
maybe it's multiple people's opinion

I literally hit reply on this comment to post 'I fucking hope not', glad I'm not the only one that feels that way.
---
Ubisoft should purge their servers and download the last copy of that map onto a hard drive, seal it in an oil drum filled with stale piss and mount it on a rocket to be fired into the heart of the sun.
---
Casual for you then.

??? That's completely unrelated.
---
Join the group of players who are good at all ops and flexible to what the team needs. Usually the people 'maining' someone stick to casual.
---
Nice flex but OK.
---
The original map was 100x better than what we have now. A map can be unbalanced and still be fun
---
Ahaha I don't hate it that much, but I certainly have 0 good memories on it.
---
Honestly the best clip I’ve ever seen
---
Her arms and shoulders are big, but that’s really it. Her waist is pretty thin
---
People get worked up over the most obsolete things these daya
---
My god and I thought ps4 was bad
---
Yeah, because shes a woman and women have narrow waists.
---
Man happens on ps4 as well. Got home from work at 2 this morning and every match for three hours was like this.
---
Hey you play on ps4
---
The shadows aren’t gone they just removed lighting from the operator menu
---
Yes, I do.
---
KronosUber is my PSN
---
Welcome to the front page of r/Rainbow6
---
Liga is banned? ffs I don't know from other languages but at least in Spanish means "league"
---
Clash is clearly and way better than warden
---
I never said hardware doesn't matter. I said the game has issues with loading. Yes it being on an ssd can/will help, but the **game still has issues**. 
---
If the game loaded shit properly, ssd's wouldn't be a requirement.
---
Oh cool. Thx
---
Can you do a post with jackal?
---
can we get a 'to be continued' for that ending?
---
Rule 34
---
I play on 100 vert 100 hori and 50 ads and it’s easier to play on a higher sens with the xbox elite controller’s longer joystick
---
Recycled guns make so little sense. Look at ALL this debate.... to save a little code somewhere...? Or something? Ten different explanations with holes in them?
---
Now if two or more operators have recycled guns they have to be balanced across operators. If you balance one gun, it impacts someone else. That's clunky as hell. I don't get it at all....
---
Just make up a new gun "variant" if there's licensing issues. C7E "short" or some other new name. Make it look cool as hell and everyone (including me) will stop yammering about this. "Mira modified the \[insert old gun here\] and now it looks new and badass." Gun too strong and or otherwise unbalanced? Tinker with the stats or the recoil. Smoke's gun remains the same. New operator keeps cool new gun as part of their identity. This should not have been that difficult....
---
I was here before top
---
It means :
---
&gt; Others are capable of reaching their full potential more consistently and in a manner suited much better for Pro League. These operators can be flex picked to match a variety of situations more efficiently, doesn't require the enemy team making mistakes in order for me to obtain openings, and have better fittings for the meta.
---
The game is so hard stuck in Info Meta, an operator that usually requires perfect placement, and terrible misplays by the enemy team is not consistent enough to be anywhere near a meta pick.
---
  
---
what does all that mean tho?
---
She's bad for pro league
---
Jesus fucking Christ please no. This shit was in Black Ops 4 and it was terrible.
---
Your profile pic is connor right
---
No, I’m not
---
If she was fat her body would look like that. She has clearly defined waist and chest. Her arms are big but it clearly isn’t fat. She has big thighs but it isn’t as flabby as fat would be
---
I'm too broke for the elite lol
---
It seems harmful to suddenly be introduced to a new map after a month of being used to old ones. Also, who plays casual for that long without tasting ranked. It's gonna be harder to learn ranked when you dunno the maps.
---
Literally just bring a friend and talk a lot in game chat, scares away most of the toxic kids once they know you have a buddy and aren’t afraid to speak up. Least in my experience

Just because she doesnt fit your style doesnt mean she is bad.  Seriously.  Get over it.
---
That's what I'm saying. There are unfortunately plenty of women out there as big as gridlock, but I've never heard of one having the sheer muscle mass as well.

Hell yeah, im in! add me, I play EAS,

You know I'd actually love to see that, it's better than the shotgun

It was time for thomas to leave

he has seen everything

hmm is this eris morn
---
Oh god, terrorist hunt is ridiculously toxic, or it used to be anyway I don’t matchmake anymore on it
---
I run siege with a rtx 2060 and amd ryzen r7 2700x with 16gb of ram and I get 144fps while on max settings at 1920x1080 and vsync enabled.
---
Well the ending doesn’t go very well for me but I’ll post the whole clip now lmao
---
&gt;It being on an ssd doesn't matter. I know the community likes to think it does, but it doesn't. 
---
You literally said that it doesn't matter, which is incorrect and you are spreading misinformation.
---
Capitao/caviera will drop to 10k
---
Lesion/ying/zofia will drop to 15k
---
Maverick/clash will drop to 20k
---
House and Plane are my favorite maps in this game. I hope they get blessed by the reworks
---
All I said was that her waist was thin, which it is. I didn’t say all women have narrow waists
---
It's been around for a while, but I'm not sure what causes it.
---
I love this video because I’m told I get very loud and into this game and it doesn’t help when I am easily frightened tell your friend he’s great
---
Yeah well I’ve never played black ops four I’m sorry that I annoyed you
---
Wait what have they done to glaz? I just started playing again after leaving in Blood Orchid.
---
After he finished teabagging that asshat he did lol
---
Of course paid lore isn't a real issue. You don't play Siege for fucking lore and if you do the you're just plain dumb. Obviously majority of the community agree with the fact that this BP isn't an issue, even the most critical personalities don't give two fucks about it. Even REDDIT barely gives a shit about it, and Reddit is known for being full of cry baby shit kids. I may not decide what a real issue is but it's very, very clear that this isn't a real issue. Has any progress been made on this BP "issue"? No. That Chinese shit was an issue, it made the game plain stupid so as soon as that shit dropped it was shut down very quickly. 
---
Fair enough. It is kinda bs to pay to unlock the grind but it's still a fantastic way to reward grinders for little money. 
---
Gambling is annoying. Especially at the rip off price that Ubisoft put it at but that still doesn't change the fact that you don't need it to enjoy the fucking game. So why in the hell is it an issue apart from the fact that you really wanna prissy up your character but don't wanna support the devs? Really just sounds like you're being greedy alongside the devs. 
---
I didn't sugar coat shit. Honestly makes no sense to me how I'm part of the problem. Is it because I value gameplay over cosmetics so I don't pay any attention to something I don't need to waste my time on? How the fuck was anyone supposed to know that skins for £2 was gonna escalate to £2 for a small chance for the best gun in the game? It's just stupid to complain about something that's not that big of a deal just incase something that is a big deal happens later. 
---
I didn't even know that BO4 charged for a red dot reticle because I don't use the store ever. It's ridiculous and it's a rip off but that's all it is. Main issue is the very low chance to earn guns for a price, that's called P2W, something only F2P games should have. 
---
60$ is not cheap but it's cheap in relevance to what you get out of the game. Over time that 60$ spent matters less and less because of the time:money. No matter how rich or broke you are, you can't deny that Ubisoft gave us one hell of a deal with R6 yet you're here still demanding changes because it gives them too much money. And no, my dad doesn't just buy me shit I have to save for things. I hate that you make that shitty assumption just because I look at the value of things rather than the price. 
---
And what if it's another way for them to earn money? It's not like they're farming the players for cash unlike Activision. You really do have something against businesses, don't you? 
---
No it's not. And Siege is not coming to that point. Why are cosmetics so fucking important to you? If Siege ends up putting gameplay related shit in the BP or for money in general then I'll take back EVERYTHING that I've said but, is that really gonna happen? Probably not. So why does it actually hurt you so much to miss out on dressing up your characters? 
---
And yes I was hypocritical for that last bit. Very stupid of me and I apologise for that.
---
Don’t care to much what people think and don’t apologise for ideas. 
---
Maybe for someone of your posts add the attack and defence so people dont see what u put as biased
---
Following the pattern from last season, a new batch of Operators will see a price decrease in Season 3. Capitão and Caveira’s prices will now be 10,000 Renown or 240 R6 Credits. Ying, Lesion and Ela’s will come down to 15,000 Renown or 360 R6 Credits, while Maverick and Clash’s prices will decrease to 20,000 Renown or 480 R6 Credits. Kiad will be next season if you’re willing to wait.
---
Thank you I always do try to be original with my ideas I think they all are but I’m not sure maybe some one out their
---
You mean "Damage 999"
---
Yeah thanks man I will
---
I will translate (i think he means; sorry hard to translate over to English) 
---
I love you
