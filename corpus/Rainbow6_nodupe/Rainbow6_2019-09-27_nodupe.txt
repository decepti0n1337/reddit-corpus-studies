haven‚Äôt encountered a single cheater so far. second day on pc.
---
Unranked definetly is a factor, but what comes in mind for me is that they change the way they run the severs. Previously 1 server hosted 3 matches, now they split every server with virtual machines, so instead of one big sever for 3 matches, they have 3 servers 1/3 of the original server big, each hosting one match. Microsoft can‚Äôt just press a button and it‚Äôs changes, this need some time. So maybe there aren‚Äôt enough servers right now? I don‚Äôt know, just an idea
---
bruh insane shot. gg‚Äôs!
---
I main frost, I don‚Äôt always roam with her though. I play super90 a lot
---
most PC players don't understand how hard it is to play Siege with a controller
---
It's big brain time
---
Yes
---
Also a buff to Amaru
---
Practice your aim in Terrorist Hunt. Learn the maps and call outs. Find a team to play with so you can actually implement some strats. Other than that, just keep playing.
---
*insert Bandit drug joke here*
---
Mad lad
---
Have you heard of aim?
---
You fire around 30 rounds, then wait for the peak while they think you're reloading.
---
This is actually a pretty solid idea. 
---
Deffinetly go lever action cowboy tho. Give him a single action revolver as a side arm
---
This must've been what got him the promotion.
---
They should implement the no duplicate system. It would make the game even more enjoyable when it comes to collecting all of the skins, headgear and outfits. What do you guys think ?
---
How the hell do people get a grade for this, and what was the project even about?
---
Instead of messing around you guys should be learning how to spell friend. RIP
---
I‚Äôve been doing this lol
---
6% bodyfat is really lean tho, unless he specifically exercises and eats to be extremely lean he wouldnt be at sub 10%
---
I was maining her at the end of white noise until the middle of operation chimera. And I was roaming with long barreled smg and was placing my mats on doors and under windows.
---
Gridlock all the way
---
Nah,I‚Äôm just messing with you.
---

---
Porn ain‚Äôt meant for anyone,animated or otherwise.
---
Laugh.
---
i played lower ranks yesterday, teammates kept saying like 2 guys on the other team were cheaters
---
fun fact, they weren't cheating. even after the match ended they still shit talked them for cheating and im just like wtf
---
It also seems to be after the latest patch as well. The queue times were definitely a little longer from the start, but recently I can‚Äôt find a match until after five minutes.
---
Well damn I've had the outfit and headgear for like 6 months now...... and the gun skin for a month or two had no idea they were a set!
---
i've always liked this concept but a defender with the M4 would be busted
---
I see, a fellow man of culture who feels...things...when they see Twitch's Wild West Headgear
---
Ok so I‚Äôm not into all this ‚ÄúThickest operator‚Äù crap, but you all need to understand what thicc means, it does NOT mean heavy, it does NOT mean fat. Gridlock is not thicc, she‚Äôs just a big girl, nothing is wrong with that, but she‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe thiccest op‚Äù
---
And if you're worse, you're a noob.
---
IQ thicc? That myth was busted a long time ago

Id say gidlock for attack and goyo for defend. Both are really good for anti-entrance
---
Hello? IQ be wearing Yoga pants while slaying terrorists. She HELLA THICC
---
hehe ha
---
Kanal only playlist has secure, wish it didnt
---
There's this thing in the game, called the scoreboard, where everyone's name is listed. When you spot them and know which ops are there, like Gridlock is, it'll tell you whose playing them. 
---
The game also tells you who killed you. So you can simply read the name, match it to the operator, and now you know whose who. It's not magic, it's reading and logic small children learn from matching games. 
---
Dudes offering legit, constructive criticism. Instead of making excuses for a mistake that we've all made, own it and get better.
---
You are the first person to have gotten that right!
---
In my experience in high plat 1 last season and climbing through plat this season, there are a lot less blatant cheaters than closet cheaters
---
How can you only play t hunt
---
Are you lagging into the past? Kill players 1 second before it actually happens? Can I get my hands on your internet
---
Also I noticed that I play on neu servers when I used to play on weu servers when I press esc in the lobby
---
I love Doc's eyes in this. Like of course you did J√§ger.
---
Who checks the scoreboard mid gun fight
---
those literally look the same
---
Nomad or gridlock for attack and get goyo for defense, just dont get clash
---

So what youre saying is... Rook can be a 3 speed if he wants?
---
I was not properly prepared for that experience...
---
He shoulda just pre fired back one billet at a time. Mp5&gt;LMG all day
---
At first I thought this looked awesome. Then I turned my volume up...
---
To say the least it killed the mood

Weathers great here so pull up a chair have a cold beer

Filthy casual missed the camera at the start. Vote to kick.

---
My voice is very deep and often sounds like I am a 30 year old so people will ask bout it and I don‚Äôt like social interaction like that so I just say forget it and if someone else says something productive then I might speak
---
To this day I still believe the terrorists just walk into it because when they added the claymore they didn‚Äôt make the AI recognize it
---
K
---
IDK I don't think you can change the setting on Xbox or PS4. At least last I checked.
---
laugh now
---
That is clearly wrong, I‚Äôd know who the thickest operator would be
---
At level 0 or even 7 I didn't even knew my way around maps or every character and gadget, I can't imagine how somebody of that level can wipe out 5 much more experienced players per round right from the game start and not be cheating.
---
Reminds me of Brigitte from Overwatch.

I normally put mine up on the open ledge (your 3rd jump) as it shows a little more towards elevator, behind desk and slightly in towards archives

Ok

So fucking braindead it's not even funny, just sad.

You wouldn‚Äôt have to search for me this way either retard, it‚Äôs obviously directed at people who have opinions on how the changes have affected the game.

Bandit was cheap and bought too small a battery.... not enough AMPS.
---
LOL
---
Soooo amaru or goyo?
---
That's uhhhh what the M4 is
---
Yea that happens, seems like solo is a voice chat graveyard. You can lead a horse to water but can force him to drink
---
Its probably Kaid
---
Ubisoft said must have consulted Treyarch to help them make thus blunder.
---
nah
---
Don't... jk fam bam, just learn to have detailed callouts and get good at the bikinispin

Parkour!

I was too focused on the wire to see that he reinforced EVERY soft wall. Wow.
---
Alvinists missin brain cells smh
---
I personally stay away from casual now, I just play unranked or ranked especially if I‚Äôm solo
---
The Quarantine was caused by meteors with weird bacteria stuff or whatever, is essentially just a spin off from the outbreak event back in Y3.
---
GG on completing article 5 though, now to play through it with friends!
---
I think nvidea has its own screen recorder but if not then yeah I'd say it's good. It would be the best option then.
---
Game companies care less about console players in general. There are exceptions, but they definitely care about console game sales and microtransactions far more. I sympathize with you.

sorry what I meant was it doesn't need to be like Mavericks m4

Seconded.

I have, I just think it‚Äôs a bad feature that the voice line is as such
---
More tasers definitely.  Lol
---
Seeming sketch isnt against rules
---
You just can't leave Glaz out. It's all about the details ;)
---
I fully support this
---
How bad is your aim holy shit
---
only for close range, but its a piece of shit at mid range. maybe not on PC, but that is definitely the case on console. every console diamond i have ever seen that uses Ela always uses the shotgun.
---
On the home page of the subreddit, click on the three dots on the top. After clicking on the three dots, it will give you a few options. Click change user flair, and from there you will be given several options to choose from.
---
Probably, but they have stopped focusing on secure and hostage because of how inherently flawed the modes are unless a game breaking but comes across.
---
Are Latinas usually that thicc?
---
I want the chart he uses. For science.
---
not a bad idea, but this might be a problem on vigil
---
Yeah probably
---
OK so if someone totally new to the game wipes out, alone, an entire team of much more experienced players, without even letting my team nor the rest of his own much more experienced team the time to fire a single bullet, within a couple of minutes, round after round,  and I should not go cheater, then how do I recognize a cheater?
---
Yoyo.
---
Amaru is good but needs a 5 stack. Yoyo is good literally everywhere.
---
What? Sledge sounds nothing like he looks like he would. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, in game he looks menacing as fuck, but his voice is average
---
I got a 1 v 3 tachanka turrent clutch in ranked
---
Maverick's gun is an AR, but not technically an M4, since M4s are in 556
---
Nope
---
less servers, unranked playlist and the MMR cap now reducing player pool.

He has too good of kit, he‚Äôs got an m4, versatile gadget, and impact nades for impact tricking, wouldn‚Äôt last without a nerf
---
incredible 
---
absolutely phenomenal
---
Give him less batteries than but bandit tricking isn't even close to op now.
---
Nope and thats why im so pissed
---
‚ÄúHey this isn‚Äôt ne- oh shit I didn‚Äôt know you could go even HIGHER‚Äù
---
I thought that was the original concept for clash and then they changed it to a full length shield.
---
What's ur highest count?
---
little mans couldnt handle the skills
---
I love the idea but I remember it from Cod IW
---
Maverick has an m4 though.
---
It's actually mira
---
Can we make drone parkour a game mode ubi?
---
ah yes ‚Äú&lt;‚Äú
---
Mouse and keyboard is an exploit to me, and is counterintuitive to console gaming but they're they're not going to do anything about this and the game will survive if it has made it through all it's been through already. Sorry man
---
hahaha thats funny hahaha hahah ahaha
---
thats funny and like relatable
---
chester cheetah cheeto
---
Yeah, if there's anyone I trust to decide matters like this, it's him

That and random animal facts which might or might not related to damage per distance of guns

Yes I will buy yoyo because no friend that can ever play

I feel like there just as bad as each other I play ranked I either get put with people throwing or smurfs on other team and I‚Äôve only played a few matches of unranked but that just feels like one big casual sweat fest where no one plants when they can
---
Cavi
---
Considering their performance on Monday NaVi might make it too.
---
IQ:wtf
---
I don't know
---
Monty
---
Well, me and my friend did research a while. (He thought it was ela and I thought it was iq) after extensive research, and about 2 hours wasted, we concluded elite valkyrie was the thiccest, scoring a perfect 10 on the thiccness scale, with caviera at 9.5 and elite iq at a solid 9. However, once I purchase the new elite Mira, I can guarantee she can break the laws of physics and score an 11
---
The M4A4 is not a real gun.
---
castle but better
---
They destroy bullet proof metal shields so probably
---
Evidence Number 1 on why Gridlock is thicc: Obverse : *This Video*
---
r/USSR
---
You seen that Elite skin for Valküòè
---
and I'm here for the answer
---
I can hear how much points the person lost
---
*DELETE THIS* Not my secret spot
---
Hmmm
---
I'm talking about in ranked, the score was 0-3, and my team was 3-1, one guy died due to the friendly fire thing, and my other teammate shot me through the floor and downed me, and just came to me and tea bagged for a minute then killed me and himself.
---
I just want my Finka to look cool
---
Iq
---
And a lasso
---
Its warden
---
It's a joke, my guy
---
So were you guys properly running around like a team of aggressive, ferocious squirrels with access to military grade gear or....?
---
weeb
---
Twitch is the thickest
---
I officially call those people retards.
---
People do all of that just to be the first one to get killed
---
If you calculate gridlocks bmi she‚Äôs morbidly obese
---
I see the New Conglomerate is joining team Rainbow, nice
---
That's some stunningly good work. üëç
---
I've always wanted exactly this gadget, but I'm 99% sure it's near impossible to code properly and even if it functioned it would be bugged as all hell.
---
Not much of a discussion when its deleted ..
---
Bandit?
---
I got a plain yellow skin for valk's spaz 12 and they said it was a fucking banana. what.
---
FOOKING LASER SOITS!!!!
---
Twitch Elieüòè
---
Why?
---
Skyscraper not tower
---
It's like the time Dice put a band aid on Chewbacca and called it a rare skin in Battlefront 2
---
Not to mention after that I sat in matchmaking for 10 minutes

bruh, you know for a fact you can earn some money, check out stuff like https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/ or fiverr. Begging is a bad look.
---
Imagine complaining about a toxic community and then instantly turning around and calling someone a dumb fuck. Its ironic, isn't it?
---
Siege is one of the most popular shooters right now. Of course there is going to be some toxic people. Find friends if you can even manage to make any. I find toxic people maybe in 1 out of 50 games if I'm just soloing in casual or something.
---
This happens all the time actually
---
I know bro, just busting balls. Pogs so sensitive..
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about those spots. Thanks üëå
---
Finally. Elite iq is baby
---
Definately not new
---
They can't kill you if you're already dead
---
Just don't push Lobby where there is 100 angles to die from and you're fine. Or get a good fragger on a window and you're fine again, intel resolved.
---
Frost is actually Thiccest, comparing around 2-3 seasons ago.
---
If you're on PC check out the R6 discord. Lots of people willing to play with you in casual, ranked, anything man.
---
Pro tips, usually I don‚Äôt play kap but I might have to start playing him more
---
So im not the only one feeling nostalgic
---
I like the special ability tho.
---
Cringe
---
Or GTA
---
I only ever see these plays on console
---
I know im gonna get downvoted for this but you should have killed him for his insolence
---
I'm only just getting in myself. I've had game for ~2 weeks.
---
Just don‚Äôt do that
---
No you werent doing anything wrong he was just being an ass. It would be better to use voice chat but text works fine if you dont have a mic or it gives you anxiety to talk to randoms or anything like that.
---
Hahaha thank you

What about the name ducktape
---
He blamed it on Bandit
---
This is so old I've used it since skull rain

Can you convince your friend to share the slideshow online or link it if it's already up? Pretty please?

What do I do then ? I‚Äôm genuinely trying to better myself at it

Repost :P

Ahhh shit

My eyes are bleeding I cannot believe this even exists what the fuck. Console is another breed of beings

looks to me like a AK of some sort, looks a lot like Nomad's, dont get your hopes up just yet
---
Lmaoo
---
I do that everyday before I head into casual at least 5 times
---
I think he was just saying a fact. one console lobby is enough to make any pc gamers quit because stuff like this, just kidding. but I don't know why people care about this shit.
---
Aye thanks mate üòä

Does have a bit to do with console. Their aim was shit lol.

I love this idea

Nah you good some players are just dicks
---
English is not my first language, please explain to me the meaning of the word freind, I am not familiar with it

Yeah someone was shooting from the bottom of the window and the maestro finished off from the door.
---
Damn i got exposed
---
Same.
---
This would be Badass if this made it in the game (my next main even)
---
I'm not gonna downvote you bro. But you're right I have done so in the past but have given up.

m4a4 is a bit much for defense
---
Yeah went through this recruit main phase

From around last year.

Too expensive. Also some cities put up bids to cover costs of running events to draw events like esports and other stuff to their cities. It's part of the reason why the last major was in Raleigh; the city reached out and invited Ubi to host the event there.
---
Theres other reasons too, but cost is probably the biggest one. Events like these are huge and cost a shit ton more than most people think. It's more than just renting a location, you have to pay people to do the setup, technical staff, even caterers for the event.
---
Source about Raleigh helping Ubi front the cost.

Love the concept, but given the fact that we‚Äôve had some recycled weapons recently, it might be cool to give him something pretty unique. Since everyone in the thread seems to be going for a Texas Ranger operator, you could give him an over-under shotgun (similar in principle to the BOSG but with regular buckshot instead of slugs, and hopefully with a cool wood and engraved silver standard skin instead of the gray plastic furniture on the BOSG). It would have a tighter-than-average hip fire spread, but a relatively long reload after the 2 shots in quick succession (similar to many other over-unders in many other games, but it‚Äôs a proven weapon design).
---
Another interesting primary option could be a Henry lever-action rifle, since they‚Äôre still manufactured today. If they really wanted a unique option they could use a .45-70 Government model, and potentially give it an ACOG equivalent sight, since Goyo has set a precedent for 2 speed defenders with magnified optics on traditionally weaker guns in the meta. Of course, the need to cycle the lever after every round would balance the weapon, and damage could be played with to make it a more viable/interesting choice (perhaps a one shot to the chest for 3 speeds at pre-dropoff distances?).
---
An AR would fit with the theme, and while they could go the traditional route and just have it be chambered for 9 mm with weak damage and low recoil (similar to Kaid‚Äôs AUG at launch), if I had the choice I would give him a weaker version of Jaeger‚Äôs 416, with solid damage and mid-low firerate balanced by unruly recoil, a big muzzle flash, and a loud firing sound. It would be strong, but less of a skill cannon than those other options. No ACOG, of course, because logic.
---
He‚Äôd also need a unique sidearm, and I‚Äôd recommend the Colt Walker revolver, because it‚Äôs super iconic and I‚Äôd love to see the talented Ubi team behind the weapon models interpret it. Maybe it could be customized in some way, perhaps with a sight akin to the .44 Semi Auto already in the game. It would be balanced by the long reload time and the higher-than-average delay between shots since the hammer would have to be cocked, but it could hit like a truck. This would pair really well with the shotgun, but would still have significant weaknesses to the point where it‚Äôs clearly inferior to a primary DMR, for instance.

Late comment but OP has been spamming repost (and is still doing it) without crediting the artist. He gave credit like twice only to stop doing it only to throw a hissy fit when someone called him out on it later on a different post which he ended up deleted after his comments got downvoted.
---
guys this is a stolen concept
---
35  45
---
Wtf lol ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I would say to get rid out the M4. So that P90 isn't just a meme gun like smoke's SMG was.
---
Rated A for Asian is a quality name.
---
Well played
---
And you are a trash human being. Unless you‚Äôre talking just cas
---
i guess they're pretty similar platforms, but jager doesn't have an m4. he has a hk416 or some variant of it.
---
Absolutely amazing, I love it
---
And jack
---
Try to record an usual round you are playing and look into what your Problem is. Do you overaim (too high sens) or underaim (too low sense) or is it your reaction time?  
---
It took me like 3 weeks of dedicated aimtraining + messing around with my dpi and sens to find a good spot for me.
---
Im not tryna throw ranked games my guy
---
probably only pick a few people. like switch monty and clash.
---
Then play cas don‚Äôt smurf
---
That‚Äôs only a six x scope I need a ten
---
People do be like that sometimes. 
---
Once I got into a match, and I got voted out in the middle of the round. It was 4v2 and 2:0 and I was second in the scoreboard. I asked why but noone answered. They voted me out in like 2 seconds since the vote kick window appeared.
---
Another time, I got teamkilled for stealing a fucking kill from a guy that landed only one shot on the enemy.
---
Oh, and once I politely asked someone to reinforce a specific wall and he just turned around and shot me in the head.
---
It's not a big deal, actually it is pretty common in this game. Don't think about it, you will just get tilted.
---
This would make the gun actually pickable in competitive, this genuinely should‚Äôve been a day one thing for when operation white noise dropped
---
100% mira elite
---
Astro A50s
---
Yea i agree it is too high, low reward. If the smg 12 (high recoil) and the cz (shove-your-face iron sights) were usable at long ranges, then maybe some ppl would run bosg and not default to the k1a or mk14 for mid-long range engagements.
---
I hit plat 3 on of for the first time solo q this season. Man was a pain in the ass and gold 1 was annoying but I did it (I hit it 2 seasons ago but got carried in every placement match so it doesn‚Äôt count). So congrats man

I'll look at a review thank you

Been using this all season. It‚Äôs hit or miss (yes that‚Äôs a pun but also a fact)
---
Harder to see on drones too
---
Great point. And yes, works on Blitz making Mute a powerful anchor provided he keeps anchoring even til end game.
---
Nevermind that is 300$
---
I put my budget
---
I don't know about assault rifle on defense. Especially with an Acog(I know there is an Acog because the gun has an Acog on it in the picture), this operator would prove to be way too powerful. The only operators who have assault rifles are Mozzie and Jager, and they don't even have an Acog. If you're gonna do this load out, remove Acog and make this operator 3 Armor 1 Speed.
---
iS ThIs WapOn Of MaSs DesTRUctIoN?
---
Make him a 3 armor with an acog and then he would be warden had a child with castle and the child has tendencies to take shit so It YEETED ash's acog
---
Yeah no muscle fatigue in the legs they don‚Äôt have.

Those prosthetics hurt like hell the longer you run/walk in them. If you still have your thighs you‚Äôre gonna feel those thigh muscles working too.

Its Dokkaebi and you cant tell me otherwise

lmfao leave it to HK to make their keymod slots and BCG proprietary
---
I exclusively put it at ankle height on the side they won't have time to check before going through
---
Loooooooool this was hilarious
---
Ooh I love this
---
Yeah need a different unique headgear and body skin too something like castle's baseball skin
---
Its likely because there was a hacker in said game or a previous one.
---
lol really? in other games this wouldn't be allowed as a legendary... I have a legendary skin on Maestro's drum shotgun and it's just wood (that was also my first legendary skin)
---
in other games legendary weapon have sorts of effects and at least change the  zise appearance and design of a gun, for example on this shotgun it could be a larger barrel of a different shape or something... if not animated effects, cuz I understand it's a realist shooter after all, at least made em look different than just recolor
---
"Need more firepower"
---
That sledge trying to break the wall lmao
---
What the fuck is a m4a4 as far as I know it‚Äôs either the m16a4 or the m4a1
---
What? We can only have mainstream guns in this game?
---
\&gt;10/100
---
So 1/10?
---
I can't decide between Cav, Ela, IQ and Hibana.
---
if you do all the weekly mission (1500r) + all random daily mission (1050r) + renown from casual matches (175r per match) you can get somewhere from 6000r - 10000r weekly
---
I'll pass, thanks
---
It‚Äôs time for single shot elephant guns to finally have a place in counter-terrorism
---
the spqr says romanus and vice versa
---
id say just take off the m4 and probably swap out the P90 so he wouldnt have an acog and he would be good.
---

---
Nah i'm a kap main as well
---
That's keep it hidden though. Don't need more trolls doing this. I set them by random walls to get the enemy team but warn mine lol. It works. It did blame the guy on the other team.
---
For lap plus goyo or kap plus shield plus frost, does it need to be ankle or head lvl?
---
Just console things
---
Ive seen this concept so many times and Uve thought of it but this one was well executed
---
They should just make her gadget a hot breach ability. Not an ability that breaks a window and puts a fatass X on it saying ‚Äúshoot here‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs awesome for hatches, however. If the enemy team is on 2nd floor of any map and holding the staircases, she can just repel up and behind them.
---
This is why you watermark every single thing you submit
---
I went and looked, and found all sorts of hilarity. My favorite is a champion ranked player with 0.67 KD and looks like they get carried every season. But there are plenty of people up there with around level 60 2.5 KDs (seen one around 5.3). It's amazing that these statistical anomalies don't get put in a quarantine.

As I always say, ‚ÄúGridlock?  More like Thicclock!‚Äù

Is it real this time?

You blew my mind with your stupidness
---
Sort of. N√∏kk is niche, needs someone to callout positions of enemy Intel.
---
I feel warden is definitely in a better spot now. Has shield, which is very powerful now, cooldown is manageable, and smg12 is a lot more controllable now. Still niche, but playable.
---
But the M4A16 is just another name for the M416
---
Exactly.
---
"F**K UBI" in chat.
---
Love that last edit though

And then they backpedalled because China wasn't going to approve it no matter what they did.

But the M416 isn‚Äôt a real item, so how can M4A16 be another name for a fake thing?

It‚Äôs M4 or HK416.

Don't necks count as headshots in this game?

If shugoki is considered thicc in the FH sub and not fat then so should gridlock.

How about calling him shield wall and making him Swedish? I think that would be neat
---
Finally a clip of someone on console where they have good aim. YOU BRING US PRIDE BROTHER !
---
Drugs, don't firget the drugs.
---
I'd say shotgun and SMG only, no AR. ANd maybe 3SP1A? So he can rush to defend places.
---
gZ
---
I can tell that it's a "new" operator concept because it uses the old Deployable design and because I specifically remember criticizing it for including a gun that doesn't actually exist over a year ago.

And this, my bruvs, is why you don't stop playing siege for a bit
---
I‚Äôve never seen the Supernova do a one shot. Last time I used it with Echo I was right in front of Thatcher and I emptied my whole mag on him and he refused to die
---
I can‚Äôt tell you tbh. I don‚Äôt play her, sorry!
---
Zo is good. Keep her as an option.
---
But if you need a defender that roams, I'd suggest lesion, vigil or alibi. Lesion is more of a soft roam/anchor, but he has the utility needed to have off site holds. Plus, he is REALLY strong in the current meta. Vigil is a very strong deep roamer if you want to deep roam, go for flanks and be aggressive. Alibi is a low responsibility deep roamer that's more about obscuring sight lines and holding down sites and have angles, without the responsibility of lesion.
---
Between the 3, I'd suggest vigil if you like an aggressive deep roam.
---
What did the guy say? Loads of people like that just delete comments

That Kaplan was smart...in a fluky way
---
Is Dokkaebi good? She just seems fun. And since I have 2 attack dlc and one defence, I‚Äôm guessing I buy defence first?
---
Ok what kind of Buck wouldn‚Äôt check his corners and throw a grenade in there and use his underbarrel shotgun?
---
That there is a mag
---
You missed a spot
---
No doubt, the legendary Hibana uniform is thicc
---
Even if they were the two last guys alive, the bomb wasn't defused, so defense would have won, they changed that like last season
---
Teach me the art of thicc
---
You clearly don‚Äôt know how mouse and keyboard adapters work on console.
---
Kapkan was drunk
---
Fuze is hard on the outside but soft on the inside...literally
---
Kaid main approves that approve
---
I'd suggest defense first, and id suggest zofia over Dok. Dok is equally good, but the situation with any Intel based op is that they need immense coordination, unlike flex ops like zofia.
---
You call down, take a breath, walk from your bon fire to recollect your souls. Forget an enemy, and fall to your death. Oh, is that just me. Oh well...

Unless your Thatcher or if you have a frag, you‚Äôre not getting through that
---
I wish an improvement like this one too. I really like the BOSSG, ma it's useless now. Having an ACOG sight or this one would be awesome.
---
Is vigil a fun op to play
---
Maybe not but compared to the Bosg it‚Äôs a lot better
---
In mutes operator video you can see gameplay of the division 1

I'll have to check that out

Maestro and alibi are part of the GIS , and if you look online you'll notice that even their standard uniform is completely wrong

He still thinks emp effect stays in place for a while for some reason. It still exists.

It doesn't show a reused weapon from what I can tell so this is most likely fake.

No one of them is covered in a red circle with a gilly suit, and you're forgetting Zofia and Ela they're both female and we don't have 2 dudes yet.

server DDOSers are being banned, if you don‚Äôt know what that is just check my post history I‚Äôve posted plenty of videos
---
My favourite chapter
---
Where did you see me before?
---
Alright, assuming they are both male, change the female to male and it wouldn't change much. I just made her female to line up with the rest a s4.
---
looks fake. ghile suit operator would be pretty much entirely useless and would make them stick out like a sore purple thumb. and riot shield op also seems pretty useless if its not even big enough to cover their body
---
Yeah 2 people I know with over level 300 accounts were perma banned for DDOSing. Also seen players on leaderboards be banned
---
They moved because the TV broke but the kick timer could have been prevented by moving the right stick even the tiniest bit.
---
How do you check the leaderboard players being banned?
---
The head of that shield op looks like a photoshop and I don‚Äôt know how a ghillie suit should be viable vor Siege.
---
She's a 265 lb kinetic force bomb
---
dumb ass its say community manager next to his name how wouldn't i know him... i just said my mom works for ubi i was just joking...you obviously didn't see the setup i was going for but if you just want my attention you got it bitch
---
Pretty sure PC too, but console was way worse for DDOSing and ubi also stated for this matter console was the priority
---
Its obviously concept art. They dont use siege weapons in concept art
---
Hello tengku_razin, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d9ypje/anyone_else_experiencing_weird_connection_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

---
This might be stupid, but why is one of them sensored
---
Just names of players I recognized that are no longer on there. Their accounts on r6tracker or r6tab just say they‚Äôre now unranked
---
Lmao, recycling old skins too I see Ubi.
---
That kapkan trap was perfectly placed
---
Also the name is cropped out so we dont know it's from a trusted source
---
Lol. Did all the bans happen at once? Or will there be more?
---
My dude...
---
Dude is thiccest
---
It doesn't though, source I'm level 285 and match with below 150s all the time in ranked. It's just elo, doesn't matter if your gold 3 at level 400 or gold 3 at level 50.
---
They just used the fill tool in paint
---
No but i have heard of aim
---
Just aim as close to the ground as possible and it‚Äôs practically on the floor
---
Why the f*ck have they just not added it in but made it a toggle like call of duty and other games have done?
---
love the artstyle, looks amazing
---
nomad is a cutie
---
It‚Äôs not 14 inches that‚Äôs why
---
No no don‚Äôt spoil this spot plz!
---
Commando all the way
---
More or less this claymore garanties you a kill. If it Was nerfed (making sound, shorter range, etc.) a would give him two. His weapon loadout has no AR but to good primary weapons
---
r/hmmm
---
CoNsOlE pLaYeRs!!!
---
Fake
---
It's DDoS.
---
I know right, i discovered this a while back
---
thats printer/copy not kitchen but yup that windows a bit of a mess
---
I play on PC, and I got a message yesterday that my mmr was being adjusted because several ranked matches I played were shared with identified cheaters. I think they were ddosing
---
You left 6 full seconds of the video on that screen. 40% of the video. You couldn‚Äôt have cut it out?
---
I love how u thought that c4 wouldn't kill u
---
If you are on mobile there are three dots in the top right, if you click on it there should be an option to change user flair
---
I feel like it is a combo of the last 2, unless I‚Äôm playing warden, then I‚Äôm next level
---
You did what?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they started making him before they decided to nerf Glaz into the ground and make Ying weaker. Because he probably would have been amazing if he had come out a year earlier.
---
Is that a bad thing or a good thing?
---
Uninstalled.
---
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
---
Why
---
You‚Äôre a good drawer
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs also a casual
---
 You gave me CPR for a bullet wound in the head?
---
Is the basic idea of more powerful claymore that is wrong, it's not detectable, it has a damage that could kill a full healed doc, it is dark grey so even hard to spot.
---
We had this problem with Kaplan, now he has no laser and 50% dmg, way better.
---
Except you don‚Äôt die when you go outside
---
Did you uninstall the original or the chinese version
---
That‚Äôs where I got the idea to post this actually
---
There was no Chinese version at all due to the backslash.
---
Then why did you uninstall the game
---
It‚Äôs mostly me having a seizure because I have no clue what I am doing l
---
I have never been high ranked mostly because I‚Äôm trash on Pc but I can understand just as you are about to win and someone does that. It must feel frustrating.
---
Explain
---
That excuse never works in bed
---
I got a message saying my mmr was being adjusted due to playing matches with identified cheaters. It ranked me up like four levels
---
*i got placed plat last season before the mmr reduction*
---
I‚Äôve played pc too, you won‚Äôt believe some of the things I‚Äôve been able to pull off
---
Oh yeah it sucks. Glad the fuckers got banned. I'm only play 2 on PC so I'm not sure how prevalent it is in the high ranks.
---
Because it was disgusting to play a game developed by a company that bows to an oppressive regime in return for revenue.
---
This is what she was writing down on the menu
---
Oh no not on reddit too üòìüòì
---
Likely bs
---
where's my viagra, mane!?
---
I was having a seizure because I had no clue what I was doing, plus I don‚Äôt play siege as much as I used to
---
Honestly i 100% agree with you
---
That‚Äôs on pc and it‚Äôs from cheaters/hackers. That‚Äôs been implemented for a while now
---
Montaigne downloaded the game yesterday.
---
Operation health
---
Give this to ubi
---
You won‚Äôt believe how many stupid clips like this I have
---
Not surprised really, their leader can‚Äôt even take a kindergarten level joke and banned Winnie the Pooh from China because people were joking about how he looked like the honey loving bear
---
need to get to 100k so I‚Äôm all up for it Uplay: Jax.IGYB
---
I'm so glad this game never made it to the Chinese market. The influx of even more hackers would kill ranked.
---
I‚Äôm not a money main, but I run revolver for the fun of it
---
Dom?
---
You do realise even the Chinese complained about the fact that they were going to change stuff, right?
---
What's going to stop them from getting a new copy
---
The movements are always this bad but the aim can get a lot better
---
Damn this looks really good! Love your art style!
---
Hey! This was originally my work, as many in this thread have pointed out. I guess I should have watermarked it or something, huh?
---
Done.
---
Yeah, I bounced my shotgun around his entire body before hitting him
---
Does Frost's mat have skins too?
---
Hes a ddoser?
---
&gt;I literally just tried logging on to find out i am permanently banned due to "cheating"
---
So not "no reason" at all.
---
Bossg got me fucked up tho üò≥
---
I feel your pain, I‚Äôve played against it and played with it for a long time
---
My guess is battleye. its known for sometimes banning innocent people just because they have the wrong programs running, but I don't know how to help you with this.
---
Yeah, the guy left in objective was a level 1
---
Everyone: "OVER THERE!!!!" (baby crying, different language being screamed, screen door slamming, occasional dog barks)
---
me: decides to look closer at the paintings on the wall I've never really taken the time to appreciate.  
---
There is actually one with a bunch of dudes at a table and one guy doesn't have pants on so its cock and balls!

the fuck

Is that a counter to the bedroom/closet push?

Commando 9 is Mozzie's gun, IQ has 552 Commando

Shadowplay is one of the least performance heavy recording software because it utilizes a dedicate encoder chip built on to NVidia graphics cards. I can record 4K60FPS footage easily with very minimal performance hit.
---
Na i got the free version :p
---
How do they tell who's doing it if it's coming from multiple devices.
---
Jesus she doesn't need acog. If she's going up close and personal she needs an ump or the p10 roni
---
I dunno about the respawns tho...
---
If you‚Äôre running wireless you‚Äôll have significantly less, and your signal is even more susceptible to interference. Your ISP could also be throttling your connection.
---
Commando 9 don't got acog my guy
---
Not a problem! 
---
I can see why you had your doubts with the wording, I'll get that passed on as well to the appropriate team!
---
What the hell is that
---
His best.
---
Why then remove acog from ash what was the experiment? was it for nothing then
---
Commando-9 because reload. And It reminds me of Killing Floor 2
---
If you are trying to boycott a company then maybe start from stop buying their stuff. To me, micro transaction is even worse than a company trying to get into Chinese market. I stop supporting EA by not buying anything from them but it doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt play EA games that I already bought. 
---
Oh please kiddo, don‚Äôt try to imply that I have no moral. If you are such a noble person, would you say no to your doctors because our modern medicine are heavily associated with Nazis and colonisations?
---
not a problem. hope you enjoy it, looks real good in person.
---
I noticed the same thing, ended up finding it through google images actually. Also received before the estimated date when i purchased it, which was Sept 30.
---
OK, so you have 5 vs 5 people playing. 1 of them launcher a DDOS attack from their zombie botnet. How can ubisoft tell which one is doing it?
---
It looks to me like Ubisoft can ban only people stupid enough to launch an attack from their own network, but DDOSers that actually know how to do it properly won't be affected.
---
I tk'd my friend once and he screamed "CAV IS BEHIND U" and I didn't believe him. Right afterward I got blasted by some buckshot
---
misleading title flair?
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter they can just make a new account on console
---
It's why I don't solo queue in casual anymore.
---
thank you all. when i play other games it doesnt happen, i dont know why its only on R6
---
Right in the neck...
---
The elite actually makes it harder to do this, because the elite changes the way the black mirror looks.  I've also noticed this season that in some positions, Mira's knee clips through the window now, which also makes this harder to do.
---
To win ranked games, stress the server and nobody could move
---
Aka they do it on defense and attackers can‚Äôt go in and time runs out, they would win all 3 attack rounds. Check my post history if you want I posted it a lot
---
Hmm, not ugly enough
---
I see you are a man of bajur as well
---
Seems like an account ban
---
[removed]
---
https://youtu.be/3lUQVMyCHWo
---
Y'all were literally kicking and screaming about very minor little things that wouldn't of affected anything
---
I don't feel bad for them, they probably used ddos to get to that point anyway
---
I didn‚Äôt cheat man. I just don‚Äôt want to see the countless hours I put in go down the drain. Not to mention the money.
---
I have been disconnected from games when winning numerous times this season, one only happening yesterday. It didnt give me a choice to join back and I believe the match was cancelled. Is this part of the attacks?
---
i was in ranked... was just starting my placements too...
---
I can't find u sorry. Add me my IGN : Noobmeister69.
---
They changed it like 2 days ago, doesn't work anymore.
---
level 131 and a dropshot, epic clip
---
Please tell me this is a joke lmao
---
They need to do more to make sure they can't just make a new account.
---
Not an oversight as it happens to ALL placeable gadgets when to close to the walls being reinforced.
---
I suppose they check if it happens only when that guy is playing
---
Maybe nitrogen cooling for the barrel. 1000 bullets are too little, get 2000 without reserves.
---
After some calculations, I got the result that this gun can fire at 1250 rpm for 96 seconds continuously using up 2000 rounds.
---
Fuck my bad. I knew I messed up. Imma change it.
---
Ok, first of all, they started banning DDoSers and taking legal action against websites that DDoS for you, so that probably won‚Äôt be a problem. And also, **Taschanka?**
---
Operation Ar*****n genocide
---
Yeah they can also do that, they can stress the server just so nobody can move, and they can also hit the whole server off if they‚Äôre about to lose
---
Us console guys don't even get our MMR adjusted. Its super annoying because I sent a fully edited video detailing how the other team were were ddosing. They confirmed it was them ddosing and they said they are unable to adjust MMR.
---
It‚Äôs not impossible because numerous people that I know personally got it too. There‚Äôs numerous tweets, screenshots and everything showing it. It seems like they banned anyone that was in a game with dossers. The biggest thing is, if you go look at my win loss for this season, I‚Äôm clearly not a dosser. I have damn near lost as many as I‚Äôve won. Dossers have incredibly high win/loss ratios because of how easy it is to rank up/win games.
---
Fellow Kapkan mains rise up
---
I don‚Äôt play casual, so I couldn‚Äôt know that they did
---
Note: I meant the 552 commando, not mozzie‚Äôs commando 9.
---
Ty for your Response. I know that already but did Something already Changes?
---
This is common sense that you'll rarely ever find on this sub.

Thank you, my guy.

I would have to go with Valkyrie

---
They are easier to use now my first game back I played iq with the new angled grip and ela and almost every time with ela I got a 3k and one 4k I really like ubi for that
---
Plat 3, its some ideas to counter old game
---
It would be a lot more funny if they said lines more often too. The person that talks the most in that game is the Arab guy saying not to board the helicopter on the Arab map.
---
I actually hope its not, the idea is they don't want people finding work arounds
---
insert downvotes here please lmaoo
---
This is the third picture I've seen of DDOSers being banned. 
---
The first two were proved fake the next day.
---
&gt;Plat 3
---
X *doubt*
---
my idea:
---
the number of ping should decrease when the color is warmer
---
so 1 ping when footspet is red to the actual state when it's blue
---
that way it gives Jackal use the approximative position of the defender and for the defender the approximative position where jackal scans the footstep
---
Remember when togepi was the most unrealistic character? Ah, if only I could tell younger me about the australian SAS.
---
Name is almost a font, nice
---
People always want the upper hand even if it‚Äôs unfair 
---
They don‚Äôt get any rewards from it
---
Yeah the one time they listen to the community, they do good.
---
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER. I REPEAT: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER.
---
Only certain games. Not Ubisoft games cos they don‚Äôt allow on console
---
Good spot.
---
It's TaChanka mate.
---
Nah Im mostly joking. Joseph used to be my fav until... some stuff that you find out about in part 4 (trying not to spoil for peeps who haven't seen).
---
They cant do anything, unless Microsoft and Sony does something, it cant be solved
---
More like....goodbye enemy's IQ.
---
Not really. He can hold long angles and punish peakers but he shines when defending and holding a plant, especially on maps like Chalet and Consulate
---
Was looking for this.
---
No offence, these are horrible
---
There is no Tiannamen Square

I've met √† full LvL300+ squad in ranked last week. They were bad af and they've finished by DDOSing ahahah so good to know they'll lose a LvL300 account
---
No.
---
He's fine now. A lot more usable. Fulfils his role as a support marksman.

Wow that disrupts planting?

Okay, what is different about them then? Please point out some clear and obvious differences between the two because you can clearly see something that no one else can. Please, enlighten us...

Wait you can play Bartlett on terrorist hunt

Yup

That I can agree with.

That‚Äôs sweaty?

Looks like a cluster charge shudder.

Yes apparently, happy bout it
---
Alright, we get it, we won't board the helicopter. He is just annoying the operators more than anyone else.

No idea why they didn't to be fair. Considering they got punked by echo the round before as well. It was an ez win for us though

I would have followed you 4 days ago, but myvphone was dead and i lost my charger... but now that my phone is charged, you now have +1 follower
---
OP EXPLAIN!
---
yes, ok, i accept your opinion, which op do you modify? I'd like to know your ideas (im not joking)
---
Since it's been all female attackers next season is likely a male attacker and female defender to end the year.
---
I'm probably wrong and the Indian attacker is a female and the Kenyan defender is a male
---
Couldn't have said it better. It makes like it even more
---
You‚Äôre a bad boy
---
Wait WHAT they're changing a masterpiece of a character this cannot stand.
---
&gt; If people continued after they publicly announced they'd pursue them and changed the server structure, they are just stupid.
---
They used a DDoS in the first place, so... Yeah...
---
&gt;Most definitely, it wouldn‚Äôt change shit, 
---
Oh Lord, here we go again.
---
&gt;if he has the ability to pick up drones, then he would then have a balance against attack, I don‚Äôt think throwing drones is that big of a buff,
---
It is a HUGE buff. You see essentially giving the 2nd most versatile Intel op on defense who's banned more than valky in PL the ability to be mute+call+part of echo. How is that even remotely balanced?
---
Right now, attackers will have to look out for 3 of his drones. Buff him with this unnecessary buff and now attackers will only be able to spot 2 of theirs and 3rd can be kept hidden safely to pull out even at the 15 second mark to make life miserable for attackers. That's a nerf to attackers as a whole, and IQ, who's the only one who can detect mozzie drones right now, and thatcher as well.
---
Have you not seen some if the bonkers echo drone spots that echo can achieve by **throwing his drone**? Bank ceo top shelf, border lockers top corner, borders offices top shelf, kafe above trains, bank lobby at the chandelier....the list could go on, and I'd be 70 by the time I finish! This is a monumental buff to an Intel op that can turn attackers' Intel against them. I'm sorry, I don't see the sanity in this buff, especially considering his pick and ban rate in PL. And I LOVE mozzie, he's amazing, but this is insanity. This is an illogical idea to buff an already extremely powerful op that rivals Valkyrie in in versatility.
---
If you want to save your drone, learn to save the drone. Mozzie is not an attacker.
---
&gt; as everyone else in the damn thread agrees just about
---
"Everyone else"? Hoss, just one dude agrees and 2 disagree with you. What are you on about?
---
Same caliber, not same cartridge
---
Sometimes i also call her applebees.

I said hammer time aloud for all of those swings and it was great

That joke was already posted down below, kid.

Probably PS4 (no offense to console players?

Fmg9 isn't worse than the p90. P90 is worse.
---
No, but ubisoft thinks so
---
No I was, and I don‚Äôt remember anyone freaking out about it.
---
It‚Äôs the same with elven for capitao (rare) and golden ivy for jager (legendary)
---
Sledge?
---
I get that shit all the time bro
---
Yes!!! Can I get an AMEN
---
Well that's not how nerfs work. You nerf her because he or she has extra and you take that out.
---
If you are nerfing the f2, nerf it. Case closed. Why buff the drone? The drone was never the problem. The gun was.
---
What a bad Vigil, getting spotted on camera. üòÇ
---
Wish I could use photoshop, totally would edit him out and add some white noise graphics. üòÇ üòÇ
---
Now that‚Äôs how you play sledge
---
Twitch already does more than enough AND supports players. Why buff something that's already powerful?
---
Is that 21:9 on a 16:9 monitor on 60 fov?
---
There is Nokk but you can't see her and her box
---
No. Cross-reference other games and a trend will emerge. DDoSer would be consistently on the winning side of a DDoS'ed server. As well as his friends who know he's cheating. Ez ban for the whole group.
---
How am I lying
---
—á–∞–Ω–∫–∞ –±–∞–Ω–¥–∞
---
what barrel do you use on it?
---
Now you gotta drawn her and a defender getting blown back from a wholesome moment by an Airjab
---
How are they able to know who initiated the attack though? The kid paid a service to ddos so there should be no link back to the ddoser.
---
Here was my experience if any one cares, 1 game away from Diamond on console was my highest but Plat every season. My first ranked attempts on PC was Gold and that was with no squad like I had on console and damn does that matter.  If I had similar players like I had on console rank would be identical imo which would be Plat.  Placements are always gold for me it seems.
---
Level 106 Ranked PC k/d 1.26 (lifetime 1.46) 
---
My K/D ranked issue stems from adjusting back from a hip 25/25 50 ads to a 10/10 83.  That took a bit and my total games played was around 13 last season as I jumped in literally the last weekend before new season.
---
Level 137 Ranked Xbox k/d 1.61 (lifetime 1.71)
---
Level 140 Ranked PS4 k/d 1.82 (lifetime 1.64)
---
The game is just so much different between the platforms. I would love to see some diamonds vs diamonds PC vs Console.  There are some console guys I see playing that I am absolutely certain would trash PC players and could definitely compete with high level players on PC.  The issue is I don't see as many high level console players as I see high level PC players and I don't see one insane console player being able to hold it against more than one on PC.  I'd still love to see a tournament that had some crazy squads able to vs.  Who knows, maybe some day Ubi will add crossplay.

Hello m3m0yFPS, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/da2dc4/wtf/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
###Caps lock title
---
The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.
---
Please re-post your submission using standard letters.
---
Shotgun, cav pistol
---
or any gun where due to the dmg dropoff from range, penetration and other dmg reductions (like armor) lead to situation where the gun only did 2 dmg (or 1, by I dont think thats possible).
---
Headshots are not "instant kill", there is just 50x multiplier to the dmg. So if you have situation where you would only did 2 dmg to body, headsthot is 100 dmg and therefor only injure.
---
Smoke is fine. No need to change a perfectly acceptable operator to try and buff a shite one
---
Hell yeah
---
Cav, shotgun
---
/s
---
You're pretty good.
---
Bruh this R6 it ain‚Äôt cs
---
meaning?
---
My favorite spot in the entire game is the skylights in main lobby on Bank, no one ever looks up there
---
One taps
---
so what is it called? XD
---
It's the statistics. If you're consistently winning when your server is DDoS'ed you're an obvious cheater. It's a no-brainer.
---
If this is actually your drawing, amazing. I can't even draw a stickman correctly.
---
U r the R6 ScreaM
---
All spawn killing Doc/Rook mains should experience this everytime they try to spawn kill
---
Uh, because they made a reddit post with a brand new account and then their buddy chimes in and says he plays with the banned player all the time but the buddy didnt get banned.. so it has to be true, right? /s
---
U getting banned sounds more likely
---
They still havent banned people. Look at the leaderboards. The guy who is #1 had a hilarious 8000 mmr last season and this season hes on a 348 match winning streak with an average kills per match of 1.5...

It's a sign to stop being an asshole to people.

You cannot confirm it is not true. You can work out what should happen yourself between someone with high ping peaking someone with lower ping. What collin said is correct.

I wasn‚Äôt banned but ok
---
There's just so many good balance ideas but either it never gets to Ubisoft or they're like naw
---
i want an airjab impact skin
---
I feel like it could be beneficial but at the same time, no matter what, people would complain about PC having ‚Äúan advantage‚Äù over controller.  I won‚Äôt get into it since you said you don‚Äôt want to hear it, but it‚Äôs impossible to ignore that that‚Äôs what most people would whine about, even with an opt out option.  Other than that, I don‚Äôt really see a reason why Ubi shouldn‚Äôt attempt to implement it in some way, even if it‚Äôs just Xbox with PS4.
---
&gt;probably because the ***best*** smg is more widely used

I prayed to God about ddossers and as I prayed a small faint voice descended upon me like a dove from above and for a moment I heard the sweet voice of God whisper "fuck em"
---
communication on console is almost nonexistent
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it was the fake leak he‚Äôs talking about, if it‚Äôs the one with the gas masks and the riot shield it‚Äôs fake.

I use a lot when an enemy destroys de decoy to know when I need to flank

Damn. What did you hear that made you shoot the window?

this thread is something else. this is such a stupid change, his whole point is to gather precise intel

For now. There's a map rework coming.
---
I think maestro might be the laser turrer
---
What did he do to get banned forever
---
You should draw for comics
---
I know that's why I play in a squad, and that's why jackal is so easy to use because he requires no communication, ops like valkyrie on defence are extremely powerful when a team communicates instead of just pinging the attackers
---

I don't think he's exactly racist. He's pointing out what seems to him to be a correlation, and it's something I've noticed both over R6: Siege and For Honor. People with a Spanish name (or in For Honor a Mexican Flag emblem with Spanish name) seem to generally play only things in the meta and tryhard to the extreme.

Yeah, but this is people breaking the law, it's certainly not too far, and any system like this would have to have redundancies. Plus, it'd be easy to spot a DDoSer if someone's console is sending out a bucketload of packets and someone else crashes.

Might be helpful to find a way to set up your port forwarding. You‚Äôll have to look up how to do it, I‚Äôm not sure what would differ.

Wrong tag, but kinda funny
---
So when are they gonna start banning the top console players on r6.tracker.network the pc player has 150 wins and 50 losses, the xbox player has 56 wins and 0 losses, and the ps4 player has 123 wins and 0 losses. Its not hard to find the players that ddosed just check there stats if a pc player cant win every single match console players shouldnt be having flawless profiles like they do now.

I've never seen that one but I'll give it a try next time

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

I hate this complaint so much. A lot of the time, I play casual casually, I run about with good guns, spawn peek and runout. Stuff that I don't do if o want to win because it's stupid and easy to punish. Then, some Muppets die to obvious shit and complain that "wah it's casual" I'm like bruh I'm playing casually stop being a 4head.
---
I'd be so pissed üòÇ

They can either trace where the ddos came from or they can more likely see that there is 1 player always present when an attack happens.

Skyscraper is such a shitshow it's not even a competition. Some comments here are saying that Fortress is "boring" (even though it really isn't) when that doesn't matter at all if it's balanced.

I think people bam him because they dont want to bring his counter, thatcher at where im at (high gold to low plat) is barely played, so instead of forcing yourself to, to maybe stop a echo from denying, you can just ban him

Surprised she didn't back out.

Lower sensitivity tends to be better in R6 ngl. I love high sensitivity in games but when I turned it down I IMMEDIATELY improved with my aim.
---
Yuss that's my point. He requires no communication currently, you just scan footprints and boom, your whole team knows where that person is. THAT is why he gets banned so often. Maybe make a defense operator with a direct counter and I would forget about needing Jackal but that's hard to think of.
---
Uhhh UK ?

I guess she thought her teammates might save her she was wrong

Because white power is directly related to racism and the KKK?

I've found multiple bugs with Blackbeard this season but I've never seen that one. Report it to ubi. That's the best you can do.

Looks like my toilet after Mexican night.

The fact that you went in there without droning and didnt get gunned down immediately surprises me

dose it work like you know in game to irl?

Some may use it, it doesn't have that meaning though. I can call Asians "Yellows", that doesn't make the word "Yellow" racist. The phrase WP is directly meaning the supremacy of the "white race" over the others. BP on the other hand doesn't imply that.

If done right, as I understand it, it lags the other team so much that the become nearly immobile and therefore easy kills. Also potentially your own teammates too. But who cares cuz you get an ace!
---
Zofia is so good

I played it when they offered an epic pack but currently no reason to play it.

That happened to me

If u played at a High Plat or Diamond level we started to feel it heavy during Wind Bastion, then Burnt Horizon was just stupid my core group and I tried to keep count of DDos games, I had 68 and my brother had 72. I was plat 1 the whole season. Last season I had that many games DDosed and played half of the amount I did in Burnt Horizon. And this season I have played 24 games and am not even ranked yet, I need 1 more game. So yeah once this happens fully I will be back but after suffering through this game since Skull Rain in Year 1, this is the first time I ever said F*ck Siege and refused to play it.

Lol that‚Äôs ridiculous. I deserve the ban tho
---
Maverick. I think every op should have some form of counter on the opposing team and no operator in the game can counter him
---
It can destroy shields also. But be careful, now that goyo is around
---
But where does it go?
---
Because it‚Äôs funny to some people. I forgot that this is reddit, home of the butthurts
---
;(
---
Im finna toss a valk cam in one and see how far the pipes go
---
This. Its like asking when they'll let us use old season camos on new ops. They dont want to put in the work if they don't benefit from it. Dont get me wrong i love the game but id love to use my skull rain camos on people that dont have access to them
---
Oh okay
---
Well it make sense tbh
---
There‚Äôs more context to the story then this. Don‚Äôt be too quick to assume a story. The dude was talking mad shit in game chat, worse than this. I‚Äôm the one that got banned since I did it over voice message
---
A really big fucking *shit* coming right up
---
Most of my friends are in silver but they‚Äôre still better than randoms that tk you because they didn‚Äôt get the defuser and go like 2-7

We didn't make a voice message telling a guy to kill himself

oh

Oh your fine, I was wondering how I forgot an entire map.
---
Fuck you, I got there first.
---
Well fuck me... excuse me I‚Äôm gonna go shoot myself peace out ‚úåÔ∏èü¶Å‚ò†Ô∏è
---
It does because when someone‚Äôs lagging, in games like Csgo the hitboxes are designed to compensate, in siege it‚Äôs not.
---
some ppl play 16:9 others 4:3 this dude straight up plays 5:7
---
They need to make the lardex armour out of the porcelain from that toilet.
---
Time to get downvoted!

Tachanka, no utility, no usefulness, his memes have run dry, his rework is never coming, just get him out.

That being said I can't say that here, so Ash, cause she the Call of Duty operator and that has no place

Yeah, that's not how toilets work. If the toilet worked like that, it would never hold water.
---
I'm glad one of my friends is getting good, he actually got put in Silver 1 and made it to Gold 4 before the new season, I think he can compete with the Golds higher than 2.
---
I think the toilet is blocked now..
---
Try learning to tap fire it helps with the recoil of the gun and makes it easier to aim
---
Good for you guys. You shouldn‚Äôt take any type of criticism online personally, most people would laugh if they got this message but reddit takes everything too seriously
---
You still did it buddy, just because he was talking crap doesn‚Äôt mean you get a free pass to stoop to his level. Especially since you escalated it to private messaging. Plus If your willing to do it once how do I know you have not done it many other times or even if what your telling me now is true.

Echo‚Äòs MP5SD (legendary) and CapitƒÅo‚Äòs M249 share a skin as well.

I was only 6 MMR away from plat 3... decided to play with a friend now I'm at silver 1

Second this, lmao.

Fr though OP, Nokk can be hella' fun. Just remember that: the Deagle is your primary and Dokkaebi is your best friend.

---

D Jagers

S acog

Luck or what
---
CSGO hitboxes are the way they are for consistency with previous titles. It's for that same reason why the shooting still uses the same blooming crosshair and pre-determined recoil pattern instead of newer games' modern shooting mechanics and random recoil.
---
I agree, however it's obvious they're making an effort already to add my diversity as it is. Hopefully they just keep on the beat and exploring different cultures and whatnot with operators
---
agreed
---
The game with the earmuff hitboxes? Or the game with the janky laggy ones?
---
Hello N√∏kk fan
---
Blitz, the shield is just too cool, imo. Twitch is good too as well as Sledge
---
What are you talking about operators are from all different cultures, backgrounds and races lmao.  You do realize that only around 10% of the world is african american.
---
It really doesn‚Äôt matter in my opinion if there are ‚Äúpeople of color‚Äù in anything, if they choose to put someone in that is, whatever, if they don‚Äôt, whatever, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to ask questions like these when it has nothing to do with gameplay
---
How would you rate the ultrawide experience for siege? I keep hearing conflicting opinions about it
---
Do you have the STL? I can't find it with Thingiverse's terrible search function
---
It‚Äôll eat its baby on accident
---
It was the burritos
---
I'm quitting if I die via toilet bomb.
---
Also why the fuck are we bringing races into video games jesus
---
Just change it in settings once and then you‚Äôre done, the game is based on multiplayer action so added a pointless feature like this makes no sense, sorry
---
thank you for the answer
---
The truth is you are only going to learn by playing the game and experiencing it. That being said really try to work WITH your teammates to get the most out of this game. Just simple communication is extremely helpful. No "there" or "where I died", try to pick out anything that can be used as a reference, then call that out also taking into account others location. Ex: "he/she is to the left of red chair/computer desk/corner hallway" also to help, there is a compass on the bottom of your screen that gives you the room/location name of wherever you are, also helps with direction, cause ya'know...  it's a compass. I recommend fuze's AK or sledge's L8A6 as good rifles to use. OPERATOR TIP! Fuze's cluster charge shoots out in a flat line from right to left. By learning maps you can picture what's on the other side and basically aim the grenades. Everyone will love if you play thermite. Hard breaches are like our version of mercy's from overwatch. Thatcher and thermite are an unstoppable force with some teamwork. Defenceman that are amazing for beginners are doc and rook. Doc heals, rook forces you to go down before u die as long as you didnt succumb to a headshot. Mp5 is a very strong gun, acog, grip, flash hider or muzzle break. Yea, just pay attention and make an effort to learn, and we just might make an operator out of you. Welcome to siege! [-]7
---
None of those things are a problem anymore the earmuff thing was fixed years ago. Nice try
---
This is one of the most diverse games I've played and I've been gaming for three decades.
---
No we don't need more, stop pushing this agenda and lets make America COLOR BLIND AGAIN.
---
Is that a furry joke?
---
I still think the game with 5 seperate hitboxes just for the head has better hitboxes.
---
It feels nice to be represented in a video game
---
I think someone on g2 mentioned one of the empire players were good with Nokk and they needed their cam info
---
You just said that it wasnt for the fact that it is your race bruh.  Delete this post.
---
Imagine someone can die from that
---
Superiority complex much?
---
Race was first brought to videogames when a human character was first displayed.
---
Tarkov has absolutely spoiled me in modding. This game has a pitiful selection of optics, muzzle attachments, and really the whole modding system.
---
This might‚Äôve well been Tachanka‚Äôs Pro League skin.
---
I would imagine casual and ranked are the most popular playlists.
---
It could also come down to gameplay mechanics, not to be racist, but if they‚Äôre sitting in a dark corner, doesn‚Äôt it give them an advantage?
---
I really wish this game didn‚Äôt have the scummiest business practice when it was launched. 
---
It actually looks good.
---
Hooray, I didn't have to be that guy :)
---
Stop flexing bud RNGesus is just good to you
---
I usually roll my eyes at these types of suggestions. But this one I‚Äôm interested in. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt even need to be useable from a drone. There are already some crazy abilities in siege. If this one was implemented properly it could be quite useful without being too over powered
---
A friend and I*
---
How the hell did he just randomly find that out?
---
It probably only reaches to the back of the toilet model.

Im pretty sure one of echo‚Äôs primary skins called rekt is a direct rip from one of capitao‚Äôs purble LMG skins
---
It‚Äôs better with volume... lol
---
Toilet Shitboxes
---
I made it an attacker since characters like twitch, iq, and thatcher are already so powerful, and mozzie needs more to do than hack normal drones and a occasional shock drone. Also nomad in high ranked games (The highest rank I've ever gotten is plat 2 in grim sky and rn am a gold 3) and in the competitive scene is banned a lot and claymores in pro league aren‚Äôt that big of a deterrent. 
---
Plus, imo Maverick‚Äôs blowtorch doesn‚Äôt need a counter due to the devs making it louder and making the time to switch slower.
---
I‚Äôve literally opened around 4-5 hundred by now and only have three black ice skins
---
Dri paloski xopaxo
---
Shitbox
---
Wait, this wrong on SOOOOO many levels...like boi ur playing with a compressed res, then ur teammate...where is this casual, I want it
---
Hold up
---
Then you didn't draw it.
---
Lmao pls no
---
Makes me wanna buy special event packs lol
---
I think you mean *shit*boxes
---
Pls send one over :c
---
make one that catches relativistic kill missiles from outer space?
---
Thank you. If you care, i had some other good ideas if you wanna view my profile. I‚Äôm not a dev that knows balancing characters all that well, but I do think they are at least somewhat applicable ideas.
---
To be honest, wouldn't even be mad
---
Wouldn't even be mad.

Couldn't find it, but I'll take it down

textures and shaders do a lot to trick the eye
