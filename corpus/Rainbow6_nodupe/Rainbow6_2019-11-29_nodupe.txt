It‚Äôs just trolling nothing can be done about it

We‚Äôre you playing with Theo Von?
---
For new players, sledge.
---
When he‚Äôs 4 kills into an ace you cap him
---
Epic
---
Off him next game you play with him
---
I believe the result is that it's much harder to down enemies with it, so you have to use the luison to do that.
---
I agree, but I think mute also works here as well
---
Find other friends
---
Plats in casual are a little, different.
---
Than they should rework it. Barlett has unique style, but ubi just left and forgoten that map.
---
Aight. Thx
---
Just the weird operators that I main lol. Well, Jackal not so much now... but
---
^Get ^Linux
---
It is really supposed to be used to strategize and prevent the enemy team from doing something. If you want to go nade heavy, then you use ban jager for example.
---
Post this twice?
---
I can never draw hands. 
---
Evie did a better hand than I ever could
---
No, they've said they're going to be fixing it in an upcoming season, Y5S1 IIRC. They tried a few different things in the past, but it never really worked well. I believe this one is an intensive fix and should stick. Kinda crazy it took this long though
---
*sad MeatyMarley noises*
---
So close I want to cry
---
They should absolutely rework it. But I think it might need a complete overhaul.
---
Nicceeee
---
No it wouldn't. Your reasoning is fundamentally flawed. Do you understand the basis of pick and ban?
---

---
How would it? 
---
&gt;If Ubi wants to turn the pick and ban system into something that actually matters, and actually makes the match more interesting
---
It does matter, and it makes it more interesting. It just requires some common sense, game sense, and an understanding of the concept of "contingencies" and "strat shuffles". Oh, and not making dipsh*t stupid bans like blitz and cav everytime.
---
This community will never get the true flavour of pick and ban (and hence, 6th pick as well) as long as they make stupid comfort bans to eliminate that which they refuse to learn to adapt to.
---
The system is fine. In fact, if you look around, there are petitions from high ranked and pro players to add in a "ban-save-ban" or "+2 or +4 bans" system because of how influential the ops being released now are and how bans aren't making any difference because viable alternatives exist (like beard man to bandit; wammy to J√§ger; Mav to Hibana/Thatcher; Kali to Thatcher). So don't expect your idea to be implemented because it defeats the purpose of pick and ban.

^^^^^^^Hi ok
---
Clash is so easy to counter tho üòû
---
Both sides would just ban the exact same operators and the system would be no different than how it is now. You have a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.

"the game used to be much better", how can you say that? Some of the character models have always been excluded from the hitbox and the hitreg is much better today than it was years ago

Bucks are my favourite prey.
---
#LEEMESMELLLYRTOES

I will skeleton key you from across the map if u touch 1 more buck again

Listen man you got really drunk and hacked into your account and got all the skins. Also your U-Play is now J03M4M4.
---
Good luck with that.
---
Watch I‚Äôm the new sniper

r/twohealthbars wants you!

Frost because I love causing massive amounts of damage to peoples legs
---
Probably Sledge or Thermite cause I like breaching shit

I just use 16:9 because I like the way it looks, 4:3 just looks bad so I don't use it.
---
I lost
---
br? Translate corno to english
---
Yup
---
Well Buck is a marksman. Lot of good that does you in CQC

I wonder what would happen if you input a rocket to laser engrave and stick you dick there

Yep
---
the fuck

You take my ACOG, I take your killcam. *insert angri Ash*

I haven't heard about this either

If dokkaebi was a lesbian

She‚Äôs nicer then you think. Just gotta break that hardened exterior.

Not sus what are you talking about silly

My Thatcher died so i had to figure something out. I was so pumped when it worked. Thanks! EG forever

Yea I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with e sports but their my favorite team how are they doing
---
Totally not sus, my chair wasn't good enough
---
Never had issues with it. Hell i even use it with angled grip.
---
You should if  had a Breyer chair
---
Why...
---
Great artwork.
---
I was looking through your history to find year 1 but I turned up empty. Any chance you did one and I just missed it or if you haven't done it, any chance you will?
---
Probably using the High Resolution pack on a 1440p monitor
---
Personally, I don't see it
---
What a loser playing on ps4
---
Best i got it is a chair from walmart
---
Turning your back on Clash is actually a very efficient tactic if you're quick enough.
---
LNOC.
---
So you can fuck them

I think not good sir

Oh well I‚Äôll just have to wait
---
^^^^^^test
---
A line

It‚Äôs mainly personal preference. :)

^so this is how you do it?

Dude I thought it was a circle

Wow I need a hug like that

I'm talking shit don't worry about it so much

that gun already has no recoil and you want it to have even less, boy my maestro spawnpeeks will reach godhood levels

tysm haha. I‚Äôm so obsessed with playing rn I love it

Nice. I remember my first kill. I was a recruit on this map. My teammates blew up the hatch in the bathroom and an enemy was standing right there. Good times.
---
Too much
---
sounds dope. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll remember this too lol
---
#**CCESHIELDACOG**
---
1. Bomb is the most competitively balanced gamemode
---
2. Rainbow Six Siege is a team based game. Don‚Äôt have one? Sucks to suck.
---
3. Ranked backfill would be disgusting 
---
4. The game can‚Äôt distinguish between connection issues and leaving. It‚Äôs the only fair alternative 
---
5. Once again, team game. If your team were to communicate you could make actual bans instead of comfort bans.
---
Make sure to put those reinforcements down !
---
sir yes sir mr. coochiecrusher
---
Welcome!
---
:))) ty!
---
Another is that she may be Danish Royalty, bastard of some noble or high ranking politician.
---
Why zofia is tier S ? Lol
---
If they implement a join ranked in progress I'd be all for it on one condition. If I get filled into a game in progress and I lose. It's a severe mmr loss reduction or no mmr loss at all.
---
üòÇ

No, bad. Wait no I‚Äôm just weird fuck...

he probably buys every single iphone too as soon as it comes out lol

Sorry but operators only, although he'd be a pretty good hugger

Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it! Just remember the #1 rule to being a good teammate in clutch situations: if you die, make your call out first, then yell about how bullshit the death was, not the other way around!
---
By the sounds of it yes but this was not at at school. Personal luxury purchase.
---
Take buck out of A-tier one look at those eyes and you know he can only hug corpses üò∞

i got a gaming laptop for vr never really played a game like this on pc.. its on sale right now for ps4 &amp; pc.. do u prefer one over the other?
---
Loool, worth it!
---
Where do I get these?
---
It honestly looked like a glitched dead body lol
---
Well I guess it was a Ace. 5 kills and all.
---
Kaid is a giant, he would give huge hug!
---
And y‚Äôall still lost.  Wow.
---
that edition will give you year 1 ops for free. The year 1 , year 2 or year 3 these "year" system is just season pass. Each season pass or year has 4 has 4 seasons. 1 season every 3 months. Each season they release 2 new playable operators. If you bought the year pass or season pass you get the new operators for free and 1 week early. After 1 week everyone can buy the operators using ingame earned currency. So the deluxe edition will give you year 1 or season pass 1 ops for free and unlocked. But you will still need to unlock all other operators.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Base game also has operator but these are super cheap and super quick to unlock. But you will still need to unlock them. Base game ops - 1000 ingame currency. New Season DLC Ops - 25000 ingame currency. Older season DLC - 12500 ingame currency
---
I couldn't disagree more. You are speaking from an unenlightened opinion so you are none the wiser.
---
You've got a good point there
---
Typical ash main has no idea she has a breacher...
---
Nah man Buck is super geniune and would probably give a long, heartfelt hug
---
Try going to uplay, change proxy settings, and at the top you should see 'set up' button. Then click apply after closing the set up window. The connection error happened to me alot of time, but my friend told me this and it worked (its a temporary fix, i still get the same error from time to time).
---
Tell me if it works.
---
To the corpse
---
I miss old Hereford
---
As long as your not getting shocked it will work btw if u are getting shocked ur charge will be destroyed
---
gotcha thanks for that im gonna just get the deluxe edition n i will get whatever i need as i go if i do.. i normally just play for fun i dont buy in game stuff alot
---
Head is maybe a little bit flat and wide but otherwise well done, i like how many "details" you have in there

Ngl I wouldn't mind being hugged by a cab for... Reasons

I don‚Äôt know, I bet ela can hug pretty well
---
What's wrong with hugging corpses?
---
She can be a 50/50, if she's in the mood she would give a great cuddle but if she's not she would probably refuse
---
How fuckin excited i am to use bosg acog

He got burnt hands broski

Last time frost hugged me my femur snapped in half

imagine shooting drones with teammates close to you

Sorta.
---
I'd still pick lion, because if I can get even one retard to work with me defense stands no chance.
---
But he wrapped em
---
Dane Cook reference. For the fan he has besides me.
---
When two of your attacker mains are on the same tier as recruit
---
Her hugs would mean something. S tier for sure
---
You ok there hoss?
---
It‚Äôs not really a funny memory but this one time I was playing a ranked game while solo queuing and it was going really good up until the game was about to start and my whole team for some reason decide to leave the game so I was left playing all alone. I tried my best but unfortunately I lost every single round and once the last round started I was about to go in guns blazing and all of a sudden I get a message from one of the guys saying ‚Äúyou tried you best even tho you knew you had no chance of winning and for that we respect you- from the enemy team‚Äù and then they all abandoned the game letting me win :‚Äô). They all added me and there are times when we all hop on and play together.
---
Nah, it's been posted with tons of upvotes on here before. That said, I do wish they'd fix it, even though you can just shoot through the destructable floor generally, to deny it. It's always looked fairly obviously not-intended.

Still not recommended.

I want ela to hug my face. With her butt
---
I second this movement
---
Bro I want Gridlock to sit on my face too
---
I agree with your name.
---
In different ways depending on weather or not I am in on of her bear traps.
---
Shit, level 3 urmm.. I'm gonna go with dwarfism. Did I win?
---
Mira should be S tier. Smh my head
---
Like In battlefield right?
---
Last time i tried this pulse had a phone call for me
---
Idk, the killcam showed the grenade sit on an invisible barrier, like it never went down at all.
---
I‚Äôve had this happened to me once on the loading screen and little by little everyone started leaving and that‚Äôs how some of my team won without having to do anything
---
Nah docs worse
---
Tachanka has a daughter as well right?
---
I don‚Äôt know. I think it‚Äôs a pretty cool tech and you can shoot the charge through the floor anyway so it‚Äôs not that big of an issue. Even the one on Oregon people have found ways to stop it
---
Doesn't Smoke has an adoptive daughter? I think he should be higher, seems like he'd be a good fella anyways.
---
Legitimately a drive by lol
---
Also, her smile makes her nice and should be higher
---
And yeah, she is super fucking hot
---
Ummm. Haven't aged In a while... Did they really do my girl like that?
---
Real talk ^let ^me ^just ^hug ^Dokkaebi
---
RECRUIT IS THE CUDDLIEST
---
My immersion is destroyed
---
Fun fact: there are no 2 speed recruits, only 3 and 1.
---
I wanna get hugged by dokkabei
---
Why Lion, Finka and Momma Mira are so low tiered?
---
Imagine montagne just this big, no this huge man and he just goes: 'Aaah come here dude'
---
iirc yes but they didn't
---
While I already enjoy her current look, a really good Dokk elite skin would be really nice. But for me atleast, the last few elites weren't really good, so I hope that won't continue
---
imagine full auto-ing a drone .. at head level.. kinda dumb op
---
This is the kind of content we‚Äôve been waiting for
---
I think Clash would be a S tier hugger
---
full auto too
---
Gridlock doesn't hug, she crushes
---
Thicc rook is S tier
---
Tanchanka definitely belongs on the top because according to his bio, specifically his new psychological report, he is one wholesome dude like he‚Äôs actually nice as fuck
---
Facts
---
I'm very glad you specified it's not a fortnite llama. Otherwise, we would've had a problem.
---
I'm pretty sure Mira and kaid give S-tier hugs
---
I did miss that but Mon is a big friendly giant
---
Any tier list involving tachanka that doesn't have hin at the top is a bad tier list
---
I work on a semi-daily basis with these things, so I know a little about this.
---
First and most important: your hand is out of focus. These machines have typically a few millimetres of focus where they actually work at all. 
---
Second: you as a human usually don't hold still enough.
---
Third: Skin is greasy, sweaty and very irregular. Especially the first part makes most surfaces pretty un-laserable
---
no, but it's range based now iirc
---
C75 ACOG?
---
Vigil can‚Äôt hug cause he can‚Äôt practice on his family
---
I ain't got no beef except with fortnite
---
Lion could give the best hugs, so can cav if you let her slit your throat
---
I just read finkas lore and apperantly they flirt and drink together, so wholesome!
---
Not even close.
---
It‚Äôs nothing like COD. Tactical 5v5 search and destroy experience. Amazing game. Better on PC if you‚Äôre good at mouse and keyboard already
---

Sometimes I just wanna watch the silly gameplay with friends, but he ruins it with his loud ass commentary. ):

BOOMER - his gadget. A cane that when deployed screams propaganda about millennials and how they are ruining the country. Automatically reduces points to enemy team.  You gain points equal to the loss.
---
I want to get into a group hug with the tier A's
---
11 more punches now
---
Isn‚Äôt that mute though?
---
Aww yiss
---
I love this game bcs u can 1 shot someone or empty a magazine on their head but they still have 99hp
---
I want to cuddle Tachanka too
---
Polish mom gang
---
I just want him to take off the armor and headphones i would pay good money for that
---
Thats my gal
---
Valkyrie and IQ
---
How the hell is Caviera a D rating? She is by far the most skilled at getting intimate with other operators.
---
YOU DIED
---
There was a X-Kairo acog post, not her actual Acog
---
I recommend you properly read all the bios (if you have time) so you don‚Äôt add some wrongs in the list
---
*With?*
---
His siege videos are literally just his friends doing the jokes and him repeating them
---
Echo is S tier for sure!
---
that is very scary and you should probably get some help
---
Getting hugged my mozzie probably classes as a surreal experience, whit him being all the way down there
---
Think Cav would be S tier just because of the additional creep factor of her being a very caring and cuddly person on the surface.
---
Nah gridlock is just fat with a shit to of muscle, but mainly fat
---
To kill him?
---
I've never seen a suicider for so many months on any t-hunts and i do disarm bomb too so there should be suiciders but nope. Nitro cells i would like a toggle too xD
---
Open the floor first with buck or sledge to clear those defenders
---
Not really, what else could you expect from cav
---
Gridlock is a fat bitch
---
I would still fuck cav though...
---
Lol I know
---
Oh wow, even when the hostages get picked up. Now i'm curious what they say.
---
OP knows literally nothing about the operators
---
Lol
---
Also you know how hard it is to run with such a heavy shield? 
---
M E A T Y  A R M S
---
Cav is a great hugger, haven‚Äôt you noticed?
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs honestly sad
---
Thai lightens up my heart. Thank you.
---
No, it is perfectly balanced like all things should be
---
Superior to every other ace...
---
X Kairos gun acog
---
Hug so good, you will never want to have another one afterwards
---
Anyone else notice the several Russian operators at the bottom
---
Dokkae B tier
---
Jackal to the caption: I see you lurking...

That was not the purpose of the title. I just didnt know what to take as a title mb

Special operations =/= war
---
They‚Äôre both combat situations, but the geneva conventions specifically applies to war. That‚Äôs why, for instance, even though pepper spray is prohibited from use against combatants in the geneva conventions, cops can still spray it in university students‚Äô faces.
---
Sadly. Maybe.
---
How does boot leather taste?
---
Why the hell would a invisible barrier be down there?
---
Whos gonna crawl down there, Mozzie?
---
they said it was designed for tanks
---
Wow you insult people and you havent even read the sub rules. grow up
---
Imo, frost‚Äôs bear traps hug my leg pretty well. Frost‚Äôs gadget should clearly be on a S+
---
I think it would be nice to have specific 1x sights on specific weapons for example to increase/decrease popularity
---
Why is Ella c tier
---
why am i not allowed to play as a turtle
---
That's what every team killer, loser player or 12yo git says.  The be all and end all excuse "it's just casual".
---
The game is a competition by nature saying it is just casual is something maybe high ranked players have a right to say but plebs do not.
---
And i'm not Maestro, lol :D
---
Fair enough
---
and nokk and vigil should‚Äôve been at S. Cmon it‚Äôs father and daughter
---
People trust their kids with me
---
I'm currently adding to the drawing and changing minor things
---
I feel like cav should be in E tier due to the fact she seems like she would be more interested in stabbing you in the throat over hugging matter of fact I think she would stab you if you attempted to hug her.
---
Man, wish i could find the ash chibi anywhere on the interent for fairly cheap, for my little collection. I myself have IQ and monty
---
Nononononono and no
---
the smg 12 is okay, the bearing is horrible
---
I actually LOLd at this
---
a hug from dokk, mozzie, or jackal would make week tbh
---
Havard: Bro do you want a scholarship?
---
Cavi is a pretty good hugger...  you just don‚Äôt want her to hug you.
---
That's pretty hot
---
Honestly i dont remeber. It was like a week or two ago.
---
Where can I do this?
---
Hahaha i would love to but college is a trap so i respectfully decline.
---
I do not know. It happened to me to. (A lot). Sad
---
Ela and glaz should be higher
---
Go choke on some plastic while the rest of us play the game normally
---
‚Äúsuiciders‚Äù have been removed from t-hunt

Aww man. I remember being shot from exactly the angle you took at the end, so I‚Äôll choose to believe it was you, you sly coon

Yeager is pretty low on the list considering his bio states that's he's pretty eager to be with friends and others

Start clipping your teamkill deaths and send them to ubi with a full description of the people who did it and what happened. I have yet to run into the same people I've sent in videos of again afterwards.

PeriPericote, you can find her Twitter handle easily
---
No running by the pool!
---
"Daddy, what's in the canister?"
---
I feel like Monte should be S. His description basically says he is a Gentle Giant who cares about his friends.
---
Ehhh I feel like it would make the game kind of awkward. Like if every room on villa had a door you have to open it would take 90 years to clear from one side of the floor to the other. And even if you made it so that the doors are open by default and players have to go close them it‚Äôs basically just like having barricades. 
---
If you can shoot through the doors it makes for this weird interaction where you can just wait til someone‚Äôs opening it and start shooting at it while they‚Äôre stuck in the animation defenseless. That‚Äôs why you normally don‚Äôt see players breaking down barricades with melee attacks rather than bullets. And again, if you make them destroyable with bullets they‚Äôre just barricades but awkward
---
wow so funny get it because theres a second wall haha thats hilarious
---
Right, but this is a video game, not a real life simulator. The function of a exo is to destroy reinforced walls within its radius after a delay, and that's whats happening here. Its not a bug.
---
Turning your back on anyone also gives you a tactical advantage of you're heartless enough
---
*looks at best gun in game*

lEtS bUfF iT wItH a BiPoD
---
ty! :)
---
Where can I buy that?
---
The key is tweaking like max 3 nades, nades doing less damage or something
---
What needed to happen now jakal has a higher skill ceiling and doesn't punish anchors as much for reinforcing hatches which is against his design philosophy
---
So you're saying (talking about other games) blowing peoples heads clean off and watching their intestines slowly seep out of their anus is no more graphic than fortnite?
---
Better activate sweat mode I guess
---
I'll bet that's getting patched out now that we all know it works
---
Dude, I know that starting to play siege coming from other games can feel overwhelming and you think you get "owned by a lot of cheaters", but the way this game works isnt like that. Most of those "fishy kills" aren't really cheaters at all.
---
This game rewards prefiring, to the point where you do it when you feel somebody's going to be somewhere (even without any evidence to back it up) just in case they really are.
---
People will fake wallhacks just to make other people mad. It isnt hard, it's just a prefire in which you pretend to track somebody through a wall beforehand. 
---
Queuing up in casual and making flashy plays on purpose draws a lot of hackusations, since most players there are in the mid-low range of ranks. The majority or them are false.
---
Especially in console, don't accuse people, because cheating in console is actually extremely rare compared to PC (I'm not considering MnK and DDOS as cheating in this specific situation, because it's regarding wallhacks). Never accuse somebody of cheating without absolute certainty, backed up by actual evidence (something that wouldn't be possible without external help). Just to make sure, you getting shot through a wall/floor or getting nonsense prefired and all that aren't evidence. Actual evidence looks like: invisible player in prep phase planting the defuser; headless player teleporting to your spawn and getting a 5k in 5 seconds; player running at 4x the normal speed; invisible player killing people with sledge's hammer in prep phase; player consistently hip firing across the map; player hip firing a pistol getting a 5k across the floor; player teleporting to the sky; player destroying an entire wall with ~10 pistol shots... You get my point (before you say that all these are exaggerated, all of those happened to me multiple times and they are the only ones I accused of cheating)
---
Think 10 times before accusing somebody of cheating, because this game offers so many ways of gathering intel (and even if you don't have intel, you can use our intuition), allowing you to get fishy kills
---
So many people don't know they break if you melee them 10 times
---
I got shot through a chair. It was a headshot
---
Use impacts to counter that.
---
Zofia
---
You don‚Äôt even need to be that close to the hatch

Looks like he was getting ready to throw some bowling Ball
---
I wouldn't say its a bug, but more of an exploit that circumvents game mechanics

Bruh its sarcasm
---
Girders are thicker than magical metal wall reinforcements.
---
Witch hunting is not allowed on the sub, refrain from posting the guy's name next time.
---
Also, as many have said, it can be suspicious but one kill is not enough empirical evidence.
---
When it comes to 1xsight it's all about preference. Everyone will not use one sight only.
---
sure
---
xD
---
I was kidding too :/
---
How was this minimalistic?
---
Why Castle is useful.
---
As a Kaid main I'd like you to remove this please. Thanks
---
2 breaches left, bruh...
---
I watched the clip the round ended before sledge dropped or died.
---
You can say that about any other operator that throws projectiles.
---
So if someone is yelling, and i qoute "i hope your mother gets cancer". You say that i am the dick for tk'ing him? I just find it funny to tk those people.
---
I don't chastise you for tk'ing the teammate. I'm saying that you were not forced to tk him like you said.
---
Coward
---
aight im emstill earning renown luckily i have a boostet
---
Are you on ps4 i could help you tomorrow
---
hello I'm r/rainbow6 and here are my stupidly OP operator ideas
---
It's not the explosion that's supposed to open the hard walls, it's the charge itself burning a hole first. I agree this should be classified as a bug and needs to be fixed.
---
Always do that with Castle, works most of the time until Ash mains realize they have gadgets.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a wallhack. It‚Äôs a glitch in the kill cam. It happens fairly often where a removed or damaged barricade appears to still be in tact when it‚Äôs really not.
---
I mean fair points, but it's really not broken.
---
You assume that siege was immersive in the first place.
---
press F to withstand
---
sadly not im on pc really close thoufh im at 17k
---
Same with the suppressor, realistically it should not have less damage as the item irl increases the bullet speed but I don‚Äôt want to make it imbalanced so I think it should add more range, damage, easier vertical recoil but worse horizontal recoil(fuck spraying), and worse ads time.
---
This sir we need more of this
---
Hey here‚Äôs an Operator that has a fucking ladder for a gadget. WOW!!
---
Ok
---
Yeah but the coyote sight has the biggest field of view/least obstructive.
---
Nah, the American 180 was a panning magazine machine gun.
---
Again, I know it isn't an American 180 either! Why is this even a discussion?!
---
The problem large punishments for leaving players is if a player has to leave for an emergency or their wifi disconnects or they have a powercut in the last round. I remember i had an issue whenever i played on coastline the game would crash and i couldn't rejoin so i would get an abandon sanction and lose elo for an issue in the game.
---
Please let my man Meatball Mario inside
---
Cringe
---
I bet it's staged
---
In any game, I will never understand the point of weird sights on 1x. 
---
I mean, the dot is by far the cleanest one and better for visibility, why would you make it a cross or something like that? I understand the colour, but changing the shape has no benefits whatsoever
---
One time I was on cams as Maestro on bank, got off cams and a thermite was crouched infront of me but hadn't seen me. So I got my first and only maestro pistol kill üòÇ
---
Guys were jailbreaking 360s in the mw2 days I know because I was on those lobbies that was long before they stopped supporting it
---
Lesion gets baned in some maps
---
Bullets are are the same if you aim for the head
---
Stop worrying about winning. 
---
Simply don't care
---
It'll go away instantly
---
I didnt get him this his dad did. He knew what he was doing
---
No, you can still do that crouching thing with reinforced wall, only way to prevent is by blowing up the wall
---
It do be like that
---
Here is a operator but #/*S I L E N T*
---
You missed all but one shot. And the guns hitbox wouldnt be the issue, it would be the player's.
---
A E S T H E T I C S
---
Nokk is better then vigil change my mind
---
Tbh when i visit him hes such a good kid. He likes to play with me and his little brother. Only he likes poping bloons idk ehy heh
---
The TTS. You need to install Uplay client, then sign in to your account. The TTS should show as available for download.
---
TTS is only available for about a month before the next season. After that you cannot connect until Ubi enables the TTS servers.
---
You could also purchase the game on PC. It is on sale on Steam for cheap.
---
Maverick: lets out a scream loud enough to be heard across the map
---
Hardbreachers when they have no thatcher or maverinck but the enemy have a bandit, mute or kahid
---
They dont need a different playlist for everyone all i said was id like unranked to not have pick and ban, yikers dude i get you take this game seriously but errrr its not that deep man enjoy your day
---
I love nothing more than jamming that hatch with Mute, putting a small hole in the floor on the north side and waiting for that EZ C4 kill.
---
God i want gridlock to hug me with her thighs
---
its not that shes op or something, its that she is frustrating to play against

Unranked was designed to be the same rules as ranked so to get rid of pick and ban and have the rest of the same rules would mean a new playlist is needed.

---
Either give him his LMG as an ability with passive debuffs such as movement speed penalty and less leaning/no crouching, but no tripod. Or make his current shield invulnerable, but prevent him from pickin his turret back up once he placed it down
---
That's me on console everytime
---
Have you tried it without the damn drone in the way?
---
I see aerobic tiger is your group's poor man. Always nice to see a full elite squad though
---
Honestly she's an interesting op however I do agree with the fact that the sheer noise and way it performs can be a death sentence especially against roamers.
---
I'd like to see at least a 25% increase in the speed and decrease in noise of her grapple as it would put her in a better place especially when breaching 3rd floor windows the enemy has a significant advantage against her. 
---
  The window breaks are already loud enough and  her grapple is a dinner bell to a patiently waiting Caveira.
---
Weapon wise she's in a good place in my opinion but her gadget is detrimental to her survival.
---
Agreed
---
Cav elite sucks
---
of course, you can allways prevent enemies spoting you, without taking mozzie and echo into consideration
---
C o p p e r I I
---
So?
---
Even casual will suck after the next update, renamed it "quick match" and its 2 rounds of attack then rounds of defensive or the other way around. They trying to make this game too competitive, miss the days of genuinely having fun, game feels like such a grind now
---
*I think that adding Wamai is goingto ruin J√§ger's pickrate. I think the solution to this would be to increase ADS' range and make it able to destroy projectiles through walls. Also, it would now intercept bullets but it would not use ammo and it would only be do that on a saturday night in months with letter r in them. What do you think guys I think that it would make for a fair and balanced operator. *
---
The fact that a color analysis would show literally hundreds of shades in just the square box alone, I don't think this qualifies as minimalist in any way.
---
Where was this video taken
---
Oh yeah would have definitely thought hacking lmfaoooo
---
Tbh I'd wouldn't mind if they just change it so the little circle countdown is shorter and as long as you start the defuse before it's up. you get the dub.
---
I see, thanks
---
Okay cool, I kinda figured, but I wasn't sure as I hadn't ever tried it.
---
Very cool
---
Wow. Just wow. Pretty much everything you said is just wrong. No offense but these are all things new/low rank players complain about. Especially spawn peeking.
---
Nah that nerf was only for the sausage and fo12.
---
Twitch ruined it with selecting random
---
just throw the breaching charge problem solved, no problem mate
---
No
---
Get map knowledge and perfect the art of flanking/hatch braking.
---
Vigil has better guns
---
This should have been the most gamer play
---
Unsure what you mean with ‚Äúpositioning‚Äù. If you mean when she walks I always walk around crouched, unless I need to quickly push I use silent step and run

yeah it looks bigger than real one but i did some proportions on in-game model and applied it on my height (1.81). that' why lookw so big XD

Where Are They! OwO
---
Well that's pretty much the whole point of reddit but okay buddy. Let's just stop arguing so you don't make yourself look any stupider
---
Yea I know that but usually it would only be in the kill cam it's clearly closed in the background of the previous shot so more then likely not the case in this scenario
---
&gt; You dont have the characters in the first row because Ubisoft changed that in Feb 2019. You have to unlock all the first season/first row characters now.
---
Question I have the base edition and all of the season 1 ops unlocked so if i buy the ultimate now will they just suddenly lock up now?
---
The bosg is a slug shotgun, so it doesn't shoot multiple pellets. The bosg acts more like a dmr, so why even compare it to a shotgun
---
Has nobody noticed that on the phone it shows him with a gun against his head

Is this supposed to be iq chase I see her wrist mounted iPhone on the phone

The valk looks like they have no clue what they're doing

Yeah, why not add Coyote from BF4 ? Almost no vision obstruction, one small dot. That wouldn't destroy other 1x sights. That wouldn't destroy Acogs. Not at all. #ACOGFORBOSG was funny, and it wasn't so metabreaking (besides the fact that Vigil is now only 3speed with and Acog) so people accepted it. But this thinf would change everything. This would change Casual, Ranked and Pro League metas and strats adn that's why it is very bad idea. If this thing will ever be added to the game, I hope that other sights will be significantly buffed or this sight will be way worse than it is in BF4.
---
Imagine roasting someone for taking a poorly made Op and making them the best
---
True true, but one podcast doesn‚Äôt suit all. I liked the casualness of the HB Podcast!

Just snort some coke and ya will be fine

You know what honestly I didn‚Äôt realize that please hurt me I deserve it

and a Jager main as well
---
Wtf you lose an argument so now your last resort is a pathetically racist comment? You have no legitimate reason anymore, you are incompetent as fuck.
---
Imagine bringing a world war 1 soldier back to life and showing him this video.
---
Thanks nooooo!
---
Well I dont think that would be I good idea, but in the game you should be better lol
---
I'm only bustin' your balls, I completely agree with you. That's why I don't play ranked
---
You got that from the Russian badger
---
Check his profile.
---
Criiiiiinge
---
He was crouched, not moving with a laser sight
---
This doesn't make sense no one is forcing you to go that specific route also there is nothing stopping you or a teammate from flanking said valk. Another option is n√∏kk. It's an info based game
---
Thank you
---
Because he has a laser.
---
Addendum
---
I feel the should be allowed within a certain distance outside
---
If they get too far away from the interior of the building they lose signal
---
Even if im standing still and crouched its still not as small
---
Ah I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Yes they would! What's the difference between a squad member leaving and a random? Nothing. I don't know how old you are but if you can't understand that what you're saying wouldn't work, then I'm going to assume you're pretty young. Humans are pieces of shit and will always find a way to exploit systems like the one you're pitching. A zero tolerance is the only way
---
Laser sight

Did you read the post at all? I'm saying there are spots where you can throw the cam where you simply cannot spot with hour eyes but the cam can see you clear as day. That's the issue I have with it.
---
Warden: P90 with recoil buff, 3 armor, ACOG; Nokk: acog or mp7, 3 speed

He just wanted to wave at you

I would buy kaid I dont know when theres a sale but I heard they are buffing him

Go4r6 tournaments have been happening every Sunday on ESL for all platforms since the game released. You get a charm and points for winning, 5 teams chosen at random every week get a prize that has a participation charm and stuff.
---
Really cool! But not minimalistic tho.
---
What headset?
---
Easier to setup recording software. When I first started using OBS, I couldn't get it to detect fullscreen games, so I made clips in windowed mode.
---
But he was mute
---
What sound mode do you have it on? Like it‚Äôll say something like surround sound or something
---
Maybe use an old school leather football helmet?
---
Oh shit he was ima. Edit this
---
I hate ranked.
---
I don't think everyone that it happens to is lagswitching, though, because it happens a lot.  Sometime when the servers are having issues, everyone in the server's ping will be listed as 9.
---
I've never flanked better with anyone other than Warden, God I love Warden...
---
You DONT CHOOSE in casual
---
So where is the joke?
---
N√∏kk
---
Agreed, sledge should have been able to kill me, Maverick had a little time to shoot me, and then Ash was looking in the wrong direction
---
For what, unlocking next?
---
I‚Äôm going to unlock wamai next when he is on live servers
---
I ended up having to reset my entire pc to find this out, after slowly reinstalling programs I figured out that it was EPIC GAMES Launcher and ORIGIN causing it, Not sure why but the moment I uninstalled both of these it worked perfectly
---
Not a bug, but it was unintended.  
---
At this point in the game you could argue it is by design because it has been left in for so long.
---
How does one possess such a power?
---
i know, im just pointing something out
---
Nice clip though
---
I got it for $6 at a store called Game XChange
---
Didn't the guy above us already point it out
---
Uhhhhm what?  One more of those and you're going to timeout mister
---
Thanks who ever did that
---
That was missclick, i tried to pick up a C4, but i press "G" instead a "F" xD
---
Beautiful
---
What plugin did you use? Looks like Saber.
---
I'm convinced that auto-correct has only gotten worse over time
---
Sure but the enemy meleeing panels slows you to either 1. Just outright kill or greatly damage them by shooting feet and/or 2. Lets you know the exact door they‚Äôre pushing which allows you to position around that door and get ready for the breach. The strategy you gave as an example assumes someone is already running Jager which isn‚Äôt always true, and even then usually people drone blue stairs or straight up frag grenade it which just makes Warden a free kill or have to fall back, also with Wamai in the future even the strategy you‚Äôre suggesting is terrible as Warden because wamai will do the same thing but stop frag grenades as well and provide anti-projectiles on site as well if you already have a Jager.
---
Sure i‚Äôll watch a mentally disabled person play ranked,
---
that is the weirdest thing I think I have ever seen
---
bruh ubi need to give free 200 mmr as if you are alone in your team or 50 mmr if 2-3 teammates leave
---
Definitely, everytime I save up 20k the alpha packs are very tempting lol
---
Username checks out way too well.

Thanks for the advice! I‚Äôve been doing ok with thermite but I wasn‚Äôt sure whether he was good for beginners. Thanks for clarifying!

You can reinforce and get the hatch and wall with one electroclaw without exposing it to the laundry stairs

Is it possible to put a valk cam on a shield?

Also, no witch hunts.
---
I tend to find spots inside that I prefer to use to hide the cams. Throwing them outside has always felt like wasting a cam to me.
---
Ah
---
If anyone actually sees this could you explain to me please, how does side switching work in unraked/ranked? In newcomer it switches every round, but here I played 4x attack then 1 round defense and then attack again. It really pissed me off because I am much better defender that attacker. Thanks in advance!
---
play unranked then
---
Tbh its not that hard to spawnpeek with a big fucking shield in front of you. And make a 5 minute video from 100 hours of gameplay (cuz you dont know if he did it in 5 games or 100 games). I could call myself the best window player in the world with a 5 minute video that i needed 500 hours to make cuz i cant see shit upside down.
---
Hopefully when they patch this they won't make any new bugs. I'm tired of people running through solid doors when I try to knife/shoot it open
---
Get ready to punch some more!
---
I‚Äôve never understood the hate that Tachanka gets

I like the blue tint and maybe highlight enemies in a light blue, while Glaz does this in Yellow. This stops the while ‚Äòrecycled content‚Äô bollocks, and keeps wardens glasses looking and feeling cool. 
---
And again I agree, competition over outright replacing it with just a better option
---
Same
---
Casual for most of it
---
What, is that a healthy change that doesnt allow easy camping to force out time?!
---
it‚Äôs always been like that
---
Why is Clash giving Chanka head?
---
That or at least buff the skorpion recoil a little
---
Stop giving away our ancient secrets
---
Why not
---
Honestly I could care less about the impacts, I‚Äôd rather they make her Scorpion recoil learnable with a high vertical like Buck‚Äôs C8 then get rid of the horizontal because there is no reason a primary should have rng based recoil.
---
You just called #YOURSELF THE BEST CHONK
---
I don‚Äôt think impacts is a good idea. 
---
I‚Äôd rather see a scorpion rework and a slight gadget nerf
---
Yeah I have like 600+ hours and I feel like I'll have a heart attack when I'm last alive.
---
As of right now there is no like linking system for your accounts to combine or something but right now if you wanna switch you'll have no progress
---
LOL git gud. 
---
You‚Äôre not going to get any pity here. Check drones, Windows to see if they‚Äôre broken or open. It‚Äôs not hard. We‚Äôve all learned and now it‚Äôs time for you to. 
---
If you do get peeked, adapt and spawn in a different place, take a different route, don‚Äôt expose yourself, take smokes.
---
Lol title nice
---
wooah awesome.. thanks for the tip i usually play casual cuz im not to good lol. Great peak spot! Have a good day man!
---
I can‚Äôt with these one taps...I‚Äôll be walking into a Kapkan trap now thankyouverymuch.
---
Noobs

Ela's shotgun shouldn't be getting nerfed in the first place. Buffing the scorpion in turn would also not help her. the fo-12 is a balanced gun and penalizing players for taking advantage of its one good trait makes it pretty shit. You go from balanced to shit. Buffing the scorpion from the worst gun in game makes it mediocre if you only focus on recoil. You go from balanced and the worst gun to shit and mediocre. That doesn't help her and still makes her worse off. Only giving back impacts or maybe a c4 doesn't help her either as she's still left with some of the worst gun choices in siege.
---
Damn, let‚Äôs start booing all the pro league players too because they also use it! /s

drones are for suiciding into the objective room once the location has been found and all defenders are known DUH everyone knows this. /s

Ubisoft doesn't want money? They did a horrible event to get money and promote a netflix show for no reason. They have a season pass. Seasonal alpha packs, twitch awards, a battle pass, a new stand alone game that gives siege a "story" When it's just a rehashed version of outbreak and we have to pay for a new game that isn't realistic and nowhere of what tom clancy ever made siege.  If you think Ubi doesn't want money you're crazy. Because they have tried to pick up every little bit of it as possible. My theory as they know Ela's elite won't sell as well as everyone else's. Ela is a popular character but especially on console the largest parts of the siege community Ela is now going to be one of the worst and she already is one of the least played operators.

When I find time to play after work yes. Event though I reached lvl 30 I am not ready to play ranked yet so i stick with the newcomer  mode to learn the game.
---
That‚Äôs called; every single operator Ubisoft put into the game before y4.
---
Well, I'd disagree, but some people are like that, but most of the time the way us plat players play, we just end up killing normies with no effort. It seems like we're tryharding, but we're really just having fun with it.
---
Maybe a little too glow-y but neat
---

Yeah some players are like that. But if you're pixel spawn peeking with doc then calling us shit then you're just a bit of a knob

Use the goddamn internet cable
---
Ooooo that would be nice
---
Does anyone know why this happened? I know they had their differences every once in a while but that seems strange after all their successes they‚Äôve had with the podcast
---
I was kind of expecting a final "Pop" moment at the end that would add a few missing detail and a dramatic effect. But overall this is seriously amazing work.

3:10 that's the spot I use for tachanka

not the point of my post, and if you look at the first frame you can see i shot the spot from which he should be able to see me.
---
I can, it's just that 30gb is a bit much for my SSD. I can install a whole other game or keep the texture pack. I made a tough choice.

Obviously you missed

Dude, this shit looks great man. Nice work.
---
I don‚Äôt get why ubi is fixated on pickrate. Sure it says something about the op in question but win delta or k/d should matter more. For example, Ubi only removed ash‚Äôs acog because of her pickrate.
---
so what happened to hereford base and shipwreck? did they get pulled from casual?
---
Yeah. There's a few not so great maps in casual. Can't stand Yacht, myself
---
What kinda magic you running? I get about half a second of black screen with several white frames before the game vanishes to show desktop

Just counter spawnpeek.

I didn‚Äôt say that. Lol

It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù you left a match and this is your punishment

Ok lets say i use aimlab in order to get to some point where my aim improves how much time a day should i spend playing and within a matter of what time should i see improvement

‚ÄúYou see, when two nations hate each other very much, they make weapons to kill each other painfully.‚Äù

Its just a meme.
---
Ok then following that logic Blackbeard‚Äôs sr-15 should make you run at the speed of fucking sound with its ‚Äúmobility‚Äù of 30 since that ‚Äú20‚Äù makes you run faster
---
By that logic you should be lightspeed when equipping a shield
---
Casual gameplay isn‚Äôt impressive
---
It‚Äôs not impressive
---
Well if that‚Äôs the case ash should have her acog back
---
This is one reason you first shotgun a mirror sized  hole where you're going to place it. Then reinforce. Then palce the mirror. It also helps with the mirrors sometimes having debris around edges instead of looking right.
---
Too lazy to change it
---
Ha
---
Theme park rework
---
It is
---
Mobility: noun
---
the ability to move or be moved freely and easily.
---
So was #bosgacog but that's in the game.
---
Time to get serious...
---
Always be on a move. Use silent step as much as you can. Basicly try to get behind enemy's and maby even interrogate someone. Anyways be **spook 100**

Theme Park in, Skyscraper out.
---
*dating*
---
I‚Äôm aware of what the definition of the word means, however that does not change the fact that mobility is a useless statistic in the game
---
The -1/-1 happens when they leave right before the RFF inquiry

They may have Recruit in ranked for all you know (via no other ops on account)

* Theme Park will return (reworked map)

No truer words have been typed. I just suck at PC gaming. I do pretty decently on console like the disgusting plebeian I am.

I really want this event back I missed it

I've heard that it's dead. I'll give it a go though

This happens to me a lot (except if my drones get destroyed by teammates).

Already reported it to ubi but....it keeps happening very randomly.

There already are specific sights. Nokk and Smoke's fmg9 has a unique holo sight and Nomad's AK74 has a unique reflex. I think Clash also has an unique sight on her gun?

Obviously he read the post because he suggested going somewhere else or playing n√∏kk, both would make an annoying valk cam useless
---
13,000&gt;12,800 so it is correct
---
Because you can't stop a shields' melee attack once it started, the timing looks good for you but on the server he already had it going (as seen in the killcam too)
---
Tasty.

I don't get why people want a rework of Tachanka. What, you want incredible shit like this to mean less? I love when people can make a low tier work.

I see you in every new post on this sub and I have never disagreed with you once. Keep on fighting the idiots mate.
---
So why don‚Äôt you go and do this in casual if it‚Äôs not impressive at all. Can‚Äôt be that hard can it?
---
That complication is probably more kills then I've gotten over all of my playtime
---
N o o o
---
Y e s s
---
Right. But I have 13,429. I understand it is technically the truth, but why wouldn‚Äôt it just say ‚Äúmore than 13k frags‚Äù the second time instead of 12,800
---
You don't have 100 friends being a shitty recruit
---
No, I understand your frustration; you don‚Äôt get much of a warning when you‚Äôre peeking a doorway and a Cav comes bolting past only to get domed by your bullets aimed at your enemies. Honestly at that point I think it‚Äôs just an ethics thing for them to toggle the ‚Äòit wasn‚Äôt an intentional TK‚Äô switch after they‚Äôre killed. People do need to watch where they‚Äôre going though, myself included lol, but I agree.

Alright, let's get technical up in this b**ch. 
---
A few things work according to a client, others work according to a server. Smoke grenades, body ragdolls and debris (barricade breaking) are calculated from the client which is your your own computer doing its thing on its own.
---
Other things, like hit recognition, flash grenades, player position for example are calculated from your computer and sent to a server which is comparing things with all players and adjusting those among them.
---
Sometimes, there is a difference between players so servers are going to adjust these descrepencies and it takes time : that's your ping.
---
Client sided elements are unavoidable because it relieves pressure from the servers. Most of the time, it's barely noticeable.
---
Other times you get shot through a barricade that you can clearly see on your screen. Or through a Mira that clearly was ejected but got stuck. It sucks but there is no way around it.

A common mistake people will make is linking their PSN and such to their social media, and very simple google search of the username will find their Facebook insta etc. If you have ever shared a PSN video on Facebook, it‚Äôs linked to it and super easy to find. I do that shit all the tome to get obnoxious little kids to shut up. So just be careful what you link to what. Especially if you‚Äôre toxic!
