Uh no. It was 100% yes.
---
---
---
It's fine usually. If there is a toxic person (voice abuse) I just hop in a party with a friend. And there isn't really a way to be behind on the game. So if you want to play sometime, I'm down.
---
And a happy new year to you
---
In what way did you need it?
---
If you are looking for mates to squad up with, use the rainbow six discord. There are voice channels for xbox, and its easier to find people there than on reddit.
---
That's just Everytime that they all go recruit
---
I was afraid from your comment. But after seeing it I actually like it
---
Congrats, you're in *roughly* the top 5 ish percent of the playerbase. I hover gold 1-plat 3 and if people are using mnk I havent even noticed an impact
---
Idk, lol. Just found Nøkk with a Santa hat amusing. Sp00ky Christmas time.
---
Why did they even make it a loop if I can’t take me drone through the loop?  It’s very vexing.  I’m vexed.
---
... They do it with their friend but you're simply going on a hunch. Makes sense.
---
I got buck! I never knew they did this. This is awesome
---
On console, if you press the right analog stick at the same time you are aiming, you sometimes knife when you try and Lean. This isn't very effective, especially when behind a fucking Vulcan shield
---
Y not cav and bb are cool and fun
---
Try her out she is fun
---
So you're in roughly the top 5% of the playerbase. I hover around gold1-plat 3 and if people are using mnk it hasnt made a noticeable difference to me
---
Thanks for the advice
---
What Call of Duty has a clean up kill??? Are you thinking of the Kill Confirmed stat that shows how many dog tags are picked up by each person?
---
I don't see anything wrong here.
---
Is it a new Monty set?
---
Cool? Why did you comment that twice?
---
It's casual it has a seperate mmr so rank doesnt affect matchmaking
---
They big gay, also monts n blitzs
---
Shut up
---
matchmaking doesn’t go by anything in casual, use them to get better at the game!
---
The first one didnt pop up as a reply, but as a new comment, so I deleted it and put it as a reply. My bad
---
Is that actually woja tho
---
Stop being a pussy
---
wait can you go through it yet?
---
Ima get kali or gridlock
---
I got the Monty packs but it's not in my inventory , anyone know how can I equipped them?
---
Yea and have a skin that literally buffs him. Yea nah.
---
3....2......1... AND ITS FICKEN GONE
---
&gt; You killed a teammate because they ran in front of you while you were shooting: Vote to kick - Team Kill (x2)
---

---
Tbf while I try to avoid walking in front of people I think are going to  shoot at drones during prep I've walked into people's bullets sometimes and I get pissed off. They're just drones. Proper set up is far more important than you unloading half a mag to get 1 drone, recklessly shooting near all of your teammates.
---
Nice flair.
---
oooh unashamed spawnpeeker and homophobic, makes sense really
---
Ubisoft will counter this by making the drones slower lmao.
---
To get an ace you have to get 5 people.
---
I mean I’m sure Ubisoft could make something work I was just saying it would be nice to see montages skin
---
Upvoted. So ridiculous that people are killing others over this.. Going out of your way for kills means squat. If someone is downed in a trap and you aren't near it; call it out or let a nearby teammate finish it. You are still removing opponents from the round and could possibly take out key ops on the attacking side.

Decent
---
Kali is basically thatcher and glaz having a child, its def. Better than glaz, better than tatcher in fragging but destroying bandit stuff, maybe.
---
I got Clash... So I have to wait to use my gift nice
---
How is that a valid pool? 
---
I’ve seen people saying they got warden or clash or ying or wamai.
---
Why not? Variety man
---
Yes a true doc main only heals himself and spawn peaks salty silvers jkjk don't hate me lol
---
Because it's an awesome legendary
---
Bikini has killed the thing he swore to exist.
---
The f2 is fine where it is. Ash is fine as she is and needs no change. Maybe a slight zofia nerf but not that much damage. Stay the hell away from jager hes fine. Rook and docs main job is to hold long angles and should have an acog to do so

---
Well it also depends whos playing kali, if its a formed diamond 2 Jäger main who cant hit anything but headshots and rages violently when dies than kali is unstoppable but if kali player is just your averarge gold 2 then well you can kill her, just when you peek you have to hope she isnt looking at your general direction
---
Distance could be rounded to nearest integer so you could be like 9.6m away from the wall which could mean the drone would have a lower speed, and therefore not be able to do the loop.
---
Havent got the pack lol
---
Welcome to the club , comrade
---
I also got Mozzie! I'm so hyped.
---
What happens if you own all the operators already?
---
Smg 11 and bearing both have the same problem, when you shoot the recoild hits the fucking moon but with the cz its just still, it does not move, it is a literal laser beam
---
Echo is the better operator but he gets banned a shit ton .
---
Fruityplebel
---
I play ps4 and they are both fine. In comparison, the cz has worse damage and fire rate and in a situation where you are using these weapons, dps and fire rate is king
---
Packs are decided when you open them, not when you receive them. But the real question is could you hold onto this and get a yr5 op?
---
Nook is a great op if you use her correctly. Have fun!
---
Gonna unpack now if its Warden im paying a visit to ubisoft hq with a baseball bat (just kidding ofcourse...)
---
Only time I like amaru is chalet trophy. Apart from that I totally agree
---
Let me correct my mistake. What i meant to "noise" was "glitch".You can see how nokk look like while planting in this video. Whether inside or outside of smoke, sadly you will definitely spotted by your foes. Plant time also equalized to 7 seconds in Casual and Ranked,so it's hard to do even in Casual. I wish i could if she was able to do so, it would be so nice...
---
[https://youtu.be/3wcSMbIEP9I?t=281](https://youtu.be/3wcSMbIEP9I?t=281)
---
I think it's the elite headgear but she wasn't wearing the elite skin, weird.
---
Nope
---
Doc/Rook do still have an ACOG, and jäger is the best defender at the moment and would certainly not have a weapon that strong if he was released today and that’s because it’s too much. Plus you are a jäger main so maybe some bias?
---
Plus the F2 can feel unbeatable at times and the R4C still trumps the G36C in nearly all aspects hence why you still hardly see the G36C
---
I got jackal.  Guess I’ll never get to play mine lol.  Still cool to have him though just in case he doesn’t get banned.
---
Echo is way better but he usually gets band, Mozzie is still solid and his gun is fun af
---
Damn I got Wamai. This is great! I was just about to buy him.
---
I solo queue monty to diamond
---
When I opened mine is didn't even know if was going to get a new operator I was very happy (I got warden)
---
Bosg Acog
---
Dps doesnt mean shit when you can one shot head shot everyone with every weapon, when that is possible the only thing that matters is recoil and fire rate. Cz excels at both
---
I wish I got the Monty skin instead I got clash who was the only op I didn't have because I didn't want to waste me renown on her cause she's constantly banned and overall a bad op
---
He is best hostage counter. xD
---
This really could happen against every operator. Maybe i am saying this because for me she seems just like what i was looking for in game. But i didn't even play against higher ranks than plat, so it could be really different in plat or higher. But i would say there isn't that high pick rate for Kali.
---
Well i doubt you get smurfed to death
---
De gav ut ett likadant pack förra julen, så du kunde va förberedd och du får ett skin för Monty om du har alla ops.
---
Var lite glad, för fan. De är inte skyldiga dig ett skit på jul :)
---
The p90 is a joke of a weapon. I'm not a jager main anymore but I do agree that his weapon is strong. But a 6 damage decrease is ridiculous. The r4c will obviously trump the g36 bc of fire rate. Ash is an entry fragger and should have sufficient kit to do so
---
Gotta pay an extra $15 to unlock the coins you bought.
---
Actually thats a smart idea.
---
&gt;All the other operators are even more easy to kill
---
That's why montagne should not be buffed, he's already an annoying operator who was even stronger before the ADS nerfs, now he requires skill to use
---
People who complain about spawnpeekers are just bad at the game , it's not difficult to take your time and check for spawnpeekers
---
It's not out of place. Kali owns the Nighthaven Mercenary company thing.
---
as a console player, you are very wrong. people mess around like this all the time.
---
I feel bad for people who got clash. They should at least receive 10k-15k renown for that
---
NICE
---
No one bans Ela on PC and they barely do it not console. And shotguns aren’t that much better than on PC, most people would still got for an smg over a shotty. The only people who use shotguns are the anchors and if you anchor as ela u probably shouldn’t be playing her.
---
I do the opposite, where I go to knife one person and fuck it up
---
That only works against plastic VII enemies.
---
Replace Finka with Nomad and Blitz with Gridlock.
---
Thanks for the pack Ubi! I was saving up for Mozzie but only had like 13,800 reknown. After hearing about the packs being released today I got on and then open it immediately! Love the work you guys do and hope you all have a merry Christmas!
---
Are memes allowed on this sub? Because I’m pretty sure they’re not
---
This is super adorable,thx for posting this
---
&gt; Claymores are just luck based
---
Clearly you've not mastered the art of shooting at defenders, pretending to run away and when they chase after you they run round the corner into your claymore :)
---
I got Lesion, I was thinking about unlocking him earlier but I’m saving up for Mozzie. I’ll give him a try and see how things go.
---
So what else? If u don't want to play just don't , it's kinda simple . Like i started playing at grim sky on pc and i was copper 4 solo q bcuz i had no skills to get good rank , but I didn't stop improveming and now i almost plat with alot of experience so if u just don't want to play better than u shouldn't ever touch any competitive game like siege , cs and others.
---
I love it
---
She was able to shoot while still appearing to have her shield up
---
I just got teamkilled for an entire ranked match. All 4 rounds. Didn't get to play once.
---
No, there is no charm to it. It's a waste of my time and energy. Most toxic people I've ever seen.
---
Not the hero we deserved, but the one we needed
---
New Hibana nerf makes her a midget.
---
I just play casual, nor a lot of toxic ppl there
---
She is a very strong operator.
---
I honestly think that she is in a better place now after she lost her frag grenades. After all,she has 3 good primaries,one being one of the best assault rifles in the game. Then she also has such a strong gadget with like no counters whatsoever and her gadget allows her to counter every defender.
---
Let's brawl
---
Epic celebrate multiple Faith's. That is why this year was dedicated to Jediism
---
I’m just speaking from personal experience in champion and diamond on PS4 the teams who bans defenders first is ela majority of the time
---
Bruh
---
I get where ur coming from but if they can do it and you cant, its best for them to do it (unless it gives away info or smh)
---
Me today
---
thanks
---
I'll try and get her
---
It’s free tho?
---
Believe it or not, Ubisoft's balancing team doesn't just look at numbers for operators and cast judgement based on that, they actually take into account the players' experience **and** numbers to help balance ops.
---
nonono
---
I only had two operators left, I left the game to buy them both as I had enough and got the pack, saved me 13k at least
---
Oh here we go then...
---
*cracks knuckles menacingly, before hitting ablstin heartily across the jaw, dealing 17 damage*
---
To add to this, she has the ability to basically block an entire window just by standing in it and starring at you and screaming cockney profanities.
---
Do you have a booster?
---
Those are weird placements
---
Yet the nerf was unnecessary and uncalled for.
---
The gun was like the bosg. Just purely for meme purposes. No one used the ACS12 competetive wise,just to open up walls as jokes and that's it.
---
Which itself is out of fucking place, christ the lore for this game went to shit
---
I have a booster my ID (AliiD)j
---
To be fair, a four stack can't do that anymore. Maybe a pro tip here, since you've been fairly dramatic and that seems in pretty bad faith - if everywhere you go everyone is an asshole, maybe you're the asshole.
---
B
---
You get it from the Christmas packs if you have all the ops
---
Thank you and a very merry Christmas/happy holidays and happy new year to you!

I find it annoying when it's the same band every game.  
---
Switch it up, make it interesting.  Jackal, blitz, echo and clash is what you see 80% of games.  That's boring.
---
I tk if they clearly saw they were injured and It was casual. If i JUST knocked them and as they were falling they died, then that's fine
---
Too free. Everyone else has to work for it and give some risk. It's really hard to get the drone in there against good players anyway. Wayyyy too busted, friend.
---
Oh my god this is the most petty thing I have ever read. Cry me a river and play a different game
---
i swear i did this on bank in server while iq was in tunnel. she started sprinting toward me so i chraged with a knife
---
Just has to look super jittery.
---
Nokk elite?
---
I got maestro and I love it
---
Buff them in other ways, not weapon and speed changes. Ela is strong, you just have to use her right. Lesion bring OP makes Ela look shit when Lesion is the issue not her
---
The way I look at it, you dont have to spend renown on an op you didnt want. Feels bad buying an OP you dont intend to play.
---
I got maestro
---
If you're tired of dying 30 seconds in the round and have Steam, just download another game like team fortress 2
---
LMAO. 92% pr btw. If jager was released as a dlc op today it would be ela 2.0
---
How to set Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege to recruit difficulty
---
Just subscribed keep it up!
---
Damn I wish I got him I’m gonna save up for him
---
I got male one (I forgot his name) and he is good
---
Same fam, Gotta make the most of the dapper boy though.
---
By herself, nothing. But there was a bug that lasted almost a whole season where she can shoot and have her shield up at the same time.
---
Hello Mrrage46, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eeuwbp/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
But that logic applies to anyone who gets an ACOG on a good weapon. That’s like saying maestro with an ACOG is an issue for lower levels when spawn peaking due to the ACOG and the huge magazine and fast fire rate. 
---
You die and learn for next time. People who don’t want to do that can keep getting spawn peaked until they learn. Harsh reality but that’s how you learn siege
---
I mean his pick rate is probably just so high because of how available he is to all players and how easy to use he is . Like he does come with the game after all .
---
Now I see this...
---
Was only missing wamai and kali and im sitting at 22,000 renown. So very happy for this pack.  I got wamai.
---
If it's funny and friendly it's not toxic
---
That scream 😂
---
Try the new modern warfare, or Titanfall 2, it's different. Titanfall 2 is more fast paced and there is always another trick or movement strat to discover. I highly recommend it
---
I know right haha
---
Thanks dude!
---
I got mozzie from my pack
---
I have the new mw I do like it but when mates aren’t on it’s bad solo imo,might try titanfall thanks
---
Give me your account I’ll log in for you :)
---
How about this:
---
You let Jäger do his job and Wamai will do his. That is the reason you can run ***Both***. Ever consider that? Literally the best of both world. Can't be stoped.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Why does Ubi troll me so?
---
When I say toxic I mean it in more of a buzzword
---
If you want to invite "constructive discussion", try not insulting everyone in the sub with your posts, or going after some straw man who is adamant up about the difficulties of coding. 
---
The ranking system being entirely win-driven incentivizes people to play to win, which in my opinion is ultimately the best approach, even though it can be frustrating when you get matched with bad teammates as a solo queue. If it was driven by something like KD, for example, people ignore objective, hide when the numbers turn against them, and never play team-oriented operators with good team utility but weaker guns (e.g. Valk). There's also no good reason to communicate and help other teammates after you die, if winning doesn't drive your rank. The degree to which you contribute to the chance of winning is the ideal metric of how "good" at the game you are. And if you play enough games, your luck with the quality of your teammates will even out, and your skill will be what drives your rank up or down.
---
What's the time limit on getting one of these bad boys
---
I got burnt out and I’ve been p1-diamond on pc since dustline. I moved over to tarkov since it’s less arcade mechanics and more immersive.
---
None, actually. Personal feelings are tied to the op bio and character and how it is similar to mine, so a Nerf won't change that. But i do know that he'll need to be readjusted sometime in the future. So I just want to see how wamai's presence can affect that, because as it stands, I do find the Wakandan to be pretty frikking influential.
---
What’s that?
---
Wamai?
---
A lot of people got Kali and it makes me afraid to try and spawn peek at all. I don't wanna catch a bullet to the throat.
---
I don't think there is a single better way to buff ela other than to just make her scorpion not have a random horizontal spread. The recoil could still be quite large but as long as it is consistent it would be fine. If every other primary weapon can have a predictable recoil diamond then why would it be a problem for her to have one? Sure Ela is fine in some situations, but if I wanted to play a trap op I would play lesion for more traps/better guns, and if I wanted to play as a cqb anchor I would play someone like smoke.
---
150 for my elite controller. How much was it for that low iq of yours.
---
Yeah him
---
I play on xbox and pc
---
Cool!
---
Damn. That's like... The things I don't play
---
The exact same thing happened to me!!!
---
Err... no. Jager has one of the best guns in the game, is a three speed, and has the most impactful gadget on the defender side only rivaled by valk, bandit, and mira. Note that jager is noticeably better than the last three ops and all 3 of them are considered S/A tier defender ops
---
To say that jagers pr is 92% bc of availability is crazy, hes objectively overpowered but people are just used to him because hes been in game for so long.
---
But if jäger is getting picked over wamai 90% of the time, that completely defeats the purpose on an ‘Alternative’ who should come in and perform similarly but in a different way. 
---
You are throwing operator balance out the window if you leave them how they are!
---
Stop holding bias and look at it openly
---
F
---
did u see the video where Logan Paul sucks peepee
---
Since I just proved you wrong you say whatever and downvote me? lol thx for the karma but I’m still confused on your point on how I should stop complaining lol
---
This is the hotfix that we deserve but don't need!
---
You can ^^ If the attackers put the deffuser on a breakable floor, you can break it and make the deffuser fall off the room
---
With the blue highlight it would basically be giving warden a more complicated acog without the zoom and it’s not too hard to spawn peeks without an acog it’s just not as easy to do it without one like I said the highlight should stay on attacking plus if he would to get this rework it would just be unoriginal
---
Because it's fucking it up like by a wireless connection. You go in, set it all up, and even if you YEETED it out it wouldn't stop it.
---
Wouldn't make sense from a gameplay point, besides perhaps the defuser just needs the initial signal to defuse and then once it has that it can continue to defuse the bomb. You can break a hatch and drop the defuser down a floor and it will stop defusing however.
---
That rarely happens though
---
Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth!
---
*crys in away for the holidays*
---
Yeah, it also happens on pc. The auto reload kinda stop the switching for a 1 second. Really wish it wouldn't auto reload.
---
You can still try...
---
Dont ruin this
---
the way you worded this post makes it seem like everyone you've ever encountered who loaded in slow just _had_ to have been doing this and you know it
---
also have you considered he could have been joking lmao
---
Well he’s been on a buff train so don’t be too sad yet

Hey, I'm new on this subreddit, and I was wondering how you got the 'frost main' beside your username. Sorry if this bothers you guys, or if it doesn't fit here.
---
Those enemies were honestly ass
---
Forget the haters. This looks like it could be good depending on how easy it is to take down and whether it contributes to the team. As long as a bronze can do something to it then it good to me.
---
yeah
---
Bikini, why would you do that to your own son?
---
I got kaid I’m so happy, I got his outfit from the  cowboy event and he’s the most fun I’ve had since I bought kali
---
I think one of the issues is drones physically can't orient themselves any differently from how they are oriented
---
On this point how come mute can't just place a jammer and then just jam the defusers signal
---
You would laugh if you checked his past ranked placements
---
Click on the subreddit itself and then go to the settings top right.  Should say change user flair.  Click on that.

Man ur pullout game is weak

Thanks so much!

UpVoTe tHiS cOmMeNt fOr bLaCk IcE iN yOuR nExT aLpHa pAcK /s
---
&gt;how would 6.1 work
---
Because it is a videogame, so the physics are not constrained to reality-like characteristics. This is someone's measured value from falling to a ping, so I wouldn't take it for exact, but even 8m/s I can't imagine the drone would struggle to make the loop.
---
Mmmm I love a nice empty cup of context in the morning
---
Happens all the time on console, you panic a little and push too hard and because you are facing the other direction
---
Same thing! I still don't have one, all my mates do :(
---
All up to play style. If you lie hunting roamers Jackal is a soild pick with great guns and soft breach. 
---
If you like LMGs and blinding all 9 other people in the server Ying is fun but defeintly not a top choiuce out of the Y2 operators.
---
If you enjoy the support aspect, holding back, droning for your team and providing an easy way to sense someone near. Doki has a nice DMR with no recoil and the same secondary weapons as Vigil. 
---
 If you are a team based player who like to kill defender utility (deployable shields, barbed wire, castle barricades, ect) Zofia has two good primaries and a fun but effective all round kit. 
---
If you like holding site and can be smart about when you take fights and have the ability to wait for the right moment to attack. Mira offers a strong kit as long as you use it properly as well as a shotgun for rotates and wall destruction. 
---
If you enjoy roaming and wasting time Vigil has an amazing SMG and two decent full-auto secondaires. Plus BOSG is so much fun to use. 
---
If you like to sit near site and want to annoy/frustate the attackers Lesion and Ela both have good kits for it, Ela is weaker than lesion but excels in CQC gunfights with the shotgun.
---
Not for me at least this only happens to me when I haven’t been on the game for a week or more
---
Honestly, I can’t stand ACOGs because they put you at such a disadvantage in close quarters, and they still feel very imprecise at long ranges. The Russian ACOG feels a bit better though. Also I suck so my opinion is invalid but still... holo/reflex gang all day every day

I gotchu brother
---
Use P10 Roni, It's way better.
---
Ok that helps a lot.  Thanks!
---
Im not sure
---
3 Speed who is only invisible while walking though.
---
3 Speed would help her mostly in gun fights and needing to do quick rotation by running.
---
Currently, her 2 Speed hinders her imo especially when it comes to repositioning toward the late game.
---
What's so sad
---
My black ice collection- 417, and m870 I get mad everytime so gay. I HAVE 400 HOURS WHY
---
Not only should Nokk be 3 speed, I think we should give her back her flash bangs, it feels more aligned to her character (flash then rush into the room with no one knowing at all)
---
Yep fuck the attackers thinking they can walk there
---
Bandits iron sight
---
Good luck. I’ve been playing for 2 years and it’s the only thing in alpha packs I want but I haven’t got it.
---
gridlock gang, rise
---
That a boy
---
Bosg is still meme weapon k1a is better
---
Sometimes breaks need to be long before the burn out goes away. I play MTG and routinely end up taking 1-2 year long breaks between playing it.
---
I was only missing Kali. Now I’m missing Monty
---
How did u got plat?
---
*happy soviet noices*
---
Why is there a normal chiwawa wereing a berae and face paint
---
Is she faster than the others at rushing though? 
---
Currently she needs to walk most of the time in early stage of the game and pray that there’s no Lesion mines or barbed wires to notify her presence. 
---
Imo Her only weapon is her stealth and 3 Speed would at least help her reposition quickly before going back to being stealthy.
---
Still not appealing enough. Usable, but not versatile over all ranges.
---
There are two steps to playing with a Frost on your team -
---
1: Play as Lesion and place gu behind her traps.
---
2: Kill her.
---
Props to him for thinking of that
---
Okay Kool-Aid man, take it down a notch or two
---
I HAVE. SHE IS VERY COOL.
---
and thanks
---
Or kapkan lol
---
I got fucken jackal lmao
---
She wears it like that in the Hammer and Scalpel short
---
He's pretty good if you can play him right.
---
I can't so I don't use him as much.
---
Looks like he had a run in with sledge, and doc was feelin’ the spirit!
---
Flat Stanley made a guest appearance!
---
Are u sure you didn’t buy the season pass ?
---
Warden is fire tho
---
Lmao!
---
I laughed more than I should.
---
😂
---
My first round I got two kills then ate an impact grenade to the face, considering i get like 1 and fucking die that's good
---
I'm not good at the game but i have fun my own way :/
---
So you get a dlc operator for free?
---
Waste? Isnt Ela good too =(
---
Zofia since Jackal gets banned every match
---
Man everyone is so quick to blame Ubi for their problems
---
Run faster with pistols, but not full size secondaries such as ITA15 shotgun
---
And you really showed them too
---
dammit, you got my attention just because you put nsfw as a flair
---
FR tho, but I got sick of people reporting me falsely bc I'm a girl like, literally wtf and why
---
Mobility is the number representing the speed at which you sprint with that weapon equipped. The lower the number the faster you go with that weapon.
---
Nice
---
AK74M
---
Congrats!
---
spawnpeeking with smoke while 0-2 down on outback attack, copper in a nutshell?
---
Kali only has to shoot once so... kind of?
---
The whole point of Casual was to be a training ground for new players until they hit a high level then they can play ranked. Custom Games are where you go to chill.

---
dunno, feels like coz its not called casual anymore, people have seen that as a free pass to come in and just play to win, not have fun, and maybe do meme strats, everyone is super trying hard now like its ranked.
---
Gotta say 9 assist seems like you had a few kills stolen or your a twitch main
---
thank you!!
---
I can get where you're coming from, but the whole switching roles of casual every round made the original casual sooo much better, and I've played with some friends who are lower levels and still getting players with my skillset and even higher.
---
I am also now a monty main. On my second account I am missing a bunch of operators, who do I get? Amaru (cue sad trombone noises).
---
Oh, try to get on newcomer, I can’t say for sure, but there might not be toxic people on there
---
It was given to anyone that logged in between Dec 13-15
---
Right, and when your team is down or you're on your own for some reason? 
---
I'm not saying he isn't good, but after all the nerfs he's been hit with he's not nearly as good as he was. Let alone "Really powerful". He's a glorified drone.
---
Because it’s a lot of red tape. Ubisoft would have to go through all the submissions, provide 3D models of every one of the 100+ weapons. And you would have to get the winner(s) into a meeting with Siege devs and lawyers to sign a paper saying that Ubisoft now owns that skin, and that the artist surrenders all royalties to Ubisoft. It’s a logistical nightmare
---
Hello jadeedano, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eexcz5/someone_hype_me_up/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Or I could have a sick montagne skin
---
Wow How cool amazing
---
I'm just shit and can never finish the job
---
i mean, her gun still goes up after you shoot though
---
Yeah that's great, but operators seldom get to play within their role for an entire round. Chances are he's going to need to defend himself at some point, and good luck doing that.
---
Too high a level 😓
---
Um but what about newcomer? I know that it wasn't implemented into the game until much later but custom doesnt get you any renown and casual doesnt put pressure on you when you play it unlike ranked, for instance, whenever people say, "dude why are you sweating in casual" it's because casual is a place to chill and not to worry about winning as much and just having fun while also getting renown and xp
---
It’s amazing how often you can meet the same people even at average elo. I see a lot of the same people throughout the season from high silver to low gold.
---
dunno this thing happen every early season
---
Mobility used to be a fantasy stat unless that changed recently. Same thing as reporting a player on console.
---
Also very toxic
---
So I should use her LMG over her AR?
---
haha I was thinking the same thing, but you can't take away from the fact that you 4 banged these dewds with a knife! Sick plays homie
---
Alright, I'll do tht
---
Switching every round leads to a worse over all flow in the match. It feels so much better to play one side than the other. Just flows smoothly rather than getting thrown between the two. 
---
As for the level of competition you face. As long as you are teamed up with your friends the game will pull an average (leaning towards you) for what skill the other players should be and gives you the best match possible. It’s not a perfect system but it’s better than a random one
---
The teamates you need to look for are those that would blame themselves before others. And those who are willing to work to get better if that is your plan as well. If you don't care for getting better then find those you will meme around but not in an annoying or toxic way. The best advice is to never settle or accept terrible things. Keep looking for what you need to find.
---
Yeah Great idea
---
What do u play on
---
Well the need to do something
---
Also, turn to social sites like reddit or moot or other queueing apps. People on those sites are less likely to be toxic.
---
That might be true. Plus Ranked was hell to start because of hackers and people leaving. Might have had something to do with it
---
he recently had a birthday skin
---
Ps4 and Pc
---
Decided a Doc spawnpeek would be too easy in bronze, so had to naenae with the SMG-11 instead
---
That’s where head shots come in (at least when they register)
---
Give Ned Flanders the P90, up the duration of his gadget to be slightly longer, shorten the cooldown of his gadget, and speed up the time it takes to activate his gadget, it takes way too long to look at his watch and get your gun up to fire if a dude is right in front of you.
---
It's an industry-wide shift due to online videos. Players now have access to the latest pro player strats and that is the new baseline. It has become so bad that in another game, a publisher who shall not be named but who took a heck lot of money from another country, put in a special mode for content creators to populate with bots so they can still produce content. Those content creators all failed to win their competition which was won by a little boy. $3 million dollars.
---
Who tf bans Kapkan?
---
 Mozzie
---
But you don’t. So why moan and complain. Just be thankful. It’s like if you got a gift card for Wendy’s for Christmas but complained that it wasn’t for McDonalds. Just say thank you and move on. Except you don’t even have to say thank you because there isn’t a face to face where it’s expected.
---
But it says your a vigil main and he’s year two
---
Switching every round may feel uncomfortable for you, but for others like me who like how casual flows apart from ranked, it's nice to have some variation, and I can get the average mmr thing, but sometimes it can just feel really unfair
---
Siege is nowhere near as toxic as CSGO and League players...It’s pretty close to CoD or Overwatch, but definitely not the most toxic in gaming.
---
 Lithe only way to get the money skin is by opening the Christmas pack of you have all the ops
---
joe momma
---
Personally I’m not big into this it’s a good effort tho
---
*it
---
That sucks
---
Don’t know what event ur referring to but if ur talking about the free operator pack, Jan. 5
---
Are u on PC or console and what region?
---
Unranked maybe
---
Weeb shit?
---
Oh my god please Ubi. I would pay for this
---
*buff
---
I got Jackal.
---
I don't want Jackal can I get the Monty skin pls..
---
Same
---
Against a more coordinated team you’ll struggle to pick a group with just the silenced pistol.
---
This is some of the cringiest, weeb-ass shit I’ve seen if this sub in a minute, and that’s saying a lot
---
I love House but it would be a shit ranked map
---
Shotguns on console are a lot better than PC, at high ranks ela shotgun is really powerful and she’s pretty much an instaban
---
Was it all a lie?
---
O bratka
---
Did you know that IRL, our eyes are not located on the top of our heads?
---
*Sees claymore lasers*

“I’ve got one last surprise for you”
---
Caveira doesn’t have a c4...
---
Isn't there a fuze and thermite pro league actually coming out? I swear I saw something about that somewhere.
---
Nice concept though, I'd spend money on that for sure.
---
Thank you, kind man! :)
---
Zdarova
---
same
---
Now he definitely would stand more menacingly in the corner
---
Yes
---
Think of it this way. CoD games have to be rereleased every year to maintain popularity. Siege is at its most popular since Launch 4 years ago.
---
I have opened over 150 alfa packs and only got common, uncommon, and rare
---
Omg ewwww
---
Happy cake day
---
“gRiDlOcK bAd”
---
ok copper 5.
---
Feed enough
---
Thanks
---
Dat face
---
Oh and for your question, a couple days after Christmas I think
---
Warden: Wearing a suit and a kevlar vest. 1 speed.
---
Lion: Wearing heavy ass protective gear and a massive backpack. 2 speed.
---
Seems like it a lot of the time. 
---
I’m on PS4 and in my most recent game we lost because the last guy ( who was level 153 ) was watching a door in a 1v1 when you could clearly hear footsteps from his side.
---
What they should do, is open the alpha pack, and if you have all the operators, then you get given random selection of an operator and you get the elite. I know that doesn’t seem fair because not every operator has an elite, but it sure as hell is a lot better than a Monty outfit.
---
Slow and steady can be anybody. I mean, you might hate it but shields are sort of like that. But if you are going for a good mix of gadget and weapon. I'd say Zofia is great. She can even cancel bandit tricking along with much much more. Maybe try being a hard breacher too. You have to be super methodical with them. And you have to make sure that several boxes are checked before you breach and plant.
---
I usually go for hibana since she got better frag potential compare to termite
---
I got Wamai, didn't even read what the pack gave....was shocked lol.
---
‘Twas a joke, pertaining to your lack of “Thermite main” user flair
---
Cool, I'll give them a look, thank you!
---
R4-C is easy to me, so is the L85A1, 552 Commando, M762.
---
ah man that sucks, i had the renown to buy my last operator but i opened the pack already not knowing what it did
---
I got the mister ban himself, Jackal
---
1/10 The grenade did not hit the corner
---
I always wonder when the gayebirds I run with will show up in one of these.
---
Hey...
---
Skyscraper?
---
I got Goyo! I had Rose Thorn (legendary) for the Vector, so I was stoked AF. Just didn't want to pay the 25k for him, now I don't have to!
---
Nah rust is
---
 I've seen all of them to the fullest. Rust is definitely. Overwatch can have the crazy shit, but nowhere near as often as rust. Rust toxicity is constant.
---
at LEAST put it on a GOOD gun, like the 416-C or the K1A.
---
ha i use a fuckin hotspot its impossible to boot me out
---
You get a Monty skin
---
Hahahahha, dammit my fault I should have made it to touch the corner
---
I got Warden. I enjoy him more than I thought I would.
---
Ok
---
Anything is helpful
---
I feel you i got warden
---
Only a Monty skin?
---
Yea
---
I have clash purposefully not unlocked so I don’t even have the chance to auto pick her.
---
Get a puck for that headset...then ooo lalala
---
You're welcome! The last tip I could give is trying counter roam. It's more frag centered than hard breach but you have to be methodical in how you hunt roamers with jackal, dokkaebi, Nökk, or perhaps lion.
---
My friend got Clash too.... F
---
The animation is really good though. It’s just that I have OCD.
---
Is it any good?
---
#metoo
---
😁
---
In Thermite's case you should be better using his AR, it is pretty stable and you can benefit from the acog. I recommend you try using angular grip on his AR since it has little recoil.
---
Sounds like some filthy casual shit haha
---
I wish I got her I got ela
---
I believe he uses microsoft paint, but if he doesn't that's at least a good start to try.
---
But more importantly, Lesion is gay.
---
IMO she’s good, but she’s bulky as fuck, and that’s never a good thing, therefore even if you can’t be heard coming, if you are seen, your hit box is so wide Helen Keller would get perfect accuracy on her though. 
---
Not saying she’s bad, but she has all the mobility of my grandma in a hospital bed.
---
I feel like IQ might, doesn’t she do yoga or something
---
Ahh gotcha it got put on another line that might've morefair but I still believe that a measure of progress is necessary greater than levels.
---
Oh, I thought R6 was way more toxic than overwatch and I played both extensively.
---
Only in R6 will I encounter people that are immediately insulting you and teamkilling you. I had many games where people just votekick me immediately after I joined.
---
I was teamkilled yesterday because I didn't want to pick recruit like that the rest of the team. They then took turn tkilling me to make sure I wouldn't ever play this match.
---
People are super toxic in OW too but at least they can't really ruin your game beside making you lose.
---
No way. :( that honestly sucks.
---
At least they dont hate themselves and all the other people playing the game. Or so what I observed. Dota players just hates everybody in the same match they're in, including themselves. But r/dota2 definitely has the most quality shitposts compared to other gaming subreddits
---
Ummmm....
---
I want my 25k
---
When I saw the packs I thought I would get it as it  would allow me to buy the 50 packs :(.
---
Oh no way, that sucks. :(
---
I have the butterfly helmet with the butterfly shield with the christmas monty skin along side with the nickelodeon slime pistol. he's ugly af lol
---
He definitely heard your footsteps and immediately knew where your head was
---
Hey I have a question. I’m currently overseas so will I still get a free operator if I log in next year
---
Which grants more money? Making the skin exclusive and force people to buy their remaining ops with credits or sell the skin for an unpopular op? It’s quite obvious btw
---
Close rainbow then open again
---
Well, not ALWAYS used, but I catch your drift. Like on consulate, hibana is more useful to every site except garage, where thermite accels.
---
Mozzi is one of the best defenders in the game weapon wise so enjoy!
---
I got my first Legendary today!! It was Albi! (I didn’t know they gave operators) Merry Christmas R6!
---
Glad to hear. Enjoy your new op or the little helper Monty :D
---
Next year as in jan 1?If not you need to log until Jan 5th to get the pack.Maybe get someone trustworthy to open it.
---
There is a super simple way to connect your phone to cemu and turn it into a gyroscope actually, if you are interested i can find the link
---
The .44 mag is just a distance headshot meme mashine(if you have tcsg ACOG), if you want to use it up close better equipe that laser.
---
as 4 me she is the best op(and tho only one with shield in defence. maybe cause i'm playing guys with shields almost always).   
---
dunno why noone like her.
---
I got an elf skin for Montaigne
---
Clash is worse atm
---
Of course, you proved it for me. Thanks!
---
Ya get a monty skin
---
[removed]
---
I read that first sentence in Jar Jar's voice lol
---
Fix on Ts for a week now so a week of eveything works out fine.
---
You'd have to grind to level 30 before you could play Ranked
---
Isn't she banned in quick too?
---
Wow
---
End of Shifting Times or beginning of y5s1
---
HAHAHAHA , we got a comedian
---
Trash talk is fine smh
---
I got vigil
---
Username checks out
---
I will say. The newest weapon skins look amazing.
---
Subtle humble brag.
---
It is a full game tho lol
---
If you know how to use her, she's godly. I've gotten a few aces before with her.
---
I got Jackal :(
---
I got clash too
---
F in the chat
---
Got kaid!Best defender I have by far,thanks ubi for giving me the better electric defense op so I don't need to unlock drug man
---
The bot stopped responding to you :(
---
Already did
---
She is disabled again????? The heck
---
What would be nice is a black ice 2.0, I liked the rainbow skin we got for ela but this with this 3D effect of black ice.
---
Yep, you're a joke alright
---
I know. :( it PM’d me saying it would no longer reply. 💔
---
Or just pop a hole in the usual windows and hold only one of them. 
---
Or just make a bullet hole facing SW and shoot anyone who walks into the soccer area
---
But then you are asking for other people to buy new accounts and grind for memes. Seems like a rather small demographic for a Reddit LFG post
---
Hopefully...
---
Ikr, Im just enjoying poking at him.
---
I honestly don’t get the hype of Black Ice. It looks good but it’s way over hyped. I’m more a fan of the newer Pro Team skins. Like the FNATIC, Nora-Rengo, Faze, and G2 skins. The nice accent trim with the beautiful complimentary colours
---
If I go on now do I get a free op
---
I got warden F
---
That warms my heart
---
How do you get this pack?
---
Buck confirmed wavy 🌊
---
No it doesn't lol. Who tf holds a gun such that the optic, resting, is above your eyes?! Lmaooo
---
Lmao
---
Soy
---
I don't know if anyone noticed this, but since I've been playing with my sound turned up a little more, the sound your own operator makes drowns out the more subtle sounds around you, especially if you have 2 or 3 armor. So I thought, instead of making her a 1 armor, her ability should either nullify your own sounds that **you** can hear as well, not only those that others can hear, or amplify the sounds **you** don't make, or maybe even both. I have found that, while playing Caveira, you do not encounter this issue, and it is extremely useful to use your ears to detect attackers, even while they are slow walking(which can be almost impossible in anything but complete silence). So having to contend with roamers as Nokk when you can't hear almost anything while moving feels difficult to me. Just some thoughts.
---
And other imaginary scenarios that never happen.
---
Thank you very much :3
---
CHEATER
---
I thought mozzie was
---
That's really good matey
---
but in what way did you mean the phrase "mmmm soy" because I'm just confused?
---
Happens every time
---
R6’s roster is starting to look like Mortal Kombat
---
I just noticed
---
I would be willing to try it but the highest part I could think of in the moment was on kanal standing right at the top however I think favela has some higher parts by far and yes I did account for the pause at the top.
---
Fundamentally those equations are the same and can be derived from each other with a tiny bit of rearranging so it wouldn’t make a difference
---
Yay
---
Im sorry you are no one to dictate what belongs to the sub or not. Its a discussion about a issue which whether you like or not frustrates alot of console players. You presume I didnt google search, an issue with result no result to fix isnt really a good answer. If its mods think it doesnt belong, then they'll remove it. 
---
My post didnt simply say fix it or even just stop it. My point being it should be addressed or be addressed better. There is rule which isnt being enforced. Okay so why have the rule in the first place. Like I said im not just saying go fix it. Anyway thank you for the information but next time lets not be so snarky.
---
Look at the gemstone bundle:  
---
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege-gemstones-bundle/c563bzc29vxh
---
The green, blue, purple and red gemstone skins all have the pattern and reflections in the exact same place. The only difference is a change in hue. You're telling me that you genuinely believe that each of these textures is applied by hand?
---
* all we need is more gradient skins
---
Okay. People love to think that PC is preffered over Console and PL over PC. 
---
Quite simply, you are wrong. It just takes longer for support to come to console given that each patch and fix has to be paid for and tested/verified with Sony and Microsoft before it can go live. Makes it hard to be as helpful and active when you have a nightmare of a process to go through before anything can be done. 
---
A couple things to back up my statements. This tweet is pinned to the top of the R6 Community Manager's profile. [https://twitter.com/ItsEpi/status/1174439113040322562](https://twitter.com/ItsEpi/status/1174439113040322562)

It was a daily routine. Then I took a vacation and there were Aussies
---
Bro Mr. Game and Watch in R6S. Crazy.
---
Who do you main?
---
It's to try and bait Monty, but Rook wasn't quick enough
---
I'm not criticizing it. I played daily for years. I meant a campaign and story.
---
As a former Blitz main, I can confirm.
---
Damn, I thought he meant it like in this video  Youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
Hibana is the female Japanese operator
---
They just only now fixed the shield meta, and added role queue so you have to wait 8 minutes to play dps.
---
Lol fuck favela. I ran into people who had walls on this map and just tapped my team

Try coping your files of R6 into the Uplay games section of your program files

how i actually look:

A rook today gifted us his armour, before being clapped by an oblivious lv 20
---
Its like hardcore snd with BO3 style specialists and a destructable environment.
---
Now that you mention it, that is what happened. I thought that person got shot through a wall or something after I knocked. The animation for the downed played looked dead on my second zoom in.
---
What do I do with this pack? :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
with amaru's gadget?
---
But if I'm watching their statuses it does not make sense to not understand a weird language or something un-readable. Right?
---
now that I know your reddit account I'll be following you &lt;3 :P
---
Make a custom game by yourself on a map with a tall object, eg, the lamp sits outside kafe and try and keep your crosshair on the top or noticeable feature. Walk around a 180 around it while ads’ing the point. Keep doing this till you find the “_sweet spot_”
---
I know, but why do I have to see it? It doesn't make sense
---
A miracle

Believe me, it is, especially in a tactical shooter like Siege.
---
Is he now? I must have missed that.
---
It will be awful. You must be prepared. But once you git gud, this game is awesome.
---
My advice would be to focus on your favorite attackers/defender in non-ranked mode as soon as it becomes available considering your level. 
---
Non ranked and ranked is basically 12 maps, always the same 12 maps. Focus on it, this game shines when you know perfectly maps and angles as attacker AND defender. 
---
Play non ranked/ranked as much as possible, play against good people you will make you better quickier. Avoid quick games.
---
Don’t teamkill. Use a mic. Know your utility and your role. (Ex : Mute MUST use its gadgets in the first 10 seconds or it’s mostly wasted)
---
Watch kill cams and friends when you’re down. You may discover a new spot, path, ability... etc
---
It would only be fun on defense and it wouldn’t for attack. Roamers with ACOG are not fun but you are entitled to your opinion
---
Quite the contrary, it hinders the enemy push if youre successful.
---
i will give it a go!
---
How so?
---
I love marksman. Makes solid CoD SnD videos
---
No, through the chimney
---
Hinders the enemie to push? Enemies that just spawned and are still outside the building? That’s not tactical
---
She must've been naughty.
---
apparently the rest of the clip cant be uploaded i completely made an idiot of myself...
---
Merry Christmas lmaoo
---
Aight, ty.
---
Got gridlock…
---
Shield desync is one of the worst things this game has yet to properly fix or address
---
Looks like an overwatch version of the character. I like it!
---
Yeah like he’s dying in game not real life lol
---
The breathing. You hear it down the hallway. suddenly,you see a blue light. You desperately spray you magazine into it. To no avail. You close you eyes and except you fate. But your only knocked out! And even better, your teammate is comeing to pick you back up! Then you realize that your teammate is being chased by one to, and the asshole blows up on you, killing you. You rage quit and break your controller.
---
Dont judge a mans nails
---
I've always called the balcony by cocktail the new balc because well.. it's new. Where as cigar balc has always had that balcony there. Weird to see cigar balc called new balc for me at least.
---
Nice. And platformily speaking? Pc? Ps4? Xbox?
---
Running away screaming like shit cause he came around the corner and I was mid reload..... I miss him
---
FMG-9, shotgun on attacker are not really good.
---
That's badass.
---
Got so angry aswell 
---
"Trash your ip address looks nice cunt"
---
Gridlock hands down. She may be slow and loud, but her utility is god tier. Smokes and spikes that make planting the defuser and protecting it a breeze, using the spikes on stairs to prevent easy flanks from roamers, a secondary shotgun that’s great for utility, and a really good AR. She has it all, so the speed thing is negligible.
---
Oi. Why you sayin that about us?
---
Nokk - FMG-9
---
Smoke - Shotgun
---
Hostage is immune to fire though.
---
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOA- wrong map
---
Jesus, Buddy it’s a game, if he got really annoy he could always just leave the lobby
---
I got clash :( 
---
I've been thinking about buying her anyway but I can't even use her because she's temporary disabled
---
Gridlocks amazing, you say that like its a bad thing.
---
Problem with that is he lacks a life and is to lazy
---
Not new
---
Sledge/Thatcher on attack
---
Rook/Doc on defense.
---
What about cats though? 🐈
---
Damn that's hard.
---
Was 2 games away from plat last season, losing streak, busted. Back down to silver.
---
damn i for warden lmfao
---
Hahaha if anything I’d be easier to leave than DDOS 😂
---
I always die to C4 placed in the most random places. The bombers I could deal with but the god damn C4... always gets me.
---
Ok. That's good. I thought I would miss the event
---
Not my play style, I tend to play with ops like zofia, ash, etc.
---
He lacks no life so god if I know 
---
Also we should move this to private messages this is a long thread
---
Yea last season i was stuck in silver cuz i solo qed to much. Have at least 3 guys to play with now if i do ranked  wld highly advise doing the same
---
Spawnpeeking Santa while on attack?
---
Got ying, no clue what she does
---
is there something similar on xbox
---
The nose is offcenter and it's killing me.
---
Oh, damn too bad. Thanks! https://prnt.sc/qf7uty &lt;- and this one also?
---
as long as they remove the text from it
---
Yeah probably 😂😂
---
same her M249 has surprisingly low recoil
---
Damm just realised
---
Capping hard
---
Sadly I can’t quite remember, but I feel like we lost that extra round.
---
That's how I enjoy my coffee
---
Looks like he meleed just before the shield was fully unextended causing it not to get pushed off
---
It wasn't popular
---
I already gave Khan a weapon from the Western Nations, I want his weapons to symbolize Western and Eastern influence in Kazakhstan.
---
Ah, I see. You never know until you play her though. I personally play her often in ranked and if you have at least one other person in coms she is insane. She has entry denial and smokes plus a great primary with a secondary shotgun to destroy soft walls or hatches. It’s a much less selfish pick and in higher ranks you will get rewarded for it. It’s also pretty easy to drag out with her kit lol.
---
Yes its also old one
---
yes, me

I’m feeling like a 7.47287372783/10 is the best answer for that ace

Wah

You are triggering my ptsd

Why are you defending people who act like assholes online? It's not fun; it doesn't make people laugh; it's not a joke. It's just childish. Maybe you should realize who the cretin is here.

That’s pretty good

they wanted to limit them since many people are salty about em, but there's still more than enough on kanal

also the "peek free" map is tower, see how that turned out lol
---
HOW do you want nøkk instaed of mira
---
Got nøkk too, no desire to actually buy her before I got the pack, but I for sure don't say no to 25k for free.
---
YOU ARE SO UPSET LMAO. You call them childish when you’re the one getting so offended over an obvious fucking meme, if you’re so sensitive get off the fuckin internet you hermit

You got any turrets?

I'm here trying to plant the bomb and this nigga with asthma pulls up with the fury of anakin as he slaughters the tusken raiders including the women and the children.
---
Cause I wanted the worst operators
---
Ok good but also don’t be afraid to interro yes this was a bad situation but yeah
---
Ja, natuurlijk
---
Hey, a fellow maestro.
---
Well I have all the operators and this year it sucks, every other time you get 25k renoun but now I got elf gear for MONTAGN
---
If Montagne has to fight the entire team or even one person, that’s a team failure and maybe a Montagne failure. Teams support Montagne and he provides call outs.
---
As long as you log in before the fifth of january

You better watch out.

It’s not the boys he hangs out with I’m 13 and play siege very often just from watching videos I’m a straight a student and it’s not bad for you I’m the same old me (I started playing rated m games at 6) Don’t worry about it

4/5 because I like to leave room for improvement, but that was thoroughly satisfying.

Wow you get stupid enemies, I always have stupid teammates

This is some Isis shit
---
I love you too

Yeah intentional af... I guess it’s a new toxic trend. Happened to me yesterday.
---
tbh the rooms full of barbed wire and c4 were worse especially if it was at an off angle where you can't shoot the c4 but if you tried to run by and run away, it would still damage you through a soft wall or a drone hole
---
:(
---
The heroes shoot at cameras!
---
ngl, when I first saw Vigil, I thought he was a white mask who realized his mistakes and joined Rainbow to make up for his wrongdoings. But because of the childhood memories he made during his childhood years in White Mask, he can't let go of the mask entirely. Maybe its because the ideals of the White Mask Organisation was right, just the execution was wrong.
---
He wears the mask to remind himself of the ideals he believes in but executing it in a more justifiable manner.

Haven’t played in months but they actually removed them?

Ditto.
---
I'm an idiot and opened it immediately, oh free pack.

I was only missing the 2 new ops. Would happily trade 50k renown for the Monty outfit. Fug.

Me and my buddies, hated them
---
Something something well trained terrorist organization?
---
Omg that reminded me, just yesterday I was playing thunt on hard on consulate. Went into garage, got swarmed and pushed from double door towards white van. There was c4 on side of it, which I shot running behind it, trying to reload my guns, qhile getting shot at, low health, can't hear shit coz of it, when I dropped behind white van just to die to another c4 mirror placed on the other side of van.
---
 I was blown away with laughter. I bet someone at ubisoft thought of similar scenario and put them c4s there on purpose.
---
Yea I kinda miss them, maybe a hunt that has customizable options?
---
I appreciate it man, but my job keeps just keeps me too busy. Thank you though.

AYYYYYY WE GOT SAME FLAIRS!!!

You could do that,yes. Kinda works especially if you frag.

Not every device can do that

Yep, the bombers and nitro cell rooms are gone.

yup

No cause it will destroy the ads. U can use a lesion mines and then the cat will die from gu poisoning.

I mean yeah
---
I love the elf skin
---
Yeah, I love playing as Kali. Her rifle is insane, and the C75 is a great secondary for CQC.

You are gonna get RFF! Santa is an attacker too

Ah yes plenty, because for some reason you can only play thunt in 30 fps on console

Is it bad that I love Warden just because both he and I are moustached white guys and both former Marine Assaultmen? 
---
Is this what's it feels like to be represented?

He's pretty cool. He has two good guns so he is fun on top of good gadget.

Anybody remember fighting them with shottys? Always fun

I don't miss them

Why does wamai actually kinda look like the puffer fish

Maverick is from Boston but he spent so much time in Afghanistan on assignments that he took on a bunch of their customs. He even has a tattoo of Afghanistan on his arm. It's also why he speaks Farsi when he pulls out his torch sometimes.

Everyone should... they've only been gone for like 2 seasons.

how many days did it take since the first error ?
---
Me and the Bois have skill
---
I was being sarcastic......
---
Jesussss 11.6 that’s insane
---
I honestly haven't seen much hate from this platform, but other sites give them crap all the time. I also feel like Ubi may not be giving the most resources to siege. They are more proud of their new projects.

Yeah but I don’t know if OP knew that

"Does Ela need a REWORK || Gets answered" Just discussed if Ela need a REWORK, and Get Answered is the name of the series.

“This is why you should be banning Valkyrie (even if you’re good with her)” That's not clickbait at all, it just throws tips around.

The problem isn't runouts, it's spawnrushes. Also if you plant the defuser and camp outside with instant detection it's gg, so it's ok like it is. The problem is the spawn
---
My friend got this too and he broke his monitor
---
It doesn't work there because the code has 16 letters and I can only type in 12 letters
---
Jager and mozzie are just better roam options then vigil. Jager has a better gun, and has one of the best gadgets in the game, mozzie has a shotgun secondary with better, long term intel denial as a gadget.

How you get the free operator?? I dk t see the holiday pack anywhere...

next u need a kapkan trap

It's hard to read but the most noticeable thing is that warden is your 3rd most played op.

Must have updooted alot these last few weeks

Thanks you really helped me

But there are literally countless other countries that haven't been represented at all yet in Siege, there's already 4 Germans.

Both platforms have problems. Though I still feel it is less severe on pc, it is certainly there

Dude wanted to have school experience but you just ruined it by hitting him

sure he did bud

Not a real thing

And it’s with the black ice MP5
---
It almost always has a thumb tack on the seat
---
Did you make this or buy it online??
---
It's not intended and when the kill cam is like that it's almost always a kill feed bug.

I’m not going to complain about a free outfit, but I hate it and I doubt I’ll ever use Monty lol

Welp I wish I could help more but I can’t

True, but what you can’t use can’t hurt ya.

I really wish theyd put him back as a pick..
---
Wait, thats illegal
---
Nokk doesn't seem to mind
---
Yeah I was in a game when that happened lol
---
Or they could buff it to be usable.
---
If I've learned anything from when I don't get Jager in casual, just having a Jager on your team does not mean that he is going to place the ADS anywhere that is actually useful.

It's bad on PC too...
---
How have they not patched this yet?
---
Its 24 hours before chrimbus they aint gon do it
---
The quarantine zone? What about it
---
What was your previous rank?
---
It's really not, it could have been on accident, it could have been because the other guy was trolling with flashes.
---
Granted she might not have a very good gadget, but a 3 speed with a spray Lmg and smg11 will be too broken. Flat zero downsides.
---
This needs more attention tbh
---
those are the most upsetting losses as the 5 man team. this game is designed to be in the advantage of those with more guns in play so to lose to a 2 man team means they were playing stupid or didn't belong in that rank at all.
---
Warden ain’t even a boomer
---
Get iq.
---
Like.....she's been almost a must for the last 1 year now.
---
She needs armor more then speed. So she's fine how she is imo.
---
Oh well I just try to have fun
---
Ranked is impossible without a squad
---
Figured everyone would have siege by now.
---
Then whoever got tked (if it was an accident) should put when asked that it was an accident. That’s was that’s for
---
Good gadgets, good guns with v little recoil. Just all round good
---
You can play all kinds of people during ranked placement matches, to the extremes or to the lows of what you were last season. That's the point of placements. To give a good indication of where you should be. 
---
Unranked mode and casual mode is a zoo. People's ranks don't matter there at all. Someone in plat can easily have a low casual MMR. Casual is much harder in general because of the unpredictablity of the people you get with and against you. If you want a more fair matchmaking experience play ranked. It's not perfect, but it's better than casual.
---
I'm going to thermite it.
---
It may be what it's for but not everyone uses it how it's supposed to be used.
---
Oh by the way, Zo's actually a short haired **redhead**.
---
Check it out. Her hair is red. Another redditor here first pointed it out.
---
You livin' in the past?
---
ouch, I feel that
---
Dropped 16k carrying the game playing the objective and still lost
---
I see what you’re trying to do, but that’s a quarantine zone... which is like a real life thing not a reference to R6
---
Chanka all day
---
At least since it’s been out of ranked
---
As rook?
---
I've had it I just forgot to post it
---
Omg you should be in pro league
---
Basically forcing them to learn angles &amp; maps quicker. Ella+shotty= fucking up whole teams more often than not, kinda funny too especially when you’re with your diamond bros.
---
Blame Ubisoft for the shitty matchmaking, it’s all on them. Not fair at all for us 2/300s to be paired up with lvl12s
---
Why are you complaining about a free operator?
---
Alibi is my main. 3 speed, good gun, and can block window access.
---
Last time it took them like 2-3 weeks i think before she was back.. i miss her too man she can’t come back fast enough.
---
Gold 3
---
Noice
---
People give these posts shit and then the posts complaining about what operator they got get plenty of upvotes. Fucking hippocrates, easy to say when they got something worth 10,000-25,000 renown.
---
Here is an idea, how about you not kill them? JUst play the game dude. Who cares if you get trolled one round... like yes, it sucks, but if you turn around and TK them you're literally just as shit as they are... on top of the fact that RFF takes care of it for future rounds. If he's stacked they can kill you like twice before everyone gets flagged. Just report for toxic shit and move on. If it's casual you can just go find another game without being trolled lol
---
I’ll check back every couple hours, it is a pretty busy day, but luckily the game is on sale for a bit. Just make it obvious you want a copy of the game.
---
The storm is a nice lil gun and her gadget is useful at literally every skill level.
---
Bruh I’m taking down your door almost instantly
---
R6 quarantine, their next game
---
Where did you get the weapon skin from? Is it universal?
---
Oh dude it looks like you were extremely unlucky feels bad man
---
It's been low key on the menu since release really, but it's been pretty quiet lately afik. I'm sure it's on the menu, but it's kind of a hard op to adjust without thinking about it for a bit. Either way, even if she gets reworked it doesn't mean she will be bad?
---
This was a GIGN Civil War!
---
Congrats way to score one of the most  seeked black ice skins too!
---
No, just that all the Christmas stuff from last year didn’t see the new year so I would imagine it’s the same this year
---
Yeah really is way less severe. And this guy has no idea.
---
Still won’t stop my rush
---
Nice. I got my first one on pc about 2 days ago for the Aug A2
---
Yes! Or course i’ll try
---
You guys get black ice,Ive been playing for 3 years and not a single black ice and 2 of my friends who play siege with legit black ice and they started 2 seasons ago
---
Ubi hates me
---
And doc mains who have cool cosmetics on rook
---
Easy just use the controller.
---
Or if you want to use MnK get a computer and run the game on that
---
Dude, give them to your friends, we don’t deserve this...
---
Ain't that a first
---
Last year I got Valkyrie on PC and Ela on PS4, this is a nice gesture by Ubisoft doing this event. 👍
---
Stop the clip at 0:16. Glass is broken before the melee.
---
When they all showed up lmao. They reminded me of ducks
---
Wouldn’t it take longer to screen record?
---
No.
---
It literally just got nerfed
---
Still really good
---
casual? I just played two ranks and my teammates were blackbeard
---
I don't have a specific main, but I am a pleb that always picks rook over doc because I feel like a nub with the stim.
---
Gave me a laugh. I love to play Rook lol
---
Best live action and best animated
---
I’d suggest playing Newcomer until you hit level 50, than try and switch over the Quick Match and try your hand there. Most people are willing to help if you use your mic they will help. If you want to just relax and have some fun Quick Match is the place to do it. It’s nice to just relax and learn the maps and see how the enemy team holds or moves through your the map. It’s a complex game and there is no easy way around the learning curve. Just enjoy yourself, and try and play with an active brain that is looking at your surroundings and taking in the information

Kinda just stopped playing siege after a while the toxicity is just unbearable it's like a 10 year old squeaker playing PUBG while his parents argue about divorce ik the background ( hit me with the r/oddlyspecific
---
Claymores and kali new strats
---
Takes 11 knocks to open
---
Nah Rook is really good, it's just a meme lol. Arguably Rook always does more for the team anyway lol.
---
I’m not good enough to but Rouge-9 sure is. https://youtu.be/LKo4xMhcAxY
---
I used to be undercover. I did time, I had to deal drugs. I even had to kill. And I was so good at it that…. It got me a promotion
---
The ar is better actually it has very low recoil and a high dps can't see any reason to pick the lmg over the ar on gridlock unless you love to prefire doorways post plant... Btw i hit mid plat 3 for 2 season mostly maining gridlock ar only on attack shes a great site op
---
I was lucky enough to get the 553 in Black Ice, but ever since, I've gotten 4 more 553s in Black Ice as well......🤦‍♂️
---
Nerd
---
He was the first defender that I really played lol. It's nice to have an impact on the game regardless of dying early or not. lol.
---
Think I've seen a video with a title like that lol
---
Seriously?
---
Where can I get one of these
---
Free weekend already?
---
Just try to play for fun, I stopped getting tilted at games (back when I would play MW2) because I realized how stupid it is to get mad at a game, so I would queue with friends and we would throw for fun by doing stupid challenges, I've pretty much never gotten tilted ever since and enjoy gaming.
---
Whenever you get angry just take a break, workout get your blood plumping. Meditate.

Plat and up literally bans Ela on maps Mira isn’t used. The PC community doesn’t understand console siege very much.
---
Regular ranked.
---
Vegas was the BEST back in the day. Never had more fun than in Vegas 1 + 2.
---
"I am four parallel dimensions ahead of you"- u/metastability117 and Speed Runner Mario
---
Wait, gridlock isn’t a guy?
---
What rank are you? Not being inflammatory, just think it's odd that you see so many low-level players.
---
Why tho
---
I’m aware lmao most PC players don’t know console doesn’t have aim assist
---
Yeah lol  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1bBWdqK3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1bBWdqK3yM)
---
Where is the lesion mine?
---
Just curious, if ur champ 35 do u use keyboard and mouse
---
Why are people like this?
---
Y5 S1 seems to be the time to finally get rid of client side debris. As much as shield desync annoys me I want the pieces of barricades to finally hit the floor
---
She’s a good character in my opinion, but don’t be afraid to try a character out.
---
Lol wtf
---
I just got her as well and I found the best way to win is support with the stingers.
---
If your team plants the defuser just toss them around so they cant easily get on it, cutting off high traffic areas stops them from rotating, tossing them on stairs screws over roamers.
---
&gt;His punch made a glass punch hole in the metal part of the shield bottom left from the glass.
---
I'm unsure what this means. "Glass punch hole in metal part of the shield"? Is the punch hole on glass or not?
---
yea i think she's by green stairs
---
Whatcha mean, boss?
---
I love it!
---
No I’m controller one of the few lol, I use strike pack for crouching but that’s it.
---
Well, it doesn't stops them from inerrogation and Cav can just shoot again anytime, so not a big dеal.
---
I honestly don’t know. I enjoy the content though

Probably one of the better Y4 ops, hacking drones stops enemies from getting info, you can hide drones in clever spots for your team, has a great primary and the shotgun is great for rotates.
---
oh no
---
You only get shown 3
---
Her shooting through it while blocking bullets
---
Well I tested it and it seemed to work soo. Whatev thanks I guess
---
Use it only if you want your operators extra thicc
---
I h a d t o d e a l D R A A G S
---
what limits this to new players? If you've played this game for than 5 minutes you'd know that there's level 50+ that play like this
---
But hey, your representing the SAS, which is the best team
---
Look at the compass on your HUD, that actually also tells you the technical call out for the room. Get used to using the compass/key repeating themes for map calls. Colors. Blue hall, Red stairs, White stairs, West stairs, East stairs, Halls, etc. All of those things are normal callouts on several maps. Super easy to identify too. Same with some halls, same with some rooms, etc. Piano in a room? Chances are it's called piano for most players. Don't over thing it, read the names of the rooms your in and try and remeber them a bit. 
---
Now... that being said, Terrorist hunt/custom with friends. There is a  map filter for T hunt, turn all modes but classic or bomb off, filter all the maps but the one youre trying to learn, and go run around it. Fuck some AI up, read the names of the rooms, feel the flow of the map and it'll be a lot easier. It gets better with time and just some common things like that.
---
Ik think you've got to love console is better
---
It's hardly noticeable honestly I'm not amazed nobody knows. And the shotgun is still good it's just not the best shotgun in the game anymore
---
Can’t lmao, I would definitely trade t out though.
---
Noot noot
---
Its because of his black armor
---
Yea i have seen the compass and tried to use it a bit. I'll try the custom games for sure and i have played some terrorist hunt with friends.
---
I mean, they did have a country. Supposedly still do.
---
It was my first post
---
is it rare?
---
THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH MMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I bought a figurine. Upvotes to the left fellow gamers.
---
Yeah like I said, play it for the express purpose of learning the map. If you play bomb on T hunt, there are 20 terrorists. If you kill them all you have free reign of the map until you plant the bomb. Once you plant 20 more spawn. Just don't plant. Run around the map. Look at the spots you have problems with etc.
---
ok
---
Which one did you get?
---
Feel bad for people who got her from the free pack, probs won’t be able to use her til year 5
---
Hey a fellow maverick
---
Dude Mozzie is my fav. Jackal on attack for the main reasons. But if I'm playing to win I will usually pick ops based on strats.
---
This happened to me and it pisses me off
---
Cav cos I like to hear the screams and cries of noobs all over the world
---
***Fin.***
---
Always, lol
---
Nøkk look like she's about to air out that whole base...
---
300IQ play , using tachankas glass for cover would never cross my mind
---
These are the presents she got for zofias kid and the kid saw them.
---
It was awful. I played valkyrie, threw  my cams, but never used them... I got called by Doki (back when you had to manually turn it off) and I literally didn't know what was happening. i thought it was some kind of alert for my cameras being fucked with or some shit. It was wild times. I shot a guy though. Even killed one. It was on bank. I palyed behind tellers desk from the start of the round... lie a neanderthal. Sheesh.
---
/r/SiegeAcademy/
---
How?
---
Or Ying if you stun people a lot
---
Marry her
---
I saw this posted a few weeks ago, so it's not new, but it's still sleek AF
---
She’s frustrating but I think to solve this is to change her a bit, they don’t have to do that much
---
Yeah. I’ll admit my team does ban him often, but only on maps we really want to roam on (we have one anchor in our five stack, that’s it...) but at least we recognize he’s not bad on every map. 
---
And we certainly aren’t brain dead enough to ban him if we attack first
---
my friend got this around a week ago
---
You’re gay
---
But that does require stopping and droning people out so you don't waste stuns
---
Mozzie. He’s so much fun and useful
---
I really don't care what skin I get such as long as it looks nice and it's for a gun I use. So...
---
It’s a joke they made on account of wamais magnets
---
Europe
---
Also don't shoot out cams, if the enemy knows one is out then you have given away that you are coming. Don't sprint, you can be heard doing that.
---
Even as someone who is capable of getting aces with alot of headshots, I have moments like this too
---
Use her like a defender: roam around
---
I think it was 16
---
Oh! Sorry, I didn’t notice your tag in the picture before. Won’t happen again.
---
no im bi but 50% right is about the most a bandit main has ever got correct
---
yeah I got that too but I dont even use the 552 commando
---
The forbidden skin
---
Lesion. Easy to use, just make sure to anchor with him. Maestro is godly but takes a lot of knowledge to use, and sense you don’t have all ops I’m guessing your new and don’t have a ton of game sense.
---
Still gay
---
Unacoged shots fired.
---
get a ring. right. now.
---
The shotgun is fine but even with the deagle it’s a freakin joke, she needs better secondary
---
3000iq play
---
Well yes but actually... yes?
---
Caviera has a soulmate
---
He has 3 stims, and 5 people on a team
---
I ain’t a math major, but I don’t think that’ll work
---
A lot but I would switch up the build because that is a crazy bottleneck, spend more on the GPU less on the cpu and more in the ram, but you could still get decent frames.
---
So did I!!!
---
Yup should at least know how to play every op on base level but hey, it’s all about having fun
---
When you run out of breach charges
---
I remember the Hereford base rework everyone hated it and you would get it once out of 3 games
---
I sometimes play warden and let me tell you how many times I have been sworn at because it looks like I hack when looking through smoke.
---
BB is one of the better ops in the game so that's a pretty good pull.
---
