Why is there a gloating phone next to Dokabei

That was over 1 second

I like your girlfriend's cosplay, but i can't see yours...

Days before phantom sight ended

I personally would like this in the game
---
God my friend can relate to this
---
Sorry recruit stays on
---
Oh no I'm just kidding, I dont recruit rush much, kinda stops being funny once you realize it's a dead meme like lord chanka or fuzing hostage
---
Does this mean the new map is the yaght but it's actually at sea?

You two look really cute together😊

How did you not get arrested

This is a glitch that happens to me all the time - kinda

annoying 😂
---
I mean, both managers could be lying but both of them, Faze's and Nip's managers said ESL requested them all the documents and their visa would be ready at the end of them regional finals. So it's kinda ESL's fault.
---
Literally out of every cosmetic in this game, I want this one the most, I would pay money for this pls ubi
---
No it wasn’t
---
There’s no new map it’s a rework of theme park
---
Respect bro. You have been through a lot. I didn't pick the game in the beginning because I heard all the problems and lack of content it had.
---

---
I have to say. After 100 hours of playing. The game is pretty damn fun, it has weird or annoying people at times, but seeing how it began, it's nice to see ubisoft didn't abandon the game and the players
---
We're fight Somali pirates next season
---
Ya know they could also be squads in like discord that just ignore you
---
I was legit was surprised because I thought siege got a graphics update
---
Dang I'll take it, loved them park when it was new but it got old quick
---
A seen vigil is a bad vigil

Would be pretty cool to have a map on the sea, occasionally have a wave or something that makes the map wobble

I downvoted to make up for the people who upvoted, also I’d wait

Yep. Game chat exists for a reason

I really want a camo next season that is a better version of black ice, Even though black ice is amazing.

Doesn't negate my point. Look at his weapons stats. His weapons are clear underperformers, it is just that his gadget is absolutely amazing. Capitao is never picked for his weapons.
---
100% sure we'll get some dumb looking outfits, like Dokkaebi, Maverick, Lesion Elite, Amaru, Smoke Elite...

Not a glitch

I have 100 so some nice tips I'd to taken it lightly, learn the maps at your pace and try all the operators to find who you like most.
---
Always reinforce your walls (specially in Favela)
---
And have a lot of fun my man, people generally are nice and understand you're new. There are assholes like in any multi-player
---
Also, try to stick to your team and don't peek the same way that they do because you'll give two easy kills to the enemy if they know where you are
---
Good ol’ Peeping Tom
---
Can confirm,

Source: Spammed Ela in Ranked yesterday and went 7+ kills or 1- kills.

Stick to ranked. Y even play casual, full of trolls.

Nice shot.

How does that camera see vigil?

For me I end up screaming "WHY ARE YOU HERE?!"
---
Sure hope it gets better for you op. Don't let it get to you to the point you don't wanna play anymore. Mute+Report. I don't use voice chat at all after the first two years as people I play with come in different variations and toxicity levels. You got friend to play with? That helps a lot to laugh together. That's what I do. I don't play by myself anymore I have someone with me that can just laugh it off keep the stress down from all this.
---
i’d go for used mouse and keyboard on ebays. I like razer personally. I get $60 keyboards for 15-20 bucks. Building is not difficult at all. After maybe a month of research and youtube, you realize how simple it truly is to put a computer together considering it’s just 8 parts you screw into a case and then wire them all together but they’re all marked and have instructions. You get the freedom of knowing what to put into your computer and it’s cheaper.
---
Exactly! I haven’t had this much fun with team tactics and call outs since Halo 3 MLG days when call outs won you games. Highest I’ve hit 3797 MMR last season. I’d love to hit diamond but a mixture of the DDos/MNK epidemic on console, plus there being legit better players, I’m just going for 4 plat charms for year 4.
---
100* defense
---
I agree, these editions don't look as good as previous ones... However, I will still get them as I have all the previous ones and it will annoy me if by the end I have one missing haha
---
On another note, the best looking Chibi to date is in my opinion Valkyrie!
---
I play a lot of Frost, and I can relate.
---
I’ve never been MLG anything, but halo 3 was an incredibly tactical game if you played it right. Seems like you’ll be able to hit that mark man. My gamer tag is SweatyMonkas. I work a lot, but hit me up if you’d like to squad sometime.
---
Little pricy, but damn i like it.  If she ever makes Warden or Valk ill probably buy one
---
Lord forgive me for what I'm about to do.

Oh. Whatever lol. Does japan have heavy censorship? I dont think it does but I'm not sure. Seeing as attack on titan is Japanese and anything BUT censored lol. I just couldnt remember if it was china or japan who wanted siege censored out the ass.

Sometimes I play good, sometimes I'm a bot. I envy you
---
Thank you. Ive learned so much from my friends and YouTubers. Even watching sweats crap all over me. It was a process
---
Seriously, bro what the fuck is wrong with people
---
In my experience ranked is worse because people are either throwing or don't care.. and they get a bigger reaction out of people and it penalises them more in ranked compared to casual.
---
Tbh it's sad it's, not an issue with the game it's an issue with people.. there's always someone to spoil things
---
Wtf is that edit lmao

Like the first five minutes I got downvoted to hell so I was like fuck it

I think Ubi needs to add some kind of trust score, maybe leaving games, Destroying friendly gadgets, team killing, lowers your score.  Finishing games would increase your score. Also make it so that teammates can vote on your performance, something similar to Reddit's upvote system at the end of a game and also allow you to view all players you've met in the last 2 games and put scores on them.
---
It's rediculous Dark Zero doesn't have one.

Unfortunately I dont think there will be one. T.T This was added onto the end of a chapter I was reading. I think the scanlator group put it there.

You known what? I have to thank the dooo (they you tuber) for recommending the game, I'm truly having a good time with it, check himself out if you can, he plays the guitar like a God
---
Hey, man! Thanks for the good explanation and examples. I play on PC, sadly. It would've been great to play with you though.
---
This will come in handy! Thank you!
---
Is this with the Columbine DLC?
---
As far as chosing a roamer vs and anchor, the first thing to look at is speed. 3 speeds are usually roamers, 2 speeds can go either way depending on what their gadget is, and 1 speeds are anchors most of the time.  
---
The next thing is the gadget. You need to think about how you are going to use the gadget, and if it will help you more onsite or off site. For example, pulse is a roamer. His sensor wont do you as much good close to site because when the enemies are close to the objective, your team will likely know where they are anyways. An example of an anchor would be doc. He is useful to heal teammates, so you should be in a position where you are closer to your teammates to use his gadget more effectively. There are some operators whos gadget you place down in the prep phase, then you dont need to use for the rest of the round. some examples are rook, jager, kapkan, frost, or mute. These can all kind of be used as an anchor or roamer, just keep in mind what speed they are.

if you have any other questions just ask

Thank you! What kind of gadgets? Cameras?

do you see anyone in the camera? i don’t
---
If you kill all 5 it’s an ace, if there’s 4 or less and you kill them all it’s a sweep
---
Did you play with a cheater?
---
On Coastline there is a glitch where you can crawl like a foot of the ground
---
really depends. in the context of video games, many would consider an ace killing the whole team. There is an argument to be made that it means 5 kills though. The origin of the word "ace" being used in a fighting context was in world war two when referring to pilots that had shot down 5 enemy pilots
---
I mean she does put up with 3 idiots

I don’t think so. It could’ve been with friend using macros or something I’m not sure tbh.
---
But he heas the bulletprpof cams, new UI and New Chirstmas skin. But if it is a photoshop it is a damm good one.
---
L
---
If you are playing casual you shouldn't be worried about the tactical usage of an op.
---
The reason this is all is stated is cause it all connects but I don’t wanna have a whole rant, but I appreciate your patience to discuss, I’ll stop I realized that I should quarreled over this unnecessary stuff
---
But I do know that a friend got banned for being toxic behavior if that has to do anything.
---
Well maybe he has an other pc and he didn’t update it. That’s my take
---
What is that aim?
---
No it’s not back, it was only took from the R4C
---
Also my first ever time aiming as a level 111
---
Ahhh okay
---
No.
---
An ace is all 5.
---
4 minute clip for 1 headshot at the end of the clip I’m confused
---
What's going in with the bottom guys neck?? That looks like metal or am I just going insane
---
You gotta work with your aim geez
---
Wait it uploaded the unedited version? Hmm I meant to just have the last part.
---
Happens bro. Feel ya for sure. 
---
Just move on :)
---
Time to delete post
---
it will be more challenging more than Glaz as it;s bolt action, That and Kali will be the first and only DLC operator ever introduced in siege to only have 1 gun on attack.
---
But what if she's just like Glaz and she gets only handguns and not a secondary SMG even then i wouldn't care if they were reused guns because her primary is basically new.
---
Connection didn't stop the headshot from registering because I still got an assist off that. Ubi just doesn't know where the head is located so for some reason it registered as a non headshot even though I clearly missed every shot besides the headshot.
---
You need to pizza more and French fry less
---
Damm bro.
---
So is her weapon the rifle or is it her gadget?
---
Make his LMG mountable on Windows and deployable shields
---
What college
---
Both? Think it will be kind of like buck the gadget is under the gun.
---
Northwest Missouri State
---
Yeah aim and you seem to not check corners or check dangerous angles
---
The gadget is on the rifle (like bucks shotgun). You shoot it into a room and it disables gadgets within a certain area. They kinda work together though. The rifle has crazy wall destruction which leaves wide holes soft walls. After you create the holes, you can shoot the gadget through the holes you made to disable the gadgets inside the room.
---
Honestly exp means nothing in siege people won’t care. But I get where you are coming from.
---
That's what I'm trying to figure out myself tbh, But today we'll maybe be seeing a major leak of her leaked loadout with Wamai or maybe even gameplay footage which will give us more info on if it's her main gun or ability.
---
if it is her primary just like Glaz she'll only get 1 primary weapon and 2 secondaries.
---
You should make a caption of it saying 
---
"DELET THIS"
---
I was actually gold 1 here
---
As per leaks from an image of Harry, there's a design regarding a mobile shield i.e it can be moved .
---
Also in Lords bio, his weapon is addressed as an LMG.
---
So i guess they will rework him by allowing to move behind a shield with peak holes on the top side to shoot through with his LMG
---
you really need to work on aim and checking corners
---
I always play like garbage 😎
---
Legendary rush for sure! The team kill was the best part by far
---
No one knows for sure yet. She is like Buck with an underslung gadget but we don't know if the damage shown off to soft walls is her regular ammo or she is like Zofia and has two types of gadgets.
---
No thanks, I remember Operation Health.
---
Bank, basement defense, last man standing against a f**king clash. Was shocking me to death.
---
Had thrown a Trax in vault lobby outside lockers window. Kept pushing the clash onto the Trax while she shocked, and she eventually died after getting pushed onto 2 trax (had tagged her twice before).
---
Clash can be annoying at times, especially when you aren't Capitão.
---
I mean... if you don’t like toxicity you should probably avoid every competitive game, I’m sure you can Play BOTW or RDR2 without being harassed. Oh and btw, everyone gets harassed it’s not just females. END RANT.
---
I thought it more like hard breacher like hibana but smaller entry hole
---
that sounds like complete hell. Dealing with this toxic community is aids enough but being a chick probs makes it way worse. What region do you play in? AU region is pretty cool imo but seems like other regions are 1000x worse based on the posts I see daily on this sub
---
Barbed wire the operator
---
Then you must’ve remembered the insane amount of bugs before that.
---
This!
---
I was placing a claymore and Kaid shot me dead at the same moment it was deployed. He rush past it to get to objective room then... boom!!!
---
All I have to say to that guy is ew
---
I play apex a lot more and never have a problem. I play a lot of other games as well and it’s NEVER as bad as when I play siege. I never said guys don’t get harassed either, not sure where I said it’s just females. I was saying it for more context because a lot of the comments I** deal with are because I am a girl, and I deal with a lot of sexual harassment. This was a rant on what I was dealing with, I’m not taking away from anybody else, male or female, who has to deal with it.
---
It’s not that bad it’s a basic meme edit just doesn’t flow and has too many different images, jumping from gameplay to images
---
He said fine if this blows up
---
Absolutely insane play, I feel so bad for wildcard tho
---
It's a Hanzo reference
---
&gt;more maturity 
---
&gt;”pC mAsTeR rAcE” crowd
---
Wildcard showing namesake. DZ breaks the QF curse. Good finals 1.5 games in
---
CARALHO BORRACHA É UMA REFERENCIA AO BRASIL??
---
Well you can only be harassed by 2 people on Apex so naturally it’s less, plus it’s a BR so you are playing with people who don’t give a shit. Probably use the mute button or play Apex, the game is just as “toxic” as any other competitive shooter so idk what to tell you. Buy a PS4 and play casual, people won’t have mics to yell at you.
---
Okay thanks :)
---
Haha it it blows up be will be banned for a bit
---
Mute people or find a squad, the truth is that this game solo experience just sucks,  people not using comms, middle eastern stacks E V E R Y game at night that dont speak english and use comms like its their own personal discord, low elo flamers that are too delusional to realize they are the trash too or randoms teams killing you because they didnt get their op , this game is simply **NOT** enjoyable as a solo player, at least noot if you want it to be your main game.
---
I didn’t realize how many people deal with the toxicity till I came here, I see a lotttttt of posts about it. I’m sure guys deal with it just as much, but same of the comments made are just absolutely disgusting and so wrong, just because I’m a female. Is there a way to change regions on the game? I’m from the US
---
Does anyone know how much recent new operators are
---
First look with da mans
---
It's cool, but I think a firefighter skin would fit someone else better
---
Lol thank youuu I thought I was alone on this
---
They have, it’s most likely just the servers running slow
---
um..they are doing that, and if you're not lagging then it's not a ddos
---
Not using your ability, I see
---
I'm pretty sure she remains invisible while planting. A lot of people use to to push in fast, which is a high risk Hugh reward move. But she's especially strong near end of round when enemies are dead and using cams for callouts
---
Yes.
---
Honestly I don’t really look at speed at armor I just adapt with that but I also fine ability/gadget important and I was dissatisfied with warden
---
Bro I’m part of the team at Principia in Illinois we might compete either in spring or next year
---
I never got it from there
---
We don’t know most of the operator’s sexualities, and great because why the hell does it matter?
---
Boom
---
There is literally an entire fucking seperate outbreak game coming out due to the popularity of the outbreak event
---
It's all good. I'm on PS4 so we aren't able to play. Good luck finding team mates
---
He's contemplating using some sort of seduction strategy.
---
ty
---
how?
---
Gotta admit picking Nokk just to leave default cams not destroyed by the end of a round is a 300 IQ play.
---
Same! the music of the main screen stayed with me
---
fr?
---
thank you :]
---
ouch
---
It doesn’t make sense though, which is usually what ubi goes for with the elite skins. Otherwise design is really cool. Not sure why a firefighter would a carry a metal shield but neat.
---
uh oh
---
Who the fuck uses FMG on smoke
---
😂
---
Bro but you shouldn’t be showing up
---
damn did she have a deployable shield before?
---
Assuming the enemy team isn't running valk, maestro, mozzie, or bulletproof cams, or a combination of those things.
---
Yes
---
More importantly, when will I be able to equip recruit chibi ON RECRUIT?
---
What wrap is on the gun?
---
I really like this.
---
U mean on the smg 11?
---
No the Lwhatever

But how long does it burn?

Absolutely nothing, that guy was just salty.
---
I don't know if it actually works or I'm just getting to the point where I'm hallucinating but I turned on the surround sound in the logitech program and it genuinely made the game sound way better in telling which way the sound is comming from. The sound quality is worse then a 100 year old gramophone but still.
---
Thats not how you use that
---
There's just some times where sound really fucks up. I was in the bathroom of Coastline, had just dropped from the roof's hatch, broke the other hatch and was waiting to hear/see someone. Someone was below and behind the hatch and it sounded like someone was on the same floor and right in front of me. It definitely fucks up sometimes.
---
Thanks for my new profile pic
---
Your flair is so idiotic, people use jackal for easy kills yes but when played properly he's a support character, you can't get mad that people use tactics to win in a realistic tactical competitive shooter.
---
Why are my eyes suddenly watery
---
\*we've all been waiting for
---
You know that's right.
---
Hate not being able to tell if someones above or below you on stairs
---
I tried 5$ earphones to 200$ headphones nothing helps as far as it is about directions. Games like PUBG &amp; Insurgency have way better sound system in place.
---
it cost like 750 renown so it’s really bullshit that it’s epic
---
Better yet, don’t play casual. If they gave us this option then literally everybody would have it on and if some asshole decides to leave during your casual match then you won’t ever get anybody to fill in and thus you will always be in a X v 5 situation.
---
DUDE.... Make sledge firefighter
---
The sound system is fine, the people who complain about it just don’t know how to use it.
---
[What the fu-](https://youtu.be/8w0SpnL_Ysg)
---
They’re just mad because you have a better connection than them :P
---
Also counters capitaos bolts and Kalis new gadget.
---
Had the same "problem" dunno why people having issues with that.
---
Just like loch-n-load in TF2. 2 pipes but 3 grenades
---
** through and through
---
If it's her primary weapon, I'm kinda torn on that. She's going to be at a complete disadvantage if she has no full auto gun.
---
I also think her sniper is actually her gadget. Maybe she has two full auto guns, and the 'CSRX 300 Sniper' is her ability. It's not like that would be weird. Zofia's launcher has two different ammo types. So maybe her sniper is also a gadget with a soft-breaching round, and also a hard-breaching round.
---
The scope on it also looks like it's high-powered, so I can already see people getting frustrated by getting one-shotted across a really long distance by her holding a pixel angle. Like from the parking outside Bank that looks into the lobby and second floor.
---
Eh, honestly the only thing I can usually tell reliably is whether it’s on the same floor. If it’s on a different floor it has a shallower sound, I can’t tell above or below just that it’s not my floor.
---
It's based on rarity in this game, not other games?
---
Lesion on attack
---
Yes Nice
---
I feel like there should be another way of stopping the poison because if there isn't a doc your screwed

Not based on rank for sure because I get paired against teams full of platinum 1’s and 2’s daily
---
&gt; ***You fucking sexist or what*** 
---
**wut?**
---
*quite the opposite!*
---
I love that its a female op!
---
^(Time to cut ties with Zofia and get me a new Waifu pillow.)
---
Me too. I'm a little curious as to what secondary options we'll have to compliment it.
---
Lmao I was doing my Thatcher business on Chalet yesterday and I got a C4 to my face. No velcro ripping sound, no static, just blew up right in my face with no indication.
---
Jackal is an ok ban , especially then you want to play someone like cav .
---
I was more confused about why it was named 1. It was kinda confusing and I thought that maybe it was an error on Ubisofts end
---
People ban clash because she is annoying. She might be, but she is really easy to deal with most of the time because most people aren't very good with Clash. Melee her shield and shoot her exposed hand and leg, use zofia concussion grenades and shoot her hands and legs or use a capitao fire bolt. It's dead simple. Some people may not know these things but now you do.
---
Well at least they didn't ban echo.
---
a small price to pay for carry
---
these people didn't 😂😂
---
I mean, the pro league and season reveal is this weekend. Of course it's going to be higher up there then it's normal 20.0kish viewer count.
---
I think that Warden is so broken that gave Nokk a bad rep for osmosis...she's fine ability wise, she needs a buff in the loadout imo.
---
I'm sorry to hear that, no I'm afraid not pal. Just try and enjoy casual regardless of who you get :)
---
Does anyone know why they are only four ops this time ? 
---
I thought Mira was supposed to be the fifth one.
---
Give it 2 Acogs
---
p90 is already amazing,acog, 50 rounds, dropshots are possible due to small hipfire spread etc.
---
Nop enough microtransactions
---
No it’s been in the game for quite a while now, I believe since the charms first entered the game so it’s definitely not an error.
---
Here is an idea on this topic that I have just posted!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dtu896/to_add_more_attachments_to_the_game_they_should/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
If it's only a cosmetic change, I'll be fine with it, but only if it's unlocked for use on all available weapons instead of having to get it on every single gun to use it (like a universal weapon skin).
---
This is the most intentionally vague comment I've ever heard. What is ironed out? What is flawed? 
---
Versus what? What isn't ironed out and not flawed? 
---
I'm giving benefit of the doubt towards random elitism but I'm also genuinely curious as to what your point is here
---
Do you ever just hit echo 73 times with thermite’s tictac launcher and they just slap you in the face with their gay ass cheeks?
---
Why? It is siege themed
---
&gt;it has the worst damage of any gun in the game, only reason you see me do so well is because i head shot everyone
---
So you don't barely see him.. Meaning you see him a lot?
---
Yeah. Well I get a good KDR usually so hopefully it'll go up.
---
give it no recoil
---
I have 7.1 surround sound speakers connected to my audio technica mh50x s and it's still hard to tell sometimes. Like honestly just fix the damn audio.
---
We just reached out to places willing to host a location and just set up an event. Organised some activities, food, and we're ready to go! :)
---
Idk what y'all are talking about, my audio is fine, I was literally able to follow invisible players in the Halloween mode based off the sound of their footsteps.
---
Where's the ACOG?
---
I just want an op that looks like the 2 Armor concept here.
---
If you're in SG, Bountie Arena at one-north.
---
Couldn’t agree more with that one
---
He is there check my profile I just posted a pic with him there
---
IT JUST WORKS! -Todd
---
I know sorry.
---
Ubisoft is bad
---
I have a receipt for that and want to return it
---
*mission failed*
---
I don't get it... what's wrong with it? I didn't observe anything different...
---
:(
---
That’s awesome, wish we had something like that here. Please post the reaction if Aerowolf wins the series btw
---
Wow, thanks!
---
nah dont think so
---
nah
---
You're weird.
---
I didn't say it stacked. But I supposed each bullet procs and resets the timer
---
You can’t get banned for that
---
Rainbow Six Siege Year 4
---
You should realize it's not for everyone the problem is.. many users with different hardware reported sound bugs of the same type. I had so much problem with drone jump sound issue where you jump on drone that sound plays then whole sound gets corrupted or something. Teammates running near you sound far and vice versa gunshots left sounds in right ear .. a lot of shuffles happen till I restart the game. Found a lot of other people with the same issue and it ain't the audio drivers or anything it's Ubisoft .
---
What was worse all being greedy in a 1v4 or someone hitting the Goyo canister that isn’t even in the shooting line.
---
Surround sound headphones are a load of bollocks. Most of them only use audio manipulation, so they're still stereo but now sound dreadful. And the ones with multiple drivers are still functionally the same as stereo because you can't distinguish the difference between drivers 2cm apart. If surround sound was a real thing then why are the best headphones only stereo?
---
I know I spelled wrong "HEALTH", sorry for that. Already corrected in the original file; you can stop reminding me that.
---
That's the point
---
Yeah the ability would need some work in order to be viable
---
The game doesn’t let you party up with people outside of a certain MMR range as you. So if you can play with him, you can’t get banned.
---
aren’t*

Excuse me what does BOSG mean?
---
Pretty sure thats my Xcom 2 character

With this type of question you need to put your server and platform

No, PUBG has the standard player to player sound.

Bad internet or having datacenter issues ? if its datacenter you can try and select one manualy. couldet play for a entire season due to 250+ found out that game had decided to put me on south american datacener dispite me being from scandinavia

hopefully there will be a next time then!

Yes I’ve been screwed by this a few times with ela, so I always make sure there isn’t stupid little things blocking the line of sight

Started playing on PS4 during Red Crow up until Parabellum I think. Then took a break, but I got back into it at around Phantom Sight when I got the game on sale on Steam
---
Or just go back to the original.
---
No problem.
---
Really cool
---
lol
---
I think it's my internet. I'm getting a new supplier soon so that should fix it
---
Siege was designed with stereo sound, so stereo headphones will work the best to convey direction. 5.1 and 7.1 can still be used, but they just don't work as well to convey direction.
---
Sledge and tachanka will be the starters then lol
---
Get a capture card first
---
That's a normal strat though. You prep the window and hold the C4 in your hand, then throw it up high and the only way attackers can counter it is by holding maom stairs or shooting the C4 as it comes out of the window, which is quite easy.
---
bruh Sledges thicc booty in a banana hammock with jiggle physics like that Smoke halloween mask 😤😤☺️  8==👊==D~~~
---
Being good doesn't mean start a channel
---
It may be your headset. I have logitech headset and its 3D sound feature messes up audio cues in Siege. I believe it’s because of sound propagation and multidirectional sound it offers.
---
Got that, thanks
---
Look.
---
Bosg is way more fun, but also a meme weapon and a high risk weapon.
---
The K1A is more effective than the Bosg.

Console has the same hardware and it’s still a problem I don’t think it’s a hardware problem.

Idk it’s just one of my favorite games and I kinda want to put myself out there

She is an essential operator if you are trying to be competitive.

yes, unless youre choosing between her and someone else?

...or try a new sensitivity, but that's basically it.
---
Yes, absuluely. Her guns are fine and her gadget is very useful.
---
ah, how much then?
---
That's an ouch.
---
Just thought you would’ve assumed people would’ve noticed this before.
---
No matter how hard gaming companies push it, it'll never be a real thing.
---
Most of new op have viable gadgets but a bad choice of weapon. Seriously its like Ubi choose all the less loved weapons. Give the Echo mp5 to nokk, the jaeger weapon to Warden, the R4C to Amaru
---
Yeah, just a callback to Outbreak and likely a reference to the game spinoff based around it.
---
Watch YouTube videos on how to play. Or get a friend who's good at the game
---
free? just play and if you find a someone good ask them for some pointers.... or go to Fiver. As Coconut Bruh did and hired a coach for an hour all for $5. also your platform helps people know what u need. Are you PC, Xbox, PS4?

idk, im making a team, Stranded in Space, if you wanna join pepega

There was a sledge pro league set leaked in the beginning of the year

i know i still find it terrifying to see on a normal game mode
---
Adding it to the title no one would click on this post do u see how long the title is??
---
If you are last one in the match, you get a win. Stay at all costs.
---
They become 3 speed when you equip a shield on them
---
You don’t need to sign one
---
The whole point is so that they don't look like they are on the tram.   So that they look like a Carl. Someone who might have been assigned to a team but hasn't exactly earned their spot. Someone who is coming from a field with a special team that still uses alice gear from the 80s.  No participation trophies.   Shoulder pads are for football not high speed operators.
---
I was playing CSGO last night and kept on pressing the lean keys for no reason 😭

Oh no... He’s been playing too much Siege!

i straight up can’t tell if a sound i hear is above me or below me now

Dude. Omg. A couple nights ago, I was searching for my first game of the day (I was at work for half the day). It took nearly 15 minutes before I cancelled the game search, then it took another 10 minutes before I finally found a game. After that game, it took nearly another 20 minutes to find another game. But I didn’t find a game, I just gave up and went to Netflix for the night. I only played one game the other night because of this matchmaking. I’m in New England, US for perspective. I’ve never had to wait that long to find a game. I’ve waited like 10 minutes before, but never a half an hour before finding a game
---
Black Ice themed cake could be pretty cool looking
---
Oh yeah good idea that would be cool
---
then its rather easy to find someone if you just play. again Fiver is an option if u feel u want to spend the money to have a real lesson.
---
they're basically the same tho, plus both were free. it would also be stupid for an operator to have 2 elites when there are still Y1 and base ops who still don't have elites, like Monty, buck, and cap
---
This is t the rework the rework will work like- colored steps depending on how new they can scan 0-15 seconds = 5 scans and so on these will be color coded and have different shapes inside of them for color blind people
---
Yes please
---
He looks really good, nice job
---
their range is garbage tho compared to basically every other gun
---
damn you beat me to it. rip my orange houses
---
Thanks! Just with the game had tattoos :/
---
Yesterday was a small R6S tournament in my university. We were only 4 teams but it was really fun to watch and play.
---
You can really only do this with Arthur sadly Johns hair is to grey but nonetheless this is awesome do more?
---
Just add a new gamemode with the 3 classes that were in the pre-release phase of the game. There is still gameplay footage of them.
---
They are basically the same, but also in an interview, a Ubisoft employee on the siege team didn't deny it was impossible for more than 1 elite skin for an op (granted, given the context he could have been joking)
---
im too tired for this shit, just tell him he mixed up the order of words and leave
---
True, but I actually did this on online since you can't remove your shirt on story. And yup I'm willing to do some more soon!
---
You underestimate my incompetence
---
Nice ! I'll try coming next time

This is hilarious

It's a joke

right they don't wanna believe it and that spamming BOSG ACOG the developers won't add it, They think it's bullshit and got trolled back by ubi

Straight up this is exactly how I wanted recruit to look, kinda like how they were in outbreak

Tbf team comp probably played a part too. You can frag a win when defuser’s fucked, but if your ops don’t mesh then rip. That being said, that’s sucks bro. I’d be pissed if that were me

I thought for a while I was complaining about the sound being broken because I heard little to no complaints about it from the community. Now I'm glad people are talking about it so hopefully it gets fixed soon. Around or slightly after the Australian ops came out the sound became so bad to where I literally had a Gridlock, 3 armor, sneak up on me. 
---
Sound also propagates so weirdly that sometimes you hear things on the opposite side and it gets you killed. 
---
Also on Xbox I have the most ridiculous sound bug that makes it so you only hear sounds on your extreme right or extreme left and it's game breaking. You know you've been affected by it when the ending screen is the winning players names being displayed at the bottom of the screen but not where they stand when the game ends. Its hard to explain but this has happened several times to me but fortunately not in ranked.
---
Calm down edglord 3000.
---
They are easy to kill if you know what you're doing. They are also easy to use if you know what you're doing.
---
No, someone else on here posted this and gave him the information on where it's located (Xbox)
---
The problem for me is that I don't know if the enemy is above or on my level. I hear them over me but they are on my level and I get killed because I focus on the ceiling. Happend so many times 🙃
---
This is the BOSG new sight 😒
---
I liked the look of the ops in the Article 5 cinematics
---
You realise whoever kills the person that weapon will show right? Kali (The new attacker) Shot the maestro but she downed him and then vigil shot maestro with the bosg so the bosg icon showed because vigil killed maestro and yeah I don't spam bosg acog because bikini and his fanbase are clowns so yeah don't pull words out of your ass please.
---
Gottem
---
I know this isn't the best place to ask but how to I ass a operator main to my name?
---
I love square numbers

Same bro Lmfaoooo
---
Fortnite is no more 😎
---
It's clear what the problem is. You are rushing to be the first to pull the trigger that you have didn't actually aim properly. That's a bad habit that you need to get rid of.
---
This is actually really nice and I also think it's time to change the recruit looks to something that fits more like these.

Idfk i've bough this camo about 3 seasons ago and it was 12k. I think you mean 7.5k because there isn't a single thing in this game worth less than 1k renown
---
Deaf player here too, and since phantom sight, sound has been super bad for people with hearing impairments and/or bad directional hearing. Trust me, it isn't just "well you can't hear, so of course sound won't work well for you"

Yes. It doesn't matter if they see your laser. You have a shotgun and playing short angles. You have the upper hand.
---
Right?? Holy abandons batman
---
The guy that leaked the ops is right, bolt action rifle, the defender has an ACOG, and he is the jaehet alternative, if he was right abo7t all 9f these why would he be wrong and ubusoft makes an op that makes shotgun size holes from quite a lot of distance and cannot be countered by bandit. Seems a bit OP doesn't it?
---
Being a detriment to the team is kind of recruit's purpose. He was made for a time when there were only 10 ops on one side, and ops weren't as cheap. There was a chance of your only ops being taken, and that is what recruit is for. Now all vanilla ops are dirt cheap, and prices are being lowered on DLC. You will always bring more value to the team bringing any real operator over recruit. Recruit doesn't have wall denial, area denial, information, and even roaming is outclassed by cav/vigil. Weapons are outclassed by attachments on real ops. I honestly wouldn't mind if they removed him from the game, because picking him is and always will be a throw

I'm gonna go and say this right now. That is ont a picture of someone in the Jeager corp (jægerkorpset) it is as matter of fact a picture of someone in the frogman corps (frømandskorpset) witch is an navy based special operations unit. The jeager corp just locks like basic solider duds. So I get what they were going for, but it's just fucking wrong.

Who fucking cares? Black ice is already overrated as is, and it sure as hell isn't a "rare" thing in levels above 90.

FACTS
---
This is beautiful, eSports are becoming more and more mainstream every day :)
---
Your job is to kill off the roamers like vigil and cav.
---
So try going from the highest or lowest floor and make your way trough
---
Yeah, this is what was touted early on, but tbh its kinda bullshit at this point becasue we have some ridiculous skins and head gear which just completely fucks "the silhouette". At the end of the day, you look down range and if you see an enemy, you shoot.
---
Cute
---
Ubi would probably just let the player choose 1 attacker and 1 defender
---
So basically the attacker is like Glaz meaning she has no other primary option? So she has no assault rifle to choose from is that what you mean?
---
And what I meant was for example if you gave an ACOG to Warden for his MPX it means that Valkyrie would get one and she's a strong operator already and it wouldn't happen.
---
From the gadget trailer it looks like the bullets have increased soft wall damage but aren’t explosive. At least I hope
---
He hates this game with a passion that is hard to fathom unless you've been there, and yet can't quit even if he wanted to.
---
Wow i just playing mm i hear enemies behind me but when i turn back they were above me and they kill me through small hole
---
I want them so bad.
---
I don't think ubi knows what goldmine they would open there.
---
Is that Cindy Crawfish??
---
Warden is a 2 - 2 now they changed him.
---
I would love to know what world you live in where the master key kills people.

I like the smh with holo and flash hider, LOVE the suppressed 5.7 and claymore to cover her back, breach charges kind of good against her whole ability, giving away your position

Hello WhosThereYT, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dtzn3e/hope_you_guys_enjoy/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah they said when phantom sight went live when Nokk and Warden shared other CTU's guns, IQ isn't a broken operator so she's not losing it at all, The person is misinformed and likely means he's a 1 speed, 3 armor with an ACOG.
---
for example Ash lost hers to reduce her pick rate and IQ is nowhere near like Ash.
---
The AUG killfeed icon could be a placeholder from an internal test build. Probably the best way to confirm if this is true or not is to compare the reflex ADS profile of both guns. I've heard the def is 3 armor so him having an ACOG with it may be a reality.
---
Its not for the bosg, its the sniper.
---
The only appropriate response
---
Right!? Fucking Mozzie, Warden and Goyo running around with their manginas. 
---
bUt ThErE aRe ToO MaNy FeMaLeS
---
Exactly but maybe an explanation is iq losing the aug in general? That might happen but I don’t think it will
---
I need a elite recriut
---
These clowns thinking that’s the bosg acog 🤡
---
It was a excuse because they are lazy
---
you mean for a different gun? No they wouldn't do that to IQ, There's talks of Nokk possibly getting a loadout change to make her better but not to IQ. 
---
Just like Twitch and Thatcher IQ is very important and she's by no means overpowered unless I'm wrong because i don't play as her.
---
Also 1 health left lol
---
His mom, I thought it was his sister. 
---
Oh wait they’re  the same person. Go Alabama.
---
Wdym?
---
i don’t think so, if everyone had one free operator even newcomers were strong, they need to make experience with the game so that they get the operators as a reward for their work and i don’t think ubi will remove recruits even because they won’t get the cash
---
Neither do I I’m just saying a minor possibility we need to consider.
---
&gt;we have some ridiculous skins and head gear
---
Which are *bad* yes.  Them existing doesn't magically make them good game design lol.
---
Peace was never an option
---
Master key?
---
I'm so glad to see other people not immediately scanning. Teammates yelled at me one time for not using my ability. I told them to hush and watch, which didnt matter to them.  But it's super useful for either sneaking up yourself or telling a teammate where you see lots of recent activity!

it’s because everyone either does pvp or pave offline because pve online has that matchmaking issues and it’s just less terrorists to kill /person

If you play PC, do any of the stat tracking softwares like the ones KG or Pengu use track your KOST or do I need to continue to hand calculate it? I’m moving over from PS to PC and was just curious if those things would help me out.
---
Yeee nomad ak gang
---
Yes, yes he is
---
i agree except for the drone thing because it seems super unnecessary
---
Ok ty
---
we should get Alpha Packs, IRL
---
She be on dat Sarah's discovery shit
---
It is preference. if aliens came to earth and saw us watching cars turning left for 500 miles, they’d have some questions about what it takes to entertain our race and our intellect.
---
Glaz have dmr actually, not sniper. With his fire rate and damage we can say its a dmr. New op will be our first sniper.
---
Me too It would be like a better Luci O’s
---
Mark spoiler
---
when i download it it was in high 90s and i said near 100gb game and that isnt the issue anyway lmao. how would this be a ubisoft issue tho? you dont even need uplay to run the game
---
Mr. Pescado's about to kick some ass
---
Join the R6 reddit discord and you can find people pretty quick.
---
Its not a toaster.
---
GTX 960m 2 gb
---
I7 4720HQ
---
8 gb ram
---
Can play every AAA title on medium settings, and Siege on very high settings. Its dated, but not exactly a toaster.
---
Looks like reskinned ying, ash, and rook
---
I mean just because it's semi auto doesn't make it a dmr. I see your point that it's very close to other weapons in that catagory, but glaz's sniper still has specific interactions with damage/destruction etc.
---
You shouldnt have been fucking stupid then. They didnt make you do that, you did it yourself. Imagine being that dense
---
Yup, you're right
---
Wow relax you fucktard
---
Ah, yes, you're correct. The points add up for an assist.
---
Pretty good idea
---
Quit being retarded dumbass
---
Thanks
---
I'm not leveled, I am the level itself.
---
That is such a good idea
---
Rocket League, Overwatch, and many more do it. Go look at the Overwatch main subreddit, it's pure highlights of casual games repeated over and over again. Then go to CompetitiveOverwatch and you have all the info of the competitive scene.
---
Damn, I'm 214. Got maybe 6ish black ice skins. Every gun, primary and secondary, on ash so im happy. Thats some bad luck. I think i was around 100 when they started the alpha packs too
---
No. It should go off xp. Unless you got alpha packs for previous levels. As a level 300 it can take me more than a week to level up while playing a decent amount.
---
I don't think it's a goodidew to take out cams.
---
Plan a route that will keep you away frkm latge cam sight lines. They could get suspicious when they see a cam was destroyed.
---
it should be around 70gb
---
and you do NEED uplay to run it...all steam does is open up uplay
---
Agreed, also what my source told me is that that is IQ's AUG, but with no ability to attach  ACOG
---
I’m pretty sure it’s Ubisoft’s
---
It’s not like that at all, mnk and dosing is much rarer than people would have you believe, a lot of it is just complaining when they lose.
---
A famous french youtuber told me that he played the new operation, he saw the elite and it's not her. Maybe Capitao.
---
It makes me sad because I really want them to make Cav official. I love the leak
---
YES. I. LIKE.
---
can you do it for me and send me the money?
---
Out of everything listed, I’m most excited for Mute PL skin. He hasn’t had any cosmetics in a long time, and he’s been getting shafted in terms of cosmetics. Which is weird, because he’s a pretty popular operator, and I remember seeing someone say they give skins to popular ops. Oh well, seems like Y5S1 will be good.
---
TheRussianBadger, gives good explainations on operators and good gameplay
---
Not on console it doesn’t. It runs at half what MP is. If OP is at 40 compared to other pc players then they are gonna get gunned every time. If OP is on console then they will be at a slight disadvantage since they’ll be playing thunt graphics
---
i hate to see the resolution of this photo
---
Most of the big changes were never given a season and are probably not S1...
---
Pretty sure that's the lighting
---
https://support.ubi.com/en-US
---
I guess sometimes I just feel like target practice with chilling listening to music, and don't like how solo gives me almost zero renown.
---
I’ve tried that. That’s how I know it got deleted, support said there was no uplay account with my address
---
Y5S1
---
This sub is fucking cancer. Im outta here.
---
Just a friendly tip, your mouse sensitivity is WAY too high. That jittery motion of your crosshair says it all.
---
But it's not a famas, it's a second generation of it. I'm pretty sure the real version of it is called the f2
---
EDIT: nope, i was wrong. the second gen famas is the g2. Siege uses the first generation model, my bad
---
Iceycat. Does in-depth videos on the operators and definitely helped me out
---
I'll take a look and change it later. Thanks for the tip 😁😄
---
then there probably isn't, meaning you probably messed up typing your email
---
Well the operator idea doesnt fit in a tactical shooter, its suposed to reward game sence and reflexes, not looking trough a bulletproof One eay mirror
---
You're welcome! Do you know off the top of your head what sensitivity and what mouse DPI you're using?
---
I got the confirmation email after making the account. I didn’t misstype it.
---
Gregor, operator how-to’s are easy to grasp and entertaining. Macey jay for the highlights
---
Its.not His idea
---
What's a girlfriend
---
Guess I’m waking up early and watching the reveal followed by the grand final in bed with coffee.
---
Have an internal source, tachanka will not be recieving an elite due to his upcoming rework and castle was considered but due to the fact the devs are not currently satisfied with him they will be postponing his elite.
---
Neither are you
---
You can do it with cheat engine when BattlEye is not running.
---
A new set of Team skins with 16 teams included
---
Would recommend also. Super entertaining as well.
---
What am I looking at
---
"LET ME ACE"
---
"LET ME AAAAAAAACCCCCEEEEE"
---
No, let the recruit the way he is. He looks perfectly fine.
---
I'm thinking it's 3200, if what I can remember reading on the manual
---
On console thunt runs at 70 or more. On pc most people get at least 80 in normal game so yes OP is getting screwed.
---
Yes brand new with 16 teams included.
---
What do I get out of it?
---
I feel like VarsityGaming is the best one to start out with. Watch his Siege School videos and his Solo smurf series
---
And sensitivity is around 45/50 in game
---
If you play R6S for the weapons, go play COD. Way more weapons there for you to drool over.
---
"Breath vs. Breathe. Breathe is a verb we use for the process of inhaling and exhaling. Breath is a noun that refers to a full cycle of breathing. It can also refer to the air that is inhaled or exhaled."
---
160 with black ive for fmg7 and pmm
---
Id love to see bucks guns without the skeleton key or blackbeard's without the shield..
---
Or even nomad's without airjab launcher, now that i think about it
---
Well idk how that is possible when the Xbox is maxed out at 60fps.
---
Hahaha what
---
There's a song called "just like that" by Afro Musique but I don't know if its the one that I've already wrote
---
How is this self promotion?
---
The account is lvl 9 and I doubt anyone would take the time to edit the picture
---
Anyone over level 200: "say sike right now"
---
so remake it?
---
And Fuze
---
Nah the Indian operator has a sniper with an underbarrel grenade launcher
---
Did that. It ‘can’t verify ownership’ of my siege key.
---
F
---
The C75 is super easy to control compared to the other machine pistols
---
That worked. Thanks!

That's the smartest thing I've seen all week.
---
Extra chibi
---
Maybe communicate with your team?
---
I'm not sure I get what you mean, realistically it is smart to hold a defuser. 
---
It's not a flaw?
---
wow
---
I don’t have the required mental capacity to understand this
---
You should get one every fucking level with the amount of repeats it gives
---
C75a recoil = ez
---
C75a sights = hard
---
It feels like I'm aiming down a brick
---
Well if you don’t want to play support then just play a fragger. As long as you have fun it’s whatever.
---
Well considering they have an Xbox, if they would’ve just used that money they would’ve been more than halfway there lmao.
---
113 and black ice only on 5.7 USG 
---
Your lack of kill points bugs me
---
Guys wtf are you calling it fake when it literally says "concept" in the title lmao
---
kool aid man? isnt that just sledge
---
yea tru
---
I'm pretty sure everyone gets a free black ice dude. Same thing happens to me and my 2 brothers.
---
I personally enjoy watching VarsityGaming to learn and Narcoleptic Nugget and Meaty Marley/Dom for entertainment.
---
Can I have some too?
---
Levels mean nothing, so this would give people the motivation to actually level up.
---
Yeah I agree. Or else the leveling system is irrelevant.
---
The spread of the bullets hit Montie’s left arm.
---
Rainbow6 on twitch
---
Fuck you nigga
---
Marley gets on my nerves
---
there is no ray tracing
---
every 5 wins it should be. im lvl 230 or something leveling is almost impossible
---
Komora wasn't certain but she did think he was a 1 speed.
---
🤔 wrong subreddit 🤔
---
New meta
---
I suspected a much. Set that to 400 or 800. You can get away with 1600, but the sensor starts to lose precision (movement is smoothed out).
---
In-game, 45 is mega, mega high. You'll rarely see competitive players going above 14 @ 400 DPI, the upper limit is usually considered to be around 12. And of course if you choose 800 DPI, you should cut those numbers in half.
---
I used to play a mega high sensitivity, I remember when even 12 @ 400 felt really slow... but trust me, you'll get used to it, and you'll be better off.
---
Also, set your Aim Down Sights sensitivity to 83, if you want it to be the same as your hipfire sensitivity. This will make Holo/Reflex/Red dot match with hipfire. This one is personal preference though, many people prefer between 40 and 70.
---
I don’t understand
---
Yeah I noticed too late lmao
---
Probably because he called it a leak first.
---
Yeah I run into them all the time
---
What rank?
---
while you were on the account ubisoft said that account didn't exists? wtf lol idk wtf happened to you
---
im tryna get back to gold rn im silver 5 bc me nd friends played and dropped to mess around
---
No, I remade the account after support told me there wasn’t one with that email address.
---
imo it should be, It's fucking annoying for like the 1 or 2 thunt online I do I have to encounter the shitty afk bots.
---
Not surprised it's a Blitz main
---
Ah I don’t think I can play with you cause of the mmr threshold
---
Darude- Sandstorm
---
ur probably not that bad its jus ppl wit girls jus fuck wit them alot🤣😂
---
Yeah. Or like a few r6 credits
---
kek
---
i hate that shit
---
The only thing that bugs me is the 'mateeeeee'. But I love his edits.
---
Rip
---
You are hilarious, beautiful soul
---
to learn the maps look at them online. start with the newcomer playlist
---
Every Tuesday ESL does the vanilla cup which gets around 60 or so teams (as far as I can remember) my xbox team still plays it but I left them because pc
---
fuuck yeah they do
---
Thanks, bruh, sometimes people don’t understand the struggles of the cosplaying world.
---
No one forced you to click lmao
---
That’s so sick
---
Try playing with a larger sqaud because then you have more coordination with your sqaud which really helps
---
Yeah, they think it's easy, but look at you! I bet it took you over 100 hours
---
Mabey give a 5 min ban. if you rage quit you can't play for 5 mins and join a new match
---
I’ll forgive you ... for now ... wanna know where the airjab at?
---
And every level you go through you get 100 credits
---
So... you’re a cunt. Do it in casual next time, I would’ve lost my shit if I was the guy you TK’d. His rank is getting affected because of you.
---
*RANK 12 OF ALL YOUR FRIENDS*
---
She’s the artist herself. Also created all the lovely chibi user flairs we have.
---
Twitch hardly got nerfed she is still strong in straight gun fights.. operators that were nerfed hard are blackbeard ela lion and glaz

Just this photo made me fail NNN
---
I don't play Warden much, he does seem like a useful operator though I didn't know about the standing still aspect. I like your ideas, they seem like they could balance out Warden and raise his pick rate to counter Glaz more
---
Sometimes I find that going a route attackers don’t expect, some risky ones too work, especially if ur team can distract with a big gunfight
---
If I remember correctly wardens concept was to counter a very OP blitz and Ying with the anti-glaz also worked in there but they nerfed all the mentioned characters when warden came out anyway pretty much rendering his gadget useless from the get go
---
For context, I decided to shoot a post right after getting spotted because I knew I was gonna die and wanted a quick 10 points. Dude tried to tk me next round and I put a few slug rounds in him
---
Alright! Sounds good
---
In my opinion some characters should never have a face reveal.
---
absolutely, it should be change
---
You should get one every level like in overwatch
---
Yeah it still works. But I don't think it will start a round until all 5 slots are filled.
---
Bruh
---
Please uninstall reddit sir
---
Oh, look at the feed
---
yeah, that would be really interesting. it would also be cool to see 5 recruits wielding alibi and maestros shotgun, or even maetro’s lmg
---
Oof so he’s not getting a shot gun and if he does get aug mp5k kinda useless that’s not very good balancing
---
Sledge?
---
IMO it wouldnt be that bad. Maybe at first thered be some toxicity like that but people stick with siege for the operator interaction. If you just want fast gunplay theres other games that are better for that. Allowing recruit to be a viable option would be really cool long term though. 
---
Say you have a strat that only needs 4 gadgets to work. Set your 5th to recruit and now you're tactically choosing to bring, say, barbs and a C4 instead of a proper gadget. I think that added layer of gameplay would at the very least not be harmful.
---
This says I can say that 
---
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
---
big facts but it would still be cool to see his face
---
His guns are fine lol. The issue IS the ability. Point blank period.
---
I. Can’t. Wait. For. The. Weapon. Post. On. This. Subreddit.
---
Sry liberal but im british and here that may count as hate speach
---
My friend got all Black Ices in like a year. I'm playing since Velvet Shell and got like 3 of them.
---
i would definitely buy that if its the elite
---
Yeah I mentioned that in my next comment. But with sledge your weapon isn’t useable for second or so after you breach the wall. 
---
I’m imagining this new op being able to full sprint through the wall, hardly slowing down. With sledge you have to crouch if you want to get through a wall without jumping.
---
they dont
---
Nice wall bang but those are some dumb plats you’re playin against lmao. GJ amigo
---
No, I think it’s unbelievable.
---
If you want room names, just go around in a custom game and look at the compass, but remember that simple descriptions of the rooms are probably better, like most people know what I mean or have an idea of what I mean  when I say “cav in green room” on new canal. Some times just a short discription os better than the actual room name.
---
"IQ's AUG (No ACOG tho)"
---
... so maybe it's Kaid's AUG and they couldn't tell? They said they can't do different attachments for different operators on the same gun. Can they now??? Tachanka ACOG incoming?
---
Or a proper smoke face reveal. His elite was as close as they'll ever get IMO.
---
this is how he was meant to be played from conception.
---
his weapons are great
---
But then there wouldn’t get said benefits - you haven’t read what’s cool about giant teams like Bama is that when you can’t fight, can’t put that voodoo on us!
---
Right. If the ability was the issue then he wouldn't be the only 3 armor without a way too see far.
---
No worries. There can't be "hate speech" when I have freedom of speech. That's just how it goes. And I'm not liberal
---
No problem. The 1050ti will run it just fine, we have another pc with a 1030 and it can run siege so you shouldn’t have any issues.
---
That is true
---
Agreed.
---
