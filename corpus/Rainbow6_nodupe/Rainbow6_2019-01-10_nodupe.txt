Thank you

You can get kicked for killing teammates too, yet people very rarely, if hardly ever run into someone’s fire to try and get them kicked.

---
Of course the solution isn’t going to be 100% perfect, but it’s a lot better than what we have now. I think many people would agree.

Well I’m glad it worked for you. I just kept trying it and eventually it did end up working for me.

indeed

Very Well Done, Great Job!

Her secondary smg got nerfed but thats about it. Its still usable up close too anyways.

Not really, a fuze charge is 3 projectiles, so just try to cover two fuzes
---
This is specifically against the rules as you included the persons gamer tag which is considered witch hunting and not allowed. 
---
Video or it didnt happen...
---
Special controllers or M&amp;K
---
Judging from his reaction in chat, I don't think he realized he was tricked like that and just thought Alibi came from nowhere because after the killcam he was like "WTF?"
---
Scuff controllers
---
literally unplayable

I’ve spent around $200 on siege. And I’ve played about 1000 hours. Pennies per hour

Were you recording your screen with your smartphone?

There is a built-in function on your console to record and post this kind of thing.
---
Its a conspiracy man.....
---
Both of them sound cool but I would like to see some more guns instead of reusing some(maybe full H&amp;K guns?) and a rifle on defense isn’t such a good idea, also showing the numbers of the microphones through the walls to remember which is which and where they are
---
My thoughts precisely. This is what it must have looked like at Ubi's morning dev report.

As a Jäger main level 130, I can think of maybe twice ever a Fuze has shot 2 charges into the room if he knew my Magpie was there. Also Fuze has 4 projectiles, but magpies can block 3 each.

Iq is also holding a ash’s pistol. And on the rainbow six website where you go for the go4r6 Montaigne is holding an m870

Yes. It was removed from matchmaking

You're late buddy. Been that way since at least parabellum

Why is what happening?

How about this. Clearance lvl 50+ AND you have to win 30 matches, or play at least 100. The 50+ I get, but idk about the 30 and 100. What does everyone think about that.
---
C4 should only kill shields if they land behind. That's part of the reason they have shields in the game. Not just to block bullets and clap your cheeks with metal slabs.
---
tbf some of the challenges were such a pain like play x operator for 10 rounds, you would see that operator in every single game that week. 
---
If they could make them interesting and not like that it would be cool.
---
Yes it did
---
*ALLAH IS GOD*
---
Thanks, kinda disappointed tho
---
All those kids are probably better than you. Get carried, old man.
---
In a game where sound is such a key component I would say removing the sound of an OP would be of equal power to an op being able to spoof a sound in the other direction. 10 vs. -10
---
&gt; I hate how deadly accurate it is at long ranges.
---
When is the last time you played? They nerfed the smg 11 hard 
---
Mean while im on the otherside of the map being the big drone i am
---
Damn looks good. I recently got a Jäger uniform I've never seen before. Faded leather I think? Goes great with the Halloween headgear.
---
I thought the same thing, It may not be the best and it definitely had a troubled past but it’s our standard issue and many brits love the gun despite its issues. I guess it’s iconic to us.
---
Her hologram is a scam.
---
I believe the pump is slightly faster with a grip. And the square where your pellets go are smaller as well.
---
Big Fucking Hole;
---
Get a kill with Thermites Exo-thermic charge 
---
Still don't agree, caveira makes herself less noisy but still audible, it has you on your toes when entering the building, but with adding sounds that otherwise just wouldn't be there at all, you start to wonder if every sound you hear is real or not. I feel like a decoy granade/sounds granade would be more balanced.
---
Hah
---
What platform do you play on?

Is that firefly's crybaby

You can still play on custom games but where is the fun in that, also I’ve seen people recently asking for it to be returned for casual play as favela returned but as for now it’s not

Just did some research, found a steam forum where people talked about how the steam version isnt tied to uplay and that its a common issue where uplay doesnt register it under the accounts library is bought from steam. So im going to clear the cache, redownload the game and uplay and hope it works. 
---
It is!

Try to get people that will play with you and 5 stack with them
---
I've been downvoted this many times before, but hold crouch can give the same results.

You might be offline cause it does that when offline and only glitches for like 30 minutes but it shouldn’t be permanent
---
"On ping"
---
"In the room"
---
"Outside"
---
"In the hallway"
---
The list goes on...
---
It was very unbalanced. Even for casual.
---
Before Chimera actually.
---
Yep, which is why communication and coordination is so important in the game. Ying's Candelas blind allies as well as enemies, so coordinated use is a huge advantage.
---
His device is definitely a two edged sword.
---
Nah. All ghe kids would just say they are 18+
---
If you’re with an entire group of people that are team killing you just leave the match, they’re not going to let you play. If it’s just 1 guy and he kills you, either ignore him or go ahead and kill him back, if he kills you again he gets banned. 
---
There’s honestly not much you can do about it in this game. You can report for toxic behavior but it does nothing. If you’re playing with a good group then they’ll kick team killers.  
---
I AM HERE!
---
NEU region......
---
Bro it's there for a reason. I don't spawn peek but I will admit it adds a whole nother level of map knowledge. From uncommon areas to runout, to the most common ways to spawn peek. Not only does it make your reaction faster as an attacker but helps you react quicker as a defender as well.

I hate to break it to you, but I don’t think anything will be added to Siege that’ll 100% stop toxicity anytime soon. It’s been 3 years, almost 4, and everything Ubisoft’s tried hasn’t worked or has made the game worse
---
Because it's literally the only map I play. I don't want to play that map 24/7. The chances are obviously up'd for that map and it's annoying af. I don't mind playing that map every once in a while but if I don't get to play any other map it gets annoying.

Well then its a good thing its only asking you to get 5 over a whole match, not a single round
---
Ree
---
Big oof right there 
---
Yea, I can easily think of some more interesting and actually somewhat challenging challenges. Perhaps they could award renown? For example: Win a round with glaz without using the thermal scope.
---
You can toggle game modes on and off for T Hunt iirc
---
We need one beefy female operator, fat women are under represented in this game dammit!!! Shame ubi SHAME. For projecting unrealistic body types on our young impressionable minds. While we are on the subject there is not one openly gay or transgender on this roster! Its 2019 these things arent supposed to happen anymore!
---
Season passes never go one sale. Each time you buy a season pass your alpha pack chances build up faster by 0.30% each season. You also don’t have to waste renown on new ops and play early. 
---
Hahaha thats my close friend and I didn’t want Monty to get the kill, wouldn’t have done it to a stranger 
---
Well yes of course, but I mean at least drop the damage by 10 and put a little less recoil on her.
---
I don’t remember the patch notes saying it was fixed, it said that they know the issue.
---
Then again I could be wrong.
---
Decent? She's terrible. If her recoil wasn't trash I'd play her. That's really the main reason here
---
oof
---
Why do all achievements involving hammers have an MC Hammer reference?
---
I'm mainly focused on the recoil. Right now, the pattern goes left and right. It's more manageable, but it's still trash. 
---
Thank you! I just started playing after months of not having it downloaded and haven’t checked the sensitivity and you’re so right, thanks for the heads up 
---
Thank you for sharing this u/GoodNightG5.
---
You must play on console Ela is fine on pc so maybe it’s worst there
---
Burst fire at long range, or else work on getting into better positions for close range engagements. A huge part of this game is positioning, half the time if you die its because of this, not because the gun sucked
---
Damn that hurts lol. But true
---
But it's such a pointless feature. Also any skin u buy or get is p2l
---
Hey, I’m still in high school and get the reference, which either means you’re relatively young, or I just know too many obscure references.
---
Don’t feed the troll, just report and move on guys
---
i have a 1.92 KDA with her, 62% win ratio and a high HS rate. i dont know what you are talking about.
---
Absolutely 
---
I've never tried that. Im trying that as we speak
---
Had to 
---
I'm a console player so yeah 
---
No bc sometimes I feel the gun looks better in stock not to mention that’s toxic and a douche move 
---
Got me wondering, why does siege not have any achievements? There's sooo much potential

Yea I took a losing streak from gold 2 and now I’m just stuck down here in gold 4

ugh i was new to the game and I reinforced kids bedroom and this guy just shot me in the back of the head...

His shotgun is actually really good too, if overshadowed by the t5. It has a really tight spread pattern and a fast reload too compared to most of the shotguns in game. 
---
I believe 'Shrike' could go without the claymore.

Doc is invulnerable for a half second when he gets downed, otherwise his stim pistol would be useless on himself. Take that into account with Glaz's rifle having hit reg issues and you get your clip.

I guess it wouldn't suck so much if they made a part three but....you know...Valve :(

If you're a cav main, jackal would be an interesting one for you!

Thank you again! I have reported the hacker... Waiting for Ubi's answer :)
---
Poor laid!Their ruining the house!!!
---
Or just... let people play until they learn
---
I'm very fucking glad the Jager one isn't real. 
---
Lasers are more viable than you may realize, people just need to learn to be aware of where they are pointing them better...
---
And it's never ok to teamkill someone unless they are directly causing you problems like trying to tk you....
---
Too bad it'll likely never happen outside of vr, because that's what valve is mainly working with now.
---
I cant even get the current one of a kill with the regular breaching charge. This would be even more impossible XD

Just drop it

I'm more a "keep hitting the other team from all angles before they hiy obj." kinda guy. Instead of hiding and sneaking around I lurk and constantly get up in their faces. It's hard for me to keep track of every enemy when it's that spread out. Although it has helped me practice staying put on defense
---
I hope you enjoy situps OP
---
Try and isolate an angle.
---
There's only so many ways to get to site
---
Hi {-}7
---
That's unfortunate. I think it would make things so much better
---
That is true
---
Or the German KSK
---
I'll paraphrase a bit here but he was saying that there should be a smart pistol in siege and that it could be balanced, that pistol isn't even balanced in Titanfall.
---
Than lesion, from what offensive ops you have, your style should be fufilled quite nicely, Lesions gun is pretty high calibur and hreat to use, and he can fill both roles of defense.
---
for God sake. Give his blitz an acog!
---
I got it, it's gross haha

Native KBM support is disabled for Rainbow Six Siege on console. There is nothing further that can be done on our end. Thanks for the report!

On console the native k&amp;m support is only supported if the devs want it, they cant code the game to not allow the users to have native k&amp;b support in their games.

Huh? Who created you and why?

When you get spawnpeeked, remember where you got spawnpeeked from. Next time you spawn in that location, preaim or even prefire the window/door. Spawnpeeking only really works when you let it catch you off guard. The solution is to always be on guard.
---
he was OK with me posting it
---
getting them to agree is one thing lol
---
Play rank late at night during weekdays, and avoid weekends. It essentially steers you clear of the kids.
---
cant help it, might as well endorse it
---
Maverick
---
I like this idea! Not just fixing the problem that roamer don't reinforce but also fix the problem when someone on the team left but we still have all this reinforcement.
---
But if this exists reinforcement animation need to speed up a bit for all reinforcement to be set up before the action phase. (and Recruit will have only 1 reinforcement. How will they deal with this?)
---
ayy lmao
---
Well, no. Purpose of ranked is matching you with people of your level. The climbing thing is a misconception about ranked that cause cheating, smurfing and looks enjoyment of match just because you lose.

Mnk are not the problem when is ubisoft gonna clean up all the people using headphones! I am sick and tired of everyone being able to hear me super sonically!

Platform 9 and 3/4: Siege Edition

I didn't know that was a weapon skin till now. I want.

I wasn’t really talking about profanity nobody actually cares about that I was talking about gettin perma banned after getting banned repeatedly and still doing the same shit

Now I’m concerned you don’t know what trolling is either. It’s been a week and you haven’t came up with a single example of anything to support your statement.  You just keep dodging the question. 
---
game need to be fixed. thats the reality. but ubi is uunable to do it without somebody complaining (80% of the comunity), so... 
---
You will get a code and t-shirt at the event.
---
Operator specific achievements will definitely push for more season pass sales 
---
I miss the menus not being black like they are now. When the background of each menu section was a different picture. Now it's all just black. And that horrible eye-burning white for the skin inspect screen.

What's your playstyle, or what playstyle do you want to adopt?
---
You play squad or solo?
---
Ahha yeah that was sort of the point, I've been wanting to do solo realistic. What tips would u give? 
---
He should at least conceal the name
---
Spawnpeeking wasn't, isn't and will NEVER be a problem for anybody who's worth their elo. No person in a sane state of mind has complained about spawnpeeking because everybody knows spawnpeeking is free kills for attackers. And if you are wasting 30 seconds on dealing with free sitting ducks, then you really need to rethink your push strategy.
---
My PC account is lvl 90 and I have 5 black ice skins.
---
My PS4 is over lvl 180 and I have like 4 to 5 black ice skins.
---
Exactly.
---
Hence, no dogs.
---
Also, children! Damn, homie, you need to calm down.
---
Both are disastrous enough.
---
I know they don’t look the same whatsoever, you fucking retard. I was just stating that, since Dokkaebi has not really defined lineaments (even tho she’s supposedly Korean), it’s easy for many girls (not all obviously) to look like her by just putting on a beanie. Just like it’s easy for many white bald people (not all obviously) to look like Pulse by just putting on sunglasses and a bulletproof jacket. And so on for all the ops.
---
Go fuck yourself. I knew somebody would come here, triggered, thinking he’s the only one knowing Japanese people have different lineaments than Korean or Chinese people. Seriously, go fuck yourself, mister ”I think I’m smart. and angry and can't have a discussion without using the word ”fuck” every two seconds because that’s how much my two brain cells can come up to”.
---
Maybe not to you, but we should ban these ps pro money bags!! Paying to see 33.333% more clear then us good workin folks, while they sit in their lavish mansions! Ubisoft this is an atrocity of the highest order and now i have the research to prove it!!!
---
Single exterior door, both libraries are almost impossible to defend due to amount of walls, almost no good cover points and a second floor balcony that can overwatch the entire first floor section of the room. 
---
I’ve used this analogy in the past, people always say “your console comes comes with a controller because that’s what games are supposed to be played with”. If that is the case I hope the people saying that are all using that shitty mono earbud for audio.
---
Even pros die to run outs and spawn peeks
---
Yeah, nevermind, shits broken. I guess me hating defending library was a real issue, not just me hating the map. 
---
This happened to me in casual (I was thatcher). A bandit kept tricking so me and our team's thermite couldn't get through.
---
Our team's Maverick ran over to us, opened a tiny hole and then headshot him.
---
He looked very disappointed in us. 
---
The concepts are good. But change the weapons to weapons we don’t have in the game. We need variety. 
---
Nice play
---
Native mouse and keyboard and use of an adapter are 2 completely different things. The hori tac Pro, is sold by Sony for use on PS4 in FPS game. So because this is technically an adapter you are saying people using Officially licensed peripherals should be banned? 
---
80085
---
Got 4x aa on
---
You're dividing the amount of kills by the amount of deaths.
---
So if you get 10 kills and 2 deaths. Your k/d ratio is 5.
---
The k/d ratio could also end up being a decimal becuase you usually don't get a perfect integer. So you could have 7 kills and 6 deaths which doesn't divide by a whole number.
---
Its how many kills you get on average for every death you have.
---
This is hardly anything tbh
---
Possibly because those old maps arent made considering new metas
---
Its still decent but It would be nice if it was reverted to 3 melee hits and it slows you down more like at release
---
That would be cool
---
Thank you!
---
He is not that good, doc is better in almost every way at high level. The only good thing about rook is that it means grenades can't kill you

not really, the problem in the game right now is that there are many ops that reduce skillgap and make bad players better. Shields, Blackbeard, Lion..... Ops like pulse on the other hand require lots of skill to be used properly, and he has a shitty gun. Fuzes gadget is useless and the fact he is a 1 speed negates the fact he has the best gun in the game.
---
Ahahaha damn steps
---
K/D is the number of kills you've achieved divided by the number of times you have died,  often this leaves a fraction/decimal like 1.1 or 1.2. 12 kills and 10 deaths would leave you with a 12/10 or 1.2 kill death ratio. 
---
cuz his gadget is almost useless and he is 1 speed
---
I endorse this. It will make it easier to spot good siege players
---
I do it as well but never realized it could be from cs..
---
New Hereford is not that bad but old Hereford looks is better. Its atmosphere is very dark like a green-tinted Theme Park.
---
Im a big yes to this
---
It is a decimal part.. if you get 5 kills and 3 deaths, your k/d will be 2.6.. because 5 kills and 0 deaths is 5 k/d.. starting the deaths from 0 and taking an example that you have 5 kills, every time you die, this means you gain one death every time, then there is 0.8 decrease in the k/d starting from 5 because previously you had 5 kills and 0 deaths but you gain a death so the k/d will decrease. In this specific example, the suitable number to decrease is 0.8 because we took that you have 5 kills, but if you have 13 kills and 6 deaths, the way to calculate the k/d is different and you dont deacrease 0.8 because the numbers are different. Lets take this example, 5 kills 0 deaths, you died once, decrease 0.8 from the 5 k/d. if you increase the deaths to 5 while keeping kills 5, the k/d will be 1 because kills and deaths are equal.. so to make the k/d decrease from 5 to 1, you should move 0.8 every single time you die or every single time you gain a death, while keeping your kills 5.. this means that 5 kills and 1 death will be equal to 5 - 0.8 = 4.2 k/d. Then, 5 kills and 3 deaths is 5 - ( 0.8 × 3 ) = 2.6.
---
The way to calculate the k/d is really complicated, but this is the best example to understand it, i hope you got my point.. 
---
the thing is at high level roaming isn't about hiding on the other side of the map so jackal is not that strong
---
I'm going to give this a shot, Seems like a good way to get off the chair while playing R6 lol
---
Just don't respond to those griefers. Tking them will only increase their satisfaction.

Worst sight for me,

Housing to big (like holo), reflex pretty much no housing
---
Dot too big, Holo has a smaller dot but I hate the extra circle around it
---
Is the bug still here for this attachment or is it fixed?
---
(It would shoot at the bottom right of the dot instead of centre)
---
I'm in bronze b/c of griefers man. Last season gold 4 and I think your idea is great

Played one game. Im swole now

Lmao time to become overweightn't
---
If you’re looking to lose fat, don’t do this. It won’t work, and it’ll probably just discourage you even more. If you want to lose fat, you need to exercise regularly and on a good diet. Otherwise any change will be next to nothing noticeable. I speak from experience. It’s not easy, but it’s the only thing that works and keeps working.

Today I'm hoping to try something new at the range, debating between the PS-90, or the Benelli M4. Thought I'd try out another two dream guns while I get some handgun practice in.
---
A few of the ops have unseeable ability’s 
---
Finka boost should just add glare to all the ops eyes
---
Blitz’s flash that you can’t see (Literally, ya get fucking blinded) just as different color light :P
---
I'd be happy with year 4 being new operators with existing guns (new gadgets tho) and map buffs and bug fixes making up the majority of it.
---
That's a nice range of anecdotal data right there. ONE games results. Wow, I'm SO convinced now!
---
this is a thing that exists?
---
How Will you know when you don't pick up took armour? 👀
---
They need to buff her rifle it's useless 
---
  Anytime a game gets big it attracts new players who have to level up against players who believe they play at the optimal strategy and  Or maximize exploitation of the game engine and opponents, but that’s hardly ever the case.
---
  New players get better faster grinding against strong players and figure things out by adapting and find exploits to compete against more experienced players. Once new animals (players) are added to the siege eco system the stronger will rise to the top and the ones who occupied the top previously are knocked down a few levels on the food chain. This is why you see everyone complaining about how they used to be diamond or used to be plat but now blame it on other circumstances. 
---
If the game was truly like chess then the best players would always win as they do in chess. Siege has a gambling like quality to it, variance. Siege to me reminds me of poker, lines or plays shifting from agro to passive. You can deploy trickery or bluff opponents, run them over with raw aggression or be passive and sit back ,but there’s always a counter to every style, you just adjust your strategy to balance against theirs what you can’t do is stay stuck in your old ways and not adapt to the game in its current form. 
---
 Siege has so many variables and is a fantastically interesting game. You can apply game theory to find optimal solutions for a set of known variables and then opponents make one change and now they have the advantage or a bug is found and exploited or even the devs changing the game w updates and patches. Even if your a strong player you will lose some % of the time with all the variance the game offers. Tilt control is important in poker,to play every hand to the best of your ability no matter how bad the beat you just took. Siege now requires the player to maintain control of his/ her emotions and not go on raging monkey tilt. There’s so much more to this game tho , I just started playing in October and it’s been fun learning. 
---

---
Lol, you're never going to get in shape like this. The number of exercises are too low for how long it takes for these to happen.

you could make it assists instead. 5 assists, kills or injured with edd

In a game where mobility is your greatest attribute an operator who has to stand still is overpowered. What??
---
This is actually a load of fun, gives you something to do when waiting and gets you fit at the same time. I made my own a while ago and ended up doing 50 press ups, 40 lunges, 35 squats and 20 burpees. Do this every time you play and you'll get a pretty good workout, especially if your sessions are long. 5/7 would recommend.
---
Op couldn’t be assed to do it all, so they just cut it in half
---
Oh oky not bad
---
But the rook one is impossible
---
Thanks man!!
---
That’s lightwork
---
Old but gold strat
---
quick question, how do you get your main on your account? 
---
I think that anything is fine as long as villa, yacht, and or favela are removed. All three of those maps suck, and you can disagree with me if you want, but I hate all three of them.
---
ILLUSIONS ARE FATAL
---
thermite wouldnt use it either

I’m trying to get fatter though

Probably should censor their names
---
OMEGALUL
---
Instead of addressing issue of Copper+Diamond abusing MMR they instead hide ranks now. This looks like a move lazy game devs will do.
---
No you’re not, stop kidding yourself.
---
Oops. My mistake. Thanks 
---
A turtle made it to the water!
---
Imagine Ubisoft saying they're reworking Tachanka because he's probably the worst OP in the game then have someone saying he needs to be nerfed after already being nerfed to oblivion
---
If you start with a decent diet you’ll lose a good bit. I did that with cardio 4 times a week and got down to 165lbs. Doing this while keeping your diet the same won’t help much.
---
Best thing you can do is keep going for it until it eventually pops up.
---
I can agree, id love to see some icelandic ops but id have a hard time seeing that happen 
---
I've done this since the original halo its good to do whileloading and waiting for next game/rkind 
---
Agreed. 
---
Tbh the severity of smurfing in console both rank and casual is undeniable. 
---
Well yeah, I meant more so I’d seriously injure myself. Straight up sever my abs or something.
---
Ok. That makes sense. I thought people wanted the old design back
---
idk the first and second literally never apply to me. I've only ever killed hostage once and Im the one who always plays rook soo.
---
Yeah Villa has been probably the best recent map we have got over past 2 years.  its actually fun to play too beside being balanced.   
---
Not a huge fan of that basement area tho. 
---
&gt; They take turns team killing so they can bully their way through a round with no repercussions.
---
But dont you get kicked immediately once you team kill twice in a game?
---
Is it just me or do the achievement icons in siege remind you of tf2?
---
I like it but think ubi should make the dot smaller, can be hard to hit certain shots with it.
---
I’ll try it and then probably stop when my roommate asks me wtf I’m doing
---
BANK HELLO?
---
Fuze mains about to get 
---
F I T 
---
Agreed. Its a cool map, but the sheer amount of soft walls makes this a bad map. Too many entry points for attackers to create lines of sight with but also for defenders who can rush out and meet you on the roof.
---
Is it not called Favela?
---
That's grand. Sending you friend request with message (my PSN ID is different name to here)
---
This would encourage more trolling. Run infront of someone as they shoot a drone, shoot someone once or twice so they TK.
---
OPERATION: SHELF 
---
Consulate got a buff and on Clubhouse it was not a rework.
---
But what if I aspire to be my main man rook?
---
Hi from the international Derank Association!
---
Does thatcher not exist to you? The fact that an operator gadget has so many counters is ridiculous.
---
I mean all it is you getting 1 kill each clip 
---
**MP4 Link:** https://lew.la/reddit/clips/aejkc1.mp4 
---
Pause, Options, Matchmakig Preferences, Maps (terrorist hunt), off for all maps except the ones you wanna learn. Problem solved
---
Thatcher who? /s
---
I know Thatcher can counter that combo, and Twitch, but imagine neither of them get the chance to make it to the door, by spawnpeeking or just getting plain shot by a roamer. Without them, the door might as well be a brick wall.
---
That has never happened to me...
---
Do you not normally vault steps?
---
I am the Senate!
---
**920° spin**
---
Don't blame the player... Blame the game.
---
If your in ok shape already try V sit ups
---
Doubt it honestly. They probably have a ton of people that they can play with and not necessarily 'scrim' but so that the other team can setup things
---
But only your pecks. Huge boobs!
---
Ash is way too good ATM definitely.
---
Echo and Maestro are great for defending that room. Really puts pressure on the defense. Add some traps (Ela, Lesion, Kap, Frost, etc.) and its a nightmare. Or Valkyrie as well (with Echo &amp; Maestro complete surveillance). For attack Maverick is the guy. Thatcher and Thermite will definitely be useful for the basement since defenders love anchoring behind the walls near the hard walls. 
---
But Maverick though. Seriously. Could ace on a peek hole in the basement if utilized timely.
---
**MP4 Link:** https://lew.la/reddit/clips/aek6o7.mp4 
---
Those are *definitely* the same people smh
---
I was thinking the firing range could be a menu of sorts. So when selecting attachments you could press a button and it would allow you to fire the gun to feel the recoil etc. So you can cycle through the attachments. Rather than that stupid graph thing showing recoil.
---
Um. Watch some pro league. There are accidental TKs in the prep phase all the time. Shit happens.
---
Well you wouldn’t be getting chest and up one shots because they all wear vests with plates with the exception of a few characters. 
---
The meaty footsteps intimidate the enemy team. All jokes aside roaming with doc is my fave thing to do in casual
---
- f*ck cake day

---
(me, not contributing to the conversation because i don't masturbate deceased horses)
---
420 upvotes and I stream my nuts.
---
Shroud 😭
---
been doing this. just a little different. every death is multiplied by 5. then i have a deck of cards and draw looking at suit. 
---
Diamond- Push-up
---
Heart- Crunch
---
Spade- lunge/squat (whatever i’m feeling)
---
Club- pull up
---
so if i have 4 deaths and draw a diamond, i’ll do 20 push-ups before next match. 
---
this got me a girlfriend and now she’s pregnant so something’s working. 
---
Something tells me the focus is the editing 
---
da REAL mvp does both
---
1. An automated system won't know if something was an accident or not so that's not relevant.
---
2. You can frame it how ever you want but really you're complaining about someone killing 1 person 1 round vs someone losing their entire team the round by shooting the hostage.
---
It's atill objectively worse than the r4
---
no
---
Da realest mvp shouts "he's on ping while spotting" 
---
Its easy on plane, look where they spawn and place the traps towards the objective
---
You have a sort of elo in cas too your are probably getting paired with higher people 
---
No I don’t think that at all. The higher level of play you play at (I.e. plat/diamond) the more likely you are to find boosters, hackers and people like this. 
---
I remember before the shield ops accuracy was nerfed where this was happening on a daily basis 
---
Give ash the m1014
---
tf2 much? &lt;3
---
Someone make a decent sized poster so I can stick this on my wall behind my monitor.
---
Really is that happening!?
---
Yeah man I heard bullets back then didn’t even kill people... it just stunned them. 
---
Sorry to nitpick but the C1 is a Sterling, not a Sten.
---
I honestly think the only way to get any meaningful change is to get posts about the report system, grieifing and team killing going. It worked with the aesthetic changes yet no way apparently cares enough about gameplay breaking issues that have gone in addressed for years. This entire subreddits needs to rally together. But no let's get a video of a smurf destroying coppers trending, maybe a meme or two also for good measure.
---
No I mean because of the type of contraction you would simply be unable to do situps before you harm yourself
---
15/10 would buy.
---
Dude what the fuck are you on about the whole reason Lion needs a rework is because it forces people to stand still and there’s no counter
---
She's also Chinese-Canadian, not First Nations as people assume.
---
The R6 challenge
---
Hell no
---
Yeap, it will be fun :)
---
The low fps challenge 
---
I LOVE IT. but as an lesion main I really wish they came out with these more unique sets for other operators. Frost already has a decent amount of different looks. Give lesion something dammit! 
---
The worse thing is that I know that....They both start with the Ste...
---
da reelisst scream "LIVE PING RUSH BLITZ HE'S LIT" and won't let you hear what's going on.

wait is the godly noob in the background?

Yes
---
If you pickup mira expect a long learning curve.
---
Go for a utility operator that fits your playstyle. It's extremely important to have hibana
---
Probably if I feel like it
---
Please god yes. This was my favorite map by far, I miss it so much! Please!!
---
bonk
---
No
---
It is a huge deal but I doubt they fucking do anything 
---
As for sens? It's 100% how you feel. I recommend turning it really low, and cranking it up slowly until you feel comfortable.
---
I play at like, 1k, 11, 11, 83
---
I don't care as long as it replaces favela. 
---
yikes thats netter than her elite
---
You're part of the problem. Literally defending toxic 3-stacks. Unbelievable!
---
That's how team killing works
---
Removing the feature entirely isn't necessary IMO. There could be a sound bug and leaving the game and rejoining is a whole lot faster than rebooting the game. 
---
Simply add a delay like many MMO's have, 10,20 or 30 seconds. So you press leave game and have to wait till this timer is over. Could probably change the mind of 50% of the rage quitters (count to 10 and calm down). 
---
Fucking come and vore me then prick you knew what I meant 
---
It’s not that bad, it’s just that the r4c is better.
---
I can play lion too, that doesn't make him less broken.
---
Yes, and as has been pointed out, your crosshair hardly moves even though your character moves a ton. It doesn't break the game, it just abuses the crouch spam mechanic
---
Sorry, I woke up when I wrote this. But I mean to say they can hear your exact location.
---
Hey man, all those poor poor poor Diamonds will have to actually wait for a fair match like in other game. We can't let that happen in here, poor Diamonds. I feel so sorry about them being so good they have to wait a little bit longer to actually have a fair match and not stomp lower ranked people. Truly, those poor Diamonds. It's so sad to even think about it. I will go get a tissue, I got tears in my eyes now.
---
Make wall reinforcements bigger, remove some soft walls, enclose the outside stair case so defenders can use it, and add floor destruction. It's a better map, and that didn't take too much of a rework.
---
I want it! 
---
Can you get them separately?
---
It's a problem on both, and microsoft has stated it's up to the developers if they want it implemented into their game.
---
If you're peeking a set up bb and the bb loses then that bb is shit.
---
That is true, but seeing some styled quite... "oldly"? Would be cool if there aren't already any
---
Smurfs can get fucked, doesn't matter what dumb reasons you use to justify it.
---
Who are you people?Help me someone
---
You could’ve just posted the last 30 seconds lmao
---
I disagree. I feel her shotgun is great for getting kills, (believe it or not, it’s good)! So making it destructive might be a bit too good. It can get the job done, but u just have to use 1 and a half mags or less to do it.
---
That, and it was a map that had been broken down so much by the pros there were no more viable strats anymore. Same thing happened to hereford when it was removed. Although hereford had more issues than chalet.
---
That's what got me started on the idea, it's a pretty solid gun with history too which is cool, and trench gun for her alternate primary would've been a better fit imo
---
Maverick has a skin that is okay but 
---
Threads like this make me happy that Ubi doesn't listen to Reddit all that often.
---
Woah woah woah.... hold your horses. You are ACTUALLY saying that using headphones is cheating if someone can pinpoint the location of another player because of them? If you don’t mean this can you explain. 
---
How cam you buff a  god?
---
Yeah, no. He's in a good place right now. Being able to eat even just two headshots is an invaluable ability. Many people are of the mind that he's completely broken because of this, even though I don't personally agree I can see where they're coming from. The operator doesn't need a buff, you just need to play better.
---
Wait you can get banned for 1 kill on a hostage? When was this a thing? 
---
I agreed happens a lot. I always look up my opponents
---
Omfg yeah fictional animated character is so HOT 😻😻😻😻
---
and how exactly? 
---
his guns are absolute fucking garbage
---
his shield is destroyed with dmrs in 1 shot, with ar's in 2 shots and with smgs in 2 shots. and dont come at me ''bUt  It cAN stiLL sAvE YOu'' because it wont, unless you're playing against a really slow fire rate weapon which basically dont exist when playing defenders beside the ump and the c1. otherwise a normal smg or ar could kill you faster than you could kill someone with your scar. so if you are gonna compare his shield to any other gadget in the game, you would see how useless it is. 
---
So, you only use the account very seldomly, except for a whole bunch whenever you're just feeling bad and want to make someone else's day shitty.
---
How does that reduce the skill gap? Crouch spamming requires more dexterity, more buttons being pressed, while still pressing all of the other buttons you normally have to. Sounds like an increased skill gap to me. I get that it’s not particularly difficult to learn how to do it, but you still have to learn how to do it
---
I agree with what you said about why she was a must pick, but I still feel highly skilled players can dominate the map with her if played properly. But since C4 can’t do crap to shields now, that’s why it would be balanced if she were to get it back.☺️
---
I play on PC, just for fun.
---
I think i'll go for maverick as attacker.
---
Valkirie is a good operator but i like Pulse ability to detect enemy staying safe and not letting them know. Idk, maybe i will wait.
---
Tachanka is not a meme, its a religion
---
Well when I'm heard when I'm a crouched caveira then I have a problem. I've seen this before and it's bullshit.

it was a custom game but me and my friend are trying to pull it off online
---
it's a placebo

Imo this is how to make shields support players and not fraggers
---
Inb4 this is remover
---
yeah unless he could get a headshot, but WAIT thats the hard part, he has a 550 fire rate. and you'd think the damage would compensate it. nope it wont you have a low damage gun with a slow fire rate and with a low mag capacity. 
---
Aye, but this is a game with young men, Roblox is meant for kids, imagine how a kid would feel if they were banned from their favourite game.
---
Seeing as it was only made for the situation I think we should leave it as is for now. Possibly in the future when there aren't as many reworks or map buffs needed for other maps. 
---
Ik
---
Yeah, that’s be a nice change but people have been asking for it for a while 
---
It can save you,it might be because your aim is bad or your reflexes are slow.
---
But me and my friends (we are high gold to low plat ) we all think he is op.
---
Hol up
---
On pc he is op because you are so accurate with your shots so being able to block 2 bullets is super good because then it will take 3 bullets to headshot a bb but it only takes 1 bullet to headshot any defender. 
---
I love this one but I also have the elite...
---
Game's trash right now. Ubisoft is trying to cover up their terrible matchmaking. Community is toxic. Play something else man.

not if you're playing against defenders with 26 damage smgs and 950 fire rate. you'd die in less than .5 seconds.
---
I play at a high enough rank that people play what the team needs.
---
I agree, the game is in a bad place at the moment 
---
it would be hillarious if you accidentaly would shock yourself instead of Cav :D
---
Completely agree. But I am sorry to report that you may not find these cool clips of C4 welcome mat traps because at the time the super 90 was so damn broken you basically wouldn’t even have to use her C4. But take my word for it, when i used to do it in black ice it was SOOOOO satisfying, and felt amazing!!
---
There is maverick with his sneaky holes and kaid with a new bandit style claw that u can throw. Nomad can lunch a trap that knocks u from u feet for 3 seconds. Herford got a rewokr and fortress is completely new. Maestro and alibi came with Vila and an placeable camera that shots lasers and is bulletproof. Alibi has holograms that spot u agree shooting 
---
Holy shit thank you so much. I'm trying to get the trophy and I've been suffering using Mira or guess work.
---
Ok clash in medium Elo ranks makes lion seem like tachanka. She is un-killable and just as op as people make lion out to be.
---
    All shield ops need to be looked at, but especially clash. I would create a rule similar to defenders needing to be3 armors to have acogs. The rule would be that no operator should be able to do damage from behind a full body shield.  Clash needs the sides and top of her shield removed because she can’t even be killed in a 1v2 as well as her shield shouldn’t protect her back while shes defusing. 
---
BLITZ IS A NIGHTMARE AT THE MOMENT. He is way to fast and if he rushes you his chances of winning the fight are far to high. Flash effect should be shortened but should be more consistent. Remove the ability to do 1 hit melees and make it 3 because even 2 is too fast. No vaulting with his shield in front of him.
---
Agreed
---
Blackbeard is a bullshit tier operator. 
---
Just because you cannot seem to make him work to his full potential, does not mean he needs a buff.
---
The Sterling is just a more refined Sten.  So calling it a Sten isn't exactly wrong.  
---
Not. Yet.
---
No, what would be a problem is if caveira was 100% inaudible when in silent step. 
---
Yes 
---
You need a job at Ubisoft.

You can actually kill people at a decent range hipfiring with the laser sight, just quickly pop up from cover and when you hear someone coming through an angle

I recommend Nomad. she’s Airjap is effective for Roamer but Maverick is good for camping 
---
choice your style
---
Wow, 2 whole memes that haven't been funny in over a year and 4 years, that's a record.
---
I am good at the game. I don't complain about getting killed or being outplayed. I'm complaining about all the terrible issues this game has.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I had a similar idea to the speaker but rather than random noises it would mimic the sounds it's operator makes
---
Take a peek at rogue 9's ttk chart from parabellum. It really outlines how much better the attacker weapons are than the ones one defense.
---
Comparing Seige to poker instead of chess is a very strong analogy

I know that feeling, I got the elite but I wish we could combine stuff because I love the posh set lol

It depends on how you play, if you tend to anchor more then yes.

Precisely.

Sure if you know exactly where they'll be, and are willing to die trying to place an air jab in the perfect spot in order to simply delay them, and sometimes simply reposition them without killing them, all in the first 6 seconds of a match.

This this and this! People need to get fucking mad about teamkilling and the current horrible player experience. Start a campaign about speaking with your wallet and get people to stop giving them money and see how it suddenly becomes important.
---
My guess is their may be some sort of uncertainty about part of it (probably toward the end). So instead of putting something out and being attacked to no end for changing it, just wait until it's more certain. 
---
I meant specifically new models, as opposed to texture swaps. Although I suppose those are better than nothing.
---
And costing R6 Credits automatically disqualifies it for me as well.
---
That looks like a common Hong Kong English name, where many emigrate to Canada.
---
But that’s not Kaplan’s thing.
---
Frost isn't Chinese, she's Canadian... 
---
I forgot all about this map! 
---
To be honest, just the bag alone can be his present :)
---
She is looking like: wtf did u just say?! 
---
Aaah i see now
---
pretty please 
---
Literally just came from a game with the throwers who would follow me and intentionally TK me or lower my health to negligible amounts because I was calling him out for his bullshit. The fact that I along with several other people have undoubtedly sent numerous reports (and even some people in my games have recorded footage) without anything actually happening says that Ubisoft does not care about this guy farming their game. 
---
I just want to play the game, man. I can't improve or play if I'm fucking dead the whole time. 
---
If you don’t care or notice then why does it matter to you if the maps are changed or removed so that people who actually do care and notice will have a better experience?
---
As casual as it gets
---
This is old news. Maybe you weren't around before they started hiding it. But before they did that, players of lower rank would often get teamkilled amongst other toxic behaviors or would leave match before it even started after seeing who they're paired up with.
---
Hiding the ranks resolved this issue cuz players no longer know that they're being paired with lower ranks.
---
I agree with you, these rank differences isn't cool. But that's not why they hid them.
---
This is awesome!!
---
Wouldn't be a super significant thing, just a tweak to help him co operate with other trap operators instead of ruining them. I'm not talking about a floor trap, just a change to the way it is triggered.
---
Hey. @r6_pro_memer here. Ik I said it before but I really like this idea. Tachanka needs something to increase pick rate. This could do it.
---
or just delete shields from the game
---
Oh it's glowing yellow , I wonder what it means🤔
---
So did i until i got bored and decided to retry all the situations 
---
is is mixed - chinese with metis IIRC (metis is French aboriginal mix)
---
Frost was my first Defense op definitely worth it
---
You can't get better if you're dead/on seven HP for the majority of the match because this guy will TK you or lower your HP to where you're guaranteed to die in one shot. 
---
Yeah but, smg tho
---
Nice ace!
---
It's not a bot. The guy has chased me around maps, team killed, and has posted highly toxic messages in chat consistently. The messages aren't the same every time either, so that means that there has to be someone inputting those messages.
---
Edit: grammar
---
Thanks!
---
And she looks like twitch
---
Ur mum gay
---
Nah
---
I logged on and it says I own this, despite not owning frost?
---
I’d love to offer the same to Xbox players!! Add me! GT: ‘gods will usmc’
---
Once again this dumbass just tries to call people out on their minor bullshit to try and get a lil karma lol
---
I prefer her shotgun. It has good range too. I can 3-4 tap from the hip someone down a hallway with it. Plus it’s a 1 tap up close. 
---
It wasn’t OP, the traps were much easier to notice. When he got 5 traps with lower damage but no laser it was a buff, not a nerf
---
Dropshotting is also not abuse, it was dumb and no one liked it but that doesn’t mean abuse
---
It's in game right now, for some reason it says I own it already
---
Dont remember anyone being forced to buy the pass 4 months in advance so if you feel that strongly about it why not wait until the official road map releases? If you still feel like it's not worth it since they can change their minds midway through a year on what's releasing, do you really need to buy it? Like what was said above outside of a skin, a charm, and a store discount you can still buy the ops with renown. It's there to help support the devs and if you dont wabt to or feel like what's offered isn't enough, then you can absolutely choose not to purchase it and still get all the seasons content anyway. Sorry for the wall of text 
---
*burns uwu into wall*
---
Trap operators really don’t need to synergize together. Putting multiple traps in one location is a liability. Yes, the mat-gu combo is strong, but if the mat goes down the gu could too. The idea of having multiple trap operators is to spread them, covering all points of entry/high traffic areas.
---
I don’t like 1 because with the others you can just keep a tally and do them later, but with 1 it’s time sensitive and I’d rather my dead teammates check cams and do callouts than put their headset down and focus on their squats.
---
I get that, but my issue with Skyscraper is sheer amount of run outs, I can often cover a run out just fine on most other maps but there’s to many. When defending Tearoom-Karaoke, they can jump out Tea room window, the door out side tea room, Karaoke, Gaisha and the room outside of drum. You can also get hit from the soft wall on dragon if you’re standing by Tearoom window. That’s 6 places, that’s too many. Other sites are close to as bad, Offices has 4 that I can think of plus the ability to be shot from tea room if you’re by dragon. BBQ also has 4 that I can think of. There’s way to many ways to get shot and not enough ways to get up to the balcony areas. That’s my biggest issue with the map and Nomad isn’t going to solve any of that. 
---
Hey I'm talking when the game first came out man. 😂 when everyone was still new to this. 
---
What did you just say...
---
Frost is emo
---
I want some death match maps, attackers v attackers, defender v defenders, etc.
---
IQ and Kapkan.
---
I explicitly said that not everyone in the community but a big part of it is toxic. The toxicity is a huge problem of the game and let me tell you it's a Turn-Off for new players and it seems to get worse every month.
---
It sounds clickbait. 
---
Yeah if the just blocked up the lower left window and upper right window things would be fine. Those are the 2 that people always spawn peaked from plus the lower left one let's them plant on that window and watch defuser from it on one of the bomb sights
---
How is this possible
---
It’s beautiful
---
Gamer
---
So much luck in so little time 
---
Good.to know, thanks mate
---
She needs her C4 back that she lost in Dust Line. It has such good synergy with her welcome mats and would be balanced now because the super 90 isn’t broken.
---
Buy operators and get skins from packs.
---
No one really cares about skins. But buying operators is essentially free content.
---
It's so stupid that people have to choose from elite animation and other good skins. People should be able to equipt the elite animation separately 
---
*so much skill in so little time
---
Yup, Ubi really needs to cater to all walks of life, not just the competitive scene &amp; not just the casual players. This is why I think the 3 gamemode revamp would make sense as there’s a middle ground for players like me who are forced to play ranked for (sort of) balanced matchmaking.
---
Amazing
---
PS4 and idk what server I’m in mountain time though. 
---
I think it already has been
---
I would love to know I think I had a breakdown
---
I had the flash on
---
There is nothing on the website about it
---
Csgo is worse now that its free
---
I have all operators exepted echo , ying and dokka but I don't like them very much
---
My intentions exactly.
---
How does someone get into such a wrong mindset?
---
Took them a month, but they're about to fix it.
---
YES!!! This was my favorite map. Why did it get removed?  I left to play pubg and recently came back and kept wondering why it hasnt popped up.
---
Lmao this guy is a super genius.
---
or the infamous "he's one hit"
---
"Buck 1 - monsters 0"
---
Good play! How many hours did you put into blitz?
---
Six Invitationals in February
---
:shrug:
---
2 days 3 hours 15 minutes.

is this a pointillism or? either way this looks incredible!
---
Came here to chat about video games not about the best exercises for my chest and core but thanks anyways ubi.
---
There is a major price difference between the RTX 2070 and 2080 (almost $500 difference) do you think I should instead go with the 2070? I just want 144hz 1440p on high - ultra settings
---
Why care? Console gaming is doomed by MKb cheaters.
---
PC version isn't fun to begin with.
---
“So you tried to spawn peek”
---
Thanks chief 
---
I present you:  The Elasaurus.
---
What is released ?
---
It says I own it, and I claimed it, but I don’t see it in my inventory so is that a bug or do I wait?
---
*Cough* Bandit *Cough*
---
It a common 
---
I would like to say it just casual stuff so...
---
Welp, do you actually know your MMR of casual will be reset if you don’t play for a season, which is you are now matching with the noobest people in the game. Or more precisely, you are matching with dumb kids or the people who literally can’t play the game well. And since they can’t play well, they are trying to blame or even TK their teammates.
---
It will be fine after you play more matches. 
---
Most of your list either lacks enough detail to really respond to (for instance, I don't know what game mechanic you think is dumb). However, there is one thing in your rant that I can't just gloss over:
---
&gt; I have a very good suggestion and that is to fire most of the dev team whom have got their heads up their asses and are doing it for the sake it being a job rather than passion or duty such games like Siege require dedicated efforts and time not this shit that you have been giving us 
---
How many AAA games have you developed? How many large development companies have you worked for? I can tell you with almost complete certainty that the problems with Siege are not the development team members. It's the management that are setting unrealistic deadlines, skimping on infrastructure, setting the priority of work, and the like. The reason I feel so confident about this is one reason: Operation Health.
---
The money and players Ubisoft lost during Operation Health was likely very substantial. I assure you that decision did not come as a result of upper Ubisoft management identifying the issues that were plaguing the game and deciding it was the right thing to do. Even with the cynical view many players held with Operation Health that it was simply a way for Ubisoft to try to save face after not meeting the deadline to turn around a map and two operators doesn't make sense; we'd likely see the operation come slightly later rather than missed entirely in that case. Operation Health, regardless of how successful you think it was, could've only come from the development team advocating strong enough for management to agree to it.
---
There is plenty of blame to go around for the state of Siege. But having worked in software development environments my entire professional career, much of which at very large companies, I can tell you that most of the things you've pointed to are symptomatic of management decisions driving what and how the developers build. It's not the result of developers who are incapable of doing the work or who don't care about the product.
---
Take bank out the rotation too, fuck that map
---
Yeah but that shotgun is super good for spamming. High rate of fire and low recoil
---
The next special  seasonal skin.
---
Not exactly.  Maining a op you're good with that fits your play style makes sense.  No point in choosing a new op every time if you're not good with them.  Maining gives you an opportunity to really work out the best way to play that op.  All the pros have their mains.  Yes they can adapt and choose any in the game, but they will typically have their main and stick with em.  
---
Nah it doesn’t work I went onto a website called Xboxclips.com searched my gamer tag and it came up with my clips 
---
Like every seasons
---
Smh, y ubi drop actual good looking uniform sets after giving that operator an elite? Now i have to buy this as well.
---
Edit: title should be disqualified not banned. 
---
Do you have any idea, how much man power it would take to review every time someone gets kicked? Do you think people will stop kicking because they added an reason requirement where you can simply select? 
---
Very nice
---
&gt;Opens it slowly
---
&gt;The package starts glowing gold-ish from the inside
---
&gt;You hurry up and open the rest of the package
---
&gt;"Wtf an alpha pack charm"
---
Could be the hairstyle change. Her face doesn't seem any different from the Posh Bundle's Vintage hat but instead of a bob, Frost's hair for this headgear seems to be in a [crown braid](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/7b/e6/007be6080b3f4de881b432c0751e4f54.jpg).
---
Kanal needs the rework desperately
---
I mean at least it's not ranked? It's not like you get punished other than wasting some of your time in that game
---
[*Jurassic park theme starts*]
---
Haha
---
Yep, impacts all day. I have been wanting these for years.
---
Did you use his ability though. Because if you don’t I don’t see what they can honestly complain about 
---
Having a reason won't change much, although it'd be nice people will still be toxic as hell.
---
Vote kicking is something to just expect in R6 now adays. 
---
This reminds me of the **elongated necc** fish from SpongeBob
---
good on him you know, just encouraging him that's all 
---
They're not going to touch a map viable for pro league. That would be idiotic.
---
Straight Outta WWI
---
Crazy motherfucker named Frost Cube from the gang called JTF2
---
I think this would be awesome. Hold to place and tap to detonate. 
---
Bulletproof shield would be to op, I think his shield being able to take more hits would be better
---
Its the unlegit diamonds DDOSING the game because they cant win - so they wont accept the loss. Thats why ranks dont matter in this game
---
No, Fuck you. You are toxic as fuck. You are ruining other peoples gameplay experience because you made an assumption. Fuze is an operator that is pickable, teamkilling over an operator pick should be banable. 
---
I paid £60 for my copy of the game, some entitled douchebag thinks he knows the "ettiquete" better and thus takes away my gameplay experience. That should be banable every time. Period.
---
Could be the hairstyle change. Instead of her usual bob, Frost's hair seems to be a [crown braid](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/7b/e6/007be6080b3f4de881b432c0751e4f54.jpg) for this helmet.
---
So I bought the elite skin for nothing 
---
Yeah dude u shot twice 2 bullets are missing
---

---
True very true
---
Should have been the elite skin, ese.
---
of course the rook main comments "t h i c c" in bold and italic XD
---
Deserved since youre using Blitz.
---
Nah, they dropped out as soon as they had a screenshot that I've been picking "lion"
---
To be fair we where losing, and then made a comeback and the other team saw this as an opportunity to get a "protest win" 
---
That’s just shitty sportsmanship on their part 
---

---
It may be better but it's still an oversized mess of a map. Ubisoft needs to stop making maps that have soo many rooms.
