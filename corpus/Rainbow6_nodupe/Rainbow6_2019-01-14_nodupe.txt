I believe they recently buffed its dmg by 2 per pellet (+16 dmg total)
---
Except this is possibly more flawed than the current system. It only rewards for kills. Never mind if you played an anchor and game winning callouts or clutches. Only kills.
---
Whoa. That's impressive dude 
---
Nice

Give that bad boy an ACOG!...sorry Jager

Wow that looks amazing

seriously though, dokkaebi is the most weeb operator ever.

Cav interrogated his cornflakes
---
Downvoting because it is hundreth topic like that this week. Booting after 1 tk is even more unfair that 3 strikes.
---
Is that why his kd is so high aswell?does leaving make it not effect his kd?

---
The only thing that gives you an advantage that atleast I wouldn’t consider cheating are scuf controllers. Also by the way I play ps4 and I use controller against diamonds all the time and I can kill them. Just takes practice
---
Well there's no other way to earn outbreak packs. At least I don't think there is. So there no reason to put that feature out there. It was there when outbreak packs were first out. The stuff you get from outbreak packs is all you get.
---
That makes me happy for u but sad for me
---
I've always liked [this one](https://i.redd.it/y8mtz8npl9vz.jpg), just because I imagine that's Cav's dayjob, but she's in BOPE for emergencies *at a moment's notice*
---
Sounds pretty shit
---
No, thats because he is most likely a high gold playing against copper 4's. 
---
Ranked is horrible im in silver 3 now and sometimes I see people who cant even ads or shoot
---
Just when I thought I’d moved on and healed from missing her. 
---
i´m not here to make someone sad , sorry man :(
---
That’s what you get for going outside the defender area. 
---
The only way I can imagine it being possible is if they had the plane inside a maintenance hangar of some sort where there was more than one main route per level. Maybe the plane could be partially disassembled or something and there's rooms attached that are like workshops
---
Own it like me. Level 98 Copper III
---
Rip karma didn’t even do nothin
---
Advanced edition gives I think 10 outbreak packs
---
It’s fine I just know that you have ten more higher kills than me
---
The Super 90 is ***still good***!
---
They well eventually get it. That's the plan. They haven't forgot about the base CTUs. I mean they just released Blitz and Glaz Elites. There's no specific pattern to them.
---
This would be great if and when they put this in you should be able to play it in between games
---
If I repost something is it an ace?
---
Same here lol 
---
I think ubi accidentally leaked their own stuff
---
Irk either
---
It’s not a leak if it’s in the game...
---
People think its a possible leak...
---
G-Pro
---
Still not an appropriate use of the downvote button.
---
If the TK was deliberate, then no it isn't unfair. It actively deters TKing and Immediately removes the problem if they are TKing deliberately.
---
If it WASN'T deliberate, the person who got TKd has to watch the killcam and see it was an accident, and they may or may not punish you. If you get punished, oops, go find another match and be more careful.
---
Your suggestion wouldn't work at all. I explained that.
---
Read the title they aren’t actually there ubi accidentally announced it
---
Yes. Think its a bug as no one can open them
---
I got it but and don’t see it 
---
Same, they're probably not released yet
---
Same idk what’s happening 
---
Nice wallbang!
---
There was a lot more on the day of release. 50 to be exact. There's no other way to get them. The 10 items you got is all you get.
---
Same
---
I guess, but depending on what it was, I just assume the game itself was being a dick lol
---
You sure man? I been drinking tons of G fuel (I cant remember last time i blinked) and practicing hard for weeks. They still annihilating me and im getting desperate.  i been thinking get either mnk or gaming chair with those built in speakers which one would help more?
---
Still not a leak, it’s a leak if an outside source released the info
---
So fucking stupid

Details
---
Well, anything which is not razer then. Honestly what kind of answer did you expect?...
---
What is your hand size? Grip? Current sens?
---
The killcam is nice to tell. It’s a bit broken right now, but when someone is flicking back and forth with insane accuracy, it becomes too obvious that they’re not using controller, especially when they are able to have extremely precise movements
---
Mw to
---
same, didnt get any packs tho
---
Sniper90?
---
Leaving doesn’t protect your KD (unless you do it to avoid being killed).  
---
His KD is high because he’s a good player playing at a much lower MMR than he should.
---
Yea *Chad*
---
www.rainbowsixsiege.com/news
---
👎
---
I think it was toxicity. He's an asshole, but mostly only to friends. he doesn't TK or call people things like &gt;!"niggers"!&lt;, so i never understood why he got permabanned.
---
Ur name is fucking snowflake fuck off kid 
---
Oh and the items should be marked with a little icon on the upper left corner of the items. I'm not 100% about that tho. 
---
80% of siege community will boot wven if they clearly see the tk was unintentionall just because they are pissed. About 90% tks in my games are unintentional that gives more unfair than fair boots in the matches I play.
---
You’re acting like a real *Chad* right now
---
Literally just came on to ask same thing
---
No. One is natively supported by the game and one is not. The game was designed and intended for one to be used and not the other. You’re committing a logical fallacy by comparing things to prove a point, but your comparison is invalid. So, yeah, equivalency does matter.
---
Plane is one of the most fun maps in siege. Definitely not competitive but it’s so much fun. I really hope they don’t rework it much (if they do at all)
---
Whoa whoa, calm down there, *Chad*.  No need to be a *Chad*
---
WHERE ARE THEY- ahem, I mean, which way did the snatch thieves go?
---
yeah lmao i got one but couldn't find it.
---
Yeah, I got it. I tabbed out for a while, then tabbed back in and it was there.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Weirdly enough, none of my friends who were in the lobby got it. 
---
What was in it?
---
Personally having tried them both Speeds are faster but it's barely noticeable.
---
To give an example having used Reds for a while before getting a shot at Speeds while playing Siege for a while it simply came down to noticing stuff like when I hit crouch or sprint(very noticeable movements) they activated a split second faster than I was used to. This difference seems to stop being noticeable after a while and I'd likely have to use Reds again for a good while to notice again.
---
I got that and dont see the pack
---
I didn't get a pack either. Maybe when the event starts?
---
Couldn’t connect to servers for a while but once I did got this message
---
I miss this layout, but at the same time the new one is great too
---
Me also.....

Oh no first Blackbeard than black ice now our newest ops
---
true but youtube helps too
---
Don't try to use logic with siege.... 
---
bruh that was lesion
---
So they're actually not available yet, just some error in the game?
---
You had plenty of time to kill him. You just missed. Regardless of crouch spam or whatever, you had nearly two whole seconds to kill him.
---
Noticed this funny book name in Kafe reading room thought it was pretty funny

So the invite has appeared earlier than it’s supposed to?
---
Secure bathroom.... God i miss that castled up
---
Actually high ping is an advantage and siege it allows for peakers advantage to benefit the higher ping more.
---
If you plan on playing ps4 you can search on the community for r6 teams and ask to squad up from there. MOST of the time people aren’t weird and are laid back and chill about the game.

I get your point, but most of these skins are not even avaible to buy anymore, like pro league Season 1 skins, so I don\`t see why not to do this
---
The way you explained it, it sounded like you have to go do a RL thing between every match. Also I didn’t say I don’t know anyone in real life I said I’ve never heard anyone complain about this issue as much as you have.
---
Hmm everyone else ive talked to told me not to go into ranked till ur like level 50
---
It's also purposely ambiguous. If Attackers defuse a bomb, sometimes the announcer will say "OpFor is in possession of a bomb", which means you could have been preventing them from trying to steal it and use it. 
---
The Defenders aren't terrorists; afaik Tom Clancy lets his name be used on games as long as players cannot play as terrorists (just one of the conditions). I don't recall the source on this, but I read it somewhere a while back.
---
To be fair, it was in halo before rainbow 6

Honestly, I feel like the crouching mechanic is in a good place right now. And no chances needs to be made. TBH
---
I love playing rool because you don't have any gimmicks to remember. You just put down your bag and you're done
---
Yeah I did, I blew the opportunity real bad. I still cannot accept this type of thing happening.
---
i didn’t but i also had friends. Ranked is a mindset for most people. Most people want to win, you are matched on ELO, you can kick someone for being bad, you can surrender, you learn better strats, etc.
---
Your aim was terrible no offence 
---
Oh ok, that makes sense.

As long as you had mute or bandit and you guys had a team that reinforced and good aim, you were golden. That top ledge was OP.
---
uhhhmmmm okay?
---
It's the way pro league is played
---
DMRs are never the answer. Automatics are better than semi autos. M45 vs. 9mm is a question of ammo and TTK. I feel like I only really use the pistol in panic situations where I don't have any opportunity to reload, and I want as many bullets as possible for extended fights, so I use the one with the bigger mag and lower damage. The only exception to that for me is Glaz's pistol, which I use in actual close range fights. For that one specifically, I use the higher damage pistol for 2 shot body kills.
---
Seeing as they don't really make that much from sales of the game these days, where else do you think the money to fix the game could come from other than cosmetics?

Once had a dude say I get carried because I had a .9 K/D but a 1.1 W/L. 
---
Then I tried explaining that kills aren't everything in Ranked and he said they are in secure. 
---
Imagine playing secure in Ranked. 
---
Yeah seems like typical Rainbow Douches....man the game needs to be scrubbed clean of that filth even more. 
---
LOL

They meant Glaz, cause he’s an attacker.

Ubisoft game development is like that beer bottle song.

Oh there's 99 issues and bugs in the game

I’m sorry are we watching the same video?

This has been the single most amazing thing in my life
---
This sounds very similar to CSGOs overwatch feature. The only thing that would make it even more reliable is to have people who either have high rankings in game/current season or been with the game the longest without having a bad history within the game. Just an idea though
---
Stop being with shitty RNG Lootboxes, the game already has Microtransactions, has multiple season passes, and paid only skins why do you feel the need to keep pumping this shit into it

Like everyone else is saying, only the top floor is really a different experience, all other rooms are essentially have the same plays.
---
I'm gonna have to disagree with you on this whole thing. You are throwing out stats and numbers that don't exist to prove your point. I highly doubt 90% of people will kick for an unintentional teamkill. Maybe 1 in 5 is more likely. If your experience is that bad, then maybe the problem isn't so much the people you play but rather how you approach each match and situation. There are no stats for this yet so it could work wonderfully. It would definitely be better than the current system. 
---
My team had an entire mira/frost start for that which could be summed up as "I'm not stuck in here with you, you're trapped in here with me"

Yes but they probably good because they using mnk right?

This is one reason why the internet sucks. And what’s worse than these guys in the video are the jack asses defending them here. Do men experience harassment? Yes. But not solely because they are men. That’s the difference you idiots. Yes they can mute, but if you know anything about the game you know communication is important. Do you know why hardly anyone plays solo on console? It’s because no one communicates. It’s also fucking boring feeling like you are playing a single player game. Women shouldn’t have to isolate themselves just to play. Do you know why you dickweeds never get that gamer girlfriend? Because you act like this. The sad part is most of the guys who do this shit online don’t have the balls to even look at a girl in real life. Anyways, I’m sure some MRA will post some Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro link in response but here’s the wiki page on sexism in video games. At the bottom you can find links to studies and references: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism_in_video_gaming
---
ITT: "I hate Hereford even though I love Villa for some reason. I don't know why, it's what the internet told me to do."
---
**Sexism in video gaming**
---
Sexism in video gaming is prejudiced behavior or discrimination based on sex or gender as experienced by people who play and create video games, primarily women. This may manifest as sexual harassment or in the way genders are represented in games, such as when characters are presented according to gender-related tropes and stereotypes.
---
The demographics of video game culture have changed since the 1980s and 90s, when video games were perceived as something of interest mainly to young men. Women make up about half of all game players as of the 2010s.

I tried to get the best pic, even a screenshot makes it look bad so I decided to just show that it’s my skin by giving proof. I can post a screenshot if you want
---
Took him more rounds though. Looks like we need a 1v1 to settle this. 
---
I have access to that email. I have asked them for help and the request is being processed. 
---
I did that too. No answer from them yet. 
---
Even worse was the stupid ass cover on the top side of garage. Impossible to hit so you had to Kobe those mofos, which was also hard to do because you had to enter the room and pray they dont hit you.
---
Ironic he could save others but not himself 
---
You don't have to hold Q/Ebut I think it's changeable in the settings
---
add info to request that you have the first email and they can send mail to it
---
I dont know what you're saying lol
---
Missing you old Club House and old Hereford!
---
You know... I was joking mate :)
---
I know you meant "epic" like "cool" and not the rarity, the joke flew over your head I guess :/
---
She’s distracting Glaz with terrible art to critique.
---
It was fun to slap a team off the game then the would ask for a rematch cause they thought they could win so you would just slap them off the game again

I understand all of this, but on console it works a bit different with aim. Usually people who dont know how to control recoil (like on bucks gun) aim for the hips and let the recoil go up to their opponents head. That is why blackbeard is so back, low ranks instinctively aim low to get kills just with the recoil of the gun

Do it pussy you wont

Yeah, hopefully the next map Ubi releases, it's a small compact map. There is a reason why Nuketown is everyone's favorite map of all time. Because it caused pandemonium and was just downright fun despite being so damn small. 
---
Technically I'm a Monty main since Grim Sky.
---
then it’s ok because i appreciate montagne mains 
---
they stole my mediocre video? i’m so confused
---
What’s going to happen?
---
As funny as that is lmao I think they need to make swapping shoulders have a delay like in reality if you swapped shoulders like that with a rifle you’d chin check yourself to the point you’d look like a hockey player. Just what I think should be done maybe make it fair for everyone 
---
Idk...is it?
---
From the description it seems like it will be like the other ones: 1 for free and others are paid.
---
They just don't have anything interesting to show.  
---
Remember that next season will be revealed on six invitational 4 weeks from now.  
---
you right
---
2 weeks ago when I bought my mechanical keyboard I was hiting 3 by error xdd (mechanical keyboards have higher caps and I used to play with a memb keyboard)
---
Damn I wish I had a nice PC
---
Hereford needs to go BYE BYE
---
🤔
---
I never understood muzzle brake on a smg
---
me too my guy i’m always down to play w new people 
---
Bandit as well shooting oblivious player just to die cavs pistol seems inconsistent as well
---
In addition to 750 hours on PC, I also had about 1300 hours on console before making the switch. Everything I said still applies 
---
What do you use for smg? 
---
Always flash hider
---
bro why is your friend hot
---
It was used for rating the connection/ping experience that you had during the game. It was never well implemented so they ended up removing it. Its Epi made a comment about it years ago
---
Oh holy shit I laughed so hard when I saw the chat. I think it's even better that it just cuts to black.
---
&gt;So Reddit what do you have to say to my friend?
---
Don't forget to ADS.
---
No
---
FH.
---
I hate muzzle flash.
---
Because he's a good lookin' canadian boy
---
Hes entitled to his own opinion. Even though it's wrong 😎
---
He said that you shot me, if you send me the VOD, we’ll 100% take actions to punish him from our discord  
---
Instead of posting a small clip, POST the WHOLE video, oh wait, you won’t and if you do, you can edit it out lmaoooo, but yknow what.... we don’t give a fuck about manipulative liars

My best ace was as Long and I had like 20+ rounds left because I prefired all the walls
---
No indeed

REEEEEEEEEEE

I’m on PS4 tho. It’s fun but the lack of non ads leaning, TTS, and delayed reaction time is getting to me.

Finally, a red dot attacker.

I can probably count on one hand the amount of times that shield has done anything
---
Amazing idea ❤️
---
ive been playing since health i dont understand
---
What skin is that 
---
Very crappyy parallel, to be honest. 
---
Literally unplayable
---
I must be the worst player in the world, i play pretty often and i didn't even know the map changed... My poor map knowledge skills
---
Fuze attack
---
Rook defense. 
---
I had a game where we were pitched against a diamond in low gold. He had a very similar score
---
I thought color blindness was either a yes or a no. What makes someone have mild color blindness?
---
Yeah that's what I was saying. Then he started telling me you could add in csgo?
---
Good ol' times 
---
Gotcha haha. I appreciate it
---
I'm sure there's others, but you just made me realise that Ubisoft is indeed the only company (again, that I know of) that does
---
&gt;1. Paid **only** loot boxes
---
That are
---
&gt;2. Limited time
---
And
---
&gt;3. Contain items you *cannot get* any other way (drops, external trading etc.)
---
In a 
---
&gt;4. $60 AAA game (the price varies, but I'll get to that)
---
Like for all the (well deserved) shit Battlefront 2 got, nowadays the only "Loot Boxes" that exist are the daily 500 credit box and skin bundles (which give you the full set listed, no rng in either), one of which is free and the other is a buy 2, get 1 free for both ingame currency and the real money one.
---
That people defend the seasonal packs is fucking bonkers to me, especially given the
---
-R6 credits and exclusive R6 credit items.
---
-Boosters
---
-**FOUR** season passes
---
-Limited time straight-cash bundles (pro league sets an der a few others)
---
-5 different editions, ranging from the grind fest starter edition to the $180 (AUD) "Complete" edition 
---
I used to think that Siege did monetisation *so well*, and it kills me to see that goodwill taken advantage of.
---
I honestly think that if they stopped doing loot boxes it would be a near-perfect system, and I would absolutely feel much better about supporting it by buying things.
---
But, as of right now, they haven't, so I don't.
---
No worries dude. People nowadays just don’t care about how they treat others or how they should act. It’s ok to react to things like this, it’s completely normal.
---
Yea it was all clear and they won the match
---
We should all get one punch on your English teacher m8 cause holy fuck I did not understand what you were trying to say.
---
The dorm would have burnt down before I even thought about leaving Siege. 
---
They could have just buffed the upper floors instead of creating something completely new... For example a second indoor staircase (maybe on garage side).
---
This shitpost made me laugh out loud for many seconds. Thanks
---
where I learned how to play Thermite
---
I dont see what happened?
---
Ash ran in during lion drone and nothing happened?
---
lmao the military only enables fascism, get fucked
---
Its 3 times a year relax
---
Ash got the bandit battery for me so I can breach the wall. 
---
Big maps are cool because you get some freedom to roam and/or flank but they need to be kept simple like Bank or Consulate.
---
Back then you had 1 big room, now you have 4 small rooms. Disgusting design.
---
Whenever I get into a rough patch I always take a break for a day or two and play something a little less mentally taxing than siege like a single player game. 
---
Hope this helps! 
---
That says more about your comprehension level than anything else "m8", because it's a perfectly legible sentence.
---
No get gud
---
There is now a hall way between all three rooms with a window and hatch 
---
r/hmmm
---
What are you trying to say if you don't mind explaining.
---
he means just for sheilds. i think shield ops should not be able to lean unless the shield is on their back. sheild ops are not for holding angles, and leaning only gives them a way to mess with their already small weak spots while crouched. they gotta lower the ADS time while theyre at it too
---
You need to go to geforce experience Settings and download the experimental version and press Alt +z to select the filter in-game
---
Yet they keep you safe in your home while you sit on your ass growing tired and fat. All the while they fight for your country and risk their lives while you say it enables fascism.
---
That’s a fact 
---
I'd rather them remove shields 
---
I agree. Or enclosing the roof on the outside stair case and maybe extending the building out a little bit. I dont mind the new map at all, I just wish they would have had at least kept the same texture and colors for it. I dont like the dreariness of the new Hereford Base
---
and how is it called if you kill you whole team and the whole enemy team?
---
Thanks
---
She bit you mate
---
No it’s not because it doesn’t really give any unfair advantage as seen by rogue 9. You ever tried crouch spamming? If you hit anything it’s a miracle. A more fundamental aspect of siege is adaptation. Adapt. Aiming for the body is easier anyways. Comparing crouch spamming or even drop shotting to hacking is imbecilic 
---
I dont see proof here
---
I have had this issue too, you had any luck?
---
Lol so Xbox is filled with ddossers too
---
omg you ddos aswell repprtdd
---
I have been playing since release.... this season. Just now during this season I started actually droning properly.
---
And my frustration levels went down so much
---
That flair tho &gt;.&gt;
---
That was the hardest thing to notice, given the low video quality and nothing pointing it out
---
Yup. I was playing maverick, got 3 1 taps on oblivious enemies all watching the same door.
---
Thank you 
---
Personally use it because it turns quite a few guns into a laser when paired with a vertical grip and I like my first shots to hit when I aim. 
---
Oh the memories of fuzing that small spot that didn't actually barricade
---
RRREEEEEEE, CANT WAIT 10 MORE SECONDS
---
Exactly! Colour blindness should defo be an option
---
Cav and lion are my best but i usually play the bope ops (cav and cap)
---
Oh yeah a thing that happens every 7 games or less compared to the way of playing sounds like a dump argument 
---
ez4ence esports
---
Damn my mates and I are looking as well... but we on xbox, youse would have fit perfectly! Good luck to you guys tho!
---
That big dick energy
---
It’s the principle, not a direct comparison. 
---
Adaption to metas that are dictated by teams and operators I get. If someone doesn’t adapt to them, they’ll fall behind. 
---
But you shouldn’t have to adapt and use a cheesy ridiculous tactic to have a fair chance in a gun fight. In Rogue 9s video, it showed that MOST of the time there was no desync with the hitboxes but there were times whereby it did. This is still an issue, even if it is only a couple of instances. Plus in game, it completely different in terms of perspective. In game, if you see the enemy do it, their body is all over the place and moves erratically. But the defender themselves get a slight nudge when crouching or leaning, meaning there’s little penalty for doing this. 
---
I can’t believe people defend crouch spamming. Do people not want to win gunfights by being the cleverer player and having better positioning rather than out aiming everyone. That’s not what the game is about and it is turning this into a game like COD whereby it’s only about the weapons and the aim
---
High quality content!
---
I love when the whole family sits down to eat together!
---
can we just comment on that name?
---
Seems legit
---
And they did that without loot boxes until recently. Why defend something that only exists to exploit everyone?
---
Glazbeard
---
once you end up in ranked hell, you might as well just play casual..
---
It’s been in siege longer
---
is this actually the laziest animation I have ever seen? LOL
---
Then you have to join a 0-2 game on House where Xx_D4nkm4ng420_xX the plat 2 is 10-0 against your team of unranked playing recruits. 
---
1 destructible window? 
---
They clearly didn't feel they were on your level and you're destined for bigger greater things.

Hmm. I played the closed beta but didn't get Peacock. Then again, I didn't play in the open beta because the closed beta didn't really impress me that much.
---
We are blind fan boys because we dont care that they have some paid only loot boxes every 4 months and realize the other 95% of cosmetics can be bought with ingame currency and/or unlocked with free Alpha Packs just by playing the game?
---
And worst monetization? How? Besides these loot packs every 3 months, you can buy literally everything else directly mostly using in game currency you earn after every match or with R6 credits but you can still buy it directly without "gambling" on a pack
---
Definitely back when iq still had them... I miss those days. 
---
no to the shild, ubi promotes synergy! So get your team to use them, also barbed wire is much better with her anyway.
---
I have been playing since the beta and I'm confused
---
really?

Exploit? Get the fuck out of here they are cosmetics that affect the game literally 0%

Hello fuzed_hostage, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/afuod0/first_look_at_2019_collection_pack_not_my_pic/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It depends on the implementation. The OP didn't specify whether the prompt would appear after every TK and also didn't specify whether a single kick vote would remove the player. If the prompt appears as soon as the first TK and a single boot vote in that case results in a kick, then the system we're comparing isn't 100% boot.
---
If the boot option followed the same rules as currently exists and the benefit is just on the forgiveness side, then you're right this would be much better with no downside. Given the post is implying the solution would solve teamkilling, I'm betting the intention is this would be a one-strike you're out system and would be rife with abuse.
---
You would be able to rappel up the side of it 
---
I like this map more than Yacht.
---
Fortnite can't detect those either. There is a difference between a mouse+keyboard and a mouse+keyboard that the console recognzes as a controller and sends controller inputs through USB, in other words, m+kb that act completely like controller.
---
Fortnite separates the normal m+kb users from controller users. But it can't separate those that use adapters and emulators like xim.
---
Sure, so that still leaves my question unanswered. What is the need to prove who you are to complete strangers in a video game?
---
I think, and I could be wrong here but its the only conceivable thing that makes sense is he means the AA technique from Nvidia called DLSS where you can get 1440p performance at 4k
---
bring nitro or keep impacts
---
I think it was stealth rebuffed during Grim Sky
---
I just tried to post a meme related to r6 and i was told i couldn't because it was a meme, so i guess don't be surprised if either this gets taken down or they just shat on my just because
---
Good bot
---
Keep your dream to yourself, I have realistic views and can understand why BR in Siege would be fucking awful.
---
i think he means [this new technology by Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-dlss-new-games-september-2018/)
---
Yeah honestly no idea. I didn't know they did adopt the 686. I also didn't know they still used revolvers, as they have largely been replaced by semi autos. Thanks for the info.
---
I like how this gets 11k upvotes while serious balancing issues get no attention at all
---
There was a guy who avoided a full frontal flash by me. At first he claimed it was a trick but I'm sure it's another exploit. 
---
It was something to do with looking at the floor and suddenly at the roof and facing blitz immediately when he flashed. I don't know exactly how though.
---
Give him a "Frosty welcome" 
---
I hate Caviera. Not because she’s OP, but because my team mates NEVER seem to be able to actually use her properly and if they’re not using her properly then the site is down an operators utility. 
---
Birdbox that nigga
---
Please erase me from the 10th dimension. I want a world of bandit elites.
---
Works with anyone tbh
---
That’s not ashes job lmao, looks like gold anyways
---
But I feel like a universal skin is in a normal alpha pack and wouldn’t need a special action for the pack 
---
Thanks for the heads up🐲
---
Quit that shit
---
Thank you
---
Which sucks, since most of the stuff looks cool, that Ash skin is pretty dope.
---
Naw I got the game in skull rain and the agog wasn’t there if I’m remembering correctly
---
I bought them instore.
---
Hahahahahahhajaha rogue suck
---
That still doesn't solve the problem. Not everyone will mute him. If they all did, he can still type in chat. Nice try and false logic. 
---
Shut
---
Soooo guud
---
Again, you can’t tap at 1270 clicks a minute either, and the average engagement distance is 10 metres so...
---
Luckily the skins in these packs are pretty specific, and aside from Diet Thatcher Elite, I don't really see myself caring for most of them. 
---
And I already own Thatcher Elite

why don't you lean???

When me and my friends run a 190% we get about 800 Renown each depending on the position of the players being 1st through 5th on leaderboard the average is about 800 renown so

I would give his LMG a bulletproof shield on the front. His entire front (so head, body and legs). No small arms fire can penetrate it besides Glaz's primary.
---
It should be suicidal to attach a mounted LMG position head on.

OLD HEREFORD???? One of the best maps? How, it was terrible and so easy for attackers

---
Can confirm, I blew up the walls
---
Is this RDR2?
---
That explains things. Good aim!
---
anything that wouldnt  resemble a fucking maze like the last 4 or 5 maps.
---
Ok sorry 3 or 4 times Ash in 2 years and something from 10 to 15 times the Lord
---
And no, I’ve done more for the team with Tachanka defending the obj. instead of rushing in clueless with ash and let the team play 4v5 form the loading screed 
---
To me however, I don't mind about Kaid's dagger because it does kinda show his lore. But what I do wanted however was like if they could show his face less. And have vests pls like.... He's a 3 armor!
---
Also, fuze is also wearing a moto helm. But you have a point since it's not as obvious as the leaked aussies.
---
the audio is backwards for me and every time i jump with a drone it makes a really quiet sound. And also, when i spectate someone i cant  hear their movement or the gunshots
---
Can work, my Uncle’s at Ubisoft
---
To this day, i still want to hear the rest of Recon's story.
---
Got it around the same time but I remember using it???
---
Havent played R6 for quite some time. What happened to this map?
---
Last time i checked they removed favela
---
Yes, sorry I forgot that we could earn some with challenges  
---
Oh, wait during Halloween they gave us one or two packs and 1 with challenges ?
---
Map knowledge and call outs. Fuck your K/D, it almost (almost) doesn’t matter. I was just showing this to a new player the other day. All it takes to win a match is a single scentence. 
---
“What the fuck, they have three roamers go take site.” 
---
Kaid carry’s around the dagger because he is the commander of the Moroccan army or some shit like that.  So he basically has the dagger to show rank.
---
Imagine tryharding in casual lmao
---
That's impressive. I didn't know they actually trained that much. Handguns take a lot of practice to shoot well, so that makes sense. I would love to have that kind of budget to feed my guns 150 rounds a day.
---
F*ck
---
"Why can't you be normal?"
---
What's wring with the LFP?
---
User flair checks out!

Mama mama SPIT ON ME

I hate when it does that to me. Like oh, you didn’t need to tell me that. Just keep looking for a new game. 
---
They are called flairs. You need to add it on pc.
---
Hey, you did great staying alive....for a while.....that's something right?
---
Unless you’re counting plane as being in a airport. I’m pretty sure we don’t.
---
Paras and marines are not SF, they’re a notch above regular army. SAS and SBS saw what a dumpster fire the L85 was and stuck to M16/C8’s for their desert shenanigans. It’s fine for the game for the sake of gun variety but not realism.
---
Yes but if you are solo queing and get put with non communicative teammates who just rush and die while you try to carry you will still get fucked because you couldnt carry 1 v 5
---
Shes an absolute unit

I used the Superlux for like 2 years, but now have the Pioneers. They both sound fantastic, but the Superlux can be uncomfortable.

cos she's not

You forgot to add the nitrocell aswell
---
You should be ashamed of yourself hahahaha
---
You are part of the reason why this game is dying.
---
Well yeah, that’s what I was implying 
---
if the obj is in the corner of the map you go in from the other corner
---
you can do that?

Just start calling him Poverty until he buys it, starter edition is cheap.

I believe it came from here. Somebody make a reddit post about these a while ago. You can get any operator and I believe lesion is even on display.
---
Always a good game when it came up I found, I miss it. Don't play much casual either, so I rarely even get to play it anymore. Reckon they should add it back in next season
---
DBNO people die almost immediately after going down most of the time, I'm not sure it's necessary.
---
Thankyou 
---
Jokes on you I don't even have the game
---
They normally do a free weekend during the majors and invitationals, so probably the first half of Feburary.
---
uh you do know that picking ash doesnt mean always rushing like an idiot right? also if you do well as tachanka, its that the enemy is incompetent rather than you outplaying them. There are reasons why ash has a high pick and win rate when compared to tachanka
---
He has seen some shit
---
Oh of course my bad
---
The angles I died from were ridiculous. 
---
Don't get the starter edition. It's a horrible grind and he'll end up having to buy OPs anyway if he likes the game. You can't upgrade versions once they're bought.
---
Yes, now the two top floors are connected
---
Lol, not gonna lie, I sometimes sweat myself
---
When it only stings a bit
---
darn loved getting easy kills from that window
---
Anthonypit?
---
Like csgo
---
I mean i like the other game modes, but there shouldnt be opinions that bomb isnt the most balanced mode.
---
GIGN doesn't use that and the only reason the LFP is in the game is because it looks similar to the revolver the GIGN actually use(same thing applies to the other CTU's)
---
ah, apologies. i get pissed off too, she's picked all the time and is only good when the other team has her
---
For Tachanka we need a crown. Tbh
---
N
---
That was very recently just before thermal
---
Not just this sub thinks that Ash is fine but also most of the content creators except Bikini and almost all of the pros. Also there are way bigger problems than the picrate of Ash. To name a few Lion,Dokkaebi,Blitz,Lesion,Finka,Blackbeard. Aand there are stronger ops than her for example Jackal,Montagne,Maestro,Maverick,Zofia.
---
Your not exagrating, the other day our team was only 4 people against 5 , no one left we just started the game 4vs5 and then the enemy team was just too good i couldnt even play the fucking game
---
You mean per day?
---
Yeah voice chat tends to be fairly bad. 
---
People will make fun of you and berate you for almost anything they can. 
---
Mostly why I use the mute button, or better yet play with a friend, if they start being toxic just give calls to the enemy team. 
---
But they don't have massive open spaces and like 30 different flank routes and lines of sight. Hereford and villa may be big, but they have many rooms to compensate for the sheer size which allows for both close and long range conflicts. In Tower i feel like an acog character is a must pick to be able to challenge attackers.
---
The only time I match people higher or lower ranks than me is in casual, ranked is usually pretty fair
---
The real Yacht map
---
Lol! I wonder if you can actually cover the evil eye after Maestro is dead, to block enemy information
---
Ok, sorry I do not really master the English ;)
---
Thanks for your help !
---
she’s not overpowered. i think you’re angry because she’s a three speed with an acog. imo i think that IQ is a better operator, because her gun hits harder (the 552 Commando) and is easier to control. she also has a better gadget, and access to a claymore. but, you don’t see people complaining about her. it’s just that Ash is reliable, and easy to play
---
Capitao used to have frags, Glaz used to have breachin charges

If you can taze someone a few times and they have a doc then he will probably stim them wasting a dart. There are several attacking side weapons which leave defenders on less than 10 HP after 2 shots, so having someone down 10 health going into a fight reduces ttk and STK. If there are no gadgets to destroy where is the problem.
---
Nah just exploit a bug. Change your shadow settings I think.
---
Tower is Korean, Skyscraper is Japanese.
---
All of a sudden everyone on my team can't actually see anything as weird shapes appear and their weapons distort, all 5 men experience the same stuff as screenshot.
---
This is definitely not graphics related as the issue fixes itself at next round start and before this exploit is triggered. Bit of context.
---
1. In Casual Match
---
2. We are attacking.
---
3. We approach the area of bomb site, then all of a sudden all 5 of our screens get this happen as per screenshot.
---
4. Within 5 seconds of this happening, all defenders run out of the building and start killing us off as we have no vision/ADS
---
5. Next round starts, everything is fine, we are defending.
---
6. As attackers approach us, the shapes occur and I took the screenshot. This would occur for all 3 rounds.
---
Every single player on our team experienced this, the enemy team did not. They were aggressive when we had this happen.
---
Happened every time they were close to us breaching or they were ready to breach. I was even standing across the map and witnessed these shapes on cam so I ran up to see them physically.
---
It appears as if someone is either placing objects or screwing something up in order to win. Has this been seen before?
---
House, protect hostage, doc (to heal) and workshop. Do it solo and reinforce everything. Its how i got most wins:)
---
Online, no one cares who you claim to be. You should also just not have USMC in your name, since clearly it invites problems you can't handle. I can't stand toxicity, but if you feel the need to defend yourself against other children while playing online then fix what is causing it.
---
Counter Mav by using Kaid, put the shock stick on top, he can’t shoot it out then, and if you add a trap op in like frost, that’s another major slow down as by the time attack can get in it’ll be more of a rush
---
Nope. This is a bug that "came out" recently. I am not going to share the info how to achieve it but you can fix it immediately by reseting/changing your ingame video/graphic settings (Like Shaders I think)
---
I didn’t participate in both of them. but still have the skin. can’t remember how I got it
---
When even I figure out how to reliably spawn-peek all on my own, you know you fucked up as a map designer.
---
Just one roof hatch.... It was a death sentence....
---
Yo what year are you living in you can’t play bartlett in multiplayer anymore 
---
I always hade a hate hate relationship with it. 
---
It is in beta. 
---
Then play casual. Ranked maps need to be balanced because that's what makes the game fun and fair. Alos if it would be down to me i eould remove even more maps and use only the 7 which are zsed in PL.
---
no it was not, only one site was viable for defence. Defending anything but basement against any team with half a brain is impossible
---
Yeah that’s why I’m asking for a map buff, so then it can be in multiplayer again lol
---
Meme park has really grown on me, I guess with all the other massive maps I've adapted to its size now.  The fact that a third or so of the map is never used by anyone made learning it a lot easier.
---
Also one of the bedroom window is now concrete. Used to have 2 windows in bedroom. 
---
A guy with a turret, that must be OP I gotta use him!
---
Lol ok sir please don’t give me detention oh no my punctuation hw bout u find a really kool bookmark to shuv up ur ass (hope u n joyed my inglish)
---
mah hart, mah sole
---
Really someone would pick this nightmare over Tower?
---
I mean, I get it, Tower is a shitty map... but it's not THIS shitty. I had lots of fun with Tower tbh, way more than Yacht and Favelas.
---
The map has a really nice feel and I love the layout but it just needs more entrances 
---
You mean "Gator" skin?
---
*Blyat
---
I have never played this map in 700 hours.
---
Yeah it did before the year one ops came out
---
Syka
---
Yes
---
i had this, but i switched accounts. now my alt has it
---
I wish regular R6 ranked took skill into account.
---
Getting team with a 0 and 7 doing his placements and losing because it's basically 4on5 sucks bad enough, but to lose ELO over it as well sucks even more.
---
They need to do something like this:
---
Wins against similar ELO are +20 points
---
Wins against higher ELO are +20 and +1 for each rank tier they are above you on average (For example, your team averages silver 3 and you are against a silver 1 average, winning gives you +12 points)
---
Wins against lower ELO are +20 and - 1 point for each tier they are below you.  
---
Loses work in the same way. -20 point base and then -1 or +1 for each rank difference lower or higher respectively.
---
Base win or loss amounts could be adjusted, but the idea is there.
---
Then add some personal skill on to it.
---
\+1 point for each 1000 score (take away the winning bonus.)
---
\+1 for each kill.
---
\-1 for each death.
---
\+1 for every 2 assists.
---
\+1 for every revive.
---
\+1 for doing the objective (if you successfully save the hostage, secure the room, plant etc)
---
Slightly increase point gain for using support abilities.
---
This would in theory allow a high skilled player to rise up faster, putting him or her into the proper rank. Really bad players will not rise nearly as fast, and will fall much easier.
---
In the worst case scenario, a really good player could even still gain a handful of points on a loss, or lose very few.
---
&gt;1. No Hotbox 2. Glitched Speed
---
dude you know those are just myths right? No hotbox is straight up bullshit as you can definitely hit her. And no there is no "glitched speed", 3 speed are generally better than 3 armor as they are smaller and harder to hit.
---
If you think the 552 is better than the R4C you play console
---
*Details* BLYAT CYKA
---
You are kurwa
---
Monty at the end like "no no no no, stahhhhhp"
---
I’ve never been around for multiplayer on barlette but you can tell in their map making where they started recognizing spawn peeking 
---
i got this notif. i was like hell yeah, and then it wasnt there. i said then
---
I miss defending library. I miss Jäger acog.
---
So if the issue doesn't affect you why even comment? The people that comment are the people that care and do buy cosmetics, only to be shafted by ubi with these shitty lootboxes. Just because other people are stupid enough doesn't mean that the system is good. It's just an anti consumer practice and if you don't see anything wrong with this cosmetic delivery system you either have no morals or are just stupid.
---
How is it forbidden if a lot of people use it lol
---

Kitchen on Kafe too. If you're in bakery kitchen you can blow up the top of the wall and chuck nades in OBJ. At leats you used to be able to do that. Didn't do it in a while.

Scarecrow mask for Vigil
---
We were fooling around in the custom game, dokk hacked it and the view was obstructed, but they could still scan through it; maestro died but I'm pretty sure he could've shot them off with the evil eye.
---
Memes are easily frightened. But they'll be back, and in greater numbers.
---
Good old days 
---
People don't want to admit when they are carried. Sorry, if you don't contribute to kills, you aren't contributing enough. Every class has guns, if you can't use them play something else.

I'll trade it for Favela.

Personally I use the extended barrel and Holo/ACOG depending on the map. my friends call me a crackhead for it but I love it, if you want a more controlled gun use the ACOG and compensator
---
Uninstall reinstall
---
Because ubisoft isn't able to do something but it isn't allowed because u are way better 
---
I have 5 legendaries, WOW, Troublemaker, Angel, and 2 Plasma Pinks (1 Dupe)
---
No it just lasted for the round
---
I’ve taken down a Cav interrogating a teammate with my twitch drone...it can be useful 
---
Ah okay. Thanks
---
sadly this is more official then the official UBI forum , believe it or not, look at the amount of UBI representatives that are also mods here.
---
will this map come back one time ?
---
[My avatar to this day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/7noljm/everytime_someone_does_the_shield_bug_with_j%C3%A4ger/)

Well... that’s a first
---
He got removed in grim sky, thats not that long ago...
---
Thanks 
---
I'm pretty sure this happens, because sometimes playing cas I rage quit, and the next few games I get are ongoing
---
Nah you’re fine 
---
That's my girl! 
---
yea it had one from like 74? to 58? i believe 
---
Well..when I started playing the game,somebody said to me that I can do and be anything in this game!
---
No, outbreak was a one and done thing ubisoft said it themselves, outbreak basically ruined the game for 8 months because it created Lion
---
platform\*, my bad
---
Get a five stack of friends and play protect hostage. Play kaid and make sure everyone takes barbed wire. You can infinitely refill supplies and repeatedly place shock wire down. 
---
99% sure no. The system will ban you if you are on the same squad only
---
That's fucking nightmare fuel 
---
But I think shields need a rework completely. Leaning should be slowed down a lot and meleeing with a shield should either A) put you in down but not out or B) not be able to melee at all
---
When in doubt pick Ash 
---
Fuck they removed it??? Why
---
Something like “I pwn noobs to flex my diamond Invitational charms”
---
Posts under the fluff tag, or just singular images? Please elaborate further.
---
im thinking about an op that has a pistol when they are downed or cant be interrogated by cav
---
Cool you’re lame and ruined a game your teammates 
---
Nice Rayman skin for frost
---
You've landed on being a loser.
---
i should rephrase. i'd like to see shield ops become more supportive rather than duelists. think clash, but not as bad as clash. if blitz had his insane hitbox wiggling (cycling between sprinting, and crouch q e spamming) sorted out and his ads time gutted, he'd still be strong with a team as an aggressive roam clear, and his trusty flash melee combo would be just fine too.
---
Aside from seeing through smoke and being unbreakable from the front (hell most of the time side shots too) its a pretty usefull gadget. Also if you set it up as bait (pinging team) its great to watch them turn their backs to break it, then die from being distracted.
---
I don't mind that the game accidentally puts 11 players in a game and kicks one, why the heck doesn't it just put me back in the queue? 
---
Doubly shitty is that it doesn't even notify that the game took you out of queue, so you can start the queue, alt tab, go ten minutes without a game, tab back and see that fucking message. 
---
Posts titled "Let's confuse all new players" or variations on that idea.
---
I hated this map but now I miss it, the new maps are so fucking boring.
---
However bad old Hereford was at least it had character. The new maps are just squares with square rooms, no difference between floors, in and out.
---
It has been done times before already. I’m not an R6S developer but I doubt that it is that hard to implement a bipod that can be deployed on surfaces. It just looks like a lame excuse because that probably won’t help Tachanka. 
---
Can you give me the source in which they say that it is an “engine limitation”?
---
The real question is why are you in the library
---
Me and my friends always play custom games there now. Pretty fun tbh
---
Yeah I got the starter edition cause was swapping over from xbox. Had like 700 hours on xbox so I figured ill unlock or pay money for more operators and this is all I can afford right now. It gave me ash and mute so those became my top play characters. Was fun watching people call me smurf or hacker cause I shot them once and was skilled for a level 10
---
Putting a frost mat under a bulletproof camera will occasionally catch people running up to melee it, plus if you're on the cam you get a pretty funny clip.
---
Yea I could sort of figure that out thanks to the caption
---
Ok thanks for the help
---
Well done fella! Wouldn’t mind having you on my team 👍
---
Thank you!
---
You didn't ace tho...
---
Yep that’s what I said 
---
Oh I get it now lol, good job though dude, that bandit can burn!
---
Lets Confuse Good Players. "Look at his charm"

One of my top 3 favourite maps. I miss it

Because if they all harmed their own team, no one would play them.

Too bad you think that,quess I am not going to buy Lesion and become a Lesion main like you :3

-1 for sticking his mic up his nose lol. *shhhhhhhh fffffffffff ssshhhhhhh ffffffffd* *GLAZ SHUT THE FAHOOZIE UP!*
---
mods will delete it. this sub is only for shitty normie memes
---
Best map in the game honestly
---
Well you see, this is rainbow six siege, and nothing makes sense, for example, when you clearly dome someone but you die as well and your bullets don't do shit
---
I had to do it to em.
---
See this would be great to have kept in the game. Would make it feel more alive. 
---
Frosts SMG at point did more damage per bullet then Blackbeard’s rifle. You don’t wanna go down this road.
---
Cav's interrogation counts as a secondary(??? its not her gadget
---
Does not exist sadly :(
---
Tower was never in Pro League.
---
I always try to use it, but I'm never close enough to the attackers for it to work.
---
The crouching is the problem
---
My problem is they are too large, waaayyy too large to learn the callouts for, I still don’t get the callouts for villa hereford, or even fucking theme park
---
Pretty impresive for one of the oldest Rainbow 6 operators,but Kaid takes a golden medal for that competition..
---
*You’re you inbred heathen. 
---
🙀
---
But what’s your defense to it being a ‘shit idea’? Yes if you find some master hiding spot to put a fucking foot by foot camera and it can see something useful fine, but most places you’d put it have to be out in the open as it’s a fixed angle so in order to get a good view it needs to be visible. Adding an auto ping so that it could act as an alarm system would add a simple utility to the gadget without overpowering it or changing it drastically. If you want to claim that the gadget is perfect as it is, then go watch some pro league or top ranked streamers and see just how often a bullet proof cam gets brought. 
---
He deleted it, so might have happened.
---
There have been cases, for example, that players got double the six points, or just got them out of nowhere.
---
This guy has gotten something better , and good for him I guess.
---
I don't know how it's possible, but stuff happen.
---
Doc can res himself
---
This would be great but meanwhile Ubisoft can’t even fix bugs and take ranked out of beta...
---
He looks like he's seen shit
---
But incredible technique there, man, could never do that (because im a digital art pleb). Definitely a well-deserved Kudos
---
&gt; But what’s your defense to it being a ‘shit idea’?
---
"In that you don't want pings automatically."
---
&gt;If you want to claim that the gadget is perfect as it is
---
When did I say anything of the sort?
---
It's used regularly on certain maps/sites/setups in PL...
---
HAHAHa, remember everyone begging for this map then begging for it to be removed once it got implemented. Oof
---
Happened to me as sledge, I actually quite liked it
---
That is definitely a big problem with plane; for attackers it can be at least partially solved by letting them use the exterior of the plane, but it is kind of hard to work around for the defenders; it's hard to surprise attackers when you can usually only come from 2 directions. 
---
Agreed. Peeker's Advantage is negligible alone (and has drawbacks, like the "shadow" that can be shot when you already moved) but the ducking makes the speed-leaning impossible to predict.
---
Bring all maps back to Ranked!
---
I was playing the situation on this map and I just had flashbacks the whole time about how fun this map was before it got changed 
---
BRING BACK BARTLETT!
---
The track probably leads to a big cardboard box held up by a stick with paella or churros as bait and some gu-mines to finish it off
---
Not a solution that I like but the CS devs added a slowdown mechanic every time you crouch within a small window.
---
Not everything. Clash does 5dmg so she needs 4 "shoots" to kill you when you re downed 
---
Nice but why does it feel like my ranked games are more sweaty and try hard then this. I didn’t see a single person quick peek or crouch peek.
---
Finka's infected headgear. In total I have like around 5 or something
---
yes but it is like a edd so it is easy to counter, only people who arent watching out will be caught so the punishment is longer and i like the idea of the galil for a primary however it is an ar.
---
I'm feeling you. I stopped playing right after Lion and Finka, and just redownloaded the game, and I'm loving it again. Alibi and Maverick are my new mains, they're so fun.
---
Nothing holds a candle to Coastline or fortress
---
I dislike crouch-spamming too but it's not that hard to counter, just aim at chest level and dump the mag 8/10 times you will get a hs. Also Rouge 9 made 2 videos about this tactic and he explains that it isn't as good as it looks. 
---
Na fam im with you, I love that map
---
Yeah it honestly kinda just sucks
---
I am verry confused how do you know about autiforces?
---
tfw I was in alpha &amp; beta and didn't get either of my skins... Same crap for GR Wildlands, played beta and didn't get my special items, still upset about it tbh.
---
I had the exact Same problem with the freeze. I got it after upgrading my CPU. I tried troubleshooting but I got no real fix. I was recommended resetting my pc, deleting files and it fixed the problem. If you are willing to try reseting your computer just remember to put all important files on your drive.
---
Being boosted by a cheater is a bannable offense, if Ubisoft does it's job, then you will get banned, if you have to question whether it's okay, then it's probably not, just lose some elo and be safe
---
I still want the polish map
---
This trend right now on this sub isn’t even funny 
---
Can someone explain to me what is going on?  I haven't played the game in a couple months and everyone is just posting pictures of old maps?  
---
Are they no longer in the game or something?
---
No, if theres NO gadgets to destroy (Vigil, Tachanka, Doc, Rook, Clash) ir People not placing gadgets then yes, i will shock with my drone. You’re the noob if you think it doesnt help.
---
In my opinion theme park is the dead middle most mediocre map in the game.  With tower being the map directly below it in badness.
---
oh god
---
lol. no.
---
This was my favorite :/
---
Can't be that satisfying --- Ela didn't take it. 
---
I’m so glad this map isn’t in the rotation anymore. It was never designed with Multiplayer in mind, so it was super lopsided. 
---
Damn, you really carried! Good job xD
---
disgusting 
---
Well yeah, this game was a bit of a stomp, the only round we lost was the one before this and we completely threw it
---
Legos hurt man
---
🤭
---
But did you play on Mplayer or MSN Zone.
---
MSN Zone was my shit.
---
No :)
---
Hm, yeah that makes sense. That being said casual needs a 'buff' to keep people from leaving.
---
Choosing spawns, reducing the timer to 3 minutes, knowing what site you'll defend and being able to toggle off certain maps (people often leave instantly when it's Tower or Favela).
---
Ahh the good ol days
---
Shocking people almost always guarantees your drone gets destroyed. Drones are one of the most valuable gadgets in the game. You're a noob.
---
i already resetted it, dowloaded everything again, same problems when i'm trying to stream, i have a lot frame drop in game, but the stream is ok, is just my game 
---
While it may technically be true that spamming center-mass with a high RoF helps to counter it, it is not the essence of a game rewarding headshots and SERIOUSLY disadvantages guns with slower RoF like Frost/Cav SMG.
---
And it sure as hell feels like it's a good tactic when my old-man-reflexes and years of counterstrike (AIM FOR THE HEAD) get me killed...
---
I fucking hate Bartlett 
---
Not true. There are games that do sync.
---
I keep trying to hit the “X” on the picture 
---
Exactly, sometimes you can even ignore people on site if your team covers you, you just grab the hostage and run. I don't understand why people hate this mode, it's not very competitive but it's so much fun.

Ducking/leaning spam
---
You do understand that what you're saying is statistically impossible?
---
You would have to play every single match to 9 rounds and get defense in your overtime every time in order for this scenario you're presenting to be honest.
---
And you have a 50/50 for offense or defense in overtime.
---
Oh shit, really?
---
Or place is somewhere and leave it to use later on in the round.

---
They also removed 2 roof hatches (CCTV and Gym) covered up the Cash window, turned the Garage ladder into stairs and added a window between CCTV and garage, the rest of the changes are minor
---
Only need a good Maestro and A Doc on any map. I worked for me. PS If Doc, only heal people if under 50 HP
---
No problem, guess it really is alpa pack only

damn i cant even come close to how that might feel
---
im sorry
---
Did they make Nomads mines bigger?
---
Loved this, and rogue spear. Pve coop on the snow map.
---
I have it

I still like this version. It's different enough from the current Hereford that it would be nice if it was still available in custom games.
---
I really was with the shits.my stats don’t mean shit? So I’ve never finished diamond so that means I can’t complain about mnk users?? Lol I couldn’t care about winning or losing anymore even a casual game is disgusting with the amount of mnk users...

The squares were better man

Have you ever played with 200 ping? no? then dont complain

Holy shit. Thats awesome

Most buildings are squares though.

also if you can't find it at the mp5k or elite section,check universal skins

It's always been a strat.

I can hear the music

I have the antique skin for the UMP and it’s looks gross for a legendary

There was a map, called university or something like that.
---
Now the map is ded
---
It's insanely defense sided and bookshelves everywhere so the whole map looks the same
---
Just try and pick what you like

Siege is meant to be played with a squad. My friends all ditched siege for destiny 2 when it came out and I raged because of what you are saying. But I made some new friends and got my friends back into it and have no complaints about it. U gotta find a squad because the land of solo queueing can suck major dick

It is just for her Aug. I main IQ and the skin looks like shit.

Best comp map NA. No rework needed 👌🏻
---
Now about half the players play on k and m so its basically a console vs PC war on ranked
---
What is the universal? Haven't seen it 
---
This is viable but so is this other solution I remember seeing:
---
If you get placed as backfill you should be given an extra 50 renown per round you joined at the end of the game. So if you joined on round 4/5 you’ll get 200 renown (50 x 4 = 200).
---
This would make it so the community becomes less salty about joining ongoing matches.

Overwatch too
---
I noticed that Right now at gold 3 I am apparently in the best 20 K players on xbox so I assume that there are less players on ranked now sow there is not enough players to support about 2 thousand diamonds so a lot of plats are in gold instead, it's like plat is new diamond and gold is new diamond as there is not enough good players to sustain the general skill rank. My theory 
---
Ewwww this map.
---
The amount of times I've clutched as attackers on that map is ridiculous, so id beg to differ.
---
Also favela, new Herford, old Herford, and kanal all look the same inside.
---
Thank you for your service. They obviously have problems of their own. While some scumbags think that being in the military makes you a bad person, with your service you are helping to protect a lot of people that are thankful for it, even though it might not seem like it.

To the people reposting this..
---
you should get uses to it or use a phone instead of alt tabbing, its a "feature" added to siege
---
What system?
---
Yep, first level of the original R6... The Embassy Assault if I recall...
---
Still go back to it on my dreamcast every now and then...
---
Only Y1 ops are 15K Y2 and Y3 are still 25K
---
Oh thank you &lt;3

lol just me, maybe not the first one because I suck at spawn peaking but

Couldn't agree with you more. It would at least make the types of worthless teenagers who cheat at these games a little more apprehensive of doing so.

Personally I think jackal is a good option. His PDW and C7E are solid weapons although I prefer the C7E (I think it’s called) and his ability is helpful when countering roomers

Play it , I swear this game will break you to the point where you might leave siege for it
---
Those aren't the best but at least they have some depth to them. Like they have normal maps. Elephant doesn't have shit. It's just a single net texture repeated over the entire weapon. 
---
Just make lone wolf available again in digital stores...
---
Of course, I'm a dumbass.  I only play ranked too, it's just been a long day for me haha

This needs to get in the face of some at UBI ASAP! The matchmaking is a problem and it needs more playlist and for fuck sake come out of BETA! 
---
thats autistic
---
Yeah they do thia ive seen this too
---
I wouldn’t recommend it. Mine worked great for about a year. Then the bumper snapped off (a fairly common problem I hear), then I got stick drift on one stick, then the grips started to come off, all within the same month. And I take insanely good care of my stuff, I never do much as drop it, I never eat while playing, etc...
---
I never could get used to the paddles, so I mostly used it for the trigger stops and because it had replaceable sticks (the only thing that ever wore out on my normal controllers was stick grips), so I figured an elite would be worth for that alone. But no, replacement grips alone cost as much as a standard controller. So I just went back to them. I do miss my trigger stops though.
---
You can post that but I cant? Fuck y'all mods

As the Lion player you might not get much of a personal benefit by using the scan in spawn, but your teammates will have an advantage while you can be jerking off in spawn.

---
It's the competitive rules. Some HUD elements are disabled, such as point popups ("+50 Injure", the yellow texts you get on the right hand side while doing something where you get points from) and the Versus counter you mentioned. It makes the competitive games a bit more challenging and requires more teamwork, as well as attention to small sounds and visual cues.
---
Imo, I believe that I would still advocate for a change with how the packs are run even if the game was actually patched properly. Id just play less attention to it than I do now. Personally I like the blizzard approach to their seasonal boxes as well as boxes in general. I can either pay or play for a chance (although getting enough gold to ensure a skin is yours is another kind of grind -\_-). It sucks that so much is paywalled and at such prices (i think even the reknown prices are crazy \[Prolly to entice those booster purchases\]). There's a few skinds i'd even love to get but knowing it could cost me like $10-$15 for the bundles just puts be off. At this point I just take what i can get for my time and put no more money into the game since i feel little incentive from the devs to do so.
---
Yeah its possible just for anyone who isnt on siege 24/7 its really hard especially with so many thats why i really likr bank and cosulate and cafe and all thosr
---
Yes.
---
Your right so fuze 
---
What about if it marks enemies like Alibi every .5 seconds for 2 seconds. Vigils cloak would avoid detection and anyone within range of a mute. 2 charges like now.
---
It's fanmade. 
---
I know i perfer the original too
---
Thank you , I'm glad you liked this 
---
I also wondered why flinching isn't a thing already since it makes sense 
---
Check out Insurgency: Sandstorm. Literally has so many if these features you mentioned it's insane.
---
I just realized im a dumbass there is ingame voice in the clip rofl 
---
Get with the times old man, consoles can do this again
---
Oh wait did I mistype it ?
---
They were ranked around plat 2, plat 3 IIRC. I played in the team that is defending on this clip.
---
&gt;Defenders will be annihilated easily , since you're fighting with 9mm bullets , 45 ACP and all of these small calibers against .308s , 7.62s and 5.62 calibers .
---
All of those calibres would suck to get shot with at the sorts of ranges you're fighting at in Siege. .
---
Let’s make a system where we punish people for excessively leaving in casual, problem solved
---
&gt;getting shit in the ass  
---
where else do you want me to put it

It's odd isn't it.

what do you get by having a "clean" sub do you play the game go to ranked and casual get tk get insulted get the real experience
---
get frustrated for how long takes a multi million dollars company fix something in what's probably their biggest ip

Thank you.
---
That's what I'm gunning for right now. Im enticed to purchase the invitational packs when they come out but I honestly really don't want to because I know the quality of the game will not change anytime soon 
---
How come this is taken out of all rotations but tower is still E X I S T E N T
---
You have to link you’re twitch and I play accounts and you’ll get you’re drops automatically depending on how many hours you watch
---
I wish this map would come bacc 
---
I think there should be just one ranked mode and new maps should be excluded from the ranked playlist, other than that this change would be nut worthy
---
EMBARASING! 
---
Wow! I really love and at the same time i hate barlett lol
---
What about if I'm poor? 🤔🤔🤔
---
If this game was realistic we'd spend 10 hours standing around during negotiations in a stand off before starting a round. Then we'd all be recruits, not people in bright yellow CBRN out fits using stupid ass gadgets. 
---
Thats terrorist hunt lmao
---
you register, https://drops-register.ubi.com/en-US/login
---
once your uplay and twitch are together then all you have to do is watch whenever the drops are happening(currently they haven't announced if its happening), and by that I mean whatever date the twitch drops are, you just have to watch the stream
---
it's hard to explain but below the video, in green it will say like "twitch drops are active" or something like that
---
Slow it down so macros aren't as effective.
---
So basically on there channel there will be a link to a webpage where you can link your Ubisoft account and your twitch account together and then when it says your all set if you watch the stream you have a chance to get something but it is important to see if they are actually giving stuff away first
---
My idea here is that a rifle calibre would kill faster than a small one .
---
The pay off is that a defender knows where to hold and players should leave roaming and lurking for those like VIGIL , JAGER who carry assault rifles , so the defender will likely do the first shot .
---
Sure it would such but the TTK will be lower on attack
---
Yep
---
[Are you talking about this?](https://www.reddit.com/user/LiberDBell/comments/afzjcr/mute_skin/?utm_source=reddit-android)

If so, I got mine from a pack, but I believe you can just buy it.
---
I'm looking at razor wolverine atm. Elite seems to sh*t the bed prematurely 
---
not sure how I'm meant to know that
---
Ok that makes sense. Is that something ubi does on their end or can a casual player like myself go into my game settings and change things like this? Id keep the injure, points, etc but idk something about seeing "1v5" just gives me so much anxiety.  
---
There's a button for that.
---
Only one issue, I don’t have the time in my day to play a game till 7 wins, if they put this system in they’ve lost me as a customer, I simply do not have the time to play that much
---
That link may not show up until a few weeks when invitational starts
---
They have got to slow down all stance changes if not also add a diminishing returns system to prevent it from being spammed.  Unless someone is stationary holding an angle, there is no way to deliberately aim for and land a headshot with this shit in the game.
---
maybe post invitational
---
Same for me but on villa and Hereford 
---
Bute, bute, bute bute bute

Nah. I also got this on some floors or different walls

G502
---
The game is a simulation , while adding realism to the mix and keeping the looks all the same it'll end up like what I described .
---
Agree but no pick and ban. 
---
I remember this map.
---
Yes i already bought it now, thanks for the effort though
---
I literally got some of the ideas from the game , especially the shots to kill one
---
I’m on it a lot, and its just that as time goes on it gets increasingly hard to learn maps because of a smaller chance to get these new giant maps so less time to learn it
---
Will there be different rankings for both variations or the same?
---
I'll go with g502 , thank you all !
---
The amount of times I got killed from one of the like 4 windows looking into the spawn area was ridiculous

Ah the early version of alibi, her long lost brother that died for all our tk sins. May hé r.i.p.

Not everyone plays at a high level and I imagine it would just lead to toxic behaviour definitely in lower ranks.

Also a walkie talkie

Then you wouldn't really be hit with say a time penalty since you're already getting off to do something else. A short time penalty would just end well before you go on again.
---
I don‘t have problems hearing the muffled footstep sounds above me (lets say on Chalet) but if I would stand outside under the balcony and the enemy would shoot and/or jump out of the window I just can‘t tell where the shots or the footsteps are coming from...

So punch holes on floorboards and walls?

As a Finka main, I love this

Let just let this map burn in Hell and never bring it back

Sorry if this sounds stupid, what does it mean if a console is "Bricked"?
---
I get it's douchey, and I'm not complaining about the ongoing matches I get. I'm just saying that is a cause of getting the ongoing matches
---
Probably because of Maverick being released only to be insanely OP on Favela (encouraging people to buy him).
---
Favela was released when the only hard breacher was Thermite.  Now attackers can pick Thermite, Hibana and Maverick and Favela is basically a complete joke.
---
At least when Favela released, it was possible to runout and kill Thermite and win the round on Defense.
---
Swat is better than the original rainbow six games

I don't know what PL games you've been watching but maestro has one of the highest ban rates of defense operators in PL. Due to the ban bullet proof cams are a highly picked load out unless they are roamer.

Castle and doc almost always carry cams.

2 ranks would make the wait times too much for higher levels and smurfing would be even more done. Just making the comp changes to normal ranked would be way better and simpler.

---
Oohhhhhhh thanks I’m not really up to date with the lore
---
I honestly don't see why people think it's that bad of a map.  Maybe cause I'm a bomb only player, so there's really only sites rooms they will have when that map comes up, so I never found it confusing at all to navigate around. And there are plenty of entry ways for the attackers to get in without getting themselves killed. If they're afraid of roamers being around, they could just use jackal to see footprints or (and I hate myself for saying this) a lion to keep them in place so you can enter the building.
---
It uses skill rating to match. Not the rank which is simply time spent playing. If it matched by time spent playing, it would not be good. Does this mean that you will never end up in an unbalanced game? No. But trust me, you don't want to matchmake the other way. 
---
That would solve literally nothing and this mindset is what makes casual a terrible place for players.
---
Don't join random parties...

Why the fuck would you go from pc to console?

Not everyone watches pro league or is into the game enough to care, they just know that the site needs to be reinforced and they do just that. Nothing anyone can really do about that other than you communicating with your teammates
---
Yes it is... xmas n00bs didn't even see this version of the map.
---
You sort be new
---
Imagine Lord Chanka camping in a dark corner on a map at nighttime and all you see is two purple lights, then all of a sudden a red light then you die...
---
I am not new
---
They removed Hereford base and replaced it with a New much more polarizing “reworking” of it. 
---
Personally I hate the new one. I would probably only dislike it if it was just an additional map, but they removed the old Hereford map so now I can’t even play the old one which I preferred immensely to the new one. New Hereford is confusing to navigate, has almost nothing significant to help identify one room on any floor from any other room, and they made it bigger for no justifiable reason other than “big good for competitive”. I get that old Hereford was unbalanced and a second staircase would have been justified, but honestly people insisting it was some unplayable garbage map are being pedantic whiners. 
---
Bring back BU and take Favela back to the depths of hell.
---
My friend got me Siege for my PS4. I also assumed he would invite to congratulate me or something because it happens often on PC all chat.

I know they’re a bit rubbish but those are my two favourite maps. I also really enjoy House. No matter how many flaws are identified playing on those maps is FUN.
---
But you sort by it

Hey now, there’s at least 2 windows and 1 hatch....

Never mind

I wonder who took that spot (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
Yeah that's how they get your ip and boot you
---
I remember trieng it on a old PC few months ago. Hehe
---
Omg so cool! Nobody has ever done this! WOW
---
this works on some spots, but keep in mind that ranked/casual is not pro league and have different strats. Also sounds like you dont have 5 stack and pro league has good communication and that might affect it
---
I never called you new?
---
Its either spamming two buttons thoughtlessly or using a macro, otherwise known as not skill.
---
Yacht was actually my favorite map for years, was sad when they removed it from rank.
---
It sounded like it
---
I remember losing an overtime match with this shit. Glad its been slaughtered.

Mmmmm that shading is so nice

How is playing it in a glorified tutorial level supposed to fill the hole in my heart?

CASUAL ROUNDS ARE TOO LOOOOOOOOOONG, Let us pick our spawns plzz
---
You made a typo saying "5.62" ammo, you meant "5.56"    
---
.308 and 7.62 are basically the same calibers.   
---
Hahahaha this post is so uninformed. Yeah Ubisoft is going to make *another* ranked server queue and then ban recently released operators. 
---
Hard lmao. 
---
Rename this post to "proof: I can stay salty about specific operators for an entire photoshop session" 
---
You could do that. But imo it's not really worth giving the enemy a free peek hole and this hole won't be the reason you hear the enemy and know where they are coming from. It can be useful in some places, but personally I wouldn't do it with walls unless you plan on listening to it specifically
---
:/ I invited him to my party. Never again I guess
---
I would make "Classic Ranked an unranked game mode with the current ranked rules just an environment for players who don't like the environment of ranked but can be competitive

I played for a few hours yesterday and out of 20 or so games, 2 of them were from the lobby; the rest of them I joined in progress.

The only problem I can see with this system is that a few days ago my router kept cutting out and dropped me from games (or maybe they already have this system in place I was being punished?).
---
Becauae yeah, they should. Especially considering improving the game would be much more appreciated than a Tachanka bundle.
---
Yeah I got the same problem. When I click "equip all" nothing happens either

---
Hahaha that's so fucking rad! You found the exact hat and everything! 👍👍
---
This needs to happen. 
---
It obviously isn’t that simple tho, I’m sure if ubi could just fix major problems in the game with the same amount of resources as a tachanka bundle they would. 
---
As someone just learning the game I think my top two complaints are:
---
1. No automatched multiplayer mode allows you any choice in map selection. When you are jumping between a list of 20 maps and playing casual with only 3 to 5 lives in a row on the same map, it is incredibly difficult to actually learn maps - which as we all know, is a major separator of skill in this game. So it feels like I'm caught in this loop of forever sucking. I know allowing map selection is tough, because it could end up like CSGO where 50% of games played are on dust 2 and remaining games are only on a couple of other maps - but there has to be some fair mechanism.
---
2. On a related note, casual and and to some degree ranked are both _very_ short game modes. I get the idea, ubi may want to keep games under 30 minutes to make it easy to drop in and out from the game, but IMO that really hurts the game. These short lifecycle games compound making if difficult to actually learn the game. Switching maps every 3 to 5 lives is really frustrating - its really tough to get in any rhythm with a team. At the very least there should be some longer, fully featured game mode with some type of map selection.
---
Casual is not meant to prepare you for ranked. Its meant to be casual. Stop saying this.
---
Ranked is what prepares you for ranked.
---
Wait, there's a uniform?
---
look closer
---
There is a massive chunk of theme park in which litterally nothing occurs. No objective and not a good rotation route either

He’s downvoted because withholding petty information while boasting about a C4 spot. Two people asked and he wouldn’t answer as if he’s trying to make sure other people don’t know exactly where. It would have been better to not even respond than to respond with dodgey answers.

I’d rather see a new game mode inbetween ranked and casual since they are like night and day to each other. Something where you can pick spawn locations but rounds only go to 4, something like that

I'm down with all but the grace period for new operators. I mean I payed for those operators, if I can't play em on the freaking game even competitive side it's really like saying that their game is garbage. I already am boycotting proleague this season because of this. What was fun with new season is new ops and the meta shift. Now we gotta endure 6 months of the same shit. Sorry I'm out of this bull

Its a rip of CSGO. Given its popularity, I understand the sentiment
---
lol right
---
I'd rather have a few maps with special rules in Casual than wait for Ubisoft to rework it.  It's very unlikely that we'll see a Favela rework soon, and this would at least make the map playable.
---
Now move the lower one down so he doesn't have an angle from his eyes to the other player at all. The higher player will still be able to see the top of the lower player's head.
---
You're also assuming that the player cam is in the eyes...
---
Good, I'd rather they spent time on better maps.
---
Jesus christ you really are dumb...
---
They're limited time only 
---
The game says i already own it somehow, i check, snd its nowhere to be seen. 
---
What? I can't hear anything
---
Not too bad at all :). I usually only say yes to Ranked when I'm wasted tbh cuz I end up being dumb enough to go into it lmao. One night ended up playing Ranked with a friend and some low silver or even coppers in his group, I hadn't done placements or anything yet so I did that absolutely hammered and got Gold right off the bat lmao. Go into casual later with that rank and then kids bitch about how my rank is a lie lol. Another time I only did 7/10 placements smashed as tits and we decimated all of the matches still cuz we were playing against golds. I'll just stay unranked cuz idc, that's how dumb ranked can be. Most of the time it's AIDs Meta, unstable server connections so people drop and then it's 3v5 4v5. Then add running into chances of running into hackers. Just not a very fun experience IMO. 
---
You don't like your whole team getting decimated by a spawnpeeker or what?
---
We know the rest you 4-0 them ace every single round I'm tried of seeing these types of stories 
---
Love it

F for Bartlett, I never thought it was bad enough to be removed, especially since favela is and tower STILL EXIST and favela got taken out of the game only to be put back in with no changes at all

I don't think lean spamming is that much of a big deal. Remove the crouching problem and see where we are.
