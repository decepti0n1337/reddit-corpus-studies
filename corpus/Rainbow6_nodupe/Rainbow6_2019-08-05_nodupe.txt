---
Everyone get 2000+ ping all of sudden so you cant move but the timer still counts down. we basically cant do anything, easy win for them
---
Yikes, that's toxic. Then again, not like I should expect less from a good chunk of the Siege community. You've already made enough of a fool of yourself, and you're obviously the most stubborn thing on this earth because you're so butthurt. Not worth my time to argue anymore. Have fun stewing in your toxic sludge.

Nice work.

Buncha trashcans

Yeah i know but the other 4 people could‚Äôve just chilled but you know how it is, they all acted like idiots but Monty was last so he gets all the blame lol

I dont get this do people get more xp now?? My girlfriend played 300 hours and she is level 90 i have 1018 hours and im  level 167 gold 1 she is copper 1 and my friends just bought the game like a week ago and they are already level 30
---
Buncha trashcans, it's funny that people are that desperate to win a video game
---
i just got nomad a couple days ago, love playing her. except for her guns. they're both horrible.
---
Honestly
---
How about no?
---
That feature is so annoying. I never surrender. Surrendering is for the weak
---
vigil probably
---
I understand that it's not a huge problem, because she is pretty balanced, but i just think smokes or flashbangs could be replaced for her claymore.
---
It constantly have the lowest ping in my games and I start defender pretty often
---
Happy little accidents :)
---
So basically a fuze and nomad combined? Not op at all
---
No
---
What if we used 100% of the brain
---
*screams in reinforced wall besides my mirror*
---
That would be way too overpowered. Not to mention adding lion and ying into the mix. Nothing the defenders could do.
---
Im guessing people got banned for it?

Mira is a hard breacher
---
lmao, Ela isn't even close to being the worst defender in the game. castle, warden, and tachanka are in far worse spots.
---
the scorpion isn't even close to being the worst primary overall, the M12 or AUG A3 are worse
---
it's a pistol, its not supposed to be great. it's bad stats are balanced out by the fact that it's one of the 2 handguns that can equip a sight
---
barbed wire and a deployable shield are literally perfect for her kit, wire works extremely well with her mines
---
her mines aren't even close to lackluster, I really don't know why you think this. a long-lasting concussive effect is very good
---
you left out the fact that the FO-12 is probably the best shotgun in the game, that thing shreds
---
If placed at nearly the same time will a Mira window be prepped before the charge combust

It sure does

One time I was playing Border and was downstairs in the server area underneath the hatch. It was a 1v1 and I heard someone walking but couldnt pinpoint it. I look up through the hatch and there was spooky Cav staring down at me. I almost shit myself...

I‚Äôm speaking from an Xbox perspective FYI. Late night seems to be best. Especially if solo queuing. If you‚Äôre with a stack of any sort, it‚Äôs very doable if your team works as a team

So putting the psd/png file of the RFF icon on a meme template took a while to make? Riiight...

Id honestly say that the skill level is basically the same in the middle ranks, the difference is that on console youre hindered by the controller itself. People try to make good plays and struggle to pull them off due to lack of fluidity.
---
You can‚Äôt force someone to stay in a game, the only solution is a 5 stack.
---
Could be GPU dying
---
Oh yeah stacks are always a plus. I'm on PC so I usually just group with randoms as we play through matches together but I'd bet the issue is kids playing on sub par laptops who just screw off since the game isn'r running optimally.
---
Why infinite ammo in prep? I'd be in favour of reducing overall ammo but if you did it, it would have to have impact on all parts of game, prep phase inclusive

There's a new bug where there's no reinforcement on your screen but for everyone else there is. You can shoot through it but you can't walk through it. Also how did you all die from 1 by 1 headshot from Cav's pistol? Even if you get shot in the head it downs you.
---
There aren't any hackers on console
---
I think it was your problem, maybe for a lag moment the game thought you were actually in the wall but you weren't.

preplant, how can i avoid it? someone watching an important rotate? 
---
no it cant be avoided, that the same argument as for lion 'just stand still' or for blackbeard 'just shoot his body' there are situations in which you have no controll if you can avoid certain things. and thats why upside down repel (or rather the cam/eye thing) has to be chanced.

The pings also aren‚Äôt the same, or even especially close. But no way the user names are a coincidence. Could be a VPN, on the assumption Ubi has some rule in place to prevent people from the same IP being on opposite teams. Or it could be two dinks just coordinating with each other. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing the scheme is to queue at the same moment connected to the same server and try to get in opposite sides of the same game. Which is an utterly stupid amount of effort for what‚Äôs likely to be a low success rate. Maybe he had two other laptops with two more accounts trying the same thing. Either way, a dink.

r/dogelore
---
That makes sense but also it's more likely than not confirmation bias you only remember getting Hereford alot cause you dislike the map when in reality you get it the same as others () but I mean they aren't random they percent chance is how ever many maps there is divided by 100% that's the chance you have of getting them. For example we'll say it's 15% chance for every map and if they reduced Hereford by 5% then spread that 5% they took of Hereford to the rest of the maps everyone will get it less
---
Just like the simulations
---
Just run PDW with laser and hipfire the walls where scans are and it's like a guaranteed kill
---
Honestly dude you just should look into playing on Xbox or pc, from what I've seen ps4 has some not too smart players (no hate ps4 players fr) from what I've seen. Even diamond gameplay it looks like they are coppers. Or just try getting up a good squad.

I disagree.
---
No one?
---
I feel that would be hard to implement since you would have a higher chance of getting a different map then, and then people would actually starting to see the same map over and over again. 
---
Anyways, I‚Äôve just been curious as to what the community would do to make the maps better besides bringing back the original or just outright removing them since that seems like a waste of resources on Ubisofts end since they did have to spend the time and resources to make the maps.
---
But the tachanka mains sir
---
Mp5, but I use the P90 for kicks sometimes, plus I have black ice for it.
---
*MAXIMUM EFFORT*
---
The overall objective of the attackers would make it so that if shields were like that, they would be absolutely harmless. They would have no way of defending themselves, and their pick rates would drastically sink. Clash is only like that to make her different from Montagne and because she‚Äôs a defender with a shield, which would be extremely unbalanced.
---
I don't mean in game, lol
---
OK, thanks!
---
That wouldnt make it random tho
---
Literally Copper Elo
---
then why do you almost never seen him played except in casual?
---
Yeah that's true, and idk I like Hereford and I'd hate for them to remove such a "new" map of they can get rid of it as long as we get Bartlet U back
---
Do tell me how an imbalanced site or hallway is "suddenly" viable. It's not. Like.....it's rather obvious (VERY obvious) that chalet is the most imbalanced map in siege. Bar and bedroom are bullsh*t easy to attack, and you can hold both stairs with just one angle which is very bad.
---
You lose big garage control and bar control for basement site you're screwed. And big garage is easy to take. Bar hatch is the bane if anybody rotating between sites. There is absolutely no safe rotation between sites in the basement.
---
And you might "find" the map viable, but if it really was viable, then it wouldn't have been booted at the highest level of play.

If your saying he stole it and just changed the bottom image then I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. This meme format where it has the different games‚Äô bullet drop off is already used a lot and I can link an example or two of it. Then if they had the same idea and happened to make similar memes then it isn‚Äôt a repost. I‚Äôm only siding with op so I can understand why people said he reposted this because all of the comments I‚Äôve seen are kinda confusing
---
It's almost like the root of toxicity is the game itself. Over the years it has oriented more and more towards team-play, so when you go onto console, and every single teammate is terrible because nobody knows what they are doing on console, then you start to understand where the frustrations arise from.

Ok dude. I didn't mean to come across as an angery vegetal, but the thing is, there are so many console players posting random clips everyday and bogging down this subreddit with gameplay and HAHAHAHAH FuNNNy. I just wish this sub had moderators who would promote discussion and the pro-league over mind numbing casual garbage. You look at this subreddit compared to the LoL sub or the CS sub and it is embarrasing.

And your the type who get hanged in the night by ur nigger neck :)

also make sure you have siege on steam. if you have the game on uplay and buy the credits on steam you will not be able to use them credits
---
I just played a game like an hour ago where my whole team died in like 45 seconds, so they tried to kick me, ended up getting an ace, then we ended up winning the whole match because of me üòÇ
---
Oh, I get it, you‚Äôre a troll and having nothing intelligent to say. You‚Äôre not worth the time.
---
That's an interesting perspective. As a Day 1'er (I Closed Alpha and Beta'd Siege) I would have said that I think that Siege has become LESS oriented to team play. Maybe that is a console vs PC play style, but even if I solo queue on Ranked on my other account there is just no coordination, no communication, nothing. People just do whatever they want. Often times it somehow ends up working and you win. On PC a lot of times one person can just run and gun and end up carrying a team to a round win. I do agree that something about Siege must draw toxic people to the game. I can't say I've ever played another FPS game in the last 15 years that has as many toxic players/issues as Siege does.

Depending on what you play on could squad up sometime. Don't play siege as religiously as I used to but still play casual more than ranked
---
So random xddddd
---
Hey clout cat i played with you once you made a team kill and then told me I'm the one throwing the game, i think that's the most toxic thing you've done
---
She thick ngl
---
And there goes any empathy I had.
---
i only noticed the thiccness
---
This is casual
---
Lol
---
I think it looks a bit more extreme than it is in reality due to a low frame rate.
---
However can't deny leaning is faster than it should be and lean spaming shouldn't have a place in a tactical shooter like Siege.
---
It's probably all just people judging based off a small sample size. In reality there's likely no skill gap by region.

However there is probably a difference in playstyle by different regions, at least in Pro League that's the case.
---
We don't use emojis here, normie.
---
I main Finka on console because I love her weapon. The adrenal surge is a bonus.
---
So you're telling me i dont need my friend to play bandit anymore to counter thermite? Ill take it
---
Rook better than Doc on spawnpeaking, because Doc is a bit useful for the team
---
You see the span of Silver 3 (2200-2299) not the end of Silver 4 and Start of Silver 2.
---
Hope i could help keep up grinding :D
---
My friend had same bug yesterday. 
---
Also he couldn't break barricades and game loading time increase dramatically.
---
If you use steam version try to check files. It will remove 1 or 2 and redownload DX. After that game will be fine.
---

The tighter the angle, the better chances you have. Oh and also ‚Äùwhen in doubt, drone it out‚Äù
---
Comparing PC to PC because I‚Äôm aware Siege on console is also a shitstorm. 
---
However-
---
League has more Smurf‚Äôs than probably any game I‚Äôve ever witnessed most suck hard silver or gold thinking they should be plat+ and therefore it‚Äôs NEVER their fault if they lose.
---
One tricks are just a plain nightmare, tantrums if they get banned or they just straight leave. 
---
Inting at the first instance of criticism and usually after 3 deaths all you see is FF at 15.
---
If someone makes any mistake you‚Äôll get shit from not only your own team but the enemy as well with constant ‚Äòmissing pings‚Äô 
---
I mean that‚Äôs just scratching the surface.
---
I go on and put it anyway, coz if one has seen it, pretty sure it hasn't been relayed to others and there is so much going on, one tends to forget about it when pushing obj in last moment.
---
people don‚Äôt really even kick cheaters, since you can only kick teammates
---
I've bounced from gold 2 too silver one all season
---
Incredible, especially with the blurred vision. Ubi did such an incredible job with Siege, it blows my mind every day. Would pay to see their design team put together a CG Siege movie.
---
I ment 1 in a milloin chance.

living under a rock because i'm not intersted in that shit game?  the biggest cod prize pool ever was 2 million, so it isn't that big like you think
---
Twitch.exe not responding
---
1) CoD is a lot more casual. Twitch shooters tend to be more popular because it's "easier" to get into and requires less brainwork.
---
2) Counter-Strike has been going on for more than a decade, as has Call of Duty. Not a fair comparison with Siege.
---
You obvs can‚Äôt play a proper game lol

CoD is harder to play than Siege

It's Scandinavian Airlines.

Holy shit this is amazing, planning on doing other ops gadgets?

I love this

DETAILS
---
Lmaooooo i noticed that too
---
I'm sorry that stuff like that happens and I'll never understand how men can be such idiots online. The best way to prevent situations like that from happening is to just mute your mic and not respond and to just maybe mute everyone at the start of the game. It's stupid of me to assume that you've probably looked for a squad but just haven't found one but that's also a good option, if you're on xbox there is looking for group posts you can join or start, I don't know if ps4 has that type of thing but r6 has a discord that you can join and maybe find some people to play with who are nice. I'm on both consoles as "spursv13", if you're on console that is. I hope your siege situation gets better because no one deserves to be harassed.
---
If you are wondering about my spelling its only that first english aint my first languish and second that i have a hard time spelling
---
Thankyou, except it doesn't say what whoever it was claimed it did.

It's very much a grey area. Deliberately putting cams in 'glitch' spots would be punished but there have been spots where it is difficult to destroy a cam, due to a perspective (for example downstairs on Bank) - which were allowed.

Well what do you expect from someone who saw a thread an entire year ago?

Why the hell did he notice in the first place? Ya know that mothafucka going headfirst into some video game ass.

i would love to go through that hole
---
Not to claim a wrong thing and then say "I can't remember, you go check" when asked to support it.
---
Are you fucking kidding me man lol, if it were that easy Siege would be THE casual game to play for all the casuals.
---
Instead it's Call of Duty because it's very easy to get into. Requires next-to-no strategy or tactical awareness because it's a twitch shooter with a high ttk.
---
Low ttk games changes the whole game. Siege is 1000x harder, and this is coming from an ex-CoD player.
---

I mean, every second game I play there is a Rook P90 that is so good he can jump up into the skybox and ace our team. It's really crazy cuz we all spawn in different spawns but he flicks to us anyway. I dunno man, PC players are just too good I guess.
---
Doki was pissed

You can‚Äôt call yourself an Ex-Cod player if you just played pubs

i wonder what he was doing to notice that...

1v1 me then

Wrong sub lol. Pretty sure this belongs on /r/overwatch

lmfao why should she have to ?
---
typical cod kid, changing the theme when he sees that talks trash, ofc cod has a bigger community because how old is cod and how old is siege? and saying that cod pros are celebs is the biggest bullshit, I never heard of any pro tournament or pro player, and why? Because i'm not interested in that shit, you are not interested in siege, thats why you don't hear anything about them. complete idiot.

Pisses me off that people do this shit. There is nothing wrong with being female and liking video games.

I played for a clan during MW2, not competitive, but I took part in scrims. Since then I didn't play in those sorts of scenes in CoD.

I think this is worse on NA and the American data centres, because everyone speaks the same language, there's way more people communication which increases the chances of running into toxic cunts like this.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Here in the EU servers there's like 50 different languages/countries that it covers, so communication in solo Q and whatnot is much much more sparse.
---
I'm with you, sister.
---
I've actually stopped playing Siege because of it. Might get back into it again, but every time I give it a go I always end up sad. Usually I'm able to ignore it, but it's hard to keep cool when all you get is "whore/slut/get back in the kitchen, woman".
---
I'll never forget a ranked match on my own on Tower with a clan on my team. They took turns trying to kill me, chasing me all over the map and screaming over the mic what a whore I was. I actually ended up crying (never let them hear that though ofc).
---
I dunno, it's like you can't even tell people off because that's just fueling the fire. I wrote a letter to Ubisoft a while back, never got a response. Just know that you are not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Well I'm not complaining
---
Thanks!
---
Got an ak the size of a FUCKING MINIVAN
---
That happened to me a lot during the showdown event. I'm not a girl just to make that very clear. However, I do have a fairly high pitched voice for a guy. Not cartoonishly high, but high enough that it's noticable to other people. I also have a terrible mic because I don't really play online. And every match of showdown I played, I got yelled at and harrassed regardless of whether I did well or not. I love this game and I'm glad I bought it but I have grown to loathe playing online unless one of my friends is there to play with me because we just use party chat (I play on PS4). But seeing as I'm new and really want to play with people who just want to have fun in casual or terrorist hunt, please message me if you want someone who is going to die first but support the team as much as he can!

Platform?

Honestly, I‚Äôve heard stories of this happening from other players and content creators/streamers. Spawntaneous has a whole YouTube series of her encounters with this kind of toxicity. Unfortunately, the only thing that will 100% ensure you won‚Äôt have to experience this is to find a solid group of people to play with so you‚Äôre not put in a bad lobby. There‚Äôs an LFG subreddit, the Unrenowned podcast discord has an LFG, as well as the R6S discord. 
---
I‚Äôm really sorry you have to deal with this so frequently. I can‚Äôt imagine how it would feel to be harassed constantly. I hope you don‚Äôt give up siege if you enjoy playing. Good luck out there!
---
PS4
---
Do you have an Imgur link?
---
Lion‚Äôs ability uses the same technology as motion trackers, just on a larger scale
---
Some sort of sonar is what I'm thinking. but it really doesn't make any sense
---
Man that sucks ass. My clan is respectful atleast. 
---
If you need people that are a welcoming siege community come to seismic gaming. 
---
It's 18+ and a supper welcoming group that plays everything from RuneScape to r6s
---
Fuze, not even sociopaths would have that much disregard for human life.
---
Lions ability is realistic it‚Äôs just really complicated tech. It‚Äôs a drone in the sky that can see enemy movement by I‚Äôm assuming heat signatures. It detects them moving then targets them for everyone to see
---
But yeah Lion
---
Yeah..cant afford a pc when you gotta pay off four different cars that are all probably from 2008 lol have fun with your 35 fps garbage and slow reaction times newb
---
Interesting. How would it scans people through a wall? Doesn‚Äôt motion tracking require something to track?
---
I have a cat with an eye patch. Homage to big boss.
---
When u look at IQ‚Äôs ass so much you realise that her back pocket looks like her op icon
---
Shit sucks. 
---
In my opinion look 4 a squad with normal ppl
---
Yeah dude, on console i was around gold 3 but was always bottom frag sometimes middle of the leaderboard, on pc im plat 1, there is a massive differance, nor saying pc or console is easier im just saying, popping heads on console is an art inn itself.
---
Damm, you sure that's a render? It looks like real life
---
Ohh
---
I‚Äôve never reached plat cuz rainbow keeps fucking me up in my plat matches, but I did destroy so many full plat teams in scrim (like 10-2kd)
---
I deserve like plat 2/1 as rank :/
---
I'm pretty sure it's sonar cause of the low frequency sound when activated
---
That‚Äôs sick. All in all, the community of this came is very toxic and I partially met this problem too although ima boi. But you‚Äôd better find yourself a squad of ppl u know and avoid playing alone as I do. Just an advice
---
Which one?
---
Imo comms isn't worth the headache of being harassed and called human garbage. I know most of it is just banter, but man when I get on I'm tired and I just want to play some games before bed.
---
The day my game bugged so VoIP stopped working and I just went ahead and disabled PC chat, my enjoyment skyrocketed. I also have some guys I play with regularly and we just use discord. That is so much better than solo queue.
---
advanced tech allows for it, kindof like echolocation i guess
---
PS and XB both have mino leyboards that can attach to the controller.
---
ddos I guess, lag switching is for p2p
---
I play with a regular controller and switched my left bumper for b, so I crouch with left bumper, so maybe try crouch as one of your spare buttons as crouching is a big part of movement whilst in a gun fight
---
Yeah bruh I‚Äôm fine with people being toxic. You tk them back that‚Äôs how it works. Stop crying over a casual game. I may be toxic by u make the community look like pussies
---
Nice one
---
But the Gu Mines are invisible
---
Yeah, but you‚Äôre interacting with other people here. It doesn‚Äôt have to be an essay to look like you have 2 IQ.
---
Definitely not ddos
---
First of all, the burden of proof very clearly isn't on me lol am I talking to a 12yr old right now? Second of all, I'll just copy n paste what my last comment said since you're having trouble with reading comprehension: Sure, there may be "a way" to hack it, but has that way been found? Once you "hack" a PS4, it has to be left offline or it'll immediately get banned and to my knowledge, no exploit at all has been discovered for the Xbox yet let alone one that you'd then be able to take online. Third of all, you state that there obviously are hacks and follow up with saying there's no reason to hack on console- is that supposed to support your previous statement or contradict it??
---
&gt; A third party device or software can easily crack its way in the game 
---
You're talking about MnK adapters and that is not a "hack". Please list any example at all of the *third party software* that you're "easily" able to run on your console. You guys act like I'm saying it "MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE", when I'm clearly just stating the reasons why it seems highly unlikely to me. If I'm wrong and one of you can prove it then I'm all ears.
---
I feel like this does more damage IRL than in game.
---
Girl? I like girls. Wanna be fren
---
Ahh that makes sense, still regardless of what it is it needs patching soon.
---
u/sicaltus
---
Sure
---
Right after thermite gets his smoke grenades back
---
I rarely end up in toxic games. I also don‚Äôt play casual. Once you get to gold people are prettt cool.
---
Lag switching doesn‚Äôt work on dedicated hosts.  They are using cloud services to ddos the server
---
It's not something that can be patched by Ubi
---
Alright
---
I didn‚Äôt know you could use xbox app to type on your console, also you‚Äôd need two buttons to bring up chat cause [TEAM] and [ALL]
---
Jackal. His ability makes no sense at all. Not even a little bit
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying
---
Thank you
---
In game they are all wearing thick ass military boots. Still probably get pricked, but it wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as bad.
---
Mind you it's only low Plat 3 ish, but still :)

Wait... Where was he? There was no show of body on either side of the wall

Looks Hella cool, you should make a tatchanka one
---
nice
---
Yep we were 3-0 (defence, skyscraper) and whole team got the icon next round, still managed to svrape a win but it ended 5-4. Thanks for the info!
---
Alright. I'll look and make an update comment if I find the artist.
---
Not a Mozzie main but I used him online for the first time outside of terrorist hunt and my first drone catch was a twitch drone and my dumb teammate who was part of a 5 man team shot my shit because he was unaware of Mozzie's ability. I was tempted to teamkill lol
---
Yh i would‚Äôve tk back but he left soo
---
That‚Äôs not always true
---
Can relate
---
Right so we're just supposed to play and hope we don't lose this way?? Surely there's something that can be done
---
Ohh it'll sting a lot
---
I've been playing since release and furthest I got was gold 2 :(
---
So by not putting commas and full stops makes me look like I have 2 iq? Ok bud
---
Ah okay, yeah I used lag switching for lack of the right phrase but I understand now, still fucked though
---
I spawn peeked using Tachanka's LMG and got accused to play fortnite afterwards . What kind of world we live here lol
---
You make our community look more toxic then it is
---
It was probably a shotgun because they don't get the headshot instant kill.
---
I would look for a nice discord with normal people and always group up when you play
---

Yeah, it does. Your sentences are basically incomprehensible and literally nobody will ever take you seriously. You type like a 7 year old
---
I really dont have a single fuck with me enough to do research on your behalf because you dont have the nutrients in your body to do more than a google search.Maybe tell your mom next time to vaccinate.Just search up clips of hacks on console ive seen them myself.Its not rare.Im not a hacker,i dont have the sufficirnt knowledge to tell you that it can but seeing as how u find it is highly unlikely for no really good reasons then you do u.If one of your backlash statement is ive never met a hacker in my game and ive played xxx hours then dont bother.I have around 500 hours and nvr met a hacker.Seems farstretched?Does that mean theres no hackers in pc?no.Now you're asking the question here.Hopefully someone will explain why thats possible to hack on console but beta console males shouldnt think that just because they extra money to play online means they have a better community.Maybe since u guys cant even chat to begin with
---
Never in a game should you feel personally attacked or the feeling of not being able to speak out of fear of being harassed. Unacceptable behavior from CHILDREN who have nothing better to do than harass and screech. What‚Äôs done is done,  and you cant change the past, so I can only hope that your future games go better than the past. 
---
From the better side of the siege community, we have your back.
---
Yes sir, hope to see more siege videos!
---
Bruh maybe state that next time instead of making me think you wanted total keyboard support for a single game just to chat.
---
The fedora energy is strong with you.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll try
---
Check out his Instagram, there's a bunch of cool renders like this over there.

It always does me good, really deserves it

Spoken like a true teenager lol

As i said a 1v2 is the situation. The first kill was in a 2v3 so not a clutch
---
the badge i bought on alibaba website (can't remember lol)
---
Jesus so many "beta" insults, I think that's called projecting haha? And yeah I accidentally hit reply before I was done, huge beta move for sure. "That's all I'm going to say" then types out like six more sentences lmao. I never said it "cannot be hacked", reread my comments but slower this time, or maybe get someone to help you since you're having so much trouble. All I wanted is evidence of hacks, how can I show you evidence of no hacks lol. If someone robs a store, you have to prove that- you don't prove that they didn't rob the store. If evidence of hacks is soo easy to find, wouldn't it be easier to just send me a quick link rather than typing out a big paragraph on how I'm wrong and sooo dumb lol? Again, where does one "search up clips on console hacks" as you said? Since it's not on google, where is it that I search for that, Mr. alpha?
---
Imagine being so concerned with if you "win an internet argument" and then literally calling them a beta in the same sentence lolol. Literally can't tell if you're just trolling at this point. Do alphas win all the internet arguments haha?? Also, "keep my word"? On what??
---
I gotta agree with the other guy at one point of the fan base is extremely toxic
---
Yh in a bit I‚Äôll make sum u send me sum too

Had the same issue when the ubi servers where down for maintenance or when i lost the connection to the servers

I genuinely would like to see that. Except I know for a fact you‚Äôd use mnk and then think ur better than me. But even still if tk‚Äôd that 1v1 anyday
---
In casual, it might be harder for you because nobody takes it seriously and will do the dumbest, most unexpected stuff.
---
But... In ranked you will most likely find tryhards or even more vote kicks. On console, vote kicking is VERY common. I REALLY recommend you play with a couple of friends. Maybe two or three.
---
If you accidentally hit your teamate, when they look at you, look towards the ground to basically signify "sorry".
---
Play somt T-hunt, and try to avoid playing fuze on hostage. You will be instantly kicked if you do.
---
Imagine having steamer/Youtuber voices as announcers. I would love to have Badger shit posting on all of my matches.

"10 seconds remaining my guy, you gotta plant that shit."

No, sorry

Play ranked it is frustrating in the beginning if you get stomped on kind of but as soon as you‚Äôve got your ranked it gets better and you can improve your game

Yeah. Pretty much everyone in high gold play and diamond. But if ur actually using controller I‚Äôll take that 1v1 if u were actually bro serious

Hello Shad_03, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cmc5jh/fml/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I recently met a girl online, not even in siege, and I‚Äôm sorry for what you have to go through on a daily basis. I always knew this happened, because of pengu talking about it about a year ago, and then jagerhimself made a video on it. But I didn‚Äôt realize just how bad it is, almost every day someone does something toxic, whether that‚Äôs a rape joke, asking her to be their ‚Äúe-girl‚Äù (what the fuck does that even mean), or other annoying things like that. There was a streak of probably 2 1/2 weeks where one person would ask multiple times a day for a face reveal and then be told off, and continue the next day; he then didn‚Äôt understand why he got blocked. I sometimes don‚Äôt understand people.
---
As a fellow female, sorry to hear but completely agree.  I was afraid to post anything like this myself thinking that it was just something that we had to put up with.

I started out playing Destiny 2 with my bf and his friends, met some random people of all ages in the past year who have been really respectful and cool, and figured hopping on Siege wouldn't be any different.  (I was wrong.)  I'm not there to chat or anything if solo-queuing, just want to help with callouts if we're actively trying to win as a team.  It sucks that we have to resort to not using a mic just to have a better experience in a cooperative game.
---
I mean I saw one in the ps4 store and bpught a basic version to try it out.
---
I never thought of that. That‚Äôs pretty smart but I think it also makes you sort of a bad person. 
---
I‚Äôll probably start doing that
---
Again, the consoles themselves haven't yet been exploited- it has nothing to do with Ubisoft or the desire/lack thereof to hack it. And you can keep insulting console all you want, but that doesn't mean it's not hugely popular in the console scene despite your PC master race ego view on it. "no clips that u can find", again not willing to just straight up admit that you've never seen it with your own eyes. You're too lazy to search up one of the large amount of clips you've seen but not too lazy to keep this debate going for this long? Hmm.. And no hackers on console aren't "no more", online hackers on console have never been. Again, this really has nothing to do with siege, but the consoles themselves.
---
I guess I prefer these easy "puns" over having "beta" written 8 times in a single paragraph, but I still don't understand why this couldn't have just been a normal discussion.

Ggwp

Try playing cs:go or rust
---
I think that is exactly what happens (it happens to me multiple times) no hole but mirror still pops
---
But be prepped to get shit on in your placement matches but after that you‚Äôll enjoy yourself
---
What was your ping compared to maverick could just be delay on your end
---
OP is solo queuing. Bronze player is in all likelyhood a smurf account queuing together with one or more of the other players in this match.
---
That is exactly how it works mirror pops off but wall is still 100% solid
---
He‚Äôs extremely situational, his ability and pretty weak weapon kit lead him to be pretty useless in most situations unless there‚Äôs a ying, blitz or smoke plant etc where he‚Äôll be pretty useful

He's very situational, and while you may get lucky and have him in a situation where he may be useful...... You're probably better off jsut having soemone else on the team.

I‚Äôm going to get crucified for this but I want House to be added to ranked. Yes it‚Äôs a broken map but I still enjoy it. It‚Äôs something that would make everyone go full on try hard and it would be hectic and chaos but still. Could be fun
---
Said the lion main
---
I'll be honest 
---
That uniform is a bit ugly 
---
That said, a legendary is a legendary. Good job
---
I know it's not an ideal solution, and you certainly shouldn't have to resort to this, but you could try recording your gameplay/audio and sending in the really extreme stuff to Ubisoft customer support. 
---
You could also try the Spawntaneous approach and use it as a catalyst for content creation.
---
YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET SCANNED
---
I wish they would. I actually just watched a video from jagerhimself and apparently this is an issue in the game. The first clips is the exact same thing happening to someone else.
---
Yes, it isn‚Äôt the best uniform in the game but it‚Äôs a legendary and I‚Äôm very happy about that.
---
This looks terrifying! Great work!
---
Makes me wonder what would happen if he put something real nasty in those needles, poor attackers wouldn‚Äôt have a chance!

Fine,lets make this a normal discussion.Its like nearly 1 am where im from so i wont reply for much longer.Okay theres no clips of hackers that uses aimbot and wallhacks on your end right?Then what about hackers that ddos?Ive seen a lot of comments on reddit and ytb that its more common over there.Technically a hacker.Is this ubisoft or the console problem?Seeing as consoles arent as susceptible to being hacked then why does ddos happen to console players more often?
---
Ha! Thanks for the heads up ;) but I def think I should try it out.
---
I sent you a friend request, I‚Äôll be on later on today since I‚Äôm at work. I‚Äôll play a few with you if you have a mic and see what I can do to help

You should get a Bully Hunter
---
Thank you so much, yeah I do have a mic
---
Was this ranked?? I dont recognize the map
---
Only thing capitao is good for us his lmg
---
Quite honestly haven't played as him much but from what I have seen and done I have found almost no point to him. Other than his funny run and he looks like Commissioner Gordon.
---
~Casuaaaaaal~
---
Do you have anything useful too?
---
Attack: Twitch, Capito, Thermite, Ash
---
Defend: Jager, Ela, Lesion, Bandit
---
These are just my ops i like to play because they work out a lot in most maps
---
For attack for me it's Hibana, because she can be useful everywhere. As for Defense, I like to play Maestro or Alibi because Maestro is very strong and Alibi is soooo fun, also they have a secondary shotgun.
---
Start by playing casual until you hit your skill average, play with what you feel more comfortable and find a party to go ranked
---
And i used a couple minutes to search about hackers on console siege.Theres a lot of them but mostly seem to be just speculation and sketchy hits nothing too solid
---
"play with me heres my tag" -tons of virgins in this thread.
---
This is Border, and it's Casual because it's Match Point on 1-2
---
Lucky
---
I‚Äôve always been a pretty hardcore j√§ger/ash main, but had a decent break from the game a while back and this season have been playing twitch/valk almost exclusively. Always played twitch now and then but seem to have really clicked with her this season. Started playing Valk on defence as I was finding defence was getting boring for me so tried valk to learn cam spots and stuff and have been having a blast antagonising attackers with run outs and flanks ever since :)
---
You're lucky
---
imagine owning up to being unhealthy
---
true didnt pay attention to the match point haha

&gt;i apologize on behalf of my gender

yikes
---
Buck for attack because I love vertical play since it‚Äôs usually easy to pick off a kill. Smoke for defense because of the smg-11 and his gadget denies plants
---
nah i meant everyone else. why‚Äôre you so angry buddy?

It‚Äôs recoil isn‚Äôt even as low as a lot of much better ARs

Try removing the phrase "I mean" from any comment you make. Unless you are trying to clarify a previous comment that was misinterpreted.
---
Toxic.
---
Not making up nonsense. I've been playing games online since CS 1.6 and girls always become targets for toxic randos.
---
I'm not saying Overwatch is on the same level as Siege, but saying " It's about the popularity of Siege which attracts toxic garbage people.", is disingenuous to the fact that the issue is far more widespread than just Siege. Not only that, those same people go play other games too, generally other competitive online games like Overwatch.
---
Pretending the issue isn't widespread is just disingenuous. You don't need to look any further than gamergate to see that.
---
cuz her weapon sucks.. am playing in console btw  so her recoil is shit
---
&gt; It's not funny, it's shitty and toxic and I'm sorry you're experiencing that.
---
It's disheartening to see videos like this get over 8 million views, too many 12 year olds seem to think that shit is hilarious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NvXbiI6GG0
---
In reality that‚Äôs not really a good team comp. maybe in low ranks like Bronze but nowhere near good in Gold and above.
---
Whats your username

Her gadget is God tier

How i would do it is just to keep it even so just a Defender you‚Äôre interested in

"Ubi pls can I fucking kill myself"
---
"ok"

you see thermites arm, the point feed and the animation from the charge
---
Mean tactics.

Thermite

Her recoil isn‚Äôt even bad lol just burst fire at longer ranges and you‚Äôre good
---
Fuck that anime shit
---
well i hope i run into more people like you, thanks for the help, ( sorry for forgetting to reinforce lol)
---
Took you five and a half seconds to shoot the camera and then you one pop that dude through the wall, my man
---
Keep an opt in situation. You can't punish solo players by puttin them with toxic 4 stacks, am i right?
---
It's already annoying being a solo player to join 6 ongoing matches in a row in round 2 or 3.
---
No, players should throw in pro league.
---
This is great. Nice work!
---
yea please reinforce next time lmao
---
Finka, nano technology for one person is one thing, but having it for the full team and activated wirelessly? Kinda out there compared to everything else. Still, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal considering I‚Äôm a sucker for her backstory.
---
believe me, I think xbox is worse because the playerbase is slightly younger than PS4, so that means a slightly higher number of toxic 12 year olds. i do believe you that PS4 is probably just as bad though.
---
Whenever i complain about this, i always get the response, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so you face better people so you get better‚Äù but, i don‚Äôt believe that so, i feel you

kaid or alibi
---
Is that why we were all diamond and plat and 3-1 up against Plats and diamonds?
---
Yeah I have noticed that anything lower than gold 4 is an almost guaranteed toxic team. Once you manage to break into plat or honestly even high gold the community gets a lot nicer l. You still get some people flaming on occasion but it isn't an ever game occurence.
---
Just happened to notice huh?
---
But there is only 1 person that agreed with u buddy

Don't harass female gamers, just mute them.

Yeah, It's high sensitivity.

When you have a bunch of young males in a highly competitive environment these things tend to happen. It would be the same if you went down to the local drag strip or a football game. This isn‚Äôt a video game specific problem or even a siege specific problem. 
---
I wish it didn‚Äôt have to be like this, but it‚Äôs just how boys work. People want to change it but there‚Äôs no possible way it‚Äôs going to happen. It‚Äôll take decades to change how males view competitive sports and video games and most people refuse to believe the truth. 
---
My suggestion would be finding a team of girls to play with or find some guys who aren‚Äôt hyped on testosterone.

The Lord is the best operator

People reporting you on siege on Xbox are like shooting Godzilla with a spit ball

You were just better then them in the end, it had nothing to do with the operators you chose. They simply didn‚Äôt adapt to the strategies you pulled out and you won because of their lack of adaptation.
---
I‚Äôm not a female but I can totally feel you and idk if this is what you were asking but you can friend me and play ranked @KuDzo_

Now that is a avengers level threat

Jackal, of course.

Yep experienced  similar nonsense, been told to go back to the kitchen and what not. It's ridiculous that people act like this, just because you hide behind a screen doesn't give you the right to be rude as hell to your teammate just because they're girls. I've basically given up on communication and play in silence. Best is often drag your good friends with you over dealing with random idiots.

thered be a cart of hay and she'd land in it

np... you should consider adding a gun that is strictly a 3 burst gun

YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED

I don‚Äôt know how it happened, but he disconnected and joined back and this happened

Hmm. Idk about the guns. Seems like a good gadget.

I use the cz and spas a lot

Wait what how? Am so confused right now
---
Or acog gets replaced with the fmg/roni site (vortex I think it's called)

Hmmm nice

he‚Äôs not an easy kill at all though. he has one of the best defender guns in the game and a secondary smg

I‚Äôm a console player and I‚Äôve never been ddos‚Äôed once.

I had match where we were up 3-0 and my teammates forfeit

Lol I've been playing as long as u have but I play by myself to much
---
This sounds a lot like the Season 9 finals.
---
/r/Rainmeter is one of my favourite subs honestly
---
That would be cool. She‚Äôd really fit the role of some of the older ones too
---
when you decide to pick doc to spawnpeek and not rook.
---
Yeah but the cs and spas are only on one or two character each
---
What platform do you play on? I‚Äôm on Xbox 1, we play semi consistently, and we play ranked more for fun because casual is a circus. Message me if you‚Äôre interested we‚Äôre all mature and respectful. Wish you the best of luck
---
You could make a religion out of this
---
Does the SMG-11?
---
So I have a question about this about how I can actually actively help. When I play games with my sister, of course similar things happen, so this matters to me a lot. I've found if I: Directly tell them to shut up or that "that's not cool, chill out dude" it can make it *worse* for her and for the rest of the team, but sometimes *completely* stops the vitriol. I can stand getting called a white knight or whatever, but I think it gives them the attention they so desperately crave and sometimes encourages them more than stops the problem. So I've switched to saying "be quiet, I can't hear and I'm trying to play the game" and that is either ignored or sometimes helps, but at least rarely ever makes it worse. Do I try both? Is anything I say to these guys even going to help? My typical reaction for a gamer girl or little kid or speech impediment or anything like that is to have no reaction at all, but if it *helps* to hear someone say "I know you have it tough, good luck in your future matches" then I would love to do that for as many people as I can.
---
Octane
---
Depends on your playstyle. I've only been playing a month and I couldn't get on with ACOG as I'm not one to hold long angles. I prefer to close the gap and fight close. It's personal preference regardless.
---
Is it of age. I would smash 10/10. They need to add this, black ice and blood ice. Lovely, make more skins.

GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!

Also a pointless pick and ban system, cant kick teammates so if you lobby up with people and have one open slot and get a troll, you're fucked if you're in ranked. The constant "balancing" that players are forcing ubisoft to do. People don't know how to counter and instead bitch to ubisoft because that works nearly 100% of the time.
---
I disagree. When you have a bunch of immature people who choose to behave as children, you see this in any environment. It's not a male thing, or a competitive thing, it's a stupid thing. I play games, I play sports, I have a group of guys I play with and this sexist stuff just doesn't happen. It *doesn't* have to be this way, it can change, and in my opinion "boys will be boys" as a mentality needs to change, too.
---
How do you ACCIDENTALLY step on that?
---
The amount of detail in this is ridiculous! I love the work keep it up!!
---
People disappoint. The only solution I think of is to find another game with less toxic players (I dont know which, but I know they exist). (I think). Or you can play single player games. But if you really enjoy r6 and dont want to play something else, I recommend getting a bunch of friends to play with, so they respect you as a human being and not a sack of shit. As a random person who  isnt the best and plays to enjoy the game, I hope you see this and it helps you in any way possible. I cant believe people still treat women(who didnt do anything wrong) worse than a real life bitch.

Pretty sure that isn't true. The same kid harassing someone on R6 is the same kid who plays Fortnite, Pubg, and CS:GO. It's online gaming that is toxic due to the anonymity, and saying R6 is the shittiest out there is not true.

You need to get some friends who are somewhat good at the game üòÇ
---
If you play on PC, there's an R6 discord that, on average, has more serious players than your typical random.
---
If it makes you feel any better ingame chat is a trap 4/5 people are so toxic in this game I don't even play with my headphones that have a  microphone unless I'm in a pre made and I'm a dude. Occasionally if there is a non toxic team chatting I'll switch headphones and chat but rarely.
---
And I'm a dude...
---
i could join too, just im not really good...
---
I know. I was referring to the fact that they feel the need to hack before they're in a match where they benefit from winning. Doing it before level 30 just lets others know that they are hacking (which is good because we already have enough hackers in ranked).
---
You have been removed from the match

Even small ammounts of air in the bloodstream are lethal. In specific places as little as 0.5 to 1 ml can lead to cardiac arrest. As little as 2 ml into the cerebral circulation is fatal.

Her gun is fucking great, you just have to learn how to control the recoil.
---
This blows my mind that this isn't a picture. The level of detail on this is insane.
---
While that is true, I only had 2 days to work on this, and I needed some way of holding the gun. So I chose to hold the suppressor. None the less I appreciate that you like it!
---
Sometimes it feal's like this game was created by morons for morons. Take my apology from all good side of siege community. Good luck!

that is what i do untill i'm by myself, that way no one can fail me

Because they're 12. I play with a group of 25 to married with children and it's great. I still laugh so hard I'm crying sometimes but any toxicity is immediately and harshly death with by the group. We have one regular that is female and she similarly doesn't  other with game chat because of reasons like yourself.
---
Find a group to play with. Don't waste time with callouts when solo. 9 out of 10 times they're just children.
---
Benefits of playing with 3 or more... You outnumber them. So pop that motherfucker in the head and ask him if he's good spectating 'cause he's gonna have a few rounds of practice.

Yeah
---
Drop that tag, my guy
---
With enough tweets showing interest towards the skin, maybe Ubisoft will add it!
---
I would say it's strange aesthetically but they have Castle in a baseball uniform, Ash in fishing clothes and Blackbeard looking like a hipster... So I guess whatever floats your boat
---
what did that bookcase ever do to you
---
Should be called in game like shark attack nice design
---
/u/Chroniclnsomniac would you ever think of doing something like this?
---
Ahhh yes, enslaved red and white blood cells
---
Mute is very good. Warden and Nokk have no effect but very limited situations. With the ddosing at higher ranks and the ops having no effect on gameplay this is basically Operation Health 2.
---
Finka is crying alone somewhere
---
An SG rush with twitch is also hella fun
---
I would think twice whether should i step the mat
---
I always do that when there's 1 or 2 left. That or pistols only if it's 5 v 3. 90% of the time there's one idiot who's against it or someone who just starts shooting with their normal gun like a twat.
---
Probably during season reveal on the 18th
---
Real mutes run the MP5-K. Real prophets run the MP5-K with iron sights!
---
Valk, she needs her fourth cam again
---
They didn‚Äôt see it
---
OP find and LFG and it'll take a while but you will find decent people to play with regularly. I've came across a couple girls on siege so far and they've said the same thing as you, if xbox casual is anything to go by the R6 community has a lot of growing up to do..
---
ok do you understand how game sharing works? You are sharing whatever content you have in your account with another person. Therefore since you have year 4 pass on your account who ever you game share with with also have year 4 pass. If you buy year 3 pass on your account who ever you are game sharing with also have year 3 pass. But if you buy a fresh new game of siege you will not have year 3 or 4 pass which you have bought.Right now you are only sharing your own library therefore you have the same content on your other accounts.

She has a high pick rate because of r/iwannafucktwitch
---
That is very cool and very specific tricking for one spot. Thank you!
---
Based solely on weapon I would say they are about even. I like lesion because his SMG has a good amount of damage but I also like Mozzie because both of his guns are good and he has a cool reload animation (I can't stop looking at it). It basically comes down to who's ability you like best.
---
It‚Äôs as if you don‚Äôt see it
---
Love it
---
Is noone gonna care that the gun won't even fucking function because there is no trigger?
---
Idk, I mean yeah the F2 is the best gun in the game, but her drone is also very clutch.
---
Thanks
---
You know it.
---
Chiefs, I just had the worst game of my life, could I join?
---
We got trapped in a 5v4 once (leaver not ubi) the enemy team decided to take turns tking to a 4v4 when they could've taken a game slanted in their favor, shootout to those guys
---
No problem I did the same thing but I wasnt bothered so I just didnt pursue it any further.
---
That frame rate looks like you're playing on a console.
---
Alright, thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions! I think I'm choosing Mozzie :)!
---
Ooooooooooppeeeeeerrrraaaaaaaaattiiiooon hheaaaaaaaaallllllllltttth
---
The moment I finally saw the mute elite I bought it. Started to play him. absolutely love him. One of my mains on defense now.
---
Maverick or lesion
---
Not mute, he's super versatile with shotgun and smg-11 along with a nitro. Deny both intel and the plant, whilst being a close quarters terror to the enemy.
---
Warden - Give him the P90 with the ACOG and clash's machine pistol instead of the smg-12. Hess still be weaker than the majority of defenders, but he's at least firefight-reliable now.
---
N√∏kk I'm aware this operator is underpowered, but she is the sort of operator that would be super frustrating to play against (much like blitz) if she was of a viable power level. Make her gadget last longer, maybe give her a slightly better smg such as the mpx or mp7 (or just more variety, even if the weaker smgs, such as frosts or castles smg).
---
They're the only operators I would increase the power level of tbh. Other operators like cav/fuze are on the weak side, but would be super frustrating to play against if more powerful, particularly with random teammates (this is very much the case of what happenned with blitz). Some like gridlock are weak in most situations, but because they shine in others that makes up for it.
---
There is literally a reason I said to do it on the NEXT GEN. I'm not trying to solve MnK on Ps4 or Xbox one. I'm wanting a way for Ps5, next gen Xbox, and PC to play together without the PC players having the advantage. And with talks of backwards compatibility and what not, Controller players on Ps5 and new Xbox can play with players on Ps4 on Xbox one, with the wonders of Input based matchmaking. There is no good solution for MnK on ps4 and Xbox one, because even if it supported native MnK there's already the guys that have Adaptors.
---
Shot and run with drone
---
No problem! Sorry for the late responses, I was busy with something :)
---
Speak this into existence
---
Of course, what are you trying to say tho?
---
There is nothing more satisfying than killing a spawnpeeker imo
---
Jump over it
---
What is there to get triggered about you and frost had a wonderful dance
---
dude thats fuckin gas. I would buy that skin in the game and in real life.
---
I really want to do that in ranked.
---
Thomas the shield engine
---
Ok u right
---
Sledge, thatcher, thermite, ash (attack) and rook, doc, mute (defence) are all very good for new players. Simple gadgets, reliable guns. Try to be second in the building behind a teammate. Watch how more experienced players move between cover or clear angles. If your aim is good, the further back from an angle the better (due to perspective). Learn the counters to your gadget (avoid mute jammers and bandit charges as thermite, etc). Aiming and motion/positioning will come with practice, aim with Thunt, motion/positioning will only be learnt in multiplayer, and takes much longer to get right.
