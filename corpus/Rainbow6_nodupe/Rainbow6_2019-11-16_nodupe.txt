I play with the highest possible fov because then you can really see what's to the left/right side of the screen.
---
---
---
Have you ever used Amari? She's likely attack on titan but in this.... Also, nobody is forcing your arm to play her though.... And there come Khali and wamari and the BosgACOG.... So, I disagree with your "realism" issue with skins and characters
---
Alt+z make sure instant replay is on
---
With stretched res? I heard there really is no advantage if you use a high fov with stretched
---
Your hole team left. No one has any points.
---
I'd be content if we still had bundles and instead they were credits only instead of the lootbox bullshit ubi loves to shove into our mouths.
---
Me after a depressing round.
---
Kills matter? Tell that to the high level, unselfish dudes who play Monty, Clash and Smoke and have a &gt; 1.0 win rate.
---
But you can shoot while adsing, I got a bunch of kills like this.
---

---
Also it won’t help newcomers at all.
---
So we just gon ignore the fact that they changed the 1st floor of Club House?
---
exactly, there was almost no vertical play, the rooms were small yet large in quantity, and the map was just a maze of confusion; and the audio in tower is terrible
---
did your dumbass just use an emoji
---
That's why i said some (I hate myself for missing Vigil's pro league bundle) Mira, Lesion (event stuff mainly has one nice bundle tho) and Jackal have nice ones to. Dokkaebi (I like her PL bundle her invitational event skin ony) , Zofia, Ying (one nice bundle PL skin uses the same headgear to which is nice) and ela on the other hand have disappointing bundles you can purchase with renown
---
Que worm motion montage
---
came out great :)
---
Finka shotgun is fun in my opinion
---
Coming from a game like Overwatch, I like the skins... They're don't distract me from the game and they look great. I haven't played hey with pink tachankas hey though
---
That part was pretty funny ngl.
---
What settings did you use? This is in T-hunt right?
---
I’m partial to the Polish girls, I play really aggressive and they are both extremely versatile
---
Well if you play a cheese operator, sometimes people will cheese back. It sucks when it happens but guess what? You can circumvent this problem entirely by not playing her. She is not even in the meta. It's as if you were complaining that you get shot through Tachanka shield in Ranked. My first thought would be "why the fuck you playing Tachanka in Ranked to begin with"
---
The fact that Thatcher beat the shit out of three people singlehandedly is phenomenal
---
Toxic
---
So that’s a piece of shit HyperX
---
I think they would die as soon as they stepped outside their base
---
Yes she should
---
So you enjoy them ?
---
That seems like a pretty good idea, but the no melee thing sounds kinda op. Maybe it should take more hits to break
---
Honestly I’d enjoy this. Maybe even a small head level one way window. Not like game breaking. But like you’d have to be right up on the door to see through. And ur view is limited to where the doorway is facing.
---
The old system was the best. For the first halloween event i bought hibana's pack with in game currency  then bought buck's bundle for cash because i liked it. I had no problem with limited content until they put them in loot boxes
---
This is wow
---
Yeah same. I'm confused on why they removed skyscraper from ranked. It's one of my favorite maps since themepark was removed. And it ~~doesn't~~ didn't seem all that unbalanced. Each site was relatively easy to defend with a team that communicated.
---
Are these boxes have stimpaks as well ?
---
Mmmm. Weird, they're feeling her coming through windows doesn't feel likes Siege. But going up an edge isn't? Some weird excuse there
---
No because operaters that are based on a defensive role such as Mira or castle would be useless
---
I wouldn’t main them if I didn’t
---
Not even using ACOG
---
Np
---
Nope, why did he tk u?
---
Both my channel is LSped if you guys would help out if not it’s cool but ya know

Hmm ok thank you will keep that in mind

The Geneva Convention absolutely applies to terrorists, and anyone involved in warfare.
---
Am I the only person who hates the map Tower???? I find it so annoying and boring
---
This felt weird to watch.. I used to go by "itzgryzz" years ago
---
The elite for cav imo should have been something stealthy jungle and the animation is just fighting, boring
---
U think i didnt do that? I did that like 5 times. I got bored after 20 min refreshing again and again.
---
English is not your first language? Interesting word choice.
---
&gt; more of a sideways in appearance rather than the ridiculous ones
---
I know exactly what you mean but sideways isn't the right word here. Not sure what is... "subtle change" or "similar" might be good substitutes. 
---
(Sorry if English actually is your first language and I'm being a dick)
---
No. I've contacted Ubisoft support about this as well.
---
Hibana is the  best imo, I'm a Japan fan tho
---
Not a single one of them is more than that Bandit elite shown above &amp; people still want the Bandit elite over it.  They have plenty of options and some are cheaper than the colorful shit.
---
Oh god
---
The cosmetics are just expensive as hell despite the game costing a lot of money to play. Many ppl who would spend money on cosmetics usually wouldnt buy the tactical stuff because they get more visual response from bright colours and cartoony skins and the rest of us just dont really have much for cosmetics cuz of what I mentioned in the beginning.
---
r/foundthehondacivic
---
1) Alt F4 shouldn't counter an operators ability.
---
2) Not being dramatic, merely asked if there was an update on an old problem yet you started crying over your keyboard.
---
3) I love the game and it was actually a random on my team who was playing Cav.
---
If you would like an actual discussion regarding balance/counters etc I'm more than open for it, if you want to cry I'm out.
---
Well yeah but after 20 mins of constant refreshing ots not worth it.

Yeah but people want the old siege back and miss the immersion. It’s there. Just none of the people that want the immersion/tactical gear buy the tactical gear available. None of them cost more than elite skins.

Oh

Whayever you say bud. i just dont see the point in these kinds of posts imo.

A lot of it has to do with the “iTs JuSt CoSmEtIcS!” Crowd that are still dying on that horse after it’s come out that companies are purposely manipulating their consumers psychologically to get them to spend more money on cosmetics, preying especially on “whales”. The reason they started making this clown ass shit was just to increase the sales. They introduced alpha packs to get us primed for “limited events!” and there were SO MANY people defending the introduction of alpha packs shrieking that they weren’t going to ever cost real money so there isn’t an issue. The original system they had in place where everything was purchasable with reknown or credits was so much better than the shit they keep forcing on us now. It’s so cash grabbing and it really does ruin the immersion when u got halloween costumes running up on you. Clancy is rolling in his grave rn.
---
Go off King!
---
amen
---
I like her as an operator. Everyone agrees i think its just a weapon change. 
---
Half an operator is her ability, armor and speed.
---
The other half is her weapons and kit, and her weapons are pretty lack luster. She reminds me of Cav a lot for obvious reasons but I still like cav more because of that destructive buffed up silenced M9.
---
To avoid getting caught
---
However terrorist don't follow it and that means it can't protect them either if IIRC
---
Well played
---
3 speed and a stronger gun with a silencer always attached to better fit her kit
---
*I’m not crying I swear*
---
I know people, including me, who are diamond and like the map, but exceptions prove the rule I guess
---
I dont care if u can control it but why ela is still being nerfed? Can she get atleast a buff?
---
#HELLO THERE
---
Well be right back...
---
Ela stopped being fun when they ruined her gun
---
Her gadget is loud, and isn’t reliable enough for it to be effective. Also, 6th pick is a thing so if they don’t already have a mute or mozzie, then they would 6th pick into one to counter Twitch.
---
In all honesty i like it, it just goes to show how much you can really do with cardboard.
---
Cool beans chief
---
This happened to me before, but it was a blitz that was so bad at TKing me that I thought it was an accident.
---
That’s a thing I want added but not only for Dokkebi but for people like Lion too.
---
Good luck man. Hopefully you can get this to work. I had the same bug and ended up just using the Game through Uplay + instead of steam
---
Weapon changes
---
That scream tho...
---
I agree but at the same time there are those toxic assholes who are yelling into their mic or blasting music
---
It’s simply him breakdancing, relax
---
I’m on a on and off again a Frost main? And I recently came back from a 2 ish month break from siege, came back and bought 16 alpha packs thinking I would get the frost set quick ended up taking me 27/28 to finish the set, I was not happy, so know I feel like I can only play frost because of the amount of money I spent just trying to get her outfit
---
ohh i forgot hibana, i love it as well and the animation, gives me for honor vibes and the mix of ancient and modern is just mmmmmm
---
My friend and I came up with it a long time ago, but I kept forgetting to post it 😂😂
---
Thanks  im actually doing some more things right now to get it to work and if all doesnt work Ill try contacting support again
---
I just want a Zofia elite skin. Also Montagne next. Then maybe Dokkaebi, Finka, Nomad and Lion.
---
Idk. There was a time when my buddy and I (25 and 21 at the time) started playing consistently with a clan of 14-16 year olds. They were annoying, but they were significantly better at the game than us and taught us so much. I went from being mid to low silver to being high gold/low plat because of them.
---
[removed]
---
I'm pretty sure this is the first time ANYONE has gotten a kill with wardens gadget.
---
The fleshless one from Crimsonveil? (Halloween 2018)
---
If u are not brainless casual player spawnpeeks shouldn't be q problem for u . If u smart enough u can catch spawnpeeker with prep phase drone and get easy kill, but if he still won the gunfight ,then he just got better aim
---
reminds me of all the t-poses in the closed alpha 😂
---
Kali plays a different role than glaz. Only one of them can see through smoke, and only one of them can destroy gadgets
---
&gt;came back and bought 16 alpha packs thinking I would get the frost set quick ended up taking me 27/28 to finish the set, I was not happy, so know I feel like I can only play frost because of the amount of money I spent just trying to get her outfit
---
Lmaoo I did the same thing with smoke because I spent money to get the furry skin for him
---
Does she have potential to replace him or be like him? Because I can see ubi giving her a few nerfs soon.
---
Since you asked so politely for us to be nice, we sill try our best.
---
Nice work.
---
last time I played I would have to wait almost 20-40 mins on average to find a ranked game but I was only silver so that coulda had something to do with it
---
I never feel safe on Chalet, in casual, there's always a cav s o m e w he r e
---
Repost
---
&gt;yes she's OP currently
---
Confused how you would find a bolt action with a shorter range Thatcher gadget and locked 5x-12x op.
---
NOBODY finds it op. Literally nobody
---
When did glaz get frags.
---
Agreed
---
He shines on a few sites. Such as garage on chalet you can castle the wine to luggage door and blow up the wall to the side so you can safely rotate bewtween them when garage is open. Another is on skyscraper if youre playing the work office/exhibition site you can castle the cleatencr double door and blow up a hole on the soft wall next to it so people on clearence window rappel cant hold the lounge
---
Yes. I think it’s called concrete directive. But that headgear is absolutely terrifying.
---
Yes
---
lmaoo thermite lookin like hes off an eighth of shrooms
---
Because the other 28% is the golds and silvers who think they should be diamond. Aka me for my first 400 hours on this game.
---
I actually made this work once. It was a 1v1 situation, and I was in the Jakuzi. When I heard footsteps I jumped out of the Jakuzi and knifed the guy. Don't ask me what I was doing there in the first place
---
aimbot
---
You have to do it through the uplay launcher app thingy. It's either a notification or a message from the person inviting you.
---
Run Terrorist Hunt a bit. You can tweak it so it’s only THunt Classic on maps you like. 
---
But other then that, it just takes time man. Siege has a huge learning curve. We all sucked at one point, we just put some time in. Good luck tho
---
what platform
---
I got that one yesterday :D
---
I think the only thing they have in common is their rifles (and even then glaz has a much higher fire rate). Nobody is replacing anyone
---
decent
---
This is why it was cut so it was more exciting

I was talking about the USSR turning Poland into a communist state while the West turned their back on them...
---
Peak peek
---
I have a recurring daydream about buying a Champion account as an anti-smurf, and messing with players who expect me to be good, completely ruining the match.
---
remove the ceiling thing and it seems fine
---
Ok
---
That would be a nerf.
---
They Just need to disable the loss penalty for ongoing matches, I don't care about joining even at a 2-0 matchpoint but I'm not gonna taking a loss I don't deserve
---
More like Ash
---
People need to play unranked more, it was much better. Casual is so mixed from idiots to MnK sweats and no-one wants to play the BEST gamemode for R6.
---
no u
---
Got em
---
Haha funny sex lol !!1!1
---
you guys know event packs guarantee every item if you open every pack right.... you can literally still buy everything as a bundle by just buying all the packs. Prices are a whole different story though, my friend said he spent $40 and only got I think 20 or 22 out of the 28 packs from the halloween event, which seems a bit too steep to me personally.
---
You gotta pick ops that blow stuff up or destroy quickly.
---
Nope
---
Y5 S1 Philadelphia Experiment confirmed
---
I think you should only be allowed to get vote kicked if you do anything that causes you to get negative points like breaking team gadgets and shooting your team. There would be some false positives, but at the very least, you'd be able to play the game first before getting kicked.
---
*IN THE WALL*
---
We still got 2 or 3 more weeks left so I'm holding out hope unless Ubi decides to cuck me.
---
Actu Ape Brain? What?
---
Simple, give her a standard 30 round mag and a recoil pattern similar to the Vector.
---
Her recoil is straight garbage right now, it kicks so much horizontally that it makes its effective range the same as her shotgun.
---
Only her 2 first shots are predictable, then it's all free-game.
---
I have same skin
---
I think it's alibis shotgun revolver, it has a red dot. Her regular revolver does not
---
This man is spitting facts
---
I can say the exact opposite of you haha. Majority of players I see have no mic
---
Is that Valks Halloween weapon skin?
---
I never thought Id see Flat Stanley here
---
I went 7 and 3 for my placements with a 1.64 KD. The second I placed silver 1 I went on a loss streak of 6 (yes with breaks) and I’ve been edging on Silver IV-III with a consistent flip between 2 wins and 2 losses. 
---
My games are never close, they’re either sweeps one way or the other. 
---
I’m glad Halo: Teach is out on Steam in 2 weeks. I’m so fucking sick of solo queueing because my friends all quit the game.
---
Here's a rework idea that would actually make sense and also make her burstfire mode viable for long range: 30 round per mag and a recoil pattern similar to the Vector.
---
Still punishes spraying, but rewards bursting.
---
Power fantasy. I mean newcomer was pretty fun when I created my second account although I'm now high gold with that account
---
dude, we would have destroyed these kids if it werent for broken matchmaking putting my friend and I in a 2v5 in ranked.
---
I know.
---
And its a shame its gone.
---
The nostalgia
---
What about cheeseburger??
---
After the third bullet really\*
---
There is no pattern, it just kicks the way it wants, for all you know you could get the highest horizontal recoil on opposite sides very often.
---
It's  not a lottery system... you get everything. there is no question *what* you get, just the order you get it.
---
Normal alpha packs are a lottery system because they are entirely random, event packs aren't. also, at least for the recent halloween event, you can buy them with renown.
---
Defenders have it ez, and I think there's some lighting problems, same with tower
---
That was user error. Bullets are fired at the tip of the recticle on the reflex, not right on its mark.
---
Considerating all bullets after the 2 first shots will miss, yes this is terrible lmao
---
Actually worse than all of the secondary SMGs.
---
r/boneappletea
---
I always thought people started the vote kick on me because I did poorly, or they didn't like my playstyle. But a while ago I clutched 2 rounds and had the best scores I've ever had in Siege (nice feeling to finally succeed btw), and still the vote kicks were flying Bruce Lee style.

I was talking to my 13yr old brother about it today, I dont play it because it's not my cup of tea, but I check up on the news for it so I have some knowledge when he talks about it. I thought it was cool that they added a Stormtrooper and even a freaking Batman skin to the game, if I was a kid his age I'd probably be psyched for something like that.

Solo queue, anything is possible. I got 1 point off plat 2 last week and got pummeled back down to gold 2 with concurrent losses against stacks. Consistency in comms use makes a big difference in solo queue situations you might end up with 2 other people willing to give calls. EU also has language barriers to contend with further reducing the comms pool potential.
---
OH SHIT
---
Bandit is 45?  
---
He definitely looks believable, especially for someone in specialized forces.

As a Glaz main I can't wait for the free kills from you clowns, already getting free kills right now due to people thinking thst Glaz is so shit that they can just peak him without getting popped in the head.

Yeah it's a pretty cool detail. Personally I think he should wear the watch all operator (reversed so the face is shown on his wrist so it acts like a secondary timer)
---
..yes. They do that by literally not supporting keyboard support natively.  
---
But you can’t disable it if the adapters used literally trick the system into thinking the keyboard input is actually a controller. At least not without a whole bunch of false positives.
---
Glaz has the best elite imo, and he is getting a good buff next season.
---
Goyo will definitely become stronger as people find their spots for him. I don't think I've seen him used cleverly once yet. Those aren't just shields, they're mines.
---
Amaru at the moment is very much like Nokk for that one walk-in-and-cause-wreck round. But she could be a much stronger mid-late round op than she is currently played.
---
You just died to mouse and keyboard user and now ur triggered

Are you sure it’s not your internet? What’s your ping?
---
I play on PS4 and I’ve never had this issue
---
Thanks for the recommendation :)
---
I like the TF2 system where stuff is marked as Halloween and you can only wear it in October or on the full moon
---
What I concern the most is the choice of weapon as there no evidence Chinese military use Western-made weapon...unless absolutely necessary
---
With Uplay points? You can play any Ubisoft game to get more points they are interchangeable not game specific
---
The Problem is that I don't want to buy everything I didn't like any skin this Halloween event except Kapkan I personally would have bought it for 6$ or so, but I will not spend 40$+ to get 4 skins I don't like at all.
---
Only difference is the price , Steam sales are worth it 
---
I don't think Ubisoft has that kind offer tho

Instant regret when they went down that hatch.

U kinda see ash and Zofia in nearly every pl round

No just a double kill

Thank you smoke, very helpful

Get as many Ops as you can as soon as you can. Learn the way you play Siege. In some cases its a matter of favorite ops. In others its just the ones you play your best at. In any case, getting experience with as many operators as you can makes it much easier to play the game to the best of your ability, and lets you mesh better with other teammates and ops.
---
As you do this, learn what strats work for you. Sitting by the garage with a deployable shield and a shotgun was one of my first real strats. It helped me save up renown for the ops I wanted. It will also help you learn the maps and good angles.
---
I heard The magnet resets the detonation time of a grenade it catched so you're fine in there

Hey ive seen this in my japanese videos!
---
just gotta say people keep saying the rule isnt broken etc but goyo is 2-2 with TCSG with Acog. And most likely because they arent full autos etc that are useful for spawn peeking. Would MUCH rather spawn peek with the K1A that can put out ~15+ rounds in the time you could try to get a second shot with the BOSG the thing is terrible.
---
Frosts gun has no recoil I swear. That’s why I mained her for like, forever.
---
I don't understand what you're trying to get at.

Whoops didn't see this till now, sorry. I prefer console but play both. The platform you play on has nothing to do with how relevant opinions are. Or how I or anyone else perceives how the game should be played and what ops should or shouldn't be banned, I ban jackal cause I don't care who gets banned, it's an easy choice to make others choose a ban instead of chilling and fighting over the op bans. Have a good day stranger.

That's the only reason I cant think of
---
Do we have a launch date yet for all platforms
---
he just delivers meatballs
---
Its from an alpha pack
---
It’s a tough thing to tackle honestly, because there are some skins that make the game tricky *cough cough ember rise cough*, there’s also the skins for Kaplan that make him look like lion/final but personally there haven’t been points in the game where I have had too much issue since most characters do have distinct silhouettes. E.g. sledge and his hammer or castle and his football uniform. 
---
I guess it’s something for the devs to ultimately decide
---
It regolate use of unconventional weapons like gas, dirty bombs, genocide, ...
---
I think it is a legendary from alpha packs
---
Finally gadget idea 
---
Exploding drones
---
For breaching soft surface and killing
---
ok sure
---
Thank you this was very helpfull.
---
I tought it had to be a network issue because it worked for every other game except for Siege, also how did you fix your problem was it by switching your network ports?And what VPN do you recommend i would use
---
you can get those cheap deals from 3rd party websites as well
---
Glaz black ice would be cool, if I could got a BB black ice I would be sorta sad since I don’t like bb

You truly are a spawn of Satan.

What constitutes it being sweaty? Casual it may be, but people still want to win, don't they?
---
If they're using the tools available to them and winning games because of it, I'd say they're just good players, not *sweaty* players.
---
I'd personally much rather play against and with good players in casual than the standard toxicity you find there.
---
*to be continued meme theme instensifies*

Some of them.   
---
Damn, Microsoft's Azure is shit. No wonder they cannot handle DDos attack and stuck on 30 tick rate so long. Microsoft is just a software vendor, people there know shit about how hardware works.
---
Dieselboarding is something that would absolutely happen to someone in a Fury Road sequel. I'm not even sure if it would be a punishment in that world
---
And DPS is actually pretty good, too(even though RPM is slow).
---
How many died and whom
---
Huh, people can remove floors and walls from a map that's not House? Who would've thought!
---
Nice job, OP. Got some juicy Fuze spots.
---
I hate this moan. "Why can't people play the way I do?". Because we are not clones and you are free to play any way you want. 
---
Perhaps you should play halo or cod.
---
*5
---
Yes. Well put. People are overhyping her without even having the basic iq and common sense to think it through.
---
It's either  1 hit down or 1shs. I don't see much variation in that.
---
The formula is basically (2500+last season mmr)÷2 (up to a max of 3500 min of 1500) before you start your placements. Add or subtract around +/-100 for each placement match and you'll get your rank. Or you could do what the other guy said and go to r6 tracker.
---
But you didn't say anything about his cooldown timer.
---
Finally another coastline hater. And border is my 2nd lease favorite as well.
---
As me and my friends say when playing smoke gas the *JEWS* (please dont ban me for that joke)
---
You’re really good but choke when it counts it looks like.
---
*cheating pos
---
What the? How’s u even get so low placements. Is bronze ur like highest rank?
---
Thats not how it works.
---
Yeah it should
---
Nah she's late for tea.
---
what about dokkaebi?
---
Coast has 3 good and balanced sites, only Penthouse is garbage.
---
Mine is Kanal. New version still suffers from alot of the same old problems, rotation between sides is still easily shut down.
---
I know it doesn't effect it at all, but I see it as unnecessary if I'm there.
---
Do the lights flash? It looks awesome.
---
I played a game earlier this week where the match ended normally and then we got banned for leaving. Idk what happened
---
There are price tags with yen on them, must be murican house.
---
I dunno man I feel like coastline and border are pure opposite yunno one is really good whilst the other is the shit under my shoe.
---
Thats even worse
---
It works the same as 30 tick rate.
---
Looks to be an execution...
---
If you've ever read the book they do not hide their faces every time. They DO wear the local police departments fatigues or jackets that identify them as police and not a U.N. sanctioned special operations military group, as to keep them secret. They do later reveal themselves in another novel.
---
So according to you there is no difference between 30 and 60 tick rate servers?
---
I don't really have any maps that I hate anymore, except Kanal. Even after rework, it's a shit map, rework made it playable, but its badly designed map nonetheless and I don't enjoy playing it. Whenever I get it, I'm disappointed I have to play it.

---
600 R6 are 5€, did they raise the price from 600R6 = 5US$ to more?
---
Yeah ok Capitao could have gotten something better, thats why i will still use the Metal plate headgear and Vulcan uniform instead of Elite
---
Put them at the top of stairs and right around corners that’s what I do seems to work pretty well with killing roamers.
---
Yeah, I agree with that, I think what I meant is that I think the operator could have gotten a slightly weaker gun and still been a great op.  For instance he could have been given the MPX and he still would have been a great pick.  Giving him a gun like the Aug is maybe a little too powerful for him, but only a little and I wouldn't change his setup, certainly not yet or until we've seen how he affects the meta.
---
Not necessarily that the gun itself is OP, more so that he could have been given a weaker gun and been fine, hopefully that makes sense.

Hmm, I see what’s going on here, the prices are different in each region I think.
---
Mira Mira in* the wall
---
i mean, do you KNOW that their wasn't a cav on the other team or only assuming so because she wasn't scanned?
---
This lottery system funds the further development support for the game though.
---
Wow this pissed some sad people off anyway the only reason for me to assume this is that i only see stuff like this happen to people with 150+ ping and couldent see yours anywhere.
---
Ah, that makes sense
---
It can turn out to be frustrating to play against. We don’t want underwhelming ops, but we also don’t want frustrating ops, neither.
---
I dont think so, it didnt say you are spotted, it say that my position was compromised, my native lenguage is spanish so my game is in spanish, i dont know what are exactly the quotes of caveira in english, but i asure you that is the message of caveira interrogations
---
At least it's a creative video that actually had effort put into it, you can't lump this in with the 50+ standard post per day with the same boring joke. Not the same thing.
---
Gingerbread skin on *all* the weapons. Absolutely
---
It’s something running in the background on your computer most likely there’s no difinitive way of solving this you would have to find out what opens while your playing and delete it
---
How do I find this out?
---
Put it at tops of stairs so that when people are rotating they are likely to run into the lasers without seeing them
---
I’m not entirely sure although you could just keep task manager open and see what ends up opening
---
I cant scan all of them, but i didnt see any caveira and my teammates, who also reache the obj and where in my party of xbox also said that there wasnt a cav on the other team, and even if it was a cav the guy who left didnt even entered the building
---
marley?
---
Wheres the fucking ak5-c?
---
The drawing is not bad.
---
If you are really 11 you shouldnt be playing this game though :D
---
Wow epic
---
Yeah, there are at canal as well
---
I just don't understand why everyone wants BOSG to have acog so badly.
---
No just a new youtuber :) thx
---
Let only ever have 1 of the lasers stick out
---
Give her unique FMG-9 - FMG-SD, with integrated supressor and buffed damage to 34-36. That’s all.
---
I'm not surprised that's a crouch spammer is this brainless and unaware.
---

---
U/vredditdownloader
---
Ir at least they were in a different pose i'd say why not
---
Lol why do you think he left? Because a Cav was interrogating him and he thought it would stop the spots by leaving as she interrogated him like before. 
---
They fixed that, so he’s just a salty guy who has to reconnect for no reason at all.
---
BOSG update? You mean....? Nooo.... ACOG?
---
The track they are on is perfect. Using second hand primaries from other ops is good. I can’t wait til someone gets Fuze’s AK12. People rarely use it and it’s such a good gun.
---
I think there should be more history themed skins, my favorite elites are ww2 skins (Blitz, fuze and kapkan)
---
I saw it first time watching this episod
---
Not a fan of ak's my dude. By the way how did you find this post? its like 4 months old
---
That what you deserve for trying to spawnpeek twice
---
Its called Hot Pink and it was available from alpha packs. You see I had the skin on my old account until I got banned for toxic behavior, Now I learned I can never get it back. :*(
---
It just works
---
I thought so. Still, it is very coincidental that they managed to take a screenshot of the six instead of any other number.
---
The entire basement to old Hereford was by far one of my favorite sites in the game. The rest of the maps was pure shit but I really hope they bring that basement back.
---
Well, tbh Bartlett would be nice to have back in Casual. I saw many people complain about “sweaty-tryhards” in casual. It’s a bit weird complaining about the difficulty when playing against better players, yet the same people complain about having to play “bad-maps” in casual.
---
IQ just naturally hates everyone lmao
---
Not a russian ak, the ak5, also known as the automat karbin 5, auto carbine 5 in English, is the Swedish modified fnc, and how i found your post, i guess i just happend to stroll by
---
1st: you know what you get, before you buy them.  
---
2nd: you don't need to buy them.  
---
3rd: If people like the Elite skins, they will buy them. If they don't; they don't buy them.  
---
4th: the Elites show important moments in the Ops life and express there personality more. All of the Elites are doing a great job of displaying personality.

Tachanka has the 6p41 when you run the benchmark
---
I bought blitz and glaz, but dokkaebi looks horrible
---
It still needs fixing :^(
---
But.. would it divert ACOG users to that gamemode?
---
Actually correction it’s on the bugfix list
---
This would take out tacticality, you could toss a grenade as you teammates run in prefiring, making attacking op and would leave defenders at a major disadvantage, if they run they die to your team , if they stand still your grenade wins , and there are many more situations that can occur from this since this isn't a tdm type game with responds friendly fire helps keep this game balanced from a designer stand point because you HAVE to worry about your actions to keep your team from dying to an otherwise op rush .

Echo is better because Maestro had his shield removed so it is generally harder to survive and is only good with some objs. Also the only real counter to echo is IQ while Maestro's counter is basically everybody. Also Kaid is good but mute has more utility and better weapons although he isn't a 3 armour.
---
Solution: enable damage to yourself from the start not after a teamkill.
---
Why would acog user go into this mode? It will only to play the acogs that we’re taking off ( ash jager bandit smg-11)
---
It doesn’t. They fixed it. People used to leave after she downed them &amp; before she got the knife off and she didn’t receive an interrogation. Now she does even if they leave.

any tips?

Also for buck, it's much easier to play vertical with a holo imo. You can see more through the floor beams.

That recoil control is wack

What's your biggest one??

1. One rank for every server. Right now a player can have multiple ranks for different regions which is baffling to me. A high rank player from a server can join matches in other continents and either grief or play in a completely different rank from his skill level. Matches are pretty much ruined in both cases.
---
2. Adjust MMR based on the highest rank of the party. A plat2 searching for a match with gold 1's should only end up in plat 2 matches. This would kill boosting once and for all, which is the cancer of this game. If a high skill player wants to play with friends of lower skill, they can play other game modes like unranked, or just take the risk
---
3. For the love of god make the ban phase faster
---
4. Remove duplicates from ANY pack since every single soul left playing this game thinks duplicates are ridicolous. Either that, or make the renown reward for duplicates much higher. As of now, duplicates are a complete waste of an alpha pack, regardless of the item rarity
---
5. Give players some kind of reward each time they level up a certain amount. As of now levels are a display of how much someone has played, and they just feel like a useless number especially with all the smurfs and alt accounts around
---
Thats what time in the episode it's at.

Just think of her as having three claymores you can place from a distance. Run-outs are the main use, but you can also use them to guard flanks, protect the bomb post plant, or whatever
---
Xbox
---
I kinda wish the skins stuck to more tactical stuff on the whole. Even the historical ones feel out of place to me. Siege is a video game and not everything needs to be 100% grounded in reality, but it still has a more realistic theme to it than most games, and I wish the cosmetics were more consistent to that.
---
But I guess if every skin was some slight variation on a military uniform they probably wouldn't sell as well. Elite skins especially need to stand out somehow if people are going to shell out the money for them. Judging by how many people I see with IQ's elite or meme Tachanka skins there's clearly a demand for them.
---
Pure luck😂

---
What episode is this from
---
I mean... maybe the biggest reason to rework deployable shields was to make the shield not leaving any gaps for some pixelpeeks so I dont know if this should be in the game
---
I see. I will probably get her just because she is very unique.
---
is this on Netflix?
---
I dont think any of them are worth $20. Ubisoft are a joke when it comes to how much they charge for cosmetics. I support their seasoned operators, but I wouldn't pay a penny for their overpriced elite crap.
---
I mean... Ela is a thicc rebellious girl with dyed hair and daddy issues.

You couldn't pick a more perfect combination

AND THIS... IS TO GO... EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!

Jäger, Echo, Maestro, Mira, Lesion, Doc, Rook, Valkyrie, Vigil, Kaid, Bandit, Goyo, and Wamai who is going to be released in the new season.
---
I probably missed like one or two defenders.
---
It’s a glitch they are fixing it I’m rising tides
---
Giving an acog to a semi auto shotgun with only 2 bullets in it is hardly returning to the Jager and Bandit reign. They had full auto weapons, Jager’s is even an AR that rivals what the attackers have. Like the other guy said, bosg is a meme weapon to begin with, anyone wanting to actually do well will still pick Vigil’s smg
---
Black mirror ACOG

What episode?

ah yes, an F2 twitch who crouch spams with no skin whatsoever

Learn Grammar, OP

Fuck yeah, mate
---
Everyone and their mother is posting their Minecraft builds of R6 operators over and over and over
---
They didn't say "Elite" has anything to do with "Elite", most of them being world war theme was just a coincidence, Elite set is just special skins with special headgear and uniform pieces, they didn't mention Elite is supposed to be outstanding, professional, it's just they are special version skins, they are unique and is not recolored from existing pieces. 
---
But the Elite set nowadays are getting more casual than before, Smoke, Bandit, Hibana, IQ, Ela, Capitao, Caveira are not World War, professional theme.
---
must have been your area then, but assuming server locations are broken up the same way they are now, the EUS servers were the funnest times i have had in gaming.
---
There are plenty of "not possible" things in seige.

Is that what you were referring to? There are plenty of gadgets and such that just couldn't be a thing.
---
Jackal's

Mira

Carrying 2 full steel reinforcements

I wish you could turn them off in game
---
Can you link it? When did this start happening
---
Mozzie- use him when Valk and Jager are taken. But in all serious he is a great op and I love his utitily
---
Exactly why I mentioned the only biggest maps in the game on rotation part..
---
All the time for the last 2 months. One was literally just posted today
---
There was another episode where the boys were playing siege
---
Glaz never gave up on the Halloween event
---
lol at people that refer to people as their rank. 
---
"LMAO you're a low gold, your opinion I'd stupid"
---
Do not pick up warden. Right now, he has no utility, shitty/hard to use guns, and a super situational gadget. If you want an anchor who can deny smoke plants, pick up Maestro. He’s relatively cheap too, I think he’s around 10K renown.
---
&gt;500 operators
---
They said 100. And your list is still hard top tackle even for a 10 year plan.
---
Not in America
---
tbh, i’d play on switch.
---
Between both the pistols Alibi has, only the shotgun-pistol has a red dot sight
---
Just let me have an option to turn off the skins client side.
---
I mean I play Xbox so I feel like it’s not going to effect the game much in any way. The recoil and sight picture might actually just make it worse for Vigil. But we will see
---
Ahhhhhhh

rare image of a wild jägger dabbing in the corner of a wall

Not to be a sick but *come on man

If you have the defuser planted, and this happens, the attacker wins. If not, the defender gets the win.

Personally i love maverick. His gadget is perfect for cheeky angles and flushing out anchors from hiding spots. I would buy maverick just for the cheeky plays.
---
I mained nomad for a while and she was fun but ive mained mav for a month and a half now and he's still fun
---
Yeah but it might not matter if it was the biggest map. the game would have to track more people on a larger enviroment. hey i could be wrong it could work amazingly but the game already struggles in some places. maybe one day we might see if it works.
---
that would mean actually fixing their shitty game.
---
so not likely.
---
for honor has similar prpblems.
---
Jackal is pretty solid, and even though he’s getting reworked next season, his guns are great and he has a unique advantage in having a secondary shotgun for utility. Zofia is pretty solid too, her gun is similar to the L85 that Thatcher and Sledge have, and her gadget is great too. Capitao has decent guns but an amazing gadget and he’s 3 speed. However, I think gridlock would be the best. Her guns are great, she has a secondary shotgun, her gadget is super duper useful for when the defuser is planted or denying a flank, and she’s just a lot of fun. The only downside is that she’s 1 speed, but that doesn’t make her a bad pick at all.
---
How is Mira’s not possible?
---
You should currently be able to connect to the game. [Have you contacted Ubisoft Support yet](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New)? Make sure you include a screenshot of the error code you are getting.

Epstein might’ve killed him self idk

personally i couldnt tell the difference from the 48 and 128 tick server, but thats my personal experience from the test.

I guess a better point on a unified player base is now that there is unranked newcomer is pointless, sure i guess it only breaks up the player base until they are level 50 but it would make more sense to throw them into unranked where they can be around more experienced players to help the learning curve. i notice alot of new players make the same mistakes and my only guess is that these mistakes are what level 45's do in newcomer so then the level 5's just think thats what you got to do.

My reaction was looking at the camera far back.
---
Hubble, are you okay?
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Atleast they have skill I don't see you come up with an idea and draw a demonstration of it.
---
I had an idea something like this a while back, but instead of 6 it was 10, and it was like a capture the flag type thing where you could respawn
---
You make me laugh so hard
---
Nevermind that, are they playing it on fuckin split screen?
---
Uplay is down, like yesterday.
---
&gt; oldiers without characters that you can releate with.
---
...wait, what?
---
Pitch black ion one side, completely transparent on the other.
---
neither was anyone else. you are attempting to win a game that nobody else is playing.
---
U know what the sprint butten is right. Consel players pfft
---
The BR Portuguese voice acting is really good too.
---
Drugs?? Not even once.
---
Ah lol.  The wording threw me off a little😂 thank you though
---
People can hear you sprint it gives you away
---
I got you thank you!
---
Why thank you, I made it myself

Therapist: Vigil with a mouth can't hurt you. He's not real.

Vigil with a mouth:

Realistically it isn't always beneficial. A guy on 50 HP could win the round, then your 50 damage doesn't matter. Additionally, headshots and melee kills are one shots - if you do 99 damage to someone and they disengage, then your teammate gets a headshot on them later, your damage didn't matter. 
---
Though yes, it often does matter.
---
Yeah, gotta keep our realism up, like holograms, cloaked poison mines or small canisters creating 20 big spike mats when thrown
---
One day.... one day.......
---
I am well aware of the fact that the game is not realistic. Was just pointing it out in this gadget
---
I think bringing back real doors would be an awesome addition to a future season.
---
Must have been a while since you played then
---
no za warudo edit?
---
Sprinting too much creates noise, too much noise and they know where you are. This doesn’t have to be a game of speed, it can be one of patience too. Just because I play differently doesn’t mean you have to shit on me for it.
---
They also had a part where the kids played la noire

Shooted down

Agreed- As A PC player who plays at gold to plat range, I have NEVER been even shot at while I was outside the building with a bosg. The only time I even attempted to spawnperk with the BOSG was when he got the ACOG in the TTS.
---
Shit I just found out me and glaz have the same first name 🤯🤯🤯
---
Nobody does lol
---
in his bio it should mention the time he shot at Cypriot National guard, cause an diplomatic incident and lost 15 operators, a C-130 and a jeep during a failed raid
---
He got spawnpeeked
---
Exactly.
---
You seem like you'd be great at parties. &gt;!Mostly to clear everyone out when it's over.!&lt;
---
The other response is incorrect. I am not sure about what happens if defuser is planted, however if it is not planted the game will go into double overtime. Go to about 31 minutes, 20 seconds in to this video to see  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEaP6cHS7ss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEaP6cHS7ss)
---
This is my real gameplay
---
That’s crazy
---
Well both are saw's
---
you know what you’re right, i think i watched this video a long while ago and forgot
---
No wonder you have the diamond charm with all that pure skill
---
Grandissimo
---
This happened to me too! Weird because the first round it was fine, then 2nd round the pic was in the way.
---
Shouldn’t have cheated then
---
I think in Insurgency Sandstorm they made it so your bullets will go exactly where the gun is pointing, so laser pointers actually have a purpose.
---
Not confirmed
---
.
---
That’s normal, the more game you play, the less you win/lose elo.
