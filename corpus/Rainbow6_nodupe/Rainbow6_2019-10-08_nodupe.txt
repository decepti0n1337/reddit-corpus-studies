I just learned about this from a siege video I believe it's called a "block room" and it's to add lighting to the face/overall picture
---
How
---
TBH I hate game chat. 90% of people don't know how to make callouts/make wrong callouts/wont stop bitching about how they died/try to backseat game. If you start the game by asking who has mics, thats almost an immediate mute from me.
---
Aight bruh we get it stop posting this garbage
---
Pc fan maybe
---
I dont understand how you died? Is the wall able to be penetrated?
---
Mnk

no it was a destinct male breath it wasn't a consistent sound

Can we ban console clips on this sub?? I feel like it’s cheating???

This is very common rotation, you didnt exactly discover America here + wasting c4 like that when you can just shoot out a window is very stupid.
---
I don't think it's clear enough why don't you post it again for the 10th time.
---
I never ask who has a mic, i just roll with it and if they die and just stay quiet ask them who and where hoping that I'll get an answer
---

That might be from a ddos

some breaths were longer some where shorter what actually made me notice was that there was one big long loud breath that startled me while watching the video

Yea I saw it

There are multiple reports of this shot happening on some small weird forums but it mostly ends with nobody finding a solution or the people just accepting their fate

That’s the thing man I got a lot of friends I play with on a different console and I can hang with mid to high bronze hell even low silver on a good game but I can’t queue up with anyone in bronze it’s whack

This is either a shitpost or you don’t know what hallucinations are.
---
It gave back 6, I haven’t lost 6 elo this season... like wtf
---
I disagree with the three speed and certain weapon changes. 
---
New equipment?
---
I gained back 6 elo from playing against a hacker
---
The only time I've seen someone get consistent success with fuze shield was with the PMM and he doesn't even ads in most situations. He just uses the hipfire and only takes shots when it's at the most accurate. This means he's: crouching, not moving, and not blocking fire with the shield.
---
[deleted]
---
I place them near the hostage so if the enemy blows them up the hostage gets killed. Why do I get blamed instead if they are the ones that detonated it? It is simply lazy programming and bad design.
---
 Outta ask about the bearing but realized it’s 3D printed
---
Why are you covering their gamer tags
---
a) I approve
---
b) I really want a special gamemode with insanely OP operators (either new ones like this guy that just combine Operators or just incredibly buffed stats). Imagine this blitz, a mute that takes over drones, a twitch drone that can shoot, Blackbeard with an unbreakable shield, yokai shooting Gu, Fuze putting down multiple charges and igniting at the same time or our Lord walking with his MG. There are probably way cooler examples than what I can come up with rn.
---
c) seeing as how much nerfing Blitz got in the past I think this is a valuable buff. Seriously, the cool down on the shield and the incredibly slow ADS-time sucks, I used to be feared, now I am really thinking of switching mains because I don't survive two encounters (that and shields still not working reliably).
---
It’s called weapon saftey
---
Bruh you scaring me over here
---
this made me really paranoid the first thing I did was question my sanity
---
This also means if the attackers detonate them we get blamed and they get a free win instead of it screwing them over for not being careful.
---
Amazing
---
But people who start by asking who has a mic always have no idea how to communicate.
---
just not to expose names ig. should i repost unedited?
---
I mean its a decent season so far. Definitely a lot better than phantom sight but still kinda subpar imo
---
I main cav at plat, and people don't understand that she's not there solely to get interrogations. A good cav is hit/run. Her gun isn't good for holding angles, so downing someone means that, in most cases, you should secure the kill and flee. At higher ranks most players aren't pushing solo when they know there's a cav.
---
okay weaboo
---
Elite skin confirmed
---
Nice
---
I had to zoom in to see that he still had health left
---
Just write GG EZ
---
Nah
---
Yeah, but what if we used it on Monty who's being used as a drone?
---
Or clash as twitches drone
---
What was with that post shot movement?

6k. Nice.

WHAT HAVE YOUR BROUGHT UPON THIS CURSED LAND

I agree, but there's also people who usually play good but might just be having a bad game so they're not playing at their best.
---
Me going crazy after
---
do you have a deviant Art profile? would love to check out more of your art :)
---
Do you think that having two primary would change your thinking on how to enter a gun fight? Say I picked up glaz’s sniper and then went and grab ash’s primary? How would you approach the rest of the round?
---
This is the reason I stopped playing lmao
---
What rank are you currently? Do you only have this issue with Ranked, or Casual/Unranked as well?
---
Me and a friend are also having this issue. I'd say it started around a week ago for the both of us, although I seem to be getting it more often.
---
Its called a prefire
---
Imagine a victory animation where a tree is standing in the middle of the group, then shatters at the base from Bucks skeleton key till it toppled over and he just puts a foot up on the stump
---
Instead well probably just get some WWII thing again

Is claptrap in the back
---
Oh my

monty or blitz?

Didn't they remove fire damage to hostage? (Capitao too) I think I read it somewhere, now I'm confused.

Damn nice play on your part. And props to actual teammate communication.

Not OP but 7

Not as unlucky as me. I bought the game back in August 2018 and still haven't been able to play multiplayer due to an error
---
oh im throwing up just THINKING of the b9 without a fh, good cosplay tho, although i think the hood could come forward a bit because hibbys so edgy she has to hide in the shadows like some weeb lord.

Ha! That sucks! As a former console user I feel ur pain

Uh... WTF

Can't wait!!

That's the first thing that came to my head.

Bandit being a tryhard no doubt, you see him checking cams and seeing the scene before he peeked

I know it sounds dumb but honestly just headshots. I know it’s not easy but it doesn’t matter how good you are if you don’t hit it. Just keep practicing and eventually It will be second nature

Now you see me

Now you don’t
---
No no no you got it all wrong 
---
Only a fuckin battleship will do
---
Perfectly balanced, as all PINGS should be*
---
I mean, it would be interesting. But from an average player standpoint, I don't know if two primaries is worth giving up another gadget or ability that could directly aid the team. My thought process is sort of like: "ok do I bring the thatcher my team needs to take this specific site, or do I bring an operator that relies on scavenging from a downed opponent to be useful?" I think that's a weak example but it displays my thought process. I feel that an operator with more utility that aids the defense/attack in a very direct would be prioritized in ranked and presumably pro-league. 
---
Don't get me wrong I think it's an interesting idea, but I personally think in most cases any other operator would be directly beneficial for a lineup. Very situational operator, in a way like... warden?
---
bruh theres gonna be some people fighting for the lowest rank now, gonna be like the champion rank but negative numbers.

It’s a tactical game bud, it’s how they made it. And Ubisoft literally said that Rainbow’s backstory is that it is a training simulator lmaoo. You just have to deal with it :)
---
Data limits bro
---
Straight facts, old siege better than new siege
---
I see the issue. You're not playing on PC
---
I hate to state obvious facts but...pc is the best in literally every single possible way, besides driving games.

True, even if you lose at the last moment it was a really entertaining match.

These are the only ones that deserves a well said gg and no the 0 - 4 ones.

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.

That would be so much more work because of how many people report people who are hackers
---
I look again, and yes you can turn off most of the hud, the only thing missing is the item bar in the middle down, and the realistic reload offcourse.
---
They other thing i use scores to "see" what i destroy with fuze's ability, like if i destroy 3 barbed wires, 1 kapkan trap and 1 frost trap i will know this window is heavely protected, probably with someone aiming at it.
---
That's surprising, I haven't really heard anyone praise stock internals except on the Real Swords/TMs. But I also haven't kept up with airsoft for the past 4-5 years and it seems like there's been a decent amount of change. 
---
Speaking of Real Sword, it's nice to see them on the market again. Now where's that M4 replica they promised us &gt;:|
---
But most people report through Siege, I'm talking outside on the Ubisoft support site you could setup and automated bot.

Old legendary. I've had it for a year or so.

Did this but on protect hostage with a bunch of randoms didn't get quite as far but it was a great time one guy spawn peeked every terrorist so we wouldn't get killed in the act while everyone else brought shotguns
---
My god yes, when I notice a teammate trying to revive a hostage after the enemy team downs them I do our team a favor and shoot them immediately

Hello KingKiller1231, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/deuoy6/video_i_made_for_a_video_im_making/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Ah good to know, haha
---
Coastline is a very good mad from the stand point of a competitive shooter. It's shaped in a square way with the middle cut out giving optimal spots for roof control and entry points. The angles around corners aren't janky like fortress. It's kinda of how you defend or enter maps and I feel that map flows very fluently because it is more roamer oriented. Gives a sense of space but also a sense of tight corners.
---
The 6P41 is hella mild on recoil if you put in any effort to control it.
---
They got so pissed when I tried to tell him what he did wrong, but I figured him being over 100 levels over me HE would know!
---
Yes he planned when his controller will disconnect the second he threw a grenade
---
Court martial lol. That is not very toxic though seems pretty mild
---
Yeah, the only AEGs I've ever thought were really great stock are LCT AEGs in general, the Elite Force 416A5, and the ASG Scorpion Evo. The parts in the SVU are by no means high tier upgrades, but with the stock spring and basic reliability and longevity mods, it seems like it'll last for a very long time and work well. And yeah, I'm super excited RS is coming back, especially because of the Type 97-b
---
Oh look what appeared again /u/F0rgemaster19
---
This is the stupidest excuse for a reddit post

Idk that would still be alot more work then needed just to let you know that

I get that just a thought

No, i mean i don't have a problem with that, but i prefer to use outline or i will end up killing my own teammates. I just want to remove the hud parts i dont need.

Anyway did they have videos or something about the story of thia game?

Reminds me of a certain Joestar....

Second one works on clash

Omg why did they change Sledge's hammer

this is why wired accessories are superior

From my understanding it's not a problem for ubi to be able to solve. MnK users have to run an emulator on their console, so that's on Microsoft and Sony's hardware

so what’s it feel like to be platinum?
---
What happened?
---
Regardless of if it can see an adapter or controller, Ubi can see the actual inputs.  And if the registered inputs are always one of 8 exact directions, you can figure out pretty quickly it's not a controller.

Honestly hard to tell. A friend of mine got -100 back in velvet shell when we had been playing for like a week. First he ducked and got bronze. Then he got placed with droppers and throwers and before he knew it he was -100.

It’s just a saying. You are right though I didn’t have time to fake. I had to stick it.

Practice in unranked. You’ll stay in the ranked mindset, but won’t have your MMR affected.

Tiny 3-5m radius, so for it to work she would need to put herself in harms way. Plus it would be like another thatcher?

The files for the skin are already in the game, but cheaters can sometimes access them with certain cheats. Like this Ela is using

No it should be giant and he should have arms pointing up to it with a cav, bandit, and echo just watching him in the background.

Anyone who is not naive and knows what people are ready to do for karma.

Not saying it HAS TO be staged but it's a high possibility, considering thathe starts recording just before throwing that grenade.
---
I won't unsee this helmet ever again. And so, won't everyone who sees this. Shame on you.
---
Finka, nanomachines have so many benefits that they would take too long to list, Nøkk, her gadget is great, Lion, his nerfs hit him hard but he has good guns and is still useful 
---
Take it all with a grain of salt from me, I haven’t played in a bit
---
Nøkk, Lion, Finka.
---
It's a personal reason since I'm a top Fragger and Nøkk works pretty well for me.
---
*Cartman voice* Sweet
---
This. At least hes not stealing credit. You people need to chill about this shit. Some people just don't care enough to look up the author. We just see a picture we like, and post it. That's how the internet works.
---
Lion is very good if you have good team coordination otherwise he is decent.
---
Finka is also good with team coordination but she can be used even if your playing solo.
---
Nøkk isn't that good, her gadget is very situational and her primary fmg is quite bad, but she gets a bonus point in my heart since she has a deagle
---
What is your problem here?
---
You didn't hit his head, he had a bosg
---
Aye I know, I love Thai Green Curry but I cant risk it because of the Kashews
---
i hoped that they would have atleast given them guerrilla styled weapons such as give the nomad ak or the russian mg to amaru but i guess im just cherry picking atm but yea atleast they didnt fuck up the defender
---
Finka, Lion, Nøkk.  Personal bias coming in
---
I could go into a lot of detail about playstyles, loadouts and team comps, but I think it's more fun to break it down like this:
---
-Nokk if you solo queue a lot. She doesn't require a lot of teamwork.
---
-Finka if you have a mic. Tell people when you're boosting and she's pretty good.
---
-Lion if you have a five stack. He shines in coordinated teams.
---
shh let the man get his free tachanka karma
---
If I was a real life operator, yes I would, yes, I would.
---
Time to go even lower
---
 Jackel cuz u like sniffing feet and frost cuz ur a trap?
---
What?
---
Background for this: ever since starting this season with Bronze V, I was on a solo-queuing spiral to hell. I saw some people say that if you're in Copper V, there's no way out when you're solo-queuing. Fools! I have seen what the depths of 800 MMR look like, and I conquered them!
---
Why the fuck were you sledging a reinforced wall though?

No i mean each alibi has 3 prismas.

15 prismas + 5 alibis = 20 alibis

Attacker: I'm thinking Montagne or Blitz, leaning more towards Blitz because he's faster. I'd want to take charge and get my team moving, no better way to get inside than to go first with a shield and tell your team to stack up behind you. It's also easier to hit targets in real life with a shield and pistol without aiming down the sights, you'd be surprised at what human hand-eye coordination can achieve. I'd be relatively safe while also being able to deal damage with my pistol.
---
Defense: Kapkan. Traps are pretty epic and realistically one of the easiest way to do damage while staying safe. If I knew my house was gonna get raided by trained operators I would go full Vietcong. Spikes and pits everywhere, false dummies that look like threats. Basically both physical and psychological terror. I also like that he's a little more stealth-oriented.
---
Still dont’t get it.

I’m not an Ash main but during the previous round when we lost, I suspected this team might not handle an aggressive push well. I was right

It's why headshots dont count its people cheating by pretending they didn't get hit
---
Number 45 in the world seems legit
---
Ah, the good ol'  knifing after a reload trying to ads and lean in quick succession, that resonated with me
---
Explain the like/dislike ratio on Youtube.
---
Most Ubisoft channels,or at least 90% of them received more dislikes than likes.
---
Even the trailer on IGN received more dislikes than likes so it's not just Ubisofts channel.
---
And even many Youtubers say that a Paid Battle Pass is unnecessary with the amount of microtransactions,from real money bundles and season passes to R6 credits content.
---
Ahhahaahha
---
Not really, no. People don't change, and there's no guarantee that the same people wouldn't be in 2 places at once.
---
This is an innocent Cav, not the monster produced by Sau-Siege.
---
Artwork right there.
---
Too right, I'm fuming.
---
We are talking about a co-op game.
---
How are you sure that each Operator comes with pre-set loadouts?
---
It's a different game,they can do quite many things differently than in siege
---
3.5s from activation.
---
Not sure about these downvotes. Seems like a well thought out response and perfectly polite
---
Its actually cool.
---
Hibana is asian isn’t she?
---
I can just hear NeebsGaming screaming off of this somehow
---
In the guaranteed epic I got a bandit uniform that was sized correctly too
---
Issue is that Ubisoft will add all the GOOD looking and limited content to the Battle Pass.
---
So if you want that really nice weapon camo and that's it,you would have to end up buying a battle pass which you didn't want because they locked it up in a paywall.
---
Console amirite
---
Yeah seriously annoying, I'd love the option to have that flashing battery icon stay permanently on the screen until you put it on charge.
---
Bruh
---
&gt;Pro league, and high level player's preferences doesn't mean shit
---
Literally nobody even in silver and gold uses it, and partly because the best in the game with over 10k hours of experience each, aka pros, don't either.
---
So, yeah, it's useless. And ubi doesn't buff supressors because there's no way you can buff them without breaking them.
---
Agree on all but last one
---
Any sauce?
---
Cursed Montaigne (auto correct)
---
Or
---
Cursed Blitz
---
Forgot flamie shield boi
---
tbh, i didnt know for a long time reload cancelling even existed in this game. I fully agree with removing it. When I played CS:GO, ammo management was important, if I heard you reload at a wrong time I pushed you, and the amount of times I died from reloading at a wrong time was not trivial. 
---
I kept applying the push when you hear them reload tactic to Siege and I thought I just mistimed the reloads but turns out you can just cancel it?? Dumb mechanic that makes absolutely no sense in a shooter like Siege
---
I especially love those "LEFT!" callouts in a 4v5 with no further information given.
---
People usually don’t like players who derank, what are your reasons mate
---
while it won't make it always even out it "should" make it better
---
That or Denmarks National day aka Grundlovsdag wich is the 5th lf june.
---
Why do botted post always have 4k upvotes and less than 100 comments
---
Same here, I don't play r6s anymore so I don't have tried recently.
---
I dunno. Honestly for me it depends on, and this may sound weird, whatever game I play first that day. If I play R6 First, I have a game like I did awhile ago and get 10+ kills as F2 recruit. But on a bad day I can't even get kills as clash.
---
Oh my bad. Thanks
---
No
---
Yup for sure. I just get a kick every time I see "random" used in mass consumer products / software :)
---
If you can lower the audio but take away only 50% of the damage it take away now, that would make it really useful. Rushers and marksmen will find it useful, and support and flex players will stick to normal barrels, so basically, a good split.
---
Not *nice*.

You're comparing an April fools day event to the base character model though.
---
But the thing is, if a birthday challenge does appear for Nøkk, wouldn't that expose her birth date which is supposedly redacted?
---
we were on the verge of greatness,we were this close
---
I'd say a lot of responsibilities can have that effect.
---
I have simmilar problem; sometimes i don't even know what the fuck is going on and i make 2-6 stats and sometimes when i'm focused and nothing bothers me i make 8/10-4
---
Shut up, nerd

Psychological warfare. That one second delay when you're thinking this exact line of thought is the one second it takes for you to die.
---
I'm not taking it as an insult I'm just saying that playing cod, bf or borderlands is in no way related to liking to have something to freshen up the game.
---
Fuze is wearing mutes outfit.
---
&gt;I provided the source
---
No you provided us a picture
---
Then I guess Cav is a Terminator
---
Hah, why's that? The awkward doorframe bump?
---
Win 5 rounds as GIGN to show support on Docs birthday to recieve a shitty charm

Destruction- fuze probably

Have you heard of the concept of place the links in the description, it's quite popular on YouTube, I kinda emulated that here. (Said as sarcastically as possible)
---
I like the attention to detail at the top
---
Weird I play her alot never looted with me scanner but is a weird thing to show distance
---
Of the hostages life, bless that choice
---
when you want to play specific operator for challenges but team goes full recruit
---
If I can remember ill try and pull a clip from my stream when I wake up
---
winnie the poo doesn't like guns
---
I don't know if is this the case but it could lead to significantly longer queue times as a lot of people specifically have hostage turned off and if you have only hostage on that means you don't matchmake with them.
---
As a newbie I can confirm that it's, indeed, not that bad, if you just pay some attention and don't attack like a horde of cracked up apes a.k.a. 80% of my teammates...
---
I do, I just have the response time of a mole rat

I know, but all Ubi sees is M O N E T I Z A T I O N

Yeh so my username. Not my flair but i guess that too.

I’d tell you, but then I’d have to kill you

unpopular opinion but this design suck, gritty and dark. this design just scream 2014 to me and look out of place in the modern design language
---
No, you see, the stretched image makes it easier to throw drones through windows...

WAIT IS THAT CAVS  NAME

Next season is the full battle pass. This season will have a small one they said

This present should go to mute

The dog could disable explosives

*dink*
---
I know. I read your other reply.
---
My point is, it isn't really a problem to spread awareness on. My point wasn't about you spending 40 minutes eating Pringles (though if you did, I'd want some cause we don't get Pringles here)
---
Not something I expected to say today... But Pulse is downright adorable!
---
Thanks
---
Ok that's pretty cool
---
Maybe, but she still looks ridiculous with it imo.
---

chanka funny give updoots

I could go for some kuchen now

You can't interrogate if you can't ambush, and ambushing requires you to blend in or hide, it's hard to hide with white face paint.
---
Still an utter non sequitur

Okay cool I've been out of the loop for a while busy with MGSV

No if you pause on the zoom in, it was on his neck.

Hello LaresLP, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/df10y3/increase_in_no_footstep_audio_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Ooh yeah. I remember getting legit upset at how shit they were.
---
Although if I'm being honest, these new skins are a marginal improvement.
---
Bottom left, it says his ping all throughout the clip. Jumps to 200 when the lag starts
---
This is the scariest thing to exist
---
cosmetics only still isn't an excuse to add more microtransactions,especially another paywall which might force players to spend money on so they are able to get the best limited time cosmetics
---
Ur mum gets wet
---
No,the warning comes about an hour+ before it dies.
---
I'd say a good 25 to 30 mins
---
Love it!
---
You fire before you reach their neck
---
Kafe and bank are great maps and are balanced, I feel theme park is good for defenders but bad for attackers
---
They have fun instead of taking everything seriously. Which is a sin on this site and in siege
---
Ping spike can be the result of packet loss. Bad ping generally means consistently high. Again I’m not an expert but that’s my understanding of networks
---
Well, its optional + its just cosmetics, so who cares
---
Sure you lose out on cosmetics, so what boo huu
---
Hotel?
---
This being transparent makes this confusing on mobile
---
not to forget fortress! now let‘s get rid of chalet and skyscraper as well :&gt;

I know it’s Goyo...autocorrect killed me.

It's funny how you clearly don't get the point.

Not surprised as majority of the people here try to suck ubis d*ck and have an iq below 50
---
WHERE DID YOU GET THE MASK??????
---
Technically fighting terrorists is not considered war, so war crimes do not apply

I'm feeling this💯

Pretty sure it’s more about the fact that he killed himself.
---
I like it. Mainly because of the fade from black to blue to white. It’s a nice complimentary colour scheme. I can understand why you would say that’s it’s overrated though, most people use it just because it’s an epic skin that hasn’t been in the game since Season One of Year One.
---
After mine got shot I would probably be more inclined to go for the person to avenge my dog
---
But even so, they could’ve at least acknowledged that it could be an accident
---
Anyone would be
---
Me too :(

Hello BadIdeaIsAGoodIdea, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/df14rr/ubi/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Was it out of rage?
---
SHES GOT A GUN. IM SCARED.
---
#Quit
---
Yall forgetting when the reward was a charm of the operators gadget... the black eye and shock drone charms..
---
Ranked is a completely different experience from casual and you should notice immediately, I’ve been playing since  Operation Dust Line so I know my way around the game by now and here’s a few things you should know:
---
-Map knowledge: This one is pivotal, probably one of the most important factors there is. Take time to study the maps a little bit and get to know the bomb spots on maps that come up in ranked often such as bank or something. 
---
You can do this in custom matches too and just get a feel for the maps.
---
-Team play: I was really shy to get on the mic when I started off playing but I really shouldn’t have been, most people in ranked are nowhere near as toxic as the ones in casual and should be very happy to have someone give them callouts and stuff. 
---
Map knowledge also comes into play for effective callouts here.
---
-Operators : Get one or two operators on offense and defense each that you feel comfortable and are at least decent with, this is kind of a given and pretty self understandable but you should also consider if the operators you’re playing are providing valuable assistance for your team witch their gadgets. 
---
For example someone like Vigil has a cool Gadget and everything but it doesn’t really benefit his team as a whole as opposed to other “Roaming” operators such as Bandit/Caveira/Jäger. 
---
In general you should also always consider what kind of edge your gadget provides for your team.
---
And lastly, just know the role you’re playing. What I mean by this is that you really shouldn’t go for risky stuff most of the time in ranked, because while peeking attackers as a defender might work sometimes in casual it will not work as often simply because players are going to be more skillful there. 
---
Obviously risky plays pay off here and there and I don’t say that you never should go for it in a 50/50 situation but at the end of the day, better be safe than sorry.
---
That’s about all I can think of off the top of my head, which ever way it’s going to go have fun and don’t forget that it’s still a game which is made to be enjoyed so don’t be too hard of yourself if you don’t find immediate success.
---
Ahah, so high 😂😅
---
I like fuze's and kapkan's the best
---
yeh, it feels like they definitely have improved. Don't know if it's Placebo or if they've changed something.
---
Max 45, min 15. So I'd say 30 minutes.
---
Because they switched to the worst server with 4 teams jeez i wonder how they did that...
---
No only I do

awesome cosplay! how long did it take you to get all the stuff required and planning?
---
It's best you don't ask
---
Lmao
---
*fookin laser sights*
---
I absolutely love the Mira skin but her animation sucks, for the animation I would have to pick Jager
---
Well even with kapkan you can know which trap was activated without being that close so I guess it will be the same with this operator and even easier because you have less traps. I find similarity as you take damage and after the bleed is comparable to the 4 damage of the lesion trap. A good lesion doesn’t even need the little icon above the mine he knows which one was activated it just to be able to find them is you forget where you put them and make it easier to pick them up.
---
Literally just look at the weapon stats
---
Zofia... wtf
---
We should get the “echo flying on his drone animation” for lion
---
The correct answer is: more accurate than Ubisoft.
---
Yep, I went to King George’s stream right after the game go check! I can link the vod if you’d like!

At the beginning of the season I was testing out armu on the same map and then an enemy decided to spawn peek from one of the bedrooms I don't know how I did it but I got a head shot with the SMG 11 and he didn't hit me once
---
For beating 3 no name teams? Not going to happen.
---
I mean I love dogs but I also really like the idea of a K9 operator in the game and also if the enemy team kills the dog then they got 1 angry motherfucker to worry about
---
It's not going to happen so dw.
---
I love these comics. who s the artist?
---
It makes interrogations that should go through, by all visual indications, UI and Animations, simply not go off. How is this perfectly fine and not incredibly misleading???
---
Because of the breaching charge
---
Damn. Unlucky brother.
---
Got mine :)
---
Favorite skin is Blackbeard followed extremely closely by Thatcher, I just think both fit each extremely well.
---
Favorite MVP Animation is Bandit for me BB's and Thatcher's are way too plain while the others are too stupid IMO or don't take the crazy far enough. The idea that Bandit takes his bike all these different places the maps are is the crazy taken far enough and what makes the animation for me.
---
I bet he rushed in to kill that drone
---
Just don’t play him like a bot.
---
So many times I see people playing Monty and trying to drag out with him.You can’t kill anyone more than 5 meters from you because they have an automatic and can spray your head off.
---
And thats good
---
I don't blame him.
---
If they did add it I don't think it would be a bullet sponge I think it would have only about 50-75 health but I do agree that if it was to just stay within close proximity to the player that it would most definitely get the operator killed by giving away there position which would result in it likely having a low pick rate and I agree that it would takes months to finely tune the k9. Thanks for sharing your view
---
God I can’t wait for this, especially since we get the ops and will hopefully get more lore about them. God I want more characters interaction and lore
---
you didn't even make an attempt to turn your controller back on
---
Yeah I imagined him being like a Kapkan/Lesion hybrid honestly lol.. not just a straight up Lesion rip off tho
---
That's pointless. Echo has a stronger gun with the same benefits and you want to push people toward him? Lol good luck with that.
---
no, Ed, Edd, n Eddy
---
how do you get your videos from ps4 on here?
---
Never ever started attack here either.
---
Zofia is definitely my favorite operator recently. Her gun is fantastic and her kit is great for solo play.
---
I just always assume that it's someone else's art unless there's proof it's theirs
---
How do I get name flairs like yours
---
*CLINK*
---
Secure in ranked?
---
Aaaand you ruined the headgear for me lol
---
yeah, the SMG12 was mean pre-Grim Sky
---
I’m not talking about you specifically I don’t see your game so I can’t judge I’m saying in general.
---
Spittin’ straight facts right here
---
Nah, he uses pickle and I have proof.
---
Giggle Vigil Tickle my Pickle
---
You're probably misunderstanding the difference between a flash stun and a normal stun.
---
I’d love to see a 3rd person prospective
---
Thank you for what you do.
---
Mute is hands down the best animation as it changes the entire screen.
---
Favorite? There are a few in the S class. (Bandit, Jager, Fuze, Valk)
---
It's from may 14th
---
I assumed you were talking about the same thing
---
I don't remember much about that game how did that work?
---
How dare you, Castle is a viable option on bank on the second floor (said all snotty like and shit)
---
at this point they’ve almost certainly roam cleared the whole top floor. where is he going to get pushed from? even then you can just press y to cancel throwing the grenade, and if he’s thrown it, he’s buck and can just go down the hatch to his left with his shotty.
---
mhm
---
That’s... stupid as fuck. I have gigabit fibre so my odds of defending are next to none I guess?
---
Ahh, Twitch the waitress vs Doc the windowless van driver.
---
They both suck. So does Fortnite Smoke.
---
People drop ranks after placing their goal rank just to dick on easier people. As for playing high level opponents in casual I get that too usually the teams consists of players level 220+ while I’m only level 128. They’re usually gold or plat which isn’t really an issue bc im high gold/plat and it’s just casual but it definitely takes the “casual”ness out of the game mode
---
practise , practise , practise , Thunt to get to know the maps well , about the sound , this game uses propagation , which means sound will come from the hole closest to you and that leads to hearing left when the enemie is on the right behind the wall.
---
Only true memers use a shield.
---
Cover
---
ikr, but montage can always hear footsteps above those 100db music. And for some ass reason his kills sync up with the music all the time. If u get that operator outa nowhere ur champion
---
ahahah i figured this out myself and thought i was a genius lmaoo
---
Does he have a smoke in his mouth!? 🤔😆
---
I am just hoping they add a feature that if someone leaves before the match starts that the game is cancelled, nothing is more annoying then playing competitive and being stuck in a 4v5.
---
Quick maffs
---
Don’t make fun of his popsicle!
---
OH YEAH

it's facing into master so no, just peek the window and pop it

Echo/Maestro, hate being on cams when I’m alive.
---
I don't think that would really work and if they did that spawnpeaking would be even worse
---
Now all you need to do is punch through unreinforced walls and drag poor souls through them, all the while yelling, "WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE?"
---
I was just thinking the same thing.
---
I seen a lot of Ela Cosplays but this one is probably the most accurate one I seen tbh
---
She's with Bandit in uh.... Eh, don't worry.
---
What is the first picture?
---
Shit, ELA’d dummy thicc.
---
B.I.G. brain time
---
Warden, fucking Warden, fuck Warden.

https://m.twitch.tv/videos/491673157 this vod start at like 35 minutes in and the kills will be in like 10 seconds

Protection from shrapnel maybe?

Oh they accidentally gave him muted birthday present

---
And......its good!!!!!!!
---
no
---
Its a great shotgun but i always tell people it doesnt make her a viable Op. Ela should be on par with Jager or Vigil in terms of roamability. Currently her gun makes her the last choice of roamer.
---
That would be terrifying. I have a very creepy picture of my Cav on a small plastic kids bike on my Instagram. You should see it.. It's on CosplayAndCollection😂
---
look where you ''STEP''
---
Look at the gun the ability
---
666
---
Yes
---
Says the ela main
---
Recruit no doubts
---
and the reason they nerfed it  to hell is also dumb imo, just because they dont want to remove it from Vigil loadout, two other ops who could really use it  have to suffer
---
Nice Adam’s Apple.     Yuhhhggg
---
Holy crap. That fast? It’s only been a couple hours lol
---
Nice sink
---
I have two things for this idc if there good or not 
---
1 Maybe the k9 should be like a drone, it has a camera on the back o you can see that it sees and it wouldn’t do much damage rather it could knock people to the ground until they kill it somewhat like an airjab. 
---
2 It could be like a thing that follows you around marking the growl noises until you send him off to get and enemy and it the enemy gets out of the line of sight of you the dogs comes back or you can send it Otto a room to see if an enemy is is there.
---
Now if there is a dog op then we need when you win a round if the dog is alive he come back and jumps on you and licking you it’s just so cute to imagine
---
Still waiting brah
---
Good bo- wait
---
Well it’s the biggest event in R6 so yeah it sell up fast.
---
Same bro, just saw the pic on Twitter
---
Do you crash instantly at the desktop?
---
What if both teams try to ban the same character?
---
It actually looks really cool. 
---
Makes the ACOG useless but still.
---
Why get rid of content that’s my honest question for the devs of ubi
---
I think it’s Thermite
---
Simple? I have 144 hz monitor but i cant play 144 fps because oh this freaking bug. I cap my fps at 60 and still have like 90-95% cpu usage. Fuck ubisoft
---
Classy dress sense? Must be a neckbeard. Maybe he's just a posh twat?
---
I think we can all agree that Ela is off the table for this one.
---
Is that the only one that glows?
---
That is very well build. I once build an fully sized at with a scope. However, younger brothers can be destructive
---
It’s almost like you’re ms. Bosak herself nice job
---
&gt; all I need are tits
---
Don't let your dreams be dreams. I'm pretty sure the cosplayer doesn't have them either.
---
What cpu do you have? I can already guess.
---
Buff warden, castle, and a minor buff to frost’s smg firerate
---
Nerf echo, jackel, and a minor nerf to Maverick
---
I can here him saying "charmed" in his not at all upper class, slightly northern accent.
---

I don’t spawnpeak but I’m not really bothered by it, I don’t get peaked very often anyway
---
I guess

Cpu that came out 1 year before this game came out.
---
nokk is pretty good, whats wrong with her?
---
what rank are you
---
Shift+f2
---
M'lady
---
Unfortunately, those accusations aren’t ever going to go away. Unless Sony and Microsoft decide to crack down on people using emulators for M&amp;K (which they won’t), there’s always gonna be that shadow of doubt whether or not someone is cheating or if they’re just good.
---
If you are buying physical copies of the advanced edition, you'll get 1 code per game, which you can then redeem for the 600 credits and the outbreak packs. I was able to redeem multiple codes from the advanced edition on my PSN account.
---
if we ignore  the logistics, it would actually make him a more viable operators  being  the only Zofia hard counter, and potentially  it will also add a great synergy between his gadget and ela mines
---
They should just enable OC on this subreddit maybe that would help A BIT
---
Probably some god damn haters...
---
I would've but i stupidly had the leaderboard and the menu open at the same time.
---
Honestly just nerf her mag capacity to the 30 round like the model suggest and give it acceptable recoil ffs.
---
Sometimes I wonder why ubisoft just didn't do this in the first place???
---
Like the headgear and uniforms for that specific season? Cause its a slim chance but you can still get them in alpha packs.
---
Why aren't your eyes all wonky?
---
Put a download on while you’re searching for a game. Might work
---
This is the best Lea cosplay I’ve seen
---
Crispy cream
---
1 would be pretty cool. 
---
2 I don't think it should growl the whole time but if it spots an enemy before you do, I think it should face the person and growl or bark depending on distance. 
---
I think the dog jumping on you and licking you would be a really cool elite MVP animation
---
Ima classic man🎵🎶

Hello choochye, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/df4g9k/i_panicked_and_shot_back/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Gold
---
I agree. The way they designed her pre nerf made it impossible to nerf the gun without making it shit.
---
Yes. Mouse and keyboard allows much more fluid and precise aiming than a standard controller does. In a game like Siege, where one headshot kills anyone, it creates an unfair advantage.
---
You both need to spend more time in terrorist hunt holyyyyy. Y'alls aim is trash
---
I think she’s in a really good place now. She’s surprising in higher rank and she can work if you rush. She’s not bad she’s not op she’s balance and that completely fine.
---
Weebs. Weebs and tumblr.
---
I would play him if they took away the ability to scan the footprints at all. Still helpful for finding roamers.

NICE

Better question: why is Siege on console if Ubisoft doesn’t care about it?
---
Bruh sounds like he’s in a empty fish tank
---
Can i get an OOF my brothrrs and sisepters
---
Cav pls?
---
But I want to shoot a dog
---
The F2 doesn't need a nerf people are just crybabies
---
You know what , I'm not even gonna say anything
---
as a twitch main i can confirm the F2 is op as my it it’s cause it only has vertical recoil which is easy to control and high rof
---
It’s the most op assault rifle on attack
---
It doesn't even have the highest DPS
---
Iraq OPs. One has an exploding drone (25hp to OPs and onehit for all gadgets in 1m radius). Another one might have something of a cornershot i think. That would be a cool addition to the game
---
and this was just after i lost my plat match :(
---
nice
---
&gt; **5 POINTS OF BLEED DAMAGE AFTER ITS REMOVED.**
---
How hard is that for you guys to understand? Its not tick damage, DOT, just 25 points of damage overall. Geez.
---
I wouldn't mind giving a one second lionish warning. Gives people mid firefight a second to prepare
---
training sim
---
When the sound breaks and you hear nothing but heartbeat for the next three rounds
---
Didnt knew she could be even more THICC
---
Pretty cool idea but that would be too much work for Ubi to not charge us 100$ for it.
---
Reinforcements destroy whatever they're touching once you finish them
---
100% for sure Jackal was u/I_wana_fuck_twitch
---
Its wholy based on opinion but there definitely are more popular picks. Some of best defense ops IMO are Jager,Lesion,Echo,Maestro, Doc, Bandit and Valkyrie. On attack, Zofia, Hibana, Jackal, Buck and Ying.
---
Keeping the compensator on it with 3 round burst fire helps a lot. But it doesn't help the fact that the recoil makes the gun complete trash.
---
This feature is disabled on console
---
The rof is too high even twitch mains agree
---
You can't lean without aiming in console.
---
Rats are dogs now?
---
Ok?
---
Just curious... why would you want to?  (I'm also on console, but I wanna just know what I'm missing out on)
---
I prefer high ads sensitivity and low horizontal/vertical
---
Like 24:24 h/v and 86 ADS with 5 deadstick
---
I have nothing against Twitch, but just seeing her bot makes me wanna throw myself off a cliff :D
---
Yeah we got it, you told us like 5 times already!
---
You dont.
---
It’s because he’s not leaning much and isn’t preaiming well, so it looks like a controller
---
Some Valkyrie cam locations mostly. But apparently it's disabled on console for some reason.
---
Free kills. Lol
---
Yeah I just have more fun playing hibana and maverick over thermite.
---
It personally dodgy bother me as much.
---
I agree with the Turkish operator but in that unit a new sniper with and a bolt action sniper with some random gadget. And an outside map like a forest or something. I really wanna see something bigger than the 3v3 and more complex. Preferably a rain forest.
---
Amazing cosplay, but do you have the Ela booty doe
---
And Dokk
---
&gt;rare chance of pulse or smoke to be your opponent
---
So 2 of the best and most useful defenders are rare now?
---
Yeah, this is like spot on
---
&gt;takeomeow
---
most of the comments here are so nice! aaaa my heart
---
Everyone is viable to a degree, but the only arguably "useless" operators are Warden and *Tachanka.* I've seen some people argue Glaz and Nokk are the worst of the attackers atm, as well.
---
Or a better solution: just remove some of the lighting on maps.
---
Theres the answer thanks
---
I wish I wasn't so lazy. I would love to cosplay.
---
I don't know what happened to the official patch notes, maybe they got taken down because they're so old. But here's the next best thing. https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Six_Siege_patches/Patch_5.0
---
\*sigh\* take my upvote and go
---
finka isn’t op...  a lot of people agree her ability hurts more then it helps. you have no recoil which will cause the a player to innately pull down and control your recoil you get the annoying heartbeat sound and the blue tint that cuts your side vision. and lion does have counters you either don’t move, use vigils gadget or stay close to a mute jammer. and it’s not like he sees you though the walls anymore and isn’t picked much
---
6. Their fathers have limited involvement in their life
---
I think most of us know about it
---
At least you can play it, I havent been able to play the game for 5 months. Stupid error code 6-0x on xbox
---
But what’s the point if I can shoot one in r6
---
"Titanium blades... they cut through diamonds"

"I'm not wearing any diamonds"

 But... I think I'm gonna have a stroke then.

I've set my stuff to 16:9 with 75 FOV. I find low FOV makes everything in the middle big but I see less of my sidelines. While high FOV makes my middle tiny but lets me see alot more of my sidelines. So I went for the middle ground.
---
Respectable Slav squat 👍
---
for real i hate when people do that drones are the greatest tool an attacker have and people just let them get shot when you basically know where they are before the round starts
---
Exactly
---
Press cancel after 1:30 then start a new one
---
One bullet and a dream up in here
---
I just want to see any operator with a glock.
---
For age ratings, the game meets criteria for PEGI17. For overall game mechanics, aesthetics and amount of fake hype around it, it is clear the game main audience are minors, around 15-16 years old. Just look how far the game went from Tom Clancy's books and even previous Rainbow6 games, and how much of that revolves around flashy/cartoony weapons and operators skins, that has nothing to do with lore and everything to do with cheap monetization strategy based of the fact that kids like to show off.
---
upside down repel is fine he’s just complaining like a silver does
---
i play max fov
---
Outside maps won’t work in the main game mode of siege. Showdown worked because it a 3vs3 and there’s only one possible objective and in this mode you 95% of the time for kills so obj in pretty much useless.
---
In most cases when there is something in the way you are unable to even try to reinforce. Sometimes something is put at just the right spot to allow reinforcing but will destroy the thing.
---
That reload stumble on the way back to site too lol
---
I've had this glitch before. It reversed my game sounds and I couldn't hear sound on drones or cams for the rest of the game. Had to restart my console
---
Happy. Cake day
---
Yup I rejoined the match and was able to play, no audio whatsoever
---
End of round cam keeps it good!
---
🧂 🧂 🧂
---
Damn, that's shitty
---
Glad I could make you laugh :D
---
feels bad man i don't think i can get plat this season is it the same for other people?
---
Thats a very good idea since this game is all about listening
---
I bet his teammate said “bro you can nade it” before this happened
---
Oh shit she thicc
---
As a Kapkan Main on defense, I approve this message
---
Please, the last thing we want is a another wannabe with a sweaty name on console.
---
Rare to see a cosplayer who’s face looks like the character
---
She always has some of the best cosplays
---
That's a nice bathroom.
---
She used to have no recoil, but that was a long time ago
---
How sweaty? Funny or Annoying? I'm good at both
---
Its console
---
I think that they should just get a different version of the game that removes all the blood skulls and what not, but still allows them to play with everyone else.
---
I know it kind of ends up screwing over players who have actually learned all the maps. I hate it when games pander to new players instead of taking care of the older ones.
---
So... accurate?
---
Yep, always doc
---
Always doc
---
I like the dokkabei/Ela combo on your case? 🤔
---
I have got defence first 31 out of my 35 games, I heard it was to do with how far away you are from the server and I am from NZ on an AU server so decently far away with consistently 50-60 ping  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Ubi adds a feature where they auto detect your dog and make the dog in game look like the one you own
---
nothing on the current sound bugs in the game? (IE thermite/hibana charges not making noise when being deployed)
---
I would be very happy if arms and legs could be shot through. The amount of times that somebody flinches, gets Sofia/ela mined or takes any damage and their hands protect their face is crazy.
---
Its my favorite one.
---
Sombra? Overwatch? Call of duty?
---
He said dooty!!!
---
now you'll get downvoted because the trash bronze players on this sub think spawn peaking or even looking through a window is overpowered and unhonorable
---
if you want spy as in stealth, then you can go vigil and nokk. if you want spy as in intel gethering you can go cav or dokkeabi
---
I like it but I wish it was just an option. Then again, they would likely still need separate buttons for attackers and defenders as it seems to load the rosters separately
---
Nice.
---
Is this console?
---
hell yeah, super hyped to go!
---
I was so amazed about what the enemy team was doing then I looked at his toolbar
---
Sometimes the canister cannot be shot (like on the Kafe skylight), if they check isn't that good as well because they cannot drop there? Imagine not being able to drop down the hatches, your only entry point is windows and stairs. It's like a Mira, it might not get kills but simply it's existence is a deterrent.
---
literally any op with nades/explosives: Im about to end this mans whole career.
---
I agree completely

Play PC. You have some sort of recoil assist on console. However, I do agree that the recoil is not that bad. Just take some time to learn the pattern and any gun is usable.

woah she’s really good!

what kind of madman uses the amethyst skin?? makes it look like a smurf shat all over your gun.
---
I’m mad that I have the full maestro cowboy outfit and gun skin and I can’t get his operator portrait in game
---
And then they forgot about it and want something more
---
You’re right. I’m just stupid.
---
Do you want a round of applause or something?
---
fuck im exposed
---
They definitely would not be able to make arms able to be penetrated because imagine the insane amount of damage you'd take if someone shot through your character's arm and into their chest. That's more damage than necessary, especially how it is now with arm shots counting as chest shots. First person flinch seems like a good idea but would get old very quickly especially on console. And removing it would seem very unrealistic, not saying the game is super realistic now but someone taking 4 shots from the scorpion and having no reaction would just look so wrong. They definitely need to tone down the flinch from getting shot to try and prevent the arms from blocking the head but with concussion and stuns, the effect is almost nonexistent because it rarely comes into play.
---
Bruh the dude in the sweatshirt spooked me but other than that nice
---
aye yall got any soup?
---
Ubisoft did not want to maintain two different codes for the same game. because it would increase their dev time for debugging the new ops and maps. 
---
But they could maintain the two and just make it so China ver is delayed by a month or something
---
That Ela cosplay is excellent in every aspect, it looks identical to in-game.

So like 6 defender elites this year I’m guessing it will be in year five season 1

I would

its like photoshopped from the game lol. its just perfect

Twitch, i feel like I’m cheating when I play her.
---
This looks really good
---
What's the source on the grunting guy at the end? Keep seeing/hearing it, but I can't find it.
---
his traps are too good. they shouldnt do damage, but i think the developers dont want to remove that because that removes a counter for shields especially Montagne. beside that, Lesion traps are good enough for intel that it doesnt need to do damage.
---
That’s kinda scummy
---
This is such a great cosplay, nice job!

u/takeomeo

---
What does scummy mean? My english is not that good and Google translater couldn't help me.
---
It all depends on what’s fast for you, I know Xbox diamonds with a 30-30 and 25 ads,
---
I got my first plat 1 with 42V-83H and 37ADS and my first diamond with 42V-65H and 32ADS.
---
I ended up getting slower the better i got at the game because controller aim buildup without aim assist works like this:
---
Beginners shoot and get lucky hits because they can’t control recoil, aim or movement properly. Advanced beginners will have general movements and aim control but fail to control recoil and flicks. Regulars will have some sort of recoil control and great movement control, aiming and flicking are good but improving. Advanced regulars (high golds) will have full control over movement and recoil, but still struggle with flicks and precise crosshair placement.
---
Now we have reached plat territory. There are two types of players in plat essentially. Those who aim and those who don’t aim.
---
The Aimers play a low sens, they know where people will be so they pre aim and pre fire, the low sens helps with precise micro flicks and recoil control, but turn on shots are hard. They have an easier time with low rof guns and half automatics.
---
The non aimers will prefer fast movement and reaction shots, they see or hear something they will spray in the general direction while making most of their shots depend on their reaction speed, not their aim. They have an easier time with full auto and high rof guns.
---
Big difference is that aimers actually control where the bullets go while non aimers don’t control, they react. Sure they have recoil control and all the necessary skills but they rarely slowly control the aim even in hipfire, they will flick and turn and do all the crazy fast stuff tho.
---
I personally am a non aimer. I can‘t snipe for shit and pistols are the bane of my existence but give me a nice high rof full auto and I will absolutely make someone’s life miserable.
---
Never realized they added a shock wave animation
---
Snowflake

She isn’t picked at all at higher ranks. She’s a horrible operator.
