I really doubt it but if it is he’s hiding it well

There are 10 other operators behind bb in pick rates and a bunch more if you look at the [win rates](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-347920-16/y4s13-designers-notes). 
---

---
Also this is pure round pick/win rates not individual gunfights and holding corners that has a effect outside of pure win/loss in a match.
---
What if I sneeze?
---
Finka: Is this a personal attack?
---
Did pulse just decide not play play how is operator is best utilized and blow sledge while droning...?
---
Is this effecting Xbox as well?
---
Figure it out? Google it? You're asking a soft question.
---
Rogue 9 has a video on how attachments work. Find that?
---
Yeah but jäger and ela and probably more ops have only bw and shield. They'd be left without anything unless they got temporary gadgets
---
People just dont like shooting at someone they cant kill
---
Restart ur game. Happend to me today
---
You have to have 100 hours played with each operator
---
Ddoss
---
Whatever gun, red dot, suppressor, laser sight
---
She is good, one interrogation and that could be round over for the offense. She is a dangerous opponent and people just rather not have to go against her.
---
Clash was just a regular police officer.
---
Nope i think he was a noob😂😂
---
Really? I thought it was like a flair thing
---
I love that show
---
Restart your game. Happened to me yesterday and restart worked
---
We're two different people have you ever thought people are offended by different shit than you
---
She was brought back this season with the new patch.
---
You literally have her as your profile picture
---
She can utilize teammates barbed wire. No barbed wire on defense sounds a lot worse than no clash.
---
Worst idea ever
---
I've been wondering about this trend of vertical recording of only a portion of the screen. Do people have a phone stand and record their gameplay that way?
---
Nah it’s a flair
---
RIP sledge
---
Well most of the time a fuze will just relocate if he’s being shot at, idk lol
---
I have galaxy brain
---
WTF, no, you cant pick up barbed wire from your m8.
---
[removed]
---
How do you do the flair then ?
---
Mom come pick me up I'm scared
---
The crazies are out?
---
It was sarcasm my guy I’m sorry 
---
I love you
---
Because people cant be bothered to drone apparently
---
Infinity and beyond brain
---
Wrong playstyle for that sight. I personally dont use acog except on maestro or doc and sometimes hibana. Other than that I use red dot and holo but I'm a maverick main so im usually up in the enemies faces in closer ranges. You cant hold angles let alone long angles with those sights. Also with hard breaches like hibana and thermite you're better off with an acog.
---
And now there’s a new sustainable energy source we should talk about.
---
Then them people who would are in this game for all the wrong reasons
---
Tbh I'm really glad that clash is getting removed for a bit, she is absolutely annoying in-game.
---
That’s definitely not a keyboard and mouse. Mouse is way smoother and easier to control. You can see he is pushing the joystick when he’s aiming. It’s harder to tell when people use really high sensitivity though. Controller can look like keyboard sometimes.
---
Precisely
---
By new map do you mean kafe? Cause thats doesnt have a 3 rooms that are purely defender sided.
---
I play with him and this is true
---
This is just a Normal Casual Match, nothing wrong here
---
I mean I just feel like she ain't even close to being as strong as mira or echo in bomb.
---
I would up vote but it's at 666 at the time so I don't want to ruin it
---
Ok thanks. I now really think that I’m just not doing anything having holo on her gun. Thanks for the opinion
---
You can see your KD. It just means so little in this game as someone with 3 kills and 7 deaths can be just as, if not, more important than someone with 12 kills. If you playing with a team of course
---
You can drone all you want against a cav if your playing against a good one shell down you in a heartbeat and their goes your attack round
---
Nah. You guys ruin the game. People shouldn’t be allowed to leave the building at all. Sure it’ll pop up with a notification but that isn’t enough time to react. So please stop ruining the game. Thanks.
---
Nah shes gone again.
---
And why is that?
---
Oh alright.... Thanks
---
In some situations I feel like she is. But a lot of the time people do just ban echo and Mira.
---
Damn, and just two days into the new season.
---
FloStreams. I was p2 last season. Haven’t placed yet but I’ll prolly place in mid gold when I do. I had an awful batch of placement matches
---
Restart your application it should fix it.
---
And shields aswell. Not too sure on the claymore situation though.
---
Unless they were removed in the last 5 hours then no.
---
WHY IS THERE 4 DAMN BLITZS???!!
---
Sadly I have few people to play this game with and as a level 180 in gold I would atleast like a nice kd to look at :(
---
someone DDOS the game causing everyone to lag except him. I remember this was common in gta online
---
still he has the power to gather all of this and hes just a guy sitting at home , UBI in the meanwhile all corporate and shit TTS servers and all and they manage to release a worse version of what was running in the TTS.
---
Finka: bLyät nOw tHis sUCks
---
Well now I’m jealous of a wall/the floor
---
That looks amazing! Well done man. I would love one of these irl
---
How does this garbage get featured...
---
no, the frost died, I was right behind them
---
Are you on console?  
---
I play both but recently only played new season on PC where no one has banned Nokk and Jackal is banned far more than Blitz.
---
On PC right now it is more like "Jackal, Hard breacher (thermite/Mav/Hibanna)" then for defence: "Echo, Cav"
---
It's a temporary work around. I've only gotten one of the APs I lost.
---
I personally don't agree with you. I have my most hours played on valk, and once you get used to the idea that you need headshots and shouldn't be talking head up fights, then it's really not an underpowered gun in respect to her kit. She's an ambush specialist, not a duelist like Jager or bandit. Just like this clip; get the intel, wait for your moment, hit and run. And if you die, clever cams can win your team the round.
---
Monty hanged himself
---
 N I C E 5 F P S
---
no they can’t lol
---
But you might get a good KD to make yourself feel good about how ‘good’ you are at the game yet if such a far off stat to judge people by that in the end, you think was it worth it, considering it reveals very little about how good someone is at the game. 
---
No point of padding out a nearly pointless stat.
---
Because i said so
---
Idk
---
I mean nice clip but your aim is potato as
---
Thx u
---
I feel personally attacked right now
---
Very clean, very nice.
---
Thanks i like yours
---
I dunno how many times this has been suggested, but I'm getting sick of it. Let it go people
---
Literally playable
---
Why aren’t you ADSed
---
Idk if i would pay 9 g’s for that tho
---
If Cav isnt banned aggressive , if she the then defense. When im attacking I will slowly push, get picks n stuff
---
Some teams are okay with dealing with a gold rank level echo, Run a IQ andor a tachter. A good cav on the other hand can turn the one solo random on your team into a loss round.
---
Me: \*watches angle for over a minute with no one coming\*  
---
Me: \*looks away for 1 second\*  
---
Entire Attacking Team: "we're about to end this mans whole career"
---
I miss the old siege
---
Whoops😂
---
Nah barely been able to echo literally had him gone 4 games in a row
---
when you make a beacon in minecraft for the first time
---
This is a problem in any ranked game. Don't know how you expect them to counter it aside from banning the players responsible. If a system was in place that let you keep your rank after losing like this, it'd be highly exploitable
---
I got merked trying to peek
---
 5 frames ow
---
Well, atleast they didnt take out claymores
---
hey ubi, you wanna reimburse us for content we paid for that you have not let us use for close to a month now? BTW yes i know you can earn her for free this clearly only applies to people who paid for the pass.
---
Ahhh the old days man, the 3 hour grenade throw animation, and the 3rd person cover..... good times
---
Your eyes aren’t on your ear
---
God damn it I like Clash she’s fun to guard windows with especially when there is a Monty on the other side and you two have a little moment. It’s heart warming,
---
Not really, all of those are capable of using their gadgets in some way, even if it’s not super effective. This attacker would literally be incapable of using its gadget if it didn’t have a way to open non-reinforced hatches.

What am i looking at that is insane?
---
Call an exorcist
---
I'm not asking for for a system, but a least when we report toxic Players in PS4, it should be taken into consideration, this Dose not happen
---
i still remember when i swapped to pc from console (after not playing for about 6 months) and aceing the first game.
---
**OUTSTANDING MOVE**
---
I mean you can check eBay or amazon for the ones that come with a code but they’ll more than likely be overpriced.
---
Just restart the game.
---
After some paint, yokai is ready!
---
This is the worst list I have ever seen
---
Yes quite it is whoever did it deserves apat on the back
---
Na man, it’s to wipe all over your enemies
---
And he reloaded after. Humiliation
---
My kills in ranked as a gold 4 lmao
---
Alright I’ll try that thank you
---
I would also like to see it
---
For research purposes obviously
---
Awwww damn. Those were the scary days when the bots were all the same and difficulty just meant show many terrorists there were 😂
---
did blitz get buffed?
---
Lmao not surprised, he ended up being in the top 10 in Elo and he’s complete trash. Uses MnK too
---
Clever girl
---
They did it in tiers.  You start at a set MMR based upon last seasons rank.
---
Really want to know why they banned shield and claymores too, i didnt see the bug with tem after the new season
---
Isn’t Tachanka from Uzbekistan or something?
---
It'd be pretty cool if they had different, unlockable victory poses like Overwatch. But meh.. I wouldn't prioritize it over anything else
---
This one was on Amazon. I'll check ebay but you're probably right. Jäger is my #1 defense main so I was hoping. Currently for series 2 there's Twitch, Ela, Vigil, Bandit, and Caviera chibis. plus if you buy all of them the first 400 will get gold cav.
---
Rip chanka
---
Best rank? Average rank? Or final rank?
---
He got mad because I shot marcello
---
Is this a joke? Can we play the full game for once?
---
This better be corrected faster this time, I can believe 1 month wasn't enough to correct such issues.
---
People fear Cav. Especially on console where we are all shit and not thorough with droning if we can even be bothered to drone in the first place.
---
If u play nearby teammates she can be really strong
---
blitz as defender
---
What a blunder of a season in terms of bugs. You’d think they would actually test how good the failsafes were before Implementing them. Maybe it’s time to bring TTS to console so more people can report gamebreaking bugs.
---
That’s what I was thinking
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Hahaha the best is when you’re AI teammates level their ass
---
Cursed image
---
Because barbed wire is way more important.
---
Only the bigger, $20 figures have codes
---
but where is it? :(
---
Now that's messed up.
---
If I pay for something (which I did for Clash, I didn’t grind for renown) and it becomes unusable due to someone else’s incompetence, I’m absolutely entitled to compensation.
---
Aah that’s hot
---
hes good at all levels what are you on about
---
Looks fab!
---
Just this map back in rotation and be able to do customs on it

Tell me your youtube channel name now.

---
Ho that's pro level thinking there
---
looks like clash/warden to me
---
Yes it is
---
I've not once seen them get banned, I've seen mostly Monty, fuze, clash, and some other defender. It's always a random. I do agree that banning them is a dumb idea though.
---
Ok
---
Thank you oh so very much☺️
---
You got yourself a great pc,
---
Let's say I had an i5-9400 and gtx 1660 ti. Should that be any good?
---
I don't want to track where the DDOS is coming from.. I want to track the accounts on their servers... Maybe I don't understand it right....so you want to say that they cannot go on my account now and see that I played I don't know how many games and see that the server crashed or whatever happened to it like multiple times a day?

I'd like to play Tachanka to his full effectiveness again. Why can't people leave well enough alone and stop trying to cheat?
---
Yeah that would be amazing. It's a surprisingly easy to run game
---
I think I have played about 12 rank matches since the season started and Blitz has been banned in every single one. If you were a Blitz main this update has basically removed him from ranked.
---
Honestly my dude you should have made it in two pieces so you could buy a small drone and place it inside
---
5/5 cause i love the mp5 and it’s constant reliability has saved me many times
---
Lol really? It looks demanding.
---
Damn thats a nice price for a 1060
---
I was a couple seasons ago, I'm butthurt by that a bit too honestly

Gotta love people

I hate this guy, instead of being a normal content creator he needs to be trashy posting this type of bugs so he can get views and money from it.

The best part is that he uses the typical (don't use this, report it to ubi) so he can gain forgiveness from the 12 year old that are willing to use this glitches.

Thry didn’t “Finka” her

Dang, I wish i saw this earlier. Literally in one ranked game we started off being able to use shields and then on round 3 my sheild was gone and i got FUCKED because of it
---
TIL Ela has a green laser
---
Yes, it is the P10-C

You think you know tbagging? Fool. I was born into it. MOLDED BY IT.
---
How good is the shotgun?  I’ve only used the FMG on her so far.
---
I’ve played against nokk and she is quite annoying so we typically ban her if we don’t ban anyone else but never warden
---
Shes a waste of an op pick imo. Id rather have another op in her spot
---
The loss of barbed wire would be...really bad for def.
---
We all potato no need to apologize
---
Huh that’s new
---
I bought the ultimate edition at 50% off and I’m working on buying the other operators with renown.
---
So I have plenty to choose from.
---
Was that 5 shots, 4 kills?
---
Same!  I use it with the all white skin to complete the bathroom theme
---
It has a place in the game, somewhere. Just not where whiners like myself are forced to play it.
---
Really good up close. I tend to use it when I sneak up on people or need to make a peek hole. It 2-3 taps ops depending on armor and how much the spread is
---
Do all the situations and complete each challenge for each one. They give you tons of renown.
---
What’d you end up getting ranked my guy?
---
Yeah it's a 5 year old game but it's still prevalent and popular in 2019. They're having limitations with their current engine so why not scrap it and use snowdrop like the division's 1 &amp; 2. Wouldn't be the first time a game company's updated an engine but ezpz other sarcastic bullshit here 🙄
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Yeah ubi does a pretty good job at optimisation. Probably because graphics aren't too intense and all of the maps are super small compared to ubis massive open world games.
---
2/2 is the best way.  Make the winning team at least play the map both ways.
---
Cav bad nokk good reeee
---
Cav nokk good
---
i had an aneurysm trying to read the gadget description
---
Taking her out shows ubisoft is just a bunch of old crackers who hate diversity. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing this game.
---
No bos.g. I'm disappointed.
---
That's good to know. Hopefully I can get 70+ frames with these specs.
---
nowhere. won't happen
---
Props to you! I mainly just play ranked.
---
Okay but it’s casual
---
If anything you would prefer balanced maps were attackers and defenders have equal chances. Playing very attacker sided maps like chalet and skyscraper and the opposite for fortress probably makes it worse for a soloQ. I've been soloQing lots for the past 2 years and the unbalanced maps really ruin the experience for me.
---
Unlock new ass...interesting..
---
Mute, pose.
---
I wonder if the game can detect if the bullets, pellets, or melee originated from Cav.
---
If not, you could just have the test be anytime there is a Cav
---
You forgot Caviera and Lion
---
Never talk to me or my son ever again
---
Does it say *”TACHANKA”* in rushin or sumthin?
---
The clip was cool but the title makes me downvote
---
No
---
Just play a lot of casual, and be patient with the game, there's a lot of things you won't understand and figure out until later on. Also, be courteous to your teammates and if they're knifing and/or shooting around you, stop what you're doing, it's probably dumb.
---
Please do not take advice from Get_Flanked, instead, watch VarsityGaming (Siege School) and check out KingGeorge on Twitch, he's a former pro player who just streams basically every single day.
---
Lightbulbs powered by the thrusts of a long-dead German man who enjoys flashing people.
---
Ok u do u bud
---
I get that, but I find (gsg9) recruit to be on the side of a flanker like cav or nøkk, and I feel like most teams are pretty set on 4 ops with primary gadgets, I think it’s really useful to run double secondaries like smoke and grenades. But everyone has different strategies
---
&gt; Why don’t they just upgrade it or use a new engine especially with new consoles on the horizon?
---
It's... not that simple. You're asking them to make Siege 2 here. 
---
&gt; I know it’s not that easy but i mean they’ve had years to do it
---
I'm sorry but do you want years of content, or do you want years of working on Siege 2?
---
Hurr poleese is fascist because Buzzfeed said so
---
*plays pornhub drum intro

My fav is one i found, mozzie rezd me and he told tachanka “ dont worry, you’re still a legend”

Yes ubi devs please
---
Fun Fact of the Day: If you read the rules closely it says no memes or photoshopped image macros.

Nice Rules.

OMG SO ITS U THAT KEEPS PLACING F’d UP MIRAS IN MY GAME

just like bart
---
Restart game
---
Rainbow Six Siege is secretly in early access confirmed.
---
Its a thermite headgear called ORBIT i heard
---
He does not know Dee way
---
It’d be cool if it was a map for custom games and for a warmup type of thing. Start the map up and the game will randomly generate either terrorists in random areas or just plain old target dummies
---
"its the pillow that humps back"
---
Yeah I've been playing since the beginning of Wind Bastion and I've clocked many many hours, I think I'm like level 110 and I get pissed playing this game all the damn time
---
tachanka (Russian: тача́нка) 
---
Translation: Tachanka Op health plumber co
---
I think it’s a big.  My 1660 Ti shoes over 1000 FPS on lobby screens.
---
One glitch is one thing, but abusing like cmon! This game can be pesky as is, don’t ruin it for us
---
4 people with primary gadgets might work, but 5 is always better. You will rarely need the second secondary gadget anyway and you would be better of with strong utility in most cases. A capitao or maverick or buck is always gonna be much better than a recruit with 2 smokes and one grenade.
---
They have all black for frost! I specifically dished out to buy it cause she sticks out like a sore seal

Some random redditor: *gives genuinely informative information for non-American readers*
---
This guy:
---
I'm not a big fan, idk why they made diamond purple and plat blue, at least the old colors were accurate as to what they really were. If they want to be inaccurate, they should have made gold plat, gold silver, silver bronze, and bronze copper.
---
I'm curious, what does it say? Can someone that speaks korean tell me?
---
Why do you care tho
---
I just dont wanna lose Tachanka's deployable shield :c
---
my fav is the "Ubi Rocks!" charm 
---
for sarcasm ofc
---
Best just not not say anything you wasted your time
---
That’s the response I expected. I am a plat player and we use to win close games. Now it’s a dice roll. Either we clap people on attack, or we get clapped cuz we are on defense.
---
She isn't actually Russian, Slavic, but not Russian
---
Exactly, an easy fix would be making exploiting a ban-able offense
---
Add some eyebrows so it looks better
---
DAMN!!! now thats hot
---
Im also plat. And defense is still way easier.
---
MmK confirmed
---
Don’t use Newcomer. All you will find are smurf accounts (low level accounts with really good players on them) you are will get killed instantly by a spawnpeek etc. use normal casual
---
stfu
---
What was the other black ice?
---
That’s up to preference. We are an attack heavy team.
---
Like warn em the first time then ban if they resume

Yep yep, maybe even a 3 strike system, and its caused by sending killcam footage or some server detection to ensure players arent using the shield when they shouldnt be able to ( like having a gun out at the same time as their shield)

Thanks for all the upvotes, this is my first post as a redditor and can't believe it made to hot on r/rainbow6. Also, I just had to abandon a 3-1 ranked match because my mom made me( I'm Asian so there is no escape). Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
it was a good clip, just 3mins a tad too long :)
---
Is she a good roamer? Yes
---
Does she put the team at a disadvantage? It depends on what gadgets you are giving up for her roaming and mines.
---
You should use a brown or yellow skin lol

That is genius

Maybe go play ranked if you want to take it seriously?
---
And just like that, ive made up my mind. Time to rewatch Justified
---
Thank you for understanding
---
It all depends on your play style, she is an excellent roamer as well as a 3 speed, and position her Concussion mines can give a decent advantage in a fire fight or in the prep phase. Just practice her guns and coordinate strategies,if not solo que and practice being a team player alone. shes not bad
---
Practice makes perfect m8
---
lol didn't even notice that
---
I'm retarded

He locked onto his head and it was too obvious. Yes ive played before, since velvet shell and im a plat 2 average

I think you play her like cav but more aggressive

Them console turns tho

Your analogy is crap. Yes there are far more “dangerous” jobs, more even deadly jobs. The difference is roofers get seriously hurt or killed in an ACCIDENT, when they fall, not by someone intent on causing them harm. Imagine doing your job and always wondering if the car you are stopping or person you are contacting is about to attack you or try to kill you. There’s a much higher risk to your mental health when you must remain hyper vigilant just to survive. Also roofers aren’t subjected to violence day in and day out. Going to calls for service where people have been abused or assaulted. Seeing the worst of society constantly. Your baseline for what is acceptable as “normal” is far more skewed than the general public. When you’ve gone to enough DV calls that you start to think that’s just normal in a relationship. Because let’s be honest, nobody called the cops because they had a normal relationship, no the cops get to see only the fucked up ones and over time, that becomes normal.

Using AAVE to signify a lack of intelligence makes it pretty clear that you’re not arguing in good faith. Maybe be a little more subtle with the racism next time

Hopefully it seems like they need it I mean they have been giving us hints like making us redownload the game in burnt horizon to get the reorganized file system that is lighter and now just reworking maps instead of making new ones

“aight yall, im bouta head out”
---
No I didn't think to record it until reading this sorry..
---
Yep totally worked, thanks reddit
---
that may be the most disgusting play ive ever seen in any game ever
---
That’s funny you say that because I’m ass with Cav but good with Vigil.
---
I do both, but if I enjoy casual sometimes, why can't I get balanced matches? What about people that only play casual? Do they not deserve balance because they're not "taking it seriously?"
---
I freaking love this! Not only funny, but quick meme thinking on your part
---
I am the most casual player I know please send help
---
That completely depends on what your rank was last season.
---
If your a diamond last season, you basically start off at high gold. If you were copper or bronze, thats going to take a bit of work.
---
The mmr doesnt reset back to 2500 anymore, it resets to a middle value between 2500 and your previous rank.
---
id rock that honestly
---
R6tab says you have 4 ranked matches played.
---
Just play like you do with vigil. Don't get mad but to me their the same operator with different variations

Hello noot_snackbeard, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c0g9kv/my_2nd_time_uploading_my_art_of_bandit_as_king/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Lots of open areas would actually make a great addition, no longer giving huge advantages for CQB which would have many attacker’s use shields and a only roamers 
---
All you need to do is abandon obj
---
Casual is just for fun people only care about kills not winning
---
Why was this comment downvoted? I'm confused

This season? Didn’t it reset yesterday?

No ubi devs No

I think this game is much more than CoD. The devs (from what I’ve seen since year 1) care about the game and the community involved with it. They’re very transparent and honest with the community and it seems that they take feedback onboard when it’s rightly placed.
---
You have to look past the company name and look at the actual team working on the game, watch some of their invitationals and panels. I haven’t played in a while now just because I don’t find the time atm, but I still see posts from here, YT, and such and you can see they’re trying to keep this game moving forward.
---
See, the TB in my name stands for Thick Boys, so rook is my go-to but echo’s my 2nd pick

funny thing is that its still in the game but only playable as situations, reworking the map didnt reduce the game wheight because of the DATA LIMITS
---
It was either black ice, dust line or red crow. I cant remember what one but I was plat 3 (which at the time was the highest plat you could be)
---
I've played 3 entire seasons in plat , 2 seasons in high gold and I'm telling you usually people who are plat act and play like legitimate Plats .
---
Those who got boosted lost their ranks immediately , some people obviously got lucky but not for long , at the end of the day NONE of them are noobs , yes skills differ and I can easily tell who's good and who's not but rarely do I see deadass noobs in high gold and plat .
---
Hey man I have R6 both on PC and PS4. On PS4 I usually rank in Gold 4, and I play since last year. Am lvl 100+. So I think I am good. On PC I also am kind of good, I just struggle with some the buttons. Am lvl 18. So I think I’d rank in High Silver/Low gold.

Untrue. The figure you are stating is “violence” by *either* partner and it includes things like yelling. Not only that but the studies are nearly 30 years old at this point and violent crime has dramatically reduced in that same time period. Stating 40% of police officers are domestic abusers is untrue and I would encourage you to do some research and find a more recent figure.
---
Why dont you do it then?
---
Oh, I thought this was a post about the actual match making via searching for a game.
---
Don’t solo queue if you want to depend on your team via call outs, etc. invite players you meet online that have mics and can make decent call outs. I can find a five stack of mics after only 2-3 games of casual. People will be more likely to party up and use mics if other multiple people are. Hoped this helped

Only gold 2. Me and my squad arent too use to playing bomb. Still learning it. They also banned clash as we were finishing our last 2 games (I'm a clash main on Bomb. I also mean ubisoft's were the ones who banned her

Jusy imagining 2 attacking blitzes and 2 defending blitzes against each other is scary.

I want unrealistic. Realistic blows. Do some force on force,room clearing and all around teamwork required training and you will see just how annoying being realistic would be. It would be fine for all but 2 hours max.
---
I say continue with the exploding fidget spinners.
---
I couldn't tell you
---
And you can shoot them with there shield up
---
Balanced, as all things should be.
---
Did first 3 of my placements yesterday.
---
First, a guys started shout casting our last in a 1 v 1 which sounded like shit callouts because he didnt use any operators names. After we lost the round because it was confusing to hear "he searches CCTV" when you are in a Hibana Vs. Bandit. The guy proceeds to TK Hibana round 2 round 3 the Reverse friendly fire does its job. 4 v 5 for 2 rounds is bad enough we manage to drag it into overtime. Still lose because the guy decides to suicide by cop.
---
Other 2 games were 9 round super close games but randoms Vs. Premades. Guess I'm leaving that mess a bit longer.
---
doesn’t really fit to that sub

Literally fucked him back to life .

But they're not, its darker.

Might want to recheck your monitor brightness.

What i shame them for ? Being toxic ?

Please, elaborate

Simply said it was a better cod. And to be more specific, I meant strictly search and destroy.

OK.

Yea it sucks after playing this game for 4

years

Let’s swap BlackBeard and Pulse right away
---
Would you share the stl file?
---
Probably no, because people will get mad if a Doc dies like 5km away from his teammates without healing any of them.
---
Did he marry Tachanka? I would
---
I've seen someone else won loss record where abandons don't affect it.
---
he is not fine if hes used in a coordinated team, you will get pinched from 2 different ways from 3 people and unless the enemies are shit at aiming, youre dead

One of the few good looking skins. Most are trash. A skin that puts a kangaroo on your gun, a pineapple!?

Wtf is your brightness😤

The issue I have with the Intel gathering is that it is too easy. At the press of a button both lion and dokk can know exactly where you are. Dokk is a little bit longer but it's still extremely low risk. With the Intel gatherers on defense, you need to actually be tactical and use strategy to gain the Intel. You need to hope they run into your traps. But I will also admit they they have too much Intel gathering as well. Lesion is so obviously strong that he was constantly getting banned when I did the new ranked beta thing. They could definitely tone it down on that sort of thing. This also leads to another facet of what I was saying, so many ops now or basically only there to gain intel. They may have side effects of the ability but the main purpose is Intel. 
---
Yes they both can be good. But if you ask any siege player who the worst defenders are, I'd say a good portion would say these two. Castle is too easily dealt with by ash, zofia, maverick, and literally anyone with a breach charge and for tachanka, even the devs say that being stationary is bad.
---
The issue is people expecting things even if they didnt purchase the season pass. People are too greedy and they want everything right away. They have no patience, that's why they'll never do more op healths. And I understand that, but to say it isnt needed, I believe would be wrong. I mean they are literally preventing people from playing clash for the second time because of an exploit glitch.
---
good for you!
---
Yoo carry me

ash/vigil

When your playing Cav and the entire enemy team is hunting you down.
---
I feel you bro 😔😔😔😔
---
I am brand new to this game. Can someone explain what I am watching?
---
How tho cuz the way I knew how to do it is to pick up barbed wire which you can’t do for other people??
---
Yeah I'm aware of that, but I'm still hesitate whether change to that uniform or not as black is my favourite color and it's good to hiding in dark corner.
---
Yes I say no and all my botty friends say yes so I’m proving a point
---
infinity shields
---
I meant ops with no gadgets but just legendary guns
---
I have an idea   
---
For Clash remove her Barbed wire for something else because she needs to Barbed wire to do the glitch, This will stop people from performing the glitch with her as she will no longer have the Barbed wire to do it   
---
For the IQ glitch replace her Claymores for something else as IQ needs to have the Claymores to perform the invisible glitch   
---
Don't know what to do about the Deployable shields though
---
Gotta feel awful to have worked so hard on the programming for siege and have these massive game breaking exploits. Would be interesting to see how these work in the code
---
It's easier ok. Stop bullying me lol
---
That was tense. Awesome!
---
now he wants to fuck you
---
Plus, most of Ubisoft's big titles run on versions of this engine. Their developers know it well, and it works well and is capable of great visuals. Siege is just so complex that it really needed to be developed from the ground up on a bespoke engine to avoid all the tasty spaghetti. And of course, you don't spend the time  and money to develop a new AAA engine for a new Rainbow Six game. Well, now you might, but certainly not in 2015.
---
But why?
---
Thats for a Clash main not you lol
---
Just waiting for the next "gaming journalist" to write an article saying Ubisoft is siding with Police in the Blacks Lives Matter debate. /s
---
But just incase y'all havent been paying attention, journalists in the industry have been targeting Ubisoft for not being political enough in their games like The Division 2 and the not yet released Ghost Recon Breakpoint. And a simple weapon skin in a game with special operations, swat etc... is exactly the kind of thing they look for to get outrage clicks from.

WELL AT LEAST THEY’RE REMOVING HER FROM THE GAME TILL THEN RIGHT? SERIOUSLY INDEED

yes, ash/vigil
---
Is it me or does he have the smol nec disease?
---
Well she isn't  really Russian. She is from Ukraine I think.
---
Yeah pretty much
---
I think people are saying Clash/Warden, though I would just bet that it's for the FBI and S.S. Ops.
---
Except theres no renown or xp gain
---
I was awarded 2 Alpha packs yesterday that disappeared before I could open them. I closed the game down and reopened and they reappeared. Have you tried that?

Hello zLophius, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c0heme/bug_is_buck/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Lmao people have got free time to make these edits😂
---
This end of round cam is hilarious.
---
He sent me a screenshot
---
As a religious COD player for 8 years I can 100% agree with you from the perspective that it’s perhaps like search and destroy. 
---
My only thing is the tactical behind this and COD aid so vastly different that my comparison went out the window once I started playing. 
---
Siege is so much more tactics than gun skill, where in COD, most of it was gun skill then necessarily tactics. In Siege it’s nearly impossible to do anything without good communication, whereas COD I could hop in any casual search and destroy and we would usually be fine. 
---
So yes I agree looking at the barebones the comparison is there. But once you get into it, I do not think it’s a fair comparison necessarily to call it a better COD.
---
Thatcher can't stop a Bandit trick. That's the whole point, Bandit tricking developed as a counter to Thatcher.
---
Think about loads of pillars or seating areas to conceal defenders, while stackers need to drone ahead to clear the area. There could also be a skylight to watch the open terminal area.

Yeah I looked it up

because theyre bootlickers lmao

well he didnt get banned for killing a diamond, he got banned for using cheats bud

there is talk by no confirmation

Yep. Probably a teenager, didn’t sound like what a grown woman would sound like.
---
Ok, thought it would be something like that
---
“Spetsnaz” is a collective label for special forces in russophone countries; just like “special forces” in english doesn’t mean any one group, neither does Spetsnaz.
---
As such, different Spetsnaz groups have radically different missions - military Spetsnaz in Russia are largely under the control of the GRU (military intelligence) whereas counterterrorist Spetsnaz like the operators we have in game are under the control of the FSB. They are *not* interchangeable because the skills, training, tactics, and equipment possessed by a counterterrorist force do not always lend themselves to large-scale warfighting, and vice versa.
---
3/4
---
Give a temporary ban to the player as well.
---
Dont ment to offen you, but true that it was phrased a little bit harshly. I just wanted to bring over the message that UBI simply will not care. There are some companies who have a budget for wellfare things or social community things. Other then that your only option would be to get more players to play it no matter the ping until your number is significant enough for UBI to react to keep this playerbase in your area. 
---
Again man, sorry for the harsh wording. To move would be the easiest option, and yes it can be done. Again, I dont mean to offend you in any way. 
---
Keep playing and IQ is thicc
---
Not sure how i feel about the attacker
---
Ey, nobody cares about shitty charms
---
Yea. Tbh im good enough to kill 2-3 enemies per round on average. Granted sometimes i fail and kill nobody. But i never go in expecting my team mates to stay, mainly because i play with a 4 stack and the one guy sometimes leaves for little to no reason.  Sometimes we teamkill him. (Yes toxic wah boohoo. get friends.)  but i never expect them to stay. Also we only play ranked when my other good friend and i are on fire enough to 2v5.
---
I approve the flair, and the username now that I'm looking at it.
---
Regarding the second part,my friend just played his placements yesterday but lost 250 elo today because of the roll back even though he didn't play with a hacker on his team.He was in Plat 3 and got dropped to Gold 2.
---
So that means he must have won against a hacker but got the elo gain cancelled right?
---
Very good bot
---
Eh? No? It's like telling movie critics to direct their own movie before having the right to, well, *criticize* movies. Or telling food critics to cook a better dish to review a cook? Being able to complaint about faulty products is like the most basic right of a consumer since forever.

Literally this. These challenges only used to say "Win x rounds as the Spetsnaz", they just changed from writing as the Spetsnaz to type out the actual operators' name from that unit some time ago.
---
depends on map, but I say yes... I AM THE DOCTOR TRUST ME !!!
---
Also not that
---
That person was just an idiot.
---
But I have to admit, the TK was unnecessary.
---
We ban Jackal on few of the maps where good roaming is essential to slow down the attack (church/armory) on Club or pretty much entire Theme Park. Other than that he's absolutely mediocre. I've never seen him banned by the enemy team. Our bans are usually Lesion on smaller maps and Caveira on roamers' maps. Attack is usually Thermite or - if we play without our designated shield - Montagne.
---
It's mind-blowing to me that people ban Blitz almost every other game while Monty - who's way more effective - is never banned.
---
Btw. Pick and ban is a test of how good will be the enemy team. If they ban Blitz and Clash you just know you're winning before even the first round started. If they ban Echo and Thatcher you know they know what they're doing.
---
Alibi has the wrong gun too

This isn't criticism this is hate , our guy here is a passenger on this "hate train" , people argue on why some bugs haven't been fixed yet , regardless if Ubisoft aren't working on it right away , bug fixing can be very complicated or easy and simple , if bugs are reoccurring its 100% complicated , these people will go on and talk and complain in a hateful way about Ubisoft yet they do not understand what is actually going on in the process .
---
What you've wrote is about gatekeeping against legitimate criticism , what I'm doing here is blocking straight hate .
---
Oh look the attacker who can go up hatches leak is here again. The amount of times I’ve seen that thing get “leaked” is ridiculous. I literally saw posts for this Y3S4, Y4S1 and H4S2, this makes me very skeptical because I literally see it every season. Personally it seems unrealistic they can add this to the game because it sounds like quite a complex gadget for their spaghetti engine. 
---
However if you have more evidence that could indicate this is an actual operator I am all ears, but I’ve literally see it 3 seasons running.
---
Well that would work on ops that can capitalise on hiding as a strat, like Cav and Vigil.
---
No probs
---
Yep same for me
---
Fair enough, it is quite humorous to annou the absolute fuck out of people by zapping them and watching their despair as they struggle to approach you
---
Fucking thank you. Everyone shit talks New Hereford, but conveniently forget how bad Old Hereford was for actually playing on and winning. New Hereford isn't even bad, like, at all.

Capital F...

I feel like Everytime I play Im that thermite

YES :D My gameplay improved by 10000% with this skin!!!!!1!1!!1!1

It is rly nice on all weapons :D

Lesion elite will came at the 18th of June

I get DDOS basically every 3rd game... That's how high diamond on console looks like... DDOSing, MnK, a Boosters :D... Freaking ridiculous
---
yeah I've been getting some weird rubber banding since the update, before than I haven't had issues for a long time. still annoying when it happens tho
---
Its very hard for maps that favor one side. I've had 1-3 comebacks and 3-1 chokes because of this.
---
I'm making a statement not a question. It was a reply to the comment that says it was removed for balance which is a lie
---
This will never happen, In competitive you sometimes catch a glimpse of the enemy ops weapons. You would have to have the whole seige community relearn how the gun looks like and if it's actually that gun or not... cool idea, but not a good execution
---
I used her exclusively with the shotty before (fantastic shotty btw), but her smg works better than I thought. Its not a long range weapon. Ita need even medium, it is very close range, but damn is it good when you have the right range. Nothing outside shotguns can come close to competing.
---
You are reffering to year 1. I can confirm. I don't have any year 2 except G. E. O and they are all the same price

Yeah no. But keep it up, kid, if you write like that, soon noone will interact with you anymore. As I will also now stop. And to show me that you really don't **demand** interaction → feel free to not answer on this post.

Yesterday, I came across a team in ranked where our entire team was stuck in spawn, while the defenders were waiting inside. With 45 seconds left, a teammate and I who didn’t team kill tried to push, but I ended up getting killed by a glitched bandit who teleports around a corner holding a car battery...
---
I never understood why dropshotting was so hated, if someone did it and you weren’t ready, you got outplayed.
---
In a game like Siege, there should be close to zero chances for someone to get a dropshot off anyway.
---
Strangely enough, I never see people complain about fast peeking a doorway, or, Mira tricking.
---
If dropshotting needed nerfed, then simply remove instant prone, and add a hold to prone like what console has, that way it’s slower but can still be used properly.
---
Police are an insurance policy. A LOT of shit doesnt happen just because they are around deterring crime. CT units are great but they arent on standby 24-7 and have a very slow response time. Unless you’re in a big city like LA or NYC. As oppose to a standard patrol officer who is literally out looking for crime. 
---
Source: am police.
---
No I won't demand anything, but I do like to end conversations, so glhf.
---
Doesn't that mean they would have to remake the entire game in a new engine?
---
In casual I don’t sweat but yeah, in ranked I will have a squad
---
Come on, at least some sauce
---
I will, and by grip I mean that most other universal skins apply a black grip to Mozzies commando, while Elephant and Fire still have the default "yellow paint" grip.
---
Happened to me on Kafe the other day in one of my placements. Truly dumb
---
That is the worst, it is so hard to claw your way back up the food chain after placement matches.
---
If you like it, get it.
---
If you don't, don't.
---
Simple stuff.
---
I would trade that for this monstrosity
---
I actually do have to agree that 3F is horrible to attack on yeah, especially if your team is uncoordinated. Tho' I haven't seen many runouts on the 2F/3F balconies, but I also usually watch those things like a hawk anyways. The hatches... I do have to agree with that too, there's a lot of them. Definitely not perfect, but it's a lot more balanced than Old Hereford.
---
I wouldn’t mind if they kinda forgot to put her back in the game
---
Remove wire from an operator who makes genuine use of it (kaid)
---
won't remove it from an op who doesn't really need it.
---
Will happily remove claymores from the game for weeks.
---
But won't remove wire when it's used to cause an exploit on an op and instead remove the op.
---
no reason? when you are 0-3 you an go easy 3-3 after the change, if the map is really that defender/attacker sided?
---
Had the time - but was only casual warmup before ranked so needn’t have dragged it out any longer!
---
The understaffing issue has been mentioned a few times in this thread.
---
Do you have any link to info? I was not aware of this and would like to read up.
---
ok what the fuck, i didn't even read the ops and only played finka yesterday because she's Russian as well, and the entire time I thought Uplay is bugged or something.
---
imma go jump off the cliff now
---
Don't accuse someone of cheating just because they outplay you
---
happy cake day my lord

Sorry to go against you on that... I've spoken to about 150 or so siege Devs personally and welcome to the computer world. Murphy's law is king there... Sometimes, server code is perfect, engine code is good, cosmetics code good, everything is good separately, they internally test it, it works but when deployed on an infrastructure that support 40+ millions 0layers,well it doesn't work anymore as intended... You talk like it was a simplistic game like CS or cod but sorry to tell you, that game is way more complex than it may seem at first... You need to stop showing ignorance on that and it's ok to be fed up due to the bugs I am but I know what to do to help. Bug report reproduce what you did, provide it to support, be helpful and stop crying like they owe it to you. There's a lot of people trying their best to make this game work and the only faces you know about the Devs are the one showed on the streams or title clips at events... I ain't saying I have advance knowledge of programming and server stuff but I do know how those works, got the basics down. Inform yourself before saying that kind of thing. It's normal ubi does oopsies with siege, it's their first big competitive shooter title that has success and blows up. So they need to build, develop an infrastructure without having experience in this field while still delivering free content on 3 different platforms. Oh and which makes me think, they need to fix every single issue 3 times too, once per platform which adds complexity to the whole thing. They might even have to convert the game for the next gen of console too since Sony is about to release the ps5 in the next 2-3 years (siege still has about 5 to 7 years of life left at minimum as per the information released at the last invitational). I might not be writing in the best manners cause post like yours don't bring anything and pisses me off so much since it's free hate speech basically imo. Just chill and appreciate the art piece you are able to enjoy even tho it ain't perfect
---
When was the last ela nerf, feels like it was like ages ago
---
While this is bad trigger discipline, in general if a USSS agent on protection detail draws his or her weapon, they’re GOING to shoot. They’re progression from holstered to ready to shoot to shooting is faster than anyone else (in terms of their habits, not that they’re all a bunch of quick draw McGraws).
---
Mute got deleted for countering everything
---
Stop reminding me that Ela doesn't have impacts anymore T^T Some wounds just never heal
---
Nice pizzabox! But where's Yokai?
---
Oh wait...
---
Old and shitty screenshot
---
That's happened to me twice now
---
Toggled it off, in my settings
---
It's a rainbow six and gfl hentai btw
---
Just restart
---
Did it seem like you were running very slowly? I know she’s a 2 speed but it seemed slower than a 1 speed 🤔
---
That was the origination of the symbology, you're correct
---
Mostly I follow the rule 
---
If they retreat, push them
---
If they push lure them.
---
I mean she looks like she was meant to be played very aggressively. Ever her bio shows her as a aggressive op not to mention that op selection pic. 
---
Even with capitao it takes him longer to take out the crossbow and shoot a bolt that kills her than clash to switch and shoot him in the head. Same with frag grenades they need to be cooked to kill her and if not you can just walk past them. As for multiple enemies luring them is good , if I know there will be multiple enemies pushing from a door I have a teammate put a shield there so that they cant see my legs when they knife. Usually I buy enough time for my teammate to flank or enough cover for them to throw c4 over me.
---
well
---
he's not dead yet
---
He’s excited
---
Either you are intentionally playing dumb or you didn't watch the video I linked. Either way, stop wasting my time.
---
I think terrorist hunt would be a harder warm up that this XD
---
That was in the 1990s
---
The regular population is around %10
---
As of 2016 in still 4% more likely then the average house house hold so it's %14 nice qoute of a meme though.
---
lemme guess, "aCAb, bOoTlIcKeRs, 40%"? Shut the fuck up. You'll never understand what the real world is like until you stop watching those bullshit "cop watch" videos and step out of your mother's basement. Every single one of you ACAB cop hating fucktards would be the biggest pussies if they were to ever meet a cop. You would be all "Yes sir, no sir, oh I'm very sorry sir." And all your picket line sayings would be out the fucking window so goddamn fast. 
---
Grow the fuck up you cunt. At least you dont have to put on a vest every morning, hope this isn't the last time you'll get to kiss your wife/husband, and pray to whatever God you believe in that some prick doesnt feel like shooting a "pig" today.
---
Only on thunt feller.
---
What about dropshots coming back?
---
This would mean removing bearded wire from ALL operators. Considering how unimportant clash is, they are doing better with just removing her. You can’t remove a shared gadget / weapon from only a single OP.
---
Most people who are anarchists (who usually say ACAB) don't want a police state.. Its about the opposite of what we want.
---
Okay. Thanks.
---
You right ima repost this
---
I'm not against you, I totally support your opinion but changing or Adding something in a code might alterate a part of it, trust me, it's not easy as it seems. If you are able to figure out how to do this there's a bug report page of ubi where you can tell them the problem and the solution.
---
Jeez buddy can't take a joke. Boo hoo you're getting your elo back regardless when he gets banned, cheating doesn't even really matter anymore because of that.
---
Tbh you’re right though, a game this big shouldn’t take up to months to fix major bugs. Any time something happens it’s just the usual “well fix it later in the season” or some vague, huge delay. Siege feels like there’s 2 programmers and 100 skin makers
---
What’s wrong there?
---
You really think ubi will listen?
---
I thought if you time the second one right it would destroy the battery in his hands? Also you can just nade the hole still after the tatch throw
---
Statistics from the 90's aren't relevant 20 years later it's way down from what it was no?
---
I don't have a video but it is. pro league is 10 I think.
---
If only we could 😧
---
Been playing since Grimm sky
---
RIP Deployable shields 12:00 - 12:05
---
Might be same reason they dont have my PX4. Licensing.
---
Do they have an Italian specialist group in Siege???
---
The fact that you didn't read that the notification tells you how to turn it off is telling to how jaded we are to it as a feature.
---
Me too lmao. Since the first time i have seen it like a year ago.
---
This has been a thing since last season, and everyone else can hear you just fine.
---
Correction, current state of siege
---
I like this kind of skin, very 'Nerf' looking
---
Be fine if they could aim
---
I think you need to throw a dice and let that decide. Beside this, I have no clue
---
Some people have been cheating for quite a long time and don't get banned. This guy in particular was bragging about how he has been doing this since Para Bellum. I report these players sure, but a lot of times, nothing ever happens.
---
I hate this
---
Might have been right after the couple of patches months after Chimera, but that patch increased her recoil for a second time.
---
This is a decent misconception, due to regulations on safety, training, and rules to wait for aid. Officer fatalities have gone way down. Doesn't make the job safe. Superior training has lessened the mortality rate is all. Something every line of work could do but Don't.  And it honestly matters where you are an officer. Chicago is gonna be a little different then butt fuck nowhere Wyoming ya know
---
I've been in the valley you ain't off the that porch now
---
No way
---
Would look better without the goggles
---
It was a rushed patch and they designed her with a really strong AR to begin with, low recoil high damage and 800ish firerate.
---
No thats... not at all what it means
---
Honestly the emotes not working makes it better
---
Source has ported games to newer versions of Source, im no programmer but it seems possible.
---
I like lurking which is staying off of the objective but still close. I like it because you can surprise people who are only paying attention to the objective and the people who the roamers haven’t killed
---
it do be like that
---
No it is BAD. I’ve had people hit my welcome mats with 0 sound. The only way I knew was random moans next to me
---
it'd be cool if it worked like the normal rappel except you deployed it and climbed it way faster
---
Ahh.. then it fits nicely:
---
|Burnt Horizon MMR|MMR Change|2 \* Change|"middle"|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
|3604|\-496|\-992|2612|
---
|3162|\-275|\-550|2612|
---
|2830|\-109|\-218|2612|
---
|2565|\+24|\+48|2613|
---
|2006|\+302|\+604|2613|
---
|1707|\+453|\+906|2613|
---
So this means that while the patch said it's 2500, the "middle" is actually something like 2612.5.
---
Would be nice to get a comment from Ubisoft on this.
---
legitimately thought this was console because of the aim... wtf
---
That's not how rff works, it is if he shoot YOU not your gadgets
---
The fact that your talking bout something you don't understand a thing about.
---
Sir, the wall was 90 degrees on your left. My guess is that your purpose was to hammer some sense into Smoke's head from the start.
---
I'll see myself out.
---
Hey how do I get my main by my name?
---
Why would they choose a Greek name for a Mexican is correct that's strange, It seems like they're going off of the weaker weapons like Nokk and Warden if it's because of data limits I'm fine with it.
---
Also you get overtime much more often because if you are 0-3 on a onesided map you have to Win 5 rounds now 
---
And i realy dont like overtime
---
If police were removed today probably. But in a more equal society, both economic and social. Criminals would disappear, except for those with mental issues, and those would get the help they need. Which removes the need of a police force.
---
Hello Stgs, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c0jtpv/if_warden_got_normal_seasonal_skin_instead_of/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Oh, already home from kindergarten?
---
Niiiiiiiiice
---
The site bugged out when I tried to submit.
---
if you guys are wondering why there are no new weapons, Ubi is running out of weapons they can use legally. plus, new weapons are basically just old ones but with a different look.
---
Of course they give the attack the 2 worst weapons in their respective categories lmao
---
This 100%. People should get their accs banned for putting this out to the public instead of directly to ubi.
---
yeah i was assuming that’s what happened, i remember commenting on a youtube video and it getting submitted literally ten times
---
We need a new engine not operation health. Shit keeps getting worse and worse. I'm 22 years old, played games since I was like 5 and never seen a game with rubber banding because of client sever sync issues. Worst of all? This is a common problem that can be replicated.
---
To be fair they don’t really need new weapons every season, also as someone else already said, they are probably working really hard on other things (like Rainbow Six Quarantine) and thus wouldn’t have as many people available to work on new weapons
---
Sometimes there is no perfect solution to an imperfect problem. Just because there may be a fraction of a percent of bad cops, doesn’t mean you can make some perfect solution to find them and weed them out.
---
As a player it feels really easy to positive ID someone doing the glitch. But from a high level server side it’s probably a lot harder and they don’t want the bad press of banning false positives. Player reports are only so reliable and there’s no replay system to verify either.
---
Yeah i knew the thin red line thing, was also why i thought it was british
---
*have
---
Yeah and maybe they could use some community maps in normal games too, if they added it in.
---
sounds really cool but idk if the engine is acapable of this, its an old engine and I dont think they had this feature in mind for players so that would require a lot of work.
---
Exactly
---
That could be. Unfortunately, just like in any job, there are idiots. Usually they don’t last long either, sometimes they spike there way through though.
---
If I cant shoot the grapple hook and force the operator to fall and possibly take damage I will be sad.
---
Now that i took at a look at your post history i realise how stupid you actually are, just keep beliving what you say!
---
Same difference
---
No, but can you blame anyone for trying to improve things? That's all we can ever do.
---
Fair
---
What If we only play Deagle + Surpressor? :D 
---
You know, just playing pistol like Caveira(I know it's her gadget) and SMG for longer fights?
---
Does it even make sense?
---
There is no god here
---
Hurray! Will do! Thank you for your input~
---
Why are you shocked that a brit is unaware that this is an american phrase then?
---
Acts and looks like one, feels like one, gets the job done
---
Thx For the tip
---
:)
---
But Nokk can not be heard and I think it's the best advantage.
---
I've been outplayed because of that many times now :D
---
Best fucking teamwork I have seen since a lot of fucking time
---
Not to be rude..but the whole play looked so awkward.
---
Ahh! thank you so much!! ☺️ This means so much to me! I love your artwork, you're so talented! 😁
---
I can smell the Doritos from here
---
I’m not sure what your argument is about honestly. What exactly are you referring to when you say “civil forfeiture”?  Give an example please.
---
Line is a bit too thick for me, ubi bad
---
In her picture in the bio she has the normal six-12  too but she uses the six-12 SD
---
I know! That’s why I’m confused to why he’s doing so bad
---
Clash has an exploit where you can glitch her actual shield so that you can still aim and fire your sidearm, but to everyone else, you're holding the shield and their bullets will behave like the shield is active so she was incredibly OP
---
might be the middle of all ranked players
---
If you’re asking for someone to play siege with then I may be able to help with that
---
No because when return fire is on you only kill yourself
---
As far as the engine goes they could update it just like how rockstar games did to their engine when they started developing rdr2 but the map editor they could just copy and paste far cry5 one into siege
---
I thought she'd be meta pick because she can not be heard.
---
I got outplayed because of this many times.
---
I'm really sad, because her gun is so freakin bad.
---
At least we have surpressed deagle.
---
Do you see her in tournaments or you think there are better picks?
---
you've never played metal gear have you
---
You are gay

is Tom Clancy not a hack? Are his books anything other army brat fan fic for smoothbrains?
---
Blitz with tachanka turret instead of pistol
---
Cavs the same way, unless the mags are for her shotgun.
---
You should probably edit your post. I think it's not clear enough that you know about the new system and that your point is, that the "middle" is not 2500.
---
Wonder why it's named like that
---
Are you on PC or on mobile?
---
What? I didn't get a clear picture of what that guy was going. You should post the death replay too
---
I use the muzzle brake on her deagle because it's sounds a bit useless trying to be stealth with that gun and because on console it's hard to hit consecutive shots because of the recoil. Muzzle brake makes it still so it's really easy to use and hits hard.
---
Ima sneehhke
---
I mean, might as well nerf the sound of the EMP then.
---
Ok buddy
---
There’s a fine line though in “improving” and absolutely ruining a system, that although not perfect, does work pretty well. I’ve already seen the results in large departments. Police officers too afraid to do their jobs due to public scrutiny. Instead of patrol officers stopping and contacting suspicious people in high crime areas, a known deterrent to crime, instead they’d rather do nothing, and take a theft report in the morning. If we create an environment where police are too afraid to do their jobs effectively, we the people pay the price.
---
Ela wouldn’t be bad in that style. Nice work btw!
---
Please enlighten me on what part exactly I do not seem to have enough of the basic understanding of what happened? I do not know how exactly the "mechanics" behind his specific issue but I do know that the code can run flawlessly during inside testing and when deployed on the azure servers it might fail completely. YOu say I don't understand, but I do know enough to say that he is lashing out like a lil brat and that you are poking at me without even trying to build and advance the conversation since you just want to put me down. please EXPLAIN to me what you think I misunderstand or "know" nothing about. Help me understand better instead of acting like an asshole just saying "ya dont know shit about that". be helpful and positive. that helps. So again, please explain to me? Just saying that rn you don't seem to be more knowledgeable on this than I am based on this interaction. You might be or not. Only thing I know is Siege is a different beast than 99.99% of all other shooters due to the way it's built and made (engine choice, platform choice, server host/equipment). I do not know how they designed their online infrastructure for the matchmaking too. There is too many unknown for anyone that ain't working on the project to factually know wth is really going on. Oh and do not forget that ubi doesn't have much experience yet with this type of situation since it's their first, they aint infinity ward or blizzard or Dice. So again, I might be ignorant but I try to further my openness of mind and keep learning so either be the teacher or further the discussion which you aren't doing so far.

Don’t care about clash but this shields are way more important. Unbelievable we’re back here again.

Im on mobile. Do I have to do it on pc?

You think she might’ve had the ARX in early concepts? Probably not, but I like to dream...
---
Post about my siege waifu? Damnit, take your upvotes.
---
Could be, and I'm curious to know the actual reason.
---
This would, however, still be odd, because the patch notes were pretty clear:
---
*Moving forward, we will reset MMR between* ***the “middle” (2500 MMR)*** *and your rank from the previous Season, with extremes above 3500 and below 1500 clamped to those respective values.*
---
How about fixing the actual bugs before making changes?

Lol she looks like shes doing the T-Pose.

Sorry m8 that was a Russianbadger reference
---
Kaid tricking is extremely satisfying.
---
I mean I generally don’t look at speed when choosing an op I tend to rush in with just about anyone as long as I can handle their gun well but I get what you’re saying it would be nice to lessen the speed gap between ops
---
peace
---
This is why I play casual. The crayons taste better there anyway.
---
Bugs should be fixed anyway in the background. This isn’t a background change

Oh snap thanks bro

If that's true, ouch owie I've been had
---
That already said no Siege 2 . Maybe an upgraded engine when new consoles come out?
---
You now now day keyboards XD
---
No...to my knowledge Siege has always had the requirement of PS Plus...only on free weekends i think, that is disabled
---
When is that happening?
---
You’re*
---
I just downvote any Chapotards no matter what, he's right that sub is cancer
---
Just make her like montagne with a regular/extendo shield and give her 2 pistols for guns instead of the p10 and the smg.
---
unfortunantly its not that simple, porting a game over to a new game is a lot of work to get it to tje AAA standards and copy pasting code is not going work that easy, Ubisoft will have to change a lot of code for that to work properly. just updating an engine also doesnt really fix the core issues of the engine, you would have to rework the core which makes it pretty much a new engine. thats the reason companys dont just update the engine, thats a big undertaking.
---
Um..what?
---
That’s a good response. Thankyou. 
---
Yeah, the gap is ridiculous and speed just promotes bad habits overall. I only see positives in changing this.
---
Not 30, 8. It's only for the weapons owned by the new ops
---
Agree with Echo
---
He was stick in one position, crouching.
---
I’m sorry you feel that way
---
momentum will always be a big thing though in my opinion, but yes people will learn over time that going 2-1 could actually be pretty good depending on the map and side you start on. I just think that the old system didn’t need to be changed
---
It has auto correction it replaced piece with peace and that was a mess. Thanks for letting me know about that mistake
---
Claymores are still here btw
---
Probably will be a change with the game with the new consoles. And by Siege 2 maybe not a new title but just the same Siege with a new engine. But since it's a whole new engine it will have to be a "new" separate game
---
Oh okay thanks
---
Configure your router's firewall to block pinfs and you wont get Dossed
---
No the bugs should be first and foremost seeing as the most recent one gave clash and IQ game break glitches. I’m seeing you have a misdirection in priorities as a player and as a player should be trying to get across the point that the game is fucked up and needs fixing. The devs look on here and it’s why I’m assuming you posted here. So if they are looking why not complain about the shit that is a problem. So they can get all their manpower fixing it instead of being mad about you maining an op that is not a 3 speed. Unless of course you’re talking about bandit and his drug problem then yes they should put him in therapy for a season
---
Not the guy you're replying to, but in my head everyone on reddit is American unless I'm told otherwise 😂
---
Wat drone is the 3rd one?
---
Oh lol okay, yw
---
What about The universals like orange, black, red
---
If you look at it, I think that it’s actually like 10 weapons and 3 ops listed each weapon, which the game sometimes does (don’t know if it’s intentional or not and I believe I saw this on the confidential bundle)
---
to me it still has that "iron fist" look
---
I don't know why but I usually play with my friend and my 3  other random mates always (7 on 8 ranked) ban thermite while I rarely saw Blitz get banned
---
Even the devs make fails on maps.
---
There were rappel spots where there is no wall
---
vault through wall
---
sound failing to travel through walls/windows
---
these probably means that they manually make every "layer" and most if anything is independent from each other, it's not an engine anyone would have fun making a custom map
---
First year garage was the go to.
---
Community is too toxic, thanks for pointing this out, I never noticed this before
---
done
---
Speed is a problem. 
---
Bugs of this scale shouldn’t occur overall but we should never expect balancing changes to be put on hold when bugs should be fixed in the background. 
---
I’m in no way saying I don’t want the bugs fixed, but this should be happening while balancing ideas and concepts are worked on. 
---
They should be doing both
---
No because its not supposed to work that way ?!?

As you are asking genuinely, I will give a genuine answer, albeit not in the depth the question deserves. I encourage you to follow up with your own research into what I write.
---
The role of police: to apprehend lawbreakers and bring them to trial. They have no obligation to protect, and are inept/ineffective investigators. 
---
**In the short term:** do I support absolute police abolition? No. I support the following:
---
* Disarm the police. They have demonstrated, time and time again, that they are unable to use their sidearms effectively or responsibly. They take poor care of their guns, use them incompetently, and deploy them carelessly. On person equipment will consist of a taser and pepper spray, with a patrol rifle and tranquilizer gun in the car.
---
* Any use of force must be documented and justified. This includes brandishing/presenting a weapon. The paperwork should be a pain in the ass, and the consequences should be severe.
---
* Dash cams stay on while on patrol, with any attempt to obstruct them being severely punished. Body cams go on any time an officer steps out of his car, and stays on until he is back. Any attempt to obstruct or limit footage will be interpreted as intent of misdoing.
---
* Police officers will be prosecuted for breaking the law in the same way as a citizen. Police officers who are found to have killed an innocent will be imprisoned and permanently stripped of their badge.
---
* Police are to be utterly removed from the mental health system. They tend to escalate situations rather than deescalate them, and should not be anywhere near a suicidal individual.
---
**Intermediate changes**: at the completion of this stage, the police as we know them cease to exist, and become "peace officers" in a truer sense of the word.
---
* Shift the focus of training from force response to deescalation. Non-violent communication training is essential, both for their safety and the safety of the public.
---
* Mental Health training. People experiencing mental health episodes are typically more of a threat to themselves than others, and even those who are a threat will typically be quite safe once the episode passes. What does a manic episode look like? How about a psychotic episode? Officers should know this and have the skills to deal with them.
---
* Shift focus from apprehending law breakers to connecting people with needed services. Oftentimes people break the law out of desperation, ignorance, or lack.
---
* Educate police in systemic factors that produce crime, namely poverty and disenfranchisement.
---
**Long term changes**: the systemic causes of crime are addressed. Society becomes less hierarchical, less desperate and misguided.
---
I'm an anarchist. That is both an expression of my ideal society and my doubt that the changes I have listed above can occur within the confines of the current system. My ideal society is one in which communities protect and regulate themselves, removing the need for "police" as we know them.
---
Thermite has been banned in 8/10 of my placement matches.
---
Jäger main huh?
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Me too, I'm on PC stuck playing casual mostly because I don't have a squad I can rely on. Giddybird05 is UPlay name if you wanna hit me up.
---
From a certain point of view..
---
I cant tell if this is agreeing or disagreeing.
---
Haha is funny because clash is there which means that ubisoft actually cares
---
All I can see is Celestial Nighthawk from Destiny.
---
Your turning is dreadful tho? Like nice clip lol but turning is like console
---
I thought that if was supposed to be like that... Are the holes not eye slits?
---
why did no one come on yellow? no one on piano breaking the floor? no capitao fire bolt trough the hatch?
---
Why in god's name did he cook it for so long?
---
Good job ant!
---
He’s tied for first
---
No cap. My index finger started twitch when I saw it
---
It is personal choice. There is no absolute best in slot choice. It will depend on your skill, play-style and the map/operator. 
---
If you tend to hold longer angles the ACOG is good. If you are a quick run and gun player Holo or Reflex. If you look even pros don't all use the same sight. 
---
Pick what you are most comfortable using. I've seen too many people put ACOGs on all their guns and are unable to control the recoil but think they have to use it cause "its the best". I've also seen people pull of amazing long range pixel peeks with a reflex. 
---
Personally, I usually prefer the Reflex over the Holo just because the sight housing takes up less space on the screen. This is personal preference though.
---
Definitely try out all the sights and find what works best for you. As you play longer you may find your preference changes too. Never be afraid to switch up your choice on sight or other attachments. Experiment and see what works best for you.
---
but lion also has a bright yellow suit and he's not bad?
---
Don't worry my first time I was copper 4
---
Followed your link; looking at how Pepe is used [the argument seems to have some credibility.](https://preview.redd.it/n8rb6r76r3431.jpg?width=354&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36b8b2af47f6b8d5a3ba0235147cbff434dbf960)
---
Ability maybe, i am not sure really.
---
She’s gonna cost 100,000 renown?
---
They already said no to new siege game.  Its this one for ever. An engine update could be possible but it won't be a new game.
---
They are serious about pushing for 100 ops.
---
restart the game, it's a visual bug only
---
Cos I am on console?
---
I’m not denying the fact that people use it in hateful ways but the people in the sub were arguing that all uses were problematic and are hateful
---
you ban an operator that nobody plays? that makes as much sense as op banning Tachanka
---
Why do you put a suppressor on Ela’s shotgun?
---
This is a bug from ubisoft just restart your game and they will be back 
---
Since the start of the op, i have to reboot my game everytime I earn an alpha pack
---
Well it works as a threat too. Imagine in Bank putting the shield 1-2m from the door to servers. When attackers try to smoke plant for example, you pop the canister and grill them.
---
So they need to use equipment to take care of the shield first.
---
It doesn't say "Russian operatives".
---
Whilst finka maybe be part fo spetznas and on their call she is not currently serving with them and is part of a special unit.
---
The challenges are to complete with specific Units
---
Infinite time for a round...
---
It really does need a buff
---
use the search bar and read one of the million posts about this. there’s nothing Ubisoft can do.
---
Jackal has been banned every single game I’ve been in on PC so far
---
I’m a sneaky little bugger
---
Oof, wish my aim was as good as yours lol
---
I noticed that earlier, I'm glad to see I'm not alone.
---
Yes and just restart your game . Problem solved
---
His real secret is that he runs the parks and recreation department in Pawne Indiana
---
Nice
---
Yes there is, no other game has this issue... therefore there is a solution to the issue.
---
ofc it's balanced even if you play more defense rounds than attack, because when your team can win 3 rounds easy so can the enemies, when you are able to win 1 attack and the other team not, your team was better, if they can win 1 attack and you not, they are better? because when a map is really defender sided you gonna win anyways on defense? and so it's 3-3 where tf is it unbalanced?
---
I’ve opened one and then a match started and I didn’t get anything
---
Funny you mention strategies
---
There are actually several effective counterplays to this included a twitch drone (zap the batteries), you can attack from the stairs that kaid is looking at in the clip, or you can blow open the ceiling above them to attack from above.
---
I genuinely feel bad for everyone else thats saying they haven’t received a Black Ice and their a higher level than me. I’m hoping your next alpha pack treats you well!
---
That graph is showing you the break down of players in each rank. So you can see how much of the community is in the same rank as you.
---
i’ve seen a lot of moronic posts on this sub but.....wow. this might top them all
---
It was a charm given out for watching the Pro League Qualifier last weekend.
---
Alright.
---
Alright that sounds good. I'll do that.
---
thank you! that means a lot. ive put so many hours into practicing it
---
but nothing worked as well as carpel tunnel and an extremely low sensitivity
---
Ohe. . . you don't know about the third one.
---

So she’s basically the boss?

That happened to me yesterday

 **R6S - Allied Esports Minor - Pro League charm**
---
I agree, they messed up Ela's head
---
Who?
---
Your drawings made her remind me of Vilgax from Ben 10.

\*Insert Austin Powers Johnson spaceship joke here\*
---
No dude it was a miracle that we where all on at the same time.
---
From the numbers in your screen alone, you can calculate that it would take at least 292 years for a response to be had.  
---
I also think it would be way faster to write a letter and swim all the way to Ubisoft's server HQ and deliver it to them.
---
Idk if its me, or every Nøkk that I fought seems retarded because Im deaf, and I can hear the spooky bitch
---
Tachanka the mythical, illustrious unicorn
---
This should be the available to all weapons like the other seasonal skins.
---
Great, nowI can see vilgax while playing seige
---
100% agree the cheap ops are some of the best in the game.
---
But you always put the window on left side so capitao can't counter you easily
---
Joining parties of the people you trust is the best way to do things, but some people don’t know this. Some people get sent invites from people on the other teams, some dossers share your ip with other dossers.
---
Poor frost : (
---
Just change your Aspect Ratio to 5:4 in the Display Settings and it'll change it automatically.
---
People still don't know that it does nothing for you when you sprint
---
What version do you own?
---
Frost nerf is irrelevant, she is only viable as vault denial anyway, and still is, forcing the op to look down as they vault. The new change will make breaking the mats work as intended, consistently broken if you look down as you vault.
---
Mine whenever they do her dirty in the balance updates
---
I just thought that maybe I’d got the reward from the pack and hadn’t realised but I couldn’t be bothered to go through all my operators to check
---
Sledge shouldn't be able to break it in one shot.  Maybe two or three.   
---
   
---
Idk what to say about Ash or Zofia tho.
---
Lardex whyyyy did you eat all my goddamn stim shots
---
She looks like a bionicle to me
---
The only way to really counter it these days is Zofia or line of sight. Emp can't get it if it's in his hands.
---
Cheeki breeki hardbass was bass boosted
---
Søcc
---
platform?
---
Consulate is not, bank is not, border is not. All of those have too many shite obj’s.
---
We both own the standard version which was bought a couple of years ago
---
ash and zofia should be able to, if they couldn't then neither could impacts. but yea sledge shouldn't make  it obsolete since he had so many sledges possible
---
She's an evil android under that cover
---
Imagine being a professional game coder and some kids at home are able to get by your fail safe
---
Who the hell says fash?
---
Standard edition shouldn’t come with any operators, I assume he’s trolling you and either doesn’t have them or brought the year 1 bundle.
---
Ah now i remember oo:
---
Vert, acog, muzz or flash
---
Ynow i was kinda thinking the same thing
---
Technically Ling Ling killed herself.
---
Welcome, Dokkaebi main
---
Bad food for your muscle memory when it gets patched and you get screwed over because you subconsciously do it again and die.
---
Yup.
---
Bank has 2 solid objectives (lockers and CCTV, and CEOs, also the two middle objectives are decent as well), border has 2 solid objectives (armory lockers, and ventilation workshop) , consulate has 2 defendable objectives (admin and projector, and garage and kitchen)
---
When you start reading it for the Lewds...  
---
But you end up staying for the memes.
---
why he looking like an abomination of that monopoly dude
---
Any game ever*
---
Not to take away from anyone here but an attacker that can climb up hatches and windows sounds incredibly boring. I could see it mix up the meta a little bit I suppose and I would hope the Op has above average guns.
---
Thank you sir, almost 4 days played and 2000 kills on her
---
No he played with them when we were playing and I don’t think he’d just buy year 1 operators idk I just found it weird how he randomly got them. Pretty much he didn’t have them one day and the day later he got them pretty weird
---
I saw that as soon as I first saw her in game, i thought it’s meant to be that lol...
---
Who warms up for ranked?🤣 why is that considered a thing
---
I've also been a secure area/hostage guy since the beginning. I'm personally just not a fan of the whole 2-room dynamic that bomb introduces. I also think pick/ban has no place in ranked, as it's basically a crutch so you don't have to play against ops you don't like. Pry gonna be playing a lot of casual for the foreseeable future, unfortunately.
---
People in corners are the bane of my existence. Especially when they're sitting in a room across the map from objective :)
---
Why would he blow it up if he sees the enemy?! He probably even heard you step in a gu mine x]
---
I guess that kapkan trap just decided to not go off
---
I always thought those were angry eyes, it made her a bit creepier
---
Yeah most clips on here suck but this one is way better than average
---
He just seen the post on reddit where user discovered that Mira's mirror deals 3 damage on deploy to other player
---
All I see is Bicycle helmet
---
You can purchase a bundle that gives you all of the operators at a discounted price. Odds on is that he brought that.
---
Ah, it’s a privacy veil. Interesting.
---
It has become very clear that you cannot play this game without a full stack.  Even the nature of bomb means you have to have a lot of teamwork and players of a similar skill to compete
---
Want does nokks face look like?
---
I love it when this happens
---
Zzzz....
---
You need to improve, you're baiting yourself
---
Holy shit I just did it at 100 hp
---
Snek\*
---
she gon throw em bullet at ppl
---
I think the slits in her helmet look like the top of a bicycle helmet
---
Kinda reminded me of celestial nighthawk from destiny
---
Wow, Thanks asshole. If you're so anti-cop why are you playing a game where all the characters are cops?
---
I understand.
---
Hmm... so its like she's gonna be funny to play, but we might not see her in tournaments.
---
I understand your point.
---
*reeeeeeee's in FBI*
---
Kill the furries
---
meanwhile my frames drop to 10 and die to the first guy I see
---
It's cgi. Cgi is pretty expensive pal. Depending on the quality upwards of 80k per shot.
---
Nah not every operator's gun is as simple as that some operators like mira's vector or smg 11 has really much horizontical recoil. Buck is just pulling down and if you can pull down it is pretty much a laser gun.
---
why would you like to play blatantly unbalanced maps? Hereford is awful and almost always results in a 3:0 for defenders
---
If anyone wants to see gameplay of us i can record some tonight!

---
Reeeeeeeeee's in blyat
---
Tell your M/K friend he’s really a silver one. Cheating dick head
---
Don’t you think it’s pandering when the majority of DLC operators have been women. Heck they gave us 2 women for GROM when there are 0 in real life. Same with Valk and Nøkk
---
It. Is. Fiction.
---
I came here to see Nokk’s wife.
---
Those are [frogmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogman).
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who saw him
---
Nøkks inspiration
---
https://i.redd.it/lpl1yvig4al21.jpg
---
I would later in the month but idk what platform ur on
---
Then what’s preventing them from making the next operator a dog?
---
But he got a "buff".... He can move while Lions drone is activated and you don't need to wait till the ability is full again....
---
He is stronger now....
---
Q
---
Bam bam bam 🔥
---
The frick why am I getting down voted that was a joke
---
He must have been blown away when that happened
---
Opposable thumbs.
---
I want to help but am too offended by the guy who plays with mnk. I had to quit PS4 and leave hundreds of dollars worth of cosmetics and years of progress behind because of people like him. I can spot several things in their mindsets which are wrong already, though. Might comment later with some advice.
---
Ash and hibana for attack 
---
Bandit and Valkyrie for defence
---
Thermite - because there is a big effin hole coming right up.
---
Lesion - because his gu mines are annoying af and it's nice to catch people as they're removing it.
---
Ok then why not a chimp op?
---
I'm a innocent boy I could not fathom that someone would do such a thing
---
They still have 50 operators to go, so who knows!
---
Perhaps you could do the mocap for it.
---
I get it’s expensive and CGI but uni don’t have the budget to do that for a small trailer
---
Uhmmm... Hour well spent?
---
I cant unsee that extra e in helmet
---
I’m pretty sure there are separate options for “text language” and “voice language”
---
He is going to shoot into the celling which will ricoche and hit the drone. Duhh.. clearly big brain plays here
---
nah looks like kira
---
Definitely! It was really fun to do tbh.
---
You missed the whole part where I said 
---
pro league =/= ranked.  What works there doesn't work in unorganized, non communicative ranked?
---
Took it all right out of my mouth
---
And mine :)
---
Did you win?
---
Nor can I...
---
As someone who owns over 20 snakes, I’m greatly offended because she looks nothing like a snake lmao.
---
Hold up, I'm confused now, why is the plat charm a diamond.
---
theyre both women and they have chins
---
*youre on to something intensifies*
---
I main Mav or sledge on offense because I like the upfront destructive attitude that gets shit done either quietly or very not quietly. On defense I'd go with Mozzie and Jager because of their versatility and cool design and guns. Good gadgets for camping on objective, low enough armor and high enough damage output to make a good roamer,perfect equilibrium. I'll switch to kapkan or chank on defense every so often though, and buck on offense.
---
I can't unsee iron fist.
---
Thank you!
---
I always truck lesion and dokka players.  I wait to pull the needle and won’t reset the phone.  Most players will wait until they think you are recovering.  I don’t suggest doing this with low health.
---
Thanks, mozzie if used properly completely shuts down twitch. I've been doing this tactic ever since now.
---
Jackal, Hibana and Zofia on attack because of utility. Jackals great for clearing roamers especially on larger maps like bank or consulate. Also have you tried the C7E? With a shotgun secondary for soft destruction and smokes he really brings a lot to the team. Hibana is great for getting hatches or making new lines of site and as for Zofia, she’s got 2 breaching charges, 2 Ela mines and you can bring a claymore. 
---
On defence I like Ela, Vigil, Cav and Jager. Ela’s nice cuz you can bring barb for the team and set up mines on common pushes to help out the team while you roam. Vigil and Cav are good for deep roaming but don’t bring much to the team itself unless you get a successful interro. Jager is more utility heavy and is better for some sites if you know that smokes and frags will be used to clear people out.
---
why not just try out and see since you gonna use the gift from your friend?
---
Massive respect, it was very interesting to see!
---
If the ACOG is available, I'll usually use it unless I'm expecting to be in close quarters. If the ACOG is not available or the magnification is not needed, then I go either Holo or Red dot, unless the operator has the Spetsnaz reflex. With the normal reflex sight, I have a hard time seeing the green triangle, especially at further ranges.
---
❤️
---
On console I like using muzzle brake on a lot of guns cause i don’t hold the trigger down when shooting, i tap tap tap really fast and muzzle break with helps that. Check out this guy on YouTube varsity gaming he has a long video on how to roam he is a beast very educational
---
Having fun is all what matters. And it's still impressive, I'd give up after 5 minutes.
---
Exactly.
---
He definitely doesn't anymore is what I meant. He's strong and that buff was unnecessary and too powerful.
---
You are worse than guys making jokes about Mozambique(the country) and Mozambique(the gun) on r/ApexLegends
---
This has actually happened to me twice where I downed a sledge and he just stood up. I can’t remember if it was finka, but I’m pretty sure there wasn’t one.
---
This happened to me to this patch.
---
Pick and ban was a mistake
---
Jesus, some people really do eveything for a win.
---
What did you say about blitz
---
With darkness and silence through the night...
---
Shield isn’t see though and clear, for starters.
---
Keep the electric stun, but make it only stun, not injure the target. 
---
The electric stun has limited uses ( you aren’t getting and more charges if you use them all )
---
He’s a good op. Ppl take him for granted.
---
It reminds me of the celestial nighthawk
---
It wasnt triggered. Twitch stood too far away and Sledge was on the left of the doorframe.
---
In all seriousness, has anyone found a place to purchase a similar helmet? I'd like to get a Nokk cosplay together. I can spray the helmet if need be, just looking for that specific shape with the holes.
---
What a thrilll
---
thats what you get for playing gridlock
---
It’s silver 2 😂
---
I think this shows his balanced his gun is lol
---
[I made this for the occasion](https://i.imgur.com/GtvFcZP.jpg)

U mean back when she was an A-10 Warthog that could Kool-Aid man herself anywhere on the map?
---
I don’t have issues using her pistol, and I don’t even play her enough to get that good with it
---
Warden straight up looks like commissioner Gordon from Batman. It’s like they face scanned him and put him in the game.
---
You're right. At one point it looks like Sledge peeks into the doorway, but it must just the camera angle
---
Xbox is just as bad, I’ve been in 5 games this past month me and my friends “lagged out of”
---
I basically used to have the same exact problem. I got the Netgear nighthawk on sale and it’s probably the best $60 I’ve ever spent. I would highly recommend it.
---
Such aids
---
She is the most forgiving shield operator to come up against in the game.  She is not immediately lethal, Cannot randomly headshot you if RNG is against you.   
---
She is what ever shield operator should be redesigned around.  You are protected but you have some major downsides.   
---
instead we have shield ops = you are hard to kill from the front, can randomly instantly kill the other team and acan be an absolute nightmare to deal with.
---
Imagine if they showed the heights of the operators in their Bio in game.
---
Honestly
---
Ya think
---
Connection lost. Feels bad bro
---
:(
---
Give him a Dallas headgear now
---
The only wish i have is her recoil to get better like a normal gun i play on ps4 and her recoil (if you don't control it) it's goin up left
---
look up the stats?
---
rogue 9 dmg spreadsheet?
---
the facial expressions add alot to the image haha nice work
---
Use your microphone. Give callouts.
---
The Alda has some pretty insane hip fire accuracy
---
Warden is like insurance incarnate
---
Hit Plat 1 on PS4 this season and it happens about once in every 3 games. People are just sad and need a badge by their name to show how ‘good’ they are
---
How do I unlock that gun?
---
It's Magic!
---
M762 is statistically one of the best ARs in the game
---
True
---
This has potential as a meme format
---
Oh, that first tip makes a lot of sense of learning cams on def. almost like a bonus small objective for me to do that will be super beneficial in the long run :D 
---
With the video link, I am half way through it, I just have to finish it haha, but it’s good overall tips. I think just more map/spawn knowledge would be great so I can be a lot smarter with reinforcing ;D
---
I might try out the T hunt, but I just love bomb haha. The game mode is so beautiful, but depending on my role, it is difficult to learn. Maybe as warmups T hunt would be good. I could just grind specific maps for a while, I think I will do that. Ty fam, the inner competitive me just wants to be good at everything all the time
---
But most of the time....?

---
My god, I love these kind of questions. 
---
\-&gt; It really, really and REALLY depends on yourself and whatever you feel comfortable with. Something like "the best" simply does not exist. If the reflex works for you - good. If the ACOG works for you - good. If any other sight works for you - still good. I think you get the point.
---
My favorite attacker
---
Οr at least make it not have the range of A FUCKING MISSILE ACROSS THE GLOBE.
---
Rainbow should add an inspection button because the skins on these guns are beautiful and I wanna look at them at better views in game
---
link?
---
That would actually be cool if the elite operators had a gold icon on the top of hud when they were played
---
All ops are the same height (6ft) in game
---
No it’s a celestial nighthawk
---
That’s not a rework that’s a complete nerf not even Blackbeard got so fucked
---
Yeah, that’s fair. With how little ops I have atm, technically I do main someone lol. Sad day when
---
Okay so basically zofias rifle has a faster ttk but against less armors si the L85 is more consistent against higher armors
---
I hate it. I don't understand why it was implemented. Was anyone asking for this? 
---
Doing the same thing 3 rounds in a row is boring as fuck and repetitive enough to drive me insane.
---
Do you see how many changes they make every new season? They are far far far from 4/28
---
Nokk’s is redacted
---
Tk warning in the top right
---
AK-12 begs to differ
---
I've got a 3v5 on ranked from the beginning. Unfortunately that post was shadow-banned from this subreddit.
---
Always fam, communication is the most important thing. As a nurse, trust me, it is key to success :)
---
Make her like a real British cop, no gun, just a shrill whistle and a club /s
---
Yes
---
Why does every one ban echo? I'm still pretty new and you never see him in casual
---
That is a horrible mirror placement. o.O But yeah, sucks.
---
“One of the best”
---
Read please
---
Reduced that drone to atoms
---
Good news, they already did that again
---
3v5 on ranked. "Screenshot" lol. Use printscreen or F12 if you are on steam.
---
We were all lobbing nades onto the top of the building, a frag came back and downed my buddy the previous round.
---
Zofia’s AR kills all armor types in 3 shots
---
I see the Bionicle Rahkshi helmet myself.
---
Most of the time people piss me off
---
Everyone that goes down has 20hp, that slowly goes down overtime, so 4 shots generally should do it but on a 3 armor i think it's maybe 5-6? not entirely sure.
---
You mean Nøkk?
---
Stupid good recoil control with that weapon. That’s insane. But the halfassed corner checking kills me a little. Granted I was not watching with volume on at work so you might have already had your info from their. Either way, good fucking play
---
These are always the best
---
A light-hearted joke. No need to get the panties bunched.
---
I hate how pro-league is dictating ranked. Pro-league is such a small percentage of players. A small minority is effecting the large majority of players.
---
Wait, you might be onto something...
---
Still low res for me
---
Haha nice
---
my gt is Hallzy4Life
---
I prefer anchoring. It mostly has to do with my preferred operators (Maestro, Lesion, Echo, Rook, Kaid) being on the slower side, or it being more beneficial to the team if I survive longer. When I try to roam, I usually move at the wrong time and die, or end up never seeing anyone during the round.
---
No because the recruit shouldn’t be an operator you would pick, he’s for memeing or for if you don’t have any operators
---
IOU one silver award possibly gold
---
It wasn't. In the full clip, which wasn't posted, a concussion mine went off. That's when my friend suggested that Ela was going that way, so I broke the barricade, and when I shot, I headshot him. We got a good laugh out of it. I'm not trying to come off as an asshole, I'm just trying to prove a point.
---
It depends on how long it would take
---
Yea, They made it so you can still team kill, Rotate team killing a random with your friends and still throw matches.   
---
Oh wait, no it didnt change in any meaningful way.
---
That's why I die so much when I'm smoke compared to other op hahaha
---
(Outbreak headgear / furry smonk uniform)
---
Yeah I think something might just be wrong with it even though it’s out of beta I believe
---
Outplayed lol
---
*insert joke about playing Lion makes you bad here*
---
Imagine that you’re so bad that you get upset with other people’s operator choices
---
Damn that sucks
---
Warden looks like Tom selleck
---
[deleted]
---
Cause he would be exactly like bandit. Only thing different would be bandit tricking. Kaid can do anything bandit can. Increasing it would make him a must pick over bandit in all objectives except Chalet
---
Skin?
---
Its bland and boring...
---
The only true answer
---
Isn't this the point
---
Hell yeah
---
Dream about it
---
No dude you just let it happen, as a mozzie main it’s rough seeing your own little cutesy spider go into the ground it rough
---
Weapon skin
---
Stop witchhunting
---
Doesn’t everyone use this spot?
---
How bout we just go in the building as intended
---
Ok man just wait lol
---
This is not the place to report them
---
So a camo but I don’t even really pay attention to what the camps are called
---

---
Imagine being so bad that you can only play with lion so you get salty when people banning him.
---
Thanks!
---
Chalet is totally fucking unbalanced, you cut all of defences rotate by holding K9, that's it you cant challenge it. It forces the defenders to ban maverick because he ruins it and with all of the attackers now such as capitao, you simply can't hold down trophy. you're not a bomb player though so you clearly don't care about balance.
---
Individual performance in games doesn't affect your rank, only win/loss. The difference between you and your teammates is probably due to the soft reset where your starting mmr in a season is affected by your mmr at the end of the previous season. The soft reset was just introduced this season.
---
What’s the difference?
---
Because it's psychologically manipulative to create false scarcity.
---
They could just put them in a shop, but they want to piss you off so you buy the entire set. But this community is completely fine with the devs shitting on them.
---
How is that overpowered
---
Sens is way to high
---
The new kaffee is wayyy better than the old one, reason why it will be in PL/ESL from the start.
---
That's my complaint, the range is fuckin absurd. Should be only a bit further than melee range imo.
---
That costs me one of my placements bc I did a few the day  before like wtf why i didn’t even play
---
Buck and thermite for attack, mute and bandit for defense.
---
Alright thx
---
Hello, you seem to be referencing an often misquoted statistic. 
---
TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.
---
The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. &amp; Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:
---
Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.
---
There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:
---
The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The “domestic violence” acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c
---
An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:
---
The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.
---
More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862
---
Yet another study "indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)." A.H. Ryan JR, Department of Defense, Polygraph Institute “The Prevalence of Domestic Violence in Police Families.” http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4951188/FID707/Root/New/030PG297.PDF
---
Another: In a 1999 study, 7% of Baltimore City police officers admitted to 'getting physical' (pushing, shoving, grabbing and/or hitting) with a partner. A 2000 study of seven law enforcement agencies in the Southeast and Midwest United States found 10% of officers reporting that they had slapped, punched, or otherwise injured their partners. L. Goodmark, 2016, BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW “Hands up at Home: Militarized Masculinity and Police Officers Who Commit Intimate Partner Abuse “. https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2519&amp;context=fac_pubs

Bruh its clean af. The whole pixel in that image.
---
It’s a shame i lost two of my placement games to the clash glitch :(
---
She’s better then before? It’s still a 2 shot up close and it’s actually viable at long range now
---
It's better old one was boring
---
No unfortunately
---
You should just go to a corner and suck an egg... Good work tho.
---
Capitao !!
---
frosts 9mm c1
---
Im in. My gt is “vaecy”
---
Ok? Then play defense from top floor like everyone else. That’s why there are roamers in this game use them to their fullest.
---
Interesting. Discord should NOT be eating up that much performance. Something is definitely up.
---
You just answered your own question.
---
Is Warden any good?
---
Finka boost
---
Never join random party invites.
---
Jäger was thinking “clutch moment! My time to shine!”
---
Reeee
---
Yeah I can't always be in 5-stacks and when I'm not I probably get those bastards.
---
Why the fuck does Warden run with his gun held up? Does he think he looks cool doing it??
---
oh this is bad
---
Didn’t he just get nerfed?
---
I agree tho. Buff the Russians!
---
Haha suit
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
I play on PC and I feel your pain. I used to be high gold-low plat when I had a squad that played constantly but now that I mainly solo queue or with 1 other, it’s like every game is a 4-5 loss because I couldn’t carry hard enough. It’s absolutely soul crushing too, so now I’m stuck at high Silver.
---
Airframe is fragmentation rated though it’s not just a bump  helmet
---
Funny. When your logic begins to fail you begin to criticize something unrelated to the argument and try to shut it down.
---
NPC much?
---
I learned the hard way
---
I did on the same place a 4k maestro clutch
---
Ain't no bitch.
---
Just saying, there's no reason for you to give off a negative vibe wherever you go.
---
It's not much but it's mine ^-^
---
I don’t know how we got downvoted, but okay.
---
Because Recruit can have frags and smokes at the same time
---
How can they fix people leaving? It’s not exactly a glitch or a bug.
---
By design
---
BITCH WENT INVISIBLE.
---
"Didn't play nice" is an understatement.
---
German? Swedish? Denmarkiense?
---
Where did you get these pics from?
---
I’m not saying every party invite is that. But better to lean on the side of caution
---
Steam app is trash man, utter garbage. If you’re still waiting on windows (which i assume because you said waiting on software), you can download and load windows onto a usb for free and install it from Microsofts website. It will be unactivated but will work just fine with no drawbacks to performance. That’s if you have a usb and a spare computer of course
---
It could also be Capitao because the samurai has a scar on his left eye and it could be the headgear.
---
this joke definitely hasn't been made literally every day since warden came out /s
---
 Your placement performance (wins to losses) dictates what you place at and the first 50-100 games gives you huge elo gains/losses. The more you play, the less you start to earn for each win or loss.
---
Eventually, after 100+ games, you're basically stuck where you are for that season unless you start winning games constantly (or you continue to play a TON with like a 60% win rate at least).
---
Unlike games like Overwatch, there isn't any performance-based gains or losses when it comes to a match. So, you gain the same or lose the same regardless of if you're the guy who clutches a 1v5 each round or you're the guy who goes 0-9 in an overtime match.
---
To actually get arrested you need to do something serious, like have 2g of weed on you or be a black man
---
Ow ...
---
I'm still lost.
---
Yes, did this recently
---
Only playing t hunt must be the most boring thing in the world. If you think you’re too bad to play no then why don’t you just keep playing until you get better?
---
What is ddos
---
No, this is Patrick!!!
---
Is she gay
---
You know what is absolutely hysterical is you think you're unique in using this NPC comment but I have seen it *dozens* of times in this thread. You might want to find something else to say 🤷♀
---
Think what you want, I'm just not going to waste my time talking with someone who is so committed to misunderstanding what I'm saying. Nothing I can possibly say will make you take a step back and think, so I'm just not going to waste the energy
---
Wow so random haha
---
I'm guessing you are ranked below gold, but so am I so I can relate. Vertical play is a part of the game. You can use drones to see if there are any vertical angles and if you arent good at countering them, you can always find another point of attack. If you really want this control though, 1 check if there is a pulse on there team. If there is make sure you drone EVERYTHING. If no pluse then just make sure the angle is clear and there is no one near. You can also get a teammate to help push the player upstairs but depending on time and/or strategy, this might not be the best idea. I see you are a hibana main and with the new pick and ban, you might end up being the only hard breach on the team, so you should probably get someone else to push it for you. If you have a good team with a strong team clear or good adaptability, vertical play shouldn't be that much of a problem. I know that in lower ranks people dont normally have 5 stacks or usual teams they play with, so you have to try to communicate all your information with your team the best you can. I hope this helped and keep sieging!!!
---
What do you need explained? I will tell you.
---
True, That man is probably thicc.
---
The thing about replying to another account.
---
I got my sens all set up in it but then I couldn’t figure how to enable adsing which makes the thing kinda useless. Are you actually able to ads in it or do you have to set up the normal sens to be your ads sens?
---
At that point you could just melee her shield. She'd be even worse.
---
See I have another account and he also commented like his entire life story on it.
---
can't a guy just drive while black?
---
As the mother looks over her children she uses the M870 to ward off unfriendly attackers.
---
Very nice mustache
---
Ya toxic ash main i like because i am too
---
Nah she's just wearing Celestial Nighthawk from Destiny
---
Servers have been shit since the season came out. I’ve bluescreened 7 times already and my friend and some random got booted from our game yesterday and wouldn’t let them join back.
---
not really, he still has to stand still for it to work
---
What do you mean it's free in general?
---
Lol I didn't hear him either
---
It’s going to be a free game not just limited to siege players
---
Excactly. It's literally annoying. They complain about every damn new map and reworked one.
---
Ubi should just stop with any more maps and we keep ranked forever with the same rotation: Oregon,clubhouse,coastline,chalet,bank and consulate sinve those ungrateful people don't appreciate any single new map nowadays.
---
Wow this gave me real cancer
---
He’s fine. He’s no longer an entry dragged who can kill anyone with ease. The nerf was good
---
Nokk is a danish special op, Mozzie is an Australian weirdo with a dirtbike helmet on.
---
It’s safe to say, hard no.
---
If you haven't yet found a regular few people i'd recommend it, build up your team chemistry over time.
---
Yes please .
---
I once knifed someone when I was breaking a barricade, bc they punched where I was going to
---
Wait what? When did Ubi said it's gonna be free? Can you send a link or something? I must have missed it
---
That’s a pretty fuckin fast year flew by
---
Well cops are just the worst. It’s common sense like hating nazis
---
The one achievement I had left on siege is now complete and there’s no way I did 100 thunt defense missions, idk what’s going on
---
its probably the supressed deagle
---
Replace his shield with the Spear or SASG, make him two speed. The end.
---
That makes sense, you cant place higher than your highest rank.
---
is this cgi or irl
---
0:37 im checking score board  [https://prnt.sc/o21aq0](https://prnt.sc/o21aq0)   
---
0:28 i cant reload my gun....
---
I don't think you know what incarnate means lmfao
---
What did the gun look like
---
dont use the twitch dmr
---
If it's an AR15 with Hera Arms CQC furniture, it was a photoshop that made it's original debut on reddit by another user. Has been mistaken as Nokk's 'original gun' countless times since.
---
Im not asking for realism 100% but at least make ir to where the gun is reasonable
---
Exactly, majority of these maps aren’t made for a 3 round switch, Hereford is extremely defender-sided
---
Mavericks is an AR-15 with an 50 cal upper receiver. Pretty cool design
---
The server was lagging out
---
Yeah forget clash, Blackbeard needs deleting from the game. Fucking punishes you for being good. Best way to make BB acceptable in my eyes would be flip his shield so it protects his chest not his head
---
I never said I downvoted anyone here, though
---
Yes, it's way more balanced now.

Then select the video and you can choose homescreen or both.

And tiddies
---
Yep, I got one and same thing on Xbox.
---
No more electric bullshit.
---
cool.
---
You are saying it makes sense when my mates highest rank is bronze 1 yet he placed gold 3 this season
---
I’m so glad clash is gone
---
That is the biggest fucking issue with her.
---
Oh my go away dude no one cares
---
*No Comment*
---
Restart your game and they’ll be there, it’s a known glitch.
---
Not very useful overall imo but might be worth bringing when your playing against nerds who bring all the aids ops every round on attack
---
Haha I was thinking the same thing earlier on and was thinking about switching teams (orange to blue and vica versa) because then the drone n cam colours could make sense. Not sure if I'm thinking straight or its my OCD lol
---
They aren’t milking me at all because I don’t buy them, how else do you think those events will be paid for if not by people buying the packs to get them stuff?
---
Looks like chlorophypte headgear from Terraria
---
How do you get your account stolen. Just change up your psn password. Dont go asking people for money on reddit because you dont feel like spending your own on rainbow six.
---
Also recruit rush
---
False, he said "insurance incarnate," therefore, insurance embodied in human form. A video game character is in human form, is it not?
---
I'm on it
---
I saved the video on the PS4 then recorded it on my phone
---
You mean.          h.                A

T ch

D          p

R

O

This is correct
---
They should give my option a try.
---
Jeez, I had a controller for 3 years and it was dying, had my current one for 2. Never realised how bad the stick drift was until I played Apex, the setting for the elite controller had a lot of stick drift, was significantly the best option but I was constantly looking down and to the right. Pretty annoying
---
I have seen enough MnK on higher ranks on
---
Xbox but that doesn’t seem like MnK
---
That would be me and my friends
---
it does, but i think the diamond is animated, so that’s pretty neat
---
He totally does look cool
---
It wouldn't be useful at all, watching an angle isn't worth standing on a suicide platform and be detrimental to the team because they'd have to play 4v5 in the building, it doesn't have enough windows for the towers to be useful. They were introduced as a gimmick, and they will stay that way because they are just death beds waiting for someone to get peeked at a window, if someone knows that you're there, you'd have to aim precisely where he's gonna peek from for you to get that kill, with more than one window your chances are doomed. On the other side though, the guy knows exactly where you are and he also knows that your space is so narrow that he wouldn't have too much problem to kill you because you have 0 cover. The problem is that you need to take the defense into account, and once you do, you'll see that you're at a clear disadvantage once you're standing on those narrow spaces.
---
Kinda like Mozzie’s reloading animation; just to add a little bit of “zest” into the game
---
You know what, bro. Yeah, they should. If it works we only benefit from it
---
No it literally is not. The literal meaning of incarnate is that it's not fictional. A fictional game character cannot be incarnate as it's not made of flesh. Are you a troll or a retard?
---
Yeah the drone colors should be Red if it's an enemy drone same with camera's and if it's your drone it should be like white or blue even
---
these are Sims souls trapped for us to put on display
---
For fuck sakes man.
---
PS4 has a report player feature. Right under vote to kick. You can a match and immediately report any player you want. 
---
Unless your were talking about a different reporting feature
---
It's not the operation name. It's their CTU. Like finka and lion
---
I totally agree. We definitely need more of it.
---
I keep not shooting cameras because I see the blue and I'm still expecting the red 😂
---
he's shooting through smoke nobody can fucking see him it's goddam stupid to compare slightly adjusting your position to reset a turret.
---
Balloon boy from fnaf
---
I think it wouldn’t be very balanced
---
I can't change my password. Because he changed the password of my email account. I didn't force you to support me. If you don't want to then its fine 😊
---
Then I highly suggest you get your eyes checked or at least, pay more attention when he switches to pistol.
---
I've already did. I will just wait.
---
It’s a pc feature that they just left on console without taking taking out. It literally does nothing on console.
---
You forgot /s
---
How do you figure?
---
You believe what you want
---
Did you read the definition? Incarnate can be in human form, and last I checked, Warden is a human. If anyone is the troll, it's you. You're the one who come on this person's comment talking about "you don't know what it means" and now that YOU'VE been proven wrong, you're trying to play victim. No one here is trolling except you, and judging by your username, I'd guess this isn't even your real account, rather your trolling account. Now sit down, read a book, and educate yourself, buddy.
---
I bid you good day, sir/ma'am.
---
Yeah, can’t say he doesn’t especially when i one tap him with Lions V-308 because he can’t pull out his gun out first.
---
Dear god they both *have hair*

Where did you hear that she was going to be a sniper? If anything, there was only a talk about her having an AR which ended up making her too strong. Concept &amp; Bio artworks often don't reflect what the operators will have after all.
