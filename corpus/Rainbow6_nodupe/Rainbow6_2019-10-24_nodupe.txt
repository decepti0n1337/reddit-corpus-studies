Can he cane downed ops? /s
---
---
---
One is a coldblooded killer, that would end a person's life within the blink of an eye, shooting them without remorse - the other one is an operator from rainbow 6
---
I can assure you that it's not a problem with Internet
---
I love the cute ghost more than some derpy muscle skull
---
Why do they include recruit in the events
---
Believe it‚Äôs the same announcer as Showdown
---
When amarus ability is actually useful
---
Lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
No. He is the worst one
---
This is the most stupid thing I‚Äôve ever heard. Bruh
---
Lol
---
Incredibly accurate
---
Idk then probably contact ubi support and i'm sure you have already and maybe the internet provider as well
---
New ops. But what if they are trash like the last 8.
---
You grew up lol
---
I meant jackal is the least effective
---
I disagree with that actually. Nothing could ever be perfect, so always wanting something to be better breeds an unsatisfiable community. Like what siege has for the most part. Even if the game were perfectly coded and executed in every way, there would still be masses of angry and unsatisfied people
---
Recruit, god among monsters
---
It wasn't the speed that made Kapkan viable, it was the trap rework. His previous trap was way too obvious to anyone with even mediocre eyesight.
---

---
That said, for someone like Kapkan, it's impossible to be balanced for both the pros and the casuals. As it stands he's a casual, easy to use operator with a no skill gadget, and it's only really effective against people of similar skill level.
---
For Warden, it's a bit different. He could be a 3 speed and maybe then people would just play him as a roamer, and even that is a maybe. His gadget just isn't good, and I find it pointless to try to make him viable by buffing the rest of his kit. Being one speed doesn't stop Doc, Rook, Echo, Mira or Maestro from being top tier operators, so clearly it wasn't Warden't problem either.

"How to throw the game during match point." - 2019 Colourised
---
what about a op with a cage that you put on the ceiling and if a attack op walks under it it falls and its like leashions mines invisible but can be spoted with the vector 45acp and a 12 Gage shotgun and jackles side arm shotgun and his or hers name is wrangler but the attack ops can still shoot out of it but it only stays down for 20 secions or can be destored by glazes sniper
---
At least release Ela was fun to play
---
That type of stuff will likely never be in the battle pass only regular cosmetics
---
This message showed for me but i legit just havent got a free pack at all lmao
---
Mention it.
---
Ok rush through will your whole team
---
Hey now nomads amazing
---
Omg great find
---
well last year were packs as well and I don't think you can get them seperately. As for the previous years I think they just made them legacy so if had bought them last year that was probably the only time u could.
---
Yeah. And maybe mozzie.
---
Unpossible
---
Defense is pretty easy. Camp in one room. Reinforce the walls. And just wait for them to push. Kapkan traps, frost traps, smoke, lesion. RIP attackers. And then run out once you hit the 45 secs remaining mark. Easy defense win.
---
Yeah I got this too. Being recruit is good for once
---
Why? They are all the same model just using Lion jackal and pulses abilities.
---
‚ÄúhE iSn‚ÄôT uSeD iN pRo LeAgUe‚Äù
---
Who actually gives a fuck
---
Kapkan isn‚Äôt pre-nerf Ela tier, but he‚Äôs still a good operator. His gadget gives you intel and can win games.
---
Except... three people hit frost traps, everyone loses 60 hp to kapkan, 1 person dies to a gu tower, and the other guy breathes in toxic chemicals
---
Pasta
---
phasing through walls
---
Not possible
---
Bruh are you retarded? I literally think you have a mental disability. They fund their game off A event like pl and it‚Äôs twitch streams. B from in game purchases which is literally the entire game. But they added a new mode with skins to ops which are way too expensive from the start. And you said it yourself. A limited time event with useless cosmetics. Meaning they just want more fuckin money on top of the cash stack they currently sit on. Maybe if they actually made a decent fuckin game mode then they would get more money. As far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs all the content creators and a very small portion of the standard community that actually buys this shit.
---
I wish we would have had a heads up and I would have been saving!
---
As it should be &gt;:)
---
Seriously tho, I have my volume quite high so I can hear enemies approaching and go invisible
---
Would definitely work with a 5 man, I play on xbox so getting randos to manage any of that would be nothing short of a miracle haha
---
You can destroy the Kapkan and the frost traps
---
you're a fucking retard
---
Really? So sitting in a corner getting lion scanned jackal tracked and pulse scanned isn‚Äôt difficult? Meanwhile it takes forever to activate your useless ability so you can‚Äôt do anything.
---
yes. its possible , it just depends on your enemys and your teammates
---
Rarly but yes
---
That's why you can wait until the actual round. It's literally casual, a game mode which is meant to be played *casually*, not like a ranked match. If it were a ranked match I'd understand, but is it really fair to effectively deny people the ability to play the game? As for the minutes thing, that's why I said you could at least wait a bit. Anything longer than a minute or two, fine, but kicking people after ~30 seconds is just obnoxious.
---
i entered on twitter with an actual selfie of the cosplay! i want the skins so bad ahhh
---
That was quick
---
How rarely is rarely?
---
thats fair

[r/mademesmile](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
because Ubi is a business and the entire purpose of a business is to make money, and pretty simple to understand the loot packs make them more money
---
Can do that with pulse
---
Use your gadget, don't sit by a soft wall, have an exit strategy
---
RIP. 
---
We managed to get randoms on PC. It was awesome fun. And then they tried it but forgot about the window behind. Easy attack win. Lol
---
Nice, now show us SMG-11 with acog.
---
they won't do that they'd do it through situations and like I said ubi won't be updating them as they never have with the newer operators, if they ever added a shooting range it would be to test an operator with their gun and that's it nothing else, it's not apex legends with their upcoming firing range rework
---
No shit reknown is free, but they‚Äôre asking for 300k if it for all the cosmetics. You tell me the last time you got up to 300k reknown cause I guarantee you have never hit 300k reknown.

no..nothing old comes back

---
So stupid u used to be able to
---
[deleted]
---
How tf is this possible?
---
question. I haven‚Äôt played the event yet but are the defenders and attackers the same speed? No matter who you pick
---
Not saying you're wrong, but I just want to tell a funny story about how I sat in the same spot as a defender the whole round and wasn't found. They even came into my room a couple times.
---
I mean, the effort doesn‚Äôt really spread evenly round Ubisoft
---
No it does I saw a Lesion on casual clear as day because of that headgear
---
and you are absolutely right about that there are no barriers for playing ranked(except lol.30)
---
Yes it is
---
Awesome as hell!
---
That was fast
---
Same I didn't get a rainbow is magic pack of dokters curse pack
---
*cries in Apex Legends skins*
---
who
---
Exactly what I was thinking, lol. And I love the jiggly effect
---
I just want to understand what makes people so angry and toxic I guess. Doesn't help that alot of the biggest streamers for many games are pretty toxic players too
---
You don‚Äôt have lesion unlocked huh
---
Yes it happens on defense as well, I guy uploaded a video a few hours ago
---
How did you manage to find a lobby of people who just sat there with their teeth in their mouth?  Even on console, the players who aren‚Äôt all that great at least set up.
---
I hate shields (mainly clash)
---
Like 50 lol
---
Yup
---
So what if they wanna make a quick buck off of cosmetics? There‚Äôs games out there on the market right now where paying money gets you a competitive advantage...
---
Be thankful Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt do that. Not to mention all the free content they‚Äôve been giving us for the past 5 years. 
---
It‚Äôs not a perfect game, but it pisses me off when people like you complain about cosmetics in a game where cosmetics give you no advantage...
---
More times than not, my squad wins on defense.  Attacking is so much more difficult.
---
It still hurts me every day.
---
I have found that defense is actually easier
---
I‚Äôm curious did you like wear a mask covering your mouth?
---
people: fuck shields
---
ubi: yeah ok fuck shields
---
They're the same picture
---
I get why some people don‚Äôt like shields but they‚Äôre easy to counter all I‚Äôm sayin is blitz and Monty are literally unplayable may as well remove them then
---
No because it's unnecessary loading

This is the dude who writes on the bathroom wall with his own feces

Doesnt mention the fact he is playing with leongids LUL

r/dontputyourdickinthat

fuck your shields
---
Probably a second challenge one for the second week of the event. So in total 3 most likely.
---
I don't really see the point tbh. I could maybe understand it if it was a tiny box in a corner but this takes up so much room
---
Yes youre right, perhaps its a tease for year 4?
---
Hahahaha
---
I have the red doot on for that Russian Badger strat that he used during last years halloween event so that‚Äôs the only reason why I use it
---
And my aim was like that because (at the time I made this) my ads sensitivity was wayyyy to high so yeah
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Hot damn.  I was considering it but there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôd be able to grind out 65k in a week.
---
Bad luck maybe? I play PS4 and am a Platinum player, but I get toxic messages maybe once a month. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just an Xbox playerbase problem?
---
Same
---
The event challenge for a pack only lasts a week while the event lasts for two weeks, so maybe that hints towards a second challenge.
---
Not how it works but okay downvote me instead of researching yourself
---
That would make defense too easy
---
"playing siege with the broken shards of my dreams"
---
Nah.  What will help is buffing his gadget.
---
New Wallpaper
---
But stalker is bad?
---
Both
---
no problem buddy
---
Flesh light
---
yeah ubi needs to fix the fuckin unranked people boosting bs
---
Blitz is still viable, Monty is still good at what he does.
---
Because cell phone pics of screens are garbage and it's not at all difficult to transfer a picture with a flash drive.
---
This, had a friend get a blitz ads ace without flashes
---
I‚Äôve already won 3 defense games
---
Kapkan is literally the darkest skin I‚Äôve ever seen and there are many skins that blend into some maps they already have pay to win in the game so idk why they would put pay to lose.
---
because they perform better than you in this on particular map and need someone to blame for a loss...i think that's basically it. Of course some people just like to be assholes I guess.
---
most people don't get that siege is also a lot about timing and you will have good and bad matches no matter how hard you try.
---
well most streamers take up more space with their face cams.  Its honestly not that big compared to most twitch stream overlays
---
It might be man. People seem to enjoy belittling everyone in like I‚Äôd say 85% of my games
---
They don't, it was a glitch
---
Lol i saw this happen today, everyone in my match was all ‚Äúnot Florida man! He never does anything wrong!‚Äù
---
To be fair I did say my ideas wouldn‚Äôt be so good
---
Dafuq why is pulse on the attacker team?
---
Also I didn‚Äôt play the update yet so no need to judge
---
Left: when a girl has the big O
---
Right: her face when you ghost her.
---
He is fine the way he is . He works great as a Ying and blitz and ash counter.
---
The meta is...like onions!
---
"They stink?"
---
Yes. No!
---
Can we not do the MP5? Maybe the P90? Let‚Äôs be honest the MP5 is the only reason he‚Äôd be played
---
Lucky üò≠
---
Yeah it's really not easy to fix. The devs would've fixed it a long time ago if there was a viable solution.
---
Ahh, right on mate.
---
Proof pls
---
im trying to buy r6 credits with steam wallet, it doesn't let me
---
i've tried running everything as admin, but didnt work
---
anyone knows any clue?

I think they are all great cosmetics and I think frost is based on some form of the devil
---
Need disk
---
Idk man, attacking team is made of all the trackers cuz they‚Äôre supposed to exterminate the zombies
---
Super Shotty ACOG
---
Third homie got yeeted
---
Yeah its a very crude drawing but easiest way to understand what it does immediately. And yeah, the pistol can be changed to anything actually, but just giving a general idea what this operator has!
---
saw this too
---
A bunch of seemingly random clips; over edited; probably copyrighted music. How is this better than anything else out there?
---
I see
---
Elo gains like never before
---
Not saying its better; it's just a start
---
Can have it stay on the operator for 2-3 seconds but its permanent so could affect your teammate thinking the operator is still roaming but long gone.
---
Came here looking for this. Thank you!!
---
i got a smoke 4k with the gas, i had some help from help as well.
---
Well it's kinda hard when your hyped about the event plus high af on gfuel
---
That's the reason why I said criticism and suggestions were welcome
---
Wasnt the first one like this too?
---
How about a maestro cam? And jackal can scan but this operator can't!
---
Get the Halloween packs since they're for a limited time only and no way to get them later.
---
yessir
---
rofl. Immediately makes this crappy event 1000% better.
---
Thank you! Kudos to my friend!
---
Oh, I didn't think of the devil for some reason well... Which cosmetic is your favorite?
---
they dont return, stop asking, nothing returns
---
Oh this is a cool idea too! Reverse smoke on the offence, or more like Ela.
---
Yeah I know man what a dweeb. Needs a vibe check
---
I do not believe they will return, though if Ubi decides they could bring them back. Very unlikely, but not out of the realm of possibility.
---
[removed]
---
Epic already done that with fortnite lmao
---
Did not know it was called that. Thanks, triggered stranger
---
Frankly I love this charm, but I‚Äôve seen a lot of people shit talking it.
---
Serious. They aren‚Äôt coming back
---
Ubisoft can then sell different colored paintballs for r6 credits. LOL
---
r/ThanksIHateIt
---
Those are criticisms. Want suggestions? Longer clips with context, don't use the same transitions over and over, do something different or better to make yourself stand out from the rest of the people doing this
---
That was spooky
---
Auto pick?
---
Groovy...
---
Looks phenomenal but needs more J√§ger üòé
---
Looked like Mortal Kombat when you uppercut someone to another map üòÇ
---
Did 2 people somehow chance into recruit, or is there a separate bug?
---
I really like the lesion and smoke since the helmet and mouth move around
---
Isn‚Äôt the sledge bundle limited time I‚Äôm not much of a gambler and I‚Äôm not very luck my two free packs I got a Shitty charm and a decent charm
---
I want Bone\_Man\_2 to bone me  üòç
---
Ash wasn‚Äôt enough already? And Lesion makes it extra ‚Äútoxic‚Äù :P
---
It was complete dumb luck
---
Dude it‚Äôs hide and seek. The heck are you expecting exactly?
---
For some reason I thought it said umbrella.
---
I don‚Äôt get the joke.
---
Can you explain it for me please
---
I‚Äôm
---
Joking
---
No shes been there since bo3
---
I think that character was from B03, which came out a couple months before Siege. So it depends on who drew the character first
---
Smonk is the poison upgrade and he shoots beauties out
---
muted
---
ur dumb ahahahh xdddddddddddddddddddd
---
Well what else could I do differently; I just started with siege videos so I dont really know what to do. And it is a random clip compilation, so it was meant to be a little random. The majority of my videos are made for me and my friends; I'm not looking to get famous on youtube, it's just a fun thing to do when I'm feeling down or lonely. It's an escape and I would enjoy to make it better and maybe even make it more than just a little thing.
---
lol csgo reference i mute people XD now i cant hear you because you said something CRINGE
---
Oh I thought he killed the whole other team
---
Where the electric chair is on theme park
---
I agree
---
My mistake then
---
Ah yes, copyrighting a girl in a hoodie
---
Pizza *de* pasta
---
Ash and J√§ger are considered really toxic operators to play (I‚Äôm not sure why really, that just seems to be the consensus.) and while Lesion isn‚Äôt a toxic operator, his mines are literally poisonous.
---
Edit: Oh cool, edit your comment after I post the reply, and don‚Äôt mark it. Neat.
---
Please tell me how to get the old Halloween skins I beg please
---
It was my mistake then. Sorry.
---
Totally agree, but the chance of going against blitz and ying. You as blitz main, how many time have you encounter Warden? The ratio may be over 1/20 game? Or even more. Maybe this new update the ratio may increase due to the buff and we will need to recalculate on that. What if after the buff and weeks later? 
---
As for Ash or anyone flash you could just look away for literally a sec to avoid it any operator could do that. And practically speaking usually people 2nd flash only rush the room so it avoidable.
---
Yeah need tweaks for sure! We're not game designers but more like fans who like to think about fun(funny) things for siege. And this was way to fun not to share!
---
I can‚Äôt picture it either lol
---
I don‚Äôt get the joke can you please explain it for me.
---
Have you not played the new Halloween event?
---
then probably not sadly, u can still try though
---
Of fucking course it is smoke. Like could they not do this to any other op.
---
Its a new assault bullpup! [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BR18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BR18)
---
It‚Äôs so good, I highly recommend it
---
I did the same and got Kapkans uniform and headgear and then Bandit's uniform
---
J√§ger in Ranked.  
---
Ash is prob much higher pick in das than ranked.
---
They are with the alpha packs just have to click on the alpha pack tab then go onto the next tab in there.
---
Where do you think the rainbow in rainbow 6 come from?!
---
But what's the point of shooting paint on a camera when I can just shoot the camera? I guess it's still help for bulletproof cams and maestro, but otherwise seems pointless against cams.
---
I fucking hate charms.
---
But it looks like shit.
---
How humble
---
Execute order 66
---
Anyhow, I recommend playing the event as soon as possible. Really fun imo
---
I'm really looking forward to the R6 Bad Dragon collection.

Until defense when two of the other guys were just memeing with the deagle and 1 tapping only but it was fine by me I was going to lose anyways.

Was thinking of maestro, or the bulletproof cams that you can't destroy immediately. And the paint thing could be tweak definitely depending on the game designers!

Report for griefing. Simple
---
Thank you sir
---
Why thank you
---
Its kinda off topic, but im the only one who thinks that should be mira and jackal the ones who get those skins, i mean, money heist is an spanish series
---
run as administrator? ubisoft support?

Limiting the number of pallets could work too. Or a dropoff rate making hard to hit moving far targets!

Character cards and drone skins for more cosmetics

Then maybe I misunderstood it. I clicked square on the icon to look at the info and it made it seem like there were different game modes.

Just camp the stairs near Attacker's entrance and put layers of traps on them. Place Kappy traps to stop the flanks.
---
Pacs
---

---
That's definitely what its alluding to
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs what we was saying in the title
---
Not really. You're like the rich kid at school that only likes designer brand
---
I dont think it's been buffed, rather the values were corrected to what they're supposed to be. Example, Gridlocks F90 is like 40-50? rpm faster than what the stats say.
---
I‚Äôve tried killing the game and relaunching it multiple times, but nothing seems to be fixing it
---
Best troll op yet for both friendly and opponents?
---
This happened in my match on attack, he died right away though so not much help
---
Safe to assume you aced?
---
That would be, sadly, false.
---
Same lol first to die though :(
---
yeah i said "idk know" got anything else to say?
---
In the game it looks bad but you got the shading perfect, good work!
---
Welp, looks like you gotta shoot up the ubisoft offices... only solution :/

---
‚ÄúHey guys so y‚Äôall dress up like this all the time it‚Äôs my first day?‚Äù
---
Put all the traps together they work way better together
---
That's why you are very careful with your canisters. The more time you waste the better. On the last canister use it outside the door, if there are more than 2 alive you need to turn invisible and run away while you can. This may distract some of the attackers and it'll let your mates have a chance to make a run for it since the attackers cannot body block the door. This is where the fun begins. Hopefully you've made it to 50 seconds left then you'll have a decent chance, 40 seconds even better and you get the picture. If you have a roamer at some point before smoke runs out you'll have a better chance of success, although it's tough having that roamers stay alive, normally it'd be kapkan since he's more of use outside the objective room.
---
Edit: the top priority attackers to kill off first is pulse, then jackal, and lastly lion. If there are no pulse left then you are almost guaranteed victory.

---
Me too... me too

***When you take a game of Hide and Seek too far***
---
Anyone else not find this mode fun at all? Not hating. I appreciate the content. But this is pretty boring
---
K you want one you got it. Give me a minute to start up the game
---
Youre the only one buddy
---
We my friend‚ò≠
---
That's why bandit is ok with torture, smoke has his canister. A Singaporean op has to break a law!
---
Honestly, that's the truth. The community made up this dumb VR theory that doesn't make sense.
---
Honestly, having everyone go the same attacker works for all 3 of them. However, defense isn't quite as hard as it seems.

I would do all loin or jackal

I like the flower one I just ended up getting the stupid rat one

ngl skins are pretty wack this year, last years were soooooooo good, but im glad we can buy packs with renown now, would love infected finka to come back
---
Back then when 48 bullets in the reserve is all you needed
---
I'd rather it died than have whatever it is now. Its plagued by ubisoft not catering to all of their players and only the "pros" really hope they start listening to EVERYONE. Hopefully the game will go back to being fun and competitive instead of boring, constantly being nerfed, and a sweat fest.
---
Thanks
---
Is that your ps4 making that noise or is it a lawnmower?
---
Thanks, I can actually picture it now
---
Dude the PS4 is a lawnmower
---
RTX on
---
no you didn't
---
She shines the most when you KNOW the enemy team is reliant on cams and bring multiple cam Defenders. It‚Äôs one reason why she‚Äôs actually being picked in pro leagues since they have Reveal and 6th Pick for Nokk to be used to counter specific situations.
---
The rest of us though, we don‚Äôt know what the enemy team will bring. Picking other attackers with much more firepower and utility to help out the team is more reliable thing to do while picking Nokk can easily be a gamble if not careful.
---
Doc raided Area 51
---
That or animation cancel out of deploying traps, though that's probably not possible with the engine
---
had a game where the attackers played all prowler.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
legit just sat in a corner the whole round and won.
---
All I want is Kapkan's headgear too. I didn't get it in my free packs so I am probably going to buy some with my saved up renown. It might be cool to have the uniform too though. I did get lesions headgear though, so I was lucky.
---
Me and my 5 stack perfectly orchestrated our ee1ds to go off one after another
---
In what way is that toggling
---
The pulse should only work when they have their ability on.
---
nO that was such a shitty system
---
Can't you just be happy instead of the unhappy gamer model?
---
what bothers me is that there are still people who don't know this
---
C
---
Still nullifys the hide part
---
I Would be Pissed as an attacker üòÇ
---
Waiting a bit more is an option if you don‚Äôt really need either of them.
---
There‚Äôs a chance of Nokk receiving some adjustments so maybe you can wait and see if she gets any buff before buying her. 
---
But then if you don‚Äôt really need Goyo, there‚Äôs no reason to not get Nokk since the next season is far away and you can get enough renown for the next two operators by then.
---
Client side debris, upside down rappel, sound, give bandit back his 3 barbed wire

[If thats what you want, you'll love the topaz skin.](https://m.imgur.com/a/rimHSlB)
---
Why? Ubisoft is pretty bad with doing scummy stuff. Look at what they did to Ghost Recon
---
I downloaded red dead redemption 2 again and it made that sound so I just deleted it cause that doesn‚Äôt sound good. You should get your cleaned out cause it would end up overheating in the long run
---
This only works on some games mind, not all.
---
Something about the word bonked just makes me smile
---
Yea my PlayStation does that when I ay taxing games for a few hours. As soon as I take a break and am sitting in lobby it stops. You'll notice not all my videos do that
---
I have kapkans pro league uniform and it looks good with it
---
What is this skin from? It's fucking badass!
---
It‚Äôs freaky in the MVP animation because at has the wobbling physics
---
Pretty common angle
---
Thank you lol
---
Wiggle wiggle
---
Bruh lmfao
---
if you spawn in daycare or drug, put your first set of traps on the front door pretty much a guaranteed kill
---
One is a cute plant, the other is a horrific monster I don't ever want to lay eyes on
---
Take my upvote damnit
---
It's what the peashooters from the zombotany levels look like

S6ipher x Samo on youtube subscribe to me you wont be  disappointed
---
Checks out.
---
Yeah, i know. But we need those in siege
---
Really the game is not free its paid and there are already a fuck ton of monetization the only option left is a monthly sub
---
I believe it's called the Bounty Hunter bundle. I saw it in the news thing in the bottom left of the menu. It's got a steep price though
---
I just hear the Mos Eisley Cantina theme when I see that headgear.
---
Shit, for 1 operator set or single article of clothing?
---
Not much, they both look like they would give some bomb-ass head
---
imma check it out later, thanks
---
I can't stop laughing at this
---
Lovely
---
Wait is this real? Can I buy it with renown and then sell for r6 credits any time??
---
R6s has one of the best sound engines in the fps market atm. Yes it has issues once in a while but generally works fine. You just need to learn how the sound works in this game. 
---
Matchmaking works as long as people are not using smurf accounts to fuck around or boost. 
---
Cheaters are banned everyday, its always going to be a cat&amp;mouse game. 
---
Learn to play against the operator that has 4+ direct counters. Clash has a pick and win rate of a dead fish. 
---
The rank map pool, Blitz, Shields, Ash, Twitch, Capitao, Glaz, Map buffs are all due to community requests. 
---
Movement _ any particular examples
---
Cav as an elf is good knowing she‚Äôs the smallest operator (155 cm)
---
Any Donation eh? ü§®
---
I spent my 50k renown on 4 packs and got  1 charm and 3 masks (frost, bandit, doc)
---
3 lions and 2 pulse for me, incase one of them dies y'know

Seems legit

Damn, good to know.  I was pulling all my credits hoping for that as I main lesion.  Now I don't know.
---
Ok? The game is $20 and all you can buy are charms and skins. Get over it.
---
Okay. What a great addition to this discussion.
---
So you injured her, but then when you shot her ir said kill and not confirmed kill, hmmmmmmm
---
Oh oops lol
---
Activate: Helicopter Mode
---
There is none
---
THERE IS NO VICTORY
---
The fact that nobody pointed out the username lf kapkan makes me very disappointed
---
The website for it has been dead for a long time tho :/
---
Kill it
---
They're the same picture.
---
Ohh haha I gotcha
---
That destroys the whole game mode :D
---
Fml, I spent 480k renown on alpha packs
---
I like the jiggle physics on his snout. You can almost slap it and have it wobble in your face hehehehe
---
I blew 37.5 k renown on three packs. I then got the 2 free ones.
---
4 charms. And Kap's headgear. I'm livid.
---
I'm on PS4 and am always up for just having fun in Siege. The people are pretty toxic tho :*)
---
Why are they just running into the gas?... oh, yes, it is a casual game mode...
---
Nice brodie
---
"A couple months late..." WTF do u mean??
---
Try starting a live chat with a support operator. That may be the easy way out of your problem.
---
Sadly
---
Till Pulse comes along
---
You said sweat and have fun sweat is when you try hard and I don‚Äôt think a silver 4 can try hard that well
---
*Han Solo intensifies*
---
That‚Äôs gonna be a no dawg.
---
That‚Äôs like blaming a casino you blew your life savings...in the arcade section
---
I got this a while back, at first I didn‚Äôt like it but it‚Äôs grown on me
---
Just saying plus you gonna have fun because this game mode got no guns so we can finally play with out sweats
---
*bonk*
---
It‚Äôs honestly genius
---
It's not green
---
Lets talk bout clash counters, I hated clash aswell until these things got into my head:
---
Capita√≤'s fire bolt can burn clash (I actually did it once)
---
Gridlock's spikes can spike clash,
---
Zofia,
---
Or simply getting behind her and shooting.
---
I got 2 charms :(
---
I'm lvl 174 and didn't get at least one legendary skin.

Hey hey, respect the console players please.

I have seen another Post with hibana wearing a bank robber costume and that guy Said its maybe for an event (Special hostage?) only on bank.

One has their whole life in front of them dreams and all the hope in the world and the other one had 3 kids and a wife he has been with for 60 years and no dreams or hope.

As a scout main I would like to take your statement and nuke it from orbit please.

All I want is the maps in custom so I can calmly find Easter eggs / explore changes.

Lol I never noticed that

You need to bait attackers into traps lol

Let her practice.

Good thing it's a fun themed limited time game mode. Jesus man
---
Yea but its so goddamn easier on offense.
---
North east corner 1st floor as the other guy said in some other comment
---
if you're gonna do this trick you have to reinforce the 3 walls in the room and you're good to go
---
I've actually won quite a lot of defense rounds, smart use of your invis/sprint and proper use of recharging gadgets is no joke, I can waste so much of the attackers time as ela using like 12 concussion nades per round
---
Nice!
---
I say Kapkan isn‚Äôt doing his job then
---
Oh jeez
---
All the skins have this weird Uncanny joggle
---
good ol tippman 98
---
ü§£
---
I don‚Äôt think I follow
---
He doesn't if you don't play him like I.
---
Nice ü§£
---
Kapkan gun skin and smokes headgear
---
I have the same thing but for doc! It looks so cool
---
The good old days
---
Defence is way easier to combo, smoke people that are poisoned by a Lesion or Stunned by Ellw, it‚Äôs a lot of dmg. Just don‚Äôt stay in a corner and get ambushed by Pulse.
---
Play by yourself and have no comms and let‚Äôs see how far you get. Guarantee you‚Äôll sweat lmfao
---
What, you didn't like Mr Bear?
---
You're right. I'll stick with more useful lines like "ubisoft bad we hate them".
---
Come back when you're not 12 years old.
---
This event was a total flop, there‚Äôs no way it made it past play testing. The skins are nice but as always there‚Äôs so much filler in the packs that you pretty much have to spend money to get what you want (nothing wrong just would like to get atleast 1 or 2 free high quality items without having to spend money). As you stated, playing against a team who have any idea of what they are doing will make the hiding part obsolete and ultimately devolves into defenders camping in a room
---
What really.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ.
---
IT'S COSMETIC.
---
C-O-S-M-E-T-I-C
---
If you think it's overpriced you don't buy it.
---
They added the possibility to buy packs with renown and you guys still complain.
---
At least say what you really want, free things without any effort.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize that. Where did he post?
---
Play with a team and get everyone to run the bunker strat on defense ( reinforce small room and deploy all defenses)
---
Well, to be fair it's also entirely possible to get the kill. They are just bad and didn't communicate that he's prone so they all run in and swing above him and miss because he's invisible. Running in is actually the right thing to do, they just need to... Aim lower, lol.
---
How do you counter that? I encountered this last night, we didn't rush in but waited patiently outside but they just keep coming endlessly.
---
Or, It could be dead or zombie Ela, revived and she's wearing her own skin that Zofia took from her by skinning her.
---
What made you bring that up only 40 days later?
---
Uh I had to life mate
---
I mean, to be fair, who has time to explore it?
---
Idk defense is pretty easy if you actually coordinate as a team. I only ever lose defense when a couple dickhead teammates decide to go wander aimlessly around the map. Little hint: you get one reinforcement each, and you should definitely use it to force the attackers into trapped entryways.
---
Sooo siege now has jiggle physics
---
truly
---
She could have lemon pledge that makes the attackers slip and fall over.
---
Might as well learn keyboard and mouse, I used to be like you but trust me once you practice enough the muscle memory kicks in and you‚Äôll be doing much better than you ever did with controller
---
Aren‚Äôt all legacy ops unlocked now for everyone?
---
Have you checked in-game yet?
---
Lmfao ‚ÄúfAnTasTiC.‚Äù
---
Love how ela starts to panic as soon as you destroy the mat XD
---
Also the round starts in like 5 seconds so the footprints are somewhat fresh for jackals to track you to your hiding spot
---
jesus christ lmao.
---
Wait till you find out Lion can scan in prep phase.
---
Well he's gonna yeet everyone
---
And the counter operator could be a Splatoon inkling
---
People who are trash at the game be like
---
Too busy smashing the barrels.
---
Ubi: Okay so there's this attacker
---
Playtesters: okay
---
Ubi: and he can see your heart through walls
---
Playtesters: *sweats*
---
Ubi: and he can shoot through the wall to kill you instantly because headshots are one shot in this game
---
Most attackers are completely obsessed by rushing you, it's actually easy to lure them in traps.
---
how did you recorded this ?
---
Pulse Mains: "Finally something for me!"
---
honestly no, but on ubisoft support it states ‚ÄúLegaxy Operators can be unlocked with 1000 renown‚Äù
---
Dont play it then , its hide and seek "iTs pASsiVe and aNtI FuN" ur a moron its a fun gamemode.
---
Because why would anyone do that?
---
Its actually Zof‚Äôs in Ela‚Äôs skin and using her gun. Also, Twitch is getting a nerf lol
---
That objective though ;)
---
We use 2 lion, 2 pulse and a jackal. Ez clap
---
Frost Super 90 skin
---
Smoke headgear (love it)
---
Doc headgear
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like ACOGs...
---
Well now im not goong to sleep
---
What did they buff?
---
RECRUIT OP LMAO
---
Deluxe its worth it! Unles u like grinding renowned for a week just to get one op
---
I'll trade u kapkan weapon skin and the skull charm for smonk hed...
---
Yeah no shit
---
I'm just saying it to the people here. All of us here rage when someone uses glitches to secure meaningless ranks. When opportunity strikes us maybe we should do something to show that we are different than those other glitchers.
---
Literally, a fortnight
---
Inb4 Simon Viklund soundtrack for event
---
Ty:)
---
i made ace with frost it was a lot of fun
---
A random group and i found, having 3 lions and 2 pulses is a grest combo. Having the 3 lions allows you ti be scanning pretty much all round, which catches/stops any runners. Then the oukses go in and find all the actual hiding people. They call out the location and one or two of the lions pushes them. Then on defense best thing is to get 4 people unti one room and distract while another hides across map and doesnt move. Not 100% starts but they worked well enough to get me the 13 winns i needed
---
The disgusting smoke headgear :(((

ofcourse it is.
---
But that‚Äôs not a game breaking glitch, and you even said by accident so why would they throw
---
I want it just cuz I have the uniform
---
game ended at its finest.
---
Sounds like a mix Friday the 13th and They Live, not sure if that helps

I'm on Xbox but only cause i can't afford  a PC

---
I can hear shitty flute
---
The test server build that came out in August had all these files included. Its early data for the new elite sets being worked on. Siege development team usually is atleast 6  months (if not more) ahead in terms of content plans.
---
they were originally from the planet as well. Who gave you the rights to determine its not their planet as well?
---
&lt;3 that satisfying finish
---
With the new halloween event update they made him 2 speed instead of 1.
---
Madlad
---
Is the mode any good?
---
Which bundle
---
Shit happens, its not possible. I wanted to view the bundle contents by looking in sledge headgear uniform section etc and realised its purchasable in a bundle only, just like the new halloween seasonal skin.
---
Holy shitten, that‚Äôs extra spooky
---
How the tables have turned. We brought the 5v5 to 5v1 while defending.
---
It won't necessarily be throwing as knifing might atleast take one attacker out and even if its accident, what do you do when a cheater accidentally joins your team?
---
No it wasn't. It's a known visual bug that it only happens in the killcam since the game came out.
---
Just an error in the description. Nothing to see here mr tin foil hat.
---
no
---
Its just a fresh installation of the game..
---
Hold on while I dig up the recording
---
I know, right. I want to get the Bandit, Kapkan and Smoke, but I'm not gonna fucking buy them out of lootboxes because they put garbage filler in them
---
Would of hated to be on the other side, I wish you played the whole round lol
---
But getting recruit is nowhere close to as bad as getting a cheater
---
Oh. Well if makes sense, hes only wearing a tactical plate carrier.
---
You can do mistook too
---
But pulse can find you from half a map away!
---
They are not zombies. Doc shocked them so their heart started working i guess
---
Yes. He‚Äôs perfect now. I mean he cant be a 3 speed since he runs around with his Guns so swaggy. But when he got releases and was a 1 speed he was almost unusable. Him and smoke make a good combo too
---
Makes sense, he can see through that stuff after all.
---
Best strategy is to fight them. We just 5 group and go to the toilet near daycare. We set up traps and kill them from there with smokes
---
Yeah but I only have 9k and like 1/3rd if the operators. So I'll be saving to unlock Ela
---
I have le money
---
I require le time
---
I got Bandit‚Äôs uniform!
---
It's a blast
---
I heard you human are allergic to tema, that‚Äôs ok I understand, cause Tem is also allergic to Tems too.
---
you can change to Advanced gadget deployment in the settings to cancel out of trap placement, it's been in the game for years
---
you get a team and..do it
---
Obviously....where do I go after that?
---
OmG dId SoMeOnE sAy FoRtNiTe?
---
I also cannot find anything for Comp Cups, only GO4s
---
For someone with as bad aim as I have I find this new mode very fun.
---
You can shoot them!
---
Well i like his masküòÖüòÇ
---
Baiting with kapkan is so satisfying. Two entry denial and they're done.
---
Pulse
---
If they brought a pulse that isn't bad I disagree every team needs one pulse and one or two jackals and two to three lions
---
rella rella rella rella rella rella rella
---
Hehehehe
---
Kapkans suit and elas skin suit
---
Don‚Äôt forget using Kapkan or smoke on the main door at the beginning of a round, they all rush in like idiots
---
I ran into two gu mines and they are invisible anyway so I haven‚Äôt noticed a disadvantage
---
Oh right, I bought the game a bit a go and got them all unlocked. If I'm wrong my bad
---
I mean if you had the game spoiled by this, there was a spoiler alert on the post beforehand.
---
People want cosmetics. The most realistic way of earning them quickly is through playing this mode.

not 100% sure about the "bomb vanilla" cup stuff but there's go4's every sunday and if you actually want to try to go pro, you play in the challenger league qualifiers first and get past that(which I think ended recently)
---
Imagine if it was someone super good like shroud, Macie Jay.
---
Aye thanks dude. For reals tho we need a counter-cav op.
---
I think the main problem is if your enemy team is very coordinate and/or you solo queue the mode, it can be very tough on you. Player the mode for like 2 hours with my good friends and we had a blast dicking around the whole time. I guess you just have to find the humor in fooling your enemies.
---
(Im only lvl 61)i dont think you can buy em
---
I am scared of no man. But that ... thing, it scares me.
---
Wow should be reported for TOXIC behaviour
---
You can‚Äôt you have to get lucky from the alpha packs
---
Well most gadgets 8n Siege doesn't exist soo....
---
I'd call that a dirty ace.
---
Cop a week long booster, see where you're at with it, then react accordingly
---
What is this new mode?
---
I‚Äôm not debating that lol. I‚Äôm saying it doesn‚Äôt exist so don‚Äôt go around saying it‚Äôs real.
---
Well yes but you have to consider that smonk is the only one who does a solid amount of damage
---
Me likie
---
People don't use R6Maps to learn the maps, they use them to draw out strats as you can drag and place icons for Operator logos, gadgets and indicators for where rotations and reinforcements are to be placed. They are a huge help to many people, especially teams that are just starting to scrim together.
---
This would be nice to see.

well I've played a lot of MNK games like CSGO and such so it was pretty easy to get the hang of it, im still kinda slow in most situations but thats just because i am a bit slow, but if youre fresh into PC gaming it might be a bit hard, good luck man

Hit reg you say, huh.

Reminds me of a game we're all familiar with..
---
I‚Äôd say defending is easier. With all the traps if you play it right it‚Äôs not that hard to win.

holy shit!

whats an example of ubisoft only listening to pros and it having a negative effect for everyone else? im genuinely curious
---
Legit who cares. If you get mad at "ez" just mute them.
---
I've lost more rounds attacking, running around like idiots looking for the last defender hiding in a corner.
---
This game mode is absolutely hilarious had me and the boys were cracking up like crazy last night.
---
Who says they're dead? Could be mutants or some other kind of creature?
---
I played other games on pc so it wasn‚Äôt that hard. My aim is better on pc, but it takes a while to get the hang of the controls (crouching, using gadgets etc..)
---
If you don‚Äôt feel at ease change the key binds
---
Cool thanks!
---
Same way you balance normal siege. They have control over everything. Time, operators, abilities, map. It's not like there's anything set in stone that they had to do and something that couldn't be balanced. My kneejerk suggestion would be pulse only and make his ability on cooldown like cav but remove defender invisibility. I imagine ubi should have had more than a few minutes to think this mode through.
---
It's only a scratch!
---
Who says attack is OP?
---
I dare you to come get me!---OH SHIT
---
I don‚Äôt think you noticed the sarcasm as half the posts are funny tachanka hahhahahah
---
Hahahahahaha Tachanka is still de very funney thing. Stop.
---
No , along many other idiots including you still believe that these events are behind a paywall. BUT GUESS WHAT ! YOU CAN NOW BUY THEM WITH RENOWN SO SHUT THE FUCK UP
---
no u
---
Same with plat on ps4... in ranked.
---
*Happiness noise*
---
Reverse card
---
Yeah paying ¬£50 on the full set is basically the full price of the game. That's totally fine
---
I have a tip for the defenders, wait until the timer hits 21 seconds and then use your boosts, if you still have 3 at the 20 second mark just spam your g key and run. ez win
---
&gt;lootboxes
---
That's literally what these packs are. Just cause they aren't a literal "box", doesn't mean they aren't lootboxes.
---
But there‚Äôs only 26 or so packs
---
Ubi just wants money, and some people don't want event alpha packs.
---
Looks good !
---
I got a 4k with Kapkan traps alone on this game mode.
---
/s
---
K den imo gridlock is better for that but I see your point
---
especially when you get mr.smiley
---
She's solid. Literally as well. And hella more balanced. But a solo queuers will benefit from nomad more than Gridlock.
---
Yeah but they should atleast give people options who don't have all the operators or 300k renown spared and maybe make the price lower or add more challeneges
---
Honestly
---
K
---
You're over thinking it. This is one round. Enemy team was probably shocked and laughing.
---
Siege doesn't have shit on what I experienced in that game. I don't remember it even being that bad in the beta.
---
You have to go to the homepage of the sub , click the 3dots , go to change user flare , pick one , then pres edit , then you use ‚Äú:charactername:kayeet‚Äù obviously you put real characters and you can put a max of 5
---
Caveria should've been the witch lady hiding from scans.
---
The only complaint I agree with is not being able to but the past events cosmetics, because I was hoping to be able to geht the J√§ger head gear from last year, but then it turns out that you just don‚Äôt have the chance to get them at all. Other than that, the way they handled it this year is much better.
---
Well it's casual sooo...
---
Its not funny any more. It's like an overused joke that just isnt funny anymore because it's been told so many times
---
But there‚Äôs only 26 or so packs, you get one from the challenge and you can buy them with renown now so it‚Äôs not behind a pay wall
---
Have you ever sniped someone with a p10 roni tho?
---
Like I commend anybody who can get an interrogation without the player leaving.
---
I got this and a charm from the 2 packs, and I can say that when paired with the pink leopard uniform, it looks like straight out of a horror movie
---
Which room is this
---
Yeah I agree it‚Äôs sad that you don‚Äôt have the J√§ger but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚Äûlimited time event‚Äú.
---
Someone else got Warden
---
Is there a new exclusively melee weapon? Can you punch and kick and throw people? If so, I would play the fecies out of that
---
Happy cake day

I suppose I have two weeks as well. So I'ma be playing the shit out of R6. Wonder if I can get 350K lmao
---
GRABBY HANDS - BEST WEAPON!
---
Bullet-proof cams, maestro cams, the new shields, there are definitely some (relatively) indestuctible items that could do with some counterplay. 
---
I am still worried that its use is too specific. Perhaps some general use like being able to fire it at the floor to create spund cues when people walk through it?
---
some of you guys are cool, don't come to Castle tomorrow
---
Yesterday i made a juicy kapkan 5k, just place 1 trap on the big entry window (i hit all 5 attackers) 
---
Then just some in rooms you are roaming. 
---
Thats absolutely fun.
---
Ela should team with smoke, kapkan solo, frost with lesion
---
The amount of luck here is bigger than Burj Kalifa and Mount Everest combined.
---
She's isn't useless i know. I over exaggerated.  But compared to what her team mates and the enemy can do,  she's useless to the team unless you can get a kill like you said. I am an Ela main. Have been one since only god remembers. But I'm not going to blow over the fact how unviable she really has become.
---
What are you even trying to say?
---
I got 2 charms and 2 skins
---
The killer mood
---
I love reading these after the fact, because the person asking always has their new flair so you know it's all gonna work out in the end
---
Yes epic gamer moment
---
I disagree. Bc if there would be more challenges or the packs would be cheaper they wouldn‚Äôt gain that much money. Rainbow six only will be development much further if it generates cashflow. Otherwise at a certain point ubi will shut it down. And i love Rainbow too much to get it shut down. So ofcourse it‚Äôs expensive and i would like them to handle it so you can choose what skins you buy and not gamble but I also see were this is coming from
---
Just get your entire team in toilet/control room, frost trap windows and use smoke to keep barricading tbe door way for more time
---
Use last smoke canister to escape too
---
Blitz has that
---
Does it stop my love for this fucking tank of a man

But without a headshot?

Well, I guess the recent Blizzard crisis doesnt help it either.

I am sorry If I offended you but I am really new to reddit and thought this was a cool joke

holy shit this is beyond cringe.

It's 10 seconds left until round ends, you're the last one on defense side against 5 these boyos, and suddenly, you hear 5 EE-ONE-Ds, as well some worrying footsteps, increasingly becoming louder and louder...

yeah.. real quirky

No? Why? It's not supposed to be a balanced game mode. Plus, I'm winning More on defense by literally just running around.
---
Mode is fun. I'm enjoying it.
---
I use the 9mm with frost anyway, I just wanted her skins

Tachanka isn't god

He's facking cyborg

Wait that's illegal

there was new leak that it would be part of next (another) event (hostage style) in bank map.

And then the last panel is the monsters all going, "What the FUCK dude, not cool!"

It symbolizes my inner torment, trapped here by my hyphae. My struggle to pull away. My struggle to escape. But alas, to no avail.

I am not saying it is not fun or that it is supposed to be balanced, but I think the experience would be improved by this change.
---
King boo got the strap
---
Yes, yes indeed.
---
I got the frost headgear on the first Halloween aplha pack
---
Yep,¬† one of the better characters ubi has made. Too bad now all they seem to do is neglect her. At least more due to the somewhat okay event map we now know Ela's middle name starts with an E.
---
You'd actually be adding balance to the mode. While in any other case it would be fine, but in a made that's designed to be a cluster f**k of nonsense, it ruins the barbaric fun.

People camp some rooms frost may it, smoke it and put grizmot mines everywhere Kaplan the doors and they win

Naw, I think it's more sau's style to just end with that scumface of recruit with his gun but that's also an option :)
---
I don't mean to be overly blunt here, but I can absolutely guarantee you that the thing you're taking issue with here is not a problem with the Siege community. I mean, it *is*, but it's not like the same thing wouldn't happen in every single game.
---
Looks like shadows from apex legends
---
Can I give you an oof
---
hide and seek event that lets seekers :
---
1. know exact location of hiders just by looking at their footsteps for 3 seconds
---
2. compromise every hider's (even 'invisible' ones) position if they move
---
3. see hiders through the walls even if they turned 'invisibility' on
---
this is clearly not a hide and seek mode. its a 'hide in a room as 5 people and put shit ton of stuff to kill everyone that dares to get close' mode
---
Mine didn‚Äôt show up until I completed a game of hide and seek
---
AND THIS IS MY FRIEND TEMMIE
---
Aren't alpha packs currently being given out as a doctor's ( style atleast ) sort of pack, mine from the wheel all seem to look like doctors packs and give halloween themed items
---
Please keep it and bring all previous event games, including outbreak, to custom games!
---
It's fun for the guy with the gun, not so much for the rest.
---
i opened 522 and got 4x the g36c uff
---
Peashooter lookin smoke is the best.
---
I honestly thought hes kind of lookalike when I first saw him.
---
I think this is one of the better events Ubisoft has done, considering supposedly you can buy the packs with renown. (I haven‚Äôt played yet, but it looks really fun.)
---
Google the error
---
Hmm
---
Me too
---
I *poot* can‚Äôt *poot* understand *poot* your accent *poot*
---
Got no answer
---
no shit theres csgo I'm just saying people rely more on aim than their gadgets idk what you want
---
And Kapkan is laughing in the shadows, because his new headgear and uniform makes him basically invisible in dark corners.
---
Watch it someone‚Äôs gonna need that pumpkin
---
I can say it. Yes you shoudn't be complaining about this new game mode. It's free and you are getting a chance at unlocking the packs through renown, so essentially free, and the BEST PART? You don't have to even play the game mode. You can just ignore it as if this game mode never happened and go back to ranked or unranked or casual (whatever is your forte). Everything in this world can be criticized, but certain things (like this event for example) should not be criticized.
---
i opened 200 last week and only got one black ice (for glaz‚Äôs sniper)

Can you download the rest of the game?

---
The eyes are pretty bright
---
You're saying on controller people rely on aim more than they do using a mouse?
---
I have had a few jump scares already hahah
---
I mean the top comment on the original post is way better than what the other guy here.
---
This is like 50 jump scares
---
Shhhhhh. Don't say it too loud
---
Bruh I was hiding the entire round got to 3 seconds and went invisible just in time all 5 came through the door as I was running üòÇüòÇ scary shit
---
90% of the won rounds are for attackers they need cooldowns too
---
Optional free game modes that are made for fun should not be criticized or complained on at all by anyone, because first its free, second it's optional and the third and best part---&gt; You don't need to waste any R6 Credits in terms of having a chance at some of the cosmetics. I hope you understand that good sir.
---
Have a nice decay on the paint and you got a nice operator here.
---
yes because on ps4 people rely on having good aim and there is less room for customising your aim, hence people focus on mastering aim alongside positioning. If you want to carry on feel free to PM me because I don't want to make this a lengthy thread
---
Also... paint grenades. Or paint traps.
---
No all one sentence because I can üòÇ
---
Why is there a sub about perfectly cutting reams
---
You can buy it with renown
---
Not attacker sided at all. Once you learn to coordinate with defenders in voice chat, you can win both sides easily.
---
Somebody toucha ma turret
---
The fuck? I said no, that is no where close to the n word you mongoloid.
---
Better than no event at all, all cosmetic anyways
---
Yes
---
No you don't. To have the same chances to get a pack than those to get a random number on a dice (1√∑6) you have to play at least 9 matches. If you played every minute for two weeks straight you would play 2160 matches, which amount to roughly 40 packs gained. Realistically though you play for 6 hours a day (that are still a lot), which lowers the amount to 10 packs.
---
&gt;have not once
---
This is the first time they could've.   So..  you say not once,  but this is the once
---
what's with the background?
---
The amount of renown you need for just one pack is a week's effort as well, sadly.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
You still get banned for saying the n word you mongoloid. It's just manually reviewed now, and AS IS SHOULD HE. In the old system a bunch of people were auto banned for speaking their native language. Learn to mute people and grow some perspective you fuck.
---
You have just enough time to set down two frost mats at the door and run like hell at the start of the round. Have smoke or lesion toss a gadget down from above to finish them off
---
That makes zero senso whatsoever.
---
It is, but the 9mm is just so much better in gameplay.
---
9 mm is 9.51321069e-19 light years
---
I don‚Äôt mind them but jeez the amount of posts I‚Äôve seen are ridiculous
---
Nobody I know cares about Siege enough to grind for that sort of thing and I prefer playing solo regardless
---
its a smg, the one with 100 bullets
---
Because getting tracked by jackal is awful and it‚Äôs terrifying to have a pulse crash through the ceiling to kill you
---
It's HIDE and seek bud. H  I  D  E. as in when you hide. You know like under a desk or in corners and stuff
---
No lmao it‚Äôs a weapon skin
---
Wow solid logic. Do you enjoy wasting people‚Äôs time? You must be like 12
---
Because it's a trick instead of a treat
---
Or frost smook combo
---
I‚Äôve been very happy with the results of 5 pulse or 4 pulse 1 Lion. Not a 100% win rate, but probably 90-95%. On defense there are times where you only win because they don‚Äôt have a pulse
---
Gamespot did, guess they ain't right
---
Pls don‚Äôt fix exploits ubi I love ruining people‚Äôs fun
---
Game spot said it
---
‚ÄúIs that a recruit?‚Äù ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS GOT A GUN‚Äù monkey gun.jpeg

I‚Äôm pretty sure it is still buyable with either r6 or renown

I don't think so...
---
Well hello there, Mileena
---
It's just a cash grab my dude. The only high effort event was Outbreak.
---
No sorry disk only. I don't have any friends with it on their xbox, so I have no idea if this works on xbox. Only ps4 for now.
---
Make sure the room is extremely dark first

Siege name checks out

They might have forgotten to change the text from the rainbow is magic event
---
The way I see it, I bought this game for 20 bucks three years ago and for just 20 bucks I have gotten around 100 bucks worth of entertainment over the years. SO free entertainment of 80 bucks and all UBI wants us is to play the game. I love UBI as a company and I hope they keep doing what they are doing while ignoring the whiners.

Play as Kapkan, place one trap on the doorway from Drug Lab to Joint Corridor (the large door that you can see the main door in Arcade Entrance), and another in the doorway between Drug Lab and Drug Storage on the storage side. Wait in Drug Lab by the door to storage, when you see someone come in the door and set off the EDD, turn tail and run, activating shadestep (or whatever it's called). Run through Drug Storage, Arcade Toilet, Joint Corridor, and into Haunted Dining. If it's safe set up another EDD on that doorway. If not, find a location with back to back doorways you can get others to run through, like first floor Haunted Stairs/Crypt or Office Toilet. Once you have EDDs set up on both doors, try to get spotted by Lion's Scan.

From watching the sub since I posted early yesterday a lot of people are having this glitch happen so I don't think they would've.

"I LiTeRaLlY bOugHt The GaMe YoU bOot LiCkInG iMbECiLe"
---
Legit what a low IQ person without thinking would say. The game is R6 Siege of Attackers Versus Defenders with Guns and strategy with gadgets, not a free game mode they do on the side for the people that like events. So you are complaining on an aspect of the game that is not even part of the main game that you paid for. Honestly why don't you think before you talk.....imbecile.

For the low, low cost of 12.5k per pack :/ you have to grind and save for ages to afford multiple.

Yessir, you can replenish your castle barricades, it had been around but it's super situational, you might die doing it.
---
Cheers love!

Lmao
---
No I'm not. I clearly said its the same concept. Driving 3 meters and driving 100 meters all involve the same concept. A concept is a general notion, a plan or intention. If you have the intention to drive to the local grocery store, or the intention to drive across the country. It's still the same concept of DRIVING. Jesus Christ dude.

Fuck, that Frost skin actually terrifies me
---
But cant fix their connection problems. Seems logic
---
Alone, nope.
---
Just the tip
---
You US or EU?
---
US
---
Pro tip, don‚Äôt put the gu mine directly on the frost, put it a little bit further so you can get an insta kill.
---
And there arent even 5 people.. Nice.
---
Summoning one with a blood sacrifice
---
They do way more damage than usual yeah, bleed out time is also much faster. You'd need to start the swing as you're running into the gas.
---
I agree with u, the problem is mostly the community. Even the downvotes on ur comment show that perfectly.
---
Yeah it looks so good.
---
By the way, is that headgear still available?
---
I got my first ace with kap
---
Very nice! Which software are you using for this?
---
Yea, it's called "anatomical" on doc
---
&gt; No I'm not. I clearly said its the same concept. Driving 3 meters and driving 100 meters all involve the same concept. 
---
So they're exactly the same are they? These two journeys. You replied to "An entirely different scenario" with "It's not entirely different." then you decided to change, posts later, to talk about concepts...
---
&gt;If you have the intention to drive to the local grocery store, or the intention to drive across the country. It's still the same concept of DRIVING
---
And yet the two journeys are entirely different journeys despite being journeys.
---
&gt;What are you talking about? Literally the 2nd or 3rd reply I wrote to you was talking about the concept.
---
Yeah ie not where you started
---
*screams internally*
---
Nonononono.
---
#***why use mobile data***
---
Any more specific on the ritual? Would do this
---
Well they had under 1k gamerscore and the actual dia finished bottom getting carried his ass off
---
First time... to do it again... boy you‚Äôre fucking retarded
---
Dont want to seem rude, but have you managed to come up with a solution yet? I really want to play the new event with my friends...
---
R/DontStickYourDickInThat
---
We have the same cake day
---
Hopefully they end in jail. Example needs to be done.
---
Lmao I didn't say they were exactly the same. You keep repeating that even tho it isn't what I said. You need to learn the definition of concept my guy.
---
What do you mean not where I started? My entire point was that the concept was the same. 
---
You're really stubborn, and reaching so desperately for any sort of leverage. Must be sad to live like that.
---
Yeah I thought so.
---
M45 legendary - Blood Viper is above all. At least for me. But I can agree, D50 has lot of neat skins. One purple - Observer (almost full gold) is equal to legendaries in my opinion.
---
Ah I‚Äôm EU I‚Äôve been solo queuing for 2 years. Gold 2 now but for the last like 5 seasons been stuck in Elo hell in low silver and can never get out because of trash teammates tk‚Äôing and not knowing how to play the game, I‚Äôm almost scared to play now incase I drop back into silver it‚Äôs a nightmare down there.
---
***angry as fuk cat***
---
If y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt been killed by someone using this, then you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Fair, but we also have to walk the line between reality and fairness.
---
Already bought, thanks though
---
Is it time limited? Can I get it even after the event? Or is it a normal non-limited doc headgear?
---
Joke's on me, cuz none of my teammates know how to gas/Gu the frost traps.
---
Nice thank you
---
Me too &lt;3
---
It's normal :)
---
OK? Even if they're on alt accounts ... they're still literally around the same rank. LOL.
---
Guess no diamond should ever lose a game and derank back into Plat.
---
Buddy there is literally 0 reason to complain. You‚Äôre literally only whining because you want something you can‚Äôt get. Sorry video gaming isn‚Äôt for you then go play something that you can afford like Apex apparently or whatever. If you don‚Äôt like the game for what it‚Äôs doing don‚Äôt play it when it doesn‚Äôt affect the game play.
---
Brilliant! Thanks a lot.
---
I don't have time to argue with you about this anymore, I clearly made my point and you're too stubborn to accept anyone's opinion but your own, have a nice day bro.
---
Np
---
Any guesses on how long everything lasts. How long can you buy the packs. It says 18 days 21 hours on their page, is that to buy, or to just open ones already obtained? How long do the bundles usually last, until the end of the event or the season?
---
No, nobody plays Rook
---
Lol Christ you‚Äôre a moron you didn‚Äôt even read the other comment. Could care less about skins. Especially these ones. I‚Äôm beating a dead horse here and from the looks of it to a retard that can‚Äôt comprehend anything lol. Here let me say it once more there downy: Why do you, a player, of a video game, that can clearly see that a free game has a better micro transaction ecosystem as it applies to limited time events, accept that what seems to be one of your favorite games has a predatory loot box mechanic? You and I both don‚Äôt care about cosmetics so don‚Äôt argue on that point anymore it‚Äôs just stupid.  But you then think it‚Äôs ok to have that type of practice used in game? When a game that is literally free...**free bud it‚Äôs free**... has a better ecosystem to make money that‚Äôs less predatory and it‚Äôs their only source of income so no excuse for a paid game. If your tiny little mind can‚Äôt comprehend all of that^ then there is no need to engage with you lol.

Frost+Smoke=Win. Bait the attackers into frost mats kill them quickly with smoke then hide. EZ

I thought these posts were over
---
Crimsonveil Collections were limited time only available through paid packs. The 2017 halloween bundles returned that year cuz the ops were in the game mode.
---
If you save invisibility it's not a problem
---
I‚Äôm definitely not gonna try this...
---
Pulse can still scan you even if youre invisible
---
Nah fam it needs to b done
---
Wow, what bullshit. I can't stand timed exclusivity. How is this fair to newer players?
---
That's what I said...  But it's go take a free weekend to get them to try :(  
---
Even that's a stretch.
---
console.
---
Yes but you become a 6 speed that can make it across the map very fast. If you play it right you can out range his scanner.
---
yea same ! ( PC/EUW)
---
Man on suicide watch now
---
Now is your chance to get some of the items now so you can brag about it to the newbs next year :D
---
And then I get killed by the exterminators running into me
---
Alright you might be right. Jackal is always banned for me and when he's not, I use the pings to my advantage.
---
Usually FBI, either using R4C or shield w/ the USG bc the 21 rounds is OP
---
Yes they give you a free pack for the event.
---
&gt; I'm an ash and jager main
---
oh
---
Yeah
---
Glad to see that ubi are adding jiggle physics to a mask before fixing the game
---
I always had the Blood Orchid Uniform and got the headgear.
---
Thermites gun is basically identical recoil/dmg/rof
---
The shield would be a screen and the operator would have cameras on the back so the camera feed would play to the shield screen infront. Also full bulletproof but could only fpcus on one persons perspective.
---
I don't get it
---
He a pea shooter forom pvz
---
Annual exclusivity is plenty for holiday events.
---
It's my website and user name.
---
Ahh, thanks for clearing it up. And yes im so bad that im in the negatives
---
The problem with lion is that they can just hide whereas jackal and pulse force them to move around which is when they‚Äôre most vulnerable.
---
You make it sound like casual is the only game mode. Some people play cas because they want to enjoy the game without try harding in a different game mode.  You act like you can only play the game by holding angles and being passive. Some people enjoy fast paced gameplay. Also some people don‚Äôt like to watch their teammates get picked off so they join a different game where they are alive.
---
No
---
People who say that are lying to themselves and trying to get a random reason to use it. I only saw mnk users in mid to high gold too.
---
Oh that's a shame, there's some really nice skins.
---
Ya
---
You're faster and you can't be tracked
---
this is ebic but siege is 99% game sense
---
People say this everytime one comes out and it never happens
---
I doubt they‚Äôll buff the fmg (if they do it‚Äôll be a very small buff) because it would also mean a buff to smoke
---
Recording off your phone is against the guidelines.
---
Finding a job that allows for excess spending on entertainment.
---
Worst thing is this actually works
---
I got the worst one in my opinion, elas uniform
---
Nope it 60fps lock.
---
yeah, it sucks. I got my 2 free ones and got bandit and Kapkan headgear. tfw legendary when I wanted anything from ela. Painful part is this if the first time we‚Äôve been able to buy with renown and I just spent mine like 2 days ago on some alpha packs. At least the kap headgear doesn‚Äôt suck.
---
Play unranked people leave way less
---
Is there a way to send the picture to yourself without having to make a new profile?
---
You realise the dragonfly drone is bigger than a Arnies torso when he was in his prime, right? Also being able to resist a cav intero. Nah bro I don't think you relise the premise of an op. You are thinking of a very specific ability to counter just one op what does the drone do. If cav is banned the most powerful part of that op, is useless? And now Ubisoft has to come up with a flying drone asset and I am wondering just how long that will take to implement and with how shitty the connection is the majority of the time it will be lagging everywhere. Is it armed because if it is ohhhh boi peakers advantage galor. If not how do you deal with it as a defender?
---
:(

Who's that?

Yes, for whatever reason the SASR TH challenge requires 4 wins instead of 3 and gives 100r instead of 150r lol.
---
I like the hand movement btw. Looks like youre pinching them nipples.
---
Im not the type of player who try hard in casual, sometimes I don‚Äôt even use my headset so I don‚Äôt care. Some people just pick ash run in obj and dies. There‚Äôs other games like cod or battlefield for this type of fast paste gameplay. I love playing both style, if I want going in hard and fast I‚Äôm gonna play cod if I want to play more slowly and with more strategy, I‚Äôm playing siege. I really don‚Äôt know what is fun in running in dying and immediately quitting for an other game.
---
Bc I cant buy wifi where Im from and Im in the woods too
---
Lol,NolyPoly.
---
Not bullet proof or anything. 
---
Literally anything could go through like it wasn‚Äôt there. Barricade pieces, bullets, Grenades or Gadgets. 
---
It would be pure stealth feature. No protection for the Operator whatsoever when using it. And it only works while he‚Äôs stationary in crouch position. No standing or going prone while it‚Äôs active.
---
I thinks that's the point lmao
---
... well shit...
---
MnK PC ;)
---
Yeah I got a skin for the SAS shotgun and a head gear for Ela. The headgear is nice, but the skin is a bit boring.
---
Thanks.
---
There‚Äôs one bathroom 2nd floor, me and my friend go there, block both doors, reinforce the one wall and as smoke and frost we trap that room enough to make Kevin McAlister mad and when the attackers thing it‚Äôs hammer time we teach them not to bust into the bathroom when someone‚Äôs using it.
---
On the third day he rose to the 2nd floor of club house
---
Realistically.
---
They'll just give her frags or smokes.
---
Indeed...
---
Nice, I want that Frost Uni or Headgear. Got 10 packs. Legendary Lesion uni, Doc Uni, Smoke Uni, Doc headgear, Ela headgear, Frost Shotgun Skin, Bandit SMG skin, and 3 charms. Luckily I got the full Doc set. Pretty happy about that. :-D
---
ü§£ü§£
---
I suppose that could work.
---
Bought 2 packs, on second pack got the legendary headgear for lesion.
---
Gradient
---
So I found someone recommending turning off a cpu for the game, and it has stopped crashing for some reason
---
Yeah I love the caption on your user flair
---
but almost no one picks the fmg-9 on smoke so they might buff it as they want people to use the different weapons on operators. it‚Äôs why they took acog from ash (had other reasons also) and why they buffed kaids aug like 3 times
---
That argument makes no sense
---
If you can't watch your back your not a good player Jackal isn't the problem
---
That's what comes off like.
---
With Finka if people get picked early and now it's 2v4 or 2v3 and they have Finka your kinda boned
---
As well she isn't played because people don't want to play against her
---
It's a form of tacit courtesy
---
idk
---
Steve from stranger things s2
---
As far as I can tell (playing borderless myself, switched from a 60Hz to 144Hz display), the game runs in your case with 240Hz, since your display is set to this amount. It doesn't matter what's in the settings if it's in borderless.
---
Does placing a kapkan trap makes you visible again?
---
Ohh cool dude i will check out the website
---
Best not be a complaint
---
I was talking about N√∏kk with a friend of mine. Her loadout is really frustrating. I don't feel like a stealthy operator when I'm playing with her. My innocent suggestion for a new loadout:
---
- Main weapons: FMG (keep it, it's really good) and a assault rifle or something like that without a scope (maybe a 416C or a M4?).
---
- Secondary: RG15 (in my point of view it really suits N√∏kk's modern weapons style), and D50 (I'll never complain for having a Deagle :V).
---
- Gadgets: Flashbang and Breach / Smoke and Breach
---
What do you guys think?
---
Are you Italian by any chance?
---
Thank you so much!
---
Well I‚Äôm moving into to New York with a bunch of my friends who I‚Äôve been friends with since like middle school so I just won‚Äôt have lots of time nyc not cheap
---
He is to dangerous to be kept dead
---
Some people like doing that in casual. It‚Äôs not like it affects you. They left a casual match. It doesn‚Äôt affect anything after that match. Why do you care? Sorry if I‚Äôm being short tempered. I‚Äôm just annoyed at your reasoning. Because people leave a game mode called CASUAL you want a penalty on people who play the game differently than you.
---
Goddamn it
---
Hell no this is the best game mode hands down
---
Then the guys who bought the elite skins will put it in their ass
---
You're welcome :D
---
Wheres juan?
---
I want his mask oooooo
---
That shit is just foreskin with teeth
---
I lost a my only match that could have gotten me plat 3 because of echo. I will exile him until the day I die.
---
What are your computer specs?
---
No.......
---
Why ?
---
lol the shitty ignorance here never ceases to amaze me!
---
F
---
Damm your so good at art good luck and keep up the hard work : )
---
i got lucky, i had 10 packs total and i got all 3 items for kapkan
---
Ah. My bad.
---
I agree but they pick the shotgun over fmg because of the smg11 combo. I‚Äôve never had an issue using the fmg with smoke. They could buff it but smoke seems very balanced right now. I think they should give N√∏kk the mp5sd cause it suits her perfectly. The acog might be a problem but I doubt it would become one.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Alibi Is an Italian operator
---
There planing on doing that wgile there banning ddosrs
---
Ong
---
i dont even use skins. they kill just fine stock.
---
He‚Äôs talking about how bad the Ubi servers have been on pc the past few days not about getting ddossd. And by ban he means the leave penalty.
---
Resolution is as high as your monitor allows, but fov is just kind of what you feel the most comfortable with
---
its beginner friendlier (no need of map knowledge and its a straight foward counter) and requires less teamwork (clearing out roamers for vertical play or some windows maybe dont allow vertical play and you would have more time compared to capitao smoke ) . Not every operator needs to be super meta.  And for some Mira spots its simply easier and faster to advance without spending time clearing everything (villa upstairs comes to mind or consulat garage )
---
You really miss the point that even if it's an event, she still heavily unbalanced and weak. Everyone can defend themselves even when out of boost. Ela can not making her practically useless and pointless to play. You can't improvise when you're at a 100% disadvantage at all times, you can't. Stop trying to sound like you're the smartest person around who thinks they know everything. You can't brush off something being overly weak and just say it's an event improvise. You can't in any way. Saying improvise fixes nothing, nothing changes or improves. It only makes things a lot more complicated than they ever need to be.
---
Yeah i know
---
I exclusively run Gold on the D-50
---
They can be annoying I know, all she really can do is piss people off. Which in the end makes her a giant target.
---
Do you just like arguing for the sake of arguing? Try solo queuing with Ash at any rank. You will get way more use out of those breaches than some flash bangs 9 times out of 10. 
---
Buck and Ash are completely different ops.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature.
---
Right thanks what fov do u play on ?
---
Everybody gangsta till recruit gets an elite uniform
---
Im pretty much lesion main so i would love to get full lesion outfit but my only two black ice's are on frost's weapons and i like using her on unranked/casual so not complaining about the headgear! And the Doc uniform is sick!
---
How? Stuns can be used more than ADS burning too. I got to plat solo queue. I know how it works
---
Ok my bad I read your sentence as ‚Äúthere planning awhile to ban ddosrs‚Äù
---
Feel you!
---
Wat
---
Good shit! Yo what‚Äôs your PSN?
---
What? Listening to the community? Lol
---
I actually quite like it. Messing about in it and trying dumb strats like holding 1F bathroom is pretty fun if your not sweating. But I do understand that it can be a bit biased and frustrating to play defence.
---
No problem connecting but I cant find a match to save my life. Never had it this bad.
---
Thicc_Watermelon
---
Definitely not 99%. You can know everything about the game but if you cant outgun people you are gonna be stuck in silver.
---
Nice
---
Please
---
I was just thinking about that last night while playing
---
looks so cool bro well done !
---
I was just thinking about this.
---
i know right like are reading what he‚Äôs saying to me. he won‚Äôt admit he‚Äôs wrong lol.
---
It is a homework assignment.
---
But it would fit
---
Eh I've seen it get beat, all you need to do is smack the floor to break the mats, maybe someone gets hit by the kapkan, but the smokes don't last long enough.
---
and yes I play on cancer
---
\*console
---
Maybe its because half of the players cant connect and the other half doesnt find a match becauseof that
---
Got everything but I drew most of the charms last
---
:D
---
I run 1080p 74 fov. used to run 90fov but i felt too zoomed out
---
Not that guy but I play max.
---
Okay keep talking about the drone?
---
I‚Äôm done with this. There is only so many ways I can frame this without going insane over all the circles we are going in.
---
Damascus is available in alpha packs?? I thought it was only an early season pass reward for season pass 3
---
Should be like OW where you get a currency bonus for joining mid match.
---
What exactly do you expect them to do when they have no servers of their own?
---
Oh good Lord! You just can‚Äôt win.
---
You free
---
Frost is the coolest
---
When
---
sweet reflex bro
---
This idea is on the sub 3-4 times a week and people still don't get why this is a poorly executed and flawed idea.
---
6/10
---
That headgear bothers me with how bright it looks though. Still want it.
---
Ok so just find a good spot to hide and don't move during lion. I thoroughly enjoy it the only part I don't like is trying to hide from a pulse
---
8/10, wasn't a one tap
---
HOW TO DO PLEASE
---
All fun and games until you get recruit rushed in the Halloween event.
---
Conflagration it‚Äôs a dope looking skin unfort as you said it‚Äôs for the dmr
---
I‚Äôm not sure. Someone just joined as the game started
---
I use shotgun pistol most of the time. I use it with maestro to make murder holes and some crouch height rotations and with alibi to help with roaming by opening hatches. Also a very good close range option. However, the karatos is probably one of the best if not the best pistol in the game because of its range and damage. I just think the shotty pistol fits maestro and alibi better.
---
That's pretty good.... Do you take commissions?
---
You can't hind that's the thing that's really bad about it, there like no hiding at all just running it's so bad
---
Hardly.
---
thanks consoles.
---
Different damascus probably
---
Disgusting? You mean awesome?
---
Don‚Äôt own any operators on An account. Join and wait for the timer to count down. 
---
This is expensive and long as hell to do
---
&gt;  Terribly one sided
---
every one keeps saying that but my 4-stack has won evenly between defense and attack.
---
Because they were already working on a next-gen version too.
---
I'm absolutely useless at defending and I can never catch or find folk when attacking :(
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying and I agree
---
No you can hide I typically can just sit in the corner of a room and not move until pulse walks in
---
Nice you already know you're trash
---
Drone won't be armed
---
I agree, it could be interesting to do
---
There should be some Random Fuckery playlist that plays randomly all these past events (minus the outbreak since the SA is coming) :D.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put your dick in that...
---
no one can kill me cuz no one can see my leg
---
That's exactly what I was thinking
---
I ask myself this everyday. Would it help if I told you I vote to ban lesion every game? I play him if he‚Äôs available, but I‚Äôd rather he wasn‚Äôt.
---
Yes but trying to shoot at a moving target or flicking when someone is crouch peeking you definetly helps
---
Well the majority of people aren't in a stack, and I think a well coordinated attack will always beat a well coordinated defense.
---
My team usually is absolute cancer on defense. I love kapkan so much i'll be putting kapkans at unavoidable doors. If I spawn 2f or next to bathroom I'll actually kapkan the main door aswell and our lesion throws two seperated gus there. This guarantees that 1 person is removed straight away from the game because there's always at least ONE guy running main door.
---
Ela will be hidden in some obscure ass area, sometimes she's in control room sometimes she's in the closet and sometimes she's in the bathroom. Whatever it is you're not finding her until the rest of us are dead, because her Grzmots are half red herrings half acid trips.
---
Lesion will be kiting with gu mines, throwing them to kill people after my kaps have blasted them.
---
Smoke does whatever he fucking wants, the one condition is that he kills at least 1 person before dying. Or alternatively use all his smokes and nightstrides.
---
Frost does whatever she fucking wants, on no condition whatsoever. I find that people that pick Frost in this gamemode work best independently, the only reason to ask them to do something is if yall are camping but that's boring as shit.
---
Then I'll be going invisible time to time planting kapkans literally as they walk past the door so they'd die. https://imgur.com/59I5iYd
---
How do you do this? I feel like this is a hoax? Wouldnt people just convert any pack they get to R6 credits and buy elite skins and bundles and what not??
---
Is that a bug?
---
I‚Äôm really upset that Lion didn‚Äôt get a skin.. All of these skins are for defenders.. makes ya think that ubi favors the defense more than the offense
---
As I said I think what you're doing is a waste of time but that's my opinion. You're free to do whatever you want.
---
Maybe a Commissar skin from WW2?
---
If you run impacts go for the revolver, if you don't run them go for the shottie.
---
(Unless you are defending an objective which needs to open a few hatches and don't wanna waste impacts)
---
10% damage buff could make some DMRs over powered. For example, a 10% damage buff to the 417 or bucks DMR would make their damage 76, a two shot on all operators. BBs gun used to have 71 damage and it was nerfed to 61
---
Yeah you have it forever
---
The new packs aren't pay to win so your EA argument is stupid
---
 I got the frost headgear and a shit charm
---
Smonk now has fleshlite for mouth
---
r/thatsgay
---
Will it be loud, agile can other players interact with it like a pest from mozie. You need to go into more detail. A lot more detail. And 15 meters in a sphere around the op?
---
Ela is usually the last line of defense and that's just her role in this game mode. 
---
You don't roam and try to bait people with her, you find a hiding spot and slowly avoid attackers as they move around,  
---
rig the next door room and close proximity with her Grizmots to repel Pulse as you hide yourself.  Save the invisibilities if you can and start running just as the timer goes counting its last.
---
i already have an account with no ops ü•¥ü•¥
---
So true ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Even if that happens, it's still better to have a full-auto gun instead of a dmr in most cases in this game.
---
But i would put your dick in that...
---
as far as i know that‚Äôs always been a thing?
---

Thank you, I got the new smoke headgear with the Halloween event and the ember rise uniform looks exactly like the Halloween one for him.

4/10 it was just a head sweep

Cancer is more fun

So cute!!!!!

How TF do u die when u have a gun and everyone else just has a hammer?
---
How is them bending over an advantage
---
Doncha think.
---
I feel like Smoke and the Pyro from tf2 would get along pretty well.
---
I find the best comp on attack is three Ledge, one Jedge and one Pedge
---
You cant
---
Nope
---
In the event u get all the ops when u play the gamemode
---
No its an event
---
Thanks! I also started to post my drawing on Twitter (@Maud.Grc).
---
Are you sure? I‚Äôm not seeing it in the club challenges
---
My advice is for defense is balance camping and roaming, when you hear close footsteps go invisible and run. For attack just use pulse.
---
Lure them all in to 1 room, go invisible and then gas them. Most I‚Äôve killed at once so far by doing this is 3 people but it could easily be more
---
If you die on attack you are bad
---
Wow anime eyes but different wow
---
Yeah. The music really makes it feel like ST
---
If you‚Äôre salty about it just get a mnk or scuf like every other sweaty fuck on console plat 3 and higher
---
A little too ironic

Just dont do matchmaking on terrerist hunt, just lone wolf it. Problem fixed

Are you okay?...
---
Then buy them for real money? that is ubisoft's intended outcome.  I doubt they added the option to purchase them for renown out of the kindness of their hearts, but to reduce backlash from the incoming battlepass.
---
There‚Äôs only the echo birthday challenge (destroy 20 drones) to get a weapon skin and the doktors curse challenge (win 13 rounds) to get a free pack
---
Must‚Äôve been an absolute rollercoaster of emotions for that Lesion.
---
I think that‚Äôs next weeks challenge
---
Ok,you think they will?
---
if i had twitter i would follow
---
Didn‚Äôt think so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è time to grind it out then
---
I never said these skins gave advantages. I said skins do in general. And considering gambling is the only method to obtain these... yes they are.
---
They aren‚Äôt forcing me to buy them. That doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt receive criticism for it either.
---
Your dumb apologist mentality is what let‚Äôs these companies do these things. Vocal feedback gets attention of media and news which is really what these companies don‚Äôt want. Gambling shouldn‚Äôt be in these games. It preys on people with addictions and it‚Äôs disgusting. Why I‚Äôm glad governments are moving against loot boxes finally.

Yup and Even if they were included in alpha packs it would be super rare to get one because of the absurd amount of items that come out of alpha packs

According to leaks elas elite is next. Then capitao, cav (I think) and buck. Don't quote me on that tho.
---
Which I believe is unfair on the company.
---
Okay. I don‚Äôt see what that means for your point. If eSports is making money, they are going to focus on the platform that takes advantage of that the most. Console doesn‚Äôt have eSports because controller is ass, so obviously they are going to focus updates around the PC platform.
---
EDD*
---
You basing that on a comment in this post, not actual facts. Downvote again I guess
---
Nah, you're good. Take a couple upvotes. I'm just disappointed, since I was gone (family travel) that time every year prior to this year.
---
It's expensive, really it shouldn't be as they already make profit of the company selling the game on there platform when they don't have to
---
LOL you literally told me to go look at the posts on the apex sub in order to prove your point. But now that I have, and it turns out you were wrong, you‚Äôre going to backpedal and act like that‚Äôs not valid? Lmao okay, now I know you‚Äôre just retarded. Anyone with a brain can tell that Siege has had worse hitreg problems that Apex. How about your sources? You‚Äôre the one that started making claims about Apex having the worst hitreg, so where are the facts..? Oh wait, that‚Äôs a lie so there aren‚Äôt any...
---
It seems familiar to me too, what the hell?
---
Dude if I could I‚Äôd give you a gold just for that reply
---
hopefully. best of luck to you
---
That's something that youd have to talk to Microsoft and Sony about haha.  It's not easy being a dev
---
Why just use Thunts. Shooting ranges are barely helpful for your aim.
---
Of course they should I'm not saying they shouldn't though as it clearly makes sense for them to make PC there main as it's free to update I think and also is so much easier to do. Just a small TTS would be good Just fix recoil and movement on console as they both feel completely different games.
---
You need to go back to elementary school, bud. Although they might have to put you in the Special Ed class lol
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the changes to the operator screen where they do this is their practice for this. 
---
I‚Äôm sure the only thing holding them back is it already takes ages to load a game and people on potatoes will struggle even more
---
I agree I‚Äôm just telling you why it probably won‚Äôt happen. As for recoil, idek. Seems like it would be something super simple to apply to consoles only.
---
&gt; The lawsuit (thanks, TorrentFreak), filed in the Central District of California, accuses an underage Dutch hacker by the handle J.V.L. of being the "driving force" behind MizuSoft's only product, "Budget Edition Rainbow Six: Siege Cheat." It also accuses his mother, Sandra Rijken, of "collecting, processing, and transmitting" the proceeds of that cheat software's sales through her own company, Simply San Web Design.
---
Yeah, I think like maybe they should implement some kind of overwatch from csgo for trusted players and some players that have been playing since the start to analyze cases to see if they're mnk'ing or not
---
It also make sense on Sony's and Microsoft side too as they can make money faster that way
---
I had one reading it
---
Let the demon stare into your SOUL
---
Agreed just wish the game had a team to focus on the console players as they also need some love.
---
I do, drop me an email or message me on Instagram - hello@firered.studio / www.instagram.com/firered.studio

Then you wouldn‚Äôt buy all the packs.

You do know you can go lone wolf or squad only right ?
---
No it will never happen they literally patched this in the Ember Rise Test Server
---
It spawns you in the game immediately
---
Both are good in different ways. I would say Buck is more fun and easier to use. Ying requires a lot of patience to master.
---
I heard they made changes so rff is permanently on in some cases
---
I‚Äôm sure there are some in America but im not positive

Removing ACOG from all AR might be too drastic, but we could try to intermediate, the rifle scope on the M249 SAW that magnification should be main stream. DMR will have its place for its exclusive access to ACOG. And I don't want to comment on the state of LMGs yet because they have recently changed the ADS timer on everything, it takes awhile for the community to adapt.

Cancel that

Between rook (that helps all of the players in your team to take 1 more bullet and only go down on body shots) vs Warden (Solo ability) people in higher ranks will pick Rook.
---
It's supposed to be the other way around
---
Make it not worth the time who dont care about rank to play that mode. You not caring shouldnt be my problem when I'm playing ranked.
---
I mean it's not good but it's fun

But why doesn't she has to the same reload all time

I got one for the SG CQB (French shotty) and the UMP
---
&gt;Is 35 more ticks gonna cost them banks? N
---
For all of their servers to run 100+ tick? yes thats a lot of higher performance servers.
---
Even the money fountain that is CSGO doesnt have servers with 64 tick. 
---
&gt;If ideal the game should have 244 ticks

I didn‚Äôt understand the first sentence, it makes 0 sens.
---
OK thank you.
---
I‚Äôd like to see something similar to apex legends.
---
Worth it
---
I do think they need to speed up animations on the defense side
---
Yeah I got it in a pack
---
Prowler and knockoff pulse are the best
---
1. Stellar username 2. *Perhaps he's undercover, again*

He has chemophobia

Well that's not a very nice mentality to have
---
As I said not as good as maestro or rook but a alternative for these two.
---
Not to mention console
---

---
Honestly, attacking is WAY too ez. They eother need to slow down the hammer and gadget movement, or take away pulse. Or they can make defense have 4 spooky modes instead of 3, and speed up their gadget movement
