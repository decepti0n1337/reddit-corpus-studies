She already has an amazing pistol and both primaries are still fine
---
---
---
The elites haven't been that cool recently nothing compared to Thatcher or fuze
---
No im saying if you dont have friends to plau with or your team doesnt seem interested in working together or helping yoi then dont play an op that relies heavily on teamwork.
---
Yeah its just how we work we see are favorite streamers say this and that and then it becomes you way of seeing that one thing honestly people can't think for themselves but that's a different topic altogether but yeah most people that say there op have probably never played them mor then once
---
No but I'm assuming that in a game developer's POV, why would you want only one thing to be good? It doesn't really make sense.
---
Rip brother lol

He's incredibly insecure.

Monty is used to waiting, and getting shot in the back of the head by teammates.
---
Her face just doesn't look right
---
My wallet looking at me like “please no, not again”
---
I don't think that's like... a strictly wrong point of view, but you can certainly see something being too powerful and nerfing it just to bring it in line with the power curve of the SMG without worrying if people are under picking the SMG. I'm sure many players, like myself, choose their weapon based on sites and maps they are playing. 
---
I don't think it was nerfed strictly under the guise they wanted the SMG picked more. Just that they were seeing some over performance with the shotgun.
---
Major TERF vibes
---
Okay so I did a little more research for ya, it looks like it’s related to a graphics card start up check make sure your graphics card is updated or reinstall the drivers. Try that
---
all i want is to stop getting shit for ops i dont play
---
She just vibin
---
Love that outfit. Not a big fan of the hairstyle.
---
or is it!
---
Yeah but sometimes its fun to challenge yourself with playing different ops like its easy to just rush with ash and frag but then to change to monty and be so bad at doing anything its just not fair you just get bullied and don't get to fight back
---
No. Her gadget is broken as hell, and if played correctly in CQC she's absolutely bonkers. 
---
Why do you think she has such a high winrate?
---
Ewwwwwww why that’s so bad
---
I wasn’t talking about you doing it, and it’s arguable that that’s a spawnpeak
---
Then pick blitz instead for solo. Or play other support ops.
---
Bugging bro. The recoil is already stupid because it’s high and it’s random.
---
Dang Lara Croft still up there...

Noooo my girl is gone again- I genuinely like playing Clash big rip

Why does it remind me so much of Mira from just cause 4
---
I agree
---
No really, I can solo to plat 2 recently. Sometimes random players may help a lot.
---
It’s cuz u have the wrong version, the new version is called shitting toads
---
I tried it everywhere, Reddit was my last hope. Someone told me that only bodyshots now knock, arms and legs are ~97dmg.
---
To be fair I've always enjoyed Tower, though it's not my favourite
---
Lol I played for like one weekend and remembered what cod mp is. 
---
The campaign was fun just needed to be twice as long.
---
Same, maybe refund for half the price? so we get something back
---
Everyone is forgetting about the Ash elite skin in Chimera, although it was only a variation.
---
Lmao fuck that shit. Insurgency sandstorm is 15 bucks this week.
---
It's definitely not an amazingly pistol, the only great thing it has going for it is the sight
---
Ya
---
ya i have 7 hg for iq only time i play her is for the daily and ubisoft club dailies
---
If you had an account back then :( I switched to PC after and I can't get it
---
Its got good damage, good reload and a built in sight
---
I prefer old Kapkan. I had perfect placements for the traps, trick was to place on light doorways so they were barely visible.
---
Well in the background of this image there’s portraits of Harry and Doki presumably done by her so sure she has preferences but she seems to be able to do other art styles.
---
Go to the subreddit to the three bars top right and add personal flair
---
M762. Similar story with Capitao's M249 and FAL. While they do come with much larger magazines, the LMGs have slower ADS times.
---
Both ops have abilities that are used in combat and require them to switch off their main gun (Zofia's launcher and Capitao's crossbow), so being able to ADS again as soon as possible is extremely important in my eyes. Obviously, the extended magazine capacities gives the LMGs their place, but I think that the ADS speed is more useful in more situations.
---
Lowkey been wanting a c8-sfw without the Skelton key. Shit would be like a r4c but with acog

I don't think that works anymore
---
why dont u just play it on pc?
---
The definition of cliche is "a phrase or opinion that is overused and betrays a lack of original thought" so it's the exact same thing as calling it generic.

look up that error code on this thing called google

ok boomer

You being a Zofia main changes my perception of that image to something not good.

Why does Ella only have three toes in this ?

Good idea nice

Or he got a new opp and Spammed kids in casual

I thought you had a laser sight on your kapkan gun and I was like I don't remember the laser sight showing like that but then I realized it was the kapkan Trap
---
Well I guess it is good to be able to branch out.

Nah, it has to be a weapon buff.

Obvious bait, but I'll bite. Shields aren't meant to go alone. Blitz is effective against poorly coordinated teams - if he's inside site while the defenders are still trying to set up, an attacker victory is practically guaranteed. All eyes are on him, which gives his rifle-armed teammates room to breathe, they can take their time calming killing anyone they see, as all the defenders are focused on the insane flashbang shield man wreaking havoc on site.
---
Monty and Clash should be played as a portable black mirror (Mira's gadget). [Example.](https://streamable.com/yh527) There is nothing those guys could do about us, they simply have to retreat and try to ambush us. I think that Monty and Clash should have opaque shields so that shit like that can't happen.
---
“How many times do we have to teach you a lesson ~old man~ you fucking muppet?!”

I have everything on Xbox including pro league skins from lion and up and all of the operators too, plus the game is kind of toxic and this would be a perfect way to get out of it for a year or so.

---
 I was just asking a  honest question. I wasnt being a smartass or anything. I dont know why I'm getting downvoted for asking a question? I dunno what's wrong with this subreddit and siege itself seems likes it filled with a bunch of blowhards now that take this game too serious but ok thanks for your answer.
---
Sounds like someone got killed by a twitch a lot
---
Everyone gets killed by Twitch a lot lol
---
Would've been better if they made her look like Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde
---
Eh
---
now i wait for the sweet, sweet porn.
---
No. Kaplan traps are braindead easy to drone and destroy, and they're only useful lategame. Lesion is too strong and will probably be nerfed soon.
---
Ela's mines on the other hand literally take away your ability to play the game, and cannot be countered except with an EMP or nade. They're so damn oppressive and that's why she's not going to be buffed anytime soon.
---
Last year they gave 25.000 renown, but it isn't know if they are gonna do that again this year.
---
No problem
---
Terrible idea.
---
Remember when the characters resembled military units? Ah good times.
---
You're actually copper. Kapkan is a troll pick, lesion is getting nerfed but at least he doesn't take away your ability to hear or aim, and echo is an instaban and not even a trap op.
---
God, you'd think I'm in oz with the number of strawmen you're throwing at me.
---
the one elite I actually like...
---
and I don’t have R bucc for it ;/
---
just keep her turned off.
---
You come here often
---
CAPTAINN!!!
---
Do you have any data that it **did** do something? I'd like to see it. Just curious.
---
I like the skin. Curious about the victory animation
---
what a surprise, ubisoft is shit at coding.
---
Ela “Karen” Elite skin
---
Ezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Gird your loins. They go raw dog out there these days.
---
nice casual win
---
You're trolling, gu mines don't take away your ability to hear or aim and are easy to drone and destroy, meanwhile you literally cannot destroy a grzmot unless you have an emp or nade.
---
Besides lesion is getting nerfed lol
---
Ahh, the everyday siege post asking to nerf someone because they're not good enough at the game to counter them.
---
it has 1080 rpm, 23 Damage.
---
The SMG 11 has 35 DMG and 1270 RPM. And is a secondary.
---
You can learn the SMG11 pattern, The Scorpion is kind of random.
---
The SAS have a better secondary than Ela's primary
---
Good thing to waste your renown on at least
---
Why are her hands melting
---
It’s honestly both lol
---
They absolutely are not. Look at the pick and win rate.
---
Video: https://youtu.be/5MhDz0-LHvo
---
Nice shot 👌
---
hey i’m not op but u think you can tell me the name of the store so i can buy one when they’re up?? i need this lmao
---
Where is this picture from?
---
No, there’s paint all over the floor, so she probably just stepped in paint in her socks, which I honestly think is worse.
---
Definitely will be worth it if you plan to only play buck
---
No, its just a situational weapon in my opinion, I’m not mad though, as i was hoping was obvious in my post.
---
honestly rly dumb it has high recoil COMPARED TO OTHER GUNS no sir i can aim just its harder compared to others. sure it may not be hard to but compared to other guns yes it is.also if you get twitch every game counter her. also mozzies prominent enough to get the drones.
---
It’s the one corner you forget to check... you feel like you’ve droned the place out but that ONE corner and suddenly you’re being interrogated
---
I just unlocked Clash for 20k renown on xbox, too.. no season passes, grinding to unlock every op only to get them yanked away from me by pathetic cheaters. If I accidentally used the glitch I'd want someone to tell me so I could just throw the round or never fire my gun to still help my team somewhat. I remember when the first time this happened came around, one of my teammates got tked for using it.
---
That's ice
---
this makes you look toxic and sweaty, please calm down
---
Looks like a Polish truckstop hooker
---
That awkward moment you are killed, then watch that reply.
---
Oh no, something a 4 stack said in jest caused someone else to respond as if they were serious.
---
It still is bad when you consider that even if you land all the shots, the scorpion still has very average dps. Look at doc's laser mp5
---
Thanks for sharing
---
I dunno a clash main
---
Ain’t no way these are damn socks
---
I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.
---
Pick and win rates don't always mean an operator is underpowered or overpowered.  Go look at pro league and how strong a shield character can be 
---
Shields shouldn't have high win deltas anyway because most characters who do win a lot of rounds are easier to use 
---
Now shields actually require skill, I play a lot of Monty and the nerfs changed him from easy mode on attack to a character that requires practice
---
Yeah buck is still hard in practice but I can use twitch really well bc her gun is super consistent.
---
Idk
---
And less than half the capacity. Ela does her job well, which is predatory trapping and prefiring mid range.
---
Seriously fuck off. I came here to place that order....
---
It’s just covered in paint
---
What game modes can it happen? Or is it all?
---
A nerf wont make people use her gadget correctly. Again taking into account your example, if the damage was 5, people would still use it to chip away 20 damage which would still be more than satisfactory considering, as you've said, that 10 damage drastically changes the ttk for a lot of weapons
---
No we don't
---
Classic dinner table joke to ask someone ,,Pieprzysz?’’
---
Hopefully. Siege was the one FPS that sat with me best as far as gun mechanics are concerned. Farming melons is the most satisfying thing in this game.
---
Have a downvote
---
&gt;screencapping your own joke
---
Support pick? No. No other OP is treated as such, why are shield considered the only support pick? We have a cast of 50 OPs. Surely there can’t only be 2 and a half supports? They are current a 2 hit kill but have to expose themselves in a clunky non reliable melee. Taking the current version of melee and giving them a less deadly but safer version seems like a fair trade.
---
^ these numbers can be incredibly deceptive. You balance the game around the top tiers of play. Not the average people or slightly above average people most of the time. More plats are in those statistics than diamonds. Yes it can certainly outline problems, but there are lots of variables regarding nuanced things like supporting shield ops.
---
She reminds me of Harley Quinn in suicide squad.
---
One of the worst elite skins, right next to Smoke's.
---
It's obviously you knew I looked on your profile
---
20 inch dido-
---
scope.
---
Sorry for my friend's reaction
---
It’s late kid. Go to bed.
---
Yeezus
---
It's literally the same haircut as default, just recolored.
---
It would be better to be able to actually customize game modes ourselves. And be able to do things like 5 of the same operators. And also, how is the event maps being in custom games bad and why do you dislike it. No way you wouldn’t like that
---
Honestly this feels like a fever dream I need sleep fucking shadow dudes in my perpheral
---
I had a little bit similar situation when the chat symbol abuse was a thing on pc. A random kid spammed dots to the chat and it made huge lag spikes for everyone. The worst part was that he thought that he was funny and giggled into the voice chat: "one, two, three, stop matafakaa!!" xD
---
We lost the game because of him
---
Uhhhhhhhh i'll take a McRib with extra fries and a side of catsup
---
And how do you pronounce it?
---
My guy, she runs around gunning down terrorists. You don't think a stray bullet or two might have hit her in the foot?
---
No, the operator needs to be unlocked separately
---
No
---
When you could put more than one on a single doorway. Ahhh the old days
---
I was thinking about an automatic version of mav's ar15 just a few minutes ago lol
---
Bad idea, it will bring the elite skin's worth lower as it would be a free skin if you got it out of the pack, it would be unfair to those who used real money to buy the elite skins to show their love for the game
---
Finka, how're ya now?
---
Paper 5
---
I am also 2 or 3 games away from plat and i have currently only one friend who wants to play ranked so let's hope that either of us doesn't get shitty teammates :)
---
And good luck!
---
This is actually really cool
---
I don’t understand the appeal other than to look different.  Pretty boring skin.
---
there is no spoon
---
Agreed i main Ela kinda and you're basically just bad if you can't use her. The gun has a crazy fast fire rate obviously it's gonna be a bitch an a half to control lmao I'm still getting headshots tho. OP just needs practice imo
---
Damn, that’s a nice story. I guess my next course of action is doing some solo/duo queue to try to find people willing to squad up.
---
fr?
---
Just the resolution &amp; cropping of the text, little things.
---
It's actually the opposite. Technically it's completely false, because there are clearly times where she isn't disabled from the game.
---
Good luck man
---
Cool skin but is it better than Pro League Ela?
---
I would like to say something, but I can't or I'll get banned
---
Random statements? Too stupid to look shit up too? https://www.game-debate.com/blog/images/_id1524655756_343178.png chimera numbers.

Current numbers. Still low win rate compared to a lot of ops. But okay dude. Totally pulled it out of my ass.
---
song?

You actually made her look cute

I'LL TAKE YOUR WHOLE STOCK
---
To the torso only. Legs are not insta down.
---
Here's one, only 90s kids remember the old operator icons
---
Wanna Sprite cranberry?
---
Yes, it’s a dumb metric to balance but that’s how they choose to do it.
---
Which is why I presented these suggestions.
---
Shields are the only thing that was nerfed because they weren’t too good but were “annoying” to fight.

wrong
---
Of course his ban rate is off the charts. You're literally missing the point. He wasn't buffed. There was no buff. He had a low win delta the whole time with no buffs but was broken. Therefore it stands to reason that those fuckin' charts aren't the end all be all for data. Fuck you're so confused it's impressive lol.
---
Come at me you tiny tiny men

Why the hek ela elite skin is a freaking emo/goth? (Czemu zrobili alternatywkę XD)

Hi, I'm Ela Bosak and you're watching disney channel

I’d be more interested in a Splinter Cell Agent Elite. Sam Fisher’s/other Splinter Cell Agents whole shtick was stealth and interrogating.
---
Except Joe in the blue team. F.ck Joe!
---
(Do you know why that guy was tkd, though?)
---
That’s true. Either would be cool. The AC idea has me hooked especially bc her gadget reskin could be a hidden blade.
---
"You like Jazz?"

I want 1 dollar for each time someone has posted this garbage

This skin makes her look like she has a premium snap for feet pics. I like having unique-ness to the skins that relate to the characters but idk man.

Yes, ok.

---
Attackers:
---
Gridlock throws down spreadable mess of barbed traps, it's basically barbed wire that does damage, she's slow has decent guns.
---
Nokk is basically Vigil AND Cav, goes invis to cams walks quieter and gets to keep her primary out. Her weapons are horrible to compensate.
---
Amaru can grapple onto anything from outside (nothing inside other than hatches). Not really useful to surprise people as it's super loud and has a period of time to raise your gun up.
---
Kali is what glaz should have been, bolt action sniper super long range scope. Her gadget can bore through reinforced walls and break stuff on the other side (no hole). It's a thatcher substitute, but there are less of them and... I find it's less effective.
---
Defenders:
---
Mozzie hijacks drones (3x), decent weapons.
---
Warden is able to see through smoke, and ignore flashes when he turns his specs on. Cooldown system similar to Cav, mostly just a meme.
---
Goyo has three shields which he attaches explosion packs on, shoot the red section and they explode. He's probably one of the better new operators you haven't played with yet. Destroying them from the outside explodes them too. Same gun as Mira.
---
Wamai is also good, it's a replacement for Jager. it basically pulls 1 projectile (including capitao bolts) to it then explodes and puts the effect in that area. Please note that his items EXPLODE so do not put them near each other as they will remove others.
---
Wait can someone tell me why there is no crossplay? (Ps4-Xbox)
---
Like I mean why are they not adding it
---
I think at one point Kapkan had a AC skin, solely because of his hood. lol
---
Kind of late, but how did u make the guns. I’m interested in making a model gun to display
---
It's the same round
---
Playing on Bartlett ? I see you are a man of culture
---
Poor Blackbeard got nerfed too many times, look at that handwriting
---
Your comment is reasonable enough so I'll let it pass. Buck ain't bad himself anyway.
---
Looks pretty spot on
---
Well 1 win and you’ll be plat, so looks like your problem is solved
---
No it was atrocious for most people including me. Attacking on it is so un-fun because of all the balconies and possible run outs. It needs a rework if it’s ever gonna return to ranked
---
Sniffle
---
Wow it's uncanny
---
"Ela! What did you do to my shield?!?!"
---
A claymore kinda helps with runouts
---
One of the worst maps of the ranked map pool, atleast in semi higher ranks and up. 
---
Now we need to get rid of chalet and the pool is somewhat decent
---
It doesn't have many items in it's bundle amd it isn't worth the price
---
We ended up losing a couple and wining some back we are currently 2 games set back now
---
At diamond, the matchmaking queue can take a solid 10-15 mins per game. I have a little setup in my house that I use while I'm waiting for matches. They're resistance bands you anchor to a door, and they essentially act as a cable machine. 
---
Would thoroughly recommend. Even if you only play 3 games at 5 minute queue a match (Sometimes I'll go through the pick ban phase if it's unranked as well, another ~2 mins), you'll get between 15 and 20 minutes of resistance training a day.
---
Chris Hansen has entered the chat:
---
K.
---
Sure but there are still a ton of places defenders can come from. And even though attacking is miserable, defense isn’t much better. Tea room is the only site where I feel even remotely safe. Every other site is an absolute clusterfuck. The map has a cool aesthetic so I hope it gets reworked but in its current state it’s not fit for ranked
---
sO tOxIc
---
Tbh 11/12 maps being acceptable for ranked is a pretty good percentage. Jury’s still out on Theme Park I guess but I like it so far
---
You are literally 22 points of from plat and you think they might have played a match without you and won. 
---
Even if you played every match with them, if they ended the previous season with an MMR 40 higher than yours this would have happened. It takes your latest rank of the previous season into account.
---
a nice ass indeed.
---
Vomit.
---
And then missing the easy shot when he’s downed
---
Well good to know now
---
Nice art!
---
Don't know what cpu you were running before but i7's tend to put out a lot of heat which could be causing the fans to go max speed. If it's silence U want I would look into water cooling options
---
So stupid.
---
Sounds about right. Aren't you precious lol.
---
Oh absolutely, much improved since a few seasons ago. And to be honest I love playing Kali in Chalet, pushing main garage and breaking the wall into wine means you can really put that 12x scope to work. One of the few maps I can really do that. But it's attacker sided as hell, so it's the next to go out I would expect. 
---
I think Theme Park has huge potential! People complain about it being to defender sided but it's a new map and I think it's very decent to attack actually. There are a crazy amount of strats I found in about an hour in a custom game that I can't wait for people to start using against each other. I hope we can really start to see the map grow.
---
It would not let me buy earlier
---
All I'm sayin is Buck elite: only overalls. With one strap undone.

Where would you mount it without removing the shotgun ?

so some misaligned textures=being able to shoot while being immune to damage from the front?

Doesn't the pressure then go up? If I was a "diamond" and joined a diamond squad, why would you want to put up with the pressure that comes with living up to your rank if you are truly a gold or plat? Fuck that, I'm a plat and people know that - I could never fake being a diamond because my gameplay speaks for itself. If you cheat it's impossible to live up to the image you've created.

i mean i played other heavy games like bf1 but i didn't have any problem the PC wasn't noisy at all

Hopefully because I had some of my best games on that map

What is it with clash and glitches?
---
Expensive licensing.
---
Welp star jump time
---
You are confusing .22  and .223   
---
.223 is nearly identical to 5.56 mm. So identical that 99% of 5.56 rifles can be fed with .223 without any problems and modifications
---
They don't care about that either. You're thinking long-term while they're just in it for their 15 seconds of fame toward their peers. When they drop back to the rank they're supposed to be they'll just stop bragging or act as if they'd just risen *up* to that rank instead of having dropped down

recycled gun for new operators &lt;

make fake gun for game? I mean Borderlands 2 have over 1m guns.

Nah

I run mp7 and dominate
---
She's a little too big in my opinion
---
The elite is cool and I'd like to get it. Only reason I'm not getting it, is because her guns suck and her pistol is basically the best weapon of her kit. If they buff her, then I'll buy the elite.
---
Who needs the screen right?

Soo true

I get way more kills using Mp5K than FMG-9 even when the guns have the same stats, hell, even MPX feels way more deadlier than FMG-9.

If they are recycling guns they should do it right. This is a great idea especially the c8 without skeleton key. I am happy that the y5s1 operator is getting the arx that nomad has and will most likely have grips on it. So seeing the c8 without skeleton key will make me very happy. They should just do this. Add slightly different varients of existing guns like they did with echo mp5 and gridlocks saw

*416c, it’s the carbine variant, the 416 is the full size rifle, and the 417 is the DMR configuration, and the M27 Lsw is the lmg variation
---
She looks just like Ela, amazing cosplay!
---
I can’t unsee that now...damn
---
If you mean that the color appears later than she moves with desync, you could argue that the paint has travel time because she is not painting but "throwing" the paint
---
Elite skins are supposed to represent the character the outfit is pretty much a fuck you to the GROM and Zofia it’s the coolest one imo
---
I think just a normal G36 would be cool because of the integrated sight that it has
---
Ngl it’s kinda bad
---
That doesn't make any sense since the first 2 "throws" are in sync and the other 2 aren't
---
No ban it is!
---
Everywhere I go I see your name with the correct awnser to whatever is being asked or the correct response to a comment
---
Quick question can we convert the fmg-9 into a higher caliber as a buff? Asking for a friend
---
A G36K would be the most likely option. It keeps the integrated optics and has the shortest barrel out of the full rifles
---
Since the changes to the ranks the average is silver
---
I agree with that, but the issue with Ubisoft is that they can’t “afford” to get other gun licenses, so my idea is for variations of guns they have licenses for
---
I mean splinter cell has the sc2000 as a replacement name if I remember correctly
---
She also moves slower in the following movements after the first 2 so the paint would come on later

For the 200m breaststroke, which I don't think quite compares to freediving

That’s the dmr configuration, it’s .308 compared to standard .556

What? There is no .308 vs 5.56 _configuration_. They are two different guns.

i just found out you can shoot armored cameras from the side
---
Same it fits her personality and fuck you attitude perfectly at first I only liked the animation but after I learned the fact she’s a rebellious artist who pretty much gave the biggest middle finger in history to the GROM by dyeing her hair green I started to like it a lot more
---
Maybe as a 1 speed defender?
---
She doesn't really move that much slower it's just that she doesn't do the other 2 in rapid succession so they should still be in sync
---
BEHOLD LORD FARQAAUD

I dont see anyone complaining
---
Yes it just got released yesterday
---
Thanks for the credits, I didn't know who it was until I saw until I saw your comment, also I just realized, the image has a watermark of the creator in Ela's arm, so...
---
Close range tho, the guns are lethal full auto, and I think there should be a pattern to it, something to learn and memorize. Not saying it should be toned down at all but sometimes it’s pure luck I get a kill with that or pure luck I drop a kill, cause there is no way to tell where it’s gonna kick or how it’s gonna kick
---
Oh god, just checked your last video. You are pretty good. I dont have as much as free time i used to but i'll definitely pop in once in a while
---
Go for it bro!
---
Just to be clear, using silent step doesn't affect DBNO, it's a special feature of her pistol that makes headshots downs instead of kills. And silent step forces you to use pistol
---
I Love the Elite but the animation yeah is kinda nice i think. but on the other side there is no Elite animation where i say holy shit this is nice

It is Ubisoft’s fault. If they put a ridiculous weapon in the game, I’m not going to tell you that it’s your fault for not using it, if you weren’t using it. This whole conversation you’ve been treating as me complaining about the SMG because I can’t win. You think I’m here to complain about wins and losses? I’m here discussing to make the game more fun and to have the game make more sense, while all you’re trying to explain to me is that the 11 is not broken. Yes I bloody understand that it’s not broken but it is still overpowered and a SECONDARY, at that. It should be situational and non-ideal, yet it is versatile and very ideal. It should be the lower consistency higher potential alternative to a pistol, yet it is a higher consistency, higher potential alternative. It should lose at mid range to primaries, yet it wins, and its low mag weakness is compensated for by simply having a teammate back you up.
---
Your implied answer that bleeds out of all your arguments is “it’s not broken so it’s fine”, and I’m telling you, from a game theme perspective, this goes against the game’s identity. It isn’t a fun, quirky exception to the rule (I appreciate those), it fucking shatters the rule, to the point to which it defines play styles, instead of being part of them. Meta has nothing to do with this. In the ideal game, meta does not exist/matter. If Smoke, Mute or Sledge want an automatic primary for all intents and purposes, their answers should be FMG9, MP5K, and L85A2, and that’s that. Shotguns should be buffed so they actually become threatening under 10 meters, and the secondaries should compete with their consistency vs. close range power. The SMG11 should have the Japanese machine pistol recoil and become as situational as it was intended to be
---
Is this skin a reference to something?

Personally not a major fan of the Jager elite honestly. But lesion and sledge do look good though
---

---
Either they have some sort of agreement, unlikely, or they just haven’t gotten a cease and desist yet.
---
Gris game
---
Blackbeard or Thatcher for me they both fit the characters well and seem more in line with the game though Blackbeards is a little further off of course.
---
I feel like the WW1 and casual stuff is at best kind of ridiculous compare to the game's overall theme and at worst lazy, lazy is more towards the casual ones. Bandits is the one that makes the most sense given his background Bio but given we've actually seen what I believe is an undercover mugshot the actual elite feels lazy like they slapped BB and Pulse's face models together to get Bandit's instead of making a new one.
---
Only if your bad. I feel like house is one of the few balanced maps
---
My favourite is the bandit elite which is weird because when it leaked I hated how it looked (the watermarks ruined it) but I actually really like it 
---
One that's divisive that I really like is the IQ elite
---
oOf
---
you have my blessing after the FO-12 nerf maybe ubi wants to give her some love with a scorpion buff 
---
pls ubi

Nah u smd

What would you like to see?

Oh nooo my last video is not a representation of my skills lmaoo.
---
I was half asleep and went 0/8
---
Its better in game trust me
---
Nope. Silent step does nothing except remove footsteps from Jackal and no audio. The rest is all on her modified pistol
---
Ah just searched it. Looks like a decent game and it matches Ela
---
Plat 2 solo queue and plat 2 5 stack is a different game imo
---
'It's not a phase mom!'
---
Although, whoever did this art work did a great job. Apart from those feet...
---
Chalet gone.
---
I'm a simple man. I see trash, I get the urge to set it on fire if left out for too long.
---
Oh, and Cap's fires redone in some way. He's still too powerful.
---
Woops I meant to say lower the seat.
---
Still, must mean something?
---
I've heard this idea somewhat else and I kinda like it 
---
What if ela lost a mine or her effect was shortened but she received a weapon buff? That way the annoying aspect of her is reduced but she gets a bit more fragging potential
---
It wasn’t planned to be released as a free elite. It was supposed to only come from outbreak backs but then something happened and they made a free spinoff
---
&gt;It’s a nerf to people who only use the R4C. It would still shred and maintain its severely low recoil. It just limits the amount of targets you can kill per mag, while keeping the targets you can kill easy pickings. I like it as it keeps it strong but limits its effectiveness in select situations. 
---
Wouldn't mind, but wouldn't it be better to go in steps? 25 first? That's already a lot of Fragging power down the drain.
---
&gt;As for Zofia, I think the quicker reloads, better handling (even with the gap lowered in Ember Rise) and the slightly faster fire rate means it will still get played. Look at capitao. His LMG is statistically identical but is less played because it’s handling is worse and has a longer reload. It’ll be the same here. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It just reduced her fragging ability with the only weapon that’s used, and makes the other weapon more appealing.
---
Technically the other weapon can be appealing if you just buff it to 43. Thing is, in case of cap, the stats were the same. And that slow lmg didn't suit a 3 speed. But here, as a 2, drop the m762's damage and it'll not be appealing. Besides, her secondary is fine anyway. So they wouldn't mind the long reload, especially when you have **150 frikking leads**.
---
**♪ Bulletproof - La Roux ♪** plays in the background lol [https://youtu.be/Kk8eJh4i8Lo](https://youtu.be/Kk8eJh4i8Lo)
---
I think the small nerfs to things like this don’t achieve much at all. Look at twitch. The F2 is no less powerful than before and no one actually feels the nerf. It was so inconsequential. 
---
That’s why I’d rather see a more drastic change and if it then makes them suffer too much, buff it and find a middle ground on the next balance patch. 
---
Ash isn’t ever going to be unviable so we know this change won’t change her too much. She’s still a fan favourite fragger
---
Looks cool
---
I think these are awesome. Would love to see these for more ops

You know the Halloween event this year I went ela one time and threw 4 mines on the roof in a cluster, they all went off in rapid succession
---
Godly did average with his teammates, although we got 0-4.

Maybe not the game but some people really horror
---
I got an ace as Zofia Yesterday in ranked kinda sloppy but did the job
---
The defender would realistically only be able to fix mira windows
---
That spoopy asf
---
I mean godly wouldn’t be there if they were playing in Plat 1. My team didn’t stand a chance.
---
Is a bot I’m pretty sure, there is something like this for every game. a random unknown company  copy pastes a random image or meme from a game on a cheap piece of clothing and bots promote it on the reddit. They actually make decent money, I bet they sell this hoodie for $40 dollars and it costs them $5 to produce, and I bet at least 3 people buy them every time it’s posted.

Do you know what weapon the skin it is for?

And I hate when people are like “oh just burst it” that gun loses so much potential when you’re bursting it
---
I think an ACOG would make th operator incredibly broken, his smg is already a laserbeam.
---
Nomada Studio consists of ex-Ubisoft employees, so i guess there's that.
---
Biased but frost and Mira. I wish the frost mats were different though

---
A crossover with the game Gris.
---
you made it work
---
how do you get that?
---
Just for Elas scorpion I think
---
As for the twitch drone, I feel it may be necessary considering how strong Mira has remained. With an insane ban rate at all levels of play, I feel twitch should be slightly more effective at dealing with Mira. It would help at all levels of play and saves nerfing Mira. 
---
As for Warden, I wanted a way for his gadget to be able to be used a lot more frequently, as 90% of the time he stays as a mediocre 2 speed operator with no gadget. No one wants that. 
---
Allowing him to be more aggressive through having enemies highlighted like Glaz when his glasses are active means that he can use this ALL the time and it will always be a benefit for him, which is what he needs
---
I’ve already counter-sniped Kali a few times with the BOSG, it’s a lot of fun.

Dont rush out of spawn immediately. You will be spawn peaked. Give it about 5-10 seconds.

Also if you can find a team do so.

Well the main reason jäger is picked is because of his gun if his gadget got a buff I guess that would make sense and echos only viable gun is the mp5 so nerfing it would make him a bit less viable
---
Yes, officer, this man right here.
---
Im playing since release im playing rank and casual ( tho I’m probably more of a competitive player and enjoy balanced games) I hated the change when they did it for ranked I was like you ( and all the people hating it) but after a couple of games I realized that it made rank much better and enjoyable.
---
For casual it’s a different thing people wJt to play for fun but imo this doesn’t take anything away from the fun you can get. You still play the exact same number of rounds on each side. 
---
This won’t destroy the game, people are only mad because it’s new. I’m confident that in a month or 2 people will forget about this.

What's toxic about that?

Dude that shotgun did not have high recoil idk why you keep saying that. Plus is you put a laser on it decreased hipfire spread. So low spread. All the shotgun did was go straight up, so just pull down on the stick and there was nothing. If it wasn’t broken then why did it get nerfed? Why did Ela’s win rate sky rocket when her shotgun use skyrocketed (she had one of the top 3 win rates in the last delta that was released). 
---
And to say she’s the worst is just wrong.
---
the camera movement makes me believe that the pigeon is playing this.
---
I never argued that it wasn’t random spread, it is, but it is controllable. Go watch any high rank player on PC use her SMG, it *is* controllable. Just like the SMG-12, just like the Bearing-9.
---
To the contrary I did not know this granted I've yet to try havent had much time to play recently
---
True but I actually use that lol, I think it’s better to be accurate with less vision than seeing somebody but rng said no and made it go right and left as much as possible

Yup
---
That was kind of my point, I don’t like that it’s easier. 
---
I really enjoyed the challenge of having to constantly adapt to playing differently, I never said the matches were the problem, that just comes down to who you’re playing against. It’s more that the variety of gameplay from round to round is cut in half if you’re going to be playing the same set of operators 2-3 times in a row.

---
With 3 rounds it’s not much easier, you just keep the same mindset for 3 rounds instead of having to change it each round, it helps with the continuity. 
---
But the fact that it’s in a row doesn’t change anything. You would have chosen the same operator even if you went to defense in between your attacks, you just play a different operator between it, imo it doesn’t change anything.
---
I was in your position, just gave up and stop playing. I've tried finding teams, usually with no results, and if I did find someone it was just a One match and then never speak or invite me again. Still don't understand why. I'm not shit, I'm just nice and helpful and do my best, and I was pretty good. All my friends eventually found a new game or just had different schedules.
---
If you're in the same time zone I'd be willing to try. Don't know what rank I would be currently. Last time I played was with Nokk and Warden's release, but even then it wasn't a lot. Might be rusty but I'm usually quick to get back into it.

Because they are bad.

Because Wartime elites are *real* creative, right?

The fact that he's a great Clash main coincides with the fact that no one knows how to counter her. If they knew how to counter her, he wouldn't be as good ;)

Sights are subjective. Wanna fight in close quarters? Pick 1x. Enjoy holding angles and playing a bit further from your opponents? Pick ACOG.

Bro you gotta look up rouge 9 attachment videos. They are good and help make your decision
---
Test? Is that what you call just patting me, and not even enough to hurt? Well, I guess you ripped my 20,000 yen pants, though.
---
Care to explain why?
---
It’s the rainbow birthday skin
---
Ela's gun
---
That’s a nice skin
---
It won’t let me get the get the skin but it gave me the charm
---
Those are the lame fake ones that don't come with a code tho
---
A skin
---
Yes the top matters.  But you entirely seclude the top of the main playerbase otherwise known as console.
---
It’s a joke? Kinda hard to explain. Any gun is viable if you hit your shots. Due to one shot headshots fire rate is usually the tell of the better guns. Both bombards guns have lower firerates but I wouldn’t say they are bad.
---
Fuckin fist of fury there
---
Ik I'm stupid so don't say it. What does pm mean?
---
Y’all have great humor 👍
---
Oh he did. I killed him
---
Meant to say damn but whatever lmfao
---
The top console players aren't pushing for or popping off in pro league. There are only a handful of console players that have proven they can hang with PC on controller (mainly shout out to you Priest), unless you have evidence otherwise? I'm sure if there were more consoles/controllers in pro league they would give a fuck. But they don't.
---
Personally my ideal solutions are as follows:
---
1) If you join a game in progress and finish the match, your alpha pack chance (The 2% or so for finishing a game) is doubled, so you end up with 4% and the renown earned is doubled.
---
2) Staying in a game until the end prevents you from joining a game in progress on the next game, or in other words, you are guaranteed a fresh lobby (But then if you leave that, you'll be eligible for a game in progress for the next lobby)
---
No previous season has been as bad for joining games in progress (and especially those on 0 - 2). Casual matchmaking has always been very troublesome ever since the first attempt at introducing a balancing system.
---
[Reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgYyuoP2a5s&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Back when blitz’s hipfire was insane but he couldn’t push effectively because of his shield
---
#WOOOOOOOOO
---
Why are you Joestars so stubborn about admitting defeat? Hmph. I suppose I shall rise to your silly provocation, and test you a bit more.
---
I would have shit myself if I saw this in the same room as me.
---
With Siege, it uses the servers to authenticate what operators you own. If the servers are down or you unplug and replug the internet, all of the operators will be available.
---
Solider
---
Nevermind.  I'm retarded.
---
Laser is amazing if you know how to use it. It makes it so when you aim, you reach a good enough zoom to get an accurate shot faster than without it. This with an angled grip makes for some instant ads. Negatives are that you give away your position and have worse recoil
---
Bruh, it’s a damn figurine, the point wouldn’t be a code but an aesthetic purpose
---
Just gonna sneeeeak right past ya.
---
Nøkk is my sleep paralysis daemon
---
Why you looking?

He's probably one of those people who get mad over nothing,then plays victim when they clap back
---
You should be able to melee the wire because I don't think Ubi would add wire cutters but if you were talking about melee and wire cutters being the same thing goodjob
---
Change your dynamic sound to night mode to easily hear footsteps.
---
That should be a twitch skin
---
Bandit is A tier?
---
That’s pretty neat looking.
---
There is a work around, if you drag the game files from your steam files and copy it into Uplay it MIGHT find it. I've done it but it really is picky about where it will look. Take some time and try and get it to find the files.
---
I did nothing say about crossplay but ok
---
This is well written. I second this.
---
Cool! No probs. Glhf!
---
He is pretty easy to use and has nice guns, you just need a bit of time to know what walls are worth electrifying or not
---
It indeed is.
---
Same to you man!
---
Anyone got a link to a vid of this? Somehow this one flew right under my radar
---
Makes sense. I like it.
---
Nah man.... dude just gotta get a grip, that’s a basic Mira play that was probably discovered more than a year ago. One million iq? Okay pal
---
Hey, i look kinda blurry in this one
---
No problem!
---
kinda thought you'd maybe make the operators Irish if the map is a brewery. sad times.
---
R6 had a bug where you could crash game because of charcter spam. Might be that or you get people using the "/ \\" to make "/V i \*\*er" with the stars being "g"s so it might have flagged it for that reason
---
Oh dang that's deep!
---
Why would Monty Date Ela?
---
There we go,you finally made a point for once.I was never complaining from the start,i was just confused why they decided on ela.
---
Hm......doubt they could split the skin coding.
---
But it would be a nice addition.
---
that fucking sucks bro
---
No way maestro is in the C tier, he is the most powerful defender there is
---
So... no hard breachers on S tier?
---
I miss the old Elias. They made him look retarded.
---
It seems like there’s always that one guy though. Thanks!
---
My only tweak would be to use s color other than jungle green as Goyo and Amaru just dropped with that pallet. Unless ofcourse your willing to wait some time
---
Aces only count in the drone phase
---
How fitting
---
Why is castle d tier he is very useful
---
It is just how my brain is wired, lose track of everything when I need to keep track of it and keep on track when it would be better to forget it immediately.
---
Basically the entire d row makes me sad. Especially ying. Ying rocks
---
Neckbeard is a state of mind.
---
It requires some map knowledge to play with them, S tier is for ops that you can play effectivly on your first day
---
Half the people there are annoying and spergy. They do this same thing.
---
Sorry I dont like fat girls? Not many people do. It's disgusting. Just like nobody wants a fat nerd either.
---
Too many issues here.
---
BB, lion and finka, definitely NOT for new players. They don't know how to position with BB well enough. They won't know when and how to coordinate a lion roar, and they definitely won't know how to Finka juice at the right moment.
---
Same for blitz and Monty. Shields should be E or F when it comes to new players. You DO NOT want a newbie playing a shield. They won't know how to coordinate well enough.
---
Echo too is an E. He's too hard for new kids. The timing, positioning, etc., are not for people with any less than 500 hours in the game.
---
The rest are ok.
---
I agree, but new players will either waste their candelas or flash teammates(
---
Operators are allowed to be centered around fragging lol. Twitch has an almost objectively worse gadget when it comes to dealing with defender utility. So she gets a better weapon to compensate

---
Ok, thanks! Will make does changes.
---
Not necessarily. They already knew where I was, and any flank I would have done besides running to piano stairs wouldn’t have been stealthy at all. I figured I would just play the angle that I already had
---
Wow sounds like we bros! Cause I've got occasional memory issues as well. Almost failed an exam back in school once because of that!
---
Worst part- I fall asleep while riding! I have absolutely no clue how and why!
---
Shadow company soldier?
---
Look at the bright side, you've saved yourself the trauma of having to play her for a bit. Bask in it while you can.
---
Dude seriously fuck off
---
Hahaha yeah sry i mean tachanka is to strong
---
She could shoot with her shield in front of her.
---
Is that the Romanian flag on Scorch's chest?
---
BuT THats VAlk NoT TwITch!!!1!1!!!
---
Could you elaborate a little bit?  I don't mind her anymore.  I think the charm of the Ash is she's good haha
---
Yeah 90% of the player base is console and that comment right there is why he said “ignorant PC players” cause that kid is the definition of an ignorant PC players. Y’all get the guns balanced based off your gameplay (like how the TSCG was garbage on console and needed a separate tweak on console) y’all get actually reporting that works, toxic players get banned. And I’ve been told multiple times here that I don’t understand the game because I play console. Most PC players are cool I’ve had good discussions on this sub with a lot of PC players. 
---
But some are ignorant, example calling a majority of the player base irrelevant
---
I think I would be best if it only worked if you were in a party with them and it would but the player with the controller on the pc server so people wouldn’t be able to exploit it on console servers
---
Again? I remember that from the end of I think wind bastion and begining of burnt horizon
---
I love jojo
---
I'd put Valk over the R, and maybe pick a different font.  I like the simplicity and the social media tags are spot on.  Well done bro :)
---
Thanks for the tip but thats already with me dumbing it down to 1280x720 my display resolution is 1824x1026
---
you say  **Fortress**  YOU SAY  **Fortress**   what a mess
---
Yo Roc
---
OH, HO. Then come as close as you like
---
They mentioned a while back that they want to do this.
---
I love how you comment you know you have a toxicity problem but you’re on your last ban. Dude just don’t be a dick it’s not hard. How many chances do you actually need?
---
Probably available on custom matches...
---
Yo wtf
---
Imma stay with my FAL, i like high damage weapons
---
I know it’s valk, it’s for my twitch channel.
---
Can anyone give me pic for blitz approaching doc
---
Miss, D3
---
Looks like LQTGBwhatever propaganda to me..
---
There’s a version of the scorpion carbine that is integrally suppressed. I want Nokk to have that. Also I don’t think the scorpion needs any work besides and actual recoil pattern, something that is learnable and not randomized
---
You're just bad
---
Too*
---
I hate to do this to ya buddy, but that right there is meme speak. It was typed like that to give the impression of sarcasm. In conclusion, r/woooosh

I’m pretty sure you get it by mashing 4 a bunch at the home screen

Pretty hard to argue that it wasn't a one tap if you are dead...

He’s asking for customisation and then giving an example of what he needs

Happened to me on the balcony wall, couldn't move.

Again? Well damn.

That’s understandable
---
N I C E. thanks maybe I'll start playing again then haha.
---
Understandable
---
Why hold the trigger down longer than I need to? Lol
---
Shits brand new and you can get it in the uplay thing i think. Someone might be able to link the tweet that explains it, but it's free for ppl logging in until a certain date. On mobile, sorry.
---
This spot has multiple brilliant uses and holds from cam placements to peak angles, you must be very new to the game so some advice if you find a weird angle, don't think about how it won't be used but think about what advantage it could give you against certain pushes and characters, one day you will probably need it
---
I dont like your negativity
---
I say this whenever someone potato clutches: you won the round. That’s all that matters.
---
Vigil got some crazy nen
---
Mach speed tbag
---
I just posted his Russian Partner Tsarista!!
---
She don’t need a mag. She’ll just bare hand beat down ace the enemy team.
---
Do as I say, not as I do
---
Thanks
---
Bruh ur just a salty pc player
---
monty in the vending machine - what will he buy?
---
A nice Ak 74 or 10x with ZenitCo furniture, an AS VAL or VSS, a Gorza, a ASH12.7 or more realistically a Bizon or PP2000 submachine gun
---
Prime example
---
La Casa De Papel.
---
Imagine that you are the wall
---
The time glaz was one of the best operators🙌
---
That's low ranks though, there are plenty of pc players just like that
---
If you want to complain about R6 at least look at the blog posts Ubi puts out about top bugs and player concerns. They have been updating on how they want to fix client side debris for a little over a year now. They are working on it and it’s targeted for Y5S1
---
This is about as old as they get in terms of vault spots
---
The elite skin one imo
---
Fragile Pc players
---
Just log in today and you’ll get it
---
Yes it's for typing /\/igga(er)
---
Their are so many guns in r6 that have only 1 or two custom weapon skins and the rest are universal skins. Which sucks because you have no variety with how you want your op. Example: Vigils K27 it has 3 custom skins the tiger one, Alloy and the fucking Team Liquid skin (which is $2.50)
---
Like, just load up the siege main menu?
---
Why won’t they just put an option to remove it in settings?
---
Nope plat 3. Even console diamonds will whiff like this from time to time. That’s just the way it is if you have a controller. Console gamers are not worse than pc gamers BUT console *gameplay* is significantly worse.
---
Look at the bottom of the screen
---
So a better Nøkk? Did you even think this through?
---
yo, you want uhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHhHhH chips.
---
Isn’t this just nokk?
---
Whatever you think is best because it is a subjective topic of discussion.
---
Damn bro I didn’t even know this existed. Seems useless as hell honestly.
---
Be a Caveira main.
---
To remove debris?
---
Will do!
---
I like how he is a Raider, not much else though
---
Hello fellow operators. I, too, carry my weapon by the front of the barrel with the buttstock behind me.
---
Bruh she straight thiccer than Ela
---
Yeah we know
---
I would state my opinion on this matter, but there really isn’t any point.
---
The Ka skin is nice in my opinion.
---
All I’m seeing is a redditor being a massive jerk in comments. T bagging is gonna happen, grow some skin and shrug it off. Toxicity can be minimized but it’s not going to go away. So simply accept that, work with devs on REASONABLE options and ignore the the toxic behaviors that are going to slip thru.
---
Sledge or Thatcher.
---
If I'm having an off day with my shooting I usually revert back to them.
---
Easy to control weapons and they are usable on every map.
---
I had this experience when I got her too, back in the glitch where she could shoot with her shield out
---
Yes
---
Macie Gay.
---
Not trying to steal your thunder (wasn’t really skill anyways) but my first ace was with none other than Tachanka. 
---
It was one of my first rounds and I had no idea what I was doing. Just happened to set up in the right spot and wiped out a whole squad from behind as they rushed in to fast.
---
Who gives a fuck, quit being a baby it's a video game
---
The ideas are interesting but kali already serves a identical purpose to scorch while your defender is really just an Inferior version of lesion of you look into it. Lesion has almost no restrictions on where he can place his gadget, it's invisible, Slows the enemy to a crawl, makes them vulnerable in order to deal with it, hurts them, Insta kills downed opponents, it makes a loud trigger noise and lesion knows the location of each one in addition to being able to deploy several more then the trip wires
---
*spoopy Portuguese laughing ensues*
---
I give a fuck. The only babies here is you trash who Tbag! Go fuck horse you little fucking cunt
---
On another account I was making a lot of clips about Starcraft 2 esport plays from twitch, is it fine to post some good moments from r6 esport plays on this subreddit?( I really love this game) or it can be posted only on /r/R6ProLeague? thanks
---
I feel your pain
---
Probably a hit on Blitz’s ear muffs
---
Lol this post actually made me laugh
---
This is the way
---
I’ve heard she’s pretty good though.
---
To give a bit more overview of the trick; Each board on a single door barricade consists of three equal sized sections. As long as you hit a board at the point where two of those sections meet, and don't hit the board too high or too low, you'll knock out six sections in one go. This is the amount of boards needed knocked out to vault through a single door barricade.
---
That last kill really got me going. Bosco truly is Bosgoat.
---
We’re you using a vpn?
---
What’s your hard drive storage at?
---
Completely disagree on the 3 armor thing. That’s a sure fire way to make an attacker terrible. Ever wonder why fuze is so bad even though he has one of the best primaries in the game?

I know that buying op packs doesnt change the price if you own one of the ops before so I would assume it's the same

Ive had this happen before and u think it might be a glitch from rook plates or sumtin

Hey hey. I take it your like to team up? Haha

Nani desu ka

I like the gadget idea but I feel he hasn’t too much utility. I feel like it should only be on of those to keep him more on the balanced side. Idk if you ever played the Medal of Honor games ( I believe it was MoH that had these, someone correct me if I’m wrong) but there was a cluster grenade called the v40 mini cluster. Basically 3 mini grenades you would throw at once. If it was something like that it would be a little more balanced imo. Either smokes or frags. But I love the gun ideas
---
She used to be but at the moment she's not great to be honest.
---
The recoil on her SMG makes it basically unusuable and they just nerfed the hell out of her shotgun.
---
Nice job
