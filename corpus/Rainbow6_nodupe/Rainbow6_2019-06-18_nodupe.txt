If it makes you feel any better, Ubi just removed half (21 this season, 20 in year 3) of all existing legendaries currently in alpha packs this latest season update.

This chart is very accurate and I believe it's data, unless someone shows me proof of them getting a legendary that contradicts it.

---
---
What do you guys think of the waffle cone skin personally one of my favs rn!!!
---
How-
---
How did you get out? It's not possible.
---
Thats a few good ones! I used to play as Glaz a lot so thats a pretty major nerf for him. With electric hatches that probably makes Thatcher a lot more popular. Gutted Ash lost the Acog! I loved Ash!
---
No people hit ubi servers when they're on defense so the attackers cant move, then it clears up on defense.
---
Ok, wasn't aware of that, thanks for the info
---
I heard a game reset usually works. If not, im not sure buddy.
---
Thats the main issue a lot of players have. Communication and team play will take you way further that you could wvee get on your own.
---
Amazing how many people see "Girlfriend, pee pee, right now."
---
Your welcome.
---
How do you get the bottom skin
---
No, you‚Äôre probably straight ass on console. I mean, if you were any good, why would you have to use keyboard and mouse? Without cheating you‚Äôre probably just a low rank shitter. Play the game fair, loser.
---
What surface is your mouse on there?
---
When I'm playing manhunt and ask someone if they're it.
---
Epic
---
Silver 2 three seasons in a row now.....
---
yeah MP7 recruit with wire and C4 is as good as ela or vigil honestly, especially now that they buffed the MP7 and Nomad's ARX iron sights.
---
You got ddosed
---
That must be the new blind operator
---
the origin has nothing to do with it
---
Mate I'm 1w and 4L and I was gold 2 last season
---
As a UK player it‚Äôs almost fruitless to solo queue as most people on the EU servers seem to be french or Spanish etc. I haven‚Äôt even bothered to enter voice chat if the people in it are foreign.
---
He just said microsoft cant you read?
---
Ubisoft has explicitly said that keyboard and mouse on console is cheating...just because it doesn‚Äôt break the console TOS, doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be considered cheating.
---
Totally agree. Cav loses her advantage against someone who drones well, and Gridlock is amazing. I was skeptical of her when she was announced, like ‚Äúoh she sounds kinda awful.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong, her gadget is so versatile
---
Their whole team should be banned
---
Tachanka lowkey bigger than the rest üëÄ as it should be
---
Pretty much what I do as well except I‚Äôll generally keep my mic on and make some call outs.  You know...  in the hopes that someone else will do the same and also not be a dick.
---
It's saved a fair few plants for me, nobody seems to use the spot so nobody bothers to check it or prefire it.
---
Same here, doing the best to help the team yet they keep dying in less than 1min after the round starts
---
My trio reported them all and I can only hope the two we paired up with did too
---
I‚Äôm having it too, as is every friend I‚Äôve asked about it. Think everyone is affected by it. From what we experienced you get the packs the next time you load up the game
---
I thought Cav countered Jackal? The only problem with situational operators is that it is likely that situation just doesn't ever arrive. Warden has been out for a week and I've seen his gadget being effective maybe once or twice, despite him being played virtually every single game. In Fighting games situational characters (counter picks) work because you know who your opponent is going to play and therefore the match-up and their general gameplan, in Siege you don't know nuthin. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
With there being an unlimited amount of variables when it comes to team comp and objective, there's almost never a reason to pick a situational operator unless you're absolutely certain you can hard read what the enemy is going to do. But even if your foresight is correct and the enemy runs a team of all flashbangs and smokes, Warden is still worthless because he's going to be outgunned. As you die you're going to think to yourself that it would've been nice to run Doc with that MP5 and 140 hp.
---
Like it  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
You should ask it
---
Why do characters get banned?
---
Overrated: cav  underrated: echo
---
Every other game is like this now lol, even in Plat 3 you‚Äôll get people stressing the servers
---
What skin is on the gun?
---
I was plat this season but some server stresses and keyboard and mouse cheaters kicked me out of it
---
I fear no man, but that thing, it scares me.
---
They added new achievements and you may not have achieved them yet, or they might just be slow to update.
---
Can I kill someone by shooting them in the face with his launcher?
---
I've been silver for 10 seasons in a row. At least I'm consistent.
---
Deserved ban every time still don‚Äôt know why ubi thought adding him was a good idea .. look at my reddit username lmao
---
I see! Thanks for the info dude!
---
üòÜ
---
On my next T-Hunt on Villa, same location, Vigil and Ela snapped at each other almost like they remembered this;
---
Vigil: "Try not to die this time."
---
Ela: "Don't push me."
---
This hit to close to the heart man. \*sniffs\*
---
I don't have 1000 hours but same happened to me
---
And monty
---
Hey im Ps4 also gold IV also if you want someone else to squad up with
---
If you ever have a chance, check out some YouTube tips for buck. Kaosx has a few videos showing how to get the most out of him,  as well as Get_Flanked I believe.
---
F
---
yeah i obviously showed in the video that i play casual. wasn't bragging or anything
---
Holy shit this should be the real thing. Amazing work!
---
Why don't you get smoke then?
---
Ok thank you lots
---
i did deal with it i just think its stupid XD
---
Tell me... did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?
---
I agree I dont see an op that need a rework besides the lord, and I hated the re-used guns. It makes the operators less unique.
---
I personally think favela is one of the worse maps
---
Thats not how matchmaking works, the algorithm takes all the ranks into consideration when putting together a match.
---
Smurfing is the issue here, not the match making. Thats why the diamond is on bottom.
---
me telling a joke is being a asshole got it
---
a fiat is italian üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
almost certainly smurfs.
---
i know its a privite business i was just pointing out the idiocy

Haha racial slur is a funny joke guys EPIC WIN
---
XD rawr hee hee i say slurs XD RAWR owO
---
Never been interested I suppose. Not my style
---
i feel like claymores give her away tho. her ability is a modified vigil/cavi, so her staying in a spot for too long or leaving tracks, isnt her playstyle
---
haha ubisoft don't let me say racist slur IDIOTS
---
As understandable as that is, I personally don't feel as helpless as hereford
---
You are by yourself making this political. Don‚Äôt.
---
Look how they massacred my boy...
---
Let me put it in some terms. 
---
Let's say you want to sell cookies. In order to make the cookies you want yourself you need to buy a mixer. You don't own a mixer and buying an industrial mixer costs 600 dollars which you can't afford. Plus the needed maintenance to keep using it. 
---
Now you have a friend who does own a mixer. But this is a business so he can't let you borrow it for free. Instead he asks you to pay 20 dollars Everytime you need to use it. This is well within your budget AND because you don't own the mixer it's his job to keep up maintenance. 
---
You now have the peace of mind of having not to worry about maintenance of a mixer and your friend can actually make a profit off his mixer by renting it out. 
---
Ubisofts game is the cookies. And the servers are the mixers. Ubisoft sells alot of cookies. So much so they need more mixers to keep up demand so they rent more mixers. It's now at a point where it's more efficient for them to just keep paying to rent mixers than it is to buy their own.
---
Ever heard of an app b4?
---
because the left value censorship of anyspeech that is remotly connected to certain terms and ubisoft is well in there rights to do this but its is still kinda of a stupid cause for a perma ban
---
Thatcher doesnt really turn off any real lighting in the map . It only turns off a select few lighting sources but the overall lighting in the map is already "baked" into the map.
---
The current game engine and the game is not made for massive dynamic lighting changes in the middle of the match.
---
?
---
How is it idiocy?
---
I'm not understanding.
---
I know about all of that and I explained it to my brother, just thought of it as a neat concept
---
This was made by my friend in our discord and said I could post it here
---
Needs a touch up on the neck but otherwise it's pretty good!üëç
---
Just notice the Maverick hole. However, I do not  agree with comparing these players with other console players. They are not bad because its console, they are bad because they are copper rank.
---
Thank you very much ! And if you want to see my work on other animation, go here : [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCwjXnEhoy8UIbx4wA4u\_g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCwjXnEhoy8UIbx4wA4u_g) 
---
There is one with Ash, Fuze, Hibana and Glaz !
---
am plat. can confirm. we permaban monty unless we have a specific target ban for the opposing team. On defense we typically ban echo or mira, although sometimes we play either.
---
I WOULD agree with this  
---
But I run out to place traps and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that after 10 seconds because they would be to close.  I would never spawn peek
---
But a evil eye outside, a frost mat outside, or even a kapkan trap outside is very unexpected and can get easy kills
---
Its a completely different game made by a different dev team, using different gameplay and its a coop game focusing on a story.  
---
Just cause its a rainbow game that uses siege operators doesnt mean it can be added as a DLC into a 4 year old game. especially not &lt;$30
---
*sorry i dont speak acog*
---
*sad weeb noises*

You sir, deserve a sub.

I'm fine with the reused guns the operators should be played for their weapons, should be based off gadget. But I do understand the reused weapons was a bad idea but I dont mind it let's me show off my fmg black ice on attack lol

---
If you‚Äôve played him in bomb then you know how amazing he is. A fantastic gun with an acog, possibly the best plant denier in the game,  even better when you factor in callouts, Echo isn‚Äôt getting banned every game for no reason.
---
No he's not
---
Edgy eh?
---
I sweat in Casual because I like to win :/
---
I‚Äôll still meme but that doesn‚Äôt preclude me droning or hoping my team holds angles when we have the advantage.
---
Good luck getting anyone in ranked to watch them
---
I only do it with attack first. But it works so well
---
This is fucking amazing
---
Prob the best they could do is have it on the same timeline and have some aspects of each game transferred over like operators on Quarantine joining the seige community and vise versa.
---
When I first started playing, people were too scared to go outside. Real gamers.
---
man Roberts a hardass

I recolored plats and diamond [https://imgur.com/a/jihD4ps](https://imgur.com/a/jihD4ps)

Cazh in a nutshell
---
get with the meta noob
---
Killed Twitch, downed Maverick, Ash killed Blitz, turning on reverse damage, shot Hibana and killed herself, and then you knifed the Hibana who missed a knife on you üòÅ
---
What‚Äôs the deal with Jackel getting banned now? Before I would rarely even see Jackel getting picked. But I did stop playing for almost a year now.
---
You missed
---
lmao did you do a little doodle on Echo‚Äôs hair?
---
new op leak?
---
maybe
---
You should reevaluate your values. Don't be surprised when people think you are racist when you act like a racist.
---
Clash
---
it was bad probs gonna delete
---
What the heck
---
Glitch
---
When tachanka becomes an attacker
---
Dickbutt
---
you missed his head, you hit his neck and went left towards his earpiece. headgear isnt a hitbox
---
Real R6 Conspiracies
---
I switched over to playing casual. Don't want to go into ranked and then possibly only have one chance to play attacker after 3 losses.
---
Poot monty mains
---
All I thought of was the spider man meme but that is crazy weird...
---
Goodbye shitter you won't be missed burn in hell with montagne
---
you can tell a team is bad if they ban blitz. blitzs coodown timer makes him almost useless, and a coordinated pinch is a ez clap for him
---
As twitch i do my best to give mozie my empty drones. I cant think of anything less helpful than a drone that can't jump that my team is aware of being mozzies lol
---
There‚Äôs a chance you can get two or more of the same operator if you press the random button at the same time as your teammate.
---
jackal is balanced, but he is a annoyance to roamers. hes usually banned
---
Like the lava skin oh wait
---
Figured it out, I knocked ash then shot someone behind her where she was then revived by a finka

Heard the charge and knew it couldn‚Äôt go that far back :). Had he thrown better probably would‚Äôve been screwed but he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to throw that far back without exposing himself to my teammate that was big window
---
a cheater who throws? pls elaborate. youll lose elo no matter what
---
Impossible, echo doesn‚Äôt exist in ranked anymore.
---
Last week I played a 2v5 and after losing elo on that I slowed down on playing a lot.
---
Hi diddly ho repostorino
---
Clash and cav got banned
---
Is that nintendo switch echo is holding?
---
I see what you're saying and I understand that it can get boring.... but why not just use the ops that you havent played instead of being FORCED to?
---
As a new player, I find pick and ban insanely frustrating, especially when I just spent 20k to buy a new op and I cant even fucking use it.
---
It makes me not want to play ranked at all.... which in turn forces me to play casual, which I get placed in high skill games and I die in 30 seconds, which doesn't allow me any time to get better or hone certain skills... 
---
It's vicious spiral towards not playing R6 at all.
---
Usually a clutch is anything from a 1v2 to a 1v4. An ace is when you get all 5 kills regardless of the amount of teammates you have alive. An ace clutch is a 1v5.
---
What's this about?
---
She cant hack his yokais
---
No I don‚Äôt keep them or no I don‚Äôt have to buy them since I already bought the pass?
---
Should of clutched üòé

You kinda runed the word "messed", just so you know.
---
The people who do it on purpose just want to upset people for fun or they're just mad
---
No
---
Only time I do it is to friends when we're in a party (Xbox)
---
* laughs in Season Pass * 
---
Seriously though I understand your thought. Season 4 is the first time I got the Season pass but when since Season 2 I've really enjoyed the grind. I understand your frustration but the way I see it you're constantly improving your skills just i reach the price of a new op. Think about it. You play amd grind and once you have a new op you're already way better than before. Sure ut may seem outrageous or tedious but I think its worth it. Just to unlock 3 ops when I first started playing I went from noob to silver 4 to Gold 1. And it felt rewarding to have new op to kearn amd disect.
---
Some sacrifices must be made for the greater good. Sadly Fuze had to be one of them. And on Kanal too, ouch.
---
Yeah that's a big part of my problem is hardly any of my friends play siege, and those that do are either on PC or PS4.
---
Thatcher and termie
---
It's fine being sneaky but her gun is a nerf gun so when it's a straight up gunfight you'll pretty much always lose unless you're a headshot machine
---
Thats not how it works you can flip a coin (50/50) and have it land on the same side ever time and it pure luck that that happened
---
What is it it made of?
---
Wait, what happend to echo?
---
I think sledge is b tier because he basically infinite breaching charges, and it's a little bit quieter. Byw his ar is bae
---
That‚Äôs racist you can‚Äôt say the n-word
---
Unfortunately there isn't much you can do about it. Kicking for stupid reasons is just something that happens and people have to deal with. I don't condone it, but there isn't anything you can do. Best thing to do is just relax and move on, find another match and get back to it.
---
Sorry though dude. It's really stupid when people punish you for not being the ultimate player. Never understood why people want to ruin the experience for others like that.
---
So why not have 2 ranked modes?
---
Pro-League, try-hard, big-daddy-pants players who have played since thr beginning should go to pick and ban ranked.
---
All of us who need to be placed with players with similarly lower skill sets should go to regular ranked matches.
---
Either that or completely revamp the match making in casual becuase I get put up against plat 3's in casual.
---
Each instance is independent from the last instance. So every roll is a flip of a coin whether you attack or defend. While improbable, it is entirely possible that you get 40 consecutive attacks.
---
Nope
---
Is there the chance you'll make a 1920x1080 version so we can have a dope siege background for the pcmr
---
You get to keep them when they‚Äôre released for non season pass holders
---
There is a visual bug where some/new packs arnt shwon in the main menu. When you restart the game it resync with the servers and shows the current amount.
---
No but random also means that it‚Äôs random so expected result may be 25-25, but actual result could be way off. It is possible, just highly highly unlikely. Also think of it this way. Every game is a 50/50 chance, so u have just gotten the same one every time
---
God please no
---
I've seen this raw strength only once before.
---
Only options is to play with at least 1 friend, or get aces every round. 
---
Keep at it.
---
DAMN, thats sick as fuck!
---
All the operators you get off the year passes are yours forever. You dont have to buy the operators, the early access is just a bonus for pre purchasing the operators via the pass.
---
but clash was in for a day in phantom sight
---
Shot the goggles not the head
---
Human greed.
---
You are me
---
I am now happy
---
Jackal &amp; Bandit
---
Okay impossible no, but the chances of that happening are almost 0, look up expected values when it comes to randomness its legit statistics 101
---
q and e or the analog sticks while aiming
---
in public, an orange tip won't stop people from freaking out. if he's an airsofter (especially one that has such a rare gun like the FPG) He knows not to transport the gun at all unless it's entirely out of view of the public in a gun case or bag or blanket.
---
1. Recoil still goes up
---
2. Leaning makes sure you expose as little of your body as possible
---
it was surely an honist mistake and all but you misspelled "ruined"
---
Well I was asking why would someone lean because the recoil would go diagonally instead of straight up
---
it doesn't
---
Ok thank you!!!
---
Clothing isn‚Äôt part of the hitbox
---
Almost 0 out of the thousands that play this game. You're the outlier, my friend. I took statistics too, which is why I can understand that it is possible, and it did indeed happen.
---
This looks like a Marvel movie poster haha.
---
She just thanos snapped dude
---
For the low damage of that gun I‚Äôd be ok with it exclusively for her
---
In on console I doubt my tips would help ya haha
---
It's better than outright banning you for having a cheater in the lobby tho, even if he wasn't squared with you
---
I see you are a man of culture with that R32 sheer beauty.
---
Comfort ban and tactical ban, honestly. (Per the Get_Flanked video). Echo is by far one of the best defenders.
---
Oh god oh f**k.
---
I got back to the game without even playing ranked (wasn't able to play since psplus) and as soon as i was in COPPER 4.
---
Flair checks out.
---
I am also on consol
---
This bug is from Y1... we're in Y4

i was trying to actually get tips

rip
---
#bug #fixthis #relatable #notoverusing #cringe #heheheh
---
B happens a lot to me
---
this joke is geting pretty unfunny now but I think you mean "over".
---
For some reason this works
---
It is almost every game.
---
Thatcher mains be like WhY yOu bUlLy mE
---
Might have just been pure luck. Even I have made some pretty sus kills.
---
don‚Äôt say the f word around me please
---
This isn‚Äôt Instagram or Facebook you twat. No need to hashtag.
---
I have the middle memory for his gun. Iwgat really help me with him was to use the holo scope and always lean when shooting even if they are in front of me. I cannot handle his gun when not leaning
---
Technically yes, however expect the same operators to get consistently banned in pick and ban
---
Chill man sometimes stuff like that happens we can only hope that people become smarter good luck in the future mah dude
---
Gridlock isn‚Äôt so bad because I stay with my teammates for the most part with her but since the point of N√∏kk is to hunt down roamers and lurk around the map it‚Äôs a whole other story. I can roam just fine for the most part as a defender but as an attacker with an SMG? It‚Äôs hard as hell. The 3 difficulty rating for her is no joke. I wanna get good with her because if the enemy team bans Jackal then N√∏kk is gonna be one of the few options for roam clear.
---
Bob Ross approves this message.
---
Noice
---
lol cav ban... only low ranks play cav in ranked
---
Yeah, I've been playing here religiously to master her, I'm getting her placements almost right, but I can't seem to get a positive win Delta with her.
---
A living Echo, can't clutch if you a) don't know where they are b) can't plant
---
I actually enjoy Hereford so much. Or rather I don't find myself audibly groaning, imagining the pain to come as I do for Theme Park and Fortress.
---
This is silver lol, nobody plays her but she‚Äôs always banned.
---
Rightly said. Fmg in proper, competitive play, against most attackers, if you miss the head, it's hard. It's fine overall, but gets hard in heated combat.
---
And GL ain't bad at all. She's just a little harder.
---
During the game I was just in, I
---
was the only one on my team that even had kills, but I didn‚Äôt clutch a 1v5, so I got kicked. Cool. Lol, people get so butthurt on this game.
---
Dirttyyyyy i like it... If it was me you peaked i couldn't have even been mad.
---
 In case you were wondering, the reason i was so careful when breaking the barricade is bcuz when you dont break the glass its harder to see that its broken, im pretty sure.
---
PC needs a screen like this
---
Many of those bronzes or coppers were smurfs too
---
Hmmm.....you ain't wrong. As long as he can't run with shield up it shouldn't be a problem.
---
But we've had FBI 2 speed shield recruit before and apparently it was hell.
---
You could also play casual and just f\*\*\* around with friends. Play for fun, play as operators you rarely use. This will at least keep your skills from atrophying to much.
---
It's an enigma
---
Would go great with this charm of a (literally) 6 inch banana i got called "for scale"
---
As an ex-soloqueuer, I can understand. It's just through communication and in-game encouragement that we got together as a proper squad now.
---
It is designed to promote more coordinated play, after all.
---
Thank you, after that i preceded to get two kills with the shotgun and then another keratos kill but i couldnt secure the ace
---
Thing is spy is the worst class in tf2
---
I get your point but still...why not ban two of those ops rather than just one and cav?  Why not ban echo and doc instead of echo and cav?  Or echo and someone else.  Sure with solo q teammates it‚Äôs difficult but those ops are most certainly worse.
---
Ok thx.
---
Kind of vague explanation. That could be like 20 different things. Hopefully it passes by.
---
r/lostredditors
---
The time taken for you to pull the bolt, reload, and fire is more than 200ms, enough time to kill you, and mind you, 200 is the average TTK of defenders on attackers.
---
Anything that takes longer than 200 to land the second shot is pathetic. And you can't make a bolt quicker than 200ms.
---
Yeah it was on Amazon

Hello Samtheman0425, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c1y0ak/can_i_play_this_game_without_having_a_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Everytime I play Doc
---
Maybe I'm just full of shit lol. I swear for me it felt higher in hel mode. Wierd
---
And recruit aint in ranked):
---
Lol it‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôve had moments like that several times in this game. Understandable since it‚Äôs very complex.
---
Maybe this will help
---
This is what every muzzle attachment does for recoil 
---
Suppressor- nothing 
---
Muzzle brake- reduces first shit recoil (use on single fire weapons)
---
Compensator- reduces recoil of automatic fire 
---
Flash suppressor- increases the speed at which your weapon goes back to its default stance. This doesn‚Äôt help with recoil at all, but if your burst firing, your weapon comes back down faster allowing you to burst fire quicker without having to readjust your aim as much 
---
So overall just use compensator with automatic weapons and muzzle brake with any single fire weapons. 
---
And each gun is a bit different, like twitches f2 the gun used to have a larger recoil on the second shot (changed now) or bucks assault rifle is also still a bitch to control. Hop into a custom match and just practice with the guns, try to flick, get al the bullets within a one another, etc
---
I‚Äôd agree but every now and again the hero must be shot
---
You mean people who play competitively in leagues and shit? I do it too, I find it a lot more rewarding and competitive than ranked.
---
Why would anyone want to listen to music playing siege

They are sending a lot of traffic to your router or something like that, it takes quite a lot of resources and highly illegal, and isn‚Äôt usually done for a large period of time

I font kniw i just find it easier than the other MP5s  and i used to play more doc than echo

I think that most people really don't know how to properly use Ash to her full potential. Usually I see people Ash charge the first door they see and die as they enter it. Smart Ash players would use it to open LoS to obj to get quick kills before the enemy player realizes what's going on. That's why there's a timer for the charge on impact to set the player to shoot as it detonates. Same goes with barbwire and traps.
---
This is completely opinion base with me and people should use Ash however they want.

Its a Negav with a acog

Casual or ranked? If it‚Äôs casual, suck it up, leave and join a different game, if it‚Äôs ranked, then f in chat

Don't think cold will pop Mira tank. What about blocking her view? I mean it make ice the surface uneven so it will be blurry. The Mira will also destroyed in 3 melee hit instead, even though its bullet proof it's still a glass.
---
I think it should also destroy the wooden wall for reinforced one? I mean it's better for the attacker and I know the purpose is to counter attacker but I feel it better when wooden wall also get destroyed. Also instead of echo ( Those thing didn't create that strong of wave) what about nitro? Nitro will deal normal damage calculation + extra from shattered frozen metal?
---
Also Electricity should destroy the tank and make it pour on the floor and only splashed the tank to prone height?
---
How much elo did you lose

Yeah I'm learning new things almost every match I play, pretty sweet!

That‚Äôs just the most recent wave of hacks I believe, they can now move like a 10 speed and no clip through any walls/floors
---
Well ubi will make a strong operator and nerf them accordingly that's how they work
---
Then according to your definition, Overwatch also makes sense as the enemy team obtains a resource known as ult charge. Even in CSGO, giving away $300 and a AWP is giving the enemy a huge economic boost.
---
It's not that the term doesn't make sense, it is that it becomes far fetched and more distant to the original meaning. You should not gatekeep a term popularised by MOBAs.
---
I doubt it. IIRC the Dragunov uses a 7.62 x 54r cartridge with probably 2500+ ft/s muzzle velocity on a 180gr pill. The .50 Beowulf (12.7x42) has a much lower muzzle velocity with a wider cross sectional area meaning the energy is dissapated faster, even if it *might* carry more energy depending on how hot it's loaded. I don't know the numbers on .50 Beowulf but I'd assume energy is close enough that the fat, flat nosed (or expanding tip) rounds will just splatter all over the surface of a target giving it much less penetration than the FMJ round the Dragunov is firing.
---
Then your team is the problem here, they are holding YOU back.
---
Give them a pep talk, say "hey guys/gals, we gotta work together and communicate if we want a chance at making plat."
---
Motivate them but also show them THEIR faults.
---
If they don't want to make an effort to better themselves, find a new squad.
---
Glaz needed the nerf, he‚Äôs not an entry fragger.
---
As much as I dislike Blackbeard that is not how I would change him. 
---
Warden does need more functionality, but I think it‚Äôd be better if his goggles weren‚Äôt on a timer and instead blurred when shot like jackals to deter people from having them on 24/7.
---
You're still able to blow Kaid electrified hatches just by placing your charges on the floor beside them. I doubt they'll do anything about this.

But consider even simply Border. SOMEONE is gonna do breach denial in the balcony. You can just toss an Emp? Yeah, unless they are doing Bandit Trick. 
---
In this case you may want to play from below with Buck to make it easider for Thermite to move in. 
---
In this situation then, bring Thatcher could be a bit of a waste of utility. So you can just bring IQ and deal with all the threats you need AND destroy the batteries, if he doesn't do the Trick but just place them. 
---
The same goes for many other situations.

Lesion instead of cav, monty instead of blitz

That's a solo que team in nutshell

Of course. 57h are not that much for these kind of games, you'll need hundreds of hours to really get the knowledge and mechanics to keep improving. Tension will gradually disappear.

Wtf is this allowed, wtf is that allowed

Know the feeling when this happens and you derank and get an abandon on your stats.
---
Okay thanks, one problem is, one of my irls, he is always a roamer, and tries to go and attack by himself, normally going wayyyyyy to slow on bomb since he‚Äôs mainly a secure player, I‚Äôm trying to get him to understand you can‚Äôt play by yourself, he understands the problem but he somehow ends up still doing it, We both know this hurts us. Any advice?
---

quick question what rank are you, why do you think pulse is b tier and jager is s tier?, and what kind of monster are you that rates tachanka e teir and what kind monster says e instead of f tier.

Why would Cardiac Sensor not detect her heartbeat when her and Vigil‚Äôs gadget works by removing their visual from video cams?

These are highly underrated and easily overlooked, it's such a shame. You've done a really good job capturing a theme with this. Hopefully we'll see another one soon!!!!
---
DELETE THIS POST NOW, I'VE BEEN USING THIS METHOD FOR A LONG TIME AND DONT WANT THE ENEMY TEAM DOING IT TO ME
---
this trick has been here for years lol
---
They kinda are though, Echo and Monty are objectively good bans, a good Monty/Echo player can really change the result of a match. Cav and Blitz on the other hand are very easy to deal with when there is even a small semblance of coordination and communication within the team.  You reference pro league, Cav isn't ever played in pro league, maybe once in a blue moon, and Blitz is also almost never play for the same reason as Cav, they are easy to deal with in a coordinated team.  At higher levels, plat-diamond, players are much more likely to be in a stack, be it 5-,4-,3-stack, than in the lower ranks, and as such Cav and Blitz are redundant bans, as the team shouldn't have to many problems dealing with them.
---
Yea I Had a ranked game the other day where the enemy team only had 1 guy right from the start.
---
What? Her ability doesn‚Äôt last long enough to be too strong and her weapons work fine if you well, shoot people in the head. Granted they‚Äôre not top tier guns but if you‚Äôre taking an entire magazine to kill someone then you‚Äôre just missing.
---
this is part of the blast radius, can't reeeealy be stopped because that would be a change in the mechanics of the game
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Please explain so I can celebrate with you
---
Personally I play casual before or inbetween ranked matches to warm up and stay warmed up infor ranked. 
---
And sadly I need to tryhard and do the best I can to win so that I don't go rusty.
---
I‚Äòve first seen it in proleague on villa like half a year ago. The main reason was to deny impact tricking above the wall more than outmaneuvering an electrified wall.
---
I'm fast as fuck
---
So play ranked, nobody LFGs casual because why would you?
---
Because these players are too scared to play their ranked rank they were carried to
---
I dont think nokk will ever get acog on fmg, because then smoke needs to be a 3 armour.
---
(Phone keyboard doesnt have o/)
---
Depends if you have the support of the team behind you. 
---
If you have someone on cams feeding you and that your team opened rotation in the prep phase. J√§ger will be your best pick. 
---
Otherwise vigil. For impacts and avoiding being droned out. 
---
Consider alibi as well.

Being a low ranked player, i will give you some insight. We cant play vs Echo either

The difference between defending and attacking.
---
This is really good! Did you trace the basic outline then fill? Or did you use a reference photo for the whole thing?
---
Thank you next can you get my acog back plz
---
Oh dear god yes, inject this directly into my veins please. Get ready to yee those haws, partners.
---
Oh, so he finished all the achievements
---
Correct
---
That‚Äôs why people shootout the floor next to walls sometimes
---
Yeah, but Blitz has become one of those operators who has to have everything go right for him for him to be good, and now with warden he's practically useless. And that sucks to say because he is one of my favorites to play.
---
BOMBE
---
SIMPLE

I somehow already had most of them after the new trophies, but I was so close to getting the OG platinum trophy! üóøü§£

None taken. I just thought he knew his shit because he has over 1k hours played :P
---
This has been in game since release. Same with the Basement hatch trick (why some Defenses will tear the Classroom wall next to it down).
---
She can solo carry and picks apart bad team work/ communication.

This man deadass almost got the exact same tier list in my opinion.

Her ability is incredibly strong. So strong in fact she is the only attacker who has not only been given defender weapons but among the worst defender weapons and then asked to push in on attack.
---
It's the fact she has some of the worst weapons available and is told to attack with them when everyone else gets to defend. 
---
The silence alone is absurdly strong.
---
Unless you headshot you are likely to lose every engagement unless you get the jump.
---
I get its to offset her insane ability but when your ability only benefits you and doesn't impact the team or the objective offsetting it with terrible weapons for an attacker doesn't work.
---

Seems reasonable

I probably would‚Äôve done the same tbh, tracing never seems to work for me
---
‚ÄúThere was an idea...‚Äù
---
Bingo Bango Bongo
---
Understandable but it‚Äôs literally every single game where everyone is just sweating their ass off, I don‚Äôt think I played one match where it‚Äôs not like that recently
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a glitch where if the turret killed your team mates, it logs those team mates deaths to that enemy player, but if you a friendly equip the turret it gets confused and puts all the deaths on your character and since you get reversed for 2 kills it kills you
---
Could be wrong though
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
There is nothing wrong with japanese. Accept it
---
**Look how they massacred my boy**
---
It means he eats cheese danishes I think
---
I'm American, btw. I wouldn't mind it that much, but I obviously can't read the menus, which I can see causing issues in the future.
---
Of course you can. It's not about the console but the fact they both need servers.
---
If you launch the game through steam, from the properties panel
---
Can we just talk about the fact that Blitz is banned an unreasonable amount as well? It hurts me deeply.
---
Well making a new game engine takes a significant amount of time.
---
Would it not be better to re use and tweak an already existing engine like Snowdrop? Not sure if it support's Siege's level of destruction but it could work.
---
Honestly if they offered a discount for R6 Siege owners and the new game actually had more promise of support than Siege I'd consider it.
---
That said it's not gonna happen, Ubisoft will faster let this game die than actually spend a proper amount of resources fixing it's issues.
---
It makes sense tbh, every other Ubisoft game is mostly single player experience. Single players games don't require much upkeep and demands for fixes eventually die down as people go through the storylines, consume the product then most likely want more.
---
It's clear Ubisoft never expected Siege to take off like it did, they thought of it as just another one of their launch and forget until DLC time comes around games. Yet here we are, Ubisoft finaly has a MP game with a good following but did they want this?
---
Their developers are typically unburdened by the concept of proper bug fixing unless it's serious, this shows every time they attempt to fix an issue.
---
Then there is also the higher ups, when they can just push out a  new sequel to a franchise every year or so and it makes them bank why would they consider dumping any real money on a concept so unappealing to the brass as a MP PvP game.
---
They have long life spans, are harder to maintain than a SP game, have more needy players and their developers are inexperienced in the genre.
---
Yeah no, I have little hope for this game. Which is a shame because despite all it's faults, glitches, issues and fuckups I am addicted to it. Just this season (A week in) I already played 130+ games of Ranked.
---
How does Overwatch work?
---
You can ddos on console, but my 5 stack has also all lost connection before. I just think its the servers, pretty sure the other team all lost connection too.
---
probably thats why impact grenades come in a pack of two
---
they farm easy kills to boost their ego
---
If you are afraid to play rank because you might derank than chances are you probably don't belong in the current rank. Play with a 3+ stack may help increasing win rate
---
This still works? I taught this was patched a long time ago.
---
Better start learning
---
There is not set rules for things like this. Try watching some pro game play and just play ton of bomb casual to feel for it
---
Yes check my profile I uploaded a post a while back.
---
It looks like I'm never playing Echo again in ranked.
---
The saddest lazy boi
---
To be fair, I shot my mate when he first played Nokk. In my defence, he snuck up behind me and I hadn‚Äôt actually seen Nokk in game yet and I shit myself. He only took one bullet though and my aim isn‚Äôt good enough to hit him in the head.
---
That's probably why Ying and Lesion haven't really changed, technically speaking they came out in season 3 with Ela, and Zofia did indeed come with season 4 alongside Dokkaebi and Vigil.
---
Might be why, if so next season will see 3 ops dip in price instead of 2.

banning both cav and jackal is counter intuitive but alright, big dick move

...Virginity?

this is literally dope
---
So does she suck or not? You keep contradicting yourself dude. One second it‚Äôs ‚Äúshe‚Äôs too strong, her ability makes her undetectable‚Äù and then it‚Äôs ‚Äúshe sucks, her guns do no damage and are unusable‚Äù.
---
It just sounds like you lack game sense, because if she‚Äôs sneaking up on you in the 10 seconds her ability is on then that‚Äôs on you; you need to learn where enemies come from instead of needing them to thunder up the stairs. Also it sounds like you could use some practice with the FMG because it‚Äôs really not that bad in comparison to what they could‚Äôve given her, there are plenty worse weapons. It barely recoils so if you‚Äôre aimed at the head it‚Äôs not like recoil is the issue. It‚Äôs your aim.

How come you dropping out of Siege is pushing you to sell so many other games you own?

I mean why would smoke also get it? Not like either will anyway
---
‚ÄúThe idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people..‚Äù
---
well it‚Äôs obviously it‚Äôs ment for the times Thatcher is not picked
---
That‚Äôs the point , i‚Äôm afraid to play ranked with matchmaked allies because i don‚Äôt know what is their current skill level , and I only got 1 friend to play with.
---
I don't know they came out late. Thanks.
---
Ill probably scrape together enough renown to buy them all by next season anyway.
---
You won‚Äôt get parts mate it‚Äôs long discontinued. What‚Äôs broken, as long as it‚Äôs not the body the internals are literally just a normal KWA Glock

Sounds about right. I dont usually play ranked. So in casual I try my best to win.

Don‚Äôt see where you make this judgement without seeing any of my arm
---
Damascas doesn't either on most new ops
---
Why is this better than some list by people that actually play the game
---
Yup
---
I thing that after they added the Pick and Ban feature the game is kind of ruined 
---
With the average player with 0% tactics and 100% CoD we are not going to use the full potential of the feature 
---
In my 10 classification matches only 2 got well and interestingly used bans like Bandit and Termite, Ash and Cav
---
The P&amp;B should be used to find or use different technique not eliminate the same useless operators or the one that you can‚Äôt handle, with Blitz you can just take it from behind or shot him in the legs while he‚Äôs pushing
---
But after all this is the R6 community and just like the devs I imagine that just a few can understand
---
Yo that is smart
---
The season just started you have plenty of time to drop and climb.  Unless you are one of those players that hit plat and quit ranked then tbh I don't see the problem.
---
Either make him a sniper ( lower the firerate / remove termal &amp; One Shot Kill on 3-2 Speed Def. Ops.  ) or leave him how he was ( allready low Pick rate + takes Time and Skill to Master) atm he is a rekrut with a semi auto rifle .
---
same thing happened to me. I even clipped it
---
This crashes your game? Hitting ALT and Enter at the same time brings it back to full screen for me.
---
This is really old, it may even be a bit smaller than it used to be
---
Nothing against you but i find this really unlikely
---
Oh you meant the operator bundle?
---
oof I thought it was an LMG like Zofia's
---
if you wanna ban a shield op. ban monty, that fucker is broken.
---
Yeah, hopefully.
---
So Airsoft ?
---
I have video. Im going to post it on youtube in 10 min
---
It's not unreasonable, that clonking piece of work should be banned 100% time
---
0:12 420 ;)
---
I mean Maestro was too slow anyways so the Austin Powers joke couldn't be done.
---
June 18th already, and there's still no Elite Lesion here.
---
it is become Epic Exclusive so I can't buy yet? Ubisoft
---
Yeah I mean even the real one of these never made it past prototyping. I‚Äôm pretty sure that there are more airsoft replicas than real examples in the world.
---
I know I whiffed on the first kill pretty bad.
---
Sweet. Keep up the work man cause it looks awesome!
---
Pocket sniper is back
---
Mostly its just really annoying to get pinged for half the round, regardless of how OP he is.
---
They should shorten the intervals and overall time the ability lasts.
---
Thanks man
---
All ANZ matches will be broadcast on the main Twitch channel it seems like.
---
On pc this is basically an insult: are you using a controller?
---
IIRC 1 gun 1 config because if engine limitations
---
I don't get it why are Blitz and Cav banned so often
---
monty is a legit ban. when even PL players think monty is broken, then maybe there is actually some truth to it. he really needs a hard counter, echo doesnt cut it.
---
We were on ps4
---
All the Clash Mains crying, including me

I think the reinforce breach ability should work only with Maverick,the rapid change in heat should break the reinforcement and take 1 whole makerick flame mag
---
So what your question
---
how long did it take for you to get it?
---
He can make you drunk for 15 secs and prevent plant.  What do you think? He also has invisible cameras that can move...
---
Are you using a controller is an insult on pc
---
Hmm hadn‚Äôt considered that. Maybe if they do decide in future to do more defender attacker crossover weapons they could make them slightly different like the Six12 and SIX12SD
---
For clarification, the netting helps break the silouette of a human (mainly the face, but also the neck and shoulders) which the brain is so good at spotting. Same concept as with Ghillie Suits but on a smaller scale. Not as heavy, hot or expensive.
---
Zofia.
---
I'm a If it's banned it's my main, main... I haven't been able to play who I enjoy in ranked since the new update
---
It's tea time!
---
Who bans blitz...
---
Whats your point
---
Yeah that is true but if I keep playing ranked eventually I will get less points and if I‚Äôm having a bad streak eventually it will be more difficult to gain what I‚Äôve lost , the only complain i got with this game is the fact that you keep getting less and less points .
---
I actually really like the new update because it‚Äôs forced me into new characters and forced my team to try out new ideas and strats. The only bit I dislike is the removal of recruit from ranked, because now we can‚Äôt have a whole team of M870s
---
Well they both have big fuck-off magazines, but finka‚Äôs is bigger
---
Vigil, bandit, and Jager because of their guns, Jager can also just leave his gadgets on sight and it will actually really help your team. Lesion is also very good because of a very helpful gadget for holding a particular area whilst roaming, and a great gun. Ela works well on very cramped maps.
---
What do you mean?
---
gold to is from 2900 to 3099 so 3099 is still gold 2 but 3100 is gold 1
---
I agree with you man , they should increase how long it takes him and blitz to Ads, lesion is a good counter to him though, clash too but we won‚Äôt talk about her
---
Is often open as a rotate for defenders and still funnels into the same doorway that is an almost guaranteed death if site hasn't been properly cleared yet.

FMG-9 and FMG-9001

Used to be a possibility

Usually you just need one roamer like cav, valk or vigil to cooperate. As a Clash main most of the time I am playing together with a buddy who mains those three as roamers, having me lure those guys into a death trap.
---
Always try to have rotations between the sites you always need an anchor so play opd like smoke echo maestro or even rook and doc will always be usefull then you should know where they are gonna push from at that isnt too different from Secure area
---
I think if there was an option to ban blitz four times then this would be taken. 
---
Not sure what else needs to happen for Ubisoft to actually do something about him.
---
With a controller your performance isn‚Äôt that good.
---
If I would play on console I would use a keyboard and a mouse, if possible
---
Most ridiculous bans I had:
---
Thatcher, Termite, Bandit and Kaid
---
I mean, breaching and playing Mute was fun
---
Rustle the mic a lil louder lol
---
Definitely the server being ddos
---
I didn't found the original creator, but this is the art i was inspired from

Hey! You might have missed it but the hard reset we used to have is replaced with a "soft" reset. 
---
Instead of a hard reset to 2500 people are now reset between 1500 and 3500 based on where they ended their previous season. 
---
Say you ended the previous season at 1800 MMR, you will now be placed at half the distance between 2500 and 1800. That's 350. So you would be placed at 2150 instead of 2500. 
---
This might not seem like a big change to you, but you have to remember that all gold and up players will now start above 2500 MMR and you won't face them during your placements.
---
This is what happens when you make every round Bomb, the ops that are annoying as fuck in bomb always get banned. I think I've played 2 ranked matches this season Echo didn't get banned in.
---
It's over 9000!
---
Lol yeah, was laying on my bed chest down during this clip
---
This gets me so mad as well, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre prioritising more content like map reworks and new operators over bug fixes. I understand that those two are handled by different aspects of the studio, but the bugs just keep getting worse, yet more and more buggy, broken content is still pushed out, piling up the bugs and game breaking glitches
---
Time travel!
---
You're kinda late to the party, but helpful for those who still don't know I guess that it's gone.
---
Red dot?
---
Why?
---
I gotta say that Siege has been 1000% more enjoyable without having to deal with Echo.
---
Even if you know how to play him you‚Äôre still fucked in most engagements if the other person isn‚Äôt a scrub. Blitz has the most broken hit boxes, I‚Äôve seen him get knifed through his shield or one shot through his shield countless times. On top of that the amount of people with impacts or c4 who see high pick rates is staggering. A well place impact knocks off more than a quarter of your health
---
Flair checks out
---
I always vote to ban Doc, especially if I‚Äôm attacking first
---
He was last alive as jackal had disconnected right as he was planting
---
I play him
---
Awww they're having an eye contact
---
galz already has 214 ttk and that works
---
cav, echo and maybe smoke
---
But why were you recording the tv?
---
[removed]
---
Bandit gets banned on consulate
---
So the reason was that you can clutch with tachanka but not as often?
---
You're welcome.
---
R32 &gt; any car
---
Every time
---
I use it
---
And I shred with it.
---
Ash does require some knowledge and positioning, knowing the game better than other brainless operators. IDK ABOUT BUCK THO UBI?
---
I think the more dedicated/nicer players moved on to ranked play. It‚Äôs a lot more structured.
---
**ITS BEAUTIFUL **
---
Sorry for quality, I don‚Äôt know how to take screenshots and all that sorta stuff.
---
they have ascended into an intelligence superior than all other evil eyes
---
I‚Äôm buying her today. Can‚Äôt wait to try her in ranked
---
true, but well, dire situations require dire solutions haha.
---
So in otherwords VERY situational agains certain types of players who only use their guns but never drones or communicate?
---
I have the same skin lol
---
I think you need a adapter
---
Solo queuing always was absolute trash
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt blame you for exploiting this game for what it is, we‚Äôve all done it
---
Anchoring does not mean you have to be stationary. It means you commit to a single area and defend it as much as you can. Anyone can achor really some OP's are better at it than others. An example being Lesion or Ela. 
---
Having an alarm system set up makes anchoring much easier. There are other approaches too. Mira is basically bound to be an Anchor for example with her Black Mirrors being superb for holding down pathways, it does not mean she cannot leave them and rely purely on her powerful Vector.
---
Rook and Doc are what your typical player thinks of first when they think Anchor and they are not wrong however while these two don't exactly have unique gadgets that help them hold an area off they do however have acogs and low recoil guns that help them challenge attackers at long and sharp angles without the use of shields. They are also a good combo gadget wise.
---
Mute is also a good anchor, kinda scary to peek around that room when every doorway and drone hole leading to it is jammed off.
---
I mean after the ones we dont know about
---
So true 7 wins 12 losses solo q with a 1.4 k/d placing me in bronze
---
WALLET WARRIORS ASSEMBLE
---
In silver/low gold they don't tend to watch the hatch unless it gets thatchered, so you can catch them off guard more often than not
---
What region you on? I‚Äôm on eu and the shit on there is weird, I usually get 9 ping but recently I‚Äôve been getting 50 still playing the same but people with 9 ping seem to be lagging out more.
---
Enemy team smells like broke
---
Valkyrie should be an insta ban in my opinion at mid ranks (like myself). 
---
Most of us can‚Äôt find all of the super sneaky spots those cams go in. Thus making spawn peaking a bitch.
---
Yo I have that same key board
---
Or a honey badger
---
What the fuck is this?
---
The pure mastery of the editing makes me feel acomplished to unlock a character and I feels epic as hell
---
Welcome to APAC servers.
---
And Blitz is a 3 difficulty! Like what??!
---
So.. it‚Äôs raw
---
"So how's that new pasta factory doing?"
---
Nibbas attacking first n banning jackal smh
---
Real man sends the profile link
---
CLARIFY: this is just a option that I found. Obviously you can break to while looking down haha
---
That's why you open the wall next to that hatch in oregon
---
Nice job dude. I'm curious, has this trick ever shown up in pro league?
---
Casually play rank...
---
Nah tower And theme park are worse than both Bartlet and favella
---
Literally unplayable
---
Thanks for that info!!
---
Kinda hard to switch servers on PS4 unless you're with someone.
---
*one tap spawn peek intensifies*
---
Or stay in your own server dont ping abuse and just be good at the game
---
Xbox One
---
i have my monitor refresh rate on 70hz, already changed it on gamefiles but it stays on 60hz...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No you can switch servers on ps4
---
thx for the tips :)
---
It‚Äôs like the whole Zelda/sheik thing. Two very (seemingly) different personas only serve to strengthen the deception.
---
I kid, I kid. You are a valuable asset to the team.
---
True, but I run mp7 defense and 552 on attack
---
They‚Äôre definitely on a date
---
I was looking for things to watch when I can‚Äôt play, but thanks
---
That was just a hacker.
---
Also every casual game too as well üòí
---
I love this game. I am playing since the open beta. I also don't mind supporting the game by buying in-game stuff. However, when the elite skins were announced /u/ubijustin  [said this about the elite skins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/5cm13y/say_no_to_skins_and_dances/d9xiyva?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)   
---
No dances, no dabbing, only animations that make sense for the operator.   
---
As I said, I love this game, what I love even more though is criticising it.  
---
IQ was an extreme stretch imo. Her animation is *ridiculous*, whether you like it as a joke or not at all is up to you but that skin was definetly not quite what I would consider to make sense for her as an operator.  
---
 I can get a laugh out of events. I enjoyed Outbreak, I enjoyed a unicorn version of Tachanka and I will enjoy the "Outlaws vs Lawmen" event. But I dislike these skins in the main game. I know it's hard to draw a line at this point. But besides the fact that skins are just way too expensive (I somewhat proof this by looking back at the release of the game. The Black Ice Skin Packs were available for 30k renown for each CTU as an event at the end of Season 1. Compare that to the bundles now for 36k where you get ONE skin and charm for one Operator. Also by now skins start to basically look like another but may cost 10k more renown, which is seen in posts on this subreddit quite frequently).  
---
The Smoke Elite Skin is just stupid. It may be a reference to Watch Dogs, but it still seems stupid to me. I didn't mind the Pulse Elite Skin too much because I liked the refernce there. This time, the animation just seems worse than just combing hair. He is using his canister as a spray can.   
---
To me, IQ was dancing, Justin. But I guess you could say R6 is a training simulation and IQ is just training! But Smoke is definetly as close to dabbing as we will ever getin R6 and I sincerely hope, there will be a change to his elite set.
---
yeah i have, i have the in game overlay and the uplay overlay as well
---
It's clear from the bottles lying around they're having a good time
---
I've heard you can through a custom game, but it only lasts a game or two and it's super annoying+
---
Cause if one of your teammates makes a mistake she can cause you to lose the round.
---
Ages back I played a casual match where on each attack round someone would get grabbed by Cav which would result in a snowball where she either got multiple interrogations or most of my team would get wiped leaving me and maybe one other guy trying to clutch.
---
The reason why I say they were salty, is because they surrendered before my teammate killed their last man. The *exact* moment before. If you‚Äôd actually read through the post a little more, it was 3-0. For someone who only does solo queue, this was pretty funny.
---
I‚Äôve seen a bunch of people saying it might release within the next hour, but no one is sure at the moment. I‚Äôm still holding out for it too.
---
Pretty much anything is a better ban then cav
---
Nice
---
it doesnt just show for him though, its for his whole team. 5 pings is too much, its why hes always getting banned now. even in PL on roamer maps he gets banned for the same reason, its a free kill sometimes
---
also a jackal with a brain wont scan your footsteps when youre on the other side of the map, the colors of footsteps changes based on how long ago you were there. he'll follow the footsteps until they're green then scan &amp; kill you
---
That's why various platforms and discord servers have channels and posts that help solo players seek a quick team with which to communicate.
---
While I understand that having friends that reliably play the game with you is not as easy, it's definitely not hard to find peeps to team up with either.
---
For single sometimes
---
people that say to destroy while vaulting probably are the one that die instantly after.. 
---
if the enemy team is playing kitchen/trophy you CAN'T do it since the time you waste for destroy the trap is enough to get killed from kitchen or trophy (depends from where the enemy is covering that spot) the video show a good alternative for destroying mat without dying while vault,
---
anyway trap or not if the enemy team is a cordinated team with call out and such is pretty hard pass from trophy window without dying.
---
granted ive only played about 15 games so far this season, but cav hasnt been banned once in my games, its always lesion and echo
---
Oh cuz the same thing happened to me
---
Play Like a Pro With This One Simple Trick Ubisoft HATES
---
Yeah but I'm kinda hoping for a Buck Elite
---
I find that out on a clatch sitoation. Rip ace
---
RIP Jackle
---
Yeah. Especially now that we have a ban phase in the beginning so theres time to notice really early disconnects. Imo the game should cancel if someone leaves before the first round has finished but i can see how that could be abused so i would be fine with just same but before the first round has started. Basically every other game has this.
---
Most of the time people ban ops they dont like playing against rather than what would actually give them an advantage on that map.
---
R.I.P. Echo :(
---
Jackal's pdw9 is so good
---
[Everybody liked that.]
---
https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-303559-16/dev-blog-ping-abuse-peekers-advantage-and-next-steps
---
Wasn‚Äôt doc peeking the window?
---
Well if thats the case wich one?
---
&gt;Hey man if you looking for a chill group me and my friends are on every day from 4-9pm central
---
That's awesome, what platform are yall on? Xbox here
---
if you play in premade team  go for finka in other case nokk if this are the only two choice since there are better operators in any case :)
---
I know they nerfed it im not new.... but its still an advantage while peeking aggressively.
---
Was going for 500 but gotta do 1000 now
---
Welp too bad Maestro already dibs the cowboy hat. Sorry man :(
---
Every other game does it fine with no problems. Csgo cancels the game if everyone didnt connect. Ow cancels the game if everyone didnt connect or someone leaves right after the game started. Iirc dota also cancels the game or makes it safe to leave without it counting as a loss or penalty if someone leaves early.  League iirc also allows a vote to cancel the game if theres a leaver. There is 0 reason why siege couldnt cancel the game if everyone didnt connect/ someone left before the game started especially now that the pregame time is longer from ban phase.
---
This has been a bad few days in ranked for me
---
Not according to that article it's not.
---
Feels bad man lmao
---
You have to wait til tomorrow to unlock them unless you have the season pass. Kinda annoying but oh well. You'll always have to wait an extra week after they're released unless you have that years pass. Hope this helped.
---
And to think we had something like this when Kaid and Nomad first came out, a relatively low recoil handgun with 70 damage and an ACOG.
---
Luckily it got toned down pretty fast, but it was interesting while it lasted.
---
The pistol obviously.
---
Stop right there r/punpatrol
---
Smoke loves you.
---
Do you know at what time it will be possible to get them?
---
Lol thats from 2017 have you even played since cuz if you have youd know while peeking its broken its unpeeking that was the big nerf(aka i got shot behind a wall)
---
I hope so. He‚Äôs not one to be fucked with...
---
I did read it was 3-0, it looks like you didn't even read anything. I'm pretty sure you are fantasising salt where there was none.
---
Holy fuck this is amazing.
---
Depends on when the ops went live 7 days ago, as in at what time of the day.
---
Chances are it will be in a few hours or so.
---
I can attest that this is not the reason. 
---
Did you always play ranked at the first week or two of every season?
---
Also, the diffuser doesn‚Äôt require practiced strats and comms. It‚Äôs as simple as, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to plant, cover me‚Äù or ‚Äúgive me the diffuser‚Äù. You can always tell where it is and who has it at any moment.
---
&gt; Lol thats from 2017 
---
So what?
---
&gt;have you even played since cuz if you have youd know while peeking its broken its unpeeking that was the big nerf(aka i got shot behind a wall)
---
Er no, bother to actually read the article.
---
You should be able too now, or withing a few hours if its exactly a week
---
I would have missed lmao
---
F, also happy cake day
---
Kinda funny how shitty our baby Ela is in the game and Zofia is 10x better than her in every situation that isn't when Ela has a shotgun. If Ela does have a shotgun then she's great.
---
JESUS
---
I like his "Get to the choppa" patch
---
They unlock today, not sure on what time.
---
Yes, I just wanted to simplify my explanation, so it would be easy for everyone to understand.
---
Just found it, cheers
---
How big are they? It‚Äôs hard to tell without something g else for reference.
---
It went from zero mm so you would mainly face the lower ranks because plats and diamonds are pretty rare, to win a couple of matches and you will get plats and diamonds constantly.
---
Check your game for updates, that's all I can tell you
---
Messaged him afterwards just to say ‚ÄúJesus saw that‚Äù
---
I really liked this vid
---
The team isn‚Äôt split. Outbreak was made by an entirely different Ubisoft studio.
---
*welcome back to the doctor Phil show*
---
Maybe because it's a repost? He didn't make it. Even the owner posted in the thread asking why he didn't credit them.
---
Where‚Äôs it at though?
---
Yeah my ping is normally pretty bad but even with a low one I get hit reg issues. I hate saying it cause it‚Äôs the ol classic ‚Äúhow is that not a headshot‚Äù but I swear there are times I‚Äôll only be able to see the head and I‚Äôll get blood splatter and everything and somehow didn‚Äôt even do 25 damage.
---
Its a video game. Video games are about having fun. Pick the one you find the most fun.
---
Someone doesn‚Äôt liked getting blown up from below.
---
These honestly don‚Äôt look like wood
---
I can see he tried to spawn peak as well. A true man of culture
---
Right now. 
---
I'm kind of Salty about it though. I had to leave for work the moment there was 15 minutes left. Couldn't be late... But at least I have something to look forward to when I get home.
---
I‚Äôve never played against diamonds outside of ranked until this update but I do know what you mean before this season if play against silver and low gold now it‚Äôs all diamonds and plats
---
lazy
---
this wholesome chinese dad &gt; e girls who dye their hair green and call it ela
---
You mean that thing weve been making jokes about since her announcement?
---
in low ranks there are often attackers who are going in alone trying to flank or rush and if she catches them it can fuck the whole team
---
Hey! Shut up!
---
Whoosh

Warden's gadget is very optional (Enemies need to have Blitz or Ying f.e.). It's very useful against smokeplants but only on certain maps and sites.
---
N√∏kk is a lot of fun to play and to sneak past cams and suddenly be on site. Since you're a Smoke player you'll love the fact she has his SMG. 
---
Personally I'd go for N√∏kk if you main casual because she's just fun to play but not too great in ranked. Warden however can really make a difference in ranked and still has a half-decent gun.
---
Not sure what part of "gadget primary" you aren't understanding.
---
W/L Ratio.
---
Over fucking 130.

yeah. totally legit

Glitch or hack probably

Lesbian relationships are just fine. Especially in full HD

No, they did this on purpose, not because they were lazy. They have so many employees, I'm sure one of them could come up with a story.

Add Montagne and Lesion on top of that.

Oh im on xbox
---
I had 20 days in casual only facing low ranks, then 1.5 years in they changed it and casual became sweaty and toxic. Played one match to test it out this season and it gave me lvl300 plats and diamonds.
---
The look on your face when you purposely lose the round because your teammates were already calling you trash before you had the chance to show them that you can fucking clutch like it's nothing, but you decide that they didn't deserve to win for being a bunch of assholes to you, so you just kill yourself instead.
---
Interesting.

Big sad

Ubisoft should update the bio to include their names
---
soon‚Ñ¢
---
Yo
---
Its probably to do with the fact that on pc they can actually aim meaning that recoil patterns dont really matter as long as you have good aim however on console we have "joysticks" that control aim so recoil patterns have a much bigger affect on console
---
I think everyone's noticed this
---
Not lazy but pretty dumb hey let's recruit someone who we know literally nothing about
---
I took a break from the game and when my friend got it I got back into the game. When this map came I tried showing him my ultra secret strat, once we both fell and lost 8hp he called ‚Äúfu*king stupid‚Äù  and we lost the round :(
---
Are you selling them?
---
If you're on pc we'd love it if you'd join us! Every evening/night we have about 3/4 people playing Siege. The ranks are spreading from gold 3 to plat 2. Sometimes we like to take ranked very serious but we can have a lot of fun as well. Feel free to message!
---
Yeah, sorted üòÖ
---
INB4 it's delayed again
---
STOP DOIN IT'S STUPID. I JUST WANNA PLAY JACKALY BOI

Thats when you quickly run back and barricade the wall they came through. (:

OOF

I can see that XD
---
sis
---
r/whatalegend
---
It should be an add on or DLC on the R6 steam store page
---
Yeh, I think mine is pretty damn good
---
Yep!
---
I feel like echo can easily be countered by iq though.
---
Its spelled "GU" in the game but you got the way its pronounced
---
Spread, not recoil.
---
Actually im pretty sure these are the ‚Äúpublic files‚Äù aka we are seeing these characters files from an outsiders perspective, the rainbow team (the ops and the leader) know who she is but outside of that its supposed to be held rather secret. Thats why her file is redacted to the ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù of rainbow AKA us.
---
(Thats what I heard)
---
I love getting games where thermite and hibana are banned
---
There was a time when they were free for everyone
---
he should do Lesion!
---
 Bruv actually wtf
---
Man that‚Äôs so [REDACTED]
---
Only problem with this strategy is there are very few walls in the game that this is possible on, it requires a soft floor. But some walls simply can‚Äôt be breached like this
---
No what
---
Guys this is not real. That is a mask, you can see by the shadow under the ‚Äúface‚Äù around the neck and how his ears don‚Äôt align with his ‚Äúface‚Äù
---
This is my ranked match of whole day
---
The other trick is, if you're using mute to jam it you destroy the wall so they can't place down the thermite charge.
---
Yeah, no
---
Old.
---
Well you can, just go into casual.
---
I would‚Äôve thrown my nitro like an idiot
---
The nerf lets you either run to a mute jammer and instantly break the call if you are anchoring, or just run away (like you are saying with a Jackal) until the call times out if roaming. It's nowhere near as oppressive as it used to be.    
---
As for Jackal, the problem is that not only do your footprints stay for 90 seconds (that's half the action phase of ranked!), and the scan lasts 20 seconds with 5 seconds between each ping. This means that even after he pings you, he can go back to the same footprint to ping you again most of the time in case he or his team fails to kill you. And the only counter to this is Caveira, who doesn't get pinged while her 10-second Silent Step lasts (and doesn't leave prints either). The good way to do this would clear the ping when Silent Step happens, or you can't ping them at all if the trail is broken. Because right now at best she is just a soft counter to it.
---
yeah but its ridiculously hard, I never seem to be able to vault on the metal plates
---
this is awesome
---
How bout giving us colorblind options just like other games ?
---
Quite the contrary. I do not have it on my i9 9900k but i5 and i7 are known to have it:

youre not high plat or diamond üòÇüòÇ. jackal is banned before hes even picked, and hes easy to counter in higher ranks, youre not running around like a headless chicken.
---
Honestly I have no idea üòÇ
---
Agreed. The classic holographic isn't much clean, the bands are bigger compared to the new one and the sight isn't really good
---
No just no
---
So why did you put the lord in dogshit and not into Godly?
---
Depends on if you are playing ranked or not - Echo and Mira typically permabanned so and Valk is a better pick up than Cav.
---
Look me up ScoobZ_

Really? I never got that invested in this game. wtf

nook is useful. shes a upgraded ash, but she has to prioritize targets, and rush when their are distractions. i dont always use her, but when i do, ill get a kill or 2 from the rush

Thank you for the advice !

So how's silver OP?
---
It's just because people are too scared to face him. He's annoying, but not broken.
---
They'll do it based off what happens in plat and diamond ranks, I'm not sure they're banning blitz the same as everyone else
---
anybody could put a random gamertag, classic internet
---
I wanted to tell him &gt;:(
---
But like what even is that? And who‚Äôs Scruffy?

Very well done üëçüèª

I could see how it‚Äôs realistic but not much else in the game is realistic so I don‚Äôt like it

You speak heresy on are Lord? Blasphemy!

Look at my Reddit username, scoobz_ is a shorter version of my name. Add me if you're so sceptical I'll message you

Actually he was there at a secret location as ubi flew him out and he tested the phantom site operators with Macie Jae and other youtubers.
---
He isn‚Äôt that strong and pretty easy to kill idk maybe they don‚Äôt know how to counter him

He asked me not you &gt;:((((

Testing, sorry for the notification

I love this.

It‚Äôs more of a comfort thing. Blitz is pretty balanced but he‚Äôs really annoying to play against in the low levels, same with Jackel, Ying, Clash (before she was removed temporarily), and just ops that require teamwork to beat or use.
---
It's just who I like damn

You just replied to your own post. If you replied to someone else who deleted it it would show this as a reply to a comment by user [deleted] and text [removed]. Don‚Äôt BS your way out of this OP.

Why Ubi with every improvement must fuck somthing else up?
---
Oh yeah, it's probably doesn't but im just saying, by logic, it should work. However, it probably doesn't for balance reasons. You can technically say if it going through steal, it should go through brick, right? But that would break the game, lmao

Not right now but even then it is obvious there's something wrong

Maps, they clearly said their laying off new maps and focusing on map overhauls to balance them out and also because new players already have a difficult time learning a bunch of current maps. As for everything else who really knows for the lack of new weapons though glitches and bugs are pesky in games you have to look into the code to figure out whats producing it and figure out a fix. Thats pretty much a staple in every game. Point is yes, there are seperate development teams within Ubisoft that focus on their own individual game
---
Even tho you're right low rank players don't plant that much and try to kill the entire enemy team from what I heard from my friend.

Can't really tell without videos.

Iq and kaid should switch spots

My friend has the same exact issue. We‚Äôve tried every single solution we could find but still nothing. Either the servers near you are down or some other technical reason I wouldn‚Äôt know of.

no its just pathetic how much you need to prove youre a diamond or plat. but yeah, classic internet babe (;

Ok, I will check this, but what if I will have 100 % usage and such a low fps? Does it mean that my CPU is to weak?
---
This is just a theory but it could be the actual Camera item developers use in the engine. The way it has "Scruffy's" written on the side and the fact that I've never seen a prop like that in game.

The hinges are the weirdest part.

It only takes one nitro cell to ruin it all

I feel old now... Operation Health is already 2 years ago...

I like the idea but wouldn't an operator who deploys smoke surely be wearing some type of eyewear? goggles or some kind of helmet maybe. seems weird the smoke gets in peoples eyes but she would not have any protection when using that type of gadget.

Operator af
---
I only ban the new ops.
---
Not because their are op or I dont own them.
---
The reason is it pisses people off. Had people leave because of it in ranked.
---
That‚Äôs really good
---
As a Tachanka main, all I can is that‚Äôs kinda not bad, maybe some day...
---
Clash is the most annoying playing against her makes me want to break my disk in half
---
Where is the skin Lebowski?

Probably bandit drugs...

...would not have saved him had he died.

Why? Cav counters Jackal, not the other way around?

Without Jackal Cav plays the same as with.

Maybe, but i want Canal more

Well according to my friends, it's because he's annoying. Not much else really.

I took a break between Para Bellum and this most recent season. Siege is also my ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù game, I only really play it when there nothing to do in my other games I play

Examples?

Ight fill me up bb
---
I've been saving all my bottle money for this bad boy. An update would be great.
---
You can crouch around if you dont want to be tracked by Jackal. Much slower but doable to a degree.
---
I just have Smooth Criminal queued on spotify waiting for this occasion.

&gt; Shit, need to hide my ~~drugs~~ chest full of ACOGs

Elas Scorpien for sure

Anything that can stop him from charging at you like a crackhead

Hasn‚Äôt been the case in any of my games if I‚Äôm being honest. But it‚Äôs too early to tell.

Awful and fucking game breaking! Gonna try it soon
---
In the unlock operators tab of the game you can see a bundle to buy with r6 credits at the very bottom
---
S - Echo, Blitz, Caveira, Lesion, Jackal
---
A - Mira, Clash, Pulse, Maestro, Nomad, Dokkaebi, Valkyrie, Maverick, Lion

It's doubly funny because he's really only disliked because he blocks cheese tactics or exacerbates defender numerical advantage for people trying to plant and pick
---
Every now and then an exciting Oregon match comes along, Fnatic vs EG also comes to mind. 
---
But "putting more time into it" just isn't an argument here. Teams have been playing on it for nearly 3.5 years now, how much more time do you want to spend on it? 
---
And in fact, the main reason it's not so great anymore is that teams *have* put so much time into it. The meta is just completely overdeveloped, there's basically nothing more to do.
---
She looked so pretty, why'd they change her?

So this is what other players see when they‚Äôre lagging their ass off and teleporting everywhere

Downvote cause he didn‚Äôt shave his head.

Respectfully disagree, thanks for your response!

Personally, I use the her fmg 9 and the the d50

Recruit should be S+ TBH

Tachanka is cool, he is a viable operator and you can‚Äôt change my mind

Looks like a blend of pulse and lesion

Ah the old Retard Lunch Line
---
Ubi confirmed it‚Äôs a bug and are looking into it
---
This has been know for a while.
---
I played just before the update and got a triple kill on that shark. WHY UBI. YOU EVEN USED TO ENCOURAGE IT
---
Ah yes, consoles. I forget people play competitive shooters on consoles.
---
I can get that, it's why I try and keep my suits as cheap as possible too (and why I started making them myself in the first place)
---
I guess I just don't see why you'd be frugal for one element but not for all elements if the end product is functionally identical
---
I‚Äôd move glaz down to D after his recent nerf.
---
With, or without suppressors?
---
Not long, I assume it's a little bugged and works for unequipping too since most of what I did was take off laser sights
---
Agreed but only cause of glitches. This season have new ranked,new ops and awesome new Kafe,love it

Get to the choppa, I like his style

‚ÄúBlurryShip48 has been banned‚Äù

its quite a specific thing that im sure pretty much everyone forgot about

He's a DILF tho

First of all this passive aggressive reddit meme your dOiNg is pointless, and we are on the internet so you cant convince anybody its just how it goes, and i dont get this whole ‚Äùwhy are we comparing to smg or shotguns‚Äù thing becouse thats what its up against smg and shotguns right? We are still talking of the luison as a gun right? So why not compare it to other guns? The close range combat is ok with the luison BUT you would still get clapped by a shotgun or smg11 close range, and WHY is the only comparable gun the PRB92 that makes absolutly no sense, like i said its still a pistol one click one shot.
---
Warden is a weird one. His weaponry is underwhelming, his ability completely situational and his animations are awkward. 
---
I'd skip him.
---
IIRC it was removed from online play because it was too easy for a defender to spawnkill attackers there.
---
Theres nothing wrong with saying 'Ash'.
---
Cushman? He was my 7th grade math teacher and he looks the exact same
---
Finka boost substance? Because the way they injected it in the trailer sounded similar.

We've been going after the wrong pusher this whole time!

What did ubi do? I havent played him since he came out.

This is why casual will always be more fun and enjoyable than ranked.

Pick and ban. A lot of teams ban echo so I can‚Äôt play him :((
---
An ace is five, no matter what. In CSGO, Ace is five people. No different from siege

Fucking beats me dude, those same people probably like choking themselves out from the ceiling fan just to bust a nut.

He doesn't have a wrist phone.  That's a tacpad

Its 18th of june were is the elite

‚Äúfun and entertaining‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make her a good operator. every single B tier operator on OP‚Äôs list is better and than clash

Hmmmm ... not a bad theory

Uhh they're so bad they don't even need explanationüòÇüòÇ so i'm finna leave...

Enemy team: "Hi! Would you like to hear about our lord and savior Tachanka?"  
---
OP: "No thanks!"
---
My use of the present tense maybe? His statement is wrong, that's a fact it used to be 1 thing but so long ago I don't know why he brought it up.
---
And worse people commented believing it's a thing now. I put the truth out there.
---
Ash should be higher. Not even because gameplay reasons, I just can't stand her as a person.
---
The reason why they removed recruit is because the recruit rush was to strong duhhhh.
---
I actually sexually identify as a sweetroll.

In a life-threatening situation, the average person‚Äôs heartbeat can be upwards of 175 beats per minute. A well-trained tango is able to stay cool, keep calm. Their heartrates can be 70 to 100 beats per minute. But by the time I‚Äôm done, that number goes down to zero.

NO OR IT WOULDVE BEEN ON HOT

Provide the back story on why this is a meme within the community then, idiot. Just take the criticism and leave

Lmao I‚Äôve seen that bug a bunch before. Not new. But still annoying.

That‚Äôs relatable

Nah, its 500% m8
---
No you didn't
---
the skin is a bit underwhelming, its just brown... nice apart from that
---
Oh god, the toxicity.
---
depends, id rather go against a lesion on chalet, and hereford then agaisnt a cav
---
Using the weakest weapon and shooting through multiple layers at a 3 armor I could only get damage down to 4.
---
Wha time will lesion elite release
---
Probably my favorite strat of all time and why I consistently pick breach charges over anything else except claymores. I‚Äôve gotten so many clutches because I took the time to place a breach on the floor above or on a window and then went around and detonated it. Everyone‚Äôs attention immediately snaps there
---
I don't feel like playing against caveira is annoying, just extremely stressful.
---
Finally released thank god

Probably fake since it‚Äôs a custom match tbh

Happy cake day! I think

Well they didnt come out today, so youre right :D

It‚Äôs you again

How‚Äôd I fake it than

wow ok uh yikes. In this case it matters plenty actually. Anything bronze or below is a complete mess. Also, relax a bit will you? Like, it was just a simple question I didnt shoot your dog.

---
If I can force Jackal (and often a teammate) to spend all his utility and 40 seconds tracking me down, that's a decent trade even if I don't come out of it with any kills.  And recently I've been coming out of it with at least 1 kill most of the time.  Unlike with Dokk, I can lead him past an unrevealed teammate or (often) pick my spot to ambush him.
---
That doesn't work for Dokk because her reveal effects everyone and is continuous instead of intermittent.  The nerf made her more tolerable because you can often just wait out the call instead of having to turn it off, but in terms of being revealed and hunted as a roamer she poses the same problems Jackal does without any of the solutions the way his gadget works makes possible.
---
Too true
---
Switch Lion and Caveira then its accurate :)
---
And put Bb in S tier
---
Nah man I just speak the truth. The gap between ranks needs to be higher. Alot higher.
---
Get your friend to stand still in a spot where you know he will be
---
So you can cast a few spells, am I supposed to be impressed?

I agree tbh. Custom matches most likely mean set up.

I made it because of overwatchüòÇ

Hey all!

This is an intended change as the Dev Team did not find hopping on the fins to be balanced and this is how it was addressed.

Yup I always just keep switching and eventually run out of ammo and no one is dead

Imagine house

And a n√∏kk to sneak past them all
---
Actually you are the only one

Just imagine
---
I would love a ranked mode with all maps and modes, and a separate new ranked we have now. Trouble is the new ranked would be stone dead.
---
it's called using a nitro cell/grenade or shooting their legs
---
Yeah but they would never give them for free
---
If the safety and other features matched, sure. But the metal features are solid gold, so I think the muzzle brake should match because it's also a metal feature.

If that had been me, they would have all droned me out and then stood back all the way to the map border wall before the wall exploded shooting me.
---
Tachanka is either D or S, dependant on how skilled the player is. There is no middle ground. He is either getting executed by a guy who has no fingers, or he will kill your entire team without blinking.
---
Haha I can raise you one more my friend.
---
The sad part is that you can still open the hatch by placing the thermite on the wall between kitchen and meeting :). The one directly by the wall that is usually shot out
---
Here's an example of just that: Computers are devices that do arithmetic better than us. Arithmetic is a skill. Therefore computers are devices modeled to perform a skill.

In the lore Echo is actually quite the ladykiller. He dated ying for a year and is good friends with dokkaebi!

I mean mp7 isn't that hard to control? I dunno mate, try looking at the recoil pattern.

No idea, I play on PC and loading times usually mean bad storage device. Not sure for console.

At the end of the day it isnt that difficult.  My only point I am trying to make is that is is easier to do well with operators like monty and blitz so long as you're not solo queuing.

Same here, gone from 80 to 220

Dude the editin was so on point and if u make a yt channel imma subscribe for sure , well played

When they were called out, they just said that we were bad...

Ash is b but lion is a. Okay then

Where‚Äôs Mozzie and his drone army?

Getting one on a level up would be no more free than that already are. Especially at higher levels where they take forever

You can open the wall by placing the thermite on the 2nd wall by hatch(The one by the door)

Lmao is this Xbox? No wonder

Nah plat baby üòò
---
Yeah but I suppose it's also easier to counter them if you don't solo queue either, if you are communicating you will always have the advantage, a recruit rush with communication could beat an unorganised defence too, it's just the nature of the game, I've had plenty of times where I was destroyed as monty because the defence were aggressive whie I've aso been able to take advantage of uncoordinated defenders as monty

It was removed, was a glitch

In my opinion I like what it looks like a younger version of him for when he was at university

Imagine, MVP pose, he rides in on a horse with blowtorch in hand. That would be sick
---
The kick back on that straight in your eye. LOL
---
Agreed
---
That kinda feels too slow for the game, it could take you a minute just to safely follow a set of tracks on a map like Bank. Maybe if he had a DRONE that could see footprints (but not scan), he'd be able to drone them out ever time and then you'd have Cav and Vigil at the very least be counters.
---
Some don‚Äôt care about information. I‚Äôd much rather have alpha packs be unlocked than information
---
Um yes you can
---
I'm sorry bro but I don't agree for like the vault obj this would be STUPID BROKEN cuz you could make the entire basement dark for a set amount of time and with his NVGs he would rips through the objective site, like a fat child with a birthday cake.
---
I have the same keyboard lol.
---
then actually think about your titles
---
Bruh
---
Load times are unrelated to connection quality, and are only dependent on how quickly the game's content (map, player models, etc.) can be loaded into memory.  
---
  
---
If OP is on PS4 and this is a new problem, it could be a sign that the storage device is failing or possibly is being used by the system for something else.
---
lol this is literally stickied to the front page my guy
---
This happens to me so much then an error will pop up and I go offline then need to reset rainbow does anybody know a fix or is this on Ubisoft
---
Oh, I guess I‚Äôm an idiot. I‚Äôll look into it, I never really knew about SSD
---
Do something about MnK on console it is ruining thr game
---
Finally, my dude gets an Elite!
---
blue team attacks first.

Its just a little prick they said,

it would be fun they said

Hello Killerspartans8, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c26woa/i_think_something_broke_most_likely_wardens_ankles/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You can do just one wall as well for double walls like the one shown... Although I'm not sure why you would, perhaps if u wanted to save some?
---
is it tho? maybe they didn't plan to have that be like that because tbh that is an annoying area to push with people being able to get on shark and see the people coming in window.
---
Happens all the time
---
Only Lesion instead of cav cuz only gold plebs ban cav
---
I've had this happen exactly the same way. My random teammates forgot to reinforce it and I had to run up (as Cav) and reinforce. Only difference is I panicked and threw a nade and killed us all
---
I have a skin that is gold and pale gold on the handle. Epic rarity but I can't remember what it is called
---
I tried spawnpeaking with smoke yesterday and got headshotted by blitz from 60 meters away. I was not happy.
---
Nope just cba levelling it up n all that
---
lol
---
Almost like the time I [heard someone place a Breach Charge behind behind me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c14jeb/i_got_a_trophy_for_killing_an_enemy_with_a_breach/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
Both of you are complete shit.
---
Releasing Lesion Elite during the worst time when there is mad protest going on between HK citizen and law enforcement lol.
---
I feel looted because i git the annual pass and i cant buy anything from the store. Feels like fraud
---
*i never got gud*....
---
"lets see the new skin on the goo mines........... it's just as invisible as before" 
---
XD oh dude... but seriously tho. its the same
---
i play since release but changed from console to pc. its not and indication of skill haha
---
The m590 is one of those guns where if you believe in it, it will work
---
Leaving code that would stop you in the game would be extremely prone to bugs and abusable.
---
Ah my bad. Just now noticing the real problem. Originally thought you were put in a match by yourself with no team or opponents. Yeah just use your mic and have a teammate guide you and tell you when to shoot. Or just hold back and hope your team comes in clutch. Restart game after just in case.
---
This is cool
---
A 3rd MPX to piss everyone off more. I‚Äôd be all for it though
---
Really wish you could swap headgear's with elite sets.... for the price they should let you
---
I‚Äôm alone...
---
Play monty against a lesion while being constantly shot at
---
Why not just make an enemy electronic red, and a friendly electronic blue, while deceived gadgets are white?
---
I posted that too. Got removed because of "bugs should be reported to R6Fix"
---
K1A probably. Though I started to love the fmg on attack
---
Is floating screens the actual animation?
---
Am I supposed to be able to hear?
---
More gameplay if anyone is interested! :D - [https://youtu.be/bpH7Z39ktxU](https://youtu.be/bpH7Z39ktxU)
---
Lowkey disappointed about the victory animation. Seems low balled imo
---
Wow, they are *SERIOUS* potatoes....
---
I still thinks its underpowered for an attacker.
---
Why are the arrows on this sub so weird?
---
ok
---
At first I wanted it. Now I kinda dont.
---
Actually looks dope how do i do this
---
I love n√∂kk for her gadget and her stealth role,but warden,i regret buying it..
---
Cosplay is so good it‚Äôs about to be banned /s
---
Seriously you guys look great
---
That rubberband was trying to warn you
---
Anyone else notice that Liam changes to Chris when it's swiped?
---
Lol sorry that's the only way I could post it for some reason
---
Nutty
---
Refer to steps 1-3
---
Actually relatively easy. You get in from the outside. Take your drone to little walkway behind kitchen and you‚Äôll see an opening in the wall thats blocked by the big dressers that my drone is on. You can jump onto the ledge of one and then just jump straight up and you‚Äôre there! Sounds confusing as i read it back to myself but once you find the spot im talking about you can get right up there
---
Only when there's that one guy that knows how to play him. I ain't taking that chance.
---
I‚Äôm seriously just now playing around with Echo, he‚Äôs always been one I‚Äôve been ambivalent towards, but I‚Äôm having a blast in casual with him.
---
I raise you infrared BOSG
---
No not really? I'm good enough to make diamond without exploits, why would I bother exploiting unless the enemy is first?
---
Jackals SMG would be to strong.   
---
Id probably say one of the UMP45's.  Its hard to just give her a defender weapon becuase they are balanced around defense. This is why despite having an absolutely incredible ability she is still just a bad operator against a compotent team.   
---
She loses every gunfight you could face off against unless you land a headshot or shoot them in the back. Honestly dont see her being picked in Pro League much if at all, attackers heavily favour speed and kill potential. Nokk is 2 speed and has very low kill potential thanks to her weapons.   
---
Cant just give her an AR though because they found that too strong. Maybe a new SMG focused on an attacking role.

---
Looking for more ideas to implement.
---
Yeah, warden is very situational at the moment.
---
It‚Äôs probably because your ass at the game
---
She can only use her ability while alive. And when nobody is playing a hardbreacher what do you choose? Thermite or IQ.... duh
---
This is the internet. Leave your feelings at the door.
---
Next years April fools
---
I run it with a suppressor and seems decent to me. That's only me of course. 
---
Just aim for the dome and remember to say "speedy execution is the mother of good fortune"
---
Life goals
---
You could just play the game and watch your rank climb.
---
r/fbiopenup
---
jackal isnt annoying at all
---
I also run with a suppressor but I always try to aim for center mass cause the recoil will push up to the head but at range against some def ops I really suffer.
---
I play a lot with lesion, was really into buy his elite but it feels weird considering that there's no headgear, his gadget is invisible and the animation is so underwhelming :l
---
Amazing
---
‚ÄúPepper needs new shorts!‚Äù
---
I haven't been able to rejoin a ranked game for about a year now.  Everytime me or my friends DC we just get the abandonment penalty
---
What about something like Lesions JS9?
---
Had a person join and I left he got the win and I got a ban can I contact unit support?
---
Could this be a side-effect of all this DoS-sing?
---
They mad tho
---
I love Warden for his running animation.
---
Restart q and it says 30 seconds and puts you back in
---
Not great not terrible
---
Kapkan gun skins are lame too. There is just so more you can do with them. The Blackbeard Elite SR-25 skin is literally just black.
---
Lion is so much better to do deal with after the nerf. I think Lion should be B and Blackbeard should be A.
---
Such a rip. F in the chat for the Yellow Recruit.
---
I agree.
---
He wouldn‚Äôt be the 2nd most banned defender in pro league if all it took to deal with him was play IQ. His cams are usually on site, so you need serious site control for IQ to stand there scanning around for them or find them through the floor
---
He has the same gun as Doc and Rook, but it does more damage even with its built in silencer.
---
On 1-10 I give you like a 4 or 5 lol sorry don‚Äôt mean to sound like a ass just need practice that‚Äôs all some players that I watch on a daily are Godly,Beaulo,Pengu &amp; Macie Jay just watch there clips you‚Äôll learn a lot from them
---
If it's american literature I won't know about it. Plus I think if it's in books you can't really do anything
---
Nomad is s type
---
found Bill Cosby's account
---
Congrats on the milestone!
---
Oh shit
---
Any weapon skin you unlock is always permanent :)
---
You're never to old :)
---
You could bring that into an American preschool for show and tell :)
---
Congrats. 
---
If I ever tried ranked I'd probably struggle to hit copper
---
FINALLY
---
Oh okay then echo and Mira for defence. Smoke and (I like IQ) but ash is a solid attacker either way.
---
actually i would've missed
---
thats good to know
---
No, he's glitched. I pulled it off myself
---
Btw I meant the flairs next to ur name
---
I‚Äôm done
---
I personally don‚Äôt as someone that uses thermite a lot
---
Ying number one
---
Opiate overdose.
---
I usually don‚Äôt, just because I like Reflex the most. It‚Äôs almost the same thing, except Reflex gives a field of view below the reticle, which is nice when you‚Äôre aiming for the head and they crouch walk around the corner. If you‚Äôve got ironsights that can be a death sentence.
---
dead girls can't say no
---
But it does say on my link that it comes with 20 operators no?

Haze seems like if you took the whole idea of decoy grenades in CS and made it into an operator, pretty cool concept for a sound based operator.
---
Laser op
---
That makes the most sense to me, but they state that it's available until the end of season and i thought that meant for purchase and for use.

Hello MightyKratos99, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c28pp7/r6_needs_plus/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah I'm a bean
---
thats a good way to rise your water bills to thousands
---
Steam counts all the hours in the application. That includes menu time, load time, etc. But r6 tab shows how many hours you've played in games
---
Highlight the ranked playlist but don't queue, then click the button that says "guide" and cycle through the tabs
---
What platform?
---
Thank you! I just had to tell someone
---
We were mainly trying to follow the game astatic as close as we could. My dad said he doesn't really care too much for the flag detail
---
It depends on how close you are to the corner you‚Äôre angling on and how close/far away you think they might be.  That‚Äôs the whole reason you pie a corner, to minimize exposure of yourself while maximizing your field of view past the obstacle
---
This link https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/buy/index.aspx
---
This is pointless
---
depends. you are able to put it on the weapons that are out in the game right now currently. so if a new weapon comes out then you won't be able to put it on that new gun.
---
Well it's pretty obviously ubisofts servers...not to mention he's defending.
---
Believe in yourself. You can go as high as you like if you just try.
---
You might just be in either a bad position, or exposing too much as you clear an angle
---
"Did you reinforce down there yet or nah"
---
Fast peek and pre fire every shot and just wish fo luck
---
This one is much better.
---
I've had this twice now, but only since the season started.
---
Hey! Im offended
---
What are you trying to unlock
---
Ahhh isn‚Äôt paid currency fun
---
weapon skin for warden
---
Red = Blood/Evil
---
Yellow/White/Blue = Neutral/Supportive
---
Green = Supportive
---
These are not my rules, that's how most people learned to associate colors.
---
In the game I mostly guess from context that a camera belongs to my team or the enemy team. If it's a drone without shiny frame, it will probably be from the attackers. If I see a camera flashing, but no message pops up about me being spotted, it's probably friendly.
---
kinda cool
---
Even if the skin is universal tho? I can't apply it to a new weapon?
---
I got use to quickly tbh .. im cool with it like that üòé
---
how dare you mock him
---
Yeah. I thought they gave the base ops with every version because they changed it recently but I guess you‚Äôll have to grind. Sorry dude.
---
Thats a full fucking minute behind.
---
Are you playing in the fucking Mariana Trench?
---
That is approx 14 minutes behind
---
what
---
D r u g s
---
Hope you won that game...
---
You will never fix TK'ing it's going to be there, if you do not like it that's fine, but this game is prolly not for you.

Hello IAmBadAtR6S, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c28rop/i_been_called_out_hacking/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Except this time they fail miserably.
---
By a surprisingly large amount yes. Perhaps it's time for another server upgrade (operation health 2.0)
---
So China forced Ubi to remove the skull?
---
NO! YOUR CRAZY! STOP THIS MADNESS!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed it too. The servers definitely are acting funny.
---
Considering you've only played for 3 seasons thats actually amazing, congrats dude.
---
Every time I‚Äôve  played ranked since the update my ping has always been really high. Like everyone had a high ping. Servers might just be dying.
---
I usually play ranked, but i play casual rarely to test out new ops and loadouts.
---
Right until you read the name on the far right
---
#NEVER ASSUME
---
As a jackal main, I fucking hate these bans
---
universals are for every weapon even new ones
---
Your life is pointless
---
I just watched a VarsityGaming video on this. He tries to make the argument that if you get down on yourself if you're 0-3, then you deserve to lose anyways since you have a worse mindset. If anyone in this sub has ever played sports, they'd know that a more confident and good spirited team will 99% of the time play better, leading to a crapshoot on who gets attack/defense first and henceforth wins the game. For it to be successfully implemented in ranked, the game needs more rounds, which won't happen anytime soon
---
depends, i can control long bursts but it depends on the situation
---
Bruh that hand is munted
---
I disagree I provide much more value then a poorly timed clip of R6
---
I don't get why Jackal keeps getting banned when ops like Thatcher and Hibana and Maverick exist. Like, I understand the Blitz, I understand but dont like the Cav, and Echo is a no brainer, but why Jackal?
---
Test
---
How did that fatty get her? He litterally can't take a step without letting all of China know he's here.
---
Mine shot up to 1400 and I'm sitting there like UHHHHHHHH 
---
After that it took me to my dashboard and said I was disconnected from Xbox Live. Sick.
---
That's pretty freaking good for a rare
---
Like beyond funny. Hell the other day I saw someone with a ping well into 40k. I have no idea where they were playing from, Mars perhaps?
---
Thats what I always see getting banned in ranked
---
Hey, I‚Äôm also making a team. Currently we have 6 players, but having around 10 would be an ideal amount. I‚Äôm gold 4 currently, but we‚Äôre pushing to plat. We have a discord server right now.
---
is it even out??
---
Thank you. Not gonna lie i legit cried a little
---
Just keep grinding until you get up to higher gold it gets a little better
---
Oooohhhh okay I totally missed what you meant there. And I‚Äôve got no f**king Idea.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you guys are talking about I have no issues (playing on Xbox btw)
---
The guy who uploaded this had the best internet. That‚Äôs how he got this picture out first. It only took him 2 seasons and a sacrifice to the demon zuultorn
---
This was in mid-gold 2
---
I‚Äôve figured it out anyway
---
People did it in secure area as well. Guessing he didn‚Äôt play in high plat range because that‚Äôs when it is the worst across all modes.
---
Thats why I installed paddles on the bottom of my controller for leaning
---
If it was their servers the lobby would be booted. This is 100% a DDoS.
---
Yes I‚Äôm inexperienced I‚Äôm most assuredly not some ex special forces I‚Äôm just some Internet dude. 
---
I am comfortable in my training but it is just that, training. I‚Äôm not anywhere near done yet, and never will be.
---
Also in this instance as I have said countless times is not my usual gear, believe it or not I don‚Äôt shoot IPSC in 20kg of gear when the guy next to me is in shorts and a t shirt. This is out of the ordinary as is racking the slide before aiming. It‚Äôs an unnatural thing for me so no wonder it appears untrained because I haven‚Äôt and don‚Äôt plan to train for this. 
---
I really am trying to improve and of course in future I will keep my finger out of the trigger guard, partially because of training but also because I just cannot be arsed to have a debate about myself with some 10% of random viewers on a Video Game subreddit  declaring themselves to be an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù in the comments of a lighthearted cosplay video. 
---
If I had intended this to be serious video of modern training first off I wouldnt be using a 9x18mm Makarov, I‚Äôd have pulled out a more modern system like a Glock. I probably wouldn‚Äôt be wearing an outdated piece of Russian steel on my head and I wouldn‚Äôt be giving myself a neckache trying to do a ‚Äúlook ma, no hands‚Äù thing. As stated before I wouldn‚Äôt be clocking out of holster I would have had it decocked or on safe, that would have felt more natural and would have been more in line with what I have learned. 
---
I mean you criticise my viewing of an Ex Special Forces member based on one photo alone with zero context provided by yourself, yet when you are presented with a few seconds of cosplay video you are suddenly capable of judging a whole mans career? Doesn‚Äôt work both ways mate. (Btw I‚Äôm sure he would deck me.)
---
(But thanks for at least making a positive comment of the Cosplay, i mean that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm here hahaha.)
---
Working as intended: he shot too early and still had some hipfire inaccuracy.
---
I never had a problem with him before. I play IQ just in case there‚Äôs and Echo or Lesion on the first round and continue to it there is. Even Thatcher works well to counter him. If you‚Äôre about to plant just toss an EMP in to disable his drone and off you go. This clip doesn‚Äôt really prove anything imo. It just looks like he‚Äôs playing the operator well. If Echo is able to provide a lot of information and can stop the plant, it means the player is playing him well. He‚Äôs not an easy op to play right out of the gate. The attackers knew there was an Echo but clearly had little to no communication among them and decided so were unable to find the drone before before planting.
---
Also Pro League bans shouldn‚Äôt be used as an example or proof of why the op should be banned in Ranked. Pro League is played way differently and usually a lot more aggressively and quickly than most Ranked matches. And even then Echo is only banned on certain maps.
---
It‚Äôs still fairly popular on PC, really depends on the games you play.
---
yes it is
---
At least your dad can play ranked nowadays
---
I would of tried to yeet a nitro cell and probably fail
---
Well yeah, thats all it is, is very minor recoil difference.
---
if it goes like the past season bundles it should cost 20 usd
---
Well mr Monk, what brings you here today?
---
Fr, no one even plays him anymore
---
Too lazy to look it up now, but EPI has said in the past that it's cheating.
---
The relevant part is from the Code of Conduct:
---
 Player is running a modified or otherwise unauthorized version of the  Game client or a third party software which provides any sort of unfair  advantage (wallhacks, aimhacks‚Ä¶) or causing detriment to other players‚Äô  experience: Maximum penalty is permanent ban. 
---
Although that is primarily directed at macros, it is also applicable to MnK.  They use 3rd party software (and hardware) to change the game experience.  You can argue whether this is "unfair" (that a pretty vague word), but I'd say it's pretty inarguable that MnK usage causes detriment to other players' experience.  That appears to be the interpretation Ubi is taking.
---
Note that this does not mean that someone WILL actually be banned for using it, merely that they CAN be.
---
Just throw the pants away.
---
After upgrading the system did you reinstall windows? Cause that's a major motherboard driver and CPU change.
---
Also did you install all of your motherboard drivers? Chipset, Lan, etc
---
Both are situational. I think Gridlock is more useful for bomb for planting/covering. Also I‚Äôm in love with her LMG and her Scope sight
---
Why is everyone with my name an asshole?
---
Dam if ur queuing against hem u must be high play/diamond. You wanna carry me
---
Doc it is
---
For this reason is why im always playing lone wolf TH.
---
Put your money towards creating a unique combo of headgears and uniforms, rather than buying a boring set that everyone uses.
---
Ahh one of Xbox‚Äôs finest. Happens all too often
---

Havent got any hate mail on PS4. Of course I disabled messages from non friends. 
---
Can that be done on XB?
---
He's got a lot of armor on lol he's pretty fit.
---
What's your favorite color? "Crayon"
---
me and my friends always discuss this, recruit is a meme pick because he can't have attachments but he is actually one of the strongest operators to the point that simply giving him attachments could shift him from meme pick to s-tier
---
he has ridiculous versatility, having a second utility is arguably more useful than a situational ability and is 100% better than a bad ability
---
we always thought they should make him a full operator called utility and make his gimmick pre set selectable loadouts to prevent OP gadget combos, for example, "flash and clear" gives him breaches and flashes
---
Reported for hacking guaranteed(if they still had that)
---
Did it work for me?
---
it‚Äôs a joke
---
Alright Badger.
---
This is a great cosplay and it is literally echoes haircut, stop being a prick.
---
As I literally just said, copies is what we already got. They have different base skins, reload animations, the M249 has a different magsize and slightly altered model.
---
I‚Äôm offended.
---
I would have diarrhea explosion
---
Dumb luck. My connection is usually perfect but Nokk probably breached it.
