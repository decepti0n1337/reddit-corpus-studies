I know right that fan is just MMMMM!
---
---
---
P90 definitely needs a buff. I really only think it should be buffed if Warden gets it. Reduce its recoil and maybe increase its damage. It doesn’t deserve the recoil it has for the shit DPS it has.
---
I don’t see it
---
That's barely advantage when you're basically trading that out for the utility that a real operator could bring to their team.
---
“This broke dick piece of fucking shit drill”
---
Alibi or Goyo
---
What is this, PAYDAY 2?
---
I wish it were more populated. I used to only play hostage on casual but since unranked became a thing, it's impossible to find a hostage game (at least for me)
---
unless it's traced, that's literally a filter on the image of IQ when you select the op
---
Love me some money heist
---
shields always block me and I die cause theyre in the way. makes it hard to retake. I just cant stand them. and barbed wire is op
---
But meme
---
You're just jealous of the black ice lol
---
I think gadgets could still maintain friendly fire, just eliminate it for gunfire.
---
hey! i would love to have a transgender operator in the game.
---

---
what changes with having a transgender operator in the game? it doesn't change anything about gameplay.
---
Can someone explain what is nighthaven? Did I miss something?
---
as opposed to the C8-NSFW
---
With my luck I would have panicked, let go of the reenforce button, and gotten killed!
---
Alibi &gt; Goyo &gt; Warden &gt; Clash
---
Yes.
---
But this could still be accomplished by maintaining reverse friendly fire, just eliminating or lowering the tolerance threshold for damage against teammates, meaning, if I fire at you, you take no damage, and the damage you would have taken is reflected on me.
---
On a close range weapon?
---
I prefer having one well polish LTM once per season rather than 1 not really that deep per week. Plus the majority of the players get vied if the events after 2-3 days.
---
BEANOS IS
---
Goyo has the best gun out of all of them and being a 2/2 he can roam if he chooses to.
---
The only way I ever see it getting buffed is if Ubisoft removed the ACOG from the MP5.
---
may I ask what’s that sexy skin?
---
You have to remember that Uni can only license so many guns though. Trust me, we all want new guns though.
---
it is, thats why i said "thanks" to a previous comment when the guy said it was commented, which means i did a good job
---
true for the 100th time in this sub
---
sorry for the bad aiming, have played for about 2 months! still learning, and experimenting with sensitivity etc :)
---
Even if they buffed the P90 so it has less recoil and around 26 damage, people will always use the MP5. Quick reload, easier recoil, it’s just better than the P90.
---
It’s just the 10k crimson skin. It’s universal
---
Yep, tho they culd do a workoround like many other games did, but who am i to judge, ill still be playing
---
I can try. I already have lots of suggestions from friends and comments on other projects i’ve posted.
---
Castle Tim The Tool Man Taylor skin
---
CS GO launches in 2012 but if we’re using all games in the series then *laughs in 21 years as well*
---
Ranked you can see the ban screen behind
---
During mad house last year the elite animations still played with those Halloween skins on. So it's not impossible, but I can see why they won't allow it.
---
Holy shit is that Jumping Flash!! Oh wow I remember that too well tol
---
[removed]
---
HEEEERE'S JOHNNY!!
---
Yes but p90 only having ACOG would possibly make it a more attractive pick, I agree it would need a buff or two tho.
---
If you guys want a video we did a knife fight and we got destroyed
---
Its like I said before, you have to always be aware of your team and where they’re positioned. It’s not always the shooters fault either. If an unintentional TK happens, you both share some blame because you didn’t acknowledge where a member of your team was and where they were aiming. If a teammate is peeking a doorway, it might not be a good idea to breach/run in when they could easily be ready to fire on someone.
---
You have to not only consider your surroundings when firing but also when moving. You see Glaz suppressing a doorway? Try finding a different nearby entrance or position yourself to support him should he need it. Don’t run into his fire. 
---
R6 is a game that encourages slow and thoughtful movement rather than rambo COD style gameplay. Friendly Fire plays a part in making it that way.
---
how the shit does it look good while my purple, green and black one all look like glossy plastic
---
is it just the emplacement /your lighting settings
---
I think it’s the new CTU for wamai and kali
---
meanwhile me and most other people would probably get killed in this kind of situation
---
Hopefully they make it similar to Ash and her primaries. The R4-C is statically better than the G36, but the G36 has an acog.
---
??? what?? People were able to shoot me while I was reinforcing, not sure why some people get shot and some dont(like me)? wtf
---
It's ok to say that Ash is ugly since the 'update'.
---
Not sure. I love it tho
---
It might just be the guns design
---
Ubisoft made it . It's in r6s official website when reading about smoke
---
I would love to buy elites that show case their talent/gadget in the mvp animation like jäger, smoke and by far the best is mute imo
---
k/d means little in this game. Teamwork and coordination. Dont get intimidated by high kd players. As long as you give callouts, set up right, and deny some amount of time, you've done your part.
---
Near impossible because both toggles even have functions while not ADS
---
&gt; Siege and most realistic shooters 
---
Hate to be that guy, but R6 is not a realism shooter. Just a tactical FPS.
---
If it was a realism shooter, you'd flinch when you're shot,  your limbs wouldnt stop a bullet from head-shotting you (which is not going to be a thing next update. Limb penetration is something ive been waiting for and im pumped), and run-outs/spawn peeking wouldn't be a thing, because the place would be surrounded and a sniper would drop you from the window or right as you ran out the door and they had a clear LOS. That's why SWAT and the like have overwatch teams.
---
I will admit its probably one of the best FPS's of my lifetime though. Shits way too fun.
---
Any suggestions on the best way to do this?
---
pretty basic for alot of sites to be honest
---
What rank are you playing against?
---
Why don’t we all:
---
1. Tachanka Elite
---
2. Tachanka ACOG
---
No
---
This itself incentivises players to squad up, build bonds and communicate
---
The diamonds of the game realise that and squad up as that is how the game has been designed and why the game has grown.
---
Anyone who takes this game seriously and works on improving to climb in ranks does some of the following :
---
Terrorist hunt, 
---
Custom games to learn maps 
---
Watches youtubers such as kaosx or get flanked
---
Watch Diamond twitch streamers
---
Reviews their own footage
---
What a lot of people don't try which helps just as much if not more is look for players to play with either in ranked games or discords or r6 team finder and if you can't be fucked doing that or get nervous talking to people in a team based strategy fps then stay In silver or low golds with people that just arn't willing to make the effort to improve
---
Dude chill
---
r/hatetobethatguy
---
Thanks man - still trying to play around with different sensitivity/ADS sens, just to see what I can play the best with, and control the easiest. 
---
Right now my ADS sens is at 36 :)
---
Yup ever since Vento Auero was adapted into an anime the state of the fandom has gone down hill i dont even want to associate with people who act childish and screech jojo lines
---
10/10 post would get downvoted by silvers.
---
Causal. Not level 30 yet
---
You know, the cosplayer is a good friend of mine and he enjoys JoJo, so I made him this. I just started watching JoJo myself. So, if this isn't completely to your standards, I am sorry, but please dont say my friend ruined it. Thank you
---
I just want Black Ice for my Monty shield. I do like the mountain skin I have for it, but I had to pay actual money for that.
---
It's a hell of a lot more real that cod or other shooters on the market mr. r/iamverysmart
---
Welcome
---
No your friend didnt ruin it you did it was fine until you added jojo onto it and why are you creating stuff related to stands if you just started unless you sped through all the parts
---
they said at the 'six invitational' at the start of the year that were going to do 1 event per season so this is just a little bonus event before the new season drops
---
Dude, why... just why?
---
JoJo doesn't ruin anything, and I am not being Toxic. If you dont like it, just look at another post.
---
Good gaming socks that's why.

I know I actually voted for that garbage game by mistake.

---
So, why does it work in pubg on console?
---
yeah legit, I personally have skins on my characters that I like better then the elites but if I have the animation to go with them then that would make things completely different
---
Nice dude, what ops do ya have/main?
---
You definitely had some stuff to say, but it sure wasn’t a valid argument!
---
There is no Siege in any esports nomination but there is fucking dead overwatch
---
Outbreak was still an event.
---
Ohh wow okay okay nothing wrong with quality of life tweaks!
---
tell that to the opfor in the vid
---
This happens to me all the time
---
 Honestly this is different because it’s siege. Each operator has a distinct flavor and therefore deserves a unique loadout, and while there’s no way we would get infinite guns (it was gonna stop sometime, just maybe earlier than most people like), they could at least give us one new primary every now and then. No one gives a damn about the million different pistols. Just like one new ar every other season and one new smg every other season would be nice, like what they did for Chimera. But oh well.
---
I think the second one is talking about improving the secondary gadgets and primary gadgets to work properly. For example, you ever see some fails where people would throw a nitro and it wouldn’t detonate? Or maybe the hibana bug where it never detonates? That’s what I got from that but I could be wrong, seems somewhat vague and doesn’t really say what issue the gadgets are having.
---
I like that you completely ignore my critique of your suggestion, because at the end of the day what you suggest simply isn't an objective measure that can be easily weighted. Let me quantify my copper statement again if a player regardless of who they are placed with does plays that run counter to what you see at their elo, but they still end up winning against plat players, then yes their rank should still be maintained because at the end of the day the win is the only objective thing that can be weighted.
---
Realistic walking simulator probably
---
Warden my guy.
---
Have people actually needed to explain that?
---
yep. hope they eventually do it with the c8 so we can have a VFG on there and make it the lawnmower it could be
---
Doesn’t look like it’s spinning to me :^)

I’m a freshman in college so I’m busy a lot but I’m on a good amount. I’m doin HW rn but I should be done in like 2 hours if that isn’t too late

---
Yes
---
But he wasn't released with a 30, right? And he's tanking the charts, right? So tell me, as is, does Moz need a buff?
---
Majority will tell you no. For obvious reasons.
---
And yes, people have all the reasons to assume that you are spraying unnecessarily if you are vehemently asking for a Moz buff.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
As all things should be
---
It's 6:36
---
I’ve definitely seen the bugged Hibana pellets before where it detonated but left an awkward ass hole
---
It's 6:36 where I am
---
I'm sorry you have ever needed to explain such a basic concept
---
People say "un-ads leaning"?
---
Yes and its f'ing annoying
---
that, but in spanish
---
Yeah there's deffo people who actually play seriously on console. Though I am convinced that there's a bigger majority of people on console that play games in a relaxed form.
---
I don't wanna call it casually, I just mean that they don't "optimize" their setup. Like playing with headphones, a monitor with very low latency, using a pro controller for the paddle things.
---
All those things are stuff that matter a lot when it comes to how well you can perform and I do think most people  on console just do the typical plug and play with no extra fluff.
---
Invite her to siege and confess.
---
I once had a ping so high that Warden started dancing. I'll fight you.
---
Voi vittu
---
I can agree with this :)
---
We aren’t talking about you or your group, because not everyone is you or your group. Jackal, Cav, and Echo probably have the highest ban rates in the game. Probably 1 in every 4-5 games, an operator that isn’t Jack, Cav, Echo, Blitz or Monty is banned, and that’s the issue. You shouldn’t expect the same operator bans on every map, unless there is a balancing issue with them, which there is not.
---
Thanks
---
Oh no is it back?
---
Majority do.
---
I love the show, one of my favourites, even watched it way back during season 1 when they just introduced it for netflix. Amazing experience to watch, I’m hoping my profits will go to the producers/creators who made the series too. rest in peace Nairobi..
---
She doesn’t have a ps4 only her brothers and her brothers dont have siege

Lmao

F
---
Tbh that's most of what the army is
---
If I go on test servers, get all of them for free. Shhhhh. But I’ll lose all skins and cosmetics.
---
i legit kept staring at it for 1 minute until i realized it's a loop
---
There literally is a reward; charm for the season.
---
the monster appears and you just throw a blanket on it and pretend it doesnt exist
---
I'm offended :(
---
Funny, I too would nope tf out, seal them off, electrify that shit and L E A V E
---
STICKY FINGAAAAAZ
---
It's useless even with a team when your enemy could just move 2 inches back and still get full vision and because your ass is stopping thermite from doing his job your basically wasting your teams own time
---
Ah man
---
thermite can blow up a different wall for all I care I just wanna zap something
---
So when someone else reinforces the wall not fully but covers them their safe but when I do it they rush into the site and kills everyone
---
):
---
It took him 15 seconds to get into the building.
---
If someone brings a shield to a knife only round they should get shot.
---
But I don’t get why it activates when you have a 5 man

Wow imagine getting charged for a fucking Ad lol
---
Are you a copper?

Nice meme

Is not a judge when there's no cav or nokk included 😆
---
BLOCK 100
---
"Free" What is free?
---
What are they giving out for free?
---
nah why? I have a few videos on my phone with my same voice if youre worried im ripping somebodies clips off...
---
Maybe don’t one tap your own teammates just a thought though
---
i like these small events. its a good touch
---
"Quiet". were you born deaf by any chance?
---
You've made several good arguments. Since the EDDs are the only traps that can deal damage (besides welcome mats but those are easy to spot), I guess they should be easily taken out by careful players (but I still think that you should be able to place them below windows).
---
and thats why you should think before reinforcing
---
Lmao wtf are they going to show lol this game has no context or lore
---
looks like her period lmao
---
Solo queuing has been ruining my rank I’m a sliver 3 from gold 2
---
Damn there is a ton of boot-lickers on here
---
Fuze is one of the worst attackers in the game right now, so why the hell would they nerf him?
---
The wrapper turns to glowing ash and dissipates?
---
This is how you're supposed to play siege
---
it's been there since Ember Rise release . And the guy in the video is a cheater
---
No, that headgear already exists and it costs more than 5 dollars.
---
No it's currently on the TTS, honestly if it were up to me I'd just make it so he can't see foot prints from prep phase but I guess that'd be impossible to code.
---
Rtx could do it but it would be costly even with rtx cores. You can "cheat" a mirror by essentially duplicating a model on a specific plane but it wouldn't take line of sign into account. This is literally the kind of stuff that Nvidia imagined when they released rtx but the cards are too expensive and the tech is too costly for a competitive shooter
---
ProdrigoPete is saying it's 1680 R6 credits for each bundle
---
Weird.  I know the color trail has changed since they introduced the idea of his rework and there have been a few times where I’ve been pinged a couple times fewer or have only received two or three pings from footprints.
---
Its an f1 model you blind piece of shit
---
Also raises the hardware requirements which is a bad idea for a competitive shooter. Rtx ain't cheap yo
---
ford owners be like
---
I've been receiving 5 pings for any foot print I scan.
---
How did you get more icons on ur name
---
Why the fuck is Ash using a Remington m4?
---
Is that abella:)
---
Defenders win far more than attackers.  There was a post about it a couple weeks back about it killing the pacing of the game.
---
What do you play on?
---
She quicc, she thicc, she IQ (the proper way to pronounce her name)
---
I thought that was fuze, no jager. Sill don’t quite get it, but it’s cute and well drawn so I’m happy
---
I got this too, fukn a :/
---
Not many girls are playing this game yet. It is difficult for them to assemble a team of 5 people
---
Yeah gotcha, fair enough then.
---
That is called a hacker my friend.
---
Play the game, learn the maps, practice aim and movement. That's all you should focus on right now being so new.
---
Dunno man but don’t let it get to ya! 
---
Honestly I would’ve put a (?) myself if I didn’t see event video cause why sing a folk song lol
---
Wait so could this idea work as like another thatcher and reverse the electrify? So it can destroy batteries, electro claw etc? Because if so I find that could be pretty useful
---
What the hell did you just subject me too?
---
answer then prick
---
When it was two weeks on the tts the game would launch in a hot mess and first couple weeks would be patches and fixing all the issues.
---
If you want to play any of the old maps you can just do the situations, they’ll all still be there, Kanal, Hereford, Kafe
---
I've switched to holo for pretty much every attacker, with the exception of a few. I like to play more aggressive, not just sit and hold angles so it fits my playstyle more. Plus you have more peripheral vision.
---
Play twitch then
---
If you’re a rook, why not, because less intel that they can use is better
---
Thats true just wanted to give helpful critique
---
Mate, I love this game, but I cant enjoy it anymore. I want to but I cant.
---
Well then that’s your issue to resolve
---
Ive been trying to solve it for a whole year mate, beggining to feel like serenity17 lol.
---
I think your first ace was caused by adrenalin, making your skills and reactions way better. Because you were clutching.

Thermite, was back on release day on console. Didn't like siege on console. Gave it up. 3 years ago a friend convinced me to build a PC. Siege has been my most played game on PC for 3 years now. Couldn't tell you who I got my first kill with on PC.
---
Wasn’t even a headshot. That’s amazing. You must have hit 5 bullets.

Or maybe big brains knew there’s no spawn picking option in Casual

😂😂😂 ddosing mnk . Yeah both toke a l ok long time. No doubt i was a victim past 3 seasons from being DDosed ever  other match by little low life kids . As for as mnk goes yeah i play 6 out of 10 players ever match who have mnk but then again at my rank you get DDosed and play mnk players all the time ddosing has stoped and mnk players are largely bad so easy W. Plz dont tell me your one of those guys who is a copper because of ddosing and mnk ?
---
Thanks!
---
Laughs in rdr2 lol.
---
But then it´s even more unlikely to finish opening the pack while in queue.
---
Nope just ttying to look up your stats cuz im assuming your probably a low rank high level player who just cries and cries about the game and its ever ones fault but there own on why the hard stuck bronze .

Frost is the cutest op. Second maybe only to Tchanka.

I love every one of these, I clouding the ones from last time (im refferimg to the one with thatcher, frost, lesion, and black beard) so please make more

damn did they really do Wamai like that

It takes time to do a complete rework they've likely been working on it this year but haven't talked about it because it's not going to be finished this year.

I can use snipers just fine on console, but to answer your question I feel like she'll be somewhere in the middle. Her gadget is pretty good and she has good utility overall but outside of that she won't have much of presence. 
---
 There will likely be people who get really good at her but she's going to be pretty easy to kill for the most part due to her low DPS.

Caveira on attack....What could go wrong ?

When have you past played? They removed duplicates early in the life cycle.

I kill anything that moves in my way . with skins or not . Only the outline of my teammates keeps them safe

This......this is a joke, right?

I never said that would make them more fair. They will be only more fair if they used the ranked mmr to matchmake.

Standing up for the big tech company against the little man.

What a crusader.

Might aswell ask for help, but im not gonna be available this week (probably sunday)
---
Assault rifles with acogs on defence, what, could go wrong
---
So far, from what I can read on SiegeAcademy, r6pl sub and playing around a bit, I'm feeling that she's not going to impact the meta at all. Quoting Dan from Empire, "the new ops aren't going to get meta changing because we already have those gadgets in the game".
---
She's a high risk medium reward op, with good breaching potential, but a more restricted Thatcher. She takes out more, but takes them out slower and with shorter range (3m vs Thatcher's 5m). And still can't prevent bandit tricking.
---
Wamai might be a monster. But Kali will be ok.
---
Come on it would be fun plus there ate attack ops that would be really strong defenders too
---
I’m British and I wanna know what you can but at 16 them
---
&gt;Plus I think kali’s fire rate is bugged on the TS whereby you get a quicker rechamber time if you remain aimed down the scope, over un-aiming after shooting. 
---
This is true. Dudes at TTS reported this.
---
Blitz on defense . What could go wrong ?
---
This looks so good.
---
Literally never seen a better looking Glock
---
It’s the legal age to get a driver’s license, and pretty much nothing else. Long Guns (shotguns and rifles) can be bought at 18, handguns at 21,

Ash was an entire mess on how it was handled. I appreciate that they wanted to give players something to show their appreciation for playing the game before Year 3, but locking the other version behind a pack was a weird move imo. Especially since it was just a slight pattern swap on part of it.
---
I remember someone also brought up awhile ago that her elite skin was also supposed to be a bundle like you buy in the shop for 45000 or so renown but they reworked it into an elite skin. They could've worked a little harder in it though for sure.
---
im unranked because i have no friends and solo ranked is literally hell
---
I’m still on MW
---
You've got some good clips, but there's quite a bit of down time in them, which you could use for text, or a voiceover if you feel confident. If you don't really know how to fill in your down time, just put a clock in the bottom of the screen and speed up the clip until a few seconds before the action picks up again.
---
Apart from these pacing issues, your video was really good, you've got some decent strats and aim, YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE HEAD though.
---
last season, I really didn't want to get silver (I didn't like the charm) so I had 2 plans;
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1. Try hard the fuck out of the game to attempt to get gold or higher (I fucking suck most of the time, be nice)
---
2. Get a group of friends, and just dick around in ranked, and hope to either do really good, or really bad
---
Can you guess what got me my first gold 1?
---
I only play ranked from like 8-12 because I get the most fair games that aren’t either kids or no-lifers.
---
No prob.
---
I have to roam around with a shottie and risk my life to get a 4k
---
This guy crouch walks around the map and gets one
---

i mean in my opinion parsec gaming is the best it mostly relies on the host for latency and quality
---

Where did it say the timing on steam?

They gave him impacts because he would be too strong with the new deployable shield

But still he is an anchor and hee needs some cover , if u take any site in coast its hard to find a nice cover

When exactly is this happening?

Nice

Casual has been toxic from day 1, coming from someone who’s played since then. The entire game is toxic. Shitty console players using MnK cuz they’re little bitches, teamkilling, ppl just being dicks in voice chat.
---
Slow rof=low ttk=not so strong
---
But the one shot down is good to have for that boltie.
---
Sounds like someone's a racist
---
Those first 5 seconds is me.
---
I was 4 points off Plat 2 the other day after winning a few games in a row while SoloQ-ing. From that point on I lost 5 in a row and went from 2 points off Plat 2 to less than 50 points off Gold 1 again. 
---
SoloQ is selfharm and should never be in a game. :D
---
That’s amazing dude
---
I don’t wanna be toxic but is it just me that when I die my whole team dies.
---

I am unsure of age and weather or not he is in school still but I recommend a backpack or hoodie for him. If he doesn’t like these try finding some posters on amazon, however they will likely be a bit more expensive than the other two

If you still have no operators the game will still let you choose recruit

It's no longer a horror game for me, but whoever is in the room frequently has starts upon enemy contact. I don't because after playing for so long, I roughly know when these will occur.

Only the part of you that isn't covered by the reinforcement is vulnerable. So halfway through the animation your lower half is covered your torso and head are vulnerable.

I almost always use echo, I love to get into a room nearby site and cover all exists with yokai drones, so, if anyone gets close to entering the the room, I'll know that they're approaching, if necessary I'll disorient them and kill them, making it hard to kill me.

Of course there is fuse and other stuff but u know, in general

you can stream games with an nvidia card to basically any device. idk if amd has that as well. Or theyre using an online service like Stadia or GeForceNow

Yeah like I said 14 game sis all it took for me this season, so many people seem to struggle though so I thought that I would want to help some people m. This is my 4th season in a row soloing to okay and my 9th time soloing to plat overall

I support this

Probably never. Sets don't repeat.

Well, that's impossible unless you have all items from a certain rarity group. Look it up, OE has no dupes.

Truu I'm crappy bronze 5 and even I keep getting placed with worse people than me
---
well, the dude was really annoying so i started acting kind of toxic too
---
I would say spawnpeeking and gaining 4k with rifle is toxic cuz their experience did got ruined due to their own embarrassment
---
but since you got it using pistol, then its not toxic, its pog and lit.
---
Actually I play more solo than I do in any type of squad... and I don’t usually like playing in a 5 stack because then I can’t hear the game, and fighting against 5 stacks is usually easier for me than solo people because they all play similarly... and with the 4 stack problem I’m in a ranked right now where I’m with 4 random people (all different languages from me) who are also throwing the game...
---
Changing your sensitivity could be a negative sure. But like all thinks when you practice your thumbs and fingers will become used to it.
---
See that’s my problem though, idk if my eyes can’t adjust or keep up or what but when I turn up the sensitivity on any of them I end up over aiming and it sucks. It makes me feel super twitchy haha I’m not bagging on high sensitivity. It’s just not my cup of tea.
---
I know there’s a handful of very good on-going games atm, but Path of Exile isn’t a tactical “e-sports” format fps.
---
nice work bro
---
Wells?
---
pretty dope!  great job OP!
---
Fortnite sucks 😑😑😑
---
My problem isn’t my thumbs. It’s my eyes. I can’t like keep up or adjust properly when the sensitivity is up high. I always end up over aiming.
---
Happens pretty often that blown up walls still look like sollid walls
---
Its called Bella ciao by Goran Bregovic
---
Great! I love it!
---
I went from Plat II to Gold III in one evening. We lost about 7-8 in a row. Now I'm stuck at Gold III.
---
You love to see it
---
Well like I said, I kept my ADS sensitivity pretty much the same (low). Once I'm scoped in and shooting at people I really don't need it to move around much. It's really only horizontal sensitivity that gives you much of an advantage. I practiced with it in T-hunt for a while, bumping it up by 5 once I felt comfortable. Eventually it went from like 25 to 50 or so and now it feels normal. Try raising it incrementally and practicing before writing it off completely.
---
I soloq to diamond on ps4, its possible. Like he said theres always more you could have done. My mentality is if i lose a 1v5, i dont blame others for putting me in tht position but its why couldnt i beat them should i have pushed through a different way, drone it out, did my team die because i didnt lush with them. You have to not expect anything really from teamates and when they are good itll be a bonus. Thinking this way is why i can carry pretty much every game myself at gold 1 and plat 3, i never rank less than plat 1 anymore.

Oh I didn't even know about that. Funny how the first sub I hear of it on is a sub for a completely different game.
---
It's possible but everyone has different luck when it comes to ranked matches, some people may have three ranked games in a row where they have braindead teammates or they could be missing one or two of said teammates. On the other hand someone may have good luck with ranked and have teammates who actually know what they are doing and don't decide to leave after one round.
---
If you're used to this actual configuration, don't change it.  
---
As a left handed, I use my mouse with my left hand, and I use arrows on my keyboard to move around. The thing is, i'm lacking shortcuts around the moving keys to use compared to you who use wasd. I'm actualy having trouble even though i'm not too bad in the game imo.   
---
I tried moving to wasd but my hand instinctively go back to the arrows. I'm sure I could get better at the game by using wasd, but it would require so much effort I think i'd give up playing the game at one point..  
---
TL;DR if you're comfortable with your actual setup, don't change it imo.

I think they're starting to make meme out of it.

I have to redownload the game now
---
Fuck
---
That's not a flex, I just hate the idea of ranked being only to show your friends. The goal should be to improve. I could be platinum right now. I could be fucking Champion if I played with a 5-stack and only played on weekends with the full effect of Adderall. (I have ADHD)
---
Unfortunately, that's not how things work, so I have to improve my consistency.
---
This list is pure clownery lmao. If you want me to elaborate I can.
---
Anyone who has time to smurf has nothing going for them outside of Seige, it's that simple really. I have no problem with people who are high plat/diamond/masters and stay there.

I’m sorry I just enjoy drawing and just wanted to share my stuff with other people. I really couldn’t care less about karma.

Destiny 2 has a ranked playlist that is solely for people who solo queue, we need something like that.

It was done in pen. It took me a while so I’m glad you like it.
---
I enjoyed the halloween event we just had? 
---
Game is still bringing out new content and events, yes this might not be the best event, but you have to remember its mostly just a partnership event/ad to show off a Netflix show. And like they said its basically a limited time event, because it ain’t big like a seasonal one, we already had this seasons big event (halloween). This is just a little bonus.
---
You cant get worse teammates every single game. Do you think that everybody in lower ranks dropped down there bc of their teams? How can someone stay in gold 3 and others drop down? You only drop that low when you deserve to be there. Ive had games where i clutched 2 1v3s in the first 3 rounds and lost, i didnt drop to bronze with those teams for some reason.
---
Yes, setting your ads to 83 makes hip fire/ads 1:1 similar to using a 1.0x ads multiplier in other shooters. It's not as fast as it sounds. I set my sens the same distance on the mouse pad to do a 180 in every game. That way I can develop muscle memory and sensitivity is the same between different games.
---
Where can i get the special r6 and money heist pack?

Wait!!!! So it's not just me who should be ranked high gold/ play but can't get out of silver due to solo queue? Oh man, this actually makes me feel better! Awesome video to represent this situation.
---
There shouldnt be a seperate Playlist that would split the community into 5 seperate queues and would make queue times terrible. Instead, a feature should be implemented into the matchmaker where it automatically matchs 5 stacks against other 5 stacks.
---
Thanks man. I really really appreciate this.

Hey lesion, im breaching... HA YOU FELL FOR IT FOOL! THUNDERCROSS SPLIT ATTACK!

Thats a cool Capitoa headgear.

I've seen it do something, but in the older versions, back at operation skullrain

Do you notice that you are replyint to a comment I made yesterday when the bundles weren't released yet?
---
Its very hard for me to hit someone's head in medium-long range, when he is behind the cover and i could only see his head :/ Sometimes i cant even notice it, when its dark in the room. Maybe its my monitor settings issue or something
---
It tries to do that, but after a amount of time it just matches up whatever, this is especially bad in higher ranks, where it’s pretty much impossible to solo que
---
We **were** defending nice free event. After seeing the price - fuck that shit. It is indeed cash grab.
---
Don't dare to say a bad words about her pistol &gt;:(
---
neither will be meta-changing, but that doesn't mean they won't impact the meta. Kali especially because she isn't just a Thatcher clone, but rather a kind of Thatcher-Buck-Ash hybrid. (she's also quite a bit worse than Thatcher because she leaves a much bigger window for bandit tricking because she destroys allied gadgets; but makes up for it in having enough versatility to allow for the changing of your strat halfway through the round)
---
Wamai also has pretty big benefits over Jäger, mainly in being significantly less vulnerable to Thatcher; I think he's going to be a pretty solid anchor. 
---
the whole "turning gadgets against their owners" thing is not going to do much, except maybe lifting smoke grenades up to the ceiling, making it show the feet of any attacker who might want to push (so it can make smokes waste extra time, but only if he has enough magnets  on one door to counter *all* of their smokes.
---
Don't play ranked from 9 PM to 12 PM and avoid it altogether on weekends.
---
Chaotic Evil
---
The timing
---
In terms of longevity, I think Siege is doing very well for modern FPS games. I'm always running into new players in Casual and it still is extremely active on Twitch.
---
well you got a very valid point there
---
I fall for thinking my teammates will drone way too often. sometimes you forget that not everyone has 1k hours and that it’s not always safe to follow a teammate into a room bc there’s always that person that’s smart enough to wait to shoot me in the back.
---
Went from Silver 2 to copper it sucks soloQ
---
Ok this has gone too far
---
Fr now I wanna do this lol
---
I went from gold 2 to bronze 1 in a night yesterday. Good to see it happens to others lol
---
Its the best ongoing game for cash grabbing and over expensive stuff
---
I never played rainbow6 much
---
I disinstalled the game
---
But I'm reinstalling now and would most likely buy all skins
---
I'm a bitch
---
Straight fax
---
Exactly, these kids are all delusional. I have been solo queing pc every season and have been consistently plat 3 with the last two seasons climbing to plat 2/1. Its just takes so much less energy for noobs to just blame their teammates instead of objectively looking at their lack of skill and fixing it.
---
there was so many new skins on the test server , i hope they all make it to live build, such as the new maverick skins.

What he said

\*Allow us to introduce ourselves\*

I don't get it.

I third this statement

Its a mini event how do people not get this
---
I was asking for tips? What are you even talking about. You may have not been trying to be homophobic but it comes off as homophobic. Also not that it’s any of your business but I’m a straight male and I don’t see how being gay or straight has anything to do with calling out a homophobic statement I’m sorry but you’re acting very insensitive and rude, but thank you for the apology, and if it helps you in any way I accept it.

Is this "No Russian"? Cause that is what it felt like.

There’s a difference between an acog on the 414-C and the mp7 and having an acog on the bosg.
---
Bruh that’s why I said ranked who the hell would want to play casual with mid game joining unbalanced maps and overly short games
---
Oh Well that’s dumb
---
Everybody knew it
---
exactly, and not try to charge people $20 each for advertisement skins with no alternative way to unlock.. Greedy fucks
---
It’s a mini event they stated that. It’s a testing ground. Not to mention it’s a sponsor that means more money for ubi for more resources and paying their employees I like it
---
I dunno man, I haven't played it, I haven't seen it, just heard from other people. All it sounds like to me is a quick and simple advertisement for casa de papel in the fashion which siege has operated as of late. 
---
Not that it wouldn't be cool to see a stronger showing from this event, don't get me wrong; just observing what the event looks like to me, albeit inserting my opinion that I feel it's enough for such an event with a relatively small interest base as a subset of the siege player base.

Setting your matchmaking to hostage only is also free.

Wait, it's **4 minutes**?

F**k no. Nah. 4 minutes of hostage is wore horror than me failing my exams.

I'm pretty sure as long as you use the same ubisoft account everything will cross over.

Don't hold your breath though. They are nerfing him soon.
---
Not sherlocks :(
---
Yeah I get. Personally, as I don’t really touch casual anymore, doesn’t really bother me too much, but favela is garbage and yacht is just... weird
---
Awww poor thing is inbred. Good luck with the brother-dad slash sister-mom. You're probably one of the cute troglodytes with a tail though huh? God bless the internet.
---
I’ve never seen someone trash ubi over a sponsor for a dang elite skin. This community never fails to amaze me.
---
What a scam
---
It's gonna make Mira TOO POWERFUL
---
True that

im on ps4. will that affect anything?

Ubisoft has come out and said it’s officially cheating but they can’t do anything.

It’s ridiculous. You get an elite skin for the same price.

How did this community get nominated best community.

I always loved hostage mode, but this one's got nothing to do with the show besides the hostage mask and two bundles that can be brought only via R6 coins/currency.

Bro you’re gay ass aids. You hate your dad not me. It’ll be okay.

What

They're skins guys, chill

Why you still talking then, uncle genius?

As long as you're using the same exact account it should be fine.

Id like that its in the kill cam but not when enemies look at u

being baited? it literally says hostage on bank when you first log on and it pops up with info about the game mode, how is that being baited?

But I've already found my place. Hence, the high karma.

First of all why bother talking to my post in the first place when you know its a waste of energy? Boy sit down and stfu.
---
They probably just threw this together to get the ad money.
---
Just stressing it.
---
Almost everyone here ignoring the 4 years of free content and focusing on once every few months paid skins
---
Yeah i NEVER play casual without a friend on console. You wont believe how many times a group of 4 strangers will team-kill you and immediately kick you right afterward for no valid reason. 
---
By having a friend with you, you will have a shot at revenge without being immediately removed from server.
---
Probably the most annoying thing to deal with, is people who teamkill and leave. It happens SO often. 
---
Usually these people just get bored of playing, so they ruin your fun as a final farewell.
---
Lol like “ ooh nice ski- aw man i got shot in the head

I agree ela is shit now
---
Bringing a whole new meaning to "suppressive fire".
---
Rank only tell you how long they've been playing.
---
Coz the event is shit
---
A free weekend will be starting tomorrow, so the game should go one sale (≈60%)
---
To be fair, it is trash.
---
gotta love money
---
Oh no, no doubts about that. You make valid points.
---
Definitely watch the Spanish w/ subtitles, but overall season 1 is a nice plot. Similar to that movie “Inside Man” but it’s still very much different in ways. Great series... so far.
---
Best part is the theme music
---
Lower than dirt, loam VI
---
Who uses Remington then nowadays?
---
Flavela and Yacht singlehandledly stop me from playing casual
---
I wouldn't say it's "super loud" but it definitely doesn't turn people into cav
---
EZ no re.
---
They should have a separate mode for hackers as well. Would make cybercrimerate go down to 0.
---
The Aug?
---
Oh it's the only gun you'd give to a jäger buddy to try to bring him to Jäger's level. At 42/720, it's a beast on defense.
---
Literally the worst public matchmaking community I've ever seen. The reddit community is amazing super friendly but holy fuck do I hate pubs. Only game worse with pubs might be rocket league, kids on there have less than zero patience and it raises your blood pressure so fast.
---
Get gud
---
Lol
---
a shooter on a controller is just atrocious
---
If you get an old 870 it will work until you die
---
Loam is fertile soil, thats atleast sandVI
---
What else is there to say? You brought the data and I’m happily proven wrong.
---
I laughed way to hard at that
---
Gotta say.. You console gamers really have an easier time pulling off these highlight clips.. Maybe this play is still possible on pc but the chances of you not dying about 2 kills in are astronomically small.
---
Oh, no I'm on Xbox.
---
I mean it’s not even the big event of the season, if we didn’t had doktor curse I would have been disappointed but we had 2 events this season, we can’t expect the to be both as developed as docktor’s curse or showdown. It’s a little bonus on the side, who cares if it’s good or not just don’t play it, any way it’s gone in 5 days.
---
&gt;  It doesn't automatically record 
---
It does. Because it can't just grab last 5 mins of your gameplay from entropy.
---
Lucky u
---
Nah trust me the team is the best I ever seen for communication and delivery. I mean look a COD right now people are telling the devs exactly what to do to fix their game (skilled based matchmaking) and other stuff and their not listening at all and killing their own title. There's a reason Siege is going to year 5 and still increasing in players.
---
Challenges would have been fun but if were bitching about this imagine if you didn’t get something for completing it, the sub would be all “why did you make the event challenges so hard, it’s only available for 5 days” and then we’re back where we started. I don’t mind hostage either and I do t play it much so this is fun way for me to play it again.
---
Looks like Ubisoft is trying to pull a money heist of their own
---
What would make this not happen on PC?
---
Damn
---
Good for us. Good for Ubi, not so much.
---
Hello tnewtan, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dz5yum/how_has_this_whole_season_went_without_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
But it's not different. That's the point.
---
I agree. I saw the cool screen and thought "wow the map will be made of paper, like the colorful maps of april's fools day!", and when I read the mode I thought "cool so we can all be hibanas or vigils with the bew skin that's so fun!". Then it turned out... no. The map is the same. One Hibana/Vigil per team. And the hostage is in a costume. Yayy.
---
Not sure they'll do that. In the past people asked the support if content was transferable even as a one time decision and the response was usually we don't do that and we don't plan to.
---
When was the last time you played? We've been able to choose specific, individual attacker spawns in casual since earlier this year, back with Operation Burnt Horizon.
---
Defenders still don't get to choose bomb site but they are now informed of what it is before they select their operators.
---
The other day I sat in an unranked queue for so long that the timer actually reset
---
Ahh...  xbox one. Still nice to see a console player owning tho.
---
Welp I'm out. I was really going to get them both. Not at this price.
---
the aim in this vid does the talking
---
Except it’s just hostage mode. Super plain jane
---
Either was the rainbow is magic besides it looking different. Still had less renown, still had the same old hostage mode. Only difference was there was more cosmetics
---
I've seen luckier
---
Ci ho messo un momento per realizzare ma... È davvero bello vedere qualche italiano su Reddit. (grazie di tutto, soprattutto delle informazioni sempre nuove che porti)
---
Elite, some good ones are Bandit, smoke, mira, doc, and ela is looking good.
---
But it doesn't affect gameplay. If someone wants to spend some money on skins, be it elite skins, or battlepass - why not?
---
Playing with loudspeakers and an open mic. Ugh.
---
It's pretty bad and the fact that the bundles to get the uniforms for Vigil and Hibana are only r6 credits (and they cost as much as a Elite Skin does) not worth it at all.
---
So filthy I gotta go clean my eyes
---
Thank you man, I can’t believe so many people are so upset about an unexpected mini event
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but even If you use steam version, you gotta use uplay, so it's kinda ain't matter, aight?
---
Yeah I hate when ping is so bad it just gets me mad
---
Wat happened to the audio at the end. Someone just said nah gonna turn that off
---
I don't really care that much, I was just making a comment on their excessive microtransactions. I can tell you're an asshole not worth talking to, tho. Have a good day or whatever.
---
Copper 5 \*. We need to go deeper.
---
It's a Spanish series that's being distributed (partially financed?) by Netflix.
---
They have a crosover event with Siege, but you have to pay for it.
---
Yes it's very weird.
---
That should be the price for both at least.
---
I would agree with you but the problem is that this event isn't even fun, the worst mode in a map full of sweaty runouts.
---
I personally wouldn't mind this event at all if the skins were available with renown.
---
In queue to die.
---
Yes I too love running out into a hallway that has bullets coming down it. What a genius play.
---
That’s ridiculous
---
I paid for the whole magazine, im gonna use the whole magazine
---
Yeah exactly the bundle is a rip-off
---
50k was just a random number I made up. I’m saying you should win something but you get literally nothing from playing this game mode
---
You gotta use uplay either way so I personally picked the uplay version directly.
---
So console copper then?
---
What a shame, I was so hyped when they said that we could buy the skins instead of event alpha packs, I didn't think even a second that it would only be with R6 credits, I really believe in ubisoft but please stop being that much disappointing every time, I know it's cosmetics but at least give us the possibility to buy it with renown... I was all in to buy the bundle for 45k
---
Reskinning an entire map &gt; Reskinning just the fuckin hostage
---
Are you actually being serious? Am I being punked?
---
They don't buy the rights, netflix will have paid them for product placement
---
The audio got fucked up I’ll repost it
---
I’ve always wished this was an option. That and the ability to just tweak the settings in general, like be able to play all ops and have unlimited rounds and maybe even a resplendent option and be able to switch your op mid round. I mean why not?
---
The sheer stupidity of both you and the enemies makes it so funny
---
Everyone’s say this is the worst event. I personally have yet to play it, but I hope everyone realizes this is an Advertisement for more people to watch the show. It’s not supposed to be a Halloween scale event.
---
Nobody wants to play unranked
---
&gt;excessive microtransactions
---
Yeah, sure.
---
Have a good day too.
---
Nah your good don't worry bout it. Shit happens
---
I've never seen that grenade play used, I'm definitely gonna start using that!
---
Wouldn't you just mute them in the first place?
---
WULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULUL
---
The event is practically a Netflx ad, so Im iust ignoring it. At least the menu music is nice.
---
Everyone is being nice, calm and logical with you. 
---
I'm not though I really hate you.
---
I call these video clips “Jager shots”.
---
This thread is definitely made and upvoted by people that deal with Toxicity fairly often I assume
---
Payday 3
---
Of course it does
---
Im astounded by the fact that someone defends this event. Its ”free”, because its an ad
---
This is brilliant!!
---
VeRy NiCe.
---
No rewards. You can only get the cosmetics via R6 credits, no way to get anything via renown.
---
Usually slam people for mad ideas but this is a great one. Upvoted.
---
The one on the right is literally castle icon seen by a daltonian
---
It will only be ps and xbox if they do
---
That, Dead silence being a perk, Ghost not working when standing still, old mini map, etc. but that's a completely different conversation lol
---
The one on the right is literally castle icon seen by a colorblind
---
You mean you don’t ....but thanks for the unintelligent input
---
And why is this a scam?
---
they didnt have to buy rights to anything mate, its product placement.. they got paid to do this. if they had the rights it would have NETFLIX plastered over everything...
---
I believe some things can and will be fixed, but others might not of course.
---
I agree lmao
---
Perfect imo
---
I say twitch because she’s more powerful, though fuze’s looks much better
---
it’s a legendary one. i can’t remember the name of it but i think it’s like gambler or something
---
Thats a pretty necessary exception though.
---
It's not my ideal game mode, I'd rather play actual ranked but at the moment, the people I at with don't come on
---
Oh yeah for sure but they need to start listening to their community, not sure about other platforms but j Xbox I'm already having issues finding players on gamemodes that aren't super popular.
---
But why complain about a small little event that comes just weeks after a major one? Just don't play it.
---
I’d be able to see what happened.
---
And they vote to kickin' u huh
---
i wish it was
---
I don't know how to phrase this without sounding like an ass, but you can be consistent and still not be good.
---
GridDoc
---
This happens to me too. I believe it's packet loss.
---
CALCULATED
---
I literally use mnk. You don't get banned. Ignorant tbh.
---
It’s a glitch, swap over to another drone for a sec then swap back and it’ll spot the bomb and give you the points.
---
I do, hopefully they will chill with the cash grab events with no effort put into them
---
Oh god, console
---
Eh, Halloween says otherwise with multiple of the same op
---
I agree with solo queue, the rest is totally impossible to do, how can you check if a smurf really stick to his mode? How can you force someone to use his mic?
---
Why does it matter? Do you really believe he will be ACTUALLY 7 years old? If this was a real person do you seriously think the G.E.O wouldn’t take him in just because he’s born on a leap year? It’s not like he is supposed to be literally the size of a 7 year old lmao.
---
Yeah true. Which server do you play on?
---
Allora avevo ragione a pensare che era italiano. Mi ricordavo di aver già visto il no me Alucc ma pensavo che fosse qualche youtuber americano che avevo visto tempo fa
---
You probably got kicked out the next round because you were not able to do this again, right?
---
It's almost as if it's you have a choice to buy it or not...
---
You just said that my gameplay was good. And i said i was consistent. And you said that i can be consistent but not good. You just said it was good 😑
---
It's a 5 year old game that they continue to put out content for that you don't have to pay to get. Alot of other games you'd have to buy expansions for new content. Or even buy whole new games. Could these be a bit cheaper? Probably so but acting they bleed us for money is a bit much imo.
---
there were 5 targets at once and i killed them all.. calm down my guy, my aim is just fine
---
This is why i love console
---
aced so hard you started to lose frames lol
---
I accidentally shot a teammate that spooked me and I was like sorry dude then he just TKed me
---
Ciao means also hello/hi
---
Totally agreee
---
I said u get banned if u say fck on live lol... Pls read before u write
---
console life
---
Change it to Zofia pistol red dot.
---
I think he means in the menu. As in his displayed age.
---
I also think this is a joke, but that’s just me.
---
Having a little too much fun with stim injections
---
make it bigger and make the dot smaller
---
Either Smokes or Bandits. I feel like the M5 has better destructibility and the 870 has dance going for it.
---
Make it more rounded
---
The marketing deparment is like the bulk of the siege workforce I imagine
---
They killed me
---
Because he is a whiner who is stuck acting like it’s season two and not season sixteen.
---
Well off to hang my self!
---
In the bottom left lesion look high as shit
---
Well that’s just how some games go. No need to post a big rant on reddit cause of a bad game
---
I do agree 100% they are overpriced, but it should teach them not to jack it that high of barely anyone buys it
---
The vigil one is nice though I wish I wasn’t broke
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Lmao, i'm quite sleepy atm, but your comment certainly woke me up
---
You just said that "no one like to play 2 same maps" and that "game is dying", and these are not true. Guess who's the retard here.
---
You are new around here right? If you want actual serious discussion about the game r/siegeacademy is the right place.
---
you need uplay anyways, so you could just buy it from there
---
This could've been an actual event instead of a Vigil, Hibana and hostage skin if the proper time and work was put into it. I am a fan of the show, I do not ownt neither Vigil nor Hibana, but I saw the Vigil bundle and I really liked the charm,but after I saw it's 14 euros for a kin of an operator I don't own I just realised it's another one of Ubi's cash grabs. It's sad actually
---
Yeah, maybe paint it or something. Give it a skin
---
Lmao imagine trying to drone out a team of 5 Vigils.
---
3 Cs. Copper, Casual, and Console
---
You didn't know that??
---
Ive watched this 20 times and at no point do I see the reticle come anywhere near me. I see the hole come through the wall after I die but that just means that theres bullet bloom or the reticles arent aligned correctly again
---
Nobody bought the season pass because the ops suck dick not because the game is bad.
---
Where did you get the data on the sales of the season pass and R6 credit? How do you know that their not selling as much as they used to?
---
Imagine this spawn peeking you with a bosg acog
---
Haha nice job :)
---
Don’t treat it like cod and get good at headshots
---
I like it i don’t really know what his gun looks like but good job
---
Turn your brightness down
---
See when ela recoils to the left? Thats when she hits you
---
To summarize: it feels like a scam because they put less effort in but are charging more. It’s not a scam by definition per say but still feels insulting.
---
Lol dude how about read topic before answering? It's not an accident, goyo did it for trolling.
---
I mean you would have to grind for the ops but yeah basically
---
That’s Salvador Dali
---
One teamkill = Ubisoft goes bankrupt, stonks plummet
---
Yet they went completely silent after it was heavily voiced that it was not wanted. Ubi just can't be trusted.
---
wait you are vigil okay
---
your team has 5 vigils in the photo okay
---
so who the hell take the photo
---
Can I get it for renown aswell?
---
no problem bro
---
What show are you talking about? I've been asking like all day
---
Facts.
---
Yes blame your lack of nade skills on the game’s size choice for the bomb chassis
---
It doesn't really matter too much. I have it on steam because I like all my games on one launcher, but it's up to you. The game will be on sale on steam, too, so that's something to think about as well
---
It would have been unique at least. Now it's just casual but the hostage has an outfit. Worst. "Event". Ever.
---
you can't use it/buy items from steam when you don't have the game on steam.
---
and if you get it on steam, all that does is open up uplay. and you have to have steam running when playing the game
---
Total bummer.
---
It's not really like many people buy season pass before X year releases to get all of the new ops for free xD
---
Btw since when you know what kind of operators are gonna be released? Lol...
---
am i missing somethings
---
That spawn needs either a solid roof that can’t be blown through or a line of sight to peek that door from. It’s ridiculous how many times I’ve died to that lol
---
No.
---
You have to post an ace with the op and the mods give it to you
---
Oh no, game sucks, because somebody killed you, what a terrible game
---
This event is an advertisement. Nothing more. You play casual but the hostage is sponsored by netflix.
---
That also works.
---
Toxic smurf cunts
---
If you read it carefully i go to say that toxicity and glitches unfixed for over a year have caused it not one teamkill that is just an anecdote to further prove my point
---
Use rubber bands to make the charging handle and trigger more realistic
---
All those events were mid season events. Like full production events. Whole new maps, new packs and way more skins. This is just a small sponsored event that they churned out for a quick buck.
---
Gamer tag  checks out with clip
---
This new update looks sick
---
Well it’s because they have a deal with Netflix
---
Just force yourself to get headshots and take your time. And welcome to R6 :)
---
There aren’t packs.
---
Obviously there are the pre season purchases of the season pass, but some people will wait to see how the ops are, since this years ops are trash for the most part a lot of people who would of bought it might have skipped out, thus the smaller sales. That’s not a sign that the game is losing players or quality.
---
That’s what made it spooky lmao. At least I got skeleton jager headgear with my 2 Halloween packs.
---
Who cares? Play it or don't. It's free. Get a fucking life
---
I'll eventually check it out but yea from the trailers it seems like that's all it was going to be. I was thinking it was going to be like a 1v1 though lol
---
I think Cavs SMG (with recent buff) would be great
---
Yea you can see right where he gets headshot
---
Yeah
---
So just 40% shitty and terrible ops then? The season pass is a joke if every 2nd character is trash.
---
Damn you really just gonna “K” me like that fam? That’s cold.
---
I mean i think so but i have nothing more than speculation
---
Darth Vader walks out “One big fucking hole coming right up”
---
The recoil goes to the left first...
---
So it kinda ain't matter
---
Who cares? i bought the game for the game not for getting Ads...It's just common courtesy to give something for free, "if you're going to fuck me!" (cit.) .
---
True. I paid 8 dollars for Siege with Y1 ops. I can unlock all ops with renown. If you were to compare the game to say, Destiny 2, buying that day 1  and playing while paying for content releases would cost you well over 200 dollars collectively. 
---
Or, in the time you’ve played Seige for free (coming up on 5 years), you would have spent 900 USD on WoWs sub cost alone. 
---
The only thing I don’t like about how this event played out is a. No renown option and b. It’s just an advertisement for Netflix.
---
Oshit
---
The fact that it's  e v e r y  match.. Oh and with PS4 gameshare, just make a new alt and do it all over again
---
Wamai is really off beat.
---
therm and thatcher were my next two attacker buys, i knew how good they were from playing console. And i got bandit and mute as next defenders bc they r really helpful to
---
Yeah I will admit I’m a bit heated. I’m just so sick and tired of people on this subreddit, and many others, using this same shit reply whenever someone has a criticism of an optional product.
---
If your argument comes down to “don’t like it don’t buy it”, then you have no argument.. It’s like sticking your fingers in your ears, with your tongue out and going “not listening not listening not listening”. It’s a non argument and it’s not even beneficial in a conversation; everyone knows that they don’t have to buy something they don’t like, but that’s not the issue.
---
Xbox live bans you for saying GTFO lmao
---
I swear I heard it before the breach
---
I mean it's not much of a problem when I watch on my phone, but I rarely ever do that. I mainly just prefer dubs. I've been watching anime for years and just started watching foreign films recently. I've never watched a dub for something live action though except when I was watching the Spanish channel at my friend's house which wasn't even a true dub.
---
&gt;Plus it would encourage more play
---
That's what I am aiming for xD
---
Yeah should be limited to Custom matches.

What was the second comment here? It says deleted now.
---
It's not that we're acting as if it's the only thing we can play, it's more like we expected an actual event not just two skins and the option to pick playing bank hostage. And what makes it worse is that it's a sponsorship not just a random game mode handed out like the showdown game mode ( which was fun and different )
---
Pulse
---
Yeah, absolutely love it
---
I mean it was no outbreak
---
Yes, this part is definitely intentional, based on the show's intro.
---
Yep, it’s highly unlikely that anyone playing mid plat to diamond on console is using a controller... idk why Ubisoft can’t use the same discretion that Fortnite and PUBG use where M&amp;KB console players are thrown into PC servers. If we’re being honest the only reason they play M&amp;KB on console is because they can be a higher rank on console than they could be if they played PC and while we’re being honest with ourselves lol.... it is cheating, whatever...sweats have to get themselves off somehow.

I was never any good with Pulse

more alphapacks = good
---
it is, the entire show intro is made in this kind of paper buildings, "la casa de papel" literally translates to "house of paper". The show is about a heist in the Royal Mint of Spain.
---
It doesnt look to good , but the idea of having her and IQ in the same sporting club seemed good sooo... i did my best :)
---
Castle? Castle is a very strong operator.
---
Vibe Check
---
Right, i listed that reason
---
The Proleague Vigil looks way better anyways
---
"what do you mean I have to pay for new content that people put their valuable time and money into?"
---
what you just said
---
It destroys the bandit batteries, opens the floor and gives you a line of sight onto the Mira windows
---
you would rather spend 40$ for the skins than get them for free in a loot box?
---
My guy, it’s not about the “free” thing that set me off. It’s the people who spit “Don’t like it don’t buy it” on every fucking complaint. 
---
As I said in another reply:
---
My worst op is mirra hands down.
---
Does clash count? Cause I'd play eother of them over clash any day. Also I'm a shit anchor but im pretty bad at maverick. Peak wrong angles tol much
---
7-8 losses wont put you in bronze without a reason, i got 6 losses and gold 3 or 4.
---
Everyone starts in gold. I get the same shit gold level teammates as them, how am i winning when they are losing? There can only be 1 reason, someone in the team might be worse than they think they are.
---
If you pick the same objective three times after losing you’re a bad team mate. I’m here* to you teach you why.
---
I saw it as well and didn't understand all the hate. But, this is the only gamer sub where I get downvoted to hell for my opinion, so I wasn't really suprised. I agree with you though.
---
Thank ya !
---
They're planning to I'm pretty sure, the reason they haven't yet is because Sony was really strict about crossplatform play till now.
---
I loved the show but the game mode is a disappointment
---
Well it wouldn't take that long to make all characters have the outfit in the show considering they'd just need to make 3 models (one for each armor rating)
---
It sucks
---
Compensators reduce horizontal  recoil.
---
Muzzle brake reduces first shot recoil ( first shot of every gun is always really high)
---
Flash hider is a mix of both( and also reduces muzzle flash.) Has slight horizontal recoil reduction and a slight first shot reduction.
---
Suppressors and extended barrels are just useless.
---
I believe rogue 9 has a video that goes into the details.
---
I get those too if i join mid match and am spectating, all holes in walls and all open barricades are closed and repaired for me, not them tho
---
but if you tk youre an even worse teammate
---
I’m still sad I never got it in my packs :(
---
Still sporting that Thermite skin though.
---
That’s not what he said.
---
Lootboxes aren’t free after the first one. 
---
I’d rather spend money buying an item I want rather than spend money for a random chance at getting the item I want.
---
Rebels bandit trick the wall.
---
Roll credits.
---
I guess. It just feels uncomfortable to me, I don't like advertisements in things I've already paid for.
---
Well duuh. They finally implemented this

---
Having opinions \*is\* part of life. Imagine living a life where you don't think about anything. How dull could that be?
---
You mean the custom matches right?
---
“New event” more  like an excuse to sell skins that are not even that great really. Come on ubi☹️☹️
---
Echo does a really good amount of damage, especially for a gun with an acog.
---
She doesn’t have the mask on though so what’s the point
---
Oh god
---
Fair point.
---
Every single one of my qualifiers was against plays or high gold, needless to say I bombed every match and am now stuck in copper V (because for some reason, even the people who are trying, the people in copper just cannot play) for the rest of the season.
---
You get 4 skins for that price not one
---
