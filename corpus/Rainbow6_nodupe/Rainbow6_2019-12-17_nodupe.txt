What gamemode is that?

It truly made me laugh hysterically. What an infant ‚ÄúI guess you don‚Äôt care about Ela‚Äù

---
You crack me up, say more stupid things that are funny please.

If everyone dies at the end the defnders win because you failed to diffuse the bomb

God damn your game looks clear and bright. All my corners are so dark and hard to see.

That's a good list, thanks!

See you tomorrow OP

I play on PS4. Home of weekend warriors and children. Lol. I do need to find a team though. Time to network, like I'm looking for a new job!

again saying people don't play someone right even though they're just stating the characters humongous amount of flaws. That's just a sad excuse to say you're losing an argument. I don't want Ela to be different. How the Hell does wanting a recoil diamond on the one gun that doesn't have one make her not a info gathering roamer which she is? How is wanting her shotgun back to the way it was when it was balanced change what she is? How is wanting secondary gadgets that actually play into what she is a bad thing? Giving her impacts or an explosive plays into her roaming ability, a camera would play into her info gathering side. That doesn't change who the Hell she is it gives a reason to be played for what she is. Her mines again I said were lackluster. Meaning they're good on occasion, but compared to all the other traps they're really nothing in terms of useful. Kapkan mines do damage and are giant alarms as they create a lot of sound. Lesion mines are great alarms because you can see which one went off. Frost mats cause a giant bang when they go off and instantly down someone. Not to mention lesion mines also slow people and do damage. Ela mines concuss you for 5 seconds and create an alarms. That's not very effective when in terms of all the other gadgets. They're lackluster not useless, but still on the lower end of the gadget spectrum.

It was Rainbow is Magic which was a special event in April.
---
No because looking past an operator many many flaws and just turning a blind eye is saying they don't care. What makes me laugh is how ignorant you are being.
---
Oh my god he actually said something else. 
---
Do it again, do it again, make me laugh ElaBoy, your tears of rage make amazing lube.

Splitscreen baby.

no problem

This is ping not hit reg
---
nah i think its death note sorry to dissapoint
---
I like how you're breaking the subreddit rules. But go ahead please only gives me more things to report.
---
It already exists as a plug-in in twitch, I can't remember which Streamer had it but I've definitely seen it before.
---
still doesnt justify me not getting the kill just coz the other guy had 60ms ping
---
They should flash impressive bulges on the screen and show where the eye tracker goes.
---
There was a bit of hype over this a while ago, I definitely remember seeing some big streamers using this live on twitch. You should be able to find some vids of Shroud using it on YouTube easily enough. As people mentioned above whilst it is definitely a hugely interesting insight, it is ultimately quite distracting. To use it in replays would be ideal. Your idea of being able to turn it off at the user's end would also be great. There's some pretty funny stuff on YouTube of streamers being caught out taking sneaky glances at certain things when using eye tracking too...
---
Especially when we have whole subreddits for R6 porn?

In ranked btw ( why i'm a silver)
---
Well this is fucking cool
---
Say something else.
---
This is a ping issue not a hit reg
---
More lootboxes.
---
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
---
do you play with friends? 
---
If not you can even talk to the people in the game chat or text chat, the game is a lot more fun with some people and a lot easier.
---
 Try not playing seroisly, play some quick match games and try out some OP's you don't usually play, get some variation in there. Try some random stuff, hide in a corner, try to knife the enemies, meme on them with BOSG Acog. Just play how you're not supposed to.

It‚Äôs be alright if Finkas nanobites acted like that but because of the recharge it should boost the players ho to 120 or 150 of full health and it‚Äôll go back down to 80 and it can‚Äôt heal past that

Hi Jonas,
---
I think eye tracking in e-sports is probably one of the logical next steps to really legitimizing and advancing the in-depth nature of decision making. We should look to use this technology in almost all e-sports to better inform the audience of the minute choices that come from where a player looks.
---
I honestly thought this would be a meme where a player looked at Twitches ass for a bit.

---
Damn this actually made me nervous haha I thought time was going to run out right before you finished defusing. Great clutch. Although Thermite kinda threw the round for them
---
Some people call it suppressive fire. I call oppressive fire. When you unload 150 rounds in somebody's general direction they do not appreciate it.
---
Dude, I‚Äôm sorry, but maverick is a hardcore twink. You fucked up with him.

the mute jammer would be shutting the defuser off after its planted without actually going through the full length of the defuse animation which echo cant do

I want one person in this godforsaken casual subreddit to name one player, just one, who played in USN this year. I‚Äôm waiting.

She has her place as an angle holder. Ela doesn't need to be a meta operator that is in every single game as there are other operators that are in that position. At the end of the day she is a nieche operator that you take on certain objectives.
---
The Office but R6
---
I don‚Äôt mind claymores personally but I see your point. But because you‚Äôre flanking, you‚Äôre most likely alone. It‚Äôs better to have a claymore watching your back than nothing at all, otherwise roamers can sneak up on ya

that is not the nice number. you have memed incorrectly

It was amazing in the teleprompter station. It was cool to see where they pros look and be able to break down the thought process. Doing it in the live feed was kinda weird and took away from the experience in my opinion
---
Jesus Christ?

why is he screaming die tho
---
Lol sorry. I‚Äôm gonna try to get to 69
---
Which part of this is funny?
---
The sad thing is that when I solo queue, i often am at the top, it hurts
---
As long as the tech isn't distracting to the players, I can't see an issue with it
---
the problem there is you are aiming instead of deleting the wall with a shotgun
---
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs loud. When it silent you would die from nowhere
---
Because when im trying to rank up they end up shitting on me and my team, forcing me to a lower rank
---
MAKE A SMURF GUY. Come then go back to your main when your confidence is back
---
Saying I have no common sense is an insult and if you don‚Äôt see that YOU don‚Äôt have common sense.

You probably said that because I‚Äôm a girl.

Shmoken up killen the nokk nokk nokk

You can do that with Capitao bolts too; aim at a spot, make a bullet hole, let your weapon recenter and don't move but switch to the crossbow, ADS and fire.

Consider watching more Pro League. It will help newer players like you know how the game should be properly played. PL starts back up January 6. In the meantime, come join us over at r/R6ProLeague.

I have an alt i use for doing dumb cas shit, my confidence is always there, its just that i am at such a disadvantage when my team all dies peaking one hallway and its 1v4 and i clutch it down to a 1v1 and get fucking 360'd by an mp5
---
You can also grapple up to the platforms so avoid ladders
---
I had to change my username to something more masculine because I could barely solo queue without hearing that, getting TK'd the first frame of the match, kicked based on my name, or sometimes getting followed around if I was roaming or just trying to hold the site (they would walk behind me and ask me questions while the match was going on). It's a lot better now that I hide my gender but I still never talk on mic.

No its really not because you lacked common sense for that statement. No youre trying to pull in sexism as well. Thats entire bullshit and I'll state it flat out. How would it even be sexism when you've even told me what gender you are, how would I even fucking know?  Because I couldnt. So don't even fucking try with that one here. I said you dont have common sense because you assumed i was talking about your hair when it was quite obvious i wasnt. You lacked common sense. Not because Oh im a girl you're a sexist! No its because you didn't fucking show common sense there.
---
You should take your own advice and wave your white flag. This painfully cringy on your part. Start to finish bruh.
---
I really liked it. Tbh I wish they did this for PL finals and SI and other major lan events. It's really cool to see the eye movement of the players and see what they see essentially
---
I loved watching this. I used to watch streamers that did that, and it taught me a lot about where and when to look around the map

Yeah, I believe that's how you make Wamai do the dance.

On pc it doesnt auto ads when leaning

No problem! But like someone else said, just have fun. That‚Äôs what makes it worth it :)

It's called trolling. It's a form of art for top intellectuals like myself.

Worse than thatcher‚Äôs? All she has to do is place it direct center of two walls and she can get mute jammers, bandits, and kaid‚Äôs. The only way to counter her is by placing kaid charges on the roof but only slightly touching two walls.

of top tier trolling.

Invalid game mode name
---
only thing i would have nerfed is making the rebolt time when ADS'd a bit slower so you can actually move your character before kali shoots you again.
---
I think its really cool but does anyone else get like watery eyes looking at it??
---
That's a Nerf.
---
And blitz is already silly at higher ranks. He's weak.
---
We don't need any more Nerfs. We *might* need a ground up rework.
---
So can thatcher. And thatcher has a larger radius and its easier to counter bandit tricking with thatcher than kali. Plus thatcher can get gadgets through unbreachable surfaces and hes not limited to walls
---
I didn‚Äôt see you lag ?
---
Hate to burst your bubble but pretty sure there aint no BOSG Black Ice its too new of a gun. No Black Ice for guns that released after Buck/Frost. Only new OPs with older guns get it.
---
If you mean bosg I don‚Äôt think it has black ice.

Empties 4 rounds on him, zofia dies in one.

My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

Goga. World's best support main.

---
Nah, here in the ol murica we say 1.5 and .9730
---
Ye it's a nerf but we could also buff at the same time, maybe a faster ads or a bigger,wider shield that covers his arms more.
---
she can also rappel up to most of the outside doors
---
Public shaming.
---
Wouldn't mind.
---
For Ela, scorpion easily, shotgun if you wanna mess around. For dokkaebi, use the dmr. Bosh is definitely for fucking around or if your really confident in your aim. And attachments are honestly up to personal preference, so feel free to mess around with whatever til you find something you like
---
Yoooooo I have the same shark plushie! Got it from Ikea xD
---
I like how he's shooting another defender not attacker.
---
It is a smurf. Idk why they think it's fun to fuck with new players but apparently it is.
---
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yes where fuze fucks an ak
---
What about secondary weapons?
---
I want Nomad tooü•∫
---
I can hear it haha
---
For the 3 years I‚Äôve been playing this game I have never understood why people smurf, even when I transitioned to pc I didn‚Äôt play newcomer cuz I didn‚Äôt wana be stuck with all the newbies
---
Why are you holding an angel mid game? Part of your religion?
---
You gave a twitch
---
We indeed exist and somehow dies second next to ash mains
---
The point is moot because it's just a casual match. Literally the lowest stakes available in the game.
---
have you considered turning down your ads sense? cuz you really be spraying that ak
---
thats the thing chief. 90% of the time you get team killed, i will bet its a doc
---
Well, ela has only the one pistol, and dokkaebi‚Äôs smg has insane recoils and her pistols kinda average, so again, just mess around with either her and see which you prefer
---
Depends on your budget. How much are you willing to spend. (Also, which currency)
---
I recently did that to myself, is not a good feeling
---
Blitz didn't deserve it. Especially his eyes.
---
I know that feeling. Dealing with the toxic guys who don‚Äôt think we should be playing siege. Wether it be on your team or the enemy team. If you‚Äôre ever looking for more people to play with. I‚Äôm down, always nice to see fellow females in this game.
---
I‚Äôd be willing to play!
---
r/rainbowsexsiege
---
That's going to cause 3 armors to rush Kali. Her ability can't even take out a electric claw depending on the location of either the claw or the charge.
---
A 308. Round is a 7.62x51mm so ubi got it right
---
Last time one of these posts came up, I mentioned that there's a lot of misflaired posts, and there's been no improvement on that. Surely with such a big mod team it's not that hard, these posts are misflaired for hours.
---
For the people saying iTs A caSuaL: It's not about winning a casual game, it's about shutting those fuckers up. They didn't utter a single word and left immediately.
---
For Dokk: MK14 with Muzzle brake/flash hider, Vert grip (angled grip once you get good with the recoil) and ACOG. For secondaries, use the CZ75. The DPS is ridiculously good but the iron sights suck ass, but it‚Äôs better than the nightmare that is the SMG-12. Run Frag grenades if you want more killing potential, smokes if you like being supportive. 
---
For Ela: Shotgun with Vert grip, extended barrel, whatever close range sight you want and a laser. The reason i suggest the shotgun over the SMG is because the SMG has horrendous recoil. On console it‚Äôs literally uncontrollable but on PC it‚Äôs manageable. I‚Äôd suggest using barbed wire over the shield because wire is, in my opinion, more useful than the shield. The shield is handy for camping behind and popping out of with a shotgun when you see someone through the slits, but that‚Äôs situational whereas barbed wire isn‚Äôt.
---
Fuck toxicity
---
I‚Äôm a guy and usually when me and my friends find a girl in the game, yeah we can act weird as hell sometimes and that‚Äôs funny, but being directly sexist like that isn‚Äôt cool at all. What an amazing way to show them up by getting a 1 v 4 clutch. Good job :)
---
I feel like it's these kinds of clutches in siege that make me love the game so much. The kind of stress that makes the heart pump and keeps it pumping.
---
Kick ass job! Fuck the haters, you're better than I am. I would have messed up for sure!
---
I'm so sad I was just starting to get good a Clash üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I probably should, I think it's at 50 for me. It feels ok and I play on 800dpi but when I'm stressing out (like here) I tend to jerk my arm too hard sometimes.
---
Yeah. There are no Chinese servers. Only Singapore and JP/KR
---
Excluding monitors and peripherals I‚Äôll say 1k-1.2k. If I can get something good around 700-900 that would be nice too.
---
He‚Äôs peaking the roof. They don‚Äôt spawn on the roof. They rappel from spawn up onto the roof.
---
Not about winning a casual match, I just wanted to prove them wrong.
---
50 ads multiplier is okay, maybe turn down your base sens instead
---
I can spend about 1.5k total but if I can get something nice for less that would be nice
---
Gamer moment

Struggling to understand your point, care to elaborate?

Good for you

Even so Japan and Korea are much closer to China than a literal continent away.

The moral win from situations like this are so much more rewarding than the in game win
---
I dont know. That video quality is so poor I cant tell lol
---
True. It's just so common that it's no longer impactful. It's lost its shock value completely.
---
Good kill!
---
My niece plays fortnite and destroys in that game and I couldn't be prouder. Playing siege with females are actually a lot more fun imo. They bring a different dynamic compared to all the bro dudes I play with. Keep gaming and keep destroying all those haters that don't know how to talk to females.
---
Or the easier thing would have been muting and reporting them(also record the things they said), and not caring what cucks in some online fame think (especially if it isn't ranked)
---
At 6 pixels.
---
Exactly. How did the enemy team even know she was a girl. Unless she was advertising it in chat for that attention.
---
I know what VSync does, but it shouldnt be choppy should it? My monitors rfr is 60hz but Im saving up to a 144hz
---
At 2 pixel and atleast 1 fph
---
I'm like... Gold good lol not claiming to be great, also under a lot of stress.

Guys ain't toxic cus they don't get sex? It's just unfortunately the culture in gaming, to say women are inferior.

Honestly bothers the crap out of me how many shit goblins drop "ggez" in the chat.

Where can someone like me obtain this masterpiece of a profile picture?
---
The siege community is filled with mysoginistic virgins to the point it's sad
---
Wow, what a lovely comment. I particularly like that you put "every gamer girl that gets harrassed" in quotes as if ig is  not an issue. Yes, some female gamers/streamers get white knights and neckbeards who worship them and give them free shit. This does not mean all female gamers are like this.
---
Have you ever considered that many female players also don't *like* the special treatment? My GF hates when she is treated differently specifically because she is a woman. 
---
Also lul at "my" front page as if you own shares in reddit, fuck out of here. Some boomer think lmao
---
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind!
---
If the worry of sexism in 2020 is some opponents in a video game giving you the same level of troll treatment they give everyone they encounter, then feminists can give up this attention seeking shtick because we have really lost the boat

This is unbelievable lmao "advertising it for attention" jfc

Casual IS a valid game mode... you make it sound as if you ranked is Outbreak and casual is Forza. When the truth is casual is a scrimmage for fun 
---
(which casual fun competitions are a normal thing: unless you are small minded when it comes to understanding enjoyment of social interactions)
---
And ranked is a tournament. 
---
So, you can't simply take out the part of the game people play to relax and enjoy because you would have people forced to play a version of the game where people are trying to the best of their abilities 24/7. That may be fun for you, but a lot of players don't like to try their hardest 24/7 for a rank. They enjoy the intensity of the game without having to keep a rank or care about a loss compared to Ranked.

Works even better if you‚Äôre a guy, cuz toxic fucks are always homophobes. And there‚Äôs no good comeback for it. They either shut up, get angry, or carry on the joke and the situation de escalates.

Imagine having to be a shitbag to get an advantage, I mean fuck, if pro leagues can not be toxic and win, I think you just need to stop relying on being a walking dumpster fire and just actually get good.

They made comment on Twitter around the start of December stating that they took our feedback from the mini pass and are working on improving based on what we said. Itll be coming but they will let us know before it does.

Well take comfort from that Sony and MS mostly make their profits from % of the sales on their platform so atleast they don't get your money through game purchases and Plus/Live subscribtions.

So you cant even follow what you said.... and how I replied, and you didnt address it, and started saying more before responding to what I said. Its easy look at the thread. You still never answered me

---
&gt;...ok , and?
---
*And* there is clearly a disproportionate response and over the top insults that is very common online when it becomes apparent a girl or a woman is playing a game. It should be understandable why this is disheartening to girls and women who want to game online and not have shit talked to them *solely* because they have a higher voice and have a vagina. 
---
Spawntaneous on YouTube has a 12+ part video series titled "OMG a girl!" that compiles most of her experiences gaming in Siege. 
---
It's really easy to just say "shrug it off" and be *whatever* about it but after awhile it wears down on a person and it gets old. You can't expect someone to be okay with specific targeted harrassment and roll with the punches. It isn't okay and that behavior shouldn't be normalized.

I like the smg 12 more that the other one. I always seem to do better with it but its really just whatever you like

I sure don‚Äôt know what I expected sorting by controversial but still I weren‚Äôt ready for this
---
I didn't say they weren't toxic.... I said they ain't toxic cus they can't get sex. I 100% agree they are toxic
---
JJBA in a nutshell.
---
Wait why were you playing R6 instead of cooking?
---
It's a bit overkill
---
Sooo that was a lie
---
Possible, yes. The bolt was community pressure.
---
Now people will realise how useless a bolt action can be.
---
I'll check it out. Thanks
---
It's probably part of Ubi's classic limited time skin/bundles.
---
Pisses me off to no end that I can't purchase some skins because I was taking a hiatus or didn't get into the game early.
---
The most fucked thing I ever saw in siege was an older brother playing with his little sister. She was maybe 12 and he was 16+ (couldn't tell). At one point the little sister talks and the entire team starts making fun of her for being a girl. And the brother joins in. They made rape "jokes" and called her names I'd rather not repeat but instead of standing up for his sister, the brother joined in. I haven't liked Siege since tbh.
---
That was fucking awesome OP! I love those clutch situations, and in your case I bet it felt even more satisfying to beat those clowns on the other team!
---
Yeah. It has the highest DPS in the whole game.
---
Everyone knew it was a joke including concept.
---
Umm.. uh.. Sims 4: Discover University ... expansion PC $19.99?
---
Thank you!
---
What a clutch! Good play!
---
Good try, but it's over used. Give me something more original.
---
Did you ever play Sims Castaway Stories? It was surprisingly fun!
---
You never asked a question aside point out where i said that. I was pointing out why i was not sexist and i explained myself you seem to be the one who doesnt understand what they are saying repeating themselves in a horrible attempt to redeem themselves.
---
Yeah, I've had a rando do that during an interro and down me in the process too.
---
For real  though, I can relate.
---
That's absolutely horrendous and inexcusable, but it actually happens all the time. Most guys would rather join in on the bullying than be targeted at all. But that guy is like.. on another level of fucked up.
---
&gt;that's just proof that siege is mostly populated by childs/manchilds
---
Sadly, that's the case for most games apparently. The mix of a relatively young audience in most games and the anonymity of the internet doesn't go well.
---
You say they were a group of jerks.. but I'm not hearing it.. or seeing it in the chat.. usually when you get assholes, they are constant.. I feel this was just clickbait titling.. don't get me wrong, awesome clutch. I just don't understand how the title marries up with the vid. they gave callouts, and stayed quiet so you could hear etc.. no toxic text chat.. 
---
My wife has been on siege with me since day 1. and this kind of behaviour is no more frequent then assholes being assholes to anyone. 
---
It is a particular pet peeve of mine when girl gamers play the bullshit cards like this.. and act like its a gendered issue. it isn't. an asshole is an asshole. if the person sounded arabic.. they'd call them a terrorist. if they sound German.. a nazi.. etc etc.. 
---
as a guy with a gamer wife, and an upcoming gamer daughter, stop making it out like its this dark and awful place. It's fine. 
---
I await the white knights downvoting a dissenting opinion. 
---
as I said, nice clutch.
---
I don't know if it's because I'm an older (30) chap than most of the people I play with / against but I usually tend to encourage girls to talk more ingame and engange with them so that they know their part of this whole thing just as any other dude would be.
---
You rocked this round and played better and more composed than most toxic kids I have played with. GJ on winning this match for your team. Getting a win is always good but it's even more juicier when the other team thinks it needs to trash talk you or your whole team. I love those wins more than any 4:0 win.
---
As a girl, the second guys start to trash talk you or start using abusing words, mute them and straight up ignore them. That hurts them more than any insult you could ever throw at them, because you can't get rid of shit by throwing more shit at it ;)
---
Where do you find these stats?
---
Thats some class gameplay.
---
I've only played sims 4 and.. honestly just played it to live that vampire life.
---
What does toxic behaviour have to do with the game mode?
---
You done fine, you smoked them all sp
---
That you know of...............................................?
---
I hate backseaters because they fuck up me getting focused if they're just talking non stop.
---
No
---
Keep on keeping on!  Glad there are at least some women out there that manage to persevere through this community and the way it reacts to ‚Äúgamur girlz‚Äù
---
sneak
---
My sister has to deal with the same shit, some people are just so pathetic honestly. You anhilated them awesome job!
---
It's cool, I only ever played it to build houses and make people woo hoo in them.
---
In my personal experience, siege is one of the most toxic communities I have come across, it beats out overwatch and call of duty.
---
I'm not strawmanning, and it's astounding to me that still, reddit's seemingly favorite counter argument is "heh nice strawman". It is incredibly overused, and usually Incorrect ly. In this same thread, another commenter pondered that this girl was fishing for attention in chat, which is where I got the attention sentiment from.  It comes down to the fact that you, or me, as males, usually cannot be completely understand how degrading it is to simply be a certain gender.  
---
"Contrary to you, I don't judge people based on their gentials."
---
What are you on about lmfao.
---
I completely agree with your statement on the problem being everywhere, as if that somehow makes it okay. I never said it was specific to siege. Saying "it's a game" makes no sense because this issue is not just in gaming. It is everywhere.
---
But there isn't a kitchen on that map....
---
There is no point in droning if you are so far away since by the time you react he can be anywhere if anything it gives you false sense of security. Also you always want to start working on the plant with at least 30 seconds left because any half decent player knows to jiggle and waste your time until you can't pull out
---
I wish I could upvote this comment more than once.
---
Nani the fuck?
---
"man they really want you dead" "I would too, he's black" OOF
---
Go back to the kitchen
---
You know.. that extra bullet can come in clutch üòé
---
Hell yea man. I can't wait to see the final finished product. You're way more talented in this area than I could ever hope to be so I like seeing these updates lol. Keep them coming dude!
---
You go girl, I'd never be able to clutch that :)
---
Yes I‚Äôve been having this problem reset internet reset Xbox do speed test get 150 download 30 upload . I‚Äôm wired I disconnected other devices from the WiFi can‚Äôt fix it
---
I've read that it was meant as a joke. But telling from your behaviour and the (helpless) responses of the child this turned into an abuse of a minor. Have you ever listened to the voice of the kid? At this point it s not fun. It s humiliating.
---
Well played!
---
Personally I don't experience much adrenaline rush in siege. I did when I first started but after getting used to playing and it's not near as bad anymore. I mean I'll get a little bit of a rush here and there but it's very controlled. Only sometimes will I feel like my heart is beating out of my chest.
---
IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME
---
You kept much more calm than I would have in he 1v4! I'd have likely died to the guy rushing in from outside after I missed my first spray. Good stuff
---
Last sentence is a fuckin shmood
---
I feel you, even though I'm not a girl, I'm very inconsistent in my gameplay and sometimes teammates just keep shouting in our ears, "The enemy is there, the enemy is here" it gets very confusing and for you to prove them wrong, good for you.
---
not on original ps4 you dont have it sadly
---
30/31
---
Shit, gotta reload!
---
The sad thing is that it was actually not a glitch, like a year ago, but they changed the screen to what we have now.
---
I disagree. Most siege players are literally a toxic waste bin capable of starting a super hero villain if you you're exposed to them.
---
You had me until "inverted controls" lol.
---
Creative, but wouldn't work in practice.
---
There are tons of people looking to play with others on r/R6STeams , just invite them and play a couple rounds. If you dont like people you play with, you can always not play with them. My clan does not have really active r6 community(most of us play battlefield) so i do this sometimes.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As others said, you can contact me if you need someone to play with. Im in EU but i can also play in NA with (i think) around 140 ping, was plat3 5 seasons ago and havent really played ranked since(you gotta leave when you are on top). I generally play solo casual or sometimes duo with my friend. I'm all about enjoying the game, win or lose i dont care.
---
If you're a real gamer girl, why did my wife leave me and take the kids? üòé
---
Oh really? I heard from some people that surround sound is bad but apparently not. I'll look for some
---
7.1 surround sound is an option on PC only with their Logitech Software. I haven't really played R6S with 7.1 SS, but listening to music with it on is pretty cool. (The G433 has a USB Soundcard and a 3.5mm to Headphone/ Microphone afapter includet in it's box)
---
You cannot call someone a cunt because ubisoft doesnt want to support toxic behavior. As to your other complaints, they are flaws, but really so unimportant that its a wonder someone can get so upset about these
---
I know, it's fucked
---
Wow, a spawnpeek on plane
---
Because her name was Karen, duh.
---
DLC Ops are often just "better" versions of the original 20
---
Well it helped me a lot. Haven't had trouble telling the direction of footsteps since I got my headphones. Maybe it's just me tho
---
Playing Escape from Tarkov really trained that out of me, gotta keep track which mag has how many bullets left in it. No more R spamming for me ":D"
---
Ight well mine aren't surround sound so that probably why. Thanks
---
But what could the offended 13yr old snowflakes complain about them?
---
Should've just called the bully hunters lol
---
yeah that helped a lot with picking a new op,correct my mistakes.
---
Fuck the haters. Play what you want, especially since you play like 100 times better than me, a PrOuD gAmEr.
---
Alright thanks though
---
How did the enemies then find out that you are a girl if you are so careful?
---
?
---
Not really buck can be called a better sledge but he isn't,sledge has more destruction plus he 1 hits wires and maestro cams plus sledge has much less recoil, but this is literally smoke 2.0 throws smoke canisters with a slightly different debuff, unless the regular smoke gets. Better gun or an acog no one would ever pick him over this new smoke.
---
Sure they werent sarcastic?
---
dude, I once hit the 100% because even with a 99.8% change I didnt get it
---
It's nice!

[removed]

Shut up incel

I like it, and yes I understand that
---
Alright :) but thanks for this amazing discovery
---
Damn that was nasty! Good job
---
It‚Äôs.... a .... vid... are you ok?

Lol, together we are unlucky. This is an older image, but I'm pretty sure it was an uncommon as well.

‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
cool, is this 3D modeled?
---
This comment doesn't have the likes it deserves
---
Nope
---
It may be sloppy, but you did good and got the job done.
---
Change your gamertag to have a girls name in it and you'll get kicked or TKd like 80% of the time.
---
i thought that finka was a chanka turret in the window
---
Im not even surprised, everytime someone mentions they're a girl, the whole community goes ape-shit, and im just like, cool
---
The skin was made because a group of former R6 devs went and made a new studio and the first game that studio produced was a critical and social hit. So to support the studio and show love for former team members they gave the charm and weapon skin for free.
---
Well, I think they got what they deserve. Anyone can play games, if they beg to differ, that's their problem and their's alone. Good job!
---
Doesn't matter if it is common. Getting agitated at that is basically getting agitated that you can't shout at somebody and call them a female genital, which is a silly thing to go agitated over.
---
I can understand if he was getting angry over client side debris or ddos but no, this dude gets angry over....."c*nt". Of all the painful things in the world to get worked up over, be choses this. Maturity 0/10.
---
Mods should start pulling posts on grounds of sheer stupidity now.
---
And we already have a defender with vape. It's smonk. Just call him!
---
BADSOLDIER 7681.
---
I'll see you around!
---
Good to know that you can delay Bandit trick for sooooo long on X-Kairos. For Thermite you need an actual skill and really good timing to get Bandit trick successfully, Hibana on the other hand feels broken as fuck. She needs a minor buff.
---
So proud of you üíúüíú
---
Nice clutch mate, i used to be same always panicking under pressure it was even worse when I played at a college lan tourney. You just have to remember its just a game and you will gain confidence with time . Right now i have around 2k hours in csgo and 600 hours in siege now i panic a lot less in clutches then i used to.
---
Thank you and would you like to play
---
Yeah but the difference is, you cannot use an Ela mine against her or the defender. Defenders know where they are and frankly they have no business chilling around a mine. But for smokes, attackers have exactly what they need to benefit from it, so warden having them basically makes him an attacker on defense. Won't do him any good regardless of how good he is.
---
Just don't play casual then
---
No commentary, no transitions and it‚Äôs console
---

---
Finally some good fucking skins
---
Noice! :D
---
Listen mate, if someone is a dick towards you in R6S, just shoot them in the head, win the round, assert your dominance, show them you are the most operator out of them.Nice clutch.
---
I honestly really like this idea
---
But what if people just want to relax and meme around. I don't always want to try my best in ranked. You should try casual recruit rushes sometimes.
---
niceeeeee
---
Yeah I saw you say that earlier, and note I‚Äôm just curious here, but how did they know you yourself were a girl?
---
I think so
---
Black Ice is a nice skin but honestly I‚Äôd kill for Glacier. That‚Äôs a *real* nice skin but Siege youtubers like to clickbait black ice and now it‚Äôs become overrated.
---
Test
---
oh you're a gamer girl? Name every game then
---
You kid, but weren't they supposed to make his fog clear, or did that already happen? I haven't been playing much lately.
---
But thats the thing, its not super offensive in all or even most cases to australians and im sure the poms wouldnt find it that offensive either. Its just a word. Ive greeted my team with "gday cunts" and it doesnt go through even though im being friendly. We call our best mates cunts. It doesn't have to be offensive. I mean it can be, but so can fuck and thats generally only used in a negative context. 
---
 We can still say fuck and shit which probably offend just as many people so why is cunt banned. Why not have an all or nothing stance on it.
---
I understand where you are coming from and a potential increase to the minimum level requirement for ranked wouldn't be that bad of an idea, however, lvl 80 as the minimum is way too high. I've had friends who I started playing with when they where around rank 60/70 and we not an issue due to their low rank.
---
Of course, not everyone is the same, however, you are going to seriously hamper a lot of players with such a higher requirement. If anything, switch Newcomer to "Max. 30" and Ranked to "Min. 50" as this level is a good amount of time someone has to spend with the game and at that point, casual just isn't going to cut if for them anymore.
---
Or just give a bigger incentive to join ongoing matches ... like more renown. 90% of the games in Casual are ongoing games and it pisses me off.
---
Exactly this. Why would an attacker want to make a door that can be more useful to defenders lmao
---
Oh I see.. thanks
---
She needs a buff tbh, she‚Äôs completely useless playing against a coordinated team. The window should only break when she actually gets to it and the controls shouldn‚Äôt be locked for as long as they are when you make it through the window.
---
Because people are too quick to jump to conclusions.
---
Ain't that the truth, I have never been more stresses/relieved at any other game more than r6. When I am focusing hard on a game I will usually stand up since my TV is higher up than I am, aftering clutching a 1 v 5 in ranked match point overtime my legs were visibly shaking and I could feel my heart beat in my head. The funny thing is about that is I was in my pajamas already after taking I shower and It felt like I ran a marathon.
---
Ongoing match? No thanks. I'd rather wait or find another match.
---
Flair checks out
---
Well seeing as the community is a compilation of either toxic children who throw and scream, or sweaty tryhards. It‚Äôs almost impossible to win any games in the gold/plat range unless you have at least a three stack.
---
This sound great, just a few tweaks like maybe no ela disorientation and no traps on it. Sounds too op currently.
---
Now I want rainbow6 cookies...
---
Damn love! Put those sexist bastards in their place!
---
Big sigh of relief when you won! so glad you won and how people like that didn't put you off playing too!
---
What a great community we have!
---
I thought it was obvious that this was a joke?
---
Kitchen is a place where the art of cooking occurs. I don't know why some people think that the art of cooking is for women only. also military services are forced in our country, teaching us that every work is done better in a group, so is the cleaning or washing dishes. the message is: Stay Equal
---
I don't see her being used in PL kinda like how Amaru will never be used and how Nokk is basically a troll pick of she's used, both Goyo and Wamai will somewhat of a use.
---
To act as if women don't experience harassment in gaming solely based on their gender really shows me how tonedeaf you are.
---
Dead people can be a fantastic source of info in siege. When you are dead you can swap to any remaining drones you have on attack or cameras if you are on defense. They can keep an eye on where an enemy might be and relay that information while you focus on shooting and stuff. Obviously that doesn't always happen but dead people can be quite helpful sometimes.
---
This win would be even better if it was in a ranked game but gg anyway!
---
Scoreboard says you killed someone else, im still very confused.

Ah look, a woman posting on reddit.

Nice clutch!!

Xbox is the problem, the ps4 community is quite good

Goddamn that shit was stressful af
---
Damn, you good
---
Might sound petty but I just stopped playing because of all the toxicity, especially since most of it came from my teammates. Like if I kill someone on the other team and they get mad at me fine whatever, be mad. But when I‚Äôm trying to give callouts or advice or even just chatting with the team, I‚Äôm not a big fan of being called a nigger and getting into stupid arguments and friendly fire fights and the like. My favorite game was when I was *taking too long* in a 1v5 trying to clutch after my teammates rushed in and died not 30 sec into the game, so they just spent the entire game calling out my position to the enemy team in chat.
---
I‚Äôve been teamkilled on a nearly daily basis, I‚Äôve heard every insult known to mankind and been called every name under the sun, I‚Äôve been overly criticized on everything from my voice to my loadout, and I‚Äôve learned the horrible truth that my mother is a whore who‚Äôs fucked every sweaty nerd who‚Äôs played the game. I just couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore so I just stopped playing Siege, which is sad since it‚Äôs still one of my favorite games despite all of its flaws. 
---
And I know what some of you are thinking, ‚ÄújUsT dIsAbLe ChAt AnD mUtE eVeRyOnE‚Äù. To which I say no, it‚Äôs a team oriented shooter and I like trying to help the team in any way I can, I shouldn‚Äôt have to throw away a big part of the game I enjoy just because some people‚Äôs parents don‚Äôt love them and they have to take it out on others.
---
He should only get one, other than that I guess it‚Äôs an ok idea
---
holy fucking shit i got so tense my ass still hurts ggs girl show em whats good
---
I'm excited. It looks great!
---
Are you game sharing the game from someone? Cause it will show the bundles that they bought in your news feed
---
Yeah I know right? Much batter than casa de LA papel
---
This \^
---
In the play store or in the game shop?
---
There's an ongoing issue with people who have succeeded in buying credits not receiving them so they've probably disabled it until they can get the issue resolved
---
Honestly that last kill was only because their last guy was trash. You woulda never stepped foot into that room if he was any good stomping around like that. Good kills non the less, sorry they were being rude!

#FAQ
---
#What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
#Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
* Spreading incorrect information,
---
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.  
---
#Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
I can see that you were shaking nice clutch btw.
---
Alright take it down now so I can abuse it
---
Nope, it still does fine at medium range. I‚Äôve actually been using it extensively the past 3 or so days and it works just fine.
---
But for defenders
---
Im surprised I'm getting upvoted, usually the people here get really defensive when you suggest such a system. I honestly think it'd do the game a lot of good. It'd stop a lot of leavers, both on casual and ranked. And if you don't want to use the system then you just leave all the maps on, so I don't really see many arguments that could be used against it tbh. I comment this suggestion about once a year and normally I get shot down by people, so I'm curious to see if the general opinion for it has changed this time.
---
Talk shit get hit üòÇ
---
Did you not look at OP‚Äôs picture? Clearly the 600 is less than the 1200.
---
It does not. It only has 8 pelleys. Still does the 3rd lowest damage per pellet, and has a very wide spread along with high recoil. That is not good at mid range.
---
Remove Goyu Shield Hitbox, Then It'll be Fixed, wait a second...
---
BS
---
Make sure you don‚Äôt need to update drivers
---
Better price for 1 credit with the bigger pack
---
Strap a laser on it and it‚Äôs still fine at medium range. You can spew your ‚Äú3rd lowest damage‚Äù shit again, and I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about damage, it‚Äôs about Dps‚Äù. I know how this shit is gonna go because we‚Äôve had this exact same argument like 6 times.

Are they making female ops hotter to sell elite skins?

It's all fun for you, but not fun for the guys who have to play a 2v5 match point.

Ela must be off to the side.

Fuck those shitters.
---
Same. Hopefully it gets fixed
---
That final sprint, shit just kept getting more dire. Spotted picking up defuser, spotted again running to obj, set off a KapTrap‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, got stuck on the door with seconds remaining, having to plant immediately after getting into obj without securing it first, and STILL clutching it.
---
Second hand sweaty palms.
---
Dude what are you looking at? For 600 it‚Äôs 17, for 1200 it‚Äôs 39.99. No better price for bigger pack.
---
It can be, but op was talking about changing the way holograms look - which would likely make Alibi too strong
---
Tbf this whole game is a buggy mess regardless of platform.
---
have you done mute already?
---
blitz has no acog tho
---
Well played. Bonus points for using a drone. I often find my teammates forgetting those pesky little moving cameras exist and just die rushing.

Idk about you but if a Jackal is blowing holes above site I shoot him...he‚Äôs really not that broken at all. If you‚Äôre telling me on a map like Clubhouse you would rather ban a Jackal over a Mav or Thatcher or Capitao, Hibana, Thermite then idk what to tell you. Sure you can ban Jackal there and hope the enemy team makes a smart ban but by leaving these other ops in play it makes taking control of every site so easy. This is why Jackal is seldom banned in pro league. If the pros don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs broken, he‚Äôs probably not and probably doesn‚Äôt really need to be touched. This game is balanced based on the pros not golds and low plat making comfort bans

Driver throttling?

Jesus god that's was good

I remember my first 1v4 clutch it felt amazing. Congrats

Cav's always been hot, would let interrogation happen.

I like to think of us as all degenerate gaymers
---
Did they add a new "wood" tier?
---
Like you didn't pre fire. Plus LNOC.
---
This game is super well made in most parts, it‚Äôs just not my type of game. I dislike this game mainly because you have to devote so much time to it memorizing maps to be competitive (I also hate the gunplay because guns IRL do not have 4 yard gaps between bullets and other things) but also my friends love this game to death and thus I play it with them and my god the maps that are in ranked are horrible imo while OG maps that made the game super fun to play in aren‚Äôt in rotation while horrible ones are still having to be played.
---
That just means if my driver's slowing down right
---
There‚Äôs no need to lie in the title. The clutch was very good though, I felt your anxiety.
---
Its not supposed to look exactly like ubi is Again Fan made

This actually could be a great operator gadget idea

I thought by now they would‚Äôve patched this already, you should look up some youtube videos that show all these cool spots in  old maps that haven‚Äôt been reworked.

Honestly depends. If my mom wants me to get groceries from the car then I‚Äôm not staying in a casual. Ranked? Different story.
---
Now if my mom needs a ride to the hospital, I‚Äôm dipping out that ranked game, sorry team. 
---
Most real life duties fall under the first category
---
Okay buddy, no one cares. To watch your post, I had to go all the way downstairs, hook up my laptop to 60" 4K TV and take magnifying glass to see what you post was about, and it wasn't even that funny. And I could do that just by pure luck of having magnifying glass. Do you know how many people don't have magnifying glass in their homes?
---
But in that way you are fully protected from defenders
---
You cant go wrong with either. Save and buy both
---
It's was during the highway star fight
---
Yeah... maybe, just maybe You have a terrible ping my dude? ) And also FPS... (((
---
a reconnect button
---
I can offer you no assurances.
---
This would work on me bruh
---
Completing a back filled game should give you a 150 renown bonus.
---
Oh yea when he got rohan
---
But which first?
---
Many people on the internet says that it takes too much space compared to how it changes the game. Is that true?
---
THANK YOU. So many people think Jackal is op when he‚Äôs not. The only reason he‚Äôs banned is because of how annoying his gadget is, but even then as an anchor main I don‚Äôt mind Jackal being played because if scans me it‚Äôs only 2 pings. So now if I go get the hatch, like I should be doing, i won‚Äôt get tracked and pinged 5 times. I feel like so many people waste bans on him when we should be banning someone else. If it‚Äôs chalet I‚Äôm gonna want thatcher banned 100%, but my teammates want Jackal banned and I have to pray to god that the enemy bans thatcher.
---
Save up and get Maveric
---
Bruh they were all in front of you

50-60%

MW2, Circa 2009, Search And Destroy in Terminal, Last alive ace... Siege is a close second though
---
please god no
---
A defender breacher huh? Interesting ngl
---
It‚Äôs discussed every week at least once and every week I have to say *no*. He‚Äôs meant to counter attacker utility, not provide his own and use it to his advantage. It muddies the line between offense and defense, it goes against his entire design, and would make him broken as fuck because offense would have no counters other than Glaz.
---
It was my buddy and he was last alive ...right before that he told us to be quiet so he could focus LOL we ribbed him pretty good after that haha
---
same
---
Yeah but Sledge can at least blind himself with his shiny head
---
Perfection
---
It‚Äôs a low file size but if you have the space there is no reason not to
---
You can also climb up to that spot from inside
---
The first part, sure, the second part, no. Seeing through smoke on the move would make him too strong as he could then use the shotgun and be a close range Glaz except offense won‚Äôt have any counters other than Glaz.
---
I really need to compile all the drone spots I know into a video, I thought they 
---
were 
---
Common knowledge but I guess not
---
Ye once my challenges glitched and i got to collect them again. Was awesome
---
Justice served
---
Operation health is basically a tree month period in which...
---
No why would I be kidding? I hope you‚Äôre kidding right? Expecting people to accept the shameless things you do. Whatever you do in private is your business but as soon as you start publicizing it, it‚Äôs free game. So don‚Äôt be shocked or surprised when someone calls out the sick shit you do.
---
Oh ok. I don‚Äôt think that the size would be that big of a problem because i have ~370gb SSD space available. I thought that it was about 33gb or am i wrong?
---
Cav is fine where she is. There‚Äôs already several counters to her such as jackal, Lion, and Dokk.
---
This game was never realistic. If it was,the vanilla op gadgets would never have existed
---
Counter Strike does the same thing for me.
---
I mean when you have 120-200 fps
---
Wow so cool
---
Right? One place Jackal really used to screw me was bank but I started doing exactly what you just said, Anchors get hatches. Then I play blue on ela with a deployable and boom. By the time Jackal can come close enough to scan me, he has to deal with 40rds coming at his head. Plus if there‚Äôs a mute Jammer on the stairs he‚Äôs double screwed cause no drone no scan. Then once jackals out I‚Äôm free to make rotates. That just an example of one map and one site, but point being if you play smart as a roamer, and you play coordinated Jackal isn‚Äôt over powered. Kinda like lesion. Yeah his gu‚Äôs are wicked annoying but unless you exclusively plan on rushing during your attacks why ban him? Pick and Ban was a great addition to the game but people absolutely waste some A-1 bans on some maps just to ban the usual suspects
---
She's not going to want your dick solely because you've showered her with compliments online lol.
---
That happens
---
I‚Äôll admit, this is so dumb nobody will expect it. Should try it
---
Your a troll account, gotcha
---
My dude just asked where the **south african** servers are located
---
i feel like its just as easy, and maybe even more so since you lower your chance of getting shot
---
Damn, that was epic
---
You make us fuze mains proud
---
Most of them from like 10 months ago. I doubt she's high on the priority list for reworks.
---
I like it I like it
---
not really imo. the only thing holding him back is that he's so incredibly niche, like hes good on certain sites but on others he's useless.
---
idk how you would solve that though.
---
Really enjoyed watching this. Nice job!
---
Oh, didnt think to search that. Thank you!

Es tut mir leid herr gestapo-offizer, I can't get in the truck with you

This spread is abysmal. I still. somehow, like playing Blitz and I cri evertiem. Look how they've massacred my boy.
---
A smart tip is always stay level with your aim to enemies heads. You can tell what stance their in by just listening to them, base on that pre-aim for their head. (It takes a lot of practice for you to instantly know wheres the head height for each stance,) I suggest practicing on T-hunt.

I was once placed into an ongoing match.

Aaaaaaand it's over.
---
Legit came in, my team was 0-2, we had 1 player left. I load in, watch him die, and then get some renown for finishing up a game. Weirdest experience I've had
---
Having the same issue here on Xbox.
---
Thank you! Any criticism to improve with? 
---
Appreciate you watching it!
---
this is why you shoul not activate windows
---
That pissed me off so much last season. Instead of say, spending 16 euros for all 4 sets, i have to spend 20 euros, and pay for them with r6 credits, where in the end i have more to spare that I don't need or can do shit with.
---
Thanks, Okay will do xD
---
Yea it got me to buy hibanas ngl
---
Ump definitely needs a buff. Slow rpm with low damage = bad gun
---
Have you not heard the tale of the 99 damage Luison?
---
I knew jt
---
True
---
Honestly the only things keeping me from PC, I hate playing Keyboard and mouse, and all my skins
---
This goes for any game. Do NOT use ideas by players.
---
Well it‚Äôs half the size of a normal one and maybe it shoots out small and expands to it‚Äôs full size
---
It was same with Ela elite skin before. Month ago I played a game and I was vs a hacker who had Ela elite skin before it was being teased. It was so weird. I got so confused.
---
My guy people will throw around death threats and racial slurs like it‚Äôs nothing. Not to take weight away from what the title is, but ‚Äúbeing reduced to nothing but your gender‚Äù is really on the lighter end of what is often said.
---
Mass is still the same, it doesn't change in any fact.
---
Idk why everyone finds this surprising they Litreally mentioned this in the trailer/guide
---
From what I saw so far I was loving it! My main concern is it almost feels like it‚Äôs been done before. Yes everything you did was funny and I love every minute of it but I feel like you need to try and really find your own unique twist to really make something incredibly special and awesome! Other than that I love what you have and want you to keep going!
---
Fantasising about the pusy power
---
Her pistol did 99 damage when she came out. Now it does 63 or something
---
cavs entire point is interrogating. like she's trash if she doesn't get one, her guns are garbage and her ability is selfish and mediocre. interrogation is the only payoff she has, and if you make it easy to null that AFTER shes already beat you in a fight, she's just gonna be a fucking recruit lmao
---
It's a game, if you could avoid Cav like that she'd be useless as her ability would mean nothing if you could just off yourself as soon as you went down
---
I think it's a good idea. Most people, even a lot of casual players favour the competitive, cut and paste blandness that the game/maps are becoming. I would like to see more things unique to maps. Waiting for the long thunder that occurs a certain time on the timer to make a silent but predictable push, it's good for strategy depth but somehow bad for competitive play.
---
"yoU wOuLd hAck jUst FoR a SkIn?"

My guy, sexual attraction has nothing to do with being in a committed relationship. You can be married for 65 years and still find someone‚Äôs physical appearance attractive. Hop down off that pitiful high horse, you‚Äôve had your moment.
---
People who play this game are assholes unfortanatly.
---
She doesn't need a nerf. She can be countered by headphones, droning and having a teammate near you. She is only really an issue for new players or low ranked players who don't work as a team well.
---
WHAT THE FUCK?
---
I‚Äôm level 102 and have probably been TK‚Äôed by ransoms between 5-10 times, so I‚Äôd not say not really an issue for me?
---
unfortniteately*
---
Pointless, although it didn't do much noticeably due to being able to spam the shots so fast it was a nerf to an already underwhelming operator
---
Doesn't make a difference. Still shreds up close.
---
For real though
---
Maybe add some fps next time
---
Nah, it has to be my gaming chair
---
More like dokkaebi + echo. U know the other edgy Asian who sits back and lets his drone to the rest
---
What happened did you lose them?
---
If I could I would all the black ice skins will be mine
---
Not seen it on my feed. 2 people can have the same idea
---
He did it on my stream and I was like wtf is going on here man
---
Or when you ping someone but they already rounded a corner and it still marks then anyways
---
copypasta
---
I know, but this is honestly harder than you think, specially in a game where your team can kill you. I, although I shouldn't, feel guilty for "ruining" the game for my friends just because someone ends up tking me. You can barely play in peace.
---
Maybe, but either way. If you buy it from steam, it'll just ask you to log into Uplay and redeem a code
---
Just like the people who took House out and put Favela in rotation.
---
Pizza rolls and gaming chair = instant win.
---
Actually, you would be surprised how many people can at least understand callouts at bronze and silver bit fun should always be the key priority.
---
You right
---
What about the same situation in ranked ?
---
Lion looks fucking adorable and terrifying at the same time
---
Either way it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Don't worry, you did what you had to do, unfortunately there are players that are probably missing half of their brain. That right there is not a true gamer, there is no respect inside him. You worked for the kill, you stalked Cav and killed her, he should be giving some thanks because he wasn't the only guy on your team who actually worked for winning the round, instead of being an asshole.
---
P. S.: Although that never happened to me, I am still mad at the situation because this shows us how some members of the community are complete idiots... Sorry for the long comment tho....
---
They should let us pick favorites so when we enter a game we can't choose operator, the game will choose from our favorite list if they're availability
---
this is an old post but i just finished a game where kali shot me (rook) and it did 40 dmg. i had plates but no other effects on me... idk wtf happened
---
Did you get karma?
---
Yes
---
What did it cost?
---
5 bucks
---
Because it's funny.
---
No one really cares in ranked as long as the player is dead and no one on your team gets traded for the enemy death.
---
Them clickity clacks tho. Gg
---
I have a better PC now :3
---
Probably never.
---
You don't sell more copies that way. 
---
Imo siege should just go F2p at this point though
---
You stole this man's ace. Happens to me sometimes, I express my frustration and don't TK saying it's alright, because I probably would've died anyway
---
Yes ive played with it i main her. And you don't want to hear it because it disproves everything you can say.
---
You also have to deny a plant.
---
Honestly should be removed. It isnt fun to be shot by someone's helmet. Its especially bad where theres small cracks between bulletproof props (that totally shouldnt be bulletproof btw).
---
That's a bruh moment
---
Oh, so Coastline? With the Pool? That one is either in Ibiza or Monaco. It came with the spanish operators.
---
Heh ‚Äúsilver platter‚Äù
---
Well why did they say that their working on it rn as we speak
---
Congrats boomer, you aced a squad of trash. What do you want? A medal?
---
you're *
---
Its a great idea(no worryes about the edit)
---
Good idea but renown farmers. All they would have to do is find an ongoing match that's 0-2, throw the game, get renown and do it all over again.
---
Good to see this game has gone full retard.
---
worth
---
Was it only obtainable through the giveaway? Or will it be publicly available at some point
---
If you get disconnected due to technical issues, there's a good chance it'll last longer than 5 minutes.
---
You were far from site. Better to take the round that risk both of you dying
---
It‚Äôs Favela, 3 of them were recruit, quick play, and they all put each other down with FF anyway. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to just nip the toxicity in the bud.
---
Congrats! You deserve this!!! The toxicity in this game against girls is the only reason I don't use my mic during matches, which sucks because this game relies soo heavily on team comm.
---
Bro shes so bad with her elite skin
---
That's an epic gamer moment right there
---
It's not like badger created the text format first.
---
I generally suck super bad at this game.  My teammate recorded and gave this to me so I thought i would share!
---
Wait, you get to play cav at all?
---
Why would you call right infront of a window?! Begging to be domed.
---
I mean, you could just wish for better aim.
---
Blackbeard buff
---
it better be a rework that we heard about 6 months ago.   
---
im sick of having amazing cosmetics on the most useless op in the game
---
Recruit w/ non base game guns
---
Yes you will
---
rekt'em
---
Lol
---
Oh stfu you absolute loser. It's is a widely known problem on Siege that the hit reg is DOG. I have the most insane clips/pics of CLEAR headshots not registering. So how about you go jump of a bridge? Cool, thanks.
---
That do be a nice view tho
---
For a new player it's helpful
---
Soon I will have the ultimate ppwer
---
I agree amazing cosmetics but not useless lol
---
I don‚Äôt think getting the most kills means you carried, the game isn‚Äôt based off of kills so you can get more kills than the entire enemy team combined and still lose, if you‚Äôre doing the most to get the bomb down or prevent it I think you‚Äôre the carrier
---
Yeah, pc
---
An actual AI gamemode. If they can pull it off in For Honor, they can pull it off here.
---
For sure!
---
Ok cool cool.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong. Idk if I made it clear but I actually enjoy it.
---
Come on 
---
Who is more useless than he is?  
---
Sure its meme material to pick him and actually get a kill or 2 with the turret.  But when was the last time you saw him get picked in ranked
---
I mean it has every single F2p bussiness model in the game already, loot packs, special currency, earned currency, rediculously priced cosmetics, paid or grinded heroes, incoming battle pass... All it needs it's a monthly aub
---
THANK U DADDY
---
One of the best guns in the game what are you on ?
---
Yes it was LMG! That‚Äôs it thank you.
---
For a good cause at least
---
nope, she reinforced the wall and then she put the mira
---
And maybe wish for anger management appointments.
---
That smile is threatening
---
Wholesome
---
Halo - siege crossover lets go
---
Good one lol
---
Are in for a tree-t *
---
Cannon lore is kind of irrelevant after the artillery patch added mortars and missiles.
---
my friend guided me in discord, and i got a kill like this.
---
Maybe its just filler until something major happens
---
I could recommend you a laptop that can run r6s with ultra settings that I personally own so when you get the money you won‚Äôt get something that doesn‚Äôt run the game. though in my opinion laptops aren‚Äôt as good as a desktop do to laptops not being upgradable but it makes up with how portable they‚Äôre , but for a great computer it would cost around $3500(with monitor and accessories included) and the laptop is about $1500. Honestly I could go on and on about computer vs laptop but it all comes down to what you want, though if you ever want to get into computer gaming message me and I will see what I can find you that will help you get started with r6s on pc.
---
Always wanted to see an op with dragon breath ammo, like a soft breacher.
---
Please post to r/3Dprinting with details. There are a lot of nice people to help you fix your printer.
---
Silly child, anything can be a jojo reference if you believe hard enough
---
You said that the bullet strikes one of the four crosshairs.That isn‚Äôt how it works.
---
Yes, I believe in you
---
Forcing people to stay in the match when theyre clearly not having fun isnt the solution though. It‚Äôd just make casual even more toxic. I don‚Äôt see leaving as a problem for casual, cause the casual playlist is just there for people to have fun. If theyre not having fun because they dont like the map for example then why shouldnt they be allowed to leave and rematch? 
---
The ranked and unranked playlists are always there for when you want a competitive match.
---
Thx and I also tried ranked
---
Recruit with attachments
---
Good job! This was great to watch. Sorry you've had to deal with the toxicity /u/metalbunnie some of the things I've heard on siege really is unacceptable and is really just pathetic. I hope you experience a lot less of it in the future and keep enjoying the game, despite these kinds of sad people. Thanks for the great clip and have a good day.

Yep I done it a few times where I run up to a barricade and just one tap someone by accdient. Always worth putting a shot out where you hear noise
---
It was still queued and my casual queue is about 5-15 minutes
---
It doesn't look like the charm tho. Doesn't make sense to have a different charm.
---
Maybe a new legendary alpha pack? idk
---
*Rappelling hostiles are IN a tree*
---
Balancing reasons, the aug is God tier compared to the 552 and pre-angled G8A1 so there has to be *some* drawback to using it. It's not a very well thought out way of balancing it but it's something
---
Okay well we‚Äôre not going anywhere with this so let‚Äôs just agree to disagree
---
Theres a possibility the plat is changing servers.
---
I believe this is what happens,
---
Player who is plat in EU servers queues up in american servers.
---
Players have a seperate MMR per server I believe. Thus he gets placed in silver and gold lobbies, when playing on american servers.
---
Some could argue this might be fair, as most people who play on different servers run 100+ ping, although when you have a master /w 100 ping in a silver lobby(happened to be a season or two ago) its a bit rough.
---
I see two problems:
---
1) connection issues causing disconnect
---
2) leaving because your team is toxic and you can‚Äôt vote kick because they‚Äôre grouped.
---
^please ubi just exclude group members from vote kicks
---
&gt;what country
---
Both are in South Africa so...
---
you understand my pain :)

As IQ, pulse players tend to think that

My man black beard flew out that door

Uh... where‚Äôs his hand? And... leg?
---
I remember For Honor (another Ubisoft game) had that in its earlier stages and it worked really well since it was easy to rq in that game. And the penalty was 10 minutes.
---
People are mad that jackal can have a good ability
---
#saveblitz

I feel bad, your existence is pain

Yep looks like a Ubisoft game

go back to the kitchen

These animations are good keep up the good work

It was probably Maestro as friendly‚Äôs (thankfully) don‚Äôt glow.
---
I love this art style, it reminds me of Castle Crashers lol. Good work!
---
It is true hell
---
Most of the siege community is full of nice people. They just never talk so we always hear the toxic trash.
---
sometimes you gotta take a life to save one
---
She shot you through wood...
---
Masculinity is a Bio-psychological thing that is inherently within the characteristics of males, the things you mentioned are social issues that are born with nurture, linking those toxic behaviours with masculinity is in itself not only toxic &amp; uneducated but disrespectfull to science and half of the population of the world.
---
&gt; Or, in this case, the idea that video games (or sports, or anything really) are masculine and if a guy loses to a girl it‚Äôs shameful.
---
All i saw in the footage is some one clutching in a casual game and laughing in chat
---
My point is you cant link those behaviours to masculinity on any way because simply thats not how masculinity works, Your society have a twisted view of what is masculinity..  so yeah, it is an issue of how people are brought up and educated because no one is naturally sexist or racist or inherently born with a will to not express his feelings.. , And the fact that your society some how linked these behaviours to masculinity is the epitome of ignorance (but we all know that who ever came up with this stupid conclusion was just trying to attack the very identity of men), Anyway you dont respond to ignorance and toxicity with more ignorance and toxicity.
---
Why don‚Äôt you just throw a drone there
---
I‚Äôm confused though, because you drop immediately after death and there is a blood splatter as well. Unless getting shot through the wood delays that, I think it was indeed the last shot.
---
He looks like russel from gorrilaz
---
You sound very fragile and incredibly pedantic. You really should have cut your losses before saying you can‚Äôt target someone with slurs/threats but for some unknown reason you can cut right to their core with an otherwise tame sexist remark (tame when compared to any of the million other things that could be said). 
---
No, I don‚Äôt think I will. Goofballs like you always come up with the clownest shit to say when you‚Äôre called out on ignorant statements.
---
Stop moaning. If you check the top posts of all time on this subreddit, plenty of them are guys doing similar things.
---
Aaaand this is why I'm paranoid to always check corners
---
Same. When I saw I got mine a few weeks ago, I was like oh shit finally
---
Hey, I just got the game and was kinda happy with this. You really aren‚Äôt humble. We all start somewhere.
---
Jackal has no viable counter and has one of the best primaries in the game and a secondary shotgun and smoke grenades. He is pretty much the strongest attacking operator in the game. It's hard to think of someone you need to ban more.
---
*nerf*
---
I hope that jager gets cancer nice job man
---
Settings?
---
Not warden
---
Change ranked map pool to be more competitive. I can only handle Chalet for so long
---
I'm sorry I'm at a lost at what ur trying to get
---
FPS strikepack helps. Don‚Äôt use the mods they are really scummy but the paddles are good.
---
Na. I have an xbox elite controller with 4 paddles on the rear. But seige on console doesn't have an option to lean without aiming down sights. It's the way it's been coded I believe. If they made a change to coding then we should be able to.
---
I guess that works too
---
Jackal is nowhere close to being the strongest attacking operator in the game. If that were the case, he‚Äôd have a 100% ban rate in PL, but guess what? He‚Äôs very rarely banned in PL. Yeah, his guns are good, he has the shotgun and smokes but so does Gridlock and she‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe strongest attacking operator in the game‚Äù.
---
Fix being tested on TS right now.
---
Completly agree with u the ban mechanic is useless right now
---
$30 I think it said at the end of the video they put out
---
Pretty sure the 552 wins at fire rate and that‚Äôs usually what makes weapons best in siege. On average
---
Did you fail geography class or something . South Africa is a country ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I meannnn are you dying early or just forgetting about them?
---
Mozzie easily. 2 very good primaries that are easy to use, a secondary shotgun for utility, C4, and a good gadget. It‚Äôs good enough for drone denial, but once you learn callouts and good drone spots he‚Äôs a monster.
---
I doubt they'd add new functionality unless there's a way to make it work on the base controllers.
---
Mega dedication. 1 upvote my good sir!
---
LMTREE. MOUNTED. LOADED.
---
I‚Äôm over level 200 and I only have it for the smg 11, ump, bucks dmr, and docs shotgun
---
That's a lot for just two buttons :/
---
I usually rush with my friends, and it works like 70% of the time so we have quick matches and I'm thinking you use it for the initial push, and when time is running down on the defuse timer
---
The last time it worked consistently was is operation chimera.
---
Met of zonder schijt probleem?
---
Thank the lord
---
I‚Äôve had it before at the start of the season where it was like silver 2-3 and we got matched against a plat for some reason. After mmr lock too so there shouldn‚Äôt have been any way for a plat to get down there.
---
This is great
---
Inuyashiki vibes
---
Nah I'm pretty sure the RDS just sits straight on the rail. There's no stick thing to raise it.
---
I hear C4 is the one you gotta look out for.
---
MP5K with Iron Sight Gang?
---
Read the first comment of this chain then look at the post. I‚Äôm poking fun at them.
---
You can watch it in the menu
---
Gridlock on attack for sure. Based off your fav ops, you seem like a support player, and gridlock is one of if not the best supporting attacker. Great guns, secondary shotgun for utility, smokes for planting and spikes for covering your flank and covering the defuser.

For defense, Wamai is my pick. Warden is pretty bad right now, so I‚Äôd take a hard pass on him, and Goyo is difficult to play and can be more harmful to your team if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. Wamai is a lot like J√§ger but more creative. Instead of outright deleting the projectiles, Wamai relocates them and forces the enemy to disposition themselves. He‚Äôs very good, and slightly unrelated, I‚Äôm excited to see how he‚Äôs played in PL.

Yea ok but it be cool
---
An embarrassingly simple issue, that Valve solved years (if not decades) ago.
---
Not a full team before the start of the first round?   Dismiss the match. Like, c'mon, how's this not a thing yet?
---
I like it it was pretty funny I subbed and I enjoyed it
---
I don't really use it during plants (and kind of pref that people didn't depending on circumstance) because of the audio flooding. it makes it hard to hear the close stuff like footsteps and whatnot. 
---
When I run her I mostly just (even if just rushing) use them for a push or if I'm not near a gunfight I hear a friendly having. usually the heal can clutch it out for them and let them live for an extra bullet during it. 
---
It's like with flashbangs and stuff. If it might be needed most of the time it's better to use it without hesitation because you might regret not using it later. Sure you can say you might want one later, but the ole phrase better safe than sorry comes to mind.

H-How do you lose to a g-g,ghost?
---
Hacks confirmed
---
It‚Äôs okay... check Hibana or Glaz pl sets for example
---
Very unfortunate timing
---
Rly nice spot
---
You killed him with your bad vibes

i played from op health until grim sky pretty much daily with my friends. after the recoil change we only got on the game to get our platinum, dont even care about diamond anymore and. we stopped playing the game once a season entirely after phantom sight. we miss this game tbh but  we cant get ourselfs to play with this recoil
---
Every seasonal skin is only available for the weapons in the game at the time of the season.
---
Imagine not using the m870 you have disapppinted recruits everywhere.
---
Yea, I'd like Para Bellum back
---
How
---
*Laughs in Battlefield 5 fan*
---
I thought the points for spotting the objective were shared now?
---
Daaaamnn boyyyy he **THICC**
---
‚ÄúWhy is it a competition‚Äù *immediately makes it a competition of frequency*
---
They didn‚Äôt bow down to Tachanka
---
oh, have they said they're going to be doing a battlepass? I missed that if so
---
I‚Äôve found a quick fix for it is switching to another drone then switching back right away. I agree though, it‚Äôs a fucking pain.

Hello nosamason7, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ec3wfw/kali_collat_to_win_the_round/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

N√∏kk/N√∏kke means water spirit.
---
Hit Q then E or RB/R1 then LB/L1 for console and usually it will spot the bomb then
---
Nah, its 50 per bomb to whomever found it.
---
It looks like kingsman from spider man, and it is amazing
---
Why does it do that tho smh
---
Can i have a server in Puerto Rico so I can finally play in ‚Äúmy own server‚Äù like everyone tells me to?
---
ah okay ty
---
Yes, nokk could be better and that would be a nice Touch as nokk is Made to go alone. Shes so much fun but a buff or weaponchange would be nice
---
Not here it isn‚Äôt and again, what freaking society are you living in? Because the human race is still pretty universally shitty when it comes to sexism and the like. Also the dictionary definition says literally nothing about biology so stop arguing semantics. Masculine is not objective. Maybe it has a specific definition within the field of bio-psychology, but that is not by any means the most common definition. 
---
Also behavioral neuroscience has precious little to say about the behavior of humans considering that the subjects of their studies are primarily mice and other animals. Because you can‚Äôt go futzing around in someone‚Äôs brain. So they‚Äôre going specifically for broad topics and basic behavioral patterns shared across many species of animal. Do I really have to explain why that isn‚Äôt incredibly applicable to any of this?
---
Also there‚Äôs literally never been a time when these issues didn‚Äôt exist in some form or another. So I guess we‚Äôve been failing since the day we started then. I‚Äôm assuming you also don‚Äôt believe that gender is separate from biological sex? Because with your line of thinking there‚Äôs no other option.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a huge problem before so they didn‚Äôt spend 5 years working on it. It should be fixed for Y5S1
---
Not even the recruits may use the new skin... it‚Äôs waisted paint
---
üëç
---
Ok first of all whicg recruit are you gonna be cuz green recruit is trash
---
:y  The title's supposed to be a reference to a twitch headshot, or a flick, but also casts light on the 417 being shared between Lion and Twitch.  
---
I'm not clever and there was no reason to cause this confusion.  I don't even think this is considered wordplay.
---
i put an ungodly amount of hours back in blood orchid...

Happy he got his elo back but sad it one point off plat?
---
Same with Para Bellum
---
I was just making a joke, mate. I'm not that thick.
---
That gadget name kinda doo doo
---
It is better with the current round rotation system especially for ranked, it allows for more consistency and strategic play. Whereas in casual it adds the same things if you want, but if you don't want more consistent and strategic play in casual then the rotation makes no difference as you have the same number of attacking and defense rounds.

Only Bad Thing about Fortress are all those Long halleways, Else i Love the structure and the feel of this map
---
Nah, you just seem to think women believe racism is less bad than sexism while it has nothing to do with that. It has *everything* to do with frequency. I know for a fact I'd get harassed less if I didn't have a female voice - better yet, if I don't use my mic nobody says shit to me at all. Interesting how that works huh.
---
Im in Puerto Rico, lowest i have ever got is in the 60‚Äôs. Yet people tell me ‚Äúplay in your own servers‚Äù
---
That happens to me too. I believe it's beginers luck or you don't know the exact capabilities yet so you don't know what your supposed to do.

Yet sometimes I‚Äôll smash my drone into the bomb and it won‚Äôt be found lol. Then someone else will roll in and find it right at the doorway

I mean take what you can get?
---
Same. Every time I bought a Y1 op I got an ace immediately afterwards, not with any other ops though idk why
---
Yeah 100% sure
---
Yeah but at least you could go take a dump.
---
this is a quite an old clip but i will admit that precision is fucking crazy
---
cool bots
---
This is in fact real

I know right it‚Äôs so bullshit

Only true legends reach the rank of copper 5

This could help. If there was a backfill bonus of some kind then a button like this would have some use.
