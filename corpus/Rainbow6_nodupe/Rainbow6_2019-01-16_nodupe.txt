2 shots at even mid range because the damage stays above 50.

---
Guys, a total fucking idiot who can't do basic math here. Real smartass you are /s
---
---
---
Nothing at all has been confirmed.  
---
Yes but you if you want to argue a point, you can not move the goalpost to, say "moving into a neighborhood".
---
&gt;You lost
---
You saying that doesn‚Äôt mean I did
---
im fine with everything here except the mag cap, that is fucking stupid. If i can only pull a flank reliably on one person, that is a really bad change, and makes cav hyper situational which i think will lead to everyone just picking other ops. Nomad is bad enough, I think they need to leave roamers alone until they figure out whether or not they want attackers to totally fuck them without having to put in any effort ie lion, dok, nomad. 
---
100% I agree and I'm not a main or a hater of Cav
---
I tried editing my post, maybe it helps.
---
No, it‚Äôs fine, they already fucked her up the ass in Grim Sky.
---
They‚Äôll usually fire about 2-3 bursts before reloading. The shotguns are kind of hard to deal with because they can cancel the reload and shoot instantly after they have one shell in. 
---
I knew he was going to disconnect! Freaking called it 
---
I just think that ubi is nerfing people that shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed (such as iq) instead of buffing the underwhelming ops 
---
Using real life examples to dictate game balance is never a good idea. 9mm vs. .308 is irrelevant in a video game where you need balance. Dokkaebi has a much better primary than what Cav has available. 
---
Cav's pistol damage is a unique operator function just like gadgets on other operators -- and was compensated through other balance tweaks such as massive drop-off damage. The 99 dmg only applies when you are very close, any further and it drops off significantly.
---
Also hard to call something "horrifically" broken when we're talking about an op that is almost never used/seen in higher rank gameplay.
---
&gt;  and the only ones who don't admit it are cav mains. 
---
This sounds more like salt -- and I'm a Hibana main.

Instead of telling him how to do better and be an actual decent human being, u just kill a teammate? Ruin the game everyone and especially him? Make a 4 v 5 out of of the blue and it will probably drag through the whole match, because he wants to kill you, kick you or you kill him again next round? I talked to idiots like you again and again and you guys are just as much toxis as ignorant. Take the tip with for condom for real, would ya?
---
why do you keep responding lmao
---
you're so mad

The thing we‚Äôre struggling with is the enemy‚Äôs coming from behind
---
Because Blitz is a fair and balanced operator.
---
Im not
---
I'm about 95% sure they aren't updating her in game model just the splash art
---
Yup, Ubi's anti-cheat is really bad. It can't even spot people teleporting, which is insane. idk why this post is getting downvoted but whatevs :)
---
I don't feel comfortable any more...
---
Let me have my 2d anime chicks.
---
That's... true

I think it is real because i saw a tweet somewhere about the cav nerf. Not sure thou.
---
Yeah and it especially tends to happen when people are walling. They know where you're aiming.
---
&gt;2 shots even at mid range because the damage stays above 50
---
But that‚Äôs not the point.  That‚Äôs what her SMG is for.  Her Lusion is for extreme CQB.  If they wanted her to be good at range, they could‚Äôve buffed her SMG, or just left her the fuck alone like they should have
---
Tell teammates (if you have any to cover flanks)
---
It is legit.  Didn‚Äôt you see the front page?

&gt;in what universe is a suppressed 9mm handgun supposed to deal more damage than a .308 battle rifle?

Buy Cap. If used right he's one of the best Ops to use in a squad. A lot of easy kills to be had with his firebolts through drone holes and murder holes
---
I think the Damage nerf was acceptable,but increased recoil and reduced mag size was way to much.Moreover cav is super easy to counter with good communication and drone play!
---
Well cav is now fucking useless. Yeet.

This is pretty dumb, her schtick is that she was high risk, high reward. For her Luison to do 99 you had to be 2-5 feet next to the enemy with a secondary, then the damage drop off makes it pretty crappy. You are restricted from using her main ability while using primaries which are both some of the worst in their categories, her smg boasting low damage, low rpm and her shotgun having very low damage. Now she's completely underpowered on all fronts, thanks Ubi.

---
Lmao they should just replace his VSN with a PPSH-41 and that should be his gadget, or maybe incendiary rounds for the SAIGA?
---
i bet you made that
---
While I am ok with most of these changes, I want to address the "bubble" only Fabian lives in. A decent portion of the playerbase DOES play 5 man only. Even more will 3 to 4 stack as well. Even still, the game design generally assumes communication will happen.

&gt; Balance&gt;Realism

Please tell me what balance is it where a fucking suppressed pistol kills me from 2 shots on target when I land 2-3 shots on target with a DMR or an Assault Rifle? I understand balance over realism, but this is just fucking pathetic.
---
Not every game has to appeal to every player; that's a great way to make a really boring game. One of the signature points about Siege is how high the learning curve is and that's fine. Also one of the reasons I play Siege is because it's not CS so to me saying that CS does something is a good reason not to here. If people like that style of game they're welcome to it, and I'm not trying to sound hostile; but I like a different type of game and I think it's fine for different games to do things differently. 
---
Think the one he's talking about is called Ready Or Not

What‚Äôs this supposed to mean? I‚Äôm level 191 and I own 2 black ice. They‚Äôre quite rare

i didnt someone else did but i cropped his name out i dont want to dox anyone

Caveira doesn't work well against a barely organized team. Let alone one that communicates.

i think so too, when i started the game this year i didnt know agents tools, so i though fuze bomblets were home seeking cos they always got me when i was running away from them.

Cav nerf?
---
What if they remove his L85 to balance it out? Idk I love playing thatcher and I think it would make him more fun
---
My only concern was the recoil on console. How is it?
---
No, but Ubisoft nerfing her does üòÇ
---
Sorry king
---
Epic.
---
So are we just supposed to drone the entire map until we find cav? Then what we find her and then she relocates too a different part of the map. That‚Äôs just a waste of time. Also even when she‚Äôs not 2 meters away she still does a shit ton of damage. 
---
You should be sad little burrito
---
Not in t hunt 
---
You don‚Äôt see me complaining about Docs 3 dmg nerf when that was unnecessary in my opinion. That‚Äôs how things work when you grow up. Radical acceptance of things you can not control.

Her portrait looks rougher than the model. As far as real life LEOs, I've seen exactly one woman officer who didn't look like a man with makeup on.
---
Smurf TV? Why's it so gotdamn blue

&gt; she does is prolly mad they can't use her or is shit at fighting against her lol
---
Shit argument. Play on PS4 and then we'll see if you still think the same.
---
About time! Crazy how people think she‚Äôs not OP. Her pistol is like a Fucking sniper. People just like playing OP characters, so almost no one complains.
---

---
I think the lack of a map in rainbow is one of its biggest charms. It encourages you to learn the maps yourself. Knowing the position of your friends is vital, but having to relay that information to each other is just a part of rainbow, and without it, the team aspect of the game would not be anywhere near as good. 
---
DONT FOODSHAME ME ;-;
---
Just depends on what you're into.
---
this, her pistol is retarded op
---
Remove the starter edition from your account on Steam and then buy the standard edition.
---
No, plenty of games have scoped revolvers
---
So are you saying that you in fact die every time you‚Äôre in a 1v2 situation, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not possible unless you‚Äôre absolutely trash at the game?
---
Oh yea shove your Latino latex glove up my pooper
---
Best girl
---
If you think that‚Äôs unnecessary have you seen the mp5 nerf you know one of the most balanced weapons in the game being nerfed just because they don‚Äôt want to buff the p90 
---
True but don‚Äôt you find it weird how it was added a few weeks after the 44 mag was added?
---
I completely disagree. I‚Äôm level 250 in Plat/Diamond tank and think she needed this nerf, and plenty of the people I play with share this opinion. 99 damage on a pistol with almost no recoil that is incredibly easy to spam fire and melt people with. Combine that with her silent step and you have an extremely annoying op to play against.
---
I‚Äôm glad they aren‚Äôt just nerfing her though. The change to the damage drop off should make her pistol more consistent, without it being broken
---
Someday I‚Äôm gonna teamkill you and enjoy it 
---
If you want I can dm you a clean clip. I honestly have no faith in Ubisoft doing anything to these cunts.

I also understand your side of it. I‚Äôm not toxic when I play on my smurf and will help people if they ask (I don‚Äôt go around bragging I‚Äôm a DiAmOnD oN mY mAiN). I‚Äôve also will sometimes get people from the enemy team message me asking for tips and, if they‚Äôre down, I‚Äôll play with them and just give them pointers. I really like this community and I don‚Äôt try to be an asshole when I‚Äôm on my smurf. It would be so cool for someone better than me to give me tips and stuff and I hope that I‚Äôm doing that for them!!!
---
She can't do a 1tap to the body. The lusion does 99 DMG to 1 armors.
---
Isn‚Äôt the damage fall off a buff? I thought cav had some of the worst damage drop off in the game.
---
If you keep losing because of "bad teammates", you might be the problem too.
---
Can confirm, the spammability of Cavs pistol is the worst, especially in upper level play where people generally have better aim.
---
damage drop off started at 2m i think

---
Morals? Haha. Sheesh. 
---
Obviously we have very different outlooks on what fairness is. I think your assertion that I'm stupid over a different opinion on paid cosmetics says a lot about you. It's really not that hard. We paid for a game, we get to play the game for free, forever, with the same operators, gadgets, weapons and maps that every other player will ever have access to. Compared to most other AAA games loaded with paid DLC  content that splits the player base, this is a freaking miracle. I didn't pay $60 for unlimited eternal access to new skins. If that's what you expected out of this game, I'm very sorry your expectations weren't met. Wahh wahh wahhh stoopiiiid.
---
Lol I was playing with her primary shotgun, which is why I had a pistol... I realize now how misleading that title is
---
You‚Äôre just fine, she‚Äôs honestly barely gonna be effected.  She hasn‚Äôt been super potent in higher ranks for a while now, but she can still do really well in medium or lower ranks.
---
&gt;Caveira's ability is her silent step, not her pistol. Instead, her pistol has 99 damage despite it having an INBUILT suppressor [lol why can't Echo get that then]. I've seen her outgun people with ARs. I have been outgunned against her even though her pistol is supposed to have a crazy damage drop-off, which I found to be inconsistent.
---
Cav's pistol is supposed to be a compliment to her silent step and interogation abilities, especially since she can only use her pistol when she is silent stepping. The 99 damage was 1. Only 99 damage on 1 speed operators and 2. Has the most severe drop off in the game. It also has a suppressor since her entire setup is about stealth. Your point about her drop off being inconsistent is just wrong. Unless you land you land a headshot, the gun is useless at long range, and if you're getting outgunned when you have an AR on attack you either are inaccurate or got fucked at close range where Cav is supposed to shine and attackers are supposed to have the disadvantage. Either way, that's all on you. 
---
&gt;As her pistol is ridiculous, people started using her pistol as a crutch. They used her to take on players, sometimes 2 at a time, head on, and win because she just needs to 2 tap one guy, then wait and 2 tap the next guy while he turns in response.
---
Once again, wrong. Cav has one of the highest skill ceilings in the game due to the fact that for her to work, you have to have map knowledge, an ability to capitalize on out of position opponents and the ability to quickly close the distance to use her ability effectively. There is a reason why the higher up in skill you go, the less Cav mains you see. To maximize her to her full potential is exceedingly difficult. Also "They used her to take on players, sometimes 2 at a time, head on, and win because she just needs to 2 tap one guy, then wait and 2 tap the next guy while he turns in response."? Have you ever considered that those 2 people just suck? There is no reason a Cav should take down 2 people that quickly. Either they were not watching flanks or the missed their shots. Once again, that's on you.
---
&gt;The whole point of Caveira is that a smart player uses her and uses smart stealth to pop up in unexpected areas and damage the enemy team. She was definitely not being used like that in majority of games on console.
---
Wrong again. The point of Cav was to punish careless attackers who didn't know how to drone or watch flanks. Oh and also, anecdotal evidence is anecdotal. I play on PS4 and don't see Cav very often.
---
&gt;Another thing. Fabian is criticizing these changes, but he plays and lives in a bubble. Nobody plays with a 5 stack 24/7. Nobody plays like pro players. They play a different game, honestly.
---
Yes. Yes they do. In fact they play the game at the absolute highest level and maximize the potential of every operator they use which is why the game is balanced (as it should be) around high level/pro league play. The game is designed as a team-based tactical shooter and solo players (like myself) need to understand that we don't get to complain when we sign up for a game where teammates and communication are crucial. 
---
&gt;He wants people to drone for Caveira, then hold long angles and take her down? How much time in the round are we supposed to waste for that? In Ranked, we have 2 minutes, and in Casual we have 4 iirc. So are we supposed to waste 1 min 30 seconds to drone and then pin Caveira through long angles? What if she just sits in a spot which can't be seen through a long angle, and just chills there? Are we supposed to let the time expire?
---
Huh? We have 3 minutes in ranked which is plenty of time to isolate roamers and either deal with them or push the objective and hold those long angles Fabian was talking about that roamers have to come back through and mow them down with ease. It takes at most 45 seconds for two drones to clear most if not all of a map and decide what to do from there. If Cav is chillin somewhere... leave her. She has to come back to site at some point to defend a plant or the secured area so let her come, and there will be a few bullets there to greet her, it really isn't too complicated.
---
&gt;Pro players play the game in a way, but it's a bubble. The game is played very differently outside of this bubble. So Fabian needs to understand that, as do other pro players.
---
You need too understand that these are the people who play the game the most and the best out of everyone on the planet and they know what is best int terms of balance. Yes they play in a high level bubble, and that's why they help decide what happens to the operators. You and I play in a bubble where those same operators are used poorly or just not to the maximum potential. The game is supposed to cater to the most competitive tier of player, not people who refuse to use the mechanics the game gives you (you know like droning for roamers or using operators that are designed to hunt them down) and then complain about how they lost.
---
&gt; Caveira wasn't played against wrong. She was designed poorly in the first place. And now Ubisoft has figured out that her pistol is supposed to be just that: a suppressed pistol. So, they reduced the damage and increased its recoil to make it harder to use her, hence if you want to get shots on target you have to be smart and flank/surprise the enemy, instead of take 'em head on.
---
No good Cav tried to take anyone head on, and if she did successfully her opponents misplayed and deserved to die.
---
&gt;In all honesty, even 65 dmg per shot is too high, but it's a step in the right direction, and for that, I say to Ubisoft: well done. Keep making more balancing changes.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHA
---
TL;DR: You're just wrong.
---
you‚Äôre 100% right. the scoped revolver has never been used in real life or a video game until siege did it. Kaid and Nomads pistol isn‚Äôt even a revolver 
---
How do you suggest a game detect the difference between random disconnect vs the player pulling out the ethernet cable from the pc/console.  
---
Or he has mnk
---
F
---
Just because PS4 players don‚Äôt spend their lives playing siege doesn‚Äôt mean their achievements don‚Äôt mean shit, nothing wrong with being happy with yourself but there is with tryna shit on others .  
---
You‚Äôre overreacting. With the higher range, it‚Äôll take fewer shots overall. Instead of 6-8 shots at range, Cav will probably be able to down in 4-5. Maybe give the Dev team a chance and wait to play it yourself before crying over reddit.
---
Literally no one asked for this lol. Weak operator gets a nerf, seems legit.

Fun to play against is misleading, what people really mean is "still able to experience anything but pure frustration while in the same game as her"
---
A lot of the time when ur holding the angle u have the disadvantage cause they‚Äôll just quick peek u.. very tactical gameplay /s

R.I.P Cav Mains
---
I think they watch your videos Noob
---
Yeah I‚Äôll make sure to when I get back from my holiday
---
You use the MP5 to get headshots.
---
Also, Rook needs a nerf.
---
unless shes absolute trash, or really popular, her win delta should be high by design of her ability. as long as you dont die early on, you either (A) do the job of a normal roamer who just wastes the enemy teams time and/or (B) get not only a kill like a normal roamer, but highlight their team for your team to get some more extra kills with
---
so because people at higher ranks know not to just die early or take stupid fights, she will always be better
---
if they really wanted to do something, the change shouldve been to her ability and not her guns. double the interrogation time, or half the time that the enemy team is detected, or something like that
---
but they went a dumb route imo 
---
I‚Äôm just gonna say this before it turns into who‚Äôs ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù and which console is less trash. The fact you can‚Äôt be happy for a lad shows the thing that‚Äôs wrong with the community =)
---
A friend and I used to call her "potato head".
---
&gt; Wanna just shoot without thinking, paying attention or communicating? Go play CS.
---
When did I even suggest anything like that?  I love siege exactly how it is.
---
Every fucking time.
---
Club house bedroom before the rework just had a wall that could easily be breached. Where it connects to cash room now. Obviously the issue is not there anymore.
---
It was similar to the outside window of Oregon.
---
Not sure if you played before the club house rework
---
Noob's right, The Devs pay way too much attention to Youtube and the communities opinion on "OP Operators" when that's what makes them unique, like how they wanted
---
while i agree proleague balancing is probably the most important, what you said isnt true. lion is a great example - totally OP in pro league, and even in gold ranks he's pretty shit. a lot of times you'll see people at that rank fire one scan off right at the start (????)
---
really? because my shields seems to be paper, when and if i use him hes just a guy with a gun because his shields are ass
---
There's DPS and then TTK to consider. DPS against 1 armours at ranges &lt;18m remain unchanged. Against 2 armours the TTK is one of the worst among SMG's. 
---
Now, that being said, I personally don't agree with the MP5 nerf nor do I believe Cav needed to have the mag size in her pistol reduced. I'm quite concerned with how many defenders are getting nerfed. I believe in buffing other weapons instead of nerfing every good weapon. I wonder how long until Bandit and Jager get nerfed. 
---
Oh thank god. I play Monty a lot and she hit my hand like 2 damn times and I die. 
---
Looks like Amy Poehler 
---
Hope so. 
---
I want to hunt down cavs in style.
---
Except that it doesn‚Äôt hit like a nerf gun in all ranges. Even at mid range her pistol still hits like a fucking truck. And what are you five? ‚ÄúAre you stupid or stupid?‚Äù I haven‚Äôt insulted you at all. I‚Äôm trying to have a friendly conversation. 
---
That Cav is trash
---
what‚Äôs this song tho 
---
Ok correction . What i meant is i survive and keep playing cuz i love the game. Now feel better?
---
I didn't want to 
---
My experience was like the glitch on the killcams. From my point of view he switched stances instantly. I was kinda just sat there thinking about what happened and my friend confirmed my suspicion because they did the same exact thing to him. 
---
So good Cavs will still be good Cavs.  Shit Cavs will be worse.

Cav‚Äôs drop off range (how fast her damage decreases over distance) was horrible before.  Now her damage drop off on her pistol has been buffed to be more in line with the rest of the pistols in the game.

Here lies the Cav. She ran fast and died a virgin
---
why should no secondary weapon do more damage than a DMR? mira and jackal have secondaries that do, smoke/mute/sledge have guns that basically have the highest dps in the game
---
I'm not saying that you suggested that, what I'm saying is that ppl have grow up on Siege, have to adapt. If they can't learn how to play R6S, they shouldn't play it. I'm talking about low tiers, like myself, not you. Got it?
---
The "Other Issues section" is so true.
---
I also switched from ps4 to PC recently.
---
The fuck is this edit 
---
I want her to strangle me to death with her biceps. 
---
any gun can be used to get headshots though 
---
Uh nooooo
---
For those Tachanka and Alibi mains.
---
Never seen it happen before but recently in the past month or 2 it‚Äôs happened around 4 times to me.
---
Nah I came off wrong, just trying to provide some honest info :).
---
Ty
---
Did you just say that Jackal of all people needs a nerf and that glaz is perfectly fine?
---
I just want a recruit elite but that aint happening
---
She's just too beautiful to translate her face into an in-game model.
---
That‚Äôd be great ngl
---
It's gotten to the point where I binded ctrl to one of my side mouse buttons.
---
The "toxicity" I've experienced is easy to ignore or just find a new match. I'm a girl and went from no shooters or multiplayers most my life to R6 and while it was rough getting use to, I've been welcomed and even made friends. I play on Xbox One and my isses lie with the bugs and glitches. Toxicity sucks but its really easy to ignore and jump in a new game, bugs aren't so easy to ignore. Most toxic I've delt with was tking and shit talking, none of it was because of my gender. It's just a game and getting upset over asshats is a waste of time.
---
Justice was served
---
Yea ok well go with that
---
This is going to be an unpopular opinion on here but, In general the vast majority of players play no where near top level play. There are tactics and operators that aren‚Äôt viable in pro league but are cheesy and annoying to deal with for lower level players. If you just ignore trying to balance anything that doesn‚Äôt affect the top tier players then the game will be less satisfying to play at lower levels of competition and it will start losing significant chunks of its user base. The obvious response is that those people should just ‚Äúget gud‚Äù but the reality of it is most of them will just get frustrated and leave which isn‚Äôt good for the health of the game. 
---
I'm not sure how its going to pan out (if the nerf even makes it to the live build) but I know I won't get outgunned by her. Outsmarted yes, outgunned, no.

How many team kills followed next round?

Not a super long time ago. I'm level 100 but I'm not super good. I'm a high Silver player, nothing special.
---
It‚Äôs fan made, noted put it on his YouTube page 
---
FINALLY THANK YOU UBISOFT FOR LISTEN TO ME
---
meow meow motherfucker
---
you gotta be real with me here though, a silenced pistol shouldnt two tap me 30m away. 
---
1. the silencer is supposed to decrease damage 
---
2. why the fuck does a pistol have more range than ela's smg?
---
3. cav is supposed to be a sneaky close range "im right behind you" kind of op, not a "haha get fukt kid spawn peek with pistol"
---
Now i curious do tks increase my kd? Someone needs to test this, for science of course. 
---
Stop existing
---
I've just started using Frost as my main recently and the Kapkan trap cost me mine, my fault as I should have checked the doors.
---
How far away could I place my trap where it wouldn't be affected?
---
Sorry if it's a daft question, still getting used to the game but have no idea on the range of the traps.
---
Damn who didn't recommend?
---
This is all good news doc and rook with acog IMO is frustrating to play against only because they are always picked and always spawn peek, so good job UBI, way to notice rooks win rate and do something about it.
---
I think that casual should emulate ranked in some way. Apply the same punishments in casual as they are in ranked. Shorten the round timer and allow spawn selection but keep the games first to 3 rounds won. There would still be toxicity but maybe with some repercussions like a 10 minute ban it might be closer to a ranked experience without the pressure to win 100% of the time. I don't play casual but I would like to experience the older, non-competitive maps, once in a while. 
---
The defenders have really been getting nerfed to oblivion recently. This is ignoring that the sight misalignment fix/new recoil made guns like the R4 a laser beam to use. Defense feels lacking.
---
Why?
---
nope. he's one of the most balanced operators in the game right now.
---
This analogy is everything
---
Friend : Wanna be raid?
---
Me : Yemen
---
Good play, but that commentator was annoyingly loud.
---
Fair enough but why would you need to get to close range when you have an assualt rifle or SMG, or any weapon that isn't a shotgun or pistol. even then caviera isn't 100% silent, you can still hear her.
---
Wait no you've got to be kidding me
---
Then you‚Äôre playing the game wrong 
---
There are over 200-250 people working on siege as of a year ago, you must be literally retarded
---
They nerfed her because yeah she may be bad but she was also too luck based. This game needs more skill elements, this is a step in the right direction
---
&gt;a silenced pistol shoudlnt two tap me 30m away 1. the silencer is supposed to decrease damage 2. why the fuck does the pistol have more range than ela‚Äôs smg 3. cav is supposed to be a sneaky close range ‚Äúim right behind you‚Äù kind of op, not a ‚Äúhaha get fukt spawn peek with pistol‚Äù
---
1. Balance&gt;Realism
---
2. Because Ubi overnerfed her Scorpion
---
3. She *is*.  Her pistol had the most harsh damage drop off in the game.  The 99 damage was only two meters.  It dropped 20 damage every meter after that.
---
Try hitting r1 then ads
---
i'm starting at my high school right now. i'm putting the rainbow six logo instead so that if i get caught i'm not expelled.
---
Yeah that's true! You cant read peoples tone or expressions through text so things get misinterpreted sometimes. :P I'm glad you know now that I was trying to be nice and contribute to your comment and not trying to be annoying. n_n  it was an attempt to be moderately humorous but did not work out lol :P 
---
So you can actually aim
---
The funny thing is that you dont actually need to any of that. If you play roamer enough you know that all you have to do is aim behind where your team is pushing while attacking and every game youll net yourself at least one free kill
---
Awesome thanks, won't be trying that again then lol! :-p
---
lol "rarely"?? Really?? He's only 10% under the ideal pick rate.
---
But her pistol is her gadget, and the 99 damage is only at two meters, it drops by 20 every meter after that
---
Yeah but you gotta be quick in order to leave before the interrogation starts. Many times I‚Äôve been spawn killed by some roamer jumping out the window. If her guns did anymore damage, you would down them anyway 
---
It just means you gotta git gud. 
---
‚ÄúCarbine‚Äù but anyway, he doesn‚Äôt have the ability to luck himself into winning gunfights like cav‚Äôs pistol allows you to do
---
NOOOO
---
doesn't matter, combined with recoil nerf it will be nerf to both close range and long range overall.
---
You don‚Äôt scream that you scream ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkkk no no noooooo with the mic inside your mouth
---
*Fapping noises*
---
Im loving it so far, rank is hella easy because Christmas noobs, hit plat my first try. New ops are pretty well balanced and i like the new map. Game is growing as you can tell by the size of subreddit so I think most people agree. Every game is buggy, after 3 years this game is less buggy than most not as bug free as some. 
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
They are fu*king the game more and more from the last 2 ops 
---
&gt; If she's useless she wouldn't have such a high pick rate
---
She's *fun* to play. Not everyone picks operators to be optimal meta tier whores.
---
Wish I could gild you
---
i guess you have a point, i guess im just rejoicing for all the poor buck mains out there
---
Very unpopular opinion but I miss Tower, it was big and frustrating af at times but it grew on me. Looking back it was also pretty balanced for attacking a defending  a lot of the time, looking at some of the maps in casual I think they're there because of how it's a lot easier to defend or attack depending on the map. Whereas tower didn't seem to have this problem. 
---
Lots of people want maps removed from ranked because they can't be bothered to learn it or adapt to it but I think if they did they would enjoy the game a lot more. Removing maps especially when you only play ranked would make it very stale and boring after a while. Just my thoughts though 
---
I don't think so. I remember its called ADS and/or Magpie.
---
I have it at 700 right now and I believe 15 and 15 which feels okay.
---
Oh my gosh, good thing I never saw that.
---
I've seen his pick rate. Only ~7% under the ideal pick rate. That's more than enough data.
---
J√§gers gadget i known has the ads so its possible theres a new secondary gadget that hasn't been released yet or something.
---
The Lesion one looks really good man!
---
Yeah im liking the hidden range buff
---
I‚Äôve done it now, thank you though
---
One time on Border I fuzed from the second floor, one puck went straight into a drone vent between 1st and 2nd floor, so the puck slowly arrived back near me at the 2nd floor.
---
I was playing some custom matches with friends and we had the brightness turned all the way down at night time, it was so fun I hope your idea gains traction. 
---
&gt;im just rejoicing for all the poor buck mains out there
---
True, but what about all the poor Cav mains?  She‚Äôll be next to useless after this nerf.
---
Don‚Äôt forget, even though they decreased her damage drop off, that‚Äôs *still* a 4-5 shot kill, which is around the same as Ela‚Äôs 5 shot kill Scorpion, on top of her weak primaries, and on top of her ‚Äúmeh‚Äù ability.  Silent Step doesn‚Äôt last long and you can hear Cav when she‚Äôs using it if your headset volume is high enough, and it doesn‚Äôt even have to be that high to hear it
---
&gt; Fair enough but why would you need to get to close range when you have an assualt rifle or SMG
---
You litearlly explained why Cav needs to get in short range in your original post, what even??? I'm just pointing out it's easy as fuck to get into butthole sniffing territory with Cav without the enemy noticing.
---
&gt;even then caviera isn't 100% silent, you can still hear her\**
---
\**if you are standing still, there is no ambient noise, no gunfights taking place anywhere on the map, and you have your volume cranked up to 500%
---
Thats what me and my friends say, and if we‚Äôre mad we say goobee shit
---
That‚Äôs epic
---
i do but in my friend group, siege has fallen off ( for now, bc it always does and then we get back into it) and most dont get on and i dont use my mic when i get on by myself, its really a lot harder to play tactical without comm 
---
Outside of 5ms she cant 1 tap anything, her pistol has one of the highest dmg dropoffs in the game. 
---
Just like a blitz, keep your distance and just shoot her with the better ARs the attacker have 
---
That's what I'm thinking. 
---
In all honesty I left in prep phase of the next round because I was too hyped to watch this back and post it
---
Probibly leision 
---
The nerfs were definitley not needed but the argument that she's useless is just fucking stupid.
---
Also won‚Äôt affect Monty or any other shield that I‚Äôm aware of
---
What's funny is that he's holding Smoke's gun.
---
If silver and lower think cav is OP, its not because shes OP, its because you guys dont know how to deal with her.
---
It is a blend of both.
---
For those who claim it is unrealistic, they ask where the reinforcenents and barricades are coming from. Pet alone the sci-fi real-time wallhacks and holograms plus foot fetish snuffing tracking.
---
The realists point to hit breaching and destructible environment as well as headshot insta-kills.
---
Are you trolling? 
---
Do you happen to know *where* shes posts? :O
---
It doesn‚Äôt work like battlefields mechanic unfortunately 
---
Hello?
---
Zofia is like ash hut with one less speed, but also has 2 concussion 
---
5 out of the mentioned ones are not even frustrating but no mention of lion or dokkaebi? ok. 
---
This recoil change is gonna hurt console players a bit more than PC
---
oh yeah i also use compensator on everything, when should i use muzzle brake?
---
You can lean without ADS on console.
---
If you kean that Beaulo thing the just fire rhythmically and his head will pop back there and die. 
---
I've had the same shit happen, also with buck. I threw my nade at a maestro cam. It exploded and I killed myself. I was way out of the range of the explosion and the maestro told me he definitely heard my grenade hit his cam
---
With shotguns the way they are I don't think anyone would take buckshot over slugs aside from setting up the site. Someone around here had the idea of reintroducing the headshot multiplier, but it would suffer falloff. It was an interesting way to keep shotguns from becoming the Sniper 90 in lieu of balance while still reaffirming their intended status as close range power houses. I know that's not what shotguns are for, but if they're not gonna give us slug rounds aside from the BOSG and TASG, might as well make shotguns in general worth using.
---
Same. Never heard of him or 99% of these youtubers or whoever they are that people mention. Only one I know of is IcyCat
---
I think otherwise. I mean his PDW9is 100% balanced with maybe minor imbalances here and there. The C7E though, that fucker is very strong. 30 round mags (31 with 1 in the chamber) very moderate recoil, and not to mention higher RoF and Damage per Bullet.. His shotguns are jokes and the USP.40 is a very fun gun to use.
---
No, that's exactly why they made him move at a snail pace while ADSing with a shield, coupled with the unneeded wide horizontal shield profile.
---
He has his problems, but peeker's advantage is 100% not one of them.
---
Catgirls =/= furries 
---
Improve it by nerfing it
---
Most everything. It has the quickest return after firing and is in most cases the best option for barrels
---
You're gifted with multiple chat options now. Don't use them with toxicity. 
---
your dole dipper madam 
---
Shots to down is still the same in the majority of situations though. Even being fewer in some cases due to the change in damage dropoff.
---
Zofia
---
wut
---
Yea i got a pair of hyperx cloud revolver s as my bday present. Best. Upgrade. Ever.
---
Her elite looks like she‚Äôs 52 and wants to speak to the manager. Why could‚Äôt we get this as her elite.
---
Can‚Äôt. You‚Äôre on butt-box and I‚Äôm on play-with-yourself4
---
I haven't used Zofia too much but I definitely recommend Finka. She's the only attacking operator operator with healing capabilities which makes her extremely helpful, especially in ranked games. Her adrenal boost will help you win more than a few gun fights, even after the nerfs she's been through. You can also revive a DBNO teammate that's across the map, although they'll only have 5 health instead of the standard 50. She also has a shotgun, assault rifle and LMG, which makes her versatile for every playstyle. Overall, Finka &gt; Zofia lol.  
---
I'm not sure the devs are playing the same game we are
---
... How? Do you not understand what gatekeeping is?
---
Those are coming with the 65 nerf!?
---
Hahaha so true. Good luck getting it lmao
---
what does it do, and what do compensator and flash hider do? so you‚Äôre saying to use muzzle brake on everything to reduce recoil?
---
You go shoot yourself in the head with a .308 then a 9mm, and see which one hurts more
---
You betcha 
---
Favela is the best fuze map
---
Ubi probably ran into the logical problem.
---
If copper can't play with plats, then the plqts simply derank to copper. No profitable way to stop that. 
---
Fuck ubi
---
Depends on what your normal rank is and how far you‚Äôre dropping. A rank or two down I guess but going from diamond to copper is just a dick move
---
THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN
---
how do you feel about making monthly toxic montages? I am going to have LOADS of footage available. Someone just teamkilled as Im typing this. Christ. Also to be clear, Im NOT the toxic one. 
---
Maybe some left after Chinagate. 
---
No the wording like spamming non ads shots they would say something like not requiring to aim 
---
Yup. Nothing will happen to them. Its nice to know that blizzard takes action against the people i report on overwatch.
---
&gt; cav is super easy to counter with good communication and drone play!
---
Or for the low low price of 25k renown you can completely negate the operators "stealth" abilities by calling her phone and letting everyone in a 20m radius know where she is 
---
almost like shes a shit operator, in a shit spot, and she's getting a nerf for seemingly no reason other than her "win delta" when shes hardly ever picked in PL 
---
Compared to cod it's realistic, if you compare to Squad it's arcade
---
Barely viable?  Is that why she's in every game?
---
What about insurgency sandstorm

---
You're right. It was fun watching him get better. 
---
I hope they revert these changes in some way. I can live with everything but the recoil. Cav is my main of mains. They've never been nice to her.
---
What gets me is why she has shades but not using them
---
lol, cant wait for it
---
Ah, I rarely play her as an offensive flanker rather than a sneaky one. I‚Äôll always wait until I have at least a 50% chance of survival, of course that‚Äôs just a guess. But her pistol was pretty strong considering it would often beat rifles. Remembering all of the garbage plays that Cav can pull I see why this could help balance her.
---
Leaning  doesn‚Äôt alleviate your shield profile, that isn‚Äôt peeker‚Äôs advantage.

On most maps you can play for range versus her pretty easily, in the past at least before these new changes coming in she couldn‚Äôt do anything if you get her at a range, her pistol starts to only do like 15 dmg a shot pretty quickly, the smg has a super slow fire rate, and the shotgun is...a shotgun. Along with this if you have a teammate at your side (and usually you should flush roamers out with 2-3 people anyways) it‚Äôs no problem assuming you don‚Äôt just rush into every room blind and never watch the flank 
---
I don‚Äôt think that real has space in the regular game 
---
damn, shrapnel is terrifying.
---
they deserve it, i see doc/rook clutch too much sometimes and a nerf would be good for them
---
we all do...
---
Why did you skip the kill cam
---
All mp5s have a bonus and a downside now 
---
Mp5sd can equip a both grips and an ACOG but no barrel attachment
---
Mp5k had barrel attachments but no ACOG or grip options (but mute is 2 speed ) 
---
And now the normal mp5 has all attachments but angled grip and slightly lower damage but that lower damage won't really be noticed because headshots and it'll be 4 chest shits to kill a 1 armor and 5 to kill a 2&amp;3 armor
---
Ppl think they are good cus they silent step and spam luison against players who aren‚Äôt good enough to flick to their head. Cav is also incredibly frustrating to play against.
---

It doesn‚Äôt actually make it footsteps that much quieter my dude, it‚Äôs much quieter when you‚Äôre playing cav than it actually is versus a cav in my experience, it seems like her sound is like half the sound it normally is if we wanna be generous and even then as long as you aren‚Äôt in a gun fight, deaf, or have people screaming in discord/voice chat you should be good 
---
Every.single.time.
---
It's painful how true this is...
---
It‚Äôs even worse if you have mods 
---
No she is not, PL players dont use her a lot, plzz when you get to higher ranks like plat 2 thats when you see she‚Äôs not good.
---
But interro never happens against players who arent brain dead 
---
meh, she is shit anyway.
---
wasnt sure
---
That‚Äôs trash your so bad how can you be bronze 
---
ITS ABOUT TO GET HOT!!! 
---
5
---
That‚Äôs the thing it‚Äôs not a problem for high ranks but for low ranks she‚Äôs stupid
---
I accidentally gave myself all of the achievements, I was fucking with a hack I have and gave them all to me, I had like half of them legit too.
---
Wingardium LeviouSAH!
---
So we should balance her out according to low ranks. 
---
Figured it out. His flash is working fine, my internet is just shit right now. 
---
Yemen it should!
---
It said the MP5 specifically. iirc Echos is the MP5S, so I'm sure if it were getting nerfed they would mention it.
---
They are most of the players in rainbow so yes.
---
In a 1v1 with players of equal skill, BB will win 90% of the time because he can literally avoid a headshot or two.
---
That‚Äôs what they want you to think.
---
Yas! Finally that piece of shit can't win me
---
Since she isn‚Äôt used in competitive or high ranks it won‚Äôt hurt them anyway
---
No we shouldn‚Äôt we should blance operators out from the best.
---
‚ÄúOh that hole in the six...it‚Äôs uhhh.... just a water gun‚Äù

whenever I hold an angle my teammate walks in front of me and get shot at by enemies and i get wall banged
---
And he got so good at it that...
---
Has anyone else experienced this, being able to use 2 drones as an attacker? (besides twitch)
---
yes, but within 6 meters her gun does more damage per second than Ash's R4, and considering the overwhelming majority of combat happens within 8 meters, that's a massive advantage
---
At least they didn't remove her spammable oppornunity
---
you‚Äôre doing great 
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
When me and my buddies first started. We were all level 10 fresh out of terrorist hunt. There was a diamond jaegar who literally aced us 3 times. We couldn't do shit on attack. Thank god we were competent on defense.

less  DPS with a SILENCED  9MM  HANDGUN than a  5.56 ASSAULT RIFLE.
---
her gadget is silently sprinting and lion scanning the entire attack for 10 seconds.
---
  
---
just like with blitz or BB or lion right?
---
And she wants to talk to your manager.
---
Ye but they changed her wonky ass damage drop off so she can actually 2 shot at longer ranges than before
---
And like I said, it only shows where you finish a season, not where you‚Äôve reached, and the game only awards the charm for the rank you finish as, not reached, so since I didn‚Äôt finish Plat 3, I didn‚Äôt receive the Plat 3 Charm.

There is another....

But for now I wanna see some evidence of you being plat and you explaing how it would be easy for you, a hard stuck silver/bronze to get to high plat and play against people how aren't braindead

Maybe try using a mic or impacts, or a shotgun.

Can‚Äôt stealth factor be utilized by all Light Armor operators, even though with varying results?

Yes finally I got it. I was trying to change my flair by clicking the dots above this post. This was a very painful process for me because I have an IQ of 5. Thank you for your support...
---
WTF indeed
---
I once shot two projectiles into a smoke on plane and i STILL had to shoot kill him with the main weapon.
---
Wow, that's big. She must be the first female in R6 Pro League right?
---
For abt 2m
---
if you deployed your second drone and your first drone is still alive, this is the case.
---
I feel as if they could've just messed around with the damage falloff range of the luison, or tweaked her primary guns slightly, though I'm open to being berated if this Nerf pans out well. 
---
No
---
Me too, I don't have anyone to play with so I am the mercy to squads who can TK me each round and not get punished for it.
---
If you ever want to play against/with me just let me know man, and you‚Äôll see I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúbrain dead‚Äù player. And I‚Äôm currently only where I am because my nephew had been staying with me for a week and he‚Äôs been playing it while I‚Äôm at work. 
---
Now, as for the Plat proof, wish I would‚Äôve taken a screenshot when I got it but I thought I‚Äôd get the charm until I found out it only awards the rank you finish. But I have no proof of that. The silver rank was from my first time ever picking this game up. I‚Äôve reached at least Gold 1 every season sense (until now).
---
Goddess was first (Cloud 9) But was kicked when they moved to repocity.
---
Actually, they are standardizing damage drop-off so she will be even stronger at medium range so... People just need to calm down and test things out before freaking out, as always.
---
And forgive those who sinned against us
---
Maybe not the whole pierces shields thing, but it could make every operator take damage like a 1 armour, even if they have a rook plate equipped.
---
Well that makes my job easier
---
If I'm reading this correcting, Cav now two shot bodyshots three armour operators at 12m.
---
I'll be honest, I very rarely one shotted people as Cav as it is.
---
...this might be good for her.
---
I downvoted because it was 70
---
I hope you realize most rifle calibers are already armor penetrating by default.
---
F for my man
---
Ah, I was not aware.
---
Why would you teamkill him it‚Äôs casual really not that big of a deal 
---
Look here buddy, I don‚Äôt like desktop reddit and the USB port on my pc is broken so I had to Improvise. Adapt. And overcome the struggles. 
---
Seeme like you headshot vigil /s
---
15-20
---
I went blind on it in a few minutes
---
And clearly it is. I have the Charm for finishing Gold 3, they say Gold 4. Not a huge difference, but I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not entirely accurate. It also shows I have 1 play as Ying when she was my main for 3-4 months after she was released. 
---
I don't know, not every operator should have killing machines in their hands. Caveira has a really good ability. Not very useful against coordinated teams, but if you manage to hide yourself, you could achieve some good flanks once in a while, even against coordinated teams. I'm ok with her kit. I don't use her primaries. Usually I'm sneaking with the pistol
---
You do realize that there are several teams. The team that does bug fixing isn‚Äôt the same one that does all of the cosmetics 
---
But, 92FS' runs at 15 Clips!!!! I Thought we're running realism here!
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Least it isnt On the TTS
---
he maybe away from u 
---
Several
---
Yeah it‚Äôs still almost always a 3tap, which, with 12rounds, is powerful. Combined with silence to get behind enemies, they seem to have done a decent job
---
Yeah.
---
u/ProfXavr comment
---
PepeHands. A nerf is a nerf though i won't argue it. She deserved something at the most. 
---
&gt; I just need one shot in the head.
---
That is not unique to Glaz.
---
she shouldn‚Äôt be getting balanced for pro league though? as should none of the ops... don‚Äôt understand why people are more interested in balancing for the minority rather than the majority of people who actually play the game (including themselves)
---
"Doc Main"  
---
I smell a traitor!
---
Lets hope it didnt break the game even more
---
Just wondering what people‚Äôs opinions were of the rework, spoke to someone yesterday and they said they‚Äôre never playing her again and that ubi ruined her. Seems a bit ott but I wondered what everyone else thought
---
Just don‚Äôt game on a laptop 
---
It does for kills but I'm not 100% sure if you get those points if it's an injure
---
"Low mag size and high recoil" "R4-C"?????
---
You keep saying he doesn't know that it's possible. I don't think you should underestimate what young kids are capable of...
---
You have no proof! And neither do I!
---
Bio is a bit lackluster and cringey but it‚Äôs a decent op ability
---
Where did he rapell from
---
That looks dope af my dude
---
I have them off, but I have seen people get the 10 for an injure at one point.
---
They simply re*PRESS*ed Yacht...
---
Oh no! Now she takes some skill to play? Most cav mains are salty cause they can‚Äôt just zoom around a corner and 1 shot everyone anymore. She was over powered to begin with especially after the recoil change. I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs getting addressed. 
---
says the crybaby content creator who does nothing but play her while screaming sounds and tbagging. fuck off 
---
"you can stop worrying about grenades now, just be careful of the shooted"
---
I'm more amazed this was done on 4:4 OT in a 2v3.
---
You know what. Fuck it. I drew it. I didn't expect the post to do so well. do you think I should delete the post?
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
Pros don‚Äôt use her because her ability is inherently unhelpful, most of the time. In ranked, you‚Äôre essentially relying on your enemies missing you when droning. which is much more likely to happen than in pro league. Pros are methodical in their room clearance, it‚Äôs unlikely that any cav could sneak up on a pro team. 
---
Some people are, especially when you can‚Äôt hear certain death approaching, some even said she should be turned down to a 1 speed and made to anchor (a bit much imo) however every caviera main currently are starting to get annoyed because they hadn‚Äôt done anything to her in ages, now they have, they‚Äôre annoyed. 
---
wait what ? lesions weapons are probably some of the strongest 
---
You really care what someone like king George thinks? He literally bitches about everything in the game unless it works for him, including other players. 
---
Recoil control i guess. Prefire helps. Her recoil pattern is mostly upwards and to the left. Just pull your mouse down and right. That's what most players do. However, I cannot get used to it and my spray hits everything but the target.
---
But most of my kills are with her shotgun. I only use her pistol for weekly challenges. It has zero ability to 1v2+ anyone with a brain. The only way ur using it on more than 1 person is if theyre completely oblivious and dont hear the first shots.
---
&gt;weak
---
Literally not even close to what cav is. She‚Äôs fine as is, this nerf isn‚Äôt going to ruin her. 
---
thank u for adding nsfw my boss wouldve killed me!
---
So that means he is the korean jesus
---
And now every Black ops game has 10 different versions of nuketown in the rotation 
---
Theyre going to need a terrabyte to buff hibanas face
---
Don‚Äôt let anyone feel bad about this. I mean, you should feel bad, but from your comments elsewhere it seems like you feel like this a big deal. You lied for some Internet recognition. It‚Äôs an impressive drawing and you didn‚Äôt harm anyone, it‚Äôs really whatever 
---
Pretty sure rogue 9 said that they're also giving her the regular pistol damage drop off 
---
No. At worst they‚Äôd be figuratively destroying her.
---
I'm sorry sir but you didn't throw a grenade in there .... it was a nuke.
---
Man i miss how this game was now 
---
Technically correct except for Black ops 4 being released with the ability to simply just click on the greyed out option that would then let you vote for it leading to infinite firing ranges. May have been patched out but for at least a month and a half it was that way

Unless you all play with virtually no ping, peeker's advantage is a thing regardless if intentional or not. You see your enemy slightly quicker than he sees you and even if he holds an angle and shoots first you still have a shield to cover your face. I have substantially better k/d with BB, my general average is 1.1 while it's 1.4 with BB (with a dmr on console). So I can't aim for shit, however start to kill much easier when using him and winning fights against people holding impossible angles which I know I'd lose if I used different op. 
---
Yes hello ubisoft? Yeah it appears my monty is broken
---
Honestly lowering the damage to 27 from 30 isn‚Äôt going to hurt it. It‚Äôs still a hs machine. That‚Äôs why it is fair. It won‚Äôt do any damage to the gun really. 
---
&gt;Specialized subreddit

Pretty popular subreddit for PC gamers that are on reddit.

&gt;occasionally

Or all the time, how about.
---
&gt;for more than I originally claimed
---
I listed a super high end SSD for $20 more than I claimed, which was posted  recently. If you use your eyes and look, then you'll surely find mid-low tier SSDs that will still perform for around $60.
---
Tell your mom I said hi.
---
No, I don't even use it on sledge anymore. Thatcher has more that enough of a role to play. Rook is the only operator where Thatcher cannot be a counter to with his gadget he's not underpowered. 
---
Bro I have a girlfriend look at my profile picture carefully !!

The blast radius is totally random at times, but just try to place it up to 5m away from it and you should be fine.
---
Tbh, I almost never place my traps under Windows, i usually place them around corners or under rotation holes where I know people will come through
---
Is this a joke?
---
Only thing I can think of is that he spotted you on his camera and has INSANE map awareness to know exactly where you were?
---
Exact same title and everything, not even trying to hide it
---
No, he is a support operator, its a rare thing to become the fragger of your team as Thatcher.
---
Only if your fraggers die you can switch role with them after you help your team ofc, but in no way the smg 11 will help him, his guns are great for any range
---
I want seige to punish TEAM KILLING. Which they still don't do 
---
Lol only corporal, never seen that on a plat player before
---
So fuck the lagging? Rubber banding? Inconsistent frame rate? Inconsistent client side debris? Nope? Okay. Forgot, it's Ubisoft.
---
I don't bother trying to match the holograms, I'd usually leave 1 or 2 on site to help out the anchors, but would keep at least 1 with me and roam. When I get into a gunfight and don't manage to get the kill, I'll drop the hologram and reposition, people tend to shoot it no matter what you look like if they were just shooting at you which would give you the advantage having just repositioned
---
&gt;Their gun isn't the issue here.
---
Try the P90 then. The gun is quite an issue, the MP5 is very strong. Sad to see this nerf though, I love the MP5.
---
thank new, I just thinking how to spend game money
---
Erh I don't know man, but in my experience Cav can be really-really surprised when they try to sneak up on some noisy entry team and find just one guy aiming down the sights right at her face.
---
It's not Cav's fault that people picked up a general Rambo mentality on entry and feel offended when defenders do their job and actually... You know DEFEND.
---
Same way with Lesion and Echo.
---
Echo's job is to spot-ping-stun and be a nonstop annoyance to the entry team, Lesion's job is to lay traps to slow or deny entry directions and if its possible perform takedowns to lessen the threat of the opposition and lower the potential to carry out their mission.
---
Cav for example can't really "spam" silent step as it gets depleted and needs time to recharge AND it is NOT eliminating the sound of her approach if she isn't crouch-walking meantime. Running or regular movement while using silent step still makes noise that the attackers can hear and prepare for her arrival IF they bother to not run like suicidal Rambos.
---
You do know that every scope is aligned to work at a certain distance. So while you‚Äôre observation isn‚Äôt completely wrong, it‚Äôs wrong still.
---
Cav was only good in specific situations.  Oh well, she got fucked up the ass by Ubi, just like Ela did in Grim Sky, even though she was balanced in Parabellum.
---
No he didn't, he is saying it's good she is specifically good at close range and not long range with how many defense roamers are good at long range.. 
---
Surprisingly no, pretty much point blank.
---
Yeah, but she didn‚Äôt need a nerf either
---
Ubi's like, "see you in a week"
---
This is not a quide, it's just fast cut clips
---
What's harder than teamwork? I mean ubisoft literally shoves it down our throats by "balancing" operators who are viable even without teamwork.
---
But the nerf was still a bit much
---
i use mouse buttons too, i dont know how people can press d and e or a and q at the same time. this makes it more efficient for me to use mouse buttons. And it doesnt ruin your aim at all. Im not sure why pressing a button on your mouse would ruin your aim. lol. Each to their own but i find it way easier to lean with my right hand and move with my left.
---
Sun Tsu said that!
---
"Lets just stick a subreddit only American's can use"
---
Searching on other websites give me a $49 aud 256gb ssd. Now that's cheap.
---
Not always true, depends how good of a cav you are :p
---
Lol
---
Parabellum she could barely hold her own, Grim Sky ruined her.
---
And after that and after every bug fixes there is a new bug introduced
---
Yea well that‚Äôs what keeps this game interesting. Like you wouldn‚Äôt need to rage if spam tilting and crouching wasn‚Äôt a thing but since it is, you can rage all u want ;)
---
Key word "slightly". 
---
It's unlikely to make every single operator in their very own "middle" in terms of balancing, there's always someone that's going to be slightly higher in pick rate, or win rate, or both.
---
Mind the devs team DID say the chart isn't the only thing they're looking at when balancing operators. 
---
Their goal should aim at limiting "heavy damages", such as 3%+ win rate or 60%+ pick rate. Rook is one of them, and the reason is simple : literally makes 3s defenders as 3s 3a ones which can influence the round good enough. The attacking team is **forced** to perform headshots for an optimal play here, not saying they don't have to if the defenders are 1a, but it's obviously more complicated when they gain armor withotu decreasing their very own speed, which is a pretty good key point of Siege at the moment, we just have to take a look at Ash's pick rate to confirm that.
---
And it's just as I said : performing headshots against Rook's armored defenders, which isn't a problem at very high level of play like Platinum/Diamond, this is why Rook isn't one of the most picked operator either in this tier-level but still has a very useful "gadget" to give a much better chance to win than, let's say, Alibi or Frost. (also the high-tier players might be very good at headshots, it's not like every single Plat+/Dia have 100% of headshot rate either)
---
I think you just need to realise that you‚Äôre statement was dumb as hell 
---
sad noise
---
Still tryna figure out what map this is
---
I literally was just taking about how the bullets are fired, R6S still has them right aligned with the scope at any distance. I can't believe I have to even explain that.
---
IIRC arms are now without damage reduction, since they block bullets and it's confusing with hardly a benefit (as in aiming at the arms hardly happens, but shooting a torso with arms wiggling in the way happens way too often)
---
It‚Äôs not my fault if I need to go eat or help someone with something what am I meant to say no siege is more important?

Does it have 7.1 ?
---
Lol I remember how shocked I was the first time someone called me ‚Äútrash‚Äù. In casual. In a video game. People are real dicks with no perspective on anything and it won‚Äôt ever change 
---
Worst thing about Cav is that when you are playing against her she was scary af but when playing with her, she turns out to be retarded. 
---
7.1 is really useful in r6, because it is much easier to tell location, BUT in game settings have an effect on it too. If you have you settings set to night mode, you can hear footsteps better, but not the direction they are coming from. Hi-Fi will give a better direction, but they will be harder to hear. If you are really looking for a new headset, i would recommend the arctis 7.

###AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH

Pretty much.

You wanna play the realistic way then be my guest

Would you be upset if they just took their Scots away? The biggest problem with Doc and Room that I see is how much they peak. I've had matches where our dock spawn peaked the entire enemy team. Not really a fun experience for either side.
---

I usually hate caveira but goddamn is this a bad change. 
---
They should increase the delay between each flash. 
---
Tell your gamertag if you have better stats Than me. Whats the point saying that i'm trash when you are afraid to Tell your gamertag. 
---
J√§ger you fool
---
Indeed
---
what are the attachments for his weapons?
---
If it shouldn't take more than one player to kill an op then Monty, Clash, and Blitz also have no place in this game.
---
Say that you are in a game or something. Or leave the game. Going afk (especially to eat) is really rude. 
---
I was playing with a guy who kept going afk. He was in my squad, and we all knew each other. But I don't play with him anymore, especially since all our other friends told me that's normal for him. 
---
He'd pop in randomly each game, always after start, and sometimes he did well. But it was so inconsiderate. 
---
Im sorry but i disagree with absolutely everything you have said. Elas scorpion is far from bad, its actually REALLY good. I dont think cav needed a change at all but i doubt this nerf will completely kill her as she will still 2 or 3 shot, glaz really does not need less fire rate, i think he is perfectly fine where he is, you cannot have a proper sniper in rainbow where the average kill distance is 8m. Tachanka having his lmg as a primary isnt a bad idea but giving him a bipod wont change much, he will still be stationary. When you said blitz is broken i thought you meant as in he is bad, to my surprise you think he is overpowered, which youre completely blowing it out of proportion, blitz has sooooo many bugs he cannot even show his full potential, getting shot through your shield is VERY common. Lion doesnt need a rework imo, he is broken in pro league but in ranked i really dont think he is THAT broken as to need a full rework, at most for a nerf id say that he tracks people like caveiras interrogation, not in a super precise red outline but with a square and an icon that only shows their direction but not distance.
---
Yeah, not gonna lie you just made yourself look really dumb 
---
‚ÄúGet in the van‚Äù
---
I know what you mean, but that only works on casual, in ranked most people use their brain
---
If you 2ould have better stats then you would Tell your gamertag.....

Just one?

Spawn peeking is part of the game get over it and just watch the angles

You may have an addiction.

Same issue for me, it could take me 20 mins to find a ranked game. I was told to leave queue after 5 mins and search again but still can‚Äôt find a game.

I remember my first ranked ever was a 1v5 because everyone left after the first round. Enemy team rushed and raped me every round.

No bandit :( guess I'll have to settle with tachanka 
---
Use her shotgun for the L and the memes
---
Oh you meant IQ not kaid
---
Sure about IQ destroying attacker drones? 
---
Sledge when? 
---
Do yourself a favor and look up her current damage drop off. 99 damage looks like a lot on paper until you realize it's essentially melee range. If a hip-firing Cav peeking around a door is a problem, learn how to hold better angles.
---
Also the the stray bullet connecting and needing a reset thing. So in your scenario you've pushed close enough to a Cav where a single bullet did enough damage to need a reset. Do you bitch when a similar gunfight happens but this time it's a Kaid shotgun? We should nerf Kaid's shotgun then!
---
If you get hipfire peeked because you didn't drone that's carelessness on your part. If you're out of drones because they got destroyed, that carelessness on your part. Pushing a Cav is just stupid. You're closing the distance for her. You should be flushing her out with utility. Pushing a high-damage, close-range op and then bitching about dying because you got into her optimal range is mindnumbingly stupid.
---
You can tell yourself her Luison is a crutch whenever you die, but it's probably because you can't accept getting outplayed or you did something stupid. Putting her Luison in the same ballpark as pre-nerf Ela and the 44. mag makes me wonder if you're just lumping everything you personally don't like as "unbalanced". The Luison has clear counterplay which is stay at a far enough range where the damage isn't insane.
---
Also her changes aren't just the damage, it's recoil as well. Not to mention a large part of her usefulness was taking advantage of whatever chip damage you got on attackers. Being able to close the distance and get into range where you can 1 shot down a wounded person should be rewarded. The difference between a 1 shot and 2 shot TTK is substantial.
---
And all this is coming from a guy that doesn't even play her that often. It just sets a bad precedent that an op with clear counterplay that isn't that viable to begin with getting nerfed because people are bad.
---
Well, considering they butchered a new op (clash) almost immediately shows me they could care less. Pro league is probably dictating all future game changes....
---
Oh nice. Ill get on and update it. 
---
The only thing that i can think of that it'll genuinely change at the moment is the shots to kill when referencing and thinking about downed players.  At close ranges, it would have taken 4 shots to kill a 1 armored enemy. With 27 damage, damage would enable players to survive (barely), but be left in the downed state.
---
It might be to make sure that the MP5 isn't too particularly powerful by enabling players to be revived after being sprayed down.
---
I personally think its a pointless change because the MP5 is perfectly fine where it is, but Ubiman continues to demonstrate that it doesn't understand game balance so fucked if I know.
---
I actually haven't seen any hackers in high gold since the big ban a few weeks ago, but I do tend to only play a handful of games a week due to school keeping me busy. 
---
~~lots of diamonds boosting bronze players though....~~
---
If you areny communicating thats your fault, it doesnt mean cav is op. 
---
I‚Äôm not :/
---
(I got you fam)
---
The joke was that OP was obviously referencing a specific book that has clear connection to his observation, and the comment sarcastically named a book written by the same author, arguably just as well known, but has nothing to do with what OP was talking about.
---
It was baiting someone (in this case, you) to correct them.
---
Trauma gives 2 armor aka makes a 1 armor into 3 armor
---
Did you hear they are trying to do a reboot without Johnny depp
---
Yes. 
---
When you disconnect from a game, it's more likely that you'll get an ongoing match. It's best to just stay in those games
---
Maybe, but the time there also includes menu time. I have friends with thousands of hours in games simply because they AFK all the time.
---
30-&gt;27 is one more bullet to take down a 2 armor

Hello OxyRiggs, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aglmxj/debris/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Pretty much

"They're *all* red!"

"*Then press all of them.*"

Just... press it

I am level 275, so it can't be all afk.

Where you at favela or yacht?
---
Getting smacked with a 100lb shield tends to hurt.
---
Yeah, I agree, but on console Blitz and Ela are still an issue.  Ela‚Äôs horrendous and Blitz is broken on here.
---
Tbh no one cares about casual. And ik it is really annoying playing casual and more annoying if you play it alone 
---
Dude I dont wanna hear it. I see the cheesiest and stupidest run outs in pro league every night. The fact that 3 years later defenders arent immediately detected outside the building blows my mind. 
---
mdrrrrr 
---
quit asking to be carried and earn your rank 
---
The new lighting makes it kinda impossible to see. In blood orchid when I completed it, I could actually see pretty well through smoke. But now its like everyone needs thermal goggles just to see.
---
Just look at the windows and click on their heads!
---
Its casual though, you'll get more teammates. (Not pointing out the obvious, just presenting why they left without probably a second thought)
---
The whole debate is pedantic, even games that allow you manipulate the scope zeroing is still gonna be pretty lenient about it

Kill cam is bugged all to hell this season.  Hopefully its fixed soon

I've been trying to spread awareness of this all season. It's worse than ever and has affected almost a quarter of the games I would have won this season, making it near impossible to climb higher than Plat 2 thus far. I had a post here that was gaining traction but it was stealth-deleted by the mods and by the time my challenge got it restored a day later it lost all traction. Keyboard and mouse users are frustrating, but you can beat them. You can't beat people that literally cannot lose because they make it like the game never happened.
---
Well you learn something knew everyday, I guess it‚Äôs just another thing on ubisofts long list of things that they need to fix 
---
I thought the range was aight to begin with, and even then I would just use the smg for range. I can understand thinking of it as more of a rework, though
---
Nice job on the wall
---
Caster found.
---
They should just give her a tranq dart gun instead or something. Make it so it only knocks people down and if they aren‚Äôt killed or revived in a certain window they just get back up on their own not missing any extra hp. If you want to kill people use her other weapon. 
---
That's what 90% of the people do when they post clips of the "super bad hitreg, which is ubi's fault".
---
I think this man just broke the record for fastest ragequit sans Alt-F4
---
Yeah i hope too. It really made comp a lot more fun in overwatch and i know it will work for r6 too because you dont need to carry some dumb players in some matches.
---
Just siege things...
---
This would only be better if you swapped the audio with Jagers scream when he gets shot / hit with a twitch drone
---
I know and they patched it. The problem is if you leave before she starts doing it 
---
Yeah, and Cav gets hard countered by high headset volume
---
Thank you! How much does it cost?
---
that‚Äôs not true at all. her gun is slightly above average and she has good utility. that‚Äôs her purpose. utility. she has basically the same utility as Ash (if not less since Ash is 3 speed)
---
You can't just hold angles and hope to kill someone on attack, I hope you know that much about this game that you're acting so high and mighty about. You have to push, the timer works against the attackers. The only time holding angles works reliably is when you're trying to hold a rotate. No sane roamer is going to try to rotate into the open when they've taken a hard wall and they hear footsteps. Their entire objective is to peak when someone gets close, and if you just ignore them then they flank you late in the round. Keeping eyes on someone from a flank when you're trying to execute isn't reliable, roam hunting makes it easier to achieve that execute.
---
So you essentially have an operator that you aren't supposed to push because of her damage up close, yet you're the side that's supposed to be pushing and clearing rooms otherwise you lose. You see the problem with that? You're essentially banking on her making a stupid rotate or you're forced to spend utility that you're supposed to be saving for the main execute.
---
And all this talk for, again, a *buff to Cav that I agree with*. It gets rid of what makes her frustrating to play against while making her more viable in the overall design of the game. Her pistol is, at first glance, going to be the best all around pistol in the game, with only 1 damage less than the Keratos while silenced with double the mag size. While having a normal damage drop off model.
---
The more you play the better you'll get to know where to roam, but for general advice: If they're smart they'll probably enter on the same floor but opposite side of the map from site, as this allows them to sweep through for roamers. This is VERY common on Villa, for example. 
---
I wouldn't class it as a meme..... just a statement on how i feel 
---
You know I had to do it to em.
---
Awesome! Is it free?
---
If you peek the enemies with 200ping you will have an advantage, but if you get peeked, you will die like instantly on your end.
---
&gt;And it's not like she was ever alive, she has one of the lowest pick rates in the game for a reason (in high tier)
---
Exactly, which is why she didn't need a nerf in the first place.
---
I completely agree, I think it would make siege a lot more competitive aswell due to more and more people being made to communicate and work together 
---
Valk, Vigil, Echo, Lesion, Maestro
---
The problem there is, that to win a round you might have to kill your teammates. Let‚Äôs say for example that there is a guy walking into the door. Your friend is oblivious, and he‚Äôs standing between you two. It‚Äôs 2-3. You have to take that shot or you risk losing the game. I‚Äô d say just implement the forgive system, rather than damage ban.
---
I‚Äôm a non furry too, remove them.
---
&gt;Removing the abilty to sprint from him would render him pretty much useless.
---
he can still sprint, just not with his shield up
---
&gt;I also would suggest that when blitz melees somoone they go dbno.
---
That sounds really good
---
This is most likely the correct assessment of this glitch
---
reposted every day since Vigil was released 
---
Same set up as mine. Thinking of spending the 10k on the black gun skin just for his weapons.
---
It‚Äôs completely free to enter, I‚Äôm not sure about NA dates but in the EU Go4 is on sundays. If you have a reliable squad it‚Äôs well worth entering, beats playing ranked any day
---
they thought you were just a normal doc but then you bring out the gillotine
---
49 if im not wrong
---
last time i checked, he had about 11k hours so yeah
---
Exaclty. More competitive more skill-based and more exciting.
---
In my opinion she is unbalanced tho. Not massively but I think he is. Tho I don‚Äôt think she needs a nerf for the time.
---
I think deep inside his scream is more like this... 
---
A lot of times in my games, even if she doesn‚Äôt try an interrogation just downing and finishing someone is much easier than it would be for other operators. The person standing behind you can‚Äôt easily do very much.
---
this is most definitely not epic
---
*fak*
---
I have mine set so I can hear someone prone shuffling on the floor through a wall, but I‚Äôve never heard cav come up from behind 
---
oh shit get back move out of the way 
---
Definitely a meme lol
---
See the latter half of the comment. The nerf does nothing to stop that. 
---
The thing is Rook/Doc doesn't really have anything going for them except their gun. Their gadgets are borderline useless, so they need good guns to make up for that. 
---
Yup
---
I had a mini debate with myself on which of those two are better. I settled with Kaid because of his hatch blocking power but yes overall Mute does beat Kaid.
---
Sounds pretty convenient lol  
---
Thanks for the update!
---
Course. Just a pet peeve of mine in general.
---
I think Blitz should be the only shield op with OHK but only in a melee after a sprint or something like that, while all other shield ops should only do 50 damage or put you in DBNO
---
Fine by me. I hate that trick-ass bitch
---
haha, it doesn't hurt anyone, just something to laugh at
---
Nah
---
Although to be honest back when he had an 800hp shield it wasn‚Äôt really that broken cuz at the time shotguns were ridiculously OP so it kinda balanced out in a way. It wasn‚Äôt until after the shorty nerf that people began to realize that the devs has some work to do with BB...
---
New pixel peek lol but for this pixel peek just shoot through the walls haha
---
Yeah I'm completely fine with it but I'm just saying
---
Ellies such a twat for that
---
Eh screw it I'll just ping u/Its_Epi u/UbiNoty u/Ubi-Ludo u/UbiJustin u/Ubi-Zoro u/UbiPasta because high-level Ranked has been nearly unplayable this season and these posts never get *any* traction
---
Dew it
---
I realy miss unicum guies.
---
This realy made my day.
---
Yes, he/she was Cav 
---
Spray and pray time, nice clip 
---
Not allowed to have my own opinions I see, oh well.
---
Nah, it affects Cav specifically because her PRB or whatever the pistol's called is a modified version called the Lusion.
---
You do realize that cav can 2 shot you from farther away now, right?
---
Pretty sure MP5SD also has much worse damage drop off which makes it worse at range
---
That's what I thought when I saw it for the first time
---
Wait.... whaaaaa?
---
*Single suppressed shot in the distance*
---
It's guaranteed.  I'm calling it, they're not gonna change it
---
Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt support m&amp;k on console. Only way to use a m&amp;k is by purchasing a controller emulator to bypass a function they do not allow in the game. 
---
Hacking is a genuine problem. Although, I‚Äôve actually seen more this season than past. I‚Äôve been playing since Skull Rain, although I only have about 1200 hours clocked, I had 5-6 since Para Bellum, and recently, I played with some diamond teleporters, and it‚Äôs really tiring to have to TK them to make sure that the enemy team doesn‚Äôt get fucked, and I have to convince my teammates not to be dickheads so they TK to. And some of you may be wondering why not just let them go. Because any points received through unfair advantage is like getting pity points. Please, if you ever come across a hacker on your team, put a bullet in their head and be done with it.
---
Yay time to go from rarely playing her to never playing her.

The one hacker I went against this season was someone that we were about to 3-0.  He had 0 kills two Assists then he aces the next round by spawn peeking as jager and when I watched the kill cam he was watching me through the puller.  He continued this throughout the game then at the end said ez and left immediately 
---
You probably have the Intel CPU bug just like I do. Its ridiculous, and I have tried every way to fix it but I just can't. 
---
PrEsS
---
Can confirm. They're disgusting.
---
Figured. Just wanted to make sure since they're technically the same gun
---
Pro counters lmao. Just because they ban someone since they dislike paying against him doesn't mean jack shit. They're pro players. They'll have counters and work around as needed. But the whole game can't be based around lea than one percent of the playerbase. Against most regular Blackbeards the tactics that I mentioned work. Guns aren't the only way to kill someone.
---
this final scene is going away further and further evry day goddamnit
---
Im sure this would "revolutionize" the meta ;)
---
He just has a good gaming chair
---
Approved.
---
Be my guest
---
If melee attacks weren't a OHK they would be practically useless since the TTK is so low.
---
What bug ?
---
I think he means the bullets come out of your face not the gun
---
What bug?
---
Jackal, Lion, Dokkaebi, Blitz, Monty. 
---
First he‚Äôs running a shotgun which is a problem in itself but when he‚Äôs in close enough range of maverick were a shotgun is viable he used his pistol. And for the ash i mean she pulled the gu needle out right i front of him...
---
despite the negative press covfefe
---
*inb4 they nerf her shotgun*
---
I could maybe understand the first time, but the second ^*what*
---
Sherlock holmes
---
You can look/shoot through the hole of the skylight by proning and sprinting in front of it to get on a little step. The killcam was not accurate because it showed him not being on this step which means in the replay he is further down than he actually was, that's why he seems to shoot through the wall.
---
R.I.P. and I'm a CAv main. #resetcav
---
Is no one going to mention how blind and deaf ash is?
---
I‚Äôm subscribing this motherfuka this is hilarious 
---
I wish it wasn't
---
People do though people still spawn peek with Jager and Bandit who don‚Äôt have acogs 
---
I think the second nade went off. Somehow it made you throw two 
---
So why is it a problem than?
---
Really good change. acogs on defence can go fuck themselfs.
---
I only have 8GB of RAM at the moment.
---
oh, i am not downvoting you. 
---
but objectively it is one of the best weapons in game. if you dont like it that‚Äôs perfectly fine ? 
---
I think its good. They just verify/agree what someone said.
---
Not a big deal.
---
Correct.
---
No 
---
-Ubisoft
---
Literally happened to me yesterday, I switched to jager the next defender round and headshot three of them through a Mira window
---
Same thing happened to me. On a ranked game at Hereford.
---
The point is that this "nerf" could actually work in her favor, making her possibily more useful in some scenario. 
---
For example, in bank you have long hallways, and her pistol was hardly viable unless you were playing near the stairs. Now, she could sneak up on your ass and score an INTERROGACION rather than a kill. 
---
That is probably why you are dropping frames. 16GB is the bare minimum if you want a good gaming experience.
---
He was either boosted from copper and had to play against plat/diamonds or plays a more supportive role 
---
I'm a Cav main, too.  Glaz/Cav/Ela.  Gonna have to drop her, too
---
Yeah
---
Leslie Knope is that you?
---
spoilers for the last of us.
---
the scene before is the main character getting impaled, and then passing out and falling off a horse, game dont tell you if he's dead or not for like another hour or so
---
Really?
---
Damn.  I've heard her from time to time.  
---
I was similar to this. He plays support for a good squad.
---
Ya he'll prob be fine, just wondering if that would be a breach of contract...
---
yeah, house is insanely attacker sided cuz of dlc ops
---
With no acog. 
---
It's not about personal preferences, it's about overall pros which MP5 has. 
---
Burst fire mode with rapid taps is very viable for me, just takes some getting used to.
---
If its not important why bring it up then...
---
There's so many more operators that are in desperate need of tweaks whilst they are getting worked on. 
---
Ubi seem to just look at graphs to determine what ops to nerf/buff and don't listen to the players. 
---
Thanks, I hate you
---
A good support player, maybe a lion main. Or boosted. Only way
---
Mav is very under powered atm he's not very useful but cav is overpowered in the hands of anyone semi competent. I have had more aces with cav than anyone else in high plat/diamond play. She's op anyone who thinks she's not is just saying that because they main her and don't want her to be nerfed 
---
Would be high risk if they were immediately revealed. Its attackers vs defenders, how does having the defenders launch themselves out windows to attack in a hostage situation make the game better in any way?
---
The mp7, the Scorpion, Lesion's primary (forget the name) the Russian SMG, all of these are better if you dont take the loss of ACOG into account. As someone with almost 1000 kills with Rook alone, I take his shotgun over his MP5 90% of the time

against most blackbeards in casual, on maps that are usually shit like plane and favela. In ranked anywhere above gold, playing a good blackbeard is basically free kills

Usually, killing someone with a thermite charge is very rare. Unless they‚Äôre downed. I play in around Platinum, and usually I fake out the bandit with advanced placement, but getting an injure or kill is just so satisfying

Her shotgun and her pistol serve the same role. Spam at close quarters kills. Make the pistol worse at that, makes picking the shotgun more of a choice.

Play with him and invite the randoms to the party chat or just go into game chat.

Let him host then hopefully you'll match with similar ranked players to him and he should make new friends to play with

U play on pc or console ?
---
Thanks to the update you‚Äôre still going to be 2-shot but now from farther away
---
For a guy that does such a good job looking changes up should also be aware of her current damage dropoff then. If she's in range for you to get 1 tapped after taking some chip damage, you've made a mistake. In your specific case, almost 2~3M from her. Maybe use your drone more and don't put yourself in that situation?
---
It's related as it completes our picture of you. 
---
I record every game I play in and have a 5 TB external hard drive (wised flex, but it was on sale). Point is, I honestly didn‚Äôt notice until it was mentioned somehow...
---
I feel like that‚Äôs true for every operator. In fact a good caveira doesn‚Äôt even need a good team behind her and she can still wallhack everyone, moving or not moving. Nobody asks for a cav rework
---
"Kobe"
---
Yes, early last year. Haven't shared it, thought it was neat
---
Little bit of both, but when I spring it's like people have aimbot on my shoulders, but when I shoot blitz shoulders none of the bullets connect 
---
Unless they give us the forgive/punish feature. So, when you accidentally kill someone, they can forgive you, which would negate the 100 dmg you've just done.
---
They are all atleast a four speed.
---
Must be Data LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
---
Think you got jipped bro. All base operators are automatically free now if I'm correct.
---
You‚Äôre just acting toxic, instead of commenting something useful, you‚Äôre bringing up something from a previous post. Feel sorry for u: 
---
The idea of an operator who limits or even denies basic abilities in a shooter (like fucking MOVING in lion‚Äôs case) is just wrong. In certain situations he‚Äôs just way too overpowered. Just imagine a post plant situation and lion gets activated. How are you supposed to retake the site and get to the defuser? Also in combination with other operator and drones it makes it way too easy to corner a roamer and hunt him down. Lion is just not gut for the games overall health.

---
I didn‚Äôt make this post, calm down
---
Interesting points, I can see how that is broken I pro play and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs banned, I guess I‚Äôve just never played against a decent lion? They always scan as soon as the round starts which seems useless to me. But your post plant example is a good point

Ah, I understand, sorry about that.
---
I don‚Äôt see why they don‚Äôt release the change now since Lion is already quarantined then with the data they get they see if he‚Äôll be unquarantined for after invitational season
---
I dont understand your point. Her range is increased. Her entire kit is designed to flank. Droning helps you when pushing forward. Not watching your back. Its impossible to "never" get flanked.
---
Her nerf is to discourage her as a firefight pistol user. So when you push on her, shes not going to get a single shot on you and down you (cause you were a bit weaker) or drastically drop your health cause she spammed hipfire shots and got lucky.
---
The buff focuses on how she should be used. Flanking. She has better range so she doesnt need to get as close and she can more reliable 2 tap.

I'm just saying that trust factor isn't much better than r6 matchmaking and trust factor is pretty flawed. R6 matchmaking is better in most ways. Also think about queue time. It will take quite a long time. There isn't even a report for hacking in r6, only toxic. 
---
- Damage decreased to 65 (from 99).
---
- Adjustments to damage dropoff to align with other pistols for consistency.
---
- Reduced magazine size to 12 (from 15).
---
- Increased recoil to make chaining shots at long-range more challenging.
---
- Increased hipfire spread to reduce viability of spamming non-ADS shots.
---
The bigger issue are those who have stable internet, but random disconnections. I've had times where my router has decided to cease functioning mid match and I couldn't rejoin.
---
I'm all for punishing people who leave, but there needs to be a better system to differentiate.
---
This was captured on PS4 awhile ago, I remember a few of my clips using the app to cut up videos, did this them. Sucks but a cool clip to look back on.
---
PS4. I hate the boost. It's totally unnecessary and can overpower an operator
---
Make it so he doesn‚Äôt die from one shot head shots and they do the same amount of damage as body damage. He has that fatty helmet on his head.
---
Everyone forgets about the damage drop off. Her gun was only 99 damage at 1 meter. One thing I am interested to see is if this "nerf" makes her stronger at a distance. 
---
I'm a casual player, leave me alone, haha. I still don't know the layout of half the maps 
---
With her accurate hipfire she at close range wouldn't have to ADS so she could move at jog speed whilst still being accurate enough to hit you (considerably faster than ADS). I'm not sure but I think she also benefited from the extra speed from wielding a pistol.
---
Combine jog speed strafe with pistol speed increase and she is very fast.

Lesion is always a solid pick on defense (i.e. I never sit there and go I wish our lesion was anyone but him) and Hibana is a great pick for offense just realize her Bearing 9 got hit hard by the secondary smg nerf.
---
Under level 200, literal scrub.

Oh the typical "u triggered" reply - I love you too &lt;3

Idk if it's possible but maybe Ubi could somehow detect if you meant to leave vs lagging out or game crash but as I said idk.

You need a squad? I got some guys that play mostly for fun but are trying to increase rank.

Did you have a stroke writing this?

I prefer AR33 with holo I know it‚Äôs not great but it got me my first ace

Ash offend and rook defend

Waiting for the game to start is half the game, unfortunately

They are hidden away somewhere. Worst case scenario just shift f2 in game and by then from there. 
---
Go go power rangers my guy
---
Then who was the main character?
---
Yeah, but your given a white proximity, and his entire ethos is about not being seen
---
I was playing with a guy like this, he threatened me and my friend with DDosing if we left the game LMAO. I was fine with it when I know I shouldn't have
---
That's BM

Unless you ha e 4 recruits and he won't submit to the memes then the sacrifice must be made

Not really. Jager and bandit lost their ACOGs for basically the same reason rook and Doc should. But at least with bandit you have to be actively bandit tricking and with jager you need to take a good amount of time to set up, things rook and Doc don‚Äôt need to do. Ask your self, would u see rook and Doc as much if they lost their ACOGs in platinum and diamond. Nope. You wouldn‚Äôt. An ACOG on a consistent weapon is quite enough reason to pick an operator. Especially a defence one.
---
Clash is just there fucking smiling :)

That won't help - the issue here is that the server is being DOS, not any individual user.
---
It just would be a little weird to have the Huntress place down a Welcome Mat and not her signature bear trap
---
What platform do you play on?
---
I dont want this, i wouldnt mind the option for Custom games though. Reason for that is that you simply just wouldnt see some maps in play at all because people "dont like them". And you wouldnt learn new maps if you are a strictly ranked player like i am, cause nobody would vote for them to be player cause they dont know the map and the room names.

She's getting a buff but that was too cool so you get my upvote.

Hello croken717, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ago0s6/casual_matchmakingnot_broken_huh/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Well that's stupid, they'd all have a random chance of disconnecting.
---
iAppoh, im about mid gold
---
You can kinda see based on the upvotes that people clearly disagree with you. you are just far into denial by saying that people who disagree with you have invalid opinions because they have a rank you don't agree with. Your ignorance is pretty obvious here. We can all have our opinions but I think ubisoft made a good decision here. Instead of just accepting a difference of opinion you just ask for rank. You can remain toxic and salty all you want but if you're unhappy, just leave, nobody is gonna close the door on the way out, you're free to fuck off
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
It does mean something. If you are familiar with professional and high level play, ACOGs on defence are incredibly powerful. Sure if you took it away it would still be good, but not as versatile which is the point.
---
Using him for bandit or kaid is still pretty pointless considering thatcher is better for it 
---
Dude. Why did you teamkill? Did they kill you? Nope. Yeah it's a challenging game and most people aren't on par with your level or IQ but that doesn't just justify you to kill them for being stupid or voting members out. You need to hold on to your emotions. Even if i get TKed accidentally or intentionally being a platinum for the last 5 seasons, i simply just leave the match. Why? I don't wanna bite a mad dog back and you sir are just spreading toxicity. 
---
Completely correct!
---
I would but I don‚Äôt have a team...
---
I 100% agree my friends in silver/bronze have to deal with throwers who know they will not get banned for team damage so they just shoot everyone twice in the body with a pistol and get them low. So then the whole team has a combined 50 hp.
---
Haha that's a funny way to call out copper I laughed harder than I should have üòÇ
---
We have a very similar saying in english. Something like "Dont look a gift horse in the mouth". Love the figure though! 
---
Who said anything about 100 meters?
---
10 meters were fatal for caveira already.
---
Was that pun intentional? 
---
&gt;Great counters but not reliable for most of the community. Shes frustrating in casual where that stuff doesnt happen
---
And my argument is that that is the fault of the plater for not doing those things, not the character. That said,
---
&gt;Thats why she was reworked. It buffs her strengths and nerfs the unintended aspects of her.
---
I 100 percent agree with reworking cav. Her gameplay mechanics and ability just dont fit into siege very wellm not to mention she's only good in casual. I just never agreed with people crying op at cav for not knowing how to play against her. 
---
Lmao her new max range is 20 meters what the fuck are you talking about 
---
Yes silver copper and gold ranks doesnt matter their opinions on this game. They just bunch of rushers with 0 kills and mostly get interrigate. Ubisoft said they will only care plats dias and proleague. Well lets say we both dont know the game at all. Check proleague pick. They pick caveria 1-2 times. Because u can easily counter with dokkaebi blitz or lion or drones. But obviously silvers golds not communicating so yeah they whinning
---
Have you played overwatch? 
---
Or you could you know... not add to the problem..
---
Her pistol is literally designed for interrogations. What is the point of having long range on it if youre too far for an interrogation? 10 meters post-nerf is the same as 10 meters pre-nerf damage wise. If you dome someone with the pistol it DBNO's them. So why wouldnyou want to DBNO an enemy at a long range?
---
What?
---
It's not stupid, it slows everyone down to the point that they can't do anything, and if you're defending that's a win. 
---
So you just do it on defense rounds and boom
---
P R E S S
---
Seems like that‚Äôs something someone using mnk would say 
---
Lion is still bullshit OP.
---
He has no fucking counter.
---
Lions drone activates, then he pushes, you shoot and are then forced to move, and get killed through a wall.
---
I didn't say the player base I said new players. Lern 2 reed?
---
Honestly idk
---
They were removed because hackers abused the crap out of it, now you can only buy in-game. 
---
I agree with the spawns...
---
I still think it's ridiculous it took this long to Nerf that gun. I wonder if Ubisoft will ever get a game right on the first try. 
---
I see people say ela is one of the worst ops. She‚Äôs three speed, has an amazing gadget, good pistol, amazing shotgun, barbed wire, and her primary (on pc) is still insane. 
---
There is no 'max range', only damage drop off. What are you talking about? If range mattered on her pistol we would see caveira spawn peekers but we dont.
---
Clever guys.
---
[deleted]
---
Geez, what got you pissed about resetting?
---
Given its such a high risk high reward weapon, that is seldom used, I think an ACOG might be an okay benefit. The guns recoil will keep the weapon balanced. 
---
True if you can take control of East staircase and South balcony it makes it a bit easier to hold. But with a proper defenders setup and the crossfire from North window onto East stairs makes this site one of the more difficult sites to hold out of most maps. This is just me personally as I hate pushing balconies, that‚Äôs why skyscraper and top floor hereford is the bane of me ):
---
80% of new players if you can comprehend the difference 
---
now now let's not get caught up in semantics :P

Unfortunately I can't afford a gaming PC right now and all my friend are on PS4. Also can't build one literally (ZERO knowledge) I'm thinking of buying a pre-built one and start from there.

Yea I‚Äôm honestly okay with it but the reddit elite gold 4s will write paragraphs on why it shouldn‚Äôt happen.

That's Major Winters to you.

Lmao try csgo. But ranked is always better with at least a 3 stack. Try and find people in ranked that talk and are friendly and add them. Do this repeatedly and eventually you'll have a friend list full of people you can invite to play ranked with you.

Yea the joke dont act like you were joking kid lol

You know your too op when the fucking pro league removes you until the devs can fix your shit 
---
That‚Äôs still insanely broken as fuck and doesn‚Äôt address the reason why at all...
---
Thank you I appreciate that!
---
Not how they were originally but I little stronger than they are now
---
You... realize some people lack that choice right? Some ISPs are the only options. I had to have Comcast come and replace our router 3 times once in a month due to improprer set up.
---
And anecdotal evidence is anecdotal- some people have issues, some don't. Either way, you should not punish the player for something out of their control.
---
I mean if that recoil is crazy then you're definitely just a copper playing on console. And he's not even a 3 armour.
---
This holds very true even from just a peekers advantage perspective.
---
I still remember Jackal's gun not having any recoil for a few weeks. I had a blast. 
---
You truly think a tactical shield bash is lethal under normal circumstances?
---
You would have to knock the enemy down and clobber his head vertically to kill.
---
Has anyone ever opened a door into you? Have you been tackled? Unless you're made of glass you won't die. 
---
Ubisoft is the next R* Logic
---
Fortnite jokes 
---
So then why don‚Äôt they simply add MKB support and set aside servers for them so they don‚Äôt have to use the adapters to disguise their inputs?
---
Yeah and 99% just mashed punish regardless of any circumstances.
---
Hasn't it always?
---
I fucking feel you. Not only hacking but the general unplayable-ness of the current game. Constant glitches, the fact Client-Side Debris exists.

Sorry, I can't support this idea

It's a nerf to filthy casuals who actually use her and a buff for pro leaguers who don't. Basically.

Rappelling kills more than smoking now. 
---
No worries man! Hope it helps! Oh one last tip don‚Äôt do two doors in a row, after that first one they‚Äôll expect another right away and it‚Äôll be a waste of a trap! Also not sure what you play on but I‚Äôll be on tonight of ps if you have that and want more tips irl! Just add me if you want 
---
Also has the wa cog and a shit ton of bullets with a nice recoil.
---
I got a lucky kill of a cav like that once
---
Just wait. Stop complaining about useless buttons that you want implemented. Sorry that 45/30 seconds is too long for you.

No problem, thx for the feedback :D
---
I don't know? I've never seen it happening, so im pretty sure it isn't.
---
I do agree that the ranked system is bad atm, but I think that we don't need a plat 4 and a diamond 4-1. We could have more levels for diamond but I would only say a diamond 1 and 2. Also, the MMR difference is weird enough some people would not be as high. You would also have to change the way that you gain and lose MMR based on how well you do if you won or lost, and the number of kills you get in a match based on your enemy's MMR.
---
But Ubi has the power to allow MKB natively just raw through the USB ports and then separate them from other players. It seems like a no brainer.
---
Obviously triggered
---
Yeah. It always has.

AR33 with muzzle break, angled grip and acog.

Oh sweet I‚Äôm on the PS too! We should play some time! And yeah I always catch myself putting two traps on one door after another haha

SHOCKING**

His counter is actually Mute dead zones from his jammers. They make it so you can move around freely and not get tagged. I'll admit it's not the best "Counter" but it is a counter that I have personally used to my benefit.
---
Yeah, I honestly don‚Äôt know why some people roam with Doc, you can‚Äôt help your team that way
---
‚ÄúGet gud‚Äù says the guy who thinks Lion is completely fine. You must be low gold. Any 5 stack or team with any sort of coordination will stomp on you with Lion. He is **THE ONLY** operator banned from Pro League for a reason my guy.

BB still kinda OP. Even without his old God shield.

You see the problem is using a Ryzen. Just kidding, but you‚Äôll need to do a full RAM test and probably reinstall windows

"every other game is fine"
---
Siege just punishes players with packet loss more than others.
---
But sure, siege just ignores your shots exclusively and not your enemies. How convenient for them.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt cheat if you just allowed them to use MKB legitimately though.
---
You're missing the point so let me spell it out for you
---
Smurfing -&gt; bad
---
A functioning matchmakig system -&gt; good
---
By the way, this gives you more min &amp; max fps as well
---
Shoot the gun. Don't control recoil, just let it do it's thing. Then we'll talk. And my bad for not knowing every inch of the game like this toxic community does.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
I pretty much do the same thing with maestro now, his cams are pretty much useless if u ded
---
I could agree to that, however I looked at what if you just have one of the bad days and can't win a game, also saw some Siege YouTubers who did a copper do diamond run and most of them say there are a lot of good players in the lower rankings and don't deserve to be in the lower ranks, I had that in mind too...  
---
But them being in the lower levels could be more reasons, tk-ing, toxic players etc.  
---
However tnx for the feedback :D

I care far less about the bad words never really bothered me. I care a lot more about the cheating. This is just proof of how bad UBI's answer to both cheating and racism are lol.
---
You had one job
---
its casual, just suck it up. if you actually played it you might get good at it. 
---
Sweaty try hard do this, I‚Äôll maybe hit it one or twice but I think it‚Äôs a form of cheating imo. Just learn to flick to the lean spot and you‚Äôll be good 
---
Not the same dude. But I personally run his SMG reflex, comp, and foregrip and the PMM. Less ammo in the PMM than the other pistol but it‚Äôs a good bit stronger. 
---
For me having discord In a call just slices a third of my frames.
---
I normally get 144hz with vsync.
---
But when Im in a call it drops to 90-100.

Without vsync it would probably be higher so who knows how much of an impact discord has.
---
Ok, ty
---
Probably just the pic, it isnt the same green rl
---
Haha good, fuck Cav.

But how come we always play against plats and high gold? It's not even that we just don't notice when we have a plat on our team. We always check every profile

---
It was my favorite part
---
Zof
---
These are awesome. Where'd you get them?
---
That's true to an extent, Ela's pistol is generally a two shot kill and the smg is weak anyway. I at least never find myself wanting to smg over the pistol at all. The problem with Kapkan and Chanka is that their gadgets are not great so they help the team in practically no other way. As for the pump shotguns I'm not a huge fan except for making rotation holes.
---
Also it's important to note that something like 90% of gunfights are within 10 m. At that range most shotguns are viable, a few not really being viable until your within about 7 m.
---
But that was when her Scorpion was OP.  Now that her Scorpion is UP, maybe she can have her Impacts back
---
Congratulations your soy readings are off the scale
---
b
---
I'm fluid and open, if you tell me not to cover a place for a rotation I won't. I've learned there is great value in leaving things open.
---
True, it‚Äôs usually what I end up doing when I play but you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs definitely not ideal
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have been failed if I wasn‚Äôt considerate and understood he didn‚Äôt deserve a vote.  
---
We don‚Äôt deserve this quality _(:–∑„Äç‚à†)_

I think you‚Äôre missing the point. First it‚Äôs a extra mode changing nothing for you also making your ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù response moot. Next

This is something in the uncanny valley 
---
Lion. 100% Lion.
---
The only way to rework him is to COMPLETELY change how his drone works. 
---
Instead of a global, button-push ability, I‚Äôm thinking his drone be reworked so that it behaves similar to Echo‚Äôs Yokai. Instead of hovering above the map, Lion controls the drone directly and flies it around the map. This means that Lion will be totally vulnerable while using his drone. 
---
In addition to this, placing a limit on the range Lion‚Äôs scan reaches (possibly only a few rooms or a single floor) may help to balance Lion out. 
---
Making the drone destructible (like every other drone in the game) would be another good change. 
---
Even if the controllable drone change is not made, I think it would be completely reasonable for Ubi to allow defenders to jump outside and shoot down Lion‚Äôs drone. 
---
I‚Äôll check it out! 
---
the french shotgun is, but you better not miss. i sniped people across a hall with it. and of course kaid's
---
Rushing? Finka ash ying or blitz/lion
---
Destroys the game when you take it out. Harsher penalties combined with better tracking of team kills but also team damage. Make it so people can't just hurt all their team members every round. 
---
Lol you don't know how to use a shotgun then. I play shotgun on Mute exclusively, and I'm guaranteed a kill or 2 every round, with the occasional clutch or ace. And this was before they have him the smg.
---
Bro have fun getting run down by 10 of those winged demons after doing this ;)
---
most people ignore how usefull pistols are, when i run shotgun, i use pistols for distance and most of my headshots and peeks were with pistol rather then rifles
---
I know, I was joking, I'm just saying that because sometimes it seems we have more complaints than good things to say but we keep coming back

Any reason why lead to their toxicity? Is it a natural genetic disorder that possessed by majority of the Singaporean which will lead them to symptoms like Superiority Complex, depression, etc? I'm still confused why they're being so toxic, I mean for now there's multiple toxic people that I've met but at least they're still reasonable, example of reasonable ones like some of them are frustrated that the team is having some newbies and the newbies not doing their job nor objective, so it's understandable. But Singaporean?? I can't even understand why they're acting so... ridiculous?
---
Valk and drone, then it will be perfected.
---
She's an op that's supposed to rely on stealth and sneaking up on enemies, so why the heck every time you go dance with her 1on1 on a distance of 4 meters or less you just fucking die everytime because she just needs to hit you once?
---
That's gone now but she's more of a danger at a distance, so we'll see how much of a buff or nerf this really turns out to be.
---
Well to be fair the game is shit, but so was spiderman 3 and I liked that movie 
---
That is obvious and universal for all games with ranking system. But I doubt it'd make so many players leave so quickly. Most of them are used to trash players from lol or csgo so r6s wouldn't feel as unbalanced as it is. And seasons give chance to escape copper madness which is also a nice thing compared to csgo which makes everyone go through at least gold before haveing a decent matches.
---
I read and I did think. Her smg already got a buff before but got a nerf to the ADS. I don‚Äôt mind the damage or the recoil getting a buff bit when they make it fully automatic, that‚Äôs when it crosses the line.
---
Ummmmmmmm...
---
Same

Just got caveira, rip
---
Sorry for an off-topic question, how do I use a flair here? It says they are disabled but I see that most people have them. How do I get one?

Then im a horny rape demon 
---
The recoil is getting fixed here soon
---
Neither, they identity as a jeep.
---
?
---
To be fair, House is not in the ranked pool
---
The weapon also has a lot recoil now and her weapon is rly bad and isn't op now especially when she can't use it while she uses her gadget 
---
I could let the first time pass, on the second I was disappointed, but the third, he looked at hewr for like 2 seconds...
---
Um what?
---
Lately, the matchmaking server is only connecting me to ongoing games. 
---
I agree but I still need to two to three tap guys down a hallway so Im indifferent about this change
---
Yup. I guess i should have titled it Synch not sync. Something like that
---
I would say Lesion, because of his support role (may not seem like it, but he really is) and weapons. Just make sure to communicate so his role is effective  
---
And knife is down
---
Thoughts on "Lion is OP"
---
He isn't.
---
This is long for a reason, there's no TL;DR because it's too much to explain and I'd rather not have a bunch of people refute one small paragraph over and over without actually reading my exact points or details.
---
Please stop disliking because you simply think Lion is OP and you don‚Äôt bother to even read my thoughts on it. If you read this and still disagree, that‚Äôs perfectly fine and you‚Äôre free to downvote as you please, but don‚Äôt just assume it‚Äôs not going to say anything to change your mind and blindly downvote. I put some time into thinking this out and getting various opinions, I encourage you to do the same with your votes.
---
Also, as kind of a¬†disclaimer:¬†I have played both as and against Lion in Casual and Ranked in the TTS for quite a few times now, and I still hold these to be true. Obviously, things will be different once we're on base build, and even then, it's possible I haven't played as/with/against Lion enough to fully grasp his potential, good or bad.¬†I encourage you entirely to take everything I say with a grain of salt, and dedicate some time to find out your own opinions on Lion.
---
Feel free to disagree and debate on anything, and for simplicity's sake I'll just put some claims I've heard and provide my thoughts on them.
---
--"He has literal wallhacks, how is this not OP?"--¬†This is usually from the less-seasoned players (not that I'm very marinated myself). Obviously, yes, he can see through walls for your team, but for¬†two seconds.¬†Obviously in a close scenario, it could provide a big advantage, but that's his purpose. Having a Lion is a big benefit, but using it at the wrong time could be disastrous.
---
Also, it's entirely avoidable if you play right, in my opinion. Anchors have no reason to fear, and even roamers have their¬†three-second¬†warning to simply¬†stand still.¬†More on that in a bit, but it's not like he's just instantly seeing you for prolonged times with no way to avoid it. There are a lot of limitations on him as-is.
---
--"An attacker that forces you to return to objective? Absolutely not."--¬†Obviously this is only an issue if you're roaming or constantly moving within the objective, again anchors can enjoy themselves. If you're already in the objective and there's no immediate danger, you're fine as well, just use the¬†three-second¬†warning to stand still. Now if you're getting shot at, breached, etc., you probably have bigger problems than being spotted for two seconds, and that issue has already been well-underway.
---
It's like Dokkaebi's LBs, are you really worried about your phone going off when you're being fired at? Chances are they already know where you are, and if you're holding an angle against an opening or window or whatnot,¬†you're likely not going to be moving¬†and you won't be spotted.
---

What nerf? Haven't kept up that much with Siege lately

I've gotten vote kicked for getting team killed before. There are dumb, bad players everywhere. People don't think, they just click buttons.

I believe you 100%, but sometimes people will start reinforcing a hole that was obviously made intentionally for no good reason. I never understand what goes through their heads.
---
- 3 minute rounds
---
- Pick site on defense
---
- Pick spawn on attack
---
- Opt out of playing unranked maps (Favela, House, Tower...)

Wow look at that, now casual is worth playing.

Vigil is one of the stronger defenders. his guns (K1a and SMG-12 or CZ) are low recoil and good overall damage. his ability is like that to no make him over powered. his ability  has such a big radius that it is hard to pin point were he is IE different floor, different location in a room or hall. he is balanced as he is 
---
Damn... man, you sound like you know much stuff
---
I must upvote so I can feel I'm better than the average player on here
---
I think a counter that makes sense is ops like Cav and Vigil can‚Äôt be detected when they are using their abilities.
---
Hey Neel

There is no direct counter for maverick but he is EXTREMELY exposed when using his gadget.

in this case ‚Äòproper hands‚Äô means anyone capable of aiming at at enemy, blackbeard is not dead
---
Ah, yes. ["The lowest level of hell"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/aghkuc/caveiras_luison_changes_contextualized/)
---
Plat but okay. Shes not op but shes annoying like 99 damage is ridiculous ik its just a down but its a easy kill ive took out a whole squad in seconds its a bit silly. I think its a fair nerf and she had it coming
---
HOW COULD ANYBODY MISS THAT /s
---
Call me crazy, but I think this is a motherfucking JoJo reference
---
Yes. Everyone has as a matter of fact. 
---
Wish this game has some sort of charm or skin given through ubiclub to those who are veterans like in CS:GO.
---
The thing with castle is he is really good at high levels of play (when used right) but is terrible at low levels of play when no one knows how to use him. It‚Äôs difficult to find a buff for castle without making him way too over powered at high levels of play
---
Hi Donovan 
---
Yup! some randoms in a casual game showed me this a few months back
---
This. The dmg was so high on her pistol it took almost all skill out of it. Guys would just spam the trigger and odds are one shot was going to land in close quarters which would win every single gunfight.
---
I completely thought that large frame was Cav 
---
Uhhhh idk I never noticed before haha whoops
---
It teaches you to be more careful, that's how I learned too. Now you know you need to check windows and doorways while leaving spawn. Place claymores below windows if you want to rappel. Test the waters by fake-rappelling. Leave your setup phase drone looking at the spawnpeek they did last round, now you'll know if someone is trying to peek from there.
---
But where do I get my quality art if Shadman dies?
---
Yeah it's a nerf but the damage drop off is gonna be like other pistols instead of dropping off my the meter
---
This just sorta feels like you are adding a casual+ to the game. I fall into the competitive ranked category and I only play bomb as it is. Besides creating an additional mmr system to track, it feels like you are creating a ranked game mode that casual trolls will go to piss off some what serious players just because they won‚Äôt care about their ‚Äúclassic‚Äù rank.
---
Damn really? So I‚Äôm literally the only one in the entire siege player base who has never noticed? Dang. 
---
waht the fuck
---
&gt; Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo
---
So we can't talk about that 2nd picture ?
---
Sounds like theyre not real friends.
---
Jokes aside, i have to agree. Its not terribly hard to write some spy novel, or zombie book. But 1984 was such a different style, setting, and idea. Something so, possible at that.
---
I do fear an orwellian future aswell, seeing them removing confederate statues in New Orleans. Censoring history doesnt mean it didnt happen. 
---
I could really go on and on about the book and my thoughts. But im not gonna create a wall of text. I fucking love the book. One of the few required readings I enjoyed back in highschool.
---
3D printing is really cool. I printed tachanka‚Äôs helmet in my pre-engineering class
---
They could just be smart and make mute and vigil hard counters for him that when his gadget activates it doesn't see them as they have devices on them to prevent it. You could even make up some bullshit about how mute saw vigil utilizing his cloaking ability and adapted one of his jammers to be portable on him at all times and it could be a nice buff to mute in that he has passive jamming around his location at all times. 
---
Let me rephrase. The only players that count have noticed. 
---
Attacking game servers is nothing new, it was happenining in COD years ago. 
---
I‚Äôve never understood why a game was forgiving on its players like this. Like the way you describe, a team- or individual killing a team mate. Why is rainbow or any other game for that sake, so forgiven to this. I know they shouldn‚Äôt perm ban people for it, but theoretically, why not take it to the extremes?
---
Here I envy the watch thingy system of CS:GO, where people of certain playtime, rank and behavior can judge others. If you‚Äôre deemed unfit for a game, ban them for an extended period (Like 10 days).
---
Make ban times on team killing extremely high and implement it for casual as well. Make a forgive option as you mention, and make a repeat ‚Äòtemp‚Äô ban. So if you kill, let‚Äôs say 10 people within a week or the ‚Äòwatch thingy‚Äô players deem you unfit, you‚Äôll get banned for 10-15 days.
---
For multiple occasions, a perm ban is issued, like repeated temp bans.
---
For throws you should be able to report here, again to the watch thingy panel. They can easily spot if the other players are standing still or not shooting, and when it‚Äôs simply a bad player or a player off his game, trying to play.
---
Haha nice! I must have just drowned it out every time and never really listened.
---
Off*
---
Lmao. You really got me there pal!
---
yeah its real, i think like the first one was on gameboy color. i almost got it like a year after it came out but my gameboy died after i dropped it onto a parking garage floor. good times
---
Oof. Ubisoft community soft capped my post....
---
Yes, very good idea, thank you.
---
Well for an individual it makes sense. But if you implement it as a game mode you could end up in situations where you have no hard breach and the op for has closed the site completely.
---
I agree. It wasn‚Äôt even a required reading for me, at least not technically, as I chose it for a book review in 8th grade.
---
But yeah, it‚Äôs pretty difficult to listen to these people talk about how the absolute snore of a book that was The Book Thief was well written while 1984 was shit. WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD FAMILY
---
I like killing with it, realistically nobody expects to be killed by it. Should rename it to "Inquisition".
---
Well brb imma go play it
---
Wish people would understand that when I tell him. People hate him for keeping them out of certain areas, or my favorite, his gun. 
---
But adds to the thrill.
---
[Not even much of a nerf](http://reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/aghkuc/caveiras_luison_changes_contextualized/)
---
So add an extra button for a feature that‚Äôs already in game?
---
I'd say the 590 is certainly capable of this. What operator were you playing? Did you have Rook armour or a Finka boost active?
---
I understand this point but if this were the case, why give her the LMG? It has such higher ammo and dmg plus the ability makes it OP
