thats true, but knowing me i wont know whats happening until after i have no more charges left XD
---
---
---
You can surrender when round 3 starts. 2/3 needs to accept the surrendering.
---
can someone explain to me why that works, like ive seen youtubers hold it out and for some reason people don't see you. i just wanna know like why?
---
Me too, but this is a problem of the icons
---
It's just the fov. It also makes it look like you run faster and hallways seem longer etc. Same with any throwable gadgets it looks like it's thrown far but it's not
---
This image makes me nauseous
---
At least make t so if you have either the uniform or headgear of the rainbow is magic event equipped it would give you the rainbow drone
---
I only run reflex because the red dot, holo, and ACOG are all red and blend in with everything
---
Are those supposed to be deagles?
---
My fav is a 6k as fuze. Hostage included
---
If the sight isn’t a big deal for you, the F90 is the play, less recoil and more fire rate.
---
What in the...

the original video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmMBvAGswBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmMBvAGswBQ)
---
i havent tried to do the walking forward and then throwing thing, but that doesnt account for the fact that from a stationary position ive seen them be thrown farther on pc. 
---

---
Ive stood with my back against a wall on my friends pc version and thrown a c4 and did the same on my console an the c4 just didnt go as far, its not a matter of it looking like it did because the ping distance marker is consistant between pc and console.
---
Beautiful

&gt;useless

Lmao nice try
---
Thatcher lookin straight outta the cone-head films
---
How goods Mavericks gun?
---
I think blitz has taken too many nerfs. In order to buff him we should remove blackbeards primaries
---
Ok
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Ive stood with my back against the same wall in both PC and console versions of the game and thrown a C4 at like a 45 degree angle and they landed at two different distances. Thats not just it looking like its going further, it IS going further.
---
*the enemy have eyes on the bomb*
---
That's not the shotguns fault. You shot like 1 shell where the centre of the spread was anywhere near his chest.
---
I'm gonna vomit
---
F
---
*general thatcherobi*
---
&gt; **Almost** all of the times I could just do that without being killed
---
lmao... so you mean it happened some of the time? 
---
dude, there's no way around this in a multiplayer game. it's not possible for the server and the users to always have the same data.
---
Not at all the only person
---
Are you really a fuse main if you don’t kill a teammate as well
---
there is a button called "add all" . Click on it
---
Ok thanks man
---
Omg this
---
I'm pretty sure ubi said that it happens in real life, but I think they just isn't other to fix it
---
Yeah but they're crap, video feed is mostly just a black screen.
---
Unpopular opinion here. I have been using the red doot for the majority of the season. It definitely does not deserve all the hate it gets.
---
Feels bad man
---
Fookin lasa soights
---
Prime example of why I stopped playing this game
---
I'm watching it now. I love it!
---
Will I ever get the compete all challenges achievement?
---
I mean they still lose a player but it’s annoying when you don’t get credit for a kill you deserve, I mean you would be annoyed to if you lost a bunch of kill credit
---
We need a rule against "LoOk At My AcE" posts. Theyre fucking annoying.
---
a skilled Jackel main is a nightmare for roamers or anyone that has moved off site.  Id like to see him to only be able to track the footprints themselves.  Not be able to ping you through walls and floors.
---
would improve his pick rate and reduce his ban rate.
---
What the other person said. No please delete this.
---
my Alt has Ash, Doc, Jager and Twitch only......
---
yeah but why shouldn’t you get kill credit? I think if you get the knock and start to intero you should get kill credit too because why wouldn’t you?
---
Unmanned blades
---
I would cry
---
Go in csgo do a, 360 then check how much your mouse moved maybe 15cm go in siege do 360 drop%increase until its same distance moved with your mouse
---
Rook, Fuze, bandit, frost, finka and zofia
---
All legendary packs are pretty ugly, I would love if I got 6000 for a duplicate
---
agreed. you deserve the kill. but there is too many ways to abuse a server, and the kill would most likely be client side, and thats the easiest way to abuse a server
---
But I want my random ranked teammates to hear my music.
---
[removed]
---
It was to fix crouch and lean spam. But I'm with you on this one.
---
They are bought with R6 credits now, so even if they come out to being the same price instead of paying $16 directly to get them I had to by a $20 R6 credit bundle to have enough.
---
Yes,  you're safe, I do this but with YouTube on my second monitor, and it's fine
---
that game's balance still haunts my nightmares.
---
Hey man, I’m a consistent gold player, I have the ability to get to play if I actually wanted to, I just don’t care enough. I usually duo queue with my friend that’s a plat. I’m on NA east servers too
---
Well flat is justice after all
---
How does the system work?
---
nah, if it isnt 13th century mongol war chants, its garbage /s
---
That "legendary" is just a recoloured headgear from a bundle, not to mention its disgusting. And yes, duplicate legendaries should be disabled.
---
Fair point though. This jackal headgear is so bad
---
And the previous ones were $20 to
---
Yea sorry man, I’m looking for diamonds/good players or people who are gonna try, again sorry but no thanks
---
You clipped these?
---
I will personally visit Ubisoft studios and kiss every single on of them if they make an OwO skin for my drone
---
Thats what unranked and casual is for. If not just practice ur aim for a while in thunt and watch vods of pro league to train your game sense. And trust me, its not easy to get good. You just have to put a LOT of time into siege. The learning curve is so steep that it takes at the very least one full operation for someone to start getting to silver.
---
Basically you can watch highlights from previous games, so for example if you get a triple kill it'd record it, save it and allow you to watch it after the game. I'm not sure what else it does since I've not played overwatch in a while
---
Exactly I got the worst legendary twice in a row. I should just stop playing siege if my luck is that bad😅.
---
I paid $15.99 for the bundles for the last 3 seasons.
---
Really? Here I was thinking you were meant to rush in. Thanks for this, I’ll be taking my time from now on.
---
So fuck everyone who doesn't want to drown in their own sweat?
---
UBI PLZ
---
We will be getting them.
---
Well that's simple
---
Typing out callouts is completely useless, I meant to say voice chat
---
And if she step on C4 wouldn't/couldn't fly far.
---
You thought you were supposed to shoot the person tied up? This is hilarious.
---
My friend bought the game a month ago and he literally only has BB, Monty, and Jager and I'm pretty proud of him :)
---
I just got plat 3 for the first time ever a few days ago as well! I was super pumped, as the game in which I got it we were tied 4-4 at overtime match point, and it was a 1v5. I was playing Nokk (going deagle only) and naturally the first 3 kills I got were cocky people who I just picked off. The last 2 I had to rush objective, and got the final kill with 2 seconds left. I personally, have never felt more deserving of something in my life. Even got a friend request from everyone on both team.
---
It's made up of ear, eye, and head protection all together.

Old jackal i could see but new nerfed jackal good luck . Ever time i get tracked i end up baiting the jackal to his death .
---
Barracade skins?
---
No you have to be calm and try to figure out where he tracked you from. Then you hunt him.
---
Reinforcing between obj/a recently opened rotation hole
---
Farmer?
---
Careful, if sweaty diamonds here you say Jackal good they’ll jump down your throat and scream at you
---
Dude #3 happens ALL THE TIME for me!
---
Thats old
---
There was a perk like this in cod4. Didnt work out too well
---
No
---
Plat was fun for a but but then I found it wasn’t that fun when everyone was yelling and trying to win more than trying to have fun... high silver-gold is where it’s at. Can have fun if you want and play strats also.
---
yep...they're gonna keep doing it because some people don't care and buy them all, so the rest of us are stuck with this shit system
---
I tried that it dosent work anymore
---
I hate those as well. It makes my job a lot harder
---
I have a legendary dogs charm
---
becomed moe greedy!
---
can confirm, i was the objective
---
As a Cav main that hurts my soul. I think she’s strong if people get lazy. Honestly if you are a decent droner she’s not that bad but I get why you’d ban her
---
During operation Chimera, you get all the base ops and attachments so if he started playing after then he might not get them for free
---
What?
---
Like your mom
---
Stupid-smart is still smart! Yall have C-17s parked accross from our planes and there are never any maintainers on them. Those guys work a 7-3 schedule. We get there before them and they are gone when we leave. Amazing lol
---
Only neon, no camo drone skins please!
---
L8, it’s useful for longer distance kills, I cannot tell you the many aces I got with this thing
---
Oof calm down cowboy
---
Spawn peeking is part of the game.
---
It fucking sucks
---
I've had this issue before. I'll think I'll have the drop on them but in reality they're lining a shot up on me and kill me. I've had my team mates watching me play and see the same thing.
---
😄
---
That escalated quickly lol
---
Yeah but it’s annoying as hell.
---
Like i would just join a game, aaand gone
---
Your hairline is so small I can't see it
---
Instant karma.
---
No u
---
Is this Bad Company 3?
---
u/GirthamKnight That was clean
---
Does this happen to you an any other games? I swear this happens in every FPS I play including siege I’m watching a doorway or holding an angle the EXACT moment I look away they burst in. It drives me nuts sometimes. Nice angle though
---
Sound in the game is really important so like someone said before; have a good headset and listen closely for enemies. They can be really sneaky sometimes.
---
Yeah but the majority of the playerbase aren't ok with it.
---
SAY WHAT AGAIN MOTHAFUCKA I DARE YOU
---
This is sarcasm.
---
However... I have no clue if what I said is actually true.
---
I would love that
---
Let us not talk about what that suppressor looks like ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Thanks, i had the same question too
---
I took a break after Maestro and Alibi came out, what’s that red rank past diamond?
---
Yes, ok, but would you really take competitive an fps on a console, where you have such a slow movement? I'm sure at 100% that fps competitive shouldn't be a thing on console, since it takes a lot for a game due to the difficulties.
---
Yeah that’s a fat rip. Not even sure wtf would cause it.
---
Prone strat. Only people that know skippyFX remember
---
go find a community discord for siege and find people of a similar rank..
---
Last I played was when lion was released. How have things changed for him?
---
Oh god it would’ve been perfect as tower lmfao
---
He’s easy to bait 1v1 but the whole teams knows where you’re at. Plus I’d ban him for the same reasons Twitch and Ash get banned, he has a fantastic loadout
---
stop trying to free it
---
Honestly people read way too far into these things. It's just part of the outside of the map you're in because your camera clipped out right before the action phase. It's nothing special, it's not hinting to anything
---
Oh god please no
---
Vigils balls have the power to resurrect lmfao
---
You don't have any friends do you bud?
---
Congratulations amigo
---
Rank baiting in this game is awful this change is the best thing they have made in a long time
---
Yeah people get mad at me for it lol
---
Anything that can have a suppressor will get one if it's me who's playing
---
wow always gotta call out that it’s copper
---
&gt;Oh shit some idiot on reddit is mad at me and thinks i don’t “belong” in this shitty community and if I’m being honest here there is a massive skill gap between this so called community where the ignorant people rain supreme and the few people that are decent/good opinions get drowned out by the idiots that think spawnpeeking is bad and a casual game actually matters its almost laughable how how quick this shitty community turned around it went from a fun place were some good natured casual trolling wasn’t looked down upon and you wouldn’t get massed downvoted for saying something this pathetic community doesn’t like and if any of you idiots decided who should be in this community then there would only be coppers this is my spawnpeeking account and it just proves my point if you look at the comments in some of my posts u/TheR6Spawnpeeker
---
1. reign
---
2. it's
---
3. mass
---
4. commas, use them
---
5. periods, use them. 
---
6. apostrophes, use them.
---
7. You're toxic and annoying and childish.
---
8. Uninstall.
---
9. no one cares about your stupid "spawnpeeking account", whatever that is.
---
You right lol
---
speed if often part of na ops balancing, though it does not always work. Monty is slow but still ridiculously overpowered. 
---
Peeker's advantage still happens when you are a 1 speed but it is less prevalent. Even if you are a 3 armor and you peek a 1 armor, you should have an advantage in the gunfight, if you die in that case, you are probably not very good.
---
How
---
Where would you see something like this clubhouse? I thought the same and looked around. No near buildings could have looked like this
---
if you're from texas, thermite is from plano
---
I used it as a example of how the siege community is full of hypocrites bitching about toxicity but they are perfectly fine with witch hunting someone for spawnpeeking
---
I've placed either g1 or p3 4-5 times in a row, can only imagine what elo hell is like at the lower ranks.
---
Defenders have impacts, C4, and more shotguns, as well as more time to make holes. This is unnecessary
---
I mean you called me bud so are we friends?
---
That’s a real feelsbadman
---
I'm from Frisco. Right next to Plano.
---
A watermark that isn't the poster's, and impact font? 
---
We got ourselves a doozy
---
do both, if you're good enough you'll hit it
---
Good idea, take the screenshot now before you end up crashing down back to silver, best of luck my friend.
---
Fitting title to the end there “heartbreaking defeat” lol
---
Lead restrictions?? Where? I have boxes of shells at home loaded with lead shot.
---
Don’t the situations always make thatcher use the A33?
---
A world where you’re on defense
---
How many hours?
---
Which ones?
---
Champions. AKA the mouse/keyboard + DDOS section of the game
---
Go to subreddit page and click the three dots and edit flair. It should be there
---
yeah, people at higher elo's play to win. if you want to just play for fun hit up unranked
---
It just makes sense to have this as background art just to be a filler in that sort of map. If it was on Tower or Outback or something then I would be confused
---
i mean im playing on high plat tier since health and im sure peoples wont react like that goyo and valk .  
---
 they wont stand and watch you for 2 minutes while missing every shot , that valk was hitting the air the whole time , not to mention that goyo lmao crawling on the ground like a worm and missing his every shot . guess it was my bad this must be a champion tier its so
---
Gun nerds would be so mad.
---
Well then damn
---
CONGRATS!! you’re officially within the 37% group
---
Congrats! Getting out of gold is super hard but I hope it's only up from here!!
---
You are breathtaking!
---
I remember these i wanted then to look me in the eyes then i killed them
---
YESSSSSSSSSS
---
I’m assuming a navy and a turquoise?
---
How long have you been playing Seige?  
---
\- Since release
---
What is/are your favorite moment(s)?  
---
\- First Ace
---
What is/are your worst moment(s)?  
---
\- Getting kicked out of the match straight after joining
---
Do you have anything interesting/funny/unique that has happened to you while playing?  
---
\- I got to know some good people
---
What even is sound in this game I thought he was coming from behind u
---
Image you could hear
---
That’s a big yikes
---
very true. but i have a idea, so the left pause button (button to check leaderboard) is the new talk to speak button. if you hit the pause button once, it shows what it normally shows, but if you hold down the pause button, it shows the learderboard
---
Solo que is so annoying. I got placed at koper 2 went to silver 4 and now I’m stuck on bronze 3 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Well yeah, heavies are the fuckin easiest maintenance job there ever was. I'm on F15Es, and we break after every single flight.
---
*with pleasure*
---
I’m better then my friend, he got carried to Plat 2 while im bronze 2... I hate the fucking matchmaking so much
---
you are the one true god now.
---
7 seconds to plant, but remember, if Finka's gadget is activated, it'll be faster. 5 seconds I think, but I'm not sure

U n00b

I second that

Holy tactics batman

“I’m over here”
---
Once i tried to open a wall witb a nitro cell for some reason, so i threw it on. Then a teamate just threw a nade right next to me and ran through. I wasnt hurt but i figured id pick up the cell and use it later. So i walked up, read on the screen "Press F to pick up", and promptly pressed "G". Ive never left a game so quickly in my life.
---
yes but i actually want them to keep it, its pretty damn funny imo
---
it's already nerfed to dust...you are just smart bruh
---
If I play against a team that really impressed me with how tight they execute their strats: I’ll message the top fragger and thank them for showing me such a good game.
---
Anyone else read this in the Videogamedunkey voice?
---
What’s that charm?
---
😂
---
Are we going to see more in the future tho?
---
Flair name is long but you get the joke .
---
Plat charm from Burnt Horizon
---
“DIE MOTHERFUCKER DIE” repeat.
---
Yeah the hundred other people who did the same exact thing before you.
---
K
---
Thank you for your service, sir!
---
Overwatch does this and it works great
---
The best is when you drop what you're doing to help and then they just don't mention the pulse sitting in the same room as them.
---
Let's be honest, jackal is wall hacks.
---
I have a clip on plane doing the same thing clutching two rounds with that shotty. It's actually too good 👍
---
This comment is better than the meme itself.
---
Because the sight body itself is still the largest in the game
---
You'll keep saying that until Tachanka clutches the round that gets you promoted in ranked.
---
Only then will you truly begin to know God.
---
close, but not there yet
---
You most likely got it and just havent found it, which sucks cause its just so much to look through lol. 
---
Could be specific shotgun you never use or some random ass skin for x operator.
---
This isnt even the worst round for them. Ranked silver 1 ones. I got gold 3 after this.
---
No one says that
---
[looks like a standard shoulder/neck shot not a headshot.](https://imgur.com/a/FiPiXcr)

This is fine,

4 stacks tking the solo in the team had to end.

Behind the bar? Those are like carpet mats or whatever lol I always think so too at quick glance. They look oddly close to frost mat
---
Snipin's a good job, mate
---
They added more penalties, its temporarily disabled until they get a handle on the DDoS issue.
---
Yess
---
Yea those, i was like "wth why isnt anyone getting trapped
---
I mean the 12yos in this forum LOVE the stale meme.
---

---
I don’t understand that reference
---
Then you lack any game knowlege

The Lord does not approve of this message
---
Plot twist.... Thatcher is actually a chemist
---
Shopping mall would be cool. Could have heaps of paths. But I’d make it two story max with a roof.
---
Imagine how epic a shoot out in a cinema would be chairs plus the angles would make for interesting and fun fights.
---
For operators a version of thermite that could breach floors making a movable whole but can’t breach stuff that’s is reinforced.  Whilst a defender op that can counter it with like reinforcement that covers larger areas and can be used on any floor and walls.
---
🤣🤣
---
but they need to do something about it
---
If you play casual, Jackal. If you play Ranked, Hibana because Jackal is the first ban 95% of the time. Both of their gadgets are amazing, but Jackals C7E is better.
---
Quit matchmaking and retry, it works for me
---
I agree with what you say but with the last updates on console the game crashes more and it happened to me to lose a 4-0 ranked it would be even worst if after crashing you couldn't play for a week
---
It is a joke about 9/11. A terrorist attack on the world trade center in New York and the pentagon. r/whoosh
---
people here do that all the time, so I assume "yes"!

Aww haww that's hot

I really like how doki looks, and cav too

Its seasonal,you can buy it right now

Ironically  I got my first black ice ever (even tho im like lvl100), the mp5

Nice, you even put the suicide-bomber in it!

Yet they probably wouldn’t know either, they are most likely accustomed to the stereo typical “Australian” accent that Australians don’t actually have. It’s a lot more slang-like and honestly doesn’t sound like it at all, trust me I know

downvote for not reviving your teammate after winning the game

Why stop a good thing comrade

Rip I got her 9mm black ice after grinding for 4+ hours lmao

There’s rumor of a huge mmr rollback but honestly i doubt they’d do that lol. Report them to Ubisoft support with proof you were dossed and not just trying to get free elo and they should be able to help.

Agreed. To each his own. If it works, it works.

Very good
---
It's not even really about the skins (although I've been playing for like 2 years and just got my first black ice, gotta admit, my son and I spazzed) it's more about me having the self control of my child.
---
You literally just remember where you've been and deduce his location. Then you watch the timer and make sure you're in one spot the moment it pings and anywhere else the entire rest of the time. He or his teammate nearly always get tunnel vision on the ping and will only shoot there. So when they attempt to wallbang or enter the room they give away their position and give you a window to aggressively counter attack.
---
True, I only use that. Btw Nomads ARX has the same Irons like the MP7.
---
From top left to bottom right, it goes Ash, Pulse, Thermite, Valkyrie (no headgear), Twitch (Elite), Hibana (Elite,) Bandit (Elite), IQ (Elite), Glaz (Elite), Finka, Zofia, Ela, Jackal, Mira (Elite), Capitao, Caveira, Buck, Frost, Maestro, Alibi, Nomad, Kaid, Ying, Dokkaebi, Thatcher (Elite), Nøkk (based off of Ubisoft's concept art), Gridlock, Warden.

This is because shields collapse now if you get on top of them to prevent using them to get in spots you aren't supposed to be. That used to be a big issue or thing with them until they changed it some seasons ago.
---
How do you get that gold camo?
---
If you're in a team with good communication Clash is much more potent then Cav, but Cav is a lot easier to slide in when playing with people who aren't communicating much or when you don't feel like communicating yourself.
---
*spoopy
---
I gotchu' homie!
---
General Grievous, you are shorter than I expected.
---
That’s not thatcher, that’s Trevor. Nice try
---
Look at this bs... first shot whiffed ik...
---
The speed he snaps around at after the mat sets off is just comical
---
Warden
---
Okay I’ll try that. Thanks, it’s in the options yeah?
---
Love you 2
---
Good guess, if you guessed BB, but it is Bandit. Blackbeard has more... rectangular sunglasses.
---
These days he's alright, it used to last twice as long as it does now and give an outline when you moved for extra spiciness.
---
Ye they tried to hard to do it
---
UwU
---
no offense, but i doubt this is your first week lmao
---
I'll do a part 2 soon, but I'll make sure to but Lion as far away from Doc. ;)
---
Of course. I got to do Blackbeard, Goyo, Amaru, Mozzie, and plenty of others too.
---
It's more like you use it when you know where they are so when you're approaching them you can see where they move to.
---
I’m also curious.
---
It's not about liking and more about the reality of the matter, the first year it was funny and now it's stale, the only ones keeping the meme alive are pretty much kids who think it's still funny for some reason.
---
C7E and PDW9 have the same ADS time. For some reason they gave the C7E the standard SMG ADS time rather than the AR ADS time.
---
Aaa  bu ne lan hahahabana
---
Thx this is very helpful
---
And i'll stick to my p90 silencer Laserpointer without any scope, no need to aim with this bad boy
---
I’d had fun thanks, and so did they
---
Keep in mind you can’t see the messages after and the voice chat, if I’d of known what they were doing I’d of happily joined in but I didn’t, and so I took a shield op
---
Now kindly shut the holy fuck up
---
Lvl 130 no black ice here
---
Fuel, metal oxide, and metal powder can't melt steel beams
---
cav is almost never a good ban from gold 3 and up. she's almost as useless of a ban as blitz if you know how to communicate and drone properly
---
860 vs 980. 
---
122/184/184 vs 140/140/204. 
---
.....
---
Yeah føkk you right my bad. F2 still wins. Difference is barely anything and even at 184 nobody can beat you.
---
i dont think so because it would usually show the glitching effect if nokk does any animations. and only sounds like thermite jumps in.
---
yeah better than the 266th charm I won't use
---
Thanks
---
Which helmet?
---
What I *believe* happened here was his shots made the shield move enough to either:
---
A: Make your head hitbox go through the shield slightly, but enough for a shot to register.
---
OR 
---
B: It moved enough to expose the tip of your head and he hit that.
---
Not sure which but it is likely one of these two.
---

Youre brave for going after the last guy with a single shot left

What's the joke? Your twitch drone baited him out and caused him to die, it did actually do good, while the commentor is saying they're no good on console.
---
OP and some other person got mad at me for doing the "TyPiNg lIkE tHis" meme, so this doesn't surprise me at all. Or he's just having a bad day and banter ain't his cup of tea.

My friends and I like to do strat roulette and randoms usually join in if they understand what we are doing.  Obviously we don't teamkill or kick if they wont.

Items that you would have been able to buy with renown are now locked behind a paywall. Then it requires you to grind for items you have already bought. This is ontop of it being a paid game with season passes that have less value than before and overpriced time limited packs. It's acting like it's f2p when it's not.
---
You should have typed “where are they” before knifing her.

Is that a new feature?

Can you even control twitches recoil with that sense? Or were you just tired and moving kinda slow in that clip?

Instant uninstall
---
Don't cross an entire room holding on your c4. You can swap to primary or secondary weapon even after holding to the c4. (How can you defend yourself with that? Throwing a c4 is slower than bullets)
---
It's not like a frag grenade that you can cook. And even with grenades you have to be wary as if you get killed and allies are nearby you can kill them too.
---
I know but it has never taken this long usually about 3-5 min the most but now its 10-40 min
---
1 impact 1,500 points
---
What this clip doesnt show is the 99/100 times you'll just end up hitting the metal bars and not get lucky to kill anything
---
U sure u didn’t just get the ice skin and not black ice?
---
It's so bad because they will go off to one person
---
Intel is one of the strongest weapon in the game, second only to tachanka himself
---
Yeah you can. It's weird to do though. You have to  go set up a custom game and then in the settings for that custom game you can change the server somewhere. Save the custom game and go back to the menu and it should be changed
---
Either bots or purely skill
---
Lesion is definitely not perma banned in ranked. I’d say he’s about the fifth most banned defender and the top three(Echo, Mira, Clash) are banned far more often than fourth(Caveira) and fifth(Lesion).  These are all my estimations from my experience of course, but the top three are top three by a mile.
---
Blood for the blood god
---
Thanks bro I appreciate it, I'll try it now.
---
Where do you find that Fuze keychain?
---
What they need to do is give him his omg as a primary and just give him a bipod that he can mount
---
Thats what she said
---
No worries.
---
I've  had solo q times if 59:59 before, some almost instant it's just taking a white to find 4 others
---
I would never be patient enough to use my echo drone like that
---
There’s 16 claymore there, so it’s 160 points
---
try getting 3 drones with all three pests, and having your team mate shoot all three when you decide to use them.
---
But sadly will have the same weapons as other ops
---
I feel that they have too many playlists up at the moment
---
Maybe check their level? They might've not known how mozzie works.
---
eh about the size of a 767

[Red dot frost is best frost.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab5y_xnjfzc)

I think it’s a pretty strong strategy, you’ll either have to shoot it, stopping you from entering and alerting defenders, or jump on it
---
_Deploying cluster charge_
---
10-9 seconds actually
---
Can you try fuze? I would love that
---
They gonna be tech scammers
---
The game has been ruined since the bomb only ranked tbh. 8y kitchen enjoyable any more
---
you should draw valkyrie and sledges elite skin together.

What is inside Smoke's gas grenade?

Vector and m870 have same ones

                          DAMN!
---
Why weren't you first in?!
---
i would 100% buy this from you. it is SO good
---
I like it, but damn if the fmg-9 doesnt feel smooth as all hell man Idk what does
---
Ubi getting super lazy and just release one operator that can be used on both attack and defence
---
Just play unranked. Your proposal here would be awful if you aren’t a five stack every game. Four stack with three diamonds and a silver then that’s really gonna suck for your random fifth diamond having to play with a silver teammate up against five diamonds.
---
Something like this where you’re only allowed to search with more than 1,000 MMR difference when you’re a five stack would be fine I guess, but I don’t think there’s gonna be a big demand for it especially when people could just play unranked with their friends that are a far lower or higher skill level instead of having to put themselves at a huge disadvantage in ranked.
---
Wait plane? WTF?
---
I'll get it, but it'll go unused like the other 120ish charms I never use
---
i main echo and when hes banned i use your main for the headshot machine she has haha
---
It is needed because that would absolutely suck for your random teammates.
---
“He is actually hacking” lol

Not balancing wise though...
---
100% guys. I'm not biased at all....
---
I really wish youre right... If they do that I woyldnt have nothing agaisnt the battle pass
---
Anyway, I just cry like a baby cause whatever ends happening I will buy the Battle Pass in the day of release xD
---
You lucky duck.
---
They aren't waiting to nerf Blitz to fix his bugs lol. Shields just always have a new bug every patch.
---
Welcome to the club, buddy... Welcome to the club lol.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
We were going pretty crazy
---
I call bullshit, OBVIOUSLY fake as none of your teammates gave the play away by marking on your drone repeatedly...
---
*^don't think I need to but here's the ^/s
---
Thats my problem, i never land mine._. Even in rainbow, not just rl
---
Gee thanks
---
Sudden Korilakkuma!
---
Sounds like a great time
---
Because they can, get a group of buddies instead of solo queueing if you want everyone to have mics
---
Why you ban echo
---
Cava current interrogation ability uncovers all enemy positions.  Hypothetically nokk can now “interrogate” but instead of a team wide reveal, it only reveals the person closest to the objective or closest to her. Again this is just speculation
---
Edit the title to say look at my ace
---
If you’re better than me you are clearly hacking.
---
Nice fidget spinner. Jk, keep it up brother!
---
They weren't ready
---
Please stop banning Clash, my clashmain ass is already useless when I have my op :(
---
It's so funny how different the game looks at lower ranks. It's like a different game altogether.
---
Yeah but how do you put multiple ops in the flair?
---
checked for loss?
---
I'll give this one to you... It looks like it. I didn't realise until now (:
---
Satanic gathering be like
---
As a child a group of boys thought it would be fun to try to drown her. After surviving the incident she took on a new look of the world and pushed herself to persevere through hardships. And that's basically it, just she survived a drowning incident then pushed herself to be able to protect herself. Dunno why she has this out of all characters, but that's it.
---
“A left click gone right”
---
Its nice. My brother just purchased the game on console so its been refreshing to play against some lowwer ranks
---
Killcams are not accurate.
---
Do you have videos of your shots not registering?
---
Ouch
---
Play on PC. SEA servers on PC have a very healthy userbase.
---
Try to click the normal operators icons
---
u/youre_a_degenerate Your move ;)
---
Lol you seem like a siege player
---
Trophy? U mean achievement? Also yes, playing in any online mode will unlock achievements
---
We really need the mr bear mode back :(
---
What's in the canister?
---
I doubt ranked is ruined for people just because they have to play bomb. Making you play bomb literally switched up the whole game for you. How can you possibly say it made it boring when it made you have to do things differently? Made you stop doing the same things over and over?
---
Try pinging the google ip address or dns in your command prompt. I think that it is 8.8.8.8 or 4.4.8.8   
---
Type “ping -t 4.4.8.8” and see if you get random humps in ping
---
I legit never run into toxic people like that
---
Happy to help.
---
If we talk about it deeper, yes, they do different things, but the boundary is too vague, they all push the enemy out.
---
It’s sneaky time
---
100% wouldnt smash *NOT THICC ENOUGH*
---
That's what he was asking, arsole
---
Never heard of someone banning their own main
---
I would recommend maestro or alibi. I think there gadgets are good and they have a solid loadout
---
Dokkaebi mains rise up
---
Everyone can be said to do that.
---
Yea, this is unrelated to Nokk but I heard Warden should be given the P90 as well
---
Thats thermite’s line. But ok.
---
clash is only useless when played alone without communication, just playing with one buddy while communicating is stupid strong, imagine a whole team.
---
Nice 3k!
---
Ok bye
---
I don't follow. What exactly bothers you about siege, that is also an inherent flaw of it?
---
P.s.. editing, I don't know. Movie Maker, maybe. But recording, Nvidia GeForce experience is ok enough. OBS is very good.
---
They said it was designed for tanks
---
I dont believe 7.62x54 had AP-I rounds, you're thinking of 14.5x11
---
Hey
---
That death was pretty fucking brutal
---
Any detaills you'd like? I'm level 40, usually play with two friends (in party) and I mostly use kapkan, thermite, fuze, and sometimes rook or frost. Playstyle is not very agressive.
---
Haha no I never troll on this game. Only play casual and even there I’m playing serious, but at the end it just a game and I would see the humor of it after. But yeah Atm I would be pissed as well.
---
But it's not lego? So what's the deal?
---
Thank you
---
Calm down, there's a reason I put a question mark in the title lol
---
In solo, she’s bad.  You need a competent 5 stack that knows when to push with her to allow her proper entry into the map.
---
I’m gonna say Warden’s the worst.  Very rarely will you find the time when you can actually use his gadget properly.
---
DO NOT DISRESPECT THE LORD AND SAVIOR TACHANKA!
---
Don't know why they thought virtually a human slingshot that can be heard by people miles away was a good gadget.
---
I'd rather go up against a Dokkaebi than a Jackal or Lion. I'll take a gun fight against a DMR or BOSG any day of the week.
---
Is noone gonna talk about the 106k renown?
---
Atleast he's got good guns though. Oh and did I mention he has a killer mustache?
---
NOmad
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
This shit is clean. I one the stealthy drone rotation.
---
Wasted time
---
fascinating
---
I feel like In real life if she used it. The speed it's pulling her in order to lift her without falling would send her though a window into a wall breaking her neck and killing her instantly
---
IMPERIAL FISTS INTENSIFIES
---
More plz
---
since when is kissing caveira considered gay? 'unless' ya' a female
---
Ahh OBS requires a good pc :(
---
Anyways i don't hate siege directly but it's this problem that i cannot explain unless you feel it.
---
Not saying 100% of the time it happens.
---
Sometimes it just does.
---
Sometimes it can go on a whole game, heck,  the reason i posted this is because the same doc spawn peaked me and in all 3 times i was 100% sure i landed a headshot because only saw his head.
---
It was clear its only his head because he had a mask that showed it
---
Nomad and Kaid's sidearms are actually the best things ever
---
Is there any wireless place?
---
The fuze walking backwards lol
---
He probably has a smog grenade
---
That reminds me of the time Lirik tried to shoot a drone and ended up killing his teammate.
---
Perma heal
---
Killing with a bundle of joy
---
Holy fucking shit
---
There’s not a problem multiple big youtubers such as the russianbadger said that there’s nothing wrong with hitboxes that it’s players aim and network
---
Big bruh moment
---
That is a very definite answer and I’m perfectly fine with it
---
Many players wished for this to happen
---
You are the worst kind of person... I love it.
---
He reminds me of my AP English teacher from 11th grade.
---
Not surprising that a monty main is saying this lol but I agree with you.
---
So do dokk and jackal and many other operators
---
Yes, because being a Monty main means I only play one operator.
---
Go to the front page of this subreddit, hit the three dots on the top right, then hit change user flair

---
it brings me pain, but sometimes sacrifices must be made
---

No prob
---
Psh... Could ask you the same question! 👁️👁️
---
Ja
---
how have you obtained this power
---
I usually drone before I do this, that team is ass
---
Uuuuuuuh yeah I’m a bit of a retard. Noticed it as soon as it was posted
---
Sledge's hammer analysis is even funnier.
---
It was good until you forced stale memes in the end.
---
It makes me laugh that you try and claim it's not about kills but I the post you moan about how often you're the top fragger. 
---
Team game mate, you win as a team and lose as a team.
---
If a selfish ability is one that only affects the user: Pulse, Glaz, Monty, Blitz, Vigil, Nokk, and Warden all come to mind.
---
Doc is a great example how selfishness is a trait of the player, not the operator.
---
at first i tough it was a cpu cooler (would be nice tho)

Yup and is starkly different from the MPX without overshadowing it. Slower firing but heavier hitting. Gives players more choice overall

*whines* But why did you that...
---
fucking people dont understand droning and killing WITHOUT marking their location, it happens all the time. HoW dO yOu NoW i WaS tHeRe? Dude, pls...

Clearly you havent played 1 hit kill glaz or always on thermal glaz. The smoke can also be a short duration.

I wonder how many times people have been banned for something like this.
---
Let’s say you like the flannel pattern on bucks uniform but don’t want it read. Just buy the original uniform and customize from there.
---
Siege before the Teamkilling penalty’s
---
Tbh depending how hard you clap you can quickly end up against plats in casual on a new account. 
---
Like I have an alt and only the first few were brain dead new players. It quickly was fair again. Because level doesn’t determine matchmaking.
---
Someone threw down a impact while trying to get their rook armor. Apprently they unstood it was unintentional, as the entire team is still alive.
---
How did you get 16 claymores?
---
Positives
---
- Makes game more tactical
---
- Provides more counterplay to a lot of things with more utility on the board with these changes
---
- Makes the game less reliant on being successful through just getting kills and more reliant on the attrition game with kills still having value
---
Negatives
---
- hurts peoples feelings when their favourite op is changed. 
---
Kills are always crucial but instead of being handed them on a plate with the weapons I’ve targeted, you may have to work for them. What’s the issue with that?! 
---
Love the back and fourth though. Just remember your opinion is as valid as anyone else’s
---
Because it’s staged
---
Well that’s completely fair 👍
---
Wasn’t sure as I’ve missed all the events except outbreak (took a couple seasons break)
---
That is so cool!
---
4:3 stretched doesn't look this terrible, it's probably 3:4 stretched
---
somebody... respecting my opinion and not calling me a dumbass? this can't be
---
Don’t do this to Mr. Bear.
---
More likely rook pressing the wrong button
---
Exactly.
---
“they get picked only for that”. That’s my exact issue. What’s the point of adding ops all with unique gadgets every season is players are only focussed on the weaponry only. 
---
That’s why the recycled weaponry is in a way a good thing; Lessens The Impact just on the weaponry alone. 
---
That’s just my opinion

Wait you did that without an alibi, that means they saw frost outside and didn't even bother to check
---
Ela is one of the biggest waste of  space on a team. Her scorpion though is the worst primary in game by a longshot. As it is the 3rd lowest damaging gun in game. And is the only primary without a proper recoil diamond.
---
If he didn’t say recruit I’ll be very disappointed
---
That’s cool as shit! Also digging your Pikachu JoyCons haha
---
Kaid is a maniac. He throws them like they're Marshmallows.
---
You do xd
---
That’s why I mention it... common mistake...
---
Default bind is „6“...
---
Also I am not sure which is the standard setting rn but there were 2 settings for drone usage...
---
So if you press 6, throw your cam and instantly (automatically) take out your phone to drone you should look in the settings for an advanced drone mode or something...
---
So you won‘t automatically go into ur cam/phone...
---
It’s rather a „pro“ or at least not beginners tip so if it’s easier for you then stick to the standard option... with the advanced one you can double check if you are actually safe to drone since roamers might hear you throwing the drone and pushing you... also you can use them that way as bait to lure unexperienced players :)
---
So you don’t like the changes because the P90 actually requires skill to use, over being handed free kills?! 
---
Also, the 417 can be spammed so quickly and has such low kick now, it’s really good. Obviously never as viable as the F2 but that’s why I want to close the gap by nerfing the F2. 
---
But I can’t discredit you if you feel that way. It’s all opinions at the end of the day

Castle has a decent gadget that can harm his team. his guns are decent. He can be good if you use him good but he isn't some big player in the round like thermite or cav are

I’m not an angel and have done this in the past occasionally (I think we all have) but we have to realise opinions are just that; subjective.

Some people may think Tachanka is OP and who am I to tell them no.

Rode a river boat through Laos and this older french lady took her shoes off (gross) and put them on the seat next to her for the entire trip so no one would sit by her.

Recruit can have better equipment like a grenade and stun to destroy jager. Who cares about attachments all weapons have barely any recoil due to the no sight so

Not true a lot of the time you mix passive abilities like viglis for instance with the weapon of choice

And while still helping your team like with jaeger you can roam

You also have to make sure you play against idiots haha what was that?!

Is it possible the tracker is only including casual and ranked time while uplay includes all special game modes, unranked, etc
---
Lol no it’s not. Both of those characters lend themself to the Anchor playstyle where they’d be hunkered down in objective, plenty of cover and not having to move much. Roamers however may struggle to keep hidden if they’re trying to sneak around outside obj but have to stand still in the middle of a hall just to not be caught by a scan.
---
Okay and the downvotes come in
---
Yes.

I got the uniform a few days ago, but I already have the shadow brine bundle for him so :(

that’s basically what Zofia has except she can withstand, have attachments and use her proximity stuns to help teammates and have breach charge/claymore. Ash has the same except i believe she can have 3 flashes. recruit automatically puts your team on a disadvantage for defense because he has 1 reinforcement so don’t even bother bringing that up. nice try though buddy

The fact rainbow hasn’t addressed this problem yet is just all the more proof I need to know that ubi gives 0 fucks about the consumers enjoyment.

Make system where you can search for people that want to use mic.. it’s that that hard lmao. Overwatch has done the same thing. If I want a team with mics I looks for a team that asks for mics. But no ubi is lazy and would rather us just wing it every time and just home we get teammates with mics.

Well if your friend played alot more games mmr has a "confidence" level where it'll determine that's pretty good where you are and you will start to gain and loose less. If you are doing less game that season you gain more

ubisoft can’t implement cross play without microsoft and sony like i’m pretty sure. and ubisoft will never add crossplay for consoles to pc because of how many people on console complain about mnks adaptors for console which don’t even mimic mnk 100 percent. One thing about ubi is they don’t give a shit about consoles and don’t really support it. the best experience for the game is pc

luckily, they all patiently queue up on the hatch they opened on the wrong side of the map while one of them walks back and forth, building up the courage to drop down the hatch. this can be solved by reinforcing the hatch, until they bring hard breaching terrorists. Then it is solved by being kaid or maestro.

Wel your in luck ela is getting one
---
Where'd.you trap the last enemy to do this?
---
I completely agree. Even if the defenders are running non electronic gadgets like rook doc castle cav tchanka, you should be using twitches drone taking out cameras inside the building (unless you have dokkaebi  with you then cameras can be an asset) and gathering Intel on the defenders positions. Using you drone just to shock someone is a complete waste. Unless the last defender is dbno and you wanna style all over them
---
He looks hella beefy
---
I think that’s a matchmaking problem more than a level req one. Non-ranked matchmaking has been absolutely abhorrent since I started playing.
---
 Unranked for low levels is good because they can get the flow of ranked before playing it and ppl take it more seriously generally.
---
I wanna see the rest of the project... Lol
---
Not the same one. He goes by a different name, but this is his real one.

Valk elite skin kind of thicc

from what I remember about the big operator: shoes will be changed to something military. Helmet will be "100% changed".
---
He also said a lot about changing "style" and face but he couldnt really tell me much about it. thats also why he cropped the annotations out
---
I really want to tell more but I deleted all conversations with him
---
Nothing really to do with console, more of casual, console rankeds are something else.

Hello BarcanLUL, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d9r8g1/oc/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Rook: because ALL the team depends on you for is to place down your armor immediately. Plus you get armor! The MP5 has an ACOG if you like that, or a respectable Reflex setup. He also gets Impacts which are easy to use and employ for personal breaches or to help allies.
---
Lesion: Another easy anchor, strong primary weapon, stupid strong ability (detection, damage over time, audible notification, stackable, invisible, visible to Lesion, and very powerful mid to end game.) He also has 2 Impacts that can be utilized like Rook. Lesion gets banned in Ranked for a reason, one is his ability, the other is the laser like smg.
---
Mute: this guy is a great anchor because that's where he excels. He seems incredibly simple to play, but even now I still find many new metas or ways to play him especially with his Jammers. Now his Jammers are powerful, they can prevent breeches, stop Dokabei, stop Jackal, stop Lion, stop any deployed device, including drones. When you become more advanced with Mute, you figure out how to dynamically move jammers as needed for tactical reasons rather than simple wall breach denials. His c4 is another powerful utility that can stop shield ops.
---
I can go on forever but these are good beginner high value operators. Other note worthy mentions: Thatcher, Thermite, Zofia.
---
Basically goes against everything in the Workers And National Kinsmen handbook.
---
Thermite has you covered, call maverick if you need it reheating. Rook too if you need plates
---
I hope R6:S adds crossplay like COD:MW.

I couldn't finish it, that ratio made my head hurt

haven’t encountered a single cheater so far. second day on pc.
---
Unranked definetly is a factor, but what comes in mind for me is that they change the way they run the severs. Previously 1 server hosted 3 matches, now they split every server with virtual machines, so instead of one big sever for 3 matches, they have 3 servers 1/3 of the original server big, each hosting one match. Microsoft can’t just press a button and it’s changes, this need some time. So maybe there aren’t enough servers right now? I don’t know, just an idea

Practice your aim in Terrorist Hunt. Learn the maps and call outs. Find a team to play with so you can actually implement some strats. Other than that, just keep playing.
---
*insert Bandit drug joke here*

Mad lad

Have you heard of aim?

You fire around 30 rounds, then wait for the peak while they think you're reloading.

This is actually a pretty solid idea. 
---
Deffinetly go lever action cowboy tho. Give him a single action revolver as a side arm
---
This must've been what got him the promotion.
---
They should implement the no duplicate system. It would make the game even more enjoyable when it comes to collecting all of the skins, headgear and outfits. What do you guys think ?
---
How the hell do people get a grade for this, and what was the project even about?

Instead of messing around you guys should be learning how to spell friend. RIP

Nah,I’m just messing with you.

Laugh.

i played lower ranks yesterday, teammates kept saying like 2 guys on the other team were cheaters
---
fun fact, they weren't cheating. even after the match ended they still shit talked them for cheating and im just like wtf
---
It also seems to be after the latest patch as well. The queue times were definitely a little longer from the start, but recently I can’t find a match until after five minutes.
---
Well damn I've had the outfit and headgear for like 6 months now...... and the gun skin for a month or two had no idea they were a set!
---
i've always liked this concept but a defender with the M4 would be busted
---
I see, a fellow man of culture who feels...things...when they see Twitch's Wild West Headgear
---
Ok so I’m not into all this “Thickest operator” crap, but you all need to understand what thicc means, it does NOT mean heavy, it does NOT mean fat. Gridlock is not thicc, she’s just a big girl, nothing is wrong with that, but she’s not “the thiccest op”
---
And if you're worse, you're a noob.
---
IQ thicc? That myth was busted a long time ago

The Scorpio got all the attention while this was left unnoticed
---
Where can I learn this power?
---
*cries in Xbox*
---
Fr😂😂
---
Id say gidlock for attack and goyo for defend. Both are really good for anti-entrance
---
Hello? IQ be wearing Yoga pants while slaying terrorists. She HELLA THICC
---
hehe ha

Kanal only playlist has secure, wish it didnt

There's this thing in the game, called the scoreboard, where everyone's name is listed. When you spot them and know which ops are there, like Gridlock is, it'll tell you whose playing them. 
---
The game also tells you who killed you. So you can simply read the name, match it to the operator, and now you know whose who. It's not magic, it's reading and logic small children learn from matching games.

Dudes offering legit, constructive criticism. Instead of making excuses for a mistake that we've all made, own it and get better.
---
You are the first person to have gotten that right!
---
In my experience in high plat 1 last season and climbing through plat this season, there are a lot less blatant cheaters than closet cheaters
---
How can you only play t hunt
---
Are you lagging into the past? Kill players 1 second before it actually happens? Can I get my hands on your internet
---
Also I noticed that I play on neu servers when I used to play on weu servers when I press esc in the lobby
---
I love Doc's eyes in this. Like of course you did Jäger.
---
Who checks the scoreboard mid gun fight
---
those literally look the same
---
Nomad or gridlock for attack and get goyo for defense, just dont get clash

So what youre saying is... Rook can be a 3 speed if he wants?
---
I was not properly prepared for that experience...
---
He shoulda just pre fired back one billet at a time. Mp5&gt;LMG all day
---
At first I thought this looked awesome. Then I turned my volume up...
---
To say the least it killed the mood
---
Weathers great here so pull up a chair have a cold beer

Please not another shield op 😭

Filthy casual missed the camera at the start. Vote to kick.

My voice is very deep and often sounds like I am a 30 year old so people will ask bout it and I don’t like social interaction like that so I just say forget it and if someone else says something productive then I might speak
---
To this day I still believe the terrorists just walk into it because when they added the claymore they didn’t make the AI recognize it
---
IDK I don't think you can change the setting on Xbox or PS4. At least last I checked.
---
laugh now
---
That is clearly wrong, I’d know who the thickest operator would be
---
At level 0 or even 7 I didn't even knew my way around maps or every character and gadget, I can't imagine how somebody of that level can wipe out 5 much more experienced players per round right from the game start and not be cheating.
