kind of offtopic but ubi really screwed up shield animations last update. Every playback I see my shield is clipped sideways into my body.
---
---
---
Cause siege servers shit, takes me about 2-3 times to open the game without the 'connection error' message
---
That change happened a while ago
---
This is why this game is no fun anymore

I think its pretty good, like all your others, I can see that you spent a long time on it and you shouldnt doubt yourself so much.
---
That's...god damn...

Same here, granted english has some pretty stupid rules lol

I mean yeah it‚Äôs kinda obvious the buttons are right there at the bottom

Black beards shield has 10 hp now and bullets go through it.

 Connection icon: The connection icon appears when you are experiencing packet loss or latency instability (for example, when some of your packets are being redirected on another internet route). When this icon is triggered, you can experience rubber banding, hits being rejected by the game server, and abnormal induced latency. The probability of experiencing those situations is far higher when the red icon is visible.

Why would you play high brightness when you‚Äôre planning on uploading to the darkness dwellers of reddit smh my head
---
I was wondering this too and in game chat doesnt make sense and its only on certian people
---
Thanks man I appreciate it I think I could have done better if I took another  hour putting it at 4 so like no and it was to much work and the wifi things at the bottom but that was hard and confusing I promise Finkas will be better.
---
Yeah, I play on Xbox and it runs the game at 60fps steady. But that doesn't stop latency issues and load times from fucking me over... Frame rate does not equal quality.

My friends and I at first thought it showed mouse and keyboard because we thought text chat would only be active if a keyboard was connected but I guess it‚Äôs an option on consoles and she activated it by accident? Maybe?

Thanks

he's stupid weaker
---
Thanks for the advice

Really that seems like the best answer ive gotten even if it is just speculation

Blackbeard‚Äôs shield has been removed and his head sized increased by 45%

Let me look
---
Bad reaction? All I saw in the clip was someone prefiring a c4
---
It's balancing, Kaid is a vital operator who offers unique and strong utility. Therefore, players are forced to deal with the high-risk-high-reward shotgun or the puny damage of the smg. If he had a strong smg he would be overpowered and overpicked.

Yeah man, don‚Äôt worry about it. I was joking around on this, and I have no clue how to hack games at all. Just thought it was a good joke is all
---
I play glaz the most but isint he getting a nerf soon?
---
Just slowly make your sens higher and higher, and also increase your ads sensitivity to a bit lower than your normal sensitivity so you can flick easier and turn corner faster
---
I don‚Äôt know man I‚Äôm just confused
---
Nope
---
Dang that was savage
---
not so much a nerf, it‚Äôs just going to make him be played more carefully

It's down:

Fun fact!: people are 200% more likely to play r6 with ‚Äúmilk‚Äù in their name
---
Bruh
---
What you mean nope?
---
I believe this might be related to the reactivation of the MMR rollback feature. It was previously bugged so reenabling this may have caused more bans, although this is all just speculation.
---
If that doesn‚Äôt work try opening a support ticket with ubi or actually calling them
---
Nice
---
u/hahafunnysexnumber

Nice.

Nope, as in nope, your troubleshoot did not work.

As a San Jose Sharks fan this packs a two for one punch. 
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
They‚Äôre actually down it sucks :/
---
I bet someone else on the team downed him with a flash bang and then died and left the game therefor it didn‚Äôt show who killed him
---
kkonas in the chat
---
Then as I suggested to the other user, jut try opening a support ticket with ubi
---
He said that this wasn‚Äôt R6 related so it should go to another sub
---
#DOOR STUCK
---
Another great Ubisoft moment, not being able to uphold servers, nice!
---
Lmao what is wrong with u
---
Literally how i play Blitz
---
Big daddy shaxx
---
Not from a defender
---
Like, how do you come back from that?
---
It‚Äôs just a banwave
---
It‚Äôs only PS4 servers too smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's fine, but all I'm saying is no, restarting the app doesn't "just fix it" for everyone
---
Said that this wasn‚Äôt R6 related so it shouldn‚Äôt be in this sub
---
On pc, usually restarting siege and the uplay client will always fix the issue, unless the servers are down permanently
---
I've noticed the servers have been trash lately after the update, maybe that could be a factor?
---
Didn't know this is even possible.
---
Me and OP are on PS4
---
I don't play PS4 but probably in game chat, since stuff like Skype turns down your audio when you're in a call unless you disable it on PC but in game chat wouldn't do that I would assume, unless it turns the audio down when someone's talking which doesn't happen on the PC version, these are just my thoughts
---
My favorite out of the 3 is Glaz, but it's all on who you play more
---
You hit his damn mushroom hat
---
Understandable. It's the reason I've stopped suggesting this game to new people. Its has a very steep learning curve and you'll basically be getting curb stomped the first 30 hours or so and then get more curb stomped even 100 hours in. And theres alot of toxicity. But we play it for those 1v3 moments where you clutch and it's an amazing feeling tbh. So like take that how you will. You will die, alot. You will rage, alot. 
---
So unless you prepared for all the bullshit that comes with those 1v3 moments I'd say leave now and go play a more feel good game. Because if you wanna play this you gonna have a rough first 30 hours.
---
Gotta find my clip back when Cav had a c4 and I wiped the whole enemy team.
---
Yes I see that, was just suggesting what worked for me might for you aswell, if not feel free to continue your day
---
because the mmr rollback system is live
---
Is it Carl the hedgehog?

JOJO?!

*opfor last op standing*
---
In game chat, makes it much easier to adjust your game sound and chat volume
---
Whoa thats too much
---
Wtf
---
Game chat has less sound delay on mics (miniscule) and is slightly better for sound whoring imo.
---
the hardes choices require the strongest wills
---
Who's shoes are those
---
You cant single it out though its very fair how it is. You may not have got the win without them, Weather or not you knew they were cheating. The points it took im presuming what you got for the win that game.
---
I just looked back on the clip and realized that I downed the montagne not the flashbang which makes me even more confused. All I can say for sure is that it wasn‚Äôt caused by someone leaving the game
---
Here is the [clip](https://www.reddit.com/user/moosepersona/comments/bet7el/guy_kills_himself_with_flashbang/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
you can't go wrong. starter is gone now.
---
It is because they simply delete that match. So they reverse the MMR gain/loss from that match
---
Noice
---
Blitz is ez
---
r/nice
---
EU = more toxic but overall better players.
---
NA = super fucking chill for the most part but the playerbase imo isn't as good. That's just from my  personal experience in plat/diamond on both servers. I love playing on NA because it's just so chilled out.
---
Some of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know you can‚Äôt throw shit at yourself so how this man did this is some kind of died ass bug or this is fake.
---
The comment from the original post it still on the front page of r/rainbow6 ffs 6 hours ago...
---
Map still available on custom
---
That‚Äôs what a real hero looks like.
---
Console - I can't ping while ads. Seems unintuitive this way.... Maybe it's a console thing?
---
okey dokey
---
But can you ping with Ads?
---
That's crazy because I just did it on the same spot last night. I think it's common for that spot to do that
---
Yea it is :/. Your team was all high golds and they had a gold 3 and queued with a diamond. It‚Äôs not like they were exploiting the system. You just got unlucky
---
Gold
---
That‚Äôs really nice of him. This looks sick!
---
Nkw thats an epic laptop
---
"Without the leaf"... ok
---
What do you have against blitz
---
I don't get why people like Black Ice that much. Yes, is rare and all... But...   
---
Anyway, respect
---
Yeah it‚Äôs only ¬£9 for me too since it‚Äôs discounted on PS4. Was gonna just spend ¬£8 on Maverick and Mozzie but maybe not.
---
 Nice
---
He didn't even spell dokkaebi right
---
That‚Äôs IQ too man
---
If you can solo q to plat then you can usually reach plat 2 - diamond in a squad.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the reply to that post
---
\^\^\^ been deranking because i keep getting placed into teams that must all be solo queued or mentally incapable of doing something other than talking shit. I solo queue for everything because none of my friends are in my time zone or just dont like r6, and I end up playing with the stupidest people on this side of the galaxy. I rarely find a team that is helpful or is generally not bad. So many times have i been forced into 1v4s and had to clutch for my useless teammates. I'm no plat, I've only been playing since halfway through grim sky, but I know a bad player when I see one. I always end up losing my rank because of how bad NA solo queue is. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I just got a new game, and have honestly considered ditching rainbow because of how hard it is to get anywhere. Playing something else is a breath of fresh air and seems much more fun than playing with a bunch of assholes with &lt;3 chromosomes.
---
But where can I get one?
---
It reverses whatever MMR you gained or lost. It basically deletes that match from history.
---
Faux leather. Got it at Target on clearance for like $20
---
You're a god.
---
They need to give us a separate slider for ACOG's already.  It's a common feature in many FPS games both old and new.
---
While your at it someone replace the window with a Mira Black Mirror
---
It works now
---
It‚Äôs working now
---
[not fake](https://www.reddit.com/user/moosepersona/comments/bet7el/guy_kills_himself_with_flashbang/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) soy best guess is probably a glitch?
---
üòÇ honestly I didn't expect this to gain so much traction. I made it at work in a hurry.
---
Yes
---
Works now
---
It‚Äôd be better with sound

Amazon! And it comes with one for the toilet too
---
I hate it when this happens with fast-firing weapons. Like P90, 970 RPM, what are the odds?
---
now that he has a shield, can i shoot through the shield?
---
Like those chances.
---
I really look forward to fucking with my friends this way tbh
---
I dont believe m870 opens walls in this game mode for walking through. Could be wrong
---
Had a chance to become Canadian and didnt take it eh?
---
Yo wanna play if so my psn is MazzyTheUltimate add me
---
I see what happened. This ones easy. A few patches back they added a sort of martyrdom effect when you die with a grenade primed. When you do this the grenade renders as neutral, but it is still linked to you. Hence why you can blow yourself up with frags. When he was downed the flash bang fell and did the last bit of damage done to him during the fight which is why the defender did not receive the kill. The grenades is still linked to the player but it is falling without hitting any object so it is capable of doing damage.
---
Smart idea
---
In a match currently I‚Äôll add you in a bit
---
How do we know it‚Äôs not just from you finishing a terrorist hunt? Lol
---

I had spring break this week and most of my squad was in school and testing so me and my friend did ranked and kept a w/l streak and got on for the 2nd match of today and got literally fucked by russian hacker kid ivanov
---
Dokkanair is pretty good too

Im just calling him ivanov for lack of a better word and ivanov was on our team

Yea.
---
I got queued with cheaters twice in a row, same cheaters. I successfully threw both games losing almost 100 elo. I was pissed as fuck but the path of anti-cheat made me proud. Then I got on and got the elo back pushing me to Plat 3 and praised the lord

Funny because he followed every single rule about using a firearm and no one was hurt as a result.

He never needed to counter them. He already countered the Intel of 23 ops, he didn't need to counter the Intel of the most influential Intel op as well.

OP on the wrong subreddit

Who else thought hibanna was standing on a ledge
---
Wait, that is illegal
---
If you also feel that the game should be balanced around those who feel lion didn't need the nerf and/or wasn't the problem, then you definitely don't understand how a game is balanced.
---
So maybe my control left button is Waco.
---
I told you I can‚Äôt read!
---
Glaz can make vault holes through soft walls in 6-8 shots and so can the D.50 in about 2 mags but it depends on caliber

---
Glaz and IQ are still good but now Dokka has 12 second call and lion has pings like alibi
---
I approve.
---
12/10 would spend real cash on that.
---
Especially when youre the last alive, it's a 1v1 and you have 5 seconds to get on the objective so you vault and...
---
Dude. I absolutley need to get that. That'd be so cool to have. Plus I can put it somewhere when my friends come over
---
Not intentionally. Lion never needed the nurf. Its could you see the thing pop up find some cover sit and dont move, its such a simple counter. Cap is fine. Reversing the candella's cooking time is a little weird, but doesnt hurt the game. Cap and ying are fine. Lion didnt needed to be drop to useless.
---
Now imagine it doesn't have that tag. What does it change for you?
---
No its a briefcase
---
I‚Äôve never understood why console players are so much more toxic
---
Doesn't fit anymore. They aren't just taking it out of beta. They are literally reworking it. So ubish*t for ranked isn't going to fit anymore.
---
Maybe use the same meme but fit hitreg. It would then make sense.
---
I remember when I could actually play an entire day and the only tk was accidental. This fucking community man.
---
why was there blood from his head then?
---
Yea it sucks. Also i agree but the for honor thing it has issues but the dev twam always keeps contact with the community to work out the issues. Im a die hard fan for it, sadly i used to do what the this toxic side of the community does but not anymore, and i admit there is issues but they are trying their best. Doing better than 6's imo
---
That's a fair point, they are more consistent and open. Plus they just have so much more fun it seems.
---
Yep, doormatt #2008
---
It‚Äôs not supported natively on console and you have to use a third party adapter to use a mouse and keyboard on console for Siege. Ubisoft have even made statements before that using a mouse and keyboard on console Siege is cheating. They have tried several times to get rid of the issue but the people who make the people who make the adapters keep patching them so the shitty people that but then can continue cheating.
---
How???
---
It's just ruining the game.
---
The best part is they listen. We said "hey we are getting tired of constant battle outfits and bad effects" they stopped doing weekly content and switched to every now and again to be able to realise better outfits and effects. We asked for an exacution where shugoki uses his weapon and we got one(its kinda bad but we got it) and one where valk uses her spear as throwing weapon and we got one. They listen and thats the best part
---
This is BRILLIANT.  Added to the bag of meme strats

at least thats different than the other shitposters , but still considered breaking the rules of the reddit

Plus let's not forget, the damn matchmaking in the beginning. They got to work on that shit so fast after everyone complained.

I also agree with lesion. Hes got good guns and a good gadet. Also pretty easy for newer players too

Wth are you talking about, his scan got reduce, no outlines, this is balanced, and as a lion main from his beginning that's his best statement
---
Directional sound in this game is the worst I've ever heard. They can destroy a hatch directly above me and I can't hear where it's coming from and I have good headphones.

If you place her traps in super obvious spots then you wont do shit. Look up good places to hide. Also trap operators usually work only the first few rounds and once or twice per match.

I really don't understand why bullets don't penetrate corpses.

Happy to help then, and good luck with your saving!

It will work automatically by hitting the face so it will never miss.

Mah name's Philip! Philip *Paul* Johnson!

I think akimbo would actually be a nerf in a game so reliant on precise headshots
---
Yeah true, I didn't realise that he asked if I was going to do it again when I typed it
---
This is true harakiri.
---
1 - Last time I played was yesterday and I don't expect them to listen to some rando on the internet.
---
2 - Yes, but I think Dokkaebi is one of those operators that suffer from "Overwatch syndrome", because only mute can directly prevent the calls. Because of this I thought tthat this barrier would be a functional proposal
---
First of all wrong subreddit, second it would be nice if you stated what region platform, ranks, experience etc.
---
yes
---
She's ok, you need a coordinated team to use her right but she got nerfed recently so I'd say pick someone like Maverick
---
Which op were you using here? Great vid btw :)
---
Ok but it doesn't sound like you are accepting any other opinions than your own.
---
Yeah then people would not leave because they care about K/D
---
Yh eLion need is fine. An endless Lion scab would be stupidly broken since you could just place the drone in  objective and it would always show where the defenders are and since attackers have Fuse, Buck, Sledge, Ash, etc you could just wallbang or open up walls right above or below the defenders.

Its better than what I can do.

I honestly don‚Äôt know know. We (me and the group I play with) have been in low gold basically this whole season and we‚Äôve literally just been getting like a bronze teammate and then facing high plat enemy teams and it just completely ruins the experience

Well that‚Äôs your issue I guess. I‚Äôm currently using ¬£2.50 Samsung earphones and my directional sound is perfectly fine. Sound might be fucked on pc since I play on PS4. Also, Mav is perfectly loud enough, I hear him burning through walls 2 rooms away from his location. It‚Äôs really not tough.
---
Well thank you

Foot fetish bois where ya at?

I don't as it will kill the game, its to big of a change to a 3 year old game, especially when the one shot headshot mechanic got a lot of people interested in the game.
---
Same thing happened to me, I can't tell you why this is happening but it took me to 128 wins before it gave me the trophy.
---
aaah now I got it

look at this mad lad when im sitting her plat 1 eat it nerd
---
Make sure you notice the white tracers showing where enemies are from, I'm partially deaf and find increasing the bass on your headphones to the maximum allows you to "feel" when people are shooting at you
---
He is actually doing slav dance with the hard bass music
---
A lot of people are so divided on her weapons. I honestly am confused which one's actually better.
---
top right, connection error, also you shot finka first, which looked liek you killed maverick but you didnt
---
They need to change that
---
1) I have no proof of that
---
2) then don‚Äôt criticise other people

if you dont use your xbox account would you accept money to account share?

bombera
---
I wish they would remove bombers, they are so annoying
---
I'd rather they remove the automatic exploding nitro cells.
---
Any operator is good if the enemy can't hit you. It was a nice kill by your friend. I'm just saying it doesn't change the fact that at plat and diamond pc, clash is statistically the worst operator in the game.
---
A cavaira as mr bear would be actually scary
---
No hostage killed 6/10
---
It doesn't change the fact that anybody or operator can get nice kills either. I wouldn't be talking considering Vigil is statistically over picked and too weak... Which is arguably worse considering people are trying with him and not clash.
---
If you want to add skill- or at least nuance, then Lion should have to be on the same floor as where he is scanning to get the Intel of that area. So theoretically each of his scans could be used for each floor, some two-story maps (Border) notwithstanding.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell you all I know off the top of my head is that sensitivity was at 75 for both horizontal and vertical
---
You want lion to be a corpse with no gun then.
---
Hahahaha the guy(he‚Äôs one of my friends) playing ash is a degenerate how coincidental
---
Ping was only about 30 but I guess i could‚Äôve lagged
---
fine...i'll do it myself
---
WINTER SORRY
---
Can no one use single shot DMRs? People are always like ‚ÄúbLaNk NeEdS a AuTOmAtIC RiFlE‚Äù, use the DMR like you‚Äôre supposed to, at longer ranges and winning gun fights against automatics will be easy.
---
Huh?
---
Agreed
---
By that logic Fuze is broken because you can wipe out a team with a click of a button.
---
I meant more along the lines of graphics, but thanks anyways!
---
No, not at all. Like most others have commented, I want Lion to lose his global ability. There needs to be a risk/ reward to all gadgets. This new version is easier to live with, but still not where it needs to be.
---
I know I was just saying I pay like no attention to my graphics
---
Yeah but is he a ^(fucking) degenerate?
---
Oh most definitely
---
I thought it was 400 swear words for an instant nc-17 rating, and they used 399.  I could be remembering wrong tho
---
You mean he's one of...My people?!
---
People literally arguing with science LMFAO! BMI of 32 = obese. End of story.
---
Unfortunately, we already know that they will not be updating Tachanka.
---
If simply knowing the whereabouts of a defender was enough then drones would be a death sentence.
---
I guess is if your one of them haha
---
I didn‚Äôt know people used the smoke smg
---
I‚Äôd say go in t-hunt and test out some attackers see which gun/operator your most comfortable with, probably not the best advice but there you go.
---
First, I‚Äôm amazed you think zofias AR is inconsistent, I see it as one of the most consistent guns in the game, has great damage and moderate fire rate with small recoil
---
If ash isn‚Äôt taken she‚Äôs like the best or second best attacker right next to twitch. If you just want a good gun, thatcher and sledge have the L8 which is pretty consistent, and thermites 556xi is also very consistent.
---
Nomads ability is really good, but guns can be unstable at times, just try out different attackers if you have them all, and stick with the ones you like
---
;)

You fucking screenshotted your own post LMAO

2 things I‚Äôve played with you before you‚Äôre really good! 2nd that okEGG is a bought account. The person had Bought it from a dude who just had an afk not level it up for him. We lost 2 games in a row because it was a 5V4
---
Yea and there‚Äôs always one u don‚Äôt notice that kills u
---
But could we get them each in desktop wallpaper?
---
Yeah I could see it from your staindpoint, but in my opinion I feel the scan time is not as effective unless you're roamer and they're heavily seeking you specifically, So essentially I think he still does his original job but its counterable and lesser chance of being wall banged.
---
What's a risk proposal you would add for him?
---
How do I change my game language I want that announcer
---
Can you tell them the internet says:"Emilia is better than Rem." And give no mention of names whatsoever. In fact, burn your computer for my sake.
---
Then bury me when I'm found dead.
---
What's it made of?
---
oof.
---
Its my first rainbow six drawing.
---
I thought the new season dropped already and Bombera was a new operator you can‚Äôt do this to me op
---
&gt; People are just going back to the logic they tried to use when Lion was first released, 'just stand still its only a short amount of time
---
I feel like you're not reading my comments. I don't advise to stop moving I'm advising to keep moving because a ping isn't a death sentence. What I've been trying in vain to explain to you for like 3 comments is that he doesn't force you to stand still in EVERY situation.
---
If you realise they can‚Äôt detect it to stop them, what makes you think they can put them in a spectate lobby? Or do you expect players to volunteer for it?
---
Bullets pass through walls with ease and can deal killing head shot blows.

The fact that you don't know the worth of that skin is hurting a lot of people right now. The spring break skin you are running is far rarer than Black Ice is, especially with Black Ice being in alpha packs. Appreciate what you have, people would be willing to pay money for that skin.

Rank aint shit. Dont worry to much about rank and focus on self improvement and having fun. Gold 1 currently and two time plat im telling you its better when your not stressing about your rank.
---
Everything! If you‚Äôre constantly bottom fragging, you shouldn‚Äôt be in the same rank with a guy getting 20-something kills per round.
---
I thought you could just buy it. Also it‚Äôs pina colada
---
It would have happened with the smg-11, the shotguns main purpose is utility and the smg 11 is for frags
---
Definitely a miss over his head, remember that shots in acog go slightly above tip of the reticle
---
&gt; Just ~~don't~~ do clutch the hostage room.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised, but I'm glad the dice rolled in my favor this time.

Bomber's upsetti
---
I did that. Played offensive t hunt a ton when I was new. Never thought to switch to defense. Then every time I grab an op with a nitro cell I toss it and leave it and for months never got a kill with it. So I put it on a door, hid, could still hear it and guy walks through. I kill him then look up to see it still sitting there. So I Google it and sure enough you have to detonate it. Big oof on my part and I felt stupid as hell.
---
Not just the earmuffs but also the top of the helmet. The helmet is much bigger then the actual head hitbox
---
I want more options for terrorist hunt. Like headshit only, no bombers. More moving. More/less health etc.
---
I love it
---
Lol right , man ever since ive switched to pc i realized what pc copper &gt; ps4 diamond actually meant
---
Was part of a spring break bundle for a very short time before being removed, came along with a spring break hat and a starfish but they are in alpha packs.
---
Is better to warmup with bombers. In that way you improve your short distance headshots and quick reaction to runouts
---
well I clearly don't hit the top of his helmet do I
---
I‚Äôm not stressing about the tank, so much that I can‚Äôt have good teammates because of my rank.
---
Give him crusader armor and a handheld minigun that he can walk around in (.5 speed | 5 armor)
---
I disagree with this. I have two friends who just started playing this game, there‚Äôs almost twenty maps they‚Äôre forced to play when all they want to do is play the ranked maps so they can learn and go play ranked. This game is already confusing enough we don‚Äôt need to throw 20 maps at new players (especially with all the dogshit ones like Tower, Kanals, and Bartlett. They should at least be able to disable the casual maps.
---
And it works! Maverick has a hidden ability
---
Just do terrorist hunt on Outback, it doesn't have bombers, nitros, or barbed wire.
---
I find quite a lot of the shock humour is a bit repetitive though, like some of it's new and creative but when you're watching a children's toy scream the f word because their legs got chopped off for the tenth time in one video it loses any humour for me
---
Thank
---
I wouldn't say that's a fault in the game then that's just the other team's good teamwork
---
I did not know that. That‚Äôs cool
---
Someone forgot to pay rent
---
Oh yeh I recognise that, it still hinders you greatly if you do move. Because the pings are next to constant during the scan it tracks you near perfectly. 
---
Plus what I've been trying to say for the past 4 comments is that his gadget is still the same fundamentally broken gadget. It is not a rework like the devs stated, not that Lion needs for him to be balanced.
---
Yessir!
---
Ikr. I prefer house because there are atmost 2 rooms of c4, and I avoid them like the plague
---

---
I looked for 3 hours trying to find one. All i found were unicorns and i think an anime Called Steve universe. Da fuq is that?!?!

Yeah I know, but I think I deserve the kills that I down

Why is pulse with them lol

---
But actually, when you go up in that treehouse and get spotted, someone always comes out from that door.
---
Or just Muslims (sorry for the joke I tried to be edgy and pls don't downvote)
---
No, just no
---
i agree entirely. in fact, i'd like to have only terrorists in bomber outfits, without the whole suicide bombing aspect. they have like double health so 2 headshots kill them. it'd be great for recoil control.
---
Killed or downed? She can rev herself
---
reminder fuse has a gun that's better than the r-4c
---
You mentioned teams using mics etc, nothing to do with ubisoft. Ability is there, players choice to use it. Stop whining.
---
Ok... smurfs then. Yes smurfs should be sorted.
---
If they are legit players in that rank, they're either having a good round, or the rest of the enemy are still ranked too high.
---
Low ranks are meme territory.
---
Although it was unbalanced I liked kanal so I'm looking forward to the rework for that.
---
bc it's not a direct way to kill them. the ai just freaks out.
---
actually, and all bombers mode would be great for practicing accuracy. I mean have you seen what happens when you body a bomber? Guys are fucking tanks. Also, R6V2 had minor customization elements to THUNT. Enemy density, difficulty.
---
Yh im sick of people who leave because they died within 30 seconds of the round starting
---
Except when you play low ranks, its crap gameplay.   
---
But yes, caring about rank and stressing over it is stupid.
---
Sound on for the hype man
---
Oh, well the majority players are pretty cheeks so it is going to be extremely difficult to not carry. Like the other guy said either just wait next season or be a god and land 18 kills a game
---
I completely understand how that could be dissatisfying for some. In the end there are only few skins that I find distansteful and would enjoy the game more by not seeing, but those are my personal dislikes and a system that would serve everyone would include some sort of tagging system for skins. Such system would be needlesly complicated for the benefit it would provide so I think I can go without.
---
I suppose Ubisoft could eventually give some sort of tacticool or cute filters, but as you say their track record on more popular quality of life fixes isn't great, it isn't all that likely.
---
Can you peek on console without ADSing
---
Free renown and my smurf got Maverick.
---
I wish the bombers had a toggle on/off. They ruin the flow of practicing (though I'm complete shit so maybe it's just me).
---
Ubi announced Terrorist hunt v.2
---
I agree. Upvote
---
Definitely. I had a player in the enemy team in fckng RANKED who left every time he got downed or had low hp, and then instantly rejoined. He finished with 9/something/0, though he would have died literally every round. That was some low move bullsht.
---
I'm sorry I'm about to really piss you off but that's the stupidest goddamn logic I've ever heard in regards to balancing. Why don't we just remove him from the game at this point? Why even have Tachanka? Why don't we just stop lying to ourselves and trash him because obviously since he doesn't affect the game, he has no point. Recruit is more important.
---
Ridiculous.
---
1) don‚Äôt check out when you die, watch and learn 
---
2) keep track of things that caught you off guard, cheeky spots, and use them. 
---
3) know the common pushes on each obj 
---
4) know the uncommon pushes 
---
5) play to your strengths- both overall and that day. Look online at your operator stats with a minimum of 10 hours played. If you‚Äôre struggling to hit shots on D that day, i always go to rook or doc for the acog. Anchor if you‚Äôre off, roam if you‚Äôre on 
---
6) play through the bad days and learn
---
Man your game is so beautiful, are you running it on 4k res?
---
Windows has built in DVR? How do I use it?
---
Only acceptable if dogo has auto aim duel mini guns on his back, that have build in thermal aiming to wall bang
---
When you get what you want but not what you need
---
It's honestly your choice mate but i can tell you who not to get. I know it says i main her and i do but Ela is one of the weakest defenders in the game.  Her scorpion is lethargic in its damage with it being at 22 and it's fire rate doesnt compensate for it when you can't hit anything. It's horizontal recoil is basically random right now but i guess it's vertical is controllable due to the skill round weapon recoil buff last year. Her shotgun is the only good thing about her but it can only do so much at range. Her mines ate very ineffective because of how short the effects last. Her secondary gadgets don't fit with a roamers or even semi roamer which is how i play by just going a little out of objective.  Compared to every other 3 speed and just roamer in general she is by far the weakest and i don't see it changing any time soon because ubisoft is a very slow dev team who listens to no one asides baised youtubers and pro leagues cunts who basically dictate the game now.
---
It‚Äôs because siege isn‚Äôt only about kills
---
First, you did not say you were defending them but by saying " Lol okay, your complaining doesn‚Äôt affect any of us ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø " you are clearly saying that any problems with the game are ok and everyone is ok with them. 
---
Second, you keep acting like EVERYONE is ok with this and no one will care. Again by you saying this you are clearly defending them in a way where you are NOT saying you are but implying that this is ok and is not their problem. And really? And do you really think emailing them is gonna work? If it did we would not have to be making these types of posts cause these issues would have been solved, but clearly, UBI only cares if there is a big portion of people who are clearly upset at something. So I guess making a complaint on an issue from a game that THEY made makes me a 5-year-old? Yeah, cause that makes sense, you dunce.
---
"alSo fUCk YoU, UnIntSalL PLezASae", you fucking neanderthal.
---
Indeed. But i don't trust the physics and the bounces enough in that game to do it.
---
I feel you man. I will probably win 1 out of 15 games when I solo queue ranked. It‚Äôs annoying because it‚Äôs either people throwing or 11 year olds yelling at me after they already died doing something idiotic.
---
Did you just assume their gender?
---
‚ÄúClean‚Äù
---
Improving your aim you say?
---
Do you realise the amount of times, ive broken 1 window, only for a bomber than happen to spawn close exactly at that very window that ive made 1 hole, to just explode immediately the moment i saw contact with it.
---
Is it tho? You saying it is better is just as weak for an argument.
---
It‚Äôs really a pain in the ass. You on pc?
---
Usually I don‚Äôt expect enemies to be somewhere
---
Man I remember being so confused when Clash first came out. Totally forgot this would happen and was so confused why Vigil/Pulse weren‚Äôt dying (they weren‚Äôt IDed)
---
Yup had this a few times as well, it's pathetic.
---
Hidden IQ buff?!
---
Thanks a lot. Will look out for these things
---
Killcams are recorded client side so they're likely to look janky, particularily in the event of a trade. It's not at all indicative of Rook's aim, it's an issue with the way killcams are recorded and replayed.
---
I see the issue, the rook using a holo on a mp5 ....
---
Never said they weren‚Äôt annoying I just think nitro cells are worse.

Overpowered ops are regularly picked and imbalance matches in their favor. Underpowered ops are less picked and don't have an effect on the matches they aren't picked in. How does that not make sense to you?

---

Alright
---
Just go on strat roulette
---
Nothing prepares you for a real match like a room with 30 c4s in it.

---
When I'm in a squad we sometimes like to go 1 at a time on attack. Like when round starts 1 person goes and tries to ace, if they die another goes and so on till you either win or lose the round.
---
You just said it. Exactly why worthless operators should be paid attention to past those currently participating.
---
10/10 recommend marking post as a spoiler
---
What‚Äôs wrong with putting the reinforcement on the out side?
---
Why would you uninstall steam? It‚Äôs essential if you plan on ever getting any other games,but yea you can just launch uplay and then the game.
---
If the Sledge is pushing from a different direction, calling him over is a waste of time. It's a safe bet to anticipate a reinforcement on dirt tunnel so bringing Thermite was the right call. Time outweighs utility in almost every situation
---
Watch youtube channels that mainly play siege. When I started and was super hyped about the game, I always watched videos on it, very helpful. I recommend Matimi0, really nice guy and awesome player
---
Or be so sweaty you don‚Äôt ever need to warm up
---

Honestly dude, we didn‚Äôt have to watch the whole 2 minute round.

All of this I can just do with normal terrorists
---
Your recoil control is off the charts
---
It has sound, it isn't a gif it's an mp4. Are you on mobile? Gfycat supports sound now but few of the mobile apps work with the sound. On desktop you need to click the speaker icon.
---
I leave it uncut. Sorry
---
Casual uses different data than ranked.
---
Win a match using only bullets &amp; melee (no gadgets/drones/barricades/reinforcements).
---
Unranked since I‚Äôm currently deployed but last season I was at Gold 4 and 3 constantly.
---
How do you know so much about the bomber anatomy, kinda worries me where you've been
---
Jokes aside, I gotta try this too lol
---
The AUG has never seemed like a bad recoil weapon to me, it feels like a lazer when I've used it.
---
RUDE!

lesion, i think he is pretty good and im glad i got him for free

Good question Billy
---
Why would they vtk? you got that quick win.
---
It‚Äôs really just a spawnpeek weapon tbh, and if you‚Äôre going for headshots, the damage numbers don‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôd still put on Extended Barrel.
---
It‚Äôs better to just use the Spas-15 though.
---
Ahh yeah I'm on PC, her AUG is one of my favorite weapons. Just feels very clean and easy to control on PC&lt; don't know how it is on console.

A rare bunch we are, but I just really enjoy playing him that's all
---
Haters gonna hate.
---
Oh yeah thanks for showing me that fuze spot. That's gonna be a go to now

But I still love how it turned out

Just kill the people running out 4head ur just bad
---
Vigil
---
Don't get me wrong, he's my second most played op, just don't see too many of you.
---
Puts all the grenades center room too. Getting there is tricky sometimes though. I really didn't think this would work when I did it, just saw an opportunity and went for it.
---
**CLIP IT CLIP IT CLIP IT**
---
You are talking about making their mellee a knock down instead of a kill
---
You are wanting to kill them with one C4
---
And you talk about how blitz is still annoying, HE IS MEANT TO BE. It just sounds like you had a bad experience with a really good player and you went to reddit to vent ur frustration.
---
I will agree with how hotboxes are fucked atm tho..
---
Killcams aren‚Äôt aligned properly
---
If I have a good team, I don't mind being pinged because I'll run myself into the crossfire of anchors or the other roamer(s).  Jackals tend to expect the tracked target to run and hide alone.  Watching two entry ways into the target's room is asking for easy peeks.
---
Worst case, run back to site and become the roaming anchor you were always dreamed of being.
---
That said, if Jackal *were* to get a nerf, this would be fair.  I just don't see them doing it if the pick rate isn't abnormally high.
---
Hi
---
Claymores, Nomad or a tiny speck of gamesense and awareness are 3 great counters to runuts.
---
Yes people have their gadgets out when you join a game in progress. It was on the patchnotes.
---
Yes, please!
---
It‚Äôs weird, hard to control, and wonky. Also the gun takes up a big portion of the screen too so
---
It‚Äôs close, I still don‚Äôt think it beats out the one where Cav literally rips off Bucks arm.
---
Any gun is. She's terrible because of the amount of effort you need to put in to get a decent result with the character (excluding playing against bad / new players) Also, sorry u/LegoBars for getting downvoted into oblivion just because you're not that knowledgable about the game right off the bat.
---
Make it so defenders are instantly detected when they run out

My friend....I NEVER mentioned ANY of those points. I am guessing you messed up my comment with somebody else's.

Thx, that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get about reddit. Why downvote someone for not knowing smth. I mean  I didn‚Äôt say something bad, I didn‚Äôt harass anyone, but still.

Can confirm

no he isn't, you guys don't understand about patents and trademarks. its like saying downloading a crack is harmless.

Just try yourself to "tune" your car with a self made body shape of a Ferrari or a Lamborghini put the pics online of your making of ,"for yourself", watch it trend and see how fast those two company come at your ass for violating their intellectual property.

Nah, some people say that Maestro is still puffin that cigar from Para Bellum

This was the greatest cosplay we did :D

Sweaty Ash mains have no chill

Yea, some people just downvote anything they see that they disagree with or don't understand. I have to wonder how they didn't see the context whatsoever, though.

I want a bombers only thunt to practice aiming. Im masochist.

Espera mais um pouco, vai q da certo

I get that, and blaming something is much easier than blaming circumstance and bad luck but sometimes bad luck is all there is to blame. Good luck in your future games man.

Not anymore. He just suffered arthritis. As did his sister Ash. He's gonna be very, very slow now.
---
Let him just carry the actual gun and move very slow the actual gun that is mounted only ways like 80 pounds and im pretty sure tachanka the god can carry that
---
Not worth it imo, grinded for 1-2 months for it, its meh, looks alot like tinfoil, but you know what, if you like it go for it, renowns free and easy to get, why not? (Also, only got it because my friend and i had a deal to see who got it first, i won) i use it on the .44 mag, it looks so sexy on it
---
200 iq comment with a 300 iq reply

Why? What happened that means the game won‚Äôt get any more players? Also 20mil is still super super respectable and outright amazing for a 4 year old game
---
Ok, this brings back memories. One time, I was playing casual with a friend. This guy picked castle and decided to roam. He later came back, tore down all the castles he had up, and basically killed us all. Yes, it was casual but like wtf... This isn't his fault, but him not being able to speak English didn't help either

It's a staged video in a custom game

Play Nomad ... this should teach them a lesson.

You can baith the nitro cells.

Walk close and run away in time

Why even try to clear them? They are almost never in a choke that you have to push through, just go around

clash is....good....

i see what u did there

Look at when the bullet counter changes. That's when you shot was fired. You didn't headshot the Maverick. Bullets also come out of the tip of the reticle
---
You cant scroll back if thats what you are asking. Once the message leaves the screen you cant look back on the logs
---
Maybe because a lot of people don‚Äôt play on their own servers to get higher ping to basically teleport around
---
Just attach a string to the trigger, throw the weapon and and pull the string.  Ultimate trickshot
---
Because while her DMR is great, it loses to most automatic weapons outside of long range. That‚Äôs why people prefer automatic over single shot. (F2 over 417, V308 over Lion‚Äôs 417) Blackbeard‚Äôs SR-25 was the best but got nerfed to where the MK17 is now a more valuable choice and Dokkaebi‚Äôs other primary is a meme Shotgun. That‚Äôs the reason they gave her two SMG sidearms because she needed something to keep her alive at close range. 
---
They could lower the recoil on the SMG-12 a little because outside of knifing distance, the gun has too random recoil to be useful, sight or not, and you could go single shot mode but then it would be worse than using the DMR. The CZ-75 has replaced it.
---
nah I meant I can‚Äôt access it entirely. It doesn‚Äôt show the text bar to type in
---
I did
---
I personally do not care that much about his "rework" but I love that they finally adressed his V308.
---
Try restarting your computer/console. If that doesnt work delete and reinstall. Seems to do the trick 9 times out of 10 with any piece of tech for me
---
Find squads on lfg posts
---
Yeah watching Youtubers and Streamers play the chat looks like its mainly used to explain why its BS that you died, accuse someone of cheating, or insult people. At least if someone wants to do that on PS4 they have to go out of their way to message me lol.

I got Clash which has worked out decently
---
IQ can be an OK fragger, but Ash is definitely better. IQ‚Äôs guns do high damage, but have a slower rate of fire and have more kick

yeah, it was either him or bb, and bb isnt fun lmao

how

Speak for yourself... in my experience they‚Äôre everywhere in gold and above

I play the other games on the same connection
---
Is that Steven segal?
---
Contact Ubisoft Support - they're known to slide people a credit in times like this :)
---
Jackal has to enter the building and enter an area where defenders have been recently, hence the risk and his reward being less than that of Lions.
---
Cav is extremely high risk with the best reward.
---
I would love an option which let you only join matches in progress. But then again that‚Äôs basically the ‚Äústart‚Äù button
---
I will, i‚Äôm you over 5000 Elo right now, if Mnk is not that big of a deal to me, I find it hard to believe it‚Äôs a problem in gold.
---
r/2healthbars?
---
There was a cheater on your team, someone got banned for cheating. They may not have been cheating in your game, but they were cheating at some point.
---
It‚Äôs the least played game mode, a lot of people turn it off on matchmaking settings so there‚Äôs not many people who play hostage
---
I already tried that and it didn‚Äôt work
---
You needs to come back and play with us. üòÅ
---
ikr lol this was on EU though, I play NA. i play some EU when i need a break or trying to stop facing the same people
---
Ash Mains: I will make it legal
---
I called it but I was really hoping I was wrong
---
Play ranked
---
it was a solid 5v2 and this was the 2nd game I have played in a week xD
---
Was this supposed to be funny?
---
The ultimate cover
---
thank you i just want to see what the majority of people use and so far i am among them
---
They should just reward people for joining already.  
---
20-50% bonus renown, you don't lose MMR for Ranked, etc.
---
I got nomad, she's ok but I'm not digging her gadget, good guns tho.
---
Haha I‚Äôve came against 350+ before
---
All the more reason to find fun ways to kill her.
---
The fat shit talker playing ash
---
Yeah I thought of that but it's still pretty annoying joining 5 0-2 games in a row
---
I'm pretty sure my first shot hit the floor beam :/
---
Who call it bombera ?
---
If you‚Äôre going to push obj or  maintain danger close with Roamers, than holographic is very useful.
---
That is strong, I've seen people use it to great effect but haven't pulled it off myself.
---
$600 for the game or pc?
---
He got a extremely lucky shot
---
yes i know that i've got shitty aim, but i still managed to get that 1v4 (kinda)
---
Just play solo that‚Äôs what I did
---
I run Flash Hider, ACOG and Vert. Grip.
---
What could it be worse? üò•
---
Lol
---
almost
---
Chest shot with a smg, with a surpressor, at long range
---
I‚Äôd like to play with them to help them learn too. It‚Äôs great to learn by themselves, but they‚Äôll pick it up quicker if I am able to help them understand strats and the overall meta.
---
I use it on guns that I'm not good at controlling recoil, so I'll throw it on buck or twitch if I play them.
---
Giving up team play shouldn‚Äôt have to be the answer though.
---
Neck shots count as headshots.
---
I have toggle on everything but ads. It seems more difficult to have to walk and hold a separate key to lean (or even crouch)
---
I just wish that people weren‚Äôt so anti social on ranked if you‚Äôre solo queuing. Ominous silence on high gold low plat is not a recipe for success. Party chats are the bane of my existence in this game.
---
Ash is on defense
---
The closer you look the funnier it gets
---
Try crouch slow walking whilst leaning with them all on hold.
---
Because who the hell likes hostage you weirdo
---
Ive done the same thing a thousand times. I've come to realize that RB6 isn't like cod. You don't have thatchers knife on you, even when you are thatcher its gamble if you get the kill.
---
Clearly was a joke m8
---
Reminds of when I use to play fortnite. I was trying to get xp for new drift versions and ended up getting to 49999/50000.
---
Hurt my soul.
---
Ok I thought you were for real and thanks for not woooshing me
---
Cough cough*  five nights at Freddy‚Äôs

Never brother ü§ô
---
Then why are we holding him hostage?
---
Airjab
---
Yep
---
Do better
---
K thx
---
I partially agree that people with high kill potential can get further metaphorically but the thing is R6 is also heavily reliant on map knowledge. Take Shroud for example an absolute insane aimer but he usually dies to someone holding an angle he doesn't know about or a flank he wasn't aware of, the only reason hes in diamond is because he can out aim most opponents in a straight up gun brawl also the fact that he ques with MacieJay and other proffesionals.
---
Yeah compared to the new dmrs it's really bad that's true, I know I still use the r4 despite the lack of acog
---
Sau has got some great comics.
---
No just the regular ones. Shit their scope would be longer then the pistol lmao
---
Ah. Thank you very much.
---
CoreRoss and rouge 9 on YouTube do evaluations on weapons to see which are better for the operator
---
Finka
---
Nice tachy and mozzie
---
In addition to what was already mentioned (less noise and no threat indicator for enemies) using a suppressor also removes all muzzle flash, which is nice. Sometimes muzzle flash can make it difficult to maintain visibility on your target while you're firing.
---
That Chanka was about to bamboozle you so hard
---
And he would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling Frenchies!
---
NO WITCH HUNTING REEEEEE

I meant his gu mines that do half of the damage they did before

Same

Woah , siege has come a loooong way since I took a break from it a few months ago ... think it‚Äôs time to strap up the boots

now if only it would do that on console for going against asshole kb/m users

Behold your God

Wait what does any of this have to do with thatcher?
---
LMAO NO! that sounds amazing!

so who got whoooshed now?

It depends mostly on how big your hand is , if your hand isn‚Äôt big enough for the high rise it‚Äôs gonna always be off .

It probably is, but I currently have money in my steam wallet that I would rather spend directly through steam.

I do agree on that, map knowledge is the key for R6. I can say that I don‚Äôt know almost all spawn peeks on all maps, but I know one here and there, also how to rotate and etc, but the thing that screw me all the time is timing and aim. Most of the matches I‚Äôm holding an angle, and then I just look to another direction and bam, I‚Äôm dead. 
---
Beyond this point about gameplay and map knowledge, the worst thing I notice on ranked matches are the toxicity between players and teammates. People for some reason like to say how good they‚Äôre and highlight how bad you are or something like it :/
---
Times to use Lion's ability:
---
* Right before making a solo or coordinated push
---
* When your teammate using Blitz is in combat or about to enter site
---
* When a teammate is planting the defuser (and again during the defuse phase when the defenders are trying to retake)
---
* When you need to buy some time to revive a downed teammate
---
Took me a solid 2 minutes to figure out what was wrong in this pic
---
i didnt delete shit

Great, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE THE DEFUSER!?!?!

I use the bosg often as both dok and vigil. Once you get used to it, i find to be the most satisfying gun to use.
