Add a way to view kill cams at the end of the match, but not during the match. Not having them is very nice

I see you drop doughnuts daily you scrub, 1v1 me you fucking little shit cunt.

Hmm. I guess I'm just a fluke then.

That takes a lot of guts to do

No problem

The “No Russian” strat is when you pick Russian recruits all with the 6p41 and rush the objective. Try it out. It’s fun af

I see you have less then 20 karma, your opinion is invalid

Yeah, I remember seeing that and then they changed it, and changed it again, and the steam page isnt right.

Mhmm, thicc is more than just a big ass.

 Fight me, you know where to find me

It's completely white with like 10% of it being random colors, not that "dope" to be honest.

When you hear about them not spawning for 1000 hours ... For 1000 hours? That sounds like a choice.
---
Chalet and Kafe are my favorites. I really wish they would add University back and get rid of theme park. 
---
... try both and see which one you like? We can't choose for you mate. It's all personal preference. If you generally take long-ranged fights (against spawnpeekers for example) you'd probably prefer an ACOG. If you find yourself getting into close range engagements often maybe you'd want a 1x.
---
*dead inside*
---
More please! That’s sick! 
---
yes like i said, there are ban waves for very bad cases occasionally. 
---
Echo is the one i see more often than not over Clash
---
Then isn’t it an exploit?
---
 But we forgot one thing... NANOMACHINES SON
---
People actually trying? Watch the spawn peaks, drone. People are playing it like tanked right now because it’s better than ranked.
---
You get the ban hammer for toxicity or hackincity?

Shut up, you fucking bitch. Ethnicity =/= nationality. Rhodesians never die jajajjajaj

---
Why can't we care about what's broken AND shitpost?
---
Nah its totally a nail gun.
---
Just remember that in casual there are really no stakes so it doesn't matter if you lose. If you want to play with the mindset to win every match you should play ranked, as in casual the priority for other players isn't always to win.
---
Did you have 2f authentication enabled?

That smug Mira face is an instant classic.

This is why it'll continue to be hidden behind gambling packs :/

Hey look at [this particularly useful page I found](https://support.ubi.com/en-AU/Faqs/000027081/Reporting-a-player-in-Rainbow-Six-Siege-R6S#CS) by searching "r6s report player".
---
There is [an actual reporting system](https://support.ubi.com/en-AU/Cases/New). I'd suggest providing evidence, maybe spectate them if they're shooting through walls/aimbotting and record it.
---
My only ever encounter with cheaters was two of them on my team in a ranked game. I noticed they were both aimbotting, so I killed myself and spectated them. Uploaded the relevant footage and sent it to support through a ticket.
---
Get a squad. Honestly is the only way.
---
Rip Tachanka, my main
---
Do the csgo system where it gets slower amd slower
---
Just realized that Mira sound like mirror. I'll never be the same.
---
How dare they
---
Which means that the reporting system does work.
---
[removed]
---
thank you, I'll take note of that, 
---
One agent has said that not to worry. I have also emailed battle eye to see if they can assist since its been a couple of days and ubisoft is not yetting any info from their internal team
---
yes, round 9 we end up 4vs3 when 2 of them quit already lol
---
1. Did you accept the challenge?
---
2. Did you destroy the drones in the event playlist?
---
Rook and doc are getting nerfed to 27 MP5 damage.
---
Kgs?
---
Oh I see. I still stand by my comment 
---
Nah, at the very end when I slow it down you can see it’s on the upper right side of her head and the gun fires. 
---
Thank you
---
Oh no, I'm not disagreeing, I'm just pointing out my original post.
---
If I remember correctly Alibi is from South Africa but she and her father moved to Italy when she was a child, I was kinda confused when I first played her and realized she was a bit more melanin infused than I had thought
---
Did you know that some people are below platinum level?
---
Pretty much the idea of what I said. I might’ve been more okay with your first thought before, but this new event made me realize how poorly it could translate to the masses 
---
It was not a client issue, my internet has had no problems, nor has my ping been high

boi sit yo ass down, Ela got curves like a Celtic knot 
---
The big problem of the new event in my opinion is that everyone is extra toxic probably cuz it’s casual 
---
I didnt know that piece of lore but thanks for telling me. It makes sense then. Maybe it looks off to me cause I started in para bellum so I saw a lighter skinned one most of the time.

You win 23 in a row your plat 1 not silver 4

In his shootout makaorv downed his teammates, and they bled out after he left the game. Finka managed use nanomachines that saved her from getting downed
---
that is looking awesome
---
Finka really is pyrocynical 
---
Fax
---
That true too
---
I don’t mind it honestly. Gu’s and good flanks usually work. So imo blitz is about as good of a ban as cav. Cav does have a pistol shotgun which can be rough. 
---
If you say so bro.  I'm tired of the Devs doing amazing things and people still bitching.  Can you find a better way?
---
I used a acog on everything, and had no option because it was the only sight I bought
---
Console things...
---
It could be, but I don't really think it is a bug. Because whenever you down some regardless, they don't ever have this immunity.
---
what does crouch/lean spamming do?
---
I’m not so sure. I’ve seen enough of that “ toxic behavior” in ranked the know it’ll be pretty much the same. 
---
elites, credit only outfits, save for next pack fiasco
---
Yeah true
---
"OP has been banned for being boosted by a cheater"
---
This is honestly the coolest thing Ubi could have done for the game, amazing event, new play list, interesting artwork as the UI screen. I love it.

You just have to have friends to play with who are chill 
---
Unless you have proof on the overhead costs of running the servers, paying the dev team, and running Pro League costs, then your argument is pointless. And that's just listing the obvious factors that would be costly.

The reason you’re not amazing is because you use red dot.  Yeet that holo. But congrats on the play, surprised you pulled it off with red dot.

Ive heard the ash tiny head thing is only a meme and in reality its same size as iq mav etc other 3 speeds.ill try to look up the video.

Can I have aids over the cancer please

Not really. That's about her in-game skin colour. She's Libyan, but given her last name is de Luca it's never been explicit whether or not her family were actually Italian settlers expelled by Qaddafi.
---
Who wouldn’t 
---
Depends on the map honestly. Big maps like Bank I would use ACOG, maps with fewer long lines of sight a 1X is probably better, though which one is personal preference.
---
I had someone trade rook armor for drone kills. He would come outside armor in hand and we would throw down our 2nd drone. It was great to help people finish the challenge.
---
Dude is a walking box
---
Yes we get it its annoying, but there's about 12 posts a day on this subreddit about this.
---
i want to download it ;-;
---
I'm really wishing I had upgraded to Nanomachines like Finka did.
---
Same, but for an OP I never use sadly
---
lmao i was so triggered i thought it was my plat game
---
You are condoning that activity with this post. Saying you don't condone doesn't nullify the content.

Now which arm should I choose
---
she traps me in place what am i supposed to do embrace my inner season 2 and headshot her through her shield 
---
I like how Mira (hope that's their name...) isn't at all fazed by the sudden interruption, as if to say "heh, would've told you but now i don't have to..."
---
Wait. Can I show you a magic trick
---
You'll get em next time dude. 
---
How about I do one instead 
---
Yeah ps4 east coast. 
---
Instantly - lock on, shoot.
---
"Sorry. Watch replay camera." - they say, every god damn time.
---
True.
---
Yeah ps4 east coast 
---
It's because plat and diamonds run 5 man stacks and its easier to pit 5 man on one team than put few randoms here and there together to form 5 man. The matchmaking prioritize faster matchmaking over ranks (since this is a new playlist and is technically a test playlist), more matches means more results hence better future gameplay. Sir. 
---
I got 2 😂😂
---
but we're gonna get 5 total free packs, 3 more to go, that's over $5 you could've saved
---
Its not i just loaded into the game and this was there, my shadow play was off and, I dont  have all the oops so i couldn't test it
---
Someone died to an acog defender boohoo...
---
Ha, like it's that low
---
Really? My games are full of people not even reinforcing because they’re too busy hunting drones and accidentally downing each other as bullets fly every which way around the room.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No thanks.  Turn around there's a person with a shotgun behind you.
---
I agree, I've been loving it. It's been quite a while since I've enjoyed Siege this much.
---
i’m not playing til i’ve got at least 3 of my friends on lmao
---
Nah I think I’ll do mine instead,I’m gonna make one of your arms disappear 
---
This is a funny thread
---
Tbh they should totally add two ghost recon operators as a season CTU.
---
Ah it's to bad. Rook really didn't want to pull the trigger.
---
Because it’s a bug you know that exists right?
---
Wait rook was really behind me
---
Yup can confirm it can be used as an example for terrible in a dictionary 
---
I think a graphical glitch tbh, was only able to play one round as i joined into an ongoing match
---
Just save up for the best deal
---
Yep go ahead and turn around. Take a look.
---
Shit
---
Nope never knew
---
He already got rid of Blitz
---
I'd like to know who's the most absolute unit too.
---
The higher it costs, the value per renown is higher. If you don’t have any operators to buy, save up for 50 alpha packs.
---
Hmm haven’t run into it her yet since her smg got changed.  Did it really make that much of a difference?  Isn’t her switch time still really bad?
---
You know what the best part is? Now you have two shotguns pointed at you.
---
This game needs actual lore
---
Friend got it on free pack #1 rip
---
...how about a nerf
---
doesnt really matter that much
---
🎵Salut have you seen me, vespoli, scaffolding. Stole tea from a yeti who lives like a ruuuuuus! God shaves a wall today... 🎶 
---
No?
---
Anyone?
---
The S.I mode is amazing I have been non stop playing it. Choosing where to spawn in casual would be great and teach new players how to defend in certain areas and you get to choose the best op to defend or attack the obj. 
---
I’m on console and it’s fine. I use it for close range on Doki and it’s good. 
---
That only effects our MP5. We still got shotguns. Without a nerf. Fairwell
---
I am sorry okey. This is the first time I did something like this. I never knew that image was copyrighted and was being sold. I changed it to gradient now but can't edit the post so I might even delete this
---
Thank you very much for your help
---
M8 I’ll ask my friend dreamworks 
---
I get the reasoning but the problem is that it's not facilitating a good game mode at all and not really getting you to learn the maps either. People get bored and quit out, a shorter timer and people rushing the objective would do as good of a job at teaching them the levels. When 4 minutes was the standard in ranked it was 3 minutes in casual though, and casual was much more fun for it. If they want people to learn the maps better in casual they'd be better off letting us choose spawn and objective locations so they would learn what is actually what. The main problem right now is that casual just isn't as fun as it used to be and a shorter round timer would at least help that a bit.
---
Yes, THAT is toxic, except I didn't use any offensive words, nor insult OP. If op feels insulted, that's not my fault. I wasn't offensive at all.
---
It's ironic how you rebuke me for being a grown human and not giving a simple answer, yet you are ok with people making repeat posts and aren't telling them how to get answers quickly and efficiently.
---
What do you mean by makes ADS significantly worse? ADS time? ADS sensitivity? New original effect? or just "ADS is a bad idea here"?
---
Seems like a cool idea but strength would depend on how strong the smoke is(completely blocks out your vision attacker smoke or kinda see through Smoke smoke)
---
I mean what
---
Do it!

You would die but not right away

So, a CCTV like mode at the end of the game, composed of every single kill cam against every single opponent?
---
Had a team try to kick me because my kd wasn't high enough for them. 
---
FINALLY!  I was playing with some friends in custom games today, and one of them proceeded to crouch spam with Blitz, then brag about how good he was.  I wanted to fucking strangle him.
---
It was a seasonal skin last season, so no, you can't get it anymore.
---
Yep. That's gonna take **quite a while**.
---
lol I didn't wanna get called out for guessing too high a number but I guess there's no winning
---
What about blitz
---
You have arteries and your throat in your neck you would live for like another 5 seconds
---
You can't act like you didn't say anything
---
Alright brb gotta go to discord
---
see if he’s on
---
I've been having the same problem for a while. Steam Overlay is working for me, and I've been referred back and forth from Ubisoft to Steam, back to Ubisoft, back to Steam.
---
I'll let you know if they find any fix. Good luck.
---
To be honest I think that's a banksy reference.
---
I never said soldiers are just going prone left and right as soon as they see an enemy. But you said they never do it in combat as it would guarantee their death and you’re simply wrong. All that typing and research yet you fail to use reading comprehension 
---
Why comrade
---
Lion face reveal 
---
That makes sense.
---
Nevertheless, a diamond will, even solo, destroy a group of bronzes. I guess if it isn't 5 stacks, then they should match against the average skill, and if it is 5 stack with a low rank, it should be against the highest rank of the party.
---
Same if you got shot through the heart. It’s just a mechanic, it’s not necessarily realistic
---
Lion looking hella chill 
---
Vertical play. Yes. Geisha is a very strong site to hold, but 1 ying can take it down.
---
Fair enough
---
Drones are so useful, but I think knowing bomb locations and such will make it easier for me to find the other team. Defence, I think i need to learn where barricades should be placed
---
They're working on it. Just give them a little time!
---
Wait.
---
You wouldn't?
---
And some people run their games on low specs for higher frames and it can look like shit
---
aaaaaAaAaaAAAAAAAA
---
To be fair tho, they did the same thing with Ela and Zophia.
---
Well that was a shitty design
---
Im sorry, I play with billys friends we dont have a spot.
---
Uhm.... You didn't see anything. 
---
lol
---
Just talking about billy.
---
He ain't wrong, bruh.
---
It's THAT obvious
---
What I meant by makes ADS significantly worse Is that When In the Smoke Is really hard to control Recoil and the Aim Is not stable
---
Kinda see through Smoke but your vision is like a Echo Blast
---
Same time as year 4, +1 year.
---
Get this out of my sights comrade.
---
Lion looks like Chris Pratt
---
I hoped I could get some answers with your post but all the comments are just useless like how hard can it be to just answer the question instead of of taking people for idiots

yea but like I feel like it's been year 4 forever

Whatever you are comfortable with and whatever suits your playstyle.

CQB? 1x.

Long range versatility? ACOG.

Agree. I have been seeing a lot of high plats and diamonds. I play between silver and gold. I will never be that good. I just want it competitive for my skill. Getting the hell beat out of you makes me want to play something else. 
---
She's getting a full auto buff. It's pretty darn good now.
---
he is unstoppable at silver because everyone that plays him is so selfish
---
:D
---
They are all doing casual stuff and nobody is using any of their usual gadgets or weapons. Looks like Alibi is having fun in a range and Finka is timing for her.
---
Lion face reveal? 
---
Wait, people ban fuze?
---
I liek feet
---
I came here to comment it but you beat me to it! 
---
Not op, but annoying.
---
Some people just don't like dealing with Cav.
---
We reached 
---
Because cav is very hard to balance in general, her ability can easily go from underpowered to overpowered very fast. Her win delta is also very high as in win rate
---
Ha, I didn't spend any money, and got the universal skin for free!
---
Well the one single site on which I die to Fuze ALL THE TIME is kafe trains.
---
Being a Mira main there is hard.
---
Woah he called you the w word!!!  The only w word a whore should be called is wonderful!!!
---
Copper 4 lmao
---
post yours then, you have 3 minutes. 
---
He never said it was special. It’s literally a video of something that most of us would enjoy to see. You didn’t have to watch it. Get a move on, will you?
---
Couldn't have said it better.
---
Takes 3-4 shots when ADSing to break a hatch.
---
What evidences will be enough to confirm?
---
If you can't deal with clash/blitz there is something wrong with how your playing...
---
Well.... You ever played Galz?
---
Have you played Road to SI mode?
---
Once you have done so and still feel like you want to invest, then it will be informed choice. What you see there is what the game devolves into. Team killing, trolling and throwing.
---
TLDR: it really depends on your teammates. If they are playing seriously, then you will have a great experience. If they are trolling and meme-ing all the time for content, then it is bad.
---
You are the first "new player" I have seen who claims to like Tachanka aka Russian Turret Dude. Hence suspect you are smurf.
---
Sorry forgot kap traps deal only 50 health at that case he's weak so try other strats
---
Time to ship nomad and mav.
---
she's already getting nerfed though
---
I know fuze can be so good in certain objectives, especially on the second floor of kafe and other places like Arsenal on clubhouse, basement on Hereford and on most objectives of banks first floor but overall fuze is really underpicked and other operators are more useful than him on bomb. I just can’t understand why everyone I play with wants to ban him 
---
*BRING BACC THE CCCP*
---
like I said im just a basement dweller with youtube as source and supporting the argument that drop shooting is plausible in real life compared to crouch-lean spam.
---
in actual practice you cant because the proper technique require you to use your left hand away from your weapon preventing you from aiming. but the other less adviceable method lets you keep your two hands on the weapon, the improper one where you use knees to kneel quickly to go prone.
---
I dont think its possible to sustain a crouch-lean spamming technique in real life considering all the gear.
---
**and yes I agree that going prone is not practical in close quarters.**
---
Was it bank? I think it was like 9 am or some shit 
---
They haven't done it BEFORE. Doesn't mean they won't do it later. Your question was why it hasn't been done, no? I answered
---
Kinda looks like Mechanicsci. What do these strange sysmbols mean?

Welp, there's lion

---
she is so fucking useless if you drone and play as a team. Just play for the trade if you are scared, since she can only down people she is easy to kill with 2 people
---
Pretty sure it was bank but I might be mistaken, I get that map all the time on ranked and casual and the invitational mode hasn’t been an exception (same with Oregon)

I got one pack and that was what I got from it 😂😂💜

---
I tell that to my friends but everytime we lose a round because a random decided to get interrogated they say "see this is why we ban cav, so freaking op"
---
Maybe a crossover with The Division 2?
---
Well... because it is against this subreddits rules? Rule two says: No memes.
---
That would be really cool, but unfortunately not a current feature
---
One updates your screen 120 times a second and the other updates your screen 119.99 times a second.

True. Rightly said. He's fun, with a great gun, but very situational.
---
Yet half the shit on it is memes. Alright makes since mate.

Sometimes they'll tell you in the case, I found out on mine by friend in the guy and he posted on his account complaining abt it

Then you probably haven't seen buck teeth ash.

---
Commando. That gun is so good that IQ was the first operator who I cleared Terrorist Hunt with.
---
ok I'm over it if you want to know more go talk to a recruiter. 
---
I don't mind people really good. I'm talking about people purposefully injuring their team. like when a twitch drones is completely used up on a teammate.
---
Then you’ve got the server hoppers who are diamond on their own servers but are allowed to change to another. Really makes no sense, this person has 40 ping on their own server, 220 ping on mine and you’re going to let them choose to play on it? Automatic server choice isn’t a problem because for those people who aren’t near any specific server, it’s automatically going to choose the lowest ping one for them anyway so there’s literally no downsides
---
Going prone is completely different Lmaoo. They peek corners and crouch too but they don’t just in the middle of a cqc drop to the ground. If you were getting robbed you’d lay down and try to shoot him because it’s a tactical advantage 
---
Just sayin'.
---
Ya he's fuckin cute
---
i thought it did
---
All 3 had their backs turned...
---
Meanwhile  pretty much every game  i got in enemys where just not using drones
---
You're playing bots that's why
---
I’ve been playing rainbow six siege almost since it came out. And all the skins and ops from that point would be nice to transfer everything over! 
---
What?
---
I think this is more than a feature and skills rather than a glitching the game hitbox. This also a skills that needed on movement and quick peaking
---
Among my friend group Zofia is quite a popular choice. But Capitao... that’ll be a fun one. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I’ve seen a couple Tachanka bans..

Wish there was chat on console to coordinate fun stuff once in awhile

Damn... Copper 4? xD

Why does Alibi STILL HAVE AN M9?!?!?!

They seemed like they were normally good players, I don't really blame them. My decision making process was basically non existant in that instant, so it was kind of a "really?" moment.

I got a drone in the hallway and got a call she was coming. My plan was to make her confident enough to peek me slowly... If I would miss I would alert her and she would wait :| I had to kill her first try or I would have been between two enemies ... But it never works as planned ^^`
---
Yeah same. I started on Xbox, went to PC and then I’m more or less back in Xbox, but it sucks that everything can’t be consolidated into one account through Ubi
---
Yeah it keeps angering me too playing it with random though. 
---
Me: hey guys since its border and we're defending first maybe we should prioritize banning thermite since hes really useful for planting on this map. Besides the enemies are probably gonna ban blitz or lion anyways
---
My entire team: FUCKING BAN BLITZ *all 4 simultaneously slam the button voting for blitz*
---
Just saying I like getting rid of broken ops dont ger me wrong but I also like applying some tack to the the bans. Me personally I like to try to get thermite or hibana banned on border and clubhouse and a rusher like ash or blitz banned on maps like villa.
---
Ban blitz
---
Bronze 4 with a 130k renown and over 200 lvl. Wish this was me
---
Exactly! It’s ridiculous the work and money you put into the game and you can’t do that. Fortnite does it no problem, so. 
---
Hopefully we get a Moon season. Moon people have zero representation in Siege. 
---
I am recruit in the new mode which is supposed to be pro league
---
Pro league ready
---
He's immune to his own smoke because he's got a full MOPP 4 suit and he has his own ventilator. When lion and finka came out I thought that they were immune to smoke as they had their suits as well. A few deaths and some angry friends later, I found out that they weren't immune. 
---
ying isnt getting picked a lot
---
again, Alibi with the beretta not a revolver 
---
Well shit, ya got me there.
---
*coghs* iq
---
100% but i didnt really get to experience the full road to S.I. because everyone is worried about the challenge. I hope Ubi makes an official thread to see if this is something the community wants
---
Id love that if lion was aurobanned.
---
You know, I’ve always tried to be good with Ying, but she’s always just been a bad character for me. Every time I throw a candela I freak out thinking I’m going to get flashed. But this is it. I’m finally going to be a Ying player. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
at least you dont get your operator banned each time
---
Haha pretty accurate though. Should've also had an extra panel for Doc.
---
A man of the average human heartbeat
---
Doubt she's underrated.
---
Either because flashes are glitched or people are experimenting temporarily. She's one of the strongest ops in gold and above.
---
Are you insane?!?!? Ying is still meta bc of her ability. I'm jealous if you haven't seen her allot!
---
Awwww
---
Cap, yes.
---
As for defense, after mute got his buff and he's been picked a lot, MAYBE castle, but other than him, nobody.
---
270 with season pass. 300 norm
---
Oh look, they gave Alibi an M9. Again.
---
Well that's not my point. If you had shot at the window the moment it broke while you may have not got her you could have scared her and broken it. You then would have gotten the drop the moment she tried to re peak it or would have been able to atleast get up the vault on the roof before she tried again or even scared her away completely. 
---
Anyways my point is you had like a 80% chance of surviving if you had versus the 50% chance here because  guarentee you even if the game hadn't fucked you she wouldn't have run across the window which due to her cover and such gave her a huge advantage over you
---
i havent seen her once
---
Ah, that’s right, mb
---
Thanks
---
Castle (when played correctly) and Capitao
---
I have legit not faced that even in the new mode.
---
This uniform is so good, I actually like it more than the elite 
---
r/lostredditors
---
Sucks though I'm left with like 154. Cant do anything with that odd #  haha
---
No u
---
just remember,  candelas dont flash you,  only flashbangs do
---
I would love it. I really was hoping the Halloween event would be a wave defense against the zombies. I know they won't let all those assets sit for nothing, though so I'm excited to see what's up.
---
Because they can still counter mavrick especially kaid. Basically so the last hard breacher was still useful 
---
Ash should be autobanned in all gamemodes
---
Oh yeah,I heard that, but what exactly is the relationship?
---
Bans so tactical
---
If you consider changing one meta for another "tactical"
---
Agreed, and I admit I am guilty of playing defense and then leaving.
---
Make this event ranked and pick and ban already on PS4 Ubi 
---
I am unfortunately unfamiliar with the directions. I remember spawns with names.
---
Oh damn... 
---
Are you an actual clash main lol 
---
Level 237 Copper IV...
---
Idk, just played normally and was still able to complete challenge in 2 game sessions 2-3 hours each. And also, what the fuck is wrong with this dudes aim?!
---
Looking at cams. 
---
So cav was searching for her brother in the wild lands (she went AWOL) and six sent in twitch to reel her back in and make sure that she didn't go too far. Valk was also there but she was mainly on comms instead of on the ground
---
I love this idea and I hate this idea. I love it because it actually sounds like a good op. I hate it because I know I’ll get fucked a lot by this op. 
---
youtube videos
---
Yeah, no, just cause you think it would be balanced, it wouldn't be. You'll take away the only thing attacked have to cover up the area disadvantage they have.
---
If it’s still not working for you, you can restart the game and it will be there. I usually have to do this when collecting renown and charms from the challenges.
---
Well to me it seems she's regretting every choice in her life thats lead up to this moment
---
Mainly cause ya can't see her phone
---
You say that as if I’m talking about every attacker. I strictly said three speeds only. 
---
It does, but kill cams are the literal only proof of hackers.
---
As much as I'd love to see them go, given the rampant hacker presence in siege, kill cams are the only way to collect solid proof against a teleporting and aimbotting hackersl.
---
any word on an alpha pack opening video? 
---
no that would be tachanka
---
It's not like 3 speeds spawn next to objective and don't have area disadvantage. All attackers have acogs to combat area disadvantage and time disadvantage.
---
😂😂😂. 
---
Holy shit it actually looks like it. I can't unsee it now. 
---
Yeah ubi needs to understand this.
---
Killing drones in normal for dog tags? Fine. Killing drones in SI for a paid loot box? Bad, bad idea.
---
Wow.
---
Surprisingly, I didn't face that.
---
Maybe ubi didn't calibrate it yet.
---
Finka and alibi looking like dudes lmao
---
Once you see it
---
You'll never unsee it
---
Relax.
---
Ubi said they are addressing this.
---
And ranked is in beta after 3 years
---
Is everybody gonna ignore the fact their rank is copper 4
---
I still have no idea why people detest Blitz so much. I'd rather have Maverick and Lion banned on offense. 
---
Nope, I changed it for shits ang giggles in one thread.
---
And I had lord before. I don't really main anyone.
---
Can someone explain what qec spamming is
---
There's no option to pick recruit.
---
Won't ever come out.
---
I only have it for the P90 :(
---
Oh.
---
No such intimate relationship, right?
---
Outside a couple situations .... yokai's stunning you repeatedly shouldn't happen. 
---
Yeet
---
No they didn't fuck
---
why？I don't care，It's seem Individual power gap
---
Can we get a spoilers tag on this post, plz?
---
Echo and Maestro, a lazy boy bowl.
---
Because that was a bad thing too. 
---
Lord Chanka is pretty thicc tbh
---
Blitz and cav is hella annoying so I ban them
---
I'm halfway through and gave up. The opponents don't send in their drones to actively prevent you getting the challenge and as soon as we swap to attack whole team leaves and you get left 1v5. Thoroughly disappointed by the challenge and the weapon charms are just shit which of course is what I get. 
---
Yah everyone is getting very jumpy around when it comes to ranked, they will add it and it will likely just replaced ranked, same ranking system just implemented as the permanent system rather than a separate playlist, unless it isn’t but ether or people will be happy. But just give the devs time they can’t release everything daily 
---
IQ is 10kg heavier than me at the same height and I have a thicc butt too.  
---
I also look like some kind of gender-swap of her so....  
---
What about lion and kaid
---
I can suggest you maya for animation and hard surface modeling (vehicles, buildings...) or zbrush for organic modeling (characters, plants...)
---
Ubi pls release these as wallpapers soon :-D 
---
i hope they listen to the community tho i dont know about anyone else about this game mode but i think a pick and ban system in ranked has been suggested for a long time now
---
I Love you people
---
I've seen lots of Mira bans as well. What I usually see during the ban phase is Mira, Ash, Cav, or Echo.
---
My luck apparently really like thatcher because I got his charm and headgear
---
Dwight Frute
---
the maestro wallpaper would have been much better with him smiling at clash. Hell, it would be even better with Clash acting like a normal person
---
Yes it has, they have said previously they have been looking at pick and ban systems for ranked, and I think they are taking in a lot from the community about the playlist and adapting it to what it needs to be. 
---
I was going to, but I replied to your comment and had a 10 minute delay before commenting again.
---
This is the best way to play siege and is honestly so good too see.
---
This game would be a lot more fun Is lesion, Lion, dok were removed. 
---
same here, i would love to just get enough currency for cosmetics rather than a random chance of getting a random item.
---
The reason why I never drink a lot
---
That's the one i was takling about. 
---
They don't have global abilities tho 
---
I haven't seen one Ash ban in close to 50 matches, funny how people experience different bans
---
#Someone please make live wallpapers of these.
---
180-220 
---
Shhhhh, she’s the only dlc op I own
---
Imagine thinking some french dude it thiccer than out bae
---
I hardly play casual, we were just playing it because we had the matchmaking error for ranked so we decided to mess around 
---
Me and my friend opened our pack at the same time when we logged on and each got it so we assumed that you get it for sure on the first pack. Then my other friend gets on and gets a shitty headgear and we realize how lucky we were lol
---
The 4 minute round timer of current casual benefits the attackers while defenders basically get nothing out of it. 3 minutes is the sweet spot for attacking.
---
Oof
---
I wish we could see bandito snortin cocaine 
---
Well I bought 17 and just because I want the dokka skin and well... I gut all the gun skins and charms and some head gears but not the fucking dokka uniform... Feels bad man
---
The problem with lean/crouch spamming is that people are using macros and scripts to abuse it. That's unfair and it's more or less the only times I have issue with it. The speed at which it spams is just downright ridiculous. 
---
Possible with 2 speed operator?
---
I love week 3 and 4's
---
Its Maestro dude...i’m talking about the 1st screen, Clash and Maestro
---
Make casual the current ranked with less rounds, no OT, and the casual map pool. SI the new ranked but with all ranked maps. I've never ever played 3 maps in a row before same map until this play list came out. Plus I miss chalet and kafe. I know people don't like those maps but they add variety.
---
I also wouldn't mind keeping just pick and bans and plant defuse time for bomb that's it and keep ranked the way it is. Picks and bans (decrease ban time to 15 seconds instead of 30 though).
---
People are so eager to "support the game" yet they're the reason ubisoft doesn't remove lootboxes despite the likes of EA, Warner Bros, Activision doing so. 
---
I have 2 ot 3 of those and they're as ugly as rest of skins
---
Dude just click on his head lol /s
---
Lol
---
Damn.
---
That's a little too much. Has to be a visual bug.
---
u/TheGybberishGod 
---
Macros are 3rd party software, even if they are integrated in the mouse and will get banned. Modifieing the game files with scripts also gets you banned. Crouch spam is not the problem, soft-hacks are. In fact you have an adventage over an crouch spamming guy cuz he has to spam C all the time and then aim at the same time, also the stuff with broken hitboxes is just a chopper myth. 
---
I've played like 50 games in this Playlist and it's usually Blitz Echo Mira Cav Monte Lesion.
---
problem is the lens he's using won't be able to focus that close
---
I think that having too many game mode increases queue time. 
---
r/woooosh
---
So.......pros are silvers?
---
Might wanna cut down on whatever you were smoking.
---
I'm usually too busy defending against the run out to worry about camera!

When exactly did this happen? Before the match, or mid?

Nice
---

---
This is an awesome concept!
---
Kill cams have a ton of desync right now.  They really aren't an accurate representation of what happened.
---
yeah ok this is where i draw the line, we need operation health 2 this game is broken. 
---
Bro, you didn't even remove the signature. Besides /u/sau-siege posts the art here regularly.
---
You cant kill an enemy neither from a meter, what the heck Ubisoft
---
Woah man your insane
---

---
Sigh... Thanks. If that changes let me know please :/
---
It's canon she's lost two fingers, I'm unsure how, though
---
Can console users be toxic if there is no letters on gamepad?
---
Well, tell that to Ubisoft and the ones in pro league.
---
Although it doesn't, nonetheless opfor can still spot you more easily so you will die more often.
---
I think dying is a better option when you try to scream help me through the mic and your other team mate Leroy Jenkins into the obj.
---
This is a common trend in ANY game that has a pro scene nowadays. Doesn't matter if it's DOTA, LoL, CSGO, R6S, whatever. The toxicity is really starting to get out of hand to the point where it's oozing everywhere and ranked is just try-hard casual with ranks now. It's impossible to communicate with anyone, be it Ranked or Casual, or even the Discovery MM. 
---
Same
---
Can we get these images as a stand alone? It would make a good desktop wallpaper imo
---
Yeah, I really hope we can buy the things we actually need and not gamble in the packs. 
---
All I can do is give you original hires png file
---
*YES*
---
Someone started talking shit about being toxic were telling jokes and fucking around a bit. I topfragged, my friend was second, and the guy that was complaining got banned for teamkilling us both. 
---
Which models did get meshed together there? I only reognize the gu
---
It is to prevent killing downed enemy accidentally by spamming shots so Caveira can get chance to interrogate.
---
Made them already check Operation Fallen God :D

Electroclaw is under the metal grate on the red circle, you put the shield just in front of the wire so its a few feet in front of the door so the enemy cant use the shield as cover, but they cant walk around it and have to vault over. If a maverick tries to burn the shield he's an easy kill. The only thing you can break it with is zofia/ash/frag nade afik. It's easy to counter if you've run into it before, but if you havn't it'll slow you down haha
---
No idea, but for some reason you have to wait 8 minutes before commenting again.
---
Try it: try replying to this twice. 
---
Melee attacks are so inconsistent. Sometimes you hit them from 6 feet away, other times you're brushing up against them and it somehow misses. They need a serious rework. Maybe nerf the range but increase the arc at which the knife connects. 
---
Can't do it: 8 minute delay.

6.0 feet ≈ 1.8 metres ^(1 foot ≈ 0.3m)

I have I have won a lot of ranked games purely because of the 80s time and the reduce recoil it helps you win gunfights if you boost and then have your team Rush The objective majority of the time they're going to win because they have less recoil and better guns than people on defense and her with shotgun is broken she enforces rushing the reason rushing is such a problem is because there's no real counter to it while she does combo the best with blitz you don't need him
---
Not your bad at all.
---
That's how mafia works
---
You can if you program the scroll wheel itself to a keystroke.
---
There are several locations where windows lead to outside and only one vaulting is needed to get to hostage and leave room.
---
Probably will later. 
---
I think they should do a Clash elite with hair.
---
 That was sick ngl 
---
I don't believe that he is busted, just unfun to play against, like dokkaebi, although dokkaebi wont come rushing at you at the speed of a slightly overweight donkey, while making you wish you were born blind.

Kaid is a cat lover, and you can't convince me otherwise

This is a horrid rule and you know it. Half the damn content on here sometimes is memes and nothing is done.
---
The title would be totally different had he pressed C or lean before Chanka killed glaz...
---
I guess it's a natural thing. I usually perform my best in a clutch scenario, if my teammates are silent and let me focus fully. IRL I also perform better in my job under pressure.
---
is anyone able to get these pictures with out the UI in it?
---
This operater would be good for new comers to learn the importance of sound in r6
---
I can't believe that happened 😭
---
This was so  exciting  ..
---
i don't know if it's because of the music and slow down xD
---
I don’t know why it’s so hard to give players a maximum of 60 seconds of additional loading time. If it takes any longer the round starts without you. 
---
Kind of feel bad for anyone who conceived/drew the picture, it’s good and all just nobody would want it on the front screen of anything.

no hát, ezt így külön még nem is láttam. Szép.

"Does not effect smoke due to smokes incredible foresight."

Assuming that there 800 items you could get in an alpha pack and there are about 40 black ice skins available that would give you a probability of 0.05 so pretty rare

Don’t start digging yourself a hole :)
---
The only thing I don't like is that you have to play three rounds of defense and three rounds of attack in a row. I'd rather the rounds alternate from the beginning.
---
was a fun experience for me at least. dk why
---
can u make one for buck?
---
Yes, I played nearly 50+ S.I. Games and ended up on blue team first 46/50 times. I don’t really care cause I like attack anyway but it was really weird always being blue team first.

CS gas is a thing that wouldn’t be a stretch at all to implement. YouTube BCT gas chambers to see fresh recruits puking their guts up.

Does it show while playing too? It’s likely from your audio drivers showing where sound it coming from. Nahimic is one app that will cause it.

I bought the starter edition when I went from console to PC just to try out siege and not spend a lot of money on a game I already owned for console. I regret not buying the standard edition as it’s much harder to unlock the first year ops because they cost more.
---
What do the "banned for toxic behavior" pop-ups mean then? I always thought they were for people like this.
---
I was like, why 9? Oh, theres 9 other players

Yea

Making it too big for doors is a good idea. When you put it like that, it's debate should be nerfed. Maybe 50 hp when you're just under enemy so it's unable to kill unless event is really low

I got it in my first pack

Claire took the fucking kids

I have 215k renown , 300+ charms and in two free packs I got , I received 2 charms .

Did you legit [save this pic](https://displate.com/displate/809874) and post it up here when they asked you to make one?

OK, then I'm doing something wrong :'D  
---
Thx for the response!
---
If that’s how you interpret it then that might indicate it’s the truth lol
---
Nah It’s probably just an artwork 
---
Boi none of them are fym?  You can be against both of those ideas because both of them aren’t viable in cqc situations.
---
That’s the peoblem with this whole thing. Everyone, *everyone* wants to ban him and it’s absolutely useless because they have no fucking clue how to make him useful. I don’t, and I have a 5 stack of plats, the diamonds we play against don’t, like no one does. So stop fucking banning lion you’re not as good or tactical as you think you are. I know that lion needs a rework and is broken, but for 99.9999999999% of players lion won’t affect them. 
---
Having being around that age demographic I can say that not all 13yr olds do this but yes a lot of them do I am actually surprised cuz I haven’t seen much toxic behavior against women on console is it bad on PC

Thee dudes ( TKBreezy and EE ) who do the Super Smash tournaments are pretty guc

He is not actually banned by the game itself in PL. ESL rules dictates that you're not allowed to pick him (or Kaid and Nomad).
---
Wort?
---
*how to delete other people's posts*
---
literally proving my point with your comment. you said i have something wrong with me just because i cant stand idiotic recruit comics and “wholesome” posts that are begging for likes.
---
Week 4 is the best. 
---
And with a Lion rework hopefully that has people cooling it with immediately banning him and maybe they’ll really look over the map
---
Bothers me how gasmasks dont really do shit in the game, i mean i know its just for looks and in terms of balancing it shouldnt block gasses but it still bothers me
---
He's shit it's for his own good 
---
That's hardly elite material

And what does your hate achieve? Why do you feel the need to commit a half hour arguing about it instead of just leaving?

Yeah, that's the kind of thing I'm hoping to promote with my comment.  I would prefer if they just said we know it's a problem but we're not sure how to fix it right now, but we're working on concepts over saying nothing.
---
I think a huge part of the problem there is, they are more than a little hamstrung with their fixes based on the fact that they have to go through MS and Sony, that coupled with the fact that since M&amp;K on console are just controller emulators it's nearly impossible to detect. 
---
Not neccesarily
---
Breathing in anything other than typical air can be bad for you. You just asphyxiate from lack of Oxygen 
---
Meaty Whack
---
This shows hos bad the community is. Instead of thinking they just ban Lion who isn't even played in ranked often...
---
With a holo? I'd have assumed shotty 
---
Well OP typically hatches are indoors. If they’re on the highest roof layer of the map then it’s typically because you’re not supposed to be able to drop hatch then rappel up. 
---
Maybe they could make an operator for that reason but I don’t know 
---
Shouldve left them as they were, people are so prude lol
---
Clearly he loaded blanks into his gun before hand, all OP’s fault
---
He’s just salty he wasn’t there to screw everything up for the other 9 and ruin their fun.
---
sweet &lt;3
---
no, that’s a holographic sight in the picture. I was using Castle’s UMP 
---
yeah, but i don't want to write first
---
Got the clip? 
---
I have a feeling it is because it really wouldn’t  work out well. It would only work a select few times, you would probably get shot. An when it does work, it would be very strong but I have a feeling it would rarely work. Maybe they could introduce an operator that could do this?
---
“This operator has a bear trap.”
---
I don’t know what I was expecting. 
---
I find you everywhere man
---
Oh shit week three we gotta go kill that damn meatball

How is this garbage
---
maybe its because you looking on little reddit iframe, if you go full screen you will see that its not so good :)
---
Cursed Image
---
Same 
---
Isn’t nomads ability technically a rasengan? 
---
I didn’t unfortunately, just the screenshot. I was wallbanging the back wall in Wine Cellar into Blue Garage on Chalet with Castle’s UMP. 
---
I didn’t have to see this
---
This has been posted since year 1
---
What why!?
---
Damn that's some weird shit, just wondered if it was Cavs pistol and you switch to the shotty before the screen shot. :) 
---
Lol I gotta go to class I give up mate good luck
---
Defenders ban first though, so attackers will have to intentionally shoot themselves in the foot and ban the other main hard breacher for it to happen.
---
I think thats the rework for the lord which they been talking about :/
---
Finka checking out alibi’s ass...
---
"Sticks a EMP breach charge one the wall"
---
One for me sire
---
Or you can make another account just to report again
---
Bet you won't send it to me either
---
YES!
---
the thing I don’t understand is why don’t they just nerf them really hard whilst they go about reworking them- give lion one scan or make them last 1.5 seconds instead of three, something like that. The same goes for blitz. 
---
Tasteless and Artosis, Synderen and ODpixel, Kaelaris and Apollo.
---
because its a video game, and if you cant ADS 2 seconds after running out of a smoke cloud you have no chance to fight even after being forced to move
---
Bullets do not hurt Lord Tachanka. 
---
no jokes allowed?
---
She has my highest win loss ratio. I really like playing her in certain situations
---
Do you have anymore of those free screenshots?
---
so wait? you want to create another Ubi account or something? Why not just use your cosmetics account?
---
Did BE ever care?
---
lord tachankas is untouchable
---
it’s not toxic it’s being British lol sorry 
---
I actually liked the 3 then switch format.  I felt like I got a better feel for the way the opposing team defended/attacked a site this way.  Same thing for correcting problems in our defense (not so much attack because the site changed if the defense won).  It also changes the bans a bit.
---
The smaller map pool did start to feel repetitive.  I would like to see it increased (current ranked minus Hereford and Fortress would be my preference), but I understand that most (if not all) of the maps not in the PL list have problems in high level play.
---
Lion uses a flying aircraft that hovers which gathers intel. Attackers use a rover - type mechanical device with a camera and wheels to scoop for intel. Both devices work in completely different ways except for the common denominator - they both gather information. As the cloaking device on vigils back removes himself from the visual aspect of the drone it would defeat the mechanics behind lions drone, it hunts for movement rather than visuals - which is what vigils ability is built on.

Hello prepareforpapajohns, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/akoba8/10_second_4k_with_a_quick_ace_to_finish_it_off/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Couple of ideas I can see coming:
---
-Attack-
---
- Stealth drone operator 
---
- A fourth hard breacher (1 speed)
---
- Another dedicates soft breacher
---
- Camera operator on attack
---
- Electronic device locator/remover
---
-Defence-
---
- Jäger alternative 
---
- Deployable shield operator 
---
- Hole blocker
---
Bro match chat is twice as toxic as voice. People from both teams talk shit it's bad. 
---
It’s a Nvidia Clip turned into a gif. My graphics are fine I have a 980TI. 
---
How do you climb up whilst holding a gun. 
---
That would be a great QoL change.  At least we can ban Blitz and Lion tho.
---
3-stacks ar OK as long as the opposing team has at least a 2-stack, but 4-5 stacks should never be matched against 3-5 solo players. It just makes matches unbalanced and unfair.
---
I second this. If you like trap operators, then frost is your woman. Also Blackbeard can have 3 lives with that shield.
---
20-20!?
---
You the man!
---
I just want them to remove the injured notification, like on pro league and we're Gucci
---
wait so now you can ban operator in rank?
---
The penetration through the wall reduces the damage and damage dropoff over range causes it do less damage to anywhere on the body. It's just like shooting through walls to reset teammates with less than 10 HP. If you shoot them without shooting through the wall they die, but shooting through the wall causes a down. 
---
I personally think the females I've come across are waaaaay more toxic than some toxic guys ive encountered 
---
Cosmetics don’t transfer platforms
---
i meant that if i start on pc with the same acc it'll be from nothing and things i bought like pl skins will stay on ps4. 
---
What i meant by this post was that cosmetics would be linked to your acc rather than platform
---
He had AirPods.  You wore wire headphones.  
---
I hope so
---
Hmm? What I meant is if you play PS4/Xbox you can change that in the settings on the website as it's default is PC player search.

Nah fam I have AirPods too. Only difference is he had no home button.

Sounds like you’re just bad against shields
---
Why is Glaz's gun so broken? 
---
interro is a commie
---
No, it is game mode that is out at the moment because of the Invitationals.
---
well not anymore we can’t! Kinda sucks the mode is only weekends 
---
Yes.
---
We like to think that our society has progressed so much and while it has, when people are behind the safety of their screens it really shows that the community as a whole hasn’t progressed as far as we thought. How many people start screaming the N word on voice chat, hell how many people say it on reddit? And you have sexists and you have just venomous assholes that might not show their true colors in public. I feel like people think anonymity brings out the worst in people but I feel that it just brings out the actual person that they are
---
No, you never saw nomads gadget laser, but it was blinding as hell if someone pointed it at you.
---
I just picked Bandit and used shock wire at the top of steps.
---
Sadly it says destroy attacker drones while defending, not that I went two games as twitch drone hunting my team drones to no avail
---
&gt;Kinda sucks the mode is only weekends
---
Fuck.  It should be permanently implemented in Ranked imo

All I wanted was Mira's headgear, My poor wallet can't take this abuse any more.
---
Bandit batteries, Kaid things, mute jammers, yokai, elas dildoes, red dot/holo sights to add a few more. Thatcher is a reaaaally helpful op. 
---
Because I have as bad of luck as OP. I'd spend $50 and still not get the one item that I actually want. It's frustrating as a player, who enjoys customization, to be hindered by  shitty marketing.
---
There's like 4 things out of this 25 that I'd pay to have. The issue isn't paying for cosmetics. The issue is paying for a random cosmetic that has to be the potential to be what I want. I'm not going to buy all 25 packs so that I can have the 4 I want. That's not how I want to spend my money. I got pulse's stupid ass charm for free. That's my kind of luck.
---
People don't spend money if they don't see the value in the product. I.E: People don't spend $150 on whiskey if a $15 bottle will do. Some people have value in the expensive whiskey, that's fine. For siege, I don't think that 4 items are worth $50 (or $35 or however much I'd have to spend to get those 4).
---
If Ubi isn't going to let me buy what I want, then they're simply not getting my money.
---
They're not, they deal 120 damage, which is enough to instant kill, but are still affected by bullet penetration and falloff as a result of penetration. 
---
I miss blood bath, he would hype you up
---
The text was done on ps4 and assumed to work on pc so yeah as far as I know
---
ok thanks
---
Everyone just bans cab and it infuriates me
---
I enjoyed this video 
---
Stupid mods ruin subs 
---
It's amazing you can buy everything on your list, or (1) 2080ti. Ridiculous!!!!!  To answer your question tho, a 2060 or 2070 will get you 144 (everything max, MSAA off) on 1080p. I have a 6700K &amp; 1080ti on 1440p (everything max, ultra texture, MSAA off) and I get anywhere from 120-180. 
---
Since when is swearing bad
---
Ah yes bringing a bear trap into a modern day terrorist situation muh realism 
---
сука блять
---
Well, I've played it on two consoles and PC; and I'm 99% confident there was no dedicated 'lean' button. Also, I'm pretty sure right bumper was for spotting, because left bumper was definitely for 'nades.
---
Caviera on Coastline. Spas and Pistol from a long range.
---
General reposti
---
I'm pretty sure SI doesn't have replays 
---
geez,imagine getting 'banged' as soon as you join rainbow six.
---
Did you seriously laugh? I cant imagine people like that exist.
---
It does a x40 multiplier, the max health for any given Op would be 140 (120 without Finka, 100 if not counting DBNO).
---
Fed to the rules
---
Kapkan main approves 
---
and also mira windows that dont get ejected.

And they don’t stop coming
---
Classic ubisoft
---
Low effort AND poor taste.
---
Nice. 
---
I have this skin but honestly dont see what the fuss is. 
---
With plant 30 times they would just leave after attack...
---
Kills aren't the only way to get points? I just finished a match with 1 kill next person had 7 and I was above him. Planted every attacking round etc. Clutched 2 times as echo with my drone (denied plant)
---
The people that claim this are usually projecting.
---
Karma roulette? Maybe?

He's wanting to record from Xbox silly goose

40 rounds?

That’s a doc not a rook mmkay

No ,this is how Thatcher says it
---
Look at the reasoning they give. Based on them thinking it would be realistic. Reading...

Honestly his flash shield is the most inconsistent thing ever. I've had flashbangs bo off behind me when I'm staring at a wall and they'll blind me but I can flash Pulse three times five feet away and he's fine .m.

The only way to record gameplay is from the Xbox itself. You press the big XBOX button (the one that glows in the middle) and press X. It'll record the last 30 seconds. Or press the split button (2 boxes to the bottom left) and you'll see you can record up to 10 mins ago.

Oh Glaz. You so silly. I only play as him when I am playing in casual. Otherwise I'm pretty sure I'd rage quit.

I got downvoted for posting about this. A lot of people are not informed about lag switching or the programs that they can use to freeze games through their upload speed. I played a lot of online on console since 2007. Metal Gear Online 2 were littered with these type of hackers.

I want some new CTU's from new countries not like how it was this year with Finka, Liob, Maverick, and Clash being from countries already used

I don't think uniforms drop from alpha packs

The Maverick &amp; Nomad one is awesome. She giving him the look ;)

If you actually played her you’d realize how garbage she is without solid teammates
---
I kinda hate all of them. The style is awful. Oh well
---
Check my other comment where they said it's not allowed?
---
Or Fuck
---
That’s is the most fishy thing I’ve ever seen
---
&gt;wanna-be pro players that play pure solo and give not a single shit about the rest of their team. 
---
Then they're nothing like pro players then :)
---
Nice stats like that kind of thing 👌
---
my trick with glaz is to unload the entire clip because of that entire clip at least 2 must do damage right?
---
It’s not that good. But if you want to watch it sure.
---
You probably downed him and then head shot him on the way down?
---
So above laundry then ? 
---
Id enjoy it more with 35 to 40 BALANCED operators than 100 unbalanced pieces of shits. And unfortunately, that is the direction this game is going in. Unbalanced and frustrating to play against operators. Lion and anyone else with a global ability that only needs 1 button to influence the game. We need more OG operators like thermite, THAT have a WHOLE PROCESS TO GO THROUGH in order to be usefull. Year 3 was an absolute shitshow. This game is going downhill from now. Lmao just the fact that they dont care about rankedsays it all. Hope this game dies faster than fortnite

They don't truly play test R6 console version online to understand where we are coming. They just patch only the concerns on pc and port them to console. 
---
Wait is this the new home screen for this week?
---
Lol i wish
---
And this is related to siege how?
---
Honestly if it isn't these two commentating I probably won't watch the match
---
That's part of your problem too. 50 to 60 is dirt, even for old CRT monitor standards. You'll easily be out peeked and cornered by 144htz monitor running 140fps or better (I sustain 200+ 1080ti)
---
O
---
Why does the mode disappear between weekends? That's such a stupid way of doing a timed event. I love the mode but work weekends so my time is limited.
---
with italian sauce
---
Simple Option: reduce speed of changing stances by 50-100%.
---
I’m hyped for the invitational simply cause they’re revealing more info about the rework. 
---
Pre patch Kapkan was so satisfying. You had to cover the laser with bright floors it was a real mind game
---
1v5 with Pulse on bank, got a quad kill with my nitro cell while being blinded by a blitz and shot the last dude through a wall. It happened the week R6 came out but I still remember it like it was yesterday.
---
He's loading in.
---
You are truly a tachanka amongst recruits 
---
You really think you can kill our lord and savior Tachanka?

Just build lol
---
Diamond armor and sword would have been too overpowered

If someone is curious, here's my cam: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/371290369](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/371290369)
---
I definitely like them I just find it funny that they were having a nice day and then hadto come in and operate
---
You couldn't stand up to the sheer power of our lord and saviour Tachanka
---
It's basically a strat while playing any op on def with a nitro cell. All you do is go prone with a nitro cell in your hand right after someone dies on your team, and wait for an enemy to pass by for him you are gonna be completely frozen almost like a dead and the enemy with decent luck just may ignore you and move on giving you a chance to attack him
---
I suggest Valk. She's pretty fun to play and very useful.
---
I agree that the pick ban phase should be added to ranked, but the rest should stay in pro-league. 3 attack then 3 defend doesn't do anything for me. I will also add that it is nice to pick spawn and obj in a casual match.
---
Yeah I see as well I think maybe because of certain maps I think
---
The left is France, it’s known as Le cock, spelling may be incorrect lol
---
I stayed and messaged the dude that was holding the room hostage. Told him I'm reporting him to ubisoft and the person left after holding the room hostage for 15 min. Game instantly starts. -_-
---
That sounds cool, I’m gonna try this
---
ur shit
---
I know
---
I think I lost my last brain cells
---
I want to see an operator that can use enemies as a meat shield for a certain amount of time. That would be awesome. And his secondary has to be dual wielded desert eagles. 
---
And drop of legendarys were less than 3%
---
I git and instantly pressed aply to all
---
“That’s nothing impressive... oh it was a bomber. Oh my.”
---
Build is overkill for 144FPS on Siege, you can get that with way less depending on settings. So yes this will certainly do it, but don't feel the need to spend that much unless you want to.
---
Dude fuck that noise the hitreg is worse than COD in this game 
---
No witch hunting 
---
!redditgarlic
---
Danny doesn’t need to be related to the sub to be relevant.
---
a lot better than holding two pistols would. It has no place in this game 
---
3 speed no armor op that has a smoke machine and blows into the attackers sights to make them foggy

Imagine plane but you die instead of losing 60 hp while rotating / peeking glaz

Send plox

Frost OP ubi pls nerf
---
I agree completely. Although i play as a trio and we get majority vote we never ban lion but we do blitz. Instead of lion it’s either thatcher or twitch if we want to mira or depends on the map. But at the same time just for fun we run lion, dokkabe and jackal thinking that the other team probably has had lion banned all day so lets fuck with em lol.

This is the video for the strat btw

Big Brain Play!
---
Happened me on xbox too. I was 13 and 3 and the enemy team had a diamond that was being carried from plat one to diamond on europe server (5 stack of americans with high ping) at a 4 4 match point one of them left on the other team followed by a connection loss for us all. The diamond sent me a message saying "lul, u mad?". After checking youtube it appears they are known for it if they end up losing to a legit better team (like mine). Shame it happens but thats the only way these people hold onto ranks they dont deserve. 
---
Yes I see it, why do you think we have 2 Ubisoft reps saying 2 different things? If it was common knowledge that it’s cheating (which is what this whole subreddit seems to think) don’t you think Ubisoft would be able to say with confidence that it’s not allowed if that was the case? 
---
Say I email Ubisoft saying “hey I want to install some hacks on my PC, is this okay?” Do you think we would get the same outcome of some ubi reps saying yes and some saying no?...... That right!..... of course we wouldn’t because it’s stating CLEARLY in the Code of Conduct that hacking is forbidden. Whereas there is nothing that covers the use of keyboard and mouse on console. 
---
You said on console, hence why I posted that. 
---
And they don’t stop coming 
---
I don't get this...

Hello PIXNuva, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/akp9g2/pcnalan_pro_team_looking_for_coach/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
i can’t even hit their feet when the floor is open..how you got a headshot while not knowing where he is AND the floor not open is beyond me
---
No you aren't the only one and it's almost certainly made to test the potential of being added into the game full time.
---
This is first and foremost to promote the Invitationals but while it's not exactly what many people have been asking for it's essentially the lite and safe version of it which is perfect to test if the larger community will actually play it and enjoy it.
---
To say this wasn't hard for them to make is an understatement as it's barely anything more then a set custom match but they need data to see if it's worth added as a permanent extra game mode or even potentially replace casual and o ranked which could divide the player base. 
---
To prove what?
---
I don't even think he was OP on PC. Maybe in ESL, but normal players shouldn't have to suffer changes if they complain. I *very* rarely saw anyone playing Glaz except me. 
---
Same thing with Lion nowadays. People complain about it and maybe in ESL it's broken, but I'm platinum and very rarely I see someone using Lion in an effective way, usually the scans are just wasted.
---
Is her shotty good?
---
While cool, on Oregon I typically play Thatcher and to start the round open up front door and chuck a EMP in to get rid of potential mutes under the hatch for Hibana. In doing so I usually get a lot of collateral gadgets, such as that Ella mine I see on the stairs there and any Lesion traps.   
---
It would probably be worth it to wait a bit before using this trick until you feel they are going to push the stairs or have blown the hatch to make playing laundry a nightmare.
---
I replied to the redditor because he said it wasn’t allowed on the console. That is not true. I know the r6 dev team doesn’t like it (they disabled its usage).
---
This is why I refuse to buy lootboxes. I bought the Blood Orchid skin pack. I knew the price, and was willing to pay for it. Loot boxes make an item a variable price, they bait you into thinking you could get it within a certain amount of money, but when you don't, you get the feeling you cannot stop now otherwise you think you wasted your money on nothing. Its a scam, plain and simple.
---
"This one poster" - This is a comic from SAU\_SIEGE, an artist, the poster here just repostet it, which already makes at least two.  
---
However to get to the basis of your argument, being the ignoring of the rule - comics are not memes. Memes are the usage of templates filled with a specific content to be funny. This is just a funny comic. Not everything that's funny is a meme, just as not every meme is funny. Besides, do you really think the common "Reached plat", "Look at the daily blitz 1v3", "Literally Unplayable" posts are any better in correspondence to rule 9? They've pretty much become memes at this point.  
---
Nope that'd be a +50 down +10 penetration +50 confirm kill +10 penetration +20 headshot.
---
that would be fucking ridiculous 
---
I mean most of the time when you get to plant you’ve already killed most of the team max two are left on there team. And rushing an objective is just what that doc wants.,
---
Headshots are 20x damage I believe, how did you do 4 or less damage w/ a headshot??
---
Do not doubt the lord
---
How ? look at agent 47 lol he uses dual pistols

Uncle Meatball

There is nothing wrong with lean spamming at the moment. Crouch spamming is another story.

I swear one of my friends is batman because he is a master of echo location and does this shit at least twice a week.

That minute long drone sequence was pretty bad.

But the Thermite blowing up the window with his charge was probably worse.

The disappearing of the red dot sight into the outside was gross.

Blitz' shield actually seemed to behave like a shield.

ACOG isnt a rare sight at either high level plays or competitive. If you can control the recoil, its often the superior sight
---
Hey black ice, fuck you
---
Aw man it’s gone already? 
---
Woah there!..... easy now. In your first paragraph you acknowledge that Ubisoft are unlikely to ban people using a keyboard and mouse adapter.
---
You then quote the code of conduct where it literally says at the end “Maximum penalty is a permanent ban”
---
Keyboard and mouse adapters are non of the following: 
---
• unauthorized version of the Game client
---
• third party software
---
• wallhacks, aimhacks
---
He returns.
---
If he successful writes 10 messages without being banned for toxicity, your team auto-wins

This is painfully true

Caveira had nitro cells

Outbreak is the best one 
---
Me either but i usually have a ping of 9 and no latency issues or anything that i could blame it on.
---
as a happy clash main, the P10-C was absolutely better than the SPSMG9 in a multitude of ways (higher effective TTK due to faster ads speed, less damage dropoff at range, more shots per click, cleaner sight, etc) and the SPSMG9 should deserve a buff but this buff is overkill, i think it will overshadow the P10-C but i won't know yet  
---
not gonna complain though, i always joked about giving a shield operator an machine pistol (and annoying my friends) and the dream is real now
---
Finka x recruit relationship confirmed 
---
I wonder why they did that. Maybe they are making changes each round?

That's a really good tip though dude. I love it!

Let me guess, he has a passive ability that auto leans left and right too?
---
Dumping a kill 30 drones in a weekend challenge on the road to SI was pretty stupid of Ubi.  Most games devolved into everyone chasing drones for the free pack instead of actually prepping sites on most maps.  
---
Hope they never do that again.
---
Only attachment for his Deagle is an ACOG. 
---
lv3 head armour duh 
---
Fair enough.  I thought you were being intentionally obtuse (also not uncommon on reddit).
---
So, how would you attack the problem?
---
I like the idea of this but with legitimate answers from an new player's perspective. Could be a cool way to learn about intuitive design, or whatever it would be called.
---
Yeah but i think a gun is far better than a shield at protecting you, also if the effect only happens while its pointed at them, that worse, just keep it in the enemy’s face and they cant see
---
Sorry, didn't check, but again, this is REALLY annoying. It is getting out of hand.
---
Clash is going to be stupid good now. You might as well just run around with that SMG equipped at all times with her shield on your back to deflect shots. 
---
What type of rice are you eating thats black 
---
In bomb a good echo player can win you a round... Especially with the comp meta you usually get Mira + a plant denial banned (Echo or Maestro)

Yeah that’s what I was thinking when I saw that change as well. I can’t imagine wanting the pistol anymore 
---
He ducked you?

---
You forgot the deagle will do 105 base damage. 
---
The MP5 is not an insane weapon in its own right asides from the fact that it can equip ACOG. But both Doc and Rook are extremely prevalent and extremely good operators with powerful gadgets and a decent weapon that can equip ACOG making them two of the most powerful operators In the game. Seeing as how the MP5 is only used by those two, it seems like a more than a reasonable nerf. Especially since they hardly touched the gun, it takes one more shot to the body which is a noticeable nerf and may will definitely lose you some gun fights you would’ve won pre patch, but it’s still a good gun with one of the few ACOGs on defense.
---
At first I thought it was because of the ‘nade....then shit happened.

Net code is bad.  Your internet is also a variable.
---
yeah

You right. Very few things as satisfying as denying a last second plant and winning with people on both teams still alive

My frame rate in-game is actually good. I dont know why my recorded highlights were stuttering on shadowplay

---
Kaid probably got kicked because he wasn't able to kill her
---
Big ping
---
I understand the need for balance, but I don't understand the prioritization they have. There are plenty of cancer operators but they felt the need to slap a band-aid "fix" on a powerful but not unfair operator instead.
---
It's pretty normal for where I live I don't encounter much issues with it
---
IQ is Yokai's worst nightmare tbh

Does this mean it’ll actually be usable on console?

wtf

I actually play Thermite way more than Hibana, for many reasons, main one is Hibana's small 20 round mag and RoF is higher than Thermites rifle - so I find myself getting caught out reloading. Also Hibana's pellets are still not the most reliable....Don't get me wrong, still like playing Hibana - just don't think Thermite is irrelevant at all!
---
ive see another post like this, I wish I could do stuff like this but nobody. NOBODY wants to correspond.

---
Even though this is all about balancing, I kinda feel like considering they're both thiccboi anchor ops, they should be strong as site holds. Thinking of any game where you have high armour defense operators, you kinda want that last line to be able to hold a 2v5
---
It’s Mira or cav. I had some weird ones too. Thermite, thatcher and tachanka
---
Ubi could prevent players from banning new ops, so that way they can gather data and people can play the ops they paid for.
---
Lesion already does this.
---
"Just a little brick"
---
Back when it was OHK
---
Yeah, it makes for an interesting game. After playing siege for 2+ years it's has gotten pretty familiar and this game mode has really shaken strats up. I love it

i will find one for you
---
i saw it coming

This reminds me of great times I used to have with my buddy on Xbox. I love this clip and I just hear him and I screaming haha. good times

Which of you lot taste like basil then?
---
Thermite and Thatcher are bans usually selected by people actually thinking about their bans. Trying to counter strats common to the type of map.
---
\*Talks through a potato
---
wow you can't even tell sarcasm.
---
woud wu wike a swash s?
---
I guess it might be better for the ranked &amp; pro matches, where the match timers are shorter. I was thinking about casual matches when I posted this question an hour ago, where the timers are very long.
---
Also, this change might make things more intuitive for newer players. After all, if you grab the hostage before the round timer ends, the round doesn't end either. A bit more consistency between game modes.
---
I guess that's why they made this change.
---
 It just you lol

First of all who said im still playing this crap? 
---
THis game is going the same path league of legends went. Instead of trying to work with the playable characters that are available they try to release new ones asap wihtout even thinking twice what impact that OPerator will have. This game will become just like League in terms of skill gap. Releasing new champs/OPerators that take zero skill to play but are OP as fuck. Mark my words you faggot

[here you will see](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/y3s3.2_designers_notes_v2_image1_337146.png)  a win delta of about .4%, giving finka a 50.4% win delta, almost perfectly balanced. As I said, Finka literally gives you 29 health and a recoil boost which is a DETRIMENT to good players. If you really have played 2000 hours and dont have the skills to control recoil without a finka Id be questioning why you are still playing this game to be completely honest with you. If being completely banned from the highest level of play isnt enough to convince you lion is busted then your a lost cause.

Ooooooo I’m just pointing out the mods don’t either

Same. I really hope they leave it in for ranked. As much as I love and would still play Siege if they didn’t, I’d love a new take on it finally.
---
Actually my voice is low and wow I am straight yet I hate when I hear homophobic slurs
---
Banning thatcher or thermite is usually backfiring once your on the attacker side. That round where enemies banned thatcher we won all 3 def with ease, just spamming bandit and mute and the attacking we won because they didn’t.

I’m sure playing video games 8 hours a day as a person in his late 20s isn’t as fun as people might think. Even if he’s making good money. Not to mention he can’t really separate home from the workplace.

May I ask why the fuck Caveira getting banned? She’s good, but not OP. Droning her out helps a lot, if you don’t drone she will annihilate you.
---

I mean your first mistake was challenging the Lord in a gunfight
---
i dont think lion did.
---
Fake af
---
this game used to be so ugly.
---
Yeah makes sense. I just like the idea of attackers realizing: ok they banned Thatcher, we can try twitch this round or we can attack from behind and leave garage. Giving more strats than practically every consulate garage take relying on thermiting the garage
---
Ash in the past has had her R4-C nerfed so I don’t know what your on about. balancing a game like this is a long process made up of small changes rather than large ones (exceptions for things like the upcoming lion rework but that’s been in the works for almost a year). 
---

I like both duos &lt;3. 
---
Room armour 
---
Use the CZ75. It kills faster and has less recoil.
---
It’s an Italian pistol and what her CTU uses IRL. Ironically, Cap and Cav’s pistol is a Beretta and is Italian while Alibi/Maestro’s shotgun revolver is Brazilian. If Cav didn’t get it, she for sure would’ve. They probably just didn’t want two CTUs with the exact same handgun. 
---
Mouse and Keyboard are designed mainly for pc. The controllers that you get with your fucking console should be the device that you use on your console. 
---
Bruh button
---
Feel like there are people that do play at sens but the giveaway is when they run around with the pistol. That’s a pc meta
---
I haven't seen the video in question. But I highly doubt he is passing it as fact. Also highly doubt Ubi listened to Bikini before they decided on this change. Ash has been a staple in this game for a long time, always having a high pick rate, always having an above average win delta, and always being a fan favorite. I would not be surprised by a nerf to her.

Calm down with the profanity and buzzwords kiddo. So do you think that scuff and third party controllers should be banned to?

Do they accept renown? 
---
Ok
---
Ying has a rasengan that’s lit
---
Lmao not really nomads abilities is more like shinra tender or all mighty push depending on if your watch the dub
---
Blitz cav and echo are banned often. My team usually ends up picking whoever we want to ban for attack because I convince them that the enemy team is going to ban blitz, so we don't have to.
---
I mean it’s always been strong 
---
aslo kingGeorge, kingGeorgeTV2, Coconut Brah, and The Dangleberries are good. 
---
I can assure you that people running around with a pistol is not just a PC thing 
---
Yep. That's like any pro League team facing G2. They always ban lion.
---
Honestly I would rather see Dinka banned then lion. She is far far more of a menace.
---
he's also way harder to use. 
---
Cool cool
---
If you think about it, the game is represented quite well by this.
---
Art.
---
God damn recruits
---
Every S. I i go its echo, ash and caveira
---
No because you can still play against them to the point of it being a more fair fight. The reason I dislike M and K is because there is a severe advantage between a Mouse and Keyboard user to a controller user. 
---
I wish there was a campaign mode or coop but it's pretty good. I just wish that because the Rainbow games always had such amazing stories
---
This never happens on console 
---
Sacrificing two operators worth of utility to get one DBNO.
---
Makes sense to me
---
Playing against people below your league does not equal good. You could play against a team of coppers and stomp them singlehandedly. It doesn't make you good at the game. 
---
Every damn time. I’m the Kaid (minus random barricading) that is like guys wtf they have to come to us meanwhile the 1v5 turns into a 1v1. 
---
How about you try it before you say something. Pick P90 Silencer and shoot a friend through 2 walls in the head, he wont die but go in DNBO. Make a video abd show me the results he does die :)
---
Yo thats a cute cat Kaid got tho, ngl
---
I’m pretty sure that guy actually died last time this was posted on  r/wtf
---
What's up with the buff ass recruit 
---
Why
---
But stuff controllers actively allow for the same spamming? So I don't understand what's the issue.
---
The bundle has not been released but when it does it will be in the buy operators tab
---
ok
---
OK
---
Ok then stop. Your not bringing anything new either, nobody in this entire thread has agreed with you. Your bringing up irrelevant and straight up false information that doesn’t prove your case at all. You refuse to give any proof to back up your claims of “2000 hours”. 
---
Anyone got the last one in good resolution without the GUI? I would love that as a desktop. 
---
Another one of these posts? This Isn't netcode or lagg, you're just bad.
---
First shot landed but wasn't enough to down or kill, maybe try aiming for the head?
---
Second shot missed
---
Third Shit was blocked by Jager's ADS
---
Fourth shot was a blank, load actual bullets next time pal
---
Fifth shot was a USSR bullet and not capable of hitting a Russian
---
You were dead client side before the sixth shot even went off
---
Not really, no. It's way more situational than Doc, since you can easily roam (With AN ACOG and come back at pretty much full health after a gunfight for 3 times). 
---
No no no no 😫😥😫😥😥😥😥
---
Can I still be considered a strait male if I'm attracted to such a unit?
---
You can't entirely correct for high recoil.  Even if you can perfectly compensate for recoil, you would choose Ash's gun over Buck's.  The spread is tighter.  As we move away from literally-perfect-recoil-compensation to more realistic territory, the difference gets more pronounced: a small recoil compensation mistake might be salvageable on Ash, but not on Buck.  Recoil would affect Ash's effectiveness.
---
Your post is all over the place and really heated, but I'll address the title.
---
Gotcha. I didn’t mean to incite any sort of argument so I’m sorry if I came off as combative or pretentious. It can be tough to voice a different opinion on the internet without coming off as a dick haha

---
Would make sense since twitch was a collaborator in making the shield
---
I also checked it, I see no error. I think there is blood splatter in the Sixth shot though, you can see some to the left of tachanka. But it still checks out, since it is 3 armor Tachanka with rook armor against the SILENCED OTs-2.0

---
I love those recruit faces
---
I hope you realize that MnK has more advantages than just spamming crouch. Aiming is much more precise with MnK, something that a modded controller like a scuf cannot do because they are still using analog sticks. Your analogy for cheating is also completely wrong as well. "Just because everybody can do it means it's not cheating." Everyone could buy hacks for siege or use a recoil macro to give themselves an unfair advantage i.e cheating. 
---
No, the sub making it out was the bad part. 
---
But doesn’t each stim pistol shot have its own needle and are single use? 
---
What the fuck were you looking at ?

You sound like the type of guy to quit a ranked match.

no

Kaid is a man of art.
---
Improved client stability
---
You only get the holiday pack if you played in the Christmas week. It was next to alpha packs as a special/premium pack and you had to open it that week
---
Not really sure 
---
Again, it depends on the site and situation you are at the moment, there are sites where Echo is certainly extremely useful, even OP, but there are others where he is kinda useless.
---
The stim pistol is definitely not as useless as you think, it's what allows Doc to roam and actually be one of the best roamers at that. 
---
lots of people play this game just to dick around with friends. It can be fun for that as well.
---
Guys the dude is named bandito duriito on Tik Tok

Aye, and to be honest I used to play as Echo in either Secure Area or Hostage only (didn't play Bomb that time), so his effectiveness was a little okay. Then S.I. showed me how scary good he can be, especially with his two drones.

Sure, Maestro can zap the defusing enemy, but he has to be quick to down him/her before it's finally planted, but Echo can fully deny it in an instant.

Yes, everybody can physically buy and plug in a mouse and a keyboard, but not everyone can use them. If you buy a console, you're getting a more arcadey, casual and couch style platform. If you use M&amp;K on console you may as well get a PC. Most console users, like me, bought a console to play on their TV from their couch or bed, giving the users who can use a M&amp;K because they use their console on their desk where they also have a PC an unfair advantage.

Hello Derize_-Supreme, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aktk5b/why_is_my_audio_bugged/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

That happened to me today and i died coz it

Just keep grinding. Make sure you drone rooms you’re moving into, to stop any embarrassing deaths. Also, increasing your map knowledge is pretty important; breaking floors above choke points can get easy kills. Also also, think about increasing your sensitivity. I’m on PS4 too and I increased mine almost immediately, and once your used to it being able to get the turn on opponents can be valuable. 
---
Finally, don’t worry about your rank. I’ve been playing since Y1S2 on and off, level 140 and I’m sat in silver II right now. However, just play for fun and don’t get tilted cause that can easily cause you to lose games. Chill out and have fun
---
And if they don't admit it? And who's to say it's the fifth? It could be anyone on the squad. Ultimately allowing people to play with m+KB and actively adding a handicap would be exponentially better. 
---
You want to play with m+KB? No headshots. Then it gives a pro and a con to using it.
---
Pros: Your aim is generally better and your movement is more natural
---
Cons: You are unable to headshot, you have a cooldown on leans and crouches.
---
Ultimately this would probably make it feel like there's an actual downside to using it, but also a reason to use it.
---
The problem with welcome mats is the fact that you can shot them while ur vaulting, it’s stupid as shit.
---
My friend is a diehard Echo main. Any game mode. Definitely a viable operators. Just bonus uses on bomb worthy of a ban.
---
Just like the original
---
What I mean is the lower ranks meta is wrong
---
If your teammates lie or don’t tell you, it’s time to find different teammates.
---
that looks really good {-}7

My appetite was insatiable

Feel free to react to the rest

delete your post nibba

Not on ps4 so my 2 cents would be, Drone effectively and efficiently. In casual you have a lot more time to waste checking every corner, but in ranked you gotta balance between droning a lot and actually pushing up to the objective. So what I usually do is drone areas where you get wider views more and LISTEN to stuff around it, saves a lot of time if you hear somebody in a part of the map you know. So point 2, just know every map, watch how you die memorize common areas where they come from, and keep it in mind as you drone and push.

.....dude that's not why she's even picked. I have 1500 hours in this game and I'm telling you for sure that's not why lol. It's great gun, three speed, tiny head. They take her r6 and leave the g36 she woul still be a heavily used op and much more balanced. That being said i couldn't care less. She's not that OP. My point was your "adding recoil won't change anything" argument is just insane
---
Changing how the game works would be as hard or harder than implementing some form of cross play 
---
Just ignore the noise.. I recently rotated my main ops to castle and blitz and almost every game somebody mirrors my picks after a round or two.
---
incoming wave of lord tachanka meme comments
---
Execute repost 66
---
Yes
---
They do it 3 times a year while the other 99% of the time all cosmetics can be bought with renown or directly with in game money
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for explaining!
---
I would like to see the stats to back that argument up. Everyone I know that has a PS4 plays at a desk with a monitor. If you want a causal game lifestyle go play Spider-Man. You can’t play a competitive game and then complain about it being competitive. And you’re argument about MnK, could be said about controllers. Some people can’t use controllers so should they not be allowed to? 
---
Blitz used to be more OP but he was nerfed. Players are still good with him tho and has left many traumatized myself included. As far as the rest tho like lion, i dont consider op or toxic.
---
Aye, same here! If I came back to Siege feeling rusty, I'd go as Echo, since I can watch key areas with them. The thing is back then I feel exposed if I don't play as him.
---
But S. I. has showed me to be good with the other ops, so that's good by me! 
---
Is it just me or does all the charms seem very deep and meaningful?
---
i never really likes using iron sights, but i gotta agree wit what u/Mr_hushbrown said about it being personal preference
---
It's because they're considered annoying
---
Because those ops are either OP or just not fun to play against. So some people have made an unwritten to not play these ops for a more fair and fun match. When someone picks these ops it becomes not enjoyable to play, hence being tk’d or people leave. You’re more than welcome to play whatever op you want, but it may come with toxicity towards you. 
---
Confirmed? 
---
1: nothing here 
---
2: okay, imagine these few situations. Doc, rook, ela, valkyrie/kaid, jager, and lesion are all given this attachment. Doc and rook are the best player helpers on defense and have high win deltas which would boost both that and pick delta, ela is already on thin ice and would break with something like this, valkyrie/kaid have love fire rate and damage because of they're extremely useful gadgets, we all know why jager is a bad idea, lesion is one of if not the most versatile operator on defence and has got his smg nerfed as a result. Giving these operators and attachment that changes the game extremely is bad. Stuff like comp, and vertical grip doesn't change much but make a gun easier to control but it's Suttle. Adding damage reduces the shots required to kill and since it's not a barrel means you can have both more damage and easier control.
---
3: I know your not just talking about windows. But your only adding that, with the rest of his placements which only is viable for spawn peeks.
---
4: nothing here
---
Could make a good ctu for recruits
---
big fucking hole in the heart
---
I shot someone in the head with a shotgun and it said injure so i think it might just be the range and if you might have shot at a distance through something 
---
Rule 9
---
Wow wtf I had no clue but that makes sense
---
Low, not love. Fucking auto correct 
---
Yeah I see your points.  Without mute then
---
Not a streamer by any means but I personally prefer it over optics. They don't add any zoom so all depends on what you wanna shoot with I guess
---
Habana 
---
Hey, thanks for taking your time to help me improve, really means a lot dude!
---
No worries my man. Good luck 
---
Honestly, I feel the exact opposite
---
It's not a meme 
---
Lion and blitz are looked down upon because they both can be really strong in the right hands/ scenario.   
---
Jackal isn’t considered toxic, but in coop with lion he can be a toxic combo sometimes.   
---
Blackbeard is considered fundamentally broken by a ton of people.
---
Same with you, thanks for the tips, hopefully, ill improve!
---
Yes officer, this post right here. 
---
There are already settings that would prevent damage
---
ok, fair points tbf, but ubisoft obviously know a lot more about this stuff than anyone here really, so its up to them whether or not these changes actually get implemented really
---
Or folks playing just the defense part and then quitting and looking for a new lobby where they can play defense. Won dozens of games because the other team quitted after swapping sides
---
And all that renown you grinded is valuable for 99% of cosmetics, they do paid only packs 3 times a year you make it sound like its the only way to get cosmetics ever
