Idk I did it a while ago and just edited a flair

---
---
Shouldn‚Äôt it be Burch
---
Stop. I can only get so erect
---
I actually saw this one guy who wanted to derank once. He was pretty nice and didn‚Äôt throw, just left at the last second.
---
Welcome to rainbow six it‚Äôs always been like this just re queue and move past it. Getting mad won‚Äôt help you. Also the mp5 is gonna make you more efficient and accurate as a shooter.
---
I hate both and I hope that R6 will get back to original serious (or semi-serious) cosmetics
---
hey its the same thing i did except mine are made out of plastic and are showing the best ops
---
I saw someone say the G36C, and even though I don't think it would happen that would be cool. Realistically, I'd probably want her to get Lesion's T-5. It's a solid gun which handles nicer than the FMG-9 to a lot of people, and I think she'd look cool holding it. Alternatively, I'd like her to get the MP5K. It's statistically identical to the FMG-9, but in my experience it feels a little more fluid.
---
does anyone happen to have outbreak recruit's PNG protrait?
---
It‚Äôs not a smurf if it‚Äôs becoming your new main account, but if you are still worried, wait till next season.
---
Gotta love the C75. I'm not sure if I'm just accustomed to the weapon, but it's recoil feels about on par with a primary.
---
Maybe you're correct for the attacker. I remember a long time ago (more than a year, maybe around Para Bellum if I remember correctly?) devs said they were making the Thatcher EMPs only disabling cameras in order to prepare for more changes in electronic gadget denial mechanics.
---
Can‚Äôt you just show them your k/d over the past few seasons?
---
It's not a good gun. But God is it fun to use.
---
But would it be bad if I used my current main account to play with friends and only use the smurf for ranked?
---
The game isn't even serious anymore, ain't no point.
---
A terrible photo?
---
icon or operator?
---
It doesn‚Äôt show that to my knowledge and I get kicked before I can explain
---
Yeah I saw your post it was pretty good lol
---
I was laughing at how funny the photo was lol
---
both would be cool
---
the month when recruit had attachments, ahhh the good times
---
She is french
---
brony\*
---
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE US LOSE TOO??
---
That sparks an interesting Gadget idea, doors (regardless of bulletproof or not and a window (same, regardless of bulletproofs) Mira of doors
---
heres the link to where i got the icon:
---
https://marcopixel.eu/r6-operatoricons/
---
My bad my bad just think of your grandma or puppies dying that‚Äôll not make you wanna jack off I promise
---
Yeah that‚Äôs around the time they changed him to only disable cameras. They said a rework was coming for him I believe but never mentioned it again.
---
Video settings,
---
Disable vsync
---
He can probably walk while holding his turret. A visual example is probably like Halo and running around with the minigun turret.
---
Maybe just for casual. It could cause the Ash mains to occasionally lay off.
---
Even worse when they leave at the very beginning and some how the match still continues. Is ubi that lazy to create a system that would end the whole match? 
---

---
Like c‚Äômon.
---
Did anyone else read ‚ÄúSucc‚Äù with an echo or just me
---
I don't mean any offense to OP, but the whole point of crediting the artist is to not steal credit. So if you post and it isn't yours and you don't credit, it is basically stealing credit.
---
Making it "unknown" or "anonymous" means that it isn't yours and you are posting it here knowing that well.

I want an elite for Dokkaebi

That's a Soviet furry

How does this relate to the clown emoji?

I like him he is nice
---
Ah forgot the logic
---
In soviet Russia there was no metals for furrys
---
Ahhh the tiny beast himself
---
Ok thanks
---
Ok thank you
---
So that's where it is.
---
Can you still get furry
---
Noe important question is how did you lose two rounds to literally nobody
---
What if this rework has become the actual upcoming operator?
---
‚ÄúSURPRISE MOTH....‚Äù *Stab*
---
How did you get recruit in ranked
---
I think we've found the R6 prodigy, he could be a pro for sure lol
---
GG sick ace bud like shooting fish in a barrel.
---
Operator idea: name: Redstone. Gadget: places a Redstone torch that opens the door.
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote but ok
---
Idk tbh. I think this was before they changed it so you can‚Äôt play recruit in ranked, or this was during the Invitational game mode back in Y3S4
---
This is definitely a good idea to put a watermark on your art, I‚Äôve posted a piece not too long ago without a watermark and got into some shit and accused of stealing it.
---
Okay...did someone hurt you?
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a hero. But I think your a total swine by knowingly reposting to get useless internet points.

mUsT gAiN KaRmA!!!!! REEEEEEE

---
You can actually sell accounts with high enough Karma for a decent price. Not really useless.
---
They can injure you though
---
Amazing job
---
The two have different roles, so it‚Äôs down to personal preference. Alibi is great for roaming due to her high ROF SMG, 3 speed, and impacts and mozzie is great for anchoring/lurking. If you like playing roamers, get alibi, if you like intel denial and cam ops then get mozzie.
---
Was a Chanka elite announced?
---
Lol. One of the IQ I go their contact info and they told me they were keeping their plate in their con memobilia cause they loved the whole take of the character I was doing
---
Same thing Central, I cant even play on my main account (lvl 259 Plat 3). I have to use my 2nd account and it matches within 2 min (lvl 35 Gold 3)....
---
Sweet play
---
Haha, he got his friend to diamond guys and he never even touched a Pc before!!! Omg he has to be Beaulo‚Äôs cousin.
---
Its not about dokk getting it but vigil, thats where youll see some play with it
---
I wish this was real
---
Well rainbow does that with everyone. It's one of my big issues with the game.
---
That and the fact armor is completely useless. Why can someone wearing level 4 NIJ plates get killed in 2 9x18 bullets?
---
It‚Äôs ranked in gold 2ish
---
They're really good 3D models and super detailed, but I hate how they look in play lol. More than 90% of the outfits/skins look like tacky garbage to me in play because they don't fit aesthetically with the game, like someone cosplaying with a glitter gun. With that said the models themselves look superb and clearly had heart put into them.
---
I like reporting them
---
Your pistol rapid fire is sexy.
---
Before "UBI FIX YOUR GAME, MATCHMAKING IS BROKEN"
---
After "THANKS UBI, NOW I CANT PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS"
---
And on 1-3 match point.
---
That is sad.
---
Thomas had never seen such bullshit before.
---
Ok so in this situation what are you supposed to do. I can‚Äôt play shields at all btw.
---
Obviously you don‚Äôt get it
---
An acog'd 2 shot kangaroo kick gun over a 30 lead full auto zero recoil laser beam with reliable and consistent ttk? Highly doubt it, except at lower levels.
---
&gt;monetary reasons 
---
Nothing else.
---
Nomad for rushing/obj play, dokk for slow pushes and intel gathering
---
 
---
Kaid for anchoring, mozzie for intel/deep roaming
---
Would recommend you opt out the following.
---
Amaru - lots of frustration due to many ledge, balcony area not usable along with her gadget
---
Nokk - one of the worst currently on the attacker side due to a weak recycled primary weapon, gadget potential is bottlenecked by its 2 speed
---
Clash - banned very frequently because her being annoying shield operator
---
Warden - situational gadget that depends on enemies instead of changing the table by yourself, also have recycled weapons but you are paying 25,000 renown for it
---
I would recommend getting Nomad, Mozzie first. And Dokkaebi and Kaid later.
---
I dont like hibana personally, I cant use any of her guns for the life of me, I do like her gadget though. I used to play echo before he got two drones. I think hes a bit too strong now.
---
I feel like bandit would be a better option than kaid. People say that his gun is overpowered, but it's actually kinda trash in recoil now. If you are really good in recoil control then you could use him but I would still go for bandit, but not always because of hatches and the time for you to put down your stuff.
---
Did you report him
---
yes
---
we all did
---
How did you headshot Ash?
---
Had a mate clip it for me
---
i have no idea
---
Facts :(
---
Excellent
---
Yeah but it is a great looking weapon skin
---
Big shield
---
Ela had one down in the corner on the other side of the wall, which I'm pretty sure was Ash.  You probably missed it while you were on cams, then when you went to shoot out the wall, you hit her in the foot.  You can see her body in the corner.
---
watermark
---
The worst part is if he was solo queuing, his teammates will likely also get sanctions.
---
Really, thanks because I couldn‚Äôt check because I got imminently killed by blackbird
---
Who made furry smoke? Same guy?
---
Yeah man
---
Grim Sky, stopped until burnt horizon and I‚Äôm level 119
---
You get shoved in a locker today or are you always an edgy little shit
---
I could tell you went on a custom game just to to this
---
I don‚Äôt even understand what that means I don‚Äôt speak faggot
---
he had 3 teammates and the other 2 were very good people and was killing the cheater and were throwing for us
---
Get the fuck out of here vsco girl no one likes you
---
A leaked operator
---
SO what you're saying is that Nokk should not be in the game because her gadget is a DIRECT COPY of Vigil's gadget, but on the Attacker side. Speaking of which, Warden shouldn't either because it's too similar to Ying, Kaid is Bandit but "special," and Hibana is no different from Thermite. Sorry to shit on anyone's main out there
---
More like Blitz since his shield protects nothing.
---
I hope those guys dont get banned for boosting.
---
Stick your fuze in that
---
Is it thoooü§´ü§´
---
I'm sorry to break the news to ya mate, but ur mum fucked one of the species of smoke, in the next 3-6 months you should notice some elongation and stickiness. Don't worry mate, it's standard stuff, u'll be just dandy and Succ able in no time
---
My click?
---
Vibe check
---
Nice
---
This seems far underpowered just use a drone?
---
Pretty much the same for me minus the call outs. People rarely even talk in my games
---
Sounds good but Clash does 5 DMG per Tick
---
No the title just uh..... i mean come on its reddit and the rule is no title like that
---
I miss Recruit with attachments. I really hope ubi considers making that a permanent change to him. It won‚Äôt make him super viable or a must pick, but it would be nice. I play a lot of Recruit so I‚Äôd like to be able to use attachments on him.
---
Try uploading it to free3d models or cgtrader they‚Äôre basically imgur for 3D models
---
Praise be to Tchanka
---
I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt know there was the Reddit Policeüò≠
---
To be fair, we was in the same team with lord headass and eekaj so it's a pretty safe bet that it's him
---
They don't want Recruit to become an appealing operator, at all. Because, it's not how you're supposed to play the game. They don't want people using him.
---
I think it‚Äôs a wonderful idea and my favorite of yours except it should be on defense as a 2 speed  tbh as it‚Äôs quite a 2 speed defender ability thus is what makes warden absolute shit
---
Ok now youre doing it on purpose
---
Are you really such a normie?
---
Well I can share some insight here. The titles aren't a beaulo creation. It's the whole siege community that does that, beaulo, skittlz, godly, whoever they all do it because it gets views. I personally enjoy godly and beaulo videos because they're both good and I enjoy the subtle differences between them. Like how godly controls recoil and has black ice on everything, or he knifes the ground after a kill. He does those things to keep his own identity and separate him from players like beaulo, thus establishing his own unique brand. Beaulo, is obviously the OG and already did this. But players like szyma and spoit? They are just trying to ride the coattails in all honestly. Using the same intro/background as godly and using clickbaity titles like "Eu BeAuLo??!" They just want money at the end of the day. And I dont know about szyma, but I know spoit is just a 15 year old kid. What does he know better? Just ignore them and tell youtube to stop recommending them to you if you dont like it. I feel where you're coming from I had to do the same thing for many siege youtubers as well that I didnt enjoy like zironic.
---
I started in Phantom Sight now I'm about 75.
---
(This comment will become really outdated though)
---
I‚Äôm confused I would recommend just leavingüò§
---
You shouldn't just randomly fuze something, get a friend in position then force the enemies to move away from the fuze into someones fire. That or use it in conjunction w/ a breaching charge (on a roof).
---
Alibi's holograms are best used at blocking mechanisms to make windows hard to use.
---
You don't spawn peek w/ lesion.
---
Kill stealing doesn't matter.
---
Cheaters rob you of time that is not compensated. Sure the company can go after cheat makers for the loss of profits we don't give them, but no one will even attempt to refund our time.
---
You can't complain about someone playing a character if you chose not to ban it. Well I mean you can, but they will just point out that you chose not to ban it.
---
Queuing as a 2-4 stack then not communicating with your random is purposefully sabotaging your team. You are robbing them of any useful information you get causing members of your team to play worse.
---
White Knight cheaters just increase the amount of cheaters and don't resolve anything. It just encourages more people to cheat.
---
Stream sniping is cheating but without the risk of being banned.
---
Seems to situational like if your teammate dies and you need location either trap them into a hard firefight or jackal them but if the death happens early game and you could scan where they are then it may just change the round and I think this should be available with drones too
---
Hes still too strong I say. That's why hes seeing pl play. Dumb op with an ability that is stupid. He needs more counters.
---
Oh dear god. It's too powerful.
---
Not a normie at all just trying to post my clips. So  toxic for no reason.
---
I'd pay.
---
Shut the fuck up kill yourself you nigger, you say boomer when nigga you probably don‚Äôt even know what is means, now tell me just tell me how the fuck am I a boomer if I‚Äôm 13 you dipshit fag
---
1. Finally someone understands that you should use the k1a or mk14
---
2. Slawnpeeking is annoying af. It is a strategy, but a fucking annoying one..
---
Pulse should have impacts or a bulletproof cam, barbed wire makes no sense for him.
---
Thank you for your interest !
---
That's not controversial
---
Bubana?
---
I wanna see her putting him in a headlock.
---
you certainly sound 13 and also as though you learned all of those words yesterday. please tell me this is a joke or copypasta?
---
*jiggle*
---
#*loud sucking*
---
Yeah Tachanka already has the RFF who‚Äôs clearly friends with doc so they‚Äôve already tk‚Äôed Ela as it is and trying to double/triple down.
---
Hell yea
---
They've already nerfed the mp5 into the ground. It's worse than the FMG9 stat wise, and the mp5k. Why would you nerf it any further? That's stupid because mute has more utility and is faster.
---
Berried a friend
---
oh OK thanks
---
IQ is basically god: she can detect Pulse and vigil when they r using the ability, and she can even see you when defusing
---
*for once*
---
What's your screen res? Set it at exactly that. Any lower and it'll be blurry and out of focus
---
Thatcher with thatcher
---
This is a really unique and good concept. Will it be able to be electrified? Because I feel that would make it too powerful
---
Maybe yes.
---
True but I love doing triple and quad kills with recruit, just to surprise everyone.
---
Meet me: copper that plays like a copper.
---
*sniffles*
---
Yes there is. The argument is that there are people who genuinely enjoy recruit and play well with him.
---
I just had 3 guys lose to one person and I killed the defuser carrier.  He killed me at the same time though.  So they all know where the package was and peeked until all f‚Äôing 3 of them were taken out.
---
Silver 1 and just had 2 casuals 8-0 and 7-4-2, idk how to rank me in terms of plat or ass but I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that great considering my performance in ranked lol
---
Try to kill one with your pistols and most times people get cocky and you should melee them 1 by 1 and not kill because then they can shoot you
---
No game developer right now is able to detect m+kb adapters on console
---
And other than those players, there are no actual hackers on console, so you shouldn‚Äôt ever expect to see them be banned
---
Exactly, the new ranked system wasn't supposed to be a way to get rid of the operators you dislike, it was supposed to allow for strategic banning on specific maps. Operators like this would finally make people actually think about which operator would be a more better choice to be banned
---
This operator would finally make Favela playable
---
[*Plunk plunk plunk*](https://i.imgur.com/NCD1dOn.jpg)
---
If he was impossible to play in ranked I wouldn‚Äôt feel so strongly. The players who do well with recruit would do better and help their team win more if they chose a real operator with reinforcements, special gadgets, and weapon attachments. 
---
I agree throwing doesn‚Äôt really matter much in casual though
---
G36 red dot. Wut
---
It‚Äôs to stop the lame crouch walkers üòÇ

I would pay up to $50 for this in game
---

---
he is lucky enough to reach 98%
---
Hah I'm so quirky you guys I asked a dumb fucking question aren't I just so quirky and weird
---
But still players should be listening for the bombs or even fuze placing the charge to shoot it before he can cause too much damage
---
ubi, make it universal
---
Never too late my friend
---
I WOULD PAY FOR THAT
---
(feel free to downvote this comment as well)
---
They need to add this in as a universal skin. Fking looks great.
---
Is that a real skin ?
---
Ok boomer
---
10/10 would buy again
---
I wanted the full skin for Lesion so bad cause I play him a lot. In my packs I bought I got full Bandit skin but I almost never play him.
---
holy shit i wish this was real
---
It wasn't a headshot though.
---
No, my friend and I had tried queuing into some matches before this and it would boot me out when it started searching for the game. I quit siege, came back and was greeted with a warning
---
Ye well there wasn't a single female DEF in the base game at all. So what?
---
Belle Delphinne: -0-
---
An attempt was made and a friend was saved. Good drawing

My screen resolution is 1366x768, and I exactly set it to that.
---
Do you mean the pc‚Äôs resolution for global resolution?
---
I am a huge Zofia fanboy and it makes my heart cry that I don't have this.
---
Same here, i dont know what is causing it, it culd be ram but mine is more than enough and im 100% sure its not my pc, you just play and the game is gone, it dosent even run in background anymore it just decides its gona die
---
Ill take your entire stock
---
Yea, Please put a compensator to echos smg.
---
Yes. The Pc's resolution for the global resolution.
---
You might wanna take a look in your gpu settings if there is some setting that is being forced on the game
---
IIRC it's the symbol of the Polish resistance in WWII. Correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you btw
---
Thank you (:

Thats why I play rook, even if you die at the start you have still made a contribution to the team.

Thank you! :)

You know what i mean
---
If only it was on the AK so I had an excuse to stick it on fuzes AK12
---
There are some amazing animal themed skins on Apex that I'd like here.
---
But that's just me though. Apex's skins are active ones that glow or burn when you kill, which can be very distracting.
---
Fuze doesn‚Äôt rhyme
---
Fucking lmao, you‚Äôre hilarious. Essentially your whole argument ended up being ‚Äòone tap the enemy‚Äô. Dude, be real, you‚Äôre probably hard stuck in copper, landing a headshot is a play of the week for you, let alone landing a one tap. Do you understand how stupid you sound? You‚Äôre literally suggesting that DMRs are better because you can headshot people, except literally any gun can headshot people, genius. And if you miss the first headshot on the DMR, someone could literally bodyshot you to death because that‚Äôs how shit DMRs are. 
---
It‚Äôs amazing how pathetic you‚Äôre getting. Your response is literally ‚Äòfuck pro league‚Äô, because you couldn‚Äôt come up with an explanation for why the people who put thousands of hours in this game and literally play it for a living for some reason never use DMRs, even though according to you they‚Äôre the best guns in the game. How can you lack this much self awareness? You genuinely are quite sad, though it is also kinda funny. I find it incredibly amusing that you think you know more about this game than the people who literally make a career out of it. Yeah, DMRs are so much better than ARs, that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a huge meta in pro league about using them. Sarcasm, in case you couldn‚Äôt comprehend that. 
---
I‚Äôm done replying to you. You have the intelligence of a child and it‚Äôs pretty clear that any evidence or argument I throw at you you‚Äôll just end up ignoring because you‚Äôre stubborn and don‚Äôt want to accept that you as a hardstuck copper player on your xbox know fuck all about this game. Anyone who sees this thread will know that too, and they won‚Äôt take your shitty advice, because other wise they‚Äôd be stuck in copper with you.
---
The only thing i could tell is :
---
#UNKOWN FOR NOW
---
So you're saying they release November 2nd?
---
not to be rube but were those a gunshots because of gun safety neglect?
---
You provide reliable info, considering your prominent presence on the PL sub.
---
But 16x filtering! Damn. Say, is filtering dependent on graphics memory?
---
Instead of gunfire, sounds of 'KYAAAAA' will be heard everytime you pull the trigger.

Just shoot a bullethole and hope u dont hit your family in the process

i have a clip where i got a 4k with one fuze into bathroom on coastline and the fifth killed himself
---
time to rework that hatch then...
---
Actually.
---
You got the colour scheme right, and the idea. But the face coiod use improvements.
---
&gt;I recommend not using him at a high level. Hes viewed as unfair, a crutch op, and a toxic pick.
---
Finally.
---
Bro just spawnpeek
---
Um that's not exactly what this question is...
---
very annoying op to go up against because his shield defies the on headshot kill mechanic. :(
---
Nope. -_-

Okay thanks.

We were talking about this exact objective and this exact situation IIRC. I explained my point of view twice. You can disagree - fine, your choice, I don't care that much.
---
If you think you're smart and totally right and I'm dumb and completely wrong - fine, nothing will changes in my life if something will change your opinion, so no reason to put much efforts into some useless conversation. Since I've already wasted enough of my time, I'd rather stop.

That's so effing wrong.

I went from gold 1 to silver due to hackers and lag being a thing. And being bad lol

Not that I want to defend them, but I'm pretty sure they weren't able to fix it because it probably caused worse issues.

Climbing fast tho because silver is straight easy mode

how'd ya render this

Well, time to go experiment again.

Thanks for the info.

I've been playing siege since year 2. It's always been the case that if a teammate pulls down the barricade, castle gets it back. If you destroy it with an impact or nitro, then it is gone.
---
Mira Plays 101
---
Because you said it in a very entitled way.
---
all fun and games until the robber has bosg acog
---
My apologies, didn't know. It is the Internet after all so you never know.
---
Oof
---
Dropshot ez pz
---
Didn't even check cams smh
---
This should be in the game
---
What, no spawn kill?
---
Please tell me this is real
---
I like it like this tho because now you have no idea what to expect and it‚Äôs all mystery and speculation
---
I dont think so.you could change the amount of renown you get
---
I dont play the game a whole lot, but it always confused me why attackers got claymore and defense doesnt.
---
Im assuming it would be too strong?
---
Oh hell yeah, I can tell you what to do Timmy. Now go and Spawnpeak this fucking Ash Main
---
But for real, they come up my stairs I'm wall banging them.
---
r/outside
---
That might be from a pack or universal I have no clue
---
Where did you find these grave stones?
---
What about making it four boosts and she can still have the option of choosing to boost all teammates/reviving them or using the one boost to heal a teammate up to 60 hp? I like the concept
---
Hate teammates who vote kick you because either: you didn't clutch when you was the only one left, when you're not that good, like bitch I haven't done shit let me play man, everyone makes mistakes
---
Sad to hear that. Specially now that they are getting more into lore and character development, they could tease with backstory and character with a blogpost and some images or artwork.
---
Its true tho, look at shootings in the last week in America, and then of all time in Denmark, guess which one has more
---
Got any solid proof for that ?
---
Damn :( 
---
Thx for letting me know
---
That‚Äôs great!
---
Your english is better than most native speakers :) dont worry about it :)
---
Yes, different options to make a choice could be cool, but it should be balanced.
---
That's the point. It shouldn't work in CQB. That's why he has the flip sight option. Also, there are a lot of very long sightlines in siege. Not all encounters are CQB.
---
It‚Äôs rare but trust me man, there‚Äôs far better skins like the legendaries in alpha packs for instance, you could get that would shine over nebula
---
If you think this strategy works outside of gold level you‚Äôre kidding yourself
---
Shes practifally barely ised as is this would make it die
---
ubisoft bucks
---
This game style and meta is why I stopped playing R6, it shouldn‚Äôt just be lean spam and crouch spam and pixel peak battles, that‚Äôs not what this game should be geared around
---
You made this? This would probably make Finka a more competitive choice honestly and an actual healer for Attackers
---
üò´üò©
---
Bro did you actually load your firearm for a meme?
---
I did this because I heard ubi is looking for a way of reworking her and make her more of a healer
---
Do you remember when they said they would stop posting teasers ? I hope they will at least release Ela's elite
---
If you watch the every operator explained video the guy said her nano bots or whatever the fuck they are is a cure for a disease she has so this wouldn‚Äôt make sense lore wise
---
Yeah this is a bit impractical tbh dokaebi works because its only a channel you have to go through not a selection screen
---
You just sound like you have a lot of personal hate for the Bosg. I think itll be fun and not game breaking. I bet itll be annoying but nothing more
---
you supposed to pre fire, noob.
---
I'm Plat 3 on xbox. I got an ace the first round (ranked match). Got four kills the second round and the last enemy killed himself.
---
I was team killed for the rest of the game.
---
We lost the ranked match.
---
Why? she can still use them on herself
---
I like how literally anytime anyone is having a good conversation on here some dumb European  has to chime in about how everything is America's fault and how they're tiny pathetic european countries should've won against America and the Allied powers. *wonders why people hate Europeans*
---
Teammate: dont peek it they have an angle.
---
Me: peeks multiple times
---
interesting idea, but I feel like drones are already in a good spot and there are a lot of intel ops already
---
Please tell me this is a real skin
---
Europe
---
Blue nebula, you get it for buying at least one universal skin between velvet shell and operation health
---
There were also [these](https://twitter.com/rainbow6game/status/895732366693498886?s=21)  skins for Doc and the revolver, which you got for owning the season pass in Operation Health.
---
So it is neither glitch nor exploit. Siege has one of the worst anitcheat measures ever in online game history. What you can see here is a new kind of cheat where by using twitch drone, cheater can either deal absurd amount of damage to enemies resulting in instant kill or boost his teammates including himself to well over 100'000 HP. Don't neccessarly report everyone in enemy team, they might be fair and just being boosted by cheater even against their will.
---
this would be really annoying as a console player since you have to do extra work just to heal 1 person
---
I think the thing with the M4 is that it isn't OP, it's just a well rounded gun, but it's extremely common because of the prebuild you get when it unlocks. As soon as you get to the level to unlock the M4, it already comes with this legendary build that already has a scope (hybrid),  a stock, barrel, laser, and a perk so you have the choice to not start out vanilla without anything like the other guns. You use it because it already comes with the high tier build so you just wind up sticking with it because, hey you've already got it powered up to lvl 20 by the time you yourself hit level 15. It isn't OP, it's just super common for people to use because they don't have to slog through 10 levels of it before they can unlock any decent attachments.
---
It‚Äôd be great if reddit mobile video player actually worked, I can‚Äôt even watch any of this
---
I see where you are getting, well it could be possible.
---
Is this PC or console?
---
naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah thats fine to me :)
---
Since when? Started playing year 3 season 4 :P
---
i've been in this situation more times than I'd like to admit
---
60 seconds of stealthed droning per drone is a little absurd. Id say 15 seconds tops. But this is genuinely a good original idea so gj
---
that's not how a turban works
---
No she‚Äôs fine now
---
I am agreeing with the previous person agreeing with that person
---
One of the most satisfying sounds ever
---
He may be a counter, but nothing indirectly buffed. This is because the drone stops in front of jammers, whether visible or invisible.
---
that sucks man, idk what‚Äôs wrong with people
---
yes, because putting anything that covers your face and head = n√∏kk
---
inb4 "you must be fun at parties". this idea has been used so many times
---
No
---
Just no
---
From th e perspective of an Ash main no, the reason why everyone plays her is the guns and speed.
---
You're not wrong, but that gun actually is also very, very powerful apparently. Low recoil, high firerate, medium-high damage, quick ADS time, etc. Well-rounded is an understatement, this gun is disturbingly versatile.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since operation health, at times I was playing heavily, I do not believe that lean spam, drop shotting, extreme pixel peaks, crouch spam, and overall abuse of movement mechanics is in the spirit or design of this game, Idgaf what the pc no life‚Äôs consider the comp meta, I don‚Äôt care bc I‚Äôm not no lifing this game, these players who abuse the game and play ‚Äúoptimally‚Äù ruin the game for ppl who choose not to play like their on fuckn crack
---
Yeah I can think of a lot of long hallways as soon as I picture a map in my head. Not to mention there are certain eagles nest in certain maps as well, like house for instance. I think this is very clever and works. If your going in a room then yeah use your entry sight and if in a hallway keep the thermal one out. I like it.
---
How about she has two options how to use the boost?
---
First option: All is the same as now, you hit the button that activates the gadget, she squeezes her hand and EVERYONE gets a heal. 
---
If the receiving Operator is at 100hp, he gets OVERHEALED by 60HP with all the other perks she now gives, but he loses the Overheal as it is right now for Finka only and is back at 100HP.
---
If the Operator is at let's say 45HP, he get's healed to 105 HP and loses those extra 5 HP over time because it was an overheal, but at least now he's back on 100HP.
---
And if the OP is at 20HP, he simply get's healed back up to 80HP and has the short buff that usually comes with the Finka Heal right now.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or the other Option would be, but this makes the gadget quite complicated to use:
---
Same as above with the effects OR she can pull out that small tablet and choose to ONLY heal each operator that is still alive by 80HP once but without the added Buffs that come with a Finka Buff as it stands now and the Heal DOESN'T overheal if chosen individual for every operator, meaning if you heal an Operator at 90HP he only gets back up to 100HP but an Operator at 10HP gets back up to 90HP.
---
"Ops like mute, lesion, and kapkan take little time and can be used even after the operators death unlike thermite, does that mean we need to nerf them too?"
---
The difference would be that their abilities aren't universal (something that this community generally hates), Also they have much more ways to be countered than Dokk. Dokk counters are extremely situational because defenders count on 2 specific defenders and nothing more (2 of the current 25). At least the operators you mentioned can be countered not only by specific ops but by secondary gadgets. 
---
 "this isn't cod with everyone having more or less same abilities with minor tweaks"
---
1) I don't know which cod you are talking about, i think overwatch would be a better example.
---
2) Ash-Zofia, Bandit-Kaid, Thermite-Hibana, Cav-Nokk, and i can go on.
---
Also if your risk vs reward means "just pressing a button and hearing all the closest defenders and at the same time annoying them" I don't think there is enough risk.
---
Says a certified reddit nerd üòÇü§£
---
Just make the claymores realistic then.
---
there were leaks tho
---
Fuck appealing to the Chinese, let's appeal to Japan
---
What is supposed to happen here?
---
Yes spawning by main gate with 10 sec was brutal
---
It's almost like this is how it should have been the whole time
---
Yea but they weren‚Äôt official from Ubisoft and I think Ubisoft is trying to delete all the leaks
---
Echo is completely immune to Dokkaebi calls.
---
Caviera silent step doesn‚Äôt leave footprints and stops Jackal pings.
---
It's because it's the easiest op to play in the game
---
Whatever dood it looked like it
---
wtf did you do
---
dark matter from infinite warfare
---
You should ask whether it works or not, not whether it's toxic. Almost no one will play better from such a comment, more likely the opposite. Try to point out specific things you would like to see instead and phrase it as a suggestions. That's if you actually want them to do better at least.
---
I like how they suggested that the event could return when announcing  it in Twitter. https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1192096164079919110?s=19
---
Well the game not for you obviously, question what was the highest rank you been able to achieve. People with this mindset are usually in the lower ranks and in the minority of players.
---
Isnt this teal universal ?
---
Well whatever it is, I feel your pain. You and I have both been there.
---
Since mid March 2019 and at lvl 100
---
Read the last word of the title.
---
Tbh I didn't like it as much as the others. Rainbow is magic was cool because there was so much shit to see and it wasn't unbalanced. Showdown was cool because of the high powered, low mag size fun and it was a once off map. Doktors curse was unbalanced, no guns didn't keep like rainbow and if you spawned in during pick phase you could get a gun which insta won you the game
---
Either your team is bad or the other team is better
---
Finka then becomes a combo of ash and doc, she rushes and only boosts/heals herself.

my man the team i just versed all were plat 1+ the worst player had 1.6 k/d and they were all like lvl 200+
---
my teams highest raned player was a gold 2 with 0.6 k/d and our highest level was 90.
---
this shit doesnt use the rabked matchmaking champ
---
Both of them are based off Chinese characters, so yes, they are mostly the same. Still, it's a weird name for Lesion though, is it meant to be his nick name or something?
---
Yeah, in terms of upgrades you're gonna need to upgrade both CPU and Graphics Card to get a huge performance increase as both are pretty low end. 
---
A 3700x or something similar combined with a 2060, 5700 or a 1660ti will slap on Siege
---
I'd highly recommend getting a recent Ryzen for Siege as they don't get the 100% CPU bug at all whereas a lot of intel CPU's get it.
---
Why does Finka need a rework
---
What's that badge of on the platform? it looks like Doc's medic sign? Could we be getting an attacker who's a healer?
---
I was Away from my PC for the duration of Doktor's curse.
---
I have only seen Gameplay and I missed all the cosmetics for this game mode and on top of that missed the second Halloween running.   
---
Makes me wish Ubi made a way to play the old events, but then they would probably get stale.  
---
This Event looked like a lot of fun, heard mostly good things about it.
---
and? the fuck does that have to do with anything
---
Upvote because furry bad
---
As much as I‚Äôd love that, it was already confirmed that the map would be reworked Theme Park.
---
Yeah I saw that after I commented and was too lazy to edit it
---
Ubi when
---
i got 21 kills in ranked i think i posted it if you want proof
---
So basically doc on offense
---
Ye
---
Fun fact, furries are *the* most aggressive "fandom" for excommunicating nazis, straight up kicking them out of conventions even after they bought tickets.
---
It works the same way as ranked, but it uses casual stats instead of ranked stats. They all probably fuck around in casual therefore their casual stats are shit.
---
Well shit man is it a Post-Apocalyptic Raider or is it Kapkan?
---
(I was going to call you out for using someone else's post until I realized that no... You're the same person. Oops.)

---
OK but no, the point of the boost is to affect all the team and be very quick to start.
---
no shit sherlock, thats how total defeats/flawless wins happen
---
&gt; this shit doesnt use the ranked matchmaking champ
---
Read what I actually wrote. It uses the same system as ranked, yet only using data from casual.
---
Someone pointed out it looks just like Kapkan post apoc style 
---
And I went holy fuck it is 
---
And as I‚Äôm a Valkyrie or Kapkan kind of guy I guess I sub consciously stole Kapkans head look for this
---

I mean even $10's fine. More so asking since it's just a month off rather than wanting to save $10; might as well wait. 
---
Valve's just been up to some nonsense these last few year with ignoring user feedback; doing a bunch of stuff nobody's asked for while ignoring the stuff people ask for. This last week they've done an atrocious update to their Library UI, and a clean majority of the feedback has been negative but they're literally pretending like everybody's fine with it and even going so far as to flag/warn people posting workarounds in the forums. TL;DR I don't feel like giving them my money right now.
---
Possibly. There was another leak about a medic drone attacker, so that could possibly be the new op.
---
Hello peccoR6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dsix92/we_met_bikinibodhi/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Casual doesn‚Äôt affect MMR or ranking, so it‚Äôs a chance to play with/against different levels of players and have a bit of fun, without worrying about your own record. Stop bitching about something so irrelevant.
---
I could see this as a real operator but with some tweaks
---
F
---
Ballsy reload when Garand Thumb is staring you right in the face lol
---
I started in Year 3 Season 3: Grim Sky, as of the writing of this message, I'm level 115.
---
You can rest easy now.
---
Yeah, at the very least, I'd want her boosts to be permanent. Attackers still need a healer like Doc.
---
Its just a still image of a gun and also just sound can someone help this happens on reddit all the time
---
I kept double tapping sprint and leaning to the right.
---
10/10
---
I think she is great rn I just hate the recoil thing cause I use a lot of high recoil guns and being mod spray fucks me up
---
Respectable. Kapkan is one of my favorite Operators to play still
---
Another bad event mode gone. Nothing was lost. I wish they would put these resources in PvE-Missions FITTING for Rainbow Six.
---
It‚Äôs a nice Elite, I‚Äôm glad I bought it. I do like the Halloween skin more, but that glowing head just screams shoot me. So yes, the elite is worth the money if can spare it.
---
casual has it's own matchmaking
---
It has it. It just has a separate MMR. Diamonds/high ranked players either use casual to fuck around, or they rarely play it, so their MMR reflects that.

---
oh my god yes I'd love a medic on attack, Finka is nice but someone who can really heal you up is what we actually need.
---
The defender is an alternative to Jager right?
---
The sound of music i hear
---
Ok. "Shifting" and "Tide" are hints towards the two new operators.

kinda fucked yourself there

Aw man that sucks, cause right before the mode ended people were just meeting front entrance and farming kills. We should've been doing it all along
---
I'm illiterate. Teach me.
---
That made me laugh, thank you.
---
Nice, seems like everyone's got trigger discipline
---
June 5th seems a little late to me
---
ill update my OP to explain since i didn't explain enough clearly,
---
But can you answer the question?
---
Unbalanced for who? If you had at least a three stack you could stand a real good chance at winning as the hiders.
---
&gt; She‚Äôs a global. You press one button and everyone benefits,
---
by this logic Rook is unbalanced too. You press one button at the very beginning of the match, and everyone benefits. You have to put even less thoought into playing that gadget.
---
Yeah it looks pretty fishy on my part can't really lie there but tachanka wasn't with me. I guess the burdens of proof is needed but i honestly don't care because it was a funny clip. Tachanka if you check his level on r6tracker is quite a low level, this is also copper matchmaking so i think he was just being stupid. Also i was laughing at them both if that helps i guess? 
---
People on reddit are one fry away from a potato - Evan Braddock
---
The doc of the attacking team
---
You‚Äôre not the only Kapkan
---
Big F
---
If all goes boosts are permanent there would have to be a no stacking mechanic
---
Hipfiring while moving increases the spread, you gotta ADS or just stand still my dude.
---
That would take too long to choose who you're boosting though
---
Agree!! That bear sounded pedo !!!
---
Console would be inpossiable to do that
---
I agree with this IQ is played in comp already almost every round because she is so strong so I do not see why it's an issue. Echo is ban not because you can't see his drone but because he disorients you and the same thing with lesion but it makes you unable to run. Once you get used to lesion and echos devices they are not hard to see you just have to look for them. Or idk bring an IQ
---
Just give a staff/contraption blackback that looks like something from ghost busters that shoot healing nano machines.
---
I think we‚Äôre on the same page as to why it‚Äôs a bad idea, I just wont even entertain the thought.
---
india and kenya
---
Thanks üëçüëåüèøüëåüèæüëåüèΩüëåüèºüëåüèª‚úî
---
You‚Äôre talking to the Beach Patrol Valkyrie Main. I could careless about how easy it makes me a target. I look awesome!
---
*Presses rapidly R2*
---
I feel the selection would be too much as no other op really has that
---
Didn't you feel a bit bored in defense ? They even brought a new card to make  people play the discovery match after halloween
---
that'd be good, esp if it had a lower boost, like 15 temporary hp
---
Or she could **hold** the gadget button to deploy tablet and then select 1.  This would also stop her from moving while she has her tablet out like it does with Dokkaebi, meaning she couldn't just spam it on someone.
---
Mostly console, this problem is nowhere near as prevalent on pc
---
They just posted a teaser for the next season on Instagram and twitter
---
I love Mr Bear.
---
My best friend and I play ranked all the time we‚Äôre both plat but he‚Äôs from the UK he plays with me on NA, I would hate for them to do it like that.
---
Unless they made is so if you play all your placements on NA, you can‚Äôt switch until the next season
---
Money isn‚Äôt required to gamble.
---
&gt;I simply don't see a problem with them giving you three out of 24 packs for free and then give you the option to buy the remaining ones with in-game currency.
---
So you don‚Äôt see an issue with extorting people to spend more to get something vs just letting them get what they want directly? Man remember when horse armor upset us? The shit people are okay with now...
---
Same system as ranked but only using data from casual.
---
New op, David Haselhoff. Carries you and your team on his back to the win
---
If your screens blue then don't control it as much that's purely your fault
---
Exactly you have to stand still while someone with an AR sprays you down üòÇ.. they are lack luster imo
---
Bring it again
---
Half of the siege community doesn‚Äôt have the last thing, *skill*
---
I think i like this idea, maybe there should be a different design for the drone so it has a unique sound? Obviously quieter than normal drones like you said but maybe a different tone like Ekko's or Twitch? over all pretty cool idea
---
Finka is already balanced people just don‚Äôt pick her
---
And I'm not talking about next season
---
The new Operator is going to be Aqua man
---
You can‚Äôt appeal this I‚Äôm pretty sure because if you could there would be no way to prove he Raman into it intentionally and people could abuse the system so even if you could they probably wouldn‚Äôt over turn it
---
I think he was just saying it
---
/u/sainsburyshummus
---
I agree. But I hear the next ops will have an attacker with a healing drone.
---
Yeah, it looks cool.
---
Ah fair enough.
---
This seems a lot worse than what we got
---
Ubisoft won't listen to advice unless you lick their boots all the time like a certain YouTuber whose name starts with B and ends with ikiniBodhi
---
what the fuck
---
Looks like some kind of bird. Maybe an owl.
---
[In fact she has the highest win delta at any pick rate of any operator in the game](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/y3s4_attackers_342846.png)
---
Anyone know sth about the release date?
---
This would be neat
---
If they want to make her more viable, they just have to buff her weapons.  Right now, her 308 is the worst AR in the game next to Blackbeard's Mk17, but at least BB has his shields.  
---
The nerf of her character's boost time from 30 seconds to 10 seconds means it's a lot more difficult to use her LMG since... well it's an LMG.  Slower ADS times, super super slow reload times, limited attachments, and all that.  
---
Or at least lower how loud the boost effect is.
---
I now have the big sad
---
Rip
---
The holy grail
---
Until you turn a corner and the slightest off-angle is out of your sight and you get domed. Or the player runs past you and you cannot flick them so up close.
---
The reason of why it's temporary is because adrenaline doesn't instantly heal you
---
Yacht is a lot like plane imo. I think they‚Äôre going for the easier maps to rework before they do many complete rebuilds of maps
---
Spicy
---
you mean Echo elite skin
---
I understand that Yacht requires a much bigger rework than Theme Park but for real, a little bit more and it'll be 3 years since it's been removed from the game. 
---
IIRC they removed Plane / House / Favela as well but at least they've put them in casual rotation at some point (I think they've put Yacht there too but removed it again?)
---
It's just... disheartening? That it's still not back.
---
It sounds interesting. It would have to be able to be destroyed by bullets tho, and only certain defenders would only get one each.
---
Hope y‚Äôall know that the reveal is on sunday
---
I‚Äôve gotten people through smoke I might not of been able to see. So don‚Äôt wear it
---
I loved this game mode, I don‚Äôt expect it to return but I‚Äôll be happy if it does
---
I run the same thing too
---
yikes, don't hate on lore if you don't care. People really like to enjoy something for role... Like watching Avengers not only for the explosions. u feel me?
---
To be fair, I do that with maverick hole all the time. Didn‚Äôt think it will caught so much attention tho.
---
Looks a bit like Peacekeeper
---
I dont see a need for a rework. Finka doesnt work because your team is shit and they dont know when to push. They well wait untill tge buff is gone to rush. If she needs a buff just make it so when someone is revived he has like 40hp and than slowly it rises to 60hp or something like that. Finka main btw.
---
Stand still while shooting my dude
---
Those are stats from y3s4 though. Rook was also higher winrate that season btw. 
---
As of y4s3, blackbeard is the highest on attackers
---
Attackers also usually have way stronger guns so it‚Äôs risky to add healing to them
---
many natives cultures consider the sun as god.
---
That's why I like it. You shouldn't be able to use a gadget free of charge. The best ones make you temporarily sacrifice something (putting you in danger when placing thermite charge, unable to shoot when using pulse scanner, etc.) The operators that can use a gadget without sacrificing something are lame.
---
I had a lot of fun playing in squads with the gamemode, but Ubisoft really knows how to make gamemmodes unfun through their grindy challenges.  
---
I liked playing the Rainbow gamemode.  I didn't like going for what was it... 40 drone kills?
---
Can‚Äôt forget about hitting the flowers in the wall
---
Nah Amaru at least has competent weapons, so no.
---
Add this to the list of gamamodes that should be playable in custom games.
---
Weeeeeeew...
---
Deleted, just like the emails.
---
Still gonna have my face glued to the release, even if it‚Äôs at like 12:00 at night...
---
ZeC
---
Thank you.
---
Lol, good joke, idek anymore, gn i guess, or you're still in school, idk
---
I do, check them out here! [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/709712823/r6s-custom-laser-cut-coasters)
---
Because Rainbow is Magic is objectively the best thing ever, and you are both wrong and a bad person for not liking it.
---
Still want this
---
I'm hyped
---
School makes me yearn for death but yea
---
So we having a naval themed season and we don't get Portuguese Operators?
---
Dont we all?
---
I like theme park, it‚Äôs a lot better that skyscraper
---
People have been wanting a Finka rework just as long as they been wanting a Lion rework so i don't know what you mean.
---
How do the names this season relate to the abilities of the operators?
---
And people don‚Äôt think anything bad about school
---
I know this works with the events but I‚Äôm not sure about map updates. Set ur PCs clock to whatever date and time u need and the relevant event will be available to play. Good luck finding players though üòÖ.
---
[deleted]
---
I watched this far too many times. You can smell the panic lol.
---
Tachanka's weapons are fine. Weapons don't make an operator good or bad though. All about the gadget.
---
I highly doubt that works, but I'll try
---
Yay
---
Over here, the school is shite
---
I already miss this mode. Too much fun was had.
---
I guess you could go about it that way but I'd expect this to be a loading screen for Maltan operators or smtn like that
---
You can‚Äôt be ban from playing casual
---
I'm always up for more drone OPs. But, I have to say, this doesn't seem all that useful to me. Cloak is one thing when applied to a stationary target, but when in motion I feel it would be incredibly easy to detect. To me, this seems like one half of a gadget, similar to the way Dokkaebi can make calls and hack cams.
---
&gt; Maybe not having the window break until you get to it would also be a nice buff.
---
She needs that really bad, or something. Basically the only time you can use her gadget is when no one's around, as it is. It's suicide otherwise.
---
You can already hide the little fuckers well enough without them being invisible. That's probably pushing it a bit.
---
Lol ok weirdo
---
Ive never seen that happen ever. How often have you encountered that? Though now that I think about it I cant remember the last time I got boosted mid firefight.
---
Hotel
---
Oil rig map? That statement makes me realize I want one now.
---
Guys, may I remind you that encouraging violence against a person or a group is against [Reddit's site-wide](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully) rules. Any violations will earn you a free ban.
---
Depends if the Goyo player is incompetent or not.
---
"The leaks say" aka "I watched a YouTube video that claimed to be a leak"
---
Any news on new ops yet?
---
Very true, I don‚Äôt mind them every once in a while
---
I follow rolynoly but the last thing he/she posted was just about the cav elite
---
Same here
---
I dont think you understand the distances involved in medium and long range combat. Siege is entirely CQC.
---
As somewhat of a Monty main I can say, c4 is not really a threat in a 1v1 scenario. If you can react fast enough just put your shield away and bop em when they pull out the c4. When they do throw it, 1 of 3 options usually work. 1. Move around to catch it with your shield, feels a bit counterintuitive but it works, and if you're lucky, they'll just nuke themselves with it. 2. Back out of their view and face the c4 to block most of the damage. 3. Flick to face the c4 as it detonates then immediately turn back around, this one isn't very reliable.
---
1. Like the other guy said no ops should be all about countering only 1 op.
---
2. If they make this as a secondary gadget it will be way to strong on most of the points. Twitch is not really viable to destroy bandit batteries.
---
Hey, you're the one disagreeing with reality.
---
It worked when I missed the outbreak event but I tried it looooong back, good luck dood.
---
i can see that, i bet it‚Äôs intentional. We will just have to wait and see
---
POGGERS
---
Oh shoot- I need to get my weapon skin now
---
Im not sure if it'll work because the patch being installed, but like I said, I'll try
---
I wish
---
If this season isnt great and dont bring anything new and exiting, it might be my last season.  Y4 has been shitties year so far and this is coming from siege veteran from Y1S1
---
Peek, shoot, move back. You dont keep moving during the shot. OP was swaying around making his spread huge
---
Nah it's just her primary, her gadget is a launcher version if thatcher
---
It would also make her a pain in the ass to play on console, because you would have to select which teammate you want to boost, most likely by highlighting the teammate you want to heal, which would take several precious seconds during which either you or a downed teammate could die, and result in many, many boosts to the wrong teammate
---
Lmao, if you ever need translation, feel free to contact me. Right now it sounds like Kaplan is "defending weak (closest relatable word) cursing."
---
Boss you killed a mission I'm aborting this child.
---
Cool
---
India and Kenya.
---
Still it‚Äôs impossible for defense to counter this. It will take the place of all the hard breacher a because it‚Äôs simply Better
---
This is not a good idea. 1) there is currently no mechanic in the game for selecting like this. 2) by the time the charge got off it would not be needed in 75% of cases. 3) finka is in a fine place right now. not in the meta but she‚Äôs not a horrible pick and is fun and easy to play. also, i think there‚Äôs a reason there‚Äôs no healer on attack. if there wasn‚Äôt there probably would be one by now
---
People thinking's this is really an accident.. like all the seasons lol
---
No it wasn‚Äôt you just had to work together
---
Why isn‚Äôt there a game mode dedicated to removed maps, barletU, old Hereford, old theme park, old Oregon etc
---
dokk is in the perfect place right now. why would they do this
---
Old Oregon?
---
Will do- i‚Äôm kind of glad this one didn‚Äôt get too popular, it‚Äôs a little embarrassing. Won‚Äôt make the same mistake
---
I like tower more than I like the new maps
---
there‚Äôs probably a reason there‚Äôs no healing attacker
---
Well obviously
---
I already know, others have commented it before you. You don‚Äôt have to say what 5 others already have.
---
Actually
---
#ROCKETU PAAUCH
---
It a rework of Theme Park
---
dang it i didnt get my last pack
---
Lurkers were my go to as the hunter. If their Nightstride ability ran out I'd sometimes follow their trail without scanning and let their prints lead me right to them.
---
Ah, there is a rumor that they will be adding cross-platform integration that might allow you to migrate in the future and still play with your friends.
---
Drug lab is a really strong site you just need someone on connector to anti mav. Pool room is an easy defend. And a good roam clearer can take train with relative ease
---
Yup you actually get put into a match a second or two before you get visual confirmation that you are joining and it can lead to these issues.
---
That‚Äôs not Oregon, that‚Äôs clubhouse
---
For grinding  renown?
---
I think casual sbould be vaster or not?
---
Shooting through reinforced walls would be fun as a defender though. Would have to come with a whole slew of conditions but still.
---
It wad Oregon club house had a similar one aswell
---
I didn't know what you were asking for, and I don't know. Perhaps he will see this thread. Best guess is a 9700k and a 2080, performs very similar if not more, but idk.
---
I wouldn't be sure if it was your internet. Does it happens in other games? Does it happens randomly during the matches or just in tense moments? Chances are you've been Ubishafted. It's quite common to play Siege, everything is fine and the moment you try to move or shot, the game will piss itself from excitment and starts eating glue.
---
Console. All things considered the kill with the pistol was pretty nice, but yeah fuck aiming with a controller.
---
i found the problem. i just had to reinstall Visual C++
---
Yeah i left for a bit too cause of toxic people
---
Hey thanks man
---
Appreciate it
---
*cries in Jackall*
---
Any idea of new ops
---
This wasn‚Äôt an accidental leak. They were revealing it today on all their platforms
---
Love the name
---
Maybe they‚Äôll fix train.
---
Hey man fair enough I can take some constructive criticism. What is wrong with it so I can learn
---
remember to drink a lot of water and pee regularly
---
Are you playing on PC or console? Because they have different recoil patterns for either. Console has mainly vertical recoil as it is more difficult to control the input well.
---
Oooooooooooo water !
---
Yes, tower was
---
Kafe didn't have much to do with Nokk/Warden and Kanal didn't have much to do with Amaru/Goyo. Ember Rise has a jungle theme that Amaru and Goyo's designs are based on but no real relation to the map. The most we can get out of this teaser is that the new ops are probably going to be water based in their designs probably anti-piracy in the Gulf of Aden like the jungle in Ember Rise was anti-cartel operations. So I fully expect someone to be wearing a scuba tank.
---
More likely they just want to play again, and don't care about losing a defense round because they want to complete the kills as attacker  challenge for the curse pack.
---
So basically make her more fragger capable whilst making her interrogation more risky? Hm. Honestly I like that. I‚Äôve always been interested in Cav but the main drawback I always had when playing her was being able to use her pistol due to the recoil and the lack of ability to drag out with her other weapons, especially her Smg.
---
They're fixing both as part of the rework.
---
Am sad :(
---
Mostly just proportions. Look at one shoulder vs the other. Just as an example.
---
Oregon has had no major rework since launch.
---
No new stairs, hatches, walls or anything other than a few vehicles being moved outside iirc.
---
All of these shippy puns mast stop.
---
Ok so I'm gonna try to do a little speculation. 
---
Seasons Names are usually in reference to the Operator's abilities or Map. And since this season we are getting a reworked Theme Park, it is unlikely that the name has to do with the map.
---
The last two seasons had names that related to the Operator's Abilities. 
---
Phantom Sight= Phantom-N√∏kk, Sight-Warden
---
Ember Rise= Ember-Goyo, Rise-Amaru
---
Since the Y4S2, Y4S3, and Y4S4 are all having a previous map reworked, we can assume that the name Shifting Tides relates to the abilities of the Operators. 
---
So Shifting- changing. The ability will have to be something that can be actively altered. A while back I had an idea of an operator that would have a reinforcement panel that could extend vertically. Basically it could act as a door if placed onto a rotation hole, or it could be used in other ways. I think that the "shifting" would come from some kind of fortification placed by the defenders, either something akin to my idea, or more realistically the large shield shown on Harry's wall. 
---
So now for Tides. Well if my previous reasoning is correct, this will be reserved for the attacker. Now the gadget itself is hard to deduce. Maybe the attacker would have a drone that can alter its elevation. But honestly I am not sure. Maybe the tides could be a reference to a Thatcher counterpart, and the gadget will have a low and high setting. 
---
One final idea. Let's say the shield is an attacker gadget. Tides are created partially from the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. What if the gadget here would exert a gravitational, or more likely, a magnetic pull on grenades? This could possibly be the "new J√§ger." 
---
Feel free to add ideas. Let's try to get a discussion going.
---
It's because why would you pick anyone else when his gadget is extremely powerful. You can pretty much take care of any projectile with him and no one is as effective at doing it than him. The only fix would be to make a defender that's equally good at taking care of projectiles. But, what does that change? Theres just two jaegers now and you'll probably see them two all the time because now you've got an even more effective defense against projectiles.
---
In essence yes.
---
I use shotguns all the time and even got an ace the other day with Mute. They take getting used to but with good character placements (and make sure you use the laser sight) you can hold down an entire flank.
---
Yes, it is. Not released yet
---
Fair enough I see it. Kinda scrawled it over a double English period. Haha
---
Nope.
---
so, bit of a backstory. Before this game, we were searching another game and then we found a game, but still somehow game just didnt transfer us to that match. so we searched another game not really thinking about what happened and then we found this game, that had one of the salties guys i've seen in a while who was blaming me for everything because i had a bad game. and then this happened only to just add more fuel to flames because ofc he didnt know why i stopped planting. and this isnt ranked btw, its unranked.
---
Nook was just caviera, kaid was just ela, mozzie is just capitao, need I go on? They're not new, original abilities. They're recreations of current gadgets.
---
Aw thats sucks
---
You can't, not love client side debris.
---
Man and I thought itd be a good season
---
Wait what
---
If your friends are bringing you down, play without them? There's no reason to switch to PC if all you need to do is play with different people. Sure swapping platforms makes for a good excuse, but I think you should just be honest with your friends and tell them you want to try and rank up higher. In lots of cases you may find out your friends are propping you up.
---
Hello OMGitsJmd, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dsmaz9/saving_mouse_multiplier/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
He‚Äôs beginning to evolve
---
The one dude with the Sniper Rifle tho
---
I think if all of these were to be implemented, Cav would be used more than jaeger as her ability to quick peek would be nutty. I personally don‚Äôt mind where Cav is right now, at best I‚Äôd decrease the recoil on the pistol.
---
What else is new?
---
I don't get why Smurfs are considered bad, I'm level 130 and still garbage, leave me alone. I just want to play with someone besides the tryhards. (not that you can avoid most of them even in newcomer)
---
Copping that Capitao elite asap
---
Thanks, I'll try that. I wanna return to this game but if casual is in a tough spot then I'll move on to unranked
---
Maybe it will be theme park on an oil rig?
---
So do we get an underwater map? Cuz that would be dope
---
Those white lines in the foreground look like insect wings. Hmmm
---
Ahh okay so he was referring to the sights. I‚Äôm definitely gonna try telex out during vertical, thanks for clearing that up for me
---
New operator blastoise. Special ability hydro pump. Shoot water cannons through the entire map and knock down enemies and drown them with a continuous stream.
---
Bosg acog when?
---
Same
---
"VOTE KICK INITIATED 2/4" lol
---
Pretty much
---
I really like this idea, it would make her a lot more viable
---
I think it's PC because you can see the chat at the right
---
If I can recommend too, if you don‚Äôt have any already, play with a squad. If I‚Äôve learned anything it‚Äôs that playing this game on your own and relying on strangers can be a pain in the ass. https://squads.tm/game-r6 and r/R6STeams are there to help find people. Good luck.
---
Going to miss it. They should bring the old modes   back but with different cosmetics so that they would still feel exclusive
---
Give us double renown weekend.
---
ah ok that explains why we could kill him on defense
---
*Vigil*
---
idk i just clicked a random one i couldn't find one that really fit
---
It‚Äôs a habit
---
Not in multiplayer
---
O. Yeah. Thats good, pc master race
---
Water park?
---
Probably ur router. Restart it
---
Smoke time
---
Why would you even say it is an accident?
---
New valk mains be like
---
I also use a laser sight. Which some people aren‚Äôt fans of, but with Buck having the skeleton key, it makes it a lot more useful to me.
---
Because at the time of me posting this I thought it was. The account deleted the tweet shortly after so i thought it was a fluke.
---
&gt;If you know they have an Echo you should be checking the ceiling before attempting to plant (
---
Just gonna chill onside scanning the whole ceiling to find the drone, shoot it, start plan.... motherfucker brought his second dro... I got rushed because I was echoed...
---
Theres blitz and like 10 random milspec npc's
---
Nice try
---
That would be sick, I feel like the extra .3% on alpha packs and extra renown for being VIP doesn't make a dent at all and if I could spend money on only the season pass and not a whole bunch of R6 credits too I'd much rather do that
---
Oh ok
---
China vs America?
---
Custom
---
Can we get an F in chat?
---
Good.
---
They were thinking of half reinforced walls, but I dont know exactly about this. It seems like a good idea but you should only be able to have at most 2 or we will run into the Goyo 3 shield problem again.
---
That's 5pm in Australia... finally a reveal I can watch without having to get up at midnight!
---
Just the worst. Ever
---
I currently run laser sight as well on it, I forgot what‚Äôs it‚Äôs like to not run laser sights on buck so if anyone has any pros for ditching the laser sight besides the enemy can see it, I would like to know.
---
I wonder if it‚Äôll be Hawaii or the Philippines somewhere island like where there are navel bases??
---
I approve
---
So where is our Polish map?
---
I feel like they've fucked us a few times now, some of the elite sets being trash was bad enough (hello Doc and IQ) but losing out on maps is a bit shitty. We aren't even getting new fucking guns!
---
Cartii
---
the old was fun the new is a dumpster fire.
---
Yeah IceyCat mentioned the bolt action. Must be in the patch notes.
---
New Seasons are always revealed at the PL finals or the Majors
---
Outback
---
No. Not really.
---
Most accurate part is the Ash at 15 health lmao
---
TOWER IS THE GREATEST MAP, defense can actually play outside
---
Well yeah apart from that.
---
All. For the memes.
---
Its because "win delta" is actually a pretty meaningless stat. Thats why Finka (and other operators) fluctuate pretty wildly despite having no changes. Its gets even worse when dealing with lower picked operators.
---
All they do is take the win % of all games with a specific operator (in this case Finka) and compare it to the win % of all games without that specific operator. And then it attributes the entire difference in win % to that specific operator. Which is pretty ridiculous if you understand that game at all (or even just stats). There is no possible way you can say "X operator adds adds a 2% chance of winning over Y operator" based off nothing but win %. Its just silly.
---
I guess you could call them *sea slugs*
---
You way think tachy is bad but you always think that till all five people rush at you while your on you turret
---
Unless it's #BOSGACOG

JK. It has been leaked but not official yet.

Hello Guerra_Diomedea, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dsoln0/help_me_please/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You start the season (before you play any placements) with a hidden MMR that is midway between where you ended the previous season and 2500.  My rule of thumb is that each placement match is worth \~100 points, so if you start at 2600 and go 7-3 in your placements, you would be coming out of placements around 3000MMR.  If you went 3-7 instead, you would come out of placements around 2200MMR.

Faced an Ela hacker today too. She had no attachments but a suppressor literally laser beaming people with no recoil

Anyone else getting titan vibes from d2?

Alright thanks man That explained it well

But they can't give the same weapon different attachments depending on who uses it. Probably because of engine restrictions.
---
That's because it is.

The only factors in how much MMR you gain/lose are the result (W/L), how likely that result was given the two teams' MMR and your uncertainty value (which starts high and goes down as you play more matches within a season).
