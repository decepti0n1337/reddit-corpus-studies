you mean like the bulletproof cameras as secondary gadgets?

Where the fuck is the third

Don‚Äôt know how much of old rainbow, but i know people hated the new one being so different. All i know is rainbow now is so unique and holds a special place in my heart. I‚Äôm sure you can compare it to other games but not in my library. Top 5 fav games ever.
---
What is the music from? I feel like it's so familiar, but I cant place it
---
Finally an accurate shield for blackbeard...
---
And where the hell you gettin 4 I see 2 that‚Äôs it or I‚Äôm blind
---
I really hate that people in the same game say take it chill its  casual but then when I stop carrying they say WTF are you doing we need to win
---
Haha yeah my friends and I will sometimes make this reference when Habanna is picked
---
u/catsruul is just bad at the game. Don't mind him. BB is easily countered if you have a brain.

You can do something similar to this with a Maestro camera zooming in and out

Buck/Hibana on attack and Valk/Frost for defense

Ash with G63C and an Acog on offense.

Rook with MP5 and an Acog on defense

Yes but for ceiling cams and also valk cams

Both I guess?

Oh the YouTube shit and twitch shit I thought that was just a fuckin mark not a watermark

Unfortunately, I hate how accurate this is
---
I hope they remove the glass
---
Bro that was sick! Good work!
---
With that logic play in a five stack so you don‚Äôt have to complain 
---
The game is made for solo queuing, hence the reason there is now RFF so people like you can‚Äôt be as toxic
---
Oof I have 248 and silver 2 and gold 4 :/
---
really pays off to stalk your kapkan :)
---
A bit over 200 hrs, plat 3 i believe, only played last season i havent touched the game since been too busy with other stuff but still respect the game a lot
---
You should try using that LMG on Finka, pretty fun just running around and suppressing people
---
This is a really good ranked strat tho ( for the  hatch )
---
Ok.
---
How is the system to blame here?
---
OP missed his shots and domed the hostage, that's 100% on OP.

Nice clip, I like the fast paced kills lol
---
Ready for pro league
---
Same with revives for me at least
---
I'm not toxic I'm memeing around. If it was made for solo queuing why is it so damn hard to hit diamond solo? I would play in a five stack but one of my players isn't available 24/7 hence we go casual 4 stack and meme around and flex on trash fake diamonds and plats
---
I‚Äôve got a mate who plays airsoft in an S10 mask all the time, no matter the weather, he says it‚Äôs not that bad. Apparently they‚Äôve got stuff built in to help with ventilation and heat. He certainly never seems to have an issue when he‚Äôs sprinting around mid-summer in all black and a gas mask.
---
Should pick it up again. I did.
---
Better idea, don‚Äôt play clash at all ;)
---
Same thing happens to me as well
---
It might be an enemy picking up a armor plate
---
Pretty shitty
---
Definitely not, because it happens from the beginning of the round
---
You can meme without teamkilling and making the game miserable for other people.
---
I have gotten some really spicy plays by playing clash with my team so ill play her when the situaiton calls for her but i can see why people  wouldnt want to play her
---
Yeah occasionally these days. I usually sit at plat levels. But because I'm 30 years old and work 12-hour shifts 5 days a week you can bet I'm generally too tired to sit through a ranked match anymore. On days off oh hell yeah, if I'm just trying to play after work then it's all casual.
---
It‚Äôs been like that for a while. If you shoot the hostage and kill them, you get kicked.
---
Thanks lol it was a knee jerk reaction type thing
---
Possibly
---
And you're the type of player no one in this community likes
---
7950 hours across two accounts on console and PC. Would recommend to have self control as I've spent  over ¬£250 in cosmetics and broken the game disc countless times because of rage
---
What the fuck is Wanted shit going on here?
---
That started happening when the rff update happened. If you do something like give a friendly a player stem a friendly as doc it‚Äôll pop up with the plus and red mid screen
---
Okay what do you want me to do? This is my revenge for people being toxic to me.
---
in casual

On one of my smurfs i got black ice for ash‚Äôs r4c at level 16.

I know this feeling
---
It‚Äôs completely in your hand how you play this game. It‚Äôs not as casual as COD, with quick respawns and jumping over the map, but if you play the casual and not the ranked mode you can rush every objective and just have your fun without any need to play it sweaty. But if you want some tactics, you can do that and especially go to ranked mode (where you shouldn‚Äôt play as casual as in casual)
---
I think the app allows you to take a picture, whereas r6 stats you have to take the time to type it in

Yes, on their screen they can't see the shield at all even on cameras.
---
yes, he's a bitch to play against at high elo. A good black beard is hell when they're on rappel. Sr25 has a very quick TTK as well
---
I mean your using ela shotgun so not very impressive
---
Looks like another case of How-was-that-not-a-headshot-iclitis
---
That‚Äôs stupid, actually just ran into it and was trying to find how 2 counter. Do you know if it gets destroyed via explosives
---
Recruit rush!
---
I want to turn off maps in casual so I never have to play house or plane
---
as much as i love those maps, no, just noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Do you guys recommend the DMR or the AR?
---
Make the m32 a three armor with 2 or 3 reloads. All explosive but with smaller radius than an impact or zofia
---
It‚Äôs ok, but it‚Äôs terrible when compared to her other two guns
---
There are a surprising amount of people who don't sound-whore.
---
They are not equal at all
---
Why not?
---
thank you! Imma buy some.
---
Not that I'm aware of. The only way I know it goes away is if the defender doing it picks up the shield they placed down while doing the glitch. Not sure if that shield being destroyed by any other means will cause the same effect though.
---
lmao
---
No
---
Go fuck yourself
---
Got it, thanks for enduring my interrogation!

I bought it from steam, I'm a PC user,my region is Asia

Happened to me today, and the next match later there were 2 people using deplorable shields to cover their heads
---
He deleted his account, we have already lost him.
---
I should have sent you a gold, keep on doing what you do!
---
You actually don‚Äôt need one here in the states you just have to buy/sell with one
---
man I still have no idea why they said 10 years for this. Like consider that WoW is like just barely older than that and its like the granddaddy of MMOs.
---
This shit should be bannable. Imagine accidentally doing this glitch repeatedly.
---
Gg
---
I don't have a screen cap but they're able to had a shield on server side and gun on personal client side
---
All I saw was a bunch of idiots not playing the objective. Looks like some Copper plays! 
---
Grats on the ace though!
---
At first I thought you bonk'd him with that nade
---
My roommate and I just lost to a kid doing this in the overtime round after our come back and wiped our side.
---
Sounds like you're ruining the game for other people whether deliberate or accidental and deserved the ban. You get a free ban your first kick. So you must have been kicked from more than one game.
---
Oh....

Playing Casual is no indicator of skill. I can play a few matches a day and goof off with my friends. A diamond who never played casual is very obviously going to be better than me. The system should still take Ranked levels into account.

I agree the barbed wire draws attention cuz a lot of people melee the barbed wire and then see it. I also think that her elite makes the traps wayyy to obvious so i will never buy it.
---
Blackbeard attacking an objective (Year 1, colorized)
---
This is an outrage!
---
I just ran into the clash one and it's even worse IMO. Her entire body is covered and she can fire her gun, there's almost no chance to win against it. 
---
I'm pretty pissed right now considering I lost rank because of people cheating. It's happened in 3 matches just today alone.
---
Yeah cause he doesn‚Äôt wanna die during the prep phase.
---
My team and I surrendered, I wasn‚Äôt dealing with that bullshit, there was two people outside, a glitching clash and a glitching maestro. Fuck that.

I wilt get wouldn't call that an exploit
---
Good thing it‚Äôs only in casual lol

This ‚Äúmonstrosity‚Äù was one of the most fun aspects of sledge besides the non nerfed version of the smg itself but then tachanka had to ask for the acog to be banned, so much disappointment.

Lol. If you think a tier list is a matter of opinion, no wonder it is all wrong.
---
I didn‚Äôt know people actually played hostage.
---
Tachanka
---
That‚Äôs a weird way to spell esports master
---
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss

Luck. He would‚Äôve been tracking you if it was hacks. He went to blind fire the cam and hit you. Hence while he even stopped, a hacker would‚Äôve kept going and wiped your team no problem.

Chill üòÇ

you can also see after she killed you and started to reload that she‚Äôs looking directly to where that pulse was at next to you.
---
So, for one dude's (silly) meming intentions, we should open the flood gates to **ALL** the immature toxic punks who like to get sadistic pleasure in killing friendlies and ruining their game?
---
Yeah, no. Not gonna happen.
---
Yikes. Sounds awful
---
The has been happening on PC too. Not so often now but a week ago was like this every other game.
---
You just gotta wait till next season and get a better rank. Don‚Äôt throw and you should be alright. You should get about gold 3.
---
Makes sense, since he either deleted his comment or account after posting.
---
Low self respect coward.
---
Power to you Hibana
---
People need to understand this more, instead of hiding behind aN oPiNiOn Is nEiThEr RiGhT nOr WrOnG.
---
what do you mean by pulse? like a trace from the hacks, or like being spotted?
---
Toxic comments don't make you any better either.
---
Now this is why a legendary skin looks like.
---
Personally, not a fan.
---
I can understand that that happens from time to time, but who hip fires a camera?
---
r/karen
---
Idk but the animation should be this: the camera zooms in on a wall with a Mira facing out. It pops and the glass falls down to show Mira pointing her gun at the camera after just shooting the gas tank
---
No Pulse as in the operator. as you where walking down the hallway Pulse was crouch walking to your right.
---
I suppose there is others out there in a worse situation, but hey, I have black ice so that makes me an alpha lmao
---
Heh. Great job my fellow recruits

He's literally the guy in the picture

What‚Äôs wrong with Cav‚Äôs hand?!

I never said his guns were shit its just his gaget is kinda shit for protection

Big, glitch, and similar words are auto removed with a message to post on r6fix or open a support case- something like that.
---
Pretty cool concept!
---
LOL , I feel dumb . Good catch, you're right. If they were really going for the cam (which was their excuse in game when called out) why would they unzoom then try shooting it. Hax Exposed! Thanks.
---
Yes but we have thatcher
---
Wow stole from insta
---
I remember that i was doing ranked on attack everyone got spawnpeaked and i clutched the 1v5
---
Yeah...

:(
---
Wish I could recommend it but it's the best air rifle I have, I know allot about guns. But not airsoft ones :/
---
It annoys me that he placed the ice candy in a pocket
---
But would totally buy
---
Apparently very easy on Realistic
---
Luck, you can see the surprise, he was trying to hipfire the cam
---
Yeh please tell us what happened. Surely they got a 3 piece.
---
What do you expect from ubi?
---
Lol I'm not sure maybe it's a different glitch? Mira will tpose with her window floating confusing as hell
---
Mine was in a ranked and clearly showed how they made it to diamond

This ice candy is replica. This ice candy is his playful mind.

Hardest you‚Äôve ever tried in rainbow?

excuse me wtf

literally level 140 still 1 pistol black ice. F
---
YTA how would tk'ing fix anything and from some of the stuff you said is that your playing casual and like come on bro it is casual what do you expect?
---
Stick with it and play with people if you can. I was getting frustrated after de ranking from a gold placement down to copper. I slowly climbed my way back to silver. Just takes time and honestly some luck when solo queuing. All it takes is a good hot streak and you‚Äôll be out.
---
This system would be abused and turn to a black market thing where people would sell reknown and ubisoft would only lose money on it
---
AEG or GBB?

I want a M14 GBB so badly but it is toooo expensive and not practical for CQB
---
Aeg, I can link tomorrow. One eye open like a pirate atm

I just lost for that shit
---
the hero we need but we don't deserve
---
Ubisoft, a multi billion dollar company fails to fix gamebreaking bugs over and over again. They've lost all credibility to me.
---
Ik its in the game im talking about when will it come back to cas playlist
---
New team killing system, basically when you kill someone the person you kill has the option to either forgive or not forgive the teamkill, if they don‚Äôt forgive you then any damage you attempt on teammates for the rest of the game is instead inflicted on you
---
Oh thats just fucking amazing. When i post about this like 1 week ago it gets taken down because its already been posted, but this is up top of r/rainbow6
---
DBL online made a video on it.
---
Soo many points
---
no shit me and my mate was playing with a 3 stack and after they failed to vote to kick me the dude in second tk me, oh and this was after they all died on defence and i lost after bringing a 5v1 to 1v1, but hey after i left the dude was top fragging so good for him
---
Unlucky dude, battleeye really doesnt does it?
---
+10
---
That's some faulty wiring ma'am gonna need to rework the whole system.
---
Nice idea to bring the enemy's to glow xD 
---
Ok that was a bad joke but it's a nice idea
---
i was proving how easy it is, i even have a blood orchid all pistol ace in ranked, if you play enough it‚Äôll happen not a big deal, why dont you post your best ace?

what the hell happened there?

Thx

Bloody hell xbox fags
---
Someone explain, please. Where / when was this seen? Has it been confirmed?

Exploits that hackers use to get their hacks working are in the game for years as well. Should we also concentrate on removing those instead of banning hackers? Both go out of their on other platforms to make something, one learns a very specific input variation, the other downloads a program to do something for him. I don't really see a difference.
---
Tyvm, who has the best weapons out of them?
---
Also what's considered the best lineups?
---
Wont it be a bannable offense though? If not, then gotta fight fire with fire.
---
Runde geweken what?  Lillehammer
---
This happend to me as well but I dont think they changed something were probably just unlucky
---
Well, I am dutch, so I speak half Brittish-English and half American English. It's pretty messed up...
---
I‚Äôm gonna stop playing this game until they fix the clash glitch and I suggest you all do it. It‚Äôs extremely hard to encounter clash‚Äôs glitch and people start abusing it. I would teamkill my teammate next round if they dare to pull the clash glitch when we are in defend.
---
Yes it will stay in tts for 3 weeks
---
Just had this happen to me too.
---
As far as I'm aware it's not but I can't be sure
---
Oof
---
Thank you. What would be native 16:10 on my 2k monitor? In this case it doesn't exist I assume as my monitor is 2560 x 1440 and it would need to be 2560 x 1600? So 2304x1440 is the closest to native? 
---
Is there a way to tell what resolution Siege is using when on 16:10?
---
You can do more than that you can put it in paths so you know where they are coming from or be an aggressive alibi main (like myself) and actively use them throughout the match so it always seems moving so never run a skin for that one lucky moment
---
I did have a few goes, legit zero recoil with the Holo and the ability together. Straight shooting all the way home

Oh, ok thanks

Added to that, a beginner has to learn the ropes, and you'll always find more opportunities to use Hibana than jackal. Hibana also happens to be somebody who works well in both a team and solo, while jackal is baitable in solo and really needs a team to shine.

I love jackal, and I love Hibana, but I can't hide the truth that hibana is definitely a better pick, and the faster a beginner learns her, the better
---
My ProLeague-Arctic AA-12 Alibi would like to disagree.
---
I‚Äôd say that is fair but I played casual for 2 hours yesterday and in only one game did I not have to deal with some guy shield glitching
---
Ha, joke's on you! I don't go to parties!
---
i hate spawnpeaking
---
We do have something in common, then.

Hello oZten99, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bno1i5/sorry_for_really_bad_quality_but_i_got_this/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
ah, I didn't know that, thank you
---
I've been doing this ever since I started playing
---
THE TRAITOR IS PLAYING THERMITE THAT INABLE PIECE OF NON RANGED TRASH
---
Wow, you made your account for somebody else. Are you proud of yourself?
---
Others have already alluded to this but I'll be more explicit, casual and ranked play differently from one another mostly due to the rank tied to everyone's account and the penalty for leaving (yes, it's fairly short and thus not tremendously effective to remove people from quitting entirely but it's long enough that people who traditionally leave matches in casual because they perceive it's faster to get back into the action that way can't do so).  Casual will never have great matchmaking and the rule set itself can give one team a significant advantage over the other based on defensive spawns, so it will always be very chaotic and not conducive to determining a winner based on skill.
---
I know Jackal's supposed to be activating his ability but it honestly looks like he's confused and scratching his head
---
Ain't much but it's honest work...

I really think that tachanka needs an acog just like the other 3 speed operators. I think people will actually start using tachanka.
---
Hibana onanhnah
---
Raging over YT well done you üëçüòÇ
---
Not how you spell "Fuse" it is Fuze
---
It's just not a great map design wise. The most common push is just drop Kafe Red stairs  or a meta rush on the skylight. 3 Sites and the bottom one usually isn't very viable and the middle isn't great either. There was a reason it was removed from comp, also who likes window gameplay? I know I don't. Just not fun either in my opinion.
---
I have the same black ice
---
Lol üòÇ
---
It isn‚Äôt the most fun map tbh but there are worst maps. Idk tho I really don‚Äôt mind it.

Dies to a random claymore
---
I've never encountered that spawn peek. I've seen the stairs/supply room by blue and the garage door. I've never seen anyone do a melee hole from 2F when defending basement (in part because I would always spawn construction if the obj is basement).
---
Good, good... Let the hate flow through you
---
security room is second floor, so 2f
---
Thank you man it means alot haha. I figured with enough practice I could nail it. 41 bullets is insane enough and really helps in diamond to have the extra bullets.
---
Let's play. My uplay is INS4NITY.SG
---
BTW how do you get the fuse main thing in your name
---
there are just as many places to get spawn peaked from construction
---
It was at that moment that you realize that your heart was outside your body.
---
What's your ign?
---
Ela: Cocaine is one hell of a drug
---
I only got the summer lesion gun skin

Which means people wont be banning her all the time like it happened on the SI playlist.
---
You missed... Not a whole lot to it... Close, but no cigar.
---
Nice man
---
Haha only one i had on  my alt account!
---
I prefer the m249, unlike most people. The new sight is really clean and you can spray bullets for suppresive fire and never worry about running out of ammo
---
Push that slide release pls
---
unfortunately it really is much simpler than a lot of other things. They just need to add some checks for a couple of things or just break the shield if it is moving from its original spot
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs a repost so preferably not
---
that would be interesting but probably not a viable idea
---
Stock (easily countered)
---
Kitchen (EASILY countered)
---
Stairs (Free 1 tap)
---
Jacuzzi runout (lol)
---
I know the clip OP has also easily counterable, but there are what, 5 windows staring out towards main gate? Whereas construction and Warehouse you can clear each peek one by one and you're in the building within 30 seconds.
---
&gt;I derank to copper4 every season
---
You are literally the type of person OP complains about. If anyone needs to "git gud" it's you. De ranking just to play below your level is pitiful.
---
Hmmm this clip was pretty spicy the only problem is the  eLEpHAnt SKIN ü§î
---
Is this a Bourne Movie?
---
oh no...... Elephant Skin
---
Cool
---
Added you
---
Doesn‚Äôt everyone

plus a construction run out and a freezer spawn peak and main stairs run out
---
NickFuryus
---
Yeah af
---
when did ubi ever keep their promises?
---
Who *doesn't* hate tower?
---
Yesterday I was killed by a full size reinforced wall. Sad I could not get footage.
---
Dude, I‚Äôve gotten the opening kill in a round long before the rest of my team had even entered the building, and one guy manages to get 4K on his way in from the other end. Then begins to curse at everyone ‚Äúwho stole my fucking ace?!!‚Äô‚Äù And sees im the only one with a kill other than him....then I get bullied the entirety of the game. 
---
If I had died early, he probably would have been flanked by the roamer I killed and I would have been to blame for that, right?  It‚Äôs not, ‚Äúthanks for clearing that roamer‚Äù. People are just insecure little cockbags sometimes I guess? Lol
---
Gotta love confirmation bias. Pure assholery
---
Wait that was a thing. Inswear if thats why i couldnt hear someone walking up to me im gonna die
---
Sledge is pretty good and easy to learn
---
Except for the fact that glitches and exploits within the game can be done accidentally (though unlikely) meaning that you can't justify banning everyone that does the glitch.
---
MPX is a headshot machine
---
If you want range, use his semi auto.. thats why it's there
---
Oddly enough thats probably my favourite spot to defend. A lesion or frost can hold most of the ramp/garage side on their own by hiding behind the vending machines.
---
yeah. I play ela on console a lot dude
---
This is a perfect play. Pausing it at any second I can't think of anything you could do to improve on it.
---
?
---
Dead? The growing player base doesn‚Äôt lie but the bugs seriously need to get fixed
---
Yes
---
she picked it up when Ash tried to rush Geisha and got killed. no big deal
---
It‚Äôs cool but the barricade Is supposed to be tan 
---
not green XD
---
Go to YouTube, Reddit won‚Äôt let me post a URL and I‚Äôm not smart enough to hyperlink it
---
Like you can in cs
---
I‚Äôm like that on tower.
---
Self promotion is why
---
&gt;See you say numbers dont lie yet everyone loved/loves ashs gun yet on paper its not even close to being as good as some. Mavs gun is good yet the recoil for it seems unfavorable to most. The reason say the m762 is OP is because im a zofia main obviously but also i feel theres acc no OP AR‚Äôs in the game and its one of the best imo ofc
---
Oh yes. Completely missed your flair. That's on me.
---
I respect your opinion. Buck's my go to gun, as is he my go to op when things go south, but statistically, any gun  with above 740 rpm and 38 damage is a good gun. People seem to sleep on the F90 of gridlock, yet it knocks 1 and 2 armours in 3 shots and has a lower TTK than J√§ger's 416.
---
Ash's was favoured until the nerf. The f2 has too high a firerate for an op that does so much and has so much versatility.
---
I aced with Pulse on Theme Park (God I hate that map)
---
My friend plays normally on 100 100, he always gets accused of using mouse and keyboard
---
Lol wrong thread
---
F
---
I'm also trying to exaggerate a bit...
---
This is the kindest thing I've seen on this thread thank you so much!
---
Could I PM you or something cause I'm lost with all this stuff haha!
---
May aim is _decent_ no more xd
---
To an extent, I agree. However the original commenter did say he enjoyed the clip.
---
"You like this clip? Maybe you will like my other stuff if you check my [social media] out?"
---
See im a console player so Bucks gun for me is alright but it has a bit too much recoil for comfort, controllable but there are other easier options
---
I didn't really see it like that, thank you
---
Guess you can't cosplay other operators if you're not the same race as them /s
---
k lol
---
Cool pic... you do know Fuze is about to fuck the hostage, right?
---
Agreed. M762 is remarkably easy.
---
An attacker that interrogates similar to cav.
---
Jackal is having an existential crisis.
---
Operator who for some time can see blurry version of what one of the opp is seeing.
---
Operator whose drone can make little explosion
---
But what we really need is jager 2.0 maybe someone who defuses projectiles and some of them can be reused by who picks them up from device
---
I feel like everyone has that one map they hate with a burning passion, for me it's Chalet. I always play trash on it and just hate the design of all the sites
---
Well no, he killed you right before the defuse. Game decided that. Not me. It was a close call
---
no
---
All of these gadget that the operators have are explained more in-depth than how you have presented them. This doesn‚Äôt make these guys superhuman (except for Finka), and some of the tech is actually being research in this current age, or takes aspects of real technology that exists and makes it a little more sci-fi for gameplay.
---
This team up looks less like a Avengers team up, and I don‚Äôt think we can truly make one. 
---
But A +1 for effort, you got yourself nice teams.
---
In the operator video I think.  XD
---
Shields =  Teleporter
---
No probs. Glhf.
---
She picked it up in her operator intro
---
Sent yah a PM. That was an epic video. I can‚Äôt wait to vote for you!
---
Who is sleeping on that gun? That's the only gun I use when I play ela which I dont normally play her
---
Close but he still got it before
---
R6fix report it and wait till it fixes
---
Right now, AR.
---
Dmr was nerfed to 3 shots on 3 arnours, so you are better off taking the AR unless you have recoil control issues, which does 3 shot anyway.
---
Nope
---
Im almost there im on 90 40, no need for the vertical to be so high
---
Who cares?
---
It outdamages the AUG and the higher ROF means more chances for headshots. Only reason I never use it is because of that ADS time.
---
You can just tell from your movements that you‚Äôre a good player
---
But isn‚Äôt Lesion Chinese?
---
Can we just take a moment to appreciate peace promoting Thermite at the back?
---
Ah ok never knew that lol, how much are they do they still have that increasing cost thing
---
Nice. I still can't see my enimies when the shoot me at point blank!
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to flirt without being creepy‚Äù sums up every interaction I‚Äôve had with the opposite sex

How do you have so much recoil control with that gun?? I feel like that gun sprays like crazy

Edit: ash still has an acog on the g36 but...ya
---
bruh they really do

Thermite is underrated

you‚Äôve literally always been able to

---
I'm glad the mods haven't removed this yet, they removed mine earlier today for: "spreading awareness of glitch/giving glitcher satisfaction"
---
I said willfully. Do you think someone is going to accidentally do this enough times to get a ban?
---
no leave that god tier shotgun alone, shotguns are mostly terrible in siege atleast let us have one good one.
---
Capitao is really good now. Ash lost ACOG on r4c. Blitz has a delay and bigger cooldown for his flash. Lion has been reworked (players get alibi pinged instead of the red outline). Mp5 does less damage now.
---
There have been a couple operators that have come out since the last time you played that changed the meta. I advise you watch some videos on the new seasons that have come out.
---
False

Why does this have 400 upvotes. It's literally a picture of barbwire from T hunt.

0 recoil on scorpion?! IMPOSSIBLE!

It was edgy, shooting kids and calling it an ace is edgy fren...

pretty sure that‚Äôs the first thing I did lmao

I am trying to point out that u said real life in the title. No shit, i dont think that thats ingame.
---
I see
---
I use both I was just looking for people opinions I used vertical for most of my beginner moments
---
HACKER!!!!! /s

Sounds good. In the end it is all personal preference.
---
This isn't witch hunting, he's telling you to be careful of a cheater
---
Nah, just luck
---
You‚Äôre disgusting dude. Well done.
---
How can i choose my main operator? I'm new here.
---
And that‚Äôs against the rules, read rule 2
---
I fuckin love Hereford, my mates hate it tho. That‚Äôs why we drone out and put drones everywhere then we stack up for a full on rush. It‚Äôs pretty terrifying when your entire team chucks smokes on blind spots and then stun grenades plus grenades everything before rushing with with blitz in front then finka and lion and dokkaebi with the last jackal rear guarding.
---
they nerfed her enough she needs it lmao
---
It‚Äôs a glitch that has been there for a while, but in typical Ubisoft fashion, it isn‚Äôt fixed.
---
Witch hunting is still the wrong term. Also, that's a really stupid rule
---
 It took me a good minute to realise
---
Take a Step Back by Ski Mask the Slump God
---
Since you are an ela main, def  vertical (for her rediculus recoil)
---
Yeah fuck this. I wont be playing for awhile.
---
Looks to be a bad idea to go anywhere with that on.
---
Yeah no you deserved it

No there was plenty of time i got it. I cut it out awhile back because I was screaming some random stuff in french
---
Shoot her or something!
---
&gt;the ARX does more DPS than Jager‚Äôs gun
---
Yeah, your point? Most attackers guns do more DPS than defenders weapons. But if you compare the ARX to other attackers it‚Äôs bottom of the list. And it‚Äôs not just the 20 round mag; most guns in siege if they have low ammo have a decent reload speed, but the ARX only has 20 rounds and also has an abysmal reload speed. The least ubi could do would be let it have a grip. The majority of people I see playing nomad use the AL just because of how limited the ARX is in multiple encounters.
---
Start small, build up
---
 You can‚Äôt get banned for glitching. Nobody has been lol
---
Its in ranked to
---
This is one of the reasons why I don't play hostage at all. Too easy to get banned. The last time I played, I got a guy banned because I was holding the hostage and my teammate came towards me and hit the kapkan trap and I turned at the last second and it exploded on the hostage and killed him, that guy then got banned. That was a while back though
---
Casual
---
Ok they are trying to patch it but if u won‚Äôt play bc of glitches u will never play any game again
---
I don‚Äôt know maybe because I generally use ops with faster guns but even tachanka‚Äôs primary feels better
---
I still play but this was patched ages ago and now its bacl
---
ARX is top 7 DPS guns on attack. Look at the Rogue-9 chart.
---
Well this is the last time we hear from you
---
It won't be here for long, they're reworking shields and Y4S2 is close

Welp his primary is an smg so I would hope so. Even if her guns weren't as good as they were her gadget would still make up for it
---
Coastline roof glitch
---
Dude mad respect
---
The recoils really isn‚Äôt my biggest gripe with the weapon, it‚Äôs the low magazine size combined with the slow reload. The gun *statistically* is better than the AK, but the ARX leaves you so venerable because of the mag size/reload speed catastrophe it has. My thought process is to have the ARX have a grip while the AK can‚Äôt, making the choice be ‚ÄúAK with more bullets and better reload but worse ROF and DPS, or the ARX with better DPS and ROF, but a tiny mag and slow reload that could get you killed.‚Äù I see the majority of people playing nomad using the AK because of how limited the ARX is even though it‚Äôs better stats wise.
---
3 months after burnt horizon right?

I cant believe u have just discovered this glitch, i‚Äôve been using it for atleast a year in ranked. Dont report me though, my gamertag is MacieJay and i play on pc

And I was wrong; it‚Äôs not top 7 of just attack but top 7 of ALL GUNS. Do your homework!

Overall it's a really great first cosplay, especially as GIGN are quite tough to cosplay compared to someone like IQ who just needs a helmet and vest. The best I could say is a less baggy boiler suit, you could try sewing it up a little, or using a few more armour plates like shin guards to cover it. It's just because doc and rook are generally quite chunky and thicc. Also a good pair of military style boots always goes a long way for a rainbow cosplay. You can usually find a cheap pair of military style black boots for about ¬£20 so you can tuck or blouse your boiler suit around the boots.
---
Keep it up, man! Looks great and it'll only get better!
---
With Thatchers helicopter
---
Probably the same as the same Month glitch that happened not long ago.  If so it should be a quick and easy fix.
---
ahh well fuck me then.
---
I love this skin, but it feels like anyone wearing it in Casual is out to tk me
---
Hopefully
---
It is just a game but why ruin someone else‚Äôs fun because you have to satiate your superiority complex? And if you‚Äôre literally playing the game just to get a reaction out of someone by teamkilling them, what‚Äôs the point? What a sad life you must live.
---
You should totally be Doc instead of Rook. White gloves, some first aid, paint the  front of the helmet white. For sure needs a walkie.

Hello DeMarc25, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bntqvj/clash_shield_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Just had this on Xbox
---
I haven‚Äôt touched this game in weeks because of stuff like this. Also another reason why even when I did play, I would never solo queue
---
Remember, no german!
---
Here‚Äôs an actual explanation.   
---
When Ubisoft does a map rework they don‚Äôt make it a dedicated season.  Three maps are set to be reworked this year/ cycle, and with the first rework we‚Äôll be getting a Danish op and a US secret service op.   
---
I can understand it might feel like your country got jipped out of a season, but it‚Äôs still super cool to see it represented in game!  (At least you‚Äôre not Poland who got promised a whole dedicated season)
---
Does it ever mess with aim?
---
Sounds kind of like glaz without the ability to see through smoke and probably not a sniper rifle
---
Glaz?
---
Lower ranks in this game are toxic for dumb reasons, higher ranks are toxic for good reasons. Occasionally somewhere in the middle you find the sweet spot of minimal toxicity. That‚Äôs the good siege.
---
It‚Äôs a very different weapon on console than on PC where headshots are king. A lot of the kills even up to high platinum on console comes down to body shots. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that a three speed with the ability to slow enemies down with barbed wire and her gadget also has access to a semi-automatic shotgun with great damage and the ability to fit an extended barrel. 
---
It‚Äôs a real problem that any idiot in high plat can pull out the Ela shotty and do serious damage without any kind of thought or aim. Just my opinion.
---

If he had hair it‚Äôd be great. The bald+beard biker look it‚Äôs just too cliche for my taste.
---
Went 17 and 6 and didn‚Äôt win feelsbadman
---
He used the same helicopter for tower, skycraper and chalet.
---
Very nice
---
ü¶Å
---
You know he had to recruit to 'em
---
Hmmm all of them
---
Hmmm. Okay
---
congratulations. nobody cares.  you had a good game and you‚Äôre quitting? get lost then
---
Thats the ultimate goal

Doing the Lord‚Äôs work brother

That mute's head

THICC
---
Finally a good ranked clip
---
congratulations. you can use google
---
Fortunally i dont see this glitch in my games but if i see someone doing it, gone with that bitches head
---
(Or his vital organs, those work too)
---
Oh ok ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I would want knife only and shotgun only lobbies before this
---
He still lost...
---
Just stick with casual, use your drones, watch videos for help and play with friends
---
yo fr all my best clutches are with ela
---
So what you didn't win. Welcome to Rainbow 6, where you lose, A LOT. If you can't handle that then find another game.
---
you go to ubisoft support
---
I hope this was a joke. Otherwise, it'd just pathetic you are trying to defame such a good guy.
---
what‚Äôs your point. you can‚Äôt win every game
---
Causal is better for learning than, NC?
---
it's not hard to counter if you can aim and move.
---
I can already see myself walking down the street wearing a hoodie with this on it
---
Dammm this makes me want to pass on gettin on later
---
Are you sure this is right sub reddit
---
Just because of the smurfs
---
Try getting a support ticket and live chat with ubi. They can reset 2FA on your account so you can access it.
---
xD
---
It's... Actually not a bad idea. But it's uber vanilla compared to recent additions of holograms, laser cameras, drone parasites, and magical hexagon traps that spawn from essentially thin air.
---
I love Kafe, in terms of ranked maps, I either dislike Chalet or Theme Park the most.
---
Nvm I don't know what you're talking about and others do
---
SCOTLAND FOREVER INTENSIFIES
---
He carried like fucking crazy, and his team didn‚Äôt really do much, with the amount of kills he got his teammates could‚Äôve played the objective, but apparently it looks like they didn‚Äôt
---
I hate this map but it‚Äôs the map that I have most of my aces in
---
gun
---
Once on club house in basement we were rushed and my entire team died immediately and I was Mira, i shot an ash coming through a wall she breached, got a triple nitro cell kill on a blitz and 2 others than ran out of the tunnel and knifed jackal
---
What would be the point
---
Well then that‚Äôs stupid
---
I only get sad/angry when some steals my ace by killing the last guy that i was just about to kill. Like if they kill the guy before i get my first kill its fine but if he shoots him just before me and it's the 5th kill then id be pissed, id still not tk though.
---
Best thing you can do is make them kill you again and get them banned, that's a lot of fun i just shoot em in the leg once after they tk me that makes them instantly shoot me back and say bad aim noob.
---
Go ahead
---
Hi
---
I just came across this kind of thing, And at first, I was really confused, Because I thought it was just montys shield leaning against the wall.
---
May I recommend Minecraft
---
fun, relaxing, and stress free
---
I got back into it myself after taking a break from siege and I have no regrets
---
Ignore the feedback flair.
---
As a monty main watching that monty, it hurt my soul
---
They should‚Äôve aimed for the head. Nah but in all seriousness this is a work of art. The intensity,the music and choreography are well fitted.
---
All operators with a drop shield*
---
i‚Äôve found that explosives are decent for killing them, not destroying the shield since it‚Äôs a glitch. going underneath them if the map allows it also works wonders if you have buck or someone like ash.
---
Ngl pretty T H I C C Q U E
---
Your point still didn't make sense. Finka is average speed with an average gun and she has a higher win rate than ash, hell even blackbeard has a higher win rate than ash and he's borderline 1 speed.
---
Nearly every game of ranked I played today I saw someone doing this or at least trying to do it.
---
As if ranked wasn't in a bad enough state already.
---
Oh shit oh fuck
---
getting rng hip fire*
---
still, good one. These glitches are stupid.
---
Capita√µ can also kill them.
---
I just derp so hard on the new one. I've no problem with tower and fortress, and I love outback all things considering, but my brain just goes "all these squares make a circle" on new Hereford.
---
June 11
---
That‚Äôs rough, let‚Äôs hope this shield/clash bs is patched soon enough
---
Why not just restart the T.Hunt mission after you die and change your attachments/ops from the operator menu? (Unless that's what you meant by return to menu in which case just disregard this as I clearly did not understand what you meant) But yeah, I agree. A gun range would be cool to test new stuff on
---
Where's the original GIF from?

Are you Fucking dense? Yes, obviously good utility/ability is important, but that doesn‚Äôt make an effective rushing op less important.

You play to much casual no one ever picks that site exept if they one two defensive rounds

I fear no man, but that thing, it scares me.

how did you not die? This game baffles me every day

Hello CartiStan, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bnv1a2/headshots_are_broken/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Nope, it was 2v5 cuz my team left
---
I guess it depends on what you‚Äôre bringing the shotgun for. Most of those are decently usable.
---
lol in what way would that solve the MnK issue on console
---
I play only ranked lmao. A lot of people I meet say library is the best
---
I just played a ranked game where every defense round the clash would do this, and the rest of the team would use the deployable shield glitch :/
---
I get a black ice like every 3 packs, I have it for almost every shotty
---
Rank?
---
Once you reach bronze they start picking better sites
---
I'd personally prefer it if it was based off of individual score, say, I lose a game but I dont lose elo because I went 10-4. I find that the current system is flawed due to it being based around your teams score, not your own score.
---
Because I do 1v1 or 1v2s and I did a lot on the old one with 5 good starts on defense and panic when I get into game
---
Is there any explanation to this?
---
Only it obviously isn't because it's round and not match point. Try again
---
just gotta practice a lot. Movement is key with shotguns, because if you know where you're going, you can outplay that roaming doc with the MP5 while you have the M590A1 if you know where to go to hit him. Also never forget about handguns haha
---
It‚Äôs just a google search that anyone could have done
---
Dumb
---
I feel, I've been trying for a few weeks now just to get whatever I can but I usually never get it, it's lame :/
---
What a a waste of money
---
I cant focus while playing but I can do well enough to be plat. But I dunno if thats unique
---
Yea the pack rolls are weird, my friend hasn‚Äôt gotten one black ice and he‚Äôs been playing since the beginning.
---
By allowing them to use it but against pc players. U cant really do anything with a controller so they play with m&amp;k. Similair to what happened to fortnite. Yeah there might be some players who are gonna break the system and play against console players but most wont
---
She used to be everyones main
---
ig they can‚Äôt get kills any other way
---
I think the idea of something much larger than you going down in the depths just activates something primordial, like knowing the possible threat is entirely out of your control if something were to happen
---
On one hand I sort of wish his clones displayed his skins, on the other hand - this video.
---
yeah exactly. Terrorist hunt  is *a way* to do it. There's nothing meant for just testing weapons clean cut, where I could be in a gun range no movement, and lets say, hit escape (or pause) mid situation switch attachments. Where, in 15 seconds I could experience 3 different attachments. Make sense?
---
edit: its amazing how fast these cunts can downvote a post. its like autobots in gaming subs just ready to say fuck your idea/thoughts
---
Idk why ubi said ‚Äúlets have one tk then make friendly fire reverse‚Äù okay so now people will tk once and leave. Why not just idk...make the game have reverse friendly fire on permanently? Would fix the tk problem immensely.
---
Droning/cams. Knowing where they are before they know where you are can make up for shit aim.
---
Well, this clearly isn't an update about the game so...
---
1.) you team killed already 
---
2.) if you knew you already team killed (even if accidental) why shoot right behind your teammate
---
Welp.
---
Time to teamkill everyone who does this. I should get a medal for it not bans, but oh well. Worth it to TK the cunts who do this.
---
*complains about teammates when playing with other people*
---
Is still possible to do this glitch? Few seasons ago it ruined many ranked matched but I thought it has been removed.
---
Wait... Soggy doritos is a sin...
---
not so much the spawnpeeks but the runouts when I am peeking another window are crazy. The L shape part of the lap let's defenders shoot ur back.

Wow
---
You do realize console and pc have way different reaction times especially when you mag dump a semi auto you‚Äôre more focused on firing faster then having your teammates walk in front of you
---
Umm no, because here's the thing buddy.  When you can't even hit anything 2ft of you, you won't get a headshot. And actually hit reg is s bitch sti it won't register anyways. And good on you for not providing any actual evidence or statement because you haven't and only go off what everyone else says about her and don't want to actually say that she is the worst roamer in the game because oh she used to be good so she should be shit more,  yeah alright pal.

WURLDO

Fuck that map

So

Its there as a way to hide his identity in a more comp setting. Or save it from the enrmy getting armor. Its just that peoppe are children and can't handle being normal
---
Limited visibility and mobility, and the feeling of being vulnerable from literally every angle.
---
Happening on Xbox too.
---
True, those Bois with the diamond charm from 4 seasons ago lul
---
I've also heard Clash has it
---
Tbh it should be classified as cheating and should return elo :/

People like you are the problem

Wait. That‚Äôs illegal.

It took me too long to see that the wine bottle wasn‚Äôt a little cannon.
---
It's a joke, but depending on where you are in the arctic that is true. In the south the ice is growing in size in the north it's melting. So it really depends on where the map is there.
---
I don't think the people commenting know how often console players run in front of their teammates while they are firing
---
True
