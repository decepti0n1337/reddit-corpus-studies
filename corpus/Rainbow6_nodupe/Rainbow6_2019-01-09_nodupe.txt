Alright! Will do

Not sure what they‚Äôre gonna do about that either because of how people paid real money to unlock him. Not sure they‚Äôll just be able to give him a new gadget 
---
Truth! I hope that people will stop being so toxic to others in the future! I love the quote you have provided, it really opened my mind about how I should process toxicity. I will definitely take these things and apply it to my future games! Keep encouraging you kids to be good teammates! I think they are on a great path, and I love how your daughter plays fortnite along with your sons. made me smile :)
---
Only game comparable is PUBG.
---
Id like to se irish operators 
---
Cause it sucks
---
THIS would be the single best elite skin in the game
---
I didnt downvote it, its a misunderstanding
---
I go for the jump and as many 360s as possible 
---
Imo I don't like gargoyle and train, too long to drone out gargoyle and train is too easy to take control of for attackers. Also the darkness of the map and the high contrast on console makes it weird as hell to play on. Personally, if a map isn't in PL, it shouldn't be in ranked but just my 2 cents. 
---
The fact she doesn‚Äôt have this as a skin is kind of depressing, amazing work 
---
Mute and move on. If you are physically shaken by words you should not be playing this game
---
Hey 5 days late so im just throwing my own thoughts on the table:
---
In my own experience, the moment a kid starts talking, someone starts *ripping* into them. It's nuts. High Schoolers in particular seem ready and eager to rip into anyone younger than them, like it sets them on a higher level or something.
---
A kid screaming into the mic is obnoxious as shit, but its not inherently toxic. The mute button exists for a reason. Picking fights with someone much younger than you, and being a straightup asshole to them for no particular reason? now *that* is toxic
---
Quit that shit
---
I'm always open to more US ops (Green Berets?), But I might be a little biased being from US. I'd like another Polish season, they really got jipped with operation health. Maybe Russia, you got a lot of space to work with (why no Siberian ops???) 
---
Just please, no more British ops (unless they're Scottish).
---
Shoot an add, DeadPoolDabs, about to start ranked 
---
Damn. At that range you‚Äôd think it would‚Äôve done more damage. Unlucky man that flick was nutE

If the Kanal rework is indeed coming, it'll make sense to have more German Ops. Compared with the rest of the base game countries, Germany is the only one that still has four characters. 
---
I do dat too :)
---
Bonk
---
most games carry a tag that says  "online interactions not rated by ESRB"
---
the ESRB has basically no authority on multiplayer since they can't rate what people will say or do online. they can only rate what the game developers have created intentionally.
---
With discord it might be because your overlay is on. Check to make sure it isn't. If that's not the case I'm not sure.
---
I do that too, but I‚Äôm not as successful ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt point at the fireworks
---
Exactly that‚Äôs what I meant 
---
Yeah a German female defender would be nice as there are no german female defenders as of right now, the only female German in siege is IQ. 
---
E
---
Pixil?
---
You can trick quite easily with Kaid
---
:) thank you I hope you find a good team!
---
So you just alt+f4 instead?
---
Here is a good reason. You get an in-game bug with 30 seconds or so left (crazy to think about it since this game is flawless I know). Rather than restarting the game you quit to menu and re-join and it clears it. You are now still in the next round whereas the extra time to fully load the game would have meant that you were unable to.
---
Sent
---
Remove all windows and just leave the hatch
---
I think we can all agree that lion is busted yeah. But I think this more concerns people like ash and blitz. 
---
Lmao the kaid remembering there's a match going on. "Ok, siege!"
---
Is this silver-gold

You do realize he's banned in pro play because he's THAT oppressive, right?

I havent cheated on csgo in about a week and all the time ive cheated on csgo ive never got banned on siege and i always make sure I have everything closed when I play siege
---
Uhhh, icons stay on no matter what. I play with names and highlights off
---
Do you accidentally teamkill a lot? 
---
I don't think you should balance around cosmetics, that is a really unfair trade off to people who like to look fancy in video games. The guns in a different thing since it's not purely cosmetic.
---
Gold 3-4 
---
They‚Äôre called retards and that‚Äôs what they are
---
The tone of a couple of comments came across as being an excuse. Those pointing it out as an explanation are fine. But too often, especially on this sub, I see people using things like this as excuses for the dev's not solving major issues with their game. 
---
I always do that but i usually fall off 
---
Be prepared of the toxicity tho, one of the most toxic games like LoL, csgo...
---
this would be better as mute or vigil
---
Your patience is awe inspiring .
---
I flirt with both teams,  but when I hear a woman I stop all flirting and get to serious business with them.   (Serious business means Call outs only).   Is that sexist? 
---
But I'm sorry to hear that, that kind of shit is unacceptable.   I usually play with a group if guys and I know for sure none of us would allow this kind of toxicity 
---
I they should've kept this map and made new Hereford a new map altogether
---
Same brand of HDD as you and never had any issues. Plus you‚Äôd have to wait for everyone else to load in so I never saw the point in switching over.
---
It's more just a competitive balance issue than a real preference issue. Like I find upstairs bunk/office near impenetrable, because there's like 20 pixel angles on the entrance to every room. Like you drone someone off of one, and they just move to another.
---
Like visually it looks so real. And as a defender, it's great to have a choice. But against any competent teams, they have a huge advantage on defense, which is infuriating. Sometimes I feel it is borderline impossible to get into the billard room. I've gotten two aces and an insane number of kills just roaming and baiting over in office/bunk/billiard, and I'm not even a great player.
---
TL;DR: I think the concept of realistic cutter is solid, but it's hugely defender sided, in my experience. There's just too much visual clutter to ID targets, especially on pixel angles.
---
Thanks the internet, now everyone will do it because they're sheep
---
That shoulda been the name of the cams if the elite skin was Norse mythology themed.
---
Ubisoft seriously needs to fix shields.
---
Jesus christ it‚Äôs a video game, there is a mute button for a reason stop creating a pity party everyone that‚Äôs ever been on the internet has been harassed and there is realistically no way to stop it. There will always be an asshole.

---
&gt;Right, why would we let the people that play the game the most and have more in game knowledge than anybody else balance the game, right? Lets just let reddit balance the game...
---
everyone in the thread is arguing that this game should be balanced by reddit
---
Playing a game a shit ton dosent mean you know how to balance it. 
---
Desmond?!
---
As much sense as this makes, I doubt ubi would do this. 
---
Ubi: miss an opportunity for more money? Why? Money is awesome!
---
I get voted out half the time
---
o no only 135 fps thats just terrible
---
Ubi needs to implement lots of things like this, especially to take action against wall hackers, but alas, they just ignore it because neckbeards give them money through cosmetics.
---
lol - I understand that it's still good fps, the issue is that my PC is pretty new and I'm already down 100 frames from a week ago. 
---
Take hibana, so many great angles into site.
---
this happen to anyone else? The advanced version included the safari skin pack but i deleted it so i could download the complete edition (i still own both versions) , I was able to download the others but the gold one isn‚Äôt available though i had it previously. Also the ash elite is no longer available even though i had been previously as well. Its been 10 days since customer support escalated should I just buy this stuff again? 
---
title^
---
That was your fault, there was an obvious gap that took was shooting from 
---
Probably because he wasn‚Äôt convicted of cheating or excessive toxic behavior 
---
Tachanka vas Big Chungus, what god would win
---
Yeah, if we let reddit balance de game we might get another #BuffBlitz or some shit like that.
---
And imo yes, playing the game a shit ton in the most competitive way possible means that you know how the game works and how to use every operator to it's maximum capacity, this means that they would know if an operator is broken or not.
---
This is also true because they define the meta, so they know what are the most cancer ops and which are weak.
---
Was this me early today rich-imma-cow btw
---
Well deserved kill
---
Thanks! You‚Äôve ruined my day /s

It's unfair but her ability is ultra useful. You can't have everything.

theres nothing good about playing shield.

I guess I‚Äôm stronger than Superman since I‚Äôm not afraid of women.
---
Honestly, there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúright‚Äù combo. Almost everyone I‚Äôve talked to uses something different. It‚Äôs all about finding what‚Äôs comfortable and works for you. There‚Äôs a bunch of different videos on YouTube describing the pros and cons to big low and high sensitivities, but you‚Äôll just have to try them out for yourself
---
I heard people who wear that get gassed kinda like the holocaust so I‚Äôll pass
---
Balanced in a way. Lot of spawn peek hole for defender and lot of wall to breach for attacker. Bad experience for everyone
---
If you‚Äôre on mobile, go to the r/Rainbow6 home page and click the three dots in the top right corner. From there, click ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù and it should give you the full list of operators to choose from :)
---
relax your game just bugged out, the mute player feature is still there. Just restart the game after the game.

Alright I‚Äôll take ur advice thx man

You can buy the year 3 bundle but no longer the pass
---
Well if she‚Äôs anything like the God of War valkyries then I‚Äôm keeping my distance 
---
What is that, like 5000 dpi? üòÇ
---
They will add a bundle for the year 3 operators, you dont have to buy them individually 
---
he could buy skins with it though, he said he didn't spend any renown on the packs
---
I think it was removed for being as the others have said. Inconsistent. But also due to teamkills often happening more.
---
[removed]
---
On a side note, I kinda hate that scent in our car.
---
No problem! Hope you find what works for you
---
And my virginity,
---
Oh wait no, still there
---
Yes, they're just butt hurt. The only time a spawn peek is considered cheating is when the attackers can't even move a step before getting shot; they're killed instantly as they spawn. Examples being the old bank spawn kill in year 1 when you stood on the railing of top floor and could see attackers spawn street and kill them the instant they spawn.

Iv damke

Don't play montonge

searcghin sometimes is already long enough. i can wait extra minutes to play fair games.

What's with siegie plays when theres a problem avoid it "rank sucks don't play it then" your bad a character "dont take the time to get better"
---
I wish only the best for you and the opening but in all honesty it‚Äôs probably going to be a sea of duplicates, commons and the only legendary would be a charm
---
Back a while ago I was friends with someone on eg during the cod days and liked them since, then I got into r6 and saw they had a team and rooted for them since
---
This has happened to me countless times in Casual, thank God it hasn't happened to me in Ranked. Several of my friends have this issue, but one of them is having the issue in Ranked constantly.
---
He‚Äôs still beautiful to me
---
Using Blitz, yeah you're the only one.
---
Havent played in a while, I thought they removed favela from the game?
---
Man you‚Äôre just asking for it aren‚Äôt you? Risking your entire life to fuck a woman hahaha it‚Äôs so pathetic. Good luck in finding your next slave master. Let me know when your court date is.
---
Getting some chozo statue vibes
---
If a road has a hole in it are you gonna keep driving over the hole or avoid it until it gets fixed
---
Ive never tried it before, but recently when my aim is a little bit better, i think i should give DMRs a try, and the only i feel not really as good as the others is the 417, the mag is way too small compare to others (except glaz and AR 15 of mav, I never used those guns, maybe i will try ar15 next)
---
I think she went 2D
---
Rip it was probably scrim time
---
Im a tachanka main fight me
---
Also ranked does succ
---
You fool. Everyone knows a map isn't good until its so large you can't get to obj until the last 30 seconds.
---
This is so underrated great job!
---
how can you be a plat 1 and be so ignorant at the same time?
---
Gamer Girls are awesome. People who harass them shouldn't just be let go. Same with people who do Clutch or Kick. It's really annoying when you just wanna have fun. I habe a tendency to get into conversations I wasn't originally involved in to try to stop this but when I don't have my mic, I don't have my mic. I don't play ranked very often for that exact reason.
---
I don't get it though. You said that it made you super upset and that you were happy that you lost the ranked match since they deserved it. But if that was the case why didn't you just mute them?
---
*uninstalls*
---
We may share the same luck. But we shall see ;)
---
Its k sorry I assumed you were a sensitive person even though u kind of are but still!! We can be friends and slowly find you 4 more friends so you never get harassed again!

Blackbeard was the first that changed the icon pose. But no idea about this pose

I'm uncomfortable.

I'm sorry, but I'm not really sorry :V

Unless you fuck up then I'm going to flame the shit out of u!! But that's ok because we friends

My recommendation would be to always squad queue, I'm mexican and sometimes people notice my accent and start being racist towards me. I almoat always tend to squad queue with 4 other friends of mine and every now and then I find out I'm playing with other mexicans and we all are giving callouts in english xD.

Every now and then I get the "Are you european?" Card since apparently my accent sounds like it too, so I don't know what fo make of that hahaha.

Yet that's if they do decide to do something like this but over all the animations are just on point

If I'm playing casual and I get favela I just leave the game. Fuck that map.
---
Not always. I have a lot of gamer girl friends who have gone multiple months at a time without being harassed or feeling attacked. The longest was 2 years.
---
Well are we talking ranked or casual if we play together 
---
How could this happen to me

No, SK was bought out by DZ

Yeah I have been playing a little bit but we have just switch to Escape From Tarkov for the time being and have been having a blast!

It's not worth it. Team kills only get a slap on the wrist. This game is just a cash printer and nothing is being done about toxicity other than chat filters.

I‚Äôm glad I got the game for $15 
---
I‚Äôm sorry bb
---
I don‚Äôt take this sub seriously lol
---
I think it's funny that you cite Oregon as being a perfect map because out of all the maps in PL, Oregon is the one that most pros say should be removed from the map pool and reworked.
---
Placing the claymore near the bomb? Thats not a 'trick'
---
Yeah your "friend" realised
---
Killcams are almost never in sync. Because so much of the game works client-side, it's also possible that Blitz' shot registered as hitting the shield so that's what the server received. This is why high ping is cheese.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
At least you didn't get shot through a dead body or a non-despawned plank.
---
Why is stance changing even allowed while falling? Seems like a pretty easy fix for silent dropping would be to lock players into whatever stance they were in when they began falling.

Just have them made yourself, in doing it with the regular r6 hoodies, cause they cost an arm and a leg and the shipping is over 20$ soooo fuuuuck that
---
How can you tell the made it so you cant see rank anymore?
---
Contact your isp that‚Äôs what many supports have told me before
---
by playing against bots on the competitive maps you gain mao expierence and you can get a feeling for every gun if you start playing this like 1h a day you will get better rapidly
---
Q E  spam you mean? It keeps your head from being shot when you are dueling. Also moves your body as well

I've given up on this game as of tonight. I say that, but I'll probably still load up and play tomorrow night. There isn't nearly enough repercussions for team killing. New players are treated  like shit pretty consistently. I don't think I've played a single match tonight without some asshole throwing shit at me or just straight up killing me or someone else. Enough of the community is toxic to where it really taints the majority of decent people just playing the game. Get a refund if you can.
---
this. Kill cam is only a recreation. Ubisoft tried to make it accurate but admits inaccuracy
---
I dont understand this post.
---
An online match, with random people, being rude to you?
---
I get that you were targeted because you were a girl, but this is nothing new.
---
Hell, today, I was TK'd twice because I was using an elephant weapon skin.
---
People are rude, no matter your gender, race, creed, etc.
---
They will find a way to be hateful asshats, and this is why we have the mute option.
---
You couldve opted out "Im a girl" from this post and it will be the exact same as any other, so why did you feel the need to put it in this post?
---
The only way is to play a lot to be fair, the game appears to have a really steep learning curve and by analysing your own death, watching kill cam seeing your own mistake helps for me. Besides that, watching youtubers to see how someone else is playing there are alot of good streamers which you can follow. For the aim, terrorist hunt as a warm up and try to find your own sensitivity that suits best. 
---
Silver plays, or casual. 3 people didn't see the claymore in time? Wow.
---
We are playing right now at the moment, and he was like dude she looks like a pornstar I've seen before, and then I yelled Abella Danger, and he said that yeah it was her.
---
Nice
---
Do this everytime lol, thought I was the only one...
---
Lol who cares?
---
A pornstar, look her up.
---
As neither of us has data on which to base our assertions, we likely will not change our opinions on this matter. I will say, though, that I have not noticed a discernible difference in the prevalence of high-risk plays between casual and ranked; that is, I have not seen a noticeable difference in run outs, risky angles, peeking, etc. 
---
do the reports actually do anything, or am i wasting my time? 
---
Not even worth that honestly. I would get a refund if I could.

There may be a Steam Spring Sale around March and for major one is [Steam Summer sale](https://www.whenisthenextsteamsale.com/) around June.

why didn‚Äôt you just make him play casual

gg noice job pal

In my experience such plays prevail in casual, people tend to be much more reserved in ranked.
---
Nah. It was always 32.

Man he domed you!

Did you try to restart the game or reboot the PC?

That's pretty much everything I do when I encounter such an issue ^^'

Well fuck that that map is fun

Also why he'll never get a rework- even dead horses are free marketing.

eh, It‚Äôs the internet and people have been assholes to each other in online games since before the quake and unreal tournament days.

Regardless of your race, faith, or gender, everyone has been someone trash talk or harassed in game.
---
- Never play siege in a group smaller than 3.  This enables you to take turns team killing someone that makes comments about x race or things about women.  Also helps with vote kick in your favor as well.  If someone wants to be like that, then they can sit the round out, or be kicked!
---
- Never solo queue ranked.  More often than not you are going to be put in a party with people that lack the social skills to be in a group of 3+.
---
Also, If you are old enough to play a game of this rating, you are old enough to not have hurt fee fees, or to mute players that are being assholes to you over chat or text.
---
Ps.  On the bright side, you can post about it and Enjoy white knight karma upvotes!

I can confirm as a former Mont main player, I've got killed way too many times by the same issue while trying to hold a direction as my teammates were working on flanking the attackers I kept occupied.

fuck it bro. do it for the clout

No I don‚Äôt think you do lmao 
---
Well both of you don't care about details
---
1- his sound is STILL glitched. No clue why ubi hasn't solved that yet.
---
2- no clue how you think he makes Hibana redundant. Do you even know what redundant means?
---
BattleyeTM or something like that. I made a repost to cut his name out of the picture.
---
Imaguna a 1v5 situation defuser is planted on a hatch and you destroy it and win. 
---
Goobiepop.
---
Not by one single ability? Why is it that every operator has an opponent that can counter them but he doesn‚Äôt? 
---
So what does redundant mean to you? Because the way you're structuring your sentence doesn't make sense.
---
Diamond looks horrible now. 
---
I'd prefer Ruby or Topaz over that anyday
---
it looks pretty nice on most weapons (ones that don‚Äôt have parts that don‚Äôt count as the gun) and it‚Äôs pretty cool on handguns.

it‚Äôs sort of an achievement and something to show off so personally i‚Äôd get it.

Stop being so defeatist and actually make an effort to be a little friendlier, and maybe someone in your match will think "hey I should be nice too". It goes a longer way than you think.

Name calling and trash talking are (rightly or wrongly) part and parcel of online gaming and always have been, in any game. Like you said, most of that can be resolved by muting players. Toxicity to me is the BS team killing, or deliberately sabotaging the game for the rest of the team.

Just for clarification, common issues i often encounter are: Partial sound cut-off lasting 2 to 20 seconds, total sound cut-off lasting 3 to half the round, ambience and background sound cut-off, repeating gun-fire noises from enemies, teammates, and other sources, high pitched white noise, and many others

Here's another idea for it (Although I think the button idea is probably better). The roller door is indestructible but any operator can open or close it by holding the deploy button near the base of it and rolling it up and down with the camera.
---
the rank you deserve with such a k/d.

I dont know what you were expecting when loading up siege.

Delete the post and send it to Ubisoft Support.
---
There is nothing we can do with this information.
---
Hey /u/david1109 which gun camo is that? 
---
 &gt;natural selection.
---
Best choice of words I've seen on this sub. 
---
It's your internet.  Happens to me too because I have trash wifi.  Basically it means that your router loses your packets for a second or so so the game has to kinda guess where you are going. 
---
 Are you on wifi?  If you are, make sure that dishwasher/microwave or other large appliances are not running if they are in direct line.  
---
Another problem that I personally have is router overheating.  My dad put the router next to our fridge, and the passive heat cooks the router.  The next time you are gaming, just go touch the top if your router and make sure it isn't blazing hot.  I personally taped a computer fan to the bottom of mine.
---
Basically in short, the problem is 100% you internet.  Ethernet is preferable over wifi if you can.  Try restarting your router every once in a while.  Make sure your router is not too hot.  If on wifi, make sure appliances are not blocking signal.
---
Best Ubi can do is to secretly add a system that'd detect it and ban a player. Imagine their reactions when sweet 'You have been permanently banned for cheating' screen appears 
---
If you have it on steam, try to check files integrity.
---
Then open GeForce Experience, check drivers update, and make sure you dont have it optimized.
---
With such specs you should try settings on maximum resolution and high graphics but make sure the scaling is T-AA, max out the sharpness and put render scaling about 80 (if the performance was good enough, put it even higher)

While I agree wholeheartedly, casual is too toxic random and unbalanced at the moment and with the hours that I can play at I can't really find a group
---
But I agree, fuck rank, the focus is fun for me
---
I certainly agree with you about issues you addressed. But solutions you suggested are simply of no use in my opinion. Not only they wont solve anything, they are also absurd. As a player I wouldnt want these particular changes even if I know they would fix ≈üi≈üme of the problems. Issues you addressed are reasonable but solutions are terrible I think. Just for example you call it "giving power to player base via vote option" but I see it more toxicity creating options for idiot 3-men parties. Tons of innocent muted players, going mad. Straight up terrible solutions
---
At First I read "Kyrie" Irving? Lol
---
Yeah but the only reason he's picked in diamond and high plat is the ACOG. Diamond and high plat are all headshot meta, where no matter which version of the Hulkbuster armour you wear, you'll still die as quickly because headshots are what rule there.
---
He's OP in gold or below, but higher up, he has no valuable anti attacker utility. He's just a low risk variable reward Operator.
---
Nah, ubi just must do their game properly. Console shit like cod every year has time cool-down for crouching. And siege being the competitive game on pc has nothing. 
---
this hurts to watch lol
---
1. I have it on uplay and i've already re-installed it
---
2. Drivers are updated
---
3.i can play 100fps on medium but that doesnt fix the problem
---
Yep.
---
Team game.
---
I give you facts, you give me a vague statement. Are you anywhere close to Pro league level pf play? If not, why do you even mention it? Pro league has its own measurements of viability. The fact that an operator is not picked in PL games doean't mean they're bad. It's rather about  a certain operator pool that is essential to current pro meta. You ever watched individual pros playing ranked?

It clearly isn't the case at the moment, armour negates damage so you do less damage to heavy ops than light ops.

Do you play on ps4 by any chance?

16 DLC operators cost 25.000 and 8 DLC operators cost 15.000 Renown regardless of the edition

Man I wish. I'm in too deep

Got season 4 pass already 
---
Yes the vanilla operators you listed are split into 5 different CTUS;
---
&gt; S.A.S - FBI SWAT - GIGN - GSG9 - SPETSNAZ
---
no you will not and there are 2 reasons to that  
---
1 you need to cheat to get banned (permanently)  
---
2 battle eye needs to detect those cheats and let's be honest if you where cheating it wouldn't detect you because it's trash.
---
Calculated...
---
Thought you were listing them separately. You're just arguing for the same thing named differently. Utter waste of time.

I saw Buck with flash bangs, I walked away from my phone for a second.

Sorry Mr.Silver but in higher gold/ plat alibi is almost useless because nobody shoots the holograms.

Instead people play operators more useful for the team and a gadget that is more viable.

Ya but most people want to be the one who disarm the bomb (Mostly) everyone TK just for the disarm

It's just an utterly pointless change.

Very nice, what did you use to make this?

having any skin on your gun is just as "trivial" and "wrong" for the game atmosphere. But wait, its a game. Its not supposed to be a military combat simulator, you can go to arma 3 for that

I‚Äôm not one to get bothered by what people say, but I have literally cried through most of my solo queue ranked matches because of shit like this. I‚Äôm sad to say that I‚Äôm GLAD this is your first experience, but I truly hope you never experience it again.

It‚Äôs been a well known thing since the game came out

---
You're so lost buddy. You don't even have an idea how her gadgets can be used and somehow think you're any higher than me. Sorry to shatter your bubble of illusion but the logic behind my claims does not come from higher gold/plat. Some operators lose a huge ammount of viability when you play solo queue.
---
Oh... oh no... 
---
Beat me to it
---
Not by a defender.
---
Thank you for such a detailed answer, I'll be sure to try out the operators you've suggested with the points you've raised. Definitely really helpful to see what more experienced players think about these sort of aspects. 
---
After playing a breif couple of matches with mute I can see his potential for sure, I'm assuming a pairing with bandit could be good aswell ? 
---
I've seen quite a few people recommend Thatcher and thermite combo aswell, so it's deffinatly one I'm eager to test. Though I mainly solo queue, so effective teamwork can sometimes seem difficult. Still, Thatcher's Emp would definitely help massively. 
---
Yeah Fuze seems really good on bomb and area secure (can't remember the exact name), but I think I might go for sledge on the hostage mode. Just to ensure I don't end up wiping them with the cluster charge accidentally. 
---
Would it be best to practice two attackers and two defenders for a while to just get used to them and how to best implement their gadgets into each situation? Or practice with more of them to be more flexible to the team dynamic ? 
---
It could have some checks that are the sort of thing that get bypassed with cracks, but because the checks weren‚Äôt locking them out the game nobody ever needed to bypass it
---
I won't even bother responding to your ridiculous arguments regarding PL bans, since we've already been there. I didn't say she was OP. I didn't say she was one of the best operators. I said she's good. Are you on drugs?
---
Its ranked btw 
---
Let‚Äôs just say..
---
*IT‚ÄôS A FEATURE*
---
Big chanka 
---
I approve
---
it doesn't matter there would be ways around it players would find ways, ubi notice the issue with teamkilling and are finding ways but it's very hard otherwise don't you think if it wasn't hard there would be solutions already in place?
---
now that is how you fail every single bullet , well done.
---
Go to the home page and press the three dots at the top right and press flair and add it

I remember when this appeared in the dev release of Red Crow. We‚Äôve waited so long

Go to the main home page for the subreddit, tap the three dots and choose change user flair. You can select your main from there

My sides
---
Similar here.  I didn't start playing this game until a month ago.  Right away, I was hooked.  Now, 3 weeks later, the painfully obvious flaws are starting to show their ugly face and I am on the fence if I will purchase season 4.
---
much wow
---
Hes genuinely not and it intrigues me how it doesnt make sense to him.
---
I mean you can't dedicate your time in a match to change a viewpoint of an idiot(s). Best thing you can do is mute and keep playing your game. They will decide what they will do with your callouts. Sadly I don't think Ubisoft can do much either. The only way they will most likely change their attitudes is from the community they live in. But that is already a stretch. There is no easy solution to this. So just mute and grow a thicker skin. You like everyone else male or female will have bad games in their lives. You are the one who can decide if you're affected by it or not. And in the end, nothing matters in an online game. You will forget about it eventually.
---
Thanks

BUT IT DOES!
---
When Ubi made the throw changes Valk cams had the insane range. Then they nerfed it hard.
---
It means your voice chat is disconnected
---
which one ? 
---
Agreed. We use him a lot with mute on Tower.  Block the repel windows on objective side and you force the entire team to take the elevator shafts for entry.
---
Estrellita is the best one
---
Oh yeah dude, shoot me a friend request, I‚Äôm up around that time!
---
The current state of Rook is still very monotonous IMO, there is really nothing interactive whatsoever, since you just straight up pick up the armor from basket.
---
Would like to see some sort of new attacker operator give the ability for its teammates to swap between FMJ and JHP, these two things have been in the game since the beginning of Rainbow Six. FMJ would be the default bullets everyone is using currently, while JHP allows you to shoot your gun on soft wall like M249 in terrorist hunt, and it adds 3HP damage on unrooked target, minus 3HP damage on rooked target. 
---
still can't find anyone to play article 5 with on Xbox ooof
---
My only legendary is the Estrellita :(
---
I used to think the crouch cool down in CSGO was annoying, I hated how I couldn't move. Now I realize I prefer it vastly.
---
How can you tell it's a macro and not just the crouch hold thing?
---
Why should it disconnect?
---
The only buff blitz needs is this fix.
---
just make it like in counter strike. When you spam crouch there you will just start to crouch slower and slower each time you toggle it. It resets after you run then but still. It also feels like your movement speed is going down while you spam it. IMO it's a great system that needs to be implemented in siege.
---
Doge

Funny doge
---
Yes, ofc I heard that. But then again, you ever seen that 6 hp Pulse wipe out 3 enemies in a clutch situation? I'm pretty sure those 3 guys knew he was ~10 hp and at the same time I doubt he was retaking the site with "shit I gotta be careful" mindset. Now, what was the hp indicator good for?
---
Eh, that seemed more an aimbot than anything else. Especially considering that's on console.
---
Unfortunately you can't anymore. This was what I had when they allowed custom messages on flairs and it got grandfathered in when they changed it. If I change my flair, I lose this and I'll never get it back.
---
It's a bug which occurs randomly. Restarting is a solution. 
---
can I fix that somehow?
---
ok
---
Droning is the best bet. If you can't, you can try to smoke or flash. If you have time, rotate. If that isn't an option, try jiggle peeking to bait a shot and prefire the enemy. Nothing will assure a win, but that's the beauty of siege. 
---
Also, it is ok that an enemy has an advantage over you. It is same of asking "how can I win when three guys push at me at once". You can, but not very likely.
---
Yea I feel you bro, people give no shit whatsoever in casuals. You often get flamed only because you give a callout in casual.
---
Would be sweet if this game didnt revolve around instakill headshots.
---
If the game was based on realism more it would be great feature.
---
I'd also recommend a op with no hitbox *cof* ASH *cof
---
I'm taking a break from Siege and playing Ghost War, this was too much for me.
---
Let me just preface this with: I didn't like the game and I genuinely hate what blizzard has become but.
---
Just because a game is 'dead' doesn't mean that it didn't have good ideas. Several queues for example is something great that I would love siege to implement.
---
Oh well, that sucks. Thanks for the info though.

Right?! It‚Äôs like casual is meant for trolling and tk‚Äôing. Having fun or tryharding is always looked down there. I‚Äôve got hatemail just for trying to win and playing well. If I want to troll or stuff I‚Äôll get a full team and we can troll each other together but no reason to ruin others game.

Thanks, Dutch.
---
Alibi brings very little to the game. Like most other people are saying, Maestro. 
---
That could happen but that really specific and situational fam.
---
And its not about that, its about the information being clear.
---
Also if i knew he was low hp id pull out a faster rof gun or spam bullets until 1 hits him. Its not worthless info
---
And yet where's the communication about crouch spamming?
---
Where's the communication about MnK players ruining ranked for years?
---
Sound not working properly?
---
Servers still having problems?
---
Attachments on guns being changed randomly by the game and still it's not aknowledged as a bug?
---
Should I go on? Everyone who played the game since Black Ice knows that this game has been a rollercoaster of problems (remember the aim stutter on ps4 not being fixed for MONTHS? Made the game unplayable) so I think different devs could have done a better job than the actual ones,also considering the good amount of problems the game's still suffering.
---
I don't think this game deserves the player base it has.Numbers should be way lower.
---
If after 4 years all they could think of was implementing the ranked penalty on casual, then they are not actually working on the issue. After the infamous "banwave" everyone should have realised that Ubisoft does not want to punish toxic players _too much_, those people are whales and spend a lot of cash on the game.
---
Slightly sarcastically, I feel this should be tagged with spoilers given lots of people are getting the book

Oh, those old times when there wasn't a single ranked that at least one guy would disconnect mid game. Good old days.
---
The gadget is not useless. Either you lack experience with her or you're just bad and can't see the bigger picture. Whatever the case is, you're just making a fool of yourself because some of us actually know how to play her. Bottomline- nobody said she was op, nobody said there were no better / more viable defenders to pick. I just disagreed with your statement saying she was a bad operator.
---
I found this last night too tf

It still sticks to unbreakable walls unless it's been changed since I last played.

Ubi lists this subreddit as one of the ways to get in touch with them and the community. So this means they "monitor" this place. Yet their interactions are basically zero. Where else should they be posted? Ubisofts official forums? What's the guarantee anyone reads it there? What next? Actually post them a letter for them to toss it into the garbage? 
---
Well thank you I'll give it a try
---
I have 600 hours and I've been Plat for 5 seasons in a row now.
---
Ik
---
I‚Äôve got my new operator concept
---
What platform?
---
I personally don't do it, but the rest of my squad does.
---
This Glitch happened due to Packet loss  
---
you shoot the Hatch and Open ist, your Client knows this Hatch is open and sends this info to the server...  
---
the Server doesn't get the packet so its closed on server side.  
---
Now whenever your Client tells the Server that you're dropping down, the server replies with "you can't because the Hatch is still closed" and it puts you back up
---
This is why Clientsided Destructibility is a bad thing
---
Nice one bug compared to the thousands they patched 
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug. For you and nomad the barricade wasn‚Äôt broken but for Monty the barricade was broken
---
That is really cool. Amazing job. 
---
They did a great job to turn the broken game into a game that is barely functional. Really, top work.

But this game should be at the stratosphere in terms of what it can offer and how well it could be built by more active, passionate, and most importantly: smarter developers. 
---
They're so into pushing out new content to generate money they don't even care that the game's core is actually broken and buggy and riddled with issues. 
---
If you think that's a great way to be, good for you, but personally a guy who paid full price for this game, this is total bullshit and shows the developers just care about the pro league raking money in and pushing out new content which causes more problems for them to fix.
---
I didn't even want to be blitz I got thrown into a match in progress so I was just dicking around and wanted to see if I could pull it off
---
ROAMING MIRAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
---
This is why I quit this game 
---
No hate but you sounds like you only play casual 
---
Absolutely brilliant reply. Utterly fantastic. I bet OP read your comment and thought "damn, I'm wrong, this guy really refuted me". 
---
Just say this to anyone and win the argument. Instantly. 
---
Sublime analysis man.
---
Actually none of them were (last was mine) the other two was also a dead teammates). They just had to stay alive which is still a clutch! 
---
ive only played on the situations mission
---
Or 90K with the season passes. But once you have all the uniforms and crap that you want, then why not buy it?
---
I agree with you about the speed the Crouchspam is done. No one can do it so fast.
---
The Time shoud decrase but without ads? That would be a littel to mutch. I was once in my lifttime in the army of my country and we had to learn to move while aiming. In Crouch or stand or in the Movement. Traind solider should get yoused to it but not 30 times in a Sekond.
---
In my opinion this Game should no kopie any Mechanik from other Games. At last you get a CS GO with overwatch Charakter. I Love this Game because of it's gameplay around Strategy an Strats. And a littel more stinking about  a plan would ne nice. 
---
Aseprite! It's a small program that uses pixel art and comes with animation processes. It's 15$ on its respective website or Steam.

Their own fault for buying a random thing and not knowing what it is.

It's clash

he has a great weapon and great gadget. Im not a maestro extraordinaire, but from my experience the best way to make him work is to place your cameras around the bombs, kill people with your acog mid round, and then hide somewhere and prevent bomb plants with your laser cameras
---
This needs to stop.
---
INCREDIBILIS!!!
---
Looks like someone didnt read dante's inferno, the final circle of hell has a frozen lake. 
---
You're still playing with them.God people are fucked
---
Alright you good
---
Summary:
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead.
---
Can you make a exploite? I like reddit because of it's potenzial to argue about Content.
---
What you're wrong on is that no, you were not taught in any way to sit down and shut up any more then I was. I say that because I was in the same fucking situation as a guy. Yea, I was abused and shut up about it, and now the guy gets to do whatever the fuck he wants with his life because I didn't say a damn thing about it. 
---
I was also bullied and did say something about that. I was ignored or told that the rocks being thrown at my head were kids "just playing".  It happened for years and fucked with my life until i finally did something about it. 
---
So you don‚Äôt want insta kill headshots but also want more realism??
---
Now I‚Äôve never been shot in the head but I also don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs been shot in the head and survived. I‚Äôm like 90% sure that a bullet to the head is a insta kill irl but I‚Äôm no doctor. 
---
Yes give wheels
---
No. If you and or your team can't be nice with randoms you shouldn't be allowed access to the internet let alone play games on it. 
---
Change your quality settings. If you're on Ultra then take it down to the lowest one possible.
---
I see what you did there
---
good however they only need two gadgets and the speakers need a activation button
---
nice video, would be nice if it was 1080p tho
---
Sledge cant use his hammer vertically upward. He's limited to looking down or horizontally. That is, unless of course you're using a shotgun. Buck is significantly better at opening up large quantities of surfaces and yes, his shotgun is incredibly lethal.
---
Ash's rounds are explosive and detonate relatively quick, it's hard to counter if she knows where you are, you aren't aware of that, and an explosive has already lit you up from below. If it doesn't kill you, it will drain a lsignificant percentage of health is the Ash is good with her placements. And Ash's gun allows for more effective shooting than almost every gun in the game. Also, Buck's C8 is notorious for being extremely unweildy, not to mention it's even harder to use through floors. Ash has a much easier time placing shots.
---
Idk why they can't just regularly update for fixes while pushing out their major updates every 3 months. It's not like they're a small company.
---
A few additional notes:
---
Shrike is a member of the Jeggertroppen, the Norwegian all female special forces unit founded in 2014.
---
For balance I am considering giving her Nightingales a limited battery, or... to make things very interesting, making them powered by electrified equipment. They could only be placed on an electrified wall or barbed wire to use as a power source. But this may make her too operator specific as her power is useless if the defenders are not fielding a Kaid or Bandit.
---
Hertz on the other hand, the idea with his microphones is that the heads up display is constantly visible on his screen. He does not need to pull up a phone and can refer to the visualized soundbars to see which microphone (and therefore where) the input is coming from.
---
Other operators can use their phones to pull up a visualization of the wave forms as well. I've thought about having the microphones automatically label themselves with which room they were placed in, as that would make them more useful to an unmic'd team, but I haven't decided yet.
---
Because Hertz has a limited function gadget (Only sound whereas Valk gets cameras) I decided to make him the second defending op with an AR. He gets Bucks C8 SFW, but obviously with the under barrel shotgun removed.
---
According to my (admittedly fairly basic) research, all the weapons I've chosen (or a version of them) is actually in use by Norwegian Special Forces.

Hello Arroyo_6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ae9816/43/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.

Yea, and echo does have it on wrist and can hold it like iq does and use different buttons 
---
Is that the one where they look like the wavy arm car dealership inflatable? 
---
Yes please I‚Äôm tired of playing theme park, skyscraper and fortress on ranked
---
It is I who nuts to that.
---
It's pretty much an exaggeration. I get 1 Pingspike at the end of a 40 minute breach match and get booted with no rewards and a fucking ban. Ty ubi
---
Really good op ideas, but the loadout could use some tweaking. i doubt ubisoft would give them guns that other ops already have
---
Guided missiles n' shit
---
Well the other guy already answered your questions.
---
A direct hit should realistically be an instant kill considering the sheer force, [drill bit](https://youtu.be/NqZNxMdWfEQ?t=7) in front of the breaching round, and timed detonation.
---
And also people are lazy and want their tactics to work on every single map of the game rendering every map the same just with different colors. 
---
The photo of your HK417 is an HK416.   The 417 fires 7.62
---
I would be willing to bet that it‚Äôs a vocal minority that hates the map enough to call for it. I would be further willing to bet that most people didn‚Äôt mind it.
---
Yes sledge is bad compared to buck
---
But bucks weapon faster instant and he switches faster back to his primary than ashe.
---
Ashes explosion isn't that large it is delayed and I never rly got to point where using it this way is better than buck but that's just me.
---
Bucks weapon is on pc okay to handle but yes it is a small downsight for him. But at the end he also has nades 
---
True true. But I still get people at Gold 1 / Plat 3 so I won‚Äôt stop until the kills do. 
---
Yeah i noticed that too. That's a 5.56 mag and the barrel looks too short.
---
Cultural appropriation 
---
I never said Sledge was bad. I said he was limited. And perhaps our perspectives are different bc I play on console
---
They‚Äôre both garbage. 
---
That's some bad luck right there bud.
---
I was about to ask that. All I can hear is the shuffling around.
---
Click store and scroll all the way down 
---
Black beard and maverick make a really good combo for that though
---
Same, actually
---
CLIENT SIDE DEBREEEEE
---
Did you even read what I wrote? 
---
PC has hackers
---
&gt;and it‚Äôs attempt to appeal to COD and fortnite fans
---
oh come off it
---
Yeah like does the OP even realize how bad the game was at launch and all the hard work that the devs have put in to get it to the point it‚Äôs at today? 
---
That is true, though it's hard for me personally to strategize that kind of thing since I've just switched to PC and all my friends play on Xbox
---
Yeah I don't like sledge his weapons aren't that nice compared to mav zofia or buck and his gadget isn't superior to me but that's also me.
---
Yeah that's what is thought because many console players complain about 3 sppeds and ashe
---
&gt; If I try to purchase credits in game, it says, "Redirecting to Steam" and does nothing.

You should have told me it was a transgender, i did not need to see that.

And u already spent money on it?
---
\&gt;  This is evidence that the British should not design modern firearms   
---
You know Accuracy International is a British company that makes some of the best long range rifles in the world in use by various countries right?  
---
The reason why it was given to H&amp;K was because it was partially British owned at the time who in turn actually did a pretty great job eliminating the reliability issues thanks to better internals, higher quality magazines and the like. Weight aside and perhaps slight awkwardness when it comes to shooting off hand it's a good rifle now and the internet needs to know that.  
---
Main reason SF wouldn't use it is for deniability for the most part I imagine.  
---
Kewl post though, I like things like this. Wish the SAS got stuff that they actually use 
---
Ah i dno because they released a lord Tachanka bundleüòï
---
Omfg I‚Äôd be pissed
---
Is it really luck when the chances are way higher than they should be?  Anybody that plays any of the shield operators frequently can attest that kills like this happen way more often then they should.
---
Except they wouldn't. 2 and 1 speeds on attack would still have their ACOGs, and because peak speed would be uniform, the gunfight will more-closely rely on gunakill, not so much on speakers advantage (which 3 speeds utilize best). If you read my post you would know that I knew 1 speed defenders are the only defenders with ACOG. And as I said before, I'm actually for taking the sight out of the game entirely bc it doesn't fit the premise in my opinion, but I realize that people love the sight too much to make that an option. Peaker's advantage would still be determining factor in whether or not the angle-holder wins the fight. Angle holders are disadvantageous when a 3 speed quick-peaks, and lose more often than not at higher levels bc an attacker can land a shot before the defender even sees them round the corner. On attack, I would say speed&gt;armor. On defense I would argue inversely.
---
But no elite, we can hope haha
---
2 out of 3 times I break a chunk of barricade the debris stays inside the whole. I was dying due to that so often due to it I stopped playing for a couple months

That would pretty much just make him a better IQ tho

i bought the gold Pack. it comes with 1200 R6 Credits.

Definitely waiting for the next one...well done üëçüèº

I need reassurance and the emotional support perhaps even a shoulder to cry on if my request doesnt go through. Will you be there for me u/9origamifolder1?! WILL YOU?!!

Ohhh i understand

how do I put blitz main next to my name

That was clean

I almost actually bought thermites sig556 so I'm looking forward to what you have to say about that one üòÇ
---
Yessir
---
Thank you for taking the time to read. I forgot about AI being a British company. They do indeed make amazing rifles. A lot of this was done from memory, and quick research as well. 
---
Why has they got Canadian German and American weapon 
---
Thank you!
---
Probably going to get downvoted for this, but I really don't think this guy is hacking. My buddy (plat 1-2) does one taps like this all the time. This reminded me of something he would do. Then I come to the comments and everyone is claiming hacks.
---
Couldn't it be bound to the scroll?
---
Don't try to excuse your racism and homophobia.
---
I thought about it, too actually. Those have been discontinued though and are hard to track down. Those that are available are commanding a ridiculous price, too.
---
Ahh, I love that game! Thanks for reminding me to play it again.
---
I'm actually a really big fan of the attacker, aside from the weapons, of course. That gadget would actually be a very smart addition to the game.
---
Oh so its a you have to have your phone out to see it i thought just the operator would get a small thing in one of the corners and he would be the only one seeing it
---
I mean...as much damage Operation Health did it also did help a good amount, i would much prefer that Ubisoft just devoted a whole season to fixing issues in the game rather than working on small things with very little impact.
---
This clip has very much made my day. Thank you. lol.
---
Problem with that is people are much more likely to report you, than commend you. Being a decent person is expected and less likely to be noticed. It would be much harder to come back from 4 negatives than to lose positives
---
You are already dead = omae wa mou shindeiru
---
So basically, shields are unplayable currently and the desync is a huge problem, I‚Äôm basically getting that we need everything to be server side now 
---
Yeah you must have said some serious shit to jump protocol and warrant the instant 15 days. 
---
For real, 9/10 Easter eggs people feel the need to share have been around forever
---
*nani?
---
&gt; theyre a gamble every time you fire at someone.
---
You've just defined the very nature of shotguns. The pellet spread is mostly random, however there will always be one pellet at the center point of aim. The key to minimizing this randomness is using methods to reduce spread (ADS, use laser sight when hipfiring) and reducing the distance to your target.
---
&gt; Also some shotguns (SAS M500) are just straight up better than others (SuperNova)
---
Well obviously some weapons in this game are better than others, and this isn't limited to shotguns, so I'm not sure why you put this here.
---
GOING THROUGH THIS DOOR, AND OH WOW THIS BATHROOM IS A CIRCLE WITH 17 ANGL-
---
FUCK NOMAD BATHROOM 90 HP
---
NANI??
---
I dont understand how the second clip is hacking
---
What‚Äôs wrong with cas?
---
Experienced enemies won't ping you on cameras, but they will still check on you with them.
---
If they had just added another internal stairwell to Hereford, it'd have been excellent. It's only issue was that defenders couldn't go upstairs without going outside if someone was watching the stairwell (which could be done from Shooting Range).
---
Oh yeah, my bad, fixed it. Don't see the reason to downvote me for such a small mistake tho (whoever it was)
---
Right on, right on 
---
Thanks, yours are cool too and while I like the idea of both operators realistically both of them would come out in different seasons. Their abilities are a little too similar. For example if Herts became the popular one people would just refer to Shrike as "offensive Herts". Or like if dokeabis ability had been vigils but for defense cams. In reality I think both your ops should be combined into one, but also reduce the effectiveness of either abilities. 
---
I never understood this idea for Monty and pulse. They make sense to be left on hold even if every other gadget has a toggle option. But we all know Ubisoft, they won‚Äôt fix it, at least for a few years
---
Yeah but what ive seen of zofia shows that she isnt my type of op, where i would be better suited with nomad since traps are good for me
---
I remember thinking to myself that who would use double shotgun when using Mira...It had to happen sometime
---
Options are getting a little limited.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsvarets_Spesialkommando#Weapons
---
The L85 is arguably one of the best ARs in the game. Yeah the Dana‚Äôs is hands down better but I think many people would agree the L85 is better than m4 or either of IQs ARs 
---
You peeking big garage with that shotgun physically hurt me 
---
As someone who uses smoke a lot and loves the FMG 9, my feelings have been hurt. I love the gun in the game, you are right it's fugly but really accurate with a nice spread and recoil.
---
you must be new here
---
Attacker Valk but with sound and an advanced Jackal. I LOVE THIS  
---
No witch-hunting on the sub man
---
Where is the difference? 
---
Great ideas but there needs to be different guns 
---
Skyscraper is just tough because it's so dual sided like Kanal. There's no middle map play. Theme park is similar, but the bottom for has a little more middle play
---
He saw the back view though
---
Recruit isn‚Äôt viable lmao
---
Ubisoft is trying to minimize racial and homophobic slurs, which is absolutely respectable, if they skipped the protocol for you, someone had to have reviewed whatever you said and thought ‚Äúnonoonononononononoon, not appropriate‚Äù PLUS, in a 17 plus game, people should be intelligent enough to NOT use slurs that result in punishments like that. Oh, and a large part of the playerbase is below 17.
---
The most fun/viable ops are most likely to be top mains imo.
---
Sorry what do you mean they fixed it?
---
Nice Firefly crybaby... You can see the blue sun coffee logo underneath
---
If you deal damage to an enemy and if they are killed by a teammate then you will see it in the scoreboard, operators like Clash and Maestro will be doing damage so you will see it on he scoreboard.
---
First of all, you shouldn‚Äôt have been healing him, second, ubi severs shit
---
Maybe try reinstalling graphics drivers? Thats all i can think of right now.
---
I'm sorry. No intention of hurting feelings. 
---
Well that‚Äôs cuz they‚Äôre from those ops ctu
---
Terro hunt is anothet sim actually, only real missions are the last situation and outbreak.
---
(We have the same name btw!)
---
Of course, didn't think of that üòÇ
---
Barb wire is fine where it is. The point isn‚Äôt to slow people but to make sound so you know where they are.
---
Damn, two shotguns? You're a man of danger. 
---
Oh yeah, I've had that happen to a wall before. I was looking through a camera in the bathroom and someone blew one of the walls up, but it didn't fall apart on my end. People were walking through it and shit, but it corrected after 15-30 seconds.
---
Then if a vote kick was ever started u would just tk the guy who started it that‚Äôs a horrible idea 
---
so would you say *she ain‚Äôt go no alibi*?
---
"Points are given to anyone who scans the most terrorists, you will also be given an mvp last winning killcam if you do so as a prize." said anonymous dude.
---
THANK YOU! I've been waiting for someone to catch the reference.
---
I'm still waiting on an operator named Jayne with his ability being the Callahan Full Bore Auto Lock.
---
Yeah, but I think he should be limited to just 2 regardless of how it gets implemented. Having 3 offers way too much versatility.
---
Holy shit for a second there I thought hibana was holding a shield
---
Lieeeeeee
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind an m9
---
They are definitely complementary abilities. I still think they are distinct and strong enough to each stand on their own, but I was thinking that for same season they are too much of a direct counter for each other.
---
How would you variate jager? Simply a device that counters throwable gadgets and such. All I can imagine is a reskined jager if there was an operator similar to him. Do you have an idea for a gadget that could fill his purpose???
---
Jager
---
He has a Carbine rifle not an assault 
---
So basically you want lion to immobilize a whole defensive team. The lion rework wouldn‚Äôt be fair at all , for roamers it would completely fuck them over, defenders would be sitting ducks, and however you want the rework to go it could stop the attackers as well, so what 3-5 seconds of no movement from either team with risk of being hit like a air puff , or getting hit by echo drone, it‚Äôs not fair turning a above average OP into a game changing OP, he is fine the way he is
---
I think its a great idea
---
honestly, i dont see plane getting a rework an time soon. theres only so much you can do with a plane as a map. Unless is a complete rework making the map an airport terminal... which also doesnt sound like that bad of an idea. but once again you can only do so much with a plane for a map. 
---
I said even *if* we assume the concurrent user data represented only unique users each day, than it still only adds up to a small fraction of the total player base. In reality, there is no way that‚Äôs the case. If it were, it would mean that that all PC siege players log on only once per month. While you‚Äôre right that the total number of siege players per day would be higher than the peak concurrent player time, there‚Äôs no way that difference would be enough to offset the fact that many of the players from day to day are the same people. It‚Äôs preposterous to argue that there are more than 90,000 new players every day.  If that were the case, there would be 3 million new PC players every month - Ubisoft reports less than half that many new players across all platforms. 
---
the sad thing is is that it is true
---
You said he deleted his profile but it didnt, reddit just doesnt show who posted deleted comments
---
thanks for this great discussion! 
---
They want around 100-150 operators before working on a new game.
---
They came out and said that the game plan is several years of rainbow six siege up to 100+ operators and only then would they start thinking of a second game so if were at year 4 and nearing 50 ops you‚Äôre likely to have to wait about 4+ years buddy
---
But...but......no one gives a shit about his feelings. 
---
Yo, I've been having this problem with discord as well over the last couple weeks out of nowhere. It's super frustrating. But doing what Origamifolder said isn't a bad idea. 
---
Auzie 
---
This shit right here is why people get reported for hacking a lot in the game to be honest, I've had someone blow out an entire wall and in my game the wall was still fully up I couldn't go through it  and on kill cam the enemy player walked through the wall because it wasn't there for them.
---
Not gonna lie when i first started playing i would just tk first guy i saw next round if i couldn‚Äôt conceive a believable narrative for who done it. But now im a kinder gentler being.....
---
Why nake another r6 game ? They can just fix the current game,mainly the ranked system and some gameplay stuff and tge game would be fine. I do agree that they should stop releasing operators and focus on other things
---
Damnnnn. Exposed his ass
---
I know this is Thermite's line but I swear to GOD I heard my Hibana say it while blowing a hatch.
---
75 operators on each side?? thats gonna take like 50 more operations which is like 20 yrs
---
these guys should team up with the medal of honor and make a medal of honor game. would LOVE that!!!
---
This dude is complaining about not being able to get a decent r6 game, if you cant agree with that being a pretty reasonable issue then I dont think you have played much. Fuck if i had less than an hour at the end  my day every day there is no way in hell im playing siege. Cuz there is a 40% chance every game i fit into that period sucks.
---
Croatia
---
Zofia to take out the castle and a glaz with another player keeping an eye on the door from the window above front door. All the defenders are now fish in a barrel for the attackers.
---
Burn off the ads and Chuck a few nades in.
---
Id like to state that that was so fast it‚Äôs completely ineffective and disorienting for the person doing it
---
Exactly. I can‚Äôt tell. But the crouch seems very snappy in both clips.
---
Yeah. Chief called, this ain't it 
---
The runouts and spawnpeeks are really hard to fight against.
---
The sites are really hard to defend as there are so many softwalls that you can't take cover.
---
But... this clusterfuck is what honestly makes it so fun. It is not balanced, but in casual, it is the perfect map for stupid shit.
---
Nope. R6 is proof that with attention to detail, patience and community feedback bad releases can become something great. R6 was one of the first games to not only prove this point, but become a shining example of how other developers should do it. 
---
Yes, at some point the game will become saturated with operators, is this bad? Certainly not. Use Lol as example. The game needs a rework, system updates and fixes (allot). 
---
R6 is one of the only current games where the fan base has a major input into the outcome of development. Something this special, should not be overlooked.  We need some sort of outcry, a stable well organized push to fix a game that is almost its own genre. The game has came along way, it can go so much further.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you shotgun?
---
Why fix the game when you can add more content and make money
---
Working as intended
---
It's not in the first set of patch notes in the upcoming patch so might be in the game for a while.
---
Why does dokki look anorexic with botox lips? Like one of those divorc√©e from beverly hills... 
---
He's also a near-complete counter to bandit tricking on many sites.
---
‚ÄúReeeeeee I‚Äôm the semantics police‚Äù
---
Ha, without me you wouldn't be getting picked up after your failed spawn peeking
---
I am glad this video exists. I saw the screen shot the other day and people wouldn't sure up about the fact the timer was different by one second. This is an apparent problem for shield ops and needs to be fixed.
---
so ela but slightly different?
---
Hello SUPERMARXX, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aec6cq/iq_your_pics_got_leaked_call_me_asap/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
In LAN games package drops are more rare, but still possible.
---
No it would be an attacker
---
Fabulous 
---
How about when r6s dies out. Cos at one point everygame dies out.
---
they could make a new rainbow six game with like a story. it could be about a Highly dangerous terrorist commander and it could feature each base operator in each Mission. 
---
Remindme bot is still best.
---
Get a tachanka to woo their convenient finka into betraying the zof, have the last guy on your team, a maestro, set up evil eyes outside to antagonize anyone trying to peek. 
---
What gun do I use?
---
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh... shiet.
---
Nothing to expose. I‚Äôve been in and out of the hospital. But thanks.
---
It's a killcam bug.  Every crouch/uncrouch looks like that this season.
---
Also Irish
---
Or Metro game?? the post apocalyptic genre is ruled by Fallout. it needs a new king. 
---
It's Christmas season... Month of December is usually a write-off at most offices.
---
That. 
---
At lower ranks and casual pub squads, there's less strats and coordination 
---
by that same rationale, could i theoretically see enemy defenders under that hole and shoot them without them seeing me? new to game
---
Server side problems are way more common than client side.
---
This feature been here for years, happened to me in year 1
---
Another option would be to have his microphones highlighted or marked on his screen (like Lesion traps). When I microphone picks up non ambient noise Hertz gets a heads up and that mic's icon is highlighted or colored.
---
Several possibilities.
---
so 100 operator special ability? the game has enough operators now. Enough roamers, enough anchors, enough Hard breachers..... 
---
If you mean the odd-looking crouching, that's just a killcam bug.
---
If you mean the shooting through debris, that's because it's client-side.

And he deleted his account

You can get kicked for killing teammates too, yet people very rarely, if hardly ever run into someone‚Äôs fire to try and get them kicked.

Well that's just like my opinion man.

Well I‚Äôm glad it worked for you. I just kept trying it and eventually it did end up working for me. 
---
indeed

Very Well Done, Great Job!

Her secondary smg got nerfed but thats about it. Its still usable up close too anyways.

I sense a disturbance in the force

Not really, a fuze charge is 3 projectiles, so just try to cover two fuzes

This is specifically against the rules as you included the persons gamer tag which is considered witch hunting and not allowed.

Video or it didnt happen...

Special controllers or M&amp;K

Scuff controllers

As a J√§ger main level 130, I can think of maybe twice ever a Fuze has shot 2 charges into the room if he knew my Magpie was there. Also Fuze has 4 projectiles, but magpies can block 3 each.
