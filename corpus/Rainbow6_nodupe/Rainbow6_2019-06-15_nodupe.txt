Haha I was thinking the same thing earlier on and was thinking about switching teams (orange to blue and vica versa) because then the drone n cam colours could make sense. Not sure if I'm thinking straight or its my OCD lol

False, he said "insurance incarnate," therefore, insurance embodied in human form. A video game character is in human form, is it not?

Jeez, I had a controller for 3 years and it was dying, had my current one for 2. Never realised how bad the stick drift was until I played Apex, the setting for the elite controller had a lot of stick drift, was significantly the best option but I was constantly looking down and to the right. Pretty annoying

I have seen enough MnK on higher ranks on

That would be me and my friends

it does, but i think the diamond is animated, so that‚Äôs pretty neat

He totally does look cool
---
It wouldn't be useful at all, watching an angle isn't worth standing on a suicide platform and be detrimental to the team because they'd have to play 4v5 in the building, it doesn't have enough windows for the towers to be useful. They were introduced as a gimmick, and they will stay that way because they are just death beds waiting for someone to get peeked at a window, if someone knows that you're there, you'd have to aim precisely where he's gonna peek from for you to get that kill, with more than one window your chances are doomed. On the other side though, the guy knows exactly where you are and he also knows that your space is so narrow that he wouldn't have too much problem to kill you because you have 0 cover. The problem is that you need to take the defense into account, and once you do, you'll see that you're at a clear disadvantage once you're standing on those narrow spaces.
---
Kinda like Mozzie‚Äôs reloading animation; just to add a little bit of ‚Äúzest‚Äù into the game
---
You know what, bro. Yeah, they should. If it works we only benefit from it
---
No it literally is not. The literal meaning of incarnate is that it's not fictional. A fictional game character cannot be incarnate as it's not made of flesh. Are you a troll or a retard?
---
Yeah the drone colors should be Red if it's an enemy drone same with camera's and if it's your drone it should be like white or blue even
---
these are Sims souls trapped for us to put on display

PS4 has a report player feature. Right under vote to kick. You can a match and immediately report any player you want. 
---
Unless your were talking about a different reporting feature
---
It's not the operation name. It's their CTU. Like finka and lion

I totally agree. We definitely need more of it.

I keep not shooting cameras because I see the blue and I'm still expecting the red üòÇ

Then I highly suggest you get your eyes checked or at least, pay more attention when he switches to pistol.
---
I've already did. I will just wait.
---
It‚Äôs a pc feature that they just left on console without taking taking out. It literally does nothing on console.
---
You forgot /s

How do you figure?

You believe what you want

Did you read the definition? Incarnate can be in human form, and last I checked, Warden is a human. If anyone is the troll, it's you. You're the one who come on this person's comment talking about "you don't know what it means" and now that YOU'VE been proven wrong, you're trying to play victim. No one here is trolling except you, and judging by your username, I'd guess this isn't even your real account, rather your trolling account. Now sit down, read a book, and educate yourself, buddy.

Where did you hear that she was going to be a sniper? If anything, there was only a talk about her having an AR which ended up making her too strong. Concept &amp; Bio artworks often don't reflect what the operators will have after all.

I have experienced far more accidental TKs through C4 than intentional. I could only speculate as that being the reason.

Like, is there proof or "proof"?

Probably cause they dont care or dont know what actually happened.

That's a flash?

They stay in game until the operator belonging to the footprints dies

then your comment is irrelevant and unnecessary

Oh lmao I just woke up when I commented

They say on for 90 seconds or until they die

It looks like a bicycle helmet to me.

That's different. In that particular book, the Mi-Go were real creatures being described by in universe characters. In that universe it would be correct to describe them as nightmares incarnate, because they actually existed there in physical form.
---
Lovecraft didn't refer to them as nightmares incarnated, the fictional characters did.

Ubisoft does not give a fuck, by purchasing this game or the season pass you have officially kissed Ubisofts arse, Ubisoft hates you and does not give a fuck.

Then thats probably the confusion between us. The season probably started but i cant buy the new ops for the next 3 days cause the non season pass owners have to wait a week to get the new ops.

So they just didnt word it right. Its Ubis fault we almost fought. Lets get them instead. Lol

Not just his hipfire, but his evil eyes and his smile too.

Warden could help out a lot if the attackers are playing like that

I just placed myself there, and on the other side of the wall, there was no legs . Idk about the melee while crouched.

Yeah.... Sure

Is this still available?

Because even if you add new ones, that still leaves the problem of having old shitty ones that no one likes to play

** Legacy Operators will cost 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 Renown based on how many Operators from a specific CTU you have unlocked.
---
They locked on PC too its 7 days before regular players can play them and buy them, unless u got the season pass
---
Alrighty that sounds like it won't work then. Figured I would ask. Thank you!
---
The brown skin would be op
---
You understand that it's this way in most FPS games, right? Your bullets come from the center of your screen, though you still have tracers and muzzle flash that come from the gun. This is why headglitches where you cannot see any part of the enemy but their head (not even their gun) can still kill you.
---
Nice magic cards!
---
Marked as solved. I don't believe it is possible.
---
Damn
---
Personally I think warden is worse than tachanka and how would warden help against all that, it takes to long to activate to cleanse a blitz flash and or candela and it lasts for such a short time it‚Äôs almost useless
---
It actually looks like a snake
---
Or a bicycle helmet, or a globe, or a hard hat, or my toilet after 10 bottles of vodka
---
Need the season pass, the oass owners get them a week early
---
You activate it before they flash (i.e.: candela indicators or a blitz rushing u)
---
Probably beacuse you don‚Äôt have the pass or you are in a different uplay account
---
And that's why you don't take too long to prepare at the start of the game
---
Is this the rebreathing diving equipment. If it is that is cool and spooky know some people that died from it
---
I don't get it
---
This is quality gameplay here
---
just to confirm you just want the Y1 OP right?
---
Lesion, alot better
---
I am a new player but from what I have experienced the ranks are super mixed right now. Like I am gold 3 and in the last 3 games I have had there was at least one plat on mine or the other team. And with the new set up all they have to do is win the 3 in a row and get lucky on one switch sides. And if they get defense first they get an even bigger advantage.
---
Jukes are meant to confuse the monty. Human error.
---
He would help but sometimes it‚Äôs just hopeless if your getting lioned and called and the same time
---
Yes I'm aware but what I'm telling you is true. Try it and stop trying to convince me. Go shoot at a wall and ads while shooting. You will see it.
---
Right. I have all the base OPs, Mira, Jackal, Maestro, and Mozzie already. Waiting to get all the year 1 OPs in one swing
---
If they have those exact 5 operators, you guys fucked up during ban phase
---
I agree
---
We can ban 1 attacker
---
Lion
---
Jackal 
---
Finka
---
Doki 
---
Blitz
---
My god your internet
---
They can easily sub in ying, nokk, gridlock, nomad, Blackbeard...
---
nah, it was one of many ddos's
---
So you're telling me that despite the fact that the bullets will ALWAYS originate from the center of your screen, that they will somehow magically go somewhere else because you ADS? Makes no sense. The center of the screen will always remain the center of the screen regardless of ADS or not. The scope reticle will always end up at the center of the screen no matter what.
---
Anyone else think it looks like celestial nighthawk from destiny
---
What program did you use (really good btw)

Y1 OPs are instantly unlocked if you got the deluxe version.

Oh.. okay.

No just a full facemask for a Dr√§ger (They also make rebreathers) SCBA. A whole setup cost a little over $5000.
---
Probably a shield spewing fire from the top making it hard to vault over causing damage? Or possibly if destroyed having a capitao effect.
---
Well. Not sure. If you decide to try it, let us know!
---
The devs were inspired by mobas like Dota2 and LoL, and those games have *more* than a hundreed heroes. Besides, you only get to pick half of them, so it wont be any more cluttered than the current operator gallery that just made it to fifty ops (which will also be split in half next season)
---
Is this mnk?
---
Yes and no, I get the glitches are game breaking atm. But it's not like there's an rasy button for programming a game like this. 
---
As for a company capable enough to compete, there are none. Activisin and EA are too focused on trends. Bethesda is sticking to what they are good at. (for the most part) As for any other devs with the manpower, there aren't many besides Epic, who need to keep Fornite around. 
---
Making a game like Siege properly is ambitious and takes time. Something obvious based on their development so far.
---
If you think Castle is bad, you‚Äôre bad at Castle.
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre keeping count.
---
I'm confused about how that happened... So the Bandit killed Thatcher, and then some guy killed his teammate, and then died to reverse friendly fire, but what happened to Bandit?
---
I‚Äôm not I just searched it
---
Cool
---
please no my eyes
---
I respect your opinion, however I believe that castle is one of the less highly rated operators in terms of ability
---
I thought he was talking about how much changed for a second

Well, there is speculation that Ubisoft has been pulling Siege developers to work on other games. If this is true, then I dont really have sympathy for the game being difficult to fix. This game is making more money than ever, there is no excuse for it.
---
There is a game called Ready Or Not coming next year, though it's hard to tell if it will compete directly with Siege. So far, I would say that it will compete with Siege.
---
I agree with your take on other developers.
---
I remember before that they had a Finka only mission before

For the carbon fiber section I took a carbon fiber cable sleeve and covered a brass tube with it. Then I cast than in resin. The white section is just white acrylic with black lines through it. Drilled a hole through the white half and glued in its brass tube.
---
Turned them all on a lathe then assembled with gold hardware just like the skin
---
poor buck.
---
Another thing I‚Äôm guessing your lower plat?
---
Excellent, literally an impact grenade that bigger, slower, kills you if you mess up
---
free currency (renown) is used to purchase operators and cosmetics. It's not really pay to win, but certain operators can be stronger than others so there's that.
---
hello brother, could u show us how o make it and/or share files. i am also a 3d printer.
---
Nice rush!
---
I know, I am also memeing
---
Just add the palace from Persona 5 kappa
---
She works pretty well but you need to play like an aggressive Cav. As long as you get the first shot in a gunfight, you should win.
---
Sad Bayonetta.
---
Gold 1 atm, teammates aren‚Äôt the best, was plat 2 last season, almost plat 1
---
Its a lot of fun, but there is a steep learning curve. Get ready to die a lot at the beginning!
---
You gain renown after every match. More if you win, less if you lose. You can spend it on uniforms, headgear, weapon skins and operators.
---
Length of time until a new op depends on the op‚Äôs price and how much renown you make per match. Newer operators cost more while older ones cost less.
---
Attachments come with the gun. You can use any attachment the second you own an operator.
---
There really isn‚Äôt a pay to win in this game. You have to use the operator(s) and communicate with your team well enough to win the game. You can‚Äôt just buy levels and steamroll people.
---
There's 46(?) right now. 2 ops a season means another 6 years of content. There isn't a chance in hell Ubisoft supports a game for 10 years and frankly, they'd be fools not to release $iege 2 when the next generation of consoles drop.
---
Awesome
---
the enemy team is ddosing. I had this happen to me a couple of times this season. They still lost though
---
Thanks dude.
---
Thatcher is a great pick. Glaz is very situational and only good if you can hit your shots. Thermite, Hibana, jackal are great all around picks. Just don't die early.
---
Yeah I can tell you got some good console aim but I mean console is filled with mnk nerds which is very frustrating
---

No worries, I found the bundle online anyways!
---
No, they just won't censor the game for us.
---
...polar express...but personally i think he looks more like commissioner gordon from batman
---
I'd recommend Sledge if you're very aggressive since he has frags and his ability allows him a lot of mobility
---
Thatcher is far better suited for teamplay IMO and if you're in a coordinated team...he is a good alternative. 
---
Glaz...his effectiveness is entirely dependant on how good your aim is.
---
He has the highest kill potential if you can aim and shoot well in close quarters. 
---
If your aim is just Ok..then he becomes highly situational, I can tell you though the pressure you feel on defense when a GOOD Glaz is pushing is palpable.
---
Those console controls almost fucked it up üòÇ thx mate
---
Sweet! Glad you found it. Happy hunting.
---
Its ubi Montreal like siege but they hired an entirely new team, i misspoke when i said different studio.
---
Okay but this whole game mode needs to be permanent.
---
Literally every act of state oppression in modern history was committed by police. That's their job.
---
Read Alan Silver's the demand for order in civil society. He talks about how metro police departments were explicitly founded to oppress immigrants and the poor. Southern police departments descended directly from slave catchers. 
---
There's never been a state genocide without police behind it.

release a casino map so pingers stop playing on our servers

For reference our ping would sky rocket when rounds would start, or when the enemy would begin planting or defusing.

I posted a link in the Thingiverse description but basically I found it on Source Filmmaker then converted it with Crowbar into something that would open in Blender. I think SFM has most if not all of the Operators.
---
This hurts just looking at
---
They re-banned her, the glitch is still here
---
Oh thx
---
Ah!
---
Thanks a ton buddy
---
You‚Äôre certainly not the only one. My friends aren‚Äôt liking the new change either. They‚Äôre fine with playing bomb. But the three rounds before switching, especially when we start on attack, is really off putting for them. 
---
I understand that‚Äôs how pro-league does it, but they don‚Äôt play first to four, correct? It seems like three rounds before switching is too much when it‚Äôs first to win four rounds (unless overtime).
---
They gave him crippling depression.
---
I think it's troublesome though to have to need a VPN just to play a game of ranked.
---
Maybe just git gud? It sounds like your a new player crying about the game mechanics. I‚Äôve been playing since op red crow and I haven‚Äôt had any problems. Just watch tips and tricks videos for siege on youtube, that oughta stop your crying.
---
You have to be standing still to be able to get the full effect like it was before

---
&gt; you got ta show evidence 
---
In Soviet Russia, ta show evidence got **you**!
---
I agree, I think it keeps it fresh too, like my mind isn‚Äôt stuck to just attack and then all of a sudden we‚Äôre defense. But yeah
---
So who do you feel has the better utility?

Lol the white component looks like a kazoo.

Feels creepy.

Drone skins ü§û

---
ah, our xbone is w my brother over in the air force
---
I really don‚Äôt enjoy this change. Pick and Ban I love but some maps favor attackers and others favor defenders
---
Giving someone an advantage for three rounds in a row based on luck isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm happy about but hey
---
I got gold 3 this season so I can‚Äôt complain.
---
OF COURSE IT IS, IT‚ÄôS A BANANA *JEEZ*
---
oh man i hope it happens
---
Do you realize how many machines I would have to shoot, so I wouldn't be deal like on Yacht.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, who is this operator? I feel like I‚Äôve seen him somewhere before pick and ban came along.
---
Do you have the furry suit?
---
Actually no Ive been playing since outbreak and well its just changed.
---
Yeah I agree with that as well. I just got to thinking about it cause I've had games before where each team keeps winning on defense and losing on offense and it comes down to which team can finally win one round of defense to get the win.
---
Well it depends on the scenario and time of round at the end of a round in bomb echo is very strong and can win you rounds
---
Valk is also good cause you can hide cams and has a c4 
---
Same with mozzie
---
Honestly valk and mozzie are quite similar comes down to preference just valk is guaranteed 3 cams where as mozzie you don‚Äôt know and echo is in his own still good catagory

Yeah like I said I'll have to see how it plays out because the system is still new but I can see it causing a lot of frustration. Pick and ban is pretty cool tho

Thy basically nerfed his ability to pick up heat signatures because people were upset that Glaz was so ‚Äústrong‚Äù. 
---
And now from what I‚Äôve heard unless you wait like eight seconds his scopes completely garbage. I have no idea who at Ubisoft Decided to nerf glaz but I real hope they go back on that nerf and return him to his previous state which I felt wasn‚Äôt too good or too bad. It was in between unlike it is now where if you pick glaz it feels like you‚Äôre holding back your team.

Why don‚Äôt we have a Recruit Only mode where you can only play Recruits???

I always ban Cab because she is 1 more mechanic to worry about. I feel safer rushing a bit more if I can hear footsteps (which I always do - people honestly think sound doesn't exist it's actually funny). She just makes things a little more unsafe. Also no screaming 6 year olds can pick her and sprint around doing nothing.
---
Ahh it must be nice not having to equalize :0 and you can talk to other people. Everytime I go I just use standard gear so I always got to equalize early and often
---
Yes actually. The got rid of terrorist hunt achievements and added some to replace them.

Yep finally got master of siege after years of playing

I think it would be so much fun because ela's smg with an acog... so much potential chaos I need it

Think they added three for getting kills with specific weapons as well coz I have three achievements gained on the 12th of June
---
You can stack the 20% off with uplay points. What I did when the ultimate edition was a thing and got it for $30.
---
Yeah for multiple firing but in terms of bursts and single shots its the best because it has the quickest snap back to original position compared to all other barrel attachments and personally I burst fire a lot

A normal price to pay for round won.

&gt;Maybe untilities don't count, just gunfire?

Regardless, 2 rushers running in as 2 madmen fire 100 round LMGs is still heavyset cancer.

&gt;Grenades, utilities, c4 etc still cause friendly fire but random newbs (or idiots like me) who run in front of crossfire don't get headshot accidently (or purposefully?
---
Trust me, you'll get better and avoid that eventually.
---
&gt;I think it would make a stark contrast to what casual vs ranked actually is? Or have a choice of selecting ff on/off and being matched with that choice?
---
Uh.......that's an interesting one, actually. In casual only, set an FF on/off metre. I can't think of any problems with that system right now, but I do think that needs to be tested.

I don‚Äôt like it that much either but I feel like I‚Äôll get us to it because they aren‚Äôt changing it back

Probably they don't even know they changed it
---
I know that games tend to fill teams in order based on the load times. If Siege has some kind of preference for one team or the other, your loading times are always landing you in the team that Siege choose to put on defence.
---
Examples: Siege decides that the first five players will be the Defence. Your fast loading times makes you load as one of those players most of the times.

That doesn't sound bad at all.

That's a big no, Hereford is miles ahead of those maps.

Haha exactly, if they become more consistent it will help with that I think

Yo anyone else get a message about sunsplash packs when they first got on in Phantom Sight?

Epic
---
Please for the love of god take that skin of that pistol
---
Well some regions have a version of the game that only supports certain languages. Also, some regions have a region-lock where the game can only be activated if you are in that region.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs not perfect with top floor being slightly defender favored but it‚Äôs not bad by any means. Same with Fortress. The only maps I don‚Äôt want in ranked until they get reworked are Chalet and Skyscraper. Chalet pigeon holes you in so many ways no matter what side you are on. Lack of rotations. Only 1 maybe 2 viable sites. Same with Skyscraper but skyscraper has a big problem when it comes to runouts as well as the focus on the balconies. 
---
Hereford and Fortress aren‚Äôt the mazes most say it is and these maps are miles better then the two I just mentioned because they both have 3 very good sites to defend and have much more vertical play.
---
All these years of killing have drained his will to live. The only thing that keeps him going is the idea, that he's making a difference.
---
will be fixed in the next patch for sure, because you idiots keep reposting it ...
---
fair point, I was trying to say that I hate ranked heroes in general
---
It's a recent change. Came with the new season. To give him a bit of a buff.
---
one is a complete render with prb and one is in game
---
restart your game
---
My Ela strat is ruined thanks to you goddamn cheaters.
---
Thats true too but I think it be fair if was 2 round rotation so even if defense wins 2 rounds by picking the strongest 2 rooms cuz almost every map has 2 viable sites at least then if they rotate on attack see if they can perform like they did on defense.
---
yeah we should wait two weeks and then new maps should be introduced although tbh I'm already impressed with kafe so I'm thankful they didn't delay it. But for maps like Hereford, meme park, they should've ousted that or delay those maps since they're awful M
---
Did not know, thanks alot!
---
MORE. MORE. MORE.
---
Because that totally relates to his backstory
---
Unfortunately it's not that simple, they need someone to host their servers there
---
I asked for the changes and liked them. I play bomb only for more than 2 years now so I don't really mind that.
---
It needs a little higher magazine capacity imo.
---
This is why M&amp;K users on console are scared to play on PC. They need to cheat to win and can‚Äôt play on an even playing field because then they will get absolutely destroyed.
---
Congrats
---
It‚Äôs not an investment for your future it‚Äôs providing support for your favorite game and making it last longer. That‚Äôs why there are paid alpha packs, elite skins, and season passes. They are there to help further develop the game and increase its life span.
---
What are you talking about. The weapon has a pretty high fire rate which makes it pretty strong. You can kill enemies pretty fast. The only downside is the low mag capacity but if you have good aim, it won't be an issue.
---
I got the game in year 3 and I have over 250... i don‚Äôt know if I play too much or you too little
---
That‚Äôs so good that it might be *too* good and you might have to do some explaining to the police at some point lol
---
Yeah, Atleast wait a week or 2 before putting it into a ranked pool.
---
r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Yeah, that's fair.
---
I went 16 and 3 in a 3v3 custom game against 10 year olds and they kicked me from the party afterwards because I was ‚Äúcheating.‚Äù
---
It's only downfall is the mag size, imo it is comparable to twitchs and ashs gun even tho it has less ammo.
---
Turn it around pls ü•µ
---
I mean I think it be fair so both sides have a chance why I would want 2 round rotation impleneted. Also say u lose 1 round u get only 1 round to make it up with the 2nd chance instead of having 2 more chances.
---
I once heard that the matchmaking tends to "open up" a new lobby for premades because they often can't squeez them into already existing lobbies.
---
True.
---
I hope this is a coincidence but if it‚Äôs not then know that I will find you.
---
Staying copper, not on purppse but because I' terrible at the game.
---
Because they share sounds with many other guns
---
Simple as that
---
I understand ranked is trying mirror pro league why not go the full way with map pool &amp; new ops / map being in ranked.
---
Yeah, while the mode had its flaws, they can do anything they want with an entire game.  
---
Silly that people think Quarantine will just be a carbon copy. They're able to start completely from scratch with no size limits or multiplayer balance constraints.
---
These little things are just so frustrating. :D  It ruins the pace and speed of the game!!

gigabit ethernet connection doesn't impact gaming much. However not having hardware such as having siege on an SSD will impact load times.

Why do you hate us TH players u/Ubi-Ludo?

I'm sure there's a reason they dont put em in because it would be easy moneys!
---
Time Zones, not everyone lives in the same timezone so get out of here with that bullshit.
---
Assuming you are on PC? 
---
It would appear that a lot of people are experiencing this, it's very likely that the hamsters running the Siege servers aren't being fed.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not a bad way of thinking of it but the thing is I wish I had a chance of defending first then attacking rather than attacking then defending.
---
Any time is good for siege!!!!
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox One surprisingly
---
But what's in the cannister ?
---
You know, all these Rainbow Six Siege operators are special forces. So many years, they should be able to handle recoil. But NOOOoooOOOOoo, every time a machine pistol is used, it's as if the operator has never held a gun before
---
On his picture he looks 30
---
I think of him as sneaky Ash so suppressed M4 all day
---
It's possible, we've seen it happen in other games (like shields in Overwatch, Paladins and Dirty Bomb). But they might have to change some things in the engine and it probably isn't worth the time and money just for some purple tarps on one map. 
---
If they do it, they will probably make use if this mechanic in other maps and maybe even a new operator (like a defender that can deploy special barricades that block bullets and gadgets but not players, but still have the hole at the bottom part to allow drones to pass and prevent people from camping it). And unless they have plans for it, they will either give up, and make them easily accessible without tricks, or patch it in another way that doesn't require engine modification.
---
The drones shall be modded like the cars in NFS

You‚Äôre acting like go play apex is a roast or something.  I don‚Äôt even play apex and I find your comment cringe.
---
Not necessarily. Texture is at least just as important and the black sticks out on certain maps. We are also trained at spotting the black drones, having to look out for drones in all sorts of colours would be more difficult.
---
Not really a roast, just making the point playing siege is good anytime...

Hol up.
---
nope
---
Guys, they added the M27IAR from Ghosts!!!
---
House shouldn't be in ranked no matter what they do to it
---
Yeah they have too much problems with the game engine. Making new game might be a better option than continuing with this, because new updates may cause even more gamebreaking glitches
---
No, it would be better to just make Siege 2, you can only patch something up and not really fix it if the engine itself has to be modified beyond believe to not break everything
---
Give it time so that people can actually adapt to it.

What platform and did you five stack?
---
I play hibAna a lot. A LOT, since our squad needs a hardbreacher and I play hard breachers better than others.
---
She's fine. Even her kit is. Both the type 89 and b9 are perfectly fine. Needs no changes.
---
Really had to flex oj us nibbas who get place one elo away from plat huh
---
Running out is not "optimising", it preys on unaware or inexperienced players to get free, easy kills. You are more capable of defending without spawnpeaking or running out.
---
Because it‚Äôs a team game and the objective is to win, not get kills. People with the most kills have usually had a good game, but it is a *lot* easier when you have good callouts and drone/cam help. If instead of winning the objective was to top the kill leaderboard, why do I care what happens after I die in a round? Why would I bother to help out a teammate by laying back and droning him into a room? Why would I give a player who‚Äôs more inexperienced on my team tips about where to place his frost trap / evil eye / black window etc... Why would I play Thatcher whose gadget is non lethal when I could Sledge with grenades. 
---
If you want strangers to play as a collective team, you need to give them an incentive.
---
Congrats, you played yourself
---
honestly i have no fucking idea
---
Blue team always fills first and starts attacking first. If u live super close to a server you will almost always be one of the first 5 into a lobby

I heard there was a change but I need to test it. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

Shocking a wire is a waste unless it is in the vicinity of a shot claw that is on a wall.

C4 is currently the best secondary on defense. This is a HUGE buff.

I'd have liked her more if she'd have been a 2 speed, 2 armor she'd have more than a better pickrate she has now.

Just give it some time and then see if you have the same complaint
---
The new ops aren't particularly excited to play imo, and they don't bring anything new to the table. I wouldn't recommend, especially if there are other ops you can get
---
I see the first eight words of this every time I get on here on at least one thread.

N√∏kk makes it so that the only thing defenders can rely on to know you're there is their own eyes.

You can literally walk around freely and murder enemies if you know where they are.

DRUGS
---
And if someone would tell me how to post a video on here and have it play on Reddit instead of taking you to YouTube I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it
---
Sounds like ur being cocky saying that u have already won the game
---
Instead say gr (good round) or wp (well played) or gs (good shot)
---
Bc people are idiots who get trigger by everything.
---
I‚Äôm doing this challenge atm and I just sound whore and shoot up walls. Worked for me so far.
---
It‚Äôs dumb it I‚Äôm guessing since gg means game over you might be saying that you are going to win. Where as if you say gr (good round) usually people are fine.
---
Either way people get triggered so in the end it doesn‚Äôt really matter
---
I‚Äôm sure my opinion may change but still, there is already a hatch onto red stairs and a skylight? I feel like they just don‚Äôt want people defending top floor which is sad cus the new layout is kinda cool up there
---
Whenever a elite skin is released, ubi will make that operator's player model very ugly such as hibana
---
Lol no
---
It will take a while. After their open commitment of 100 operators, they need to at least get close or people will lose faith in them, and then there's no siege 2 purchases.
---
They'll keep this game alive for at least 3 more years, then slowly start pulling plug as they release a new one. It will turn out like Skyrim- 2011 to 2019 and we only have a teaser for that because Skyrim is so successful and has been well maintained that people still buy it.
---
You mean 4 years of drugs
---
ITs happens to me 12 times.  I‚Äôm bronze. Now. There is Ddos in silver like wtf I‚Äôm usually a gold
---
this is dope af
---
I think it‚Äôs the opposite. I think that is really in favor of the defenders if they can get a nasty angle on someone dropping down
---
We need an acknowledgement from ubi in this. Either the server crashes or it's ddos but it happens every 3 games or so for me this season, it's fucking unacceptable. Ranked is literally unplayable on ps4
---
Oh wow thats interesting

Not really, no.

Hey thanks for sharing this. I have same graphics card, had the same problem and doing what you did fixed the issue.
---
Didn‚Äôt even remember Alibi was Libyan. At least that makes sense kind of because it was a Italian colony.
---
Well good news for you now, we got it as a full game!
---
Vigil did it better
---
That's basically all OPs. Maestro grew up in Rome. We also got an Italian map Villa. Which is a great map.
---
Firstly, wow amazing job! Secondly, God dammit fuze

That‚Äôs bope bro

So thats why he's a 1 speed while wearing a suit and a kevlar vest: His shoes are full of concrete

Not gonna lie all 3 of these vigils look better than regular vigil

Basically, it all comes down to a map selector.

No clue why we still don't have it.

The frame rate is just as good on mobile as it is on pc

Reflex works best for me, its not too bulky and you aint really gonna go for long range shots with the gun anyways so the triangle isnt a problem
---
Why
---
yeah didn't work but thanks though
---
I have used it too! It makes for a great quick joke.
---
Screw the platform for customizations.
---
On apple you just download the app
---
You can't compare T.Hunt with Casual/Ranked.

In TH,Capitaos lmg can even destroy a hatch with 5-10 shots while in pvp it takes 2 mags

It works on apple too

---
Any reasonable person wouldn't assume what they don't know, they accept the fact they don't know and they have 0 reason to believe so, especially when fixes do come and some problems are acknowledged.
---
"Nothing gets aknowledged or fixed" yep, nice, start from a false premise good job. Sure you deal with basic things, because you're stupid, but sadly not everything is a basic thing and in that list of NOT-Basic things there is "fixing a game". It's not a basic thing, it's timely, costly and sometimes elusory with problems hard to even pin point, you don't understand it because you're an idiot so you just bash Ubisoft and call me a fanboy, while at the same time thinking someone is good at dealing with bugs because he has a popular youtube channel. Do you not see how unspeakably ignorant you are? And yet you insist them not coming out with a statement every 5 seconds means they don't ackowledge them. Besides, I forgot to mention there is also in the usual blog updates, aside from Fixed bugs, there's a "known issues" section as well as people from Ubi quite frequently jumping into discussion on reddit and twitter about stuff. So they actually engage pretty actively with the community about it.
---
Sure you're done, you didn't even start, you were just making up stuff to justify why you're pissed. I'm pissed I can't play regular siege and I hope it gets fixed, but I'm not a complete moron who thinks a youtuber showing how to jump onto a box is the solution to all our problems.
---
Damn that‚Äôs awesome
---
You aren‚Äôt always gonna get Villa. But you will always be able to play an operator though. 
---
There is also a difference than playing on a map and having a connection to a character that you are playing and have control of.
---
Like what if they made one of the Moroccan operators from France? Everyone would be scratching their head.
---
Agreed
---
The drugs
---
Hmmm I thought Syrian special forces only used torture chambers as their special weapon
---
Stop assuming sh\*t please. Never said Im better than everyone else.. stop projecting your own insecurity and using it as a bad counterargument. Shields are easy to counterattack, if you still dont know why then thats on you.
---
That‚Äôs the point of the joke mate. I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve been r/woooosh ed.
---
After they took his ACOG he squints more to attempt to see farther, or it's all the drugsss
---
I would actually buy R6 credits orbit meant I could make my drone a pink cat
---
Being hypocritical much? üòÇ
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with learning how to control a gun's recoil and how to use it effectively.
---
Am I the only one who thought he looked pretty young before his elite was released? I didn't know what to expect, but it surely wasn't that.
---
Glitches are not fair as they're not intended by the developers of the game. If the Devs didn't want to allow spawn peeking or running out the would make defenders unable to destroy the outer barricades of the building. They discourage it by making it risky with the automatic detection, but they do not outright remove players ability to do it as they do with glitches. And yes it preys on unaware players, but they will quickly learn to be aware of their environment. A pair of people ran out on me on Oregon earlier with a runout I wasn't aware of. Now I know to always check said runout if I'm on Construction Site. You don't have to runout if you don't want to, but you do need to learn to play around it rather than complaining about it because it is an intended facet of the game and other people will not restrict themselves to your self-applied rules no matter what you say.
---
Okay, you‚Äôre solo queueing.. Monty walks in full shield, and has to other players behind him.  How do you counter that?
---
They're all fourteen.

Epic animation! I'm not sure about the floating random gadgets and weapons though. I feel like it would make more sense to have things in the scene that would really be there for a reason. Like Cavs pistol sure but maybe as you pull further out you see her outstretched hand and arm like the pistol just flew out of her grasp as she got killed or something like that. Stuff floating because reasons just feels odd.
---
Okay first off what does soloq have to do with reducing shields melee? Also you dont go for monty you shoot the players behind montagne first obviously Lol. anyways reducing shields melee to 50% is a stupid idea if you really think about it. Will be totally unbalanced in 1v1 situations or even in clutch situations. Really easy to understand why. I wont be replying more cause it seems you have a problem with understanding. Thanks for making me laugh &lt;3
---
Don‚Äôt put your barricades over doors that are used for rotations? Castle is one of the most useless ops anyways.. just play pulse lmao
---
I have no clue either
---
On mobile you should see three dots in the top right corner. Tap that and you should see ‚ÄúChange Flair‚Äù Open that and there is the mains. If you wanna use a custom one like mine, you have to press the edit button. Flairs work on other subreddits too, if they have them of course
---
Damn that sucks. Sorry I can‚Äôt help...
---
I could see a coastline rework in the next year or two where they either take away the tarps or close off that window
---
Aggressive Aging
---
Your friend is reeeeeing so hard
---
I wonder if one day they will allow C4 to stick on shield, so this could make a devastating human bomb
---
People argued it wasn't balanced that way
---
And also, that bike will still never be quite as good as it used to be.
---
I gotcha. I wasn‚Äôt sure because I hadn‚Äôt seen anything about it. Thanks man.
---
It doesn't fit with the lore if fuze isn't on hostage
---
I think it's an issue with the reworked map. I have that problem too
---

---
Big mighty ooff
---
bro i swear i get nothing from alpha packs except capitao headgears
---
How much do did you usually get this season?
---
I‚Äôm simply playing devils advocate and trying to draw a situation. In this this situation playing like you just said your dead.. you go to shoot the others who aren‚Äôt playing aggressive, they know your looking at them. And when you do Monty will lower his shield and shoot you, and if you try to turn and face Monty while he is doing that his team mates are already pushing, you‚Äôre dead.
---
You said it‚Äôs easy but you can‚Äôt solve that situation. 
---
Again, I don‚Äôt them that much. And giving them a 50% melee doesn‚Äôt take away the pushing power of a shield, just just reduces the chances of a Monty or blitz clutching a 1v3 or on. Which makes sense. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry you want to laugh at the fact that YOU don‚Äôt understand. You say not to project on you, but you‚Äôre being so close minded it‚Äôs ridiculous. ‚ÄúI think Monty is an easy counter, anyone that doesn‚Äôt understand that sucks.. Monty needs a buff.‚Äù 
---
That‚Äôs what you sound like. Don‚Äôt be a douche. Just explain your thoughts.
---
You are a bold one

PS: You are strong and wise, and I am very proud of you.

You saw 2 drones and clipped it?

You don't like his ballistic face mask? I dig it. Maybe not the most practical, but I'd be afraid if I saw a kitted out soldier in all black with a ballistic face mask trying to come for my tiny ass.
---
It still shows the damage indicator, just not the near miss indicator
---
Thanks will try this next time, this happens quite often to me.
---
Bring that out in public and you‚Äôll get fucking arrested so quickly.

Ok
---
Just to refute yours, in my idea, I assume that I I had also implemented the system where you can‚Äôt play with someone that is to far away from your rank. Because of this, it would only take a few games of a five stack doing this to make that one deranker not able to play in the 5 stack.
---
Fus ro dah
---
nah, u gotta click to use the ability, i actually have no clue why i wasn‚Äôt affected by the flash in the slightest
---
You'd be just as scared as if you saw a kitted out soldier in that mask in the middle. Honestly i'd be more scared, because it'd be less likely its some kid LARPing in airsoft gear.

Just like the tarp on top of Fortress has no collision even tho drones can ride there (it would be pretty useless to get on top of it anyways but i was searching for fun spots)
---
Keep working hard. It‚Äôs my experience that you ranked gets better the higher it gets, with the exception of M and K on console. However, expectations are higher, so it‚Äôs important to limit potato aim and dumb plays. Unfortunately so many people, especially early in the season are deranking smurf accounts so they can player less skilled competition.
---
Looks more like a knife with a knuckle duster but even than I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs requisition
---
blitz is so broken no wonder I always die to that fuck whereas I always get ganked when I try to 1v1 him
---
I thought it was boof at first glance xD
---
Honestly, I got the waffle cone skin and applied that to my mains
---
Unfortunately yes
---
It's some type of deployable shield
---
....yeah I did.
---
Just curious, did you use the cinecom tutorial for this? It looks awesome but the way!
---
No because black ice was a skin exclusive to weapons in the game during operation black ice therefore it wouldn't make sense to add it to all weapons
---
Someone help me find a link to download this

4years of getting injured by exothermic charges

He got a promotion
---
Sounds good to me. I'm tired of having to struggle to get to round 9 in a 4v5 just to lose anyway after someone left before the 1st round because their favorite op got banned or they didn't like the map.
---
&gt; you use the cinecom tutorial 
---
In Soviet Russia, the cinecom tutorial use **you**!
---
Then they just get someone else, and the deranker runs off and ruins randoms lives by throwing matches by himself.

Different Vigils from different countries

Eh, I'd more prefer we toss finka, she's not a healer, she's a health boost. She pushes people past 100 health. If she was capped at 100, I'd be fine with her (and if they removed literally every other aspect of her ability... Which is honestly just an esp to make you immune to things not gunfire, and a recoil macro)
---
Those first two masks look so cool. Why didn't we get those?
---
This pun is gold...

CHANKA 1ST

Im working on upping my sensitivity now, so i can turn and follow without the potato. Every game has smurfs - these games im not even mad for losing.

Yeah, but that‚Äôs a different strategy with a different op. Sure, same situation, but he wasn‚Äôt mute/smoke so he/she used wardens ability.
---
Gold 4 is not really good.. that's the literal starting elo. It's 95% of the playerbase this early in the season
---
They're probably boosting
---
 And he's probably confusing diamond and plat because of the recolor
---
I see people ban those 4 constantly.  
---
   
---
Then defenders get banned, Lesion Echo Maestro, and for some reason Cav.
---
Yeah! My friend and I were busting our butts laughing!
---
This game gets more and more metal every season and I love it.

There's nothing really clever about it. The can't play anything else. They'd rather look at a menu than risk their K/D which means their K/D isn't real. They're a poor man's DDOSer.

Hi there! I see your flair and I'm intrigued. What's a good way to play Vigil? How do you like him? I can't figure out how to best use his ability. Thanks! He's one of the only ops I havent figured out yet.

Nah the leaks have been saying the next attacking op has he grappling hook, why else would it be right beside the defender gadget

Make it so they can't join a new match until the match is completely over they've done it on world of war ships, but make it easier for people to rejoin incase of genuine reasons
---
Who wouldve known since they from the same unit and requisition the same gear! Tho is really weird that dokka is 2 armor and vigil with almost identical armor 1 armor (bloody hell what do the koreans make their tablets from?? Sum bulletproof stuff?)
---
They were all planned out in the OG  leaks. They were supposed to have 5 new guns ready
---
Top strat.
---
It‚Äôs similar to how glaz now works
---
Aw shit
---
Amen
---
Because at best your team will have to play a 4v5 round because you wanted a cheap kill. Yes it's allowed, it's still a shitty thing to do to everyone else in the game.
---
Wow. I thought he would be like 16-17 with your description.
---
Oh yea that too
---
I didn‚Äôt know they made a change it just felt wrong to me.
---
I like too, but most of the time people just yell at me that he's bad and then I can't play as well. That, and now shield operators are the at the front end of being banned every ranked game
---
Not OP, but in my opinion Vigil‚Äôs gadget is the weakest part of the operator.  If you play Vigil as a roamer, his great weapons will do more than his almost always useless gadget.  Since his gadget is almost entirely luck or situational, I‚Äôd say play him if you have mastered the gunplay in rainbow.

Well buck never shot, ash was a using a pistol, and fuze lit me up pretty good but yeah they were pretty bad

I love my XXL Mousepad

Expect that vigil is north Korean and Nokk comes from what country the Jaeger Corps come from (which is an actual unit to those who don't know).

i feel u, i always used to much or just wrong

Why would you put no hard breaches in S tier but you do put thatcher?

Just happened to me too.

One of them looks like a single image that took some rendered time, the second looks like the real time render of the game engine whilst in game or in the winning menu. Are they even the same type of image? It‚Äôs not fair comparing those two if this is the case...

I think it's Pulse and Echo
---
I wonder if the shield is a trap, like if the attacker jumps over it it bursts in flames
---
Cool nobody cares
---
I don‚Äôt even care about his ability, having a 590 and a smg-12 is amazing. People can talk shit all they want but his fragging power is ruthless

You shot the brains cells put of blitz's brain

Bald guy rook (I think) ,bottum right bandit (I think)

Lol, don't play ranked of you're connection Is shit

Yup, suppressed Maverick player here as well

Some maps don't have bombers (for example: hereford doesn't have any if you're playing solo on normal) about the "3 enemies remaining" thing, I have it all the time when I play def on house that this dialoge pops up even tho there are like 6 or so enemies left

Yes well if you are level 70 and you are playing with level 100-150 then by the time you are level 120ish you will be playing with level 160-200, most of those people aren‚Äôt toxic.

Now they are taking into account past mmr rankings. Were you higher than them last season?

Sorry to break it to you, that isn't a drop shot

---
It was rather hard to find good screenshots/images, so I used the best stuff I'd found.
---
They are the easiest to use and have the best guns. People get mad because they work well and are simple to learn
---
on attack if they do it they win, on defense if they do it they lose(unless doing it after they plant)
---
This season they updated how the placements work. Instead of it just giving you a certain elo based solely on those 10 games, it's the median between them and your rank from last season. So if you ended last season with more elo than your buddies you would be placed in a higher rank despite having the exact same placements.
---
New skin maybe?
---
Good luck worrying about student debts then
---
And his son plays lacrosse
---
...
---
if the EMP goes off while bandit is still deploying, the battery is not destroyed

How can people main shield ops?

Are they actually effective?

Yeah.  It wouldn't have hurt to actually credit or ASK before directly copying the cap.

2 thermite charges? NO

---
Copper 1
---
No drones
---
You forgot to reinforce the left edge of the corner gold bits.
---
Are you aggressive or passive?
---
Both are very good operators but I would have to say it comes to personal preference 
---
But seeing as Kaid just got a nitro, his shotgun primary is amazing and his ability is bandits but better I would say to get kaid
---
I haven't played Nokk yet but as someone who plays Kaid a decent amount, he's underwhelming. I like Bandit's gadget as well as Doc's thiccness so I thought he might be a decent pick but he's just boring to play and his guns aren't good. The shotgun/dmr is interesting and I've started using it much more, but his Aug leaves a lot to be desired.
---
statistics are only accurate with a large data set, just because 50% of the 10 games you played were skyscraper doesnt mean 50% of all games played are skyscraper. you were just lucky/unlucky.
---
Nice copy lol
---
Copper 2
---
Copper 3
---
I would call that a very big UNLUCKY, but yeah I know that that is the case
---
This needs more attention
---
Casual shouldn't be an "orgy of toxicity and TKing", people at all skill levels will abuse runouts. Learning runouts like hatches and cams adds another layer on to the already massive amount of things a new player has to learn. It just isn't fair that a new player who thinks they're safe outside will get instantly killed with little to no warning.
---
I had an idea for an attacker, he/she would have senser that they plant, the senser will alert you if they are people passing, but not who is passing nor how many are in the area.
---
They make or break entire offensives on bomb in my biased opinion. They make initiating and planting on most rooms easier and some a complete breeze. If you use communication and build around using the shield operator to secure a plant then you‚Äôre golden.
---
Yes a lot of maps got a brightness upgrade, fortress and skyscraper in particular
---
Reverse friendly fire wanted u to win
---
My bad.
---
Wanted to type mozzie.
---
Maps can only be set as a preference in t-hunt. Casual picks from a pool of 20 maps so getting house isnt very common. I get it occasionally, just keep playing

You know I was bored and looking through my profile, and I have just discovered CSG9... I see.

Can confirm the Shemagh and Chem outfit is a great combo.

Kinda wish I bought the burnt horizon uniform for him because I bet that would've looked great
---
Sick

Hmmmmmm
---
I was talking about your caption

Same here. Same config was running 135-144FPS, but now it struggles to stay within the 90FPS range. Noticable input lag as well for some reason. I've tried everything from reinstalling Windows, tweaking configs as much as I can, etc., but it never goes above 100, regardless of settings.
---
Well, considering I‚Äôve never played on pc, yeah probably not lol.
---
Its now 4 days and -8.

He may have the lowest pick and win rate amongst every other operator but he does need a slight nerf. The best nerf jackal could get is to lower the time he can scan someone‚Äôs foot prints. Right now it is set to 90 seconds. If you are a roamer and you leave the obj after beating a team player and setting up utility and reinforcing walls, jackal has half of the time in the game to scan your foot prints. That is what needs to change with jackal. 30-45 seconds would be a good time for the foot prints to disappear.
---
Idk, I got a ‚Äúrare‚Äù achievement of winning a casual/ranked secure area as soon as I launched the game last night, seems like they‚Äôre buggy right now
---
Entire team is dead.

Caveira: ***Confused Screaming***
---
Cool thanks for coming back and letting me know
---
you just showed a account that is diamond, but no name, yeah like when i send you the account from pengu with no name thats also "bloody evidence" shit kid
---
I f**king love that
---
I'm not sure I understand this. Do you mean increase the time to scan a footprint, or decrease the time that a footprint is available to scan?
---
Man, awesome job!
---
This is in prep phase, its just regular old hacks
---
I play Jackal but I'd be happy if he was deleted from the game. He's not OP, but his gadget is bullshit. Same with Dokk and Lion. These operators go completely against the spirit of the game imo and make it unfun to play.
---
That‚Äôs just really depressing honestly
---
Furry down
---
Look at the first comment in the thread. Don't bother asking for ideas if you're too stupid to take them on board.
---
Looks like shit
---
The same way one plays caveira, be sneaky try avoid direct fights as ur guns are weaker. shouldnt need better guns if you get the jump on the enemy. maybe walk directly past cameras instead of shooting them out for a stealthy entry if nobody is currently on the camera.
---
That‚Äôs epic

Man I always wanted a twitch Mozzie fight but it never came around

That was an awesome clutch but, I have a couple of questions. How high was the enemy team so they took out the rest of your team with no casualties only to lose by you?
---
Plats talking shit, what a surprise! /s

No u

You say my people?

Fair, I play with plats in a 4-5 stack so it‚Äôs definitely different. The higher up you go the more you‚Äôll see why it‚Äôs a good thing

I regret making it.

Amazing that we have to figure out how to "fix" glitches on game on our own

Very clever on the world play, love this community

We need to a post trending or something. Make the report toxic behaviour button actually do something.

True snipers shoot out of helicopters not trees

Same with frost the whole point of her mats is to deny entry and force attackers to use utility to do so. Now people can just rush in and shoot down like it's nothing.

Ok this must be a joke then (I know s+ is)

The article by PcGamer is called ‚ÄúRainbow Six Siege Season 3 Gadgets Leaked...‚Äù how is that not a leak?

-16

Good luck, you'll never get out of the basement. I've been solo queue, I'm usually gold 1 or plat 3, I can hardly get back into gold. I go 11-4-5, 10-5-3, etc. and steady losing. The only win I've had today I went 18 and 2. My teammates combined had 4 kills the whole game. 
---
If I rank into gold 2-3 I'll be already but I find anything below and my teammates are just total lemmings. Best of luck trying to dig yourself out of bronze, I can't even imagine what that must be like.
---
AMAZING
---
*my spidey senses are starting to tingle*
---
But through a smoke and holding an angle you‚Äôre at a major advantage. There‚Äôs hardly any counter to a glaz holding an angle through a smoke. Sure say you got warden now, but trust me he isn‚Äôt (or shouldn‚Äôt if anyone is competent) going to win that gun fight
---
Playing mozzie is one of the most funniest and best for trolling the other team, especially if you nab a twitch and taze a downed enemy
---
I got the game in white noise and I have 1700 hours in it
---
Why?
---
Finka if u team player
---
Ubi has been working hard to prevent people from getting there. It's funny how they always manage to do it anyways. At this point I think it would be better to remove that freaking tarp once and for all lol
---
I love everything else about the main menu, but yea I‚Äôm with you on that. It‚Äôs a really obnoxious thing to have blind you when in a dark room
---
Same
---
Sure he does. I mostly play in gold, but one season I played with a lot of friends brand new to siege and we ended up in low copper. I climbed my way back up to Gold II that season and saw a pretty good representation of each rank.
---
Coppers: Still have potential for plays like this. Biggest problem is lack of map awareness, anticipation of certain strats, and generally rushing/not taking advantage of situations. With the biggest issue being attitude. Lots of ragers, trolls, leavers, etc. Teams getting discouraged after one losing round, etc. In this case, the OP made a risky move putting his back to the recruit after that initial engagement. Recruit did not take advantage of this and was too passive. The third kill was good, but generally not a lot of pre-firing seen by the enemy team, which is common in higher ranks and why OP was able to defend relatively passively. Everyone on the enemy team approached the objective independently and didn't coordinate. All it took was a push from both sides with some drone reconnaissance and OP was toast. 
---
Bronze: Less toxic, but still majority of games plagued with some sort of leavers or trolls. Present in copper, but I noticed more in bronze, a propensity for smurfs and for 1-2 players in a lobby to be dominatingly better than the rest. The average player occasionally has good plays, but suffers from reliability. Starting to pick up strats, but generally still everyone plays individually.
---
In copper and bronze, anyone who groups with 1-2 people, at least, and uses a modicum of communication ought to be able to carry themselves out.
---
 
---
Silver: The most frustrating rank IMO. Lot of over-inflated opinions. More emphasis on communication, but still a propensity for a break down of teamwork when met with any resistance. A small number exploit some really clever map tricks and do well here if they know some more obscure peek holes/rotations, etc. There seems to be a dichotomy between players who are great mechanically but not so great cognitively, and players who are really smart and anticipate but aren't reliable mechanically (miss a lot of shots, don't win straight up engagements, etc). It's rare for a player to have both in this rank. Once you reach a point where you have both, you won't stay in silver for long.
---
Gold: A strange distribution because of it being the most common rank. The difference between a great gold and a bad gold is huge. Can't speak much to it since it's my current rank and never been higher than Gold I, but generally speaking players have both good game sense and mechanical ability. What separates players is having top tier mechanical ability (anticipating enemies to the point of pre-firing headshots), but generally the more organized team will always win (i.e., teams that talk to one another). Mistakes get punished almost always in gold, whereas every rank below can suffer quite a few mistakes and still succeed. 
---
Either way, good job OP! An Ace is always a fun feeling, regardless of rank.
---
When I was on PS4 I used the Gamerlink app. Not as many users for pc but yea I found a lot of good groups on there. Most of em were good at least lol
---
Well they did a great job with kafe then
---
Yeah and it‚Äôs annoying
---
Yeah, I think so. I don't use him at range anymore. Just doesn't make sense to. And I definitely don't use smokes. There are one or two maps I still don't mind using him on, but I use him and just pretend the highlight doesn't exist.
---
especially disappointing
---
No, Doc is fine where he is.
---
yeah thats why i get 6mmr if i bet silvers even if i do 15/3.. its who you're facing
---
I've been playing him with the shotgun almost every site regardless. It has a better close-range kill potential for the corner-creeping his slow speed and up-close gadget demands, especially when encountering Blitz or rushing enemies.
---
^
---
or they could nerd the K1A and buff the SMG12
---
i saw a jager one, both r great üòÄ
---
Rank checks out
---
Classic Ubisoft right here folks
---
Flash already isn't a guaranteed effect, you are risking a lot when you rush into a flash'ed room with no intel, Warden or no
---
ubi has been slapping me in the face with commons until last night theyre just like "sure lets give the man a legendary on 2% chance"
---
He was joking mate
---
Would be cooler though if he hadn't blatantly stolen someone else's work. At least credit the man if you're going to blatantly copy him.

Is that looked down upon?
---
I often see them setup like this
---
You're not gonna get any charms for staying on an offline Twitch channel. Dunno about your second question, but I would assume you do.
---
Thanks
---
Right now, overtime match point is the deciding factor between evenly matched teams winning or losing at 4-4. Instead of that deciding factor being only one round, I wish it would be winning 2 rounds rather than one. This is used in pro league already. Hope this clear that up.
---
When he reveals your location for 25 seconds, has arguably the best weapons of the game, and the there is absolutely fuck all you can do about it, besides Maverick, Jackal has no hard counter. The fact that that he literally presses a button and your screwed for 25 seconds is a bit much, he doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
Doc is a balanced operator. I mean ya you can say he‚Äôs the only op in the game that can heal except finka which isn‚Äôt a heal but more a short health buff but that is what he is meant to do and he does it well. Stop hating on a balanced op just because you die from him or can‚Äôt finish your kills
---
Chef Skinner has really changed career path since Gusteau‚Äôs got closed down huh?
---
Me and a friend played ranked and it was great for our 10 placements matches, but then every game after we got put into a 2v5. It was obnoxious. We didn‚Äôt even play poorly.
---
Feels for recruit and am I just blind but is glad not in this pic?
---
Slight correction, this is a workaround.
---
It would be nice if ubi could fix this bug that has been in the game for at least 2 years.
---
+1 respect
---
Thats epic. Good play on words
---
If it takes longer than 5 minutes, then I don't bother staying. I don't vote people out though.
---
As mentioned in your other comment, most times it is just a couple of minutes, however, I have been stuck in some that going on for longer than 5 minutes. I always tell myself the round will start in a moment, but it never does.
---
But the point you're trying to make could be used for everything too. The person that was TKed could win it for you. The person who is yelling through the Mic could win it for you. The twitch on your team who does nothing but zap their teammates with her drone could win it for you. The person people vote kicked for not having a Mic could win it for you. 
---
Hopefully people stop with that shit, but at the same time I know they won't.
---
Good job
---
I would‚Äôve just walked away from my computer if that happened to me
---
Try out muzzle brake, it helps with the 1st shot recoil, which looks like what fucked you up.
---
when you destroy drones and stuff (which is what i did in the clip) the hitmarker is white. still super confused.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Moving the mouse counts against the timer, which is absolutely stupid
---
ela is not controlable on pc either.
---
How
---
That was him saying:
---
"Are you *SURE* you want to do that...?"
---
OP stole the idea from someone else, so not his permission to give lol.
---
Doc is perfectly fine, he got nerfed slightly a while ago.
---
Have you tried shooting them
---
its not low... but i get your point
---
Is this a joke?
---
Then I have literally no idea xd
---
Hmmmm I‚Äôve been using it on smoke for a while and it‚Äôs not the worst.
---
What if they made it so if your ranks vary by more than 3-4 then mmr is disabled for your team. Like if a plat 3 is with a gold 3 or 4 then they can't earn or lose mmr but maybe the enemy team can win like half mmr if they win.
---
How do intel ops ruin the game? They all have such easy counters dokk=turn your phone off lion=don‚Äôt move jackal=keep moving
---
Ikr it has like none
---
Excuse me what the fuck?
---
Yo thanks for linking my post.
---
Oh okay, how rare is it to get black ice tho?  :)
---
It's not a gaurenteed effect because if someone isn't flashed it's because they were looking away from the angle. That's what flashed off an angle means. It allows you to take that angle. It isn't just a thing in Rainbow six seige. Look at competitive cs or any other game it's a core mechanic. Being able to counter that entirely is op because it counters a huge portion of operators.
---
Pretty sure super rare. Lol I'm lvl 100 and gotten two
---
Wow
---
Low recoil low damage
---
excuse you bitch it's my first time using it and it had recoil
---
Lion must be happy for barely getting banned
---
When you hear a barricade open behind you and you turn around
---
Well see I have but I just never seem to be in that beautiful 0.5 meter range required to kill them with it
---
Honestly , love getting dupes .
---
Renown boost to help me get OPs or seasonal skins .
---
Drones are always white, but destroying gadgets like air jabs (which you did if you look at the points you earned for the c4), fuse charges, breaches, those will get you red hit markers, it‚Äôs been like that for quite a long time
---
Plus the ten seconds for each of the 4 ban phases. I'm not opposed, I'm just saying the more they would add to the beginning of the actual game, the less people want to fool with it. If my match wait time is a minute, post round is a minute, pre-match voting is a minute, and so on... I'm going to eventually be spending more time not playing the game than actually playing.
---
When I used it I could tell it kicked
---
No he got mindfucked and clipped it
---
I dont play him as an anchor. I like him much better as a roamer.
---
‚ÄúGotta pee BRB‚Äù
---
You said he‚Äôs one of the worst attackers
---
then I think they'd just play casual tbh..
