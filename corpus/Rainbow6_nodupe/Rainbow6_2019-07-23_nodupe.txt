Why?
---
---
---
For both, i'm lucky
---
Rip. I hit plat 3 with my friend and we stopped playing for a couple days and the next week DDOSing started happening so we just forgot about even trying to hit plat 2.
---
I was with you until one point. Ela's SMG is currently in one of the worst spots of all guns in the game even after her recent spread buff. She's one of my favorite too but that SMG is rough to use.

---
Because it‚Äôs the best cheats they got, if they could use wall hacks and auto aim they probably would. What‚Äôs worse is they think they‚Äôre good at the game.
---
Right to your left
---
Vigil
---
But the new gadget would have to be amazing compared to Jager for it to be picked
---
Yeah, it's probably an accommodation for console players.
---
Remember the island in the kitchen
---
Because this is a paid game with a sub F2P game bussiness model.  Seriously I've seen F2p games that give out more loot boxes, better events etc.  Even Overwatch, who always gets shat on for loot boxes gives them out left and right. 5 free a week for playing arcade mode, 1 every level, and during events, and loot boxes you get during events are event boxes.plus you get 3 items vs 1.
---
Common skins &gt; Legendary skins
---
Yeah but he doesn‚Äôt do that in my rank yet he gets banned every single game. I don‚Äôt care why OPs get banned. If the same ones are always banned the system is garbage.
---
Maybe Ela or alibi
---
To be honest I think attackers need a permanent heal gadget similar to doc because finka is a stimulus instead of a heal
---
Thanks. I was thinking of what an offensive doc would be like after losing a few games
---
I did that but nothing happened
---
That would be dope
---
I had this happen a little while ago. The match finally started again after about 30-40min. So frustrating that people do this shit. The dude on the other team messaged me and said ‚ÄúYou should leave.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù
---
Sledge in the back like, "blitz, that's my job."
---
Yeah
---
But you also have to think about all of the different combinations of uniform, headgear and weapon skins and attachments. It's the same reason that the operator cards don't show your headgear and uniform at the beginning of the round and only show the preset one. That's why only having a few ops available for showdown made it easier, because they only had to change a few of them, not all 40+. Will they add a way to customize Alibi's decoy in the future, maybe, but it might only change when she gets an elite skin, but that will be awhile.
---
His torch just got a huge audio nerf today on PC. Now he's only really useful for mav tricking into sites.
---
I mean I have the money, I just can‚Äôt spend that much on something I won‚Äôt use that much
---
I like the vanilla pic better
---
The lmg needs less ammo in the mag/ longer reload time
---
I had this happen to me once and because of it I refuse to move for a moment when i spawn there lmao
---
Jager reprogrammed his ads to shoot enemies
---
While I agree that the 416 is too good I would argue that the Alda 5.56 is better due to having solid fire rate, decent recoil, good damage and access to an a of but all that is balanced out by maestro being 1 speed
---
That would be cool but wouldn't that make defense a little more difficult?
---
Jager doesn‚Äôt need a nerf
---
Mistake cuz he was nervous probably
---
Recipe control 100
---
For me, the spread makes it worthless at range, but I don't have to aim for the head, it'll get there eventually on it's own.
---
I feel bad for you, you probably got reported
---
No one spawns there anymore.
---
"Recoil"?
---
The Lord is the best operator so that why he never gets used because no one can withstand the POWER of the play
---
Especially bomb 
---
Nonono specifically bomb
---
Nononono exclusively bomb
---
Nononono ok im done
---
Alright buddy my autocorrect is a dick head
---
i agree somewhat but the nerf might be inevitable, and i want it to be the least painful
---
Sorry been forever since I played r6 did not realize
---
and with acog yes he is pretty well balanced.
---
He was on Xbox it looks like he could have easily been using his phone to record the "record last five minutes" feature on Xbox and laughed when he rewatched it
---
Vigil and alilbi are generally the 2 alternate roamers to cav
---
It's good shit, casual is great, ranked gets me pissed, currently I don't have a serious team so I just play with mates and that doesn't go amazingly.
---
Literally every game that has a dedicated competetive mode is made my monkeys then. There isn't a game that exists that cant be DDOS'ed
---
I guess I can give an update on it, I tried uploading the watchface to the Galaxy Store, however it was using copyrighted content apparently (even though all the properties were royalty free clip art). I'm not working on it anymore, as I'm really busy with the transition to college, but I can dm you the project file so you can sdboverbt the watchface over to your watch. Do with it as you would like. If you need any help getting it onto your watch, contact me.
---
so if a squad of 5 are in a party chat they can‚Äôt play ranked? For a lot of people being in a party chat is necessary because the chat volume gets drowned out by game volume or vice versa. The default sound mixer on the xbox can only do so much and in most cases doesn‚Äôt help that much.
---
‚ÄúBullet physics‚Äù
---
I meant acog when I said ‚Äúa of‚Äù I think autocorrect happened though
---
Replay the video at half speed, starting at the 15th second, while watching the bullet trail of thermite's gun, then tell me if it would've been better to lean left rather than right.  
---
Spoiler alert: I would've gotten a bullet shoved up my nose.
---
No problem, i already have a perfect control of my pizza
---
Oh. Didn‚Äôt occur to me that some people don‚Äôt understand that you can import those recordings into your phone lol üòÇ
---
While I agree he doesn't need a a big nerf.... He does need somthing to make him not a must have all the time...
---
He's not OP as a op, but his gadget in invaluable.  Maybe bring it down to 2 ADS, but have them each destroy 2 more objects... So wgile he's still be great defence, he won't be able to lock down an entire area.
---
Honestly, I think LoL is a bit worse but team killing definitely does not help Siege's case.
---
it would be a struggle i agree
---
Thats why I dont like pick and ban
---
I got the game last week and I have a 5.7 Black Ice. The odds are... Interesting.
---
Is it wrong to be aroused by this?
---
Yea chalet and skyscraper are awful
---
"Hey man why aren't you back in the lobby we're all waiting on you"  
---
"Just one minute dude I gotta do a plank"
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Well from my calculations, it appears that ashe does not have a head. Ashe hitbox OP.
---
This town ain‚Äôt fit for the 3 of us. 
---
*0 headshots*
---
Is it really a stroke though?
---
He's as good as the person playing him
---
Ash
---
This should be a special event
---
Nice strat
---
nah u right
---
LMAOOO, this is a joke, the fuck are you losers gonna do to console players. You community managers are gay, black, and retarded
---
Clash is already from SCO19 though; it's in her bio. But yeah I'm also on board with more Ops from the UK, like the SBS.
---
i'm almost through battle tendency, about to get to stardust crusaders
---
Happened in my plat II match but the server counted it as a win for my team for whatever reason
---
What are you saying lmao, Smoke isn't out yet.
---
It was only leaked and that russian hacker guy somehow managed to use it earlier.
---
r/imreallysorryjon
---
I‚Äôve tried these things. Quiet frankly it‚Äôs not how I enjoy spending time with my friends. Either way, this game shouldn‚Äôt just cater to those who have five stacks. It should be viable both ways. And it‚Äôs not.
---
meatiest of bois
---
It's 2GB long, 1GB tall and 1GB around.
---
Ok
---
You literally just get a feel for that shit. Good teams can do full roam clears with drones. Good players know to check certain places. Good players know when to peek and when not too. Ngl, again, I think you're calling cheats wrong.
---
?
---
Wow that is very smart
---
I only like Sledge one, the others doesn't appeal to me much tbh
---
Join your teammates parties or talk in game chat about who to ban and why it should take 5 seconds to decide
---
Go to flair selection, then edit, select the one you want, go press the little keyboard and there will be all the operator icons you can pick up to 5
---
Possibly through the use of a VPN but there might be other ways as well.
---
I'd be more on board if you got the Headgear as well, having a Uniform or a Legendary Headgear without the other part is weird
---
It's called "I'm a vampire, bitch". Also it's worth noting she's shooting at Nazis, you should totally give it a watch.
---
Thanks!
---
Oh I am new here so I did nit know thanks for telling me
---
dad has to be fuze. always ‚Äúkilling‚Äù the vibe
---
It's console
---
No buck is a "utility" operator. You want to try and keep him alive until you can get either above or below the objective room so you can use his shotgun to open up the floor/roof so you can shoot the defenders vertically. 
---
On Attackers you have 
---
* Fraggers: Ash, Jackal, IQ, 
---
* Utility: Buck, Grindlock, Twitch, Selge, lion
---
* Support: Hibana, Thermite, Thatcher, Capitao.
---
U can cheat on console I‚Äôve seen it a few times and there are websites where u can buy cheats
---
I'm calling people pieces of shit only if they team kill and harass people, if it doesnt apply to you then it's not meant for you. and my brother doesnt even talk so they couldnt know his age. Finally I'm well aware that an angry reddit post wont do anything to fix the situation but I'm also aware that if enough people speak up about it then the devs may in fact listen like they have in the past with the reverse friendly fire.
---
I always thought that the dark side of the image is the inside, but it would be kindof wierd if the attackers would be breaching from in to out
---
Lol
---
Watch a bunch of YouTube videos. They‚Äôll give a lots of advice from lots of different perspectives.
---
It might not though. I think mine got removed because it was from an alpha pack opening. Rip
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture
---
[removed]
---
So a ‚Äútactical decision‚Äù can be made in five seconds without any prior knowledge of each other‚Äôs habits? Also, whenever I say ‚Äúno plz I am echo main‚Äù more people vote for echo.
---
Ya it's usually really easy to tell who's using MnK
---
Fun does not equal balanced.
---
Thanks for the leaked footage of the new operator
---
*Mozzie liked that*
---
I always loved Kanal.
---
That‚Äôs because echo is extremely overpowered and needs balancing
---
Nice. personally, stardust crusaders was my favorite part. What do you think of battle tendency and phantom blood so far?
---
80-90%
---
Not yet what about 420
---
Okay thanks! I‚Äôve been watching some Get_Flanked videos, do you have any other recommendations?
---
maybe a wall covered with hibana pellets saying "will you marry me?*
---
r/comedyhomicide
---
I always get fucked in solo queues. Mostly through match abandons every game.
---
That's pretty good to know
---
Changing the old format as well? Well, nevermind I am happy with the rook mine snoo.
---
all hail
---
Thats more of a gameplay feature right? Aesthetically aren‚Äôt they all wearing gas mask?
---
Yeah even casual is a bit toxic at times too
---
lol
---
Yeah, it was the warden from behind
---
Tomorrow is when the charms challenges are usually added, maybe they will be something.
---
Can you screenshot where the top of her head comes into frame? lol
---
‚ÄúDONT PEEK‚Äù
---
Not at my rank. No one uses his properly because he‚Äôs always banned and no one learns
---
Now that makes more sense.
---
You didn't shoot fast enough dude
---
Smoke's elite isn't even out yet. Your point doesn't make sense.
---
That‚Äôs how he‚Äôs meant to be used. That and information gathering
---
Yo I‚Äôm down I can start a realm soon dm me if you wanna start one up
---
7 million as their was a week left  I would have understood at the beginning of the event but the last week when the popularity dies down. It was a definite miscalculation
---
That sweet sweet money
---
Epic is still best tier pound for pound. Not too flashy like lower tiers, yet not too bland like legs.
---
Did the other team not try to run anti shields? Ela, echo, lesion,Frost...??
---
exactly what i said after the Cyclops vs Orgless qual match. sucks even more w Orgless though because if they had gone to the Major, they definitely would've had a chance at getting exposed to an org &amp; getting picked up. fuck Montagne.
---
he didnt specify ddos, he's probably just doing ping (ip) -t -l 65500. fucking skid lmao
---
Going prone and meleeing the corner of his shield until his ankle is exposed enough to hit it also works.
---
The person who writes patch notes (not just for R6 but for all games in general) is a memelord $$$$100%%%%
---
Nobody will throw me a party
---
I think I don't have one since I was 12
---
But I got to play on a siege event at my local airsoft field, it was fun as fuck
---
My friends have recently started playing the game. I have 1000 hours in the game myself. All I can say is if you do get it it'll be very daunting. There's a lot of operators at this point but just take it easy, explore the game at your own pace. You'll learn a lot from other players and, most importantly, have fun!
---
Ok. I‚Äôm going to play a little mini game. There are five operators. The objective is Armory lockers on border. Thermite, Thatcher, Ash, Buck, and Twitch. Who do you replace with Glaz? Why? If you can‚Äôt replace anyone then Glaz is truly not good. I love glaz but I can‚Äôt replace anyone in this scenario.
---
Wrong.
---
I think echo was banned, and frost is useless in pro league because of the sheer inhuman game sense these guys have.
---
yeah. he's supposed to watch the defuser post-plant.
---
I also have zero and we‚Äôre both frost mains coincidence I think not
---
why do you think copper is the colour is it? They all end up down there.
---
Wait like get it permanently?
---
awwwwwwwwwwww *hug* I would throw you a party if I could.
---
Hello AeroKnight-, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgmk9l/teammates_needed_on_pc/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

What is that weapon Nokk is holding? I've seen it in a thumbnail too and I don't know what it is
---
Best callout was in one of Bikini's videos: "Watch out, they're inside the building".
---
Totally seriously meant xD
---
Yeah Monty abuse is still strong in Siege. In Pro League and high level Ranked, it's used all the time. The hipfire nerf didn't even do much.
---
My solution for it is simple. Add a stamina bar that depletes when Monty has his shield extended and is moving. When his stamina is depleted, he can no longer move with his shield fully extended. The stamina only recharges when Monty drop his shield and wait a short cooldown.
---
F

Same

One of Mozzie's pests. The light ring on the top is actually the ring in a perfectly fitted socket for said ring. The pest is attached to a 3D printed model of one of the normal drones. When you propose, hope for the best and if she says yes, say the line that mozzie says when he catches one of the drones. Do this in full Mozzie cosplay (or don't).
---
Blitz is a poor pick. The rest are pretty standard though.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
It‚Äôs not abuse, they used Montagne as he‚Äôs supposed to be used...
---
It‚Äôs more or less unhealthy in a competitive environment but that‚Äôs what you get when you don‚Äôt have a hard counter picked. They could have ran a counter strat but didn‚Äôt, so they lost.
---
Do you play with a team or by yourself?
---
Zulu
---
Any chance you can give a full house tour of it? Looks sick.
---
Even the elites are getting garbage, like why not give smoke a WWI or WWII uniform rather than the garbage that got leaked
---
Hackers are getting out of hand more than any expansion for me, so far.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm starting to go against at least 3 hackers a day in casual (maybe 10-15 matches each day). Casual was always the place to get away from hackers, but now the two-factor authentication has just divided the hackers to be in both ranked AND casual. This is fucking stupid.
---
This is getting out of hand.
---
As a below average player who ALWAYS end up in a low league all I can say is good luck. I have been playing since launch and it has only been getting steadily worse. Cant even go 5 games in a row without a teamkill on either their team or ours. Leavers? Every other game. Ubi really only seems to care as long as their pockets are full. Quite shameful really.
---
&lt;3  
---
I would throw you a part too  
---
With hostages, mustard gas and live ammunitiom too &lt;3
---
Just say fuck it, you'll learn maps, sites, and (especially) strats much better and faster in ranked. You'll also be forced to take it more seriously, it should just be a better learning environment than casual. Good luck and have fun!
---
*miscalculation*
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEb1jZErYeE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEb1jZErYeE)
---
This game is getting pretty toxic latley
---
can I die in the mustard gas!!!!
---
Honestly it more about the team than just 1 player. I usually play 2 or 3 games of casual then hit up rank and if I'm losing too many games just go back to casual
---
Just play ranked
---
If you are trying to go for a plant, Glaz can throw a smoke and cover anyone trying to push up and deny. So in that situation, I would replace either Ash or Twitch.
---
The game isn't just about fragging out with high dps weapons.
---
&gt;But its only annoying for them not for you. They don't get to play the ops they enjoy playing while you just gain.
---
That's....... the point. I am playing against my opponents, not with them. This is a team based 5v5 tactical tdm. I am obligated to serve the greater good of my team, and that obligation prohibits me from catering to the enemies' interests, if that was ever an intention. It is my job to win and make my team win, so as long as it is in the TOS of the game, whatever I do is legal and perfectly fine. If it annoys the enemy team, that's on them and it is beneficial to my team.
---
And if a player gets enjoyment from JUST the 4 ops banned, then they aren't playing the game right. You play what the team needs, and only when that's not a necessity, you pick what you want.
---
Annoyance, frustration and irritation are all personal feelings and emotions that are specific to the person. If the system annoys somebody but doesn't annoy somebody else, then it isn't the system's fault. That person who's annoyed can always overcome the emotion. It is his issue and he needs to sort it out.
---
&gt;Its related because this system was implemented for the majority as a bandaid solution against certain ops.
---
No. It was tested for a year in PL and boot camp sessions before release, and barely anybody objected in the SI list and on TTS when it came out. So ubi took it as positive feedback and implemented it.
---
&gt; The fact is the people that play these ops that are getting banned are in the minority otherwise we would be seeing a lot more complaints.
---
Jackal is an overpicked op. Believe me, there's enough opposition to his nerf. The only reason you don't see him is because the nerf doesn't do much and the very nature of his gadget is lackluster and not influential. At 4 pings, he's still useless alone and lethal in a 3 stack AT LEAST.
---
Blitz is a complaint across all ranks. I don't have an issue, but I've seen enough number of pros complain about it as well.
---
Monty is no biggie. He was bound to be touched.
---
&gt; Just imagine if Ash or Twitch was a common ban yea that would go over well wouldnt it?
---
Have you played at plat? I've myself banned twitch once, and played Mira to totally f**k over the enemy team at Hereford. I'm not plat, yet, but there are a lot or plats at high gold and you see a lot more bans than the usual jackal blitz Cav echo. We banned Mira and valk once and left echo out. I don't remember the exact outcome of the game, but it was fun.
---
Anywhere below gold, people ban what they find annoying. And that's ok considering that they have the freedom to do as they please, and that's "choice" right there. If you need variety, your only choice is to rank up OR communicate.
---
(Copied and Pasted from a reply to someones post that I found on google. Also there were links that didn‚Äôt paste over too. But this is a list of some you can watch)

Macie Jay - Creative and top-level gameplay, shows off a lot of useful tricks, thinks outside the box. You can find his Twitch here.
---
KingGeorge - Pro player for Rogue, former world champion. Especially his map guides are very useful, also uploads gameplay highlights from top-level diamond and funny moments. You can find his Twitch here.
---
Rogue-9 - Testing and in-depth analysis of gameplay mechanics. Not to be confused with the Pro League team Rogue, there's no affiliation.
---
KiXSTAr - Retired pro player, current caster of the Pro League. Uploads highlights from his Twitch streams and frag movies. There's probably no-one that knows more about this game than him.
---
Rainbow 6 Pro League - The official Pro League YouTube channel. You can find replays of every Pro League match ever on there but you can also catch them live on Twitch.
---
yo_boy_Roy - Originally a console player, now also on PC. Advanced tips &amp; tricks, especially his Inside the Mind of a Diamond series is pretty great.

---
Beaulo - Raw gameplay highlights showing off his extraordinary gun skill.
---
It was ranked game and I won, until now I never thought of posting it.
---
So tell Ubi to balance him.. all PL teams use Monty. They all want him balanced, but they're also not ignorant enough to be mad at another team for using him while he's in the game. That's part of PL. 
---
Also, didn't DZ have a major spot already before this game?
---
Echos banned thats expected, rec could have used smoke, lesion, Ela, pulse from downstairs or even a clash counter. 
---
Monty isnt a free win, especially on proL
---
Uranus, genius.
---
two words, target demographic.
---
I think there was a hole drilled in the bathroom door
---
Are you gonna do the outside too?
---
I see. Thanks for your advice. I like starting conversations about this stuff cause it makes me a better player overall.
---
Echo and Monty will be banned every game as long as I'm in it
---
That's the point genius
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
Now hit it three times
---
Ya that‚Äôs a good point. 
---
I solo que most of the time. I only have one buddy that plays and he just got the game a month ago.
---
Take it to casual and play him all you want
---
Im surprised no one has brought up the massive weed plants behind her.
---
I‚Äôm 160 and I‚Äôve bought over 100 packs with renown and I have 1 black ice for a primary and a couple for some side arms :/
---
But you do have a mic equipped. That's my point, you have the option  to talk. You can keep the muting function. Just make having a microphone equipped. My teammate litterally said he didn't have a microphone.
---
It is. I've been doing it for 4 years and my aim is pretty bad. The drone can't jump and its bigger than other drones.
---
Also some folks are just shy.
---
No it‚Äôs not.
---
Some of the ‚ÄúDDosing‚Äù has apparently been Ubi servers being Ubi servers
---
But if they were actually doing it then it‚Äôs just pathetic.
---
Boink!
---
That was funny to see.
---
You aren't supposed to play a competitive-like mode in a team based 5v5 shooter that needs communication, without communicating as and when you are supposed to.
---
Chat will always show delayed and aged callouts.
---
Try using her shotgun she is my main and I only use shotgun
---
Yes.
---
It is growing
---
It was casual too so
---
This dude already out there on the top secret U.S. Lunar base lmao
---
Bro I said it would be fun against AI.  Not players.
---
Unit at it‚Äôs finest
---
Not an Ela main, barely play her, but I was able to control the recoil the last time I played her.
---
Pull down. That's it.
---
NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS!
---
I found that despite this being a sort of glitch, flash hider on the scorpion makes it a laser with just down control but her shotgun is also stupidly good
---
Thanks dad
---
The moustache is the hat makes me think he touches kids man
---
Idk man I think he looks creepy
---
Similarly, one time when playing ranked, I was camping near a window as Cav and a teammate was like "why didn't you peak??" after he peaked and died.  Why should I risk a peak when I can lay in waiting for them to pass by me?
---
I have faith that you‚Äôll win your next diamond match friend!
---
then you'll be fine on pc
---
You can't make holes in reinforcements and expect to be quieter as well. He made peek holes in reinforcements quieter than you make punch holes in soft walls. That was fundamentally broken, because reinforcements are the only reliable means of defense defenders have.
---
I play Mav, and I'm happy with this change because it makes him a "little more" balanced than before. Remember, he still doesn't have reliable counters.
---
The problem isnt with me you prepubescent twat, it's my younger brother, but I'm sure you didnt even read it.
---
Y‚Äôall should meet up lol
---
The point of the gift skins are usually to push more use out of the lesser used gun.
---
I mean....he is probably a father. *Shrugs shoulders*
---
If you want to play ranked then dont rekly on having jackal, hes banned in 90% of the games i play
---
this is a repost
---
Oh yeah? Well I don't even own Siege!

Smh he really just wanted to skip the real experience

I wish i could draw like this the only thing i can draw a little decent are stickmans....
---
Pull out the internet cable on the router. Good luck detecting that vs "potatoe" Internet.

Also you need to intentionally quit the game and restart in order to fix the majority of the repeat sound/reload/animation bugs.

Hello SouthAfricanBaller, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgoahi/loading_error_when_booting_up_rainbow_six_pls_help/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What server do you play on?
---
Recoil control. Practice to get good recoil control. Start with doc and use the MP5K. It has crazy easy recoil. Controlling recoil is the best way to get kills.
---
lol thanks love the flair m8
---
Damn looks sick.
---
It's unfortunate that Ubi doesn't learn from their mistakes though
---
My comment is comparing **10 @ 800** and **10 @ 1600**
---
You make some fair points. I‚Äôm not sure if we can agree on this or not but I‚Äôm fine with a slight increase in sound but the footage shown is a bit too much noise for me. Defeats much of the purpose of him. Also I find it ridiculous how far away u can recognize the sound from. You can be a good room or two over and hear that thing. Like I said earlier, I‚Äôm fine with a slight nerf, just not this large.
---
Hshshs thanks m8
---
Im pretty sure they actually nerfed the thing awhile ago, the fire rate was way faster a couple seasons ago but in wind bastion (i think) they slowed the fire rate
---
Zofia, flexible gadget, awesome guns.. You want to open a wall? Sure. You wanna stun the shit out of enemy? Sure. Rush? Yes..

Caveira, hated spooky woman, is spooky, can step silently, interrogate enemies, has a cannon pistol, recoilles spawn peek gun. She may be hated but she is crucial

1. Fair enough

2. No I think it‚Äôs plenty valid considering both have an ability meant to go relatively unnoticed. Cav has nothing to do with reinforcements

3. Ok and sound is also a counter to every op. What other counter can maverick realistically have? If you‚Äôre nearby you can hear the torch. If you‚Äôre in another area code or not paying attention you shouldn‚Äôt be able to, that‚Äôs the whole point of his gadget, stealth.

Because you have human sympathy and I love others cries for help

Lol probably

The things what one have to see doing solo queue......
---
Range buff, yeah. Maybe even have compensator or extended barrel as additional attachments?
---
I like how when you shot it he was like. Ohh, and started to move locations
---
Oh but still better than doing m&amp;k in consolo i guess and you can have your consolo to play modern games and the pc or laptop to games you like to play and they arent in consolo or you dont have memory left because i have a ps4 and i have bfv warframe and another games who have high graphic demand or is just more easy to me play those games in console
---
Cool!
---
Siege doesn't, overwatch does
---
At least for me
---
this aint the sub for this
---
Artist said before he wanted Nokk to have Ar15 with suppressor. 
---
That's a night vision goggle, which really fits someone who would do stealth operation imo.
---
night visions goggles need a nerf. pls ubi
---
I really don't get why they don't set up a threshold for groups on Ranked, honestly
---
Its a nice idea but for the attacking and defending what guns would alibi and maestro use since they dont have an attacking op from the same ctu
---
So it will automatically be added to the inventory?
---
Its inaccurate he still has the ACOG
---
Yikes
---
How long were you kidnapped for?
---
Also except that you wouldn't one git barricades, let alone walls. It would pinch a hammer sized hole and that's it.
---
That has to come with practice.
---
Firstly, find your right sensitivity.
---
Then, put that into Aim Lab (free on steam) and play flicks training.
---
Rinse, repeat and do that in Th.
---
Yeah but i didnt buy a 100% gaming laptop i buy one to do things i need or school projects because my old pc was slow and bad and i get scammed whit a notebook long time ago who cant open chrome and i always take care if it have dust or problems obviusly i play a lot in vacations but no only in my laptop i use my console to so my laptop have a longer life :)
---
Dok on defense would be fun
---
PS4 silver
---
If they can afford a pc/console + the game I'm more than certain theyre able to spend like 10 bucks on a headset or mic in general.
---
Oh okay gotcha! That's a good idea. I also have an Ultrabook I use for high end video/media editing and school stuff then I have my gaming PC I've been building onto for years now.
---
I haven't gotten pass gold 1 on consol and gold 3 on PC. I also have no friends or a mic, that may explain why
---
Wait people who aren‚Äôt color blind can see this?
---
Just to add a bit of info how I got this idea:
---
I was watching some pro league this season, and I felt like I've become bored of it, because I'm seeing the same strats, the same ideas, the same pushes, anchors, gunfight spots. The only thing new was the ultra-aggressive gameplay by certain teams on defense, but it's become very common to see teams doing it now.
---
I thought maybe by having such a game-mode, it would revolutionize the whole game. It would make for strats and possibilities we've not seen before, and it would unlock a lot of strategic depth in this game that could be so much fun to exploit.
---
Another thing is this game is running out of innovative and smart operator/characters that are being released every season. This might help limit the damage of the new operators/characters being either stale, or their ability just not being innovative enough.
---
Another point to consider is that this might boost the pick-rates of certain characters in a side that otherwise don't get picked at all. For example: Warden is basically garbage, but on attack, he might be very useful against Smoke.
---
Lastly, if you want to consider this game having something like a real-life-style lore/story, attacking operators/characters are not only going to be picked for one kind of mission only. Maybe they will be used for defensive purposes too. So if you subscribe to that perspective, this would make more sense, though, wouldn't it?
---
Ive found all kinds of plats there
---
Tachanka is in a class higher than s so he had to reset back to f
---
In my opinion, Mute should be A or B and echo A
---
Beta was so much fun. It's the only beta I've played in a game where I knew I was going to instantly buy the game.
---
It's not.
---
He has been consistently overpicked AND was still too weak. People play him for his raw and brutal fragging power, Which is countered by Intel. The nature of his gadget is advantageous to defenders because they can waste a scan and time, also considering he has to stand still so that's 3 seconds wasted. He needs coordination AND excess utility to really pin down a defender.
---
He's B, being generous.
---
Hello SirIcyYT, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgov2e/am_i_good_at_the_game_these_took_a_week_to_get/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
In my experience, jackal scans someone and gets baited out. Or the person who gets scanned wastes a lot of time. Even with the gun, jackal should be B or A
---
That was the same with last season couldn't get passed gold 2
---
Explain
---
A twitch drone
---
I‚Äôm in Bronze 1, I mostly play casual but when I have more than 2 friends with me we usually end up playing ranked
---
In my personal experience, only casual seems to be toxic, ranked is mostly fine.
---
Make some guns up. Or give them existing ones, from a different CTU. I don't know how they thought Jackal should be given a Canadian knock-off of an American assault-rifle [C7E is basically Canada copying the M16].
---
Maybe give them an F2000, or something.
---
This^^
---
It happens when there's an object blocking the camera. In this case it's the plants which _while transparent_ still block the scan
---
Press F to pay respects.
---
Wow good stuff right there...  I want to build a gaming pc but when i have my work because i dont have space and they are a little expensive....
---
Hey that‚Äôs a good idea
---
I'm only missing the gold rank
---
I let my friend host and he has hostage, i was like fuck me when i saw the hostage after i shot.
---
Nice
---
the fact he flicked on console in the first place is amazing.
---
Take your upvote and get out of my face
---
I joined a game, heard screaming yelling a clanging and was vote kicked before I could pick a spawn
---
Yeah I guess
---
Haha, split-screen games were my favorites when I was a kid :D
---
Oh makes me sad when the delicius shocc dron i captured get destroyed by my teammates :(
---
So that's where my plasma pink skin alpha pack went üòÅ
---
Yup, sounds like siege.
---
I have no issues with any map other than hereford. I can manage on chalet buf hereford is just horrendous
---
Ok thx
---
Also they were all super young
---
Sometimes they need to quit, like what LanZx said. Cursor bugs, sound bugs, etc. The real solution is to count the downed player as dying if they disconnect.
---
I mean, the ability is nice, But I personally go most rounds without suing his ability. I mainly use them for the gun, the ability I use if I feel someone is a specific threat that‚Äôs hiding or the last one alive is hidden or unknown.
---
That's so fucking cool! Might I add some suggestions for an in-house game of Siege? 
---
-Have Blackbeard's shield be plastic wrap wrapped around a coat hanger
---
-Have your friends in a group text and you call them all when playing as Dokk
---
-Have tiny firecrackers as stun grenades
---
-*Use real bullets*
---
myself i dont care much for skins as i prefer skinless guns
---
People are stupid, how to get banned 101 right here. Is this person fucking seriously advertising boosting in broad-fucking-daylight?
---
You'll be in a better place if you play ranked and learn to not worry about stats. As someone that mostly stuck with Cas for *hundreds* of hours, you well learn Maps well - but your game sense and knowing operator roles won't be as well developed.
---
Exactly the point. He's now not as much of a one man army and will need help from team play to be really successful, exactly where he should be.
---
People aren't banning ops that they don't know how to play around, they're banning ops they don't WANT to play around. Echo, Jackal and Monte are broken shit operators that are unfun to play against 90 times out of 10.
---
That's that Mars wifi
---
Nomad and smoke are S, since the former doesn't have any reliable counters when holding down doors and stairs, and the latter is the best choke defender currently.
---
Cap is an A, being proven by his highest ban rate in pro league and the fact that he legit has 0 counters (and ADS immunity).
---
Mira is an S. No clue why she's an A. Second highest banned defender in PL, and very high even in ranked.
---
Gridlock is an easy A. She's what nomad is, but for inside the room and for hallways. One Trax can waste upto 10 seconds, which can destroy a retake. The amount of sound Intel she provides by just a defender stepping on it cannot be provided by anybody else. Plus, second best LMG on attack. Easy A.
---
Kapkan is a B or C since his traps are easy to take out, and IQ is another easy A given that she detects some 20 odd gadgets, and is the only one who doesn't have to let her guard down while detecting gadgets AND can reliably detect a defuser being disabled without having to expose herself.
---
Quite a few changes needed, but these are the major highlights.
---
yea sometimes with squad
---
I think the main issue is a large amount of the player base are literal children. Only time I‚Äôve heard people talk in chat they‚Äôre about 8-14 years old.
---
Damm, I reached plat level 26
---
Looks good! Once I finish building Villa and another guys I've seen here gets Bank done, we'll have 3 playable maps in Minecraft!

You earn a veteran account if you remember the old version where defenders where terrorists

Man i hate that i would have one all my placement maches if someone didnt do that it was 3 to 1 we were about to win and then boom it was runind granted im still happy i got plat 2 but fuck this shits annoying that people have to cheat to get ahead while ruining the game for everyone else
---
Fucking mute mains. (Even tho my main is just an edgy mute with a jammer on his back)
---
3k? Lol
---
Capitao should be higher imo
---
Not gonna lie
---
A lot of games just auto-kick you when you teleport, straight to ban-land.
---
I love democracy
---
Yo, a server would be much better cuz we could copy our already existing maps there. I'm currently halfway through making Villa
---
Ah a fellow german

I specialize in giving rook mains 5 seconds to place their armor and run
---
Have your friend even played the game?
---
Yeah it stands for 3,000
---
Gamora-‚ÄúWhat did it Cost‚Äù 
---
    
---
‚Äú just my drone tbh‚Äù
---
I came back from a long break and thought it was a discovery queue for a new map. After 4 games I just went back to ranked with no headshots lol
---
But why at night you could barely see
---
A small price to pay for a nice kobe
---
And koooooobe at the 3
---
Adding on to what Voltron said...
---
Once you‚Äôve played the game long enough, you‚Äôll start to get a pretty good idea of where to expect Lesion mines too. There are some around doors or behind windows that you can‚Äôt shoot without getting close enough to trigger them, but there are plenty of stairs and hallways that Lesion players will often Gu up, and once you get in the habit of looking for them in these particular spots you can shoot them pretty easily
---
It would be a bit more balanced if it was on a cool down like N√∏kk, apart from the the concept is good
---
Mira is a must have and costs Just 15 k instead of Alibi
---
Nice work my boi
---
People think being toxic is funny
---
As a former toxic roamer it‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt know the satisfaction of taking a three speed to the other side of the map, waiting a whole minute, then getting a 3k from behind the enemy team.
---
Yep you're 100% a sledge main no doubt about it
---
Here b4 Comcast
---
I am! I love sledge

But what's so good about the hot pockets that the blood god rewards you with
---
HACKED A NIFTY DRONE followed by a hail of bullets. Bonus points if they hit you with a stray bullet also.

Very true but the most accurate part is how two people from those different ranks will be qued for the same ranked game

How have ubi not changed the description for seasonal skins yet its been confusing people for years
---
As in 3000 points? Which is less than standard when winning a game?
---
THE SHOT FROM AI AND ITS GOOD!
---
No no no, as in my ping. Did you even read the title?
---
Hss it been happening for the past couple of days?
---
Can you hear others talk?
---
Did you check with a friend if they see a microphone next to your name in the scoreboard?
---
Does your mic work in other services such as Discord or TS?
---
now post the rest
---
ƒ∞t could be
---
Whooooosh
---
You‚Äôre probably trash to be honest. Cockiness is normally a sign of weakness.
---
those first 3 missed knives gave me so much anxiety
---
I‚Äôve never seen someone miss so consistently on such an open target with an agog before. That was probably god tier potato aim.
---
Or it could just be a casual lobby.
---
I'm so good I could play the game with a blindfold on with one arm.
---
U can tell ur bronze
---
Why not jump on the "le Operation health" then, or anything else for that matter.
---
Wish I could. My chat logs might still exist on there in the chat log. He banned me because people couldn't comprehend my greatness. Honestly, I'm the best gamer the world has ever seen.
---
I have black ice for every pistol and nothing else
---
Olive oil! that stuff destroys glue without destroying the rest of the surface, and isn't toxic to anything.
---
Seriously, it changed my life when it comes to removing glue/stickers/residue.
---
Hello sir, allow us to introduce our main
---
***Coolest thing ive seen all day***
---
The disrespect
---
Some people only play casual. I am level 130~ with some 400h played over the past year or two and I have never played enough ranked matches to even get a rank.
---
It's just too much drama and salt over there.
---
I tried. No one listens anyway
---
MP5SD is only good for low recoil + ACOG. It is decent without it, but there's a reason people don't use FMG9 and MP5k on the SAS ops.
---
FMG9 is absolutely worthless compared to any assault rifle.
---
When you reach Ping 99999 you literally become god
---
But most of the time it works like that :/
---
I think they should do it just like Overwatch. You get 1000 elo difference maximum until you reach plat, then it become 500.
---
Might as well be an agog with the state of this gameplay üòÇ
---
Don't forget to add that spawn peek
---
Yeah the title says 3k not ping.
---
Does this guy have a trebuchet for an arm or what? Crazy distance on these casual lobs.
---
All of the time hopefully. Swinging into air does nothing.
---
Imagine giving her the vector
---
Love it, your girlfriend deserves "gold" award. Gratz!
---
Yeah that's been a thing forever
---
Did you not watch the video? Or do you not know how to count? Either way, fix it.
---
I cant even remember the last time i aced but they stole an ace from me and it was a fucking tachanka ace
---
Unless you got an callout that they are low health. I actually clutched a 1v3 with the evil eyes.

I like bandit...
---
Cha cha cha real smooth
---
Yeah thats true but only 3 armor operators can get acog - j√§ger and bandit got them and the sight was abused for spawnpeaking thats why the removed it from 3 speed op. Elas scorpion got insane recoil and how can you not switch between holo and acog ? On defense holo reflex and iron sights are in most situations better than the acog that doc etc. got.
---
They acknowledge them.. but don't seem to learn.
---
They die for that round
---
At least in my experience, they play serious. The teenagers who play the game mostly trash talk because people have lower skill than them and insult kids who play the game because of their voice.
---
This isnt really that hard though, its a good shot that you can take the time to line up
---
Mistakes happen, and I don't want salty players who ran in front of my bullets to kill me instantly by saying it was an intentional tk when it clearly wasn't

Isn't it 30 atm?

She's a keeper!

"We put you here so you could do your job not playing some freakin online game."

All you would have to do to figure out if a roamed is nearby is designate someone as the guy everyone shoots in the foot and if they take damage there‚Äôs someone near lol
---
ah ok
---
FMG is considered as an OK to a good gun from Defender's perspective while being an underwhelming option for Attacker.
---
MP5k and FMG are used by operators who have area utilities and Smoke even have some damage aspect. They hang around the obj and fight against 1 or 2 armor Attackers who went through traps and Roamers so they are often not at full health. Since the Attackers are the one coming for them, the high rate of fire with low recoil allows for easy headshot thanks to the angle advantage the Defenders have.
---
For an Attacker who works extremely solo and away from the team, FMG just feels inadequate. Attackers generally have high DPS and range to have an edge over Defenders. Nokk doesn't have that edge. Her only strength is her stealth, which is countered the moment there is a barbed wire or any other obstacle in her way. The moment Anchors hold angle against her, Nokk offers nothing to the team. 
---
Though I do think that if she can run while using her gadget without loosing her stealth, it would justify her having FMG and being a 2 speed.
---
Makes sense. Complain about an issue and then not fix it.. Sense üíØ
---
What platform are you on?
---
nice job
---
You will get the hang of it. When you do, you will realize people will drop like flies.
---
thanks
---
Yeah. The only defense LMG.
---
That's fairly meaningless, CS also most definitely bans a lot of users, they just dont bring attention to it. Ubi do this to try and stop the community complaining about hacks, it does work.
---
There is nothing Ubi can do about MnK, they could try and use machine learning to detect it but thats a little far fetched given the number of players. Just report them and move on, don't get toxic or say shit in chat.
---
Oops I meant 40 or 50 I‚Äôll edit that haha.
---
no please i don't deserve it
---
Don‚Äôt hate the company and I don‚Äôt care about queue time. But I bet the second I get into a Mach I am gonna get kicked (24:30)

I need to know how many people you killed, though üòÇ

The highest you get this season.

Angry mum rant over

30 secs 8nti round, all 5 plebs are into the room and they don't reinforce the third wall? Seems legit

Runout heavy. Not much other.

Ok? No need to bring your personal life into the subreddit....but ok.

Delete this. Old club house/Jager ACOG is too much to bear mate

Actually it‚Äôs not that empty, because it means that you‚Äôre aiming nearly in the right place
---
F for Better Hereford :(

Harsh lesson. Don't TK.
---
That's on you. Be the bigger player and don't team kill them back.
---
Rush B, Finka, lion ,blitz, Monty, ash/thermite
---
I mean, it‚Äôs stupid how the system can be abused. welp
---
Shoot head
---
Fuck, I thought we were talking about tower

Yeah I got him started on the game. I know how it feels lol
---
True. However the idiot still walked onto the grenade üò¢

People will abuse the systems. This is why I didn‚Äôt want RFF

The callout "room" would mean for me that he's in the objective so, still good?

Yeah you can't fix stupid on that part lol

I don't think this is happening enough to call it an issue. Yeah it happens sometimes and it sucks. If they're really afk they'll get kicked and get an abandonment sanction. If they're trolling then shit, report them and move on.

I like the map layout, the run outs are a bit too abundant. Maybe a few tweaks, but other maps need reworks before skyscraper. *cough* FAVELA *cough*
---
Att: Capitao. Insane utility for basicly every situation, good gun, basicly no counters.
---
Def: Valkyrie. Again insane utility (Info for the win) Good gun.
---
Can someone tell me what a 4 stack is? Squad of 4 playing together?
---
Started playing during white noise. So no not that new.
---
They were trying to die lmao
---
Bruh
---
finka because you finka nut
---
You two probably have hardware issues. My best bet is that your GPUs are faulty or worn out so they lose their minds when they encounter higher workloads.
---
Maybe you should focus on actually playing and practicing instead of spamming this sub. This is your 25th post in the last 24 hours...
---
Lmao
---
They had a script running to keep them moving side to side so the game doesn‚Äôt kick them for inactivity. I just believe that there should be something that punishes players that throw matches in ranked. Reporting for toxic behaviour rarely does anything.
---
I was thinking that after i replied haha
---
&gt;  replace everyone's least favorite map, outback 
---
*The entirety of the R6 community would like to know your location*
---
You believe Skyscraper is more balanced than Outback?
---
I get confused too
---
I don‚Äôt understand. That was a pretty average two piece
---
Same as for lazy call-outs like ‚Äúon yellow ping or on ping‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have time to look for your ping when I‚Äôm paying attention to nearby roamers or nearby attackers
---
Lmao mine craft pe
---
Not for me!
---
He always gives the excuse it‚Äôs so that siege can patch it, but whenever someone has trouble with it he re explains in depth how to do it. He should definitely get banned
---
I  want to do this with nerf guns and  my dog as the hostage.

Why do you think I called it neat.lol
---
I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so neat about a mediocre casual 2k

EU Servers
---
It‚Äôs neat not amazing

Hahaha it‚Äôs all good I figured you did but I agree fuck tower
---
Please explain.
---
You can with a grenade apparently
---
Yeah sure, *miscalculation*
---
Oh weird
---
Get a clip next time and report them to Ubisoft support. The in game report does nothing.
---
It's no more personal then 80% of the other shit posted here
---
This game mode sucked ass! best part was all the easter eggs on the map lmao
---
But a mira mirror not on a wall should throw up a red flag.
---
Lion has cool weapons but Finka boost and meme material (sausage) is also good.
---
Both are great, and I play both constantly, I'd say buy Lion if you go for weapons or Finka if you are more for different gadgets.
---
Not bad
---
***A small price to pay for salvation.***
---
Personally I think it's fine to go Blitz, if you can master shield ops, they can be extremely powerful. But that said you I think you should use some other ops like I mentioned above. Try not to get tunnel visioned in general, with operators, or with gameplay. Stay flexible, and you'll be a very very valuable player
---
Actual Tachanka main here,bois [-]7
---
You know, it would be much easier to write it on Russian for me, but you‚Äôre all English here, so don‚Äôt blame me for my bad English plz
---
*1)*ANY spawnpeek can be better with Tachanka, cause he has a goddamn shield on his turret, a lot of damage and a lot of ammo,if you ask me, i‚Äôm gonna show you some of this ‚ÄòPeeks
---
*2)*Tachanka role is similar to Smoke, he must hold enemy push and don‚Äôt let them go on the objective. Tachanka must choose his position clever, here is rules to take your position
---
1.You always must have a retreat path 
---
2.You must check ONLY ONE door/window/corridor 
---
3. You must always have absolute cover
---
 
---
4.Not a mandatory rule,but you better have ADS close to you,cause there can be Sledgy or Bucky boi with grenades 
---
*3)*Enemies on high ranks except everything,but not Tachanka,also they peek you very much thinking that you‚Äôre useless piece of trash,but you‚Äôre not a trash, you are LORD
---
i love this ghetto nokk
---
I'm glad you caught that I was joking, I was hopping I wouldn't come off like an asshole lmao
---
hit his head lmao if u missed its not the operators fault
---
Yea but this game is more about multiplayer. It‚Äôs team-based is it not. But if I get team killed and kick because I‚Äôm not over level 80 then why should I even play the game.
---
No no üòÇüòÇ
---
Go back on your break clearly it wasn‚Äôt long enough
---
Why not on pc?
---
Dident know i could put it on here from the ps4 how do you do that ?
---
truth x
---
Where did you hear that she was going to have a non acog rifle? 
---
Every leaks seems to indicate different guns overall. Did I miss something?
---
No it's not really slow paced. It gets pretty heated in bomb and platinum ranks. You just never see it on Reddit because people don't feel the need to post a 1v5 or just don't need the attention
---
Not really new i have seen this idea go around a lot
---
Where did you here that?
---
blackbeard should be s tier tho
---
The f o r b i d d e n  s c o p e

My personal favorite is ak with iron sights
---
Cav time!
---
thats no reason lmao
---
It's pretty funny to pair him up with a Mira hole that watches a main approach. 
---
It's not always a winning strategy, but when it works. . . It just one of the greatest things ever.
---
But if you didn‚Äôt team kill that other dude on purpose the grenade wouldn‚Äôt have gotten you banned
---
why ash? caus u cant hit ur shots
---
But for real, how do I? Any time I try, it only does one
---
Or maybe just removed him kill altogether. But that‚Äôs what makes seige, seige
---
I hope you threw a referral code on that
---
Well you can use the many features available to do so. I personally use ps4 remote
---
blackbeard should be s tier
---
Soul for a soul
---
Golds are the most cautious ranked players. They aren't low rank enough to not worry about dying but aren't high enough rank to be confident about dangerous run-outs
---
Jager the match is about to start.. give me back the acog.
---
Also, isn't he the one who said that Nokk doesn't replace anyone in the meta?
---
Fake. It has an acog
---
nah nah nah, a ring with an ACOG *on* it
---
Ela ***Thicc***
---
Bartlett has ONE single Door to enter into. Thats enough said.
---
Why does she loom 12 and 18 at the same time
---
D:
---
I am silver 1, really mainly play casual as well, but I believe that with the right team, communication  and coordination she could be really strong
---
‚ÄúThe adventures of wood 4‚Äù
---
Still he is arguably the best op in the game
---
No I just posted this for fun
---
He's playing an M game at 12 y/o. He should be kicked and tk'd repeatedly until he stops playing seeing as he has no responsible parents monitoring what he plays.
---
Normal community isn‚Äôt nearly as toxic, don‚Äôt play t hunt and it won‚Äôt be nearly as bad. Even in casual you won‚Äôt usually get tk unless you‚Äôve earned it, like afk in a doorway during prep is where I‚Äôve seen it most and play ranked if you don‚Äôt want to get tk
---
nb "target"
---
One of those two. Or any gun that's stronger than FMG at this point. 
---
With Glaz being buffed, I wouldn't be surprised if Nokk takes the worst Attacker place.
---
I feel like they should drop their radio when downed or something to prevent them from be able to leave and stop it
---
It was a pretty big issue.
---
Hiw do you get that charm

Hello Jay-Aaron, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgta3u/top_issues_and_community_concerns_updated/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Play thunt solo. Most ppl play thunt just to warm up their aim.
---
About bloody time
---
I don't remember the last time I got to play Jackal :'(
---
Please keep making more!
---
Yea they say that, but when it happened to me I had 12 ping, meanwhile the whole enemy team had 3000+ ping, therefore I have the bad connection and get kicked? Was really annoyed because it happened in OT and we had the momentum.
---
Seriously everyone is interested in raising Area 51 but they don‚Äôt realize all the good stuff got moved to the moon
---
They really did make it so much worse
---
They do
---
Will check it out. Thanks!
---
What you mean fam this my yeetin strat for attacking garage
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Good call outs are a great great tool. Hell I've had some games where I died immediately every round but still helped out a fuck ton with some super sweet call outs.
---
All call outs are not equal though and bad call outs are often worse than no call outs.
---
What really really bugs me though are those assholes that use their death as a moment to back seat drive you. 
---
Just tell me where they are or if they are coming towards my line of sight. Don't fucking sit there and tell me which way to lean, if I should crouch, or to use a different gun. Don't fucking tell me to start whacking holes in a different spot or some crazy shit. You're fucking dead, play your style when you're alive. Don't try and play vicariously through my ass who is still alive and doing better than you at the moment. 
---
That shit, that shit bugs me to no fucking end. 
---
For real though call outs should be concise and accurate.  If it takes you a fucking essay to describe where they are then you're just making it harder for everyone to hear what's going on and it's of no use.
---
I did think about that, but I wanted the ability to be more balanced and counterable rather than a free kill machine, if orcus has to keep them alive to activate such a strong ability, he runs the risk of dying if he chooses to use the same operator twice, however getting that second call could be a game changer. Wanted it to be a more consistently used caveira, with less power. He could always tamper once, and kill them
---
I really like what they did to the upstairs areas and the additions on the first floor
---
thunt isn't multiplayer based. maybe for the other modes but thunt classic is definitely singleplayer. it wasn't made to be a multiplayer mode, it's there for practice only
---
Cool
---
Tbf jm one of those players who ban him everytimeüòÇ

They call him ***Roof***

I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs on yacht I‚Äôm just saying copper 4 level playing

Oh okay, could have been cool
---
New Pulse headgear?
---
She's from poland god damn it...
---
I play the same 5 maps over and over again any way. HEREFORD-CHALET-HEREFORD-FORTRESS-AND1ESLMAP. Thats my map pool everyday.
---
And yet this isn't implemented on a game at THIS level? Triple A and has been running for 4+ years now approaching 5 and yet NOTHING is done in terms of hacking like this.
---
Fucks sake the devs need to implement SOMETHING by now it's killing the game for a lot of us.
---
The edge is cutting through my soul.
---
This works fine in casual i usually ace or almost ace with this
---
Doesn‚Äôt look quite right...
---
You get triggered seeing cute girls? Dang bruh
---
I just started playing this game after switching from Destiny 2/Apex legends. 
---
I believe the toxicity in this game blows both of those games out of the water. 
---
I got TKed at spawn for 4 rounds in a row after I failed to win a 1v3. 
---
In another game I was kicked for not getting a kill in the first and second round.
---
The shit they say over the mic is so appalling I ended up muting mic volume. 
---
I can‚Äôt under how y‚Äôall have played this game so many years. This shit makes me want to shelve the game not play more to get better.
---
Big brain move well fucking played
---
RIP my fuze shield strat, his hipfire was stupid op
---
Yeah my eyes hurt but Mr bear was our buddy and we torture him so badly whit was and shooting his flufly legs oh god oh f*ck we will never say sorry to him
---
Yeah I have a PS4 lmao, I wanna move over to PC so bad but it‚Äôs so expensive. Plus I‚Äôd probably have to start over and get all my operators again right?

Hello Azixan, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgu83e/am_i_good_though_youtube_azixan/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I kind of disagree with that. What makes a pro league map and what makes a ranked map are 2 different things. Outback and Theme Park are legitimately great maps. Yes theme park is flawed in its train side but it has 3 viable sites that can be attacked fairly easily. Outback is amazing and pretty much every pro wants it in pro league. I know I'm in the minority here but I think Fortress and Hereford are decent(not great) maps. Yes attacking top floor Hereford is a nightmare but the rest of the map is fairly well balanced. I personally love fortress but my only real problem with it is how similar most rooms look and how unused a portion of the map is. Every map I just named are good ranked maps. The problem with ranked now isn't that the map pool is complete shit it's more that there is 2 complete shit maps in there that bog down the experience. Chalet and Skyscraper are terrible maps that are in desperate need of map reworks(hopefully next year).
---
he used supressor
---
Buy the shocc dron eater he have good guns and is a good operator
---
Might not be a 1:1 but it‚Äôs still looking hella fire
---
Reverse diamond &gt; normal diamond
---
I did, I'm happy about it!
---
Too*
---
i thought somethings off with her face but i couldnt put my finger on it...
---
It‚Äôs not an ace though. Unless he killed the other attacker before the clip started.
---
thank you very cool
---
What about the eyes they're matte. The eyes look like a painting
---
Looks pretty good so far
---
Im on console ;-;

just click their heads, ez lol 4head
---
89 percent no joke
---
Here it is, my first ever Ace as Mozzie!
---
https://youtu.be/85Z9NznxmHc
---
Yeah anytime. The map has 3 viable bomb site but even kitchen/trophy in chalet is not viable enough anymore and this says a lot about the other bombsites. Or skyscraper that you can completely shut down half of the map by holding one single spot on attack and everyone knows what a shitshow this map is with all the easy runouts. Claymore map. Cheers for getting rid of these maps soon enough.
---
Spiciest shotgun in the game

You have 251 abandons this season, you are just quitting asshole.

Or strait roulette
---
Yeah ubi won‚Äôt let you transfer stuff over platforms. Which sucks. I just got the ultimate edition when I got mine cause it was on sale at the time. Honestly worth the restart though. I got an acer nitro laptop which works great for siege rn until I end up having enough for a build.
---
Imagine running out of site with Mira, to someone peaking a window. And not waiting and using her black window to get the advantage when you try and push.....
---
And it doesn‚Äôt seem OP either.
---
have sex
---
The biggest annoyance is when the shield user has enough game knowledge to position his hand behind solid cover. His bullets can hit you but yours can't him him. Rather annoying.
---
The good news is unlike a certain operator (Montagne cough cough) they all suffer from the "if they get close I die syndrome".
---
You could buy Zofia, it‚Äôs good or also Ying
---
4D chess right there

What if it‚Äôs bulletproof and needs like an explosion of something to destroy it.

your disappointment is immeasurable and your day is ruined

Could you please clarify exactly what you are referring to?

Looks good so far but maybe with darker wood?

The hell is with all the filters?
---
Ignore the whole "more info in comments" thing, I just decided to link the image in the post rather than have the post be only the image.
---
*thunk*
---
Please, for the love of god, don't remove New Hereford or Skyscraper. Just throw out Consulate, I fully realize that for reasons I'll never understand people like Coastline and Bank, but please don't touch New Hereford or Skyscraper.
---
Plane or House
---
Does he have friends that play Siege on his platform? If you go in with a pre-made, you can potentially avoid all that toxicity. Like, I only play Siege when my friends are on.
---
Villa is one of the most balanced maps in the game so it probably wont be removed.
---
hey, u cute tho
---
Old map was better they just needed to fix the top floor.
---
not cursed
---
What it love?!
---
I have the year 2s
---
cant im too traumatized from my ex's smelly vagina
---
what's global ordering? i'm dumb
---
You're still deflecting rather than defending your position. If you don't think those are bad maps, then explain why. Right now all you're doing is throwing around condescending insults.
---
Yea but that would make it so that the person holding the angle can hold a much tighter angle while being able to see more and be behind more cover therefore creating a new problem where people are almost impossible to hit, making holding a hard angle the better position instead of how it is now where the peeker has the advantage. That solution just creates more problems worse than the original.
---
Yes I fully agree with you. I suffered enough playing hereford
---
That guy has some *insane* gaming socks
---
that what they all say. 
---
Jking that was good
---
I'm playing in a competitive gamemode which is supposed to be competitive believe it or not! If you want your recruit rushes and chanka xddd memes you can play casual :D.
---
I would go with lesion, especially if you‚Äôre newer to the game. He‚Äôs a great entry denial op and being able to see where your gu mines are placed is especially helpful if you don‚Äôt have the best map knowledge. He has a nice smg, and his shotty isn‚Äôt the ~best~ but there‚Äôs worse. Been playing him since blood orchid and I‚Äôm still not tired of him.

---
Fuck she looks cute even with half her face covered up
---
Never really worth it
---
When I go in casual I have to face plats
---
Yeah same. I‚Äôm just worried about the map pool though as I like more variety and would welcome more maps if they were balanced. Just remove Chalet and Skyscraper until they get reworked and add the new Kanal in next season.
---
You can‚Äôt rely on your enemies making mistakes, you have to make them make mistakes, if you‚Äôre playing with a team then you can set up traps and baits to make them waste time
---
No, tracers are invisible when using supressor
---
U plant in a corner and step on it with Monty.
---
Lesion, Vigil, then Mira. 
---
Both Lesion and Vigil are decent characters and are easy to use for the most part. 
---
Mira is strong with practice and knowing where to set up the mirrors.
---
Hence why it needs taken out and reworked for more consistency.
---
First time I've actually seen someone KILL a hacker, crazy.
---
Maestro is a fantastic operator. Honestly I have so much fun messing around on his Evil eye, frustrating the hell out of my opponents. That and his kit is very solid.
---
Nah this is the new op they can fly and hit every single shot.
---
This really helped, so everytime I'm getting worse with aim, i can set my sens to this or does it need to go up everytime?
---
its not really a sbubby tho
---
This has to be a troll list.
---
They announced that they plan to reduce the map pool next season.
---
I want old Hereford back for the casual rotation. It wouldn't hurt anyone.
---
I want this mode back! It was a great way to warm up.
---
Interesting. I guess it was just me. I would agree then, that the internal casual elo/mmr system needs to be reworked. At the same time, why the fuck are all the high ranked players in casual lol. I don't really get that. Diamond i get, cause once you're done with the grind, you just want a break so you play some casual but still, that high of volume.
---
No he just got and got offline
---
You know how rank differs from region to region
---
It did have a second staircase. You could go outside, run upstairs, and come back inside before being detected.
---
Bank and Consulate are fine where they are, the rest I agree with. The real concern is fortress tho. Majority of the map is irrelevant and everything looks the same.
---
that's one reason i decided to post this discussion but i just wanted to find out why they do it
---
Ya I saw it as my only hope and luckily it worked out.
---
oh ok thanks
---
I've submitted reports on three occasions (once for four individuals) with overwhelmingly obvious proof and it's taken weeks every time between getting my MMR back. Most recently today, despite reporting nearly three weeks ago. Support usually responds within 48 hours, but the ban appears to take a lot longer.
---
I wish i played against bots like these
---
Poor Kappy Monty's are so mean
---
You don‚Äôt though. That‚Äôs why she can be so deadly.

**Whoa now gamers rise up**
---
NO WAY you are planning for real to reduce ranked map pool even more! How dumb can you be?! Variety is a KEY FACTOR to keep a game like this alive, the more you restrict ranked the more you'll lose players, and i am saying this as a plat1 at level 383, i know what i am talking about.
---
Knifing an operator is just like knifing the wall. it's at the center of your screen just like when you make a hole in the wall. The opponent has to be at the center of your screen.
---
You missed.
---
This. There's a fucking epidemic of cunts using a mouse and keyboard on PS4 to get an unfair advantage. 
---
There's no way a controller user is going to beat a mouse user and anyone who says its fine is either the type of cheating prick who uses one or is just talking out their ass.
---
The game is unplayable unless I fork out for one of these mouse and keyboard set ups and play with a control scheme I don't want to. 
---
It's a joke at this stage.
---
They‚Äôre buffing him
---
Yea I've been wondering about that for a while, still don't know how

rRMOve FoRtrESs!!!!!!!

AWARENESS: 100
---
The short explanation is that data packets from your actions are sent multiple times to make sure no information is lost, and then re-ordered at the global level to make sure they are activated correctly for all players in the game.
---
Shields have been in four four and a half years, lion was reworked after a few months

This looks really bad. Wtf is wrong with her eyes and nose?

No I‚Äôm pretty sure this is an intentional thing

Ok then. I will have to agree on disagree.

Then what‚Äôs the whole point of making a post on Reddit about this when you know the reason for your shit elo gain is because you were having fun with friends on RANKED

alright that's cool

For the most part I believe Mozzies gun is just pieced together although it does look like an older colt 9mm ar
---
I'm getting some Keith ape vibes here for some reason
---
Conclusive AF!
---
Because atm my skill level was a lot lower than it is now
---
So you want a failsafe for people who goof off on ranked ?when there suppose to be serious
---
Ranked map changes! Thank fuck. Get rid of Skyscraper, Hereford and Fortress. Garbage maps. Chalet is also a contender.
---
Oink
---
Well that‚Äôs your fault. You should go thought about it before you played rankedlike casual
---
&gt;basic high level aim 
---
Oh yea you know, just aim like Shroud, that‚Äôs all we require
---
So we have no reason to believe you
---
Ranked pool: pro league maps, Oregon, Hereford, fortress, outback. 
---
Good mix of variety and balance.
---
What r the odds. I just got an ace with ELA 10mins ago. Wow just wow
---
Ur mum
---
How many times is this gonna happen? You need to provide EVIDENCE. If you don't, your claim is not believable with your word alone.
---
I mean... if they designed a gun skin and the reward goal wasn‚Äôt met... why would they waste all the costs they put into it just because x != y
---
How about Castles barricade reaches the bottom of the door. Sealing off an entry point for drones?
---
Down But Not Out, so the state in which you can still be revived after being shot
---
thats pretty stupid
---
If you restart your game the re join menu should come up
---
That's a good joke
---
The lobby fest from shipping is a little longer and also put in main stair
---
Nice! Is there a com coming up because if so i need to hustle on my vigil cosplay
---
So then no Evidence. This could be bc he TKed you or got you killed. You have no Evidence, We have no reason to report
---
I just avoid ranked all together.

Dude it's the internet you're not trying to help anyone. You're trying to show how you're such a good guy.  No one cares. There is no projecting. I'm not forcing my opinion on anyone.

Sorry if it looks like a potato on some screens don't now why that's happening.

No not yours. The picture lmao

She looks so goofy. I mean seriously do they position the models in gmod?
---
I wasn't playing ranked like casual, quit assuming. Having fun =/= goofing off.
---
I get you, it feels a lot different to silver or gold, the higher your elo gets the more the gameplay changes, I'll probably never hit diamond without getting carried hard haha
---
Are you going to buy an laptop or desktop?
---
Despite their unbalanced nature I actually quite enjoy Chalet and Skyscraper. I'd rather get rid of Hereford.
---
I will maybe you know I inspired him to make it in real life
---
I up voted you for what it's worth &lt;3 Asking questions is good!

What are the barricades?

I mean, there is the Lord Tachanka one. Can‚Äôt really improve on that

Gow do you know it's for no reason?

Please

*how
---
True
---
I honestly think the only buffs he needs are faster deployment times (about 2/3 the speed it is now), barricades reaching the bottom of a doorway so drones cant get through, and being able to electrify them - they wouldn't be game breaking, wouldn't change his mechanics in a crazy way, and would still need strats to work well
---
Source - gold 1 castle main with a permenant gold-plat 5 stack
---
It doesn't, but that's a short-term problem.  They can throw placements with a smurf, but that's only going to be of benefit until their friends rank up from the boosting.  
---
If the objective is to just grief low level players, they are either going to throw matches after stomping all over people or once that smurf gets ranked up high enough, start a new smurf to do it again.

There's no perfect system, but I can't think of a better way to do it.
---
So you're saying you shouldnt be able to be bad?
---
No, just an elite controller. My movements are no where near mnk on this clip, i just have good aim.
---
I think the variety will still be there. Let's say they reduce the map pool to 10, and rotate like 3-4 least balanced or boring maps every season. Variety can still be achieved by rotating the map pool every season, at the same time providing a more refined experience. You get to work on a small pool every season, easier to master each map, also providing newer players not too large learning curve.

I guess agree to disagree in that regard.

I still hope UBI allows full five man stack to consist of any player ranks like in CS.
---
I love breaking Castle walls down with fist because everyone on my team looks at me like I invented fire lol. "How u do that?'üòÅ

You should buy an 1050ti (4gb) or an 1060 (6gb)
---
He said better
---
welp i think i am going to buy waffle cone and destroyer now just looked both up on youtube and i need to say that both look amazing ingame! 
---
thanks for your suggestion :)
---
Ahh yes, my favorite map. Tell your friend I said Thank you
---
I think the G36C would suit veeery well. It just would just look so great.

Idk if your 300 games deep you might as well try another region despite ping issues. Or play on another account .

Hello TealMoon18, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgwfcy/as_a_player_who_has_never_experienced_a_crash/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
There isn‚Äôt any lag, I promise.  I actually missed 3 knifes point blank
---
A) he‚Äôs not breaking any rule. You‚Äôre allowed to play with whoever you want. 
---
B) Ubi doesn‚Äôt ban console players. Especially for something they‚Äôre allowed to do.

Does this also fix the old bug where in killcam you see the enemy using a barbwire or c4 to shoot you with?
---
My wife left me for my crippling meth addiction
---
When I first saw this person's videos I originally felt the same way that he, and others like him, should be banned. However, I have come to the recent conclusion that while I find what he does deplorable, it is what I would consider a necessary evil. If the glitches don't become out of hand, then it seems the devs dont respond the same way, so while it ruins the game temporarily, in the long run it helps the devs and the game, especially by showing them exactly how to replicate it, along with verifying that it is duplicatable. 
---
I still think it sucks but I also know that when the clash glitch came out ranked was a nightmare, and the only way to even win some games was to do it back to the other team so you had a fighting chance, and with out that channel it may be harder for others to do that. 
---
It's one of those hate the fact people actually use it not hate someone for bringing attention to it

Really?

they did? that must be a nightmare

Pretty much

No, that was the first time after the "killswitch"

You should see the USSR bundle picture, there is no way that wasn't made on gmod.
---
No. That said, certain sites on some maps would be better off with a different operator that isn't Jager or Bandit. However those 2 are the most versatile and most important to many sites.

Oh yeah sausage and fo-12 for the win boys

Reality is often disappointing.
---
Oh yeah *Tururu tururu tururu*
---
to be fair, they didn't change the hitreg rate... it has always been 50%
---
I don‚Äôt appreciate you calling this BS when a good majority would rather have a larger map pool in general. I‚Äôm level 240 and I know a lot about every map, although, much like you, I still learn things every time I play this, and that‚Äôs just how the game is so reducing the things to learn doesn‚Äôt really solve anything when even with a smaller pool there is almost an infinite amount of things you can learn about the map. I guess I‚Äôll just agree to disagree and move on since none of us truly knows what is going to happen until the Raleigh major in August.
---
You‚Äôre a potato
---
It‚Äôs my favorite shotty in the game, praying it ends up in Quarantine
---
It sounds like they need to change the 3 lists to Casual, Ranked, and Pro.  They keep moving the Ranked list more and more towards Pro League, but I'd imagine that's now why/how most people play ranked.  Reducing maps and pick and ban should be elevated to a Pro playlist.  Ranked can keep its current "if it's not horribly broken" map pool and keep all ops so the same 4 aren't banned every game.
---
How about no
---
Where is the un-see juice at?
---
My man is moving like an echo drone
---
Ah! With that clarification it all makes sense.
---
no but i reckon if i learned how to code such simple stuff like removing the hitbox/collision of a certain object after it was hit by melee or enough bullets, i could fix this before ubi will lmao
---
Pfff imagine clash glitching on those noobs zombies
---
I like to be the sweaty tryhard, but I like to kill them more. GTA is all about asserting your dominance in every aspect of the game, whether it is pvp, money, or cool shit. People mainly use that for those who only assert dominance on pvp and not other aspects
---
Oh man, that was hilarious. Those poor enemies.
---
Your able to uncap frames from 30 if you turn vsync off on console
---
I'm willing to bet that if they could have an immediate fix they'd do it considering they have stated they know it's been plaguing the game.
---
The issue seems to be much more ingrained than you think. Most likely, the physics engine and the barricades are not working together at all. It's less likely that they're fixing something, but that they are having to completely redo the barricades. As in maybe replacing them outright with something new. 
---
Trust me, if they could fix this right now, we'd probably see a fix in a few months. But they've address the barricades since Year fucking 1. It's clear now that the barricades have to be completely reworked. And I don't mean that it's just the debris getting stuck, but other fixes could fix that debris could bring in a lot more issues. Like maybe the barricade sounds don't work right, or etc. Game development isn't as easy as making a switch. Changing one thing in the code could make the rest of the code get fucking borked.
---
Thanks for this comment made me lower my sens a hit and made playing so much funner now that I can control my shots alot Better
---
Hey I haven't seen you around in a long time. How have you been?

It can also be done on the mobile app, at least on apple.

Yeah they are adding all the siege operators so their guns have to be in there to and for a mechanic zombies whit laserbeams a semiautomatic shotty is your best friend

Hello ScarFVC, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgx29r/how_2_showdown/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They‚Äôre not going to separate the player base even more. Ranked is fine being the competitive mode. It should have competitive maps. If pro league is the defining factor for ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù, then ranked should follow suite. 
---
Everything else can go in casual and if ranked is too strict for their liking the  *they* can go to casual as well.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you go interrogate her ?
---
Then go make a AAA title and fix every single bug
---
Shit it‚Äôs every Siege op? I thought it would be a handful, everyone with their original gear will be amazing. 
---
Right ? Semi auto, mag fed, 11 shells with an extended barrel ? Later Meatbags.
---
His aim is meh on Siege.
---
So adorable
---

---
I've gotten a couple of those in casual before. It's always super satisfying
---
Im glad you agree
---
Another day, another bad cosplay.
---
I am just a guy with an opinion, bear with me
---
Between Lion and Finka, I'd say it depends.
---
Finka is a support with weak weapons (exc. SASG) and with a relative strong gadget, the Nano surge/Nanobots gives a 20hp temp. over/heal, almost 0 recoil, faster barbed wire speed (going through it) and 50% less concussion (sorry for misspelling) effects such as flashes and grzmot mines/nades. Also she get 3 of these and she has nades.
---
Lion is also a support-ish op. with a mid range weapon (the V308, no one cares about the M417 and the pump shotty) and with a somewhat useful gadget. The EE-ONE-D CAN be used for intel gather, roamer pressure, post plant defense, anti flank, but since its period was cut in half, you have to be careful with those scans. He has 3 charges and has claymore and flashes.
---
In my opinion (for a starter) you should pick up Finka. Her weapon can be easily controlled, flap on a flash hider or comp and there's almost only vertical recoil.
---
Note: she is not related to the Russian Olympics exclusion, althrough she is Ukranian and has performance boost.
---
Hope this helps
---
What's this have to do with GTA
---
If theyre worried about that, im more worried bout people in suits wearing masks coming into a con with a bag.
---
I honestly wish they brought all the maps except like favella
---
I grew up using PC but I switched to Xbox a few years ago cause money
---
Yes a oxygen
---
Outbreak was a test for R6Q, like an Alpha. Someone else made this point but they predicted Outbreak was to see player reactions as they had made so many assets which would've gone nowhere otherwise

---
Yeh consistency is key, I have a channel with tutorials for Rainbow Six Siege is you need any help. I can pm you the link if you are looking for more tips.
---
Not saying they arent capable but I imagine if every bug was as easy to fix as going into the code and tweaking a few things, these bugs would already be fixed. With a game with as many complexities as siege with map destruction, debris physics, and many many many other factors this game's code has to take into account for something as simple as a melee attack or a bullet being shot, I imagine the coding is pretty much spaghetti. You can't change one thing without affecting another.
---
That is an apparition that you see before you die.
---
ah yes, showdown has taught you well
---
I've actually died many times when scanning footprints, so yes, you do die when scanning footprints. He isn't even frustrating to play against. Dokka is way more frustrating because she can just sit in spawn and call you and you're fucked if her team rushes you when you thought you were hidden. I'd even wager to say she was worse than pre-nerf Lion because even if you couldn't move at least your position wasn't totally given away.
---
Yeah let's sue little Timmy's parents for all their money and then send him to juvie for 3 years because he did the IW glitch.

Nokk is 25k as well. Nomad is better for your team when with randoms, but Nokk is great if you play with people
---
zofia is definitely easier to use so go with her
---
He‚Äôs great for gadget destruction and the AK &amp; LMG are great guns
---
Just beware, similar to blitz, that if someone is above you they can see a little bit of your head above your shield and may hit that and not your shield
---
Yeah we are cursed
---
isnt a cosplay mostly about the outfit? why are there so many comments on her face?
---
Other than Maestro, no one is going to buy a bundle for ops that are always banned or not played. 
---
You have to remember that most of the playerbase is high silver low gold, so the cosmetics are going to be based around what ops are played the most around that level.
---
The reason why I haven‚Äôt been playing console for awhile, that shit happens too often.
---
That doesn‚Äôt make him better then valk who counter him and iq and smoke tho?
---
Yes let's ruin a damn 10 year old kid's life and their parents life because he did a glitch in a video game, if the world ever comes to that I'd rather die than be here

But the server denies something because of latency. So the server could deny input because it should be impossible to move 500m in a few ms.
---
There is hardly a trade off other than amount of recoil. These subsonic rounds are still a one-shot headshot and maintain full velocity (I'm pretty sure Siege is hitscan anyway). With the added bonus of no direction indicator or bullet trails, a suppressor is an extremely useful attachment.  
---
Try using it on Ops that will be engaging from longer ranges so the enemy doesn't know which way you are firing from. If you don't land an immediate kill, relocate immediately. Try restricting yourself to weapons with larger magazines before moving to the smaller stuff. When an Attacker, sidearm *always* has a suppressor (for cams).
---
Hello Siege fans, my name is PoSeR9 I am noob to both this community and to Siege the game. I have been very lucky to have a good teacher with many hours of experience in game to show me the  basics. I am only on week 2 of playing and about 15 hours in to gameplay so a guide of all the attackers and defenders was much needed by me. My buddy Dan sat with me and told me a little bit about each of the attackers, I saved this conversation and am sharing it with you guys and hopefully some beginners in the game can find a few tips and tricks in there that can help them get going in this game. 
---
This is just the first part of my noob guides as I am slowly learning and making the videos with Dan and FecalStorm as they teach me in game. I am currently working on the defenders guide next. If there is any questions or things you guys want to see in the next video let me know.
---
Good luck out there in your games everyone!
---
ugh, you getting downvoted shows the tensions between console and pc players. why can't we all get along under one united game and subreddit?
---
You should try it. I promise the quality will be MUCH better

Strange, Haven‚Äôt been on siege to confirm this yet so maybe someone else can check this out too
---
i tryhard a good amount, but when I die, everyone else is a tryhard. ur right tho
---
I guess I didn't really think about defense lol, is this in casual or ranked? I remember when I first started in casual people would kill me because I had to go recruit. I blasted them back with the m870 so fast lol
---
Why traps shouldn't count as tk
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
Nomad is the better OP by far. N√∏kk should be one of the last attackers you should buy.
---
Nomad has better guns and a better gadget.
---
Being correct is not pedantic. I am being pedantic, you were just correct and they were mistaken.
---
I think he ended up right next to me right before it blew.
---
Double Kill!
---

---
Only if Nokk actually gets a weapon like that.
---
At least anything that‚Äôs slightly better than a folding box glock.
---
Ubi said that she was OP with an AR but look at how she‚Äôs the second worst Attacker in the game. With Glaz being buffed, she‚Äôs gonna take the 1st place.
---
Ok I‚Äôll check it out :)
---
The pixels on this makes my eyes hurt
---
You should try being more flexible with ops. Having certain mains, and not choosing ops that could benefit your team during that round can be a liability.
---
That's what casual is for, ranked maps and unbalanced maps!
---
No it's not dude it's like wet paper
---
Is she going to sell me her bath water?
---
You have a good point and also both of them have been already nerfed. From dokkaebis calling lasting only a certain amount of time and not lasting for ever and lion from being able to see enemys outlines through everything to pings.
---
caveira
---
They simulataneously made kitchen a viable site and made upstairs even harder to attack. If it wasn't defensive sided before, it definitely is now.
---
This isn‚Äôt about what ubisoft thinks of an op, its a discussion on how to get rid of some universal ability frustration that the player based has raised. This might be a shite idea for how to do it, but I think it is worth discussion at least
---
I call hackers "Script Kiddies." It gets them every time.
---
 So they are basically sociopaths.
---
I don't know a single person that likes new kafe. It's a heavy defense sided map now and I don't think any map that is a 3-0 attack or defense is a very good map.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people are getting down voted for saying they like a map
---
*bastardo*
---
"drag everyone down"?
---
You mean 
---
"play at the rank i deserve to be in" but hey. you do you.
---
And striker fired.
---
Then it was definitely a case of unfamiliarity with the game lol, that would have been much easier.
---
Lol @ competitive integrity of a game, grow up.
---
poor kapkan
---
I mean Ubi‚Äôs own data now shows her being the second worst Attacker. With Glaz being buffed, she might take the first place. 
---
For an Operator that works extremely solo, she lacks damage and range while also not offering any utility. She‚Äôs the only none Shield Attacker who gets outgunned by majority of popular Defenders.

Open up the console menu, quit out of siege, and start it back up as quick as possible. You should be able to re-enter a ranked match from there. They will already have your IP address, so they can just as easily hit the servers again. Keep fighting the good fight.

I think this video nails why globals are BS, and I think your fix wouldn't really change that; Dokk/Lion would just hang back and use their abilities while the rest of the team take advantage of the call/scan. Sure, it would make their abilities more team oriented and increase the risk of using them, but I think it's less about how globals basically come with no risk and more about how skilled play can be completely negated with the press of a button.
---
thanks dude!

OMG! HE PLAYS WITH KB/M, HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF!!!

oh get over yourself. it's not hacking, game breaking, or anything new oh well.
---
Well, it‚Äôs all preference and opinion. Both have their benefits. I think it‚Äôs impossible to say that one is better than the other in general but in individual things. Consoles don‚Äôt have to worry about hackers but they suffer from lower FPS, controllers, locked FOV and they have plenty of scummy things such as DDosing.
---
No semi auto Glock. Full auto Glock‚Äôs have been overdone (g18 from cod for example)
---
I saw a solution of this somewhere on youtube but basically to stop people from queueing with low accounts so they can get easier players the elo of the other team they play against is the elo of the highest person on your team.
---
It went three to four and you surrendered. You werent playing actuall diamonds/plats and it seems to be a fairly balanced game in spite pf the rank disparity.
---
Attack- Dokk, sure Jackal is annoying but Dokk can truly hurt the entire team and not just a singular person at a time. The ring disables cams, gives away your position, and can't really be denied unless you're Echo or have a mute.
---
Defense- Echo, doesnt really need an explanation. If they already ban Echo then I go for Maestro
---
Beautiful
---
He is spawnpeeking with old Jager acog
---
? 
---
Nah, I just always find it funny when people shit on console players when we can hold our own to a degree of a PC player. Console play in general looks subpar to a PC player because of the larger populace or variables that create a larger skill gap due to the accessibility of them compared to varying ranges of personal computers.

The amount they've gone to now is way too much. You shouldn't be about to here a "silent torch" from across the room. The whole point of his gadget is stealth. And yes it doesn't have anything that prevents it from being used but once it's used the holes it makes can be used by either side. So it can be as much of a threat to the attackers as it is the defenders. There are multiple times I've heard it being used and had time to counter peak through the hole and get a kill
---
How dud you know?

I know it can be a bit infuriating to see such clear cases being seemingly ignored for a longer time, but companies are usually trying to accumulate information and then do a ban wave, so that the cheaters (let's not call them hackers, as they just buy something like this) in their forums can't warn eachother.

---
I defend with what ever operator is necessary for the team
---
She tried her best, that‚Äôs all that really matters
---
what other post? can you link, I only did a quick check on if someone had posted it in new.
---
Can they ddos you now without you joining there party?
---
It‚Äôs a free skin, calm down.
---
Yeah seems like everyone but me is on the winning side of these bugs.
---
Alright I'll add you later.
---
Rip, probably my least favorite legendary too.
---
If you mean by "reworking" removing it from the fucking game, I agree.
---
You said use it at your own risk, what do you mean by that
---
You also gotta buy a keyboard and mouse to use an adapter, and until recently I used a TV as a monitor.
---
Ooo defending a hacker. Dis gon be gud
---
Mate, im at 43.5% rn
---
This is only a problem in low elo.
---
Castle is an extremely strong niche operator if you play him right.
---
I got a letter from a fan that said he‚Äôs been prayin for me
---
thats good or rare i guess
---
&gt;I generalized nothing. Nor did the other person, he's right, most cosplayers are objectively *very much* "look at me be sexy".
---
I, nor did anyone else do the thing i'm about to do again! But this time, I'll state something subjective is *objective!*
---
Ease up, man - we know why these are getting upvoted and it's not the posters fault. ;)
---
They're not bullshit, the amount of times I've played matches where the servers get booted offline right as a team is about to win is ridiculous.
---
Skyscraper is actually almost entirely breachable, but you can't get in the building for long enough for it to matter.
---
no hes not lmao not even close
---
Everyone that is on the winning side of these glitches are cheaters.
---
Why use a filter?
---
shut up tactical cargo shorts

Why do people even want their alpha packs at 100%?
---
Yeah but If your gonna get a PC your gonna want to get a better one than that though. Like if I were to buy one I‚Äôd spend a good amount to atleast make sure it‚Äôs gonna be good
---
   This is only a problem in low elo.
---
Even the pros get fucked by their own castle sometimes
---
   Castle is an extremely strong niche operator if you play him right.
---
Then why does he have a really low pick rate in pro league and ranked
---
Yeah same. If no operator is needed I always pick maestro. His Evil Eyes come in handy for clutch situations and his Gun is a literal Lazer. Perfect for the matches that Echo is banned
---
I didnt mean you specifically but too many people in this sub dont understand how it works
---
Gaming thigh high socks
---
Wow this is nice man good job
---
Damn that looks good
---
Sometimes though, i use thatcher on offense as my sort of ‚Äúsecondary main‚Äù. I do the same with caviera on defense.
---
Lmao even his glasses are fogged up
---
Of everyone's headshot\*
---
I know, can‚Äôt wait for this map. It‚Äôll probably look even better when they reveal it too.
---
How can you see he is hacking?
---
Hell, if you buy used Nvidia or last gen AMD graphics, you can get a full setup capable of 144 frames per second low 60 high in 1080p right now for $500, and you can use a TV for a monitor (I did until about three months ago when I bought a nice 144hz BenQ) and you're gonna have to buy a keyboard and mouse for the adapter anyway.
---
The point isn‚Äôt ‚Äú50/50 chances‚Äù, the point is ‚Äúwhat are the odds‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat are the ‚Äòchances‚Äô‚Äù.
---
\&gt;thinking nibba is racist
---
the argument still stands that a lot of times especially with high coordination you will catch people of guard see them from the back or only their feet from a window in both cases you will more likely shoot in the foot 
---
and especially in 1v1 gunfights the one to first land the hs will win
---
if not both potatoed
---
look at 1v1 fights in pl 90 percent of gunfights will end in a hs
---
Yeah Ive never done that, but idk I see casual as a place to try strat without the pressure of maintaining rank. I mean if people want to try new pro strata in casual before they get into ranked, whats wrong with that? That said, if people are sitting in casual all day doing that, then they are better off in a competitive environment, but being such a competitive game in general i still can't get behind vilifying people for it.
---
But..... but it's the magic number
---
Clips like these make me want to play the game again,
---
Ive always really enjoyed it, have been plat for 5 seasons and even diamond for one season, but all of my friends stopped playing it, so here I am, enjoying this sub to find reason to play the game again...
---
balloons?
---
Next ash bundle:
---
Ash paying her taxes with a calculator charm
---
Thatcher is a good well rounded Op to use. L85 is good. Ability is vital but isnt necessarily difficult to use. I used to main IQ so I still play her a tad
---
They are only restricting ranked parties, not all parties.
---
these kids were being toxic to my friend so i threw a c4 in the middle of those 2 people
---
Bro i had to pee.
---
You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!

A sneak peek at the Kanal rework they revealed at the Six Invitational for those who don‚Äôt know.

Hello shnur_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgzf4f/trade_anyone/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So basically we‚Äôve learned that ash is a master baiter?
---
Flair checks ou - oh, oh wait, no it doesn't... Hmm
---
Literally in countless games the same thing happens: where the game freezes and won't fix it self until you back out. This exact same thing happens to me and my teammates, and other randomers we party up with. If it ain't a ddos what is it? Because I've posted on this issue on r/siegeacadamy there's multiple youtube videos on it?
---
You can play on the one one I‚Äôm custom games
---
Oh shit, thanks for reminding me, i gotta add him real quick :)
---
Cheers N0tAMuffin, means alot.
---
What is this, an overwatch cue?
---
Did you have too get at least 1 head shot my friend wants to know and I havent been able to play
---
That would be interesting, removing disorientation would make him way more palatable in ranked but the plant denial is exactly why he's hated in PL. I think removing plant denial would shift him into more of a fragging role which is where I think he belongs but we can agree to disagree.
---
I was watching and Im like ‚ÄúThats rook what are you talking about??‚Äù *Watches again* ‚ÄúWtf thats still roo.....oh shit a flying recruit‚Äù
---
No you cant
---
waddip my fellow frosty boi

Fellow Asian

I should do a lesion lol

...just stop the queue and restart if the timer passes the estimated wait time
---
There are so many posts like this

If you mean situations ik but its sooooo easy
---
You dare oppose me mortal??!!

*Loud chanky noises*

Disable them for Kapkan's traps. There's no way a Kapkan can intentionally use them to TK.
---
Hehe
---
But I want the smoke elite :(
---
Just shows how screwed the game engine is.
---
"Few months old"

Dunno when I recorded...   
---
Found it when I deleted my recordings
---
i wish i had that black ice for her shotgun cause it's my favorite, right now i've got it for the 9mm c1
---
Let‚Äôs agree to disagree ;D
---
This is the one black ice I want, and I despise Ash
---
k/d doesn't matter, especially when you're in bronze/silver. as long as you're winning and doing your job you're fine
---
... Wait, but then my reply won't make sense!!! Aaahhh
---
Because then the whole sub would be memes and it wouldn't be helpful to anyone. I'm sure there's r6 meme subreddit somewhere. If not you should make one
---
I feel like kd doesn‚Äôt reflect skill in r6. Its more team play and how you strategize and work with operators and their gadgets. This isn‚Äôt cod where kd matters. But ya i would say bronze and silvers have around .7 to .9 kd. I have been playing since beta and been plat every season since velvet shell and I have a 1.1 because it‚Äôs hard as shit to get my kd up after playin hundreds of matches
---
But we don‚Äôt have to live with it. Push back against these things and they go away. Like cash machine charges and needing a minimum amount of money in a bank account or be fined. We pushed back and now we have a better life
---
i'm not gonna lie. I prefer old hereford
---
In a related previous comic, someone posted a comment that the tub should be filled with shock drones instead. It also could have been another similar comment involving shock drones too.
---
I dunno how to make a reddit page that‚Äôs the problem
---
#F
---
It doesn‚Äôt look like you were attacked with denial of service of service. It just looks like your internet cut out. A denial of service attack would cut out your internet for a while. If the server was attacked you would not have got a ban.
---
Maverick
---
Imagine leaving the house
---
Pro-gamer move
---
Great name my guy.
---
But that‚Äôs a fight not worth fighting since there are much more drastic problems which need to be dealt with even limiting that on siege
---
Ah yes I remember about that one.
---
In the original post the OP said he stood in that pose for less than 30 seconds.
---
Still not a smart thing to do though.
---
Aw shut I was away, was this a new universal skin?
---
Can I still get it even though I don‚Äôt have the ops?
---
How is it not worth upvoting and saying. I agree. 
---
For them to change it is deleting a page :/
---
just know he was probably top of the top people being toxic. and that's probably why. granted there might be some accidentally banned, but that's almost impossible to repeal unless you're a popularly known in the community.
---
Not enough people hate on Consulate and I won't stand for this.
---
What is this sub I love it
---
I‚Äôm gonna love getting rushed by this /s. Jokes aside it‚Äôs not a bad bundle and the uniform has decent colors.
---
Bandit also doesn‚Äôt have much bundles
---
nope not a troll its stupid fun
---
There is currently no way to hack or mod Rainbow Six on PS4
---
depends what you like to play. they all have nice guns
---
but from those 3 i'd go mav
---
that's looks real good. Not sure if you care at this point but you may be able to get the colour you want if you stain it with some regular tea bags .
---
Yeah I would go Maverick. Nomad has a unique ability but Maverick is the most useful
---
29.00%
---
I just had this happen on coast line but was stuck looking at wall. After that round it was fine but the whole round that's all I could see
---
This has happened to me as well
---
It‚Äôs called shitty rainbow 6
---
People are gonna bitch blitz into the ground ;-;
---
Fuck
---
Far better
---
Soon
---
What??
---
I haven't played in like 3 days, what was the challenge?
