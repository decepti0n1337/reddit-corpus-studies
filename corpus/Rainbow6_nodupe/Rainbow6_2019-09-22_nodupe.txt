Wholesome and badass at the same time.
---
When Smoke or Thatcher are running for too long, they start to get wheezy, screen getting blurred and speed decreasing.
---
I think nokk and clash should be D tier
---
Frankly I'm glad they got rid of the acog on that gun. Its still insanely strong with Holo.
---
People use it frequently and ubi go for guns nobody ever uses, like The FMG-9 and the LMG Amaru has.
---
nobody ever uses Zofia's LMG or Blackbeards DMR which is why I suggested those 2.
---
Btw don‚Äôt suppress the cz75. It makes it require an extra stk and it becomes the slowest killing machine pistol.
---
#TIME TO GET SERIOUS !
---
You are the kind of toxic person that makes the siege community so shit.
---
Lesion is probably one of the stronger defenders in the game.
---
Better cpu cooler. What cpu is it? All in one liquid coolers are pretty cheap these days.
---
Or upgrade cpu
---
Just played the MW beta and had the same thought! I would love it if she had a better primary weapon.
---
Learn where rotation holes are. I don‚Äôt feel any remorse people who stand next to them and get blasted
---
The fact that you aknowledge you're sweaty already classifies you as less sweaty than you think.
---
One thing to note; I avoid putting a character in the same tier as another character that would/does completely eclipse them in most cases. Or they have something about them that makes them generally less useful than someone above them, which means that they need to go *below* that person, even if they're not that bad.  
---
So for example, Thatcher is not *bad*, but in many circumstances Twitch is the superior choice, so Twitch needs to go above Thatcher.
---
Lol XD
---
It has happened to me far too often with any bit of destructible surface, it is one of the few major bugs that hasn‚Äôt even really been acknowledged by Ubisoft and has actually seemingly been getting worse over time. I am desperately hoping for a fix because it has cost me so many gunfights and a lot of ranked rounds that would have likely lead to wins but resulted in a loss due to that glitch
---

---
It was 45 or 50 euros the last time it was on sale on the uplay store iirc.
---
It‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs about sending a message
---
Lesion all the way
---
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND TO POTENTIAL
---
If you are solo queing, it won't matter how long you wait. These things and more will still happen to you and you just have to make the best of it.
---
I feel like random rush clips like this are the best thing she‚Äôs for
---
Nice!
---
I agree with your flair. Atleast giving the special shields(Blitz, Montagne, Clash) that way they can really show off their black ice instead of just having a pistol skin.
---
Tldr
---
This is a casual game right? I cannot believe there is any group of people out there who would willingly choose to defend tower and then not have someone defending the top catwalk...
---
No shade on your efforts though, it was a good play üëç
---
Lol no where did you hear that?
---
Yeah sorta, I got dragged into a ranked match yesterday by my party tho
---
  "first 5 seconds"
---
I don't think I played when this was a thing but that's looks so good
---
You have to offset your own weakness. Don't feel safe being first in. Drone it out. Check room and c9nnecting rooms and decide the route you wanna take. 
---
Nothing wrong with anchoring. Someone should always be one or near site. 
---
Roaming is an acquired skill, that I also haven't mastered almost 900 hours deep into the game. Start roaming on maps you know really well. It'll be easier that way.
---
I'm just chilling in unranked bc it's the same atmosphere as ranked, but without the actual rank
---
This game is very cpu bound, so a better cpu will help with framerates.
---
Cringe
---
That's a cool Rayven paint job.
---
Ah yes Amaru and IQ are so similar. They are basically the same op
---
/s
---
What ?
---
Why are you standing still for a whole 5 seconds. That's plenty of time to move.
---
Yea
---
definitely
---
There are a lot of other strange things in this game. Like, why would people plant bombs in a house in the middle of nowhere with no civilians around (Oregon, Theme Park)? Why would someone have glasses that make him see through smoke while he can't even throw said smokes nor move with them? Have you ever noticed the truck in the garage on Consulate is bigger than the garage door?
---
None of this makes any sense.
---
You right.
---
It took me 800 hours in Siege to finally get a black ice that wasn't on a meme gun like the P90 or CQB shotgun. It was also the 552. I recently got the 416-C, and I literally did the O face.
---
Now die, and in the future, be a better game mode.
---
There's at least 2 Nerf blasters, Lesion has a Rayven and Echo one I can't identify but the mag is the giveaway.
---
Tell that to the teammates I've killed shooting at drones. I was on a table and hipfired at a drone, and shot an ally running past me.
---
Amaru functionally does not have a gadget in most cases, or a gadget that has an impact. So she has to rely on her weapons to make that up....and what she has is IQ's mediocre LMG and a mediocre Shotgun.
---
Functionally, unless you're really attached to the Shotgun secondary, you can take IQ, use the same LMG (or one of the superior ARs) and you'll actually A: Have a gadget and B: Some utility.
---
Ok while there‚Äôs the cluster charge
---
Those BDSM gloves
---
Yeah. Probably your cpu. I have a 970 and a i7 4790k and get about those frames.
---
put laser on that shotgun. then you dont even have to ads
---
[removed]
---
Bro that‚Äôs 3 interrogations... smh
---
The middle finger adds to the J√§ger main here.
---
Hmm you‚Äôre right
---
I still think you can put to characters into the same role if they're roughly equal power level
---
&gt;Twitch is the superior choice
---
See this is where I take issue. Twitch has a better gun yes, but EMPs are ***so*** much more reliable in the anti-gadget role when compared to shock drones. Yeah the F2 is the superior gun, but the gadget should be the main attraction, not the gun.
---
It seems like a running theme here, considering you also put Goyo in A tier mostly down to his Vector
---
He‚Äôd wear glasses that allow him to see through smoke so that in the event the attackers use it he can counter it?
---
Its not rocket science.
---
Gotcha, thanks for letting me know. I keep it suppressed so I can roam and kill silently.
---
I think this is a crime. Rook and Lesion are top tier to me, I use them a lot and they‚Äôre very good. S tier. Amaru has been out for 2 weeks so it‚Äôs still kinda early to tell what rank she‚Äôs in. Oh and tachanka in D basically means you don‚Äôt know how powerful he is. He‚Äôs comparable to Jesus so he‚Äôs in the G rank
---
That's just the game. I got 30 commons in a row before a got a rare dup. Wooh me.

I bought it on steam but installing the UPLAY launcher let me launch it on UPLAY, try that
---
But it‚Äôs a training simulation.
---
How do I upvote more than once?
---
Virtual reality training simulations. iirc in the book someone complained about all sorts of bugs and the sim causing slower reaction times and whatnot.
---
Nice
---
Here are my theories..
---
1. Your computer can not keep up with the read/write of the game. (You have incompatible hardware or your parts aren't strong enough..)
---
2. You need more RAM (I'd recommend 16GB+)
---
3. Your GPU isn't large enough for the settings you have. (It says it recommends a 2GB card, but realistically you will need a 4GB to 8GB to run the game properly on full settings.)
---
4. Your CPU is cooked or is stuttering. (Make sure the CPU isn't cooking itself or frying itself. Check the thermal paste and replace it if need be.)
---
5. Your disk is clogged with junk. (Go to Start &gt; Disk Cleanup (Admin) &gt; ALL FILES. This is a program put on your computer by Microsoft, it will delete all junk files. It WILL NOT delete anything important.)
---
6. Your Hardrive is too fragmented. (Try running a deframentation on your HDD. This could also resolve other issues if you are having any, such as slow computer speed.)
---
7. Try upgrading to Windows 10.
---
8. Try running a CMD Command (Admin) **chkdsk /scan** \&gt;THEN ONCE COMPLETE&lt; **sfc /scannow**
---
9. Update your Nvidia Drivers (Do not disable control panel, you will need it for modular settings)
---
Alternatively, uninstalling then doing a clean install could work..
---
Uninstall &gt; Reboot Computer &gt; Reinstall. (This allows the game files and the registry to be fresh.
---
Anyone else think echo had no pants for a second

The bizon would be broken op in siege no matter what you do with it. Higher rate of fire, you cant give it a slow ads and pull out time without backlash for the lack of realism, high mag size, probably low recoil for the same reason as the ads time. It would be a headshot machine. The lmgs are ok because slow movements and such, plus terrible hipfire

Guys every time i go into Unranked gamemode i get 2-3 matches in and my game freezes and crashes, is this a DoS attack to the ubisoft servers (like has been in the news) My download speed is capping at 95mbps and my upload speed is 10mbps at the time of this picture so I know for a fact that it is not my internet before I get comments telling me such.
---
Should I just not play unranked until they throw the DDoS'ers in jail? or is this another problem?
---
Nah it would have about as much recoil as the f2
---
W I T N E S S
---
considering when I was still active duty and this is what we did when we drove by eachother in the field you sir have my upvote.
---
It could be something to do with Ubisoft running out of room to make improvements to the game. They already are introducing fewer new weapons because of it. I'd hate to know how frustrating it is for the game devs wanting to make improvements, not being able to make said improvements for one reason or another, and getting trash talked the whole time by the community. Now Ubisoft execs deserve all the hate and some for their stupid decisions, just not Ubisoft as a whole. I just wanted to speak up for the devs who are trying their hardest to make this game good. I apologize if I've offended or misunderstood you in some way, I just figured another view of this matter would help.

Ah that sucks. Unfortunately the enemy team always had that one good player who carries and by my 5th placement match I was playing against silvers. Thanks for the information.
---
I‚Äôm just like you. Been playing since red crow. The game does get stale and less fun so when I feel like I‚Äôm not enjoying it i take breaks and when I come back I preform a lot better with a fresh mindset. Over the summer, I took about a 5 week break and the first game I played when I got back I got 17 kills

How can I find these files?

Those times were scary, just the slightest movement and your marked for the duration of the scan.

---
Actually she is you don't go for the objective like an idiot, you drone the objective to see if it's clear then go up the hatch, The community suggested an attacker to go up hatcges for years.

That's nice

I got a duplicate shotgun skin

thats amazing

 Is it a attacker or defender

They did this to prevent rank boosting. If they remove it they are literally gunna have the problem of rank boosting which completely ruins matchmaking and ruins the point of having an MMR system
---
This literally just happened to me lol

It should be up to the end of the first prep fase.

do you know what that word means bud?

I love the accurate toothpick on Lesion haha
---
The worst gun in the game will appear insanely good against non moving targets that can‚Äôt aim lmao
---
Ur dad should‚Äôve been lesion. Lesion legit wear khaki cargo shorts. Does it get more dad than that
---
That is precisely the bad faith argument all of you bring and it is so ridiculous. It does nothing to help the point. The point is that the MMR represents games won and not proper skill. Otherwise boosting wouldn't be a problem would it?  You can't all in one sentence claim that the rule is necessary to stop boosting and then in the next sentence claim "well your MMR is low coz u succ" - there's clearly an issue with MMR distribution, and as such restricting players who have been assigned a low MMR for an arbitrary small sample of 10 games is stupid,  because they have to now for some bullshit reason suffer alone through soloqueueing in a playerbase where every other random player ignores your attempts at communication, insults you and plays their TV through their mic. When i come home from work I don't want to queue solo or in one of the non competitive game modes. This is a competitive team game, and I get removed from my competitive team of friends I've been playing with for years automatically because my arbitrary sample size was different then my friends sample of ranking phase matches this season, but not last season. Why is it so hard for you people to understand that "git gud" is a toxic remark when the issue clearly lies in something completely different?

There's no real way to get better. Just know that mistakes are good and don't make the same mistakes. A lot of the people I see are stuck in low plat just plateau over time because they aren't learning from their mistakes. Also surround yourself with people that are better than you.

Coming from a "professional" montagne player on xbox I can confirm shields are almost unusable ADS-wise. Most of the time you just die before fully ADSing.

If PCMR is, then console even more so.

If anything clash needs a nerf. She might need a buff in some places but think about it. Clash can inflict damage while nobody can hurt her from the front. In some situations, there is LITERALLY nothing the other person can do in the 1v1, simply because they're too low on health.

And that gun! I think we need more LMGs in the game.
---
I prefer Bandit just cuz of the gun. I don't bandit trick, and whenever it's needed I just leave it to my friend/teammate to do it because I prefer to place the bandit charges then roam in spots where the enemy would try to enter.
---
Refer to the first guy that said sledge and my response, and bandit is op for electrifying goyo shields and you can put a kapkan on it, and an ADS to make it a death trap

Mp7 is a great gun don‚Äôt get me wrong, but that smg 11 man is so freaking deadly, I pop off and get 2-3 kills every round with it usually, but for bandit mp7 iron sights, is a god send for clutching
---
Back when I used to play Payday 2, not only did I want to shoot them, I would notice all kinds of CCTV cams and get anxious if I was in their field of vision &gt;_&gt;
---
I‚Äôd get Nomad, she‚Äôs all around a useful op with her ability of cutting off rotations.
---
I think alibi is one of the strongest if you‚Äôre a good roamer (weapons wise) and kaid or mystro for ability‚Äôs.
---
Melee the fuck outta that drone

It would still explode

It didn't exploded.

They‚Äôve already implemented reverse friendly fire. It‚Äôs kind of immersion breaking but it‚Äôs necessary. And no it doesn‚Äôt deter assholes. Especially if they‚Äôre frustrated and it‚Äôs their last game of the day anyway. What does it matter then if they get a half hour ban? They won‚Äôt be playing for another few hours. 
---
And I agree on the terrorist hunt thing. Sure it makes it more realistic. If you were part of a special forces outfit doing the same thing irl then yes, friendly fire would be a major concern. But when it causes problems like it‚Äôs currently doing? No. Time to take it out. 
---
I personally have never griefed my team, and these strict rules make you get punished for accidents as well. Hell I‚Äôve killed 3 team members by accident playing fuze because I clusterfucked a room, and my team decided to rush at the exact same time. It was a pure accident and I got banned for half an hour because of it. Same goes for accidentally shooting team mates. I‚Äôve been banned because, over the course of a match, I accidentally shot and killed too many team mates. I mean if you‚Äôre laying down suppressing fire on an area and your teammate runs in front of you it‚Äôs their own fault. Now when you‚Äôve got a team mate who does it repeatedly? Well you get to suffer for it. 
---
However I have countergriefed lol. Someone would do a blatant team kill at the start of a round and guess what? They‚Äôre catching a bullet in the head too. Well not anymore since reversed FF was implemented. But griefers can grief without team killing as well. Like I said intentionally blocking you, running in front of your fire on purpose, destroying your gadgets, etc etc. I feel like there‚Äôs no cut and dry solution to griefing, except for what you said. Keep a record of shitty behaviour, and then lump the players who consistently behave poorly together. Then the good players will get to have mature adult games, and the idiots will have their grief lobbies as punishment.
---
They clearly did it on purpose. Even if you assume one was dumb enough to shoot the shield by trying to shoot the drone, there was no reason for them to bunch up together.
---
The fact they all clustered together next to the shield, then shot the shield, is a clear indication that they did it on purpose
---
I don‚Äôt see IQ being high..
---
They called me a madman
---
This guy almost died doing that lol

Thank you, I'll make sure to try that.

Hello Semon-Demon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d7o7xw/anybody_elses_game_crashing_a_lot/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

What do you mean it makes it less fun for both teams?  Nothing is better for a defender on oregon than an attacker falling off the tower

No, it's normal that you can, normal, not common.

Take a break for 1 week.

Sure mate.

This is my current plan, as I think I reached my limit these past few days. Thanks man.

Nice, when you realise your wrong just insult the guy, always works.

I dont know why people think its fake, Jager was trying to deploy ADS, Goyo was chasing the drone, Kapkan was trying to deploy his gadget on Goyo shield, you can see bandit was trying to deploy his gadget too on shield before shooting the drone.

Sneak 100
---
It wouldn‚Äôt if the scope was working properly. Now I move 5 meters to hold and angle better and the scope is disabled. Then I stand still for 5 seconds before the meter starts filling up again. A travesty, I say. The only way this would work is if they put back the old damage, at least.
---
but we're not talking about idiots playing shields ... if that's the player base games  are balanced for the Old black beard with 800HP shields is not OP. plus the problem with shields is not necessarily how they are played but they just suck as a thing to balance, to make work just look at the guy dying to bullets hitting his shield.

I have the rest of legacy 20 but I just need these last 6

Thats what my friends always say he hacking he shot me thru a wall!! He has aim bot!! I shot him i saw the blood!!!

This is the most idiotic Reddit comment I‚Äôve seen in a while. Do you know what a computer actually is? If you did you would know that a console is literally a computer that is heavily modified and limited by their custom operating system. So back to your question. The real answers is that there‚Äôs thousand of things pc can do that console can‚Äôt. From the simple things like the ability to listen to any music streaming service (Apple, Tidal, etc) to normal pc applications such as photoshop, after effects, Microsoft word, excel, etc. That‚Äôs not even diving deep into installing several operating systems and listing the thousands of things each of them do. In conclusion, you‚Äôre over your head when it comes to pc. I can say with 100% certainty that you haven‚Äôt used a pc past the absolute basic level if you have at all. If you have a reasonable rebuttal I would love to hear it. If not, then I hope you learned something about computers from my comment.
---
No. It could be for someone else but for me it‚Äôs for siege.

That's probably it, I'm glad they're cracking down on ddosing but if it means we're gonna have for Honor style problems with disconnections I'd almost rather them stay. I just with ubi could fix something without breaking 10 more things.

I can‚Äôt believe this many people like zofia over everybody else which is nice I had an argument with my friend about ela and zofia I was defending zofia for being the better...operator.
---
That's cute :)

It shows the triple wall though which is quite an important area if you‚Äôre defending in fountain

From personal experience (several seasons ago) someone rappelling in will kill you, even if you‚Äôre prone. I imagine it‚Äôs the same with Amaru.

*Tachanka rework leaked*
---
I dont think there is anything actually illegal with producing and selling game cheats? 
---
Would be different if they was server attacks etc. Hell in some games the hacks/cheats are what makes those games amazing in single player. 
---
Also maybe Ubisoft has their own cheat website where they sell to wannabe cheaters for easy methods to identify them and ban them.
---
To be fair only one of them did anything stupid. I never expect my teammates to blow up goyo shields in the prep phase
---
Ash is underwhelming and limited and everyone mains her.
---
And Zofia with grenade launcher.
---
Its a decent elite, but get a elite for someone else since she is banned in most ranked and unranked games.
---
Thanks for commenting, but although I see where you're coming from here, first of all it has nothing to do with data limits. A system which uses already existing game assets will not affect the data usage of a video game. And to add to this, the customization options are a really small fraction of the data usage, so small that it quite likely wouldn't really be noticeable even if all of the assets of the system were new. What actually affects the data usage are the new maps and gamemodes, which are actually using a lot of the data, not operator models.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And as a second point, no it would not skyrocket the loading times. Think about the time when the game currently loads in the operator screen. During this time the game loads the whole map layout, map interactions, characters, animations, weapons, gadgets... and literally everything else that the game needs in the match. The character models are a fraction of this loading. You can get an image of how long it would take to load a character model from when you open your character screen in the menu. The loading time of the 3D model is &lt;1 second on a decent PC. And to the overall loading time this wouldn't affect at all. The game already loads the character models (as the game needs them in the match) so it would not even cause extra loading work when talking about the overall picture.
---
So I personally feel like this is not the reason behind them not doing it, sure it has been considered as an overall reason (every time there is a suggestion the first comments are "the data limits... engine limitations... etc."). For a gaming company like Ubisoft it shouldn't be too much of a hustle to achieve 3D characters in a selection screen. But well, you never know! :D

Contacting support does little to nothing, they just claim to open an appeal and then reply with the same script 24 hrs later:
---
&gt;Ubisoft takes a firm stance against cheating. As such, your access to your game has been revoked and will not be reinstated on this account.
---
&gt;Your appeal to dispute the ban was denied due to indisputable evidence of cheating.

---
So you know how you can sit at the loading menu for about 40 years while you wait for someone with an hdd to load in the game. Now Imagine sitting in a menu waiting for some archaic hdd to just load in so the countdown to choose operators can begin. Then you have another countdown to load in the map this time, instead of the models. 
---
If that doesn't sound like some fresh hell to you, i'm not sure what to say.
---
Yeah this is an issue. There's no way you can filter people who need to really go (like my friend today) apart from people intentionally leaving. I think you can detect if a player gets kicked because of bad internet or game crashing
---
Stop bullying him!!
---
I like the idea just change the guns keep the d50 change the MP7 to the R4 and the Spas 12 to the M870

But the weight of the gold bars would hinder the effectiveness of my pumped up kicks, and my nokk rush would be ruined. But after were done kicking booty, i would take some booty!

Change the pings so that only he can see them nerf the reload time on the c7 ( 2 seconds tactical fastest ar and faster than I think every sky except moxies roni)

Yeah nah you handled it perfectly. A lot of the snowflakes on reddit will say " Mute them, or leave" but that's called being a little bitch and letting the terrorists win. Trying to beat them at their own game is so much more satisfying.
---

---
&gt; if youre reloading there is still a delay between ads and shooting coming off of mid reload.
---
only if you would've been holding your ADS otherwise..which normally you aren't. 
---
obviously if you're holding a fucking angle expecting someone you're not going to reload for a few bullets
---
Angled grip is the way to go on console
---
The point is for you to get used to a ranked environment. Most players dont just leave the matches because the ban so you at least have a full team.
---
Missing half your shots and rapidly firing blankly in desperation while your friends pretend to be the enemy team?
---
is it me or does Ela look like Mia from pulp fiction
---
That's a separate issue. Console balanced needs to be separate, but ela doesnt need a buff across the board
---
Isn‚Äôt that the point of unranked where you can practice for ranked but without losing ranks if you play bad

Unranked has been full of sweaty low ranks who ban the same ops each time I once had an ela run out on Villa while I was logic bombing, miss three shots with her pistol before she hs me. Then she got mad when I called her out xd
---
If you are aware of the actions of someone that is deemed to be unacceptable you are just as much in the wrong. If you know someone was a murderer but didn't say nothing you are just as guilty, same rules apply.
---
ban is there to stop people leaving **intentionally**,why do you ban people that disconnect or crash in the middle of the game? crash cant be detected,but disconnection can,when you disconnect you are still in the menu and the game tries to reach the servers and servers detect your tries and answer them back.  
---
If thats the case in servers,game should be able to detect someone who dc'ed.
---
And in the midst of all its a 4K
---
Fr, you guys play on PC?

I Don‚Äôt understand what you mean his aim is god tier...has to be champion rank for sure

You duo with him.l knowing he is ddosing that's your own actions.
---
There's hidden ranking. So if you're facing low ranks maybe you're a lo.....
---
You must have intimidated the 5th pretty bad to make him quit like that.
---
You obviously didn‚Äôt have a problem when you qued with him, and I‚Äôm betting  you didn‚Äôt only play three games with him. Ubisoft is looking at matches that got DDoSed and who was consistently in them. The more matches you were in that had the DDoS the higher chance you‚Äôre getting banned.
---
why the FUCK are you playing without attachments
---
You hit him with a whole "bruh moment"
---
100 percent agreed.
---
I give up..
---
They don‚Äôt remove duplicates in overwatch. Just severely deduce your chances of getting them but I do agree it‚Äôs a good idea

Imagine trying to call out a guy who calls players sweaty over his rank, I haven't been ranked in three seasons I'm a memer. It's much easier to meme at low ranks because people are so clueless
---
Literally one of the most useless ops next to castle imo
---
The one thing I dislike is that console clips get to hot where it's straight trash that burns my eyes like someone dipping a q tip in battery acid and rubbing my eyes with it. Where as insane PC clips get less than 100 upvotes or more often than not downvoted by console players because they can not comprehend skill when they see it.

---
Well if you're gonna meme, go to casual. People in unranked are going to play it more seriously obviously. You can't get mad someone wants to win a game.
---
Cause I killed the Jager before he got to it.....
---
yeah but it not special it‚Äôs just a hole in a wall
---
Sorry but I counted it‚Äôs four kills
---
yes but im not talking ab holding an angle, im talking ab those situations where you get a kill and try to switch positions, if you start reloading, it could fuck you over if they go for the trade
---
Mid season reinforcement maybe
---
The enemies played like bronze that how I was able to hit this clip, but these was a full ex diamond game. Somehow. Honestly think they were boosted
---
Isn't this the main sub?
---
Total setup
---
Casual is where the sweaty people are, I've had more fun winning unranked because I don't need to try as hard to meme. There's a difference between meming and throwing.
---
doesnt make you a lesser gamer its hard watching console clips tho because how limited everything is.
---
No, they enemies were just extremely bad. Im pretty sure they were all boosted by DDossers
---
not my responsibility if the internet provider cuts the connection for no reason for some seconds long enough me to get dc'ed.
---
Nice shot, try your map knowledge and you'll be champion no time

Damn the only thing my dad payed with me was hide and seek when I was 10 years old. I'm 22 years old now and I still can't find the guy. He's really good!

Now just burn it to the ground and salt the ashes

Jesus this felt like something out of a movie
---
Tf they do that for?
---
Everytime I see him, through livestream interests or just random vids, the first thing I always here is "YOU PLAY LIKE A FUCKING BOT" or " x x x BOT" or something along the line of "GARBAGE". Pretty toxic if you ask me.
---
Yeah man! Isnt it awesome?üòÇ
---
Working on it right now actually! And thank you :D
---
For real dude every unranked game I play starts with one disconnect and the enemy team seeming to consist of diamonds on adderall.
---
No because I would feel guilty killing the dog
---
Guys i can confirm this clip is from a real ranked game, i was the zofia on the other team using the turret.
---
Ya I know what you mean, I personally do it to change from CUS to EUS as I live in Toronto and my ping is 25 on EUS and 45 on CUS. I don't understand why people do it the other way around and purposely increase their ping to have an advantage. It's like no one is willing to accept their rank and are willing to do anything and everything to make it look better than their actual skill level.
---
Not an excuse for bad aim
---
I‚Äôm happy they are gone tbh
---
would you mind messaging me when it is up? I don‚Äôt want to miss it due to algorithms
---
Yeah he literally does that every time he dies. But you have to realize that most of the ppl that KG plays are the same stream snipers EVERY day and do genuinely play like bots sometimes because they know KG won‚Äôt expect it.
---
But you didn't break the fourth wall
---
Zofia lol

No, this is Patrick!

No, that would mean you can see there setup and leave if you think you can't beat it to cancel the match
---
Illusions are fatal
---
I say kapkan
---
Looks normal to me
---
Also those "my wife died today so im taking off some steam by playing God of War in my mancave"-posts.
---
That‚Äôs the joke retard
---
Kaplan if it's between the two, personally I don't think either of them are good elites though
---
Fuze because fuzes mvp animation is very good
---
Who would you like to see?

Man you missed the joke

You must be the parent of one of those demon kids from The Sims

This man just tryna farm karma

üòÇ he‚Äôs actually my favorite no lie

ALL SHALL FEAR THE GREAT IMPERIUM OF MAN!!  AAAAAAGGGRHHH!!!!!!!
---
Kapkan if it's between the two, personally I don't think either of them are good elites though
---
I should add that the second round was a 4K and THEN they left
---
I‚Äôve never noticed this till now. I‚Äôm pretty sure it hasn‚Äôt always been there and i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs just a new loading symbol maybe?
---
Ah yes, make the game thats defender biased already even more defender favored. Large brain over here.

Vigil for sure his k1a and smg-12 are insane
---
Vigil
---
Not bad. Better than Smoke and IQ elite skins. Am not the biggest fan of the pallet choice, but I am not an Ela main that will be rocking it all the time.
---
How am I trying so hard? I provided what happened leading up to the events
---
All headshots. Obvious hax.
---
Remove shield nerf. i can deal with getting killed by shield players. Maybe lower  it by only 25% not 50%
---
Mr homeless
---
Depends on ur play style. If you are a team player get ying if you like having fun get vigil
---
Why did u steal this from basically homeless.
---
Yeah this is big brain time
---
Check out this Dva 6K!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You‚Äôre forgetting these are simulations. 
---
The ops are given a set amount of time to get in and kill or defuse. It‚Äôs not about defusing the bomb it‚Äôs a simulation as to complete the objective within a time frame
---
Commitment really pays off in this game
---
If you know you know
---
If you're wondering and specifically asking if there is a credit pack to buy that gives you the exact amount you need, no. This is an intentional predatory marketing strategy that a lot of (especially mobile) games use to get you to spend more than is necessary.
---
ok 10q

Don‚Äôt hate just cause the guy knows how to make the most use of the OP

That was only 4, you don‚Äôt have 5 friends lul

To educate someone, they have to be willing. without that, you're just preaching to the choir. and honestly people would be more receptive to you if you dropped the condescending attitude you appear to have against those you don't agree with.

For Kaid just use the electro claw
---
Just don't make the same mistake in romantic relationships.
---
Yeah but in siege sensitivity is more important because of there being no aim assist. Not saying it's not important in other games.
---
I won't make a mistake in a Romantic Relationship... IF I HAD ONE !

agreed /r/titlegore

How do people hear the loudass sound of the plant defusal

It‚Äôs level 30

Your gonna get 3 aces back to back then your games gonna crash on final round just before you collect your 4th

He's perfect for anti roam, that's why
---
By the time his ban is over, siege 2 will already be in year 6
---
OP ability and getting tracked by him as defender is a bitch
---
This is incorrect. Maverick's gun uses a .50 Beowulf round, not the .50 BMG used in Barret .50 rifles or machine guns.
---
the way to defend that site is to ASBOLUTELY NEVER CHOOSE THAT SITE
---
I usually see the Jackal &amp; Monty in most of my matches.

Its not a claymore
---
I mean. Yeah that's fair
---
-Personally, I would get ela since she is a hindrance to the enemy team, her grzmots stuns them and messes with them for quite sometime, giving you the advantage to jump them. The mines are also pretty loud, so you can tell which one was set off if you place all three in different locations. You can use them alert of anyone possibly flanking you as well. Ela's shotgun is an absolute cheat of a weapon, I feel disgusted with myself everytime I get a kill with it. The SMG is only worth using if you're good with handling recoil, because you need to utilize accuracy to compensate for the lack of damage.
---
-Vigil, is good to keep the enemies paranoid. Sure, their drones have that white line effect when he's near, but they dont know his EXACT location. Vigil can shoot the drones, and either stay in that location or move somewhere else. The attackers have to either risk another drone to look for vigil, or bite the bullet and be extra careful to take him down. I don't have vigil, but from what I've seen spectating my team, this is how I'd play as well. Vigil auto(not sure if AR or SMG) is very accurate from what I've seen, good ammo, shoots at the right speed(not too fast to burn through ammo and not too slow to where you'd be at a disadvantage when engaged in a fight). His shotgun is amazing, but you need to be precise. 1 miss and you're most likely done for...unless you pop thr second shot off and it hits the enemy head.
---
His ability takes no skills to use and is extremely powerful
---
I don‚Äôt see many people in gold or higher seriously using the scorpion anymore.  Then again, not many people play Ela anymore period because there are better op choices in ranked.
---
The internet is a resource.
---
The Ela elite in no way looks like Violet from Willy Wonka.
---
You can have an opinion and call it garbage, but your comparison is just completely wrong.
---
r/woosh
---
as far as i know the only counter to Jackle is a bullet.
---
Absolutely
---
Lol no, slow walking is important so no janky auto sprint. Changing buttons is a huggeee fucking no 4 years in after people have gotten used to it. For the benefit of what leaning while hipfiring it's not needed sure it changes the game but nobody can do it so it's fine.
---
Yaaaay
---
Chickens be like
---
You guys dont have to downvote him
---
Once I hit love 6 on the new MW beta I only used the MP7
---
Lol I misread that as "Society has deep impact" which I found a lot funnier
---
how does this make any sense
---
I just bought Ela but yeah thanks for writing this it‚Äôs helpful
---
I didn't say there's anything wrong with being a casual, it just makes me feel better about being bad.
---
yes very adjustation is very important in video games it will take like 3 weeks to adjust to. Also how is slow walking important.
---
Because for a lot of people he is annoying to deal with.
---
They think that u were hacking?
---
Except Vigil he looks more like a Danish Frogman
---
Cheating is still cheating. 
---
Stay on PC from now on, alright?
---
thank you unicorn main
---
But the lord said: no other gods should be created.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve seen that, on console, when interrogating, Cav stabs the attacker after you finish holding down the button, leaving you way too vulnerable. It needs to be like PC, where you hold down the button until the knife comes out of the attacker‚Äôs neck. Gives you a better chance to survive if you need to get off the attacker, and it counts almost immediately once she takes the knife out.
---
Stop I can only get so hard
---
Pc
---
GTFO.
---
you're not my dad but im not touching xbox again lol its aids compared.
---
thank you
---
"Shut up and give me money!"

---
Attacking
---
Indeed
---
Gridlock is the most usefull operator. Finka is fun for more casual plays or when you play alot of solo
---
Well you‚Äôre playing mnk on console you already know the entire community hates you for cheating on console so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Arnt you supposed to be working
---
You forgot to knife the ground at the end
---
nice
---
I also got my first ace with mira.  It was on club house.
---
He is literally stream sniped 24/7 by the same people
---
Mr. Game and Watch new op confirmed
---
Yes. Fuck this shit. This game crashes constantly. Just got an abandon penalty because it decided to shit out in the last round of a game. Fix your trash game stability and stop punishing people for it.
---
Best part is that it's only a 4k
---
Okay I cleaned it my bad
---
*Goofy Scream*
---
So does Vigil, but Ashe, Buck, Jackal, and Maverick all do it with the charging handle, unless I'm mistaken. Sure there are others I'm forgetting; hell, I'm pretty sure Jager is another that does it wrong.
---
yeah i know i just dgaf tbh. the mouse movement is so bad it shouldn't be classed as cheating, more like "slight advantage".
---
How do I double down on my flair ?
---
The more I watch the more it hurts
---
I want to see MeatyMarley do this, this is very clever
---
Having tried a xim once at a friend's, I kept playing with controller on xboy and play MnK on pc xD.
---
It feel spongy like idk, limiting and unprecise af.
---
Lesions is good and lions and smokes
---
I mean yes
---
It‚Äôs a shame, the bolt release is so cool.
---
how dare you mention art hoe and one of the greatest movies in same sentence
---
Yup, yeah it was...
---
I personal like maverick for his blow torch.
---
Isn't it a hardware ban?
---
Idk if it worked cause in my placement I was still playing gold II and I's
---
If they have the game in digital they have to buy it again
---
I‚Äôm sure him or Bikini will use this sort of thing at some point hahaha
---
It‚Äôs a crash
---
Yes please stay away from XBOX with that cheating shit.
---
Rainbow 9 siege
---
I‚Äôve got the same problem except it happens at the end of almost every game. Even happens in t-hunt but it only started this season.
---
Now you just need to be toxic to everyone and i mean EVERYONE and it will truely be finished
---
Lesion is one of if not THE strongest operator on defense. Good gun, incredible gadget (that kinda needs a nerf) and is always a really good asset to the team. If you're a player that you think can stay alive until the end of the round I would definitely pick him up to your roster. (He's like smoke, stronger at the end of the round)
---
I personally think I got better between then and now
---
This is my phone wallpaper now. 11/10
---
Easy choice, maverick.
---
It‚Äôs just casual man it‚Äôs not that serious. Dicking around is what casual is for.
---
That's only 4 though you tryna trick me ha fool nice try but not funny didn't laugh lmao lmfao lmfaorofl
---
Holy fucking shit, that's one scarry ass spider.
---
I'm not very sure in that case I've never seen that problem on PC. Have you tried restarting your computer?
---
At least nobody can vote kick you
---
Lmao good for you then, I remember my first season I had a 0.1 KD, now I maintain a 1.1 average.
---
 Now you just need to ban it from every game
---
ill carry my team to victory
---
Her elite was confirmed at the same time as Mira‚Äôs. Why is this a surprise?
---
Remember when Ela's sub was actually good?
---
Same thing happens with the defuser. You can plant just before the timer runs out, and it will wait until you finished planting or you died.
---
copper 6*
---
Hmm........ Can be done, yes.
---
Thanks I'll give it a go
---
Exactly. She was low. It happened on ranked. They are randoms and well. Why even step on the hatch when you are hibana?  üòÖ
---
That's genuinely cute.
---
So, how exactly are you going to give a massive advantage to defense, while also making it more even? Please explain, what are you going to do? Delete the entirety of defense primary weapons?
---
Looks like you need to find a better team
---
Console clips in a nutshell
---
What balances buck is the loudness of his breaching.
---
Make it silent and you have a silent rusher. You don't want that.
---
I play buck a lot. Needs no changes. He's balanced.
---
P.s. Buck's c8 is easy mode after grim sky. I've run acog even before Grim Sky buff and his gun is near-laser now.
---
Restarted the game?
---
This
---
It's been like that for a few seasons my dude
---
Yep sucking your "fun" away from you.
---
Yeah def makes sense
---
Maybe she wanted to die ü§£
---
Fuck
---
He actually can't be serious lmao, how can you not tell that was done on purpose
---
Didn‚Äôt work
---
Running a terrorist hunt with only the skeleton key is fun
---
rip loading times
---
Was this in newcomer cause literally everyone who doenst anything remotely toxic gets kicked
---
i think the solution to that problem could be that players only get segregated based on behaviour reports accumulated over a period of time (lets say 6 months). that way if one is sorted into the group of jackasses, then he has to be a jackass himself.
---
That's actually why I posted this it reminded me of my aim lol
---
Ah, ok then
---
Seems logic... But I don't knew that one. Level  
---
216 and played hostage like 4 times in my life...
---
H O W?
---
Not once in my 2 years of siege has the kick system been used for a legitimate purpose. Toxic idiots come in groups, so they either can't be kicked or kick you. It is ALWAYS the random that suffers.
---
You come back from a hard Day's work and all you want to do is chill. And you end up getting kicked in casual.
---
Kick needs to go. Casual shouldn't have any rules, even ones such as being forced to play in a squad to "avoid being kicked". Kick makes playing for chilling more hectic than playing the overtime match point round on ranked.
---
Yeah.
---
Ubi knows it is a pain yet they want it in. Dumb choice.
---
/s?
---
What about it?
---
Restart your game (at least on PC)
---
my sensitivity is at 80 and its a nice sensitivity if you find 100 too high
---
If your on xbox for to the ubi club to activate it
---
I was roaming once with a 3 speed op (don‚Äôt remember which one it was) and as I was running near the windows a wild Ash came in through the window and kicked me in the face. I was so confuse I didn‚Äôt know kicking was a way to kill somebody after playing for quite some time.
---
Same here but on pc
---
why would you do that to him?
---
BLOOD FOR THE BOOLD GOD!!!!
---
What's your problem?
---
Its really making me turned off from the game, which i hate, cus i want to play it, but crashing every 15 to 30 mins is getting so annoying
---
I also think he's balanced. I just think this would be a cool change and give defenders some more things to worry about. Especially with more push denying ops coming out like Goyo, I think giving attackers more options would be a good way to go.
---
By as usual Ubi fucked up the new patch. That‚Äôs all. And they said they fixed it for PS4, but as you can imagine. They didn‚Äôt
---
Well I'm glad we solved that mystery
---
It still is. As long as you can control recoil it‚Äôs probably one of the best defense guns, at least top 10
---
You got it! See its not that hard to understand!
---
Ok so are u on mobile
---
Yeah, Ik ik
---

---
Oh fuck no
---
but yeah I guess you could bait them out in a 1v1 if you don't get walled
---
But I wound up doing it anyway.
---
Aspect ratio?
---
Even on PC that's not how it works pal. That knife goes in and you're stuck in that animation until the real interrogation process is complete. It's identical to what you described for console.
---
That ace tho
---
get fucked idiot
---
Me too
---
Those are pretty solid picks, nomad or jager are decent picks as well, just operators that lend themselves well to carrying

I love how he made this purposely trying to look bad but still hit 4 headshots

Yea usually lesion for me

Yeah what id probs do is pass through the alibi into the hallway and get tagged a few times then sprint around back to the outside of the stairs

I know that It also doesn't work on Vigil :)

i just like how it looks Christmas themed

The problem was that it was letting high ranked players into lower ranked games, not the opposite.  He was "benefitting" from it by being able to play with his friends, not climbing the ranks (considering he's still 1000 below them)
