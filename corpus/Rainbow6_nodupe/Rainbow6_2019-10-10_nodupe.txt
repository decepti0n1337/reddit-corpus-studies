A little bit ago I was in a casual match and I was 3 stacking with friends. One of the randoms ended up in a 1v5 so we started a vote kick on them. The vote was 3/4 and the random was clutching it up getting it to a 1v1 with like 40 hp. It was looking good until out of nowhere it said round lost. The random got kicked mid clutch.

No problem just next time make a quick research on the sub.

Incredible shot doc

Top floor of Chalet needs some love though.

He did a SUPERHOT body swap

She's surprisingly excellent at punishing Bank runouts.

My advice is if it's not fun for you to play anymore, dont. I've been playing for over two years now myself and the past two seasons have been very frustrating. Theres no point playing a game that just makes you mad. Or just try taking a break and playing other games for a while.

Yup:(

At least the last two

Kanal, they made it worse.

Tachanka

Lol dude, this was nsfw what's wrong?
---
True

40 percent worth which is close to a controlling share asshole
---
Thats the best part of this game

---
What stat website is that
---
shotgun, your attack main (when he was older) took no skill and donns defense main takes no skill (other than knowing ads spots).  blitz got nerfed because of how annoying it was to try and fight him 1v1. please dont just say shoot him in the legs or throw a c4 because any good blitz/shield player can bait a c4 or know when to crouch. i agree that the ads time is too much and really shouldnt have happened but honestly there isnt much anybody can do about it.  
---
Lets all just be happy that they didnt keep the original blitz operator idea
---
Sights have nothing to do with ADS time.
---
I think it is a lot better. They made it shinier, less gloomy. More open and the OBJs are a lot better.
---
Ah yes, the classic case of "FUCKIN TIMING". Happens quite often even today.
---
SAS is 3 speed too
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone in the Siege community asked for this
---
I think basement could get a little bigger and put stuff in the other garage and like the other guy top floor needs some love
---

It's an R6 rube-goldberg machine

There is 50mil unique player, they are like 50 time less active player probably
---
MAKE A LESION SKIN WITH A FILTER MASK
---
Wait he is? Lemme check
---
Well at the time, Ranked was just casual with more rounds and tracked MMR.
---
Is there gonna be a way to watch it
---
It's an interesting story though. He also said that there wasn't any story in Siege, so I mean it was his choice though it's still interesting.
---
But I still made the idea, and said it would be useful. People disagreed. That‚Äôs all.
---
The op can just ask the shadow bot on r/shadowban
---
Assuming this comment doesnt get shadowbanned too
---
Yo, everyone forgets about Ying
---
When you do, and if it's better than I'd still say that's fair.
---
it‚Äôs the crouch knife my man
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Wow. If i was that IQ player i would have just left the game.
---
Castle buff we need.
---
I'd prefer they rework maps that are actually good before they take an unbalanced map (Hereford)  and turn it into something boring 
---
Personally the two maps I'd like to see reworked are border and oregon, I like both of them but feel like they're kind of repetitive 
---
A map that I think could be turned into something decent is chalet
---
Why would they take balls? To cave in to popular opinions and needlessly be political just to make arm chair activists happy?
---
Seriously. It's a little boring right now because I only seem to get the same 5 maps, but when I first started playing (right before ember rise) I was really excited because there was so many maps:/
---
I think you just didn't hit him. The last two bullets I think hit the wall because he was moving out of the way. At least, that's what I'm seeing.
---
I remember this post. Lots of people were being toxic about the idea, and now I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre the same people that are praising Ubi that it was added.
---
True. Maybe I'll update if it works out good and try to let everyone else know lol
---
I think you were right in thinking that there should be a place for people to learn ranked, so there is that.
---
it‚Äôs just you guys don‚Äôt have text chat
---
Favela
---
Idk could‚Äôve sworn I did
---
People like all the poor ideas on here and hate the good ones, unlucky man.
---
I agree on they take good maps and make them better but skyscraper is too unbalanced to be in this game right now
---
Yeah. A lot of people had this idea, and as for implementation of unranked, I think it's been a failure. Somehow it's incentivized toxicity and it's full of all the try hards, yet also somehow they don't give a shit, but they still are toxic about winning.
---
it‚Äôs a circle jerk i‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre being deleted
---
do all college beds look like that
---
Gonna need a lot of gu mines to fight china.
---
Lesion would kill those stupid Hong Kong terrorists, and that's a good thing!
---
Excuse me sir, ain't ranked just advanced casual?
---
1050 ti gang

And Ying too

This would make a cool linework tattoo

I aint afraid to shoot that dog if it lets me get out of gold. Modern warfare 2 trained me for this moment

They recently increased the brightness across all maps to help fix this

Why the fuck did you say "hi", Mike?

Ohh, ok thanks

Shut the fuck up eurotrash  you probally like killing jews and gypsies you racist piece of shit
---
Why tf his eyes look like levi‚Äôs
---
Yes, this Tom Clancy licensed game isn't political.
---
Woooooow, calm down, mister
---
Why doesnt it say "you have been detected"
---
So essentially, they told 5% in a hope that when they sell it years later they can turn it around for a profit over what they bought it for?
---
Jesus, how many social points for that comment?
---
Meanwhile blizzard bans players who dare oppose pooh the bear lmao
---
Lmao i love it when you can tell how old someone is based on how they word their comment.
---
Get rid of one of the garage doors in big garage and make it a site with trophy room
---
Doesn't seem worth it when anybody can do her job better. IQ does her job even better, because rather than getting past Intel, iq takes it out of the equation. As said by some pro, if you want to be silent, crouch walk.
---
Cus she‚Äôs like Fuze but boring. If I can‚Äôt commit a warcrime with my gadget, then why have a gadget at all?
---
I'll get the last word, you pricks
---
Siege still isn't released in China.
---
Ooooooh me like
---
Na
---
It‚Äôs not a preference thing. For HK and Taiwan we use trad., while China and Singapore uses simplified. A lot of hkers even started calling simplified as ‚Äúdisabled Chinese‚Äù to mock China for needing to make an ‚Äúeasier‚Äù version of Chinese for the people. And due to the influence of Britain(motherland that left ;w;), a lot of terms will be affected. Like with chocolate, in written form we write it as ‚ÄúÊú±Âè§Âäõ‚Äù since in Cantonese it sounds like ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù, while in China they write it as ‚ÄúÂ∑ßÂÖãÂäõ‚Äù. Or tuna, we write it as ‚ÄúÂêûÊãøÈ≠ö‚Äù while they use ‚ÄúÈáëÊßçÈ≠ö‚Äù.
---
For partner we will use ‚ÄúÊãçÊ™î‚Äù while they‚Äôll use ‚Äú‰ºô‰º¥‚Äù. For taxi it‚Äôs ‚ÄúÁöÑÂ£´‚Äù(and I forgot what they used), etc. And that‚Äôs just a handful of examples for the written part, I haven‚Äôt even touched the part regarding actual Cantonese and it‚Äôs word terms.
---
The GIGN is part of the gendarmerie which is military.

Guess I wasn‚Äôt as clever as you with a caption lol
---
Boys, we found a contender to Goyo for the newest member of the "civilian casualties are acceptable casualties" squad
---
No problem man! Good choice too lol
---
Why though? Do you have somewhere to be fifteen minutes after you start a match?
---
TOWER
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm sorry, but no other map is as broken (Not talking about Bartlett or Favela)
---
They're Gendermerie, which by definition are military who act as law enforcement. They're police with military level training and organization.
---
Sorry, can't see you behind that big wall of text you built
---
Correction, "crappy editing"
---
No I mean you are cigil...  outside... but you arent detected
---
Ubisoft is partly owned by Tencent. Not going to happen.
---
Well, how about shut up.
---
not that im aware aware of. is it the launch operators too or just the dlc ops?
---
Great idea, Ubi should *absolutely* pick the trendiest political topic and pander to their audience in the cringiest way possible. Nothing says "fuck you" like being able to purchase some virtual cosmetics.
---
Business decisions made by literal children (read: rook mains) are always infallible.
---
LOL at everyone who has a problem with a dog in R6S but had no problem mowing down attack dogs in COD ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I found the right cheeky spot

Most likely, unless there were other negotiations between Tencent and ubi
---
Your English is on par with a 10-year old.
---
Unless they have thermite and thatcher
---
IF the flashes even work.*
---
I honestly didn't know what it stood for. Also it also stands for a dangerous chemical if you only typed PCB
---
There's a zero percent chance that either operator, who are now part of an international squad composed of teams that are technically enemies but still expected to work together to protect civilians, are on the side of the civilians.
---
Yea ok there buddy.
---
sex
---
"Go rogue" again why would they go rogue?
---
In what situation do you believe that a Hong Kong protester supporter would go rogue from an anti-terrorist organization, unless you thought Hong Kong protesters were terrorists...?
---
Cops and soldiers do what their job is. Uphold the law.
---
So why would cops go rogue if they supported lawful peaceful protests...
---
You see what you're implying?
---
What's wrong with console man?
---
well, communism as an ideology is good
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous to compare the ads animation to the pick/ban timer, one affects balance and the other doesn‚Äôt 
---
So you feel rushed by the current timing of the pick/ban and operator picks?
---
i don‚Äôt really care for news especially blizzard i haven‚Äôt play any of their games. i was just asking what happened to them calm down bud.
---
thank you and that‚Äôs awful
---
Because it's like the UN, but functional.  It literally involves people who should be enemies protecting each other.
---
It isnt quick tho
---
Don‚Äôt we all love being exposed to dangerous chemicals? I sure do!
---
But would you kill a dog?
---
The last thing you see before death.
---
They did at one point for like 2 seasons then changed it when they removed starter edition
---
It's complete horseshit.  Ubi was going to make a *separate* version of the game for China which featured chinese mandated censorship.  It would have run separate from any other servers, essentially in its own little bubble.  But the fact that China demands weird censorship and that said changes got posted online got everyone butthurt even though the version *was exclusively for China*.
---
Except r6 siege is so sjw it‚Äôs been getting tarnished with these latest updates.
---
Ah, I remember seeing the Ying one which is the same as the other shop from [this person on twitter.](https://twitter.com/Kaipo_Rozwolf/status/1181655365018095618)
---
Proud of u for using a diff mask tho and for starting the trend. Gotta hope for some shit like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dffh96/someone_drew_this_hong_kong_mei_and_asked_me_to/) üôè
---
My friend with a 1070 says my 1050ti is terrible but imo it‚Äôs better than like most 1060s and it‚Äôs extremely cost effective

That in unacceptable and terrible, no matter what publisher / developer.
---
&gt;100% in riot games
---
* X) Doubt
---
My mom works for RIOT so I *highly* doubt that one.
---
Honestly I am fine with 2 minute queues as long as I don't have to play chalet, and get to play house and plane and themepark. Plane is by no means competitive but it is easily my favorite map. So much rushing and no bars held, recruit runout potential, you can hide in stupid spots and break hatches and land on people. It's the epitome of casual.
---
Not if you have a diamond pickaxe
---
&gt; Dude Ying is so much more fun, cook a Candella so it goes off immediately when you throw it, and immediately throw a second one right after so it goes off as the first one ends.
---
&gt; It's like 10 full seconds of being the only one able to attack in a room
---
.... you‚Äôre a gosh dang genius!
---
Where did you get the PlayStation buttons thing
---
Some cops support the liberation of HK. But just like nazi soldiers who supported the allies, orders are orders, and disobeying yields consequences
---
&gt;be an idiot
---
Taking a stand for 66% of a country being willing to not go to work and physically protest for change in their country against tyranny is being an idiot.
---
&gt;idiotic things you are too lazy to make an effort
---
Again, 4 MILLION people are making an effort in a city of 6 million.  Ubi selling pro-HK protest merch would be *huge* PR boost and support.  Especially when Ubi doesn't even *have* siege in China.
---
console player?
---
Honestly part of me wishes I watermarked it because I know the instagram pages are gonna leap on it, but freedom for hong kong and the rest of the world means allowing people to share it with no limits, their own freedom over these shops.
---
I just hope I am remembered as the one who enabled others.#

Hope this is a time where our two subs can work hand in hand as I know we've all had troubled waters before.

Yes thank you

It's been over a month and you still don't know anything? Wow.

TL;DR Hong Kong has been protesting against China and China is getting increasingly violent against the protestors.

It's always better to EQ down to avoid clipping, which is what I have done, but the max volume is still more than enough for me.

Blizzard votes to ban him in ranked

&gt;little
---
You mean the movement of an entire city-state of 6 million people.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what happened, his game froze and he rejoined when the timer hit 0 to pick your operator.
---
How often do you think a guy who works for a special police taskforce would be able to get away with disobeying orders before they stopped being allowed to keep their badge?
---
How long do you think self same cop would last if his social media had pro-protester posts on it?
---
How long do you think that same cop would last if their boss told them "we're dealing with armed protesters, use live rounds" and refuses to fire, putting his team mates in danger?
---
What happens when upholding the law *isn't just*?
---
Exactly. I keep telling my friends the candelas are so they dont go in the room and steal my kills.
---
True true.
---
There are protestors in Hong Kong against China and it's getting pretty heated. Technically Hong Kong is it's own country, but China claims it's part of, well China. So basically revolution against China even though Hong Kong isnt part of China. It's a bit confusing and I'm not super educated on it but 1 things certain. Fuck China and fuck communism, GO HK
---
I have tried 4:3 and It grants relatively the same feeling as 3:2 but it feels weird to me. I agree with the FOV though, I have mine at 84

"It will sting a lot."
---
Sorry, I wasn't as clear as I should've been! They weren't playing Siege so they were just talking about whatever. I had joined voice chat with them because I had wanted to talk to them. I probably should've muted when it came down to 1v2, but it didn't occur to me to with the time constraint. Definitely not their fault, 100% mine.
---
*confused screaming*

Dont care if you won, don't be an asshole.

Just another step toward plat

Idk but can somebody photo shop an rtx 2080 to on that

Some people are just like that I guess they should add where you have to supply a reason why you vote kick them like 
---
‚Ä¢voice abuse
---
‚Ä¢greifing
---
‚Ä¢cheating/hacking

‚Ä¢they one annoying glitch where someone joins halfway into the match and it won't start until that person leaves or gets vote kicked
---
‚Ä¢AFK/idle

A/C Unit
---
Nah it isn't, the lore implies the matches are simulation exercises of team rainbow to get ready against the white mask terrorist.
---
Maybe they should be more aware . I‚Äôm sorry for actually doing what I‚Äôm supposed to do on defense .
---
You're right. Should be in class "Rush to pick or you will never get to experience joy".
---
I don't know whether to sympathize or be mad that you out here getting black ice duplicates lmao
---
See now you've got the right idea.
---
Â¶àÁöÑÊàëË¶ÅÁ¨ëÊ≠ª‰∫Ü
---
Also, if I lower my sens I'll probably have to go back up again because I tried and it's just very unplayable. 400 dpi is just... no.
---
I find it boring tbh. Makes defending too easy and if your the one getting spawn peeked, you just have to sit out the match.
---
No no. If you believe in the p90 the p90 believes in you. That‚Äôs the only effective way to use it
---
I thought holding the RB was actually increasing the delay before it goes off
---
Ëß£ÊîæÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø
---
Everyone has different opinions about this, but for me it makes using sights like holo and reflex 10x easier to see with at long range.
---
He‚Äôs correctly pointing out how supporting unjust laws makes you a bastard. Since cops jobs are to support all laws, including/especially unjust ones, they too are bastards.
---
Every lawyer worth his salt will tell you don‚Äôt talk to cops because they are constantly trying to find reasons to arrest you. The tickets, fines, court dues and prison slave labor generate revenue for the state so the more people they can ring through the system, the more money they can generate. 
---
Cops don‚Äôt get to avoid broken window policing, arresting people for minor drug offenses or anti-protestor duty. Those laws are unjust and supporting them makes you a bad person.
---
&gt; and an insult to every LEO
---
That's the point, mate. 
---
Every cop is inherently a piece of shit by virtue of being a cop, completely independent of Lesion and the Hong Kong protests, but I'm sure you're aware of that.
---
So laws should only be enforced based on someone's subjective morality? Not the will of the Government that puts them forward?
---
That's a pretty good theory. I did notice that it flagged him as DBNO before subsequently awarding points for the kill. That being said, I think we're at the point of nitty-gritty detail that's makes it hard to discern what exactly happened without knowing how the server prioritizes various actions.
---
Don't want to see it, don't look. It's not like you got a flashing newsticker ingame, or you can't ignore/filter posts.
---
They actually just implemented a system that gives the system a 50/50 chance to give either attack or defense for overtime. It's the same for the beginning of every match too.
---
That is a disgusting angle.
---
OK so how would you enforce the law? Collect criminals and the like?
---
... You... You realize Chinese people exist *outside* of China right?
---
I can't deal with this comment in my tired state. This is sarcastic right? Right?
---
Who cares about the lore when there are blood effects, characters falling from deadly heights, live grenades being thrown etc. It‚Äôs a video game, the whole thing is a simulation. If they feel the need to make sense of the multiplayer that‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs what drives people to play the game.
---
What braindead employee suggested that.
---
Im happy you‚Äôre removing the low effort posts and keeping the good ones. Thanks mods!
---
I thought there was no dbno if you're the last operator, unless it's secure area.
---
Jesus, I am saying she is a person who can take care of themselves without people being offended on her behalf. Take a chill pill.
---
Renown booster grab a full squad with renown boosters activated and  be tryhards in casual each win in casual had 500+ renown iirc do this for a few days
---
Yeah it's a little nostalgic I know. But the maps are still on the game there just not being used anymore so I don't see why it would be too difficult to do it
---
This video made me feel happy and angry at the same time.
---
Good mod
---
Well then lets not do it then, because now we are talking about two streamers on a public chat.
---
players who say ez are typically the worst skill wise from what i've seen..
---
This happens to me on a regular basis. Just restarting the game usually fixes things. It's been a bug in the game ever since i started playing last year
---
That‚Äôs a bad excuse other esports games don‚Äôt do that. You don‚Äôt have to be a know it all brotha. Things can be changed look how different r6 is now from 2015
---
Based Ubisoft. Thank you!
---
Chanky saw the meme and wanted to try it out for him self
---
Thx
---
If you go to settings, then customise controls/key bindings, scroll down and try to find push to talk, if you see a key next to it that‚Äôs your push to talk button, if nothing‚Äôs their then click on it and press what you want it to be.
---
nice job
---
I'm not being a know it all the fuck? You asked me a question and I answered all parts giving my opinion which others hold. Don't give me a question and not expect me to answer all parts in full. That's not how things work
---
Tachanka "go forth comrade dog"
---
Blackbeard:  *in the background* "has anyone seen my dog"
---
Oh yeah, this is big brain time
---
You‚Äôre missing the whole point. Sure she is a person that can take care of herself. The fact he is a face of the game for Ubisoft and condones this behavior is unacceptable. And on top of that he‚Äôs a Twitch Partner. Letting something like this just slide is not ok. It needs to exposure. No way this guy should have any affiliation with Ubisoft. Oh and on top of that he‚Äôs been banned on one of his accounts for toxic behavior. 
---
So no don‚Äôt tell me to take a chill pill. Hold people accountable for their actions instead of letting it slide.
---
And people call ela toxic.
---
Thanks for the heads up ü§ô
---
&gt;ruined
---
Please.
---
I‚Äôve had push to talk set on my mouse button since i got the game (about 2 years ago) and it just stopped working. I changed it to a key on my keyboard but it still doesn‚Äôt work
---
He was also trained by the SAS, and working with an international organization might rub off on him and ying.
---
Hol up
---
It always depends on your teammates. Lion and dok are very situational, so playing with a good team can really help.
---
I mostly play duo cue
---
Damn dude, can you stop being so mature? You're making us others look bad! Haha
---
That's a lie
---
Same here. 500 hours in the game and I don‚Äôt think I even have 3 legendaries. I have like two rare gun skins, a shit-load of charms, and a bunch of commons and uncommons. I swear the last 8 packs I‚Äôve opened have been all commons.
---
Wby then the RNG gods must have been blessing that stim pistol.
---
When in game, it refers to the defuser as a bomb. No matter what side your on, the mission announcer paints you as the ct, and the enemies as the terrorists
---
266 is in line with the 300 post buff.

win
---
I don't get it, why would that scare the crap out of you?
---
oh shit im retarded

**YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED**
---
Fuck China
---
Am halfway there. How long have you been playing?
---
match point on round 3, its casual.
---
With nook she's a counter Intel for defenders and its easier if you destroy cams and use her as a support Operator
---
Milosh casted with Mzo last week
---
Yeah, and since the AK and PKP share the same MVP pose, I think it fits the PKP much more than the AK.
---
What a waste of time. Just like this was. I am sure I am not the only one that feels like a dummy for clicking this.
---
So why did you think he quit?
---
None of the packages come with the base ops but all of the base ops are SUPER cheap so it wont take you long to get them
---
Remember when Ubisoft almost sold this game out to the Chinese last year?
---
Nice
---
When i want make knife fight always there is a dumbass who start sdhooting at everybody
---
Something along the lines of "of coarse you've got bad aim, you're playing on console"
---
If i correctly understood you, you dislike the noise made by nokk's gadget compared to Caveira who does not make any sound.
---
The thing here is that Caveira uses a skill not a gadget. Nokk is like Vigil, she even got a similar sound effect on her gadget. The sound you are hearing is most likely from the gadget which makes you invisible to cameras and dampen the sound of her footsteps.
---
If she is going to have both abilities, she should have small cons like that making her difficult to use.
---
Although her guns are not the best for stealth missions, if  Ubi had given her unique weapons then tune her during test phase she would have been *perfectly balanced like all things should be*
---

Lol, I always have to cringe when i see ACAB on Reddit.

It's so pathetic and immature.

Keep on being edgy :)

I played some rounds this way and I think it's way too much intel at that point, and not enough support/firepower to be actually effective, let alone the fact that you have no traps. It's a fun thing to do in casual tho

Complete opposite for me, feel like every flash that hits me completely blinds me for a good few seconds. Gets especially annoying when people yeet all three at you

You could just be playing with bad teammates but there is no way that you play good and you stay in copper. I would believe if it was silver or something

There is already night time in casual and if you want to use night goggles you would have to play a dark map. I see it as a useless thing. It's not that cool and it's basically green rainbow nothing special.

It happened to me a few times (i leave the drone and when i go back its outside). Another thing that happened is that i captured the drone but the attacker could still move it until the prep phase ended

i hate all the music that plays during a match. especially Rock Nation. my brother actually downloaded it and plays it whenever i am driving just to piss me off. feel like kicking his ass out of a moving car.

Oh look, another ‚ÄúJackal OP‚Äù post. Where all the haters have been when Jackal was just released?? I distinctly remember that his gadget was regarded as weak, and even back then heavy roaming was a thing...
---
I started back in 2017.
---
How? Making him completely invisiblev
---
I dunno man, started playing on Blood Orchid and I hate him ever since
---
Still doesn't beat the MW3 akimbo animation, maybe unrealistic but it was cool as hell.
---
Cool. I started this year.
---
Yes
---
how it feels to lose 3 ranked games in a row
---
I don‚Äôt hate any operator in Siege. Maybe a small bit frustrating to play against Cav, but definitely not because she is OP or smth...
---
No letting him shoot while he's cloaked so he can actually be useful
---
It says you are Nomad right now (good choice btw)
---
Yeah I think that would be fair. Nokk doesn't create an effect on cameras when she's nearby (only Mozzie's and Echo's I know), Vigil should be the same way
---
It‚Äôs an unnecessary buff nevertheless. Vigil is in a good spot.
---
‚ÄúHibana has literally one of the easiest recoils to control in the game‚Äù I say as I shoot a cutout of the enemy. But tbh if you seem to like anchor go for Mira as vector op and good gadget
---
The chinese playerbase would probably be larger than the rest of the world, so i don't think your 75-25 statistics are correct
---
Except that Doc can only affect one person, within his sight and within range whereas Finka is ‚Äúlol i press button‚Äù. 
---
Flashes and smokes can also be countered and played around easier than ‚ÄúDont move‚Äù. I can avoid a flash. Jager can help. A smoke grenade hinders both me and the enemy. Lion gives an entire team almost complete confidence if they want to take a room.
---
&gt;The city was loaned to the British for 100 years
---
That's not true. Hong Kong was ceded to Britain "in perpetuity" (meaning forever) in 1842. The 100 year lease (which was actually 99 years) applied to the New Territories. 99 year leases were the longest leases allowed in most common law jurisdictions, and Britain only agreed to it to allow the Chinese government to save face. Both sides assumed the lease was symbolic and that the New Territories were effectively Britain's forever.
---
actually that thatcher wasted all his chances at killing clash, clash is so easy to kill once you melee her even if she turns left, as you can see from this video itself, even turning left many times, thatcher still managed to shoot her foot a few times.
---
his accuracy was the one that cost the round.
---
He killed you
---
THANK YOUU
---
That third kill was pretty nice
---
Casual sure, but ranked will have way to long if a que time
---
The Holocaust wasn't the only bad thing happening in WWII. Any Wehrmacht soldier involved in "anti-partisan" efforts almost certainly took part in the murder of civilians, and the goal of the Eastern front was the genocide of Slavic people. Just because they weren't a concentration camp guard doesn't mean that a Wehrmacht soldier wasn't guilty of war crimes, and a lack of prosecutions doesn't mean a lack of guilt.
---
Or that Goyo isn't for 30 min banning players who   teamkill by reinforcing next to a shield you totally didn't place there on purpose...
---
Blackbeard is a fundamentally broken operator, whether he is OP or not isn't the question here, no other operator has 100% accuracy while not being able to be headshotted. That is a crutch and fundamentally ruins the game because he gets a whole 3 lives while every other op shot in the head loses on the first

so I guess US polices have the right to intervene and shoot when they feel justified but hkpd intervening on a full blown riot without using any kind of lethal force is not okay.

"look at pro league" don't use that in that future, basing your arguments off what pro league do it terrible.

Nerf more like.
---
It's my first time playing on mouse and keyboard
---
I think it be cool to have an operator like this he gets one drone and a good boi who works like a drone but has an attack mode and it can only down the enemy and then the dog will sit there like a drone. How you defend against this is just like In a call of duty campaign if your attack by the dog your put in an animation to fight for your life you and the attacker will have to button mash to kill the defender or to put down the attack dog. Know I know some people wont want to put a dog down but that's why this is an idea I just think it be unique. Anyone else agree?
---
q/e spamming, poopy enemies and the ELEPHANT skin?! Smells like a smurf! &gt;:(
---
Doubt.
---
I laughed so hard at ‚Äúlol i press button‚Äù
---
Not bad :)
---
Yeah, you're doing pretty well I suppose.
---
They‚Äôre fine to play against since most people just dont know what to do with then effectively, but saying they arent a crutch or that their ability requires some skill is just dumb. 
---
They require the least amount of effort or skill to be one of the most effective Op‚Äôs in a match.
---
People say a good blitz is still useful, but it is just because they're 'good'. An operator shouldnt be nerfed because somebody plays him well.
---
If he is that op than explain why his pickrate, winrate are so low and why do pros never pick him at the league.
---
you couldn‚Äôt have told me earlier????
---
So you want Ubisoft to capitalise on the current situation in Hong Kong?
---
The attacker and the defender will have to button mash*

Absolutely nothing it's fucking godly

No lemme give u an example if you mix baking soda and vinegar and it exploded as it does doing it again and expect something's gonna change is crazy now if u do something and fail u wouldn't do the exact same thing again you would try something else

Don't play ignorant dude, you know damn well the report system is for PC, I promise you they've never taken a console cheating accusation seriously simply because on console it's a different type of cheating and not the standard wallhack.

That clich√© got repeated so many times. Has it convinced anyone to change their mind yet?

The ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù falls apart in practice because repetition is crucial for improving technique.

Im at low plat and didn‚Äôt got a single one. That‚Äôs sucks hope that they get ban and you get your elo back.
---
Dope
---
I think they just try to keep it professional and talk among people they're closer with.  Sledge and Thatcher, for example, are best mates and probably share similar views with Thatcher being more hardline conservative ala Margaret Thatcher.  In that sense, they probably do talk about it a ton - on and off duty.
---
At the least, Thatcher talks about it enough to butt heads with Clash, who has a background as a left wing activist and is outspoken about her views.
---
Did I say the report system?

dunno if Siege does this, but i've heard of other games giving a decent penalty to a hidden rep score for someone who gets vote kicked, but also giving minor penalties to the people that vote for the kick.
---
The logic being if you're constantly kicking people, then its likely you're the asshole.
---
i think its a good idea to buy and build a pc. idc about what happens on console
---

---
no casual is up to 3 ranked is up to 4 unless you go to overtime.

How about Jackal?
---
Are the all similar solutions to this one?
---
finka
---
FMG-9 is the most fun ever, and such a rarity.
---
Cav isnt op. She is there to punish stupid people. If that ash decides to rush she will be taken out and the team is punished for her actions. Its a way to force the ream to work together because if they dont, well I will be the mvp that game. It may be an unpopular opinion but i think she is one of the most balanced ops out there. As a cav main yourself you should know that she is almost useless if the team starts to drone more. Her main weakness is intel even a slightly coordinated team can take down a good cavvy. In short no she does not need nerfing or fixing. Shes a noobstomper if you dont like cav drone more, communicate and stick with your team
---
Just get rid of clash already
---
I was thinking the same thing. This seems like a massive security oversight. I'm sure in some countries it's a bit less risky, but still.
---
Ohhhhh thx, never played ranked so dunno, but thank you
---
That statement ignores my whole text except the first line. Thank you for your time. Really appreciate it!
---
Task failed successfully.
---
Ban clash, ez
---
Jackal SMG is way more op than the fmg9
---
FMG9 irl can do that actually
---
BTW I have one and have had the option to use a second Simultaneously and it is most assuredly possible to do that. Perhaps a little easier if you don‚Äôt flip them.
---
Apologies. I assumed that is what you were getting at haha. But even with that, I'd probably have to disagree. It is an advantage, sure. However all of the op abilities are meant to be.
---
I have been killed several times by just about every op on here because their abilities gave them some advantage over me at the time and they used it. I feel like for the most part they've done decent with keeping the ops balanced imo.
---
I think it was either before the protests or before they really got bad, but I'm not sure.
---
Tis indeed, like bandit mp7
---
That‚Äôs not a place for a double Mira
---
So I tried it multiple times and some friends and for each and everyone it worked, so I guess its the best solution by now till ubi fixes it.
---
Regarding your argument stating that Cavs ability is quite similar to Lions, well sorta. 
---
In comparison to what Lions ability was, and still is today it requires a ton more risk with Cav than it did with Lion. All Lion had to do was to press a single button and he'd instantly get wallhacks, whereas with Cav you have to actually find someone, down them and then go through the painfully long animation for the interrogation where the attackers have plenty of time to kill you.
---
In other words, Cav's ability is high risk, but the reward is good, whereas with Lion there's no risk involved, you press a single button.
---
The reason Cav tends to be banned is more the fact that she's annoying to deal with, not so much that she's OP. She's quite strong in lower ranks, but when you get to higher ranked players / teams you're going to find that said teams are a ton more coordinated and they tend to manage to take out Cav fairly early and/or will take her out prior to a interro going off.
---
Well idk. It‚Äôs a little crazy that I can get two tapped as monte in the shin and I‚Äôm down.  I think they definitely need to make the damage output similar to other pistols in the game or shrink the mag size.
---
Not all heros wear capes
---
Its a good attempt!. Id reccommend layering it with green and letting that dry, then do the white parts then let dry and then do the lineart. Also a little paint goes a long way
---
Clash is why I quit for a few months.
---
That has happened with blitz too
---
I literally turned around and headed for the door when blitz flashed and i got flashed surprisingly
---
It‚Äôs so good to see, doesn‚Äôt matter if real or not.
---
Sorry misunderstood that. Kinda similar, I uploaded each one I found. Every solution is mostly just a meter away from the radio.
---
Was waiting for his team to kick him as they always do
---
Thanks üòä
---
It‚Äôs me hahaha, check my posts if you wanna see it.
---
Yeah I actually wrote it wrong so you‚Äôre not at fault haha
---
I did white parts then green then black
---
Alpha packs 99% common duplicate. I gotta say the worst feeling in the game is getting a Legendary Duplicate. Ya know something shouldn‚Äôt let you get a duplicate at all especially when they add new legendaries just bout every season. Then ya spend that currency from the duplicate just to get another duplicate.
---
Cav forced players to be careful and have good communication. If there‚Äôs a cav on the enemy team and your team is not coordinating at all or not droning at all then she‚Äôs extremely strong. when you‚Äôre about to be interrogated, she becomes a lot weaker, especially combined with the pistol nerf she got. Not to mention having cavs interrogation thing start can easily be used to bait enemies, just like people do with jackal. 
---
As for Lion, his ability was with a single keypress whereas cav needs to successfully down an enemy and interrogate them without being killed herself, which is considerably harder. Cavs whole thing is a risk/reward gamble. A cav player takes the risk not knowing weather or not the enemy team will be good enough to properly deal with her, and the reward is an interrogation. If you take your time, drone her out, or communicate. Lion is able to get into obj then use his gadget, fucking over any roamer trying to get back into site, along with use of a drone essentially means if you were droned out and lion used his ability you were dead. 
---
Cav isn‚Äôt picked in pro league nearly as much due to the fact that pro league teams have good communication. If there is a roamer, especially cav, the team will use resources to eliminate them before continuing onto the objective. Having someone run up behind you in the last 10 seconds while you‚Äôre trying to plant is what they get to prevent by doing that.
---
If you play Ranked, definitely Finka. In my experience, Clash gets banned a lot in ranked
---
#SMONKE
---
He definitely could have but as long as the clash had at least 50 iq points he still would have lost. Clash is stupid. As long as the clash doesn't throw, 1v1s are virtually unwinnable against her
---
Honestly, the shield melee down doesn't even help 95% of the time. Only helps in the 5% that the teammate of the person i downed just happens to walk around the corner like Chris Hansen or people just happen to be in a squad and can run halfway across the map somehow in what feels like 5 seconds.
---
 Sure I guess they wanted shield melee kills to feel less frustrating but shield melees feel even more frustrating now that ill get people that BM or when I get downed my squadmates are dead or engaged with another person and when there are randoms they are off dicking about with their heads up their asses doing jack diddly. 
---
Ubisoft why did you nerf the shield melee? It only makes shields feel worse.

No i mean paint the netire canbas green and let dry. Then pain the white over where it needs to be (outline in pencil if it helps before hand) and then let that dry. Then add the lineart. Id also reccommend using an array of different brushes for different details.

I always get nailed in the head through the shield when I do it.

Agree but she isnt that good to face in solo qeue^^
---
I just want to play her again but shes banned all the time. I think without any change to her that makes her less frustrating, this wont change in the near future. What do you think?
---
He‚Äôs always banned, even in sliver or gold games as I know.

How is that possible? they guys a pro.

Thank you! He‚Äôs a man of tranquility.

I‚Äôm not 100% sure. I feel like I‚Äôve heard something about him getting a rework

IMO charging clash is one of the best ways to take care of her. Faking a plant, trying to rotate, etc., is all hard because she can pull out her gun on you. Just unfortunate he missed those shots.

Usually I would agree, reddit does shit on emojis for no reason. But that comment in question is literally just emojis. There's nothing else there. Seems kinda worthless. Like commenting 'same' or something.

---
Thanks
---
I would save for Jackal, solid Operator, unless you intend on using him in ranked then I‚Äôd choose someone else, also Glaz, Smoke, etc are Year 0 ops your Y1 ops are Blackbeard, Hibana, etc.
---
I think with the amount of swings he put into me it's more likely his arm was broken haha
---
Yoooo what
---
oh I agree she is the best high risk reward op. My main point is in consistent stratigic play that doesn't work. it's the same reason why vigil isn't that great either. better but still weak. they don't have mucu potential for strats. they do nothing for the team or to synergize with other operators. I don't think she's necessarily pointless. but compared to other roamers, it's clear to me anyway that there are better choices.
---
Clash just looks at Thatcher's exploded forearm
---
TOXIC
---
This. Knife kills are so hard to hit in Siege. IMO IQ should‚Äôve had that one.

Different maybe (I wouldn‚Äôt know, I run M590 on both smoke and mute) but it‚Äôs not bad at all. Almost all SMGs have easily controllable recoil, obviously balances out by low damage per shot and rapid falloff
---
The more Blitz gets nerfed, the more I oike to use it. I can state the sweet flavor of the complaints and tears of an opponent when he types in chat ‚Äúwhy blitz‚Äù or ‚Äúneeds shield cause you are bad‚Äù and I respond with ‚Äúban him then‚Äù or ‚Äúi got nerfed to oblivion, if you let me kill you that means hou are terrible‚Äù.
---
None of the radios stop when you break them in any map
---
Ahh, thanks
---
Just downvote instead of adding another useless comment.
---
that sound, AHHHHHHH!!!!
---
Wow any player with an IQ could tell me that? Then you must be right. Sorry to bother you sir.
---
She relies on people not droning? Yeah sure....if shes camping next to the door and ash just runs in you might be right BUT this doenst fits for Cav players who played her more than 2 matches. When I play Cav I normally run away as fast as possible and go to an area of the map that is less visited and far away from the objectiv. Then I untill like 2 mins while watching cams and listening to the call outs from my teammates so I know when to push. The second the enemies start to confront my team I sneak up and take 1 or 2 of them out. Normally I rotate then to another flank while they waist time and watch their back. Since you normally dont drone everything out again a second time they dont know where I am and when time gets close they get attack from two sides again. The "Cav is only good when people are too dump to drone argument is bullsh**". The only ways this doenst work is if
---
the objective can be controlled and attacked by outside (but you normally dont pick cav then) 
---
The Map is bad for rotations and roaming like Oregon for example (but you normally dont pick cav then)
---
Or if the opponents have a nomad whose placements are good and someone is nearby to follow up with some damage....(nomad got called op almost as much as Lion as far as I heard so thats not a suprise that op counters a normal playstyle)
---
You dont drone every tiny corner on a map mate, the match only goes like 4 mins.
---
idk man, they really thought giving him frags would make him even the slightest bit viable
---
Right.......
---
Let's just drop this Convo, shall we?
---
In a good way or a bad way? xD
---
Pro Gamer or Very Lucky
---
No problem mate ^w^ I appreciate the reply anyways :3
---
Thats realy nice
---
I second the playing with a group. It severely cuts down on toxicity
---
Update your graphics card drivers, I had an issue where closing R6 gave me a blue screen on my AMD card.
---
-hey where is your school backpack
---
-nah i'm good with this small suitcase
---
Because you can't explain why?
---
Say what you will about blitz,but Monty isnt just a balanced shield op,but a very solid operator in general.
---
And if Monty blocks you out of an OBJ that's on you and your team for not having any rotations. Hell even just running outside and going through a window can solve the problem. Every obj has multiple ways in.
---
Almost. If you are playing in a team that is coordinated and can deal with Cav I can understand that you dont ban her but not reading the word Blitz in the message above is very suprising to me. On console Plat he almost 100% ban. No joke.
---
Do you have Valk? I would save up the extra 3k for her.
---
Somewhere in February, right?
---
Yo I just got a legendary skin for a weapon on one of the characters I just lost üòêüòêüòê
---
he got the boombox on his back doe üò≥
---
Music is cool, but real gamers listen to "Don't attempt to board the helicopter" trap remix.
---
You see I don't really get flamed, people don't attack me verbally they kick people for accidents, they kick people for not pulling a 1v4 and it's not like they're high level players, they're on the same level as me, i try to not get annoyed at things like destroying team gadgets or newbie mistakes but apparently no one else follows that
---
That would be broken. Your team could cut off an area of the map and then rush through. They just need to make it so that reinforcements don't break the shields.
---
Thank you! That's awesome lol

I exclusively run her shotgun with the suppressor. Instead of roaming with her though I tend to pick sections of maps with two blind corners, set up barbed wire then a grizmot mine with it. The grizmot is set up so it will only go off when they are past the barbed wire. This prevents them from running away while I come around the corner and rip them apart. Works amazingly and can cover one or two approaches into site.
---
*laughs in gun*
---
you aim like a spastic, no offense
---
Just let the powers of the flick take the wheel
---
‚ÄúWhat map do you want to play on‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
---
I'll try that, I just need to find a group lmao
---
I understand why but I really haven‚Äôt enjoyed the recent changes to the game.  Was corned by a glaz in the so I thought I play it smart and not speak,sit tight and wait it out.  Boy was I wrong...
---
Lol I think iq needs them but echos always banned so I feel like no one plays her
---
I mean he‚Äôs a fucking Aussie, of course he‚Äôs gonna have a cool reload animation.
---
I‚Äôm so glad they just filmed her arm and not the actual transformation.
---
I agree that they drop too slowly and give shit most of the time but I really could care less.
---
Finally! We have peace from that cursed radio.
---
I mean that‚Äôs fair enough. It‚Äôs just quite annoying when I always end up on Outback attack or Hereford base and the games over before i get chance to defend.
---
Indeed...
---
Tell you what, I feel like you already made up your mind but have you considered getting some friends to play this game? The game is much more tolerable with them, I can guarantee you. r/R6STeams and https://squads.tm/game-r6 are good places to get friends.
---
lol on pc i‚Äôm plat 3 and i play on na east servers and all it is, is a bunch of toxic eu people who think that they are good but bottom frag. I wish you could be able to only play with people from your server cause i hate when people from other countries who don‚Äôt speak english play and they always start raging and get hella toxic.
---
There is no such thing as ping abuse. Because someone else's high ping actually gives you the advantage. Example if you both shoot, you will if you hit, win the gunfight, because the other persons bullets the server won't register since it thinks they are dead.
---
not sure it just gave it to me
---
That last kill was clean as fuck, good job.
---
A man of culture
---
Combine
---
Tbh it's gonna be pure shit
---
Yes. His DMR is great after the new season started. His AR is one of the best in the game. His gadget is good, but not as good as it once was.
---
Imo his special ability isnt that good cuz everytime u use that shit everyone holds still and doesnt get detected
---
Shut the fuck up, Doc main (no offense to other Doc mains)
---
I dont play those maps I just back out and switch accounts.
---
Everyone takes ranked seriously, havent played unranked much know about it and casual is for 5stack recruit rushes. I would find a group of friends to play ranked with and get better. What were some of the reasons you felt you lost your ranked matches?
---
You'll see in the video that I did just that in the second clip for a 1v4 clutch.
---
I‚Äôm gonna try him out because my main was Blackbeard and I need a back up.
---
Make so if Goyo's shield is broken by a reinforcement it just breaks and doesn't explode
---
But you still make people stand still
---
https://youtu.be/fXEmbUkDkgo
---
It has infinite electricity, but it has to recharge. It‚Äôd make her completely worthless if she couldn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs already stupidly bad.
---
Ye I wouldn't post stuff like this bc go to my acc People are hating on me
---
Ohh that‚Äôs a tough one. I can‚Äôt say which one is my favorite but I will say I like Ash way more then I did before. She isn‚Äôt boring as hell anymore and actually has some character. Still hate gee trying rushed by her but I can at least understand why she does it. Lol.
---
Until your opponent rubber band bounces around so you can‚Äôt aim at him, and he sees your body from five seconds ago, so he knows where you are
---
yes, he is kinda. his ability is useful when your pushing in or when you have not found the objective yet. even on your own he is useful. but in a squad you wil have more use of him. regardles, a effective edition to every team
---
Stop. Ew.
---
Like 4 min
---
I mean that‚Äôs literally throwing away elo
---
Hey man. Came here from your Mira strats post. Just wanted to say that after the interrogation, lion had moved to behind a soft wall and you have a shotgun. It's moments like that where you can really take advantage of the games destruction mechanics to save exposing yourself. 
---
Well done btw. Just thought I'd try to help. üôÇ
---
Now I need to hipfire and melee to get kills, which, honestly, is a lot more exciting
---
You say this like any of them compare
---
Yep, I noticed that when I was rewatching it. I‚Äôm a lot better at using bullet pen now. Thanks for the tip!
---
To be fair, any attacker is good compared to Blackbeard
---
Join a group. Mute toxic players immediately. Play ranked.
---
No problem. Gimme a shout any time mate.
---
And then you quit.... like.... really...
---
I actually use suppressor because 38 damage is still enough to down 1 and 2 armors in 3 shots, with the benefit of no bullet trail
---
high ping is a disadvantage
---
i‚Äôm gonna make another one just of that
---
Thanks man üòÅ
---
Real question: Can he destroy reinforced walls?
---
thats awesome i use tinkercad for school that stuff isnt easy
---
But how often are you more than 10-15 meters away from your target? Answer: almost never
---
Not really, I‚Äôm kinda new to TinkerCad but I‚Äôll post again if and when I can 3D print it
---
I did this for a school project too
---
I'm guessing someone just had a 10 match losing streak.
---
In my opinion, his ability is a little useless, especially towards the start of a round.  But, if it‚Äôs the end and a 5v1, and the last dude is running for his life, it becomes a lot more useful.
---
Majority of dorms have beds like that. UGA, Auburn, GSU, etc all have those exact beds, so the op has no idea what he's talking about
---
Visual bug, happens all the time, bandit loves using his nitro cell as an mp7 and twitch's shock drone has a famas attachment
---
You can literally play any other operator and he would be better than NerfBeard
---
He doody since the nerf
---
Task failed successfully
---
Gang gang let's go
---
Hello chinese troll. I hope the comment pays at least enough to feed your family.
---
I don't see it.
---
I have one of these outside my bedroom door lol
---
I was surprised about that too, given its Ubi we're talking about
---
[There's also a drum magazine version!](https://i.ibb.co/dLtFVqd/MPX-KS-DRUM.png)
---
Just an idea I had, if ubisoft wants to reuse weapons that's fine, but at least put some effort and make  a different version
---
Touch√©
---
I think its because monty is just plain annoying and can be game winning by just picking him, and that there isn't any other attacker (other than jackal) taht's annoying and strong. Like, some attackers are just boring, and get rarely picked. I think they need to buff the attackers that are rarely picked, and maybe we will see them getting banned instead of monty.
---
She‚Äôs way faster than you when your being zapped
---
Conversely, anyone spawning Alleyway be like 
---
‚ÄúOho! You‚Äôre approaching me?‚Äù
---
youve literally posted the same radio glitch about 10 times, all I need to know is if a radio keeps on playing shoot/mele around it for it to stop.
---
Ive seen like 5 of your posts, all the same thing, just on different maps
---
For your first point:
---
If 2 of the enemy team are joined at the hip then that is one less flank or angle covered by the attackers. The defenders could use that to their advantage. 
---
For your second point:
---
I was trying to point out the hypocrisy of your statement. You mentioned that if shields can't frag on their own then bring a friend. I said that if a defender can't frag a shield on his own then bring a friend. I meant it mostly as a rebuttal to show that they are essentially the same thing.
---
In my mind I see shields as being close-range dueling weapons so I'm okay with them being strong close because they have little long-range capability. I haven't played in a while tho so I might be incorrect in my remembering of things.
---
Money
---
Alright. You've got your opinion on the character and it's clearly not going to change so have a good day üòä
---
I got him
---
This happened to me. The guy was on my team one match and he got like 9 kills and we won like three 2v5 situations. The next match he showed up on the other team and he killed me and was hoverboarding around. I now understand he was good because he was glitched.
---
I know China wasn't calling the shot, but Ubisoft was about to include everyone in the same boat, because of China stupid rules. By standing up to Ubi we stood up to China censor slowly crawling is way to us.
---
This breaks the air soft gun =(
---
Spoit is an absolute monster, check out his videos.
---
And then there's me, who barely ever plays on PC (used to on XB1, but only a level 64 on PC) and one of the only epics I have is Black Ice for Glaz's rifle.
---
If I could give it to you, I would.
---
I know, I‚Äôm just saying mm is broken
---
Ngl I remember it was quite a big thing a while ago
---
you are being tracked
---
step 1. count pings until last ping
---
step 2. go to new corner
---
step 3. wait
---
step 4. shoot jackal
---
step 5. profit
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôve hardly ever seen a situation where a clash is able to back up for so long that they can‚Äôt be caught up to
---
"Shock his titties!"
---
They get paid more that way
---
Why does the girl kinda look like idubbz
---
Also the mute jammer icon so you know when your in it.
---
Casual is casual, don't sweat over it.    
---
IMO it's more annoying that there's absolutely no rank system in place, like some hidden matchmake preferences for opponents.   
---
It's beyond stupid that your team is filled with silvers with one Gold I while opposing team is rolling with gold and plat with one bronze.
---
But I've tried to take a approach that if I'm facing team thats clearly better than I am, to try to switch my gears to only trying to adapt and learn from them.
---
I have, good clash players will always outplay you in a head to head
---
It's also not even the M870, I think it's the FBI shotgun. I also think that the handgun she uses is the 1911. I know that her operator image and video have a handgun that's not the P12

Careful, don't want them to ban Ying next Pro League.
---
Yea, denial is typical among you people. And btw there is large chance I earn more than u do. Perhaps that is why you want the city destroyed and get another chance. Oh i just realized u are not even Hong Kong ppl, so who is the troll here? I hope u get paid enough to troll on somewhere or something u don't even have stake in.
---
One problem at a time
---
why would it change, finka is annoying to play with and you‚Äôre telling me to adapt to something that you don‚Äôt adapt to like wtf is your logic. JuST AdAPt to heating your loud heartbeat and blue edges blocking parts of your screen. JuSt AdApt
---
Ubi fix dis
---
it happens, i've never seen a perfect MM system yet. Don't think there will ever be a perfect one.
---
They said it was designed for tanks
---
Do you work exclusively with and for the chinese government, or is it like a commission type thing where everyone can pay you?
---
If it's the latter, what do you charge per comment?
---
That music is lit feck u
---
You just named all subpar operators ash is only good because her hitbox doesn‚Äôt exist sledge and buck are basically the same operator with buck being better because shotgun is better than a sledge hammer and most people don‚Äôt play blitz correctly to be useful
---
Is this a shitpost?
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs about right. I could drop my settings down a bit to get some higher, but visually, what I‚Äôve got now works for me.

If you destroy the radio you're unepic

How the fuck u a sneak blitz?
---
And yet cosmetics can be added at will new maps new uniforms new reskins? I honestly could give less of a shit about your data mining douche. If you are gonna continue to charge what they do for every season pass and cosmetic item them do whatever you have to to expand the weapon choices. But continue to suck that Ubi dick and make excuses.
---
Thanks! I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head, when I logg in I‚Äôll check and let you know!
---
I'm shocked she got that in. Looks real at first glance.
---
I feel like PS4 is more toxic with votekicks because they don't have text chat to voice their frustrations, so  they just votekick.

But you have to admit, this is ridiculous, almost 1000 mmr difference which is the max difference between squad members
---
You are one of the many reasons I quit siege

are those turtles

how did u do/get/make the mask?
---
As a Hibana main who just got her legendary skin, I have to say I love this very much
---
Finally an actual ace on here that‚Äôs not a console clusterfuck in casual that half the kills are by a fuze charge

I see Clash is an ambi-turner as well.

Explains everything

Oh we can tell its on ps4 buddy

Yikes my guy

It‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between RB6 cosplay and HK protestors.

Thatcher. I just wish his gadget didn't become a fookin marmelade jar.

Is the gun 3d printed? Or is it readily available

That‚Äôs why you ban clash
---
Oh my its the living legend himself i have heard alot about you on this sub
---
cool but would have been funny if it had been just a black square
---
When I was on Xbox the community was super toxic online. Since I switched to pc I‚Äôve had barley any toxic situations. Very minimal in my experience compared to console.
---
Jager is confirmed homo erectus
---
In a life threatening situation, the average persons heartbeat can be upwards of 175 beats per minute. A well trained tango is able to stay cool, keep calm. Their heart rates can be 70 to 100 beats per minute.
---
But by the time I'm done, *that number goes down to zero.*
---
It's a good thing.
---
This. You said you didn't even get a warning, so you obviously new you were doing something.
---
\*MC Hammertime starts playing\*
---
Ik, but i was really curious as to what it was like with the ACOGs
---
I'd like it if:
---
1. His barricades couldn't be destroyed by Ash (which would make them much more viable for windows)
---
2. His barricades could be buffed by Bandit/Kaiden
---
I mean, they're made of metal and you can't electrify them. It would make Sledge the only viable counter without a Thatcher, but that's sort of the case with wall barricades already.
---
Ddos
---
Thank you. It's difficult keeping up with this much information from HK on a daily basis.
---
We need a Finka!
---
Not the place for this
---
is this real?
---
I hopped from PS to PC and I played R6 since launch on PS but I eventually lost interest because of the toxicity and m&amp;k users. When I got on PC I got it for shits n giggles, and I had to get used to the new ops, but I‚Äôve come to prefer it to playing on PS for a few reasons. 
---
1 being that legit m&amp;k are so much better than controller. It takes a bit of time to get used to, but it‚Äôs just so much more intuitive. 
---
2 being that players are *generally* less toxic. For whatever reason I feel like the PC community is less out to ruin your day to get their dick hard. But I am just a casual pleb so take that for what it‚Äôs worth. 
---
3 being that TS access is pretty dope. 
---
4 being that playing R6 on higher frame rates is so much more satisfying. I couldn‚Äôt go back to 60 FPS (or even 30 lmao) solely because it‚Äôs so much smoother. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to shit on consoles or scream PCMR!!! But the bottom line is, for me, someone who plays the game casually and for fun because I love the mechanics and gameplay, it‚Äôs worth it. 
---
For those who are plat and diamond on console, I‚Äôd recommend trying it. Even though the change in controls will be a pain at first, it becomes so much easier once you change your keybinds. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Report and move on. Team killing is uncalled for no matter how bad the mistake is.
---
ns
---
Splish splash your opinion is trash
---
What are you talking about, you have willing donated your organs after spending a lot of time at the super happy fun camps working on helping the poorer people of China in the Western regions. Having worked so hard for the People's Republic of China your body began to shut down. So as a good patriot you decided to donate your organs for the betterment of the nation.
---
*This message has been brought you by the Ministry of Truth.*
---
Give me castle now!!
---
So that‚Äôs not playing competitively. That‚Äôs just hitting diamond in ranked with a competent team of 4 others. You may be a good player, I am not and haven‚Äôt said you‚Äôre not, and I‚Äôm not accusing you of M&amp;K or anything. 
---
I just like the way you‚Äôre claiming you are the closest thing to a pro while playing on console and claiming you play competitively (Go4‚Äôs aren‚Äôt competitive play), while bragging about Diamond eventhough you play as a full team who are likely competent, and claiming you know more because of this. 
---
If you played on PC, and solo queued to diamond and kept it, every season then yes, you‚Äôd have clear knowledge and credibility....but you don‚Äôt do that. What‚Äôs your main account called? I‚Äôm honestly curious lol
---
Mute wasn‚Äôt on the reticle...
---
It definitely has a smaller player amount compared to casual or ranked but I‚Äôve also found it highly depends on level and skill, my main account level 284 can‚Äôt find a game even after 30+ minutes but on my second account level 87 I find games within 1-2 minutes
---
Youtube or streamer or both?
---
Oh my God. You're giving me a stroke
---
I'm gonna use this "shot in the head logic" (which doesn't make sense in this situation, the only reason that applies to Doc and Rook is because their gadgets apply to survivability, not objective play, which are two different things, and the fact that they focus on survivability instead of objective play makes them inherently less useful)   
---
Lesion, Kaid = Objective Gadgets
---
Doc, Rook = Survival Gadgets
---
Jager = Survival+Objective Gadget
---
Easy breakdown for you. Survival gadgets are inherently less useful than Objective gadgets because you only need one person alive to win a round with an objective gadget. Whereas survival gadgets will help you accomplish objectives, but indirectly and aren't as powerful. 
---
Lesion slows their push into objective, tells the defenders where enemies are and forces defenders to pull out the Gu mine if they want to move. Furthermore, the effects of a gu mine can help win people gunfights based on information (knowing where the enemy is), the fact that the enemy can't escape, and the fact that the enemy's vision is obstructed. It can also save players from rushes etc... 
---
Kaid prevents the enemy from entering the objective and completing their job. Furthermore, by preventing them from entering the objective, the enemy has less lines of sight making it harder for the enemy to kill you (gives defenders safe places to hold, which is way better than the extra 20 health rook plates offer), furthermore, even if they get the Kaids, they need to waste time and utility to do so, as well as the fact that they had to bring a Thatcher or whoever to remove the Kaid (which could've been replaced with another op).
---
Doc, Rook, require no direct counters, anyone can counter them, they only help you survive bodyshots, and they won't protect you from the enemy gaining far more lines of sight or the enemy getting into the objective. Therefore, they're far less useful than a Kaid or a Lesion 
---
Based on your comments, you have a key lack of understanding of this game and need to spend more time playing this game to understand how it works
---
Definitely the comp. Horizontal recoil is way harder to control than vertical, and the comp nearly removes it completely.
---
Ubisoft already defied china when they decided not to change the maps to meet chinese censorship standards. Take the bandwagoning somewhere
---
Pretty sure this was already published before SI19 so don‚Äôt expect to much
---
That‚Äôs the joke it‚Äôs a good community to spread this
---
tyty
---
I literally play in leagues like AG, Bread League, MMGL, CEL etc... Which all have monetary rewards but ok... And furthermore, read my other reply, you aren't even half as knowledgeable than you think you are, and it shows. Despite having half the time, my understanding of this game is far better than yours.
---
A warning? I didn't know what I did wrong though.
---
I mean if it would be like normal reinforcing it would be useless, they would peek you instantly
---
Yes this would be amazing! I‚Äôd actually start maining castle
---
Plus the ability to relocate the jammers after you get the drones is pretty nifty
---
NANI?!
---
Yup.10 defending gadgets destroyed.
---
These always make my day that little bit better.
---
Sorry, you said escalating ban, not warning.
---
Ubi is also part owned by tencent careful fellas
---
Its funny cuz when I'm not playing recruit its either dokkabi or mute
---
Lmao in some countries you would have too
---
That‚Äôs...ying?....ok.....
---
What are you talking about? If I don't like the opinion or thoughts of a channel I don't need to stay subscribed. I don't owe him anything.

I'd have to worry about this if my audio wasn't constantly glitched to the point where it seems that I am watching a silent film.

üò™ I don‚Äôt like talking about that
---
Helps the whole team at the start of the game, Has impact and a good gun with acogs(same as doc). 
---
Unlike doc he doesnt have to stay alive to help his team. Even if he is alive he needs direct line of sight to help the teammate and not get shot while you dont have a gun on you. 
---
Doc is really good for aggressive roams where you want to heal up and continue fighting or anchors that want to support the team then they get hit or roamers coming back with a few hits on them.
---
What I mean was I would just accept it's an error and just come back later. But I have no idea what I did wrong and it's permanent?
---
I think the biggest change is that he can't track the same person twice, that's personally a very big factor when I decide if I want to ban him or not. He did get some very hefty nerfs so I'll be waiting to see if they do anything more with him since his winrate is definitely going to get even lower.
---
Contact support obviously.
---
U guys are nuts this is for tr hunt not the main ranked mode lol
---
Contact the company, then. How do you know what specific match caused it?
---
Go to r/Rainbow6TTS, should be in a pinned post at the top
---
It says in the Code of Conduct, they won't repeal toxic bans and that I should study them to make sure this won't happen.
---
Congrats
---
Up the doc lad ;) uno gecko will always be on them stims
---
Yup. And Twitch Drones are like my wet dream. When I get one I scream with childish delight.
---
If you weren't being toxic then you arent appealing a toxic ban, you are appealing a mistake.
---
1 v 1. Protect your honor. Assert your dominance. During the 1 v 1 make sure they know how much of anlpha you are and talk about how many whomans you frick every night and how many times you have been to there moms house. Works every time.
---
I always restart the queue after 2 minutes and I find a game in the next 20 secondes.
---
Bad timing
---
I thought the main idea of Mei was "if we use a Blizzard character in protest it can be banned and Blizzard will kneel to China for nothing."
---
What was the project? Anyway this looks sick!
---
I don't know what match caused it but I was playing T-Hunt with my friends for a warm-up.
---
Many characters have gotten bundles out of their seasons.
---
It's the other way around for me lol
---
[deleted]
---
Ok it makes more sense now
---
Hey man, you do you. I'm not here to convert or preach to anyone what I believe in. I just replied to someone, correcting them when they assumed what I believed in and got it wrong.
---
Something along the lines of, 
---
"I love doing it to toxic people.
---
And people with anime profile pics"
---
With rook you're a team player but theres also that one person that doesnt take armor and runs off (usually heavy roamers from what i've encountered)
---
that's actually a useful angle
---
Also doesnt her VA support China over Hong Kong
---
Come on dude... I understand that people are upset about this and everything, and so am I as a WoW subscriber, but this is low effort Karma farming at it's best. Everyone who cares already knows what's going on, no need for these posts. They are all over the WoW forums, PC subreddits, etc, etc. I just want one forum that doesn't have stuff like this plastered all over it :/
---
I have his papillon shield skin but the more the merrier cx
---
It would cause people to quit on maps they do not like without penalty since the map is shown prior to ban phase. Also people would scope out the opposite team and leave if they were schooled by someone previously and want to avoid playing against them.
---
my nerf gun does that

People are impatient as fuck lol. They were likely toxic teammates anyway.

Nah, Mute i still solid for basically any team comp. I'm particularly fond of playing Castle/Mute and giving teams with traditional hard breachers a hard time because they can't use most of their stuff against the Castle walls, and then I can keep a spare jammer on me for if they start to Thermite/Hibana a wall or something.
---
Mute is kinda meh when you only use him for intel denial, instead of using him to prevent hard breaches. Once you start doing that he's one of the most annoying ops.

Why does iq have the fmg

I play both Console and PC. Xbox is my console preference not because it is better than PlayStation or because of the console wars BS. I love PlayStation Games. But will not consider it until it goes one full generation without being hacked. Unfortunately, it was last hacked this year. That is the 3rd time this gen.
---
PC, however, love the community but hate the M&amp;K. So, I play my prefered method. I use a controller. 
---
I don't care to fight with PC players over who is better or worse. But I can easily take on most PC players in a casual match using my controller. I am too low level on PC to play Ranked. But am over 130 on Xbox. So I know the maps. I know the game. And can take the enemy on and get MVP. I have poor recoil control on M&amp;K. But Console is burned into me. All I did was set my settings the exact same as Xbox and played. Used 60 FPS too. My PC is not amazing or anything. But Siege can run on 150ish FPS if I desired.

Red dot on maestro lmg oh no
---
you can help yourself counter it by being more unpredictable and selectively aggressive
---
Or do we? Maybe this is all part of OPs plan
---
Thats not toxic in any way

Big brother coming in for overwatch.    *Baguette noises*
---
That's our property!

No. Time his kick from the first death and it's about 1-2 seconds.
---
huch
---
R6 is worse than any other game ive played though when a game is supposed to be "competitive" it should have the least amount possible when in reality its gamebreaking that someone can see me for almost a full second before i even see their shoulder poke around a corner

Time the beginning of friendly fire and you‚Äôve got 6

Take out glaz, add fuze. Imagine everyone pushing the objective while fuze turns it into a war zone.
---
That's fu**** hilarious.
---
How do you do this on xbox
---
He should get a rework, and/or we should get more options.
---
I'm not saying he's OP at all but I think he does too much for the team, making him almost a "must". 
---
Jams drones, denies Dokkaebi's calls, blocks Hibana's and Thermite's charges, jams normal breaching charges, negates Fuze charges, Lion's ability, Jackal's ability, etc.

What is this about?
---
China believes Hong Kong is rightful Chinese land. Since Hong Kong was released by the UK, it has acted as an autonomous democracy free of Chinese communist rule.
---
The Chinese are trying to force Hong Kong into submission, so widespread violence and protest in the city. 
---
China itself has multiple death camps for religious and ethnic groups, as well as political groups. They target mainly Muslims and spiritual groups, and a good amount of evidence of organ harvesting has come out.
---
But it‚Äôs more than just human rights violations and communism. It‚Äôs about the spread of Chinese influence. Many companies are owned by Chinese corporations, even us companies. And many large US corporations have been scared to step up to China, China basically being able to control these American companies into submission.
---
Most importantly the NBA has refused to stand against China after an NBA general manager retweeted a pro Hong Kong tweet. His own players turned their backs on him to prevent themselves from being criticized. China has cut pretty much all of its ties from the NBA. China is a big source of income from them, so they don‚Äôt have his back.

I got back into siege at the start of this new season and I've been playing just ranked and unranked. Idk my stats for it but I'd say I have a positive win ratio.
