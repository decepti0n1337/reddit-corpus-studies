Me with any shotgun in any game

---

Thank you. In nearly every video I saw it was either the guys fault or the guy who played ash got a high ping, or somethin similiar. Don‚Äòt know why they all scream she needs a nerf. Probably just screaming what others are screaming to get some attention.

O no

How do you can "Fuze" Main to "War Crime Main"?
---
Don't use the p10 Roni
---
Yes that's a latency issue, your client didn't receive all packets at once and when the info reached your game she had shot you for plenty of rounds that equate to a "Superbullet" from your perspective.

I wouldn‚Äôt call it stealing, I would call it bettering humanity as a whole. If anyone can edit this I would love that.

This makes me think of the alien from the alien franchise

What language u speaking
---
I object
---
Yeah I was like, why is the other team not banning and I'm the only one on my team that's voting, so confused... I also got that fat 15 minute ban from disconnecting.

Turned 999 to 1k nice!

I hate mozzie &gt;:( but happy birthday :)

---
lvl? and rank?
---
I know that, but you get some bad apples who straight up can‚Äôt stand people having fun by playing on console and assume we have bad game sense etc, I see so many comments on clips of people going full bot saying stuff like has to be console trash. The mpx is actually really easy once you learn how to use it correctly on console OP just needs to practice a bit more.
---
Unpopular Opinion: I like it. I think people take this whole ‚Äúcopying pro league‚Äù too far. Sure they mimic pros and what they like but it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the most balanced way to play the game. Secure can be a shitshow, and too many reckless people to risk playing Hostage in Ranked. Bomb is balanced. Pick &amp; Ban will change over time... people banning ops who annoy them or are difficult to counter but over time you‚Äôll see less Blitz/Jackal/Cav/Echo bans once people play more and adjust. I mean Warden is a direct counter to Blitz. 
---
Casual is still there. I don‚Äôt prefer it, but it‚Äôs still an option. Bomb requires communication but this game always required it. Ranked was in Beta for 4 years and we all wanted it out, and now it is and I think better for it. I do however think they should make 2 playlists for Ranked. A solo/duo que and a 5 man que. 5 man squads will always have an upper hand over randoms. But that‚Äôs it. Making too many playlists or ways to play only increases the que time, which is why I think they only give us one. Que times are much faster. Siege keeps getting more and more players so they needed to make things simpler. Newcomer playlist and once you join Ranked now you only need to focus on Bomb. Idk.. I like the direction it‚Äôs going. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Don‚Äôt be a noob and win your attacks
---
Wait, I won't get punished for bailing early? I thought was a thing 
---
I'm way ok bailing on those situations, they're hopeless endeavours anyways with very little gain
---
You only get punished for bailing in ranked.

You in EU? EU is flooded with toxic middle east pingers. If you see atleast 2 100+pings on your team you're in for a tough match.

This was at the end of the match as you can see, not bothered about the rage. More fussed about the racial slurs and bypassing the chat filter.
---
yeah they really do need to do something about mnk. im a pc player but when i do play on console at times its insane how many mnk's i see. most arent even that good but its still mnk
---
Ddosing is the worst. My team would be winning (once in a lifetime for me) and then like 2 of us would get booted offline. It's the worst

Insert "To be continued" music and sign.

im glad you didnt sensor the names. a lot of ppl do for some reason and i think bringing this to light so hopefully ubi can ban them faster

well the only stats i see is steamcharts and every day there is more than 130k players active at a certain time. I cant imagine playstation has more player counts because of the competition to call of duty which is always the best selling game. And i didnt see R6 iis in the top 10 best selling games for PS4
---
Good to know! Thank you
---
doesn‚Äôt matter if jackal‚Äôs the best op if he‚Äôs banned every ranked match. lol

3 player inside 2 player out i am on out i ve killed 2 3 players per round and they cannot protected the objective so STFO! On attack idiot pick ups defuser and rushes in obj and congrat defuser insede the OBJJJJJJ!

i appreciate good console clips, i really do. but i hate clips  that would never exist if the enemies werent total bots.

Sure thing! :)

thats gonna be the problem then. ur just playing against smurfs. get a higher lvl mate to play with so u get 'higher' matchmaking.

There's an official stat chart somewhere if you can be arsed to find it. There's not that much competition on console, everyone's bored of cod and bf years ago, then there's r6.

I was gonna post this! Take an upvote, I guess.
---
Low Level- M249 with scope or hole depending on play style, from my personal experiences at low level the ads time usually doesnt matter and if you play your cards right, you wont need to reload for the entire round. High level- Para for faster Ads and your aim will probably be better so you dont need the extra 70 bullets
---
nothing new lol
---
Lol it's goobisoft. They have to sit through an hour of queue to get to a half ass agent anyway. No biggie dude.
---
I'm using a G233 and i can hear any sound in the game perfectly, even leaning and aiming-down-sights.  
---
 You don't need high end eartphones to play Rainbow Six, most regular headsets can already cover you unless you're really going for a cheap 5 dolar "headset".  
---
 Not to mention that to use a really good earphone on a PC you'd have to buy a dedicated sound card for it to be able to actually deliver all that the phone has to offer.
---
It‚Äôs become such a big problem, i used to play ark and i was used to it them, people would ddos your servers, people would get your ip if you ever traded with them, it‚Äôs so easy to do and yet ubisoft who are meant to be this big company refuse to acknowledge console‚Äôs problems, we‚Äôve got a pointless report function that hasn‚Äôt worked since launch. We get ddosed, mouse and keyboard users, even multiple glitches which thankfully are getting addressed quicker now with flat out bans, but i just feel we get the cold shoulder even with how big the player base is on console.

Yes, it is now the standard for ranked, which is now only bomb.

Warden is highly situational but lesion you have to stay alive. Lesions better but practice staying alive first.

Ok thank you because I really liked playing that gamemode.

Thanks!

I had a feeling it was old that HUD seems different than what we have now.

I‚Äôm plat 3 and my aim is decent, finna go with a para

That has nothing to do with it. It's based on server location, local ISP traffic, metering, wifi vs LAN, server availability, etc.

I use both depending on the situation. For exemple, I would use the Para with angled grip for       a more fragger role and the M249 for a more supportive role.

Just shared this with me group lol

I did change my attachments recently so maybe that‚Äôs it

plain blue and black vs 3 different blue shades and brown, looks way better imo

Because he's garbage.

There is always a way for a roamer to flank. U less your in a party of 5 its heavily defender sided

hAxor!

I kid I kid! :) good one

Ubisoft should have stricter penalties for the ones who leave ranked matches

You ruined the fun of a well edited vid

Epic meme, fuze has a strong moral conviction and cares for civilian live, not that anyone on reddit, or ubisoft themselves care about the lore that they'd written, even though redditors love siege lore apparently
---
Doesn't give you the complete freedom to roam around the map in order to memorize it + hatches + cameras + possible spawn peeking locations (very common in silver)
---
It's a fun way, but sandbox mode would make it easier and faster
---
Love to you brother

This is from a very long time ago I can‚Äôt remember even being in this situation tbh

"Your Move"

Literally don‚Äôt get how people enjoy doing this? It looks so boring

This is why recruit should stay in ranked.

Amen

Just running into a hacker vs hacker game is just unbelievable.
---
Good job, I haven‚Äôt even done my placements yet.
---
Thanks man
---
Why would they? They can‚Äôt be bought with actual money so they have no reason to rig them.
---
Well if you want complete freedom just start a custom match and do exactly that.
---
we need a character like sledge for defenders, for taking walls out haha
---
shotguns are nice but i like big hammer man

imagine trying to move around with that auto-lock to their head crap. Like, without the vault over the entire map thing.

So you play more

Hello Iamthatduck16, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c3yc7c/how_it_feels_being_on_a_team_with_ash/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
you know whats not strong that gun skin game
---
Most of the time, when people pick Recruit, it is seen as ‚Äòthrowing‚Äô the round, or in other words, not taking it seriously.
---
Every headset is "enough", every piece of hardware can get the job done, but there are hardware that are just better and more optimal.
---
Cloud 2 has a usb dongle, no sound card or audio interface needed, and they sound much more alive and rich than most Logitech headsets.
---
But ash and bandit both have very strong gadgets. So play them when not taken. Also learn most of the guns it will do you a solid. Trust me I have 900 hours on the game
---
My question us why does it matter? Its just for skins that do nothung to improve your game. Well I still say some skins can hinder your game when they are the bright flashey variety. The rate you get alpha packs is not worth stressing over.
---
 Just looking now I have 40 that I have yet to open.

Oh boy this whole comment section made me lose hope

Nice

Nah fam it's not cod thankfully

That screech at the end tho...

I‚Äôm grateful for any skin as I just finished buying all the starters and a couple DLC characters... starter version op
---
It really kills the mood.
---
Why?
---
Wtf. Why did your teammate straight up end you?
---
Yeah
---
Bruhhhhhh that‚Äôs so bad and I feel bad but I had to laugh. 
---
Hope that wasn‚Äôt ranked.
---
Everyone hates the map. It isn't about learning it because I know the map. Just because I know house doesn't make it good. You aren't special
---
How fucking childish, cant handle a loss.
---
Its just kinda ridiculous how greedy ubisoft is
---
Probably cause it was casual, or he saw that I'm level 255 unranked with a .9 kd and he thought "Ha what a noob, better kill him!"
---
Lol
---
They got rid of the starter edition, it's more or less how it was at launch
---
Neither are you dude. Hereford isn't going to be removed no matter how much you complain. It isn't an unbalanced mess like you seem to think.
---
Imagine before charging in to kill some hardcore terrorists or drug lords you have to wait for one of the group members to put on KISS makeup

Could you do one of blitz or fuse? That would be really cool

That was a pre good play as well I‚Äôm so mad
---
I am not so sure at the moment only because it the ranked guide it says ‚Äúranked players will get a charm at the end of the season based on their standing‚Äù, this leads me to believe that you will get a charm based on what rank you end the season with.
---
Again I can‚Äôt be sure as this is the first season ranked is out of beta.

Lame man sorry to see that. Haven‚Äôt seen much toxic while playing though I‚Äôm usually in a group of 3-4.

Honestly this season background is awesome. The way she Fades in and out is freaking when you are tired and not paying attention.
---
Yea haha games like this don‚Äôt happen often where the opposing team is completely inept.
---
When I don‚Äôt even have a black ice ingame after 730 hrs but you finna make a real one irl ;w;
---
Nice work btw!
---
I don‚Äôt know why everyone here is hating on you for manning recruit. I agree with recruit making the game harder, and this also means that people are doing it to the people new to the Siege community and gives hem the idea that the entire community is toxic. People that team kill recruits are total POS‚Äôs
---
Obviously, but how much can it really be, the game already runs really good, how many frames if any would you loose, I‚Äôm sure unit could just turn so things down the more your fov goes up of just not let you put it high enough to effect performance
---
Ranked as well  they should slowly increase ban time from 30 mins to and hour to a day to a month, like CS:go.
---
Huh? I have recordings of one guy flying straight up in the air and hipfiring us. What is there to test?
---
They do
---
I think they should experiment with it. Even if it reduces performance it'd still be a nice touch
---
I don‚Äôt like bad words &gt;:(
---
This would be top quality without the UI but nonetheless epic
---
Would totally take old over new.
---
Honestly if I could play at 120 fov but I have frame drops frequently I probably would, but if they can perfect a Higher locked fov that would be fine because I‚Äôm sure no one wants a lower fov

BRB messaging and asking him who the next two operators are.

Wdym

Not only is it a sad replacement, they're trashing old maps that old players like my self love.

The way they're going with siege is horseshit I miss the days when it first came out.

fuck I haven‚Äôt tried that

haha i get it

We need a lot of things in this game but you got to wait. It's *only* been out like 4 years.

He dipped so fast I thought his body just glitched through the floor, goddamn.

Nope I simply asked a question.
---
Honestly though, the open floor plan really does f*** up almost all attacker plans. When you‚Äôre used to being able to safely approach the armored walls and use them as cover, but then they aren‚Äôt there... it sometimes puts people in panic mode and they are all like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt plan for this.‚Äù

Super random, but how are you able to have the operator icons next to your name? Really cool haha

How the fuck? Goobisoft, come fix this BULLSHIT right now.

Hmm I don't know if that was my question?

There's no penalty for leaving. Just leave and requeue. If you get good teammates try to add them and queue with them.

INCIDENT 53A-9: Agent Pereira had attempted to terminate Salkova in his sleep after he borrowed her pistol and forgot where he put it, causing Pereira to go into a near-psychotic rampage.

The DDOSing has been happening on PS4 too but I don‚Äôt even know how you do this on console... WTF if you lose you lose. This is so damn childish

&gt; 1. Content must be directly related to Rainbow 6

Please do not post spam or content unrelated Rainbow 6

If you submit an image or video, it needs to contain assets from within the game itself or related artwork. Assets simply overlaid on Siege or vice versa do not count.

Yeah it does the same on my phone also but trust me, i couldnt see in game lol
---
Damn, I started played when maverick and clash came out. I wish I had the game when outbreak was a thing
---
Can I finally play clash again
---
Just restart your game
---
I've always thought that too, like there's actually no reason at all for Zofia to have it, it just happens that she was when they thought of having someone who can self revive on attack

Hey look, that's me

It was one of the Parabellum seasonal universals so I don't think it's universal anymore, but I use it on my fuze shield.

That hostage makes my pp hard for some reason
---
I knooowwwwwww I'm really excited for it

Thank you, I need to get better but this is a start!
---
Yes please. I‚Äôd really like to see new PvE content for Siege. I understand that it‚Äôs not very feasible because it‚Äôs incredibly likely that the vast majority only plays multiplayer and has no interest in PvE (aside from a quick warm-up and challenges). Still, I hope that we get to see something new in PvE one day.
---
Reality can be anything I want
---
Except they keep doing it to other players too. I already have to deal with backfills and then these assholes. Why should they get to keep doing their bullshit? Reporting them is such a hassle too. I have to record several gigs of stuff, upload it and then share the multiple rounds worth of shit.

Or of he's looking for a very fast-paced shooter r/titanfall

you will never understand how infuriating this is unless you played during the time when all reinforced walls were equally sized. none of this half a wall BS

Agree. Any bonus would be good.
---
 But as I stated the downside is the high volume of inexperienced players in the higher ranks.
---
Thank you, brother
---
Friend got DDoSed today then they crashed the server when we were coming back 3-2 :(
---
Oh in that case it's easy. I'll try explain it simply 
---
Create a new layer
---
On that layer, trace the eye with the pen tool to make a shape.
---
Once done, right click the layer in the list and click blending options
---
Go down to Outer Glow and mess around with it.
---
Hope this helps you man, any clarification let me know
---
There won't be any issues finding games. There's a few cheaters but they're few abd far between in my experience.
---
Just be ready though, Siege on console and Siege on PC are two very different games. People have better aim and are more communicative on PC, it can be a much more intense experience. But arguably it's where this game is at it's best, there's a reason all the Pro League games are on PC.

What do you mean, you get to stand in front of everyone else at the end of the match. Lol

Does it really matter who‚Äôs MVP?
---
Should be casual is better than ranked tbh. More maps, all ops, recruit, rounds are quicker, all game modes. The only bad thing really is toxic players but even ranked has that if you solo que a lot. And I guess it is harder with certain objectives
---
Holy fucking shit I'm dying
---
I've never heard anyone say it's a good map, no clue why it's still in ranked
---
You just lost a game better get kicked
---
You chose fuze and didn't go shield kicked
---
You didn't go rookie you get kicked
---
I hate the vote to kick system pisses me off
---
He is good artist
---
This has been done at least 2 times already with the same operator, how is this getting upvotes
---
Does anyone know what him and a sniper have in common
---
Or they just kill you (that's what happens to me at least)
---
Yeah killing people is nice

or they TK you, and every single cunt tks you

You know what would be an even better solution? You getting better at the game. 
---
Going through your post history, it seems like you have the exact same "complaints" I used to have when the game or community pissed me off. Realized I was getting pissed of because life was stressful, and I actually don't know better than a team of developers being paid millions of dollars a year across the entire team.
---
1. When a mate quits you loose less MMR and would gain more
---
2. Hitreg is not broken
---
3. Diamond and a Copper  playing together for low MMR is definitly not ok

Cmon if ur gonna repost at least crop it correctly lmao.

Being able to penetrate ballistic shields is a bit too much, but having it put a "stagger" effect on shield ops, slowing their movement would be a good trade off. Makes no sense someone can wield a ballistic shield with one arm under LMG suppressive fire.
---
It's not for me. I tried it and I just didnt like it.
---
its the deployable shield dude
---
It is, but right now siege (both console and PC) is filled with DDOSers and hackers.
---
From my experience PC was much better compared to both PS4 and Xbox one.
---
Jackle obviously
---
1 is not true because I literally just played a match where one of my teammates left at the beginning of the round and we lost and I got normal ELO. Not to mention the other team was 1 diamond 3 silvers and an unranked

You have people dropping though. Plats against only coppers would be stupid

Basically first I used the slicing on the lower part of the snoo to have the glitch effect. Then I created 2 layers of the snoo, one that was normal (top half) and one that was slightly transparent and blurred (lower half). Then I used eraser to erase the top half of the blurred layer, and bottom half of the normal layer.
---
Hope that was clearly explained lol
---
It was added back
---
Maybe they haven't got round to it, or they don't think it fits the game. There could even be some copyright issues with including the gun (which is I believe why lots of the guns in the game are given different names) that would prevent them even using a particular or noticeable attribute about the gun.
---
So go exploit it while you still can because not everyone knows it
---
People purposely lose games to drop to lower ranks. With your idea, this means that a group of plats could drop and only go against coppers
---
We don't even know if this higher tier would habe a better anticheat maybe it only has a cool GUI...

Don't steal content you prick.
---
This comment, Big yikes
---
All I can say is it‚Äôs just random. I played 5 games today and 4/5 we started on defense. It seems like the game kinda just says ‚Äúhey you‚Äôre gonna play ____ today.‚Äù 
---
But I honestly don‚Äôt feel like any maps are really top defender or attacker sided, particularly with Bomb. With how Bomb works I find the reinforcements and gadgets are spread out enough that it feels very fair to both teams. And if you‚Äôre attacking first, your job should be as easy as theirs is: just win one round. Just one. Because if you really feel it‚Äôs defender sided, if you can win one attacking round out of the three it should be very easy to win all three defensive rounds and that‚Äôs the match right there. I don‚Äôt like attacking *at all,* I hate it, but I don‚Äôt let it bother me even if we go 0-3 on attack. Because then we get to defend for three rounds. And if you get swept then chances are it really didn‚Äôt matter which side you started on.
---
Sorry if I hurt your feelings.
---
Should have just given her panda makeup
---
There is no evidence on Battleye's site that there are multiple tiers. This is completely made up by King George as far as official sources are concerned.
---
Well, been here since beta too actually...But you''re absolutely right. I didn't really mean that the game would be dying, I can't see myself not playing in fact...idk I was just pissed off and I guess being here since day one, with all that shit you mentionned and more, and seeing myself keep playing and triggered by the same idiots and bs, I felt kinda sad. lmao
---
this is absolutely amazing work.  you should be proud!
---
Good point i did not really think of that
---
No, it's even more infuriating when you are new to the game and it looks like the wall only needs one only to see your operator take a sidestep and place a tiny reinforcement down.

You can use your brain to achieve omniscience? Theres no correlation between any of the players there besides that 2 of them are gold and the rest are not. That's not common sense, that's jumping to conclusion.

I'm Gold 1 and haven't encountered any hackers since last season.

The issue isn't the matchmaker, it's never going to put a gold in a game with coppers without manipulation. What they're doing is queuing up together so they effectively get to smurf for free.

Not if you go for the head. For the most part the damage is a little underwhelming but I have pretty good aim as is, it just seems to give me a little more control with little spread and recoil.

---
There is no perfect way to do MMR in Siege, it can't be entirely based on personal performance because some people/operator are more suited towards helping the rest of the team win than bringing the win themselves. And a system based on wins and losses like it is currently has the issue of putting people who shouldn't be in the rank they are in.
---
The latter imo is better for Siege, you will eventually get bad teammates and you will probably slowly get to where you should be. Mind you that in lower ranks you have smurfs who derank on purpose to just have easier opponents to play agaisn't.
---
That looks insanely cool man, nice

They changed the content of the versions  after they decided to scrap the starter edition. So basically they revised all the content each editions offer.

STRIKING VIPERS X
---
It literally says how in your screenshot.
---
Roaming isn't limited to a few specific operators, don't listen to the silvers who think only J√§ger, vigil, and Cav are allowed to roam and that everyone else should literally sit static in the objective.
---
Fucking PATHETIC Ubisoft you're ASS at competitive matchmaking. The fact that this is STILL allowed years after Ranked was started shows how great of a job you are doing. But let's worry more about OpErAtOr BaLaNcINg.
---
It would be a lot harder to play blitz, as once you flash someone they would spray, preventing you from shooting.
---
The 9mmC1 has one of the best damage outputs when it comes to long range and it being an smg

it may be because of party chat but even game audio is mainly prioritized

You only feel like you're getting these maps more often. My friend complain about getting tower so often, just because its more memorable, if you don't like it.

What I'd recommend, is going into a custom game with a friend, Reinforce 2 different walls different distances away from you, and get your friend to maverick them for you, and pay attention to what sound it makes, once you know the sound, it stands out alot to the ambient sounds of the map, and even against gunfire. 
---
I use a Logitech G430 7.1 surround sound headset, before this I was using a old set of turtle beach PX21's and I had a much much harder time hearing anything in game with them, so possibly time to update your headset maybe?? Check the drivers for it, windows settings all that stuff

Iceycat makes good operator and map guides for beginners. Also, oddly specific, but you CSGO players typically use "banana" to refer to bomb B I believe? In siege banana means a specific balcony/position on the map bank, so don't get confused by that.

Yeah but in China it's this or nothing because censorship.
---
One of the issues Siege has at the moment is the engine it uses just doesn't allow for proper fixing. It would need to be ported to another engine and I'm no game developer but I'm certain this isn't something you can do in one season.
---
The reason a lot of the fixes are just bandages that come off all the time is because the engine isn't designed for a really consistent, competitive first person shooter, it uses Assassin's Creed's engine which was designed for single player epics not a one shot kill headshots first person shooter. It also has a lot of spaghetti code because it was never intended to be a game that lasted more than 2 years. In fact you can literally find bits of stuff related to Assassins Creed Unity in the game's code.

Ah, same in siege, I just wanted to make sure you didn't get confused he first time you heard it. Most other rooms are called by the room name or noticeable features in the room, so they're pretty easy to learn.

Bug where she can become invisible
---
It's been so long since the last time I've had fun while playing this game.
---
No amount of breaks helps, I can't just stop playing it either. There is no other game that scratches the same itch. 
---
Yet every time I do play it I wish I hadn't. 
---
It's just so SHIT, season after season, year after year it's the same bullshit. Cheaters, glitches, exploits, bugs, shit optimization, slow updates...etc.
---
Sometimes it feels like this game has only a couple of people working on it in the dev team with the quality, quantity and speed of the updates.
---
I am addicted to this game yet just by playing a single ranked match I get an urge to smack my head against a wall scream in mental agony.
---
Been playing since Blood Orchid, had hackers prevalent in some of the former seasons, but Phantom Sight. It‚Äôs back to back games all day long, as you stated literally unplayable..
---
I know how you feel, best solution for me is to just keep trying and just play
---
It still won't stop people from doing it. Ubi doesn't want to limit what its players can do, it's just the way it is, there's no better way.
---
If you have a fast connection (normally low in game ping) you get put in the match fastest, I also have been about 80% of my total matches on the blue team.
---
Depends on play style but lesion is OP. if you're a high rank player then Ying will be used in a lot of your games.  Vigils gun is amazing and his ability is good for lower ranks where they can't make out your location by the vigil interference. And bb6 is good for maps like kafe where there are tons of good window spots
---
Why don‚Äôt they do anything to fix it. I love the game but I hate it at the same time. FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME UBISOFT PLEASE FOR ONCE HOLY SHIT MOTHERFUCKING DUMBASSES.

Nothing wrong with maining only if that‚Äôs all they play

On this site it can slow down a push from construction side. Also that first barricade prevents an enemy at construction stair from prone peeking down the hallway. Gives your roamer now time to rotate through/above meeting hall or down main stair.

why did this hurt.

Oops. No I wasn't aware.  
---
It's jaw dropping how teammates can't hold an easily defendable path sometimes.
---
And better damage or a decent fall off range. And wanna know what her recoil is now? Horizontally it's random which in a competitive game which siege wants to be that's kinda bull. Or if they don't want to buff her gun, which is the worst gun in game first off. They could change her secondary gadgets so that they can actually be of use to her replace both with say a camera and another with that censor gadget that's been in game for god knows how long. It'd be perfect as it'd make her a great roamer and operator for intel.
---
Dudes a legend. Makes Siege comics all the time.

That's morbid tho
---
No point calling it ranked if a diamond Derank to copper IV on his Smurf then boosts his plat I friend. if you wanna play with your copper friend then that should burden you not everyone else. I'm not the one choosing to play with a copper IV so why do I get punished by versing insanely good players
---
Yes
---
IQ is looking to Hibana, Hibana to me :v
---
Every recoil nerfs hits harder on console compared to PS4. SMG12 and B9 both needs a buff.

My friend always says this when he's the last one alive in a 1v5 two stories above the objective.

Nice what other black ice do you have

Bruh, not even cav could get‚Äôm
---
i dont know how to turn off g-sync but i can try turning on raw input! thank you anyways

Man I would kill for Ash, Jager, or bandit black ice. I‚Äôve only gotten it for pistols and shotguns since I switched to PC
---
It's Payday Fellas!
---
Ok
---
I love reverse friendly fire because suicide is so much more fun
---
try getting a 5 man to help but not like get golds get other teammates as the same rank as you
---
M870, not a bad gun but i'll never use it in ranked so I consider it a "bad black ice".

From where i was sitting much less "defence" and much more they tried to take the fight to them. Then again i was sitting 2f tower so my perspective of site wasnt great but i know all but 1 of my teammates died out of site.

---
when i made that joke i laughed so hard with you joe. congrats on hella awards
---
I want jager black ice so i have a really good reason to be an ash jager main

but that would entail telling them whats inside the canister and thus smoke would have to kill all of them

Yeah. The rare few times I use her, I use angled grip and she's bomb.

then dont play! Its that easy!

you are using cav's pistol , am i right ?

If it worked like that then boosting would be off the charts. " Oh, we're losing? Alt f4" now my buddy loses less elo

It is

Thats your response? Then dont do sgit in life cause its not worth it, am i right? /s

It would even out because both sides would have more utility to take the other teams extra shit out. It would just be a little more spam

no but if you wanna blame toxicity on someone else and WHINE about it we dont want you here, feel free to leave or stay but dont complain about it! Thats just spreading it and wont do jack shit about the issue
---
SUPPRESIVE FIRE
---
When you put it that way then yeah maybe it‚Äôs better this way
---
Take time to learn it. You‚Äôll learn when to burst and when (and how) to full auto. Take it from an Ela main

I just got emotional and talked about how hard the toxicity is on me and idk I just felt bad and wanted reassurance bc I have bad anxiety.

I don't currently have access to it, not home

He said he'd upload it to his feed, so if he did that you can find it on Dasraider4503's profile on Xbox.
---
Other comments are saying it has to do with vsync. Maybe that's it, I'll check back in about half an hour
---
In the visual settings on all platforms there‚Äôs this setting called ‚ÄúV-sync‚Äù and when you turn it off it uncaps the frame rate in Thunt and Situations, but it causes a small thing called tearing where when you spin around you see multiple of the same object.

---
If you played cav then that's normal because Cavs pistol always downs the enemy even if it was a headshot.
---
There are only a few circumstances where this isn't true such as:
---
&gt;headshotting rappeling enemies with Cavs pistol leads to an one shit headshot kill
---
&gt;Headshotting downed enemies in the head is a headshot kill.
---
&gt;Terrorists in THunt don't get downed so headshots are a one hit kill against them as cav.
---
I‚Äôm scared
---
My bad i didn't check the latest graph, i remember probably the one before this she was the highest, i saw it on a Gat_flanked video
---
Press f to pay respects
---
Wasnt that aware it was spreading.. i just got back playing after just a few days and all the games i played something like that happened. I am used to having like 2 or 3 matches where i encounter toxic people. But all of them?
---
no it wouldn't it would entail him giving them some of the custom filters he uses for his own mask...perhaps in exchange for some custom magpul parts since he's the only guy using that crap in the entire SAS
---
Fake. There‚Äôs no way that Rook wouldn‚Äôt have ran out to spawnpeek you and the rest of your team
---
That‚Äôs the point of the joke..
---
Let me call you out on your lack of game knowledge.
---
&gt;You tell me she's good at killing roamers? i tell you, a montagne pushing with jackal/nomad is even more effective
---
That's 2 operators instead of one, you're not wasting potential utility with Nokk though.
---
&gt;Look at nomad, an AR with 1x sight and pistol to engage every range
---
The pistol has been nerfed badly, her ARs are undeniably below average.
---
&gt;Unlike FMG9 whose drop off is quicker than mp5sd.
---
All the SMGs have the same drop off, except a few released after the damage drop-off optimisation patch.
---
&gt;Nokk can also see more play in pro league due to having an acog
---
No, Nokk isn't supposed to be good against organised teams, highly doubt an acog would change that.
---
&gt;If devs would have released her same as lion i believe her loadout would be an AR/acog ALONG WITH a secondary auto gun like CZ75
---
Yeah. We don't want another lion though. You should be glad.
---
&gt;There's no gun better than mp5sd you can give to nokk and increase her versatability
---
There's several guns that could make her more versatile that don't have an ACOG. If you really want long range (although you shouldn't want it, I'll explain later) there's the UMP, C1 or M12.
---
&gt;buffing FMG9 makes no sense because Nokk needs versatibility for fighting various ranges.
---
NO! An operator cannot be good at everything. Let operators stay in their lane for people who enjoy that kind of playstyle. Find a different op instead of forcing other ones to work just for you.
---
yes some say they just take elements of different characters.. nothing new.
---
It's ok, don't need to apologize :)
---

I love this haha

I like armory because of that corner with the two unbreachable walls that faces the wall towards security. If they open up a hole in it, I‚Äôm protected from the front, so I can get them as they run in.

they have a deal with EG's I'm pretty sure so it'll be on the EGS
---
cause no one ever said anything about good competition like doing it the commie way (buying out devs to steal from your competitors and kill the games industry while you're at it)
---
And that's why dogs are better.
---
If the IEDs recharge like lesion s mines it would be better so you could make a chain reaction like gp in lol
---
That is true. Maybe if it spread in a line the width of a doorway and 5m long or something. Then it would be better.
---
Is it now? 
---
I've just unlocked rank and the two matches I've played, there were diamonds on the opposite team. Needless to say, ended up losing both xD
---
Well done.

Saying "just get better" isnt a legitimate response when its casual, I'm not trying to play my best I'm just playing with my friends and fucking around.

Gottem
---
400 IQ
---
That's pretty cool. I was surprised by just how many they've added over the years, there's a real variety now.  
---
I'm also surprised there's really only two modes, casual and ranked. There's potential for other modes, like a mode where you have no abilities, etc.
---
If I get mad at siege (which happens more often than I care to admit lol) my German Shepherd runs over and jumps up on my shoulders and nuzzles me to cheer me up.
---
Everything has an advantage and a disadvantage. One can't have both. That's not how anything works. You are to capitalize on the advantage and overcome the disadvantages with your play.
---
You get better hipfire and hipfire-to-ads spread transition with lasers, essentially reducing your overall TTK, but compromise your position THAT IS IF you are bad at positioning. So, work on that.
---
To answer your question, no, it isn't too much to ask, but it isn't needed.
---
Stop playing casual?

Hello ottovondabsburg, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c49cvk/my_game_keeps_crashing_as_soon_as_i_enter_a_match/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Main reason why I quit the game unless if I  have friends that want to play together once in a  blue moon, used to play rank for a few seasons solo until I just got pissed off out of it quite literally.
---
I would consider myseld better then average back then but theres  no way I could beat plat players on the opposite team when they were playing there best in my silver/gold league games.
---
I decided that a lot of my lost games where because of unfair elo matchmaking which makes no fckkng sense to this day that Ubi keeps this trash system...
---
I started playing back yesterday and I saw they are banned, what happened?
---
what is the purple rank?
---
My friend just had a streak of over 30 commons in a row. A streak that he broke with an uncommon.
---
Caught u mirin bro
---
If you aren‚Äôt trying then expect to get your ass beat by people who are, it‚Äôs not that complicated
---
You had no idea they changed anything until an hour ago but suddenly you know WHY they did it? k
---
She doesn't need any changes. She is extremely powerful in the right hands, and her gadget is incredibly useful. On top of that, she has a good SMG, a nitro cell, and a pocket shotgun. Making her 2-2 would make Mira OP.
---
Suppressive fire! Of course it works, some people still forget about the basics
---
Imo it shouldn‚Äôt be. I want to play ranked, not pro league. If people want to play pro league, there are plenty of options such as esl.
---
Understandable but after losing 20 matches in a row you'd think that I'd get matched against similarly experienced players.
---
&gt;!IQ LOOKS \*-\*.!&lt;
---
*is it just me*
---
That's what I was thinking but it would be more like an explosive frost mat than an actual mine. The only reason i was thinking other than shooting it is because then the offense wouldn't really have a chance to safely disarm them like a normal trap so it would be too much of an advantage to the defense
---
Kk
---
wtf
---
I third this third
---
Ah okay, I actually have it on the pistol too, I have 7 black ices in total
---
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GLUE YOU BACK TOGETHER... IN HELL!!
---
N√∏kk is good but annoying, and warden is kinda trash
---
I have a cat that likes to jump on my desk and stand in front of my monitor lol
---
Ah right
---
well as you can see I'm a spastic who hasn't studied economy and all :D
---
That was an idea, but I think that would be too many IEDs, thats why I went with 3, based off of old Kapkan having 3 E.D.Ds that could one shot.
---
I mean..... as someone who paid 25,000 for ALL DLC ops before price reductions were a thing, after paying renown for ALL base ops before they went free for a bit and finally after paying for ALL attachments.... It's a tad hard for me to feel bad for all the people who get attachments for free and get up to 15,000 off of a ton of the ops.

Try Restarting  the game
---
Haven‚Äôt we already seen his elite? I think it looks horrible.
---
I have died many times
---
There's really no down side to playing ranked with PL rules though...
---
Like you aren't playing pro league, you're just playing ranked. Siege is the only game I know that has 3 subsets of rules for their modes. Most games have a chill playlist and then their competitive mode. The competitive mode just has the same rules through all levels of play.
---
Why siege doesn't do that, I have no idea. Pick and ban is awesome, and if we could just get the PL map rotation at this point it'd be great. Certain maps are disallowed in PL because they're recognized as bad maps for competitive play.
---
congrats to you!
---
A moment of silence for my fallen comrade
---
the elite got leaked already?
---
Holy shit
---
As a Mira main, I DO NOT WANT HER ALTERED. DO NOT TOUCH HER. I REPEAT, DO NOT TOUCH HER. She is very, very, VERY balanced.
---
new pro league strat
---
"Heard you was talking shit."
---
Yeah, that makes sense. My idea of safely getting rid of them would be to shoot them from farther away, outside of their radius.
---
I also third this
---
\*Insert MOUSEpad joke\*
---
In my opinion, every operator should get the Vortex sight as a alternative to the Holo respectively Reflex.
---
had to look it up. yhea that looked really bad. could look good with another gas mask and tweaked color palette on uniform.
---
It‚Äôs always, ‚ÄúWhy are the White Masks...‚Äù and not, ‚ÄúHow are the White Masks?‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs happened to me. I get it if I restart the game though
---
Yeah, he's like a rioter
---
Imagine Jeager spawn peaking with an RPG
---
I managed to fuze myself when i got a clustercharge stuck in a ceiling...
---
Read the rules.
---
I had to look 5 times to recognize theres castle
---
Only problem with that is just like everyone has done with siege since it came out is exploit anything that can be and I can already think of multiple ways to do so
---
Really? Ok I'll try and I'll let ya know.
---
How did you get this far in the game?? I always get kicked before this

---
And folks this is what a beta looks like.
---
Ok then leave dog I'm having a good time playing the game.
---
Oh
---
Lmao are you a copper
---
Clever ;D
---
If your argument is (or if I have understood you correctly), you're saying pick and ban makes all maps evenly sided. If that's correct then I do concede my arguments.
---
Your second paragraph: yes you're supposed to win the advantaged rounds, I was particularly talking about making a mistake specifically beyond round 4 at 3-0 and how the consequences are different for each team.
---
&gt; also, if you lost all 3 first rounds (remember that means 3 different sites) maybe the problem is not the side switch... why would you assume that you would have won otherwise?
---
Not sure what you mean here, there are many reasons to lose, maybe one team is just bad but I'm talking about specific scenarios where both teams are equal in ability and the map is biased.
---
Wow. It worked after I restarted. Thanks
---
Stop acting like you aren't ugly in real life ugly ass

---
I‚Äôm actually not. But that‚Äôs not what this is about. That‚Äôs also not what a beta means either. Only betas don‚Äôt know what beta means.
---
Fifth highest ttk of all defender weapons, zero recoil, and a large mag. It‚Äôs a top 5 defender gun

Its basically Murphy's law. Anything that can be exploited, will be exploited.

So all 45 million people who play this game are morons as well?

Yep
---
He‚Äôs saying if the defenders ran out from the first floor, could they then take the ladder back up to the second floor
---
Genius haha
---
If a map is incredibly defender favored than when the enemy goes 3-0 you should also be able to win three in a row when you go to defense. If you lose 4-0 it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre the inferior team who lost on a defender favored map
---
Genuinely thought this was bait, you actually think story mode and situations prepares you against real human beings with brains and emotions? Lmao

Nice one, I think I‚Äôve screwed this op already because I‚Äôm getting like 60mmr and it goes lower and lower every game right? Doesn‚Äôt go back high until a new op. I‚Äôm stuck low gold 4 right now don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get back to plat unless me and my friend find a 5man which is hard. Every game getting trolls or people without mics.

Ass internet and ass aim. Don‚Äôt blame anything but you lmao

Good job on making the responsible decision to hold off then haha.
---
Dude same the fucker keeps attacking my mouse and for some reason likes to get in front of the screen while I play
---
They should limit the mmr you're allowed to play with
---
Since then both Microsoft and Sony have licensed official keyboard and mice for their consoles. 
---
With absolutely no warnings within the game at all it will be incredibly unlikely they ever take action on. 
---
Sounds like support just telling someone what they want to here, Especially when you look at the way they write the reply, Seems fake. 
---
Its either not allowed in the game or it is, Being in casual or ranked should not affect it and also simple spelling mistakes. 
---
"Cheating" is cheating, Regardless of the game mode.  Seriously doubt thats official. 
---
There is still no official statement anywhere other then a photo of a messenger conversation.
---
Yea, I know. I usually squad up with someone, but they're moving, so I really can't do anything about it. It's still annoying though lol
---
i agree but her shotgun is still an op mess. the only reason it hasn't gotten any nerfs is because everyone is focused on her smg and how op it was and up it is.

Bro you have no clue how much shit someone gets if they use the GSh-18 over the PMM, I make a simple comment explaining why I prefer it and it gets downvoted to hell. People are just fucking toxic in this subreddit.
---
I play on the PS4, it happened to me like 2 times in ranked without getting out of the match. Idk if it were the Ubisoft servers or someone bugging the game. But they have to do something about it
---
And just like that, monty is banned
---
No, i answered his statement that there is no warden on the attacking team
---
And I know it was not my internet bc I was with my friend and he also was extremely laggy he said. Also, the ping of everyone went to 500
---
Now go get an ace you sweaty ash ;)
---
New plan, tape a laser pointer to the mouse, so whenever you move the mouse it moves the laser on the wall, cat chases laser, game time is safe lol
---
Automatic headshots here I come!
---
My favorite part is you throwing the drown directly into the wall.
---
Genius trying this tonight
---
this is cool, but it would be a pretty situational op and would depend on the map since this op would be broken on consulate and Hereford while being useless on skyscraper, bank, and border
---
Dont worry, all cats can ollie. Its in their nature!
---
Credit the homie

Yeah but most people know that by now

While I don‚Äôt disagree that birchwood is nice, I think that it‚Äôs undeserving of legendary. Rare or epic, at most

Chalet is honestly unplayable, none of the sites are viable EVEN WITH  the new pick and ban. Skyscraper is shockingly stale and relies entirely on your team fragging out.

Boom boom &gt; hostage. My mate Fuze knows whats up

My only problem is the insane number of 90 degree long angles. Honestly, I just play Finka LMG and rush every round. There's literally no point in trying to play it properly tbh.

Oh I didn't realize that lol. My bad
---
The lobby has been created and the games starts when 10 players joins the lobby 
---
It‚Äôs been in the game since beginning
---
Chad?
---
Anecdotal evidence. Hereford is far easier to defend (depending on the site) than attack, you probably just fought bad players.
---
Love the bayonet. Great cosplay!

Very nice

Is smoke actually that short?

Still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Chalet and Skyscraper need improvements.

Jaeger Corps is army, the other is navy, you can‚Äôt be reassigned military branches and even if she was she would still need Jaeger Corp training

Heeeeere's Johnny!

This is amazing! But how many would said operator carry? I‚Äôm thinking like 2, but I didn‚Äôt make it so... How many?
---
Wow I hate that another country has a version of a game that I won‚Äôt play that has no affects on how I play the game whatsoever. LOL stop hating kid get a life.

Nomad more realistic than echo?

I got mine by following Ubisoft‚Äôs official account on WeChat. It didn‚Äôt have any information that this charm had a limited number of distribution, so I‚Äôm just curious about that.
---
Give us the option to play pro league maps only
---
Yes, I don't like it at all. I posted another progress pic on my insta with no makeup on (just to show the outfit) and everyone was like "Lol Chinese version of Cav"
---
In my opinion it has to be the Hibana elite, it looks cool, the gun skins it comes with are awesome and it‚Äôs an all around cool skin.
---
Can you make this in more pick phases or just in 1 pick phase?
---
People can use whatever guns they want, different playstyles benefit from different guns, you had no reason to say what you did, he may have been overly rude, but so were you.
---
Thanks!!
---
That's some subpar N√∏kk gameplay. Appearing is illegal. These breaching charges? They're so you can explode yourself as a punishment if someone spots you.
---
There is no vote to kick on ranked
---
Chinese Iron Man
---
This is a rework, so more like kafe.
---
I have tested this on my second ps4 account, and btw when you gameshare or make a second account using the same disc or purchase of the game you don‚Äôt get any ops at all, only recruit. So if you load up a ranked you just can‚Äôt select an operator, not even what kind of weapon you want one the recruit. I don‚Äôt think Ubisoft would look into this because it only affects smurf accounts that does not buy any ops.
---
When they had it i hated it
---
If any head shot kills you, helmet or not, then why not die in style?
---
Just a bunch of handsome dudes
---
Every map is defender biased according to pro league, now what?
---
They've already posted pics and they're rebuilding it from scratch
---
Well good job taking your time writing this long thing that I‚Äôm not even gonna finish reading üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø bravo dumbass

Well your only option now is to use it with recruit

That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so damn jacked

LMFAO, This shit happened against my squad. We were telling Ela you're fucked mate. LMFAO this is siiiiiiiick
---
Aside form the sound blast thing, Echo is perfectly fine. Well except for having an ACOG on an SMG.
---
Warden has infra-red goggles combined with a welding mask.
---
~~IQ~~
---
Whoever you like playing as the most, my favourites are IQ, hibana and bandit
---
Sometimes I‚Äôd rather just take the abandon or surrender everytime I get it
---
Ever heard of a welding mask?
---
Nice.
---
Exploits that assholes have to abuse and Ubisoft can't properly fix
---
I really like that Echo ornament/decoration mask
---
Why does it fit mute so well??
---
A while ago the PDW was the only smg on attacking side and Jager had the only AR on defending. Now the FMG9 joined the attackers (correct me if Im wrong but I think thats all)

I strongly disagree that Mira is a D lol

this is quite cool and could be a good addition to the r6 team   
---
however, How are they going to transport it?
---
It's a desync issue, Ubisoft sucks on that part. I've lost a rank match because I rubberbanded  through a hole I made after crouching through it. Spent the last few seconds s cursing as I couldn't enter

How is it useless on bank?  You would 100% want this OP when they pick office.  Also would be decent on border for armory.  Skyscraper... yeah you wouldn‚Äôt really ever be able to use it besides the north window that looks into the office site.  
---
But I know what you mean some maps only have like 1-2 possible windows, it would hve to be able to be put on a window at your height as well, and honestly I think it would be way broken if your movement wasn‚Äôt limited like it would be on some stairs.

One sided mirrors already exist, making one portable isn't the most unrealistic thing. This is about the gadgets themselves not them storing them on themselves.

Fixed! Sorry for the typo!

4-0 ranked is ez money, play only ranked and it'll come casually

No luck all skill

Wait. I didn‚Äôt even see how u were grading these. Lmfao nvm
---
This is a realism tier list, D means she's realistic. IMO Zofia is an S tier operator. Please read the title.
---
Big ol' repost there bud
---
yeah, what I've tryina get at is that the op is pretty situation, and would not have much use after the initial breach
---
Get pranked epic style
---
Hacking into 5 peoples phones at the same time with no connection at all, one I could get, but with how quick she does it to all 5 is insane.
---
Mav and Dokk are semi realistic, certainly more so then everyone else in the tier. 
---
Not sure how Ela gets A but Zof gets D. Valk has at least some basis in reality, more a C then an A. 
---
How in the fuck is Cav, Thatcher, and Therm not realistic? Thatcher is a little out there with the man portable EMP but its not outside of the realm of reality.
---
How the fuck did you put Maestro and Twitch as more realistic then Cav? What?
---
What on earth is the Lesion placement? How is a regenerating invisible gu mine realistic in any capacity?

Imagine the bugs

The beauty about this game is it‚Äôs all about experience and practise. 
---
Keep playing casual/ranked. 
---
You are only level 90. Learn from you‚Äôre mistakes. Sometimes losing is more important then winning so don‚Äôt get upset if you mess up.
---
Night love you too
---
Clash is the funnest because you can play her while stoned without fucking things up for the rest of the team.
---
I think it is trypophobia
---
Better bring those claymores for that first floor runout
---
Clash and shields are still completely banned. Thanks Ubi
---
Delta squad is more "breach and clear" type extractions, where as Rangers are more find and rescue missions.
---
Rangers typically work in more open environments than Delta, which is mostly building to building work, typically Siege material. Plus, how did you even find this post?
---
Kitten is important. You'll have to push your siege career back for few months to a year. Or you can learn to sit with your legs closed together, so the kitten would have a warm surface to snuggle up on. Kitten is important.
---
The problem with this is that multiple people have claymores, and Nomad's gadget is not meant to kill, while claymores are.
---
You spike to 229 ms and the connection icons come up

Have the operator played by Norman reedus
---
I agree. This would make another entrance to each room and shake up defense strats and tactics.
---
Whenever I take it slow 9/10 I‚Äôll get shot in the back, teamkilled or rushed and die even though I basically emptied a mag into their head.
---
I‚Äôd love to use teamwork except the community is hyper toxic.
---
I only use maybe 8 in total
---
Tachanka is fun and all if his LMG didn't have such insane recoil, and its basically signing up to by last friendly standing.
---
No? They gave the upper hand away by not playing time.
---
Carry harder idiot
---
It sounds stupid
---
I guess that‚Äôs correct
---
Do you play PC, Xbox, PlayStation? 
---
Also what Ops do you use frequently?
---
Fully deployed shield on the back (!)
---
On attack Jackal, sledge, dokkabi, twitch, and any with an lmg because dakka.  On defense bandit, vigil, doc, frost, and mira.
---
This would be brokenly OP, worse than Blackbeard even on certain maps...  And hes already the best fragger in the game at high levels.  Who upvoted this?
---
Look like brothers tbh
---
WELL BOY OH BOY, YOU THOUGHT BLACKBEARD WAS BAD? THEN DO I HAVE THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.
---
For me it‚Äôs only because it is banned currently. If she wasn‚Äôt i wouldn‚Äôt care about echo
---
There are also modern solutions https://imgur.com/a/ZlifWC0
---
There are pretty thicc defenders tbh.
---
Just in case you didn‚Äôt notice, there was a defuser planted.  If they were going to play time then they would have 100% lost.  They needed to push him so they could defuse.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs packin‚Äô shmeat

GET READY FOR THE NEXT BATTLE
---
No, I placed platinum
---
Attack: Capitao, Twitch, Fuze, BB, and Mav DMR of course
---
Defense: Echo, Maestro, Frost, Tachanka just to break all the walls, Smoke because there is no better push preventer for me
---
Buck is still a good buy his gadget is really useful and his gun isn‚Äôt that bad if you want you could use the dmr instead
---
What do you mean, like what specifically are you confused about.
---
I would like to knw too
---
It‚Äôs not a good rank, but the average player is high silver/low gold. So you placed average.

when you go to operate but the coffee hits

She can turn invisible or something

*angry French, Japanese, and German noises*
---
*visibly tweaking* You want some drugs kid?
---
Fair enough
---
It's moments like this that make me think the timer should just be shorter. Like if you can't defuse it anymore, then just end it?
---
yeah, gold is good. maintaining it might be hard for new players though, because of map knowledge and other stuff
---
Cum at me bruv
---
Have people watching the window while defusing then.
---
Like is it completely against rules to share any of my gameplay from my channel or is there just certain limitations or are there other ways to share my channel with people?
---
I'm relatively new to R6, although I bought the game in 2017. What's all the hype with the Black Ice skin? Is it because a lot of people like it for how it looks, or is there something else?
---
Nah she can't go invisible it's just another glitch with her where she goes into the ground and you can only see her when you look at the ground. Not as op as the the other one.
---
Fuze set Glaz up for a heart attack
---
Before the this season started she could go invisible 
---
Ubisoft claimed to fix it
---
They didn‚Äôt not
---
Attacker: Monty, Blitz, Fuze, Ying, Finka with Shotgun
---
Defense: Tachanka, Clash, Alibi with Shotgun, Doc spawnpeek, Lesion gu tower
---
The symbols on top right
---
Not that I know of. Im pretty sure its ok but i would check the sub rules if you haven't already.
---
No retreat, no surrender
---
That‚Äôs how you get prefired because they already know where you would be to defuse lol.  The best move IS to push them, they just messed it up in every way possible.
---
me: \*has depression\*  
---
also me: \*has a cat allergy\*
---
***FUCK***
---
So he carries around a ladder in his pocket?
---
And when you prefire the defusing person the other three could still kill him. Nobody left alive to stop the defuse anymore. Atleast if you don't potato.
---
WOAH, TIME TRAVELERS FROM 2015, THEY STILL FIND LORD MEMES FUNNY
---
You can't? Why?
---
Maybe a drone that comes when you lock the position where you want to put the gadget and deploys the ladder ?
---
Because i can so heck off. smoke nis trash btw his gadget is ass just walk thru it
---
if i see a comment with that many downvotes i really can't help it
---
Thank you !!
---
Oh shit i got it mixed hahah. But yea I‚Äôm a high gold, and i promise you, i‚Äôve played 15 matches in 2 days and 11 of them had at least 1 mouse and key player. 3 matches had an entire MnK team, and 6 of them had 2 players, and 2 of them had 1. I promise u gold 1 and 2 is filled with MnK. Even in gold 3 and 4 I‚Äôm facing fucking mouse and key players. Literally the last match i played like 30 minutes ago had an entire spawnpeeking MnK 5 stack with pro league skins who 4-0‚Äôd my entire team
---
i believe mozzie has an AR

Yo I got that for my first legendary

Now for a black beard to camp that.

Lmao hacker got what he deserved
---
And a good way to counter anything similar to the IQ bug where she‚Äôs half in the floor is get atop something (apparently this keeps her from harming you)
---
Well he knows what head he really thinks with I guess
---
It‚Äôs kinda funny though
---
Some militaries use tactical ladders today, so it could easily be retracted and placed on the attackers back
---
It's not even much better is casual. You can be on a team with one or two guys over 50 and the other team is ALL over a hundred.
---
I miss IQ.... shes actually useful and not just situational like clash.
---
It's amusing that you assume I'm a woman, and then automatically start mansplaining to me.
---
Random 20 inch objects aren't the same thing as windows. Random 20inch objects aren't your only way, with the exception of doors, of entering a room. Don't make such stupid arguments.
---
COVER ME!!!
---
If you got into a game when you opened it then after the game finishes you be shown wat you got on the alpha pack.
---
Defender side should be electrified or some shit
---
It explains that too. Some pseudoscience about speeding up ATP production to cancel out the flash.
---
*Psssssst*
---
Hey kid, wanna buy some armor pannels?
---
Wallet Warriors
---
Imagine 1 maestro on his evil eyes with 4 aldas holding angles
---
And in the prep phase too
---
The no vaulting from inside mechanic could also come back to bite you later. Like if it‚Äôs a risky thing to vault into the room or it‚Äôs the only way out, you‚Äôd have to completely commit to the room you vault into then, and it would cut off your escape then.
---
Probably three months. Right before new season
---
Played it when it was introduced! It acted like a headshot and showed a picture of a squirrel. Them were the days.
---
Thanks! Most of my squad play useful ops such as Hibana, Thatcher, etc. so I usually play Zofia, who is useful, but I think Montagne will really help our squad especially in ranked.
---
Ah fuck me
---
Steam
---
Exactly.
---
The hostage won‚Äôt stand a chance with these upgrades
---
Ah yes, because level and rank matter in relation a charm's rarity
---
Eh, I normally rely on my teammates for that
---
Wouldn‚Äôt this cause an issue in a bomb plant or hostage situation. Image getting up to a window, grabbing a hostage, and not being able to get out said window.
---
*Reverse Card*
---
Whaaat?

It'll probably be better to wait till then, the game's a fucking mess right now

Tactical ladder
---
Nice, I almost chose IQ and Nokk myself.

Blitz was coming for dat ass, only thing worse than that is turning a corner and staring right at the barrel of Cav‚Äôs Luison
---
Say that to defenders about Metal baricade reinforcement
---
Been like this every single season. 1st week is season pass owner getting access to new operators, 2nd week is non-season pass owner getting access to new operators, 3rd week is when they sell these Pro League set.
---
However, they changed the weekly challenges from Tuesday to Thursday, so I'm not sure if this will be affected. Also, starting from Nomad, Kaid, they don't have the operation season flag anymore, they are supposed to have Australian season flag. This is the same for Mozzie, Gridlock which both are still having Australian flag when they are supposed to have Phantom Sight season flag but there is no new map being added in Phantom Sight season, so Mozzie, Gridlock, Ash, Rook won't have flag.
---
Imagine playing hostage
---
Usually at the beginning of every season
---
Bruhh I‚Äôm not bout to check the whole sub
---
Also as per my original comment about it being vulnerable to run outs, I mean more of a defender running out from first floor and catching you while you‚Äôre on the ladder, not vaulting out at you. But I still love this idea and wish we could see it in game one day.
---
They're both really good with organised teams, but I'd say the iq ban is worse because echo and lesion
---
Pc already got the IQ 2d model patch. Console will get it this week. 
---
On PC ubisoft can push updates a lot faster than console platforms due to how the verification for updates work on console.
---
Shit wasn‚Äôt there just one I‚Äôve been waiting to play forever

How do you know they're mnk? I was accused of being mnk yet I'm not. People are generally getting good at the game and just aiming better.
---
Can never be too damn safe

Is it weird that the first thing I thought is how the hell are you gonna get through a reinforced wall?

If you consider the behavior of those players inappropriate, consider filing a report to [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/SignIn?nextUrl=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.ubi.com%2fru-RU%2fCases%2fNew).

Posting it here will result in absolutely nothing.

Or just no ladder at all. Make it one of those machine rappel things, forgot what they are called. That you can quickly zip up to a window or roof without having to walk all the way through and as a nice touch let him/her be able to rappel up hatches so it can be just as usefull inside.
---
Console
---
Hard work, outta doors
---
They did lol
---
Holy hell that pisses me off when I get pinned against that, I‚Äôm over here at silver one against low plat, high gold, as tho Ubi is just saying fu
---
Just remove her barb wire and give her impacts or a bullet-proof camera
---
You said this to a supposed lesion main at that.
---
yea, they really need to get a better matchmaking system for this
---
Half-smirk makes it, evil looking lol
---
Im currently working on one of those longer "operator idea" posts you usually see on here with the fancy infographic, but I wanted to get some opinions on the icons I made in paint.net
---
No. It‚Äôs been like that for a while.
---
IMO I think it should be similar to blackbeard's shield. Or somewhere between mira and blackbeard, but regardless, defenders should be able to take out the mirror and not the whole ladder system.
---
I know King George does, I actually run a stat tracker (siegestats.com) and track King Georges main account. And a few other big streamers on thier mains and Smurfs. 
---
I don't mind big names having Smurfs cause they need anonimity every once and while. 
---
I don't mind how you do your Smurf. But I do think it's being dishonest mainly with yourself. I'm a stats freak I love them hence building a site to track siege matchs. I feel you can use stats to improve your game and find your weakness's. I've looked at my numbers when playing with various squad mates, and there are definitely some we win with more then others. And that informs me which combination of our players will make our best ranked squad. Actually working on some code to automate that. But I only play on one account, and can not bring myself to making a Smurf

Bro u can literally tell the difference between good controller aim and good PC aim. There gets to be a point where it isn‚Äôt just ppl playing on high sensitivity or who have really good reaction times, you can literally see what an MnK player looks like. Incredibly agressive lean and crouch spam, ungodlike quickness when snapping on to a target, you can just tell. I can admit when i get outskilled cuz im not even the best player in my friend group but the way these kids play is indicative of MnK.
---
that‚Äôs another problem i can‚Äôt talk on discord it won‚Äôt work it‚Äôs wack
---
May I restate this, "So ubi, when are you gonna fix the whole game?"
---
It's horrible
---
Not much more I can say with a mouth full of come
