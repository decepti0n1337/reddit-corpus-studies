There‚Äôs gift cards.

Christmas is coming, ask that to your parents, not on Reddit.

gridlock/wamai/and kali I guess
---
honestly the rest I could go without ever buying them. nokk, amaru, clash, warden, goyo, they're not all useless they're just situational and not that fun
---
My parents said they wouldn‚Äôt buy me anything video game related for Christmas...

wamai

Then there‚Äôs nothing to do about it, don‚Äôt go on Reddit to ask a stranger to give you a game.

how many people do not fucking understand that the holograms rely on attacker reflexes and muscle memory. they are there for attackers to flick onto because they will shoot at anything that looks like a defender most of the time. if you are trying to pretend you are hologram then you are playing her entirely wrong

ubi plz, i am tired of playing Alibi and meanwhile she gets skins, the holo dont...

You can still buy the game right now, the only thing stopping you is your temporary annoyance. And after playing it on PC for a while you'll buy those cosmetics again because you want them. This is the highest probability outcome for most consumers of the game looking to go multi platform and it will make Ubisoft more money. Which is why I referred you to my first comment because we're going to keep looping back to that answer

??? People constantly talk shit about how the comsetics are trash in this game. You must be on a different subreddit.

Yeah I don‚Äôt get the point of the cam on frost. I guess it‚Äôs to bait the enemy to coming towards it to melee it but they get trapped? It‚Äôs stupid and I‚Äôd rather have barbed wire but whatever I guess.

I hate people who run out as a team just to kill one guy

Wtf happened?

Forget about keeping state secrets, PMCs in the Clancy-verse have a disturbingly high tendency of going rogue in disastrous ways from:
---
1. Instigating a new Korean War (*Splinter Cell¬Æ Chaos Theory* &amp; *Ghost Recon¬Æ 2*)
---
2. Attempting to assassinate a sitting President (*Splinter Cell¬Æ Conviction*)
---
3. Attempting to nuke the United States (*Ghost Recon¬Æ Advanced Warfighter 2*)
---
4. Doing the exact opposite of what their contract specified by instead taking control of the drug trade (*Ghost Recon¬Æ Wildlands*)
---
5. *Waging war* against the United States for militarily intervening on its turf in Latin America (*H.A.W.X.*)
---
6. Again, doing the exact opposite of their contract by seizing control of the island and forcibly weaponising drone tech (*Ghost Recon¬Æ Breakpoint*)
---
Harry has the excuse of the last two happening after *Siege* since *H.A.W.X.* takes place in 2021 and *Breakpoint* in 2023, but I wouldn't be all that surprised if NIGHTHAVEN has something to do with *Rainbow Six¬Æ Quarantine*.

One time i went to shoot out a window with glaz and got a one tap first shot

I just don‚Äôt understand why ‚ÄúVote to Kick‚Äù went from every game mode to just Casual. If anything you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd leave it in just Ranked. Why would you need to kick in casual? If someone is TK‚Äôing leave the game and start a new one, it means nothing and takes nothing away. If someone is TK‚Äôin in Ranked we can‚Äôt vote them out at all. Makes no sense to keep it just in the game mode that barely matters.

15k ops are Y3 ops right? I guess in that case I‚Äôd get Zofia, Hibana, Echo, Jackal, Mira, Lesion, or Vigil.
---
N√≤kk
---
What about her logic bomb? Do u use it much?
---
Mozzie for sure. He‚Äôs perfectly balanced but also really strong. By far the best DLC op to be released in a long time.
---
I have a sense of humor. Your images and the other images you posted on Reddit just aren‚Äôt funny and they are shit quality.
---
Use boscacog
---
Somehow this makes me feel like Harry is less competent than the old Six. Ash is not even a PMC but a member of FBI SWAT and was/is a member of the IDF. And yet Harry tells her that he "took her in" when being asked why he let PMCs in Rainbow, as if implying that Ash was a PMC too. Does Ubi even read their own lore anymore?
---
Taking in a PMC that seems to be rather infamous in the universe (shown by Ash being really confused, irritated, and going as far as questioning his decision directly) just because they saved A SINGLE SHIP. What?
---
Unlike actual soldiers, PMCs are only loyal to two things. Money and power. The moment someone pays them more or they can gain more by stabbing Rainbow in the back, they will. Plus with the history of PMC betrayals in Clancyverse. It's just a very reckless decision. Makes his competence look questionable at best.
---
Thanks, I think I'll get Lesion lmao
---
Yeah he‚Äôs probably the best out of all of them. But prepare to be called a bitch.
---
Why look stuff up when you can just make the 900th thread on the topic.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs greek
---
"posting 'I got black ice' posts are against the posting guidelines, unless it's on the front page already." - Mods.

Oh I'm prepared, I've called many a Lesion main a bitch lmao
---
Omg I need all of these, especially IQs
---
OP reposting about a repost of a post and getting 2k upvotes: *I am inevitable*
---
1. Go ahead? My point remains
---
2. Again, if you‚Äôre accidentally shooting teammates that much for RFF to punish you that often, you‚Äôre the problem. Again, still a double edged sword. Less unintentional RFF deaths, but more intentional griefing.
---
3. This isn‚Äôt CSGO and you can literally see your teammates through walls, it‚Äôs not that hard to not shoot your teammates.
---
4. Why take any elo from them? They literally did nothing
---
5. Get better? idk
---
6. If a mira team kills because they got their feelings hurt about a wall, they‚Äôre the one throwing. That teammate is more valuable than a kill hole
---
Man, you really got nothin' huh...lol this infographic the OP shared with us is JUST for you.
---
On launch, yeah he was lacking. After they buffed him a couple times though he‚Äôs quite good at what he‚Äôs supposed to do. Yes he isn‚Äôt gonna get picked all the time but that is just his nature. It‚Äôs kinda like when people pick Frost. First time you pick her, they fall for it, the second time in a row though, people will be more cautious and it won‚Äôt be as effective. Overall he isn‚Äôt the best operator by any means but he isn‚Äôt the worst either, that title is still held by Tachanka.
---
I think I changed it to 91 later.

It do be like that

Dont play a team game by yourself 
---
There is plenty of ways to look for groups to play with.  
---
If you play a team game by yourself you pass up  the right to complain.
---
I'm pretty sure Wamai is an idea requested to the team by a streamer.
---
Siege has been broken lately
---
You mean it allows them to abuse the matchmaking to go against less skilled opponents and ruin the game for the lower ranks
---
Don't forget the Division 1 and 2, where the Last Man Battalion and Black Tusk are bad factions.  
---
Yeah this is why I can't really understand this aspect of the lore. Am I really supposed to believe a PMC is going to be a good guy in a Tom Clancy game? None of it makes sense.

And not the constant Bungie knob slobbing, finger wagging at the whole sub because of complainers (you absolutely can NOT dismiss all of them, D2 is still a shell of D1 by end of Y3) and dad jokes...?

Lol i dropped out of plat on a 9 game losing streak down to sliver 2 then went on a 12 game win streak back at my current rank ü§î?

In one day i think at one point i just said F it and toke the acog off on attack and went fragging never had less than 10 kills . It is called sweating your a$$ off.
---
the turret hit you in the head and you passed out
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone heard us...
---
You don't look exactly like the Prisma, so nobody is relying on that because there is no option to do that.
---
However, unless you're playing with a default Maestro, being able to immediately ignore anything with a red beret counts for something.
---
Just age check, you need to pass this age check to get the adult rated content
---
They did it with Fuze LMG a long time ago so idk why they can't do it for the AUG
---
Probably best not to think too much into it, it's just to sell skins. Lore or reality wise, getting "poached" from a classified LE/military unit is a massive red flag and security breach.
---
Oh yeah that nasty. I personally thought that wamai would be easier to play for someone like me so I got him first. Haven't unlocked Kali yet.

Good...good

NOBODY HAS EVER BLOCKED THIS MOVE BEFORE
---
Yeah. With the discount, the seasonal skins are much cheaper. They disappear when the season ends, so theres probably like 6 different skins you missed. The universal skin and charm are only given to the people that buy the pass before the year actually starts, so you missed out on the Volcanic 6 charm and the volcano universal skin.
---
Repost
---
That's what we in the business call a certified "Retard Fight".
---
Wamai takes more skill than J√§ger because instead of just destroying the grenade snatches it and can kill the enemy team and is more simple than kali so get him first
---
Renown or R6 credits?
---
Hello fellow Lesion main, it'll sting a lot huh?
---
I was impressed with myself, what can I say (I don‚Äôt normally hit stuff like that)
---
Wut?
---
Not as much as getting hit with a mostly plat stack when I‚Äôm in silver
---
Big brain move
---
Or what happens to me, someone sees this guy stand up and run for a doorway and starts shooting him and killing both.
---
He's taking the 'You won't need to dodge bullets' to an entirely new level.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought to do but trying to see if there‚Äôs a way to not have to have 2 separate downloads. 
---
I currently own it on steam
---
It was in a older version of the game, it would take you to the r6 streams
---
Yeah, but sometimes people don't have what I want :c
---
soups
---
Oof
---
Only kali have special voicwlines when an enemy is killed by her, usually are like harsh
---
Lesiom
---
It isn't available early when everyone has it and this is the 4th universal christmas skin tho
---
Lol that‚Äôs not a flick
---
And you repost the post calling out the repost smh my head, head.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have it on steam the way your game is actually ran is by uplay. You shouldn‚Äôt have to download the game again if you just use uplay not steam
---
Mozzie. Nothing quite like seeing annoyed comments from the other team that their drone got hacked

Worst is that half of them on PC usually have walls :\

Only happens on casual or ranked with a group of 4

I dont even have a free one.

Not anymore, I think. They removed the dab dance if I remember ;-;

I know this is a joke, and I‚Äôm not being a prick,  but he doesn‚Äôt paint or anything lol. He says being a sniper is similar to an artist, because of the attention to detail. I‚Äôm just trying to clarify in case you thought Glaz is doing arts ‚Äòn crafts in his free time XD

I thought it was *demoknight tf2*

Lesion. His gadget is incredible for Solo-Queing, all 3 of his guns are great, and his kit is just very excellent overall. Not only is Ela's Scorpion not great, but it's getting Neutered/already got neutered(I can't remember if the update dropped yet). Her gadget can be better, but only in coordinated team comps, plus her lack of impacts on a 3-Speed defender hurts her. Overall, go for Lesion. That's what I did.
---
Yes
---
It's worth it if you honestly enjoy this game
---
...and there are 3 persons who can't reconnect to the match and got abandon penalty somewhere. This happened to me and my mate, we're loosing 3-4, the 2 other guy can reconnect on the last round but we lost 3-5
---
at least, if there is no elo penality if loss, I don't care.
---
K1A and V308

The idea is good, but i dont think that she needs a buff

It‚Äòs not tower, its consulate

You get Festive boi, and you meet some chill doods

Canadian pistol (MK1 9mm) and V308 (Lion)
---
Thank you!

The only reason I‚Äôm not playing ranked is cuz  I haven‚Äôt had time to play consistently so I‚Äôm trying warm up and get back into it
---
Year four
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land?
---
I think I'm kinda experiencing something similar, but it's more or less the absence of certain sounds, like footsteps, the rappel rope sounds, and barricades just don't make any sound. Don't know if those are just me though so I could be wrong
---
Not much of a buff. It's a niche use and is more of a nerf since a cav will just outright kill more likely then try and interro.
---
This is the right way to use casual , like deathmatch where u just sprint and kill everyone
---
Fuck tower
---
Do u know what is faceit?
---
Idk what to tell you man. Not everything has to have some in your face punchline. As to why I think they're getting upvoted or at least why I like them, I just like the art style and the running gags he has, like the one in the post. Ik that's super general but meh. If you don't like them that's obviously fine though.
---
There are few cases you should add muzzle brake on few auto weapons . Like Mozzie's Commando . It turns it into a literal laser
---
No full auto ACOGs on 2 speeds. We have talked about this Jimmy. Any 2 speed full auto acog would be OP.
---
Make him 1 speed and we're good to go.
---
I don't have irl friends in siege but we still talk on whatsapp or like messenger, and I was in a situation similiar to yours but then i realized i should stop playing with them so i did and now i play with a small group of people i really enjoy playing with, i've been playing with them for almost a year now and we're still going strong
---
Lol I am 100% not a professional and I can confidently say that I've spent less time playing than a lot of players, pengu an actual pro has put around 12000+ hours into the game 
---
I'd recommend checking out varsity gaming ,he's got a lot of videos that can help new comers
---
For the attacker or...
---
Holy guacamole fuck shit that‚Äôs a lot of hours wasted
---
&gt;Capitao is underpowered,
---
I don't know where to begin to roast you on how wrong you are, but since you said that that is your opinion,I'll let you pass.
---
Cause cap is so OP and has no counter that he's 75% of the time banned in PL.
---
Warden.
---
Damnit
---
Personally, FH works laser enough for me.
---
But I use it mainly because I hate muzzle flash.
---
He is 1 speed, he always has been...
---
At least Blackbeard put up a bit of a fight 
---
It was my first free weekend aswell
---
You can‚Äôt hack console...... it‚Äôs not possible with the available consoles people are just not able to as there isn‚Äôt any way to put a file onto your Xbox that isn‚Äôt a game save, you can use a save editor but then the server would recognise your account being different to your stats and either reset them back to their old stats or ban you instantly it‚Äôs how Battleye that and Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt pay for their own anti cheat
---
Wouldn't say they're wasted lol. He's won quite a few tournaments and his team is considered one of if not the best siege team in the world (well for a time they were but lately they've been struggling )
---
Dude.......been living under a rock eh?
---
Warden is 2 speed currently.
---
Uhh...no.  Maverick went deep into Afghanistan and got a lot of intel that brought down an entire network.
---
He's also skilled at different languages and is sort of an intellectual.
---
Can‚Äôt hack a console not a next gen
---
Muzzle brake on semi auto guns, flash on everything else
---
OH YEAH THAT PENGU!!! Is that the one from g2???
---
yeah you are missing a lot of things
---
Nope not now not ever you cannot hack a console not next gen at least
---
I agree about everything but the r6 credits part . People would be selling their skins they got from alpha packs and then they can get free elite skins at this case .
---
Oh well. 1 speed again, I guess.
---
You zoomers missed out on the OG planning phase. You commanded NPC operators and planned how they'd clear each room. You could split them into teams and switch between them during the op. 
---
I'd spend more time on the planning menu than the actual raid. And the raids always ended swiftly if I planned it right. When an operator was injured, they were benched for several missions. When an operator was lost, they were lost. So you had to constantly restart the mission.
---
It was the most brutally unforgiving game I've ever played. Tom Clancy wrote the screenplay himself. The narrative may've been a little reactionary for me, but it was still very compelling.
---
Yep that's the one
---
Then the changes are good.
---

Ain't that Alibi?

Uh....I think he means the seasonal skins, not the year pass exclusive skin. So he's talking about palace virtue and others alike.

If you mean the 2 or 3 released every season, no, they don't get them.

my god ur right
---
To answer BOTH interpretations of this question:
---
1) No, you do not get any Seasonal uniform skins from specific Operations, they are only available within the Operation itself. The only second chance you'll get at these is when the uniforms are TWO YEARS OLD, they will be reintroduced through Alpha Packs (i.e. Operation White Noise was two years ago, and now all of those uniforms are RNG possibilities in Alpha Packs. Blood Orchid uniforms came back last season, and it's likely Chimera uniforms will be next). Seasonal Operation exclusive WEAPON skins (with a few very minor exceptions like Black Ice) typically never return at all.
---
2) You DO however get Season Pass uniform skins. Season Pass skins are a single unique uniform and headgear for each operator that releases the year that pass pertains to. These are not purchasable by any other means, and these will not come back, period.
---
And a Year Pass promotional universal weapon skin is only offered in the beginning of the Year Pass being available. This year's was Volcano, last year's was Damascus Steel.

See how much repressive the cheating problem is?   
---
We can't have any feature that would bring more players or more activity for the game, thats pretty sad.
---
I respect your opinion but however It would be ideally a "cool" addiction to the game, don't you think?- (if there was no cheating)
---
Lesion is if not the most overpowered defender right now on defense, on all three platforms. His gadget and weaponry is amazing. His gadget can cancel defuser plants, is almost invisible, make a lot of noise, has a screen effect and deals damage.
---
Meanwhile Ela still kinda has the headshot machine gun and the still pretty good shotgun and an pretty weak gadget imo
---
If you start the game while you are offline you can test out all operators without needing to buy them. But your attachments and equipped weapon skins might be lost in doing so, so be warned (you'll need to re-equip everything)

That c4 tho with Mira!!!

They don't show exactly how he dives into the water but you can free dive from pretty high elevations. 200ft, higher with gear made specifically to reduce impact while parting the water.
---
Let's just assume he's wearing a suit that works for this. Still though incredibly dangerous and not that much better than fast repel into the water with assist (takes seconds) then swimming over (terrorists will wait patiently for him to put his magnetic device on the boat before firing).
---
The real question is here is...how does his magnetic device have the ability to fucking reverse a RPG rocket that's already 200ft away from it.
---
Your plan has no proper room clearing. No flash bangs and no breach charges. This is no good.

Eh. True fuze mains would keep shooting anyway. No possible hostiles left.

I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
of course! you just gotta pick your corners wellüëå
---
These packs are corny as hell
---
I think we should maybe have 2 speed ratings, which are equivalent to current 2 and 1 speeds. 
---
This way, balancing the ops is much easier but you eliminate the frustrating and unwanted 3 speed meta in this game. 
---
When you have competing ops in siege, such as Ash and Zofia, it makes sense having 2 speed ratings. Ash will become the 2 speed and Zofia the 1 speed. People will moan but as 3 speed is no longer an option, the difference in speed isn‚Äôt as disadvantageous and wouldn‚Äôt be as much of a negative. 
---
3 speed ISNT needed at the value it‚Äôs at now. Either noticeably nerf speed or just remove the higher speed rating. Cav is the only op in the game that makes sense as a 3 speed but even then, this could just be bound to her ability, so she gets the speed boost when using it, but her dropping down to a 2 speed otherwise.
---
We were on defense, so one of us took a screenshot from view
---
Yeah just check the gmail he put in the description of his instagrams post
---
Wamai is great, Goyo is fun
---
Wamai wayyy more useful
---
That‚Äôs why they did it on the last person alive
---
I‚Äôm calling hax!
---
3 speed operators encourage you to play run and gun because if you sit still you're more than likely going to die. Not only that, but roaming is a hugely appreciated aspect on the defender side and entry fragging is hugely appreciated on the attacker side. If everyone were the same, there would be almost no varying playstyle because every operator would be expected to play the same other than their guns
---
Gimme that now
---
Just reminds me of Patrick Star (Spongebob) in a Monty outfit. Don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôve made me feel that way, but there‚Äôs something about it.

becouse everybody is hanging in their partys, i¬¥m a asolo Q ps4 goldie too and i have the same experience, the only people in Gamchat are 12 year old who scream in the mic or some wierd slavic ppl where you can hear the Whole life or their block in the Backround.
---
Mozzie put the left one
---
No its literally the average
---
Wamai 100%. Goyo is generally not that great, and can get you killed. The only thing about Goyo that I like is his weapons. Goyo‚Äôs two primaries the TCSG and the Vector are very good weapons. On the other hand, Wamai is a great alternative to J√§ger. He also has some good weapons. The Aug is generally considered to be a bad weapon on IQ, but I think it works well on defense for Wamai. Those are my thoughts anyways!
---
It‚Äôs a quick scope machine

Wamaii al the waii

Good try bud.

Haha I kinda make these ones, the dude is 25hp and I go like: "shoot him once and you got it"
---
Also me: "I meant one shot to the head..."
---
Vibe check
---
If you got boosters instead of the Year Pass, you will get none of the Pass exclusive content. Also keep in mind, if the Year Pass is on sale, you can get all of it‚Äôs Operators at a much lower price (and much quicker) and they each come with a free exclusive uniform. It‚Äôs up to you to see what‚Äôs valuable to yourself, but I‚Äôve always found the Year Passes to be a fair value even when not discounted.
---
pretty sure the scorpion can shoot too.    /s
---
Don't forget about Doccy and his Stim Shocky :\] 
---
And Finka lifts. 
---
And that one new upcoming Defender operator with 2 deployable floor pads you can step on to regain a small chunk of health (Wont exceed 100 health). And when you use Bandit battery or Kaid Claw with it, it acts as a defib station you can crawl into for a revive so thats pretty cool.
---
Vibe check up the pooper
---
Elite &gt; anything else. But if you dont have the elite that works too, just get a darker uniform.
---
ive accidentally killed the perso. who she was interrogating, yea that really sucked
---
That little pistol isn‚Äôt the best but it has been helpful as shot. It‚Äôs great for cameras and precision

I‚Äôm pretty sure he knew you were getting up. But who knows.

Mouse and keyboard probably
---
Fortress is my favourite map and I actually miss Hereford quite a bit.
---
Most of them are on thingiverse. I could try making the new operators
---
I was thinking that but I know there‚Äôs players wayyy better than me so I wasn‚Äôt gonna accuse. And to add on he did hit a headshot on every single person but that‚Äôs not to difficult
---
It doesn't make a difference though.

This guy is definitely pro-league material.

Where?

---
Thanks!!
---
Not impossible with Controller. You ever give his stats a look?
---
No. Too much utility. Way too much.
---
Xbox users :D
---
No. A big part of Siege is "do I pick A but sacrifice the utility of B?" based on your game knowledge and team tactics. If you have fixed cams you gain more intel but lose some potential fragging power with C4/impacts, and that's the whole point: a calculated compromise.

I wouldn‚Äôt say people are afraid of Ranked, they‚Äôre afraid of some of the toxic players, the shorter rounds and longer matches.

Not everyone can commit to a full ranked game without interruptions or when they do it‚Äôs at a time where they can‚Äôt communicate properly with their team.

That's possible with controller.

I agree with all of this but you‚Äôll never be able to compete if you only play quick match.  Not telling you how to enjoy your time or anything I just think siege is going to have to change soon.  I‚Äôve been playing since launch and I have dropped off a lot this season do to the new ops not really changing the game play and bomb is difficult to play even in plat games.  Planting almost seems impossible if you don‚Äôt have a usual stack

---
Hello ApokolipZx, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eddxqs/anyone_else_get_this_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
If you‚Äôre worried about your mic, just play in a party (or even a private party) alone. 
---
As for getting better? The attack and defence concepts aren‚Äôt as complex to tackle; a large portion of the game is gunfights. Where you place your crosshairs is where you‚Äôd expect to find their head, be it at crouch level or standing. Aim will come with time, most people and myself go solo queue a Terrorist Hunt (lone wolf) and aim only for headshots and one taps, regardless of if you die. If you do this, your aim will grow naturally. Be sure to turn off V - Sync in your visual settings, mess around with your sensitivity, and use guns you may find difficult (perhaps the SMG 11 on the SAS ops, just practice with whoever but use more difficult guns). In your settings, change the matchmaking to Terrorist Hunt Classic. You can also do disarm bomb alone, as that might help with concepts like map knowledge.
---
Recoil control, at least on console, really only involves pulling your right stick down, in essence you pull your right stick down and opposite to the direction in which it goes (if your gun recoils brings your recoil up and to the left, bring your aiming stick or mouse down and to the left). 
---
Sights are personal preference. Not much to say there, although some ops like Doc and Rook thrive with ACOGs because of their range. 
---
When it comes to attacking, you‚Äôll find that in the lower ranks many people tend to split apart than travel in groups, and that operator selection makes no sense. Be sure to travel in groups and coordinate the attack with other teammates if possible, otherwise, move at your own discretion in regards to helping you team push. Being able to do this means choosing the right ops: Thermite or Hibana if you need to breach reinforced walls, Thatcher/Twitch/Kali to take out utility and destroy electronic devices, Gridlock and Nomad/claymore ops to watch flank, etc. Each Operator plays a different role, so knowing who to pick in which situation is crucial. Be sure to drone out everything, every room you plan on pushing. Saving your drone from prep phase and putting it in a room to check that room later on when you‚Äôre ready to push is very helpful. This is the only way attackers can really can intel outside of global operators (Lion, Dokkaebi), or Jackal. 
---
The same goes for defence. Basic things would that if it‚Äôs bomb, use an impact grenade/explosive to open up a rotation between the two bombs so you can defend both. If it‚Äôs secure, usually the objective is made not to sit inside but to watch into from neighbouring rooms, so opening the walls and then reinforcing the walls on the neighbouring walls is standard (for example, Study is a Secure Area objective on the map Villa, you usually open up the walls between Study and Bar and Study and Aviator, and then reinforce or/and use Miras on bar walls so you can watch Study from bar). 
---
Defensive operator selection also matters. If you want to counter a breach of a wall, reinforcing + the use of a Kaid‚Äôs Rtila, Bandit‚Äôs Shock wire, or Mute‚Äôs jammers are standard. Either Wamai or J√§ger can be used for grenade denial (and should be!). Using Mozzie or Mute to deny drones is also a great place to start, although not many people drone in the lower levels. Using operators that bring cameras onto defence is amazingly helpful. Valkyrie and Mozzie provide cameras that are more easily placeable and are easier to hide, while someone like Maestro or Echo provides cams for objective defence and are used for things like denying a defuser plant on bomb. Quite a few ops also have bulletproof cameras as secondary gadgets which are useful. If your team has all the ops you need in your opinion, or you‚Äôre in a squad and have all the necessary ops for your setup, don‚Äôt be afraid to use Rook/Doc, or some sort of other support op like Mute. Impact Grenades and Nitro Cells are useful for wall destruction, so bringing an op with those helps for setting up obj. 
---
The last thing I should touch on is map knowledge; knowing callouts when in a party or queue with others is crucial, even for yourself in many cases. Knowing common plant spots on bomb, the names of rooms on each map, common callouts (such as Harry Potter, in reference to a part underneath a set of stairs). 
---
Sorry if it‚Äôs quite a bit to process. Feel free to shoot questions on the subreddit. I would highly recommend watching Aust1n, Gregor, and Rogue - 9, and Reaper-EN on YouTube; they carry quite a few tips on what to do, and provide in depth videos on different concepts. Rogue - 9 is very analytical and uses stats to compare weapons in many of his videos, Gregor provides guides for all the ops in the game IIRC, Aust1n has good ranked guides, and Reaper does pro league analysis which helps when discovering starts and in game concepts.

This was beautiful

I want videos of all operators like tf2 does now

Sadly, this is me whenever I play as Jackal...which is a lot. I always feel so badass..until I'm not.
---
This I'd the greatest fan content I've ever seen. Please make more, I need it
---
I love this
---
The thing is there isn't a good answer because everyone likes different playstyles. I would recommend reading about them and seeing if it fits your style.
---
People have been advocating for an Ela buff ever since she was nerfed. The reason why recently people have been spamming more is because of the shotgun nerf, not because of the elite skin.
---
Top shits
---
Go into a party and enable party chat priority (I'm not near a PS4 the now so that may not be the name). It will stop your mic transmitting to the other players

I think both ideas are cool, but I Bloodhound is a little derivative of the champ in Apex. I also think that if he has the time to shoot someone with a nail gun, he should just use his primary for the kill

noone gonna talk about jackal double shotgun?
---
Also if you break that window beside the sun you can hop out and put another eye just outside the window on the wall across from it. You have just enough time to do it without being spotted and if your with friends you can have them fix the window right right behind you as you hop in.
---
Then make it so you can‚Äôt trade anything that cost R6 credits? PL sets, Elites etc.
---
Dude, animation is a tough ass thing. Sometimes it‚Äôs really good and sometimes it‚Äôs lazy and sucks. This isn‚Äôt that, good job! The Tom and Jerry sound effects put it over the top!
---
and thats a great price
---
Has anyone notice that finka might be hotter than all the other girls.
---
Haha I like how to he cassette says ‚Äútop 5 hits‚Äù but really looks like ‚Äútop shits‚Äù
---
Do you know how can I upvote this post twice? Because this deserves more than one upvote from me.
---
that's great - love the music! perfect
---
The teal universal skin given in operation health as a refund for universals. That color is 10/10
---
Yea I could honestly go with the idea of them moving the gun out of your face as an alternative
---
I don't think anything on this subreddit has made me laugh more!
---
More of this, this is amazing!
---
Gingerbread is top tier. Don't @me
---
I love you
---
Furry smoke
---
This is entirely inaccurate.  Jackal is always banned, so you can't ever meet him.
---
First glance I thought the title said something about Michael Jackson, and was very confused.
---
And another one. I absolutely love this
---
This is amazing
---
There is for only t-hunt, and even on it it just assists with shooting c4s, it doesn‚Äôt help when shooting at terrorists
---
None can change the truth!
---
You think house is balanced? Lmao
---
Slim profile.
---
Well let's see what R6 brings next year
---
Tap indeed
---
Better marry her...

The "original" 20 Operators, labeled in game as Pathfinders, cost a significantly less amount of Renown (in-game currency you earn for free) and, for the most part, are some of the strongest Operators in the game to this day. It doesn't take a whole lot for a certain round to turn the tide, so the main thing for you is learning to feel comfortable in the game first (which needs to happen regardless of what Op you're using) then learning the nuances of gadgets and matchups and such.
---
If you watch any amount of Siege Pro League, many original Ops are regularly used, so don't feel pressured to start diving into DLC ops just yet until you have, let's say, 4 or 5 original Attackers and Defenders.
---
For Attackers, I recommend:
---
Ash (simplest Operator, easy to learn and decent weapons)
---
Sledge (soft breacher)
---
Thatcher (support - device denial, will take time to learn)
---
Thermite (hard breacher)
---
IQ (support - intel gathering)
---
For Defenders:
---
Rook (anchor, set plates to give team mates more defense)
---
Mute (anchor - intel denial, place all mute jammers before round starts)
---
Pulse (support - intel gathering, use heartbeat sensor to see where enemies are through walls, ping areas for your team mates)
---
Bandit (anchor or roamer - gadget denial, place on walls or barbed wire to block hard breachers or drones, but make sure not to destroy your team mate's existing gadgets)
---
Jager (support - grenade denial, usually played as a roamer, and learning to roam will take a lot of map knowledge, it'll take time but don't get discouraged)
---
If you wanna go deeper with specific learning, Youtubers that are great with informational vids are Rouge 9, Prodigio Pete, Get Flanked, and Varsity Gaming. Just my 2 cents.

Yeah my friends and I used to dick around with each other in casual a bunch but we never teamkilled people we didn‚Äôt know, just ourselves. Now we basically can‚Äôt at all
---
It‚Äôs also annoying when we‚Äôre in a 5 stack in ranked and one of us will like accidentally down someone with a C4 at the end of round getting a monti or something like that and now they‚Äôre stuck with RFF because there was no time to revive them the rounds over. Like I know my friend isn‚Äôt doing it on purpose in ranked and he‚Äôs probably not gonna shoot someone again by accident but still
---
F for respect
---
Tom and Jerry :)
---
You're right, well done!
---
Except the head apparently. Still broken please nerf
---
Bro I don‚Äôt even use an ACOG most of the time. Some pros don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm looking at fucking Shaiiko. Literally only Holo. And he‚Äôs not alone. Pengu prefers 1x for attack on most ops. Plenty do. 
---
And loads don‚Äôt use comp either. Flash is also beneficial. And some use angled grip. These criticisms aren‚Äôt even accurate or true.
---
Having a valid concern is fear mongering? Seriously? Come off it bud
---
The plasma pink double shotgun is the cherry on top of all of those excellent references
---
Ahh I‚Äôll be sad because this game is fairly balanced. I do doubt anything crazy will make its way out of testing. I have confidence everything will be okay.
---
Hopefully never. We don't need even more microtransactions
---
Mmm with ubis constant unnecessary changes and not focusing upon the big issues of siege id say we're not at our best point
---
I love you (no homo)
---
Kaid
---
I'm hoping so. They've generally done a pretty good job at keeping the game together *looks at Clash* .... mostly lol
---
I don't know whether I'm proud or embarrassed
---
I had sound off and I could still hear the laughs in my head lol
---
Tf was that example though? lmao
---
Oh my God the Cav at the end is so perfect
---
Play on xbox? I need teammates to get outta silver too ;-; ik most general strategies and have maps memorized
---
Why except ash :( 
---
I‚Äôve been longing for the day of 3 speed rush with the M1014
---
thanks bro, means a lot
---
What‚Äôs your play style on attack/defense?
---
Kaid has one of my most favorite guns, the TCSG12. Even though it‚Äôs a shotgun it can shoot with pinpoint accuracy from far range, acting more like a DMR than a shotgun. Maverick is fun only on certain maps, Kaid can be played on any map no matter what.
---
It‚Äôs a wolf tho
---
I mean imagine if all ops at the exact same speed. What issues do you see coming forth from that? If they flipped the switch of course they'd have to revisit weapons and gadgets for nerfs/buffs but those aside, do you see any issue with having all ops be 2 speed?
---
Intelactual.
---
I think they use a remixed version in Baby Driver, I used the original one just because it seemed to fit better. The song being Nowhere to Run by Martha And The Vandellas
---
Lesion doing the stanky leg??
---
Thanks!
---
100% agree, we don't need a battlepass and to waste 15‚Ç¨ on it.
---
Nah I play on PS4 sadly :(
---
You dont have to ban it. There is a free version as well.
---
I fucking hate Jerry.
---
I love it
---
Believe it got delayed because of a large amount of community feedback that was negative about it on it's first presented offer. Likely will be revised and re-presented later.
---
Moves like mnk on console
---
Eww...I love it
---
Thank you, and you taught me something too!
---
wait there pal, there may be some unexpected event.
---
Mmmmm, no. You only get to play them on the TTS.
---
Goodbye.
---
Make one with N√∏kk lmao you are good
---
you misspelled waifu
---
Yeah
---
I go 0-8 until its 4-4 and I ace. Thats my role..
---
Marry her
---
No wonder he has a face mask
---
I think the right time should be the Six Invitational, but I do not know. Maybe they will drop later.
---
This is like when your friend writes a small scribble on your notebook and you retaliate with a bigger one and they payback words and etc. 
---
You hit them with a bullet, they hit you with two, you shoot 5, they throw a grenade
---
that's pretty incredible
---
Good shot man, you‚Äôre looking like a pro!
---
Same!
---
Dude i want moreeeee
---
I seem to remember the audio from the end.  Is that from an old Tom and Jerry cartoon?
---
That didn't really change anything.
---
Is he's ungrateful then he can just stop playing, it's not a game about how many guns they can fit into a game. If he wants that tell him to go to borderlands.
---
Wife her bruh!
---
Where's the music/audio from?
---
LMFAO! My god that was good! Like a mix of Tom and Jerry and other classic cartoons! Would love more!
---
Maybe Twitch's drone vs Mozzie in a game of cat and mouse?
---
He‚Äôll complain it‚Äôs not realistic
---
There is a new game mode that gives you the same rules and maps as ranked. Try playing that until ur comfortable with the maps, strats and call outs
---
Why does this sound like it was written by OP üòÇüòÇ
---
The Tom and Jerry nostalgia
---
Thank you for being wholesome and helpfull
---
Thats just telling people how trash or good you are
---
I suppose yes...
---
but- the kapkan would blow up all the other traps :(
---
On console she is basically a handicap to the team since her smg is uncontrollable but on pc I think it‚Äôs a lil more usable. With all that being said I guess it would be hard to balance her cuz if they make her smg some what better on console then it‚Äôd prob be broken on pc. But yeah I agree with u she should 100% get impact grenades
---
This is fantastically great
---
Cheaters still exist but less so in the DDoS department due to the bans and active banning of them. Now if you're talking about M&amp;K on console, yeah, still going strong.
---
It made me laugh a lot man! Make some more of them
---
First off AMAZING!!!!  
---
SECOND..... am I the only one that's gonna mention the Tom &amp; Jerry Sound Effects?  
---
  
---
I absofrickingluttely love this.... thank you
---
It does
---
I've never played this game in my life and this is top comedy.
---
No please
---
I came here to mention it too! Actor is Michael McDonald from MADtv, too!
---
Y E S
---
Only gun to use it on its cavs smg main weapon
---
Cavs smg it‚Äôs a must for me
---
It's an online game so... Yes. Duh
---
I already have her but you're right, she's one of top 3 attacker choices
---
I had an idea once that she is the daughter of Sam Fisher and that if they were to do another Splinter Cell the main character you play as should be her and not only this will make Splinter Cell fans happy but Rainbow fans too since she will get more lore.
---
Sure is
---
It's so interesting to see when there is o ly one dude left and my team goes like if they are training for a marathon, never saw so much ppl running around a map for so long
---
Your entire team left?
---
Oh it‚Äôs casual
---
Online game doesn't equal cheaters.
---
Yeeees, and It Will be something different. Imagine you be able to play a r6 character that fit perfectly another game
---
Is anyone else thinking this is tom and Jerry?
---
Well as it‚Äôs objectively wrong, yes.
---
Tachanka kappapride?
---
Why can't someone like you ever be on my team, my teams tend to tell me a room is secure just to watch me run in and get gunned down so they know if its safe to proceed or not lmao.
---
Yes, actually it does.
---
Why does this look like Vegas 2?
---
Holy shit I laughed
---
r/mildlypenis
---
 I think ubi is slowly caring for console more which is good because they used to not give a fuck about us for so long. They‚Äôll figure something out in the future I think but it won‚Äôt be some time soon imo
