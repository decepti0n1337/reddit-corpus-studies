Well that's not completely true to be honest, even those old ass laptops with Core 2 Duos inside feel snappy compared to before as soon as you stick one of those 20$ SSDs from Amazon (Personally I would suggest either a Crucial BX500 or a Kingston A400 if you are looking to revive your old laptop) inside it.
---
---
---
Thank you! I do like the idea being a sneaky because it makes me feel badass
---
Then yeah haha, try them. Or try someone that helps with your weaknesses. Like nomad if you hate run-outs or Blackbeard if you find yourself holding angles for half the round
---
It's a nullment at best. Negative would be punishment and positive a reward. There is always an in-between.
---
The notable one I noticed was smoke. Last time I read his bio, he was a heavyweight boxer. Now he's some kind of a geeky, unorthodox chemist who just defied the educational system
---
Thank you! I will try this out
---
Yeah basically I got fucked
---
Its perspective in FPS games. Rogue-9 or Flanked has a nice video on it. The closer you are to cover, the less of the enemy you will see, despite them seeing all of you.
---
Buck if you‚Äôre less experienced only because he requires zero finesse
---
Eww stop self promoting
---
I tend to hold angles for half the round so Blackbeard is probably a good bet!
---
That is the actual reason
---
Lol
---
do glaz pls
---
Yeah I wish there was like an unranked K/D I wanna start over on my kd. It‚Äôs 1.1 but it‚Äôs so hard to increase it bc of how long I‚Äôve played the game
---
TIL
---
Lmfao I wasn‚Äôt really asking what it looked like I was expressing my opinion
---
Zofia, Buck, Thermite, Thatcher or Jackal (even these are hard times to become a Jackal main)
---

---
The best attackers, in my opinion
---
No
---
Dat Alex's face though
---
i guess thats a neon sign hanging right behind you.
---
You want someone to boost you?
---
Tell me, how hot does it get in there?
---
oh really? I didn't know they were implementing this on console since I have not yet seen it haha. I guess I'll keep my eye out for it! I would think I am due for some elo but maybe not.
---
Yes yes ü•∞
---
Korean man
---
Did you get any mmr? Lol
---
The game ended immediately after the preparation phase, I got 0 mmr and it said I got deranked to copper V but me rank was just fine in The main menu after the match.
---
Thank you, will give them all a try to see which one I feel best with
---
That could just be his elite. I would get
---
Lol good job you might be better then me at a video game and you‚Äôre letting me know on a social platform like reddit. You‚Äôre man of the year!
---
Too op
---
I‚Äôm already scared of blitz, this would just be a nightmare, but good idea!
---
But why give him a shotgun???? If before the nerf to ads he was soooo frustrating imagine with a shotgun. He charges you don‚Äôt even need to flash you and bam a shot in the chest you‚Äôre dead.
---
It is indeed Japanese.
---
Mira-glitch*
---
I really wanted to say her but I figured I‚Äôd get yelled at lol. I think she needs to lose her acog for sure and I have a crazy idea for her drones. I think they need to give her one of the two options. 
---
A.) She gets one normal drone to drone out the objective and ping operators and one shock drone with 14 shots for gadgets. That‚Äôd cut down on people wasting half her utility in the prep phase but they can still get more utility with her one drone if they‚Äôre skilled. Plus I hate droning out ops with her shock drones cause they‚Äôre so damn loud.
---
B.) They completely negate the ability to do damage to other players so when they zap them they yell and it blurs their screen for a second like normal. Again, that‚Äôd reduce the amount of times they get wasted just trying to rack up assists but encourages her to destroy gadgets.
---
I mean, does he thoo?? He isn't picked nearly as often as people said he would be and he isn't too hard to deal with
---
Right when I read your reply I checked on it and the video memory is back up to 4054/5991 working perfectly
---
*unzips*
---
Bro u cant post that in here read the rules!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting this but if they made an elite of him wearing a Delta Squad soldier outfit since he was part of ‚ÄúThe Unit‚Äù would be really sick. He‚Äôs already wearing a somewhat ‚Äúundercover‚Äù outfit back when he went MIA, plus we just got a ‚ÄúCasual clothes‚Äù Smoke elite. Just my 2 cents.
---
Bro I fr want his legendary gadget to be a bic lighter with a bendy straw and some lighter fluid
---
Welp, you‚Äôre not gonna get the MMR back unless you play for it. So I think you should change your password and turn on two factor authentication.
---
Riffraff
---
Yeah I can see them being too easy to spot but I also think that‚Äôd be a nice balance if they‚Äôre going to keep his plant denial ability. You should be able to take them out if you‚Äôre trying to plant
---
Hot, always new they had a thing together, that's how zofia was made. Spook Bitch and thicc
---
Huh, weird!
---
I very greatly disagree but to each their own.

Lord forgive me for what I‚Äôm about to do

Real men die to thermite chargesüí™üò§
---
I mean you clearly tried to peak
---
&gt;  if your watching the points after you get a kill your retarded 
---
Then why have them on? also you're* for both of those, how ironic.
---
Ok I dead ass say this all the time. So I guess I was born to play and be a lion main
---
When fighting someone. If they are holding an angle try not to peak the same spot more than once. While the kill didn‚Äôt look too good, you really didn‚Äôt need to peak again, or at least popped up above the shield. It takes awhile to tell yourself not to peak again.  But you‚Äôll stop dying to upsetting things like this.
---
I serve the reddit union good sir, I do my part in calling out reposts
---
Love reading these man. Nice job
---
I don‚Äôt need to be forgiven. This is Lord sanctioned. Lord Chanka always had a thing for Rook‚Äôs thicc juicy peach.
---
I prefer that they only give one charge and maybe lower the recharge time. Because now it he times it right he can make you lose 12 secondes ( I know it can be 14 but it‚Äôs too risky) with one drone.
---
Cradles by Sub Urban
---
Yeah uhh got this on ps4 lost plat bcause if this
---
Thank you so much! Thank you for reading!
---
Rule 34 has been gone too far...
---
I think that‚Äôs a great idea for casual! I think in Ranked it would be doable as well, but if they do anything like that for Ranked it should be a map ban system like in pro league.
---
Edit: Since in pro league they do custom matches and ban maps outside the game, it would likely be hard to implement.
---
Ye, very good idea.
---
There is always that window where there is a mat under it
---
Since the defuser has been electronic instead of hitting it
---
Yeah I was looking at the 3000 and a 1070ti platinum
---
Maverick for Siege single player campaign?
---
It‚Äôs one of the concept arts they showed off that would be revealing lore and such from the free battlepass we are getting eventually.
---
You have been spotted by hostiles, fall back!
---
That‚Äôs cool, thanks, looks like (if Harry is the child) Thatcher knew Harry when he was a smol boi
---
It‚Äôd be cool if you built in a fan to keep it inflated.
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a child in this, he‚Äôs just farther back and hunched down a bit.
---
[deleted]
---
Maybe, but you can see why I called him a child
---
how is this 10k upvotes? did the entire player base just start playing this game? this is basic mira shit
---
That's.. hilarious and amazing
---
Skeletons
---
Yeah Thatcher is just a bigger person in general compared to Harry.
---
YOU GET OUT THERE AND YOU FIND THAT FUCKING DOG.
---
Not much. Just my soul :(

Imagine getting healed by the wrong gun

I prefer my sleg boi meself

Never saw anyone countering the thermite charge like bandit does.

Noooo, I hate looking for black eyes. Don‚Äôt make me play iq every game

Ethan Hunt?

*HAPPY LION NOISES*
---
You look high on nanomachines

It would be a good elite

You‚Äôre lucky, mine was for a crappy weapon skin for someone I don‚Äôt remember
---
F
---
What are you talking about?
---
Can confirm higher than normal amounts of BS on your own screen you may fire multiply times but on your kill cam it may not show you firing at all, and visa versa
---
Chalet and Skyscraper. Both are terribly favored towards attackers and need a rework ASAP. Both only really have 1 viable site to defend. Skyscraper just has so many angles attackers can see you from and the only viable way to win on defense is to run out half the time. Chalet has a ton of bs angles too and it‚Äôs too easy to cut off rotations as an attacker on that map. I hope to god that they remove one of these two (preferably Chalet first) when the Theme park Rework comes out next season.
---
I don't have it on.
---
Curious, how does it ruin the game?
---
I have no idea what that means but thank you I will look for the dog
---
I‚Äôm on console so I deal ddos a lot. Maybe there‚Äôs other ways people could cheat on here but for the most part I get ddosed a lot :/ I feel bad for pc players dealing with hackers tho

*Monty visibly shakes in fury*
---
Been a while since I played but glad to see the toxicity of the community is still the same.
---
It really be like that sometimes
---
Seems like you would know a lot about a negative k/d
---
Fuck you goatman.
---
just quit being an asshole. hes wondering why someone took his kill. I get it. you're a silver 3 so the only way you have above a .4 kd is by stealing your teammates kills. I get it: it's okay buddy. you'll be good some day
---
&gt;has anyone encountered something similar?
---
yes, though it shouldn't be that much of a thing this season, best reason they can come up is to have easier matches
---
probably to be honest
---
Jackal needs a footprint reduction time but after maybe take away Smokes? I feel like there‚Äôs no downside to him so why not. 
---
Global ops can suck my cock and balls, Dokkabei is now fucking great due to Frags + SMG-12 buff, Lion is as annoying as ever and Finka is only mediocre cause her weapons aren‚Äôt that good for fragging out. 
---
On defense Echo needs a nerf, make the drone reflect more and remove the gap between being stunned and being able to plant again.
---
Damm you even gonna put in under trophy window. You sir are part of the problem. Nice work
---
Ya kno. 
---
True. Doc's probably too busy being.. humanitarian and shit

Capitao and cav

holy shit, is maverick a doomer?
---
So basically me every game
---
Legendary? Do you mean elite?
---
Just a random running joke. No real meaning.
---
So there is roll back for ddos games now.
---
Good.
---
Have it like ESL does it (Ban maps until you get a consensus. There are 12 maps in the pool, axe Skyscraper and there‚Äôs 11)
---
Ban

Ban

Ban, thereby picking the remaining map

U don't know tht.  Ur just making a statement by what if . And I m jus saying is not touch on mechanism tht initially came with. If u have doubt abt it jus Photoshop the smoke to red or whatever color u want and check the visibility. And no I don't have to do tht,(if u think I have to check) I am fine with what it is.
---
Montagne needs some love

he was nerfed twice recently. - ADS takes a shit ton of time, - Hip fire isn't a fucking thing - melee only knocks down instead of killing

Bruh I'm level 92 and I've never had a single legendary

Is the smoke plague doctor official?
---
Ok.
---
There‚Äôs two ways I know of, one is leave and join back at the very last second, near impossible to pull of basically down to luck, other way is buy no ops and go into ranked or ban the ops you do own so you get auto picked recruit
---
Pick ash
---
 1. What‚Äôs the point in this. 
---
2. Why has mute got a Scotland flag?
---
Or when you watch the killcam and the guy misses 2cm to the right and the blood comes off fucking nothing
---
Looks like that scene in Sam Raimi‚Äôs Spider-Man when he runs on the wall.
---
I‚Äôm assuming j√§ger passed out at the bottom from too many of bandits drugs
---
When they get a bad kd in a match, they abandon it so their kd doesn‚Äôt change.
---
oml. i deserve so much elo from last season
---
DO IT
---
Not that this has ever happened to me specifically just aware how quick it is to run out right there
---
Is this what music sounds like now?
---
They were still very sketch even if they are just abusing the system
---
Oh gotcha I guess I‚Äôve missed a lot of those posts. 
---
But I relate with all the damn black ice posts.
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs banned half the time so ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I use it as a wallpaper for my phone. Think it looks nice.
---
Orange, or yellow for background. but I think you have to resolve the form of the mask. the lines on the chambers below the mask have lines that would probably not show up if reduced to a smaller size. so either make the lines thicker, or delete it. also 'outbreak' is a weird font choice. maybe just a cleaner san serif font.
---
I have one of those
---
Because his shotgun is actually good and fun to use? His SMG is good yeah but his shotgun is really fun to use and good as well. Cant go wrong with either choice.
---
Look at his movement before jumping to conclusions pal, look at how slow he moves at the start, and look at hos hr moves the camera only in the x axis, and it's in intervals, and not sharp as a mouse.
---
That was definitely controller, but hey, go ahead and prove me wrong. Idk how you got upvoted by jumping to conclusions
---
no but I would fuse some drywall randomly to get points
---
I honestly do use the smg a lot, I just enjoyed using his shotty on Fortress in this particular objective. Different tastes for different people ig
---
Cave should disappear off screen then just suddenly the camera falls over from cav appearing out of nowhere, decking it and all you see is like when she interrogates you. Just her face lol
---
do you not have a brain? have you never uninstalled anything on your xbox before? sound issues a known thing, everyone experiences them, especially more so this season. so if you uninstall your issues wont be fixed, but rest assured, you wont lose anything
---
Bandit really in the spooktober mood
---
I JUST GOT THAT TODAY
---
Ouch
---
It‚Äôs probably supposed to be the tape on his gas mask
---
Sure
---
Awesome!
---
Oh
---
Then the screen just sorta go black and you hear her saying "where are they" or some shit
---
Fair enough
---
I‚Äôve been hunting that charm for so long. I‚Äôm incredibly jealous.
---
Yeah, I knew it was going to sound stupid, I'm pretty much an idiot in most regards
---
Too bad that you cant really do that
---
I see clash being unbanned 80% of the time coz firstly not everyone knows how to play her and secondly they feel cav and echo are more OP than clash which is kinda true i suppose. 
---
And in case of jackal, he may not be the last guy standing alwayd if we got good roamers or we hunt him down instead even though dat will need 2 good roamers.
---
Isnt cav a good enough counter for jackal?
---
Thanks man I was about to wast 6 hours trying to figure this out, I was on the fence about getting a pc anyway
---
No cause Jackal has a good gun and all he needs is to track Cav, find her, pow pow, she‚Äôs gone.
---
When he went off the grid
---
Yay more ways to milk the game. /S
---
√âlite skin  ?
---
You drew the greatest mustache of siege
---
Lamo, well played

Jager and Doc are probably the worst elites. Good skins but not good elites

Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the FLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRR

Amaru liked that

Ngl this was nothing to do with the Monty that team were idiots

"Sigh", how many times is this going to be posted?

Looks waaaayy better

Is this supposed to be by the L shape counter on first floor chalet cuz if so you damn well know this is the go to spot for a the triple frost mat.
---
i saw that and i cant stop laughing
---
That sucks
---
Cuz u played tachanka
---
Okay got it thanks for the help guys! I'm gonna switch up some loadouts then
---
Literally anything. Somebody using unauthorized software, believe it or not people can get walls, aimbot, whatever they want on console, theres just more steps involved in doing it. Or the person you played with had previously ddosed somebody, either way you played with a cheater. I'm tired of seeing people bitch about this, a cheater was banned, and he wont further negatively impact the game. Which is something everybody can agree on. 76 elo isnt even that much, 1 maybe 2 games if you play a lot of ranked.
---
Playing ANZ challenger league tomorrow ahaha
---
hear droning and gets invsible

why you didn't die

1) console

4) isn't r6 more popular on pc than console

5) why is every console ace-like looking at a baby play on pc
---
6) do you think anybody uses a mouse and keyboard on console

as any halfway complex topic , get yourself a piece of software (blender is a good all-rounder and free) and then don't get overly frustrated by the brick wall that is the 12 billion different topics you have to learn in parallel.

if you're lacking quality sources for tutorial stuff, Blender Guru  [https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice)  recently started a new longform series walking through everything for the latest blender update,

I thought the same thing lmao

The melee on this game is a joke

From my understanding they took out server swaps for good on the most recent patch

Damn. Thats too much of pent up frustration over jackal. Sorry to hear. It is understandable.

The MMR difference between you two (after adjustment) is 482.

The MMR sum that was gain/lost due to adjustment is 339.

This means you haven't played the same matches, as you had different MMR before adjustment.

Why is it raining?
---
I think it would be nice to have the scopes from the m249 on dmrs I wouldnt mind seeing them on all the guns with acog like have a choice between the two if you like the plus rather than the Chevron for crosshairs
---
Is this a personal attack or something?
---
Same here
---
if i had the valk on my team, she would be kicked immediately
---
You feel bad but proceed to laugh in chat
---
bruh why would you ever want an acog over the scope? the scope is the most op sight in the whole game its only balanced cause its on a mediocre lmg
---
I was 3 MMR off hitting diamond. More or less punished for not being playing as a 5 stack. As well as this, it hasn't taken into account all the MMR I've lost out from Ddossing and stressing.
---
What does the command do?
---
Awesome!!!
---
Are you Thanos Wife?
---
I've been using the angled grip now on operators that have it and hell yeah it makes a huge difference. It's helping in gunfights thanks again!
---
Yeah preference optic wise matters.
---
Do you just only play vigil and quit the game if your attacking wtf
---
fuckin love the addition of the acog on the headshot machine... whole thing looks really great though, nice!
---
With a P90? Yeah, ok.
---
The recoil isn't all that bad either. Mostly
---
Personally I dont know but alot of comments I see like this say ebay
---
Well obviously no, but a lot of the aces on this sub tends to have enemies who aren‚Äôt super good
---
As a frost main, this pleases my eyes.
---
Haha
---
Well i mean, there's the objective in there  
---
But hey happy cake day
---
Thanks I love it.
---
What
---
The
---
Fuck
---
I'm just saying the vast majority of people wouldn't bother to do that, if anyone even thinks of it
---
I also hope they add that holo they have for the fmg-9 and p10 roni for frosts smg
---
I mean as much as I like "shotgun sniping" with her I'm kinda retarded at anchoring

Aw that‚Äôs a shame

I haven't been in a game one time in the past week w any cheaters on xbox
---
Welcome cat deployed!
---
Yes
---
Blitz does have a ww2 set though. Although it represents the Panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht or more specifically the Heer (Army). The Heer aren‚Äôt the Nazis though, they were just the normal rank and file of the Third Reich. They‚Äôre comparable to Germany‚Äôs Bundeswehr today. There‚Äôs not that much if any fascist stuff in game lol.
---
JACKAL

He looks like the bloody subway surfer grew a pair and stopped running from the cops

Oh it‚Äôs that a shotgun I thought it was a sledgehammer

He‚Äôs right tho

FUCK GOU!!!!! looool stupid stupid silver
---
This is a great proposal to make Warden viable but it isn‚Äôt what ubi has in mind for him, they want him to be able to punish aggressive players who don‚Äôt take time to plan something but instead smoke and rush. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs given such a weak weapon too because aggressive plays like that are usually done with lower armor ops so a low damage weapon would balance the fight out more (Yes the P90 is low damage too but the High Magazine capacity would make him too powerful in his play). He needs a small buff like his gauge being changed to be like cav and vigil and given his impacts back.
---
Haha I was just joking most icons really are accurate
---
It's still possible, but it's significantly more difficult with these nerfs. I think Ubisoft regret having shield operators in the game and since they can't remove them at this stage they're just slowly nerfing them into unviability.
---
Maybe a camera smaller than a drone
---
I saw a clip a while back labelled "WHAT OUT HAVKERS CAN KILL YOU IN THE WIN SCREEN" but it's just a glitch that requires good timing, I guess he accidentally got spazzed into it
---
No the MMR/Elo depends on team matching 
---
I got matched with my friend on ranked  and it was a 2v5 and we lost but only lost 5 elo 
---
Next game it was a 5v5 and we won I got 90 elo
---
So in higher ranks, you get less elo
---
Same here, I used to semi-main Monty but I've not bothered since the changes, he's only useful for being a walking wall that people can plant behind, he's a liability otherwise, where before he was quite a menace.
---
I‚Äôm more impressed with the video quality and framerate than that shot but still nice one my guy! What did you use to record and what‚Äôs the settings?
---
Incognito mode
---
In a 1v5 I play purely for K/d and just try to bait and wait for kills lol.
---
Explaines some
---
I do t think their goal is to to make them not viable because they have a big tactical use honestly Monty doesn‚Äôt even need to shoot his gun just guide him to Obj and have him sit on defuse
---
Filthy

Why u bully me :(

I think It happened to me about 4 times by now, placements and after

 Calm your tits
---
There isn‚Äôt one?  The only real counter in Cav.
---
I got 63 points yesterday. My friend got -140. Don't know how it works
---
You on the grass again?
---
If he decides to stay there, kapkan is gonna have a baaaaaad time
---
Idk, seems kinda wasted, you won't be able to watch cams and attack at the same time, cams won't be able to move, op is a 2/2 likely with poor weapon recycling, i think it's not that interesting, cams are great , but what other gadgets you could add that would be way more fun and adaptive
---
Bikini suggested this
---
If you go over the "estimated time" by 2 or 3 minutes you should restart the queue. Usually its bugged out if that happens.
---
That's sick bro good art  work :)
---
Thermite frags... oh the old good times
---
I don't think I've ever heard someone say that they're usually silver or plat, that's am extremely big mmr distance. In the past. Seasons I've always been gold when trying but got good relatively recently, after I lost the possibility to leave it, so everyone knew I was hitting plat this season.
---
But wasn't there a f2p weekend last year during the halloween event?
---
No op should be self sufficient. You give warden exactly what he is supposed to counter, hell be too powerful, even as a 3 chunks.
---
Make him 2 speed and we have a deal. He has a niche use, like choke points such as bank blue stairs and border toilet and villa closet, and that's ok.
---
how does vigil counter lion? he gets spotted by a lion call.
---
Will you do twitch, she's one of my mains, along with bandit
---
For you to say that it‚Äôs awful to watch in any rank is delusional and retarded. Ofc it‚Äôs nowhere near as good as pc with speed, smoothness, frames, etc but that still doesn‚Äôt mean that just because some little privileged bitch boy says it‚Äôs awful, it is. There are tons of great players on console, you are just too whiny to watch 60fps. Go aimbot on someone in casual. But no, if your comeback is I‚Äôm just a salty console boy. No, I agree with you 100%, id use a pc over console any day of the week. But that still doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs bad.
---
They buffed him last season. When his erc is active, he is immune to lion roars.
---
First of all I never said he was fully covered secondly damage to the legs is reduced compare to damage to the chest so you need more shot to kill him and he only has to crouch and then he‚Äôs fully covered. What‚Äôs the point of blitz being behind a murder hole ?
---
is it that japenese forest? /s
---
Where's the skinny white dude running away meme?
---
How the fuck?
---
*Jake Paul intensifies*
---
Fitting for Spooktober. Updoot incoming.
---
Get guud kid
---
The real question here is who goes prone on laundry stairs?
---
I agree, maybe a drone (selfguided will be op) that make the same noise as an operator running or something like that can be more fun
---
cool didn‚Äôt know that but i mean not that many people really play lion so i don‚Äôt know there are definitely better roamers imo
---
You didn't say yeet
---
I cant wait until you have the operators I use. it's going to be great
---
Being stubborn and not admitting when you've been a dick is still very immature.
---
*facestabs*
---
Nah. All the noise the drone made was a distraction for the defenders. So that is really a plat 2 strat.
---
As a new player I always wanted this simply to orientate myself better on the map. I do think it would probably be too powerful as other commenters have mentioned, but a good compromise in my opinion would be to be able to be able to place a ping on your drones current location, to inform your team that there is something going down at that location, without being overly specific.
---
I don‚Äôt want them to look like tarot cards lmao
---
Some people use it for the scorpion
---
P90 doesnt have stained glass or zoe love... unplayable!!
---
So you‚Äôre implying race over what I took from the image?
---
Don't care. It was a stupid joke. That's all. Good play.
---
Who gives a fuck about charm rarity
---
well u must not play a lot of it then
---
Exactly
---
Yeah, my first thought looking at these icons was "Oh cool, Doc has Yggdrasil as his icon because it is the tree of life and and he heals."
---
Do you by any chance have one with all the operators?
---
Ubishafted
---
First, you did say he would be fully covered. Secondly, even at reduced damage, that‚Äôs how it is for everyone so it‚Äôs basically regular damage. Third, this is just an idea that I had and wanted some opinions on, I didn‚Äôt want to debate it like it‚Äôs climate change or something. So, thank you, for telling me what you think. I do appreciate it, but I feel like at this point it‚Äôs only an argument and no longer a discussion so I‚Äôm done replying to you.
---
Watch guides? It's a little more complicated than I can explain in a comment that i type out in my phone. Basically defend/attack objective or kill enemy team, that's siege.
---
As for the toxic part well, welcome to the internet
---
lololol
---
I wasn't knowing that they added impact to hƒ±m
---
Build it in blue to match Buck's operator icon.
---
A small request from a Buck Main.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it still have high recoil when burst fired?
---
well first of all as the spawnee I can't predict the exact pixel location of the peace of trash trying to ruin my game for me. They have full awareness of location and direction and for peaks like bank front where you're literally being shot at before you can see your own location and orientation for more than a second its not exactly balanced. Its not sporting and you're forcing a person to sit out a whole round because you're an unsporting asshole.
---
Haha so funny Thanos reference Xdd!!!1!1!!111!!!11!
---
A nice spooktober icon.
---
In case someone is confused, these are the beta operator icons
---
Backpack?
---
everything about her she‚Äôs annoying for your own team. i hate having a finka on my team. the recoil buff is pointless cause all guns in this game have almost no recoil/super easy to control. when you get boosted you only hear your heart beat and can‚Äôt hear shit around you and the blue tint is hella annoying.
---
Wrong subreddit, this game never had customizable backpack and patches, sorry sir.
---
No not really. It‚Äôs a lot more manageable.
---
Thats a lot of damage!
---
I'm actually curious cause that was the next leaked elite right?
---
What?
---
I don't know exactly why, I think it might be because the player could only afford a ctr monitor, thus 4:3 became usual for him, and when the LCD came he didn't want to get used to another proportion
---
Well.Thats two guns out of about 100 that are kind of better with burst.
---
Stop trying to speak for everyone, commie
---
Charges into a bomb on his stallion with a torch in hand.
---
I was more so referencing the knife-flip animation that comes with a backstab, but then it doesn't come through with the backstab.
---
I agree. Thatcher and Kapkan were my favorite elites to date, because of the historical significance. Thatcher with Operation Nimrod and Kapkan with the Spetnaz in Afghanistan.
---
Followed you on IG. awesome work (:
---
What. Jackal is amazing what r u on
---
Valkyrie
---
I had no idea that Doc was behind the shredded wall at 8 seconds into the video. Should rename the title to The most clueless Twitch :|
---
Thanks cool
---
I miss always running Cold Blooded Pro and my friends calling me dumb "because its useless", then the enemy would start calling in killstreaks and I can run around the map unhindered while they are all hiding inside a building.
---
Sword range lmao
---
Yea, I was gonna do that when I get a chance. I read a thread about sensitivity so I'm probably gonna up it to 50-75.
---
Probably the best Thatcher cosplay I've seen. Nice job
---
You ask and shall receive
---
i‚Äôve gained plenty of elo back
---
That would be nice if they kept track of who has what operators like people with all operators are more likely to get legendary skins and stuff but people with less ops more often get renown out of legendaries
---
So guess I'm just really unlucky
---
I agree it can be very strong but that‚Äôs why she‚Äôd have these other parameters to keep her balanced ‚Äî&gt;
---
- Has a short cooldown on her gadget of 6 seconds, meaning you have to know there‚Äôs something close you want to jam otherwise it‚Äôs a waste. 
---
- Maybe have it so that she has to be walking, like she does with the full invisibility to cameras. Otherwise the effect still occurs. This means wary enemies have a better chance and that she isn‚Äôt just sprinting into a room disabling all traps and gadgets. 
---
- She has the worst attacking loadout in the game, with equipment that really don‚Äôt fit her design. This is a huge negative to a now much improved gadget with the disabling capabilities. 
---
- She is a 2 speed. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing but she obviously doesn‚Äôt have the speed in comparison to Vigil, who is similar in design but with better weaponry. 
---
I think all of these will offset the strength of this gadget. It also only benefits her and would only help her, not really the team that much. I ultimately think it‚Äôs fine but does make her so much better.
---
Sorry but I wouldn‚Äôt want this at all
---
I really appreciate it
---
These are so badass. I love this.
---
I‚Äôm excited for you to finish every operator so far, then you can put together a mega-compilation of them all in a single image.
---
Okie dokie

A what reference?

I'm trying to find a Way to send it To you

Is that a tennis racket handle being used as a suppressor?

Interesting. It‚Äôs fun to hear how other people play and their priorities. Our team is super aggro so our typical team comp on attack looks something like Capitao, Zofia, Twitch, Finka, Nomad. We don‚Äôt push super hard but we do sweep in at a steady pace. The goal is to breach in hot and eliminate roamers. Once it‚Äôs a 5v3 or so it‚Äôs short work to get the plant down with our team comp. it‚Äôs smokes, airjabs, Fire bolts, and concussion blasts while Twitch plants and then from there it‚Äôs just denial. But honestly we hardly ever get to plant. Most of the time we are able to wipe the other team without really having to push defuser in so heavily.
---
Oh ok sorry for the Interference, do you want the Purple Version I can PM it to you
---
Gridlock it's to slow, has pretty bad guns, hand gadget it's okay for ranked play. Nomads guns are ass and her gadget is good for ranked, but I don't play ranked a lot.
---
I would personally like all legendary charms removed cause they aren‚Äôt worthy of that rarity

Try 75 horz, 30 vert, 28-30 ads. Seems to be my sweet spot. Whatever feels good to you stick with it and build that muscle memory. Good luck
---
Stuns actually work how they're supposed to be, the problem is that anything breaking line of sight will also stop the flash.
---
And hitboxes are very precise too, even so much that if you hit a helmet or scarf it won't do any damage because the head itself was untouched. This may seem like hits that should have killed didn't register though
---
Now... where are you hacking?
---
Mediocre wall bang and you say your hacking? I‚Äôd get your 2$ back
---
Bandit and Kaid are Arcane Tricksters
---
damn thats awesome i kinda want to take a crack at this now
---
Take your time lol
---
https://youtu.be/RnGtl_tTXnM
---
So when am I allowed to repost these? Is next month still free?
---
This is not lag, it's when you vault at the end of the game. If you vault it registers the motion of vaulting and if the game ends before the motion of vaulting has ended than you're able to still play. You'll be able to shoot, throw nades, check cameras and if you put your drone close to the end screen you'll be able to drive your drone around during the end screen and see the drone itself driving around.
---
Also it's not only with vaulting it's basically with any action that requires time. Like placing a shield/breaching charge/bulletproof cam
---
Sure man go for it
---
This is a cursed image
---
Nokk and warden are the shittiest ops yet
---
Funny German man no scope XD
---
Is this a serious response?Of course I'm not, it's just a trash post
---
Well Nokk wouldn‚Äôt be after this, that‚Äôs for sure
---
PARRY THIS YOU FRITZ BASTAAAAARD
---
Just curious, have you done the s.a.s. operators yet? Also that looks cool as hell!
---
How do you get up there a love doing shit like this and that‚Äôs a new one
---
The person in chat was me for some context
---
Oh shit it‚Äôs Dolan dark
---
No because siege is more then just kills, you can have a player who just sits on cams and gives callouts and gives your teammates kills, but he gets no points
---
My buddy i went to middle school with played it and told me to get it, that was Y2S2 I believe. It was just a way for us to hang out again after 4-5 years ya know
---
I agree, old kanal was fine
---
... ya, that's what marpat is
---
I prefer a clean install too.
---
Amaru incoming in 3... 2... 1...
---
THUNK!
---
Do that for Nokks icon
---
Yeah for sure idk its kinda complicated
---
Guess who Commented
---
Punch the broom to break it, vault prompt will be enabled when aimed correctly at the janitor cart. Break the laundry basket and vault onto the shelf.
---
I‚Äôd call this a buff not a rework
---
Oh... I think can't you not report people on your own team? Cuz if it's not that then I dunno
---
Xandit
---
Well if he gets reworked and still has his barricades I would like this to work
---
Still waiting on a Cav Elite skin :/
---
Nah that would be OP
---
He doesn‚Äôt need a rework or a buff.
---
I don‚Äôt think we need any more counters to fuze I think it would be cool if you could detonate them with a small explosive like if on the top of the door there was a little explosive that would detonate when you shoot it kind of like goyo but it would only do like 30-40 damage to and attacker if they were on the other side
---
While I find it unlikely but believable that there are people who mainly enjoy t-Hunt there is not a large community.
---
I really hope it is just a big buff because I like his gadget concept
---
Excuse the little earrape
---
Nah I think there‚Äôs no reporting because that one is OP. He‚Äôs asking why his rank is lower despite the better stats.
---
Seriously how it would make fuze a lot more of a viable pick it would make a sledge size hole in the reinforcement and then a different op could come and destroy it of fuze could use a charge
---
Yeah I'm not offended dumbass. I can handle being insulted, but there's no need for it. It makes you look childish and immature, I was doing this more for you than for anyone else. OP is getting insulted by you, you're being aggresive to me, you're being calmly talked to by me. You're the only one acting emotionally and irrationally in this comment thread. If you can't handle someone saying something stupid on the internet without getting all upset and emotional, who's the one who seems less likely to be successful in life?

where are frost and lesion ? shouldnt they all be there too to greet the zippy?
---
I like how normal people in ranked always ban jackal cuz he's "op" and stuff like that but then you got pros that don't care as much and are just like "you know he's coming to you, just kill him lol"
---
One thing I notice a lot is someone will try to run around my shield and stab me in the back and I either get stabbed through my shield but the kill cam shows them running around when I didn‚Äôt see this at all, or I do see them run around and turn to block them but get stabbed through my shield and the kill cam just shows me either just starting to turn around when I die or just sitting there not doing anything.
---
Acog on lesion mine
---
Yeah but it would make all hard breachers redundant
---
How do u get up there? I saw shaiiko do this to
---
And I can‚Äôt edit. Shit
---
They are not anti consumer they are a business a businesses job it to make money they put cosmetics behind a paywall sometimes yea ops cost renown but you can grind enough to get an op in a weekend maybe two if it‚Äôs a more expensive op that is not what I would call anti consumer do I believe that season pass holders should get the premium pass 100% but just because it‚Äôs not that doesn‚Äôt make them anti consumer if you want anti consumer look at EA or Activision they are anti consumer
---
XIM aren't against the ToS. Alot of them are pc players who want to play on console for a heap of reasons. On any system the percentage of players who are physically disabled too is way high..   
---
there are other companies who aren't technically cheating but i don't think macros are fair. The ones who seem really suspicious like headshots every shot from ridiculous distances are probably ones who can afford a proper gaming chair tho.
---
Bikers don't have calm eyes. Sorry.
---
that is indeed the point, they won't say how long it took them because they know if anyone calling them out on their shit gets to hot they're ass is banned. You can make this in 5 seconds, so don't give them any attention, they pass it off as if it is their work, their creation. But when your creation took 5.37 seconds and you act like it's a masterpiece of art, you're karma farming. And karma farming is scummy af.
---
I think that‚Äôs why we‚Äôll never see another game with the cultural impact that MW2 had. Because I feel like every CoD since has been subtly trying to reach that goal again.
---
ngl I was really hoping you threw that straight into a Mute jammer on the last try, would have been icing on the cake
---
It upsets people because it‚Äôs a charge people dont want to have to pay more for especially if the skins are good too. Season pass owners like myself already paid 30 dollars for the ability play new characters for free and a week early, it seems unfair that we actually don‚Äôt get much out of the season pass then have to add the battle pass onto it if we want to support the game and the dev team.
---
doot doot miss skeltal

Someone in the thread claimed to have found a workaround, I wasn't able to try it out since I got pissed at a bunch of keyboarding pieces of shit so I'll try it tomorrow and I'll update you.

Aw love this! Good work man, glad I inspire more people to do the same!

Add a filter *creative*
---
Thinking about that placement a little bit more, it looks to me like it‚Äôs halfway decent as that outside window is more isolated compared to others since it‚Äôs in its own pocket with awkward elevation to look inside if you look inside from further back. But yet again with almost everything with mira placements, it depends.
---
I don‚Äôt even understand why people upvote all this crap
---
So what you're saying is you like to be a cunt and can't play the game the way it was supposed to be played.
---
lag switchers are the easiest for them to be able to nail too, submit a report on the plaqystation with their usernames and the time and date and tell them you have video. If they were using switches tho they're probably already been nailed, because a switch messes with the whole server it's about as subtle as a hard on at the beach
---
I dunno, I'd call it business.
---
Anti-consumer in my eyes is a pay to win model or something that effects gameplay through real world money.
---
you're the scum of this community, don't try to act like you inspire anything, you found a gold mine but the gold was plastic.

I dont think there is one. I saw a screenshot a few days ago that showed someone as having roughly 300 abandons

1v1 I'm in other objective... Can I be in two places at once??? And does the 45 seconds matter if the defuser is in a spot I cannot physically reach because you altered the game and took advantage of an unintended spot
---
Plastic's still worth something
---
Purple tarps was controversially removed. Many pro league players protested its removal, and it still isnt removed. Just all the easy ways are.
---
Even if he is a shit operator you honestly cant hate him (well i mean you can but not like jackal hate feel sorta sorry for jackal mains)
---
What material is that on?
---
&gt;Upon doing research, it may be because I bought a motherboard and CPU from a friend, because I was told that Ubi bans part ID numbers for some reason.

Unless you find someone from the Siege team that admits this I'm going to say whatever you saw to make you think that is wrong. I've played since the beginning, if hardware ID bans were a thing there would be much less cheaters than there were over this games lifetime and specifically there wouldn't be as much high profile ones currently.
---
Maybe because you missed
---
Jackal? Really? You ever wonder why he‚Äôs banned so much in ranked?
---
Nice you c4‚Äôd a recruit rush on plane
---
What are you mad because you don't know how to get on the 2f office peak on border?
---
You are not alone. I too have had this post removed.
---
Yeet'd when you should have Kobe'd
---
If you take advantage over someone else by exploiting the game, it‚Äôs unfair. That spot was not intended to be in the game for planting. As are many other spots. If you truly believe that it‚Äôs justifiable, then fuck you asshole.
---
*unmanned drones*
---
It's because you're rude.
---
Good thing it isn't ranked.
---
I see: Sledge, Twitch (Maybe frost mat) Kapkan, Fuze and Montagne
---
Wdum
---
HONKHONKHONKHONKHONK

https://youtu.be/lsaUnvgjhpQ its been in the game since y1 and is used in pro league, ive been using it since dust line released lol
---
gosh golly
---
The first thing you should do before buying an elite is to ask yourself 'Do I play this operator a lot?'. If the answer is yes, and you like their elite set, then buy it. In terms of good or bad it all comes down to personal preference. My personal favorite is Frost.
---
Surrounded by welcome mats.
---
F12 for future reference
---
no frost mat that is just part of the kap trap. the little black piece he said is an ash charge and the green piece  just holds it up.
---
Damn you called them out holy crap
---
Oh nvm you are on console this is so sad
---
wow dope
---
The fact that you took your time to find that video tells me that you have literally nothing to do and no life. Besides, I didn‚Äôt see him plant up there, did you? u/Sabenja did you?
---
My lord, how hard did you hit him? Freaking smashed his face in with one blow.
---
That‚Äôs the badge from my car lol
---
Do you understand how hard it is to actually plant up there. You need like 30-40 seconds uncontested inside of the bombsite. Its also not that hard to type 2 words into google.
---
Potato is inevitable
---
Idk why, I‚Äôve never done this, and I didn‚Äôt realize i did this until after, but i read this in an Australian accent
---
Posted something very very similar and it was taken down by the mods. I like your post, not trying to be negative.
---
Gang gang gang gang gang gang
---
Add me on uplay. (LoneSoldier.)
---
Keep doing these maybe you could do an ops face? Just a suggestion.
---
If you have control over site for that long why would you be using it to do parkour? What are you SpiderMan?
---
It's a free kill, so often.
---
Either you go near an enemy and became the greatest clay pigeon, or you go far away, and you saved maybe a second or two not just regularly rapelling.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work 100% of the time tho ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Change yer deploy mode
---
Who makes these? I want more.
---
All the time, in ranked a lot too. I have media keys where I‚Äôll mute it if it‚Äôs a tense or close game but for the most part (and even more so recently because it‚Äôs very inconsistent) sound only complicates things. If you know the angles and default areas you can play on reaction time and aim. Admittedly it‚Äôs easier to do this on attack for me and I struggle on defence.
---
He doesn‚Äôt own any other ops maybe
---
i smell a rat boys
---
The recoil on that Mavericks body tho
---
Since a lot of us play Siege and run into people like that daily, its hard to detect that shit
---
His sarcasm wasn't thick to the point of parody, it deadass just sounded like some people I run into in pubs
---
Plat 3, if anyone was wondering :)
---
Ikr your telling me and every round i went friendly she killed but hey we won the match so thats what makes me feel satisfied plus being friendly
---
For some reason I had decided that mute was still on the other side of the thermite charge and that I had to get clear before he shot me through the brand new whole in the wall, the way I went about doing so was running directly in from of both my teammates and the enemies line of fire...
---
I was wondering where my boy was
---
He was not having a family fun day hot I‚Äôll tell you that much
---
Pretty good not gonna lie
---
You seem to think that I'm triggered when I'm not. I'm just saying that while you have the right, you seem incredibly unlikeable for it.
---
Sometimes the reconnect prompt never comes. Start a ranked queue. It will say the match time is 30 seconds. You‚Äôll then be reconnected in 30 seconds
---
Imagine if the old kapkan was still in the game. As soon as the window breaks, she'll know her fate.
---
Plat 2 not using advanced drone settings.
---
No we don‚Äôt
---
Its a bit late go to bed, gang time over
---
That's why he is plat and we are wood rank.
---
i can help you with your math homework to the extent of my knowledges
---
Please explain your reasoning behind putting post-nerf Lion and fucking *fuze* above Capitao. 
---
I will venmo you $10 if you‚Äôre gold or better, because honestly, this seems like a tier list for who‚Äôs the best choice in, like, Bronze.
---
Cav is A tier, but Smoke is C??!?
---
FNaF in R6.....what did I miss?
---
This is insane. Definitely using this
---
GPS satellites
---
First thing peekers advantage does not exist as several videos have explained(eg Rouge one etc.) and u were just disadvantaged, because of ur ping?
---
I am lol
---
I am
---
Crop your videos.
---
How pathetic and salty can you be? Shitting all over someone else who's been nothing but modest just because his work got noticed and is getting some attention instead of you. Boo hoo. Stop worrying about other people, get your head out of your ass and fuck off this post.
---
turn on manual pleaseeee
---
Have you tried using the Xbox app?
---
Can u make one for buck
---
Haha that makes this even funnier. We just instinctually assume we have good tosses. I get it
---
I‚Äôm a PC elitist, but really dude? It‚Äôs cheating lol. Console players don‚Äôt switch to PC because they have no desire to. They shouldn‚Äôt feel forced too. You sound like a tool
---
I think it‚Äôs secretly SwaggerSouls
---
You were being toxic by messaging him like that. Tbh me and my friends would also throw the rest of an unranked match if the random sent that to one of us.
---
Ye
---
Lion from dota 2 lol
---
did u win the 1v1 tho?
---
Hello masian_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dde484/raliegh_major_charm_and_skin_for_sale/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Filmed vertically bruh
---
No, someone posted a video of them making one and they just slapped a filter on it. Took 5 seconds flat. Exact same outcome.
---
Finally someone gets it
---
Yeah I can't wait for Quarantine next year and you should check it out you'll probably like it, it's probably gonna be a continuation of outbreak with a new story.
---
If you have good aim then doing this unironically actually works much more than you would expect (at low plat)
---
I'm fully aware of that.
---
Metal Gear is a Kojima game, but nobody in their right mind would say that Survive is a Kojima production. It's the scraps of something great reassembled for a cash grab.
---
Same deal with Ubi.
---
It‚Äôs a headshot machine now
---
I saw the quarantine trailer it did lool amazing not sure it requires a whole new game they nailed it with the modes, but im not going to complain
---
From where you're kneeling, this must seem like an 18 carat run of bad luck.. Truth is: the game was rigged from the start.
---
I never see anyone complaining about the vector
---
This entire subreddit is art spam like that.
---
He links his deviantart in a comment
---
Edit: and plugs his instagram in another one
---
If it‚Äôs 1v1 and your opponent manages to have enough time to get on top of the cabinet and plant while you are still doing who knows what on the other site (which is literally just on the other side of a soft wall with a door right in the middle) then that is entirely your fault.
---
Unless you somehow manage to get in a situation where you are busy fighting someone and for some reason completely go deaf and not hear the defuser being planted then you should probably just break the computer where the vault is and save yourself the stress.
---
This is gold
---
Gold now :P
---
Insanity is... doing the same fucking thing, over and over again, expecting shit to change.
---
Shoutout to one of the greatest games of all time
---
No, they made Ubisoft games, with his name.
---
Definitely lesion. Then ying. Then cav.
---
Its not karma farming, hes plugging insta and and youtube, its total self promotion and should straight up be banned off the sub /u/Deosl
---
I think that the recoil is very manageable, I have gotten cross maps without much of a problem.
---
Total BS.
---
#WHAT IN THE GOD DAM
---
Tbh lately i heard so many complain about it, since they released Goyo's vector
---
Lol I was dying it was hilarious
---
I have all the ops
---
I completely agree with you, the vault isn‚Äôt even 100% guaranteed to work first try and the time you spend on that+the time you take to plant is more than enough to move through literally one door and stop you.
---
Just destroy the computer if it really causes that much trouble right?
---
For next season
---
you're kinda slow on the screen opening for a Plat 2
---
Looks kind of shitty tbh.
---
Definitely!
---
Well no dur I make 100k a season
---
Yep just came here from there. This sub is a fucking joke sometimes.
---
Exactly, didn't buy Goyo yet so i am not sure if there's a big difference or is it the same?
---
they can't see you but you can see them
---
Wait really? Since when?
---
Suka blyat! Don't tell me what to do, blyat!
---
Yeh I saw it, I don't do it like that
---
Her eyes need some work but nice shading
---
Alright
---
We've been tricked, we've been backstabbed and we've been quite possibly, bamboozled.
---
It's cool, but why are the eyes so realistic looking?
---
It feels like she's staring through my very soul
---
exactly what i was thinking like the rest is good but the eyes look real
---
yea ik,,, i can‚Äôt really draw eyes but thank you for the critique!! i‚Äôll make sure to fix it next time. :‚Äô)
---
Welcome to console only normally it‚Äôs the worst player that is trash talking and the top one getting 15 kills without talking
