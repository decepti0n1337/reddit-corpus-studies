Maps and angles this is honestly 70% of been good. 
---

---
You need to know the maps 360 degrees and this is where it becomes hard, you need to know your way around every floor, but also know what is above and below you at all times, as vertical gameplay is very powerful in siege, is the ceiling/floor above you soft or hard, can you defend the object from above or below? Do you need controll of the room above you to stop vertical takes? The maps been so destructible is what makes map knowledge so powerful in siege, on some maps just doing something as simple as opening a few walls and floors can create amazing lines of sights, that stretch across whole floors or rooms or even multiple floors, there's alot can be done. 
---
Then 20% game sense this comes from map knowledge and practice, just understanding how the enemy is going to be playing and predicting it, using all the intel to make informed decisions
---
Finally last 10% is your aim, this is just practice and building muscle memory, I'd honestly recommend playing at a low sensitivity as you need to be able to make pixel perfect shots at times, I play on 6/6 35 800 dpi and that's still on the higher side of low 
---
The main tip I wish I listened to when I started playing is USE YOUR DRONE AND THE CAMS. 
---
try to keep your drone alive during the prep phase. 
---
Don't spam ping on drones it gets them killed and found faster. (It's always best to make callouts over mic, but if you need ping the enemy every 5-10seconds to give intel if you don't have a mic) 
---
Defence ops like valk, maestro, echo and mozzie are all amazing for gathering intel all in different manners but intel wins rounds, 
---
We're as defence ops like mute and vigil can easily counter attackers intel tools in one way or another 
---
The attackers don't have any real "camera" intel ops for gathering intel, but have there own unique ways to gather intel, such as lion been able to scan the map, and ping any moving opertors, jackal scans foot steps and pings defences every few seconds, doki can hack the defenders cams if she uses her ability on the phone of a defender after been killed  
---
You need both map knowledge, game sense, and the ability to gather intel, or have intel fed to you. 
---
You need to be able to gather information, to make a smart decision, but you need map knowledge to be able to act upon the intel and need game sense to be able to put the map knowledge and intel to good use and make a smart decision. 
---
If your going to be entry fragging you either need to leave you drone where you planning on and drone your self and the best option is get a team mate make to drone for you, and have another team mate follow behind you, to refrag you, when you inevitably get killed 
---
But for practice get in the habit of droning everything your self, but don't over drone, drone 1 or 2 rooms, push up, drone the 2 rooms and so on  
---
Straight up entry fragging and using nothing but aim and visual and audio ques can be great for building game sense to natural instinct to play off in the moments you need, but be aware things like always droning yourself to get in the habit of straight up entry fragging for game sense and instinct can build really bad habits

would you rather that pink unicorn event instead?
---
Bet there was a huge argument as to who got to be Arthur
---
The update is still bugged out, you gotta restart the game and they'll pop up
---
Its not so bad once you get used to it, my friends and I used to play Secure Area exclusively, we had to adapt to pick and ban and bomb, but it’s fun once you get used to it
---
Cringy as fuck not gonna lie
---
Not gonna lie this game mode has made me great with a revolver and now I’m actually decent at the game
---
Rip dude, sorry your main got ruined by a bunch of exploiting assholes who can't win games legit
---
Quality post you made here....
---
Ok
---
Yes happened to me also. What platform are you on? This happened to me on Xbox
---
Mavericks skin makes me nut
---
I had it too, idk why. Also had problems logging in earlier today, and only noticed the reset after that, maybe it's because of that
---
Ranked, don't worry about your rank and k/d, play t-hunt, and I'd recommend watching some videos on how to improve, a guy called Aust1n makes some nice guides for how to warm-up and solo queue
---
How do you know what rank I am
---
Nah, what we really really really need is Nitro Cell skins
---
I just think it would be a good idea to make these event skins available for the people who dont want to spend money on the game, but would put in the time to grind out the skins they wanted.
---
Have you finished your placements yet?
---
Did not know this.
---
And now I’m going to pretend I still don’t know it, just because it makes it more fun for me.
---
No. That is not possible. That's the whole point.
---
I'm on PC
---

Thanks your shit internet

I love how I have the black ice for the commando except I’m a degenerate and can’t control the recoil in it

if you title something " Actual Good " good 99% chance its not going to be good

Why even bother stating what you edited

Idk why we can’t choose

They used to be obtained by gameplay. And I don’t think the designer fashion industry is a good model to follow
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Wait, are you a console player?
---
Cringe, nothing like a thirteen year old trying his best to be “triggering”
---
The fact that people haven't realized that Prismas aren't for tricking people yet is fucking mind boggling
---
Spawn peeks
---
It’s amazing how that works. Copper 4s are John fucking Wick all of a sudden
---
Same I'm sad I cant play this event
---
Are they gonna change ashes face again? She looks different
---
So you posted a month old screenshot of a ranked game for no reason?
---
Fun fact, Truth or Consequences wasn’t always named that, it was named that to win a contest for a show, I believe it used to be Hot Springs, NM
---
It’s been a little funky all day, try restarting the game, if that doesn’t work just be patient, my dad had his disappear and an hour later it popped up
---
I’ve won like 3 games in a row and still haven’t ranked up out of Copper IV.
---
acog is imbalanced in this operator tho
---
Integrity. Honestly idk just common practice on this here app
---
No problem.
---
Meh probably just eastereggs
---
This.
---
For Sunsplash there was only a few I liked. I wounded up buying the whole collection because why not at that point. Pretty annoying but what are you gonna do.
---
Cool :)
---
Yeah that would be cool too. I think there should be some sort of event currency that you can grind out with daily challenges or just playing the game and use that currency to buy a skin outright for more than a pack, or just buy packs for cheaper than a skin costs outright ri balance it out.
---
No. Kills. Don't. Matter.
---
If you're playing Ash/Doc every round and have 4 more kills than the guy playing Thermite/Mute every round, you're not actually doing more for the team than him.
---
Ok thanks, its been a couple hoirs and ive restqrted a bit, it will probably appear later tonight.
---
And thats another issue. Granted its been like that for a while. Still annoying af

3v3 secure area with only a bosg and revolver as your weapons

this is shit its not even entertaining
---
What am I missing here?
---
The whole point is to get people to spend more money to get what you want. This tactic unfortunately works and have been proven to work time and time again.
---
They would get less profit by allowing you to buy exactly what you want.
---
If it’s been more than a day or two, submit a ticket to Ubi, but I’d bet a dollar it’s just a little overwhelmed right now
---
When the April event game around I wanted that monty set so badly. But no shot I was buying a bunch of loot boxes to “maybe” get the full set. I would gladly dish out the cash for skins during limited events if they let you buy them individually.
---
I'm so glad they did such a great job with this while the actual game continues to be broken all season long.
---
Priorities.

Don't think they want bronze that ain't worth money they need more gold!

Restart the game, just like you to to claim the reward for any club challenge

Over 100 bucks for all the cosmetics and no way to buy a skin you want. Lmao Ubi you can eat the runny shit I took this morning.

I like how, similar to the April Fool’s thing, they just threw it in unanounced. Really gets the jump on us and never fails to impress!

So instead of providing advice or asking if the person needs help, you suggest that he just leaves?

Classic idiot.

---
Yes. Trying to figure out why. On Xbox.
---
That doesnt mean anything, How big is your group of people, whats their money situation like. Saying well my friends didn't get x, obviously x is a failure is just echo chambered thinking. 
---
Companies dont randomly add these features into the game, they do their market research. Yes for friends of lets say 40 people, it might be a better deal to have individual skins but if ubisoft can make more money off 10 people buying the full pack then they'll go with the random pack system. 
---
&gt;out of our group that was the only event our one friend Zeke bought the entire collection for.
---
And from my normal discord server of 75 people over 30 of them has all of the packs and most of the other people have gotten pack sets already.
---
That would have been nice
---
Makes sense but they won't do it because it takes resources and currently they don't have enough to even add new weapons, let alone a fresh mode.
---
Would love it, but I highly doubt it.
---
No operator works if you can't aim, Ash just has the easiest job.
---
Can't really mess up her utility, easy recoil, high fire rate, 3 speed, one of the smallest hitboxes in game which combined with the way latency is handled in game leads to some wonky hit reg, 2 of the better pistols in game and flashbangs.
---
The only downside is your utility is lackluster and that doesn't change how easy she is to use.
---
Thanks ubi.
---
FL Studio at the beginning? I can get behind this.

How fucking sad is your life that you have to come and be an absolute asshole to someone taking their time to create oc. You don't have to watch it, fuck outta here you toxic pos.

For reference, I'm on PC, so now we know this is a multi-platform problem.

So?

If you don't want to help, walk out and play with your 5 year old sister who happens to know how to shoot a virtual gun before she can speak fluently.

Sadly not :(

Wow this is the first post I’ve seen about this. Very original dude.

Shes balanced and still requires skill bud

Tou cant react in stopped time.

Cav is 27 Mute is 25 and Frost 32
---
No you just got really lucky. This happened too me twice. They tried booting at the very last second of the game after we won but if you reset your game you get the elo.
---
meant to reply to the top comment saying frost also doesn’t rely on technology
---
Someone actually just mentioned this in chat on PC about a minute ago. So you're not alone. Hopwfully it'll be patched soon
---
Oh

I'm glad

Nobody asked.

Same thing happened on PC apparently restarting fixes it. Got told that after I reattached everything
---
Try getting the y3 pass but then when y4 came around have them all taken away complain to Ubisoft and them not do anything and reunlock them to find out that the special stuff you get for having season pass ops aren’t there anymore
---
That's fucked, probably the same toxic people who TK in game.
---
Another one
---
So you are telling me that the most preferred gun sight is bad?
---
Something's wrong in that assumption.
---
Mav and Kaid definitely work the best with cowboy stuff with their bandanas and lack of gear. None of them are bad, except maybe Rook, his is a wee bit silly.

Brother with due respect we have since seeing these complaints since year 1. Im sure if anything was realistically possible it would have been done by now. To add context fortnite which happens to be one of biggest (if not the biggest) game of all time could not conquer that problem. Think about it they had a 1billion dollar war chest to improve the game experience and they had to rescind the change due to false detection. This is highly likely a problem that will be address next console gen not this current one.
---
You Elon Musk or some shit. WTF?!?!
---
Never said she was unbalanced and every op requires skill if aim is the only thing you're looking at and even then she has it pretty easy compared to other ops.
---
Thank god. Thanks for the answer!
---
Also there are no spacefiller charms, all cosmetics are actually usable and look really good!
---
I checked all the ops no op starts with K and Blackbeard name starts with a C so it's probably a reference to another game
---
Mr.Joestarv
---
We already have that, boss.
---
Well we weren’t at the end yet. It was doing the final kill cam for the round that brought us to 3-1. So we still had a round to go.

Nope don't have a way to convert screenshots from ps4 psn app don't work

You are single handedly changing a balanced mechanic. Powerful, but that's what the defenders deserve when they failed to prevent plant all while they had 4 minutes and time advantage and area Advantage and angles advantage and Intel advantage and CQB advantage. Why else do you think defense win percentage was so high for years?!
---
No offense, but This is a worse idea than allowing disabling after the Timer, and that in itself has been proven countless times to be bad.
---
Is the laugh sample at the start Matt Mercer?
---
They always do these events when I don’t have Xbox live ❗️
---
The holsters are not meant to fit the revolver pistol. So it probably clips over it. By not showing it, Ubisoft doesn't have to worry about remodelling the holster.

I saw the plat charm on your F2

How can we been certain green wasnt on the take as well?

---
I thought so too, it just said connection to game lost and wouldn’t let me re-connect so I assumed it must be a server hit then I went to R6Tab and saw it recorded as a win. Maybe if a game is terminated it records who is winning at the time and gives them the win? Either way I’m fine with it lol
---
Happened to me on PC. Not sure why
---
Had the title been something like "Meme Edit, hope y'all enjoy" I would certainly have followed that philosophy. However, the title not only brazenly claims that the video is funny, which it is not, but it implies that other meme edits are less funny, which is what I took issue with. Also I find it hilarious that in a discussion about internet videos you resort to personal insults because you have no idea how to argue your point.

That's some Mandela effect type shit lmao

Yeah it fixed it thankfully, thanks

not really
---
This is the most fun I've had on this game in a long time. Me and my mate were gonna have a few games and move on and we ended up spending all nihht on it
---
instead of attacking the sites they should just attack the accts themselves i feel like that would be more effective
---
indeed

indeed, a nice one

It's the amount of rank games within the season. Your acc levels doesn't affect anything

There is if you actually watch what happens and why it happens... Only thing that is the same is the place and the strat..
---
IT DIDNT WORK!!!!!! REEEEEEEEE
---
Kills score or anything you do in game doesn't effect the amount of elo you get. Only thing that matters is the amount of rank games within the season, your rank and the other teams avg rank.

Woah
---
What happens if you don't get that headshot? Because headshots are much more rare than body shots. And with the Scorpion you likely won't even hit anything at all. But if you do, much more will you get a body shot. Then guess what, you won't do much damage. Especially not as much as they'd do to you. I'm not going to use the worst gun in game when her shotgun is so much better, especially for her. As it's the only utility of her kit. As her secondary gadgets are quite useless and don't help her specifically. The shotgun does more damage, has better recoil management. And better range up until the pellets start to derender. Not only that it's the only way Ela can breach soft surfaces, which for a roamer is very helpful.
---
Honestly just rework clash into a new op without the shield. Shes stupid
---
Where?
---
Happened to me too. Quite annoying in a ranked match to load up with barebones guns.

I have a song for the event called old town road

The old Hereford Base was originally going to be where you could test out guns at the shooting range in one of its spawns. I wish they implemented that. Fort Truth should just be a permanent game mode
---
Just play ranked - for me i never get teamkilled or stuff like that in ranked but casual is just toxic
---
yeah but it's really bad, and it was designed the wrong way???
---
Yes but that shotgun is the most accurate in the game. You can snipe with it lol
---
In fact, you can't. I mean you can, but you're putting both of your lives at stake if you do, and to very little pay off.
---
You mind if i buy it ?
---
I agree. Favela is garbage. The only thing that makes it fun is that it *is* so terrible. It’s hard enough to play secure area on, but make it Bomb and it elevates to nightmare fuel for defenders. All those walls...

"The kelvin is the primary unit of temperaturemeasurement in the physical sciences, but is often used in conjunction with the degree Celsius, which has the same magnitude. The definition implies that absolute zero (0 K) is equivalent to −273.15 °C (−459.67 °F)."

Castle gave everyone on team rainbow the n-word pass.

This is the biggest fucking stretch I have ever seen

Hmmm not the most important stat, when the gun does no damage. Has a horrible fall off range. And best of all random horizontal recoil. Random is bad when nothing else is random one. And competitive random makes something when nothing else is random the worst thing to use. If you can't know where your shots will go. But the enemy you're trying to kill will know where their's is likely going to. You're at a major disadvantage. No rounds per minute is not very important with the Scorpion. With it's low damage and very slim chance of knowing where your rounds will go. Rounds per minute really means nothing.

Me and the boys reposting but somehow doing it wrong.

It’s -273 and if you recall from 7th grade math 200-273 is -73

You can buy them from the packs screen. Other than that no

Why doesn't the recruit on the left have a gun? Smh literally unplayable

I thought it was a lighter for a second

Then I guess every thing I learned in undergrad school is wrong then I guess I better go back then

But Capitao was like “ we don’t tolerate  o'driscoll here in this town”
---
What’s the issue?
---
How, can I cannot stress this enough, DARE you.
---
Typically u get 1 free pack at start of event and a challenge to earn a second. Other than that u gotta but more packs of u want anything else . No direct buys on this event stuff all packs. Tho there are no dupes so u can straight up buy all items ( costs 70$ usd )
---
Yep, I'm on Xbox. Just started playing a feew weeks ago. I always choose to play again as team if we win and literally no one ever does. I don't get it. I was starting to think it was like a thing or something to just never do that and I didn't know because I was new.
---
Yea. The cards are made so they should just carry over. Maybe if you have the gun it might work but I doubt it.
---
All my ops were reset to default after playing Showdown but none of the other stuff...
---
I’m plat 2 so people actually play objective in ranked at that elo lol unless you mean casual which is insanely boring considering the rounds are like 3 minutes and people usually just sit on a roof or something until there’s 15 seconds left. I just want a fast paced DM mode where you keep respawning and just fragging.

No it’s capitao and krossbow

No. Don’t worry it’s not the Cav, but the Lesion that snuck up behind me...
---
He doesn’t really feel 3 speed to be honest, like Ash feels suuuuper fast but he doesn’t.  Same way BB feels like 1 speed when he’s a 2 speed.

That would be cool if you were not the attacking side meaning the law at the end of the match

You reversed the "Sub to me please" so now everyone subbed has to unsub

Hey man don’t hate yourself! You probably have a playstyle a lot like mine, with a focus on surprising the enemy or using higher ROF guns. Thats no reason to hate yourself, you just have different skills &lt;3
---
Game balance doesnt care about realism. 
---
Vigil can avoid detection from lion scans that use echo location. 
---
Mute can jam blitz flashing that clearly has a wired lighting system. 
---
Almost all of the operator equipments are unrealistic, the guns are unrealistic when it comes to damage and the gameplay is unrealistic.
---
When you complain about this sub but do exactly what you're complaining about

Restart game
---
It's in her prison wallet.

Theres no reason they havent implemented anything to counter this stuff. Like lets fix the ranks now while ranks are wack because of bomb only in ranked?
---
I wouldn't mind so much if we could buy sets individually and didn't have to dish out a large chunk just for a lootbox type mechanic and hope that we get what we want
---
it worked, thank you I would’ve lost my mind redoing everything
---
Yeah the whole loot box mechanics always bothered me especially with this game.

Is it possible to play this mode on a custom lobby?

 I'd love to play this when I got 6 people in my party (I usually do custom matches if my party go over 5 people)

Bro a diamond can play with golds, now you're getting into territory where you'd stop friends from playing with each other, to far.

They definitely are more than any other game I’ve seen. People are so hard to new people as well, the community is far beyond toxic.
---
Nothing special. You just happen to be playing people dumber than you.
---
Yeah it’s strange. This is the most toxic game I’ve ever seen, and it’s so odd. They are so hard are beginners as well like it’s ridiculous

HOORAY, CLASH MAINS ARE BACK!!!

 Could be Caveria and Kaid.

Or Caveira and Kapkan.

Or maybe Caveira and Castle.

You just stated his answer lmao. Because humor is subjective, this post shouldn't be titled as an actual good edit. Also, fyi, critiquing the title of something is not equivalent to personal insults

 Ok. Then smurfing and burner

WHAT

You changed the future Marty!

Would they use the in-game names or the opxs real names?. I'll find out.

Well if that is the case, then just ignore the post. It was a mistake on my part. Just a confusion.

Very simple but effective operator to play for beginner.
---
Step 1: Tag behind the entry fraggers.
---
Step 2: Don't die. Get to a corpse and loot the iPhone.

Steo 3: Harass call the defenders twice then you can do what you want. By then the defending team should be dead.

Who said Ela was a roamer? Lol. Her gadget, secondary gadgets and weapons (after nerf) already placed her as a semi-roamer/anchor.

After completing and claiming the award I had to dashboard and restart for the pack to show up. You might need to do the same

Hmmm designed to be a roamer. First given the gadgets of a roamer. The guns of a roamer. The main gadget of a roamer for the most part. Roamer.

Hello LoneWolfStreams123, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c8k1ab/streaming_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Breaching soft surfaces is very essential for a roamer to be effective.
---
They were being toxic the entire game, I assumed they were playing dumb. Like I said, I got confused.
---
Looks good 👍
---
The issue was present no matter who knew. It had the potential to ruin the game for everyone, so the only good way to fix them is to make them extremely public and widely known so that they get immediate attention.
---
Except I found a way to play effectively without having to breach soft surfaces. 
---
I play well with the shotgun. Why is that so hard for you to accept?
---
Looks like you hade a great time on siege today. I had people yelling and screaming at my to kms and shoot up a school. Nice clutch though.
---
😕very true
---
When we getting recruit skins

They're basically considered a police force though, and police forces aren't bound to the Geneva convention

Boy have you lost your ~~mind~~ gold cause I’ll help you find it!
---
Correct good sir
---
Listen bud, if I can't play with my friends who are lower than me, I will throw until I can, and then smack lower ranks anyway, because I'm pretty much smurfing. Playing with friends is all that keeps this game fun and no one diamond or plat is gonna roll over and just not.
---
BIG FFFFFF, NOOIIOOOOOOOO TYTYTYTYTY
---
you play well with the shotgun? Oh why am I even arguing then! But still having the extra utility is better than not having it. And when the guns stats are majorly better than the Scorpions in many more ways than one. Guns much better to use.
---
You ok dude?
---
Had that happen to me once because i picked maestro and i think someone else wanted him
---
*common duplicate*

I didn’t think of it that way.

Castle and kapkan

They all the same anyway so it make no sense plus i join in the middle of the game.

And just like that, someone on the enemy team got kicked.

Just restart the game so it will resync your account.
---
In most games yes, however for some time Siege didn't for some reason.
---
Well my league is High Gold / Plat. Literally a good Capitao can ruin a Clash.

You just posted cringe. You gained downvotevote

dude nobody picked glaz anyways just put him back to what he was

everyone taking about skin, from my side we need server skins...........xD

Thanks 👍🏻
---
I mean, Uno is cannon with the Siege/Ghost Recon/Splinter Cell/etc. universe. We need an Uno game that's just all the ops playing Uno and if you get +4'd you have the option to call someone's bluff and then take them out.
---
There's still a lot of people who struggle with clash in that rank.
---
Ily bruh bot

This is a good idea

How these look amazing

Isnt the same as the mvp in the other modes?
---
Same, first time for me.
---
There's one for kaid too
---
It doesnt show the losing teams mvp normally
---
Nothing like doc with a naked shotgun
---
Capitao + Kaid cause they're the old farts.
---
Maverick because he has no counters and his at is nice
---
Youtube is your friend
---
ASDFmovie
---
You mean nothing like a good with a naked boom stick :P
---
Yes, but shotguns don’t get a one hit headshot
---
In general yes. But the showdown mode is a much shorter game mode. Hence they have reduced the chance gain when playing this mode and you get only 0,7% chance increase per win and 0,3% chance increase for seasonal pass.
---
Great budget gpu is a radeon rx 580 for like 200 bucks and it can handle siege well enough, right now is the best time to build a rig

Probably related to the outbreak scene where jaeger dies. Nice of them to leave that as an easter egg

I really dont know why you need an explanation to the "all black people look the same" trope.

That is perfectly cut, bravo. Scary as hell.
---
Minor comment but I got the same head gear from my first pack and was as disappointed as you. It’s good looking but why would you use it? Also I noticed and that your profile pic is the jester from Darkest Dungeon and I about screamed because I found it funny because mine is as well.
---
Capitao is Brazilian

So I showed this to my sister who plays R6, and she replied with this on Discord:

One of the may Operators from the popular game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege deserves death.

Obviously he is, see the guy on the right?
---
She's not an anchor in any way. It's almost suicide to do so with her. Her mine aren't meant just for her team, they're meant for her and her team. They benefit everyone, at least when they do benefit. If they meant to make her guns not have range, god they really over did it. Low damage? Random recoil? A fall off range that is standard to every single smg on defense for the most part? Wow it seems like they really were going for lets make a operator that's still a roamer, into a roamer. They over did her nerfs, she is horrible at range yes, but that's mostly due part because the randomness of her recoil. Which I'm not sure if it's a bug or not that they've just overlooked since even to me I don't believe ubisoft to make one gun have a random stat while every other gun doesn't.  She's a roamer no matter how you look at it. She's not an anchor in any shape or form. Sure maybe for being close to room she can be great for maps like Kafe. There being a parcial roamer and staying somewhat near objective is pretty much a given for any operator who isn't staying in room. But Ela never was or never has been intended to be a roamer, nor will she likely be ever. 
---
If they have tried to make her a anchor by nerfing as much as they did and literally making her Scorpion the worst gun in game. That's quite pathetic on their part. And I really don't think even the most biased and blinded people who give no damn about the games structure, would likely be just a little bit pissed. Because that's not her role. She's to gather info and be a roamer while doing so.
---
YOINK
---
Restart your game and they'll reappear 😄
---
Every clip I see people get packs at .50 or 2.50 or lower, but I can’t get one at 85.70%

Planes not a bad map tho not for ranked but for cas it’s fun
---
Oh your right, theres no such thing as a black Brazilian. Or even one that would be mislabeled as black.
---
Why are you over complicating this?
---
A controller and no Xim setup? You must be a true legend nowadays.

It's like pitting a bunch of grade school kids against a steam roller

I don't doubt that there are black Brazilians, but I don't see anywhere in his bio that he's of recent African descent. This isn't really complicated, so I apologize if you're confused for some reason.

Glad to see my game wasn’t the only one to witness such a miracle

Hello dylanplo, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c8lfoe/a_glitch_that_unequips_all_your_items/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I got every headgear except the ones I wanted.
---
Just speaking my mind
---
Recruit, everybody's posing while this dude is there saluting
---
There's an event called Showdown. It's set in the Wild West and they added a new type of secure area (3 vs 3) and a new map called Fort Truth. On this map every operator is limited to a BOSG shotgun and the .44 magnum revolver. As You may already know there are obviously new cosmetics in premium packs too.
---
Maybe
---
"She is given a decent chance to get up and close with them."
---
This has nothing to do with the gun and more to do with the fact that Ela is a 3 speed operator. There, the argument that she needs impacts shines, because she has to be close. There, the argument shines that you can rely on your grzmots to create that chance. I don't know what you're arguing for here.
---
If you listen carefully... 2 shots were fired.
---
I think Jager mains would disagree
---
You couldn't be more wrong. D2 is the all glorious Diablo 2 not trash destiny 2
---
Then again he actually has a decent gun
---
Road rolla da!
---
Nandatte?
---
New western event that came out this morning. Special game mode is 3v3 secure area with only BOSG and revolvers, really fun. They put in a ton of new skins
---
You have provided little to no genuine reasoning other than "she can't" for why she shouldn't roam. The grzmots and close angles of sitting in a small zone for more of the round create opportunities for the recoil to be less of an issue. But still you insist, that, "she can't."
---
We still brought up pre nerf, to discuss about where she was versus where she is now. Which is why it's questionable to talk down about me using release Ela in a comment.
---
Draw a globe then. lol
---
Actually fun fact i got black ice for the Fuzes ak :)
---
And thanks

Yet you exclude the part where you get a common

I also thought of Lando as soon as I saw Capitao’s new headgear. L

I want to be able to apply skins onto Clashes perfectly smooth bald head.

What?

I thought of this too but when I said draw everyone just killed each other and not the 1 v 1
---
Make arguments maybe?

Completely different company so unlikely

you can if you wait a year

I got both took pieces and I'm pretty happy about that

Smoke has cracked the language of Siege. He is Ascending to another realm

This is pretty much the epitome of a broken game, when not even the ground works right. Whoops.
---
Next mira!
---
I want the alibi one I just wasted 300 pesos (around 15 dollars) for 6 packs and I didn't get it
---
Much like how this game works, this makes no sense. Congrats tho. Hope my 72% finally gets me a pack.

Now I envy you even more. And hate you. But the good kind of hate. God damnit. Congratulations, again.

It's so fucking unbelievable. Just because these cunts can't fucking play...

It's almost as if the map has a Magnet hidden in the center of the map.
---
it takes incredible core strength to maintain that position  and move at the same time, impressive
---
I wouldn’t ban her cause she’s easy to counter but if she gets banned in your games you are likely somewhere around silver who just haven’t figured out how to counter her...

I was thinking that myself

it was basically. they also made the hipfire worse so she's less braindead to play.

How is that even possible?!? I thought you got a minimum of 2% for a win?!?

Vulnerable players does not equal whales though. I'd wager most of us (me included) are vulnerable.

You mean grenade yeet simulator?

Okay buddy, you've never seen Maestro banned.

I always see either him or echo banned, you know because ranked is played on bombsite, then lesion because he is S tier no matter what map or mode, then I see Cav banned for whatever reason.

are there not 30 skins?
---
you get 30 skins for 60€... 
---
that is 2€ / skin dude... cmon
---
Sort of a ‘lurker’. So you roam in the immediate areas surrounding obj, that way you can go flank, or defend if need be, depending on the situation. This tactic is usually used with 2 speed defenders.
---
They would still make money if this was obtainable both for money and completing quests...
---
Outplayed.
---
cheers
---
Bruh got 7 downvotes for saying “yes”
---
try ethernet cord for that **secure** wifi connection
---
Would be great he had an ADS mounted by the table for protection.
---
You should try exercising your ability to not speak up next time.
---
I got alibi skin and gun in the 2 free packs. I don’t have alibi.
---
nice cosplay
---
Had this happen too. Just add the attachments on as you play the operators over time. The cosmetics can go on the second time playing. Thats what i did.
---
I’m not mad everyone has their own critique at something but let people be you know? If you don’t like it theres a more polite way of saying it like “hey you can improve on xyz”
---
Merican ones should've been done first. They're the most important. God bless Pulse, Castle, Thermite, Ash, Valkyrie, Blackbeard, and Warden.
---
100%
---
yeah elo system is a disgrace i was banished to silver early on in the season and i play with my friends who are all mid gold, and although i always top our team they stay much higher than me and we’ve played over 200 games this season
---
Leaning can get me at times trying to be quick but in reality super slow, I have encountered many’s cavs tbh
---
Again, at least the hat stayed on lol
---
I had 1000 hours on Xbox when I went to pc so I got placed gold 3 just by having map knowledge and knowing better angles but your aim really matters as you get higher in the ranks
---
#NANI?
---
You gotta tap it twice as fast as possible my guy
---
holy shit
---
Yeah, but half the time my goes up to 65% and no pack
---
I have 500 hours on Xbox, and I think I’ve adjusted well, got 3 games left to be ranked, 6-1. I generally think ranked is slower and easier than casual, against golds anyway
---
Copper? No. Cardboard
---
I'm on PC but after playing showdown myself my attachments and skins were also reset.
---
Best thing to come out of this event. Needs to be on the front page.
---
acog pizza
---
&gt;After a few check-up, I found out that my ISP sometimes went lag spikes, but no packet was loss.
---
Did you check your connection to the game servers?
---
Awww thanks :)
---
***That's how ~~Mafia~~ R6 works.***
---
Oh I know
---
don't you think the people making the decision to keep doing the loot boxes have done some research to see what's more profitable? what research have you done?
---
Happy cake day
---
It really is a welcome break from the norm. Be aware that deaths/kills are almost instant.
---
r/shittyrainbow6

Hats off to you sir

The most annoying thing in this is that you can pla as an Diamond wirh 4 copper players so that you get silver/bronze  I think.
---

oh shit i landed a 0,7% aswell back when the packs released, thats just fingolian forest-magic working as intended.

I hate hearing that one

Oof oke

Wow that's a lot of games already.
---
Noo it cuts too short, I wanted to see the chat reactions :')
---
See Mule, he don't like people laughin'. Gets the idea they're laughin' at him.
---
I'm having this issue too. 
---
I remember around last year, MSI Afterburner reported around 20\~30% CPU usage on R6Siege during gameplay. I don't know what happened since then, but I'm noticing now more on Operation Phantom Sight that my CPU usage is always around 80\~100% CPU usage to the point that my game even crashes and stops for a second  or two during gameplay. Ubisoft should really look into this.
---
My specs btw:
---
i7-6700K overclocked to 4.4GHz
---
GTX 1070
---
16GB Ram 2x8GB 2133Mhz
---
There's no way they make as much money as they projected from this one. I would have bought the entire set if it was $25, and the exact way they have it set up now. I would pick and chose ops if that was possible. But $70 for everything. No thanks. I'll buy some beer.
---
+5750 is nice as hell though

c'mon i have 70% and I CAN'T GET IT.
---
I call it the skull meta i always win when i use it
---
OMG, what are the odds of that?

Loot boxes are loot boxes, It's still an issue.
---
Shes a keeper.

Are you sure? I just tried to shoot you an invite, but it didn't go through

The quantum realm cuz jager fast as fuck
---
You mean a Deloreon?

What did you get that’s the question.
---
removing acog from twitch's F2 should solve it as well
---
Black ice for fuzes ak :)
---
Bruh she needs hitbox not skins
---
bruh 🍑👅😝🤤😎
---
Why?
---
You need like almoust 20 win streak?    Possible?  Yes.   But  you need to really nail it 😅👍🏻
---
Thanks man, I’ll do what I do best, and RUN THAT SHIT!
---
Propose, now
---
Oh shit
---
This has been posted a million times
---
Yes. I felt the need to assume that it was from that movie since the event has taken place from the past.
---
Maestro is the cutest of them all though.
---
That should be vigil
---
Well I hope you do get banned then.
---
Play in a five man and learn communication and maps. As you play, skill will get progressively better.
---
They added a 3v3 mode? Damn I might hop on with some friends
---
Quick the rest of the gang RUN AWAY!!!
---
Do everyone a favour and go away.
---
I would say fuck off but I’m tryna be nice here
---
Unpopular opinion: I always thought Twitch’s elite looked ugly.
---
I know right? but it would take ages to write one, at least on Ps
---
I'm actually rolling in a hole.
---
1 of 1
---
No it really isn’t, as I said nobody plays Alibi for her prismas there for it doesn’t matter what her prismas look like
---
Oh, sorry I have poor vision so i thought that was Ps arrow, but still that clip was Impresive!
---
You can stop worrying about hunger now.
---
And yet i cant get one at 65%
---
Can you send me a link for that? Because when I looked for it on amazon it said it was currently unavailable
---
I couldn't get a 93 one time and this guy gets a 1.7
---
big bruh moment
---
i once got 3 in a row
---
I play alibi primarily in casual, so I take the chance of success as a fake over playing seriously. It's very satisfying when it works
---
First , you have to kill someone to even use your ability. Second, the comms are jammed for only 5 seconds per use with a 8 second cooldown (which i didnt precised in the post , sorry about that).
---
Holograms do their job either with or without skins, the "pretend you're a hologram" strat is more of a meme than an actual viable strat. And besides, the skin is amazing (all of them are)

Dont know if you can access it because i am from Germany, but 7560 Credits is the only one you can buy.
---
It makes sense. That's just how odds work. Even something with a 0.0000000000000001% odd can happen.
---
All I remember is how unplayable the game was with all those bugs and unbalanced operators.
---
Are we supposed to be impressed?
---
How is .7% possible?
---
Its a weird bug, it used to happen to me when they released new seasons in Y1 and Y2 but it hasnt happened since.
---
Dam that's like a dream gf
---
Maybe i just didnt punch the right one then
---
I've gotten a black ice on this kind of roll
---
Aww man, Rook is so fat so it will take ages for him.
---
next minute: JIBOIA
---
Op? Okay 2nd lowest damage. 18m fall off range. Only a pathetic 15 dsmage at 18m. Onlygun to have a random stat. No not op pal.
---
You said I’m wrong but in the end you basically agreed with me so I’m confused. I’m saying that if ubi doesn’t want alibis Holos to reflect her skin then they should at least make it so that you can customize her holos to wear anything but the default skin since that’s what everyone is looking for the moment the see alibi is in the playing field.
---
Thanks. I restarted it again and it was just a glitch.
---
Castle look like a chunky man
---
Watch out! Recruits stand it has the ability to freeze time!
---
that looked like a vigil though
---
Last I checked he had one of the lowest pick rates. Could you provide a link to the pro league win delta.
---
Yeah
---
Hmmmm and what happens when you get the much more common body shot? Because then you do very little damage. And that's if you hit,  due to it being the only gun with a random stst. It is already one of the worst.
---
nice.
---
Ik
---
I honestly like defending more than attacking in this event. Granted, im just rushing as recruit on both sides,  so my tactics dont change up.
---
What that his guns are quite mobile and his gadget is centered around the objective? Okay.
---
Crazy we both basically said the same thing at around the same time
---
how does he even eat that pizza?
---
When I see an opponent I don't shoot him immediately, I try to see what skin they have, take a screenshot, open a reddit post asking how to get that skin, answer a couple comments, then go into chat, type "nice skin" and then shoot.
---
I mean, it's typical diamond stuff, you wouldn't know
---
Alililibi.
---
 Oh that's unfortunate because on [amazon](https://amazon.com) com it says unavailable [https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Rainbow-Six-Siege/dp/B073QR45V5/ref=sr\_1\_2?keywords=r6+credits+pc&amp;qid=1562165036&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Rainbow-Six-Siege/dp/B073QR45V5/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=r6+credits+pc&amp;qid=1562165036&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2)  
---
Thanks thought.. :) Guess I will have to just wait for ubisoft to fix the issue
---
It's a bunch of cosmetics so stop complaining. You get no advantage when you purchase them.
---
I personally think that his is the best out of them all and I really love that style they made for him
---
its not working on PC either, feelsbadman
---
Punk is one of those skins that's just better than the elite imo. Punk and Lumberjack for Buck will take a lot for me to de-equip them. I only just took off my Twitch elite because i got her cowboy skin
---
“Oh? You’re approaching me? Instead of defending the point you’re running outside?”
---
“I can’t spawn peak without getting closer.”
---
“Ho ho ho. Then come as close as you like.”
---
It can go negative
---
You want to cop it but you don’t play as him very often? What’s the point then? Only splurge money on elite skins once you’re super comfortable with that operator, wow
---
I mean Rook just got one of the best Pro League sets of all time, so it’s not like he really *needs* a great cosmetic, unlike Alibi.
---
That you can roam perfectly fine without impacts or soft destruction in general. I realize it’s a higher level of skill required but you can do it, buddy
---
Highest I’ve gotten to is 70%...
---
I was making a joke my dude
---
*Is playing call of duty*
---
HERETIC
---
Who puts a turret in that room lmfao
---
ur right
---
Oh boy here we go......
---
MUDA DAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
once i got an alpha pack a 91%
---
I bought the whole halloween collection and that was 50 euros. Ubisoft should make it so you can buy the individual skins, uniforms and headgears. nit with rng and a fucking pack. maybe a pack for the free packs you can get but not if you are going to spend money on it.
---
Feels bad man. I'm playing from South Africa with 200-300 ping consistently. Amount of times I get rekt by players with 9 ping is mad. But I keep at it. I like pain apparently.
---
Smoke main actually
---
Done, and it worked. Thanks!
---
Why is it so hard to see in this mode? Intentionally bright?
---
Marry her right now
---
We all have bad games, nothing we can do really, he just assumed he knew everything about my play style after one match
---
Why do you cheat?
---
Why did you start cheating?
---
You like maestro so echo could be something for you to try as a backup
---
Kapkan is the same
---
"Fuze this mother fucker"
---
If you're playing against inexperienced players who just rush into a room, if someone drones or just checks before peeking 100% you are getting killED. Besides, if you are wasting time looking at what skin a player is using you lose gunfights even without alibi.
---
Try this, have Alibi on team and do the same trick but use any other op, it will still work, the point is not that they see 3 people and shoot at random, the point is that they get distracted
---
People like this ruin the game. Like damn, do you not have a career to worry about or something
---
Rook kinda looked like he didn’t get the Wild West Wednesday memo so he slapped a bucket on his head and called it good
---
Do you cheat because you are bad or because you suck or because you are trash. Or all of them?
---
Lion forces every defender to stand still for a few seconds. If you move for a second to evade some bullets or projectiles, you'll get spotted and very likely killed.
---
It takes away the skill from R6 and is just not fun to play against an operator like that.
---
He ruins roaming completely when you add Jackal to the mix.
---
Until this season he was completely banned from competitive play. His gadget is worthless now, guns aren’t that great either.
---
Jackal is getting banned way too many times to really play with him, also his gadget isnt that great in higher tiers.
---
Blitz Monty clash and echo: we did it boys , we cured cancer.
---
I've been told she is an entry Fragger which is not my play style at all so I don't know if i will get her yet
---
I've said this once and I'll say it again. They're cosmetics and don't hold any advantage at all. Stop complaining about the price of cosmetics.
---
Restart the fucking game
---
I agree with him. Running around with the pistol cuz it's easier is lame. Whip out the bosg and have some fun
---
'Damn boys what do we do now? the room is only gonna get fuzed  but we gotta camp in there.'
---
Sleepy night nights
---
I have this and the (blood rust?) for the shotgun pistol
---
Luck 100
---
First time I’ve seen someone defend console, as someone who’s played on Xbox since Black Ice, I thank you.
---
Haha
---
Umm no
---
I am a bit concerned
---
I hear guccihighwaters in the background
---
The bullets will go to where the point of the triangle is pointed
---
I like how the Recruit on the left is caught for corruption.
---
Meanwhile I hit 30% 9 times out of 10
---
Double, instead of 40 I got 80
---
And why the fuck would Ubisoft disable challenges anyways ? The challenges weren’t working because of some issues with the website fyi and not some scheme to get more lootboxes
---
He is in every post i see
---
Wow, thanks for showing us. We haven't seen 5 instances of this on the front page for the last day and a half, nevermind the spam in the new section!
---
Sure, but they will never do it cause then people would just get 1-2 skins they want. This would have negative impact on income.
---
I only do ranked with a mate because of these sort of people, thankfully I just ignore it
---
...and I lost all my weapon customizations. wtf..
---
It's a loot box which is gambling. It doesn't matter if the case is cosmetics or an item which could be pay 2 win. The whole idea behind loot boxes are bad.
---
As an IQ main. I agree!
---
Oh yeah, my bad. Outbreak collection was also very expensive, but it came with 2 solid universal skins which in my opinion were worth getting.
---
Yes
---
You’re a jerk😢 I’m on like 50%
---
well back in my day...
---
f
---
That’s crazy man, like I can understand a little bit because it’s ranked, but to the get kicked from casual it’s just stupid, I really don’t enjoy causal anymore, I just outright don’t even play it unless I’m with my mate.
---
You don’t have to buy them
---
I haven't
---
She's 17
---
He is everywhere
---
It seems like
---
Bo3 you heretic
---
They are bad but I'm tired of people bitching because they didn't get what they wanted from the two free packs
---
It really got to me, how he judges me after seeing me play 1 game, like he suddenly knows me like wut.
---
Texas ranger! Texas ranger!
---
You might just have to restart the game
---
Like DOTA!! with custom sounds and other thing s
---
Totally agree fellow Lesion main, hate these type of players who pass judgement like this.
---
My friend and i couldnt figure it out either. If someone has the answer, please tell us
---
Rookie numbers

You need to frame that OP
---
I got a 69% pack yesterday
---
Your wellcome
---
Disabling Challenges removes your ability to get the Showdown Packs associated with Challenges. I doubt Ubisoft is doing this on purpose because the entire store isn't working.
---
Just kidding
---
If everyone was running around with the full Ash set that would be boring. I like that items are rarer and more valuable, and it's fun getting a random headgear and seeing what renown uniforms you can match with.
---
It's called a 4k btw
---
Well yeah ik but don’t you think a a free pack would give people a a better taste of what’s in them further making them buy more. I just don’t see this guy reasoning on how disabling challenges pushes lootbox sale s
---
Ah sorry I'm some what new
---
Man, i can hear this picture!
---
We need a surrender buttom with the final animation of showdown event for live game, arrest other players may be funny... In rainbow six raven shield, the player can arrest npc's
---
My second pack hasn't shown up yet. I won like 20 rounds and even hit collect on the challenge and it never showed up. Any ideas?
---
Rip Bobo the Chimp
---
Can't be done because of Data Limits
---
Noooooooooooooo!!!!! That is not okay
---
What, how do they have deployable shields?
---
I hear you sister
---
Good
---
Mate if you see something that says "Free tomorrow" but you can pay a small fee to get it now then people *will* pay that fee.
---
I see you are a man of culture
---
Haha... Plan
---
“He’s there! He’s right there! In that room!” Totally accurate
---
People have not been appreciating all my RDR2 references. I've been getting kicked every time I tell them I have a plan.
---
You really had to wiggle your dick around in the faces of those if love the event , aye ?
---
Well , listen , yes this has nothing to do with rainbow six siege but it's a special event , it's NOT meant to be canon or like the original game , it's made to have fun , laugh around In it , it's completely fucking normal to have something completely off of the main game to break the repetition .
---
Now I don't care what you want to say about the skins , I don't care regardless , skins mean nothing to me , but gameplay wise , I gave you the answer .
---
Now , this event is optional , do you want people to have fun or do you want to gatekeep fun for attention it whatever other selfish intention you have ?
---
As much as I want them to do story based events too , Ubisoft ... they're bad , I personally don't like them because they don't know what the community wants most of the time , I'm not with them , but I'm with the players , and if the players are happy with something currently happening let it happen , no harm .
---
Have a good day , and for once just enjoy life outside , being on the internet for too much creates negativity (as it's been scientifically proven) , take a breather , realise that if some group likes something and it creates no harm you should let them be , and criticise if you want , just don't gatekeep the fun .
---
Again , have a nice day , and take it easy .
---
Darntootin rootin shootin
---
Oh shit, my bad, apparently it actually posted, reddit for me kept saying an error.
---
Oh your approaching me? Instead of running away you come right at me?
---
How does the banning system suck? And if you think that, how could they change it to make it better?
---
Like the TF2 Spy?
---
Don't be rude. He didn't know. It's not a big deal.
---
They never show pc clips anymore i wonder why
---
As someone who plays on both Console and PC. I can tell you right now that there are plenty of dumbasses on PC. 
---
Just because it's easier to aim on PC doesn't mean that you can't be oblivious.
---
2 of the Zappy assholes at once
---
Same thing happened to me last night so annoying
---
Don't be an asshole. He was happy to find it and wanted to share.
---
No, try restarting your game. It worked for me.
---
Can confirm, asked his wife.
---
They ruined it...
---
Ive noticed it too
---
Yes it happened to me yesterday. Try restarting your console.
---
He would only have the Thermite Icon above his head but no name. Since there is no team outline he would be easily treated like enemy.
---
I’m gonna try this but I already equipped stuff for buck so it may interfere
---
Why that almost worked
---
You get 0.7 percent because of the new game mode
---
Came here to say this.
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
Yeah but why cant we just get a small casual mode like this to keep in the game? Doesnt need to be tacticool 24/7
---
Nice bro.
---
This game mode's overall color is mad washed out, I don't know what they are trying to convey, the internal side of the area secure objective is very dark and I can't really see things clearly.
---
Tan
---
Pinkish with hint of gray
---
Preynk
---
I remember this so much with my cousin, it was still just as tense
---
Yea I feel you on that. But at the same time, if the majority of the player base isn’t playing with a predetermined plan in regards to banning operators why is it even a mechanic? I love the other changes to Ranked. Bomb only 3 round rotations is really fun balanced and exciting (coming from someone who only played secure area for a year) but dear lord I think it’s a pretty useful and awesome mechanic. For pro league. Not the general siege community
---
Restart your game
---
Recruits don't conform to your ways!
---
Happend to my friend. It also happend to me before, I think there is a chance it can happen if a lot of items get added to the game at once. Since this usually happens when new content launches.
---
 I’m not a child of god
---
No joke, just dropped an ace with only Fuze's ability my second day of playing. That was also yesterday...
---
Nice bro!
---
1885!!! 1885 the Docs alive!!
---
Wish I would've recorded it.
---
I've restarted many times.
---
Looks like the color of Grimace’s deceased body after sitting in the sun for a week.
---
My buddies and I have talked and we think a weekly community ban of one attacker and one defender in addition to the two per game would be great. Imagine like Monday when you booted up the game you were give a prompt that asked which attacker and which defender would you like banned for the following week. The following day the ban would be enacted and carry through until the next Tuesday when the ban chosen on that Monday would be enacted.
---
Pulse wouldn't sit on OBJ from what I recall... Near it yes but rarely ever on it
---
Yes.
---
As i said, he shouldnt be a polite and kind king, he is more like a warlord , tyrant, or more.
---
Was 1885 the year they went back to?
---
Yea I completely understand Echo. I think on some maps Echo is insanely more useful at plant denial than he is on others. But I think on certain maps it would be more beneficial to ban a different operator.
---
Guys suggest a card for Tachanka.
---
NOT the emperor pls
---
boi it says "expired"
---
That was truly sad to see
---
I wish I had this charm
---
I’ll still use the skins and still play Alibi. I use them more as intel gathering than trying to trick someone anyway, most people are too savvy to fall for a static hologram. Use that speed, use that loadout, running and gunning.
---
try it it's so funny, also gmod is funny.
---
Not me
---
QUIERES ?
---
Sorry bro but youre to late :c
---
It’s ice. He was introduced in operation black ice remember.
---
Sitting over in high silver/low gold, what’s it like in diamond
---
This happened to me when I changed my PSN ID. I just restarted the game and it restored all my settings.
---
But it's not supposed to say that. That's the problem.
---
What does it mean in this context?
---
“Adi you gotta get off the turret.” Challenge accepted.
---
At this point it's just anecdotal but from my experience on PS4 there were zero roamers and rarely people outside obj. I moved to PC during Op. Health.
---
I think it either reverts to what you had before or the new load out overrides the previous so nothing to bad
---
Damn you maestro main
---
I get killed a lot so can see my outfit
---
[deleted]
---
The 1% will use it and no one will stand a chance, eventually that will catch on. It will take time and then will be adopted. Ranked already starts to take stuff from PL and CL. Just takes time.
---
You could open them only yesterday i think
---
What’s the gamemode?
---
To strike fear into your opponents... and that fact that some uniforms give you an advantage depending on the map
---
One of the few times people havent banned the "Banished 4" it really made a difference, i think it was Mute, Thatcher, Hibana and i cant remember the last one but it made it more interesting i couldn't go to my usual picks and people didnt go near Cavi or Jackal or Echo.
---
IMO banning ops like Tatcher or Jager is more useful to the team because then you can defend or attack with more ease or with decent tactics but i play solo que on the rare occasion i try ranked so ill never have a team to coordinate with.
---
Nice objectification of women.
---
My guess is that it's due to their [code injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection#Cross-site_scripting) prevention. They'll have to figure out how to recode it to be more efficient.
---
I wish terrorist hunt classic was you know, actually the fucking way terrorist hunt used to be, none of that nitro cell and suicide bomber bullshit
---
What?  The event started yesterday.
---
A very dark salmon
---
Still put it on glaz anyway
---
It almost seems like this kinda stuff is happening all the time since this new season came out
---
I think it's a reference to "Winchester 73".
---
Yeah! I was just scrolling through my feed and then I saw something quite familiar which then I realized that I was in the clip lol
---
I know what your thinking...did he shoot five times or six?
---
Next level game plan right there! Hahah
---
Yare yare daze
---
That is not true at all. Except at the highest levels of play gun fights very very rarely come down to the level where a lighter vs a darker outfit making a few ms difference in time to spot opponent changes the outcome. Especially in siege with it’s very short ttk and 1 hit headshot mechanic .
---
Besides if that really matters to u there are renown skins. I am mostly refering to the R6credit and alpha pack skins
---
I prefer twitch's new uniform but it's still a good skin
---
I think reducing the time period for bans would reduce my frustration
---
In pc you have an instant message in chat saying “fuck you” XD
---
I’m going to Pc soon, can’t wait
---
See here is why echo and blitz and jackal are annoying oppressive ops but once you reach high plats and diamond no one bans cavy cause she is useless everyone bans lesions cause he is annoying oppressive see the trend
---
Once again, I'm only mucking about. Don't take anything I say seriously.
---
Then siege would be 100+GB
---
Jackal looks like he really let himself go. Poor guy isn't doing very good since he keeps getting banned in ranked
---
I had completely forgotten about that. It took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out what was happening the first time I experienced it.
---
If it ain’t pink think idk what is
---
Delete your account, why?
---
Do Vigil! Spook boi needs card!
---
For the most part this buff probably won't change really anything. 99% of the time its extremely obvious to tell if it's fake or not even if the alibi matches it exactly. For the most part people aren't going to stand looking stupid when they can help their team win a fire fight against the attackers. It only catches players who have that reflex on 11.
---
The alibis I see put them in front of windows so if they wanna shoot they have to get marked for their troubles and can be cleaned up after the fact or just be pinged repeatedly and can't do anything about it unless they use some utility and time.
---
Losing team on showdown never does.
---
Should have been “committed suicide over loss of acog”
---
THESE ARE SO GOOD WOW
---
Make it an optional download like hd textures
---
I think she’s fine, if someone is going to shoot at a hologram it’s going to be due to reaction to seeing an enemy. Her holograms work better as an obstruction of view and are best used on windows and doors. I have a different skin and headgear than the default and still get people to shoot my holos. She doesn’t need a buff
---
You guys act like we’re playing on mobile. Most console players are using headsets the thing is tho that you don’t notice people playing normally you notice the 1/100 that is playing without a headset
---
Its an alt account, it was causing issues, my main is fine and well
---
No that's just because casual gives you 2% for a win, so it gives you the percent after the roll like it always does, and its different for every game mode.
---
I will be a PC player by the end of the summer lol
---
Why can’t they destroy the defused with c4/impact nades
---
Haha lord chanka haha funny
---
Man I meant to say Thermite but realized I enjoy his guns and thought the next one that came to mind. I'm on my lunch break sorry, that was a bad example. I'ma leave it up as a sign of my ineptness
---
A friend of me is like: 2,30%? Yeah I got one.
---
Well....it helps when the other team are stupid :\
---
at least 2 of my teammates were in party also in my team platinum and a copper 4 (apparently you can still party with someone on the total other side of the whole rank graph
---
Personally would rather them focus on in game problems rather then this. I don’t really like it but I could see some liking it because it changes it up.
---
Ok now that's scary. I'll have to try it out in ranked personally, then again, pick and ban Bois would ban cav right away lmao
---
This man playing rainbow in a space station
---
Good idea :D
---
wait they took away destroyable ceilings?
---
You drone on T-hunt 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I understand how often people have tunnel vision because even I'm guilty of not seeing enemies out in the open sometimes but how does no one hear the zapping sounds from the bomb being defused?
---
Why do people still respond to these kind of people? Just hit em with the ez pz
---
Just Saying Maverick Is So Rewarding To Pick Off Headshots
---
It matters if you like it not anyone else likes it it is a game it's escapism it's all about you
---
Not sure when but its been out for a long while already
---
Just a little bit.
---
I dig this idea
---
What in-game issue do you think is the most critical for them to fix, then?
---
If I’m pushing too much, I apologize.  I’m just trying to pick people’s brains and see what they think.
---
Hello zac_person420, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c8rja2/aim/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Game was even easier with FUZE during hostage
---
If you mean ways to stop tking there will always be people that are assholes
---
If you mean get rid of friendly fire then that can be exploited easily
---
Why does every capitao main also main crab rave?
---
I hate how they never change the outfits of recruits in these events. I get that they want them to keep the classic look but at least put a cowboy hat on them or something
---
Thank you for the info!
---
If you don't mind me asking, what software/setup do you use?
---
He cut it early because he killed the hostage
---
Stick nades XD
---
I appreciate the help!
---
Imagine the amount of money a recruit elite skin would bring in.
---
Link?
---
IMO twitch elite ugly af the only good thing is that your drone is harder to spot
---
What it would do would free up one ban on each side for strategy. You wouldn’t have to ban echo or clash or blitz every game because they would probably be the weekly bans. The goal would be to eliminate ops who are completely op and when left unbanned completely screw the other team.
---
Haha it's all good
---
Sorry for having an opinion?
---
And instead of this Ubisoft could've made a fitting event. Bring some more Lore into R6...
---
The ganeplay is optional... the cosmetics not. And in the future I will see Cowboy hats... wondering though if that's the worst considering we already have literal pink Unicorn skins, Tophats and skullheads...
---
Maybe you should realise that, the same how some groups like something, others dislike something.
---
It be your own niggas
---
Pink... Why would anyone say this is red?
---
Hostage down
---
Not the entire set though. 
---
20 euros for a matching uniform and headgear sure.  Still gives a high price point for everything so whales spend a fortune to get it all whilst letting non whales buy what they want. 
---
Just because the system works doesnt make it good for the consumer.
---
I had one get between the ceiling and the floor and bounce into another room and kill me
---
Thanks u/Adamski1409 for the suggestion
---
Montage would become perhaps the strongest attack pick in the game immediately if he required no coordination with your team.
---
They have to monetize it thats a fact. 
---
but they dont have to be so harsh with it.
---
Just restart your game
---
Idk man
---
Fuckin dammit, the fix is not simple at all, this has been said over and over but people don't get it. The rason holograms can't be matching the player model is that decoys are not rendered the same way as players: from my unxerstanding, it is a static texture map over a static object (it's like saying bandit's batteries appearence should change according to what he's wearing), therefore devs would have to create a texture map for EVERY POSSIBLE combination of uniform and headgear (std unif + std hg, std unif + season pass hg, season pass unif + std hg and so on). This would grow exponentially as more cosmetics are released.
---
OR, they would have to rework the decoys to be rendered as a player with cosmetics (instead of an object) so the engine would need to render 13 players instead of 10. I guess it can't handle that, so we are stuck with standard decoys.
---
Sorry for formatting, i'm on mobile.
---
Okay.
---
even around high silver to high gold lesion is banned almost every game too, and for good reason.  Lesion mines are obnoxious as hell to play around and it's not fun to step on 7 lesion mines you didn't see then die when you're pulling them out.
---
Good stuff man 👍
---
Outbreak had a different recruit
---
I almost read it as "fuck t hunt," which would've been equally applicable.
---
I used the packs to destroy the packs
---
Secure
---
No ones saying rainbow invented the concept there just saying no one did it when the game first came out
---
R/satisfying
---
Now I feel old
---
Jesus christ Ubisoft can you please ban Clash again.
---
So every round 10 operators are banned? Or does siege take a majority vote on who to ban for the week?
---
I only had garbage
---
Also theres many fewer blitz and jackal bans, and alot more capitao
---
Disconnecting would be a big one. Although I can never tell if someone quit or dc. I would say it’s 50/50. I get dashboarded probs once every other day. That drives me nuts!  There are a few other but they are not as big as this one.
---
It’s very repetitive, just in general the gameplay is just boring, it’s like they took the recruit rush meme and made their own meme out of it but worse in every way
---
I’d rather play RDR TDM
---
True I haven’t seen a drop of jackal but blitz has gone down and cap has gone up
---
Lol meant to reply this
---
Your a god. I was about to cry
---
Np
---
I really don't like people like this. There's a guy at my school that plays siege, and he is basically those types of people. His reasoning is that if you aren't at least Plat 3(he's plat 2) then you shouldn't be allowed to play ranked. Period. And if you aren't at least Gold 4, you shouldn't be allowed to play for the next season, except for T hunt and custom games. Fucking retard, I want to punch him in his stupid face.
---
Ive seen a jackal drop in plat 1, and also increases in hibana and maverick
---
Lose everything
---
So if I don't have like 5 DLC ops that's not okay?? Just checking haha
---
Only with pistols, shotguns and mp5
---
Majority vote. 10 ops is way to much
---
specifically for that set of stairs. unironically spent 5 minutes trying to find that damn thing
---
They probably didn’t add it. Keep in mind showdown is a casual game mode, and you can vote kick in casual
---
Shield Team Six executing cornered rogue Navy SEAL, colourized
---
Yeah, it’s happening to everyone. Restart your game, that usually fixes it
---
Strength would be great
---
So then 2 ops will be banned or will there still be a pick and ban?
---
Thanks, still working on getting better with photoshop.
---
I had that idea too. They should have a headgear for recruits in every event. Devil horns in the Halloween event, bear ears in the April fool's event, and a cowboy hat in this event
---
ok m8 thanks for help
---
Reminds me of a narcoleptic nug clip, just me.
---
I miss the old siege
---
Again , criticism is alright aka your opinion but you were gatekeeping too .
---
As I said I have my own dislikes against Ubisoft , their skin choices and all , having buck with hazmat suit misinform you of a finka and so .
---
And I said as much as I want more lore , this is no harm , and there's no harm in asking either but don't gatekeep .
---
And I said too that I'm okay with criticism , which means I'm okay with different opinions , however criticism and gatekeeping are completely different you were gatekeeping .
---
Another thing people misunderstand and I'm saying this to make you see that I can tell the difference between hate and criticism is that a lot of people hate critics , that built over loving something bit too much or having them getting used to hate that looked like criticism therefore they hate against everything that is actual feedback and criticism , and surprisingly , it's very common .
---
I answered all you've said right now in my previous comment , read twice before replying .
---
Idk i think its really funny, they are embracing recruit as the memeiest operator and I 100% dig it. Instead of thinking of it as recruit not dressing up, I like to think that the other operators didn't let him.
---
Lilliac
---
I play mostly on pc and there the recoil is ok until 2-5m but on console its hard even to hit a god damn Drone
---
I remember when I got my first cluster charge ace. Good times
---
But, where's the link to it
---
It could be I’m in cknsole rn but for me I’m in diamond and jackal is banned every game lol but I have seen some mav bans no hibana ones tho
---
Just really riled me first game!
---
Definitely hit either shoulder chest or neck. That’s a solid runout though and props to the Zofia for hearing it and reading it
---
I mean they could be derankers
---
They can rejoin it’s just the interrogation actually goes through the minute they disconnect ...I’ve done multiple test
---
I don't think anyone has ever said that Ubi isn't allowed to make money. The issue is the unethical and slimy way they're making this money. Locking any content behind a system built on RNG is wrong and we shouldn't support that. 
---
Call it gambling or not, this system is dirty and it'd be much more consumer friendly to let people choose the skins that they want to buy. Defending these mechanics ultimately hurts you the consumer because you're not paying for something you want, you're rolling the perverbial dice for want you want.
---
You wouldn't accept this in real life when you go to buy clothes for yourself, so why are you accepting it now?
---
My anecdote : I've been playing since launch on Xbox, and there have always been roamers. Only back then the team would yell at you and vote to boot. It's much more accepted now. 
---
Now they only vote to boot for major issues like not clutching, having a stupid name, or being a solo with a party of four. :(
---
Still pick/ban, this would be in addition to. It would kinda be like when operators were banned because of glitches, being completely independent from bans within individual matches.
---
I play xbox, but granted i havent played in a few weeks. I also tend to play in at least three stacks, so were often also facing teams so the bans are much more targeted
---
Cool, but u know if u showed that in ranked it would get banned :/
---
 But that wouldn’t solve the problem you were talking about at all, it would make it worse.
---
Man, this makes Veitnam look like a joke
---
Funny 😂😂😂
---
Ba dum ch
---
Perfect 360... On console... Hmm...
---
How so?
---
Yeah I always 5 stack and we just ban jackal and bb a lot cause they r annoy
---
HaHa CoNsOLe ScRUBs lMaO
---
it has the most percise dot
---
People would still ban the Same operators in pick and ban
---
How doo u know this, it was by mistake
---
I asked him if there are enemies and immediatly after that he got destroyed
---
M_A_Y_O#0349, that should be it. My UPlay name is Mayo_and_Eggs.
---
Any noise at all can completely cover up the zapping sound - that was the one advantage of the old smashing animation in that even if there was noise going on there was motion you could look for.
---
I’ve only spotted a couple locations, the cave with the wooden 3/4ths wall being one of them, but they aren’t that consequential or have much strategic significance
---
Or slowed down
---
Yeah, from playing both platforms though I can vouch that console is harder to be good at, while PC is harder to get used to at first, I’ve played console daily for years and still have many points where I’m just decent but have moments where I’m really good as well, I think this was just that moment of not too good for the other team 😂
---
*ahem* have you tried restarting your game?
---
Back when roamers didn't exist
---
Yes there’s a 3v3 cowboy showdown event active
---
Maybe because it ruins the fight in a sense of fairness.
---
I think you're in the wrong neighborhood buddy.
---
If you know where the spawnpeeks are...either avoid them or drone out spawnpeeks you know are prevalent in the site you spawn at and  keep your head down soldier.
---
When everyone is excited about new event skins and I just enjoy  [this](https://imgur.com/a/1XMOMJg) . Good old hibana face on only one skin
---
Matimi0, MicrowaveGaming,  Zironicdk, Beaulo, TheGodlyNoob...
---
I love how they are downvoting you for asking a question, classic Reddit lmao.
---
😭😭😭
---
And then they're like "well I was there when she came out so I know what you mean" and that all but confirms that the highest rank that person has been is copper 1.
---
This mode gets boring after 2 matches. Why do people eat this shit up so much? It feels like what's great about siege is lost in this game mode.
---
(Happiness noise)

That happened to me I was pissed

Wait till you get there I've be at that high before the best feeling you will ever have better than getting married or even being given millions of dollars

Time to deforest the entire fucking map then.

Could take a while though, especially on Zavod 411 or the Final Stand maps.

I’m never going to see them the same😂😂

This has been said many times since Para Bellum and I agree with you but I don’t think they have the technology for it

Here we have a cheater.

QE on PC

Friends and I finished the game as all recruits so it was just a bunch of modern masked men robbing some cowboys
---
Why are you running the iron sight???
---
I thought I was the only one that missed the game with less ops and simpler time. I really want a event where it's just the og ops
---
^
---
Stay calm.
---
Well they’ll be happy to see you out there
---
I see nothing wrong.
---
Just add arcade mode with all the past events

Yeah still mad I don't get a hat I get a hairdoo

Always reinforce

Looks same to me.

I'm just a fan of the show

You mean to tell me gridlock and mozzie were under those balaclavas? Now maybe you could argue black is slimming, but i dont see how mozzie put on an extra foot in height.

How can I break it? I am targeting the wrong grave?
---
Seems fine
---
I’d trie to restart the game 
---
And load back in
---
Ohhhh it’s because ones a attacker and ones a defender
---
There should be a section for lesion's elite set, or you can access it by going to his headgear or uniforms.
---
Just for the sake of my curiosity, can bandit hook up wires to it? What about an emp towards it? Etc.

its the same for every operator team art im pretty sure. It already doesn't make sense that you're fighting members from your own unit
---
No because all of rainbow six siege is a simulation, the opponent called opfor is a made up opponent made for drills and mock battles.
---
won in showdown\* sorry
---
Just found it under the Operator section, not the shop itself.
---
Thanks!

*\*Laughs in iron sight\**
---
HELL 2 U!
---
Doom slayer or goblin slayer? I assume the latter
---
So it's not an anti-consumer practice because... Cowboy costumes?
---
?
---
nahhh... if this is a gamemode at least needs 10 more micro maps, at least one small map inspired in every existent map
---
About 3 fiddy
---
Smooth ;)
---
Then it would only lower performance
---
You just have to relaunch the game, thats what worked for me at least, im on ps4 and pc but I havent played on pc with this most recent update
---
     I am also new, not only that but new to PC too, so it's a learning curve, but I've been getting better just playing and experimenting with operators.
---
     I would say don't listen to people expecting you to be an expert out the gate, it is an established game so most people know it very well and think you know every strategy. On the other hand a few people have been helpful and given tips and helping out.
---
You don’t really a Acog to counter spawn peeks, if you see a broken window, just shoot at the opening. You can also drone out the spawn peek areas too.
---
Capitao is white now
---
the Map is already more balanced than favela and more exciting than hostage.
---
If you play with friends it's a quick fun mode, also for 1v1s it could be nice too
---
Hadn't played the game in at least a year.  Recently came back and am having trouble adjusting because it's like a completely different game.  Attackers rush in as fast as possible, not seeming to care about the win, more about getting a kill or 2.  I main Fuze but it's basically impossible because everyone just shoots out the windows asap.  All defenders now roam.  Plays completely different than it did just 12-18 months ago.   Also I'm trash but that's a whole other story.
---
Looks pretty gay
---
No, im just a retard and tried this over and over. Of course i restarted it.
---
No problem!
---
Yeah, I have a 2060 running 720p so I’m not super worried but I won’t upgrade the graphics to High res
---
Relaunch the game, supposedly loads in your customizations after.
---
And if I wasn’t why would I say I am
---
Well, fuck me. Saw this on Steam
---
This always happens
---
How do you do that? *F*
---
Its different, its a nice change of pace no one is saying 'replace 2 bomb, pick ban competitive mode for this'
---
**F**
---
***F***
---
I've had one bounce on theme park where I fuzed the room next to the hostage (he was in the drug lab) placing my charge on a window. I set it off, 5 seconds later, the round ended.
---
One Pucking PUCK slide off to the right, through the open doorway, at right at the foot of the hostage. He went boom...
---
I was later sent to Jail for my war crimes.
---
🗿
---
Very pale/muted purple
---
Haven't tried that gamemode yet. How quick are the games? Are they as long as normal matches?
---
There isn't supposed to be a comma at all
---
Not really bothered, I played it to get the challenge and I think that was enough for me.
---
Twitch is supposed to be a drone operator, not a sweaty one. Yeah the ADS time should be increased
---
You should definitely try it! It's really fun, it's basically a 3vs3 Secure Area. The rounds are short, I think 1:30.
---
Uuhh no..? Not everyone bans those and just banning more ops is just bias.
---
Hello fellow Ela main. I'd love to jon you but I fear we may have some troubles in picking our baby on defense.
---
They clearly make more money this way or they wouldn't do it.
---
People are toxic that that on console PERIOD. Doesn't matter what you're doing, doesn't matter if you did something, you'll get kicked.
---
Active defence pizza
---
There was a petition to remove an Australian politician for his comments after the Christchurch terrorist attack. That one worked iirc
---
R u serious, no, then there another ban wave of same characters til recruits left...
---
[I wish I pulled that from the alpha pack, I have her legendary rose uniform &amp; her legendary headgear. Just missing that.. Congrats!!](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/dTcAHZc)
---
This is the greatest thing I've seen
---
Yeah that’s why I said I doubt it would happen cuz it’s pretty out there. Lol
---
i mean they did it for the r4c so...
---
How the hell would this be mnk 
---
Like have you never seen a high sensitivity console player before.
---
It’s a spectator problem
---
It’s just a horrible idea with no thought put into it.
---
I'm pretty sure it never countered again
---
Yeah pretty much it was an out there idea I’m  just bored and thought about it
---
Does this count as r/titlegore
---
There is always going to be one operator that is hated by the majority of people so will be banned 99% of the time but auto banning these operators will draw these bans to other operators. Do you autoban every operator till there is none left to play?
---
[Dammit, there's a whole set?](https://i.imgur.com/1H89mqW.jpg)
---
Mainly the map
---
You have an idea alright. A very bad one
---
The problem is most people will quit playing Showdown as soon as the "smell of new car" fades away and they get bored of it.
---
Besides the Showdown Packs, there are no rewards to keep players into this mode. If Ubi wish to keep it available after the end of the event, a daily Renown bonus could be given by playing at least 3 matches to keep its match queues alive, otherwise it would only be left forgotten.
---
A 3v3 mode would be nice
---
Now that I think about it this is probably software gore
---
😂
---
Just don’t. Please k thanks.
---
jackal, blitz, and echo arent spammed banned in high rank
---
Oh I know that trick too it really is a classic but have you heard about the breach charge turns into a reinforcement. That’s something special
---
I, too, ______
---
Or no commas at all also works
---
Yeah I’m not in high ranks 😂
---
U must be fun at party’s
---
No
---
Because your not high enough rank, it happens way more frequently at diamond because all the booters never lose, thus have 6000 + elo
---
For some reason it also has massive amount of brightness, gray lighting, or dust in the map. Makes it impossible to actually see the enemy at all, especially if they are inside the building and you are outside. I don't understand why the fuck ubisoft keeps intentionally adding stuff that makes it harder and harder for visibility in this game. It neither looks good nor feels good. Siege already has shit-tier visibility, but this gamemode is breaking some records.
---
do a t hunt in under 1 minute with renown boosters
---
I guess its already 100+GB
---
Did you play a discovery match before the casual/ranked match you played?
---
I thought Mavericks arm was twitch’s until I double checked.
---
theyre making a entire game based off of outbreak
---
"Ubi is the worst! Such a shit company! God dont they know i cant afford western packs?! I could code this game better. Im fucking done with siege"
---
Thats normal
---
They mean ALL P90s will have access to the ACOG. 
---
The R4C is only used by Ash.
---
Huh?
---
how in the hell do people prefer this over Rainbow is Magic? You guys make no sense
---
no
---
Yes only in casual cause anyone with half a brain is gonna turn around after they hear shit breaking behind them.

Nobody looks at what you're rocking first. If they're the kind to fall for Alibi's, they're twitch shooting. You're blaming your own suboptimal Alibi play on her kit when realistically it makes no difference.
---
That would be fucking awesome
---
Jesus Christ, it’s Jason Bourne
---
Yesss
---
The one for the Sonic Movie worked.
---
Damn that’s sick. 
---
I got the wood grain and red maple leaf one. I dig it.
---
This doesn't have to have anything to do with the games you had today. This happens when the cheater is banned and he could have been in your game weeks ago
---
I play with no sights every time I’m on defense.
---
controller takes more skill
---
Those are rookie numbers. Once fell asleep while searching for a game and woke up an hour later still searching.
---
take twitch revolver only in t-hunt classic on hereford and try to do it as fast as possible over and over and over and i guarantee you will get better with it, as for the bosg your better off not using it because it’s EXTREMELY inconsistent.
---
Can't.
---
Pc busted till next week maybe week after but then I'm in NZ so 8+ weeks till I play again
---
Lmao made the guy delete his profile. I’m wheezing.
---
Especially as clash
---
God that must behow I sound like when my brain forgets everything as I try to call out someone.
---

3v3 secure area (plays more like elimination) with only the bosg and french revolver on a new small western themed map.
---
 
---
  It's nice, but I would have preferred a decent team death match.
---
What do you mean showdown is ass
---
No because it's from 9gag but because it is as funny as 9gag
---
i think it's great and all but it gets stale imo after three or four in a row
---
If I could comment with a picture, I'd show you where my friend hit 60,869 ping
---
You realize banana for scale did not come from 9gag lol
---
But for what reason would do that?
---
Obviously Gridlock kinda let herself go once she made the team.
---
Yeah now do it against mid-high golds
---
FOOKIN LASERSIGHTS
---
Maybe they should keep all special gamemodes in the game, run a playlist that changes gamemodes  each week so that we don't have to wait for random events.
---
Hibana looking real cute
---
That’s why playing with friends is better. Banning ops can be more tactical depending on the plan
---
This type of shit happens in Gold but I still can’t get good enough teammates to get out of Bronze I, I’m big mad
---
i can barely pull a 1-4. thats great
---
as a silver its okay
---
Pretty sure it’s near the water station near spawn.  There’s another one to, but I don’t remember where it is.
---
Lol, Doomslayer doesn't talk.
---
‘I had a lucky game guys please tell me in good’
---
Yea, my best is 19 and I haven’t gotten close since
---
Nice flair
---
No way😂 I can’t believe I’ve walked right past this
---
against silvers no
---
When you play in Australian servers
---
What is this not normal? I always smell my crotch before every match.
---
Could be better
---
"Everyone is stupid except me."
---
Don't worry ab the dead one
---
Same
---
What this guy said
---
Nah if you don't have 20 kills and 0 deaths you're not good at all /s
---
People hate us no matter what:(
---
I think part of it is that the game gets really intense, and when you suddenly realize that you are in ABSOLUTELY no danger, your brain just stops working from the endorphin release.
---
We must stay strong my friend
---
PAN SHOT
---
Yay
---
Yeah, but that was because he lost in the election, which he was always gonna lose according to the polls
---
Look up her BMI, she’s literally obese.  Like I don’t care how muscular you are, you don’t make it past the obese threshold with just muscles.  Not to mention she doesn’t look remotely in shape even in the husky sense.
---
As someone who speaks Arabic I am physically incapable of relating to this joke.
---
Yeh it would be nice to take a break from the regular modes
---
Thank you man for the tip.
---
Thank you for saying this. PC players on Reddit seem to think all of us console players are complete morons.
---
they're just racist pricks
---
Obviously since you posted it you think it’s good, do you expect everyone to bow down to you now because you had a good game? Good job on doing well, but this post just seems like your sucking your own dick
---
I like this a lot actually because I enjoy the events and wish there are more of them
---
Link please?
---
Yeah because it’s just a game and it’s humorous which is good for my mental health
---
I just got that yesterday!
---
Eyyy, 69 upvotes *nice
---
Oh oh if this is console then he would've been fine, props to op though, I was pretty high but I thought he was using a mouse.
---
“Echo can’t help me where I’m going”
---
I love that line
---
Hibana is the best
---
Makes me curious as to what they're doing. Maybe a future event next or something? Or the next season's op like wraith from apex?
---
I had to downvote for the memes
---
Honestly this gamemode is probably the last one that should stick around. It's just a 3v3.
---
Anyone have a glitch where all their weapon attachments are gone?
---
It’s not childish though, you don’t have to sweat the game 24/7 to have fun
---
I was dicking around with my friends, almost all of us do it. It’s not like I was TK’ing randoms.
---
Still not as annoying as seeing basically the same clip 10 times in a row 🤷‍♂️
---
Simply said it's when that 1 guy sends a lot of packages with a lot of devices to the server you're playing on so you're game will lag incredibly hard you can't even move
---
I’m pretty sure go4 is on all platforms lol no need to start another dick measuring contest between other neck beards (all the virgins “pc master race” )
---
Me
---
My stoned co-worker that I'm teaching on the job, but just keep telling him how the bosses are awful
---
Fair enough I did think about this after posting, but figured that if the existing inconsistency caused by debris and bodies is acceptable then this wouldn't be as drastic. 
---
Then again it would make callouts while spectating a little difficult. So I'm inclined to agree. Thanks you commenting.
---
Okay but is anyone having issues after entering a discovery match where all your attachments get removed from your guns and all skins for your guns and ops??!
---
Is this a PC problem ? Maybe I just havent noticed on console 🤷‍♂️
---
only pc i think, google said only pc too.
---
Outbreak was a bit of a special case as it was basically testing the waters for Quarantine, but yeah I'd love to play that, at least as a Quarantine demo
---
But it used to be on all platforms, what happened?
---
Console problem but it’s pretty rare unless you’re in the higher diamond ranks. Never experienced it myself.
---
No my friend you seem to be the stupid one in this scenario🗿
---
oh dude thats like so funny  hahahahaahaha
---
i dont get it
---
For right now it’d be mostly casual and then I’d hope to move into ranked
---
Just noticed right now as well. Sucks
---
Same thing except they just vote me out of the match instantly. I hate the community that plays this game 99% of the time
---
You sound like a 40 year old virgin, I bet you’re fun to be around.
---
Never seen this before, thank you so much
---
Twitch's hand...
---
So basically stickers?
---
Added
---
oh ok thx for tolerating my retardedness
---
They should just release a game modes every  week, like ones already released just to mix it up.. now and then release new ones
---
True, I've been trying to figure out what n.j.t means and I got nothing
---
Say my name.
---
"it's MY son's turn on the Xbox!"
---
If I presume you use a controller, the Go4 will be full of hyper-aggressive sweaty 3-speed using mouse and keyboard players who abuse the system by having an immediate handicap. 
---
If you use a mouse and keyboard, then you stand a chance. Not that anyone would take you seriously or that it is any mean feet of accomplishment as your playing with an immediate advantage unless against all the other cocks using them. 
---
Whichever one you fall into, good luck. Personally, I see no worth. No reward in playing it as nothing valuable comes from it, even if you win lol. If you wanna play it, feel free. If you lose, don’t beat yourself up though (unless you use M+K,  otherwise you should feel ashamed)
---
It’s high noon...
---
Teammate: heya mute could you do something for me?
---
Mute: drones?...
---
Teammate: well actually we need help killing the attack-
---
*mute has left the game*
---
Potential thief: Ever been robbed?
---
Banker: *proceeds to enthusiastically tell entire life story*
---
Time to start traveling with your console, just to be safe
---
So unbelievably frustrating. Sorry man
---
what the fuck, really?
---
*boah*
---
you spelled fuze weird
---
It's omay. Thanks for pointing out that I'm bad at highlighting things
---
I love the reflection 🤣🤣🤣
---
Capitao looks like he's straight out of Pineapple Express. I died laughing when I first  saw Rooks new helmet and armor and this is a perfect representation a
---
I'm on PS4
---
Its funny when you kill someone with his turret
