Hold up does that work?
---
---
---
No, but it will do 5 damage instead of 10 and you only get 5 but it recharges like lesions gu-mines. it would be awesome to collab. with Ubisoft
---
Definitely Mercy, only played once but that round man...
---
You always make some quality stuff my guy
---
Are you a roaming Chanka, spreading wisdom throughout the map, or are you an anchor, establishing you turrent shrine for all to gaze upon?
---
which is literally why rng is a bad system lmao
---
I've got loads of previous streams on there you can watch for the time being lol
---
Yeah. There was a specific reason why she has to do that and I don’t remember what it was
---
It’s what makes it juicy imo
---
People always ask, "what's in the canister?" But no one ever asks, "hows the canister?"
---
Same but Cav's shotgun is just nasty, and her SMG is horrible
---
Probably “too overpowered”. Even though once you use the thing it makes so much noise.
---
How can the undead have heartbeats ? Realism is out of the question
---
Show me where it says they’re undead?

You should post this in r/Art

I dont think so
---
just learn to tap fire it or fire in short bursts.
---

---
Que Benny hill theme
---
Not helpful when the damage is very low
---
On defense I’d say it’s a tossup between the 416-C or the ALDA.
---
The high fire rate with the 80 round magazine makes it very good. It's also on defense, so it's better as they come to you. The ARX has a decent fire rate and a small clip. It's good, but you reload too often.
---
I feel like she should be able to hook it to her a belt and pull herself up but it takes a couple seconds to detach, similarly to picking up a deployed gadget, that way you can still shoot and move a tad bit, but you can’t just immediately jump in and slaughter obj
---
Yeah. That makes it a little more reasonable, but maybe no recharge. The weapon is described as something like a projectile. Might be a misunderstanding though.
---
One shot melee don't exist, personally i find that stupid, and the extremely easy recoil management on some guns. Gun fight wise, recoil is the most unrealistic imo, and gun damage.
---
To a certain degree, but it shouldn't arbitrarily waste people's times in the scale of hundreds of hours depending on dupe rates.
---
I mean I guess smoke and frost aren’t but the rest a skeletons, a dead body and a zombie.... and who says they couldn’t have done any other operator or not even done pulse
---
Nah tht would be wack, punish players for stupid decisions. Natural selection.
---
yes it is an electrified projectile hence the recharge
---
did everyone get thanos'd or something? what is this?
---
It suits my playstyle fast peeks and angle holds, when I'm not being trash.
---
I was about to ask that. And I don't know. XD

---
Float like a butterfly and float like a butterfly
---
I think ALDA takes it on the hip fire, but the 416 is more accurate for me personally.
---
are you sure thats cosplay, looks more like character art
---
No you don't. The Skorpion used to have virtually no recoil. It was bad.
---

---
Where it's at now is good.
---
At least horizontal, vertical is easy
---
I winder what would happen if you forced a draw every round by using a grenade to kill the last defender and attacker at the same time?

It was on Villa when he said it, think the engagement he was on about was astronomy to bathroom/master walk in wardrobe.

I just bought a 21 inch monitor after playing on a 32 inch tv, and it’s made gaming in any game much easier for me as it’s a smaller screen so you can see the whole thing instead of having to look around.
---
[removed]
---
Psssttt you mean worse...How are they even Plat..
---
It does, unless you're using an iPhone 3S
---
And baiting your teammates
---
I stopped a queue for an unranked match so I could switch to ranked. But it didnt actually put me into an unranked match
---
Happy cake day !
---
That’s good you don’t let any of that get to you. Between you and me I would rather have a teammate who doesn’t talk but can carry their own weight and work well with the team then some blabber mouth who is all bark no bite, lol.
---
How did he get the elite? I don’t think it’s out yet
---
Okay then just make rank global but allow server switching
---
To my guess is this example :
---
Hacker hacks in a game . Then he changes his name later
---
I have the 3600 and 5700 XT, running on ultra 1080p, have not tried the ultra HD graphics pack- is it any good?
---
when you hasn't no operator yet this was happening cause you can't choose a operator
---
he's not a good op but not a bad one either just below average. also could of easily done the same if u were smoke or mute and 180 when the flash
---
I feel you bro, last week I played the #57 ranked champion Japanese player in a silver match... they need to make ranks global
---
My suggestion to you is to queue central US instead (CUS). Matchmaking will take longer but you’ll run into fewer apac players.
---
Ash Sledge...What is this low gold? Zofia
---
Orang3CoolAdKid if you wanna add me
---
That's pretty dumb, if Ubi was smart they'd use profile ID's like steam
---
You are a bit late no?
---
The og was funnier but this one somehow makes more sense
---
Some people were getting a reconnect message after stopping the queue, did you not get one of those? 
---
Overall, this is something that we are looking into!
---
Glad I just bought the shit. I don't like the game mode at all, each to their own.

Yeah he didn't finish middle school...

I just reallised it now
---
He's a hacker.
---
There was a TSM match on bank, back when they were still learning the ropes.
---
The did the EXACT same thing. 3 people stormed blue entrance and fed the...if I'm not wrong, a smoke. People were so confused as to why they messed up so bad.
---
Laxing in another game did a 3k with warden against SQ at the same stairs.
---
Imagine: you're fuze. Its 5 am and you're soundly asleep and awake to the sound of an impact nade.
---
This is next level
---
Sledges should’ve been for the L85A2 (or whatever the specific name is) and thatchers should’ve been for the AR33
---
Cute
---
This is exactly why i want to get a pc
---
How can someone give themself an elected skin that’s not available? Is it already in the games code?
---
Both are hella op ops. Like..... 2 times of lion plus a nomad levels op. The speed boost ability was declared by Ubi to be broken because that's what Finka was supposed to be. They scrapped speed boost because in a game like siege that's  heavily dependent on speed, you'll get screwed with a boost.
---
Trust me we can see that
---
So why the 31 day waiting period?
---
Should be easy for any platform then.
---
I just want penetration head shots out of the game lol that shit is such bullshit.
---
Anchoring and holding the most important stair case in the map
---
No problem. So what do you think?
---
That is no problem, I really dont know what youre trying to say, its not his fault his mmr is low just because he doesnt like playing ranked. Your arguement is invalid.
---
Methinks I may have to get both if they come out
---
Old
---
How do you camp in this game it's not COD its called anchoring
---
That helmet is stronger than lion during Chimera
---
Idk man they were guy bad, none of them prefired
---
The first thing you said is "we only play ranked". Not only that, his mmr being low is directly because of his decision to play on a separate account to preserve his original accounts mmr. Its smurfing no matter how you look at it unless you blatantly lied to prove a point.
---
How the hell do you call someone a camper in siege?
---
Hey bro your getting a lot of hate, so just wanna let you know any Op is good including Warden and great Ace
---
That flick at the end was so cool though
---
Bad b8, m8.
---
GG
---
So you only play ranked and you tk each other? Yeah alright have fun ruining the game for everyone else you inconsiderate imp.
---
It would look ridiculous but I’m 100% for it lol
---
They should also show skins and charms in the operator choice screen (the preview screen that shows the teams op choice before you load in)
---
LtKazzie if I remember, looks like he deleted his comment.
---
Yay!
---
bait?
---
if i get banned from the sub maybe glaz will get banned from plane????
---
haha jkjk ...unless?
---
Chill out it’s casual plane, take it easy, and relax and have some fun and enjoy yourself.
---
That's what I'm saying, but he also seems to be an impulse liar so idk.
---
I agree
---
Yeah I saw it,
---
He pretty much doesn't have any stats to ruin in ranked. They have like 6 games in ranked, his second account does have super suspect stats which is probably why people are tk'n. Cooler heads would at least watch him first, but many people will just take it upon themselves. You can always just ruin the alts stats so it doesn't happen, but I think that your friend uses it as a source of pride (11 ranked on alt). Sample size is too small to draw any conclusions from this data.
---
Yup.
---
Fine, I made a maska 1 sch helmet
---
Would figure, not my friend, I'm not op.
---
how can i enjoy plane when a dude is literally putting a bullet in my head? nvm
---
I’m with you brother
---
You could have easily just looked away from that flash and killed them...
---
Throwback to my team throwing a 3v1 and I lost the 1v1 and then I got tkd the next round. I messaged the guy who killed me and he said "chill out, it's casual, just having fun" like yeah, being toxic and ruining others experiences because you suck is real fun. He was a silver claiming that his main on xbox is Plat.
---
He posted his account in another section. His friends two combined accounts have a total of 17 ranked games. I wonder how many times his friend gets banned and how many accounts he needs to cover for "always playing ranked."
---
1) I said that on the low level account we only played ranked, This decision was mine as I didnt want to play casual. 2) He didnt try to preserve mmr on any account, he doesnt play ranked on his main account as he doesnt want his kd to change, so no matter what account he played on his mmr would be low.
---
Don't do that, don't give me hope..
---
If they’re aiming for 100 operators, I would imagine a lot of them will be situational.
---
You're already a 3-speed, but you'd probably use it for getting to defuser, getting hostage, flanks, roaming, you could escape if you're getting pushed by Blitz or Monty, and they will have impacts so you can get the jump on attackers. Admittedly, yes, you will most likely die if an enemy sees you and you can't shoot, but the option to cancel the effect will be a thing. If it still doesn't work for you, it's ok. Personally I feel it would be of good use, but that's mine and your opinion.
---
Yeah, had it written for him but he deleted it. So I decided just to paste it to you.
---
You stated you "only play ranked" that implies you guys currently and previously play ranked specifically. Watch your wording next time.
---
see i used a real C4 but i got arrested for some reason, anyways awesome costume !
---
Yeah pretty much to be honest.
---
Rainbow six siege whack a mole(or in this case shoot a mole)
---
They are so strong they suck the sound out of your ears
---
 can you provide a download link to the wallpaper (:
---
Hmmm, game's language is set to Polish and you can't hear a single "kurwa" on voice chat, somethin' ain't right xD
---
That's how you use warden. You set yourself up either on site or a choke point near site and watch them struggle to move you.
---

---
Well I'll be, that changes things big time
---
I wouldn’t say Warden is good. I’d say you are. Good job :)
---
That team could’ve had you had they played it differently, but you stayed on top of it and outdid them. Nicely done.
---
HOLY SHI- good job!!  :D
---
If you listen close enough you can hear the enemies scream to this day
---
What the actual heck.
---
Steel-toed as well lol
---
Had a jager playing behind the server with the hatch both reinforced and kaided
---
wait that’s illegal
---
Yeah it’s usually the attackers
---
This is the first time I’ve seen Warden be useful
---
Whack a mute
---
Mute good
---
It makes sense. Pulse has seen Smonk without his mask before, and upon seeing him like this he can't tell the difference (cuz he so dang ugly).

That's a fair point, it only takes that one tap.

Yeah, but I'm saying those are the people that you're most likely to find on cams, and yes dokki Calls work too
---
yes
---
do you like brownies
---
Lol go look at my profile
---
...because random, no skill headshots through walls are bad in a competitive shooter?
---
Nothing else needs to be changed, just the headshot multiplier removed.
---
I’ll run mag 12 on warden all day but not dok
---
oh lol
---
Well I am sorry for you and your siege experience
---
Lmao why'd you ask?
---
your name is brownie
---
As am I...
---
how can u not speak, just open your mouth and talk LOL
---
okay in all seriousness; I take it you like every other player gets fed up with their teammates once in a while. Is text chat enough to take out your frustration or do you wish you could just shout at them in voice chat?
---
Imo warden is the worst op in the game for a lot of reasons, but I get kills all the time with him. You can avoid flashbangs by turning around, and if you want to see through smoke just play Maestro. Tachanka has good guns and can work with other ops, like mira, and I pick him on some sites for actual strats. Clash is bad in solo queue, but amazing in a coordinated team. Warden? His guns are trash or better used on other ops, his gadget is extremely situational, he has no utility, and there are better ops to pick. 
---
And despite all this, he’s one of my favorite ops in the game. I already have around 30 hours on him. I just really want him to be good.
---
Nice
---
flair checks out
---
This is literally old glaz with an AR. How stupid can you get?
---
Back when I was choosing my gamer tag I was eating some brownies, but it was taken so I had to spell it browny instead lol, but yes I do love brownies🙌
---
That Pulse just made me sad.
---
He has shit guns. The M590 is a damn good shotty, but it’s better used on other ops. The MPX is only good for headshots, the SMG-12 is super difficult to use, and the P10 is a mediocre pistol.
---
Ok bro it was a concept, you can chi out now
---
There is a special tier bellow F for him.
---
Idk what the fuck a good imaging is, but I'll tell you that any in-ear anything you get for R6 is gonna be shit. Over-ear is more immersive and ALWAYS have better sound
---
Heyyyyy chill, you were the dude that thanked me for feedback! I'm just giving feedback.

Cortana...
---
That’s my entire point. I video game I’m playing to win,in the game mode where you have to win as much as possible, also one of the most comp focused games out there.
---
Why are frost and kapkan in c tier have you seen their win delta recently
---
This, this is why I play Rainbow Six
---
[here](https://youtu.be/nVmXsBNfwHY)
---
Valkorwave?
---
I dig that
---
I suggest the following:
---
Reduce 5 to 3.5 secs but make it 3 uses instead of 2
---
Smoke. I loved using smoke with impact grenades and making holes, but now they took them away, and readjusting to using the barricade shield they gave him. 
---
Otherwise I use pulse, tachanka, kapkan., And rook. 
---
I'm more of anchor, with a little roaming.
---
Perfect , sums it up
---
You're joking.
---
&gt;You have to know where they are, be able to tell what height their head is, and then manage to hit them.
---
This never happens. You're more likely to get a random headshot than a skillful headshot in this fashion. In high level play a player will immediately relocate if droned out, and rarely will they just be sitting still behind a wall.
---
Which leads to my point that you missed. A *skillful wallbang*, ie one that happens because the person shooting happened to drone the player being shot, won't be impacted by the removal of the headshot multiplier, seeing as TTK is still crazy fast through walls. However, the *unskilled wallbang* headshot, ie. one that occurs on a running player through a wall or just through sheer luck, will be removed, eliminating RNG.
---
I don't see why you have to overcomplicate this shit. It's simple.
---
Yeah, but you can’t really get to shield if she shocks you the entire time.
---
It wasn't even close to within 3m of him though. You could have looked away and back by the time the first guy peeked.
---
I think it would be easier just to drone
---
Hahahah
---
Cheeks clap heard round the world.
---
inventory editing
---
More of a reason for siege to implement a ping system like apex
---
I got his Succ headgear too
---
how much did it cost
---
Mozzie is a very good operator but lesions easier to use and has a much better ability as for Goyo his guns are ok but they're hard to use and his ability really isn't that useful
---
To be fair chanka's win rate is slighty skewed because people literally only pick him when they are memeing on a team that is bad.
---
Friend of mine had this too. We found that the issue was his CPU. Siege is very heavy on it and discord too. I think you'd need to check if this applies in your case. If so, no other way around it then upgrading the CPU.
---
The difference is that people actually like the real Skeleton Jager (sorry op, had to do it).
---
Literally just walk up to her and hit her shield
---
&gt; There’s definitely a middle ground you’re ignoring,
---
Like what? Glaz was OP, and now useless. Ying was OP, and now neither particularly useless or useful. Warden is downright dogshit.
---
As for the rest of what you wrote, you literally just describe smokes. This gadget is a smoke grenade. It's stupid.
---
No they are idiots, maybe not generally but in that situation. If a pro rushes a shotgun at point blan range yes they acted like an idiot and made a stupid play.
---
I once accidentally stole someone's kill (I couldn't see him, my vision sucks) and he said "don't steal my kill" after I killed the guy, then he tkd me and said he'd get the kill one way or another. Did not know you were all so salty jeez
---
did that once too, it did the gun loading animation twice
---
Well what are your options? Which are you most interested in? 1k renown is only like 2-3 games or doing situations/tutorials so it’s easy to get enough.
---
The system could not detect that.

Hello iibigbrain, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dqgjst/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Umm... Pirate Bay....

Tbh im looking for dlc ops right now i have both valk and blackeard (just bought valk) and now i need a new attacker
---
Hi hungry I'm dad
---
Because you need to buy a new tv first
---
Que?
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
But what if the enemies knew what they where doing and threw more flashes or popped flashed if it wasent for his gadget I'd get shot in the back
---
He looks like a skeleton from Coco.
---
But we want to see how it happened too
---
He's situational and only works on specific strats and sites
---
I think it's  2.4GHz   
---
You know what I should do?
---
Yes my family uses same router, but after midnight when they are sleeping, the ping stays high too, it has nothing to do with how many are using same router.
---
coz you didnt shoot the enemy, you must have shot ur team
---
Knowing siege that wouldn't go well
---
What rank is this xd? Enemies just come trough the door after watching their team mates get their heads blown of by a shotgun.
---
Wdym
---
Colorado
---
Situational and he only works on very specific sites aka chalet garage
---
Plat
---
Nevermind then m8
---
I like the one where he is blindfolded
---
When he walked through the metal detector I cringed.
---
Also WTF. The other team is deaf? Having said that, took balls to go for the knife kills on IQ and Monty.
---
Probably yes
---
&gt; by any OP.
---
By any Over Powered? Or by an Original Poster?
---
Imagine you fail a clutch and all you see is passive agressive good jobs and then you get voted out of the match
---
That what two years ago, not new
---
Season pass
---
I dont know if you are trolling or really that Rtarded
---
r/angrycatpics

Yeah OP, that's kinda messed up &amp; not funny. 
---
When I played Halo 3 as a kid, the last thing I'd want is someone that's old enough to know better, to be harassing me.
---
Same with a fuse attachment too
---
Hahahahah I see your point
---
Looking at the points it was a pretty hard game
---
Get STYLED on
---
How do I get my main thing
---
There’s roaming and lurking but that’s about it
---
Mb try verifying game files
---
Do what? Like how?
---
I usually send a message (Xbox) if they pull off a clutch, nice shot, or we're a great teammate in general.
---
Don't think a button is necessary and could be abused for toxic behavior.
---
Example: Smite has a "You Rock" voice line, but people spam it as a way to be passive aggressive towards teammates.
---
Clash - protect our tovarich
---
Alibi - flank our enemy
---
Was expecting the enemy to push the second the flash was thrown or even before I saw people peek while the flash was being thrown so warden was the best option for me thought process
---
Nice play, those enemies were really bad
---
They could easily have just thrown a grenade or something
---
Looks like he shoved the Electroclaw up his ass and opened it
---
Can u give us the full "where is my ACOG" expression?

Nice r6 badge things , I'm new to reddit what's up with those?
---
Yes casual has a hidden MMR in it
---
A computer can't make random numbers so ubisoft just need to test multiply xim adapters to find the acceleration percentages and update the game to catch the number
---
Kill stealing isn’t a thing.
---
I wouldn't mind if they got rid of it tbh cause its casual, might be more enjoyable
---
Maybe buff his glasses duration to 15 seconds to match Vigil's cloak gadget duration . And make it so you can activate glasses during the recharge process just like Caveira , Vigil and Nokk
---
I queue with a lot of shit heads tbh but I’m still winning about 64% out my games it’s just a grind
---
I dont wanna get banned and have to suck the mods dicks to get in
---
Being reasonable never works. I tried being civil and failed. Better to be a doormat, I suppose.
---
How can you make that creepy ass Ela costume so cute
---
You put up a post asking for advice pretending it was for your friend. Then you got sarky to almost every person that commented.
---
 If you’d just said ‘hey guys I’m stuck in bronze and I feel like I’m good enough to play in a higher rank. Anyone want to squad up and climb up together’. You’d have got a much better response.  But instead you started the post with something like ‘this isn’t about me SO GET THAT IDEA RIGHT OUT YOUR HEAD NOW!’

That’ll rub people up the wrong way right from the start. If you come back in a week and ask the same thing but be a bit more humble, don’t lie and ask for advice on how to improve you’ll get a much better response. In fact I’ll save you the trouble and give you the only relevant answer. Find a some people to squad up with.
---
No confirmed but its from an apparent reliable source. I am trying to say that its a bit stupid even if it isn’t confirmed but its a very popular leak that many believe
---
They can make it so single fire mode has the same recoil pattern as full auto. How many times do you actually use single fire?
---
I mean, it's a classical painting, so i don't think you actually need to censor it

same, disconnected and couldn't even reconnect to the servers. I think they're fked
---
I know the source is reliable but it only gave us one weapon, maybe she has a new secondary that is basically a primary so you can still push the obj with a normal weapon
---
you demonstrated that the pump is op, not warden
---
Damn it must be Halloween still
---
Yeah probably
---
Upon further inspection I realized you are not one of the people who flamed me. My apologies.
---
Use the dmr
---
Np buddy

Especially when you grind for weeks upon weeks with no progress?

Sorry to hear that tho im glad its not just me.

Wow this was probably the nicest thing I read here on this sub if not on all of reddit, this is the reason that I love this community, because of people like you, people that I never knew about, but hearing their stories just makes me happy, as much as there are a lot of things that might need fixing in the game but stories like these are what keeps me playing the game and ofc the fact that I actually also enjoy the game, I'm happy you shared your story, and happy to here that you're enjoying the game this much
---
This is awesome! Glad you're enjoying!!
---
It's a new op that wasn't originally in the game
---
Adidas tracksuit and sombrero dont ho together my guy.
---
So if I'm reading this right, if I get the ultimate edition, any future ops that are released il unlock right away?
---
Then why’d you post about this?, you’re acting like they shouldnt
---
You are a fucking idiot
---
I say just go with getting all first year ops first, imo they are all pretty fun and good to play
---
Just take it away if he’s not being grateful of free shit.
---
I hate those people who vote to kick the last guy because “they’re bad” when the person who started he kick was bottom of the leaderboard and hadn’t done anything useful all game...
---
Yes. The whole point of a minimalist wallpaper is that there isnt a lot of detail, and that it's very simple.

Fun story: We have a player of ours that is insanely good. He's pretty young, maybe his family is in a tough spot financially, but he always excels in Siege. Aim is on point, call outs are always top of the line, and does everything he can to help out the team. We recently played with him (in a five-stack with our friends and all) in a community tourney. These we're not easy teams to beat at all. He managed to be one of our major fraggers for all the games we played and we placed 2nd in that tourney. He accomplished all that without a goddamn microphone. He solely communicated with us through text chat and we made it work. If you have a team that is willing to accommodate and someone who is willing to work, then anything is possible. In scrims, in competitive, there's not a single doubt in my mind that the kid is damn good at this game and has a strong desire to help out his team and win... All without a mic, haha!
---
I hope your post inspires other people who cannot speak/ do not have the ability to do so to play the game/ come back. Thanks for the post! GGs!!!
---
Yes daddy
---
Bigil
---
because it lacks details such as deteriorating skin and flesh.
---
therefore it doesn't look as creepy and disgusting.
---
Oh I didn't realize there was a law. I herby place you as the winner if this respectful debate.
---
The madman spawned with his revolver and started breaking ankles for a solid 15 seconds before he let loose on attackers, he gave them warning
---
Acting like you couldn’t have just shot him
---
I dunno how I can lovew myself more since I bought it myself
---
Thicker than hell ha
---
I didn’t quite catch what you said
---
You mean blind...The Cloud 9 one was so bright on release dont know if they fixed it but i refrain from using it.
---
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/vfoztlTIyGE) by Rouge-9 on perspective. Ubisoft can’t alleviate the issue, but your positioning can prevent things like this happening.
---
Notice how close you are to the wall compared to the Nomad. That’s why you can’t see her.
---
Agreed
---
gitara siema
---
You could knife it
---
My Lord....*you* bought it, bodhi?
---
Bitch you Look 12 don't Play Rainbow
---
Agreed.
---
So being far away from the wall will help?
---
He is still living in year 1.
---
:(
---
I wouldn't say i don't like it is just something that im not used to. It probably was a mistake just making this post tbh.
---
I could’ve been playing a different game too, what does that change?
---
How about, and stay with me here... &gt;!we get rid of all 3!&lt;
---
What did that have to do with Warden though? The one flashbang that you could have turned away from like 10 times or a shotgun, which many operators possess aswell?
---
Acog vs 1x sight. All about perspective
---
At close range he's semi-decent, but at long range it is impossible to chain shots with the recoil. Even after the buff he still has the worst time to kill on a dmr if I remember correctly.
---
Bush did 911
---
I'm quite happy with what I got, in free pack I got doc's uniform and on the 2nd pack I got ela's weapon skin
---
With new operation, it's gonna be Dokkaebi.
---
You realize those secondaries are basically the same gun but the keratos has no recoil or damage dropoff, right?
---
It's not, it's just a police officer in that particular scene
---
would you rather play old hereford or tower/favela though?
---
Add me
---
There gonna be beating more than just ELA tonight.
---
None of them would be ideal. Bad maps should be gone entirely, they’re not even fun in casual
---
I personally think siege needs to hire you. So well thought out. I never play Chanka cause I don’t like being in one place, but glaz scope would be wild on the turret and made we wish that was a thing. Sit in the corner and have a homie play clash and just chase people around and ping them and wallbang em with chanka. Haahahaha
---
Honestly all he needs is be able to place the turret closer to his deployable shield
---
yet they've still made a comeback :(. New playlist: Retired Ass Maps
---
Hibana, she THICC quicc and she super versatile
---
I like jackal because I don't have to drone and I feed kills, if your looking for an attacker that's pretty good everyone plays zofia.
---
Wardens real ability is looking fresh in every situation.
---
How are you a ESL player when you haven't played for basically 3 seasons???
---
That's happened to me, I literally got one tapped with an mps through my shield
---
its existed for a good 3 years
---
I added you :D
---
Its was a headshot ofcourse it's a 1 hit
---
Hibana
---
My first guess was Widowmaker
---
op is short for operator you normie 🤣🤣🤣
---
I think what he’s trying to say is because you’re closer to cover the wall will be obstructing more of your view than the shooter making it look like he shouldn’t be able to see you when in reality some of your model is exposed due to the more recent camera changes.
---
Shouldn't smoke be immune to the gas ?
---
Let Tachanka carry it, with the shield but he can't ads so it only blocks chest shots. Its a 2 shot weapon iirc and it'd slow him down more than he already is. Turn him into a hard hitting but really slow moving target.
---
I'm actually a Lion main but people hate him so I switched flairs
---
100%
---
Well at least you hit the drone with the pistol
---
I hate you, I envy you. I BOUGHT LIKE 10 PACKS AND NOTHING FOR ELA
---
That's why I had lootbox
---
I got a sick nasty 4k on consulate on my first round
---
imagine how quick you'd die and how much sound whoring you would do just by doing that no way
---
Yeah but Ela needs spare skin to fix her face.
---
i got kicked for not clutching a 1v4 and i also had the most kills on the team lmao
---
Then you hear the pulse
---
It honestly depends on your playstyle
---
If you don’t know what your playstyle is called just tell me who you main currently
---
[deleted]
---
I honestly can't wait till they remove this map from ranked pool along with skyscraper.
---
I agree, i legit just made a post saying I pretty much abandoned R6 due to relentless griefing and toxic 12yr olds team killing. It's beyond a joke now.
---
You can try to get better router which works on 5GHz. I recommend tplink archer c6 v2. Its very good, cheap and wireless speeds are amazing.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Happened two or three times in PL but I guess they have a thing or two to learn from you!
---
Yeah, I mentioned it. Víkingasveitin
---
Since it's AI it's focusing on the one the player is controlling and since he keeps swapping between the two it keeps changing it's focus not having enough time to shoot the drones (my guess at least)
---
My favorite is giving good call outs and info; and sometimes being told to STFU. Yay for random teammates.
---
Except all the times it does happen.
---
Thank ya bro!
---
Lol, no doubt
---
He didn't get the memo

Mav
---
Show me a clip of someone so bad they miss a dude and kill a teamm8 then miss and get hammered on pc ranked, go ahead I’ll wait
---
Wow body clipping was basically entirely fixed. I haven't seen it in forever, did you report this to the correct places?
---
Congrats mate
---
Get an Zofia, then go to a reinforced wall.
---
Burn the top and bottom of the reinforcement and if you did it good the reinforcement is no more and zofia can open the soft wall for you.
---
No such thing against spawn peekers. They deserve any shit coming their way.
---
I would recommend moving down just a bit, because your aim seems to be all over the place. Whatever you’re comfortable with works though.
---
It was a 2v5 the entire match so we just surrendered :(
---
Go and watch any r6 YouTuber, then attempt to remove your head from your arse.
---
It gives you are free pack that would have otherwise costed 12500 renown... playing Doktors curse until you get 20 attacker kills is considerable faster than playing regular MP until you earn 12500 renown.
---
I usually play until the end if I'm not kicked, join a different match with different players and after 1 round the toxicity begins. I'm not even joking it's 1/4 games at least. It's just so strange that this game attracts such rubbish. 
---
It's almost like trolling in anon threads, people displaying their worst traits and behaviors behind a keyboard. How is it still funny, some of these people are pretty high level too, you'd think the novelty had worn off by now?
---
Even solo qing in casual I get maybe 1 in every 20 games. Most of it can be solved with either playing along with their antics or just simply leaving and re-queing I've noticed. If you're getting it a lot in ranked, good luck though.
---
Link it, oh wait you won’t? Yeah bc there isn’t a clip like this on pc. Cunt
---
Wait what  😂 I think I was tired and replied on accident. I’m talking to you lol

Tbf the other 19 answers are also viewable on that public forum. People could just stop offering literally the same answer.
---
I love defending basement in the old Hereford
---
The hit box is simply larger than the camera angle, while this isn’t intended it is necessary since having a FOV that large would be disorientating.  Not To mention even on lan there is a slight delay in on side vrs the other and what matters in siege is the servers view
---
I'd rather have this map then house or favella
---
It’s a mix of positioning and where the camera is
---
I would just love to know if any of the reported behaviors are actually actioned and what it takes to get a player banned. The frequency in which I am in contact with shitty players varies each day. Late at night or early mornings it's legit 1/4 for casual. I'm too trash for ranked
---
Skyscraper is a map for spawn peekers
---
Exactly. This wasn’t a warden ace. This was incredibly retarded enemies lining up to get clapped by an operator that happened to be warden
---
This is completely false. Microsoft doesn’t sell adapters. They give developers a switch that allows for native Keyboard and Mouse support.
---
The only adapters Microsoft sell are wireless adapters for the use of controllers on PC.
---
Very play style dependent
---
But i can recommend 
---
Hibanna on attack 
---
And
---
Mira on defence
---
Tell that to Jackals ability xD
---
Yea it’s just t hunt
---
Wasn't this way back though? How recent was this blog?
---
I think this is a good concept. Very creative !
---
no the thing is that its stupid that there still are ranked matches that start at 2v5,they have to do something,it should be like bans,the more you leave ranked matches the bigger the punishment like if someone leaves 10 ranked matches he should have a week ban tbh
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking
---
But ubisoft bans you for using it if detected since they said it’s considered cheating
---
... ok
---
What I said. I don't care about the gadget. It's basically an excuse to get a Glock into the game and the 416 on the Attackers side.
---
She’s looking at like your shoulder, your eyes aren’t around the corner yet but ik this is annoying happens to me all the time
---
Are you positive they tried to spawn peek not that they just walked passed the window
---
Will never be a thing imo there would be so fucking many afk bots in every game mode to farm alpha packs and renown to make money out of
---
That’s not my shoulder that’s my head cuz i got one tapped/died by her first bullet
---
Why won’t people like you not understand that we are not getting a fucking glock?
---
they do, do that
---
Alongside playing terrorist hunt, try to find your playstyle.
---
Aggressive run &amp; gun:  
---
\- Ops (ash, iq, bandit, etc)  
---
\- 1x scopes  
---
\- High sensitivity for quick reaction &amp; snaps.  
---
Anchored  
---
\- Ops (Thermite, Doc, Rook, etc)  
---
\- Acogs  
---
\- lower sensitivity for accuracy.
---
Definitely in the last 6 months but I can not recall the exact time.
---
2-3 months ago a Thermite was spraying at the barricade[not yet destroyed], I was behind a wooden wall in that same angle. He killed me in 1 shot by a headshot
---
Adapters aren’t licensed by Microsoft. He’s lying. M&amp;K support won’t come to console for Siege unless Ubisoft plans to make changes. If you desperately want to use a mouse and keyboard, I advise saving for a PC.
---
How do people still not understand that you have arms and body in this game
---
Jakal’s Eyenox is more realistic the wall don’t done do wall anymore.
---
I got head shotted mate
---
Like I already said buddy, I could go through YouTube and reddit and find a similar clip and link it to you. But guess what I’m not gonna do that. You know why? It’s because talking to you is a waste of time. I have know idea if you are knew to siege or just never understood the kind of game it is but in siege, the fact that all situations are different, means that this clip that you want so bad  has happened before and probably countless times at that. And have you even played pc? Because if you have then you should understand that people fool around like this all the time same thing for all other platforms in casual and ranked
---
If you’re talking about the xim, it’s not made by Microsoft, technically the only official Keyboard and mouse exists on the PS4, the Tac Pro, which is licensed by Sony, but manufactured by Hori. Regardless of the adapter used tho, nobody is getting banned for using it.
---
Favela should be at the bottom
---
Jackal is the best to buy because you’ll never get to use him
---
I'm sorry but I cannot make horizontal as of now I'm on phone I tried and I'll keep trying I'll let you know
---
You were really bored, I see lol
---
What did you use for the flash?
---
The precise hit of dopamine when a teammate says 'nice' or 'good job' after a kill
---
You monster...
---
Oh I need to try this.
---
This seems to be happening more and more. Same with the barricades and walls being broken for one person but not the other.

Not even reading it LMAO I made you write an essay, easy W

If somebody can get so worked up, I'm Keen on seeing what your replies were.

My friend keeps praying that with the battlepass comes gadget skins for every Op 🤷 would be sick but also alot to add

It's not malicious who cares

I'll try this
---
Are you on PC or console? If you are on PC you can turn bloom off in the graphics settings and it won't glow.
---
Usually I won't recommend GPU Tweak because it's not as good as Afterburner, did you apply the overclock before the wiping and after the wiping?
---
Also is G-Sync enabled?
---
there is a vid from peaceekeeper u can see the eyes but the eyes didnt see u
---
Anything is better than what new hereford is.

you are 1 Month 25 Days 8 Hours 7 Minutes 33 Seconds late for that

Because they wanna earn money and otherwise they dont have enough money to keep the servers up.

Hello LegoLivesMatter! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!

U probably right

You're Sonys bitch, that's why.
---
I used to use the gaming setting I've started using the overclock after the wipe when I saw the performance diminish  and neither g sync nor v sync is enabled
---
You think that spotting a single Footprint and knowing precisly on which millimeter the enemy is is more realistic than freezing a wall? K
---
Interesting to see that the mp7 is a second. How would that affect bandit then?
---
That map is all around depressing, agreed!

Hello Astridsshot, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dqn60u/gotta_rush_some_fortnite_kids/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

It says that everything is up to date
---
Buck or Capitão because they have a lot of utility.
---
Bruh at this fucking prostitute?
---
Gridlock doesn't need that nerf
---
It’s between buck and Blackbeard
---
it's not the mp7 it's an mp9, better version of clash's
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself.
---
Freeze a fucking metal wall and break it for me then. And besides jackal’s Eyenox most likely works off of disruption of dust particles that it can detect and pinpoint.
---
I did to smh
---
Yeah, but honestly, a revolver suppressor would be dope

I realy like this one, always said glaz should have a Bolt action and not a dmr
---
Ah well im on both but thanks for this tip ill certainly try it.
---
Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, try turning the settings with the in-game presets and compare to other benchmark scores online, if it is performing as expected it's probably the game or setting you've set isn't the one you choose beforehand.
---
Well you are damn simple but cant comprehend the amount of stupid shit you say.

Cool beans, nice flex on the rank? I’m plat aswell, not that hard to get. If you really think dink’s adds nothing to team composition, then you really need to watch more pro league.
---
It has always started at 1.5
---
You only get 1.5 if you got your last pack from the event playlist
---
No and if you use a 3rd party adapter you get banned
---
In that case, I'd suggest rebuilding your database. If you are still missing them, [contact Ubisoft Support.](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New)
---
Yes.
---
No matter how many times I play it, I can never learn the layout

oregon and border are the most balanced maps in the game...
---
Oh dear, could you submit a report for this [through R6Fix?](https://r6fix.ubi.com/)
---
PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR
---
[Finally someone who understands me](https://i.imgur.com/HxEeNl6.png)

No problem. It took me a while to learn this game, and I still have a lot to learn. I’d say I’m about average but I do get pretty good games more and more often. It just takes time is all. Good luck to you sir. My in game name is TheRedMartian99 if you ever run into me
---
Nvm i fixed it i think, i Had a wrong Profile in Nvidia panel

Ah ok, thanks
---
Yes, but i think i fixed it, Had a wrong Profil selected in the Nvidia panel
---
✨D e b r i s ✨
---
It's more like the operation health of terrorist groups
---
This is the shit I hate about siege.  Nothing feels right as far as peaking angles.  This really needs to be fixed more so that the game doesn’t feel broken in this way. 
---
That and servers on PC are dying constantly.
---
Same here , for like 3 months , i havent been able to solve this. I ' ve got brand new notebook but still....
---
For this issue, could you please contribute to [this R6Fix report](https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/LIVE-11224-Black_mirror_bug/)? This issue only seems to happen in moments of extreme lag.
---
God forbid we have one with varied discussion, right?
---
wrong sub buckaroo
---
Really, it depends on what you want. I'd look up what the monitor specs mean, but here's what you need to know rn:
---
A 60hz monitor shows a maximum of 60 fps. If you get more than that, I'd find one that's 144hz.
---
A 1440p monitor looks much better and is more detailed than a 1080p monitor, but it's harder on your computer and will lower your fps.
---
Monitor size is measured diagonally, mine is 27" but I'd find a size comfortable for you.
---
Response times are how fast your monitor can change colors. Basically the faster the better, mine is 1ms but 4ms is acceptable.
---
Finally, I'd look at reviews and make sure a monitor has good enough colors that it's bearable to look at.
---
Yeah but... they're still obtainable through gameplay, which is what you're arguing in your post.
---
Thanks son
---
Edit: Clearly I don’t know how to use reddit
---
I hate the new one , old one was sooo much better
---
not bad
---
He got silent. Poor thing.
---
He’s distracting us from what matters, AREA 51!!! I want some alien booty to clap 😂
---
Nagyon menő lett! Kicsit op szerintem az mp9 secondarynak, de amúgy nagyon jó ötlet!
---
(For ya'll Americans, I said its really cool, but mp9 is a bit op... )
---
I like your attitude
---
Old Hereford was at least fun to do dumb shit on. New Hereford is just fugly imo
---
That's basically theft, they didn't pay for it. That's the only way the game makes money
---
Talk shit get hit 🤷‍♂️🤣
---
It’s not Australia that gridlock and mozie had behind them, it was the dunes leading up to Area 51!! Ubisoft duped us all!! Lmfao I’m stupid
---
So let's just add more boring repetitive and uncreative operators
---
How's the loadout OP tho?
---
Also mute would be able to make the sonar bullet useless
---
And she only has one mag of armor piercing rounds, maybe I could make the mag 5 bullets only to make it more balanced
---
Because the wall has to be breached first or stuff idk. It's  a first and simple idea that I wanted to share
---
It's not.  It's client-side debris.  The server thinks the wall is still solid (it usually happens because of lag) and doesn't allow you to go through.  If it was the anti-cheat, the cheaters that used the rooter code from Outbreak would never have been able to vault over something and teleport halfway across the world through multiple walls.
---
You mistaken a fan concept, sadly there isn't sewdish ops confirmed officially yet.

Or just use the search bar ffs. I'm sorry.
---
Seems like a fair balance, but I'd say that you could allow the one-shot headshot by making it a one-shot DBNO unless they've already been downed before. Assuming the rounds pierce reinforcements but not impenetrable obstacles otherwise, and the sonar pings warn defenders with an audible queue that they're being spotted, it's pretty fair.

Buck with camrs an absolute godly weapon
---
I don't go on this sub much, sorry.
---
My demands are simple, I'm creating a second prohibition unless I get my ACOG back so I can spawn kill half the enemy team and then be on the other side of the map immediatly after.
---
Buck with camrs, a godly weapon
---
Australian - A Straw Alien. Hm no wonder my milkshake is empty before I drink it.
---
 I doubt that throwing something heavy could be stopped by a stripe of duct tape :D
---
Your nuts bro keep it up!
---
zzz

I like the variety to play how you want to play even if it's not meta. A bolt action would be so satisfying
---
No like, if it was one frame before he died if the frames were faster u coulda seem the nomad
---
Well, almost all the memes are posted here are removed after half an hour, sooo i think the wouldnt let it be, but hey, maybe even they dont remove it
---
Why is this still being debated? This is how it's supposed to work.
---
I mean that is harder to do than just 1 tapping someone
---
Thanks uwu
---
That’s a great ace, but you could of been vigil, just avoided the flash, and gotten the same kill. I like his design, but warden’s ability is useful 10 seconds out of every 1 round, rarely ever more useful than any other 2 speed.
---
Favela should be in Hereford Base
---
Uhh no?
---
How the fuck
---
Even if that's the case Nomad saw them way before they would of saw her.
---
No, with maestro being such a crutch pick for certain players, nokk completely obliterates them. Nokk and Warden are very situational but if you are aware and can read the enemy to an extent they may as well be THE best ops.
---
u/askingsomquestions vibe check
---
Maverick on club house &amp; Blackbeard on Skyscraper, Consulate, and Coastline. You’ll thank me later lol, I seen pro’s ban these ops on those maps for a good reason.
---
If warden’s buff was team wide (when he activates it, the whole team is immune), or could somehow ping the enemy flashing him, he’d be at least equal in use.
---
Charge your phone
---
Have you seen the shotty for console?
---
I literally just plugged it in as I got the notification ooooo my charger broke so my phone is always at about 10%
---
He kinda vibin tho..
---
That's how shoulders work
---
I mean I am deaf in one ear so it may not be a headset issue
---
True ive been grinding through 1 lv for 2 days
---
That was painful
---
Hey that looks alright. I guess I should have specified her in-game character model. You know the one in the operator selection area? Your style is cool but I just wondered if you had the capability to swap out weapon models visually on a 3D model. If not that’s cool. I figure that it’d be pretty difficult to pull off since it would require the use of in-game assets/models.
---
Fill us in?
---
Yeah, I will add it to my list😀👌
---
well if they remove this the thanks for the coversation and bye
---
How he says "wtf" haha
---
Hey, u/Askingsomquestions, can I get a **v i b e c h e c k ?**
---
birb
---
These bad bois got relegated out of pro league I believe
---
This sums up my entire life.
---
I mean, awful but it’s the thought that counts. So very good. 10/10
---
They're probably playing in an area where servers just aren't available, it sucks but with Ubisoft losing lots of money I don't think they'll be investing in any new server locations
---
Ya I was just confused since they were talking about WarOwl
---
Wot m8
---
You probably didn't his his actual head, but just the helmet
---
I fully support the bloc and wexit as well
---
Pretty sure you shot his helmet not his head
---
I did not know  S M A L L A U S S S I E M A N possessed teleportation abilities...
---
Yeah, they both do deep dives on any and every part of their game
---
Bye then UwU
---
Ah I see now
---
what
---
Edit:clip wasnt playing for me, holy shit. Ive had the opposite happen cuz sometimes hatches are portals to an unknown realm apparently
---
I mean, this perspective issue is somewhat easily avoided, if you’re going to hold an angle like OP does in their example you just need to be far away from that corner you’re holding. The closer you are, the more of yourself will be exposed to someone who is further from the angle than you are.
---
They won’t. &amp; that’s the problem with a lot of you guys’ concepts. They clearly stated no more guns are being added and you guys wanna be heard with concepts involving new guns.
---
Just make aiming like hip firing when walking during lean spamming, cause in real life there is no way someone can be accurate while leaning left and right continuously.
---
I don’t understand. If I hit his helmet, it’s still a one-shot regardless? (I hit square-on in the noggin for at least ONE of those shots).
---
You got spawnpeaked again, didn’t you.
---
You have a drone, use it to make sure the area is clear and if it's not, then it's a free kill. 
---
The people who don't use their drone properly have low skill.
---
Capitao has been super fun for me lately. The para with vert/holo has zero recoil and the crossbow is just dirty in the right situations (pillar rappel at bank front door, skylight above garage stairs on consul, etc).
---
Nah it was pretty cool
---
Way too complicated there bud
---
Yup. But this rant has been a while coming.
---
This ain’t dbd fam
---
Just prepare yourself for a spawnpeek.
---
lets rush a shotgun what could go wrong?
---
I usually set my drone up on points like a camera so my teammates can see what's what, but I might try your idea if I know there's a peeper in the lobby.
---
Just play a shield op
---
loin
---
Yeah I was confused about this too
---
You're just mad, you need to always be checking for spawn peaks no matter what. And I say you have no skill if you die to them.
---
Yeah, also should I buy nomad? Is she a good op?
---
Finka
---
Monty gang rise up
---
Rainbow Six is the first Game with weapon licences I know that doesn't feature a Glock. How and why?
---
Get nomad. She prevents run-outs and is hella hot
---
