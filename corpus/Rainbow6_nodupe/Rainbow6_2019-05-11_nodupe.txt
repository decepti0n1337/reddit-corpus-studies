No it wouldn't. Team Fortress 2 has been home to endless amounts of wordless interactions for over a decade.
---
If thats mjolnir, then shouldnt bandit be prone at all times
---
No problem man
---
Tbh I don't think Ubi put much thought into the whole height/weight thing.
---
Yeah, but once you did it with every op (including recruit with special skin), on every difficulty it wasn't very repetitive
---
What kind of cretin came up with that?
---
Ah yes the G36C. Once again. It's so atrocious that even while having access to an ACOG and 30 rounds, it'd still be outclassed by the Type 89. Win rate is the sole decider of power. Not pick rate. If we balanced around pick rate it would probably be horrible. I'll give some examples
---

---
In TF2 the spy is the most picked class bar none, while simultaneously being the worst of the 9 classes, should he be nerfed?
---
In Fortnite(don't kill me) the SMG is one of the best weapons in the game, but is also one of the least picked, should that be buffed because of its pick rate?
---
In Titanfall 2 the Grenadier weapons are some of the most used, while being some of the worse, do they need to be nerfed?
---
In Apex Legends, the Kraber has one of the lowest use rates even when gotten from a supply drop, yet it's capable of one shotting anyone from anywhere on the map. Should that be buffed
---
There's probably a thousand more examples I couldn't be fucked to think about. But do you get the point?
---
But Hibana is a hard breacher. There are only 2 main breachers with Hibana being one. She‚Äôs always going to be more useful as is Thermite. This is an integral element of the game. That‚Äôs why all breachers are played a lot because you need them. 
---
Ash doesn‚Äôt need to be as good as Hibana to be viable. I‚Äôd argue 95% of operators aren‚Äôt as good as Hibana but 70% are completely viable. 
---
I guarantee you, and I‚Äôd bet my life on it, these changes would drop her pick rate to probably between 30-40% pick rate and roughly a 0-0.5% win delta, which would statistically place her right in the balanced category and you‚Äôd also feel it in game with her being played not every round, maybe even not every match. And that‚Äôs ok. She‚Äôd still be viable though. Still has a versatile kit and decent weaponry to boot, with 3 speed and a small hitbox. 
---
Let me ask you a question: If my changes, or ones similar were added, what do YOU think the impact on Ash would be, whether positive or negative and explain why? I‚Äôm honestly curious what you‚Äôd view would happen. It‚Äôs all opinion based so no one‚Äôs wrong üëç

Dokkaebi elite leak- Arrogant K-Pop singer
---
how the hell do people do this?
---
Alright reading through this thread is making me actually vomit. It's really easy to say "dokk gun bad cav gun good" but how about I actually bring up some stats so you can see that you're just talking out of your ass.
---
The average kill distance is less than 10m in this game, as stated by the devs. Let's use that as a metric for TTK (remember, the lower the TTK, the faster it kills someone).
---
Dokk's DMR has the TTK of **133ms-133ms-267ms** at armour levels 1, 2, and 3.
---
* For reference, *the TTK is identical to all DMR's for up to 2 armor,* transitioning out of the 2 shot kill range into the 3 shot kill range against 3 armor. This is the same for Maverick and Blackbeard's DMR's. Buck and Twitch/Lion's DMR's remain a two shot kill at all armor levels. The minority of DMR's (2/5) are two shot kills at 3 armor. We can conclude **Dokk's DMR is completely standard in terms of DMR's in terms of TTK.** She also has the advantage of a 20 round magazine, which puts it **above Maverick's DMR** as well.
---
 
---
Dokk's CZ has a TTK of **120-180-180ms.**
---
* Against 1 armor opponents, the CZ has the *second best TTK in the game, out of all weapons,*  second only to the SMG 11. Against 2 armor, *the CZ has a faster TTK to Twitch's F2* (180-184 respectively). Against 3 armor, it keeps the same TTK, still beating out the F2. With this data, our **only conclusion is that the CZ is an incredibly powerful secondary.**
---
Dokk's SMG12 has a TTK of **142-142-189ms.**
---
* Against 1 armor opponents, the average TTK for all attacker primaries is 155ms. *Dokk's SMG12 is above that average with it's TTK of 142*. Against 2 armour, the *SMG12 is 1ms away from tied with the fastest TTK weapons in the game in that armor range*, being Fuze's AK12 and Hibana's Type 89 (141-142 respectively). It is also *tied with the SMG11*. Against 3 armor, the average TTK for all attacker weapons in 185. *The SMG12 is only slightly behind the average at 189*. With this data, we can conclude that **the SMG12 is also extremely powerful.**
---
I could stop there because it's been proven in plain text that you have no fucking idea what you're talking about, but for fun, let's go over Cav's guns.
---
Cav's M12 (which you said is "super good" has a TTK of **218-327-327ms.**
---
* For reference, the average TTK for defender SMG's is 204. Cav's SMG is below average against 1 armor'd opponents. Against 2 armor, **Cav's M12 is BY FAR the worst SMG in the game at 327**, with second place being the P90 at 309. Although there are only 3 3-armor attackers in the game with Monty, Fuze and Gridlock. But just for fun, if you happen to fight any of those three, **it's also the worst SMG in the game.** With this data, we can conclude that **Cav's M12 is fucking terrible.**
---
Doing shotgun analysis is tricky due to all the variables involved, but if you bother to research (which you obviously don't) you'll see that it's a respectable shotgun, above average in the semi auto tier and the fact that it is semi auto already puts it above all of the pump actions anyway. With that being said, **the fact that is it a shotgun puts it behind other defender weapons.**An argument that smoke uses a primary shotgun and is still powerful is irrelevant due to his secondary being the SMG11.
---
Cav's Luison **remains a two shot kill at all armor levels when at the average kill distance**. For a quick recap, most pistols in the game share the same TTK in respect to their shot counts. Two shot pistols have a TTK of 133, three shot being 267, etc.
---
* For reference, against 1 armor, it is a 2 shot kill. **This puts it in the better half of pistols** (11 being two shot kill, 10 being 3 shot.) Against 2 armor,  **the Luison remains a two shot kill,** being one of 7 to remain a two shot kill. If you ever face a three armor, it is **one of the 4 that is still a two shot kill**. With this data, we can conclude that **Cav's Luison is a very powerful secondary.**
---
**In conclusion, do your fucking research before you sit here for hours fucking embarrassing yourself.**
---
How does a fan create better armor then a AAA developer?
---
*A* skyscraper not skyscraper
---
Nomad definitely
---
I feel like the armor would combine making it 5 instead
---
Not the one we need, but the one we deserve.
---
When you place it too close to a door sometimes the defuser gets placed partially outside of the room. In this case you lose the round since the game thinks the defuser is destroyed since it isnt in a room with a bomb and has been placed. This happens because your character model is in the room enough to place the defuser, but isnt in enough to place the defuser in enough.
---
I swear to god I will be so pisses off if it does get removed
---
Absolutely man, killer job. Would u mind telling me what kind of paint you used? Makes me wanna try one now lol

This looks so awesome!

Yeah im not too sure about that. I like the concept but i feel it would have a hard time being balancing it.

Yeah i looked into it it was black flag

True. Just a thought

Funny thing is that's how my friend got the black ice skin for Buck's dmr. I hate him.

you're ugly

What a team player. Actually, With muscles like those, he did it all by himself-

Yep, same here. I was really hoping they would change it from the response to the leaks but, once again, there's a GSG9 Elite that I'm forced to pass on...
---
Bet he could ride down the skyscraper like ghostrider
---
It's not smurfing if you made a new account and are genuinely trying to level it up, and aren't bullying all the children in your path. I did the same thing, I was lucky enough to get to try the newcomer playlist on my low level account once it came out, but after that all I use it for is my username.
---
Play ranked, people there are less likely to leave.

*Does your gear come with that polish?*

Only a plat deals in absolutes

Thank you!

[I hate this skin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArwEgM14QHs)
---
I mean if it‚Äôs cas it‚Äôs cas but I would like to see something steeper for ranked
---
Oh yeah, you're right.
---
No it would not be great, it would be essentially be like Apex‚Äôs finishers and have the same flaws
---
Yeah she is always TK twitch
---
Mozzie imo
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest with you, I just wanna know who has the most subs. Not favoritism
---
It was my first time ever seeing it, funny thing is I watched him do it on the last round while in the droning prep phase, his whole team was crowded around him watching him try to do it. And when he did they all just turned and looked at my drone like I saw something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see and destroyed my drone. I did record it though.
---
Thanks dude.Thats really encouraging
---
Don‚Äôt make me spawn peek you
---
I only play ranked and had people leave right off the bat two games in a row
---
That's exactly what I just said
---
I mean IQ's elite skin is just a jogging outfit. They dont have to make sense, they just have to look cool
---
I'm ok with the biker skin (On principal, they should have left the hair like it was in his old pic) since it's a good theme and relates to the character's background. IQ's is just lazy (and bad) fanservice garbage.
---
Yea
---
100% waste of renown
---
Yes yes yes YES!!!
---
Yea other wise it would get boring
---
Yeah ela's SMG is so hard to get kills with. Either give her impacts or buff the SMG. I'd like both but beggars can't be choosers
---
Me.Stark cough* cough* I don‚Äôt feel so good
---
beaulo and kixstar pls.
---
Is it? I have all the operators, and most of the skins/uniforms. What's left to buy?
---
Yes.I would like this as an elite skin
---
Look into it. They aren't for everyone but they can be worth it. Especially if you can find some cheap ones
---
I had a 100,000 ping ones idk how
---
I personally hate the Bandit Elite skin

nah, bandits a kick ass mofo

He drops to copper, gets the hecc out, and even loses his games.
---
He isn't the only one, by the way. MANY content creators do it. I'd rather have him, an honest, non-toxic streamer than that hot piping garbage god-complex showing King George who got kicked from his pro team.
---
Well, now you do.
---
That's his character. It's pathetic.
---
Funny story i work at a prison and these are the sure fire signs of a member of prison aryan culture. The bald head, the tattoos, motorcycle gang member, and the thors hammer pendant.
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with the map personally. I just make sure I bring an ACOG and drone the shit out of it. I really like defending on it a lot.
---
Ding Dong your opinion is wrong
---
Well, the type 89 is really good (apart from the low capacity) but the supernova is good if u r 5 stack rushing. When people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs the worst shotgun in the game‚Äù they mean it has the slowest fire rate of any shotgun, damage can be inconsistent tho.
---
It took about 9 hours  to paint by hand.
---
Very smexy other than the school desk tattoos.
---
If you're and anchor laid is good, but alibi can also be very useful and a decent anchor, as well as lesion although I would say hes more of a roamer
---
The problem with the Outbreak game mode previously is that it just simply doesn't have any strat involved. It is purely a zombie massacre and survival mode, the difficulty scale up purely based on how fast you can take the zombie. The whole game mode feels just like a mindless non-stop killing process.
---
Here are some problems with this game mode and how it should be reworked:
---
Problems:
---
-Game mode is heavily zombie massacre and survival based, so the operators with a large mag are going to have an advantage, this is why operators like Lion, Finka, Ying, Doc are better compare to others. Plus, some operators gadget just don't align the objective well with the game mode
---
-Game mode is really linear, it lacks the scouting and stealth element from Far Cry, searching for the Thermite charges is just walk in, kill, grab charges and survive, you just can't go for the undetected route to take objective. And when it is time to defend, there is no instruction on what kinds of opposition you are facing, and which direction they are coming from, such that you can take down reinforcement and rework your focus through reinforcement orientation. Instead everything just run towards you from every direction possible, and the best way to play with it, is to reinforce everything and grab all the spare reinforcement from the tray, then kill everything as fast as possible
---
-Some operators gadget are just irrelevant and not suitable for this Outbreak game mode, what's the point to set trap on Kapkan when there are thousands of zombies out there? the proper way to use Ash's breaching charge is to use it like a grenade launcher, Tachanka's turret is not 360 degree and is just a stationary gun with more bullets than his SMG, Ying's candela I don't even remember I have any chance to use it, because all you do is kill, reload, kill, reload, she's still top picks for this game mode regardless due to her LMG and its fast reload speed
---
-Similar to the problem in protect hostage mode, normal terrorist should never have access to exothermic charges but these yellow breachers are just all over the place, making reinforcement redundant, and apex is just another thing here to test how fast you can kill its minions and dodge his RPG. Rooters have very interesting mechanics, they somehow know when they rush you and knock you down right when you reload. But then again in my opinion, it is also just another thing to test how much DPS you can spit out while she's visible on the ground, no strat involved at all
---
How it should be reworked:
---
1) Bandit/Kaid should be playable as a counter to breachers. As mentioned before, the whole Outbreak game mode needs to be reworked, the game mode doesn't tell you what kind of opposition you are facing, which direction they are coming from. Those site defending scene should be re-adjusted, less reinforcement available total but are retrievable. Give time break between each wave for us to re-adjust reinforcement orientation. Replace Kapkan with Lesion as his gadget has regen timer and can be deployed during a wave, it is more suitable in game mode like this with constant opposition so that you can deploy Gu accordingly, unlike Kapkan with limited gadget count, and can't really be deployed during action phase, once the traps are consumed by these thousands of zombies, you are no different from a recruit. Matter of fact, a lot of the gadgets should be time regen based rather than count limited based due to how this game mode is made.
---
2) Capitao should be playable as a counter to apex since smoke (not SAS) will lock up zombies within the area, any minions spawned by apex will be locked up, then he can burn it with fire. Smoke (SAS) on the other hand, doesn't really stop zombies from rushing because smoke grenade is the one that can lock up zombies, which was one of the reason why Ying was so good in that game mode when she had smoke grenade back then. Either fix Smoke's (SAS) canister with area lock effect or just replace him with Capitao because he will be able to counter apex better since crossbow travel further, faster and more precise than Smoke's (SAS) throwable style canister.
---
3) Both Sledge and Jackal should be a playable character, with Jackal's eyenox enabled on rooter, and when rooter used dig move, sledge would be able to one hit rooter through floor with his hammer just like those hammer arcade game machine.
---
4) Tachanka turret should have knockback effect. As I mentioned before, his turret is just a stationary gun with more bullets than his SMG, if they can make Nomad's blast off feature, I don't see how you can't make knockback effect. With such effect, a smasher who charges towards him will be stopped in the middle of the road, and so people can nail him easier and knife it since it sprint a long distance every charge. And more importantly, his turret needs to be 360.
---
5) The Ellen Mackintosh scene should be reworked as a breach and clear hostage scene instead of walk-in and press G to revive scene, that kind of small room is a perfect place for this kind of action to take place, it should be heavily fortified and timed before Ellen bleeds out.
---
6) Thermite charge search scene should be timed search, grab and escape scene instead of walk-in and survive scene, it should give you a prep phase with drones to scout in the beginning, zombie spawn rate should escalate as a function of time, and it starts as soon as you step in the zone.
---
He will always have a special place in my heart.
---
Is that a cerakote?
---
Press f12 i think, its a sound thing
---
Somebody call an exorcist! Amirite?
---
I've got bigger matters to handle than throwing a poll into a community that thinks BB is weak and needs a 240 hp buff and lion is weak and needs a full body outline back and Hereford with 1 staircase is better. This community has absolutely no idea what balance means.
---
And opinions CAN be right or wrong. You can always choose your side. You chose yours. And I'll let you know it's wrong. Otherwise everybody could just walk around with the notion that "rape is good, school shooting  is good" and defend it by saying iTs An oPiNiOn. World doesn't work like that.
---
Yep.

Respected, but not accepted.

I usually play buck if im not doing too good. The tough recoil lets you learn how to control it better in a faster amount of time. He has frags. And his gadget is super useful. If youre looking for more of a support role then i would definately recomend jackal. Just stick with your team and pick up prints for them.
---
Back last year this came up but only for jager and now it‚Äôs for every op with a shield .... last year u put ur ads on a wal then pulled ur shield out and it worked so idk now .
---
No it got both kills in there but I can resubmit it if you think I should
---
Bandit.

Either Maestro or Lesion are probably the best ones to go for
---
Oh that would be fun
---
Ooohhhh noooo!

that i knew i was referring to this new glitch

Oh I‚Äôm just fucking blind... sorry about that

That one is pretty sexy

Highest fire rate in the game. Be careful what you wish for
---
Bandit:¬†It's funny, 'cause just the other day, me and my boy, we was wonderin' why they even call 'em roofies. Y'know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
---
Blitz:¬†No. Don't know what you're talkin' 'bout.
---
Bandit:¬†Why not floories, right? 'Cause when you take 'em, you're more likely to end up on the floor than the roof. What about groundies? That's a good new name fo' 'em.
---
Jager:¬†Or how 'bout rapies?
---
Bikini bodhi is pretty big. If yourr just looking for good quality content though. Jager Himself Too is pretty good. If youre on console check out Priest
---
Buddy honestly its just a lot of things all together. My parents have been divorced since I was 12 and only 2 years ago did I get my playstation that can only stay at my moms house. Every Sunday I switch houses (both are about a 5 minute drive apart) and thats a week I go without siege. Sometimes I come back like nothing happened and played like I did before I left but sometimes, dude, I'm total shit. Siege definitely has a lot more players than it did before and a lot more randomness. The game has improved in so many ways and worsened in many as well and it is about who you are playing against as well.
---
A good day for you is a bad day for someone else, or vice versa. Dumb spots you would only see in copper gameplay may wins games because nobody expects them. Sometimes your team mates are just shit. Sometimes you're just shit. Sometimes, the game itself fucks you over and even more rare, some people are out to make you miserable. Call of Duty is a simple wind up clock that is repetitive and without dynamic to it. Rainbow Six Siege is a self driving car with a bomb inside of it and three drunken blind men that is essentially always a crazy ride. Sometimes, things just don't go your way dude, but trying different things always helps. I wish the best for you dude, and I've been gold 1 four seasons in a row, never hit plat.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna steal the Declaration of Independence.‚Äù
---
It's fine it took me a minute to notice 2 kills too
---
honestly what works for me is to take a break from the game and either play something else for awhile if thats an option, its definitely helped me over the years and allows you to come back fresh
---
oof

i always use russian red dot always over russian reflex because it's so much better, so i never find myself much use for the reflex while with the holographic and reflex i always find myself switching depending on how i feel and on what gun.  Holographic is chunky frame but more accurate reticle while Reflex is smaller frame but less accurate reticle. I could see myself saying russian red dot and russian reflex is best of both worlds, small frame and accurate reticle, but i just don't see myself ever using the russian reflex because of my preference.
---
also russian reflex is just ugly lmao
---
nomad reflex is just normal reflex but much thicker frame, which one major advantage with the normal reflex is its smaller frame.

lol he got kicked? I thought he actually quit. haha ouch. Anyway ok so yeah I know its not just him specifically and he does get out but still I just dont like the idea of getting forcibly fucked up by a literal diamond player because of whatever their agendas are.

" Mornin.' "
---
Yeah idk what happened
---
Thanks a lot dude. You're right, its all of the above. What matters is that we don't give up right? I mean i love the game but knowing that i can do better, knowing that i AM better is whats stressing me out. And i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one. I really hope this is just a phase, for both of us, and i hope you hit plat soon, you deserve it! Thanks again
---
What‚Äôs the alternative? That the bullets only hit people if you really really really mean it?

Twitch and thatcher require another gadget in addition to there primary (and I‚Äôm always wary of twitch drones; if I know they have one I‚Äôll jam doorways and drone holes too) dink‚Äôs and buck I‚Äôm assuming that you mean which do work admittedly but they‚Äôre not using them on anything else and I know where they are now. As for maverick: for my sanity I just pretend he doesn‚Äôt exist or I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play the game

Thats the point.

wait it does??

I‚Äôve had a castle block rotation doors multiple times in the same round during prep. By the end I hit it with an impact grenade. 
---
You can have this back when you‚Äôve earned it
---
This is why I have a suppressor on half of my loadout, I always play the bells mid round, defending or attacking.
---
now I know why the lift in a skyscraper is broke
---
I both agree and disagree with this statement, also any Castle who barricades that door when site is garage is in fact allowed to be tked
---
(unless there is rotation holes obv)
---
The reason why the new team killing penalty symbol is the symbol on Castle's barricade upside down
---
I agree that BOTH herefords sucked ass

Right but why express annoyance at something that you can‚Äôt change? Like oh gee I hate that I need to breathe in all this oxygen.

Haha lol, my top operators are glaz and ela, like 50 hours each I've only been playing since Health and I dont really main anybody, I try to pick a variety each game depending on what we need, though I suck at shield ops. 
---
I actually used elas shotgun since she came in (SMG from time to time since it was OP but yeah) and I still use her a pretty good amount now to shallow roam and to help stop rushes. What I like about her now is she gets underestimated because of the nerf, so people see ela and arent afraid to push her and then you just devastate them with the shotgun. I admit on long corridor maps I tend to pick someone else, but close turns and lots of rooms I like to bring her. 
---
I recently have fallen in love with the lion rework because I don't feel as scummy as when he came out and since I haven't been playing him like at all I figured I'd try the rework and I really like how he is good at determining positions and deciding how to proceed, rather than roam hunter. I will admit it's still stupid strong and it will probably be nerfed again.

so far from the truth. I played on PS4 from beta up until September of last year and I have yet to meet anyone nearly as toxic on PC as I did on PS4. PC is the best.

I played console since Black Ice and got PC siege some time in Year Two. Gamesense will 100% carry you the platinum alone (With a good squad) and I think gunskill gives you the final push to diamond. What rank were you on Console?

Cool. Season 2 when?

i don't even want old one back just get rid of new hereford from ranked map pool
---
Well to be honest I kept practicing terrorist hunt until I could beat it at realistic setting and I still got destroyed playing casual. It takes time to find guns you like and even longer to learn how to control recoil. And even longer than that to learn maps and kinda try to predict enemy moves and you will actually get better by playing, I promise
---
Or IF you just practice it enough to control it. IMO one of the best guns just takes a bit of skill to use

I play strictly T hunts cause I don't care for ranked or casual. I play this game to decompress not add to the stress. Maybe check your connection or see if you can change servers based on your location. Good luck over all though and don't feel peer pressure to play a mode you have no interest in.

Any map that is not balanced should not be in ranked like old Hereford back was way better than new Hereford bace I feel like if u want Hereford bace in ranked is the old one not the rework

Then don't play ranked if you don't care, if you're with a pre-made team, that's fine, but when you solo queue play casual, cuz people on ranked most of the times actually do try, and it's not fair on the  if your there, cuz u don't try

when? i never heard sth like that.

There will be something starting Monday, the reason why they've not gave info away is because their bullshit ghost recon game got in the way and are waiting until next week, if there's nothing next week then there may be a delay for next season.

What AA are you using?

dont worry. they announce it first then put it on tts for testing and stuff.

I get some of the same problems, so go fuck yourself. You don‚Äôt think that console suddenly loses frames, even though we payed a lot of money (by console standards) for them?

oh good, finally something good happens since im on console

Next Invitational, maybe. I hope we get it!

Holy shit you are actually mad lol dude go calm down somewhere don‚Äôt be so butt hurt hahahahaha

If you bought the season pass you should have all the ops from that season. Are you on console or pc, and if you are on console is it Xbox?

yeah man youre right. i was thought about this too. hope they dont do operation health 2.0

Best kill i have seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dude quit searching and re-search
---
Do this with the bandit elite mvp that .... would be sick
---
I said console but I‚Äôm mainly mean yourself due to the lack of knowledge of why it is important to get 144 FPS. If you don‚Äôt get high enough FPS to the monitors refresh rate the screen starts to tear which makes it really hard to play. Consoles don‚Äôt get this because it‚Äôs synced up, but on pc it is equivalent to t-hunt on console with vsync disabled.

Nice eye
---
Since the beginning of the season, its a whole set with matching headgear and uniform. jackal has also such a set.
---
It sounds like he'd be encroaching on fuze's role, and fuze already doesn't see a lot of play. I'd rather see the ability to drill through reinforced surfaces be added to cluster charges, than a new operator who can do that.

AND a badass beard that some guys would dream of having

Download and run prime95 on your computer it will stress the cpu and make it as hot as possible. Watch the temps during the stress test and see if the pass 90. Most cpus will slow down as tenos surpass 90C

60 with it off, 60+ if you got a higher grade console.

V-Sync is always off for me, T- Hunt &amp; Multiplayer.
---
There‚Äôs an option that makes it cap out at 30 fps . Don‚Äôt remember which one specifically though.
---
Not only on L8 - I meant that in every gun you only can you should have ACOG due to corner peek exploit. Only logic reason to put any sight over ACOG is playing rush/push operator (Ash/Capitao/aggressive Zofia etc.)

My team didn't even leave , the match began like that

Or you could not all spawn in the same spot?

So I've heard that what people would like to do to change this is have Clash's shield be made out of 4 glass panels, and each one would be breakable similar to Blackbeard's shield but obviously it would take far more than 1-2 shots. Somewhere in the range of 20-30 bullets would make it interesting.

Hey! so sorry for the late reply, yesterday it started working for a little bit then all of a sudden it just cut back to not working at all, even after restarts, but to answer your question, after a couple of matches.
---
Okay and? Your already fucked up. Your saying twitch shouldn't be able to use her drone for damage then cause if I'm lit to 10 or less health and holding the only angle she can drone in and kill me from cover. Your point is stupid.
---
If clash and you are in a 1v1 and your at 15 hp and shes full, your team played poorly that round suck it the fuck up and take the one round loss. It isnt a game based off of 1v1s it is balanced for 5v5 single elimination rounds.
---
Your argument really boils down to. "If they shoot me they should take the same damage so it's fair."
---
I bet 80% of this subreddit wasn't even alive when this game was released.

Shitake. You're right. I still should have gotten that kill. Guess I'll pull the post.

Vegas Co-op Thunt was amazing. I loved the cover mechanic too.

Why is every guy in this sub so fucking toxic? Jesus like none of you can debate without be a dick. i don't agree with the whole ban thing either. I mean kicking the person from the game doesn't really solve anything even if it wasn't an accident , the damage is already done. The round is already over. Though a pretty easy solution is to just not play hostage I guess, who even likes to play it anyway?
---
These are A-Tier gamer tags
---
Don't play hostage my dude, it's complete turd anyway. Filter your matchmaking settings for Bomb and Secure Area.

Ranked isn't there to get diamond. You get a full game, faster rounds, full team with no one leaving (usually), better gameplay with less run n gun/headless plays, better matchmaking. Casual is unplayable due to toxicity, long rounds, leaving/joining shitshow, and casual superstars.

True but they still should fix that about ranked

---
When you spawn you're all right beside each other, and cav's pistol does so much damage up close that she can two hit everyone before they get the chance to realize what's happening. It doesn't come down to skill usually, just getting surprised by a toxic player, and while it doesn't happen often it still does happen and the player gets away with it punishment free
---
Plot twist: he doesnt actually know
---
First season was black ice, but most people bought them at the time, and lots of people get them from alpha packs so they're not rare anymore.
---
Well that works too, the actual strat is a Mira on a nonbroke nonreinforced wall and use the Mira for LOS for wallbangs

i personally love both ops. jackal is great for roamer hunting, but i even play him just to drag because that‚Äôs how amazing i find his kit. maverick on the other hand is so much fun to play and super versatile. you can‚Äôt go wrong with either op. myself, i went for maverick first :)
