We need a tachanka “The Lord” elite skin

Yo guy's i also noticed a clever detail. The character Thatcher from the animated short is the same Thatcher from the game! Could this be a new operator tease?

Introducing our new attacker: school shooter
---
Do you have to be good at the game? XD
---
Hmm I decided to do a bit of research and will attempt to discuss/argue a bit on balancing these 2 guns. But overall I think you overthink a bit too much. I do agree with you on rpm changes not being plausible because of what you have stated. But overlooking the R4C too much of it being too strong while forgetting the fact that the G36C is a sub-par AR is something we should talk about here.
---

---
On paper, the G36C is not a very good AR in terms of raw stats, only surpassing BB's MK17 and Nomad's AK-74M. (you can refer to Rouge-9 stats' spreadsheet for even more in-depth stats.). So the way I see it, buffing G36 to bring it on a same level as the R4C is the priority and also keeping both guns balanced with the other ARs. We can alter the damage statistics so that the G36C can trade blows with the R4C. Reducing the R4C's damage (from 41 to 39) is the first step. But even then R4C's rpm and dps still trumps the G36 so it doesn't hurt buffing the G36 or even nerf the R4C even more so the STK (shots to kill) is similar accross the board. Not entirely similar but I'd say across different distances. The best option I can think of now is to make the R4C's STK 1 shot less than the G36C from 1 to 12 meters and similar from 12 meters and above, at longer distances (12-25m), the G36C will have an advantage over the R4C (1 less STK), that's where the R4C's extended barrel will come in handy. Now that we have established the competitive baseline between the two ARs, we go into the gun feel. I wouldn't change too much at this aspect as Ubi made their intention clear: G36C has more tactical options (angled grip) while easier to control than the R4C. There's recoil, ADS, barrel attachments which you can adjust but i won't go into this too much as it's decent in the current state. The most viable and easy option is a nerf to R4C's magazine size. 20-25 i'd say. 
---
Even after these tweaks there's still another main problem. Ash's still too strong and way too comfortable to play comparing to other operators. That's why I mentioned above that we need to adjust these two guns comparing to other ARs in the game. I'd say keep these two at average; below-average dps comparing to other ARs' average dps. But in the end while my proposals are mostly on a statistical impact, it does not change much the essence and the feel of Ash as an operator overall and this is the exact reason why Ubi really struggles with balancing this operator, a very popular operator also, making it even harder as it has to please a lot more players. That is why I applaud your bold approach and logic with your change even though there will be a lot of underlying problems, not even mention a long time of testing and bringing it live, but the biggest problem is to convince the player that this is a viable solution, which unfortunately is very hard as Ash's R4C is her signature weapon at this point and it is almost an inseparable part of Ash and the relationship it has to the players.

Do you have a pissed girlfriend or wife who may have uninstalled it because they hate it when u play

---
I have up to silver as of yesterday's stream so I'm hoping for gold as of now, I know I wont get the dimond because I didn't watch the preliminary matches
---
Yeah, If you're on Steam, this will happen, even with games that aren't R6, it's been a problem.for a long time unfortunately ☹️
---
I just don’t want the game to turn to cod and have team killing allowed/recoiled and make it reflected because that isn’t how real life works but if that takes away toxicity then I can’t complain 
---
No it was ranked. I'm a plat 3 and was playing w a buddy of mine
---
Any idea when Playlist changes are coming? Are they Y4S1?
---
If it shows up in the Twitch notifications as having earned them, they should automatically be on your Siege account that you have linked to Twitch. All four of my charms so far I've found in-game under any weapon that takes them.
---
"Glaz has always had a downside." 
---
And there it is, a sentence in, not worth it. 
---
Yep, this is why i dislike these kinds of things. It just shifts the problem up a notch.
---
well, can you get kills 
---
Look, everyone can shoot across 30m+ and get headshots, you don't need Glaz to do something like that. Operators with DMRs can potentially do the same while bringing actual utility to the game. Glaz brought nothing to the team back then and suffered from a 0% pick rate constantly in PL. Also, most kills in this game happen at 10m range.
---
Plane just overall sucks. 
---
is this the rework?
---
I didnt see the killing himself but that nitro tk was worth it ngl. Also did you see fabians nade plays? Lol
---
Why did they change casual? I love it the way it currently is.
---
There's already a form of decay in the seasonal resets, no reason to have another form of decay.
---
Yeah sure lean spamming may take skill but it’s just retarded realistically. Rainbow was always meant to be that ‘realistic’ (yes I know operator gadgets like the yokai drone and hologram are unrealistic). Think about it, they don’t teach the SAS to quickly lean your gun left and right again and again and it’s just straight out annoying to die to. I respect that I may require skill but it just makes gunfights ultra stressful and it doesn’t feel ‘authentic’ in terms of the gameplay of rainbow. 
---
No team empire deserved second place 
---
no not yet, but that’s perfect. i’ll make one today or tomorrow 
---
The Commando's not enough to make me play Mozzie. I'm sorry but it's hard pass today. Even though it pains me to leave my Commando behind but at least Gridlock also has the Super Shorty. Battlefield 4 lives on!
---
Most of the time... I'm good at apex and decent at siege.. I'm no diamond tho (I'm on xbox)
---
It also says I have the silver charm all the way back from the Paris major. But it never appeared in my account 
---
Really? I thought there'd be a cool Indigenous Australian dot-painted style skin...
---
So, you're willing to completely ignore numerical evidence because seeing a Glaz makes you feel real mad inside?
---
I also have pubg
---
Yes
---
Buy it through the Ubisoft store, use the ubisoft club 20 percent discount that costs 100 uplay units and you get yourself the season pass at a much cheaper price.
---
There is a reason they took the first map 22 rounds to decide a  victor

There is so much wrong with this thread... and it's not only the formatting.
---
doncaster?
---
And hospitals to hide weapons in for HAMAS
---
Huh? Im saying even if they change resetting, itll still have worth. If im at 5hp id rather be reset to 20.
---
She was still pretty damn famous in 2014, which is why they picked her. She's a recognizable face and a celebrity.
---
I love the way that it kind of acts the same as the commando from Black ops 1
---
Game 1 was grudgingly long, and I feel like that wore on Empire.
---
Grat G2, amazingly well played.
---
With the Capitao buff you can shoot the roof above them and have the fire fall down. He'll be a great counter
---
Pretty much all of it. I worked a desk job and watch more prelim matches than ever before 
---
Probably not, but I would much rather have a proper match of "all stars" than a comedy match. Maybe let the audience vote who should be on teams beforehand, and organize a proper match with some kind of prize for motivation, so the players actually take it seriously. 
---
Otherwise, yes it is fun, but I'd rather they keep a move-on with the show, as it is Sunday/Monday night/morning for a lot of the world as already, and some of us have to get to work in the morning, so I'd appreciate if the finals could take place 2-3 hours sooner, instead of this fun little all star game with zero meaning.  
---
Yeah for sure, deployable shields are already great tools on certain sites on certain maps. I'm super happy they did this though since it not only required hefty game knowledge on knowing where and when they're good, but also just felt useless on certain maps.
---
KROKODIL?
---
First Line of Defense mixed with a mountain slope. Seems right.
---
For a splitsecond i thought he would actually straight murder the guy.
---
I see the joke but G2 always banned lion 
---
At one point I’m pretty sure it was at top with 260+ viewers 
---
Do we know when the bulk of the changes (ranked, lean spam, etc) are being patched in, or is it on the test server with the new ops?
---
I was on live and my bladder got really hurt by the first match.
---
you need to read more thoroughly
---
This content requires the base game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege on Steam in order to play.
---
That’s pretty crazy and I’d think I’d have to move my head physically instead of my eyes but I just like less input lag with a monitor
---
I knew it I told you guys India and Mexico were marked for a reason. 
---
Once again. The pro league came kinda boring since you know they always win anyway. I want to watch a league that's different for once dammit.
---
It may. If you can get it through the floor i think it will spread down there still
---
I tuned in in the middle of this and thought it was the grand final and was very confused 
---
I know, right? I think it's gonna be cool af to see an op in a suit
---
[I’m referring to this](https://youtu.be/_ZtOz-KKMhI)
---
whats the original thing of the last scene
---
No, I never denied it. I was looking forward to it. Until I saw what they were doing. I know it won't effect the majority of players. Still just feels like a waste. I'll be using dmr ops to snipe because the sniper won't be able to detect defenders on multiple windows. 
---
Well yea. I could be overlooking that, but SSG’s game with G2 amazed me with their performance 
---
New event? For one week roles are swapped.
---
Echo and jackel would be so strong
---
It's almost over then he'll be banned in ranked 
---
I don't need to say this any simpler, no.
---
well you can try out later. and no you don’t have to be amazing. it shouldn’t be hard for you to make it. permanently or temporarily would you do? you should make it depending on who else comments. if no one else comments about it then you definitely would make it temporarily at least. oh and if your good at apex then that’s good because we need aped players as well
---
Ofc you are, after all, you're on console
---
Okay
---
That's not suit... again, go in game check recruits model.

dude i have a roni kit for my airsoft glock. that’s the coolest thing ever that they added this in
---
3 speeds are not stronger then 1 speeds in my opinion. If you watched pro league a team would rather have a 1 speed like mira,echo, maestro that can provide Intel. That is why 1 speeds have a higher ban rate then 3 speeds. 3 speeds are fast but their gadgets are less helpful then 1 speed ops. So why do 3 speeds need more changes then 1 speeds? As you stated before, g2 had no problem countering a 3 speed joystick. 
---
I have to agree, I'm so glad Ubisoft didn't drop the ball with this one, I might actually just buy the season pass just to support the game.
---
Think Fabian hated him the most aswell
---
Bartlett was also partly reworked for PvP. The library used to have a ladder instead of stairs, the model hallway was wider, there was a staircase by the main entrance, etc.

Annoyingly the F90 is the exoirt semi-auto civilian version. The full-auto military version is the EF88,

Glaz’s Thermal Scope no longer works if you’re moving. There are a bunch of other ones too, but this is the one I  wanted to discuss.
---
Except that Gu mines still do 10 damage, and 4 (after the nerf) damage every couple of seconds.
---
Gu mines are also incredibly hard to see, trax stingers....not so much.
---
Awesome I can’t wait !
---
For one it'd make it harder for hackers to get into ranked matches. Other than that I'm not too entirely sure.

I'm shocked they didn't go the aboriginal route either. I feel this is gonna cause some tension once more people start seeing these skins.
---
Apex is only #1 because of shroud
---
Having the option to immediately punish, or maybe a hybrid system in which you only get the ability to punish if they have a bad history of unforgiven damage?
---
I absolutely love Ash and her R4C but even though I love your idea as well. I would love to try out different options and I like forcing Ash to commit to one playstyle (shotgutn for rush etc.). But I would like to keep the X1 for thermite as well. I dont think there would be a problem with both ops being able to run the X1 since they have different playstyles and its not "op". I dont know if 3 ARs for one op would be too many because at least one of them would be left to collect dust (most likely the G36). But If we let Ash keep the G36 rushing and holding angles would still be possible (cant decide if a goof thing) but with a mediocre gun for this playstyle overall. Hit me with your thoughts on my point!
---

---
just turn hostage &amp; secure off??
---
But it takes time to get the muscle memory rhythm so you can effectively lean and be able to compensate for recoil. It’s harder then you think to be accurate while button spamming, but you’re right they’re taking it away because it is spammed but the fix makes it so your head is basically motionless
---
Another American?
---
I don't think we have any thoughts, any beliefs, anything in common if you are talking about shotguns for an attacker. They are not used, and they are not used for a reason, and for an obvious reason.
---
Just because you can get away lucky with one or two times with a shotgun in a rush round, doesn't mean it's viable. 
---
I got nothing much to say here, but I don't believe removing the ACOG from the R4-C is the best solution. There was no statistical data that shows Ash is overpowered, she's just overpicked and her R4-C is overpicked. She's picked so often because she's 3 speed with a powerful gadget that aligns with her 3 speed, but why not Hibana and IQ? Hibana's gun is 20 bullets, IQ's gun isn't as high DPS. 
---
The reason why I say removing the ACOG from the R4-C isn't the best solution is because it is a change that has relation with preference, some people can and do use the R4-C without magnification, some people can't. The issue here is that this change affect some people and doesn't affect the rest. You can nerf the damage from 36 to 32, I don't care, I will still use it if it has an ACOG, but not without an ACOG. Using optics other than the ACOG will render a lot of muzzle flesh since I use compensator, and this is a problem.
---
GIVE ME YOUR HAT
---
It all looks soo good.
---
Can't Wait!
---
New running animation?
---
Dude everyone has a different role to play. Even when you watch pro league. Top frag this invitationaln for g2 was like kanto, but the highest KOST (value) player is goga. At that point it's not about frags and clutching. It's about playing your position. You have entry frags, hard breach, planters, roamers, anchors, plant denial, etc. Not everyone is going to frag out. It's a team based strategy game. Just bc you felt clutch yet doesn't mean you're garbage. You got plat and playing with plats will get you better. You're not going to get good playing against your own level, you need to challenge yourself. My source is that I'm a diamond and have been playing for a long time. You just need to be a team player and you'll get better and better. 
---
your quicking picking needs a bit of work TBH
---
The Type-89 has only 20 rounds which is a major factor since just about all other attacker auto primaries have 30+ rounds. Many attackers have breach charges or soft breaching ability. The Bearing's recoil is horrendous. Hibana can open 1 more hatch than Thermite but she is much worse at making big entry holes. I've explained how the R4-C is better. 
---
thanks
---
It was not terrible lol
---
They may be ghosting you. Or Ubi needs to sort their shit out. Line call really.

You said there are no spawn peek capabilities but youre 1000% wrong. People will still peek unfortunately. Itll just be harder to guess where attackers will run to, given the large spawn are around the base
---
She will still be very useful to clear out roamers that can’t hide behind a mute jammer. 
---
They should just take out duplicates. They clearly can do it since they did it for the special packs.
---
That's not really how it works since there's no lag compensation

Sorry for the shit quality I was too busy freaking out to think of taking a screenshot. We came back from 0-3 and won 5-4.

Can we get a double elimination bracket next major? Maybe next invitational if that ain't feasible?
---
this isnt amazing?
---
Well the finals were already  scheduled for today well ahead of time so it’s not like they could just move it now. Plus the other panels and events wouldn’t fit yesterday too. 
---
Not at all harsh.
---
It's not like a Jackal scan where you actually have to find footprints and put yourself at risk tracking them, it's LITERALLY just pressing a button.
---
At the press of a button you can know that there's a roamer upstairs and such, that's powerful enough when you take into account he literally just presses a button for it.

Uplay friends was stuck at "Connecting..."  I restarted Rainbow through Steam and now all my friends are offline.

How about you fuck off and go play on PC.

PC or console

That’s just like... your opinion man.

I think it would be better if it added on to the lore that they gave in the game

Even better Hibana's face is no longer an eyesore.

Wonder whether Mozzie and Echo will be friends or rivals.

The 3rd one isn't white. It's bugged in the menu, can confirm it looks great when you actually see it though!

Who cares about console players anymore? Have of you play with mouse and keyboard anyway past plat 3 lol
---
What about getting removed from the match. As you can’t teamkill a second time, is there a way to still kick players who attempt to do this over and over again. I don’t want a toxic player purposely killing himself (by trying to shoot me) to grief. I want that guy gone if he keeps trying to get me
---
People like me? I like the new maps. They change things up. Hell Theme Park is my favourite map in the game right now.

You can't assume my opinions on anything just because I'm pissed they're giving us less content this year.

Lmao this clip

They aren't ghosting me, that's for sure.

Cosplay is lame as shit. So no it isn't amazing.

Just as an explanation not an excuse, Ubisofts yearly public financial reports show that the US/Canada  alone represent 47% of their entire revenue so they are absolutely pandering to their main audience

Matchmaking errors, a 2 stack may have ran into an issue

They could switch some buttons such as the one tap button which litterally basically has no use 
---
Oh nice. Maybe that's what they meant when they said she got promoted too
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKDccmaWQbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKDccmaWQbY) They could switch some buttons as priesT says

“No love for Brazil/Japan/China/Poland/Morocco/Spain/S.Korea/Italy” - they all have 2 ops.

Maybe the newcomers playlist will help with smurfs?

People who bought the standard edition will still own a copy of the game.

Yes it's annoying they keep changing, but seriously just stfu already.

Why post a bug? It isn’t helpful, it’s promoting cheap game exploits 
---
Cayde’s dead body is literally on the cover art for Forsaken. There’s absolutely no way you didn’t know about this
---
Thats true but they should add the option if you want by switching some buttons that are barely used
---
Such as the one tap button and others like preisT says [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKDccmaWQbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKDccmaWQbY)

When does Year 1 hit 36+ months?
---
OH SHIT NAPALM AT 6:00 RUN RUN RUN!!!
---
It is half their revenue from us/ Canada as per page eight of their own annual financial report,
---
No. The season pass is traditionally used to help companies pay for the content they're going to produce. That's why you can buy them before the content has even been dropped
---
Honestly, as an ash main i like this. The removal of ACOG didn't do much to me but lower the ammo count to 20 but giving back ACOG would mean she can't be as aggressive due to the limitation in firepower
---
Source?
---
Only if we also get that casual Dokkaebi skin. 
---
Happens everytime, use is at a normal level (10% when idle and 100% when loading)  
---
I also tested the speeds and everything else but it is all fine
---
This is true which is why they should make a system where you can pick ur own controlls like fortnite (not saying fortnite is a good game)
---
It’s possible but I think the fact that buck is 2 speed will not play in his favour. Also you have to look at what their roles are fundamentally. I think they fit 2 different niches so having both on your team wouldn’t ruin the composition 
---
Even though they have larger in game models, a lot of these projectiles are treated as point objects by the game engine. So they're basically the size of bullets as far as the game knows. 
---
Especially Bc she’s gonna have an acog lmfao
---
yeah, well on ranked there is also a shit ton of teamkilling, a huge example are those groups of circlejerking little faggots that teamkill you at the start of every match one after the other so noone gets banned
---
You sound like an entitled brat. After seeing such an amazing Year 4 roadmap with so many much-needed changes, how can anyone with a sane mind say they give us “less content” this year? You’re still getting 8 operators, a revamped ranked mode and 3 reworked maps that could easily be as good as new maps. The year 4 map clearly shows that they know what they’re doing, shifting resources from creating new maps to much more important aspects of the game. Saying maps = content is just as narrow-minded as can be. 
---
How do you get this? Or do you just buy it with R6 Credits?
---
I already main lesion so I guess I'll be going for this character
---
The long hallways would be heaven for LMGs

Rip, id recommend the game, super fun once you get into it

Maybe. Would be a nice touch

By choice? Lots of smurfs down there.. Some of my friends did it before SI. They prefered the ranked rules, but hated the sweetness or plat/gold.

They said he was from the Secret Service

They were itching for a war and you know it. Just look at the Moroccan crises. It wasn't just them but they were happy to give Austin Hungary whatever they wanted if it meant Germany gained land.
---
im fucking done with this game /s
---
Yeah but pick and ban ≠ no killcams?
---
That straight up looks like the wrong character model. The thumbs look so much shorter and thicker 
---
Wasn't there 4 seasonal skins this season?
---
Sometimes there is a glitch with the kill feed where it doesn’t register what actually killed the player, so the skill is a stand in for a generic death icon. 
---
How come you get impact kills and I only get hit markers 
---
No
---
Yea he has hollow point onions that make the person shot bleed 10 health unless taken off 
---
Im confused? 
---
Are you referring to the Goc or the foundation? 
---
If anything we need more Americans 
---
And you’re probably a blitz main 🤮
---
If it does come back around you don’t have to own the game to get it. When it was first available I got it, I download everything available on twitch prime even if I don’t have the game. 
---
This weekend I got the game and it was waiting for me along with three other sets.

Just an FYI.

I made it upside down so many and eu people can see it

And she doesn't have grenades anymore so what the point of banning a operator that only has guns? I main her I would know how useless to others she can be. And it doesn't mean anything when Lesion seems to have a endless amount of mines.
---
I actually really REALLY want this
---
What's the title music ? Better have a digeridoo.
---
You are correct i just looked it up
---
Base ops aren't going to be free anymore in y4 according to some folks (seeking confirmation), so recruit will be back and should be in all game modes. If the remove No Ban then they might as well add a ban option for recruit
---
They are a perfect pair IMO
---
I main Bandito on defense, he'll eventually get one hopefully he's the next op to receive it. With that said I main Hibana on attack so I'm incredibly happy
---
Cool fidget spinner. 
---
Nope. September through November I think is when it was active. 
---
Yeah it’s having its invitationals this weekend as well
---
Who hurt you?
---
The test servers should open up tomorrow I believe
---
Looks like male IQ wearing Blitz's shield as a vest and using Monty's shield
---
We are 4 years in and we still don’t know what mobility is
---
how do ppl do those
---
Except Bandit has useful guns and isn't an anchor... unless Kaids guns recieved a buff that I didn't hear about. I'm just coming back after a short break.
---
Why T.A.G. first off? The SASR is much more common. Second, Gridlocks icon is her gadget. 
---
Ok
---
I noticed, but whenever I searched up to see if anybody else was posting about it I couldn’t find anything... because nobody noticed, so I thought I was seeing shit
---
We wuz vikangz n shiet
---
Pure Luck 
---
holy shit you really dont understand how this works. a rework is a fundamental change to the gadget of the operator, positive or negative. those are reworks to operators that were OP as shit, meaning that their reworks would bring them in line with how they should be. Frost is going to be changed in a way that’ll benefit her, theyre completely different cases. the ash ACOG is a step in the right direction to nerfing an already overpowered operator. i can’t believe you think that a rework/nerf towards two completely broken ops is a bad thing
---
They need to do Israel operators
---
Not gonna help after the patch tho, kind sucks 
---
Worthless comment
---
(x2 I guess)
---
They mentioned secret agency or intel services so I’d say maybe CIA.
---
Do people still play bad company on pc?
---
Create a group. Then invite group to game 
---
Why is clash wearing ela's gear?
---
Git gud 
---
unless they did some sneaky changes i tried it in a custom and it just bounces off. here hoping
---
Skyscraper is fine Though 
---
Because then he'd just do the operators' jobs for them.  Need a woman or nerd so it makes sense the leader doesn't go on missions. 
---
I mean sure... Or you could use the done hole.
---
Lol yea sad his mp5 got nerfed 
---
Really? The bans were much more diverse for me. First of all, some teams actually banned the weakest operators: Clash &amp; Tachanka, effectively being almost equal to a No Ban. I saw Montagne being banned a lot... Furthermore, it proved super super popular to ban operators such as Echo &amp; Mira. Lion was only banned in a couple of my games, in the big majority he was not banned. Blitz was indeed banned almost every match, I have to give you that. Banning caveira was popular, but not every time. Caveira was actually one of those operators that was "requested" to be played by some people, and therefore not banned. So caveira can get some play, if for example the first team to ban a defender chooses to ban a different defender such as Doc (banning doc proved to be quite popular). If then on the second team, someone asks "I want Cav for myself", they can ban a different defender such as Rook, Mira or Echo.
---
How long the operators have been out. Y1 S1-S4 are cheaper than Y2 S1-S4 and so forth. 
---
I think I'm gonna cry.
---
Quick question did you ever get your charm from going to the first invitational?
---
Easier solution is to use mav to bait the trick and kill him with the claymore
---
I had no idea
---
New computer wallpaper for sure
---
Lol is the invisibility glitch back for a 3rd time?
---
I switched recently as well and I’m enjoying the experience but I have to grind for operators. 
---
U.S has multiple CTU’s FBI SWAT, Navy Seals, Delta Force and the new op is supposed to be secret service I guess
---
I really hope SSG makes it to the grand finals next year as they were the only team to push G2 to the limit.
---
Massive congrats to G2 for winning and that performance from kantoraketti was incredible!
---
I think she’s better as a defender anyways. 
---
I think it fits for the highest rank. Like Overwatch's "Top 500" that represents the 500 most efficient players in the region.
---
It reminds me of [this training video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEEEy1dMceI)
---
Suits Egypt with the abandoned building theme. They’re everywhere.
---
It’s pretty old lol
---
Yea it did like 31 damage before but now it does like 26 
---
ZULUL 
---
yes that was a little agressive. my apologies 
---
If you look in dokis locker in the trailer you can see her invitational headgear. Its just the beanie but still cool.
---
I was exhausted watching that match haha, I can't imagine how the players felt. I don't think i've been on the edge of my seat more than that game.
---
I still for the life of me can’t figure out how ThinkingNade puts his headphones on.  Just google a picture of the dude, and they can’t fit his face and all his hair in the same photo.
---
Im sorry I forgot to put that I play on PS4 :\
---
Gridlock nerf is not a bad idea, so we need to play her first to see if she needs it (I think she needs her number cut down) but the mozzie one is just plain bad and unnecessary.
---
I mean no offense at all (apologies if I did), but given the minimal data we have and how mozzie doesn't "look" overpowered, that one doesn't looks appealing or unnecessary.
---
Double tap l3/r3?
---
That is a bad idea because without a teammate dying you have a glorified recruit and an operator shouldn't be based on how well he can do when his team is dead

---
I always to be way more barbaric about it and use Ash, now that her R4-C won't have an ACOG anymore though. 
---
People were annoyed because (much like the mags on the MP5) the beige-yellow colour would fuck with the Aesthetics of a lot of skins, so having black as an option looks better with a lot of guns
---
I believe he meant a season with operator from two different nationalities.. 
---
Side note, I think his gadget could function in a way similar to thatcher, you toss a “motion sensor grenade” into a room that briefly scans the area(maybe 10-15) meters, or another idea I saw in a comment to where he has to manually move his drone to the area that is to be scanned(if you made this comment let me know and I’ll gladly tag you)
---
Yeah, Gridlock is gonna get nerfed so hard before launch. She will be a planting god, especially with smokes.
---
I remember getting a code for R6 credits. I was with two people who didn’t play and I remember losing some codes and I can’t remember if I cached them or not or if I lost all of them. Well rip

Seeking sources as I'm skeptical too, just somethin I heard thru the grapevine earlier
---
What about the other global abilities like Dokkaebi and Finka?
---
Yikes, darn those *chat hacks*
---
oh i didnt know my bad
---
That’s so specific... where are you from that specifically Canada and Brazil (wot??) won’t let you in? 
---
Also I may be remembering incorrectly, but I think there’s at least one event in the US next season, and apply well in advance if you think Europe takes a long time. 
---
I still can’t get over the weirdness of Canada and Brazil though. 
---
I did when I played new season at invitational 
---
Ladies and gentlemen I give you the revival of siege
---
Not that it bothers me, but Team Rainbow right now is basically 
---
**THUG THUG THUG US FORCES OPEN UP!**
---
Another side note does anyone know if the new ranked rework(pick and ban system) is going to remain 1 round attack and 1 round defense or 3 round attack 3 round defense
---
This man is Maestro incarnate.
---
It happens to us all!!

---
thank so much
---
Play through a headset not your speakers.
---
the supernova is shit though
---
I feel like a buff would be super simple on him. Would love for them to do it, he's a good op his barricades just have way too many easy counters. 
---
This video taken in alone in a custom match.
---
Because an 8th american operator is far more financially rewarded?
---
I did when I played the map
---
No, the discount will get better with the new pricing, the new pricing scheme is that if an operator is over 3 years old they're worth 10,000, if they're 2-3 years old they're worth 15,000, if they're 1-2 years old they're worth 20,000, and less than a year old it's the current price scheme
---
This isn’t amazing 
---
Idk I don’t  I like it 
---
It definitely makes sense though. It says in her bio that she practices archery.
---
I definitely agree with you on this, moreso Dokkaebi than Finka simply because Finka’s ability only affects your team rather than your opponents like Lion and Dokkaebi(don’t get me wrong the three of them could all stand to be changed)
---
They would need to switch the guns tho, Kaid’s AUG isn’t good enough to be an attacker weapon
---
Start of year 4 
---
Because a Fuze could hockey puck a room while blitz, ash and ying run in, killing everybody, all while Finka boosted and Finka is spraying her cyka-blyat LMG.
---
Friendly fire is what keeps siege from being more toxic than it already is.
---
This is the worst idea ever and i am thankful you are not a siege dev
---
Idk I kinda like it 
---
GBP are obviously good boy points anon
---
Yeah but you don't get cool style points doing that
---
That Buck skin looks amazing. And is that charm new too? Looks really cool
---
who’s Mike?
---
They said 3 weeks
---
I'm Gonna shamelessly use this opportunity to post some weeb shit, plz don't hurt me.

That weekend thing is what I hate more than anything. Like I haven’t managed to get this week’s done cause I’m out of town. Stopped at 7/15 headshots. I have my computer with me but there’s so much other shit to do I don’t really wanna sit and grind headshots...
---
source?
---
But that rank is ruffffff bro 
---
Ya only took em 4 years to change the color. Hats off to ubisoft for this hard work
---
That has nothing to do with the quality of the animation? 
---
When did you buy the game?
---
 
---
If it was within the last month or so yeah you'll still unlock all the operators released until now and the season pass.
---
If it was brought in the last year you'll get all the operators currently out but not the year 4 season pass. 
---
That is the most illogical yet the most beautiful elite I've seen in this game.
---
DEFINITELY better than yoga pants elite.
---
His cats making the same pose as the cat on maestros lap m8 
---
That’s not a hack my guy...
---
Can someone explain the backstory to me? I didn't read the books or play previous games and I'm really confused
---
EA execs are a bunch of greedy cockwits.
---
There
---
Doubt it cause the first gun is Buck and the Holo looks the same as the other two. 
---
Might wanna take a look in the mirror there bud....
---
So I didn't end up getting a response, but in case google leads anyone here, no, it doesn't work. Steam will disallow you from launching the game once the trial period ends
---
You live in my dream state

---
He'll be fine.
---
Dok looks fab anyways.
---
pretty sure theyre making it so certain ranks can only play with other certain ranks
---
I know right so weird.
---
they should lock casual for those who're ranked
---
Your system assumes that all point losses are mal-intended and should count against a player. Ubi’s system completely ignores those instances and then will punish you for any further action.
---
I’m relatively new and am just now at level 50 starting to figure out some gadget interactions, mainly the electroclaw, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thrown one onto some barbed wire that’s touching a mute jammer. Really I think your system would be harmful to new players trying to get into the game. Already having vote to kick and adding this system I think are great steps into the right direction, though I don’t think this will be the final solution. 
---
Wait, that’s illegal 
---
It appears as though they've removed the "Drops enabled!" thing now. It was up for about 2-3 hours I'd say so hopefully it was counting that whole time to give people a little better chance to get higher charms.
---
No.
---
It's just expanding the universe, giving more detail.
---
And of course, the fourth one is locked behind the event loot packs
---
Looks Canadian as fuck!
---
Fuck u this doesn't help
---
😂 Nah bro that's stupid. We also like not to try hard 
---
Rip attackers.
---
Thats amazing!! Go seige!
---
I really hope this is a troll post. There are already plenty of maps, and improving maps is much more important than making more. They have made like 3 good DLC maps ever. 
---
I believe it was mentioned in the stream. But passed that idk
---
Okay I know y’all are saying No, but hear me out... 
---
Pretty please with sugar on top?
---
Definitely gonna be having plasma pink on their guns.
---
I'm guessing the Aug looks fab with the pink.
---
That's odd. These are all attackers yet they seem to be defending their virginity.
---
Thx
---
I mean, Twitch, Valkyrie and Ash have decent Elites. Ash might be stretching it but it's still a lot better than *IQ's...* 
---
Oh look, a 12 year old that thinks he's smarter than he is. Never seen one of those before. I wasn't offended at all, you just come across as an idiot. Every comment since has done nothing but prove that.
---
Communication is usually tame but like every multi game some people don't like when you do something they don't like. But it's gets more complicated, learn callouts is all I can say.
---
Yes. 8 operators a week early and free (by which I mean no in game currency but you could use real money), 2 more challenge slots, 10% off in the shop, 3% more to alpha packs, universal gun skin, exclusive outfit to each operator that comes out in the year, 600 r6 credits Which is like 5 bucks I think, probably way less maybe 3.
---
Very different, learn the current meta, learn callouts, use drones 70% of the time, learn maps and she really you can get killed from, use communication. 
---
i loved it 
---
I'm honestly really eager to see those last two Operators. I'm excited for *all of it*, of course, but I'm really curious for the last two Operators. An Indian Operator (which is awesome enough on its own) and a ***Kenyan*** Operator...? I've always been curious about how they'd add in African special forces units (if any), so that's really got the gears turning in my head as to what forces they're affiliated with, what their gadget would be and how they would interact with other Operators and such.
---
So...they just wanted to play casual?
---
Nope simple because it would be too much for ubi cgi trailers are one thing but an movie with cgi? Bye bye 440mio from last year lul 
---
The polish season would've been still with two female operators, regardless of operation health, though.
---
I was literally thinking about this...
---
\+10
---
That's kind of what I mean, for the few people who play recruit it would be rad to see his appeareance match the CTU.
---
Bruh the Bushido set is dope
---
lol I thought u meant for a phone at first. Idk tho sorry.
---
This could very well be the dumbest thing I've ever seen on the main sub. Good job. 
---
I hope Tachanka has rocket launchers added to his turret 
---
She can get it 
---
Takes time sometimes. Took an hour for my r6 credits once
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
---
Or just fire the bolt through the drone? Way easier
---
They are there but not popular
---
Dokkaebi’s stomach &gt; Game breaking glitches
---
Caveira but as attacker 
---
But im not crazy right? It kinda looks like a shrimp
---
It's because you were playing Road To S.I.
---
That game mode forces the S.I. skins on the operators that have them to help promote the packs and show off the skins.
---
With the new operation in 3 weeks
---
stop posting these. 
---
I still want irish ops :(. You partially lied to me Gordon Ramsey
---
You're so touchy aren't you little baby? I made a joke about your sarcasm and now you're acting like a toddler with a shitty diaper. Go check your pants big boy, you're just a pissy little child. 
---
Poisoned spears... 
---
P.s. I don't really know much about Kenya. Can someone familiar with country shed the light of what you expecting?
---
I mean, kinda, but the dude has a bike helmet on, it's obviously his helmet lmao
---
Oh thanks, I thought I had encountered some kind of bug.
---
They could’ve been playing customs and his friend asked him to wait cause he had to go afk.
---
Can't thank them for the ACOG removal, it's already more annoying to play against Ash holy crap. People have already switched to holo.
---
“Le Rocuu!!!” 
---
Monty’s shield fully extends
---
“I can keep my shield extended for 5 whole seconds”
---
 30 seconds later
---
“One second has passed”
---
No it is most definitely a s h r i m p. I see it now but still....
---
True.
---
What’s wrong with nomad?
---
There is no point adding more maps when half the players I meet in ranked don't even know villa fully.

Although I agree that it might be a little too strong, we should still look at the weaknesses. Any explosion will still destroy it. Can't really do that with a Black Mirror unless it's on a soft wall and even then i'd imagine that'd just be a waste of utility. 
---
Why did you link this user in your comment?
---
Lucky.  At least that gun's good.  Plus I'm an IQ/Glaz main sooo....
---
I want that.  Badly.  Really badly.  Lol
---
Lol
---
Wait what? Do you have a link to the video or where ever this is from?
---
Not even that good retard
---
I don't... Only black Ice I have is the R4C &gt;.&gt; And I got it literally after clutching a match with the G36... gdi Gubi
---
Not necessarily. That’s a fair assumption to make seeing these circumstances.
---
It was pretty obvious
---
Fucking nigger
---
I think you mean flat chest..... oh wrong sub lul 
---
...and better speed, hitbox, and attachments.
---
The freezer strat lmao
---
They’re not out yet
---
I don't think anyone is saying this tactic doesn't work or that it's "really hard" It's just... There's a much easier way to get the same result. 
---
Take this, for example:
---
You're playing Siege, and someone comes into your room to ask you about something. Do you open the pause menu,  in the middle of a match, go to "Audio Options" go to "Master Volume" And move the slider all the way to zero?... Or do you mute your speaker? Neither are difficult. One's just a lot more tedious and time consuming.
---
My main issue is theme park not being the first rework to happen since that’s the map I end up on half the time 
---
[It's kyudoka shit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Japanese_archers.jpg)

I have the same thing

.  
---
Would recommend to not and to help pretend you’re on defense 
---
"NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHING"
---
Get over it
---
Don’t down yourself. Playing ranked is the best way to train yourself in the game. You can learn more callouts, gun skill, game sense and maps. You’ll get ranked with your rank most of the time anyway. No one is perfect off the start friend &lt;3 start getting the practice in now before burnt horizon officially releases since this season is ending really soon :) good luck 
---
Not clutch if your entire team is still alive
---
EXACTLY.
---
Recruit is trash, else he'd be used in pro league regular play.
---
God wish that i were me
---
In ranked mind you
---
l
---
Most probably this isnt the final texture cuz it looks bland and low quality.
---
Not even 1/35th of the playerbase. 
---
You're pathetic.
---
Visit with your grandpa. 
---
I feel sorry for you
---
Okay hunny, you know what I mean.

He’d get +10 points for Youtube Rivalry when he kills the Indian op

Dont defend your self, just let it happen and get on with another match.
---
ABSOLUTE UNIT
---
tomorrow morning? that's a bit soon, seeing as the gameplay trailer just dropped
---
60 minute ban? You’ve been “defending” yourself a lot then
---
the only ones that make sense are ash’s, pulse’s, and smoke’s.
---
I remember when Dokkaebi came out, her gloves also covered her thumbs. Then I think in Year 3 they changed it so that the gloves were not a part of the thumbs anymore. But they forgot to correctly texture her thumbs because they still had the white circle design of her gloves but on her skin of the thumbs and that made it look really weird
---
Dunno, just something i heard, guess well have to see
---
Really dude, don't
---
I reported the guy. He won't be bothering you anymore... but you should feel ashamed. But it's not like you can't become not better at the game, I tried, I failed many times to be worse than a new player
---
That’s awesome 
---
imo 144hz monitors are bit of a snake oil. Pretty unnecessary unless you're trying to go pro 
---
Fucking Bandit.
---
Really? Wonder if they recorded everything on that so our boys in China could watch. 
---
On Pc too
---
Recently the devs have really been fucking up stuff that doesn't need changing. I don't even agree with map changes that don't need them. And now that Ash and Glaz got nerfed I prolly won't touch the game anymore. Not that I play it anymore anyway, I really got burned out and I haven't touched the game for months.
---
Tasmanian’s are off brand Australians.
---
I guess we will
---
There's toxicity in every multiplayer game on every platform mate it's not even worth complaining about one game.
---
There are new running and moving animations from the gameplays ive seen.
---
Wait what?
---
What do you mean by it doesn't work? It zooms in quicker like it's supposed to just fine for me.
---
She looks different. I wonder if they're going to go down the same path as Frost and change her in game model to match the elite?
---
There is when it's obviously poorly moderated or could be regulated. For god's sake the game insists you bait the hostage but killing the hostage gets you auto banned. Its trash
---
I think I'm trash......
---
That's artifacting, most likely from the GPU. What GPU do you have? Have you overclocked it?
---
Exactly, but I should still be able to win a gunfight with angled grip... Bullets go straight through defenders lalbs
---
[This was from the new video Ubi uploaded.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DzqL_1EVsAAZja5.jpg:large)
---
She looks like a mall cop, not someone in the SASR.
---
It's a Lithgow F90. It's an Aussie firearm loosely based on the AUG
---
How’d you get that flair :(
---
Where is your evidence? You are basing this off nothing but pure guess work
---
Thank you for the pointers, I’m definitely most concerned with making sure I use her in a logical place lol. I don’t think I’ve ever played a hard breacher in general so it’ll be a cool change of pace! 
---
This is beyond science
---
Well they also add the new newcomer mode where you can learn to play Bomb on 3 maps like Ranked until lv15
---
She has a big body due to a bigger bone mass board shoulders  she big because she grew up on a farm she is fat or some shit she is built tough strong like a fucking wall she is buff mother fucking Aussie cowgirl
---
Not that I’ve seen yet!

Thought it was Eric and Damien, not Roman? 
---
You have my support 
---
It is a vega 64 but I am playing other games (RE2) just fine
---
5h
---
Haha, I'm not being touchy mate. Re read my comment, I'm just exasperated as we're going around in circles over the same topic. Have a good one 
---
Can't you just shoot a fire bolt through the drone hole right next to the garage door? I've managed to deny bandit trick with this before. 
---
Should have been enough for copper and bronze
---
Lol that’s awesome
---
Whatever you say, m8.
---
No the skins come out every  season and u only have the duration of that season to buy them then u can’t buy them anymore, once you do they are yours forever and u can use them on every operator prior to the season the skin came out for example I can use the wind bastion skins on every operator but once these new ones come out I can’t place them on their guns seasonal skins never go away they are just limited time purchasable universal skins
---
With 7 alpha packs. This the the luckiest person in the world 
---
Swear to tachanka if we get fucking another american op or operators from uganda or some shit first ima be salty. We are going to have 8 americans, 4 from fbi, 2 from navy, 1 from gstrs or whatever it's called, and the y4s2 secret service
---
Does everyone get to play the new ops if you go to the invitational?
---
Are you mad because she would body slam you like a twig 
---
Do you have a picture of them?
---
I actually like the idea of not doing a straight adaption of R6, but rather looking at how Rainbow would operate 20 years in the future
---
No you're just an asshole who downvoted the original post to defend a fault that even they admit exists according to the only good answer I was given so far. Which honestly answered it. I just need to come back later. MAYBE
---
Oof I misread that
---
Good point, just a highlighting of that section
---
Yea there’s a pretty big lineup but you can play the ops on the first and second days. You can’t play after the reveal though. 
---
Try a different monitor, maybe even try Integrated graphics. 
---
* reads comments *
---
* sees name *
---
If you have 4 other guys to play recruit with then yes 
---
I can understand that we have way too many OPs from the US but why are you mad about countries like Uganda??? I mean if a country has a viable CTU then I say that's all good to be a part of Team Rainbow, no?
---
As well as the new ACOG style scope and even more new holographic sights. In bikinibodhis newest video you can see the ACOG on Gridlock and Capitao, and the Holo on Mozzie. Not enough people are talking about this!! 
---
I should've worded that comment much better.  
---
"Fuze's gadget isn't sufficient for those jobs in a professional level of play." would've been better wording
---
Because it's a video game and they've strayed from accurate military personnel depictions in the past and just care about making a character who fits the gadget and build an interesting backstory from it 4head
---
Political reasons more than likely 
---
Like Kaid and Bandit.  
---
Ubisoft is soo careful about Powercreeping. Try to hide that stupid drone in a high spot or outside. Doesn’t work? Guess who can ;)
---
I'm 16, and my entire fathers side has never been able to grow a bear at all, like absolutely no hair other than like fuzz, not sure if thats really lucky or unlucky
---
Oi m8 we have emus to fight aright so fuck off
---
Hey I haven’t read much about it yet, what’s the reverse damage system?
---
I guess they don’t allow phones or whatever
---
;)
---
So Basically if Streamers who tend to screaming or raging things of that kind, get Wallbanged or really unlucky deaths, they often break their Headset and stuff. 
---
I'm not mad at uganda. I'm just saying that they are very unlikely to be added before a more well known country like ireland, or Puerto Rico. 
---
I remember when a Valkyrie was shown in the Cosplay line ups, that chat went pretty fucking disgusting.
---
:)
---
Xbox gang Xbox gang
---
*this post was made by the Xbox gang*
---
Why did a microwave kill you? Did you insult it?
---
She isn’t fat tho 
---
Yeah I keep chat hidden at all times. I ain’t dealing with that stuff.
---
That's... what a reference is though? Like I'm not going against the fact that they could be in the same universe but the Villa references are there because of the location.
---
Same thing here comrade..! 
---
I can understand that
---
nah got scared and fat fingered my melee
---
Oh that's bad. That's really bad. I hope this is just the early planning stage, because that's awful.
---
Part of the reason why I don’t play ranked lol
---
You do realize that Puerto Rico is a territory of the US which means if Puerto Rico added it's own CTU to Team Rainbow (if it even has one? I have no clue) then that would technically mean adding more US operators.
---
We've been trying to distance ourselves from them for years, stop bringing them back up
---
*Blows up self
---
Lol my recoil on that is always disgusting 
---
And china. Technically we have lesion and ying but Hong Kong separated from China soo...
---
Hm and I would have said March 5th... 
---
See this is why I don't play r6 anymore 
---
Something about tk dmg being inflicted back onto tk'er
---
Basically when you TK someone, you will be warned that the Reverse Damage system has turned on for the ENTIRE match. If you start shooting another team mate, you yourself will take that damage. Which means if you head shot another person, you will instantly die.
---
Oh nice so my buddy just can’t read? Thanks for clearing this up
---
Imagine caring this much about what flag a fictional character has on his shoulder in a video game based around an American franchise.
---
 "B-b-b-but muh diversity"..... jfc give me a break....
---
Yeah but how many people have explosives? And a Jager will reduce those numbers too. Im not saying its OP but its also a normal gadget, not an operator ability. It just seems unneeded. Making it work better with placing and attaching to doors seems fine. Why does it in need a mira window too for peeking?
---
Np! Lemme know if u need anything else! 
---
Not just that but I counted but theres only 22 ops there not 23 which means its counting mozzie (or gridlock) and not showing them
---
Also I have been playing the game fine up until  the most recent update 
---
Yes. They do follow under the US and are considered us citizens but are not Americans. They are Puerto ricans, it's like Hong kong.
---
"He is a Hammer, and i am the Nail!" **NUT**
---
I play quite a bit of capitao (love using the smoke bolts for the smoke plant). Now that I know the "arrows" can go through bullet holes I kinda want to try to meme on people.
---
Seriously, this. Tachanka is literally the opposite of almost everything you want in an operator. Any change that makes him a viable Op is going to change him so much you might as well just make a new Operator. There'd be no point in calling him the same Operator. That means the options are a rework that *still doesn't make him viable to play* or a change so heavy that he's literally just a different Op.
---
People need to stop calling for this if they really want Tachanka to still be in the game
---
I went to the invitational, and I have the vip weapon skin, the charm, and all twitch drops for sale. If your interested 
---
Huh. That scope sight on the M249 looks crazy good.
---
Have you verified file integrity?
---
Did you ace it though?
---
Ok yeah that’s really dumb, they should do this as a thing instead of like, the ban system where if you get a TK “ban” instead of being banned it’s turned on for that long, that way people thay get banned via accidental TKs have no problem playing and those who it wasn’t an accident will just find the game impossible to play, maybe have the bans if they keep killing in this mode 
---
It's new, exclusive to the Australians
---
Its the initational pack uniform. 
---
These are all bandaid solutions. If that's an issue then the game should auto kick, re-queue, or...god forbid, fix the core issue. 
---
Turkey and Greece will never work together sorry
---
Read retard
---
Oops
---
Oh hahaha I misunderstood that. Thanks for clearing that out ^^.
---
i honestly hope she does, with gridlock on attack their combo is too much.
---
she always seemed better off as a defender.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/382216580?t=01h09m43s
---
A lot of characters lost Shield's to Bulletproof cams as well Shield's are very uncommon and it's almost always better to run barb or impacts even if Shield's could be this strong
---
Nope Clash has a CZ. The Micro RONI, however is basically just a modified Glock. It’s literally just an exoskeleton that adds a grip and stock and a PDW shape to the Glock
---
Ah you were lesion im stupid lol
---
You know I was thinking the shield when I started making it but couldn’t find any good PNGs of just the shield so I did the gun
---
I wonder how high in the door it is
---
He has "Mozzie" on the back of his helmet 
---
True, but at least the G36 is a good fun.  I almost never use Smoke and the shotgun is much better  if it was the shotgun I wouldn’t be as mad lol, cuz at least then I could use it with mute and I think Thatcher, too
---
Then I think you used smurfing wrong in the title because smurfing is when someone usually in plat or diamond who’s really good and doesn’t need to learn a lot more gets a new account just to play with bad people so either you used smurfing wrong because you are actually are just getting a new account for whatever reason and continuing t learn or you’re lying.
---
Can I get the link to the part
---
For me i bought 2 passes in the past and truly its not(personally) if i remember thats $30 only to have them a week early and between the team trying to pick them as quick as possible and people team killing when they aren’t quick enough its not worth it. Also if you play consistently you probably can just buy them after the week lol i rarely play anymore and my account sits at ~90k renown (think thats the word) nonetheless its not too hard to farm up
---
Oh yeah and i think it gives you some extra mediocre cosmetics? Trust no one is gunna stop and look, you’re better off investing it in another game you enjoy 
---
Let’s be honest here, of course G2 won.
---
Yes! Buy it now so you don't miss out on the lava skin.
---
It doesn't always hit there.
---
But now, with the AOE buff, you can.
---
Its 2019 right?
---
Flawless.
---
Thank you. You the man!
---
Thank you (:
---
Ok thanks
---
They do indeed have platform specific recoil values, and pim pretty sure that's it. Recoil in general is lower on console to compensate for the difficulty of controlling high recoil weapons. After watching a video on console Kaid it honestly almost looks like they just mistakenly put the same recoil values on both console and PC. 
---
You can’t hurt friendlies if you’ve already killed someone?
---
Yeah I only put smurfing since it's a really low acount, it's only lvl 8 right know and my mains only 80.
---
I’m assuming you need the y4 season pass to play new ops 
---
He's sending it through a bullet hole, not through the wall.
---
Are you positive that's going to work, I will need to add another 12$ and I'm a bit worried.
---
Yo who one empire or g2???
---
Then what reason would you have to lower you account level and start over
---
Why not?
---
They are.nerfing fire penetration through solid, not the bullet hole passageway.
---
I mean I could get behind the forgive system if maybe you instead if you don’t forgive them, then it uses the stupid self damage thing, if they put you to under 50, and it doesn’t count as a teamkil
---
Because it's true. A shooting range doesn't help learning new maps and ops. It's just for testing guns.
---
They did facial art rework of Hibana. So, they may change her in game model too.
---
His issue is that the clusters are RNG, something competitive players will avoid if possible. 
---
except in glazs case he can still move, he just loses a bit of his ability. its about playing a sniper role, not about inhibiting mobility. he can still easily reposition unlike tachanka
---
He's the 9th highest, not even top 5 now.
---
It put it in the post I'm litterly only doing it as a meme by only playing recruit
---
no
---
Naw it’s purely an aesthetic thing, although I guess it could help dark operators like Vigil blend in even more 
---
THEY WON ANYWAY 
---
somewhere for pengu to sit
---
Well fuck me then 😢
---
Ya, I’ve tried to use his shotgun but i usually get melted before the gun recenters. It’s not unusable if you use a reflex or holo sight but there’s no point in using his shotgun without an acog
---
&gt; No spawn peek possibilities
---
The community *will* find a way
---
*laughs in shield recruit*
---
M870 only makes it balanced
---
Should add your screenshot of that post you said and then added it after 
---
He got like 100k people 😂👌
---
personal preferamce, i totally getcha. but its not really possible to keep the old layout when there are gonna be so many operators 
---
He retired, she retired, now it's this young dude who likes technology so much that he recruited lion.
---
Oops.
---
I guess you do you but that seems like a total waste of money when you can just play recruit when you feel like it on your main
---
She was my main before they removed her claymore : ( 
---
I had to switch to thermite.
---
Ubisoft is french 
---
Wow you guess correctly a 1/5 chance how crazy
---
It’s great you link the Wikipedia article, had you actually read it, you would see that the Minimi is a SAW.
---
monday on TTS, 2-ish weeks later on live
---
u/UbiNoty 
---
This could get poopy real fast
---
Okay...? Not as if it was a one to million odds buddy.
---
it is if you accidently tk twice in a match
---
I'm on ps4 I only had to make a second email and could play plus if i played on my main it wouldn't have the same feel since my objective is to have an account where all the stats are on recruit only
---
*Blitz leaps off cliff*
---
Favorite attacker is Montagne because I really like his shield
---
Favorite defender is Tachanka because his turret is fun to use.
---
Ok then
---
Smoke's fmg-9 ia essentially a glock.
---
Literally, kinda annoyed about this. They're gonna nerf Lion just for him to be banned from every ranked match lmao
---
I run the cosmetics on about 75% of DLC operators.  I think it is worth it, plus the R6 Cash and ability to spend that renown on cosmetics and skins because you don’t have to pay for the operators (they are unlocked a week early because of the pass).  I have bought all 4 season passes.
---
shitposts get worse nowadays really
---
OML
---
Why should the other player be punished for your mistakes?
---
Nice
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
*YING*
---
buddy did you watch the panel? they said they want to make theme park LESS confuzing and that the Kanal and Kafe changes are mostly interior
---
Well, I don't know. Shield is great for sure but the headgear is a bit much and looks ugly without a matching uniform.
---
No need to be rude...
---
And he didn't say they didn't tell us, he just said that nobody was mentioning it.
---
Interesting. I don't favorite either of them.
---
It's just the default skin that looks horrible with it, I saw other gameplays with better compression and it looks awesome with skins
---
What about Castle’s rework? I mean, for casual audience, he is the same as Chanka. Just picked a bit more......
---
Nice, want a cookie?
---
So the reverse Team Damage sanction only happens after the first TK. The question is how long does it last?
---
A group of 4 people can effectively TK the same person once per round and that person can't do anything other than maybe kill 1 person. Saw this on stream yesterday.
---
The reverse is true, damaging each person enough so that you are doing more than 1 TK worth of damage as one person.
---
Honestly this TK reverse damage rule doesn't do shit for intentional TKs because the reflective option isn't there from the start. It only stops the 2nd TK, which effectively does the SAME thing as the current ruleset does, which is kick you after the 2nd TK. You still remove 3 people from the game this way. 
---
Sure the reflective thing might persist after the match into the next game, but essentially you're still allowing the toxic person to effectively get away with it for that game session.
---
The only positive I see aside from having the reflect damage thing exist (something counterstrike has had for a long long time) is the ability to forgive teammates.  Still, the new rules doesn't stop anyone from:
---
1. Killing one person intentionally
---
2. Wounding multiple people intentionally
---
3. Taking 2 people out + yourself to basically make it 2v5
---
4. Punishing intentional TKers severely to actually curb the real pieces of toxic shits that go around TKing for any little thing done to their fragile mental states (stealing their camera destroyed points, or pointing out they are being toxic).
---
sounds like that's an issue you will want to talk to Ubi about, not the players. If a person doesn't want to talk then he shouldnt be forced to talk. Not everyone is playing to win.
---
Pretty much every attacker would be insanely strong because of the weapons and access to acogs. My favorites would be IQ, Nomad, Maverick, Smoke, Mira and Pulse.
---
Light grey? I have bad news for you buddy...
---
Inb4 Hanzo gets a hibana skin 
---
I hit high gold pretty much instantly in siege, You can come from any FPS and as long as you don't play like an ape you'll be above average with basic FPS skill.
---
dk
---
Im that guy but lower level and kd and win loss
---
A forgive system is fine, but you still didn't answer my question. How is it any more fair to let the person who is shot die than to punish the shooter? If it anyone's fault - accidental or not - it's the shooter's.
---
Hey everybody, welcome back to December 2015!
---
I believe it’s due to her always pushing herself, emotionally and physically, to try and overcome all obstacles and prove herself in the eyes of her, now deceased, father though this may be complete bullshit, it’s been a while since I’ve read through her OP Bio.
---
So just the volcano skin? That’s dope thanks man
---
they just said "tomorrow"(18th)
---
but from what i'm hearing people say it usually goes up 9-10am PST
---
[Almost like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcwX3_C2tCo)
---
I normally never get desync or any sort of issue in siege but today I had some really bad desync and even a hacker in casual.
---
We do with who? Maybe I don't play with 5hise operators.....
---
Yes, but it's not intended. 
---
More like September 2015
---
I chuckled at this one, who do you have in mind?
---
Surely not chubby-cheeked Rose?
---
cheers pal 
---
Yeeting a nitro through the big windows
---
It's mentioned on the sticked post
---
Well consider yourself lucky you have it for ash. I got mine for smokes FMG..
---
Right, still enough time to make a rework.
---
happy cake day 
---
Maybe he's throwing games to derank and to mess with some coppers? Y'know, the toxic ones...
---
Welcome to the internet?
---
My friend of having the same issue. I bought him the 40 dollar version on the 11th and when he added it to his account they gave him the version with 0 operators.
---
Its also a dumb opinion.
---
They want it to be dead so they convince themselves that it is...at least that's what it looks like.
---
genji?
---
Well you can't assume genders...
---
No. They're isn't.
---
I heard resetting is only going to be at 20 health now? Is that true?
---
/r/boneappletea
---
I signed him up for a 26 mail order sex magazines
---
Pengu and Kanto are the best together 
---
No it doesn't hard reset. Like most other games, you still have a hidden MMR and the 10 game calibration fine tunes that.
---
Hm?
---
if it's just you reporting the toxic behavior then nothing will ever happen. It only looks when there is a large amount of people reporting the player. As for your experience, you need to ditch casual as soon as possible and play rank. You wont find nearly as much toxicity there.
---
Lets all raid him with pizza
---
Probably means Rey with that grey raggy outfit
---
It’s actually getting a tunnel as well. I’m very excited for this. The second building upstairs looks phenomenal now.
---
Try squaring up with people 
---
oof how dare I not think of the white girl
---
Looks like a minor buff to me.
---
And it's a hard breather, so your pants'll do nothing
---
Never heard of our boy Craig? He's a Ubisoft employee. People tag him in stuff so he can pass it along to the devs (usually with a "sent to the team, thanks!").
---
Not sure he's the one in charge of collecting this stuff anymore though. 
---
Grow up. 
---
I don't get why, it's not like those stats are only for the current season, and by the time you're level 200+ it's hard to change your w/l and k/d
---
Whenever a new operation is about to come out the toxicity spikes
---
Keemstar as blackbeard
---
Yeah, there’s nothing outstanding about it. I just really liked the animation you get with it. 
---
But as an agressive player I will.never play glaz again so the elite skin i got and was.happy about now is 20$ wasted.for.me
---
It's not just about balance and usefulness, but also their ability to shift the meta and the way you play. Before Hibana you only ever had to worry about two entries to site being breached. Turtling was completely viable because you'd always have a safe place to stand. Hibana and maverick both change that.
---
Mira was even more influential IMO, offering defenders the ability to gain information without exposing themselves or relying on destructible cams. Its truly a major game changer.
---
It's better that theyre prioritising overpowered operators first and then useless ones later. I want to see a tachank rework aswel but its better that they fix broken op ops first
---
No, this doesn't belong here.
---
I'm a casual warrior so I feel your pain. Try finding a discord that have good people in it to play with. 
---
Y4 they bring 5 new countrys with only 1 operator.  I think thay atleast bring the second operator for all 5 new countrys
---
Ok 
---
not at all
---
Fair enough ahahaha it’s just for the flex tho like boom you got shot by something made of literal diamond suck it 
---
*jeopardy thinking music intenseifies*
---
kind of an idea, but thats not how siege (mafia pun intended) works
---
All they said on stream was "First half of Year 4".
---
So any point in the next 6 months, and/or Season 1 or 2.
---
I managed to get an X Kairos kill on a guy behind a wall one time, and no it was not free weekend
---
Not castle
---
But after the tk changes, it might work. This guy makes a fair point
---
In Pro League.
---
On defence it's typically an information meta mostly
---
On attack it's typically a very aggressive meta. 
---
Ye lol whenever I’m in a game I’m like of this person has the diamond skin it’s already shocking to see lol 
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
***YOU'RE NOT YOUR YOU MENTALLY IMPAIRED ALABAMA MILK DRINKING RETARDED BRAIN DEAD TIGER PENIS***
---
so Gridlock should only be used for sound cues?
---
yeah he got a point tho
---
Some other time maybe cos these seasonals are so good 
---
Im already level 19 so you are not safe there either soon.
---
Will definitely look at them, thanks.
---
its currently 2 weeks of testing, but after the first season in year 4 they'll increase it to 3 week according to invitations dev panel. 
---
Used to be hibana but kinda finding her shit rn tbh
---
Atk-zofia/buck
---
Def-Lesion
---
Too hard to see, and if isn’t using his drone there no light at all.
---
Trully, incredible.
---
The only thing i wanted a refund for was baseops, but i guess they reverted that
---
Ye or you could buy diamond now since the new season only starts around beginning to
---
Middle of March and they u would have the whole season to get renown for the seasonal skins which is like 3-4 month 
---
With Ranked coming out of Beta and getting Pick and Ban, I have one major question, and if anybody could help provide an answer, it would be greatly appreciated.
---
Will Ranked still have the other game modes or is it transitioning to "Bomb only"?
---
I ask because me and my friends just really enjoy playing Secure Area and we enjoy the Ranked aspect of Siege, but we don't really want to play Bomb.
---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** G2Esports! ^(hug)
---
But, free weekend is over, right?
---
\*an american who has never been to Australia's idea of what Australia is
---
Fuzes win delta is not good but not awful. the maim thing is his 1-3% pick percentage. By making him a 2 speed he will become more flexible and less tedious to play, rising his pick rate (hopefully.) Also, since speed is valued more than armor in siege. this will also result in him getting a buff, helping his -1.0% win delta. due to this, i see this as being the best way to deal with fuze.
---
Who cares tbh
---
Are you new in Siege?
---
Better than my bright yellow crash dummy version
---
“Confirm kill” so you killed a downed player? Okay.
---
Hacking valkyrie cams.
---
well it depends on your definition of being ready for ranked. If u refer to skills then maybe but to knowledge of the game then absolutely not. If both, then also no for a lvl 5 player.
---
That’s not a badger quote lol that’s just a quote 
---
I don't think he's broken to be completely honest. I think Jackal is far worse.
---
She's just thick, don't mind her.
---
*cries in bandito*
---
That's not how you wear a beret my friend
---
Lvl 122 bronze 2. No I’m not new I’m just bad. Was gold 3-4 previous seasons though. I’ve just been doing badly
---
Good for you. Half that made sense
---
And defuser protection.
---
She anyway used for sound cues. Defenders will just destroy it anyway given how easy they are to spot and hear. Anybody who walks into a hallway and gets caught by one of those probably has glaucoma, both IRL and in-game.
---
I got it on the smg-11 after it got nerfed.😭😭😭
---
ruins the immersion for me, its not overwatch
---
im sorry you hate the realistic scenario
---
Kinda funny they have that old video yet the game never took a story based direction
---
Don't play gridlock then, simple as that
---
Damn you sit far away from the screen. Im so bad at playing on anythong but a desk setup.
---
From hindsight, you could reverse this and still make it work
---
This’ll be the only time I will see this 😅
---
It’s just a reskinned ACOG. Guess who also has a ACOG on their LMG? Fucking every operator with a LMG.  
---
Then why is it a nuisance?
---
Where the fuck is Mickey? If there's no Mickey, this shit ain't Disney.
---
This video cooked my brain wth 
---
Oh damn.
---
We've got an issue.
---
She is basically Lion but in one room and able to run in without any skill but throwing her candelas
---
Since when was this game immersive?
---
Nailed it.
---
Its way clearer and more open than a normal acog tho
---
I do not enjoy repeating myself, so I will leave it at this,
---
[\*My reaction to your grammer\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXE7Ez0CXIw)
---
So you are ok with sledge being a towering Thor, but not ok with tank chick being well built?
---
Thanks for not marking as spoiler..
---
Yeah but I think Gridlock will be really good on all gamemodes
---
Bomb-helps planting and guarding the defuser
---
Secure-while securing it closes off entrances so you just wait and listen
---
Hostage-have Grid follow the person that is grabbing the hostage and juat throw the trax behind them
---
And the M249 is going to suck compared to the F90, just like Capitao’s M249 compared to his Para. 
---
Yeah, he asked me who my favorite operator was, then drew Lesion on the poster. Really nice guy.
---
Kaid's is an SMG variant, &amp; neither Mozzie nor Gridlock use an AUG.
---
Me neither
---
I’m guessing the cluster charge damage won’t be changed 
---
The fucking trailer showed the Serbu Super Shorty. 
---
Nobody is fucking surprised. 
---
This might be a stupid idea, anyway, if I remember correctly difficult level doesn't change while playing solo, but does selecting realistic count for the achievement?

I completed it a while ago and it was really hard, I do it solo in the first place but it was too much, then I do it with other casual player and we managed to win it, i think we went on Barlett. If you have the chance to play with friends I suggest you to go with glaz, iq, montagne, thatcher, sledge.
---
From which zone do you play?
---
Kafe needs a rework. But Theme Park? A few lighting fixes and the map is just fine. I think they have lost hope with Tower, it will never become a ranked map and the priority is to fix those. 
---
If you will have unopened packs you will still have it but you wont be able toget them anymore, the was a limited time event.
---
If you just got the game you still get a trailer with her in it tho
---
Can you slap mine too? 
---
For real the G8 is incredibly fun to rush with
---
Skeleton Key
---
Thancc you
---
This was on Ubisofts future roadmap video...
---
That’s a great point. There are some sites where he’s pretty damn good but sadly those are few and far between 
---
Cafe upstairs is cancer.
---
Themepark is cancer
---
Imo, if u leave the gu in for that long it is definitly your fault.
---
No, this would be terrible and I hope we never get senseless gadgets that you can just spam near an enemy for easy kills. This isn't cod or BF
---
You put in Raiders or Marsoc and I'll main them until I die 
---
Aside from the subtle PC elitism in the comments; im happy your both playing siege. Its a wild ride and i love the game. Teach him the ways cause toxicity is always around the corner.
---
Cuz they would need a bigger rework on Tower compared to those 3.
---
I would say it is scheduling issue, she is really popular and busy nowaday. Of course she is expensive AF...
---
Sup rusted clockwork  *beats ass*
---
Because usually you don't step in a gu mine if 3 guns are pointed at you,  however I agree lesion is the most annoying op to play against I want him removed 10/10
---
amateur clanning is dorky lol
---
Most of the games doesnt have dou or solo, especially not ranked. Most of them have 6 or 5 ppls in the group
---
I haven't watched the inbetween ones in a long time but I know they cast in English 
---
And I know it's for proleague only meaning you will enjoy it if  you enjoyed the proleague
---
Oh, yeah that makes sense i guess?
---
His gu is supposed to damage indefinitely dumbass that’s why you get the option of taking it out of your foot
---
Yes.
---
Ayy.
---
Happy cake day...Ok
---
Exactly, where is it?
---
has the new season already been launched ? 
---
yeah, definitely. but people who do that is 100% of the time a newbie, you can't really blame them for not knowing mechanics of the character.
---
this change will only slightly nerfing him since he still does overall 30 damage, you can even argue it will be slightly buff since experience player will risk taking the damage instead of immediately take it out
---
That they do.
---
Team Effort is really strong team, they lack experience, but I think next invitationals we might see something big from them. And Joystick runout on the balcony that almost got him 3k was insane. His game sense is incredible.
---
Probably.
---
Just play cav and ash in low ranks it’s ez elo. When I was bronze a couple of seasons ago I ranked up so much doing that . Now I’m plat
---
Year 1. Valk, Echo, and Hibana are all game changers. Buck, Blackbeard, and Capitao can be extremely influential in the right situation. Cav and Frost are just fun to use.
---
I think it should be if you continuously damage an ally, you take damage.
---
Already a cav main lmao
---
Agreed.
---
Well at least she got asses at the end of her arms 
---
I feel your pain, watching the quarters I was up till like 4.30 am with the alarm going off at 7 ;p
---
Worth it tho
---
Not to mention, it beat out R6's Grand finals while CSGO's was only the Group stages. 
---
For those that don't know:
---
Challenger stage has 16 teams total, bottom 8 from the last major and 8 who qualified. The 8 teams who move on to the group stage, as challengers, will face the 8 legend teams from the last major. Then the remaining 8 will face off until one is the winner. So this was only the first 1/3 of the CSGO major.
---
No, I'm talking about Invitational drops
---
I already own the Steam version
---
Yup, I have the, I think, 5 total free packs for the SI event. Oh, so they're just gonna show as expired like the Outbreak ones but not disappear?
---
Cuz u cant just change something based on community feedback. Otherwise, all "new" ops would have been nerfed immediately after reveal cuz there's always ppl saying "OP".
---
I think that Ubi's problem going forward is communication.  They must have some of the worst online back and forth with the community that I have personally experienced.  Bungie, DICE, even Activision have such expedient responses to fans and online communities.  And I just don't think they are doing themselves any favor in bottling all their responses up for these big reveals.  Lots of us are adults and we would rather just have proper communication than a big wow moment. 
---
I hate your childish language. 
---

---
All of those are my friends and i can assure they are doing this again :DD
---
Toxicity is at every level of play but in my experience it’s gold players that are some of the worst. Two factors play into this, it is the largest bracket of players, that is where most people fight trying to rank up and those who have either knowledge or skill. The other reason is that is where players tend to stagnate at in rank and because of it they care less about trying to push up in rank and just play, these are the players who will want to win until they see somebody on their team isn’t playing up to their standards so THEY don’t deserve a win.
---
Kafe and Theme Park are fine.. That's just lazy they could'nt pick maps out of the ranked map pool to rework?? Y4 is gonna get stale quick.. Thank God Insurgency is out this year
---
Haha yeah:D
---
Good that someone was around to clean up afterwards too.
---
nope 
---
Tts is pc only but If you have a ps4 account and a pc you can still play it on pc
---
Why not just get a 5 man team together
---
Exactly.
---
More bullets to hit the enamy in the noodle(head(
---
Lol damn autocorrect
---
Duh, its obviously a spoon.
---
instead of calling me a dumbass try thinking from a newcomer standpoint.
---
they are too many annoying things in the game to dealing with as it is but right now Ubi is trying to reducing that by nerfing Lion and Dokkaebi.
---
if we want this game to grow it will have to be more friendly and easier for a new player to get in. Lesion nerf would be a step in the right direction
---
what? drops? 
---
Thanks man
---
This have been asked more than twice...
---
Probably just you.
---
Cause gridlock's gadget looks like a Gridlock 
---
HAHAHAHAHHA YES I WAS RIGHT ONE MORE TIME HAHAHAH :D
---
Alexa play anzac national anthem
---
But it's a choice now.
---
Until now, it's the last thing you considered.
---
She got murdered by one of the suicidal terrorist.
---
Historically it’s been the most attacker favoured map in the entire pool. Winning one defence round before the side switch was seen as acceptable while winning two was seen as extremely good (when it was 5 each half). There was however a shift this season towards defence (like with all maps really).
---
You are the type of person to change your favourite team everytime someone else wins something. Knobhead. 
---
Thanks for the advice guys! I appreciate it ;) 
---
March 5th is mostly likely the date that Burnt Horizon starts so Wind Bastion's last day is the 4th.
---
Lmao you sound like you suck the paint off the brushes after using them
---
The attacker is basically a better iq 
---
They just make it better 
---
If you play a lot no. Because you will have more renown than you can use.
---
If you only play an hour a day like me then yes, because time is limited and I get the new guys on day 1. The amount of renown I get, even when I was playing with booster on was really insignificant. 
---
How does blackbeards name for an exampel describe His gadget 
---
Da fuck IQs is lit
---
That would be the most beautiful thing.
---
They should reconsider (also for the future - Croatian and Serbian the same season would be nice).
---
No, it can definitely be stupid and still work
---
The weebs have risen up and must be put back in their place
---
I don't TK often either but it does have a chance of happening. There was one time when two people walked in front of me as I started shooting my DMR. They both died almost instantly and I didn't even get kicked.
---
So, nothing really changes in this situation other than instead of those two dying, the second one wouldn't die and it would just be me.
---
Same here 
---
For real come on look it up in the rainbow six site not Ubi. But really it's not hard i don't need to do the work for you. 
---
I saw that 
---
Opened up a game to see if its possible from above, I think hitting the right capitao bolt is a lot easier because the floor right above the garage door is unbreakable, took some screenshots of it [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/YkHwvE8)        
---
    
---
The possibility to die to a roamer is a lot higher than hitting the right angle imo, especially when playing with randoms who wont keep you safe from those roamers that wanna clap your cheeks
---
I don't think it will be such a big thing like outbreak.
---
Probably more like the road to S.I. Event or the Halloween Event. With Special Skins/Packs and Challenges.
---
**BEGONE *THOT***
---
It actually makes sense - as much as I would prefer any other country.
---
US military is just a beast with a lot of elite troops.
---
It opens some doors for SBS and Formoza. One can hope.
---
Wait did they drop them?
---
The gadget was actually developed to protect his killer beard, not his face.
---
because people kept it to the designated megathread
---
They actually did in Blacklist, and I feel it was the inspiration for Siege.
---
The MVP animation is trash imo. 
---
If you ar going to buy One you listed i should have chosen finka or maestro both are really Good and fun to play
---
It would still kill everyone PLUS Fuze.
---
Nope. Hibana is one of the next.
---
Hello anomalym8, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/arw5rj/season_based_off_tom_clancys_the_division_part_2/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yes, typed p instead of o, pressed ä instead of backspace (next to each other), and then finished the word without noticing
---
Oh yeah, good point. 
---
Oh well, still 4 chances then. Even though, practically speaking, it's more like 2 chances since the MTAR would probably be an Attacker weapon.
---
How about bandit then
---
Exactly so.
---
https://youtu.be/xv8t4AVJ6FE
---
No there's context. She's Angela Bassett AKA highly acclaimed actor and the CGI woman in the picture of this post?
---
 Angela Bassett actually I believe 
---
I feel old 
---
I think its optional 
---
Get Flanked, varsity gaming 
---
You probably started at the best time then. Changes are coming. Good changes. And every year will be better than the last.
---
I'm pretty sure. Once I shot Zofia in the shoulder and she dodged around the corner, not her gun though, and on the kill cam she didn't move.
---
Therefore I assume the hitbox is a sub of the mesh, makes sense, problem is the player cam which isn't 100% influenced by that
---
Unfortunately the Test Server will last 3 weeks now, so March 12 is a more likely start date for Burnt Horizon, making the end date of Wind Bastion March 11.
---
Does the acog scope look bit different or is it just me? 
---
You are highly delusional. She is a well known actress. She doesn't need Siege. It is likely they didn't want to have to pay for someone as well known as her over and over.
---
I'm expecting ting the silver charm, I'll let you know what I get tho
---
Oh nice, I figured Burnt Horizon would have been ending in the next few days, thanks. 
---
If you keep making up clans it means every single one of them sucked ass. You should now stick to the last one - as there is no question you have no future in PL - and stop ruining the experience for the new players.
---
Theme Park is extremely cancer. There is pretty much one way to defend most objectives and most of the time either there are four doors to defend at once or there is a bazillion places for people to defend in objectives. Not to mention two sites are pretty awful to attack/defend and Rail is too easy to hold, especially since its a key rotate point
---
Hmm. The community developer frothy for honor (another ubi game) is leaving for another project. Eric pope
---
Nope
---
Is she Harry’s boss or something or is Harry like a god lol.
---
Ye, how did we go from 50+ years old badass ex-SEAL, ex-CIA operative John Clark, to 20 year old vaping college student?
---
Zofia? Hello?????
---
**FUCKING WHAT**
---
At this very point in time it’s exactly 520,000 if you don’t own the year pass
---
This would be absolutely broken in higher ranks/Pro play with how much the game revolves around Intel. Mozzie is introducing something new - an actual risk to droning other than just losing a cam. Its been a system that offers no real risk/reward for the attackers. Adding a third drone for attackers (for a potential 15 total on the team) would essentially nullify Mozzie impact. 
---
Sometimes even this subbreddit is toxic
---
You... 
---
Not sure about the game, but I am pretty sure the map was Oregon unless it's a proleague game I am remembering. Tower defense, Frost is decent at keeping attackers out of the windows there.
---
Unnecessary, you do that often enough ingame already.
---
That happened to me yesterday &amp; i reset app everything was there hmm idk then wish I could help more
---
or prostitutes.
---
10 IQs on the map would be a problem. 
---
Those notifications are not just for your game lobby, that's why it seems like so many bans.
---
Oooooffffff
---
Doubt it but if they also made those short films about Cav and Castle it would be nice 
---
Fucking kangaroos
---
Nothing
---
Thanks! 
---
In a decent 5 even 4 stack lion has insane synergy and kill potential. In randoms he is fine.
---
We just got a short movie so i think they are going into the story more recently
---
Y2S3
---
I know but its very hard to choose for me. i am considering between 80-85 I like to play holo to with an more aggresive playstyle but its to hard to choose for me
---
Have a drone in the room, start the timer, teammate pings the people in the room, now they cannot move without being seen and get prefired if they move during your breach.  
---
I've done that in copper with randoms, you can do much better if you have actual coordination.
---
All I play is casual. Ranked is too competitive and requires a team. If someone comes in and screws around; TKing, going idle, generally goofing off, they should not be playing casual. Just because it’s not ranked doesn’t mean you can ruin the game for everyone else.
---
Wouldn't have a clue, I gave up predicting the new CTUs a long time ago
---
He made it.
---
So I just found out when I use windowed mode, it alleviates the issue. I have no idea what that means, but it’s a start.
---
G2 deserved it
---
Are you ducking dumb? Denmark is the capital of IKEA.
---
Hello fellow noob, I hope you have a great time and don't get put into a CASUAL GAME WITH **4 DIAMOND LVL. 120 PLAYERS.** sorry, just my ptsd kicking in. 
---
No problem
---
stop trying to smurf faggot it doesn't make you good 
---
Op makes them you can scroll through his post history. I don't think he sells them/can sell them. Couple of copyrights to go through. Not sure if lego has copyrights either.
---
Even with no context slavery or something is a huge stretch. This isn’t r/nocontext material at all
---
Yeah she's in the Article 5 cutscene, idk what the title is on about
---
Well there are many ways to evade that. Plant defuser outside Evil eye line of sight, take it out with a gadget or explosive, kill maestro....
---
Gridlock has the advantage of being able to soft-lock roamers out of places without much risk to herself, though. Throw the gadget onto a stairwell and move on, you'll hear anyone that tries to pass through it. She doesn't have to rappel onto a window with a loud animation that basically screams 'Please shoot me' to use her gadget.
---
Thanks man, much appreciated 
---
Yeah Its all good and all until you get tk’d for picking lion cuz hes “cancer”
---
Some people just don't give a damn about anything..  
---
Everything's a meme, Y'know..   
---
But for new players/ if u haven’t played ranked in a while the difference between the to modes is just to big.
---
Cant now they fixed it
---
exactly. this is just another low effort "EEEHHH DAE OLD LMAO" when this character has only been replaced less than a week ago
---
bionic beard.
---
Nope, fully loaded in bud.
---
Fair enough
---
only 2 people will die and it's the person who got tked first and fuze, becaus fuze wouldn't be able to damage the 2nd person.
---
I am, and I’m buying it. I just love it. Only the win animation is a bit lame, she’s just shooting with some japanese bow.
---
In the new cinematic a new "six" was introduced AKA Harry
---
Mozzie broke his arms.
---
I like how the background interacts with the text, with shading of course
---
Yeah definitely refund
---
I thought so
---
It'll become that love story trope of guy trying to pick up uninterested girl, but is interested in her perks, like he tells her to smile more often, she does something psycho like viciously interrogate, and he just goes 
---
"Nice."
---
Yep, hate that Bandit, Smoke and in first place Monty, Castle and Lordy don’t have elites
---
😫🤛🤕
---
Get out the belt
---
Sooooo nostalgic
---
Where'd dat spook bitch go? Imma git her.
---
WW2 meme? Lol
---
He REALLY needed those few extra points to flex his Glaz elite MVP animation  
---
1) He has a shield.
---
2) He has a flash.
---
3) He has hipfire.
---
4) He can Sprint while flashing.
---
He is not fun to play against and the only counters are shooting his toes or a teammate saving your ass. 
---
Yea ima spend hundreds of dollars for a vip ticket to the six invitationals to get the Jäger skin. Sounds good. 
---
I’m still stuck on the Wind Bastion screen how did you get the burnt horizon version 
---
There are a lot of other countries that also don't have operators
---
*x files music starts playing*
---
Yes, u are correct 
---
Now that’s a fov I could get behind
---
The way they hold the shotgun (first person) it gives a TF2 vibe
---
Cover me in pickle juice and call me your slave
---
For me it is not really about the changes its about the work ubi has because they have 2 seperate versions of the game so fixing bugs will be slower and mir expensive just because some skull u don't want so loss....
---
beat me to it lol
---
The one before Harry, I don't really know too much about Clark or Chavez other than that they existed and Clarke founded Team Rainbow.
---
Please tell us which region are you in, I played R6 for 4 years (not fully) and heard a lot about this kind of issues but never experienced once.
---
Totally makes the game..literally unplayable ;) 
---
Im honestly proud of you. 
---
Yea, I know. I only know that you can see your mags on the ground after reloading. Idk if real CT operators do that when in a hurry, maybe? But yea it also makes no sense considering you don't lose bullets after a tactical reload, which should be the case, realistically. 
---
What is FOV? field of view?
---
Horizon launched on test servers today. It's not properly out yet.
---
It’s an organization, because there were technically 3 teams, ops, T1 and T2
---
Flair doesn't checks out.
---
If you open the right amount of walls, you can make the floor a giant objective, and if you utilize Lesion's traps on the stairs, and have one person cover loom [with an impact into the hallway] and at least one other cover the bathroom entrance, it's a very manageable site.
---
Honestly, downstairs is cancer, there's really only one way to effectively hold it, and it never works out correctly with consistency like my kids holds do.
---
[Have fun listening my friend!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/flHY68j4U8I/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&amp;rs=AOn4CLDfoL354ZJIbBQo6saxYhf5GZ_KBw)
---
Oh cool, I didn't know that.
---
These clips just *have* to be set up...even the worst players I’ve met have better game sense than this...players this bad probably wouldn’t even bother planting the defuser. Not accusing anyone of anything just...wtf lol 
---
eus
---
She's 36
---
Internal test version? Wind Bastion isn’t over yet. They’re putting Burnt Horizon on the test server today, but it’s not going to go live on the public server for another 2-3 weeks.
---
It is likely just obs or shadowplay and they have all uploaded the videos separately and then they can be watched invidually, this is what our team does anyway 
---
The downfall of rainbow six is its players lol
---
Joint the custom game as a spectator, and spectate the player of choice
---
You started at the best time where a lot of good changes are coming just dont be bothered by the toxicity a lot of nice players are out there
---
Plus it may be able to fool attackers, it won't be much but if they hit a barricade and don't know it's a castle, it could alert the defender where the attacker is, instead of just a big explosion and an open window. I would like to see this. 
---
Cool.
---
You should check out some Club House reflections/ videos feeds, might still have some interesting things
---
when exactly is the tts being updated?
---
I'm using 4:3 too, switched from 16:9 and currently really enjoying it
---
Ah, thanks 
---
no it wouldn't

Thank you for making such a great game
---
I'm happy for you but at the same time i'm sad. Hold me Justin.
---
Thank you

You don't even have to press a button. I always alt+tab during loading and I always get to the main menu.

KIZOOOKUUUUUUUUU
---
Apparently, a while ago, someone said something about how changing Smoke's into the globe regular ones are fully turns them into regular smokes. How? Idfk, sounds like something Ubi should work on more due to it being amount one of the most requested changes, but it's Ubisoft...
---
The thing is that the coach was monitoring all players povs during the scrim at the same time. That's what we are looking for.
---
Also, speed up a little bit for deploying the panel maybe come in handy
---
Hello AFLUFFYDOF,
---
Haven't seen her since the beginning of Y1
---
You should call out 3 things when you die: 1. Where you died (there is an icon on their screen but it doesn’t work as well a a callout: i.e. armory on Border): 2. Who killed you and the amount of health they have (this is easy because it literally shows you who killed you in the killcam; if you know you shot someone a lot but you can’t figure out the exact value, just say he/she’s lit)
---
Yeah, i figured that was the reason
---
Today
---
Is she not still in the opening credits?
---
Yeah could be. It just looks like the coach is monitoring the players during the scrim.
---
Thank you for all that you've done for the community and for the support you've given me over the years =)
---
I would still just rather they had made the clip and the sights part of the skins
---
It's been a wonderful few years working with you my Rainbro.
---
I'm proud of you, and excited for the work you will be doing moving forward. The community on your next project is lucky to have you. ❤️
---
Vince Zampella has never made a bad game, and I don't think APEX is any exception. 
---
I was looking for this comment
---
Sniki Biki

All I see is a white square o.O??

Every DMR in the game can already 3-shot a 3 armor operator with Rook plate on. CAMRS, 417 and OTs-03 can even even do it while hitting legs.
---
3-shots are not very impressive as even many AR can do this on 3-armors.
---
Where is it? It's usually always in my owned games on Uplay and it's not here.
---
The world in 2019
---
Not anymore
---
Can we slap your ass? 
---
I’ll take that discount,( she is also on the news every morning )
---
Realism - Yes the game is far from a realistic tactical shooter today but when the game originally came out that's what it was like, the mechanic has never been removed 
---
"The names always reflect the gadgets rather than the operators"
---
Ela, Zofia, Mozzie, Finka: _exists_
---
/s
---
Too sweet baby! 
---
The new ranked will feature Pick and Ban.
---
The reasoning is most likely for realism, and for accidentally firing on your team. They are going to change it so after one team kill, any more damage to the team gets put onto the teamkiller
---
Okay that’s actually one of the funniest things I’ve seen on here, well done!
---
What happend to her? 
---
They're not leaving, they're moving to a new project
---
my theory is that they have something they plan to be the  next big thing in the works
---
Do punish uncoordinated teams, make mistakes a threat to your team, be able to reset teammates, ...
---
No clue
---
You already posted that Yesterday.

Well ya when it's "I don't like a certain harmless even somewhat altruistic outlook let's demonize them for it" that's pretty worth complaining about.

Do you play in fullscreen on your monitor with 4:3, or do you put it in windowed mode? Thinking of trying this myself.

Hold on, let me see if I can find the image.

I have it and game share with my cousin and he isn’t able to get any of my pro league stuff and I have almost all pro leagues in the game. He is however able to get my Gem Skins that I bought. It’s weird how he has some content but the pro league is one thing you probably will not be able to get from game sharing.

Also sad I’m on PC now and can’t transfer any of my stuff from Xbox to PC :(

Hey, what are you talking about? I'm Russian... I just wanted better operators. Turks have the 7th best army in the world, Iranian operators are also cool and Israelis,they got high-tech gadgets. So, I guess these countries would've easily destroyed yours. Well, better than Mexico,Peru and Kenya for sure.

WDYM by side prone?
---
What do you mean by 'side prone'?
---
Most likely around 1pm est like previous seasons. 
---
The actor that played six originally has become a lot more famous so it was probably easier and cheaper to higher a new guy and play it off as a promotion
---
Yeah I saw it instantly, the original is a painting from René Magritte.
---
You mean lean and prone? You just have to go prone and then press Q or E
---
Do you still own your Xbox and would be able to come on to negotiate? I have pretty much all pro leagues and everything In digital content.

2-3 weeks after announcement is normally the case but no official info yet. 
---
I haven’t seen it taking off anywhere as legitimate use, but perhaps it’s just I haven’t seen it.
---
I have seen a number of people do it as trolling to those people who actually think “OMG HE MUST MEAN WHITE POWER!!” In essence, they are using the sign ironically to show how stupid that thought process is.
---
If this has become a legitimate WP thing now, I actually wouldn’t say it’s alt rights fault. The hoax was started by extreme leftists in order to paint other people as alt right. 
---
Perhaps it lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy:
---
Extreme left: “If we scream loud enough that this is an alt right symbol, people will believe it and think people in the moderate right are actually neo-nazis. Yay!”
---
Alt right: “Fuck. That’s actually a good sign, hell yeah let’s use it”. 
---
Extreme left: “See?!? WE TOLD YOU!!”
---
Yup
---
I can respect that, but I hope they realize how hard it can be to have a troll on your team in casual and remove it there. In ranked I wouldn’t mind friendly fire.
---
I think ubi confirmed it at some point
---
Okay maybe that's why I managed to get MVP after not playing for 6 months
---
realism, so you learn fire and spray control, so you can reset teammates (not realistic but whatever), and besides if some idiot tks 2 people theyre banned anyway.

If you read Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six book it’s a realistic fiction, of course it’s cookie cutter it’s based on real life, if you were expecting to read about caviera using her pistol to interrogate or vigil cloaking himself to sneak in its, again, realistic fiction.

It’ll come to ranked in Y4S1

I'm talking about the characters btw. I get more from the bios about characters with no campaign then I do from actual flushed out Clancy characters.

Hello elijahveb, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about Twitch Drops.
---
You said it yourself that quake is dead.
---
How does popular in the past guarantee popular in the future?
---
You claim to have facts but your facts actually do not support your conclusion.
---
Why is Cs still popular?
---
First why did it become popular? First realistic military shooter compared to arena shooters.
---
Many shooters afterwards copied the style like cod but they didn't last, why? No skill gap.
---
That's why Cs is popular still because of the skill it requires to play but besides that it's the most basic game, designed 20 years ago.
---
There is no reason a newer game which allows for skill can't replace it in the future. 
---
No I'm talking about the characters having no depth. Sure it's realistic in terms of combat he gets top marks for that.
---
Thanks! Your keyboard looks good as well. Best of luck, friend.
---
Roaming is still pretty strong right now, plus Dokabei is getting a nerf soon
---
Yeah that’s true. But generally, if you know about crossfires, holding angles and slow/fast peaking you will do fine in siege.

what rank are you because those guys were awful.
---
It's not even that far from reality. There are plenty of known [extremist environmentalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-terrorism) that have hurt innocent people and ruined lives because nut jobs believe it is okay because trees.
---
It's not a giant leap from 'tree huggers' to enviroterrorism. It is grounded in reality
---
Roamers are still some of the most powerful operators there are. If they become weaker, we’ll notice it.

Every time the year road map comes out somebody complains that x places didnt get an op for that year, its not that they neglect them its that they’ve added more that other people have asked for, like the Kenyan and Peruvian.

I believe The starter edition will be completely gone next season and that it will automatically be upgraded

No one will hear her scream
---
Yeah same
---
You’re from Turkey aren’t you?
---
Ah I see. So if they add Serbia in the future, will they also be considered Slav?

Doubt we'll get a Swedish operation. Or even another Nordic country tbh. Been waiting for a Nordic country since the start and we just get the one op :/

Aim 100

Is this for season 1?

I am so proud of this community

But old Hereford is still in situations, ins't it? So they are probably going to leave old Kanal there too meaning that you need both versions

2 years of play and only just learning about this now, thanks!

I'm really hoping they do ranked restrictions to fix this..
---
We should be thanking you, thanks for such an amazing game
---
Hello Cts414,
---
Look at what they did to my poor boy
---
I'd argue it's partly to avoid the attackers having an easy ADS burner, because admitting Gridlock manages to deploy it on the floor you now have a device that shoots 12 or so "projectiles" over time, another part is probably because they didn't deem the gadgets effect overall to be dangerous enough to warrant ADS protection, I mean you can shoot the first trap as soon as it deploys (if you are on site and see it) and nullify the gadget that way already.
---
Oh wow, I didn’t pick up on this. You thinking impact will be the best way to deal with them? 
---
Well in a way she deserved it, she called a suppressor a silencer :ooo
---
It's just a stupid response that someone how think console players are worse than they are. Aim is slower and nothing else.  It's petty and ignorant.

This year going to be a rework year so they just bring random nations...But at least they would make a Danish season or Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish Operator next to the Danish one...

We already have enough American Operators.

Probably yes

Important to note he has two separate animations when there is ammo left in the mag he flips it to the left and he catches it, if the mag is empty he just flicks it to the right, on to the ground.

I removed the barricade for this video. Usually I know where to shoot and keep the barricade intact.

Hello Roadboy09, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about Twitch Drops.

She's cute now

It looks different and does not obstruct the view that much
---
Problem solved i pressed options on the game tile in the ps4 menu then i went to info and saw the game was still downloading.
---
I'm aware of that. My argument wasn't about player count but rather that Ubisoft could honour Denmark, Sweden and Finland by giving them own operators. I'm sure there's enough interesting Special Forces from Nordics, for example Bear Squad and Utti Jaeger Regiment from Finland.
---
I'm dreaming of a roamer/flanker Finnish Defender equipped with RK62 (no acog).
---
&lt;3
---
noticed what 
---
Doc got up and hit him back later on lmao
---
I'm honestly surprised the leaks we had were actually real, it's crazy to think someone managed to get them.
---
&gt; The point of the discussion was the suggestion of creating an official subreddit for creative purposes, where artwork/content does not have to directly relate to siege.
---
Everyone is free to create a subreddit, so are you. As another comment on this thread pointed out, there already exist a couple of other R6 art subreddits.
---
&gt;None of the posts are in context with situations from within the game
---
As noted by our rules, this specifically applies to modified in-game screenshots.
---
&gt;The " This thing looks like a thing from Siege" rule can be applied to all of these posts as these are just comparisons.
---
This would also mean that no-one but Ubisoft can make any artwork related to R6. Frankly, that's not a smart argument to make and we will continue to consider fan creations as related artwork.
---
Do i have to be from Turkey to say something people don't know?

I WOULD BUY WILDLANDS 2 IMMEDIATELY IF IT WILL BE MADE BY UBISOFT MONTREAL.
---
I really love Wildlands, it is so much fun playing with my buddies. But Ubi Paris simply don't care or not put enough effort about the game's longevity, nor the community. Bugs that exist from launch, optimization, community's QOL requests, etc... It's just sad, if Wildlands ever gets taken care by Red storm like what they did with The Division, I would still play the hell out of it.
---
mav

The old six
---
Umm, I guess?
---
I don’t exactly study ethnicities so I can’t tell you that with certainty.
---
A lot of newbies play reactionary. A character is near me but not shooting? Must be a teammate. A teammate is across the objective but shooting in my direction? DIEEE
---
Welcome back to things that are still a mystery in the universe
---
I don't mean for it to destroy the extra things it lays out just the actual projectile initally thrown. It doesn't make sense for this to not be targeted by it.  
---
As I said there is no actual way to counter it, you just have to deal with it as you come across it. There is no prevention.  
---
I mean I checked your profile and all that’s there is shit about Turkey. It’s pretty obvious.
---
The reason why Turkey is in the game, is because they’re firing rockets at Kurdish rebels lol.
---
Oh good, you arent leaving ubi, so another community, that I may yet join bas a good community personality. Ubi has come a good ways from being as bad as they were when seige first released, seemed like everything they released then was a horrible buggy mess. Now they really give the devs the time to work on and perfect their passion products and look how much Seige has succeeded because of it. Good luck in the future and thank you for being part of this community.

One word not anymore y4 this cant be done

As soon as I saw  the tv I knew that’s what everyone would go on about 😂
---
It’s np if you can play with it but I just feel sorry for the graphics etc..
---
Okay! Mainly just for the humor of it I imagine
---
The word is *cock my dude
---
Wow haha, I always did the opposite. I've always been destroying the lobby cam and only learned about the skylight spot a few months ago (and I've been playing since Y1) 
---
Sure you can just shoot that one but it still gives your rough position away to the enemy.
---
As No1InGeneral mentioned, I believe it should shoot the thrown projectile out. If it lands before the ADS can hit it (I.E thrown straight at the ground) then sure, it shouldn't shoot the expanding ones. But it should definitely shoot the thrown one so that defenders have some kind of counter besides giving away your position and having to shoot the device.
---
Yeah that's the second part of my post, when I say they probably deemed it not worthy of protection.
---
To be fair Capitao's bolts don't get stopped either, but unlike Capitao's bolts, Gridlock's gadget will usually see use off site first and foremost, if it turns out to be a problem on site then we will no doubt see the balancing team decide that Jaeger can counter the thrown canister. 
---
Unfortunately I've never really given Capitao a chance but I've never felt threaten when playing against him. I suppose that's just situational though but I can see where he could be strong with a Ying
---
How come they don’t have a pro-league set?
---
Okay so let’s say you’re attacking daycare-bunks on theme park and you have yoyr entire team pushing from train but two guys, gridlock places her gadget behind you in the hallway, locking off the rotation into office, and into the hallway. 
---
In this same situation nomad places her gadget in the same places, one locking off the hallway, one locking off the offices. 
---
So let’s say a vigil decides to rotate if he ran into the nomad charges he would fall over and hit the floor, but nothing would happen, if you had a nomad there you could get the easy kill.
---
Now let’s say there is a gridlock mine there then the defender would have to spend the next 10 seconds clearing all of the traps by shooting them, or by throwing his impact. Which makes a metric fuck ton of noise for the attackers to hear, gridlock could easily rotate back and watch their ass while they wait. But there is also the added benefit that the vigil can second guess and not push because he will make needless noise and take needless damage. 
---
So both ways you can kill the vigil, but gridlock more effectively denies that rotation, nomad just capitalized off her gadget. 
---
Not to mention gridlock has smokes and this makes her significantly better at pushng the objective compared to nomad 
---
Nomad and gridlock do the same thing in two different ways 
---
She looks like a cosplay model now.
---
Holy shit, didn’t know there was a new Six (Harry). Kind of bummed, would’ve enjoyed more of her. Would’ve enjoyed any added story actually. 
---
It’s not complaining it’s having an opinion on the game. The game is broken because of runouts, they are ridiculously overpowered and stupid as fuck. that’s the only reason some people even get kills cause they shoot people in the back, runouts shouldn’t be in the game at all. Simple as that
---
:(
---
Idk about console, only games I have on XBOX is COD WWII and Mortal Kombat
---
Season 2 of year 4
---
Great one dude 
---
You are missing the point about competition lol they banned Monty because that's the strat they want to block. It looks like it worked. Lion is OP not annoying. Anyone who plays at a plat or higher level knows how OP he is. Echo is OP. Maestro is OP. Your idea of annoying is what makes most ops great. They make you uncomfortable. The system works, whether you see it or not.

When will year 4 start?

Burnt Horizon looks good the only thing I hope doesn't happen is broken hitreg like in Grim Sky
---
Go to PC then where you'll be a silver 
---
Special Air Service 'Ralia
---
Sure? I’m not yet 
---
Yup, I got Platinum and Diamond this morning.
---
You will need to buy the y4 pass
---
I didn't really notice it too much until last night. I realized that I was actually shotgunning my fellow operators when I watched blood fly out of an enemy. Lol
---
Oof
---
Yeah, sorry, I got confused. I meant Standard.
---
Lol echo pulling a fast one by using the scope (hole) UNDER his ACOG 
---
Zofia means wisdom - older sister. Ela means 'oak', a hardwood  (hardships). Not gadget related really.
---
Finka is derived from Jozefina rooted in Yehoseph which in turn means, "Yehowah has added, he will enlarge, God will increase, may he add". Yehoseph is derived from 'yasaph' meaning 'to add, increase, do again, increase, do again'. Finka literally adds power via the nanobots once, again and then again.
---
Only on console...and sometimes on PC too, I confess. \*sigh\*
---
So no ranked chance and casual top at this point :(
---
i hate you all
---
Oh, then I missed that one. Thanks!
---
WHAT ABOUT THE BLACK HOLO? :O
---
I totally agree, not everyone uses the acog on the r4c so this change doesn't affect everyone. why not make us re-learn the r4c, a change that affects all r4c users. The rifle to the average player using a muzzle break or compensator is incredibly easy to use. Give that r4c higher recoil to make that sweaty ash main, like me, reconsider full spraying and mag-dumping the clip when rushing a room. also change my mind, black ice looks like shit without an acog 
---
I haven’t seen it in game but in the second teaser it looks at least 3 times the size of a candela 
---
Out of respect I will always ask permission before picking him /s
---
Probably Thermite, Thatcher, Jager, or Rook
---
Hello Tommy-_-Conrad,
---
Capitao is my operator of choice in a smoke plant rush, I smoke off the angles with his bolts and plant, then post plant I place his asphyxiation bolt on the defused preventing them from defusing it. 
---
He’s only good in bomb though, sadly 
---
Jeezus he IS a fucking mosquito.
---
Dude stays hype like he has a red bull IV drip lol
---
Straight nostalgia- I used to have one of those TVs, and I loved it. 
---
Is the tts live?
---
No, it's a different holo. The black holo on SMG-11 is the current holo reskinned black, Mozzie's P10 Roni has the UH1 from Vortex
---
it makes gadgets and some equipment a two step process. So for me i press c to pull out my breaching charge and then left mouse click to actually put it on a surface.
---
I dont believe that is being added right away. And casual is a fine place to learn the basics. Ranked will place him where his game knowledge and aim are fit.
---
No, we do not have a Scottish Ctu or an Israel Ctu, but we have operators from Scotland and Israel.   
---
In your post you asked for country representation through operators.  You didn’t specify that you wanted an Israel CTU.  That’s why everyone’s arguing with you about Ash.
---
Training, communication, cohesion, training and strats. 
---
The hero we got not the one we deserved
---
Black Ice M870. New black holos.
---
No, takes too much time, slows down the game alot. People only ban other's mains in low ranks.
---
that's like the equivalent of $5
---
I'm not an expert but it could be drivers
---
Six is not like that. The Team sets it's own tactics and the command is shared between them all, Six role is more of a squad connection than leader per se
---
Those are some nice seasonal weapon skins.
---
This would take to much time and getting ur main banned u just play someone else? It won't happen to often and  yes some ops are banned more often but there are many ops to pick 
---
This has been an idea circling around this sub Reddit for awhile. So to save you the trouble it's just not a good idea for an op . Because Essentially you have a recruit that is only useful when their team mate is dead. And I'm saying he is a recruit because he actually doesn't have any ability of his own so if your team mates use all their stuff before they die you have no purpose. Also this will just lead to people team killing if someone picked their main  because they can just tk and get their main back 
---
HOLY SHIT SNACKS
---
2 to 3 days mate my Thatcher is currently taking 6 so I think it's a lottery Haha 
---
Welp for you yes. For us tho R6 Credits expensive :)
---
Multiplayer is a training simulation. That's all it is.
---
when you get a chance, you can test it out for yourself by going into your settings. I highly recommend it
---
Hahaha lmao this made my day
---
It was unexpected to see so many bug fixes for shield operators, especially the one where shields rotate around with delayed animation. 
---
Ok, I must've misheard that part of the panel
---
wondering the same about the season pass skins,haven't been shown
---
It's my duty,Sir.
---
Ah, okay. That makes more sense then.

Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. Enjoy
---
You'll be missed, thanks for the time you spent with the Siege community. Panels won't be the same without you.
---
Imo they really should just get rid of the speeds and armors of ops and make them all the same but then focus more on different gun types make you move at different speeds. 
---
&gt;CROUCH AND LEAN SPAM
---
We have identified a way to have a substantial impact on the viability of spamming crouch and lean commands. Currently, player animations allow players to snap from left to right lean, as well as crouching, without going through the full animation for that action. We will deploy a fix that prevents this from being exploitable in Y4S1.
---
The way the worded it yesterday, it seemed as if they fixed lean spam but hadn't yet fixed crouch spam.. But the way this is worded it seems like both fixes are coming this season, can we get a confirmation on that from anyone at Ubi?
---
Ye ubi HURRY UP 
---
Yeah boi 
---
Yea fuck them for reworking Glaz into a role that actually makes sense for someone with what amounts to a 1HKO sniper rifle. 
---
This forces you to actually camp and scout. And hell, if you’re a pain in the ass Glaz anyways this won’t stop you from storming in anyways 
---
That looks nothing like cav, it’s just a generic Santa muerte tattoo. That’s like getting a tattoo of Jesus and saying it’s tachanka

They should silently put all cheaters into their own matchmaking hoppers. Cheaters only ever play cheaters. That would be hilarious

---
Make his LMG shoot explosive rounds. Or maybe lasers.
---
On a side note, does anyone else completely suck ass at bank?
---
Running out and shooting someone in the back is being a good player? Oh 
---
What he said plus you can cancel the deployment animation before it ends if you are not comfortable with the gadget's position or afraid of losing the gadget like jager ADS on electrified wall
---
The operators train against each other in a simulation. The novel states that. In the CGI trailer of The Hammer and the Scalpel,you can also see there Dokkabae and Thatcher training together against other defenders
---
very specific

I should've gotten diamond but i didn't how sad.

Don’t get lion because they totally nerfed him in the new op

Hello Marshall_ND, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/arzqfj/6inv/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Zofia has had many clutches for me in the last couple of days
---
right? how old is pengu LMAO
---
Its a free to play fuze bomb!
---
These last 3 years have been the most disappointing, Ubisoft doesn't give a single shit about this game.
---
Oh no.
---
One Cav is enough. One lusion is enough.
---
I think that the other gadget should've been a grappling hook that let's you scale up to cielings and walk around them, as well as go up through hatches. It'd be the perfect representation of Australia, they're walking around upside down and shooting spiders at people.
---
This has been known since forever. MP is a simulation of battles just training mode. Attackers/defenders are all Rainbow with different specializations. 
---
TH/Situations is the canon situation. 
---
Anyone got diamond charm ? I watched every day from start to end and got only 5 charms ? Is that a bug or lag with drops?
---
*Ash looses acog and you're talking to your friend you mains Ash when they find out*
---
STAY CLEAR OF BLAST ZONE
---
First pope leaving for honor and now Justin is leaving siege. :(

I hope they team up wherever they are going. ;(

I got all my charms including Diamond.
---
I agree, I’ve damaged myself multiple times from accidentally clicking my grenade button and I’ve wasted many other grenades. Call me clumsy
---
Fuck people that do this. 
---
Around March 11 i think
---
i also thought the same but i tried everything , the latest drivers and the oldest one too which are provided on brands offical website for ur model , but none make any difference
---
Yeah but atleast he won't be able to interrogate you lol
---
Yeah the input lag isn’t a super noticeable thing but I have been on a monitor for like 3 years and then I went to my friends house and he played on a huge projector screen and the input lag was really bad compared to what I was used to, I couldn’t even imagine playing a fast paced shooter on that because you’d press the trigger and shoot half a second later, but he(friend) was  used to it so it didn’t bother him.
---
There is no way a new player put a claymore on the diffuser. Either blind or setup 
---
me and my friends use it alot so that sucks
---
I may be dumb, but where do you guys see the update on DBNO? I read the article 4 times and I just can’t find it.
---
TFW everyone kept tearing down your barricades but you aced anyways
---
do you need some /r/eyebleach
---
right
---
Yes. That's what happens when you can only use Screen-space reflections and Cube Maps. We need more RTX ON to get this to work
---
You can hold to cook grenades. Advanced Gadget deployment is a thing. And I don't understand how the defuser is an issue.
---
Me and my friend had this convo the other day... he said” oh well.. if ash can’t use his acog then I’ll have to go someone else that can’t get shot in the head.. he’s a Blackbeard main now...
---
Is that an elite or just a new skin 
---
i wish i could cosplay it aswell. but well...

Sounds like a good fix, and hit AOE buff is nice, even with some reduced damage. I'll take it.

IQ here.

Well that cuts both ways since high level players can swamp low level players regardless if they’re trying or not
---
When you lock the entire team inside the objective at the start of prep phase
---
The glaz nerf will make it extremely hard for close quarters combats now. It's not possible to see through smoke while moving or peeking and without access to any automatic weapon. He has a very average hitting dmr with very dodgy hit registration making it incredibly hard to play now. This will not only make him less powerful in general but will also has make him weak at pushing and weak at long range engagements. Sucks to be a Glaz main now. 
---
I thought it was a new sight
---
That sucks, the main thing I liked about the playlist wasn’t even operator bans it was the ESL only maps 
---
Youtubers who played the new season used those skins actually. Saw them on few videos. It's snake like camo uniform and headgear for gridlock and mozzie.
---
kinda feel like the r4c should get an angled, so it can atleast be used in an aggressive way
---
Funny you should say that....  
---
 SHIELD OPERATOR ROTATION
---
*When Shield Operators turn in place, there is a slight delay before the shield and upper body snap to align with the legs. This can cause a mismatch between first and third person perspectives. We are deploying a change that will make this left and right motion more fluid, and ensure that first and third person perspectives are aligned.*
---
Just released [here](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/burnthorizon/index.aspx).
---
Too long didn’t read (basically it’s just saying “here’s a summary”)
---
Yeah everyone does but I kinda get the reasoning for it. It’s an indirect buff to doc as well since he’s your only bet at getting more hp now 
---
Hello Swirlyyyy,
---
The 4 base FBI SWAT operators are out of the equation here. It isn't really about their nationality its more about their CTU, if a country has multiple counter terrorism units then we can expect to see more of them in the future.

They're both ok. They both counter just about anything electronic on defense.

&gt; Holosight color is determined by the base skin of the weapon it is equipped on. 
---
I was on ps4 and I was playing with randoms once and i was last alive, i was taking my time but ended up on the roof and didnt have enough time to get to objective, some kid gets on the mic and says I'm trash, he was the first to die at the beginning of the round. A couple rounds later we lost 2-3 and i look at the scoreboard and the kid who said i was trash was bottom of team with no kills, i was 2nd with like 3 or 4 kills. I was very tempted to send him a messege saying "who's trash??" But i didnt cause i didnt think it was worth my time. Just wanted to share one of my many experiences with toxic players.
---
Yes. there is no NDA
---
Why wouldn't you be allowed to? Anyone can download the TTS for free.
---
He’s 21
---
ive had it to where me and my friends had five tv's in one room.
---
Ok thanks 
---
Yep been dealing with this for so long and still rage over it a lot
---
You're high as fuck if you believe that 
---
*German accent* "ve have discovered a new element! Eureka!"
---
it’s a very large tattoo from a game he might eventually stop caring about. I’m not saying it looks bad.
---
*Who owns the base game
---
That isnt Cav, and Id have to say is a downgrade from her nornal look.
---
That tattoo looks more like something from a horror movie than siege.
---
My brother and I were just joking about “Siege: All-Stars” as we called it and started to brainstorm characters from other games to show up. 
---
We didn’t get far
---
I think you can but I'm not 100% sure… so as the bot said, ask on r/rainbow6tts
---
Actually made her Japanese, unbelievable only took them 2 years. 
---
Ohh, I can't wait to go around abusing this new system.. 😂 Now it's gonna be some much more fun to run in front of teammate's bullets when they start to take tge damage as well.. We will never accidentally win again, copper here we come!
---
This is obviously a joke from my part, just wanted to let you know how bad the new system is. Unfortunately Ubisoft is such a broke company that they only can afford to hire mentally restricted monkeys to develop this game, who can't think of a better system than this.. 😂 😂 😂 Poor effort, Ubi.. 
---
Isn’t the three week TTS going to start Season 2?
---
No. ANYONE can download it for free.
---
The game is about diversity. So we should be getting all sorts of Operators from all sorts of countries. Game would get pretty bland character wise if we tried showing every American CTU. America has way more Operators than any other country in the game so far and that should matter more than it having a lot of CTUs. 
---
Affirmative 
---
What
---
I don't see how your 1000 hours of ranked in copper and bronze validates your claim... 
---
Well now you will like casual because its everything you want. No bans and basically old ranked rules.
---
Really? How? I tought it was only players who owns the game.
---
Lmao if someone can actually does that 😂 
---
Well cs is only aiming mechanics, logical you are not as good as when you train for it always.
---
Siege is about team tactics, are you saying they don't matter at pro level?
---
So ex Cs players should wipe the floor with every siege pro team, right ? 
---
&gt;I understand that with Lion it's also his ability, but you cannot disagree that being able to activate an ability that affect all teammates/enemies/everyone from anywhere with no risk to being stopped is bad.
---
In the previous state, yes. But not anymore. Remember, jackal is comparatively much worse when you look at the after effects of the scan, yet he is underplayed, and can even be trapped. Alibi is basically what lion, but for longer and she does trap people, even the best of them. Now, lion is also in a state where you can use his ability against him by baiting him and setting up a crossfire.
---
Your activation could be literally anything, none of that matters if it takes too much control away from the Defender. Thankfully, lion no longer does that.
---
&gt;Yes Lion was extra cancer because of his affect, but the activation also had a part in it. I agree though that this is a huge nerf to Lion and while still a global, it's not quite as powerful as it was.
---
Which is good, since now it is a low risk, medium skill, low reward that varies with team communication and perfect timing. Good Lions will no longer hit a scan and waste it at start.
---
2 seconds is very, very reasonable to me. I can even use it to bait him for an easy kill. The best part his, his death doesn't deprive the team of too much. Yes he is very powerful in post plant, but that doesn't mean he hurts the team too much with his absence.
---
I'm ok with global abilities as long as the operation and after effects are balanced, like it is now. Right now, I'd say all global abilities are either balanced, or close to balanced. Hell, even Finka is, given that she is vulnerable to the 2 things that almost every decent elo team has- lesion, and smoke. No wonder her pick rate is dire in PL. You'll rarely ever see a team without a lesson and smoke. Not to forget, echo cancels her out. And mute jams her activation, so she can't juice inside objective. People complain about her cancer, which is only partially true. She is the only one with more counters than the rest of year 3 combined. She's only cancer once you take out enemy anti attacker electronics, which in itself often takes 2:30, so that last stretch is the only combat phase.
---
True, but that's from my personal needs &amp; experiences. For me, whenever I play casual I play it to have fun and laugh at myself more so than trying to win so getting my ass kicked is okay as long as the guys aren't cheating or something like that. Just my experience though. I wouldn't mind seeing this comeback.
---
The blue color should be diamond instead of platinum charm
---
They'll thank Ubi later
---
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
---
IDK but my friend did. I think he just found it on steam or Ubi store and it was free. 
---
I still think they should cancel all the planned seasonal events and spend year 4 making a full fledged campaign for release Y5. It would be so awesome to see Siege take on a real R6 style campaign, plus, lack of a story mode is the only thing keeping Siege from a perfect score, which is a shame because the characters have so much backstory.
---
what about attackers
---
Platinum has been blue-ish since Dust Line, their colouring has been unusual since day one.
---
Diamond is not blue and neither is platinum so they distinguish them differently by the cut effect on the diamond charms but still heavily appear to look like diamond. 
---
It is a vicious circle and it is something I have never understand from an art style point of view. 
---
Nice "Grindlock" meme.
---
Hello MC2707, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about Twitch Drops.
---
If you're covering that entrance this is a normal strategy, you posting this makes you look like the new player
---
May the lord be with you {-}7
---
Yeah that's why. Just continue through and get a placement and you'll see players skill will start to be more identical.
---
Or, squad up for easier communication and trust. 
---
OmegaOof
---
We've known ab this for months 
---
I dropped off for a while after the newness of Wind Bastion wore off, but with Burnt Horizon announced I'm back at it hard, and can't wait. 
---
Thanks, I was forgetting this detail. 
---
It was a but and was going to be fixed.
---
Now, he can fire through the mira peek hole and Mira can no longer stand and fire there.
---
I got the deluxe edition? 
---
It is more scientific as its whats accepted by the scientific community. 
---
Its like how we tolerate Imperial, but for any serious scientific organisations publishing international results - you post it in SI 
---
Until recently Aluminum was actually considered wrong, and only in the last 10 years was it added in brackets to also be acceptable but not preferred. 
---
The damage is reflected to you not them
---

---
He looks like he's about to panic-overheal.
---
They said this would be the case when they made changes to him but wouldn't be ready till year 4, so this is good news for those who like to run elite weapon skins. 
---
I mean that's what I thought. 
---
Why they released no kangoroo or koala skin!? 
---
Why are blood orchid ops still 15,000 in Y5S2?
---
Current patch notes to get you started
---
https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/burnthorizon/index.aspx
---
Pretty much. That’s the only play.
---
After you team kill, any damage you try to do on your teammates is reflected to you. They stay on full health but yours goes down. Like shooting yourself
---
So it just seems interesting take on it. Hopefully it helps. 
---
There is still a point: you can withstand Gu, Gridlock's trap, Maestro's taser, etc. 
---
Nope 
---
Thats not Cav
---
TTS last 3 weeks starting with season 2, not this season
---
Big F for our big boi 
---
There's hardly anyone in diamond as it is, why would they do this???
---
Thank you, appreciated! 
---
Thanks guys!
---
After you kill one teammate, any damage you deal to anouther teammate is reflected to you. If you do 100 damage, you die. You deal 30 damage, you get 30 damage and they dont get hurt
---
This is a LOT of fixes.
---
I hope all of them make it to live.
---
This season has definitely been tough on us.
---
It will come when they introduce the ranked hub and remove the mode from beta which is intended for release in the first half of year 4 which means either at the start or middle of season 2.
---
The matchmaking system becomes more accurate the more ranked matches you play, so if you are only playing a few games here and there you will get quite a few outliers. The more you play ranked the more competitive it will get
---
Smacking piece of technology right there!
---
But I mean it's good enough.
---
March 5th I believe 
---
Yugh, guy, it is so cool! Thank you!
---
I’m kinda new to siege, but imma guess here that the whole the opposing team is way to big to be effective almost making it silly? 
---
It’s gone live already
---
so when does the TS drop? been waiting all day for it
---
Yes, but for the gym room change, make the cover something gym related and not just some random piece of metal, but overall I do like these changes
---
They originally talked about capitao being the attacker healer so this new buff to him could either be a really bad sign for that idea as they're changing him. Or hopefully a really good sign as they want to mkae him more used to prepare for the new buff where he can heal 
---
It's just kind of weird to tattoo a video game character 
---
This is not a pipe
---
With simple deployment, in the case of a throwable, like Smoke or Valkyrie, the item is automatically thrown when pushing the default middle mouse button once. With Advanced deployment, pushing the middle mouse button puts the item in your hand and is then throwable with the left mouse button, allowing for often times more precise throws in places. With items that are placed, like Thermite charges, Advanced deployment allows you to cancel the animation before it finishes, in the case of trying to get around a Bandit tricked wall. Simple deployment does not allow for this cancel as it’s a one click placement.
---
Sometime in Early March
---
Yea there are guys walking around behind you so it’s pretty hard to sneak capture anything. 
---
Looks like a starcraft dragoon.
---
March 4th
---
Maybe just put the Bomb at the front. Or maybe a stack of weights piled up 
---
I understand this reference
---
Thank you!

And it got 3 upvotes, I wanted it to gain traction so maybe a dev might see it not just vent :/ no point posting it again though
---
Promo says before March 4th just to clarify
---
Thank you.
---
I feel like chateau is going to get sillybor other medium/small maps
---
Haha, I took a look in the history too, he’s not from Finland, he just moved there recently. I guess he ain’t a citizen yet/doesn’t have a passport besides the foreign one so he probably doesn’t have the same ease of travel. I still wish he replied himself, I wanna know where Brazil bans people from lol. 
---
Honestly why the fuck are all the Russian ops units like every single one of them.
---
r/shittyrainbow6
---
That's great. It's just that the starter edition makes you take forever to unlock operators while the other editions have all base operators unlocked. I hope you enjoy the game!
---
Not old Hereford backup on casual:"/
---
Wait, where is the selfdamaging feature to combat toxicity?
---
&gt; WHY ARE YOU ALL FUCKING BRAINDEAD   
---
Thanks.   
---
I’m simply clarifying that the scope on Gridlock’s lmg is the same magnification as the acog that we already have on dmr’s.  Giving dmr’s a tiny bit more visibility when aimed, won’t change their status in the meta.   
---
They’re a single shot weapon, that just by design makes them worse at prefiring and less likely to win a gun fight/ headshot when compared to an automatic weapon.  Don’t get me wrong, Buck’s CAMRS is one of my favorite guns in the game, but there’s a reason nobody uses semi-auto weapons in a close quarters game unless they have to (Dokkabei.)   
---
Don’t run around calling people braindead when you think a tiny visual difference will suddenly make an entire weapon class competitive with automatic rifles.
---
so you’re complaining that their *competitive* mode is becoming more competitive? I really don’t understand why that’s bad. The dev team is enhancing the competitiveness of their ranked playlist, there shouldn’t be anything to complain about.  
---
And they aren’t reducing content, they’re practically redoing 3 whole maps. we don’t even need more maps, we have like 20. it’s better to have 20 competitively viable maps than to have more maps that are all shit. 
---
and in case you missed it, casual shows you your spawn/defensive location and now has a 3:30 timer. it’s not exactly ranked but it’s close enough. 
---
Took me a wile to understand :D
---
Normally I'd agree but
---
1. This Tat's well done by a seemingly good artist
---
2. It looks more like your standard Santa Muerte Tattoo than a gaming related one unless you made it obvious and pointed it out
---
I see you already got told what it does, but this doesn’t effect ranked does it?
---
Mira on the soft wall not the reinforced wall?
---
today
---
No it's just godawful mira placement
---
R6, Eagle Watch, and Rogue Spear were the epitome of my middle school gaming life
---
They are 2way though.
---
Remember No Russian 
---
Because they came in in Y2S3 and it's a 36 mth cycle.
---
The TTS changes DO NOT take effect until Season 2, Burnt Horizon will not be affected by this extended test period. 
---
No. The system has gone back to the old progression system. They are way easier than the Starter Edition (which is now gone).
---
Disappointing to see the same ranked pool
---
I just wanted 7 sec plant and defuse timer and no more Hereford..
---
Ok one thing I'd like to mention. My teammate on siege. Just said on offense his idea to use this. Is team kill once. Then play as fuze. Have Monty on the defuser and a fuze right above him. That way if someone comes close just set it off and Monty wont get hurt. 
---
Fair play man, do you solo que or 5 stack, I've been playing since velvet shell and while I think I'm decent enough I can't get above gold solo queing 
---
Just... No...
---
Is there someone else who like the design of mozzie, and the principal that the attacker place traps and the defender can drone!? 
---
There was a door right behind him lmfao
---
Chalet?
---
i thought fuze was from Kazakstan 
---
On the bright side, this makes Zofia’s self revive more viable.  Now you’re a 1 shot kill either way.
---
No the black Mira was placed on a soft wall when there was a (backwards anyways) reinforcement literally right next to it. Because it’s on a soft wall the attackers can easily shoot out the wall and either destroy the Mira entirely or expose her feet 
---
But they said starting season 2, so this probably still gets the 2 week treatment.
---
Good plays
---
ahahah that was my goal, to not regret it later and I obviously won't, it looks way too sick to regret it
---
Seems like a huge waste of utility to me. You sacrifice a shield for 60 dmg. Wouldnt be my choice.
---
/r/SiegeAcademy 
---
And take the new one out of ranked pls
---
what are you complaining about? the new shield looks awesome. 
---
You wouldn't fucking delete your favorite game because it's another 1gb of videos. A fucking entire 2 hour movie is 2gb when compressed. Movies used to fit on 500mb discs before bluray. Every operator could have a 2 minute video and it would be less than 120 minutes or 2gb. 
---
Square 
---

Yes. And to be precise r6 comes from Ubisoft Montréal in quebec (where they speak French)

So since I'm here, how did you get the Cav/Hibana main flare and not just one or the other?
---
Lulz from a lion main 
---
First off he is no comparison to fraggers like Ash et al. Second, NO character will Ever work as a camper on the attacking team, in fact, the one camper like him on the defending team (Tachanka, who is on the team most suited for holding angles) is so useless that he’s a goddamn meme! And making him rely on teammates for smoke would be just the thing! It means he’s Very weak when the team isn’t working together to support him, and even when they are it means he can’t go it alone, which is still a good thing that promotes team strategy.

Why lol? What’s wrong with not using a sim card 🤨

I get the sentiment, I really do, playing against smurfs can be annoying, but at the same time it’s not that big a deal. Tons of non-YouTuber players have smurfs so it’s not the following that’s the problem. Plenty of other games with even steeper learning curves have smurfing players, so it isn’t because of that either. In my opinion the problem is a lot of people’s mentality about ranked : a lot of people are scared of losing their rank and losing a game by extension, this not only invites toxicity but also stifles that persons growth as a player, since some of them refuse to blame themselves for a loss or a death, you see this a lot in YouTube comment sections, people bitching about how horrible and toxic their teammates are and how hard they have to carry. Now, the ranked system is flawed and I’m not debating that, but smurfs are not the problem. When I encounter one in a game, I won’t complain as much as if a hacker was in the lobby (still complain tho). 
---
There are two types of smurfs, the ones there to try new things out and there for the confidence boosting dopamine rush of playing a Thunt and not taking any damage, neither are problematic if they’re alone but when 5-stacking its obnoxious. I don’t feel like we should condemn smurfs, since it isn’t like other games where there’s an advantage in levelling up. I get why you don’t like it but sometimes playing against someone better than you makes you better, definitely does for me.
---
Yes, probably gona be her. The last 3 elites were glaz, blitz and hibana so a defender must come next
---
I kinda like this idea, but the i think a way to make him not a jager clone would be to make it also deal a small amount of damage ( like 10) to players running/vaulting through it, and only work once at a time with a short recharge, so it can destroy one projectile before it goes offline for around 5-10 seconds or so, then turns back on.

Metal gear reference is quality reference

To be fair when I get the chance I play as much as I can, but even watching the pro league games it gets boring when its only Border/Coastline.

45 ops 10 are American the American are already diverse themselves, line them up with the other ops there's diversity, just not enough for you because of some reason. The dev team themselves are diverse. Playerbase is diverse. Etc. Is diverse you're just whining. Thick skull
---
No it isn’t. Convolute has 4 viable bomb sites and is relatively balanced. Skyscraper arguably only has 1 or 2 and isn’t a very balanced map. Theme Park has the lighting and train room issues. 
---
Moving, yes everyone has to on the attacking team. Shooting, again yes, for the same reason. Wallhacker, that’s stupid for two reasons, one that’s not wallhacks, and two, what it is (a thermal scope basically) is exactly what he’s supposed to have.
---
What is in the pro league map pool
---
Ball elliptic without fur they use in sports like football, basketball etc. 
---
How big is it tho?
---
Even if it has the tinfoil texture inside the 6, it's pretty much unnoticable/invisible in-game, and it isn't shiny at all.
---
Aw man, sad to see you go after all those years! Good luck with the new job!

No word on the inconsistent broken sound yet?
---
They fixed Giraffemira with her no helmet headgear, but luckily the portrait is still there to remind us.
---
Yea that could work, but by moving the window it still wouldn’t be a smart decision playing behind that added cover and depending on where the defenders create the rotation from bedroom to gym, the attacker at the window could essentially cut the bedroom site in half by holding the angle. But the attacker could still shoot the wall creating the angle if the wall isn’t reinforced. And other than peeking the attacker or running out from cctv, there really isn’t any way to counter that angle. Those 2 small changes could greatly impact how that bomb site is played 
---
Thanks mate
---
This is amazing. Sometimes I’m too shy to ask someone for a signature, there’s something about wanting to start a conversation with them but being scared of annoying them.
---
This is a true piece of siege history, you’re a madlad. 
---
She's getting an elite soon so they put her remastered face from the elite onto her default operator card
---
Ok, ready, bet you wont expect this. If other countries are introduced into the game, I'd love it. I personally dont care what countries are in the game as long as their operator is balanced and unique. 
---
You stated in a previous comment that this game is about diversity. No, no it's not. It about creating a realistic tactical shooter that is unique and entertaining. That does not require diversity, or even countries at all. They could all be people shaped grey textures and that wouldnt matter for balance, just realism. 
---
If the US has a majority of different units in the world, then it would make sense that they have proportionally more ctus in game. You're all about diversity right? How about diversity proportional to real life? Differnet American ctus, different European ctus, ctus from different countries. I'm ok with that. But to claim that the country with the most powerful military in the country should be l okok mited because of "diversity" is bullshit and pushing a stupid ideology into a fantasy game based on realism. 
---
I personally would like to see more European ctus, but if America has more to offer, why shouldn't we use them? There is no problem, and you are making one.
---
What are you talking about?
---
probably should have watched the shit where this was announced myself before posting LMFAO my friend told me the deployable shield has holes in it now to make shields less viable for defenders but judging by everyone's reaction to this i am a dumb shit who's completely wrong &amp; should've found out for myself first lmao. also i'm mostly outraged atm because of the fat Lion nerf so please excuse me for not thinking, I am the true danked out helmet kid here, apologies. 🗿
---
I've tried both and I prefer simple. The biggest thing for me was that claymores in advanced have to have the button held down for the whole duration. While in simple, you press it and you set it.
---
For frost traps and valk cams I would just hold the deploy button, letting you aim and set it nicely in simple mode.
---
This makes no sense. What are you talking about? The deployable shield is completely fine. If you are talking about the holes in the shield you can't shoot through them and they are one side only like a mira window.
---
Just blitz
---
I had a similar idea but to place the device at the top of the door/window but it would be able to stop 5 projectiles and the op would only get 2 devices and called it the Portcullis. it was based off this video I saw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yz_ONZltA&amp;list=WL&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s
---
Thanks bro for making caring for us. You have done alot from cancelling the changes to the game for China and every other outrage the community had. Thank you.
---
ah mate it must be real

Lmao she's big 😂

Agree. Pic and Ban is a lot of fun however not enough maps, gets old with just ESL pool.

Yep.

Ok, now do it on PC.

bronies btfo
---
Thank you for explaining this more simply than I could.
---
Huh maybe stop pushing Loot Boxes in this game since it already has multiple ways of monetization
---
No 
---
Maybe I shouldn't have sensationalized it that much. Glad was never meant to be an operator who threw(or had someone throw) a smoke on a site/doorway/hole and have them push it to get kills.
---
  
---
Don’t fat shame her. 
---
Starter got buffed. They pay the ssme 500/1000/1500/2000 renown that standard dit back in year 0-2.
---
Made her hot
---
Its probably just for the stream since multiply countries are watching. World war II games do this for presentations because Swastikas are illegal in Germany. Normal builds of the games will still have skulls
---
She remind me of that chick from Mission Impossible Fallout
---
I prefer it as a bridge. Nothing really prepares you for ranked, other than ranked itself. Knowing where you spawn, the amount of time you have to operate, and the objective sites really change the way you play and select operators.
---
Season pass or normal seasonal uniform?

There’s no such thing as a competitive copper to begin with 
---
This is not true at all. Deployable shields were buffed as they now have mini-miras on them, so you can only see through it oneway.  You are still fully protected if you are behind it, and attackers cannot see you from the front.
---
how long did this take you? also how long did it take per

Shit he’s onto us.

No mention of operator price changes. Anyone know if it’s rolling out with Y4S1 or coming later in the year?
---
Less viable? what did you friend tell you how did he get this info? I'm guessing he saw holes in the shield didn't know why they were there and just assumed it was a nerf.
---
Learn how to teamkill without getting banned
---
He’s a lion main. Explains it all 
---
It is very noticeable and shiny in-game. Try it in a match. The menu doesn't have proper lighting.
---
Frosts has no recoil basically. Best control on gun out of all 3. Echos gun is silenced so you can roam kill but he isn't really a roamer so it is hard to find a balance sometimes since you're on drone often going back and forth. Valk is good with shotty, but her other gun is a good option too. I like Frost though because of the traps and her gun. But Valk has c4 and she is played more aggressively. 
---
Hopefully it's a BUG.
---
People are basically not going to be able to play a Mira on the right side of the closet on Oregon. This is a very good buff to him.

Well RIP
---
So that’s why Ranked is still in beta

Her portrait always looked a lot less detailed then the other ops.

precisely what im thinking, idk i should've just looked for myself first before posting but it really do b like that sometimes 🗿
---
Fooking hell 
---
For fucks sake! Literally 2 posts below yours
---
I’d sort of like to stray away from making it a trap style op, as I feel we have an abundance of those lol. My original intention WAS to be a Jager clone, or a compliment even. There are so many projectiles on offense that another op that is slightly more limited in the area it can protect, but is slightly harder to counter couldn’t be a bad thing. Especially when all three of Jager’s ads can be destroyed by one twitch drone in prep phase. 
---
I guess that's good news for that one guy who wanted Mozzie in trials rising
---
When was this said?  All i heard was "coming in year 4"
---
Damn this sounds pretty sweet. This would make Chanky a nice balanced operator. He'd still have his flaws as you pointed out, but equipping him with an ACOG will have people picking him. 
---
Oh guess i'm not making new smurfs in year 4
---
I dont get it? is it the fire rate? i have no clue since I play on console and we don't have a test server
---
Yeah a lot of guys use dump pouches.

Ok sweet, I can’t wait for these new ops!

I’m honestly really hyped. Burnt Horizon has really injected new life into the game for me. And Ubi going to hunker down on fixing a lot of issues within the game makes things all the better as well. 
---
He's an Aussie that rides a motorcycle and they named him Mozzie. Hmmmmm
---
It's always been this way. 
---
r/rant 
---
I feel your pain though, I really do. 
---
probably shouldve done a side by side but they capped her fire rate to roughly one shot a second. in this video i was trying to shoot as fast as possible
---
She is only good for flanking. How is she supposed to compete with someone with a high fire rate now? Run away?
---
I always get put with retards but against pros... I'm plat 3 too 
---
Is this what goes as music these days
---
To clarify, when you get Gridlock and Mozzie with the new update, they should already have a 'burnt horizon' uniform unlocked
---
I predict they are moving to make a community based on Skull and Bones? Though it is based on Singapore, but still its maintaining a community, which I think can be done without moving anywhere?
---
Increased damage/decreased area for defenders.
---
I use Apollo, and I don’t think I can give myself a flair on that or the reddit mobile app?
---
I could be wrong though because it has been a while since I’ve actually tried. 
---
I hope they change this style in year 4. Tired of the white/carbon fiber style
---
So grateful they’re finally bringing this functionality to ranked!
---
When you lock the entire team in the freezer
---
He even in beta had 3 barricades. Which originally could only be destroyed with explosives. They nerfed it early on allowing the melee hits and the glaz bullets to go through. Since then I cannot recall any significant changes
---
Yeah it fits much better with the current UI, but obviously this will get downvoted because it's "cencorship for the bad china" 
---
People always dislike the maps they don't know as well.

---
As a big thank you we are giving the players 10 alpha packs????
---
You didn't understand how the system works.
---
It just reverse the damage after the first teamkill. The other player IS NOT taking damage. In the clip you can clearly see the teamkiller hitting Ash in the head, and then dying while Ash is still alive.
---
Instead of trying to be the "intellectual guy" maybe you should start by knowing what you are talking about, instead of calling people names while blatantly wrong.
---
In the dev notes
---
As a patriotic American guy, I 100% agree with you. It's fucking stupid that they've added 7 thus far. This dude/lady will make 8, which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me.
---
You mean unlimited scans every 30 Seconds? I’d love that haha but would be too op. 3/4 charges and it’s a job well done imo.  To back this up if you look at dokabbi, she can ring your phone whenever and be heard through walls which takes at least 3-4 seconds (which is longer then lion) to turn off immediately, so I think 3 would be fair. 
---
Thank you 😄

Yep, basically this. Bandit tricking is basically juggling with batteries. Putting them and cancel the deployment as soon as the bar is about to reach its end. That way I don't lose any of my batteries and as soon as the EMP goes off, a battery gets on, almost instantly. Pretty impossible for Thatcher to counter me.

I was wondering the same because the promotional image under content on the store page showed icons for other ops.

The 8 Uniforms and Headgear you get are for the 8 new Operators coming with year 4 (1 headgear and 1 uniform for each). And they are separate from the Seasonal Uniform and Headgear skins.
---
 Theyre not out yet thats the joke 
---
They picked Ela not banned

I think the scope is what sets him apart, if there is smoke then he is a real threat, but now he can't round corners and entry frag on his own.

Nope that is slated to come out this year but the specific season that it comes out is not yet disclosed to us.

I was hoping they take those alpha packs out since the event is over.
---
There’s 3 different ones, normal, poison, and fast. 
---
Sorry I haven’t played in forever did they stop the 1 male 1 female rule for dlc ops?  
---
Isn't that a legit saying in Australia?
---
I think it means I'm not here to fuck around
---
That wasn't said. They said they are bringing pick and ban in, and some other aspects, but they didn't specify anything else. If you have a source that'd be awesome though, because that's exciting.   
---
Are you also saying there will only be the 7 ESL maps as well? 
---
Blitz mains on a suicide watch.
---
It’s not a nerf it’s a rework they changed a fundamental aspect of him as an operator, therefore it’s a rework. 
---
3 charges would be pretty fair
---
Even if so why pick Ela? Her guns suck asides her sniper shotgun.
---
Oh, why not just say that then? I don’t see a reason they’d go through the trouble for a minor detail like that that very few people would even know about. The cost / benefit doesn’t really line up. Unless you mean just change where the text parts of the map say it’s located, that would just be low effort imo.

gridlock’s gadget is broken. If you can cut off AN ENTIRE hallway then it prolly shouldnt be in the game. Its basically adding an entire wall to the map
---
Yeah, I agree with the point that you guys are making, but I also agree with OP to a certain extent. I don't want less American ops for the sake of diversity, I want more countries for the sake of fun and interest. You have to admit, there aren't a lot of games out there about Mexican or Danish operators lol. But all in all, I do believe this is a non issue and I really couldn't care less at the end of the day.
---
BMI doesn’t account for if you have a lot of muscle. You can be extremely fit and weight a lot, so BMI will say you are obese but you aren’t.

She’s definitely fat tho lol. Can tell by just looking but we don’t necessarily know how obese bc we don’t know the muscle.
---
Regardless, I personally find this kind of stupid, but doesn’t affect anything lol

I like the idea of Thunt and Custom games allow all ops.

Obviously, like do you not have perfect accuracy.

That might be cool but again it’s probably not worthwhile for them

For all the people who say situations are the campaign I will kill them.
---
Glaz will now only be able to have a thermal scope when he is standing still.
---
How does the change to 20 HP change anything, though? 
---
Rook armor does not allow for multiple DBNO; it ensure that you'll be put in DBNO so long as you're not headshot. This changes nothing and is not relevant to the discussion. 
---
At present, when an attacker who has been reset is dropped to 4 HP, one Maestro taser shot would kill them. After the change, this would still be the case. 
---
At present, when a defender who has been reset is dropped to 4 HP, one Maestro taser shot would kill him. After the change, this will remain the same.

---
Wtf did they do to hibana
---
Try turning off raw input in the options menu
---
What a solid argument. 
---
Even though G2 stopped using Blitz because they were losing rounds because of him lol. Noice one.
---
Beyond perfection actually... If zero shots fired, does that mean op is throwing the bullets?
---
It's because Ela's and Zofia's season got cancelled. There was an entire season that didn't come with any new ops. So they released them separately, Ela came out with Ying and Lesion, and Zofia came with Vigil and Dokkaebi.
---
I feel like they should implement something along the lines of a percentage based system. 
---
Say you lose 5 ELO per lost round and gain 5 per won round. For every player you don't have, at the start of the round, reduces ELO loss by 20%. So 3v5 you only lose 3 ELO that round, 2v5 only lose 2 ect. Likewise if you're in a 4v5 and WIN, gain an extra 20%. So would be a 6 gain that round.

How does this relate to anything?

Is anyone else really underwhelmed by the Lion rework? It's been played up like it's gonna be a huge change but it's just your ordinary nerf.
---
I agree they do need a system like that. I dont want to be tossed into games where everyones waiting on me to load in and dont even get to pick my op and then get vote kicked out. Waste of a couple minutes on mine and everyone elses time.
---
Hibana = Wokka
---
Definitely not. He gets banned a lot solely for his ability to stop pretty much any plant attempt 
---
Wait, can you already play on the test server?
---
I don’t know if you’re on console but on pc just change your name, me and all my friends use our old cod clan tag pkmn
---
My god, that looks sooo much better now. 
---
Fr holy shit
---
So im assuming you dont know what “Kappa” means. 
---
Kappa means im being sarcastic. I also dont believe blitz is op. Hes really strong but i wouldnt say hes op
---
whats putty?
---
Please tell me you do know this is completely satire and I don’t mean it 
---
Exactly why I said *SECURE* area.
---
What's your problem with this mode?
---
Oh shit. 
---
Old Hibana &gt; New Hibana
---
Disappointing, I was hoping for more story
---
I'm on ps4
---
It’s not a “truck” it’s a bushmaster.
---
No no I looked it up after you said it lmao. 
---
Who bamboozled me, which wasn’t epic.
---
Its the devil himself 
---
Of course, I'm just upset I took the time to click the thread
---
It's because this game is full of children who think they are hard. This is why we need tac realisim.
---
Caveira is way better but I have a mixed opinion about hibana
---
Well as someone who works in esports... Really nothing special.
---
Exactly 
---
I think its a good idea. I say this because (on xbox) you have to pay to change your name and i for one dont want to play 15$ just to look like a team with my friends. Theres people saying no but whats the reason not to?
---
I like it...
---
Go watch a G2 game where Pengu used Blitz and tell me he’s balanced 
---
Your not the only one upset
---
How? Because I heard if they go off right away that somebody is in the room is that true?
---
You forgot the /s brother 
---
Yeah I took a look
---
yeah some guy went and graffitied on the side “whoever threw that chair at rosie fu*k you” i can’t 
---
belive people these days 
---
r/R6STeams
---
Don't worry, the number went up to 252.
---
Now that he’s been nerfed in to the ground (and will be again in the future probably) I’d like to see the V.308 get a buff. It’s very lacklustre at the minute. An assault Vector with a slow fire rate? 
---
Fat operator lawl

Hello Spectre1-4, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about Twitch Drops.
---
Tanning goggle, the ones with those tiny holes you see through. 10/10 would be hilarious 
---
Your team got spanked

You mean always behind a cabinet on villa

You ever hear of a fucking impact grenade or c4

---
Gridlock makes noise too... she’s a 3 armor and the device makes noise I believe 
---
I didn't give a percentile, not sure why you're harping on that point.
---
But yeah, dude, it is definitely different. 
---
Top floor is basically a giant room with two small rooms inside of it, can't really be accessed from inside at all in the same way as the old Hereford, and definitely not from the outside in the same way as the old Hereford.
---
The second floor has a completely redesigned feel - instead of the *one* stairwell leadin gup into a central hub that splits into three rooms, you have two stair wells that lead up to S-tetromino type hallway that intersects between both stairwells and *four* rooms, all of which can be accessed outside [with two of them being accessed from multiple window points]
---
The first floor is probably the closest to the original, with the difference being that the garage is bigger, the hallways are longer, and there is more *shit* that hangs from the ceilings and takes up space in the respective rooms, making the overall look to be busier, providing more cover
---
And the basement just isn't even remotely the same, if you think so you're just blind, dog.
---
normally inaccuracies don't bother me, but this was pretty glaring even if you didn't know anything about guns. glad to see it got changed. 
---
But ash has no head hitbox

Tf2 R6 crossover
---
Unpopular opinion: Caveira was unbearable before work her silent step essentially removing one of your 5 most basic senses and with a silent 2 hit kill pistol at medium range made her into a super valuable fragging operator in ranked. This change puts her in her proper position of being a high risk/high reward operator who can't just get free death marks on people.
---
Spray at her head and it will hit or you can take cover and peek her...
---
Pfffff... Check out Cold Sky (Jager) and Grim Tally (Mira).
---
Just introduce a game mode just with operators up to Y3 and I don't care what horseshit will the next operator be
---
absolute unit, cunt!
---
Devs can fix games, not people 
---
I'd be fine with this as long as Echo gets a Jotaro Kujo elite skin.
---
it would actually be the greatest thing if they brought in that voice actor 
---
If I were a bad demoman I wouldn’t be sitting here would I?
---
WHEEEEZE
---
Link?
---
I would say Ying she is great for getting a defuse down and has decent guns
---
Talk about fixing what aint broke 
---
I can understand that it's daunting to try to learn all at once but that's what keeps the game new and exciting.  There is certainly an argument that could be made about map balance but I don't think the total map count should be lowered just for the sake of "too many."  I wouldn't hate to see a vote for map option but that unfortunately turns into people only wanting to ever play 1 or 2 maps.
---
Is the rework just a shorter initiation and lasting period?
---
Why would anyone develop an air gun that fires syringes?
---
Flicking is muscle memory. That’s probably what he meant by
---
Yeah this happened to me with the gingerbread skin and I put it on all guns thinking I actually owned it and I restarted the game and it fucked me over with no skin on all 40 operators 
---
That's always been the case
---
Its not an AR, it doesn't shoot NATO standardized ammonition for rifles and is therefore a carbine
---
I might as well explain this here
---
If it shoots a rifle caliber and has a barrel longer than 20 inches, it's a rifle.
---
If it shoots a rifle caliber and has a barrel shorter than 20 inches, it's a carbine.
---
If it shoots a pistol caliber and is not a handgun, than it's an smg.
---
If you convert an smg with a barrel under 20 inches to a rifle caliber, it's now considered a carbine. Not a rifle.
---
Rifles can be switched to 9mm but they're then considered carbines, I don't know why. They just are
---
Good lord this woman is 225 lbs at 5'9"?! Absolute unit.
---
Did you read the info on next year???
---
They've finally made an op for the over weight feminists that might play the game 
---
r/lostredditors
---
Ho ho ho goodddd... Glaz. Buddy. It's never the way. People love you, don't give up.
---
I agree that he needs a nerf, but I honestly think the biggest issue is the shield not being synced up with where it a appears to be. If that worked completely perfectly, than yes you could probably just shoot his shoulder/feet/hand
---
in ubisoft work lazy
---
My cargo boy Lesion looking extra smug.
---
So glad when I got mine but got kinda disappointed they don't look different. Or at the very least make Diamond more unique, maybe somewhat translucent? It looks way similar to Silver with just subtle differences. 
---
25 hours watch time out of &lt;26 hours total stream time is quite hard tbh, even if you just idle since there can be Twitch broadcast/network errors and stuff (happened to me once, glad I caught it immediately).
---
When all the roamers leave and you don't hear your barricades breaking

Lemme get uhh

So what? If you can’t play more than 3 ops on each side if not great well you need to. 
---
fuck logan paul

How do you know?

Woman will break you in half, son. Got DAM
---
The only time this is really made for is when cab goes into silent step in 90 on villa behind table. That was the soul purpose for that whole fix. I’m sure there are other places to be used like that but that’s what it will fix predominantly.  
---
What did you expect???
---
Removing it by pulling it down has always returned it to Castle
---
could you please do a old and new for every operator, thx!
---
Yes take away a huge benefit of castle, great plan. Not like you can shoot attackers trying to break it from the gap anyway smh
---
Guess what still dont have em
---
That'd be nuts
---
Her left hand looks weird
---
Contact Ubisoft then. I got mine 7-8 hours ago. 
---
You know what the consequence of dying as an op are? You fucking die. That's your punishment. No need for this stupid, "you messed up and now you can't play to your strengths for the rest of the game" bullshit

Around 3 weeks from now,because tts servers

Two attackers are banned each game.

nice

Technically, round is a shape.

damn 5 foot 9 225, thats a thicky

Bricko Mode

They are the exact same guns. Capitao’s has 100 bullets and reloads slower, Gridlock’s has a 60 round magazine and reloads faster. Now that there’s two M249s, they gave them both the scope made specifically for the M249 IRL and gave it the same zoom as ACOG. It just looks different. They both have the same recoil pattern and 650 RPM and 48 damage per shot

Motorbike operator - the ultimate roamer/rusher

Best since white noise hands down

Where did you get this data? Is there a way to view these stats for defenders?
---
Is this confirmed? If so ima be tight and wait two weeks to get dink’s instead of buying her tomorrow like I was going to
---
Get rid of the whit in the middle of castles. See how that looks.
---
Run Blitz in ranked in high elo on pc and they’ll probably play all the aids operators
---
This was painful even at the very first second 
---
''I keep Trying to flank the enemy but the clap from my asscheeks keeps giving me away!''

There's no longer an outline at all. It's more like an Alibi ping.

Lol at thinking that's camping or a hood strat that gets kills
---
The wheels on the drone are [mecanum wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel). They let vehicles go in any direction.
---
Wow the asian actually looks... asian. Capitao is still an ugly bitch though

**Mecanum wheel**
---
The Mecanum wheel is a design for a wheel which can move a vehicle in any direction. It is sometimes called the Ilon wheel after its inventor, Bengt Erland Ilon, who came up with the idea when he was an engineer with the Swedish company Mecanum AB. The US-Patent was filed on the 13 November 1972.It is a conventional wheel with a series of rollers attached to its circumference. These rollers typically each have an axis of rotation at 45° to the plane of the wheel and at 45° to a line through the centre of the roller parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel. A typical configuration is the four-wheeled one of the URANUS omni-directional mobile robot (pictured) or a wheel chair with Mecanum wheels (similar to that pictured).

we finally got a fix for Maverick's beowulf and then we get this tiny little bitch mag that clearly doesn't go together, god this looks ugly.

Thank you for your cod logic.

The day they upgrade to *anything* else will feel amazing.
