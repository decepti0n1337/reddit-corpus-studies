??? That's completely unrelated.
---
Join the group of players who are good at all ops and flexible to what the team needs. Usually the people 'maining' someone stick to casual.
---
Nice flex but OK.
---
The original map was 100x better than what we have now. A map can be unbalanced and still be fun
---
Ahaha I don't hate it that much, but I certainly have 0 good memories on it.
---
Honestly the best clip I’ve ever seen
---
Her arms and shoulders are big, but that’s really it. Her waist is pretty thin
---
People get worked up over the most obsolete things these daya
---
My god and I thought ps4 was bad
---
Yeah, because shes a woman and women have narrow waists.
---
Man happens on ps4 as well. Got home from work at 2 this morning and every match for three hours was like this.
---
Hey you play on ps4
---
The shadows aren’t gone they just removed lighting from the operator menu
---
[removed]
---
Yes, I do.
---
KronosUber is my PSN
---
How?
---
Welcome to the front page of r/Rainbow6
---
Liga is banned? ffs I don't know from other languages but at least in Spanish means "league"
---
Clash is clearly and way better than warden
---
I never said hardware doesn't matter. I said the game has issues with loading. Yes it being on an ssd can/will help, but the **game still has issues**. 
---
If the game loaded shit properly, ssd's wouldn't be a requirement.
---
Oh cool. Thx
---
Can you do a post with jackal?
---
can we get a 'to be continued' for that ending?
---
Rule 34
---
I play on 100 vert 100 hori and 50 ads and it’s easier to play on a higher sens with the xbox elite controller’s longer joystick
---
Recycled guns make so little sense. Look at ALL this debate.... to save a little code somewhere...? Or something? Ten different explanations with holes in them?
---
Now if two or more operators have recycled guns they have to be balanced across operators. If you balance one gun, it impacts someone else. That's clunky as hell. I don't get it at all....
---
Just make up a new gun "variant" if there's licensing issues. C7E "short" or some other new name. Make it look cool as hell and everyone (including me) will stop yammering about this. "Mira modified the \[insert old gun here\] and now it looks new and badass." Gun too strong and or otherwise unbalanced? Tinker with the stats or the recoil. Smoke's gun remains the same. New operator keeps cool new gun as part of their identity. This should not have been that difficult....
---
I was here before top
---
It means :
---
&gt; Others are capable of reaching their full potential more consistently and in a manner suited much better for Pro League. These operators can be flex picked to match a variety of situations more efficiently, doesn't require the enemy team making mistakes in order for me to obtain openings, and have better fittings for the meta.
---
The game is so hard stuck in Info Meta, an operator that usually requires perfect placement, and terrible misplays by the enemy team is not consistent enough to be anywhere near a meta pick.
---
  
---
what does all that mean tho?
---
She's bad for pro league
---
Jesus fucking Christ please no. This shit was in Black Ops 4 and it was terrible.
---
Your profile pic is connor right
---
No, I’m not
---
If she was fat her body would look like that. She has clearly defined waist and chest. Her arms are big but it clearly isn’t fat. She has big thighs but it isn’t as flabby as fat would be
---
I'm too broke for the elite lol
---
It seems harmful to suddenly be introduced to a new map after a month of being used to old ones. Also, who plays casual for that long without tasting ranked. It's gonna be harder to learn ranked when you dunno the maps.
---
Literally just bring a friend and talk a lot in game chat, scares away most of the toxic kids once they know you have a buddy and aren’t afraid to speak up. Least in my experience

That's what I'm saying. There are unfortunately plenty of women out there as big as gridlock, but I've never heard of one having the sheer muscle mass as well.

Hell yeah, im in! add me, I play EAS,

It was time for thomas to leave
---
he has seen everything
---
hmm is this eris morn
---
Oh god, terrorist hunt is ridiculously toxic, or it used to be anyway I don’t matchmake anymore on it
---
I run siege with a rtx 2060 and amd ryzen r7 2700x with 16gb of ram and I get 144fps while on max settings at 1920x1080 and vsync enabled.
---
Well the ending doesn’t go very well for me but I’ll post the whole clip now lmao
---
&gt;It being on an ssd doesn't matter. I know the community likes to think it does, but it doesn't. 
---
You literally said that it doesn't matter, which is incorrect and you are spreading misinformation.
---
Capitao/caviera will drop to 10k
---
Lesion/ying/zofia will drop to 15k
---
Maverick/clash will drop to 20k
---
House and Plane are my favorite maps in this game. I hope they get blessed by the reworks
---
All I said was that her waist was thin, which it is. I didn’t say all women have narrow waists
---
It's been around for a while, but I'm not sure what causes it.
---
I love this video because I’m told I get very loud and into this game and it doesn’t help when I am easily frightened tell your friend he’s great
---
Yeah well I’ve never played black ops four I’m sorry that I annoyed you
---
Wait what have they done to glaz? I just started playing again after leaving in Blood Orchid.
---
F
---
After he finished teabagging that asshat he did lol
---
Of course paid lore isn't a real issue. You don't play Siege for fucking lore and if you do the you're just plain dumb. Obviously majority of the community agree with the fact that this BP isn't an issue, even the most critical personalities don't give two fucks about it. Even REDDIT barely gives a shit about it, and Reddit is known for being full of cry baby shit kids. I may not decide what a real issue is but it's very, very clear that this isn't a real issue. Has any progress been made on this BP "issue"? No. That Chinese shit was an issue, it made the game plain stupid so as soon as that shit dropped it was shut down very quickly. 
---
 
---
Fair enough. It is kinda bs to pay to unlock the grind but it's still a fantastic way to reward grinders for little money. 
---
Gambling is annoying. Especially at the rip off price that Ubisoft put it at but that still doesn't change the fact that you don't need it to enjoy the fucking game. So why in the hell is it an issue apart from the fact that you really wanna prissy up your character but don't wanna support the devs? Really just sounds like you're being greedy alongside the devs. 
---
I didn't sugar coat shit. Honestly makes no sense to me how I'm part of the problem. Is it because I value gameplay over cosmetics so I don't pay any attention to something I don't need to waste my time on? How the fuck was anyone supposed to know that skins for £2 was gonna escalate to £2 for a small chance for the best gun in the game? It's just stupid to complain about something that's not that big of a deal just incase something that is a big deal happens later. 
---
I didn't even know that BO4 charged for a red dot reticle because I don't use the store ever. It's ridiculous and it's a rip off but that's all it is. Main issue is the very low chance to earn guns for a price, that's called P2W, something only F2P games should have. 
---
60$ is not cheap but it's cheap in relevance to what you get out of the game. Over time that 60$ spent matters less and less because of the time:money. No matter how rich or broke you are, you can't deny that Ubisoft gave us one hell of a deal with R6 yet you're here still demanding changes because it gives them too much money. And no, my dad doesn't just buy me shit I have to save for things. I hate that you make that shitty assumption just because I look at the value of things rather than the price. 
---
And what if it's another way for them to earn money? It's not like they're farming the players for cash unlike Activision. You really do have something against businesses, don't you? 
---
No it's not. And Siege is not coming to that point. Why are cosmetics so fucking important to you? If Siege ends up putting gameplay related shit in the BP or for money in general then I'll take back EVERYTHING that I've said but, is that really gonna happen? Probably not. So why does it actually hurt you so much to miss out on dressing up your characters? 
---
And yes I was hypocritical for that last bit. Very stupid of me and I apologise for that.
---
Don’t care to much what people think and don’t apologise for ideas. 
---
Maybe for someone of your posts add the attack and defence so people dont see what u put as biased
---
Following the pattern from last season, a new batch of Operators will see a price decrease in Season 3. Capitão and Caveira’s prices will now be 10,000 Renown or 240 R6 Credits. Ying, Lesion and Ela’s will come down to 15,000 Renown or 360 R6 Credits, while Maverick and Clash’s prices will decrease to 20,000 Renown or 480 R6 Credits. Kiad will be next season if you’re willing to wait.
---
Thank you I always do try to be original with my ideas I think they all are but I’m not sure maybe some one out their
---
You mean "Damage 999"
---
Yeah thanks man I will
---
I will translate (i think he means; sorry hard to translate over to English) 
---
I love you
---
The money on the desk made me feel broke stop flexing😭
---
I can tell the difference between high sens and mnk by the movement and lean/crouch nature. There's always a chance that it's still a controller but its hard to do the same movements as a keyboard on a controller. Not to mention the pure aim capability. There's a difference between aiming fast and aiming extremely precisely and controlling recoil really well.
---
F 😭
---
HEY, no bullying carlos in ma shed 
---
*slap* BAKA
---
I do not, but full roster only requires 'all original operators' to unlock, 10 rounds of each, I'm guessing that's sas, FBI, spetnaz, gign and whichever the other ctu is (I know I have it unlocked but the name evades me) I also have all year 1 operators but I think that's irrelevant in this case
---
I'm actually really happy for it. I'm trying to get my friends into it and it's overwhelming for new players to learn the game mechanics while learning 20+ maps.
---
Newcomer isn't an option unless I want to smurf.
---
I play Rook how I wanna play Rook: give armor and anchor
---
Welcome buddy
---
That was my bad. I usually think of zofia as ash 2.p
---
This is some top tier shit my man, keep it up.
---
Was bored so I was rewatching some videos from R6's Youtube and I came across them going over Vigil's, but one of the pictures resembles a lot of the current Nook's design. Thought it was interesting and decided to share.
---
Yep I'm new to the game and I accidenatly killed my team mate not knowing their was shock drones and I instantly got messaged being called a noon and retard
---
Bruh, tf are you talking about
---
Some skins are randomly priced. A common skin often costs more renown than an epic
---
Someone on your team was ddosing
---
Yeah I think so mate. It’s still good though i wasn’t trying to be a dick
---
One in the chamber. All you need.
---
Still don't understand the point of removing maps and rotating maps when I could just go into matchmaking preferences and set it however I want. Maybe I want to play one specific game mode and map, or maybe I want to play everything bc it's casual and I just wanna goof off and play some siege. Either way I feel that's more of a player decision that a Ubi one, but with a game that has like ten years worth of shit planned out I'm sure there's going to be a lot of changes to come that I will love/hate so I guess we just gotta see where it goes
---
Damnit beat me to it
---
Any reason why you say that?
---
#fuckin nerd
---
I want a cardboard skin and headgear now
---
If you play ranked mozzie vigel or zofia cuz i dont really see them get banned often
---
Ah ok sounds fair. I wasn’t only asking as I’m not sure on the definition myself
---
More like self destruct
---
All good man. Thanks. Got any tips for me?
---
Console servers at their finest.
---
Underrated? Tachanka. The problem people have with him is that he is stationary, and by proxy an easy target. However, the turret is MOBILE and can be moved, so if your teammates know where a push is coming from, you can easily pack up and move. Combined with his deployable shield, he is easily fortified from one direction against everything except explosives.
---
Speaking of explosives, underrated attacker? Fuze. The problem is that no one realizes his potential for trapping an area. Everyone immediately wastes the cluster charges trying to breach a room, when instead, they could be left on hatches above a site, or in a crucial choke point to trigger a trap and take out unsuspecting roamers. His shield also makes for a crude defense for teammates, he's not Monty or Blitz by a long shot, but he is a better recruit.
---
Always makes me cringe when people accuse anyone of hacking on console. Like I used to do that when I was a kid on COD. And the kids don't believe you when you tell them you literally can't hack on console
---
What's wrong with the picture as is?
---
Ancient fucking repost, this was around at the start of grim sky, maybe even when it was just in the tts
---
Highly recommend trying again, typically it’s not nearly as bad as casual, save for the couple of games that are inevitably going to happen.
---
Spoken like a true rook master
---
Yeah that’s the worst. House was the first map I ever learned at heart and that’s one of the reasons why I love it. The worst part is I know ubi won’t listen to us and not do this map rotation for casual thing. You have the newcomer playlist for new players, so the “making the game friendlier to new players” thing is BS.
---
As a person just coming back from siege after a year+ break, a single new map will confuse me the whole time for a few matches anyway. Newbies will have to learn the maps either way and I don't think reducing the amount they're exposed to will help an awful lot. Actually, there is a queue for players under level 50 already with a small rotation, so why also reduce the amount of maps in the mode with a mix of all skill levels?
---
Copyright infringement?
---
The buff we need
---
Change sens if you have too, play different ops and stick with ops you excel with, and ofc thunt.
---
When the Tachanka glitch was out where any 3 armor could become a 3 speed I would tk anyone who did it. No guilt whatsoever
---
Yee. Welcome, that’s just about it
---
Phrased differently, “I’m a fucking dick”
---
I would love to see this
---
Can u look at my recent clip in my page and tell me if u think it’s mnk or controller
---
But did you win the game?

Baby rook mains remind me of baby Dwight players in Dead By Daylight.
---
lol yeah I mean she is pretty much just ash 2.0
---
I wanna save up for a computer for many reasons, and console toxicity is a big one.
---
Recently been playing with a guy who knows what he’s doing with castle and it works really well. He’s a decent player all round but his communication and how he uses castle really gives us an edge in ranked
---
This is probably due to the free weekend
---
Oh god. Nothing worse than over sensitive controls
---
These were created by another user like last year. 
---
Why are these getting reposted again?
---
Happy Cake day friend !!!!
---
They were all unranked and I had a plat 2 on my team of should be golds so that sounds like it
---
Yea but all that with 1k+ ping the whole time though? Yep I get it
---
Mute's already good tho
---
Good Idea still
---
Oh, so soon™
---
It’s bs for that team but only got 2 mmr they probably lost that much
---
I wish this garbage would stop
---
Zofia
---
Whoa I didn't even realize! Thanks!
---
I dont know man, Im slowly trying to come back to the game but I may just quit again due to the toxic chat Ive experienced these last few days. I just had a game in which all 5 of the enemy team were spewing racist remarks, calling me n***** by spelling it out letter by letter, making derogatory remarks, and calling me poor because 'my friends arent millionares' simply because of my name. Its sad.
---
Thanks snapped him off the face of earth
---
I’ve always thought that Nøkk was Vigils sister because we don’t know what either look like, but we can see in Nøkk’s bio that she looks very similar to someone’s father, and that the familial resemblance is strong.
---
Can we please stop posting this please
---
My god you’re evil
---
Fuck tower
---
If twitch drones were that big, they'd be terrifying. however a lot harder to use.
---
From what we know in an official art she has long black straight hair I'll link it when I get home if I don't forget
---
I would by this just to hang it up on my wall
---
I could use a team more than anything. Going alone is just the fucking worst
---
"The drone weighs 30 pounds now, it can kill defenders simply by dropping on them"
---
plus it's *so many layers*. the defender vest just keeps all that heat in your chest lol
---
You’re the one making it seem like a big deal, you’re in your head, no need to stress over the game, just a better group to play with than casual where people take breaks to be toxic.
---
3 speed and 3 armour with a skeleton key
---
That’s Russian gear for ya, keeping ya warm
---
I would like to see it because I sure haven't
---
#WHAT!
---
Well, I normally stay on site and bandit trick but if you’re going to roam place your stuff down and only bring a nitro if you can stay alive
---
Wait what’s happening I haven’t played siege in a month
---
Yeah giving points for doing things that only benefit you will encourage bad things such as people team killing to get the ace
---
Most random people on ranked are pretty bad too but try to find dome people of the same rank and even if they’re just as bad at least they’ll make calls and make you a better player.
---
Well he was armed and certainly dangerous had to be done I’m sorry

Get good
---
I didn't know about the Valk cams cause I play Valk and even with the shark, my cams never clipped. Vigil, I also never saw that and I experimented with stuff like that cause one of my friends mains him but the static wouldn't reach out like that.
---
Maybe it's cause I'm on console but I'm pretty sure these things were exact copies.
---
I know updating is realistically, impossible but I mean like overhaul it more. There is definitely ways they could improve the engine.
---
That might have worked on console, but if someone had Clash they would probably also have their sensitivity at like 90
---
Like fr they just kept running like it was the beaches of freaking Normandy
---
Agreed that Nøkk needs a better gun and the mp5sd would be good but without acog because i dont want another 3 speed acog roaming the servers like they have in the past. But that gun would be nice!
---
I'm so happy someone actually credited artwork right for once on this sub 
---
really cool drawing btw
---
wait what’s happened?
---
That monitors gon crush your xbox
---
I’ve got to work on my bandit tricking. I might just mute all of my teammates when that happens because they are always so loud😂
---
No
---
I can’t draw even draw stick figures, well done!
---
I had the same problem this weekend the best solution is to just play like you dont care. When you’re frustrated you over complicate things to try and make up for it and just make it worse.
---
He literally could of just broken it lmao still rlly funny tho
---
That’s a good friend
---
Wait try are actually removing my favorite map
---
What, because there’s no toxicity in ranked?
---
Casual is salty but more open. I like having longer rounds and I also like not having to play up to nine rounds with the same goofs. If I run into toxic, at least it’s brief, especially with the new TKing mechanics. Play a few rounds, win some lose some, easy bite sized chunks. 
---
I dislike ranked because of just different tastes.
---
I'd say in general 4 YouTubers you wanna watch. To get a handle of the game.
---
 Rogue9 gets into the hard numbers, what gun does how much damage, the damage drop off, recoil of guns etc. 
---
Coreross does a "Mythbusters" series which shows gadget interactions, like how one gadget applies to another. Does an emp nade stop C4 mid air, can an impacts destroy emp nades, can a Jager ADS stop crossbow bolts, stuff like that. 
---
Get_Flanked has great high skill level opinions and game play along with providing strats for certain maps. 
---
Gregor has comedy type operator videos, he's more jokey but I think the videos are a good representation of the operators
---
I had someone  kill me while I was pointing a rifle at the ceiling.   In the kill cam the rifle was parallel to the ground.
---
I finally found a main that represents my life :D
---
Yatch
---
Im sad to see plane go. Its my favorite map.
---
Definitely will check them out!
---
They are going into a rotation of maps the casual rotation will change monthly
---
I’m pretty sure killing all five enemies helps out your whole team. Also players will play for the ace regardless of if they get extra points.
---
Because we want to prevent invisible operators and Clash shooting from her shield if possible.
---
I mean he's not saying you can't play whatever you like, he's only stating that some guns are straight up better than others. I don't think that's a outrageous claim.
---
Ash, back when the game first started
---
It’s an ego massage for those who have poor self esteem cause there not good enough to play those at their level
---
He's balanced because he's gadget has a plethora of counters and no logical person thinks his gun is 'broken'. That's really it.
---
A whole new meaning to the word wallbanging
---
I get that, but I also can't name an operator who has such an immense amount of fragging power.
---
OMG YES HOW COULD I FORGET. I hadn’t played since launch and this was when ela just came out (back when she had impacts as well)and my friend who convinced me to play told me “just play ela she’s op you’ll be fine” and I kid you not very first round 4k on theme park with that monster
---
This post hurts my soul
---
Wait what's going on?
---
Re-read. “At least more so than Nook”. Cav isn’t an essential pic but she’s better than nook. Why are you so mad?
---
No i know that but I'm wondering if the favela rework will happen next year im a huge fan of it and have missed it dearly
---
What if his neighbours were r6 fans?
---
First of all there’s no way you’d need millions of renown. Second are you talking about the Y1 operators like buck, caveira etc or the original base game operators like Ash?
---
Oh I get you, it's actually aids. I love getting bent over and my cheeks clapped by plats and diamonds in casual. It's sooooooo fun.
---
I'm sorry... I didn't even know what it did lol
---
Is it possible he was already down and after killing the last person he completely died?
---
House is getting killed off ?
---
Year 5?
---
Hey, you gotta secure that 6 kill ace
---
Somehow, I knew this was going to happen.
---
Friend pulled this off earlier tonight. I died peeking Mira :/
---
Got the same one just two nights ago!
---
Other than the Vector, can you name a better one?
---
32 damage 900 ROF without much recoil, is super strong. Pair that with a 3 speed and you have a monster
---
I do this all the time in casual. I have over 1700 hours and I find it hilarious to the least amount of helpful things possible
---
fake tachanka, a real tachanka wouldve mowed the grass with lmg rounds
---
Translation: No problem, good luck, newbie
---
notices nokks bulge\*  uwu whats this?
---
Ash, Jackal, Twitch, Mozzie, Alibi. All have at least one great gun with minimal recoil, most have good gadgets, all are at least a 2 speed leading to decent mobility.
---
Congrats, you did better than me. My first black ice was for the G 36
---
I lost year 2 and 3 ops recently and I just bought the ultimate edition because it was on sale but other than that I believe it’s only with renown which daily challenges and weekly Ubisoft club challenges would help a lot
---
Thank God I hated this map
---
The first time I tried to do newcomer it didn't que for 20 minutes so 🤷‍♂️
---
Also it's CASUAL, not RANKED, so people should chill.
---
416-c has better damage feels more controllable so that’s just as good if not better also on 3 speed
---
She would most certainly be blonde for one
---
I understand, but I just thought it was kinda random lol.
---
I have a clip of me in Y1 during jackal mira release using ash and just being a copper right (I only played for like 2 weeks after release and didn’t have a mic so stopped playing.) but man it’s just the wrong way to play ash if I knew how to upload clips on mobile id show you you’d laugh so hard especially if you used to be an ash main
---
Lord Tachanka I don't feel so good...
---
Anybody know what the song is?0
---
Maestro's LMG with ACOG. Kaids shotgun. Potentially the MP5 for it's no recoil and ACOG. Jager's 416-C.
---
Hopefully you can find better matches see that I was team killed today because I felt like playing glaz and what I assume is that the buck thought I was a free weekend player
---
3 losses tonight all 3-0 all had at least 1 diamond who way carried their team.
---
Go to the r6 sub reddit of on mobile you’ll click the three dots at the top and click “change user flair”
---
Dominic!
---
I was expecting them to shoot a dick onto him
---
Me and my bois try to help the new guys.
---
Well Nøkk hasn’t had her rounds in pro league yet so we don’t know how or how not relevant she is yet (in pro league only) I agree in normal play cav is far better, also didn’t at all mean to sound mad
---
Indeed
---
Legend, thanks.
---
Oh rip lol
---
It’s a great gun, but one of many. I think the clip size keeps it fair as well.
---
Tachanka lost some weight... looking good
---
Wait what about clash's  shield it would allo the op to be o defence too.

Oh yeah that’s another one everyone called me toxic for being a dokaebi main back in the day because the smg 12 was broken but I liked using her because I have bad aim I genuinely wanted to hack the cameras and get intel lmao
---
That’s what sledge is for?
---
oof
---
Lol
---
No it isn’t. Newcomer is meant for newbies to learn the game using a smaller set of commonly played maps, as stated by Ubisoft. It has very little to do with teaching newcomers about ranked itself. 
---
There is also a Ranked playlist that is actually unranked and is supposed to teach about ranked.
---
You misread the patch notes.  The penalties are for leaving the new unranked mode (or ranked), not for leavoing casual.
---
Sadly 90% of games on console
---
I like the 416 but I think the MP7 dominates because of its ROF. 32 damage sounds low but I don't think any other gun with a fire rate like that has so much damage, but maybe Lesions? I dont remember
---
I'm 90% sure there's a operator bundle by year that you can buy with R6 credits
---
Ah well level 91 is slightly above that
---
Exactly what I was thinking about
---
i’m not gonna waste my time over an internet argument. if you don’t have something useful or helpful to say just don’t say it i guess? i don’t know if i am being clear enough...
---
Commit, thats it, you just gotta go for it. I have done this once, and I won't do it again, its one of the hardest challenges for a video. Literally took me 2 weeks to get enough footage.
---
Nosferatu!
---
Try to go for downs instead of kills, aim for the feet and just hammer the downed guy. Another thing that works is just rushing objective and clearing it and then just stand at the entry points and wait for roamers to come back. Basically just be really aggressive. Try running shotgun/smg11 that helps getting downs.
---
Warden is looking at you concerned
---
Nice
---
Literally the only reason I'm getting an L30 instead of an AA AR15 50
---
It was a smash bro inv
---
I've almost rage quit the game a few times from the asshole randoms that you come across in Casual. I've literally joined a match mid game before and they instantly tried to boot me, before I even entered the map.
---
Another time, an entire gang all chose Recruit and I went ahead and picked my regular guy. They put me down like a dog.
---
I could go on for a while about the awful times I've had with Siege so far.
---
Buuuut, damn, it's a tight ass game and more often than not, I have a blast with it.
---
"I can do so much more. SO MUCH MORE! And this is what I get... "

---
Fuck me mate, you are part of the problem. Also excuse me for wanting to play with a friend
---
You’re misunderstanding me, her design and the design for this concept of vigil are based off of the danish frogmen, they didn’t make her from this concept art.
---
Better idea: hold a cooked grenade
---
wow

That was my second black ice (out of two) i have mutes mp5 black ice as well

I would pay $1000 to see this

---
Unmuted for sound. Was not disappointed.
---
it hurts but not as muhc as not owning the raybo sex seeje unipeg cherm bcas too muc renow :(
---
Ya need to drone more. Especially on rank, never go into a room that you havent droned in. 
---
Even if its the dumbest room/area possible for a defender to be in drone it out.
---
It was a limited time thing from last year's Halloween event. It wasn't a bundle you had to get the headgear and uniform from special halloween alpha packs that you can only buy with real money.
---
The AK12 is the best gun but it's on a 1 speed attacker with a generally bad gadget so Jackal is the next best thing.
---
The fact that if he disconnects after he bought items although he never left spawn the remake is not happening.
---
The Chad cave
---
I mean Ubi IS changing the operator menu next season.
---
Go into settings make sure mic is whatever your mic is called you might need one of the split cords i dont know the name of
---
So this is the new rework?
---
More reasons to not play ranked
---
the breach charges I feel give her position away a lot and she'd be better with smoke grenades, I highly believe her speed will increase, her ability will last for way longer and her FMG-9 might have her damage increased although you can't buff it without buffing it for smoke.
---
the MP5SD or PDW9 won't hurt but ubi won't do it and even with a better gun she'll still won't be picked because her ability is terrible.
---
Ah the good ol days
---
NOOOOOOOOOOO
---
The lighting is more consistent now. In the start of the game they had more intense lighting with a lot of dark areas and really blight sunlight. 
---
Problem is on a competitive shooter this added random elements into the game where attackers can see the inside better and the defenders just see the sun outside. Or defenders proning in really dark areas to hide.
---
So we’re getting isis as an anti terror team?
---
What’s happening?
---
Looks nice, you should do another one but with it fading slowing into nothing.
---
You do realize this bundle has existed for a long time?
---
Yea i have time to go to Chanka's home, worship him, go back and still didnt put all of my jammers
---
sarah fisher with an authentic looking shockboi and a famas f1 rifle.
---
Memeing, I have a headset, chill out your dick is huge my bad
---
When?
---
Yeah I feel you but sadly it's part of the game. Spawnpeekers can be beneficial for either team. Either the attackers don't drone out the peeker and they get picked off, or the attacker spots them and gets a easy pick beginning of the round. And luckily you never have to worry about this specific spawnpeek because they put debris in that area to prevent this specific spawn wipe method
---
Gotta love twomad
---
Thanks ! :D
---
the spam lean, spam crouch, and spam wasd is an old technique used only by the most skilled bandit mains.       so what im saying is... ITS A FUCKIN USELESS TECHINIQUE

im not a farmer, i just have alot of hoes. credit to farmer dils in his twitch bio
---
People get me wrong wow, i did not mean that it was his fault he was teamkilled nor that it was a good deed by his teammate to teamkill him. I'm sorry to hear that that a lot of players are offended by my commemt altough it wanted to be cynical about "sins". I have played around 1250 hours and I was only banned for teamkilling twice. Once by my friend running in front of me twice. I am not a toxic person and I hate see toxicity so I am genually sorry if you misunterstood me.
---
I dont even have an real life friend who plays siege.....didn't know that was a thing lmao.

listen the ez champion rank is running tachanka and rigging his turret into a mobile turret. he’s the only way to get out of copper 5
---
No I didn't. OP literally said multiple times he uses mouse &amp; keyboard. You must not of read many comments.
---
Basically homeless has an account like that too. :P
---
No I don't cause I really don't care
---
Fuckkkk, acog on jager... those were the days
---
Not exactly l, everyone but tachanka has elite skins, yet tachanka still showed that old tech still beats out new tech from time to time
---
Would you mind telling me what a fragger is?
---
Where did u get the mask?
---
It triggers me how people still make posts about this because they are too lazy to do any research. They fill this subreddit up with their tears and it gets really tedious really quickly.
---
Nice. Toxic. Days.
---
i also think part of the problem is noone wanting anything to do with the monty main

Super toxic days

Glad it's gone tbh

If i remember corectly R-9 made a research and find out that you can shoot with about 400 RPM with pistol. WITH 60+DMG. FFS, R6S dev team, nerf pistols.

I've yet to run into new players.

Chanka is a Red Army member who constantly buys old ussr tech to role play... something tells me he doesn't view anything as Holy Land.

"A REALLY BIG FUCKING COFFEE COMING RIGHT UP"

Really nice the only problem i can see at first glance are the fingers it looks like they are missing a jew joints
---
Yeah i tend to run angled any time i can manage the recoil. However I've never really tried it with echo, I'll try it next time.
---
this game is so realistic...
---
This is why jager lost his ACOG
---
They tried her with one when they were testing her out with pros and it was too strong, You can't have Nokk have a better gun with an ACOG people are forgetting she holds her primaries over her arm and that custom animation would be hard to alter with a completely new gun.
---
a defender gun they could give her as most don't have an ACOG, some people have suggested Mozzie's commando and Bandit's MP7 although they're very strong guns.
---
What they should have done before she was announced was give her Ash's G36C or Finka's spear 308.
---
Now you there sir should shut your piehole before you say something ypu regret ;)

Ok well sorry if that insulted you

look at my newer deagle

During free weekend do you gain access to all ops and all cosmetics (except elites)?
---
He’s free, I’m thinking of getting Mira but I don’t know if she’s good or not
---
Ye just get another one. Everyone in my family has a Samsung (I have an iPhone) and had different models over the years. When mine broke, I literally went and looked for an old Samsung charger, removed the cable and it works like the original. You can’t tell me you don’t have a single spare Samsung charger in your house. 
---
If you do, buy a Samsung charger instead of a PS4 cable from GameStop. It’s way cheaper
---
Sledge
---
Wait until you are level 100+... Either you kill me and match will start 5vs4 to your benefit, or I kill you and attacker will be in disadvantage. It's part of the game, learn where the windows are and when leaving your cover have your acog ready.
---
Did they remove house from rotation? I mean good but also man I love that map
---
Well i like .aestro because hes weapon is very good and gadget is ok or lesion cause he is also prettygood op
---
What having it or removing it?
---
That was absolutely disgusting.
---
Damn. 
---
Well thanks for the offer!
---
Valkarie
---
I’m not sure what rank you are but if you’d play against Koreans you would be very thankful that map is gone.
---
No problem, offer still stand tho information wise. I can also ping bully ;)
---
What ping would u have on eu?
---
Also what operator should I start with?
---
As in easy to learn
---
Those weren't competitive matches, those were ranked matches. Next season ranked will be as close to comp as I think we'll get.
---
Why is it so satisfying to watch ..I already went thru it like 5 times .
---
They didn’t want you to barricade that wall. 
---
Guess where will the enemies come from, and kill all of you, and you’ll lose? Guess who they’ll blame for *not fortifing that wall* ?
---
That's an attacker
---
Y no puedes decir puta, esq no me jodas, a lo mejor estamos en una ranked contra unos españoles, y le dices "que jo puta xD" y ala a mamarla con la censura.
---
Por no hablar de que antes no podias decir negro y te baneaban por decir "me ha tocado un hielo negro"
---
I’m a little sad I never saw Jaeger acog. I joined after they removed it. And that gun looks beautiful with it
---
I have mira, but i must confess tjat actually its better to buy aledge or season pass
---
You got Delux, so all the vanilla ops should be available to you which is good. You should also start out with enough credits to buy 2 dlc ops (maybe just one). So here's some follow up questions:
---
Is this your first shooter?
---
Aggressive, defensive, or support?
---
wait for the new season and then buy mozzie ^^
---
Last year Tumblr banned porn in general which included nsfw artworks. However it back fired greatly because a huge chunk of Tumblr users were there for adult contents.
---
The ban also banned and censored bunch of artists works due to bad coding. 
---
Long story short Tumblr lost a massive number user base and many artists left to use Twitter instead. 
---
Tumblr just got sold to Verizon at less than 1% of the price it took to purchase. Which is over several million dollars loss apparently.
---
Also like 150 to 200 lol
---
But is that necessarily a thing everyone wants?  If we wanted to be pro league peeps, we’d pursue that. Maybe it’s best to keep ranked and competitive separate
---
Ye I know how that looks like...That's me
---
Good luck man, we’re here if you have any questions
---
So this game is suppose to replicate proleague play for the 99.9% of players that will never be good enough to compete at that high of a level. What sense does that make. Or are you trying to say something out
---
Omg. This is everything I needed and more!
---
I used to play f-for- a battle royale game
---
I play csgo a lot so I have basic understanding of movement, communication and pushing.
---
But I'm more of a support character. I'm always the healer in mmo's

Tip: Never use rook's shotgun.
---
Also: Play newcomer.
---
I think its just year 1 ops now. No vanilla ops.
---
Ahaha yes, do this all the time. Very nice
---
Proud of ya fellow Maestro
---
i seriously hope this is sarcasm..
---
Please do this, for the love of god. It really says about your operator when using the sidearm as your primary is actually a viable option. Muzzle brake for the Deagle was honestly one of the only good things to come out of this update imo.
---
Screen record it and upload it to youtube then link Ubisoft to it on their contact page (I believe theres a section for cheaters). Even if no reply at least if they get spammed enough with reports they may listen
---
There’s no video on the post my friend
---
Basically homeless did a video about it and summing it up no, its too uncorfotable that u could even get a headache
---
Stop being a pussy how about that. Just fucking mute them if they're making you bawl your eyes out by calling you names.
---
Ubi has to do something about throwing in ranked and griefing in general. Chat toxicity has already been solved. Just mute them.
---
I agree^
---
Tk and toxicity is a lot less common in ranked. Or simple solution. Play with a squad.
---
Alright, get yourself on Doc or rook, for defense, read up on VALK for a possible defending OP to buy. 
---
For attack, Dokkebi, jackal, or finka to buy, play thatcher or thermite until you can buy.
---
All of those ops are very good starting Operators where you can basically do no wrong.
---
Wouldnt that be true for all maps
---
Ranked should mirror competitive play, end of story. If you want to play casual maps then play casual.
---
They made Vanilla ops free to everyone not starter a while ago. Did they reverse that?
---
First Hereford now House. *This is outrageous, it's unfair*
---
Read my other comment
---
Lawbringer or centurion
---
If only that was on pc :/
---
IMO, Bandit.
---
Hey this looks just like my regular ping
---
The soft mmr was introduced end of last season.
---
Don't pummel the hostage with several shotgun shells
---
yeah you can really see him trying to squeeze in with the group but being isolated, sad
---
It's still fairly good but without it getting tighter as you fire you are better off just ADSing and trying it hit targets that way.
---
Alr
---
Okay, but I’ve gotta be honest I don’t see it as particularly difficult to defend especially with the bulletproof half walls of tea room and the cornerstone of the Geisha Room. As for work office should definitely try castling off the double door makes it a lot more segmented and facilitates less kills from rappels on the window. That or peek the rappelers from tea room.
---
When the new season launches I believe there will be a free 7 tier pass then the season after that there will be the fully fledged one
---
Chill out bruv, why this much rage?
---
I'm asking about a specific type of battle pass, not your normal grind for skins/cosmetics.
---
Sorry but this is just one of the projects I have to work on so it is still incomplete.
---
Good news is in the near future I will release a beta and post it here.
---
Yeah, it happened to me in a 2-2 match. Luckily I was defending so we won because of the time limit
---
Did ubi mention this specifically? I'm outoftheloop for a while, since I stopped playing.
---
thats so good
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Your wording made it seem like they were taking away acogs for all 3 speed attackers, Capitao actually got an upgrade since the Scope is a better optic than the ACOG.
---
When you are too lazy to draw the other half.
---
New leaked buff
---
Yo i hope you enjoy rainbow six siege, people like that castle will most of the times be fucking destroyed by tk’s if they keep fucking around, don’t worry you’ll get better sooner or later
---
I said that they didn't remove if it was balanced, but it's ok.
---
Nobody expects the Tachanka inquisition!
---
between those two, I think it's just a matter of personal preference. They both have good, interesting victory animations and they are very detailed.
---
I will say one thing though, don't buy the elite skin if you feel like that operator is losing it's spark. This is in many ways, either you just can't play well with them anymore, or you feel a bit nerf coming.
---
Look at Glaz and his Elite for example. When Glaz elite came out, everyone was like, 'yo that's mad I'm buying that' and then he gets hit with the biggest nerf he has ever had.
---
U had one job and forgot to do it.
---
-5€, it's minus because you give me the money.
---
Definitely lesion, but he's my fave defender so I'm pretty biased
---
I don't think you can run siege.
---
Agreed.
---
Forgive my ignorance then. I never noticed. 
---
I was just checking something tho, could you explain me the below:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/fIvmWeM](https://imgur.com/a/fIvmWeM)
---
In this particular case, the season Burnt Horizon ended at 1476 MMR. 1476 + 2500 = 3976 / 2 = 1988.
---
How is the highest mmr 1730? Am i missing something?
---
i have been playing for 2yrs and have 0 black ices
---
I guess the people are done playing on TTS that ubisoft didn't release anything further in the TTS . I may be wrong

Spawn peaking is for cunts

I played it for three months and I changed my graphics card and then this
---
Yes but I don't get what is fun about that. I litterally cannot understand it. And pay for that? Phew...I don't get people I guess
---
Yeah after someone posted a photoshopped Nokk with a MP5SD yesterday, which was one off the top posts, I'm sure it's just you.
---
Swipe it back, this will not allow you to play fine without burning out.
---
I'm glad the clip ended with a happy end
---
Makes sense. I just need that happy 16 digets number on the front of your card, the happy 3 digets on the back and the brotherly numbers with a slash in the middle
---
Why what happened to it?.. havent played in a while
---
I am a G then lmao
---
Thats the picture that gave me this thought but I saw it on insta
---
I remember how easily destructible that garage door was. Nostalgia
---
Buy ultimate edition of rainbow six siege instead . The legacy operators are very easy to grind
---
i guess man, it just sucks cause i was having more fun on the tts than i was on the main build.
---
123456789 appears in all the 3, find the order.
---
As you can see, it's using the integrated graphics, which can't run siege really.
---
Don't you have a dedicated gpu for it?
---
Have u install right driver for the new gpu?
---
Or did u do what my brother did amd pluged tha cable to your motherboard
---
That’s awesome
---
It doesn't work like that though...
---
Ok, monty.
---
But the ultimate edition is normally £80, I could sell for half that
---
Saw this live, it was great timing; out of mild interest, just before, he was with the main push inside to plant the diffuser - but he then needed to use a breach charge on that window, as it was Castle barricaded, to get OUTSIDE for the angle set-up
---
Being officially announced at the major, it's gonna be free for the first season, then taking a free and a premium track in the Y4S4, not only giving unique items but also adding artbooks and storyline to ops.
---
Huh? What did you try to say?
---
LIGAMA BALLS
---
Ok, thanks for your suggestion bro 👍👍

Grass can withstand assault

Its just that I see really low level players with dlc ops and headgear/weapon skins

that is amazing

Well put.

Your also dope.

I mean it's true

Nice! I remember before I understood how to play Siege well I picked Mute because he looked cool

Thanks bro!

This makes me genuinely sad

Ubi didn’t listen. They never made unranked to solve this issue. Ubi did it so you can play the ranked settings without worrying about your rank, as well as allowing newer players to get a feel for the ranked scene before jumping in. It’s also made for warming up, as a lot of people want to warm up but causal had very different settings. Essentially it’s a tester playlist for ranked gameplay.

Lion's V308 is completely fictional, it's supposed to be a 7.62x51mm chambered Vector. It actually strongly resembles a sci-fi weapon concept, the [HK G56](https://www.deviantart.com/alexjjessup/art/HK-G56-390638785).

I’ve played older versions of the games via something “legal” and I’ve learned that just having the acog was fun. Ash, bandit, and jäger acog was incredibly fun, and the first time I played it, it was the most fun I had ever had in siege.
---
Spawnpeeking is still present in this game, and fortunately and unfortunately, it may never be solved completely, but I believe that Ubisoft is doing a good job of fixing the issues with spawnpeeking. Their newly reworked maps have new obstacles and barricades that prevent spawnpeeking. Although, many of the old maps such as House, Kanal, and others still remain with the issue.
---
You’re missing out on valuable meme content that I’m surprised the mods didnt delete
---
I don't know if it's the same people though. You have a point, but I kind of doubt the instant kickers are the same ones complaining about people leaving, give or take a few. I think they're linked though. Like over time people just instantly leave because they're so used to getting kicked for making a minor mistake or not being "good" in the eyes of others, so they leave before voting can start, causing the dislike of the action. 
---
You can be both, but for the right reason. I hate when I get some dipshit on my team that's just purposely throwing the game, talking shit to our team, and is busting being toxic in general. Yeah, I'll vote to kick him, because that kind of person isn't what I and plenty of others want on their team. Sometimes you have to kick them, sometimes they leave on their own. But it's annoying when we have to be one person down and put at a disadvantage because of it.
---
Holo my dude! It’s wonderful
---
Very good
---
omg you need atleast 1950mb to run the game good
---
Nah, it was just that wall that was easy to destroy.
---
both are fine
---
bandit
---
That's year one shit
---
Sure you havnt plugged your hdmi/displayport into the motherboard and not the graphics card?
---
It was only on garage walls like that, other walls were definitely harder to destroy without a shotgun or a breaching gadget
---
Spawnpeeking isn’t an issue. They are the easiest thing to counter. It is ALWAYS in the attacker favor. Ubi is blocking off ability for some bullshit spawnpeeks and I get that, such as the reading room balcony runout on kafe. The only spawnpeeks I’m against are instant spawnpeeks.
---
oh, my b. Believe it or not, plenty of took and doc players used to, but spawns are redesigned to prevent this kind of thing now, some more then others. Not to mention after so many seasons, players become conditioned to run outs and more or less have where to to prefire to prevent a successful run out.
---
It took me so long to realise and I'm level 163
---
Yeah
---
I actually gradually stopped playing because unless you played with a friend the odds of being kicked were almost guaranteed. I also hated all the team killing like cmon guys I’m just tryna play
---
playing hostage you should always bring fuze
---
10/10
---
I screwed a couple times on this tbh. But when you use your pencil lightly you can erase little mistakes without there being any trace of them!
---
🤔
---
I have a 2060 super so def not the graphics card.
---
I would love to do that for you guys!
---
Mines not super
---
And I love all you guy’s support!
---
Someone didn’t get laid last night and it really shows
---
Fun fact that’s actually a bannable offence in ELS
---
Haha
---
70% of my brainpower in this game goes to getting angles on cams or doors that will never shoot my teammates
---
Well, for console players such as myself, it was super easy to just run outside and dump on some heads because you could see what you’re aiming at. Now it’s more difficult, because there are no zoom scopes available for Jager and Bandito Burito
---
Mute mains tend to not be toxic. And it’s great!
---
Select hostage rescue only in thunt preferences. Pick a soft breacher(Buck is the best).Kill all the terrorists. New ones won't start spawning until you take the hostage, so don't touch him. You can now open everything and keep refilling ammo indefinitely.
---
What an ass, welcome to siege and good weapon choice, the other primary on castle sucks,
---
Should've been drinking a monster energy zero ultra
---
Jager Acog is undoubtedly fun but it's not balanced. The game needs balance to make it fun to play all or as many operators as possible. MP5 with Acog is strong, Carbine with no real recoil for good players, high damage and an Acog sounds really really frustrating for attack. Jager is one of the operators who is really balanced at the moment, he doesn't need an Acog.
---
I guess it’s a console problem then. Since I’m close to my monitor, I can see just fine.
---
macie is real life gladstone gander
---
&amp; Make Warden a 2 speed or give him a third primary option in the P90 w/ Acog
---
His little panick reaction at the end
---
You know it’s toxic when he didn’t even put all of his ads down
---
It's literally all preference some of them are hard top some of them cloth top. And different sizes, you won't notice any difference in performance from brands
---
Oh
---
So you play the game in German?
---
Then I will stop it at 45 minutes
---
You don't need an acog for that tho
---
Don’t know where don’t know whennnnn.
---
Thx for making me jealous :(
---
Buck is pretty fun
---
Buck
---
The destructive power why is it so much

You cant escape Silver

I thought I might have been close to a record

That is very true

I'd like to see it gone for a day and see how the community plays without it

played a few games this season huh? lol

Thatcher main? What the fuck do you do besides help the team. Pffft

Id normally say Jackal but good luck playing him in ranked :(
---
Leonardo Da Macie
---
Oh yeah I play on pc that would be great :)
---
It's still gonna be a map, you just have to play custom to play it
---
There’s a few ways you can counter this..
---
Besides the obvious, trap operators, let’s look at some positioning strats you could do.
---
You can spawn peak. The threat of a spawn peak can slow down the attackers, and possibly yield a kill. I would have one person peak while another two players are preping things to make it look like they are spawn killing. 
---
Along with this, we can try to funnel the attackers a certain way. This can be done with op gadgets, reinforcing certain places and on. If you’re using your utility and gadgets properly you can one bombsite that can be held by one person, while you can focus the rest of your man power 2-3 anchors on the other site while having 1-2 roamers. 
---
Barbwire barbwire barbwire.. this utility will give so much info and slow down the attackers a lot. Use this on the popular pushes and week areas of your defense. 
---
I could expand on these thoughts with an example if you’d like.
---
I think that was my 210th game

I'd say Buck or Zofia - Zofia is a little more situational than Buck but Buck's better gun (the C8) has a fairly decent amount of recoil - not too difficult to control when you get used to it though.

How do you get the little icon saying which operator is your main?
---
yea console just seems REALLY easy, every clip of console i see is just people playing really dumb
---
Why what?
---
OP, I'm pretty sure your monitor is plugged in to your motherboard and not your gpu. The game doesn't even detect the graphic card.
---
This is what happens when the Team picks hibana, buck, ash, termite, and sledge
---
yea but if we are talking like that, it must be 2/10 players on pc and 7/10 on console since legit EVERY clip of console ive seen is something dumb like this lmao
---
Oh right. I keep forgetting the prices are starting to decrease
---
Biggest OOF
---
lmao these console people salty, is true, every clip ive seen is just people playing dumb lmao
---
In like 700h of playing I think only around 5 times votekick was used for the good.

People won't even kick flying hackers ffs, and the toxic people most of the time are in a dúo at least.
---
I bought the game because of him, almost all i know is thanks for him.
---
Idk, when i saw him doing "that thing" with vertical play and some strats etc, i got trapped into the game, specailly when he is a chill person and gives you a fair answer about why this and this.
---
Anyone else notice he did this the long way? Respect for your dedication.
---
I literally just fucking played with this guy today lmao!
---
The whole Shroud audience: \*chuckels\*
---
Imagine the in universe cussing out Hibana would have given Maverick after the training exercise. "I'm on your team, asshole!"
---
Why did you shitpost?

I mean you’re not the only one who does it but still why?
---
The slowest reaction time lmao
---
Haven’t figured how to clip but I got Mr brother as witness, it was my fourth kill in the round RIP echos skull he didn’t suspect a thing
---
Ahhh I thought it was t hunt and cas. I haven't messed with it in a long time I just remembered it let me pick game modes bc I play all modes in cas but my friend plays nothing but bomb. 
---
I just feel like, especially with the unranked mode on its way, they should let cas be cas, you know? Who knows maybe the update will get here and I'll think it's the best thing ever lol
---
He is cause he isn’t repeating the same thing we just heard
---
Yes kill those children. School shooting practice
---
Now that's what I call an open concept house

Then you're not better than the person attacking you imho.

Ya neither do I, as u can see I have has this acc for over a year and I don't have any compared to most but i usually just browse Reddit is probably why.

This is the only time it's happened to me, I could see this having disastrous consequences in ranked though

uhhh do something about your retarded teammates. you readily admit they die to spawnpeeks because they're lazy or clueless, that's not the game's fault lmao.
---
Emblem Skins when?
---
We know you miss the acog but you need to stop it’s making everyone uncomfortable to be around you
---
And my point isn't the karma really, what I'm trying to say is that everyone will disagree so no point in even stating your opinion on this sub or most subs for that matter.
---
It’s coming back in a month sorry for the confusion
---
I use it on almost every gun that can have it but I’ve been thinking about taking it off all or almost all of my attackers. There are of course plenty of times where it’s good, but as I’ve gotten better it seems like there are less and less opportunities where the defenders expose themselves in a way that lets my ACOG give me an advantage and more times where I end up having to go in to close range fights at a disadvantage.
---
That’s one thing I like about Hibana, Dokkaebi, and Nomad, and I should probably try to play Sledge more. I can put the ACOG on the main then switch to the secondary SMG for close range, or in Nomad’s case I can put reflex on her main then have the scoped pistol.
---
This is me, and nope. Not breaking code of conduct at all
---
I think they might re shuffle it and it will come back
---
They should go to -their- our lord and bow for him.
---
Deal with it
---
It's the sad truth of Reddit.
---
Bro. Learn where they spawn peek. Peek them before they peek you. Don’t play ranked until you’re level 90. And most importantly, find a group of people you can consistently play with. The more you play with a group, the more you will understand the game, and how your teammates play. I’ve found a group of friends, and we are all around gold 1, except two guys who constantly solo queued without us
---
tl;dr
---
Learn the spawnpeeks, warn your teammates, kill the peekers before they can get you.
---
It’ll be coming back in a month I didn’t know that when I posted
---
Hold up

---
r/lostredditors
---
Next season it is getting removed but it’s coming back
---
I second that, if your team runs in with no regard to tact or caution, they deserve to be spawn peeked
---
Hibana if you solo queue a lot or play with a group of friends where you play hard breacher a lot or can’t always count on them to bring the right hard breacher. There are times to bring Thermite and times to bring Hibana, you don’t want to have to bring Thermite when you should bring Hibana.
---
If you have a group you usually play with and can count on them bringing the hard breacher you need, then Capitao or Buck.

---
yummy
---
Leave and join back. That happened to me before.
---
&gt;you can’t have an acog’d defender running around with a secondary 1270rpm spray gun and impacts. 
---
*Laughs in Echo*. I guess no impacts is true but a pair of fully invisible motion sickness launching cameras is a decent trade off.
---
What numbers?
---
Nah man I get it was a joke. Everyone knows you can’t hack on console. I made a joke back and it’s looking like you’re the one missing it

Warden is supposed to be able to reposition. Wouldn't want him having an acog AND smg12.
---
I clearly didn’t steal it... I just crossposted it.
---
Too OP
---
*cries in Ash/Jäger main*
---
If you bought it on steam, you might be able to buy it from there using the steam app
---
no, i made it :D unfortunatly not :(
---
I mean, that's true, but from a competitive standpoint, thinking Smoke is a roamer will keep you in the low ranks.
---
Didn’t they already test her with an acog and found it to be to powerful?
---
Her secondary gadgets should absolutely be frags and smokes. They’re more fitting for a stealth infiltrator than a breaching charge and flashbangs of all things. 
---
I think giving her the MP5SD with frags and smokes would make a viable pick, even if her gadget sucks. Honestly, I’d still recommend giving her gadget an electronic trap immunity as well. 
---
She and Warden are currently so bad that they both warrant total overhauls.
---
what the fuck
---
Look at where you positioned your card in the system, it has slots on the back. Use these for your hdmi or displayport connection NOTHING ELSE. If your specific card doesn't have a normal sized HDMI port, you'll have to get an adapter cable or try for example displayport. Don't worry, if you need these adapters, they're usually less then 15€/$.
---
I’d rather warden get the MP5 or MP5k over the P90. 
---
Giving the P90 over the MPX is just trading one marshmallow gun for another.
---
Ah man, this ones a classic
---
If cars in The Crew (another game from Ubi) are designed in the same way, it would explain their performance. Especially handling.
---
Why a smoke she would be invisible to people and players
---
dps and time to kill for mp7 against defenders.
---
you need to plug it into the gpu
---
Use the other one in the lower part of the picture.
---
Yes.  I haven't seen a clear statement as to which is used, but my experience this season was pretty clear.
---
If my max MMR had been used, I would have started slightly above 2600.  Going 5-5 in placement matches should basically even out.  My MMR after placements was 2324.  That is \~300 points off where it should be had my max MMR been used and right on (1 point difference) from where it should have been had my season-ending MMR been used.
---
Is this a contest? Is this what the developers said??
---
In a different reply he said motherboard so i think you are right.
---
You say this like the SMG12 is at all a good weapon after the recoil changes to it. It’s got so much horizontal recoil it’s a miracle if you hit someone.
---
He's best used for last 30 seconds plant denial, but can be used off-site by good players for forcing people out of positions and into a shotgun.
---
Probably a little OP
---
No, I will keep playing it over free weeknd, any game I would
---
free weekend ends today

Then don’t play casual

I have been kicked for literally just joining. I have been kicked for not clutching up (mind you im level 20 and everyone on my team was 150+ silver tryhards). I have not yet been kicked for team killing I haven't TK'd anyone at all. I don't talk trash. I don't play bad 3/10 I get MvP (again level 20 so pretty damn good considering everyone is 100+).  This tool is almost as bad as team killing in general.

You mean down syndrome

I'd like to know this too, as i bought the standard edition recently, and if i activate it i keep the items or not.

I just hope there won't be consequences for doing this. :/

If he uses quuicksync for something that's not a good idea. Just set up nvidia control panel correctly.

Wdym came back they never left
---
Man even thw yellow screen if you ran outside, old days
---
Wish you’re joking
---
Started semi-maining him the past week after not playing him much before really and 
---
im loving every aspect of him except he has nothing to breach with....  It'd be good if he had a side arm shot gun if they wernt to give him breach charges but i understand why he only has the 1 pistol...
---
Remember the where the smg-11 had an ACOG
---
I mean I'm not trying to be mean sorry lol but it's just funny.
---
But if he anchors properly outside of the objective playing defensively/passively he's a good thing-especially if your team got other angles covered from inside or outside of obj and if your team is organized enough to pull that off. If not, then as a last one alive with nades he can pull of great plays like gassing some of the obj, rotating around and clutching the round but ye... he must be skilled in doing so and because of that i'd call him a skill dependand operator- low skilled ppl stay at the obj and focus on timed defense and high skilled ppl cam anchor on unexpected angles.

Sledge should work now since his hammer now breaks the deployable shields.

Guess what I just found my charger my brother was hiding it

Yeah, playing ranked
---
On Villa, I will always put a drone under the bed in master bedroom, to watch that window. I've gotten a few peekers from that tactic.

What a douche. Glad you found it.

Is it fine if i use it

It's pretty rare for that to happen in my games, but when it does it's hilarious. Especially in ranked.
---
Yeee yeeeee yeeeee yeeeeee
---
Yea play recruit
---
Oh yeah, I actually wonder how they implement this blade though
---
Burst fire
---
Play ranked
---
They don't usually have nades on Normal difficulty, though, unless they changed that.
---
Your not the only one
---
Ngl i didn't even know the big room's floor was soft.
---
Idk if he was hiding it but then again he barely knows what is in his drawers

Fuck em. Fuck em where their smurfs can’t hide

Hold up I’ll figure it out and tell you

XD
---
##play ranked and wdym weebs you normie
---
People who cant play at their own level make smurfs
---
Ok thanks again if you dont find i'll just leave it like that
---
Yea because of the pacing and completely different way it plays. High ranks on console take a really different turn really quick. 
---
Those droned lone wolf rushes still won’t work because you’re not flicking back and forth between people and targets at Mach 10.

If your team is 4 recruits, you'll probably get kicked/tked if you don't also pick recruit.

Don’t ever be that one dude that won’t run recruit in Casual. It’s called Casual for a reason

No the distance was wonky couldn’t hit the thing or place a breach charge frags and ash were your only hopes
---
Thank you!!
---
good aim but i dont care what beast you are you should not win a 1v4 as attack with 3 hp and time running out. People just dont have the Patience to just hold angles in the sites.
---
Are u afraid of ur right analog stick ?
---
i made it. but by upvoting you support it to become true
---
solo ranked is unplayable
---
Why are Mobas the first alternative your mind jumped to though?
---
the chance for a recycled one exists. a new one never i guess
---
Very true, but team building discords and subreddits exist for a reason
---
Had a black beard run in front of me just as I shot an impact with Zofia.
---
Pure art
---
Goyo is situational really but still looks better than Warden and Amaru.  
---
Goyo is situational in terms that using him in closed rooms is very dangerous. For example Skyscrapper, Yacht, Plane, etc...
---
I'd reworked Amarus that way that she wouldn't break the barrier when she shoots grappling hook but instead breaks it with her legs, also make the switch between weapon and gadget delay bit shorter but in exchange make gadget swing bit louder and probably slower.
---
Honestly pretty much the case, whatever this peep says, he is correct one way or another.
---
Yeah, i thought these are just regular bundles here to stay in the shop. Should have saved my renown and bought the blackbeard one if i knew about it earlier.
---
wtf did i just watch
---
I only solo q. Not bad tbh. I do believe I should be in a higher rank tho
---
Clearly you have no clue what a smurf is for
---
Often in casual I'll play while listening to a podcast or youtube video or something.
---
Lmfao 😂 I love macie
---
wait for it :) i am sure the time will come when ying will be played again
---
Wdym? Like not leaning?
---
Fuck off.
---
i made it
---
I only solo q, not bad tbh. But I do believe I should be in a higher rank. P 3/2

They used to do these graphs that showed the winrates on every map, but they seem to have stopped. It was pretty close, certain maps were really lopsided, and they're the ones that wouldn't surprise you. Favela and Tower.
---
Maestro

Damn it

That run out was broken and it was fixed. Everyone knows or should know that spot and any spawnpeeks.

Good old casual

Authentic
---
....... My dude, read the ember rising patch notes.  He's had 4 fire on the tts for a week or so now.
---
Yeah but fortunately it's very easy to shoot out of and has plenty of runout angles.
---
I play on the Ouya
---
Ur pretty slow, I've since then got them all on almost 2 acc.

Oh my god this takes me back!!! Upvote!
---
Like a more clean photo made on a computer

Right click on your computer like literally on your wallpaper and open the control panel, click to look through all programs and fine siege and set it to use your graphics card.
---
Really not hard to control the smg 11 recoil. Even on console. I mean I play with it a lot but idk
---
he plays on diamond, solo a lot of times, while on chat, answering questions, giving advice on how to balance the game that developers do later (like shields not downing on melee), and everything while not having a godlike aim.
---
yes, he is a really great player and the best streamer of R6

She's very bad in pro league. She'll get traded before she can pull off an interrogation almost every time. That's why she has a low ban and pick rate. She brings no utility so she's not worth banning nor picking.
---
Congrats. :)
---
lmfao, i thought the same shit. I only use emojis when making fun of people who use emojis.
---
Or a cheater.
---
This. I never downvote people for stating their opinions in a respectable way. This guy seems to have a personal vendetta against Macie or something.
---
Can someone explain to me how giving ACOG to nokk would make her too strong? I tried really hard but I just can't buy this bs.
---
He was the best. Plant a special charge on one wall and a regular breach on another.
---
The MP7 on Nøkk would be amazing. I would definitely play her more if she had that gun.
---
That would actually be a perfect weapon, or at least a .300 blackout
---
No. The last thing the game needs is a 3 speed caviera clone with an MP7.
---
Hell nah u nook mains
---
This stuff is absolutely amazing! I hope Ubi will feature you!
---
Yeah because the 300 blackout could somewhat realistically have a high damage drop off!
---
nokk is 2/2
---
This kinda happens even at the highest level of play. Especially when you have teammates that coordinate, they understand when uncontrollable sh*t happens.
---
Good to see some positive Iq finally.

Hello creedthesinger! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!

---
**NOW HOL' UP THERE PARTNER!**
---
This is news that, if true, I am guilty of missing. I'm firing up right away to check how I missed this!
---
because she can reach strong positions without being noticed and acogs would encourage that
---
I play on the LG smart fridge
---
LOL that Tachanka was totally unaware! Were you playing vs Coppers here? They all seemed so unaware of everything.
---
That's what he meant.
---
I'm sure they don't. Game earns money, current state of cheaters presence does not affect that. Ergo, game and bussiness model works. "Don't fix what's not broken", that's how Ubi see this problem.
---
Every game that cares about playerbase experience have built in, server side, counter measures for cheating. Like server side movement validation, limited data propagation, properly designed client side anti-cheat etc. Siege servers accept every packet you send and send you every bit of information they have. Why? Because Ubi don't care.
---
You want to move your character to the oposite side of the map instantly? Sure thing, here you go. You want to know where everyone is even though, you won't be able to get a line of sight for next 15 sec? Sure, take that information too, why not. You want fire your primary, in prep phase while being on attack. No problem, sir.
---
Please, stop being delusional. Programming is hard, that's true, but not all the time. There are simple things as well. A lot of solutions is viable, one just have to want implement them. Ubi, don't care. They proved that many times.
---
Because they are shit????

Of course you can run it, on how much fps though? 15 max?

Oh ok makes sense my bad
---
As a clash main this feels really good
---
Exactly yea. You have a 220 grain projectile hitting you but at a range the velocity is quite bad. 
---
I think Warden should get the B&amp;T ACP which just won a contract with the gov and a lot of security agencies (federal and private) will be using them. 
---
This is wishful thinking however
---
Both
---
Honesty Warden needs smoke grenades
---
I don’t mind the recoil reduction especially when using LMGs and emptying the mag. 
---
I personally don’t like the Heartbeat because it’s loud but I think that’s to balance out the extra HP and other positives you get from it.
---
Where did you get this. I need a link to see if bill is actually getting the MP7

So what you mean to say is,it’s not compatible.

Pure luck

Looks like the bitch ass he is
---
He's one of the biggest streamers in Siege and has been Diamond since Ranked was a thing. He plays with and against pros all the time, so yeah he's very good.. he just cares more about the strategy aspect of the game and outsmarting the opponent rather than just going for gunfights and kills, so he's nothing always going to be having some flashy 15k games.
---
If you seen him leaving it was almost certainly casual, which no one really takes seriously I hope, I've never seen him leave in Ranked personally.
---
Pretty sure only terrorist hunt missions

Lmao thank you
---
when you select details do you change anything in the other categories or just sharpen?
---
yes and on top of that, they redid all the animations while they were at it. The entire kit and caboodle.
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it
---
Tutorial? Pls i need to know
---
Because people are usually solo queuing and they don’t want to bother playing against an op that could fuck up their uncoordinated team. It’s stupid I know because before pick and ban he wasn’t a huge deal but now all of the sudden he barely sees the light of day on Ranked and it’s sad. People should be banning off of the map and their strategy on that map and not just default banning ops that may not even have an impact on the match to begin with.
---
Just added you
---
Fun Tip. All enemies in UBI games are masked.  R6, The Division ,..etc. It is a psychological trick to make players feel no remorse for killing them, as they dont look human because they do not have a " face".
---
 Eww, what is that Ela skin... I didn't think you could make Ela look bad ever but they somehow did.
---
Thy God has spoken: DON'T FUCKING ZAP ENEMIES, ZAP GODDAMNED GADGETS!!!!
---
Actually not really because you don't know what you're talking about. Runouts or spawnkills that take 2s or longer are perfectly legal.
---
The Kenyan one and Alibi, she's from Libya.
---
if youre lucky
---
Than quit complaining, everyone has been there at one point, we make mistakes, and we learn from them, the game was insanely toxic when I first started but you learn from it
---
Report it to Microsoft. They're more likely to act and with a more stern policy. If there are actual threats of violence directed at him and his family, report it to the local police.
---
pretty poor image design, shouldve just went with a text post.
---
Watch Braction. All i can say.
---
So guys, we did it
---
Don’t the alibi visions have different skins from her
---
it’s kinda meh, but it’s kinda growing on me the more I play Ela
---
Yes but understand that even though they are, if another team complains about a start round peek or rush it will go to their side automatically, and the admin will forfeit the match it has happened to my team before, even if they state that it happened and your team doesn’t have evidence to back up that it was late round, the admin will take their side
---
Thanks a lot. Much appreciated.
---
Purely if you are trying to get better at the game, Youtubers like Maciejay for positioning and Skittlez for aiming and angles.
---
Awesome, thanks boss. Shoot me an invite or join me anytime you see me on, company is always better and usually I’m playing with a friend or two so we will be close to a squad. Got tired of those trashy randos deranking me. Although you still get them even with a squad. Me and my buddies have seen gameplay that genuinely shocked us. It’s like watching terrorist bots play sometimes
---
I’m just saying toxicity doesn’t need to be the answer for an honest mistake someone made, no matter how big or small it was.
---
Than their Thermite watch out that he doesn't get doomed st the beginning.
---
Just uh, not the bomber
---
Its been around for a while, i first learned of it in wind bastion
---
See Minecraft is still useful in modern games
---
oh damn yeah lol.
---
My friends and I have been playing since the beta and that's our biggest gripe with the game, the amount of hours we've played hasn't changed our perception yet. 
---
As well I'd love to see a playlist with all the unbalanced maps to see how many people play them. I would and think it would be interesting to see.
---
Song??
---
adorbs
---
big tips - drone and prefire
---
Yea I understand, but In a casual game where sweats are sweating, that’s the only way to learn.
---
No, Prismas are blank default. Any skins or attachments are a dead give away.
---
The tip of the reflex is where the bullet goes. So you aimed above him
---
Scorpion is my faviourite exactly because it's so random and hard to control. It's fun.
---
OH YEAHHH MR KRABSSSS
---
TBH I have over 1k hours and I love plane in casual . It's my fav map to goof around with my mates.
---
I dunno if its just me but they've been pretty visible lately. The distortion on the floor isn't super obvious but it is there.
---
sounds like you're making shit up buddy
---
Its randomized within a diamond shape inside your crosshair i Believe.
---
P90 is worse than MPX,I dunno why people think it is better. Recoil of P90 sucks so much,if they want to give warden a good weapon give any of the mp5s.
---
wow unique...?
---
Mozzie is 5’3
---
Lmao, in that case, I would definitely point you to frost, she has 3 mate and if someone steps in then, boom, they are automatically injured, however you will need to be tactical in where you place them since they are quite big and obvious. They are best on darker maps and in shadows, you can place them by doorways and behind shields. Her weapons are a sub machine gun (forgot the name) which has a slow fire rate but moderate damage and amazing recoil, and the super 90 which is a fast fire rate shotgun which has a short range and a decent amount of damage for what it is, typically I go for the shotgun since I tend to stay close quarters with frost, and I use the pistol for any long range kills I’ll need to get.
---
Ela is my main, so far nothing beats her plain all purple twitch skin. But that's just me.
---
I hope this leak is some kind of a still WIP work and it'll be somewhat improved to not look so "store manager" like.
---
Is there an update regarding the ddos problems? The game is littrally unplayable at the moment. Almost every game gets chrashed and frozen at higher ranks.
---
You have to edit it through the Reddit website
---
Hell the new defender is just a shield with an attachment.
---
What the fuck...where did you even get the bullets o do this?
---
small pp
---
love the idea of an acog on warden, not sure if i would use the mp7 on nokk since i seem to perform really well with the fmg9, and although i would love smonks i think they could be a bit op.
---
nice, if that was a wallpaper for my desktop and was smoke oh boy . i wish i had some form of talent instead of making people fake laugh at my awkwardness .
---
Smg-12 with angled grip is good. But you need to claim your kill with the first shots. Because of the angled grip and high fire rate you can just run without opening the scope when you see someone (skraaaa skraa)
---
What? Breach charge is very important, its useful when yiu want to get inside from places like tunnels on villa
---
More exclusive this way.
---
I mean, I was doing it to be funny, cause I see it on every sub lol. But clearly no one enjoyed it.
---
Because there are a limited number of defenders with access to an acog so it seems wasteful to not take advantage of it.
---
What servers?
---
Are you saying that he is excessively toxic, or is it more like "Maverick isn't toxic!", "IS TOO!"?
---
Then I guess my response to the OP's question is I'm ok with them
---
New boi "Uh...is this normal" Team "Carry on men"
---
I wouldn't really change nøkk much her weaponry is perfect to me but wardens mpx is a pos that i would say th and for a 5k, p90, or even a normal mp5 but please get the mpx out of there
---
I hate that man
---
[deleted]
---
Thanks
---
It’s cool, but having that skin would be like walking around with a spotlight
---
fuck this dude
---
Toxicity is in player behavior. An operator, by definition, cannot be toxic.
---
"You're up against the wall. And I am the FUCKING WALL!!"
---
is thid official?
---
yes i also thought about giving him smokes and flashes
---
Mavericks AR-15 is .50 Beowulf, Think a longer version of the .50AE from the desert Eagle.   
---
Glaz's sniper is 7.62x54R, which is actually the same caliber as the LMG used by Fuze and Finka. It's just given a lot higher Damage per shot then the LMG for gameplay balance reasons.   
---
Most of the other DMR's are 7.62x51mm NATO, which is only slightly smaller then the 7.62x54R rounds used by the Russians.
---
The Revolvers and .45 pistols rounds are a larger diameter then the 7.62 rifle rounds, but they are shorter and lighter.
---
Fuck that guy
---
fuck yeah flashes would be even better
---
Yeah Nokk with smokes. This is why people shouldnt listen to reddit.
---
I say that is excessively toxic is a 3 speed operator
---
And the gun is really good sometimes you don't see him and he kill you no where
---
But what about the ears?
---
His head is so small
---
I dont understand why they just dont make fake variants of existing guns. We already got the V308 and Spear. They could easily make an MP7-S for example
---
Boo
---
Yeah I don't think you know what toxic means. It's about player behavior. A player can be toxic, an operator cannot.
---
so that's the dude i've been hearing heavily breathing across the door way
---
12 knife hits to break the castle
---
Those were the golden days

Ahhh I see

It’s irony
---
“Noone cared who I was until I put on the mask”
---
Warden is still very poor right now and I don't think Ubi want warden being able to do what glaz does. The issue with Y4S2+ ops is they're all too situational except maybe Goyo.
---
Literally said this as I opened up the comments
---
Did the flair work
---
This motherfucker lookin' like one of the preset faces in Dark Souls.

If you’re team runs ying and frags then it’s not a stretch of a ban, jager has been banned a couple time in pro league as well
---
[Close-up of the face.](https://i.imgur.com/jy7vW7X.jpg)
---
I randomly got given some Y1 operators too, in the past. It always surrounded the events of a free play weekend so I figured their system had some holes in it, as I initially played on a free weekend then bought the game using the same account I'd made for that.
---
Here's a tip for you; Don't bother trying to contact Ubisoft support about it, they are hopeless. I tried to out of simple good faith — I mean I'd only gained free stuff not lost anything — and after 5 replies of giving them the information they asked for they still hadn't managed to recognize that I owned the game, no joke.
---
Never thought about the psychological part, but I know it does save time on modeling so many faces.
---
Lamo

MP5 Acog plus Smg-11 ACOG

Now I need to find a place near me that does nachos
---
They're covered so Ubi doesn't have to waste resources animating faces for boys that you'll slaughter in a instant anyways.
---
also both of the games you mentioned have enemies without masks.
---
Bruh u must be downloading 0.0000005 MB/s
---
The best advice would be to find a group of people to play with. The amount of toxic people in this community is absurd.
---
no, i dont think i will
---
toooooo OO
---
They're not changing her gun, please find ways to fix her in other ways i.e. give her frags.
---
bruh id use nokk so much if she had the mp7
---
Buck attempts to throw 2 frags through a hole the size of a lab rats asshole, bounces back and kills the team
---
Well howdy there friend
---
I'd really love to see that as well. Maybe make it so that it takes two or three hits with Sledge's hammer, it takes more than 12 melee hits, Fuze can't fuze his way through, etc. Make them a viable middle ground between soft and hard walls because right now they're too easily destroyed and that's what is holding back Castle the most. Right now he has too many counters and if we make it only possible to destroy with explosives (frags, breaching charges, Ash charges, etc.) it would make the Mute jammer option much more viable.

Im just saying that they buff him by reducing his sound by just a bit. Theres defenders in another room that hear me and I die.
---
I wouldn't really call it that...
---
What does that even mean
---
Hardly, the 5.56 has a bit more taper. But they perform near identically. There's a myth that the 5.56 has more chamber pressure, but that was due to the US military using a different testing method (further in the barrel, rather than the chamber). 
---
Overall it's generally accepted that you shouldn't put .223 Rem into a 5.56 and vice versa, but .223 Wylde rifles will accept 5.56 and .223 Remington with no issues.
---
Pros fall for it at high teir, the trick is to not be a noob by putting them out at the start/beginning of a round.
---
Use Prismas as a distraction, so when they know you're in a room you drop it as they approach so they see it before you.
---
You pick wrong, you're mine.
---
Alibi is a cav but better.
---
also nice pic

Stay out of your own head about it. Ever watch baseball? Even the best players in the world have off stretches where they can’t buy a hit. Same thing happens in Siege, everyone gets hot sometimes and cools off others. Don’t start telling yourself that you suck, just keep at it if you’re still having fun and you’ll come around.

If you’re not having fun, take a break.

---
you aren't being critical you're being retarded
---
Oh just wait, there's at least one cheeky way of spawn peeking.
---
Nobody chooses him because he is trash. He needs to be buffed somehow
---
or you can play on intel graphics and get shit fps no matter what lol.
---
If you get a clip of them admitting it and multiple people submit clear video evidence, they can be banned. However, on consoles you can have unlimited accounts so it doesn’t matter if they’re banned in the long run.
---
Not as bad as warden he’s pretty much useless. And the other ops that have there same guns are more useful.
---
Ya sadly. I do hope it gets fixes though
---
Warden is hotter
---
Have you ever heard of cognitive dissonance? You might find this interesting https://www.pbis.org/Common/Cms/files/Forum17_Presentations/B4_H4_CognitiveDissonanceinRelationtoWhiteFragility.pdf
---
We just have to live with it.  We’ve done fine for a few years already, so we can continue managing.
---
I'm just yanking your chain man
---
The buff is not to the damage or recoil, its that it allows Nokk to equip an ACOG. In this game, they could not allow her to use the ACOG without also giving it to Smoke. Weapons are treated as universal assets that operators have access to, i.e. giving the Warden’s MPX an ACOG would require giving Valk an ACOG.
---
Protect your account better?  Stop failing for phising scams and dont be a dummy.
---
Absolutely correct!
---
ok thanks for your input.
---
I honestly doubt that. Nøkk is not doing well in in the current version of Siege, and I think we've seen how an ACOG affects the balance of an Op with Bandit, Jäger, and Ash. After the scope was removed, pick rate plumeted, but yet they still remain as some of the best choices available.
---
Yeah, but the guy I was replying to was saying that she should get the MP5SD without the ACOG.
---
If it doesn’t clear in 24 hours, send a ticket.

Change my mind. How is he balanced

But Ubisoft literally said she was too op with the gun that had an acog she was given

maybe a new MP7SD? Just an mp7 with a forced suppressor

Even with high fps it's choppy
---
Black ice flexing I see

Yeah I had this problem and contacted support and they couldn’t tell me why this happened and I was annoyed because they take the money but you get nothing. But like someone said wait 24 hours if still nothing, contact support

Maybe, but I don't think they can accurately tell how powerful someone will be before release. Blackbeard, Lion, and Ela are great examples
