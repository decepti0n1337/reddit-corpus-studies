You play the game and get renown and spend it on ops. It’s what I did it’s not so bad.
---
---
---
Can defenders shoot through this?
---
Actually it’s true, with the upcoming season they are lowering the cost of DLC oportators!
---
Gadget is actually 4 as well by default.
---
My friend got this glitch and he got the ops the next day 
---
Add more British!! SAS &gt; ALL
---
No I meant the R-97 as in Titanfall 2. A gun that was good at launch and then was buffed four times in a row.
---

---
To compare it to the R-99, the R-97 has a 40-round magazine (non-extended), a maximum hipfire cone of about 1.15 degrees, the same 1080rpm rate of fire, the same reload speed, and has a mod that allows it to be fired (with no spread penalty) while sprinting and/or jumping. It was eventually banned in competitive play. 
---
Part of castling doors is the choice between anchoring or roaming. They’re quick and easy to pull down either way though. 
---
That's not the idea but it's a possibility.
---
What’s in the canister?
---
I avoid "what-if" style questions. These require people to be way more knowledgeable about Siege than you would think. 
---
I ask about the current state of the game, not the past or potential future changes 
---
Anything involving changes are much better as normal text posts where people can elucidate opinions, whereas the simple opinions in this survey are better collected en masse 
---
No we don’t need blood orchid ela back that was a fucking nightmare 51 mag, no recoil, 36 dmg 4 mines, impact nades? Hell no we don’t need ash 2.0 on defense again. Yes her recoil is off the charts literally if you laugh out loud at the recoil chart but she’s fine the way she is. She actually require skill to use unlike some ops.
---
I agree to an extent, but this would allow for smoother movements. And that's what I was going for.
---
i remember they show a chart during the invitational that explained how older OP will be cheaper over time. unfortunately i cant find it...
---
Siege’s censoring chat is very stupid if you as me
---
Like... it’s rated M, therefore it’s for a mature audience. If you get offended over words, you are obviously not mature enough to play 
---
What
---
Yep. In fact, thanks to the communication allowed in Apex, the majority of times I’ve won games is with 2 randos; only twice have I won with a friend, and those times we had a random third. 
---
Jackal footprint scanner someone's been here before.

Oh damn, thats op as fuck. I played Titanfall 2 just never seriously, it was a game would pick from time to time casually. Never knew the exact goings on or if they even had a competitive scene. Never really left the spitfire really, loved that gun.
---
i'm not worthy of the black ice
---
It’ll sting a lot. 
---
I don't see how it would be much different than the questions asking if people approve of the 3 and 4 minute timers. People had a chance to experience all those changes during the Road to SI playlist. You also ask "which maps should be in ranked". These are all closely related. 
---
"Did you approve of the ability to ban operators during Road to SI?"
---
The format is the same.
---
Why they didn’t push from both sides at once is beyond me.

What is contextual ping?
---
lol I love this.
---
Tho one question, why is Hibana and BB's flags seem to be taped over?
---
Eh, I'd say Ela's dumber than IQ.  At least IQ *tries* to be quiet at some points, Ela's basically screaming the entire time lol
---
Looks like lack of communication to me. 
---
And less than 2 hours played
---
what’s your sensitivity bro?
---
Yeah i tried to find it too...no luck
---
Every single time I go to throw my drone out I ping by accident 
---
That's like telling people to revert back to hunting to get their food instead of going to a market. Like yeah, it's a challenge that people had to do before supermarkets and currency, but... you get the point.
---
YES!!! Thank you!
---
but the food we had back then was better for us then the food we get now 
---
You can stop worrying about Mozambique’s now 
---
Hi I'm Alibi!
---
More steps not as simple 
---
Hey, when does year4 start on console?
---
"Stale" doesn't just refer to entertainment value. If we keep getting the same answers (to the same questions) every season, then what is the probative value? We aren't learning anything valuable other than that people's opinions haven't changed much. Ask questions that can actually advance the conversation around the state of the game. 
---
10/10 dive
---
That's false buddy you're lying now because your account is 1 year old and you have two accounts to respond to this post don't hide it no. 
---
For the love of God I need a do not reinforce ping. As a Mira main I've resorted to friendly fire cuz people just don't get it. 
---
Nice! 
---
Thank you!
---
I'd say it's more telling people to cook themselves rather than go get fast food. It makes you both play the game and teaches you to respect the ops you have
---
Explain
---
Okah so I first want to say is I'm assuming by "dosing" you are referring to DDOSing which is a Distributed Denial Of Service attack. Now this is done by basically flooding a server with requests. It's highly resource demanding to do, often resulting in dozens if not hundreds of computers to be used.
---
Because of this I find it highly improbable that this is being done in Siege. It would be unrealistic for so many people to be able to DDOS the games servers in such a quick manner. So I would be extremely surprised if this is happening at all. 
---
As for defending DDOS attacks, it's tough because DDOSing is done by flooding and overloading the service. There isn't much too much knowledge they could do to stop it if it is happening. 
---
It’s literally more steps... instead of record upload it’s all of those steps you said... why would a guy take the time to upload when it really doesn’t matter 
---
Oh this... I like this
---
No way my dreams are coming true 😱
---
lmao this made my day
---
I'm glad that ubisoft is recognizing that the system is great and isn't being selfish about it
---
Just blender.

The turn and burn
---
That was awesome play from you both, clearly this guy knows how to play monty. You would think after 3 kills, they wouldnt peak that spot... 
---
Can i ask why you use g36c? I see a lot of people running it and I'd just like to know why they prefer that over the r4c
---
It’s because nobody plays terrorist hunt
---
Aim and move and ping at same time. 
---
Basically what I’ve gathered here is you’re a psycho but that okay tachanka and ying good combo

You cant respond to my earlier comment so now you're accusing me.
---
Maverick
---
This is the first time I've ever seen this on console lol
---
Im not racist if I'm stating facts

Doing this from now on:))
---
Because you're the same guy with two accounts there's no point now get out if you have nothing to contribute 
---
Maverick

Teamkiller here, level 4!

What exactly is the reason?

No mate you are totally fine. Most people on here are from the US so I probably come off as an idiot here. Just wish Mat streamed earlier so I could watch a bit. 
---
Whats contextual ping?
---
you right
---
Hahaha.  Or, if it were 3, I'd combine Cav+Vigil+Echo together to make Super Spooky Bitch.
---
Her Silent Step would be silent, keep her off cams and drones *and* turn her invisible like a Yokai.
---
And her Lusion would be able to switch from stun mode, where it would shoot the Supersonic Blasts from the Yokai Drones(same ammo count, 2/infinite) and the regular mode.
---
Yes you can get it from alpha packs but it’s very rare as it is legendary
---
look at the ranks
---
Isn't siege ok console the most toxic thing ever created by man? Because so far everything I've seen confirms that theory. I mean don't get me wrong, PC is definitely toxic asf. But from what I keep seeing console is full of like a whole new breed of evolved idiotic toxicity. 
---
But this has been happening all week which i forgot to mention
---
ping alone doesnt give info, outlines do
---
Honestly yes.
---
Contact Ubisoft support 
---
**Leyend says he is superior to our lord Chanka.**
---
He’s a sub-par ash main that knows a thing or two about siege
---
I want thermite nades and smoke c4
---
I'm on pc and impacts have a 100% drone kill rate so...

That's why you play her to push, not just to bug enemies

---
Same here brother, but even if we had them, it wouldn’t be the same
---
Not really. Not responding to them and reporting gives them no satisfaction, unless logging in and seeing a temp then perma ban satisfies them,  of which I’ll never experience their satisfaction again if they are banned. 
---
But whatever, you’re right. It’s people’s issue that they are offended, not the toxic person for being offensive. 
---
Too much sweaty and too much toxicity, I feel you.
---
Honestly, the posts I hate the most are the accounts that drop into copper and then mock the players at that level to make "funny" highlights and clips. There's one called Bullying Coppers that consistently makes it to the top of the sub with content that is not just low effort, it's actively hurting the community. 
---
[removed]
---
It should be dark so it looks cooler and creepier.
---
Just make it more consistent. That’s what they want
---
Not on new reddit, unless I missed it
---
What the fuck is wrong with this subreddit, at the time of writing this, this post only has 120 upvotes compared to low effort art and reposts
---
it’s not like people have been asking for it since year one. Better late than never i guess
---
Her AR is equivalent to ash's with more recoil and less bullets. Not bad by a long shot
---
Her shotgun is... terrible, I'll give you that
---
The Bearing 9 is fine if you don't put a sight on it
---
Her gadget is one of the best in the game.
---
Why does she need a buff again?
---
Sadly I've never got to experience yager acog but I probably could have.. I played free weekend on OP health. That was my first time.. when did they remove It was it around the time of op health? 
---
The gun is decent and with the nerf to smg, it's worth using
---
*harvard wants to know your location*
---
Yeah I dropped to bronze when me and friends were just screwing around and then me trying to climb alone has been just about the most toxic thing ever people throwing teamkilling for 0 reason it’s so stupid
---
I haven't played the game for too long but from what I know:
---
Currently there's just a marker where you "point" at. This can mean many things and can be difficult to pinpoint at times.
---
Contextual simply means describing what you are pointing at. For example, I saw some people say "Enemy last spotted here" or "Reinforce here". It's just a way to better describe what you point at.
---
This is why competition is good. It spurs innovation. 
---
That being said, I find it hilarious how Fortnite introduced it within a few weeks yet it might literally be years before we see this in Siege. Say what you will about Fortnite, but it's obviously built on top of a highly extensible / flexible framework. It's amazing how quickly they are able to shape and shift this game with relatively minor bugs. It's a real feat of software engineering.
---
I'd imagine so
---
Even for one company to admit out loud “that’s how we should be doing it” is a huge step. They could have gone the extra step by saying “this is what our player base has been asking for!”

---
Noice
---
Chilllll lmao

Oh I thought it was talking about ping as in your game connection lmao
---
Her AR is good. Sure the only bad thing imo is her bullet count (21). I will not touch the Bering 9 though IMO it's garbage. I will use the SMG11/12 However. 
---
Apex legends has worse net code than siege when it came out 
---
You can
---
It's called using a XIM
---
I honestly feel like it’s going to be a play on Vigil but attack. He’s got three 15 second charges of an ability that eliminates him off all cameras and if Dokkaebi hacks the enemy he’s permanently eliminated. They already mentioned him and Vigil playing cat and mouse together and I would find it interesting to combat the current information meta the defensive side employs heavily. The offense needs help anyway after all of the meta shifting defenders but lackluster attackers other than Maverick. Just don’t make him a three speed or Ash mains may never play her again.
---
Thats not the point, I dont think that behavior like this should go unpunished. Why is it okay to say things like that. It may not mean much to you but it does to me, I was bullied allot on previous schools and got called names like that. So yeah for me it is a preety big deal. And I hope he cant get the chance to say those things in game again.
---
Spot the objective more nerd. 
---
Bro, what's going on with your camera?
---
It should be a silhouette of his beautiful flowing hair. The sort of hair that would launch a fleet of a thousand ships. 
---
Shotgun is great
---
for other guns?
---
console is so cancer
---
Her ar is nothing like ash's. Ash has little to no recoil, high damage and a 30 round magazine. Hibana has a lot of recoil, medium damage with a 20 round magazine
---
Im sorry whats the complaint?
---
And changes things like Zofia's launcher fire mode or Capitão's bolt type. 
---
I hate those people dude
---
where is the funny
---
So all the operators are the same height and width?
---
BNANS BEST GIRL THO
---
I want some sort of ‘no’ sign to put next to Mira windows or something so people don’t reinforce there

No I get that I don’t think it’s trash art style I just don’t like seeing them this way it’s like watching your child be in a porn😂

Wow. This looks disgustingly horrible. 
---
My laptop has those specs as well, and I was able to achieve around 144 fps with all the settings on high, so if you drop the settings to low or medium you should easily be able to achieve that. 
---
theyre as bad as all the year 3 s2-4 uniforms
---
Of course they are...what color are they? 
---
You have to of played at least 40 hours Minecraft and link it to your Ubisoft account. 
---
Favela is my favorite simply because of those 5000 soft walls. It adds variety from the same strats with every other solid waled map. Just cuz you cant improvise, adapt, and overcome doesnt mean they need to remove it. You just need to git gud. Plus who doesnt love blowing shit up? On defence, grab your mutes and bandito boys and you're all set

he was still alive ? WTF

HAHAHAHAHA made my day
---
You cant
---
90% of the front page is boring shit 
---
This reads like one of those "steal her look" meme
---
;)
---
Yes.
---
If you’re on console and you bought a season pass on your home account I think that’s the only way, otherwise you don’t. I could be wrong though and it’s entirely possible that you 100% can’t. 
---
Did you make the helmet or did you buy it?
---
I feel as if with shit enough guns and nerfing it could work. Imagine the pure meme
---
That kid was plat but yeah
---
Look man your heart is in the right place I get it it's an awesome game. But there are parts of the world that get bombed everyday. Hell even in America weve had bombings. A clicker is a military device used to blow stuff up (obviously) if you give this to your friend there is a possibility some cop might shoot him because he thinks he's trying to bomb the place. I know it seems like I'm over reacting but in today's world you've got to be careful. Hell if he goes on a military base with this they'd probably call EOD and MPs over and your. The way I see it the best that can happen is someone thinks it's a cool prop. At worst some scared cop or MP will shoot him because he's holding a detonator. Just 3d print him an operator emblem or something. 
---
the usss cat is not a team that would be involved in a war even though many members of team rainbow are anti-terrorist but cat isn't anti-terrorist they are anti-terror attacks which means they stop or protect potus or other high ranking people from attacks but it would be pretty cool 
---
Yeah, but what's the point when there is so little people over there, why not move it here where it's a subreddit about the game itself
---
Twitch or twitch (leave on defense)
---
I got it as a default option on my phone. Using a Xiaomi phone and all XD

same here.. the screenshot was in the bank tunnel afair

Ummm, last time I got onto the r/warframe subreddit there was a lot of discussion speaking about how the meta has gotten stale. And there were many posts regarding other subject, sure there was fan art and memes (which btw isn't permitted here because it's 'low effort' despite the vast majority of the subs content being just that, low effort karma farm.), but there was talk about garuda and how the devs should improve upon this and that, etc. There shouldn't be sub dedicated to just it siege strats, artwork, esports, if not a segregation is created; well, there is already a divide with the meme sub and esports sub being the best buds and hating this sub for being the way it is.
---
On the Y4 reveal stream. Not sure what the last two parts of your comment is about.

Yeah that’s kinda annoying if you’re trying to requeue with friends

A better question might be why you used your phone to take a picture of your screenshot instead of just uploading the screenshot? 
---
But as for the actual issue, what exactly *is* the issue? Is it the black lines on the ice or something?
---
*damage decreased by 25%*
---
This would be a sick look for the stealth operator they have been talking about 
---
Honestly me when audio is glitched to be backwards. I’ve even had the nerve to check for an enemy against an empty wall when breach and entering until a team mate shouted it was on my left
---
Okay there is stuff, but that is all op specific. My point was most of what can be pinged here is specific and not universal. The reason Apex's ping system works so well is that it is universal and not specific to certain legends. Also, when you are talking about these op specific stuff after a certain amount of playtime it becomes unnecessary. If you are new it will help but I'd say anyone with more than 50-100 hrs or above silver-goldish level will know their general role. So you could achieve the same by just pinging a wall and saying themite in voice or text chat.
---
I'd say add enemy here, defuser here, push here but when you go to op specific stuff it can get quite tedious and unnecessary. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I hope they add it to the game but don't expect it to be as impactful or as easy to use as the ping system in Apex
---
I use X. 
---
I think I use different fingers for WASD/locomotion from most people though.

To be fair for the R6 team to be training in houses with holes in the walls make little sense due to no real homes having them.
---
If Ubisoft made the guns actually guns instead of imitation toys that does nothing because everyone in this universe uses their eyes to shoot bullets.
---
The system in PUBG works well but does more fuck you than omg so realistic.
---
So the actual solution is to remove guns and start staring because bullets now officially come out of your eyes.
---
Because rush is inconsistent and they could be smart and play  with a team tactic
---
I showed you my cannoli now answer me.

That’s definitely fat, muscle would look nothing like that

I play on PS4 but I lost all confidence in my mains. I feel as if I'm playing too poorly to even have a main. The game is very stressful and the toxic side of things doesnt make it better. Usually gaming calms me down but Siege just makes me more upset to the point I just have to sit my controller down and take a deep breath 
---
Well I gave two options so what is it?
---
I think March 5 for y4/burnt horizon
---
It's okay. I'm really terrible. The best I've done in Seige was a 1 v 4 and that was probably back in November :(
---
Bro you suck i use barbed wire

What rank are you and do you play ranked or casual? 
---
i mean if you go into a game with randos and are intentionally helping the other team don't be surprised if you get tked.
---
lol is my question rage posting?
---
It's kandit
---
Pulse's head looking shinier than ever

Because when you’re actually playing against people who know what they’re doing, rushing will inevitably get you get killed
---
I use reinforcements
---
I thought this was more than one match after the flash or we were going to the opening of skyrim.
---
I was a Silver 4 but thanks to the toxic system in Ranked and the abandon penalty, I dropped to a Copper 4. I've been playing like shit ever since

I'm using 500 right now but I want to use 1000
---
So....Clash all the time?
---
He is the black ice
---
I have seen this problem is on pc since the launch. I'm new on pc 
---
Yo im on ps4 id gladly play siege with new people idc skill level ive been looking for ppl to play it with
---
But why didn’t you fortify your walls? 
---
For r6 servers i doubt it needs dozens  or hundreds of computers. isay this because of the amount DDOSing attacks taking place. i play on xbox and from first hand experience being in multiple parties with booters and getting ddos
---
her ar is very close to ash's apart from the 20 round mags and little more recoil. She has one of the best gadgets on attack, what do you expect
---
Yes i used my phone and then saw it because siege was opened
---
Me too! Time zones have been a pain and most of my buds don't want to deal with me at all. It's hard finding nice people on Seige for me. Plus I get team killed for no reason 
---
Rook, he has an incredibly useful ability, great kit, welcoming to new players, still useful in high level play, 3 great primary options (2 with acogs), GIGN revolver,  and he's THICC as fuck

Shut up, everyone knows that castle barricades are best.

The problem is that people dont like talking about problems with their favorite game. its much easier and more enjoyable tbh to just upvote fan art, fan content, channel promotions. esports news, game updates.  Going into discussions involves actually maybe criticizing the game and the devs, which fan boys are never going to do- look at any games subreddit
---
We are talking about ela
---
True...
---
That's why I play IQ sometimes. Her gadget ist too strong against trap meta (Yokais are the worst)
---
Sorry 
---
All shall praise the Lord.
---
Agree
---
*two
---
No worries! I never said we were any good. We play to have a good time. We all live in different states now and it's our way to catch up and chill. Always welcoming of new people though! One of our friends just started playing Siege.
---
it has the lowest or second lowest damage per second of AR's on attack, no it is not good
---
why?
---
Cant really blame the matchmaking for people leaving the lobby. It's just casual at least so ot doesn't affect much. It'll make you better in the end to take those teams on.
---
He is a cheesy operator that is a crutch for bad players. With his ability you can win two gunfights for free and your opponents can't do much about it if you have half a brain.
---
My lord
---
My best advice? Take it up with a friend or just play casual. Hope things improve for you
---
That's nice. I try to have fun in Siege and sometimes I do ngl. But recently I gave up on it which makes me sad because I want to become a Twitch streamer and stream Seige a lot since it's my main game 
---
No, to your mmmmmm........ Obviously mate.
---
Idk but then again the enemy didn’t break it so tell cool
---
They're adding a starters game mode in a few weeks which only people under level 50 can play on so it would be easy to learn on there
---
Well if you ever want to join us, let me know. We can try and get you to love it again.
---
U can trade skins. And anyways 2019 invitational is a seasonal skin so it's universal
---
I wish. All my friends are too busy to deal with a burden like me. I'm  trying hard to do the right things in Seige but I think in have to sit down and accept defeat 
---
Well until next season
---
It’s all ogre now...
---
Alright thanks man. I appreciate it. I really don't want to let Seige go but Idk. It might just collect dust like all my other games 
---
Idk what I’m looking at what’s the buff
---
That's not even high
---
Idk I started a month ago and was hooked instantly. I previously played very casual games like fortnite, titan fall, ow, etc. I love the huge learning curve in siege, very refreshing 
---
Ouch. But I like the purge mask :)
---
No it's just gonna be smurf city
---
Imagine a round where no one's in the objective and this guy, Vigil, Caveira and Kapkan are roaming on a night mode map in tower.
---
does it just fires bullets EVERYWHERE?
---
Damn that's good I would pay for this skin
---
Wtf gayfemboyfox? Wtf type of name is that
---
Wallbanged him?
---
That 
---
He means the exclusive one for jager that only ppl at the 6 invitational could get
---
If you have that amount of money and wanna cook yourself in the summer, sure!
---
A) you're not a burden
---
B) if siege is getting stressful, then try a different game. You can come back to it later. Either way, have a nice day and I wish you the very best of luck
---
Yep.
---
We know.
---
An ironic one. But it's not my psn name. I was stupid when I made my account 
---
no u

That mask is a curse.

high ping is not an inherent advantage. It is all about the difference in ping between you and your opponent.

r/rs6teams and discord is the best place to find teammates.

Psn: vishalsethi26 let’s play and have some fun bro :) its all good games bad games, shit happens. Stay strong. 
---
feel free to dm &amp; add me. my buddies &amp; i are looking for ppl to play with all the time.

I want a Lovestory, who make us a drawing or video? 😁

Dont rush with the team mates and get killed in 30seconds get kicked.

I love some Bloons TD.

Mad at spawnpeekers. Get better or get lost!
---
I’m not sure how Unity stores their assets, but games like CSGO It’s completely possible to decompile the game files to acquire a model. I’m sure it’s possible with rainbow. See if anything is on Google or YouTube. 
---
I would rather like this more realistic graphic &amp; animation style!!
---
It's just so unbalanced, you could get into every building far too quickly. Spawn peeking is part of the game, even ubi has admitted they don't work to remove it totally. You have to be aware while you're approaching the building on attack
---
You dont understand that what you killed was tanchanka's clone he stopped time and replaced himself with his clone.
---
E-SPORTS READY
---
Quick tips watch Coconut Brah on YouTube. That’s all his content is and it’s good for even the best players on rainbow. If you want to watch really good players doing crazy peeks and angles watch Beaulo, Skittlz, Godly, Noted, and Macie Jay. 
---
Nice, the new disco bombers presents by ubisoft😁
---
Someone has a suggestion in the comments. The modes would still involve the core mechanics. They just wouldn't be thrown into them all at once. They would be divided among modes.
---
Reddit is hardly usable as a discussion platform, because almost every opinion gets downvoted and every joke gets a ton of likes, dont get me wrong we all want a good laugh once at a time, but serious topics should be more important.
---
Thats the one true way to play Bloons
---
I feel this. I was 13-3 going into round 9 and my teams kills added up to 8

How much did you pay for this cosplay? I live in Turkey. Such products are not produced in Turkey. I always wanted to have a tachanka full costume. I can at least make my dream happen if you tell me how much you spend. I'm sorry for my bad english. Thanks.
---
Nice, shotgun flank
---
Same thing happened to me, I tried to contact ubi and they never responded. I’m still pissed off about it. 
---
Yeah you can. Just set your game preferences in terrorist hunt to extract hostage and terrorist hunt classic only and plau the fuck out of it. I used to earn 25k renown every 5 days doing that with protect hostage included.
---
Blitz and Lion are missing too. 
---
Why does your name change in the video in the feed? Also clips of friends?
---
But that's what makes thermite special 
---
4 months passed and they’ve changed leaning with shields, guess i’m right?
---
Edgy af

Not on mobile sadly
---
Anyone else seen the bots with so much shield desync that they don’t even spawn with a shield or the t bag bots. Terrorist hunt is weird.
---
I would call it: I will I were YOU.

And Finka

I slapped that skin on everything i don't have a special skin for

Yeah but I shouldn't have to. And it costs seconds of time I don't have.

No. His swimming goggles are the best

If that's the case, make sure he contacts the authorities before filming because I've heard stories of filmmakers getting guns pulled on them for props
---
Isn't there already a ping system? I know it's not as good but it's always been there

TT i don’t know how to do that raddit is too hard for me (Korean)

Well, it is a team game where communication is very much essential. If you can, try talking to your team mates.
---
(hence unpopular opinion) 
---
Didn't know what to call them ok lol
---
Customizable recruit with all CTUs.
---
Works like a charm
---
and why it's marked as leak ?
---
It's perfectly normal. Now they don't give the OG OPs in any version as they have reintroduced the legacy unlock system
---
Honestly if you can tough out the casual enough to get to level twenty just go play ranked. It’ll be rough and you probably won’t get the best rank but it’ll be 1000 times better to do it that way. You can’t get kicked and I’d like to think that people won’t tk in ranked just because you’re bad or new to the game. Some people will but not most. 
---
stretched res is THICC
---
Sorry, it won't let me post 2 images at the same time, does anyone knw how to ?
---
Thank you 😊 just seeing if they are allowed yet for the custom games I host for my channel

Probably got matched with squads of plat/coppers on the other team leading to u getting lower ranked people in ur game. Bad luck with teammates either way

Russian gear might be expensive as fuck in the US, but for us Europeans we can get full Russian gear for a whole lot less. And then I'm not talking about cheap China repro stuff but the real deal gear from manufacturers in Russia
---
If your Ubisoft account is linked to your xbox or PlayStation account it will be available when you next go on the game. 
---
In terms of gamesense, Rainbow is very much a game of positioning and movement. The easiest way to achieve victory is by knowing your opponent's location and exploiting it.
---
For example, in a 1v1 skirmish - the defender is inside on objective holding an angle on an entrance, preventing the attacker from going in. If the attacker is stupid, they'll try to counterpeek through that entrance and either die or get lucky. Luck is a risk, and it's more worthwhile banking on a strategy. The only time this kind of gung-ho rush would ever be viable is if there's no time left on the clock to come up with any other way in.
---
Let's look at the attackers options; they've received warning shots through the door so they know the defender is there. Are there other ways around? Can they retreat, move to the bottom floor and shoot the floor from underneath, forcing the defender to flush out or move? Can they exit the building and try to approach the room from another sector of the floor? Can they put a claymore down or use other utility to limit the defenders options? 
---
Siege is played properly with the brain. When you're taking cover, think about your next move. If the defenders have a jager and the site has ADS's, grenades are out of the question, so how else can you use what you have at your disposal? if you can send a drone in and call out to team-mates, maybe they can provide a better approach, giving you time to flank and pressure the defenders.
---
Sound is also a very important factor. Retreating footsteps to a defender mean a chance to pursue or change position safely. In time you'll be able to give callouts on unknown operators just from the sounds of their gunfire or gadgets being used, pay close attention to sound at alllll times, I cannot stress this enough. It can help you prevent breaches from hearing the charges being planted on doors or walls, it can help you counterflank an enemy that thinks they have you by surprise... Point is, if you can't SEE them, first check if you can HEAR them. 
---
Rainbow isn't like other shooters and in terms of tactics the majority of the game can have a very 'hide-and-seek' mentality. If your position is ever unknown to the enemy, you are always at the advantage, and vice versa.
---
I could go on but this is making my head hurt but I hope it helps/

Lmao

I believe it links to your uplay account, which is platform independent

Greyshop is not the best point to compare prices TBH. They are known to sell imitation stuff as real (and overpriced aswell), and there is also some cases of them full on threatening customers to watch their backs if they ever come to Russia after the customer opened a paypal case after months of no contact regarding a purchase.
---
I personally would not reccomend buying from them due to this behaviour.
---
If you want to buy Russian gear there are some good FB groups with honest traders and good prices if you don't have the ability to go to Russia yourself to go and get the gear.
---
As a defender you shouldnt have a drone as a friend.. mabye he lives in the future new season is not here yet
---
Literally : *ash instantly grab mr.hostage*
---
It’s a joke where players make friends with drones
---
It seems to me that if when you lean your point of aim should move.  Like recoil moves your point of aim.  The more you move the more it throws off your aim.  Wouldn't that go a long way to cutting down on the spam?
---
Is this consistent, or just a glitch in you're t-hunt game?

I maintain [a calculator](https://jscalc.io/calc/8u3qoOXgEXB3QAzb) for a couple of discord servers and myself that will calculate your hipfire and multiplier for 1:1 conversions, including for CS sensitivities with more than 1 decimal place.

A clicker (actually called a clacker) is actually not that hard or expensive to make and they do use them on suicide vest. Most times it's because its wierd and not  signal based. They dont want a suicide bomber to blow up to early because it picked up a random phone signal or something. It's the same for Coalition troops. Wires are better. If you want to see how similar this looks look up M57 clacker. It's used for claymores but can also be used on C4. To the right people ig wont look like a radio and that's a promise. Again I'm not doing this to bash the guy but people are getting killed for less and this is something that some scared cop might use as justification.

---
They've introduced a preliminary fix on the test server for next season which does something equally effective; the lean animation just takes longer, making the spam more of a wiggle.

Ok, I'm just telling people how I did it and how FOV and stuff affects sensitivity.

Nice, I never got a legendary alpha pack, but what  was in it?

I mean maybe wait and see what her pick rate is before asking for me changes

Tits a D facial hair huh

Respect, my dude. I would have done the same thing.

It means this player has an element of Outbreak Collection equipped.
---
So long as they don't go back to working like they used to. Old smokes looked nicer, but were way to inconsistent. 
---
I’ll try there, thank you.
---
Well, there are a few here that aren't that (Clash for instance keeps full auto SMG).
---
It means that he has some Outbreak-clothing equipped(headgear or uniform)
---
Pretty sure that means there's an outbreak item on him. I could be wrong
---
That is the image from the outbreak season, that little symbol means that the fuze has a cosmetic item from the season equipped.
---
No problem mate 
---
Same. The people i used to play with theyd call me trash and tk on ranked cause i wasnt sweating like them on it.
---
Next season
---
He Knew It Was Coming To The End, What A True Operator
---
They're trying to save some trees.
---
I say wait for the update, 15th of march should it be released i think. If you keep playing matches you should get to 25K so you can buy mozzie or gridlock as one of the first (seasonpass owners not counted) 
---
Thanks, I've never seen that and I've been on for 2 months lol
---
Which part wasn't clear?

I've made both lesions gu mine and fuzes Matroyshka in cad. Both är STL files and printable. They aren't 1:1 perfect replicas i've just looked att picture and estimated.

You're so retarded that you don't know how to take a hint that says "piss off!"

No?

Depends how many you have opened, does seem pretty unlucky though. The Kapkan head gear is sick though.

35k people is not that low, but compared to the main sub, yeah its not as much, what im saying is that you have alternatives with decent amount of people and you guys refuse to use them because they arent the main subreddit.

If it's basically a 3-0 shutout I'll leave the game. If we're getting our asses whooped that badly, there really is no point in staying and watching
---
The lord is with this one 
---
I've noticed this happening a lot when you flash with the shield... I think it just doesn't protect while you're flashbanging people.
---
Personally I feel the limitless ringing was totally OK.
---
Not sure who they wanna appeal with these changes (GU mine as well) but I guess... how should I put it... not the people who are on the higher end of the ranks.
---
It normally isn't an issue because nobody who plays siege has friends
---
And then you get an abandon penalty, so all is well and good. 
---
I can live with the penalty. Helps me refresh myself after losing like that
---
Pretty much Vigil was a nightmare glad they patched it.
---
I laughed too much at this
---
I thought that was chris pine for a second
---
I use it usually to gather intel, seeing where the enemies are gonna come from, but besides putting a shield or hiding it behind a window, it is easy af to shoot it, not like lesion's mines or kapkan's edd
---
Wow and he didn’t cry about stream sniping? Genuinely impressed!
---
Typically the lower it is the better. But if you’re looking for sensitivity that is comfortable now, go into a custom game and find a clean wall. Shoot 1 bullet at the wall and then be about 5 feet away. Move your camera left to right and try to shoot the same bullet impact. If it’s too the left your sensitivity is too low. If it’s to the right it’s to high. 
---
The crouch button is there to put the player in a crouched position
---
The lean button is there to lean the character to getting a better view.
---
The new leaning fixes are coming because people of quick peeking, not because a random jager decided he wanted to press 2 buttons while shooting at somone in the middle of a room.
---
Whe are not sure if that even is hibana
---
Spawn peeking and running out isn't toxic btw
---
This nerf is way too significant for an op who’s already not too strong. What Ubi’s doing is fine.
---
Dude no. She is very strong as of live. And that's why she needs that nerf asal
---
That doesn't change the fact that she deserves priority as it is her main ability.
---
No, he made 1 full crouch cycle and died while in the second one, very Obviously a spam situation 
---
Add me iiUNEXPLAINABLE

sometimes Ill just run Finka LMG, get the bomb planted and just create a line of crouch height fire that noone can pass through. Noone.
---
AKA why I don't play this shit.
---
Same except it’s the keyboard and mouse users on console that’s out of hand.
---
You are legit saying that defenders phones should break? What? That's straight up OP as it cuts of any intel through cameras 
---
You think I’m the only one with this bug? Me and my friends play all the time together and we all experince this big, siege isn’t a perfect game
---
&gt;it says Pulse, Hibana, Thermite at the bottom of the picture bro
---
Bad wifi
---
Aye, I do agree what Ubi is doing is fine. I just wandered as to what the reddit community was going to think of the little rework i had written. have a good one bud
---
How dare you make a small suggestion. Just leave man /s
---
No idea what that camo is, looks like a weird merge between KSOR and UCP, but definitely not Berezka, and the cut - atleast on the pants - seems completely wrong.
---
The Defender II should be a normal version, not the Molle one.
---
Remove the AK pouches from the Smersh and adjust the straps on the DP28 pouches in a way that they hang at the correct height.
---
P.S.: I see comrade Stalin said it's your turn on the XBox now
---
You need to have some gaps in reality fot a video game
---
&gt; The crouch button is there to put the player in a crouched position 
---
Holy shit, thank you for that Diamond-level insight.
---
&gt; The new leaning fixes are coming because people of quick peeking 
---
Wrong, they are doing it to stop lean spamming, they already such when they first showcased it at the Invitationals a few weeks back.
---
There's seriously nothing you can say in order to defend the spamming meta; if it was 'intended' people would have been doing it since launch and not for the past 6-or-so months.
---
What's server you playing on? 
---
Okay - I’m definitely against crouch and lean spamming. This ain’t that. He crouches very reasonably. He reverses his lean as he comes around the corner. Crouching to minimise profile and leaning around corners is precisely the point. Using the engine physics to abuse centre mass targeting is not.
---
Woman? 🤔
---
now they're even infecting terrorist hunt

The true way to say IQ
---
For a team player type of game - Thermite, Thatcher, Finka, Hibana, IQ, and MAYBE Sledge 
---
Run and gun - Ash, Twitch Blitz, maybe Zofia
---
Long term/Slow &amp; tactical - Glaz, Dokkaebi
---
I cant shoot, but can block - Montagne
---
Never use/ barely use - Ying, Blackbeard, Capitao
---
For fun and games - Fuze, buck, Jackal, sledge
---
This is my opinion, Good luck though!

Outstanding move
---
i dunno
---
She's not the operator Rainbow Six deserves
---
Thanks! 
---
these Ash faces are so funny AND original. they aren’t posted every 5 minutes or anything 
---
Can confirm 
---
If you're having trouble on attack I'd try to keep it simple, which means operators like Sledge or Ash. Could probably add Finka and Zofia to that pool as well.
---
Nothing, just cosmetic. The only real difference I can think of is that it will match his smoke bolt now because his smoke bolt is blue instead of grey.
---
Keep practicing in terrorist hunt
---
Give me yours then, or add me on uplay
---
How did they made Hibana look even more like a weeb? No hate against anime lovers but how did they do it?
---
Why ruin if for those that have other motives in ranked, maybe to rank up?
---
It’s funny and not tryhard 
---
Take all my money!
---
I've never understood this kind of art style. Look at Hibana's mouth detail, then look at the lines on her hood, Thermite's eyes, or Pulse's glasses. It's all over the place. I think they photo bashed a real mouth for Hibana.
---
i figured it was a toight jaw line
---
You need to make more of these!
---
New Monty skin?
---
Found the crouch spammer who plays worse with it gone
---
But she was still on the list of the other classifications on the board

dude stop killing elephants!
---
I love Acing with Kaids DMR/Shotgun. It's just the perfect weapon
---
I think that is exactly what they said. I think this was the game when I turned off text chat.

Oh. Didn’t notice that

I hate plane. It feel cheesy for everyone involved. You’re either in constant fear of a Glaz taking potshots at you uncontested, or you’re in constant fear of Valk’s God-Cameras helping her team run out on you from every angle. Just so much cheese. 
---
yep! you got me.

You should consider selling because they are really good

defending the large bedroom a friend managed to blindfire headshot glaz through a smoke cloud for the winning kill.
---
Yep okay my bad 😅
---
Good ❤️
---
Tbh I don’t even know what karma is
---
u wanna go 1v1  haha
---
I mean it worked for Doc.
---
rewording it to sound more like constructive criticism for the sake of accuracy would have less people calling you a dick
---
This is to keep matchmaking fast I believe. Lots of people have stopped playing. Theres still a good amount of players but if theres not enough people it tends to do that. Maybe if they add a search feature where you accept to wait longer as long as you get same rank maybe itll work.
---
30 seconds left, super far from the objective and two opponents left, he wasn’t going to win either way along with the fact that Vigil has one of the best defender guns and is 3 speed 
---
Lmao.
---
Honestly, the only way to effectively nerf the R4-C is with an Ela-style nerf. Nobody I know on here would go for that though. Horizontal recoil is hated with a passion.
---
Gracias, glad I made someone exhale loudly. 
---
The Halo cutscenes are probably my favourite work of theirs.
---
I just stopped by to make sure I wasn't the subject of this video... carry on. 
---
Are you calling hacks? Because you were positioned behind a wall right outside of two windows so it’s very possible he opened up a window, jumped out, and happened to find you cause you were right there
---
Bugger
---
Yes, medium to high settings should be good.
---
\*Our Battle Will Be Legendary!
---
Here we see a wild valk trying to crouch spam to mess up the hitboxes
---
its more than enough
---
I got 22-4 with Jackal/Zofia and Doc/Cav
---
{-}7 
---
PRAISE THE LORDDDDD
---
His shield could stop bullets BUT not his feels? 
---
How come you're using the 417?
---
That would be super groovy dude.
---
90-100 on medium maybe
---
No, I have a ton of others. Just got himbecause I wanted a new attacker🤷‍♂️
---
Don't stick your dick in the slat
---
Big balls
---
have fun with your complete broken attacker
---
50+hours with our lord and a 1.3 KD what about you fine Tachanka mains?
---
yep
---
Damn! That was a good clutch my friend!
---
I didn't post to get approval, I posted to A) state something that shouldn't in the game, and B) To have a discussion about why it is in the game. You came out with silly arguments and no actual criticism of my points. What you did say was a load of tripe that had no substance, which then led to you arguing with me about the operator I main. Even this last comment is complete drivel.
---
Anything else you'd like me to add or are you going to tell me to stay in my "little world centred around myself" again? 
---
The only tachanka bundle that matters
---
Yes, yesterday I gave up playing for waiting for 27 minutes and 23 seconds
---
This. Those halo 2 anniversary cutscenes are probably the best cutscenes I’ve ever seen in my life. 
---
Fucking great stuff
---
What kinda dumbasses rappel in through Bank Skylight
---
DOC
---
A skill based elite, like Glaz, Kapkan, Thatcher, or Rook...or save up for the new hibana if you play her the most
---
Sometimes I forget that there is other game scenario then bomb
---
"Skill based elite" as in animations that show skill, not just weird poses like the leaked Bandit, or the Blitz, or the Ash one
---
If you are on console he killed you by holding down the left trigger to aim while using the joysticks to align his sight, then using the right trigger to shoot at you resulting in your death. If you are on PC, he did it by using the right click to aim and the WASD keys to move and using the left click to shoot and kill you. Thank you.
---
*Behind*, not inside of. I'd be okay if the player who killed me was behind the body. However he wasn't. He was inside of the body, which meant I couldn't see him. This also let him get the MUCH better angle on me.
---
If Ubisoft made bodies real objects so you couldn't pass through them I'd love that. At least people couldn't use them to hide in. 
---
So 0/10, no realism.
---
Ah yes those are the new AP rounds that shoot through shields /s
---
Waiting for his rework 😅
---
I always thought Mira had one of the best face models in the game tbh.
---
U spent 11 minutes on this? 
---
Redbubble, actually!
---
There was one time some kid pranked me by trapping me in there. 2 minutes later my entire team was forced to watch me walk up and down the hall way while crouching and uncrouching, all the while the enemy team took obj
---
yeah you got hacked, don't know if they are going to do anything, because you got atleast 15 mails saying you got hacked 
---
Ur Not wrong
---
Sorry man I should've put details in
---
Drawing a yellow circle on someone else’s art does not make it yours. You don’t deserve any credit. 
---
When people die their jaws fly open. This is quite normal actually.
---
Well i cant i dont have the adapter and one its not that big of a deal relax 
---
Yeah I was pretty skeptical. If it's true I guess having a quiet weapon would be nice.
---
Way more efficient than dying and restarting a new TH. 300 IQ right here.
---
Thanks! I told my girlfriend that’s the sticker that’s probably gonna get my car keyed....
---
And I got them from Redbubble. You may have to visit a few times, as it seems Ubi is pretty active in taking the icons down, but give it a week or so of infrequent checking and you should be able to find your favorites!
---
It’s the most vertical Op.
---
Only triggers with Caveira, if that suits you.
---
People leaving to prevent interrogation is also a big problem. Cav players being punished for doing nothing wrong is something that should be taken care of. 
---
It works everywhere except in the gun free zones
---
I figured it would, glad ya enjoyed it :)
---
I heard 5 hits. Were you shooting while you were blind?
---
No its hibana 
---
well it was on junk mails ,, no one ever check that xD and the mails their will be deleted automatically 
---
Nah I just accepted my death, if you pause it you can see I’ve got 31 bullets in my clip.
---
Sorry I just looked it up now, I was just guessing because usually it’s on the 4th
---
just makes you feel a little better by clicking it
---
M/K is a big deal
---
Ok Lol 
---
Then something fuckin happened there. No idea how you could tank 5 shots from an LMG and come out with 76%. 
---
The only thing we do know is that Ying is mad
---
"Good bye everybody, I've got to go"
---
Do you think you should be able to choose from the randomized skins though?
---
even nobody checks junk mails, thats still no excuse, and you also didn't had 2 step verification on, so i don't think they gonna help you
---
I guess but theres a learing curve when you switch it will take a while to get back to the same amount of skill
---
I know haha I was so confused, you can see my ping the whole time as well. I’d be fuming 
---
Thanks and she’s probably not wrong. I’m defiantly gonna look there this week.

i don't have any other games on Uplay so i don't use it at all to know about this \^ it was almost one time play or 2

You need to have at least 300 ick to understand the sense of this strat.

My advice is pick doc then down them all and watch them cry out for a few only for you to not give them one.

No, that's Castle's job

It *does not* report people for any in game actions.

It is completely useless on console.
---
People not being at work or seemingly smiling for once in their life so nothing wrong here. 
---
Told it was ying, everyone changed their opinion after the yumiko-pulse thing
---
A part of making a house/ building defense ready is removing unnecessary barriers. This process is especially useful if the enemy tries to gas you out in a realistic scenario 
---
Thanks. I’ll keep pushin 
---
Reflex all day. Just the one I found I played best with and stuck with. I like how much smaller it is than the holo but more clear than the red dot. 
---
what do you mean by "self insertion"
---
You got an email something i can send a rough printable STL file of the detonator to?
---
Yeah that's what I did too
---
Sr25 is a beautiful gun, but it usually gets overlooked because It’s a dmr
---
lng 
---
I exclusively use the holo, even on attack. I'm so used to it I can't change to anything else or my aim goes potato
---
Hopefully not 
---
Some guns I change, but I will always prefer reflex. I like the green better then red aswell
---
Credit to CoconutBrah
---
I stopped after reading the abilities. Sounds like the most OP attacker ever. Healing 25 hp 5 times and an unkillable drone that heals teammates. No thanks.
---
We can hope
---
Sometimes I forget that there is other game scenarios then secure the area lol. 
---
Unload it on my daddy 😫
---
#F
---
Nice, I use holo on maverick just for the close up combat you usually get when you open a hole
---
Echos drone is invisible and I disagree again gu mines become invisible.
---
Green gang haha
---
So fucking dumb how Ubisoft is glorifying obesity. 
---
Nice clutch!
---
Damn they need to fix this tho
---
For high recoil guns I use the holo and I work to keep the outer ring on target. For guns with low recoil I use the reflex and focus on precise shots 
---
I like the red dot. The reticle is small and reflex feels too small for the gun so it annoyes me.
---
I forgot to have him only heal 15 and the drone can only be used 3 times
---
So you are saying that we should give  Gridlock coke? (people who seen s5 will know)
---
Yeah the bullets went into his helmet not his head. Helmet isn’t part of the hit box for obvious reasons. Also, I actually recommend reinforcing that wall you opened with the FO-12
---
Again, it's just a matter of time before the cloaking becomes a viable tool for warfare. 
---
I think ash elite has the best face model
---
will this be updated for burnt horizon?
---
Im digging the side burns bro
---
how slow are you loading into games is the bigger question tho
---
Oh, my mistake. It shouldn't though. 
---
Your point?
---
Just like we should just stand still when lion scans us, right? 
---
I think the problem in this clip is crouch spamming, which fucks the hit box up. Blitz isn’t bad unless the player is really good, but that goes for all ops.
---
Yes
---
Don't rlly have one just thought I'd share it
---
Bruh he's not taking your post you idiot.  All you did is take an in-game photo and draw a yellow circle around it.  It's not like it's your own original content.
---
Just don't stand near reinforced walls or hatches or u will get mavericked
---
Oh. It’s cool, I’ll have to admit.
---
no
---
Repost and repost.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9fwrig/comment/e5zv759
---
It's fine. I agree the community should be happy that he gets reworked but the majority wouldn't like that because of the meme. And ubi can do anything about that
---
I’m not sure if you understand why people likes the other one 
---
I can't get used to the reflex no matter how many times I use it so I use the holo on pretty much everything I use a 1x on
---
I believe it’s because CoD players that play r6s are considered to be the people that play r6s as if it were CoD and not a more strategic shooter.

I have never seen anything like that happen in all my time in siege.   
---
I’ve seen a few Evan_Bradock videos where a Monty player “switches sides” and helps Braddock when he’s defending, but that’s been like 2 occasions.
---
Why? So Thermite could open muted hatch by blowing this wall up? You can hold the hatch even if they have Thatcher with this wall broken, but you can't do anything when its not
---
I didn't know Reddit had likes
---
What's the point of karma anyway lmoa.  
---
Is it just internet good boy points?
---
To whoever downvoted, hope this didn’t hit too close to home
---
Ah.  That's true, but at the same time, not all CoD players play it like that.  Most of us respect that they're two different games and we play them differently.
---
Like, in CoD I'd run in and spray shit to death, in Siege I'm obviously not gonna run in and blindly spray at everything I see
---
If you find yourself losing control of the vertical recoil, you could try turning your vertical sens up a bit to help counteract it
---
I’d love to hear that smoke’s reaction 
---
they usually change faces before an elite model is made, so maybe cav elite confirmed?
---
Tell me again how this isn’t an exact copy of r6maps.com ?
---
"When can we see it dead?"
---
"Shortly after the crouch-lean spamming Ash smells its scent."
---
I've seen that once in a while. Some toxic Monties just walk in a crucial doorway with the full shield, blocking enemies AND teammates. Not the most toxic operator though. The most toxic is Smoke. *badum tss*
---
Jesus H.W. Christ! This made me fuckin' laugh snort at work.. 
---
That ACOG probably cost more than the computer
---
Yep those were the spawn peek days
---
I wonder if Gridlock ever fought in bum fights, was in the Yakuza, or was addicted to cocaine?
---
It means FCB in Russian not a fraternity lmao
---
I totally agree, but wouldn’t it be best to have a strong community of a competitive game where all the characters are balanced, and there isn’t a character whose design fundamentally goes against the design of the game?
---
No
---
Here's hoping for a meme filled bio 
---
Rook
---
Coming from one plat to another; the correct name would be Gold 0
---
There's no need to be sarcastic :/ that's just plain rude. Had a bad day or maybe you're just generally looking to put someone down because that's who you are?
---
*smootch*
---
I prefer the cam in the middle trees, they never find it unless they bring IQ 
---
Hopefully.  I love using Cav!  They should do something cool, like, maybe a Stealth based outfit?  Maybe they could just give her an all black military outfit with night vision goggles.
---
In my group there's a running joke that Cav is one of the Assassins but in all honestly an Assassin Robe wouldn't be that bad as her elite skin.  It fits her playstyle and personality perfectly.
---
Isn't that just hard to use Lesion? 
---
Ya but why not give recruit skins and stuff
---
Nope. You pay to support the devs, they won’t support you back though. Really pathetic of them. 
---
the best is the 4th one
---
"9.No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed."
---
:--)
---
Insulting is just a way of compare stuff in a "bad" way so why not.
---
Geting airsupport after 5 kills is realistic? Using it directly from the field also seems right?
---
My problem with cod is not the casual gameplay it is that the game is just not good. In comparison with titanfall u realize how bad the movment and the gunplay is plus the fact that killstreaks are just such a bad thing in general that the game is not good in my opinion. The game wants to be realistic but isn't, the game wants to be fast paced but it isn't, The game doesn't know what it want to be and ends up being worse than every other aaa fps. Yes mw 2 and 3 wasn't that bad but it in the end these games were the beginning of the end. 
---
The ranking system is so messed up, to think I'm in the 4th highest rank and people are still this clueless and toxic is mind boggling.
---
Featuring Vigil's parents.
---
Don’t mean to damper the mood, but I got my first black ice for the commando in my second alpha pack ever
---
You’re fuckin ten ply bud
---
I think this will be in the live game once next season drops as well as 3:30 in casual instead of 4:00.
---
Thankyou. I agree that it should be quieter, I exaggerated the sound just so that people not listening through headphones would have a good idea of what’s going on in the video.
---
Scorpion is the most unreliable weapon in the game

You also missed the part where I said those traps are lethal while the airjab is not which is why they're more identifiable.

THATS THE POINT! why should players like beaulo be able to tip fire while others players cant? its because they are tryhards. 
---
Oh intresting
---
I had the exact same problem a couple days ago. What’s happening is the game is not fully installed yet, so you are using the vanilla version of the game, meaning the updated Glaz scope is not in it yet, so that results in a glitch where you can’t use his sniper scope at all. Just wait till the game is fully installed to do it, or just do it, you don’t really need it tbh

Yeah I like this change. Casual will still be bad but it’ll be better to prepare for rank since you can see what site you are defending and better prepare for it with certain ops instead of guessing every round.

Im not really sure of any methods. I personally just made it a habit to drag down when I'm shooting. Maybe work on that or something?
