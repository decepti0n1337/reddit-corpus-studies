Honestly I do this all the time in casual because I‚Äôd rather take a lost than my team lose when the points are 2 and 2. And I respect anyone who leaves as well for their team. Mad Respect.

Can you please try to do it with a different operators gun

That‚Äôs one character my dude. Other characters like Thatcher using the AR33 or any of the characters wielding shields for example would have serious problems killing him. Additionally 140 hp would give characters tons of more opportunities of survival from both grenade and claymores that they wouldn‚Äôt have normally. The game should award attackers for smart plays, not reprimand them.
---
Why don‚Äôt you just use the Asian or African servers then?
---
Commando pro?
---
I want an April 1 update where smoke brings actual babes that he sends after people.
---
and y‚Äôall thought di vinci was dead üò§üò§üò§
---
By 4.2 it'll be pretty straightforward: any team damage, except for traps (claymores/kapkan) and timed breaches (Thermite, Hibana) will cause RFF when the damaging player either kills someone (and the dead player verfies it was intentional) or does enough damage to trigger RFF.
---

---
It's only confusing right now because the explosives aren't coded properly.
---
its both. read the ubi responses all throughout this post
---
I feel like that other than Finka (Who i still consider to be good in most scenarios), the rest of s tier is pretty solid.   
---
A tier are the ones that fit most cases but lack that extre OOMPH that gets them to S tier.
---
B tier, I feel i probs undersell how good ash is and may change her. But I feel these guys are good but are weaker than others.   
---
C Tier: Dropping Clash, Honestly, I dont even know what i was doing that was my bad.  
---
D Tier: Frost and Mute seem to the biggest complaints here.  I think these two come down to placements and how well they are placed. Sure they have their niches but i feel that their are characters that do this better. Of course i can be wrong and i probs am but Im willing to defend my points.  
---
F tier: This is the biggest one as many people think BB should higher. I can see why but as ive said in another comment, I find him underwhelming.  Sure he can hold down angles without worrying about being pinged in the head but that is it. his guns feel aight but i just cant feel better bout him. Will bump him above F tier as clash deserves his spot.   
---
Other than that, that is my reasoning. Feel free to argue ill try to defend my points and if you can change my congrats. But otherwise this is what I think and even if its garbage, Ill leave this up anyway no matter how much flame gets flak gets thrown my way.
---
*and*
---
never change siege
---
Before, I didnt feel he was s Tier prob high A tier (prob should of adjusted to show that apologies)
---
As a cav main I agree but people don‚Äôt just leave to avoid the interrogation some do it just so they don‚Äôt get the death on there record.
---
I had the same thing happen back in operation chimera when I was watching pro league and sat in cue for an hour
---
That's even more lame. Understandable though.

I don‚Äôt like doing ranked on video games because it takes the fun out of the game especially as a solo. Can‚Äôt tell you how many people call me a ‚Äúbot‚Äù or toxic for being unranked and playing casual :|
---
A hundooo percent
---
Depends which gun. Muzzle break for dmrs and flash hider for the rest
---
I think there should be a suicide mechanic where you just die instead
---
Use the famas lol
---
Or why Capitao didn't play outside of the windows. When I go for that plant I'm usually on the opposite side after.
---
I'm guessing here but I'm pretty sure its the thing that determines your rank in Ranked.
---
I do, but I like DMRs
---
Yeah i would be okay with that. Should take a few seconds to do it though
---
So flash hider overall is the better attachment?
---
Especially nice when your breaching a random window and the points stat says kapkan and frost mat broken it just tells me how much I was saved and makes me happy for a bit
---
Lmao i‚Äôm a boosted plat how am I supposed to get diamond.
---
Oh ok that makes sense and I think I remember now that that is what it is. Thx

Drone parkour is the new in

Bc ur using l85a2 on my main main. Shotgun or Ar33 plz

---
I reached 20 minutes once but not 48 minutes, Ubi servers back it again.
---
Now imagine at least two or three of those people in EVERY game, be it on your team or the enemy team. When they're on your team, they take all of the kills and you end up doing nothing in the background or you die right away because there are always those on the enemy team as well.
---
Not to mention it was a 13-0 in what was originally a first to ten.
---
I would increase the flash radius.
---
You can leave anytime you want anyway whether there is a leave option. And what happens if real life happens. Would you rather them just go afk and get booted anyway? Im not saying that is going to happen, most of the time people leave just to leave, but still. You cant remove the leave option.
---
Holy fuck the spider Man one was the best. Are there more of these or was it just a small clip?
---
Nice clutch!
---
I wish they looked more hong kong-y - maybe that dark navy uniform the SDU wears. Not quite sure when the Hong Kong SDU would be in the desert but whatever
---
As a pc player id love to play vs consoles so im all for it!
---
Part of me misses this game, the other part of me was tired of getting called the N word in comp matches.
---
Say I'm opening a rotation hole with a shotty and a teammate who isn't paying attention walks I front of me on the other side of the wall and takes damage? Will that automatically activate RFF on me or do they get to choose that option?
---
What is not clear to me is this: does this entire system auto activate or will it always be up to the victim to choose it or both?
---
I have a smurf and I only use it to dick around like going onto the ladder on bank and seeing how long we can be there. But sure as hell people have them to feel good about themselves
---
No teasers yet and the date has not been announced
---
Ok I‚Äôm not the only one that out in public seing one of theses and think this
---
No

---
that's ubi for you
---
Blunt, but thanks
---
Yeah, I have no reason to fight with you. I love having conversations about siege.
---
*Boink*
---
Holy shit yes. Finally punishing toxic squads
---
italy before and after switching to the allies
---
The sound of M870 recruits in the distance is the most terrifying sound in siege not even Blitz is that scary.
---
It's to the point that for many people, it's considered mandatory to play on mnk with a computer monitor if you wanna be competitive in siege. I told these guys I was queuing with for 5 matches that I played on a tv instead of a monitor and they booted me from the party and ghosted me.
---
I'm not gonna try to convince you that they do but try looking some up on twitter and their streams if you care enough to do so.
---
An ace is when one player gets 5 kills in one round.
---
So before I say anything , I play on console so I‚Äôm not entirely sure about PC but could you still alt F4 to leave?
---
Thanks I‚Äôm itching for the next season lol
---
I told my friend whenever he messes up big time he will get a .357 round to his skull, he actually turned his game around and got better
---
Most definitley.
---
If it makes you feel any better, this is 100x better than fanart or cosplay
---
Lesion for sure. His mines are good for locating enemies and have been invaluable to me at times. Same with ela mines.
---
And I'm pretty sure I'm reading that wrong but none of those are original defending ops
---
Yes
---
It's good, I mean his gun is still pretty strong, so I would make him either c or d tier in my opinion
---
To clarify he didn't just lose 13-0. He lost a FIRST TO 10 WINS 13-0.

Ok I should reword this post, I understand that things in life get in the way but leaving the game because you‚Äôre mad or because your teammates are ‚Äúbad‚Äù is not a legitimate reason to leave. Especially in ranked.
---
I kinda like this except glaz, unless you mean post nerf
---
Yeah if defenders don't pay attention to the sound, they are basically screwed for 3 seconds....or the entire round.
---
But the l85 recoil is one of the easiest ones out.
---
That‚Äôs because he can only reinforce one wall / gadget per shock wire.

You can't stop that, sadly. They'll just force shut the console. Humans are inherently salty and idiotic, and nothing we can do can solve that.

I feel like a silhouette of a bomber should be in the background to replace thanos

As a expert on this use Doc's or Rook's P9 pistol with supressor.

First the hostage will get downed by 4 shots, then 3 shots, 3 shots, then it will always get downed with 2 shots by the suppressed P9
---
The way I‚Äôve done it. 
---
Go to their profile. Push the options button on your controller. From there it asks what you want to report, along with a couple of follow up questions. The last bit has a box for you to type exactly what/why you‚Äôre reporting in detail. The very last part asks if you would also like to block the person. 
---
Then you should receive a message from Sony, thanking you for the report. Or/also one that says they‚Äôve taken the appropriate action. I‚Äôve only got the one where it says they‚Äôve taken action a couple of times, idk if that means they‚Äôve banned them, suspended them, made them change their user ID etc, or what. And maybe the ‚Äúthank you‚Äù messages they did nothing, or warned them? Not sure about all that.

Devs said house has always been an unbalanced map, but it‚Äôs an og map, it was THE map that represented r6s, trailers were made around house, and it brings back nostalgia for old players. Yes it is the most unbalanced map there can be and spawnpeaking is pretty bad, but it‚Äôs a map where you can loosen up, go all recruits and just mess around and have a good time.

Ranked will come out of Beta next season so hopefully they will address this because adding pick and ban to ranked doesn‚Äôt really qualify it for being out of beta. Matchmaking changes are a must. We should hear about the next season here at the reveal on May 19 and hopefully they have what you, I, and many others want.
---
Why don‚Äôt you use a sight?
---
Lion worked out better than a Beaver that hated ACOGs
---
Esports are MASSIVE in this game, there's tons of teams like Faze, Ninjas in pyjamas, G2, Penta, Empire the list goes on and on
---
There's a whole pro league. Games can be watched on twitch
---
Next thing you know we gon have fat gridlock... oh wait.
---
HAHAHA It took me way too long to get this xD
---
One word, incel
---
Headshots have 50x damage multiplier. He probably did 2 damage to someone (through multiple walls) and with the hs multiplier its 100dmg (injure)
---
Damn
---
Or they can just take the T-hunt teamkilling mechanics and put it into multiplayer...guess that's too difficult for brain dead ubisoft.
---
All the newcomers have moved to casual, what an evolution
---
The ESports community is one of the biggest.
---
This game hates children
---
On the contrary I do this all the time in ranked with the same results it‚Äôs hilarious
---
Yeah I think there a few

Yes, you can use a controller on PC. No, it will not let you play with console players.
---
Def: Alibi, Castle, Rook, Bandit and Frost

I suppose the changes to lion didn't have the desired effect then? How would you even go about balancing him?

Well this was last playday and the match ment nothing to either teams bc Penta couldn't get to lan anymore and LeStream had their lan spot locked down

If you‚Äôve not watched my other clip of this I would recommend u do

Yeah, it's supposed to be opened up. I can't understand why people want to reinforce that and cordon an entire area off for the attackers to plant.

Or maybe they were just chilling in casual and waiting for someone to play ranked with. It's not a rage quit when you don't leave immediately btw.

Its only a 10% boost as opposed to a regular 2x boost, fair warning. You also get a shop discount though which is really nice

it's actually pretty obvious trick, could do it without youtubers

Hello PanteraRockBob, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bm3fd7/torrid_bundle/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Ash was picked too often. 99% pick rate was the R4C, 99% pick rate was with ACOG. Removal of ACOG for R4C was to have people even considering the G36C as a weapon pick.
---
So as it‚Äôs ying... why isn‚Äôt it yellow?
---
Why is there advanced gadget deployment. WHY
---
J√§ger C? Are you kidding me?
---
Claymores dont get jammed as far as i know
---
nonono, i bought the game again,
---
YES. There's so few skins that it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb on.
---
Nice
---
I have the Chimera headgear for Ying and the Sunsplash one for Lesion so I'm good :D
---
We know why, because R4C has a lesser recoil as well as a better fire rate. Nerfing the recoil could have made R4C a viable option for people who prefer fire rate and the G36C for people who prefer precision.
---
Tell me if i am wrong.
---
Maybe
---
He said assault rifle not ar33
---
Better idea: Make his ability equip the weapon (as a movable turret) like a third gun with a small shield like blackbeard's who protects the body (and not the head). The "machine gun" will have a set amount of ammo (ex. A magazine of 150 and no reload, so it'll run out of ammo) will be an automatic (but low fire rate) with high damage and recoil.
---
Look an ash player using the g6 a rare sight!
---
Outback has none. Set your preferences to only go there
---
What weapon skin is that?
---
All they will do is they remove the beta text from the menu.
---
It‚Äôs not a bad gun and has an acog unlike the R4C now RIP so I take it most of the time on ash
---
To better visualize:
---
TF2's Heavy's weapon but more slav looking.
---
Has a small body shield with hp.
---
No reload. (100 ammo or so)
---
The turret's actual fire rate.
---
Slows down to shield speed.
---
~50 dmg (or a value who grants a 2 hit kill on light/med armor and 3 hits on heavy armor)
---
Extremely high recoil.
---
Ya I have noticed that, my only problem is that I like to do most of the ranked maps for the hunt to memorize them. But I'd I'm ever going  just for aim training I'll do that.
---
They also should ‚Äúbip‚Äù
---
Why are you so upset? Is that your usual response to polite disagreement? Thats very immature, you should work on that.
---
Currently, there is nothing stopping a griefer walking in front of a teammates bullets twice to get them kicked and banned. Yet this is almost unheard of because in reality most players, even griefers, dont like getting shot.
---
With this system, the 'reward'for such griefing has actually been reduced from a 30 minute ban to just being killed/damaged for that round  which the griefer can achieve more efficiently by just headshotting you once. 
---
So no, your complaints have no validity once somebody thinks them through.
---
Hahahahaha Kapkan as a B. I wish.
---
I would love the next one to be Lion!

Nah, everyone already knows that console players fall for stupid shit.

That is exactly what my friend is saying! The learning curve is huge, so it takes very long to know even one map.
---
nothing like a bit of kevin macleod music to remind me of the minecraft days
---
Yeah thats why I like twitch, also needs to learn which wall I can fire through
---
Oh okie. What bus depot though?

I'm missing 2 trophies on PS4 and getting a breaching charge kill is one of them

For playing a video game like a video game instead of some excuse of a sport? Btw I'm not talking about griefing. I only play casual as well after the dumpster fire that is Overwatch ranked.

All you do is the the hostage and cav and revive him or her. I wasn't  team killing or throwing on purpose.

I can‚Äôt believe this wasn‚Äôt a chanka ace

And this was the wrong subreddit

This is rare to find in ranked but common in Casual...
---
Keep playing man,join the R6 discord and other OCE R6 groups and see if you can join up with some fellow new players and at least one experienced one as well
---
You don't need a group, you need to play ranked, once u get into gold level this things hardly happen.
---
I've seen it before lol

Finka one is amazing! Once I paired it with legendary headgear from hallowen, and lava skin weapon she looks like a god damn demon!

OK fixed it

Seems strange.

A screen.
---
Aw, shit here we go again. Time to start theorizing.
---
Something like this for a coin flip would actually be amazing in my opinion. But there‚Äôs no practical way to actually execute it.
---
Im not saying that. Im saying he likes to go trolling in casual which usually entails TKing, throwing rounds, rushing outside on defence with no real chance, etc. and some of us play Casual cause we don't want to get screwed as bad as we do in ranked. And when people come to casual to troll and screw around with the other players it gets annoying. Im not saying it's an excise for a sport but it's supposed to be fun for people. Not just the one person trolling.
---
Generally no some use it on their secondary but your opponent will hear you anyways if he‚Äôs close enough that it would matter.
---
I see nothing wron- wait u play the lord a whole bunch
---
Give Frost deployable shield back. The bulletproof cam is worthless for frost.
---
No. Arguably tied for extended barrel for the worst attachment in the game.
---
All it does is take away the white circle that enemies get when you shoot at them and miss. Just don't miss, and also they'll be able to tell where you're shooting them from without the indicators
---
Great shout! I never even thought about him but makes sense. It's a minor buff

Siege is so broken right now

I six inch blade never loses reception............and it never misses echo

Thank you very much, I figured it'd be a nice touch.

An operator that can throw knives. Because why not
---
I remember I got a knife ace on Oregon and it was the best feeling in my life, and to this day I haven't gotten another one :(
---
Well they either have access, have broken the 2fa and very specifically used it to get into your account or you're mistaken.
---
We gatekeeping secure now?
---
It's hard to explain in words. All I can say is Go to YouTube or set up a custom match try it for yourself. You'll get the gist real quick. Although, it's still an insanely fun map of course.
---
Nope
---
Wow
---
They still have to tease the new season otherwise the need for a marketing team that works on seasonal releases would be unnecessary, it just coincides with the release of the new RFF update. There are still 3 more days left of this week.
---
2 theories: 
---
1. Classroom wall has become like that corner in armory/CCTV hallway (border) where Impacts don‚Äôt work sometimes.
---
2. It‚Äôs a visual glitch, you can walk right through but the wall is still there.

Yes ik that (unless you used a graphics card which is designed for real-time ray tracing). I was just wondering why the reflected environment (which changes as you turn) was reflecting a place that seemed completely unfamiliar.

Nice charm

Their twitter teases used to be on a Tuesday and they've never put up a timetable way before their twitter teasers and they keep teasing the fucking downtime for the update for the friendly fire.
---
the finals are the 19th and teasers are 2 weeks before finals and it's always been that way.
---
This is why i hate Ying mains. No one supposes this quick rush.
---
The operators name is nick cannon and his gadget is slime. He is an attacking operator and He has 3 available and is able to spill it all over a hallway making it hard for defenders to flank because if they walk over it slime gets on their face and disorientated them and makes them slower. 
---
This started out as a joke but not gonna lie this sounds like a pretty good idea

I can tell a toxic person from a normal one, I‚Äôve been there. You are a toxic person. I will repeat what I said before, those who are toxic deserve to filter; and my assumptions are well placed, as the stereotype for toxic siege players are much more than just that. Saying ‚Äúcould you post a less awful video?‚Äù Has many negative connotations, and seeming as you can‚Äôt understand that I‚Äôll translate it. First of all, starting it with ‚ÄúCould you‚Äù already births an accusing and more directed message, and then adding the ‚Äúawful‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpoor quality‚Äù amplifies that. My favorite part however, is the passive aggressive question mark and sentence structure; as instead of just giving actual feedback in a normal manner, you feel the need to make it more personal and insulting. Is this a result of you believing Rainbow is a perfect game, and not being able to take when a suggestion of it being flawed? Or perhaps it‚Äôs you not knowing how to converse normally, so adapted to your environment. We might not know the answers, but we can only speculate.
---
Doesn‚Äôt chin count as a headshot?
---
They said the situation is undesirable, not that they regretted any particular action. Whats being debated here even? OP is simply frustrated because it would seem his CPU is no longer officially supported, I don't believe CS has done anything particularly wrong
---
Man this this breaks my heart almost as much as Avengers Endgame's ending did üò¢. The feels homie.
---
Where did you get the lower rail attachment
---
I dunno what this game counts as a headshot and how into-detail they go but realistically it's very much possible to survive a chin shot
---
All my friends talked about how much they hated it but when I got R6 and Bartlett was in casual, I loved it.
---
The green hair is actually a nice touch, despite it not being accurate.
---
&gt; I can tell a toxic person from a normal one, I‚Äôve been there. You are a toxic person.
---
And you're basing that on "Could you post a less awful video?" Slight hyperbole perhaps.
---
&gt;First of all, starting it with ‚ÄúCould you‚Äù already births an accusing and more directed message
---
You have a problem. You read so much that simply isn't there.
---
&gt;My favorite part however, is the passive aggressive question mark and sentence structure; as instead of just giving actual feedback in a normal manner, you feel the need to make it more personal and insulting.
---
There's not enough information to give proper feedback, which is why I asked for a better quality video (and forgot to ask for the top right stuff immediately).
---
nice
---
German sounds like Hitler
---
it was only because my hair is green and I wanted to keep it green lol
---
Ah, a frost main, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
The guy in the hallway would have killed me because of my potato aim
---
i dont think it would matter if she got it tbh, and because new players start off with mute many times, its more helpful on him so they can see what they are jamming 
---
but i also dont see why they wouldnt just add it to her anyways, it would actually be really helpful (almost too helpful) on lesion
---
Must had
---
I always shoot the speakers, but half the time I have to keep my eye on my teammates when I do it, because any time you start shooting in spawn you're likely to have someone turn around and kill you.

Does twitch carry a sword?!

This clip is insane, but I only downvoted so someone could be 69

Yes :)

I like the finka one
---
Banana
---
Simple answer, experience. I know it sounds cheap but it's really the only way. If you want to spend extra time and effort something I do with new maps is go into a custom game on that map, pick an operator with a lot of soft breach, like buck or sledge with shotgun, and just open up a hole in every soft wall and hatch and floor I see. Then I find the locations for the objectives and try to think of good entry ways, knowing all the walls and hatches which could potentially be breached, and knowing vertical lines of sight onto the objective. Of course this doesn't mean that those strategies always work, but it does help me with learning where rooms are in relation to each other.
---
I was stuck in copper last season - there were a bunch of smurfs, but the bigger issue were all the trolls that just team-killed, called out intel etc.
---
The entire defense peeking the first door to the building isn't sweaty it's just laziness.

Ugh. We all have bomb disabled in my group!

You didn‚Äôt know this? This has been around since Ying first came out
---
Very sad indeed
---
with this headgear they will see you from  a mile away and it doesn't even  look so good
---
Who agrees that if you knock someone, and they are still knocked, and they die, you should get the kill no matter what
---
Instead of reading the plane noise as *EEEEEEEYEEERRROONGGG*
---
I read it as 
---
*CUUUURRRRRRRRRFWOOOSSHHHHHHUMMM* 
---
As like a fighter jet or something
---
Right, my thoughts as well. I bought a couple defenders first because out of the base ops there were a lot more attackers I enjoyed using than defenders. 
---
Leaning pretty heavily towards Maverick.
---
In two weeks the operation will have already been revealed, it's coming May 19yh
---
Fair enough
---
This sub and every legendary skin basically
---
If there was gonna be an Operation Health 2 they wouldn‚Äôt have released a full Y4 roadmap detailing next seasons ops. Ubisoft just refuse to admit their game is broken.
---
how does that work
---
Thats pretty good, all down to the hair and face though how Caveira is supposed to shoot her Luison with an empty magwell is beyond my small little mind.
---
I mean, make just one friend by not either being rude or toxic, I get atleast a friend req every other day playing casuals, playing with one other person and no one period can kick you.
---
Is it gonna be rff immediately or after a certain number of team kills?
---
I realized it didnt post the whole thing
---
This seems to be a clip from a knife only round, right at the beginning an attacker says theyll come inside meaning they will have the knife fight inside rather than defenders coming out. More evidence to this is the fact that Blackbeard kills a defender with a pistol and is TK'D for it.
---
Idk if OP intentionally made the title vague, making people wonder if he just ran in getting a ton of knife kills or just having a good knife only round.
---
Pretty
---
What? You couldn't read a simple graphic with images? Didn't seem to hard for me...
---
Well Im not trying to be rude but u literally did miss all your bullets on the head .
---
Thtas just bullying LOL XD
---
the con wouldn't let me have a magazine :(
---
It actually may become an useful tactic if the Season 3 leaks are true.
---
Huh, strange. Due to a accidental discharge?
---
Yes, it is a Forgive/Punish system. Go read the article about RFF.
---
it does actually but just in look of the screen
---
It was casual tho.
---
That's the default skin right? 
---
Oh wait.
---
I did not, he cleaned up most of it though, but yeah probably.
---
Also I did see people vote kick/banning people in the game just before I caught my ban.
---
Well, probably the operators teasers will come next week then.
---
yeah, it was a paintball pisto
---
Did I not word that correctly?
---
Impose that meme with that guy who slaps everyone
---
how is that op. literally useless
---
It was pretty fucking weird he just flicked on my head like it was nothing.
---
kinda defeats the purpose of alibi
---
Oof. But then again you didn't have to fill it. Just show it's empty.
---
Anyways, great cosplay! Who's next?
---
Well good luck searching for that eluding last opfor caveira or Vigil in fortress.
---
I feel like the most new map what has come out, has more spawnpeek places then Bartlett, so trade them in the playlist lol
---
That was actually copper 4
---
nah bro. bbs ar is literally the worst in the game

I wish i had an answer for you

Play the operator IQ in custom games and walk around with her gadget. It will help you identify where all the cameras are as you walk around and learn the map
---
Thank you, my exams did take priority at the time and I wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't focus on them. I tried to do this kinda thing many times throughout the last few years but always felt they never went as well as this one.
---
I posted this 2 weeks ago? Gu and Trax can be seen where the opponent gets effected. Literally by stepping on the utility. I hope they do anyway
---
is there a suggestion flair? I did not see one
---
It‚Äôs a pain, but don‚Äôt try to learn the maps, just play and enjoy. If you really wanna learn maps, play ops like maverick, vigil, and cav because they require you to go in new places.
---
they did this because they had nothing to play for in this match
---
Happy Cake Day, our lord and saviour!
---
It's not about the strat, it's about the greed of mine :)
---
If the team against you is that bad, how bad is your teammates who are dying to them?
---
Seems secure to me
---
Right. All these dumbasses on here saying Y4S2 and I'm sitting here after the reading the pinned post wondering what actual time does it come out today.
---
True but people still do it in secure and they‚Äôll team kill if you don‚Äôt or even do some times. I think with the timer on casual and the fact that it‚Äôs secure is the whole reason why secure is the most toxic
---
The Echo effect timing with the drop
---
The problem with the picture was that the battery, which is used on walls and supposed to be well hidden, was pretty exposed and on hatch, where it is not supposed to be.
---
Man, the new For Honor update looks weird
---
Yeah, it's pretty shitty.
---
It was self-referential. I posted a thread on this about 2 weeks ago and hardly anyone looked at it. But it's good to see that this one made it somewhere, as I think a lot of players would agree with this if they saw it.
---
Ohhhhh I gotcha! Yeah most of the issues I run into is in secure. Usually the people who reinforce on bomb are new to the game
---
Nice. ü§ôüèª
---
Just to say as well, I've never posted this before
---
Yo where the fuck is your head?!?!
---
This was actually pretty descent. You just need to work a bit on aim and positioning, and you're good to go!
---
You get that when hitting teammates. its a tk indicator
---
 ..
---
And that makes me BIG SAD
---
If you needed to play secure to get out of bronze, I‚Äôm sorry for you lol. There‚Äôs a reason bomb is exclusively played by the upper ranks
---
One word. Dicks
---
He is an operator, but you don't get damaged when you step on gu mine until the first tick
---
If you put your charge in the middle of 2 walls it will destroy portions of both
---
I'll be happy only when the hellish Trinity all get fixed- chalet, kafe and sky. I love sky, but it's f**ked up. Herdford and fortress at least have more than 1 staircase and 3 defendable sites. The Trinity are just utter cabbage waste.
---
I‚Äôm offended
---
They‚Äôre doing it wrong they‚Äôre supposed to kill you on defence to see if you drop a phone and know if they have dokkaebi not the other way around
---
Please, take acog with you... For the good times....
---
Nah I‚Äôm still in middle school but at least I don‚Äôt get mad at people online and try to bully them.
---
Yeah jackal is like 20 times more aids as a roamer than grid. You cant really do anything about jackals track other than silent step as cav. Where as with grid you can go elsewhere and there usually is other ways.
---
This will surely get abused
---
I agree
---
Ja genau TIm! Was soll das?
---
Good one man really impressive
---
Yeah sky could use an overhaul and take away the emphasis of the balconies.
---
Would most likely be echo, or Hibana.
---
I'm guessing echo.
---
And I'm hoping an empire set comes out, but it's most likely going to be for ash. Nevertheless, joystick plays nomad a lot now, so I'm hoping for that.
---
I was silver 2 during that. I keep going down cuz i dont have teammates that play like i do :(
---
i was thinking has this been added or have I not notice , thanks guys
---
Too many napkins
---
I‚Äôve done this and destroyed both of thermoses charges...
---
You're console player? I'm PC
---
Yeah I get what you mean I was just throwing the idea out there to see what others think :)
---
They should add less lines of sight for attackers. That's the issue with the offices and other site. Kitchen is too exposed, and bedroom is basically a Japanese kids bedroom. There's so many issues but layout should be touched first.
---
Okay mister silver, that's not how this game works
---
People need to watch more It's Always Sunny
---
I was referring more to tachanka.
---
yo. chill out cunt
---
true
---
Do they post the census once it‚Äôs completed?
---
maybe
---
Just don't team kill and you wouldn't even notice a thing.
---
Can somebody please give me a quick yes or no on whether the forgive system is going live or not?
---
Teamkill/suicide rates spike for the next 48 hours as people try to work out how it works.
---
Won't go down while your shooting it
---
What? Elaborate, please.
---
At least it‚Äôs one step in the right direction
---
It stopped in the air before I started shooting.
---
Any time, it's always a work in progress, shield ops are always a tricky bunch add more challenging parts to the puzzle and they get harder to fix, maybe add an op that counters blitz in some way like an option that gives goggles that lessen the effect. But not sure, they still need to fix the shields hit box it can be hard to tell where you are in reference to others for protection.. but yeah we shall see!
---
First of all, I‚Äôm gold. But that‚Äôs irrelevant. And secondly, yes, that‚Äôs how the game works. If I‚Äôm interrogated, I don‚Äôt just stand around waiting for death to come around the corner. It sounds to me like you‚Äôre being too passive.
---
But, as you said, we already have cap. Why him?
---
Stare master
---
That's it ejecting, quick animation
---
I have r6 on PC. Im just waiting for my friends to all get PC's so i can swap. Im pretty ok with keyboard and mouse. My first match i was twitch, i said something like "im new to siege on PC, i come from xbox" there was 3/4 votes to kick me out, one guy didnt vote me out cuz he was from ps4, so i guess he could relate. I ran into clubhouse mindlessly and got an ace within like 40 seconds of the round starting, i was so proud. But obviously that was dumb luck and my reaction time.
---
So has the lesion hostage exploit been patched yet or has this "reverse friendly fire" taken precidence over fixing one of your game modes?
---
Wow great work üëç
---
Here‚Äôs hoping both Sky and Chalet get a rework next year. I‚Äôd be interested if they can maybe rework Bartlett and Tower too to. Tower there probably isn‚Äôt much they can do but Bartlett has some potential.
---
Actually looks pretty good, the slow motion parts look a bit bad but It's the capped fps of consoles nothing you can do about that.

Why fuze
---
Normally it goes down immediately. Maybe its because I placed it on crouch height.

Mute had it first

Mute jammer should have interrupted the claymore

This concept is for a defender

Just record it on your console

I'd say compared to Finka's default at least it's less bright so I was glad for it there.
---
Why would you shoot your teammates?
---
The point is that it would be good to see how far the range actually is when placed.
---
He did get away with it, he killed 2 of your teammates lol
---
I played since day 1 and still watched them all they're good videos and you never know what you might pick up from them seige is all about learning, I've not played a game where every death makes me think about what I could have done differently or how I could have played the situation better or more effectively to help my team
---
That will still happen.
---
That is exactly the problem though. If Person A is now invulnerable, then Fuze can set off his charge while A rushes the site, and the defenders can't do anything. If they stay they get fuzed and if they run they get shot.
---
Have you learned nothing from [doctor who?] (https://youtu.be/mdEkFj4HtGI)

you mad cuz they have more karma than you?

I always say this, Castle's barricades are meant to block lines of sight, not the attackers themselves. He doesn't need a buff.

Ok retard

Dann that's nice. Is that on the TTS?

I think Fuze is underrated.  His slow speed can screw you over sometimes, but he has an amazing primary weapon and a very strong gadget

I‚Äôll never use Smoke again. I could see this getting bad for him

As previous users posted, its to stomp on people who got just started /restarted the game.
---
 They do it because 
---
1) don't want to versus people of equal or greater skill
---
2) dont want to lose their rank because it proves they are worth something
---
3) want the satisfaction of easy kills with no challenge
---
4) think it is funny or proves their skill because someone effectively can't fight back.

It‚Äôs shocking to still see people saying this. It‚Äôs not how they use the term beta for this game. They clearly stated at the 2018 invitational that they keep using the beta tag because they are continually working on, adding and improving the game. The day they remove the beta tag is the day they are done adding new maps, reworking old ones and no more operators are being added so I hope it doesn‚Äôt get removed for years to come. Pretty simple stuff
---
What about that guy that doesn't push when your about to lose just to protect his K/D?
---
They are just jealous you have the uniform.
---
There is actually a way to exploit this with hatches next to a soft wall, but I've forgotten the exact method.
---
Basically you wind up putting the battery on the other side of the soft wall but electrifying the hatch, meaning you can catch people off guard if they rush to get the hatch or don't check the area.
---
Of course its' easier to just Kaid now.
---
ACOG attack, Red dot defence! I can dream of what could have been, one of the others in the squad got a recruit ace Round 2
---
Go crazy go stupid
---
You're really good with knife drawing, so I think you'd do awesome with cav!
---
The worst trade deal
---
Yea just downing hostage as cav
---
Lesion sounds like your defender, only gets more mines as the game goes on and his mines give you intel on the enemy when they push
---
How/Where can I get these?! That's absolutely fuckin awesome!! I'm assuming you made them yourself, so that's why I ask!
---
Well then you‚Äôll just have to be more careful with your bullets regardless
---
Of course we get the update i‚Äôve been begging for the day my internet goes out :/
---
So you can pretty much only tk once per match
---
I cant
---
sorry for getting a Side wrong...also if you look the makeup is 1 pixel out from the in game model
---
I think everyone agrees
---
But it‚Äôs always been that way
---
They can forgive after the first kill but if they don‚Äôt damage is done to you instead of teammates
---
Isn't this just ash but 2 speed
---
What is this bronze omegalul
---
So does this grant you another TK? Or does this allow you to get kicked for TKing someone again? I don‚Äôt see the purpose in ever forgiving anyone
---
I am sure there is not forgive system as I tk'ed my friend, he knew it was an accident
---
Thanks
---
Shotgun is good from breaching, still able to keep a ranged primary with it, and shotgun is semiautomatic .
---
If so I do not think it works, as I tk'ed my friend and he knew it was not intensional...
---
Sorry... I forgot about ash
---
This is absolutely hilarious
---
A quick scroll through the sub will see the same question asked &amp; answered about 3 dozen times.
---
Like everyone else Sledge and Ash, when I think of the game as a whole.
---
When I think of DLC ops I think of Ela and Mira.
---
oh my bad
---
Never seen it, developer?
---
Wirklich?
---
Mute. They have literally no reason to kick/TK me. Happened in 3 out of 5 matches too :(
---
Explain how it works please
---
Nah recoil is easy now dude.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought I was just curious if you could say assign the F1 key to pick sledge for you in-game
---
Kaid has throwables, Nomad shoots her gadget from her gun, and Mozxie has a slingshot, and they all have radius's.
---
Could be used as a forewarning for Mira on a twitch drone crossing that post from the roof drone hole. Boom. Practical.
---
people in my game thought it was a reverse friendly fire icon, but i‚Äôm not totally sure as there were no tk‚Äôs throughout the game
---
You made a good argument about using silencer as having better chance to kill an enemy, thank you for your time and effort. I really appreciate it :)

Hello throwhynot0, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bmbsmg/whats_this_icon/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Was it in casual or ranked?
---
They‚Äôve implemented a total damage method as well. If you do that you still get the reversal.
---
Okay, now this is epic.

Their dad is their cousin

It must be your personality.

He stripped your IP Address and is hacked into your Uplay account, where he can simultaneously say whatever he wants with your account while you say things.
---
The best option, and trust me on this, is to buy a new account because he now has access to your email, passwords and possibly card information.
---
It is reverse friendly fire
---
nani the fuck... how long away is that
---
I remember someone said he saw one prone. To this day no one has verified it.
---
Player TKs teammate at the end of a doomed defense round. Next attack that player picks Fuze, blows OBJ to kingdom come, and attackers freely plant in the middle of a rain of grenades without fear of dying.
---
There is supposed to be a forgive system on a teamkill, but not damage
---
Reset possibly I am from Xbox happened to me once the game thought I was still searching for a match and then you rejoin I think
---
I would get a One X but it‚Äôs a little expensive.
---
That‚Äôs where you are wrong kiddo.
---
no it's because you are a fuze main xd but shotguns are weird for me as well. I play dokkaebi and her shotgun sometimes misses entirely like knife range, but can be used like a sniper? Interesting.
---
I‚Äôm sorry
---
Have fun with it but be ready to lose a ton of games and be streaky. In low levels focus on playing like you do in gold, give callout and drone, and get ready for teammates to suck.
---
Now I want to play a jrpg-style version of Siege
---
Reverse friendly fire activated for that player
---
Capitao and smoke new team killing meta
---
use the search bar
---
reverse friendly fire i guess
---
I have no response to this, that is the sneakiest AI I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Didn‚Äôt tell me what to explain so here:
---
Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.
---
Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, lives near the equator.
---
The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[1] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.[which?]
---
I just asked in chat, it‚Äôs reverse friendly fire
---
It‚Äôs xbox
---
What if you could toggle an option on certain teammates so they can damage you without consequence?
---
Ok, cool
---
Yep.
---
Dude this look fucking sick
---
What do you mean?
---
Ye happened once, sucks cause not much you can do. Happened to me yesterday actually and annoying thing is I had aces that game and was hard carrying but there's nothing you can do, say just say good bye to whatever renown you earned that game
---
So healing teammates with Doc or picking up rook armor triggers reverse friendly fire.. +50 points for Doc and +5/10 for rook armor.. like REALLY?!
---
Glaz is the only one that can shoot through it
---
So you can still kill one player?
---
No one hates this
---
Like for ranked I have 0's all around. As if I never played ranked this season.
---
Your brother can say it wasnt intentional
---
oh ok thanks i guess i misunderstood this
---
Glaz is open to attack in that position
---
(not sure if this is still a thing) but about a month ago I went to gamestop to upgrade to the one X and they had fallout 76 bundles for $100 cheaper than a regular one X console because the game sold so bad.. got the bundle went home unwrapped the fallout game and took it back to trade in since they would‚Äôve known how i got it i couldn‚Äôt get a full refund, I live in a small town with one game store being gamestop so the employees know everyone who comes in and out. Don‚Äôt roast me reddit

Wouldn't twitch just shoot the alibi before being tagged?

Hello PapaBoomstick, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bmcq2h/thicc/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Someone wrote his name in the Death Note.
---
Wym
---
WOW
---
these posts are so obnoxious. you clearly shot around his head. did you even watch this before posting?
---
That room is called work office I thought?
---
B*tch please just remove the acog from the entire game /s
---
I guess that he was passing empty plates...
---
Mother Goose. One person gets Montagne and the rest are recruits with shield. You play follow the leader with Montagne in front. All recruits must be crouched and follow closely and cannot step out of line. If Montagne dies, the recruits scatter.
---
As a defender, it's fucking hilarious to stumble across this when roaming. Saw one where when Montagne went to a corner, the recruits hudled around him like little scared ducklings; their clanking shields just made me laugh so hard.
---
Also, Shotgun Sally. Its hard to Master, but I've seen it successful before. Basically, all defenders have shotguns. They stand in a circle facing outward and rotate, shotguns in hand. When there is sign of an enemy, all must shoot without stopping the circle.
---
And that's why you always gotta have a Doc around üòè
---
We would never see tower again
---
I love this. Coupled with the addition of an advanced option to let you stay on your drone at the end of the prep phrase as to protect it.
---
It is a thing
---
Underrated strat
---
What about Tachankas turret? If an enemy picks it up and shoots your teammates will the Tachanka be punished?
---
oh god oh fuck all seeing lesion
---
Yes, I clearly now understand.
---
So stupid, yet so smart. But also all it takes is one nitro
---
Bad aim?
---
It‚Äôs in the teamkill killcam. If you get tked and you watch the killcam of the teamkill and you think it‚Äôs unintentional there‚Äôs an option to forgive or not forgive
---
Where have you been for the past few years? Favela hasn't been a ranked map for quite some time now.
---

It‚Äôs not in ranked

Are you sure? I've had the map in my queue recently.

This is going to cause SOOOOOOOOO much trolling. Especially with the entire server knowing who has the debuff. I see this causing more harm than good. Siege is slowly becoming something other than it's initial vision. Chat ban filters, reverse friendly fire, all these operators with 1 touch global abilities. Legacy siege needs to be a thing.
---
my heart started racing when that breathing got heavy and you saw no one there, omg. i need to lay down.
---
I‚Äôm doing my best don‚Äôt judge me
---
What the hell was that Jackal doing though? ü§£ he got two kills and just yayeeted right in like he was ash or something
---
You've played Favela in ranked?
---
Wait he can break through reinforced walls?
---
Wtf
---
no u
---
The floor is really messed up, it should be fanned out from the back towards the front so the room appears square, You have it fanning out larger to the back which makes sure that the right side wall is attacking that wall unevenly. This makes the desks angle look out of place, the tables foreshortening doesn't match the carpet because it's match to the floors and not the walls, whereas the table matches the walls.

I don't know if you were looking for feedback, but... it's yours anyway.

No, I‚Äôm calling Zofia that from now on. I actually dislike Zofia as I tend to lose to her LMG often and that just made me laugh. Good on you friend

FINALLY They release the shemagh smoke headgear after, what? 2 years? I think it was teased in Velvet Shell
---
So basically it prevents them from using any jitsus?

Nicceeeee.

Maybe for rook you could have the icon come out of a duffel bag.

Fantastic
