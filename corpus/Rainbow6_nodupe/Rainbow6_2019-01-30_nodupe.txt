For the games I was in, it was mainly Blitz, Cav, Clash and Maverick. Lion was only banned once.

Tachanks. Recruit can use good guns (mp7, f2, r4c) whereas tachanks doesnt have good guns. Recruit can use good utility (c4, frags, flashes) whereas tachanks is stuck with deployable sheild and barbed wire.

Only on weekends leading up to the six invitational

Quality banter right here.

Oh ok thanks

He ranks down on purpose (ruining other peoples matches by conceding) to be in Copper 4, then dominates everyone and thinks he is such a cool dude for doing this, while in reality he is just ruining the coppers games for his virtual dicksize
---
No idea, never heard of it. I don't think everyone posts about it 20x a day on this sub. 
---
So since your point is nullified I'm copper? Alright. Enjoy being harstuck gold on console complaining about keyboarders you casual.
---
Dont quote me on that though thats what ive seen on this reddit on sunday.
---
That shouldn't be the point of cosmetic skins. It should be there for people to have fun with customizing their operators looks and why leave new players out of that? It's not important to the game itself. Maybe if they had some really high end gear that you actually had to earn like dark matter in call of duty then yea but there isn't except diamond. My point is that I think a lot of newer players would love to have some of the old stuff so why can't we? Just because we didn't play a few months ago? That's silly. Whether it be from buying or earning I think every player should be able to have access to them. If they re-released that jager pro skin would you not buy or try to unlock. Of course you would!
---
Yes 
---

---
I use eco but not as much as blitz 
---
Ban phases basically just turn games into ‚Äúno fun allowed: the video game.‚Äù
---
Hey guys this may be a stupid question, how do I get those things next to my name, the badge like things everyone else has.
---
IE: Fuze main
---
Monty extended should not be affected. You can aim your C4 over him and kill him. 
---
This would make C4's more viable with Blitz, who has time to fuck off before you get to detonate. 
---
The idea is good, but this will just split the playerbase up a lot and make queue times even more annoying. 
---
But as a zofia main lol. I do think vigils is badass though
---
Or in tracker-cancer teams: combined with any of Lion, Jackal, and Dokk.
---
Explain "Abuse", and I mean REALLY explain it. I'm pretty sure most of this "abuse" can apply to more than just Ash.
---
Oh fairs aha the good chibi is super nice 
---
lEts coNfuSe eVeRyOnE
---
C7E. Recoil &gt; dps
---
My friend saw me writing this and said ‚Äúwhat version is that‚Äù and I‚Äôm disappointed in him now.
---
I just replied to another comment with the same thought. I think only Blitz or an unextended Monty. Blitz is fast enough to get out of the C4 radius unless you catch him off guard. 
---
I bet you can't two shot this blitz's hand on a pixel angle.
---
Kaid: "Hold my beer..."
---
Good luck against a skilled monty then
---
Exactly. You can delay SO much as a roamed, but the attackers can literally make their way through each and every room on the map before focusing obj like you said. Then at best, it‚Äôs a 2v3 but more likely a 2v4 situation, unless they‚Äôre bad attackers or are just screwing around. 
---
Young squeakers??
---
Crabs are people - legit or quit
---
Dude I started in white noise and I have no idea what you are trying to do with his
---
that‚Äôs milosh. his twitter is @miloshthemedic and bro u don‚Äôt need to be so rude
---
One extra jump after destroyed and random ones prior to that.
---
To confuse everyone who started playing during/after parabellum.
---
Even if you load thru steam all your info is stored thru ubisoft. 
---
So to answer your question. You're fine. Ubi has your stats/progressions in the cloud or something. 
---
Yes but what does it mean
---
It was back in year 1 with ash, on Kanal. The game was 4-4 and my entire team pretty much got wiped with 1 guy dying to the old Insta spawn kill from control room window. I just said fuck it and ran up the stairs. I gunned down J√§ger as he climbed back inside from a run out and turned on Rook. I then ran into control and domed smoke. I placed a drone on my flank and smoked the objective and abused the name tags coming up if you looked at people through smoke lmao. Won the game 5-4. 
---
Dokk is also in the fill. 
---
Fully Cancer Meta: Lion, Finka, Dokk, Fill (3 speed, Jackal, Zofia, Bitz, certain others depending on situation), Alt. Fill (Fill, Thermite (if hard walls), or Thatcher (because trap meta)).
---
New UI went into effect during parabellum. People who started playing after that never saw this one
---
Ah right 
---
Did you look it up to see if anyone else had the same problem? (One time I got suspended for an hour and it didn‚Äôt even give me a reason for it ; - ;)
---
I like it. Better then nothing.
---
Which makes it a legitimate woosh
---
Lol
---
Ok I thought this was like Platinum I was about to say oh my god the IQ of this Tachanka is insanely high
---
I'm usually fine, just for whatever reason there's a bunch of angry middle school kids on today
---
Does it mean anything? I'm confused 
---
Thanks fod
---
There's no way that if you actively post in this subreddit, that you're any higher than gold. So unless you have some stats to show that you have any basis to call me a copper, stop replying to me and take it on the chin that you lack the intelligence to form a proper argument.
---
No you headass 
---
Oh god no, lol. I‚Äôm not nearly good enough to be even close to low Gold, let alone anything higher.
---
The lord always prevails in the face of evil.
---
No 
---
Nothing really. Ying has a special visor that stops her from get flashbanged by her own candellas. That's all it is.
---
Cuz fuze shield, Recruit shield and monty are such huge issues and are used in every match.
---
And are we really going back to C4s basically being a one hit kill for shields? That was removed because shields were seeing virtually zero play. 
---
Admit it, Blitz is the problem here. Not monty. Not Fuze. Not Recruit. Revert all changes to blitz to before people were upset with him. Make him 3/1 and unable to sprint with shield up. Shields are borked at 2/2. 
---
Eaebr
---
Lmao go back to your bean bag chair covered in cheeto puff dust jerking it to my little pony ya broke as phoney hey that rhymed. And hey man the only thing that could be any more dumb is your main. Alibi very open are you gay as well ? 
---
i do agree with you to some extent but those strats make people think harder to find counters, but yes i would like ban in ranked :)
---
Hey ubi, maybe fix ranked and just make it proleague rules before you continue with your randomized microtransaction bullshit. Greedy cunts, I know you gotta make money but randomized drops is a bullshit way to goad the weal willed into spending money on what essentially ammounts to nothing. 
---
No, the **SAFER** option is to team kill him in real life. He will respawn the next round.
---
That's just bad sportsmanship 
---
No respect for that 
---
^ This
---
Thanks for the help and support! üëçüèª
---
Well I mean if you keep playing surely you'll get there.
---
^This 
---
They have that because ying uses it for the flash things so she can see and jack to see foot prints 
---
from the matches iv played (which was like 30) monty was banned once
---
Yeah makes more sense now lol
---
Well then
---
Thanks lol. Hopefully. Been playing on and off since launch. Came back from about a half a year of not playing a few days ago. Last season I ranked in, I believe, was Red Crow or Chimera. Little rusty.
---
never seen a monty banned. 
---
doesn't really mean anything, just an indicator that its there,  and will engage when you throw here candalla's, which are flash grenades.  
---
Ranked is actually even more toxic? While I enjoyed testing out Pick and Ban since I don't play ranked - this event was the most toxic experience I've had in Siege.
---
Never before have I been teamkilled and vote kicked this frequently.
---
"gg ez" literally every match.
---
People calling out other's K/Ds before the match even starts. 
---
If Ranked is worse than this, which sadly, I don't doubt - I am never going back to that shitshow. 
---
Ubisoft really, really needs to hide K/D stats. At least in casual/events like this. 
---
I like the feeling of the C7E and it has great power but it‚Äôs hard to pass up the great recoil control of the AK12
---
The disrespect 
---
Outstanding move
---
Yea i played Black Ice through Skull rain stopped till blood orchid and have been hooked ever since
---
Let's take a scenario: you're on attack on Bank, 4v3, attacking Tellers. You get killed by a Jaeger playing in Open Area. You watch the kill cam and see he is roaming with another player in Open Area with no rotate to site. Now you can tell your teammates that info, that inherently changes how you attack the site. Now your teammates know they can push in through teller's desk with essentially only 1 person able to immediately contest them. That's key info you wouldn't get in the new playlist, they'd have to use time to drone Open Area to find that out.
---
Personally, I don't want people to get access to free information as a reward for dying. And I say that as someone with a terrible K/D.
---
What do I have ready: Dokkaebi, Finka, A hybrid of Blackbeard and Cav, the base 6 logo, kaid, glaz, Frost, Kapkan, maestro, maverick and valk.
---
What‚Äôs next: Jager, Bandit, Either Monty Or Blitz. 
---
What‚Äôs Next (probably): Finka/Dokkaebi
---
I spawnpeek pretty often, but this is one that I never do simply because it's a cheap, scummy move. They literally can't move a foot before their heads are being shot. This doesn't make you good, pal, it makes you skill-less.
---
*Drone sweats nervously*
---
Damn trying to figure out how it missed
---
Damn.  Hope u get it !! 
---
I'm a solid plat 1 on PC, I can tell by the micro adjustments and the movement. Also, somebody on my team was running MnK yesterday, Noticed it when he turned on an attacker in a split second.
---
No - had some bad experiences before playing Ranked - we just play casual MP now
---
You shot slightly above her 
---
Lestream is the old millennium roster  -Liven -renshiro +Uuno (former ence player) +Alphama (former supremacy player) Team Empire is a Russian team that recently moved up from challenger league. the core is the Room factory roster that played in the last invitational (I can't remember which players are from that old roster though)
---
Well ranked is way less toxic tbh

Well damn, came for the memes but that got real in a hurry ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I pick no ban if I think my team can do more with the whole roster than my opponents can.
---
Although this is Castle, in Pulses video he is outside?
---
Someone else will probably know more, but its likely some part of the word Piranha is a 'slur' in another language.
---
The anti toxicity shit in siege is literally just a database of bad words in a bunch of languages and it checks text messages against it. It doesn't even realise you are speaking in a different language and doesn't care.
---
Don't worry they don't check them manually anyway. Nothing will happen
---
Holy shit dude! Nice! All these toxic comments just aren't as good as you lol
---
The first clip in this is my favorite thing I have ever done in this game, I laugh every single time I see it.
---
Then he'll be like Blackbeard without a shield.
---
There is a list I  ubisoft's website that explains all the differences in detail. 
---
Already do
---
Maybe It was just a one time thing
---
What do you play on
---
Blitz in german to English translation is lighting so he has to be fast not no chunk boi
---
I enjoyed this
---
I was just joking
---
Ik. I take jokes seriously as a joke.
---
Rook the destroyer of buffets fatest agree
---
Ball of lard type of fat agree
---
Haha fair enough.   
---
Vigil is actually a top tier roamer, and while I have personal gripes against using Dokkabei, she‚Äôs a strong anti-roamer.
---
The matchmaking will easily pit golds against full diamond teams. It's so lenient that it might as well not exist.
---
I have
---
I know right
---
Wtf am I watching

---

---
*insert Jim Carrey photo
---
never let anyone tell you what operator to play, sure in pro league it might be usefull, but for the average player its just a hinderence, because you might not even be good with certain ops, or cant handle their weapon.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
if people wanna argue, just mute them, doesent matter if its ranked or not, or if they otherwhise give good callouts, negativity impacts YOUR gameplay, and you will do just fine without them.
---
and last but not least, have fun. its a game after all, try somthing new/stupid from time to time, and you will be amazed.
---
He had a opportunity to kill me at the very start though but just ran off
---
By that logic, then I‚Äôm sovietwoble but, worse
---
this is just...no. you forget that accidental teamkills happen and not being able to damage teammates or gadgets would be beneficial to the teamkiller. friendly fire is a vital part of this game and can‚Äôt be removed 
---
I lost mind at ashs underbite!
---
quit posting these. 
---
Taking another look at it, I think your right. Most likely just rainbow's hitboxes fucking up again.
---
Completely nothing lmao

They fixed Fuzes stance with the AK but there is still another glitch with Russian Acog where the bolt is lowered than the actual model.

---
If i had a $1 for every time I have said that, I‚Äôd be a rich man lol 
---
Rightly said.
---
People need to understand this before they suggest bolt action or semi auto dmr ops.
---
I'll find it and get back to you for sure.
---
Remember that most of that comes from people warming up for ranked or winding down from ranked. If it's the latter then they probably got their bootycakes stomped. It still isn't an excuse for the trash talking tho, hoping someone has an idea to make siege great again
---
No probs.
---
Shields are hardly an issue if you know how to communicate with a slightly competent teammate and setup a crossfire... if you can't you lost that encounter, big deal the whole thing is a game of rock paper scissors anyway.
---
Oh.
---
Makes sense.
---
Yeah but you'll still be placed, even in the casual thing with people around or nearish your rank/skill level most of the time.
---
So I was just trying to gauge roughly where you're getting placed to see if lower ranked players struggle more with acogs
---
Correct, but we use to get 4. Had Hibana, Blitz, Sledge, Buck etc.
---
Good point thereü§î
---
Sir this is reddit, common sense is not allowed.
---
Don‚Äôt worry man they‚Äôre gonna nerf Blackbeard into the ground and Cav too
---
Don't bother yourself. Ubi is already addressing it. They made a post.
---
it's not satire if you have to explicitly label it as such, you seem like the racist one
---
This . That's why I feel pick n ban is trash cause it's not helping you get better or learning the counters 
---
It sucks hard.
---
Discussion complete.
---
[removed]
---
I really hope that ubisoft does it the way League used to (still does?) and utilize it like "draft pick" was in league. Make ranked use the Road to SI ruleset as it is, then leave a casual Road to SI mode for warming up/memeing and other shenanigans. I just recently got back into playing ranked and trying to improve my game (high silver, low gold) and Road to SI was a great way for me and my squad to get into the groove! I feel like casual is too far set apart from ranked for that...
---
That type of stuff actually drove me off console to pc.. my team would always get sweaty and start shouting about how their deaths weren't justified or that someone was cheating, and at the end of the day it wouldve been a much better experience if they just owned it and gave the callout. Dont try to change those who wont listen, rather be the player that you want others to be and watch the dominoes go
---
Using names to balance is bad 
---
It has to be local custom games and you need to be on the team select page where you switch teams with space and start with s then disconnect you did it wrong and it cant be online for obvious reasons 
---
Looks like OP is about to get ~~have their k/o ratio dropped~~ 4 aces
---
think about it like a straight line. the operator is in the middle of the line and the ends of the line are the landing spot and the nomad charge
---
I enjoy seeing the fine work done by her local dentist you ungrateful sack of children‚Äôs toes
---
No ubi takes like a few weeks to patch a glitch by *** online that's 100% game breaking 
---
Don‚Äôt give them ideas, next Blackbeard will have a neon target on his shield.
---
Yeah i just had to get that off my chest because no one understands chilling on a deranked account and memeing hmu on uplay @ NV678 if you want to hang out
---
Bet, I'll add ya up when later tnight
---
You seem chill enough to hang with
---
Yeah it's a good book. Im thinking I should read the first book in the series Without Remorse. Apparently they address making some movies too.
---
Just saying his name is blitz not blubber
---
It was a headshot and also ps4 is harder to aim on
---
Ubisoft have said that they will eventually change it but it‚Äôs not a high priority
---
I love PlayStation rainbow 6
---
Basically either you missed your shots, or you didn't fire when you went over his head. Remember every gun has different fire rate that goes into it. Also everyone that commented are being mad cucks. Sorry but welcome to the siege community.
---
yeah this game has a shit community 
---
Headshot
---
Also its ps4 
---
I'm a Lion main and even agree with this. The real problem with Lion is people using him with perfect pushes with blitz and ash, hostage grabs, bomb plants, Dokkaebi calls and Jackal scans, but nobody does this. The only "good timing perfect scan" I use it on plant or hostage grab. I don't coordinate a push enough to scan and push or combo with Dokkaebi and Jackal. He's really not a problem except for Plat+ and Pro League.
---
üôÄ no words to say to you 
---
I was here to post that exact same thing. 
---
The mexican operator will be Jose, he can fix things like broken hatches or broken walls
---
Ayyyy as a hispanic. That joke was great

By the looks of it the clash wasn't meleeing her, rather, she was meleeing the air to taunt zofia

But only for me apparently.
---
I hate this map and then rage quit
---
Wow, those are really, really low. Mine's often at 80+.
---
Anyway, I just sorted that problem yesterday, so here's a list of things you can do:
---
1- get your fans cleaned.
---
2- get your heat sink glue reapplied.
---
3- task manager- details- rainbow6- priority- low. (Legit works, with stutters as well)
---
4- if you are suffering mouse stutters, put polling rate at 250.
---
5- nvidia GPU can often just switch off for a split second. It's a Microsoft problem. Go to Nvidia control panel and keep settings at high, and keep the spinning Nvidia logo screen on in the background, minimised to taskbar. This keeps gpu awake.
---
6- right click desktop- Intel panel- Intel power options- experiment with balanced or max performance mode
---
7- Vsync- 1 frame; for some reason, it worked.
---
8- i downgraded to driver 399 something. Much more stable. Now-&gt; Nvidia profile inspector- cap fps. This is said to help stutter issues. Especially useful if you have stutters and your system is capable of running at much above your monitor refresh rate. Do this first, then go enable FastSync in control panel. If not, then put vsync on in-game.
---
9- Nvidia profile inspector and control panel- triple buffering on.
---
10- graphics high. Use as much GPU as possible. If you use 100% GPU, or you are using most if whatever is used, then you aren't bottlenecking, which is good. I put high and TAA off. With vsync on now I get constant 60.
---
11- I reinstalled drivers, so fast sync was switched off. With all uncapped, it gave me 100 fps, but kept stuttering. Vsync fixed, but vsync is said to have higher latency than off, so I'll be trying FastSync+ fps cap to 80 soon. Point 8 is FastSync. It is said to have lower latency than vsync on.
---
If I remember anything else, I'll put it. I'm doing a 3 hour gaming stint on Saturday to test it. If it's all fine, I'll make a guide post on how to get rid of stutters.
---
Meanwhile, I took quite a few solutions from this: https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1583576-Post-about-mouse-lag-stutter-and-100-fix!-Forums

So randomly shooting at a door = good aim? you're using the term delusional a bit too liberally. Also no i'm not going to look at your other clips man

Not random just decent map knowledge my guy hence why I didn‚Äôt spray through the door. There‚Äôs typically only 1 spot people go and hold an angle in garage.
---
Why is the title "you bad if say mouse keyboard on console unfair" if you're bragging about map knowledge?
---
Spawning and then failing to shoot back at an obvious and common spawn peek and also not getting out of his line of fire
---
Honestly I just replied that because it would be funny. But honestly idk what you expect, once you get to copper 4 it‚Äôs too late. The community is shit and that‚Äôs the bottom where the most toxic players reside. Your only option is to find other people to play with. Play casual and learn the maps, so that next season you don‚Äôt get stuck there. I solo queue almost exclusively and I‚Äôm still stuck in silver-gold most of the season. 
---
Not you
---
Pulse Putin out the hate

that guy did though he aced and won the round good for him
---
very nice man
---
Client side rendering strikes again!
---
It's been super bad for me lately.
---
Happy cakeday 
---
Because why waste your time and energy complaining about something that can‚Äôt be fixed and instead go and worry about yourself and how you can improve as a player.
---
My buddy thought this was reddit worthy,  you'll hear him at the end. 
---
Those 360s are so damn fun when you pull it off, gotta go slow though
---
But it's not relevant to the video
---
Yes good for him he got a 4K against people who had about 3 seconds to react.
---
Damn, I don't get that sort of extremity but the main thing that happens with me us when I melee a barricade and the wood just stays there! I can't count the amount of times that has happened!
---
I like this but it shouldn‚Äôt be able to knock down montagne if he has the full shield down. 
---
I just thought, is this Castro or Maestro?
---
Guess it's the latter.
---
I love how they came at you one at a time action movie style.
---
This is what literally the community have been saying since the alibi comes out. I think the devs knows about this but it's not on their top priority list. Let's hope eventually Alibi get's a buff and I'm pretty sure this is what they would change. Fingers crossed
---
Year 1 meme over here
---
lol
---
I've had a few people phase straight through barricades in the past few days because client side they were still intact, but server-side they were destroyed
---
Echo, Buck, Frost, personally I'd prefer Buck. 
---
This is really well done m8, I'd buy a print of it.

Outbreak mode was almost 1 year ago, let that sink in...

It‚Äôs relevant to the entire subreddit lmao. Check the last 10 posts and at least one is going to be about what I listed. I ain‚Äôt sitting on reddit arguing with you though son.
---
You didn't even hug the pillar, if they had been waiting for this you would have been an easy kill. Nutty plays my man.

well it got him the v royale!!!!!! if his opponents weren't brass 1 shitters they would do it to him next round!!!

It‚Äôs fairly lightweight as far as the material goes (not be confused with cheap) but the sewing and the zippers are of great quality. Totally loving the design.

It fits spectacular. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and bought the Large. Just like the pictures, it‚Äôs got that athletic slim build fitting to it. It looks good! 
---
"V royale?" Do you really think any win in any game is called a "v royale"?
---
Wow, honestly why haven't Ubi fixed that shit yet?
---
Can you try Amazon.com (US Amazon) to see if they will ship intl?

playstation siege is the worst circle of hell for sure, i'm sorry fam.

Even better, she could scan different uniforms and attach each scan with a different prisma device to create more confusion. Or even scan other operators.

If you do that just remember, the fun you are having by destroying way worse players is the fun you are taking away from them. Ty

Wow

I love Siege but I always crumble in ranked so I‚Äôve been ranked in the Coppers a number of times. I could never see myself stooping this low for kills though. 
---
It called Ubisoft ...
---
nope. mine is definitely some kind of frame stutter. sorry, hope your issue gets fixed too
---
Wut? üòÇ
---
I would take that excuse if its from a indie developer studio or something. But focking ubisoft, who makes tons of money with this game? That cant be an excuse...
---
They might do it but I feel it'll just take waaaay to much time until they do make it a full mode.
---
Anyone
---
In the alpha pack should not be duplicate because the packages were born to reward people based on how much they play and when you have a bit of skin opening alpha packs is more frustrating than rewarding 
---
It‚Äôs called sportsmanship and the people that do this have none of it. 
---
This is a game after all and is intended to be fun and enjoyable. Being killed by a spawn killer is neither of those things. 
---
Also, how dull and uninteresting must your life be if you‚Äôre idea of entertainment is cheesing a game. Sure it‚Äôs quick and easy XP but did you really pay for a game that you don‚Äôt even intend to actually play?
---
I diagnose you with dead. 
---
Do you have you‚Äôre language as lil pump 
---
If you use the same uplay account that you used on PS4 when you buy the game on PC you can get some of the skins you had from the Ubisoft Club. I got the fire, elephant, Guerrilla and Ghost recon skins from PS4 on PC. 
---
Now this is the bomb

Absolute cancer

That is the only thing that I dislike about alibi i hate being limited to the default outfit because of the prismas

do one of Vigil, but through the view of an attacker drone.

I don't know why Echo players do that sometimes. The Yokais should really do all the work.

Maybe they should react faster instead of being shit at the game! Xx

I'm new to Siege, been playing for two weeks. In those two weeks I've been baffled how friendly fire has been a thing for 4 years. I've never seen it enhance my experience, or balance it or whatever, all I've seen it do is create toxicity. So why has it stuck around? 
---
Well its the same problem causing defenders to think he isnt looking at them so fix any of em and they fix them all.
---
It was in the last patch notes and nothing changed. Just more and more bugs.
---
That's an interesting video.
---
As there is no details on the size of the charges used when they stand next to it I'm still not sure. Of course it does deflect projectiles created by the explosion.
---
This study is quite interesting, you might enjoy it.

You can hear both the Geiger counter sound of the C4 and Pulse's scanner is quite loud. I'd say using your ears if you know they have a Pulse is a decent counter.

It's weird. They put it in the game but in intervals.

It should be back in a day or so. 
---
tl;dr Too much roam/flank area on Tower and too little roam/flank area on Kanal
---
This was literally patched 10 times by now. But instead of displaying a message to the user why wouldn't Ubi just requeue the user into another game anyways...
---
Depends on what version you get, no ops (or like 3 of them on each side) is like $15 and it keeps climbing depending on how many ops you want at first, but I highly recommend not getting the $15 version because it‚Äôs such a pain in the ass to get all the ops that you‚Äôre gonna end up buying them and spending more.
---
Awesome! I'll give it a go.
---
I was asking the platform so if you're console I could've given you tips about MnKers or just rushers in general 
---
But as you're on PC , you're in fair ground 
---
Rushers rely on gun skill most of the time , rarely do they drone (unless there's a Caveira) and rarely do they stick to their team , they just "Go for it" ignoring the risk , your best bet is Lesion or kapkan , roamers obviously will help with Intel but when time comes for facing them always try to be unpredictable and be smart , they play insanely aggressively they won't stop , in tactical games it's punishable to be aggressive all the time , their playstyle is their weakness .
---
Ever time a tactic works , shuffle come up with another that doesn't involve the same strategy , outsmart them and you'll win , they are intimidating but they can't fight well organized strategies bad succeed .
---
It'll take time but trust me it works , the most important thing here is that don't let the idea scare you , have a strong will !
---

---
DO NOT GET STARTER 
---
Oh boi
---
Starter is the biggest ripoff as it actually is harder to get everything else and takes way longer like dozens if not more hours than just the regualr version. 
---
Literally buy any other version than Starter.
---
In lions case id say when you scan you here him say some of the lines like big brother incoming and stuff like that trying to protect the ones around him because after how he had messed up with claire and his parents he did not anyone if I get hurt anymore so heblets his team know what to lookout for

I ended up in Gold 4. Goody. You still wanna team? Lmao

I'll be honest I had a really good time during my placements. I mean shit my first match I got 13 kills (so did the best player on the other team) and just marginally won.

Not only that, I even got a "gg" message from that guy!

I have a headshot % higher than 50% in any fps game,so I only need a pistol with a silencer

Make the new discovery playlist mode (road to six invitational) ranked, make ranked casual, and add some dumb mode for if your bored, and please for the love of God add a map maker for PC, then you could port the best ones to cosole, like aim training and good maps

I would be fine with this. hopefully the real thing is something similar  when the roadmap becomes officially revealed

After the mp5 nerf this is gonna get a lot more common

will be back soon^^TM

7 R4 Cs duck taped to the front

Hit 6 in a row the other day, then finally get into a game and it was last round and i didnt get to play

and hes a 3 armor so its definitely valid
---
I wish there was a ranked varient of it or give it is own mmr. Because the mode breathed new life into the game for me. However it was very frustating playing cause of my teammates. I understand its an entry for newer players into something close to comp settings. I know they dont know the comp meta. But if there was a mode geared to it, i would be thrilled. However, i would just be happy to play it as is. Ive barely played siege since they took it out cause i just want to play si.

Cmon man, that was the prefect time to say "Dayum roight, fockin laser soights"

Can you do the new invitational Ash? It would be so cool.

Or just have them get auto-sniped by an NPC Glaz if they leave the building at all.

Seem accurate on the ubi servers ü§î
---
This so much. Ranked is much better experience. Less griefing, team killing, afkers, quitters.
---
No, PC players simply have too high of an advantage with their aim

or the attackers could use their guns too.
---
Thats the Situation Articel 5.
---
Instead of putting the People who play it together they just throw 4 People to the Person who started it.

Ubi's explenation: they dont want long wait times for People who play this Situation because there not enough People who play it.

Meanwhile in Reality: Player trys to play T-Hunt Bomb. Gets thrown into Articel5 from different People, 37 times in a row.

I would prefer 2 reworks and 2 new maps, or maybe (unpopular opinion?) even 3 reworks and only 1 new map.
---
You know why banning Rook is dumb? Because there's an operator with similar loadout and utility. There's a reason why Doc has such a high pick-rate in PL, yet the OP never is banned.

will the caveira mag nerf also affect capitao? just curious

PC has more recoil, but it is easier to control with mouse.

It's even in pro league
---
Its the MVP (most valuable PLAYER), not the most valuable operator. And it is in no way connected to the kills, but most times the MVP is the top fragger as well.
---
It‚Äôs in casual as well, why would you ever spawn peek in casual lol 
---
&gt;Misleading Title
---
inb4 a new hack comes out where blitz becomes a predator missile in prep phase.
---
Exactly. Seems like the bans I've been seeing are based on not wanting to have to deal with them, regardless of how infrequently they are picked. Same with Lion. I don't care for his gadget, but his .308 is fantastic.
---
This totally wasn't posted like a week ago
---
haha you're not wrong.
---
And the content is still in your game files sitting idle 
---
Welcome to the club
---
Maybe actually fix shield ops before implementing this? I mean shield ops are broken because you can always get an angle on them if they are looking straight at you. Fix this. Also you can shoot through shields. Fix this as well. 
---
It‚Äôs a good idea but Ubisoft enjoys making money so this would never happen
---
If you showed me this picture before Outbreak and told me it was Siege, I wouldn't believe you
---
Ranked is ridiculous, period. As somebody who just plays ESL and other real competition, I probably won't play Ranked again until, or unless Road to SI ends up in Ranked.
---
It feels kinda insane I play really well in scrims, yet I'm stuck in Gold...
---
I fucking hope your right about that kanal rework 
---
Yeah, but knives wont register half the time because goopysoft.
---
:O
---
What? lol  
---
What's wrong with it?
---
Road to SI got me hooked on the game again but it's back to dealing dark shitty maps and cancer meta.
---
I know what you mean it's very rare that I get banned for it but it still pisses me off because it was a rankup game.
---
Really pathetic, it's incredibly annoying!
---
But imagine drawing Recruit Man, leader of the justice buddys.
---
At least you can get black ice. I've been playing since before alpha packs, and still have not opened a single black ice
---
Not really, sweden stood neutral during the WW2 aswell. Dunno how it is now, but I think they also stoof neutral in the Cold War.
---
Get the diamond skin to flex on people. Easily the best use of 100,000 renown
---
OP's proposed idea would actually fix this problem that was in Road to S.I, the game mode itself is not imbalanced at all and there's a reason it's what they use in pro league.
---
Xbox? This happened to me and my friend awhile back when house was still in rotation.
---
ubisoft being ubisoft 
---
How long ago? This was about two or three months ago maybe longer idk. It was on Xbox actually. 
---
There is a LOT of information missing here.  Did you mean players instead of player?  What region, what days, why would anyone want to sign up to play with you, who are you?  
---
There is an official discord to find people to play with already.
---
If by "team" you mean an ESL team then I think you should work on nailing down how to even request things before moving on to something like that.
---
Yeah, I think Favela needs more a Map Buff than a full Rework, Just change some things here and there and It can be a great map.
---
It is, but it's also Ubisoft.
---
*no u lol
---
1 second not long enough and 3 seconds is too long 
---
He‚Äôs on bank, any of the front lobby areas and half of the long hallways on the maps 
---
I thought that time when defenders get detected outside could change.
---
Oh I agree it's probably good for ranked, just not casual as that kinda runs the point of casual
---
Geez, late 2017ish. It was right before house was removed. 
---
Can this be a recruit skin
---
damn this guy controls time 
---
I think they have discussed the fact that he's so broken they can't actually fix him so they plan on leaving him as he is permanently.  Where did you see that they are working on a fix?
---
Currently Glaz and Castle are getting fixes.
---
If you deny advices you are inevitably going down.
---
Level 1000 yokai. 
---
Like he's useless rn? His gadget does not hold up well in the siege game. 
---
I always get common items, I‚Äôd be happy just to get one damn legendary item from it for once...
---
Shoot maybe it was me then. I don‚Äôt Remember when. If it is you sorry. I appreciate the tea bagging.
---
NO WAYYYY
---
Oooo Killem üòÇ Git guud kid
---
I hope not. Ubisoft should focus more on fixing the game instead of bringing new broken content into the game... This game get more and more broken every year.
---
Did you forget to switch accounts
---
LeanFoo you artistic genius! You never cease to amaze me with these!
---
Riding off the parent comment here to clear up some misconceptions in the thread:
---
- The recruit is shooting a [clay pigeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_clays) off Rook's chest. It's a target, but mostly a ["look he really DID shoot something out of the gun, it's not a trick!"](https://youtu.be/TJecVFaLGq0) indicator.
---
- The pigeon is not even an inconvenience to the bullet. They will break if you look at them funny. They're supposed to be easy to break.
---
- Level IIIa (which is lesser than level III) kevlar body armor will stop all pistol threats, including 44 magnum. (This is what my headcanon says operators with 2 armor have, while 1 armor ops don't have any armor.)
---
- Level III body armor will stop basic rifle threats like 5.56/5.45/7.62 FMJ. (This is what my headcanon says operators with 3 armor have.)
---
- Level IV plates, likely what Rook passes around, will stop AP 7.62x51. The plates are probably ceramic, [something like this](https://www.ar500armor.com/ar500-armorr-level-iv-body-armor-10-x-12.html).
---
Nice attempt
---
We are big boys
---
I thought of this song before I even turned the audio on
---
Stolen from Instagram I‚Äôm pretty sure 
---
Agreed
---
I agree about ranked, but I don‚Äôt know how I feel about picking spawns in casual.  Personally I‚Äôd love it if the game still randomly chose a site, but if they told defenders during the pick phase so we knew who to bring.  I‚Äôd love it if pick and ban was brought to ranked and casual.
---
Pretty much how I feel yeah. Shit maps, shitter meta. I'm just wishing the Lion rework does its job and bans come to ranked so I can ban the fuck out of Blitz and Dok.
---
Mute 
---
Yeah. I would play casual lots more if i could select bomb sites. It is so stupid to pick defender when you have no idea what you are defending.
---
That is why she is broken
---
Keep in mind, this is casual. You don‚Äôt know what your spawn is in casual. Even if you decided to drone out a spawn yourself you could still just guess wrong and get spawnkilled anyways because bank is a broken map.
---
I miss the old Hereford
---
Techniques?  You mean abusable mechanics?
---
she's... alright. can be pretty decent in locking down flanks and roams. her fragging is kinda meh. she has potential though, but it's hard to say if she will be used in PL
---
Haha. I was the cav if its you. My friend justin loves to revive my downs. Usually they tea-bag and run off without killing him. We don't play much and its been awhile since he even tried it. I do remember a time on house where he got killed, our group was dying laughing... He felt so betrayed.
---
Truly German engineering is the best in the world.
---
Yeah ur right I will repost with all the info 
---
Just play it, man! There is no reason not to play.
---
It's fairly obvious when someone is cheating without kill cams anyways. Besides, with Ubisoft's current detection method it matters little if you know someone is cheating through killcams anyway. They're also not completely accurate. 
---
Kills are good In ranked. But how's your map knowledge? Plus do you know call outs? 
---
Have you not seen the Ubisoft designer notes with the defenders' graph that shows their pick rate and win delta? These "safe" operators are the strongest right now, so I don't have anything against playing as them, especially if it increases my chances of winning.
---
Incredible! 
---
Yaaaaaas 
---
Personally I disagree with that last point. I understand players like to be rewarded, but playing something for the reward is hardly fun. Games are their best when you‚Äôre playing because you want to be playing and and if you get rewarded for that, I view that as extra. 
---
Here's a crazy theory
---
since Ubi Is adding Operators from countries that we already have maybe after Germany they start Implementing more Operators from Year 1
---
1. Chimera - France and Russia
---
2. Grim Sky - United States and United Kingdom
---
3. ??? - Germany and Canada
---
4. ??? - Brazil and Japan
---
I excluded Dust Line Season because they are from the US and we already have 7 Operators from that Country
---
You have already received the answer to your question multiple times. The fact is that you would rather cover your ears and go la la la and pretend that you're right. This is *broken gameplay*. I don't know if you're just a toxic individual, or you really believe that being able to get into an engagement within 1 second of you spawning in makes for a healthy game. Either way, it shows how much of an idiot you are if you truly believe that that is the way it should work.
---
Glad can, in very dire circumstances, make a vaultable hole in a soft wall.  Also Dokkabei doesn‚Äôt have breaching capability.
---
Easy solution here; only make it render her uniform, and not the gun skin; gun stays default, and the op skin changes. ¬Ø¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø¬Ø

---
Sweated for diamond from y1s2 to y2s3, then some friends stopped playing so me and my brother sit usually in plat 2. 
---
AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Decent map knowledge, below average on call outs, however I‚Äôm usually good at explaining what I see or where I died/ enemies location.

Yea exactly cheaters won‚Äôt be in the lower ranks. I play console. I‚Äôve come across cheaters. It‚Äôs definitely not 0%. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it so much since they‚Äôre separate divisions and FBI was an original division while Navy Seals was S2.  I‚Äôd say I can‚Äôt imagine them adding a Canadian op before adding a german and FBI but Then again I don‚Äôt think there is linear thinking rather then just creating new ops

You have to restart the game
---
I think kill cams should not be shown till the end of the round. Or just saved to view later. They are too big of a disadvantage to be seen during play
---
That or house and you're playing vertical.

Kinda, but not like in the real game. You can fold it to make it so you can crouch behind it.
---
I‚Äôve found that on certain challenges (birthday charm challenges, for example) you may need to restart your game for the rewards to register on your account. I‚Äôve not noticed if this is the case with renown and XP challenges, but I would recommend making a note of what your renown is before and after collecting a reward, then noting what your renown is after you restart your game. If it didn‚Äôt increase after the restart, then you‚Äôre definitely getting missing out on your earned renown.

You can probably contact UBI about it and see what comes of it.
---
I just don't understand how she's considered balanced. 
---
&gt;High rof/dps R4C with 31 rounds to chew through and minimal recoil. Mix that with a 3 speed, peekers advantage and ACOG gives you a very high pick rate and an above average win rate.

Ohhh wait you mean when the client goes silent? And can‚Äôt hear your gunshots or equipment 
---
I guess I'll just clarify what I mean by toxic asshole. Lean/crouch spamming and running out and instakilling as the attackers spawn is usually toxic for me and sucks the fun out of the game. I want to play because I enjoy a good firefight, not to get killed by some asshat that's abusing the game's movement system or another vegetable running out and killing me before I even have a chance to react
---
Not saying it‚Äôs not suspicious but your playing diamonds they are gonna have good aim 
---
Do you know where Morocco is?   
---
Also Australian ops have been leaked pretty heavily.
---
Oh huh okay, I would expect you would see hackers if you're on PC, you did mention console though, and it does matter which platform because on PC there are loads of hackers, but not any that I know of on console since it's pretty hard to hack through Microsoft's/Sony's defences before hacking the game itself.

Somebody on your team or the enemy team most likely then joined in late

Kills don‚Äôt mean anything  if you don‚Äôt know the maps and understand call outs. It was my biggest mistake when going into ranked

Most uncounterable? One drone in that doorway and a few bullets fired between the pillars and echos off the board

because you are mentally ill i will give you 1 more answer:

i compared your shitty statement with something else to show you how stupid is your point and now you are trying to hide how wrong you are by pretending to be 60IQ idiot unless you are not pretending but hey i don't judge i'm a nice person.
---
You should be alright then. It will be easier to play with people you know. But can always try solo if you want. Good luck any way 
---
That‚Äôs been a glitch for months now.  Is that not what op was referring to?
---
I hear it going off on PS4 but I feel that I should be able to hear it better when it‚Äôs being placed.

Sweet pull, and it's all good man I'm a copper 2
---
Okay sound good. Make ranked random also and remove all other operators. Make R6 fun again. I cant understand how you dont see how stupid that is. 
---
Lol same cosmetics as me

I put the UK skin on the L85A2 and the P226 so I can go üÖ±ritish mode

It‚Äôs been a glitch for years you just gotta remember to reset the client every time you get off the game... plus like when you lose your operators it‚Äôs the same thing 
---
Actually the community (and pro league) has been wishing for a J√§ger like operator for a while now.  Someone else to counter throwables, so I could definitely see this idea getting used in higher ranks and pro league!

&gt;youtubers agree that chanky is terrible
---
&gt;pro players see him as terrible
---
&gt;even devs themselves stated that they NEED to rework him because he is terrible.
---
But hey man. No facts. Just PURE OPINION.
---
I agree
---
I really dont think we need more game modes when it takes 30 minutes to queue into terrorist hunt. Cool ideas but the game lacks the playerbase to support them.
---
I don‚Äôt think he is a bad operator 
---
He need buff, but not rework, i really like that operator and i play him so much, rank gold 
---
Damn son, I couldn't even tell that was homemade.  nice job.
---
I picked up siege around this time and I honestly wish I started earlier because I honestly feel like this was the best season this year with the best loot. As a new character I thought this was what siege was like and I thought it was the coolest  thing ever

Ew, no.

I only get tk for no reason.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate it!
---
No
---
Because it‚Äôs funny 
---
No way we get 3 new maps should be 1 map and 1 rework and 2 map buffs every season. It's a lot to learn either way but there are maps that's have been around for a while that need love before we start adding more maps. 
---
Thank you I was looking through here for the 4th you should probably add this as a regular comment.
---
Not yet

I am using a custom rainmeter overlay to visualize both audio channels. The recording of CS:GO is a little bit bugged, but thats because shadowplay didnt really want to capture both together. I would not say that you can use this as a hack / cheat, it doesnt help much. RGB because why not.
---
Sooo much cooler
---
Well first off, this whole post was about Recruits, not Tachanka. And yes, as common as the opinion may be, those are still examples of opinions lol I even agree with it. It's hard to play Tachanka well, but I have friends that do well with him. I don't understand why you even care.
---
so much faster :D
---
I'm surprised battle eye allows an overlay
---
Why not chief?
---
Yes! That's awesome.
---
Right. :D
---
&gt; then I am not sure why you're even concerned about its duration. Any time spent on a meaningless activity is wasted time.
---
Because a casual game mode shouldn't be anything more than a 15-20 minute commitment. I play casual while waiting around for friends to get online so that we can play ranked together, when we actually have the people and time to commit to a 45-minute long game
---
Clash
---
Good example of how broken this game is besides her being a troll
---
mate i was literally talking about outdated memes and you started going on with the whole "but noo tachanka isnt useless" meme sht 
---
What if it was ranked but first to 4 wins
---
I just think it's fine the way it is now, that's all.
---
Its cause they cropped out the fact this is a custom game and was set up. 
---

Devs, please change the sound system. A breach charge to the left should be played 80% on the left speaker / headphone. It is just ridiculus like this.
---
Facts
---
Competive Casual? what is this, 2100?
---
Well yes and no 
---
They should do 2 gamemodes for both regular gameplay and road to si because some people are gonna get pissed if they are stuck only playing bomb
---
The vote kicking really sucks, last season I got kicked from the majority of casual games because my ranked stats didn't update after my first 3 placement matches where my k/d was 0.4 and win/loss was 3.0 because I got carried in solo queue for only those matches.
---
It sucks seeing all the new players being kicked because of their level and for not knowing callouts in CASUAL.
---
Yeepppp. I love being rushed from a blitz having no idea because he made no sound what so ever. 
---
Pleaze do not approach ze helicopter.
---
Sure
---
Lion's gadget has no affect on Tachanka's turret. lol But seriously Lion is hard to play against. I love all these assumptions about me because I like Recruit. lol
---
Always use acog in every weapon you can
---
Attackers:Twitch, Finka, Thatcher,Fuze,Sledge
---
Defenders:Tachanka,Kapkan, Ela,Caveira,Rook 
---
Negative time XD
---
I'm not a fan of current casual. Random sites, too long of rounds, can't pick spawn, and can't work on strategy since your site is random. Doesn't help new players get ready for ranked play and is not that fun.
---
And the Swiss stayed neutral and horded all the Nazi's stolen treasures for them.
---
Then it wouldn‚Äôt be an elite in any sense
---
now that i think about it, blitz is just wishful thinking xD
---
I get it, I just don't hate it that much.
---
As a Thatcher main, I personally think that helment isn‚Äôt the one.
---
Play casual with your friends because you will get kicked for being a low level player
---
+
---
You seriously mentioned him first lol Wtf is wrong with you, go get a life, you're not in Pro League 
---
ubisoft made a great game=fanbase ruined it=gubisoft starts doing wack stuff=fan base upset
---
I hope there will be no rework, i love Tachanka and his ability 
---
What
---
The Mexican Marines are so bad ass. They're probably the only branch not corrupt in the entire Mexican government
---
Ha! You just took a screenshot of recruit from the game and posted it
---
that's actually a really good idea
---
the randomness of the sites is the only thing that makes house playable. If given the choice Everyone would just pick basement as many times as they could and run a team stacked to defend basement making life hell for attackers. Which would be no fun at all.
---
Unless you are going to drop like half the casual map pool (which....no, dont) then letting teams pick or even know their sites would make it horribly unbalanced and unfun.
---
If you liked doesnt mean othet people like it and cut your low key insults
---
Actually my friend,  this is gold one ranked gameplay,  and as of tonight I just reached platinum.  
---
Yeah I see that all the time and either they don't know how FoV changes affect sensitivity or they have simply just gotten used to it.  Part of the blame is on Ubisoft though, their handling of sensitivity in terms of how its calculated and modified is convoluted as fuck with hidden optic multipliers and having everything be normalized to XFactor's preferred 0.6 ADS sens, a guy who played the game for a day for youtube content.  
---
Literally just get point compensation that brings you up to similar to the rest of your team at the time of joining, that's all that needs to be done.
---
Turkish operators... Maybe someday?
---
i can use this...
---
Sounds silly but same? Like ever since the invitation event started I've been getting frame chug and idk why. Been searching far and wide and have all my setting near-zero with my 760gt still unhappy.
---
Hostage has been rescued before the match starts lmao
---
The reason why it wasn‚Äôt a headshot. Simple, it was ping. Clearly you don‚Äôt know anything about how servers operate 
---
There are simply not enough words to express how shitty casual R6S is, it's not even R6S...it's the modern gaming equivalent of Superman 64, it is so so so so so so so so so so so (1000x so later) bad and unfun.
---
This video was uploaded to www.xvideos.com

Should be around 50. You can order a custom patch + attach it to a cheaper jacket yourself &amp; still save money for an Elite set ingame.
---
That‚Äôs happened to me before was bout to get plat iv
---
Switzerland = r/enlightenedcebtrism 
---
If u only look at r6 versions of the memes then ofc it isn't clever. 
---
Now ubi should look at the figures of the ban rates for this mode and see that the public don't like playing against ops like lion/blitz etc. 
---
you didnt get a headshot dumass you got close but ur reaction times shit
---
well it says at the top right hand corner that ur video drivers are out of date and it seems like network problem
---
Thank you. Why do people insist that the 2 different modes have to be so different. Id like casual better if it just gave players more control of the game. 
---
I think it should only let you pick from 2 random sites each defense on casual (even if that site has been won or not.) that way it'll still create a bit of uniqueness when it comes to which sites are being played still.
---
It‚Äôs the logo for the CBRN ctu. Was it during the first season that cavs pro league came out?
---
when we gonna get those Israeli ops tho  
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
well duh it released during outbreak
---
I love you no homo
---
Your new operator? Can‚Äôt you see he‚Äôs OP?!
---
You are a bold one
---
Update your drivers, dude. 
---
lol mad cuz bad 
---
yep, happy cake day but its true ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
It‚Äôs also not about if they CAN get a mic. Some people just don‚Äôt want to talk to others, my guy. It shouldn‚Äôt be an oppression of ‚ÄòYOU NEED MIC OR YOU NO PLAY‚Äô like cmon man let people enjoy the game. Maybe they‚Äôre in discord with their friends they‚Äôre playing other games. If you were better at the game and had a UHD surround sound headset, you wouldn‚Äôt need communication. So take your money that you obviously have and buy one and a perfect MnK and get good. 
---
I only use the vote kick when someone is being a cunt and/or annoying, other than that /shrug
---
I also dont run into TKing too much, it does happen but not often. 
---
The really toxic thing I see a lot is people smurfing and then lording it over the other team that they're oh so good at the game despite clearly playing waaaaay below their skill bracket mainly I assume because they're dickweeds who cant stand not winning every match with ease.
---
You don't need 4 mins to experiment with new tactics lol. 
---
Thought it was supposed to be a ban hammer
---
buthe cliii izzsssz twemy twmo secondsssshdusishsnsjdjxjxhdushsbs
---
read the sub rules 
---
Do you mean so you have a chance to be like top of the team? I mean that would be nice like the averages of all the other players points or something? I personally don't really mind when I join and am at zero points and I don't think that is why most people leave on going matches either I think it is because they want a fresh match
---
I like it man. Looks pretty damn cool
---
Did he try getting on the ladder?
---
Just hit install on steam and it will show a box that says ‚Äúdiscovering local game files‚Äù and give it a few mins
---
Holy fuck
---
One of my favorite games ever!
---
It's amazing
---
Tachanka, mainly because he‚Äôs never played right in my opinion 
---
Ash‚Äôs hitbox is an excuse for bad players. It used to be an issue maybe 4-5 seasons ago but was fixed. It has been debunked on YouTube many times, and if you don‚Äôt have any clips then you‚Äôre just bad.
---
Oh, I've never heard of it so yeah.
---
Exactly
---
Not yet.
---
But it just means you can't blame it on the lag, you win some you lose some.
---
Blitz: *other side of map
---
Blitz‚Äôs shield: *flashes entire defending team
---
u/ADingo8MyMemes
---
still better than dokke shorts 
---
Is it only on the test server rn?
---
The game has devolved into severe meta abuse, with 8 broken attackers, forcing defence to play super aggressive, aided by a QEC spamming meta. 
---
* Lion is just beyond broken with his ability that forces defence to stand still, Finka is alright as long as they don't have a shield operator with her, as they can abuse the fast ADS speed.
---
* Dokk is pretty annoying, basically a mini-Lion with her everlasting phone calls. Vigil is good, the best roamer in the game with an amazing gun and gadget that hides him from drones.
---
* Zofia is also good with a great gun and lots of utility.
---
* Maestro is insanely good, but not in an OP way that Lion is, his cams are extremely useful to the defence and for gathering intel. Alibi is okay, everyone has pretty much learnt how to deal with her holograms and her guns aren't outstanding. 
---
* Maverick is very good too, vital on maps like Clubhouse as he can destroy defences with his blowtorch; he has a great gun too. Clash is fairly weak, but very annoying to deal with; you need a coordinated team to utilise her well. 
---
* Finally Nomad is good, her airjabs that launch people are basically just claymores, she doesn't really have a counter so could get nerfed soon. Kaid is insanely good, allowing you to deny hatches being breached and his shotgun/DMR is amazing. 
---
This guy gets it 
---
I‚Äôd say Corsair because I‚Äôm a fanboy but in all honest both are great it just comes down to which you like more
---
I disagree ash was overpowered before the edition of flashes in her kit when she had smoke she was equally broken and threatening to play against
---
Noted
---
Ash doesn‚Äôt even have much utility 
---
We will be EXTRACTIN ENJURE PERRSON!
---
Then you're just bored of siege in general. I don't get what the question is.
---
I feel you should be able to go into settings and toggle the ability to join an ongoing match
---
*Still gets all the connection error icons in game*
---
It would teach you not to be careful of your teammates and to just shoot wildly and randomly with no disregard for the position of your teammates. Later on if you were to switch to ranked you would have to learn that all over. It can be toxic yes but it would ruin the game without it.
---
BTW I call them half eaten matches
---
*japanese

Take no prisoners...

Ok then... Whatever...

My German friends call me a thief sometime ;D Because, you know, that stereotype about Polish people in Germany, haha.

No her hit box is normal people just cant hit there shots so they complain and blame it on other thing to make themselves feel better.
---
It's a weekend event. Apparently it'll be back for this weekend as well.

Only other thing that would really work as you need to learn to be careful with shots so not to shoot teams is reflect damage, but the problem with this is it still really easy abused to be toxic as you just walk infront of someone on purpose now instead 
---
i like most ironsights tbh.

Nice. Any widescreen (21:9) wallpaper planned ?

Im getting 10 kills every game and going against smurfs and it takes like 20 minutes to find out a game, and even a lvl 400 diamond said solo queuing is hell. I can rank up (depending on team) by myself but it takes so long to find a game

1) Press windows key or alt-tab

2) Right click on task bar and choose task manager

Even though she realistically got a buff? Cool.

The first game and the book were made concurrently, for some reason I thought they got the game out first.  TBH Rainbow 6 was probably mostly done by one of Clancy's ghost writers, so which came first is utterly inconsequential.

Don't rape me when I say that's how 90% of toxic German players sound like on PS4 EU.

They either cheat or claim to have abused ur mom with their bratwurst.  I personally gassed one with smoke.

Best. Game. Ever.

According to Ubi ranked and casual games basically last the same amount of time on average
---
I agree in r6 but it definitely is encouraged in dead by daylight
---
...Loses last.
---
No,your Iq is just too low to work properly
---
Errm. I don't play ranked, I play casual, that was the whole point of the comment you absolute potato. 
---
so fuck everyone thats being toxic and racist on siege?
---
What kind of modem? 
---
Damn you for randomly leaving in the middle of a ranked game.
---
I don‚Äôt think it would promote team killing other people on the team. I think It makes team killing your friends more acceptable.
---
I remember that kinda being the original Thatcher Elite outfit.

On one side you have these intertwining paths that have monuments to famous people of spanish decent then on the other side there‚Äôs a Ferris wheel and a templo with this crazy geometric flower garden close. It‚Äôs kinda situated right between all these universities (why I was there) so there‚Äôs a lot of young people hanging around and tourists too.
---
This is because a group of bullies has more tools to their dispossal than a single person, like being inmune to votekicking and being able to teamkill unimpeded by taking turns, and Ubisoft has not done enough work (if any) to address it. A single "hero" cant do anything, and will only get killed.
---
The verbal abuse can be tolerated and solved, but gameplay abuse is impossible to deal with.
---
Or you know you just learn to attack the sites? House is insanely easy to attack. 
---
I mean u could‚Äôve just left the game or muted them lmfao it‚Äôs casual 
---
I remember it too, I kinda wished I could see what it would look like finished. I assume they made that the mute elite.
---
Dude I literally can't play normal Ranked anymore it is so bad. 
---
Except casual is a garbage game mode that needs fixes
---
I think the sites should still be random but I‚Äôd like to see it be shown to defenders and spawn points to attackers. Not a big deal either way though IMO. 
---
Btw, it‚Äôs way less than 70% of the maps that aren‚Äôt in ranked. Pretty sure it‚Äôs just yacht, house, kanal, and tower. Lol
---
Keyboard isn‚Äôt supported on Xbox. You need to buy a MnK adapter to even use MnK on Xbox, which cost a couple hundred $. Because of this third party software it confuses the console into thinking they are using a controller. So it really isn‚Äôt ubis fault 
---
0-2 when i joined
---
I tried this too
---
I think the resolution doesnt fit :(
---
This isn't ranked it's the new game mode but yes that's why I put the opt in, if you suspect something or you just really don't know you look if not you get to supporting your team.
