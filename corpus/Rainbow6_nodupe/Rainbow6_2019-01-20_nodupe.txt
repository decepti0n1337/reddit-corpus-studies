Funny thing is they say its an rp 46, which is a belt fed machine gun, but the gun in game is modelled after the dp. 
---
To do so would mean spending dev time modifying the game's engine  and then debugging the whatever bugs result from those modifications, for what amounts to a minor aesthetic improvement with even more minor effects on gameplay. I doubt it's very high on the list of priorities.
---
What are you gonna buy with it, one skin?
---
 Maestro is reliant on staying alive until the end of the round to get full value. If he dies his Evil Eyes become bulletproof cameras. Good, but not game-changing. His Alda is a beast but aside from that he offers the same utility as others in that bracket.
---
G2a just like most key resellers aren't legit resellers that's why they're cheaper than official resellers. You can be lucky and get a legit key or you can get scammed and the key will get banned sooner or later. 
---
The only platforms that are official are Amazon, Uplay, steam and greenman gaming. 
---
This being said, I'm using unofficial resellers every now and then as well.
---
But that's just my opinion.

Tbh I really liked unlocking the base operators bit by bit, tho I'm talking about the vanilla release, not starter pack progression.  
---
It added a feeling of progression to the game and made you spend some serious time on *each* of them, even those that didn't appeal at first to you. Didn't want to feel like you wasted renown unlocking them without using them, so people mostly tried to play all of them.  
---
Unlocking that last operator felt like finally finishing "tutorial mode", allowing one to settle on mains, after trying all the options.
---
aw shit, so i have to buy it at its full price?

---
Think of all the specialist we could have purchased  😓
---
Nope. I don't need to wake up I'm accepting of the fact that ubisoft simply can't handle adding things like this with the enormous amount of other bugs that plague the game currently. Don't be such a sour puss this is something the community has requested countless times I was just showing people how I practice getting used to a sense and practice flicks.

Why you bullying Sam?

It it way **WAY** more complicated than changing an arbitrary value in the games code. While I do agree it’s a problem, there isn’t much they can do about it. I know Fortnut has MnK under control. Well they had, for about *a week*, before the company selling the Xim adapters simply updated their software. The companies making these adapters can just... *adapt* &amp; mold to take advantage of any loopholes they can. The only way that Siege could somewhat lessen this issue ATM is by having a separate queue for MnK (official, not adapters). This would lessen the demand for MnK adapters, and the players who play with controller players whilst using an adapter would dwindle over time. The player base is big enough for a split &amp; it might even draw in new players who are used to playing other KnM games on console.

Dear lord for whenever we witness Yöööööden.

Even though this is a rant, I find the quote "let us trash players be trash" as wholesome

boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

*just gets enough renown for the op. has no attachments 
---
I’m saving all my alpha packs until the end of wind bastion. I only have 3 since I’ve only played for like 10 hours out of the whole season
---
‘Attacker’
---
My highest was 52% I think
---
I bought them all just to make a hoe's panties wet
---
Reminds me of good toxic days when everyone was ash jager main, and playing toxic spawnpeek with acog...
---
Noob friendly? Noobs get shit on in this game, attachments mean jack shit when you and I know what walls are soft and flank routes and angles to hold
---
As an OG player I dont feel kicked to the curb, they made the game easier to get into as a new player, that makes the playerbase more expansive but has no affect on any of us original players its a win win
---
Huh?
---
On god 
---
Way to many combinations of things to be done. The Elite will be one special skin but that’s it.
---
Thankfully I had started playing a week before they removed paying for them 
---
*Through wall* A real big fucking hole, coming right up
---
I mean who are the fucks who enjoy playing in copper 
---
Now I need to make the Original office intro in siege.
---
 
---
Do you have ur thing on push to talk? And has ur mic worked before in rainbow?
---
What’s the point in adding new ops if the community still revolves around the same 10-20
---
poor quality troll 
---
I feel like they could at least detect movements faster than what a controller could do. Correct me if I’m wrong, but you can’t look around THAT fast with a controllers sensitivity
---
Youre right they dont have to grind for attachments, or grind for some base ops, that makes the game easier to get into as a new player which otherwise might deter people from playing, thats a win win for everyone
---
When you bought the attachments did you use them? Get your renowns worth out of them? You dont get a refund for that
---
Ok 
---
[deleted]
---
Back in S2 when I played on PS4, I finally unlocked everyone about midway through the season. So for the rest of the season, I literally purchased every single attachment for every single character. I'd like my Tom Currency back Ubi lol.
---
shields up close are very strong, as long as they are not in melee range they can hipfire you and you can't do anything. But blitz isn't the worst for that, monty is.
---
Fixed it by setting to default and reverting my stuff back
---
monty is way worse. Blitz is easily countered compared to monty
---
Yeah Agreed\^
---
Cash is a far better bomb site now however bar is \*completely\* useless to defend now :(
---
Yep, got shot in the dick and died to a headshot just earlier today. Can't say I blame sledge though, I'd just die if I got shot there too
---
It's probably like playing whack a mole for them, which might be fun for someone who wants to run around like it's call of duty and shoot people
---
So nomads furious research in the main menu led her to believe that it's all about the paragraph?
---
Which makes this argument that a refund is deserved even worse wouldnt you say? You didnt spend real money on them just in game money you earn after every match, in game money that you can earn infinitely
---
I'm more annoyed the name is Bullfog and not Bullfrog
---
i've edited my replay
---
Ubisoft can’t do anything about it complain to Sony or Microsoft 
---
Is it just me or did I just witness a proper toilet sign 
---
other teams being a way more agressive , g2 making a lot of errors and they cant seem to find an answer to this kind of agression , its one of the few times where the teams do everything to not let g2 play like they would like too , problably just a hard pass like secret is having , we will know at six 
---
So money just falls from trees for you? Most people would have worked for the money to buy said hypothetical blanket
---
these are the quality shitposts i like to see
---
You shouldn't have fought back, it's your own fault.
---
Best thing I do with griefers (they're very rare on PC) is run Infront of them shooting over and over Intentionally untill they're kicked lol.
---
I once got an alpha pack at 2.3 and I’ve gone as high as 52
---
Should've just changed bandits to "drugs"
---
People never enter that way, they breach the windows, plant, then set up their angles &amp; you’re done-diddly-done for

Lion's operator page.
---
dumbass
---
Tachanka-chan
---
They can't do anything about it sadly
---
They are, OP had the better aim and situational awareness. He used it more offensively because his whole team was wiped but otherwise it was great gameplay. Prime example: Enemy team even managed to Gu him but nobody pushed to capitalize him pulling the needle out...
---
i bought literally every attachment and operator and two weeks later they came out with the for free
---
I have to agree. On paper, the O.C.S. is bad, and the bullets are OP. I suppose we would need to see how this works, but I do like the idea of having a 2nd sniper in Siege
---
My only black ice was for pmm 
---
Dust clears up and you can see Kaid still on his chair with his cat looking menacingly at the wall, with one hand on his trusty .44 magnum aimed at the hole and other caressing his little feline friend.  
---
lmao , me and my ps1 controler playing in copper 
---
&gt;He is probably using mouse and keyboard and spam crouching really fast
---
So you don't even know for sure? Just need an excuse as to why you lost?

But we need it like for thachanka, lion(hopefully in australian season by pengu),castle, (now by the ubisoft) frost, glaz, blitz, fuze. Reworks would realy help the game like have you ever played Kapkan before season reinforcements? I didnt played him and look its my main now.
---
I like your idea about the queue but what is the incentive for the MnK'ers to use the official queue? 
---
You don’t know how high it can fly
---
There’s a glitch right now where it doesn’t show ranks at the end of the match
---
Close, but no cigar
---
...
---
*I’ll show myself out*
---
I'd just try to play casual as much as possible. I'm able to play ranked, but prefer not to. It's just not as fun nor as "casual".
---
Yeah, that's true. Jackal's gadget can be near-useless unless used correctly.
---
It looks good
---
Ahh, my bad. Haven’t had the chance to play in a while.
---
But again, reporting them to R6Tab if they fit under the ban rules is the best way.
---
Only issue is that accidental team kills are also on that list, why punish people who genuinely made a mistake?
---
Whenever I see these sink selfies I fear for you guys breaking the sink :(
---
True for PC as well. If you're not using push to talk, turn off your mic
---
Does anybody know why the ACS12 skin, most of the skin have some sort of yellow tint on it? It looked so bad ...
---
When I first got the game my friend did not tell me about recruit existing so I was grinding singleplayer for like 5 hours and got 2 ops and then friend said “ hey come play with me” and I said I don’t have three ops yet and that’s when I learned recruit existed
---
Stop grinding for karma, it’s your first day on reddit clearly and you only care about karma like it’s a game to beat others
---
They are most prob saving strats for the invitational. later this season i think next month.
---
I like the sniper rifle if you take away the reinforcement penetration
---
Spotted the virgin

Downvoting because no cigar

I think we need a forgive tk type thing
---
It’s not attractive when anyone cusses- it’s immoral and doesn’t make you any better of a person. Obviously you’re not a good person either 
---
I just never bought attachments ever until i had all the base ops. Was sooooooo pissed when i found out about the free attachments
---
Real shit, if that enemy team had moved no one would have gotten killed and Pulse would have died. WTF where they doing?
---
Thank
---
Not to mention it's hacker paradise
---
I still think Ubi should have done this as a reward to the players who did get all the ops and attachments.  This would have literally made everyone happy about the change.
---
I felt really screwed over about the changes to the starter edition. I mainly play on xbox but i picked up the started edition on pc then 1 week later they announce the change. I only got 2 ops and new players got 6....like for real? They could have very easily given original starter edition buyers even just 2 more ops for free or enough reknown to buy the other 4 or even 2. Oh well..
---
250 just for an acog...
---
Oui, j'aime les idees!
---
Thy guy really needs to chill the fuck out and learn how to aim. Looked like a neurological episode occurred while playing.
---
Except, fuze is probably the best shield operator. Blitz is underwhelming since you can shoot through his shield when hes sprinting. Dont gotta downvote just cause you disagree. Theres plenty who agree with me and plenty who disagree.
---
What like you never cussed yourself?
---
But that is realistic 
---
All dog tags have a plastic/rubber "frame" to reduce noise and so you don't cut yourself.
---
Right after the Machinima channel deleted everything.
---
Yep, I saved up all my renown and bought every base operator and a month later they made them all free
---
Its a great causal match, but not good for ranked.
---
On defence: Lesion Maestro Smoke Mute Kapkan
---
On attack: Fuse Twitch Sledge Thatcher Jackal

同行十二年，不知Chanka是女郎！
---
I cried...they should give my renown back...and the time they took away for unlocking it all
---
So that you make less mistakes. If you shoot your own teammate in the head you DESERVE to get kicked- immediately. Whether it was an accident or not. That's my take on it. 
---
Fucking hate TKers.
---
It’s casual. So everyone spawns at the same place
---
The deagle's iron sights are about 40000000000 miles above where it shoots so I can't entirely blame him. Probably nerves too, I relate.
---
I don't think it's a bug, and I doubt anything is going to be done about it.
---
If it's during, sure, no problem there. Just no kill credit. But people can disconnect freely no matter what's happening or their state in the game. Alive, DBNO, or dead, they're allowed to leave the game as they wish. All it does is make them kinda dickish. 
---
I don't think there's any way to "fix" is this problem, at least in Casual.

I had gotten literally every attachment
---
the D O L L A R 
---
Thanks I'll add you next time I'm on. 
---
Yeah well but it dosent matter if you got what you suppossed to get. 
---
I'd love to play with you sometime and help you get where you want to be. I'm assuming you play pc?
---
Honestly, whichever works for you. Play around with the settings in Lone Wolf THunt and see which suits you best. Because to be honest, I've never tweaked with them myself.
---
So glad i joined siege really late haha
---
I really hated when ubi made the switch. I had already bought every operator and every attachment when they swapped it over and they didnt refund...
---
I will definitely stand around and pop up like a gopher or fight back lol. Practice makes perfect and I'm nowhere near perfect lol 
---
Needs more spaghetti.
---
Yeah, my uplay is Arkiece.
---
Dont give up you may be at the point where you need to use strats at all times but simply dont and are unable to use a good bit of your talent because they are better coordinated
---
yeah I'm aware, I just needed a video to link to. The report has already been made to there website.
---
Alright what are the “big” effects
---
You would've gotten upvotes if you had just posted all of this to an imgur album. This is spammy af.
---
What, that’s not true at all? Up until he was straight up banned in pro league he was the exact same 
---
It was the day before they announced it for me and I want a refund
---
My bad I’m new to the sub
---
It’s been posted before. I was thinking they could be a part of Víkingasveitin (Iceland’s CTU) which translates to *The Viking Squad*. 
---
Thank you
---
Yeah, haha
---
Keep your wits together and don't stop trying to improve until you burn out. I'm sure you'll be back on your feet in no time if you continue to play and seek improvement.

I hope so! Worth acknowledging that if I want good results, I need to try pretty hard.

His wifi is fine, his wifi adaptwr is not. Happened to me too and I didn't realize why until I started using etgernet. Tell him to use wired or get an actual wifi adapter instead of using his cheap mobo.

What are their “uses”. And that’s not even close to 10k
---
i sent him a link to an adapter but i think he’s getting ethernet in a few weeks, thanks for the help

Also sometimes going outside is the most efficient way to rotate between bomb sites or get a flank, such as between CCTV and Lockers on Oregon. 
---
If something pops up on the attackers screen immediately once I walk towards CCTV my flank just got completely neutralized.

In which things that really work in real life really work in the game striving to be real, and it is not a sidetrack it is a legit counterpoint to this

---
It is
---
It’s funny cuz I stole this meme, and then you stole it from me, I’m excited to see where this chain leads
---
I thought the whole point of the rule is they can't link their youtube accounts, how does it make sense for the rule to exist if a mod is just going to sticky a comment linking it instead? It's showing it off far more than the OP just commenting it themselves. 
---
That is not the point for this that's why I said it's an invite only system or your account is under review before you even get access to this.
---
Everybody can submit themselves for a review.
---
Nope, i only got 4 ops and 600 r6 credits
---
How big of a dick do you have to be? He made a practice for himself to get better and announced it to others so they could use it to get better as well. Just because you dont find him placing the targets (DIY part) on the map for training (training map) to be a DIY training map then you wont accept anything short of a whole new game mode.
---
It looks like the guy in the trash can from Sesame Street. 
---
Yep, I remember buying thermite, my last one at the time, the day before the announcement.
---
I almost think k/d shouldn't be displayed. Just wanted w/l. Creates too much toxicity and these retard players that think they're playing cod. I can't tell you how many rounds I've lost on bomb from people being kill hungry and not planting.

Soo good
---
I can’t really say how viable it would be without the numbers but if possible I think it is the way to go.

Damn, someone already said Post Malone. Oh well, looks great!

Bring the plates up to me or I interrogate you too.

Good idea, but I feel like it would ruin callouts. Maybe you choose a rotation of usernames?

Yes, but it still gives everyone who uses it an unfair advantage, and with the way streaming games works and the gameplay of siege stream sniping is less of a problem than people make it out to be

I just slap these bad boys behind the defuser. you have no idea how much people this fools.
---
I gotta try that sometime good idea!
---
Man I just bought the standard addition and with my 30 hours of play time I only unlocked 1 operator that I kind of regret, I would rather have to unlock every operator with the prices being lower then having all base ops and paying 25000 for each.

They should do what Rockstar did in GTA Online and have bad sport lobbies for cheaters, tkers, and leavers. They can still play casual and ranked, but at a reduced renown rate, and if they play ranked they have different rank states, sort of like going from different data centers and having to start a different ranked. It would be much better and it would make people not want to be toxic, especially if they cut out the 30 minute ban entirely and make sure the game remembers however long you were banned last for the whole season and reset the next season.

Was that Megalovania in the first few seconds? I would have loved to hear that
---
Im wet
---
Bullshit. That's what it is. Dropshotting 2.0. They spam lean (left right left right) and crouch (up down up down) with a dumb macro and it basically makes them headshot proof (by fucking up the hitbox and becoming a target so fast moving its just a pain in the ass). I say those who use it need to be banned. Literally no skill (script kiddy is never more applicable) and it ruins the game. I tried out crouch spamming by rebinding my keys and even that was ridiculous (also wasn't doing the lean shit). Having a macro so you can have full focus on aim is just extra shit added to the problem. Fuck your friend.
---
And ya Im just a silver but Im pretty sure everyone agrees on me with this. If you've seen it its some fuckin BS.

I played another match then exited and came back about an hour later. I was still low gold 4. I guess the grind was for nothing 😪

Ubi doesn't fix things they just break more things and call it balance
---
Even a loss is enough to buy an attachment wtf?

Definitely bannable. He’s exploiting a known issue with hit registration to gain an unfair advantage.

---
I like the lighting
---
What in tarnation. Dude the best tips I can give you is just keep pumping hours in the game but also watch videos on the pro players and watch their streams. 
---
Study how they move and spots they use. Even if you aren’t good at shooting map knowledge can make the difference between a loss and a win. Know the layout and also know the limit of your ability. 
---
Also take advice from people you play with, I know a lot of them just scream nonsense but someone might give you a tip or something that could help later on. 
---
A good bandit can use one battery to bait out 2-3 of your emps just to get one wall clear (a decent mute can do the same), Jäger ADS (indoors), and you can straight up shoot the emp if you can see it. If you look at it, in a way he's even countered by his fellow attackers, Twitch, Maverick, and IQ are sometimes said to be better at removing gadgets. IMO Kaid was never really intended to be for electrifying walls, more for hatches, shields, and barbed wire sometimes getting a wall close enough to a doorway to get everything. Not to mention that Thatcher's pick rate has got to be on the low side. There are a lot of ops on a lot of objectives that can just open a floor or ceiling or use explosives and get rid of all of those gadgets anyway. 
---
that sounds pretty accurate. weird that nobody really knows exactly 
---
You really gave no idea what gatekeepong is. 
---
Who the hell was rapping like it was a csgo surf server smh
---
You don’t have that many hours so I would say you’re around where I was when i started playing too. There are definitely a lot of players better than you and I both though. This was also my first season playing ranked and I placed Bronze 2 but am now Bronze 4. So we both suck.

I'm new to the game. I've unlocked 1 operator after 40 hours of actual in-match time.

Kinda fucked.

I was at 93 once

Too bad i smoked these fools last match
---
Honestly ubi can add a fatigue to lean and crouch and the problem is fixed

100 up, 20 down

This was my kind of idea for Lions rework, making the obnoxious sound and vibration of his drone cover sounds of attackers, I guess we will see what they do with him.

Defense probably shot him before to lower his health.

Seems broken, this game ode seems easy for the attackers, just use a cluster bomb, either it kills all the defenders or it also kills the president
---
[removed]
---
When will the lies end?
---
no they’re not, you just have to know how they work. 
---
Wow GG. Guess I’m lucky, I’m lvl 133 and have 7 or 8
---
sry miss read you comment. Still if you are in situations where you can't do anything about a cav you are doing something wrong, she is one of the worst ops on defence
---
yes it means it’s not a nerf either and the long range capabilities have been buffed fuck me you’re dense 
---
Looks staged af not even copper are this blind
---
no anime
---
When you first started to play and you didn't know how to control recoil so you messed up and bought red dot for all your guns then some random youtuber told that reflex sight is good so you buy them and finally you understand that Holographic and ACOG are the best.
---
Oh, What operators might feel useless? I can see how operators like Mira might feel useless if they are moving the president around the whole map, but she can be useful if they choose to hunker down.
---
What are you talking about, that’s the best strategy in the game
---
I am in love with this concept art.
---
oh I didn’t know that, tbh I was just basing it off of movies and stuff but even still I’d prefer the metal ones 
---
But what if you have the n word pass 
---
the fact that i hate the most about this is that people that play on pc say that it's not that bad you can still kill them bla bla bla, it's pretty annoying
---
my record is 83% lmao
---
That bag in front.. thats the round saver!
---
&gt; many operators would feel utterly useless
---
Like?
---
it’s terrible 
---
One way it could be balanced out would be that the attackers are unable to track the president? Or nerf it so that Fuze's bombs deal reduced damage to the President. 
---
If the defenders move the President constantly, it can be difficult for Fuze to cluster bomb them as well.
---
Don't even get me started on barrels. I could have bought two dlc ops by that time.
---
i recommend buying clash or echo since both are very good operators but if you want to wim, you must buy clash
---
This is the greatest truth.
---
This sub has the dumbest mods in all game subs
---
Welp, we found his Holographic. But the ACOG is nowhere to be seen
---
nah dude if he's really canadian then why doesn't him have a poutine weapon skin and a hockey stick charm?
---
I think it's an interesting idea, but it has some issues like balancing. Maybe have it as an arcade mode/non competitive without gadgets or recruit only with the choice of attachments. I think it could freshen up the gameplay loop.
---
shitpost
---
yesterday i got an alpha pack with about 15% and there was a black ice. had to flex on yall real quick
---
Same here, though I imagine for different reasons
---
You know Frost Had To do it to 'em
---
When you finally unlock that dlc op but have no more renown for attachments.  
---
I always thought it was a weak insult. There are so much more awful things you can say to make people angry.
---
"I hope your mother is dead"
---
Just say "umad" or "ezpz" over and over
---
"I'm going to kill your pets when you're asleep"
---
"Go back to Call of Duty where you belong"
---
You can be rage inducing without being racist, now I happily await the downvotes and hatemail.
---
Is that really an issue though ?
---
le roc
---
Like what others have already mentioned, known issues could be how some attackers can easily kill the President, or how some defenders can be totally useless. Ubi might have to tweak the damage numbers for this to work.
---
What nerf? 
---
oh fuck it's the gamer word
---
Hmm...
---
MP5 damage from 30 to 27 
---
i dont get in any matches are ubis server down or something im searching for an hour for a game on all modes wtf is wrong 
---
I was silver 1 and fell to copper 3 when I started playing the game. Never played solo queue in these ranks again.
---
I had every single base op andprobably 90% of attachments, that update hurt my soul
---
Any corner has the potential to work against players who fail to check corners. 
---
so because there’s one spot on one map that is barely used in ranked play where flashes don’t work they’re bad? being able to blind someone even if they’re looking away from you within a 3m radius is crazy strong, they don’t work like that in any other game I’ve played. I haven’t had a problem with the last one in a long time, can’t really comment on that other than personal experience 
---
They should be ousted from the game.

Cut your losses and buy standard or expanded edition. The grind for renown in the starter version is glacial.

It's supposed to have Maestro Main but for whatever reason its not there
---
Please, nobody really ever leaves.
---
Tachocolate Puffs probably contains vodka and godliness

Completely forgot about this. It was such a stress deciding which ops to buy first and which ones to wait and buy for more renown

Did you win the match?

Maverick is pretty useful. 
---
Ah, that is so painful! The next week after i bought them all they become free( I spent all my renown for it.
---
it was the same statement as posted here, i accidently posted it as a new comment instead of a reply... and i guess congrats, you called me out on something obvious. i should rot away for providing links i guess. sorry for being the root of all evil? you gonna call me out on typing with poor grammer? maybe for going to reddit.com? you gonna complain about that link too? whats your point? just to have a shitty attitude it seems
---
Yes
---
I bought Mav with the remaining money in my steam wallet...
---
This had to be casual. 
---
Smurfs and half my team leaving seems to be a common occurance in bronze-silver. Probably the worst solo queue experience I've had in any competitive game. 
---
Nomad is a counter for roamers and flanking. Her airjab will make people fly backwards if they get in the zone. 
---
Maverick has a torch that can open unreinforced hatches. He can also make holes in reinforced and unreinforced walls to get line of sight or destroy gadgets. 
---
Maestro has his Evil Eye that can destroy drones, gadgets from attackers and annoy attackers who are planting. It does 5 damage per shot. 
---
Alibi has her clones, they reveal an attackers location if they shoot on her clones. 
---
Credit goes to : Sunstark
---
yeah it’s really hard I play it off and on, never really played it consistently at all, and sometimes you get a newb team and you do alright but other times you get put against a team with complete map knowledge and they are shooting you through a pin hole down this one angle they know your going to be down because they know the spawns. That or they are outside already shooting you. 
---
"It's dirty job, but someone gotta do it"
---
Pure truth from you here, the map is imbalanced as fuck and is overall not fun to play, just like theme park lmao, lighting is fucked.
---
Everyone knows the best entry point is the wall from the stairs
---
i wanna see how it looks on the keratos
---
The halloween map or the anime studio?
---
When i saw the tiltle i thought you will show a broken headshot, i guess instead you showed a headshot breaking someone :/
---
Or a smaller damage nerf and a slight recoil increase and a fix for the Doc/Rook neck/head HitReg.
---
"FUCK OFF!"
---
"Okay.."
---
Nah the level 20 requirement, at least for me, is a really good idea for the noobs to learn the game. So they don't Shrek in ranked
---
Hitreg is a problem in everyone, their head is already easy to see
---
Get out of here Ela main! This is the Maestro ONLY club &gt;:( !
---
The only thing they are nerfing is the damage. Damage doesn’t matter when it comes to headshots. 
---
Which would have been better
---
Especially for the 3-armor ops, more than often you hit their head and it counts as a neck shot.
---
🎶Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh uh oh, uh oh,
---
Here comes the hammer🎶
---
Went old school on y'all
---
But what if it was a staged custom match?
---
Thanks for this lol
---
So you're the kind of person who TKs when they don't get to pick Ash or when somebody kills the person your downed? Right. Thought those people were too scared to be on the sub because they know they'll get outright insulted for being toxic.
---
Just for clarification, I know year 1, the infamous year of BB-800, the most broken operator in the game that can't be fixed. And no, I haven't played LoL, and won't be playing it anytime soon.
---
Maybe using middle mouse button for nades. It's more holdable.
---
Now all we need is Yöööden with Valkyrie cameras
---
;)
---
I swapped my gadget bindings so that nades and stuff are on the mousewheel and primary gadgets are on G. It helps a lot with throwing nades, although using Candelas as Ying is a lot more awkward. (The same thing for Thatcher, although with him it's not as important to throw accurately.)
---
Do you like your new nerf

Shields are so broken at the moment. Seems to be a huge disconnect between the direction it appears to be facing and what the server sees.

Correct. At some point "Ela" turned into "Ella" and then it hit a spanish translation.
---
Jager says give it a shot
---
Jager will not let you forsake his God
---
This is why you do your research 
---
This clip probably happened in a copper match that OP deranked his smurf to so that they could do this.
---
r/unexpectedborderlands
---
Yes.
---
Cause casual doesn't teach you anything, and 4 minutes timer is a waste of time. A sense of urgency is necessary in this game, and casual doesn't teach you that.
---
T hunt teaches a lot of good and bad habits. That said, try it before ranked. You are going to find some fairly rude persons if you don't know what you are doing. 
---
We have the russian language to thank for this.

***HELLO FELLOW TACHANKA MAIN!***
---
I'm on console too fortunately.

Sounds like a wookie to me
---
Yeah, he was a one man army when during release

Unfortunately if you’re playing R6S in 2019 you’re playing LoL.

That's awesome!

Andddddd it’s console 
---
“YeaH bUt NOt AlL!!!1!!!!1!l”
---
we NEED it. I think about this everyday ffs
---
Good thing im a team player
---
I don't think it's caused by the SSD or lack there of, sometimes I have no loafing time at all whiöe some other times I load for 1-2 minutes, if anything Ubisoft is causing this.
---
This is pretty dope. Give us more my dude.

Also it works wonders I got a freebie yesterday on fortress by dipping In on top of rook from the ladder corner
---
By the amount of clips like these that are being uploaded here i'd say this is pretty average. Pcmasterrace
---
Yes this happened because their on console.
---
So what you are saying is: I want the other team to lose a member in ranked so I can savee 2 minutes of waiting time and will have an easier match.
---
Wow
---
Try and train them in custom games. You’re a skilled player, and they need some help. Obviously this may come across as a bit obnoxious, but try your best to make it fun for them. Assign each team member a role that they play in most matches e.g. Tom - Hardbreacher, Jerry - Softbreacher etc.
---
Also, what platform and region do you play on? I’d like to play with you if possible.
---
The lmg is litteraly is the best lmg in game with holo it has 0 recoils
---
Zofia is made for pushing
---
Stealth:100
---
Really good at short range but at medium recoil is the problem 
---
Nah, fam. I've seen LoL. Siege is very different.
---
Besides, I don't see the problem with futuristic gadgets and long hallway maps. Take maestro for instance. Dude was called out for being futuristic by the idiots who thought siege was realistic but today he and alibi are the only ops that didn't get nerfed during the season and only got a minor nerf later on and are still decently balanced and have no "OP" factor. In contrast, every operator since year 1 season 2 has seen some major alterations, biggest being broken BB-800, who definitely had it coming. As for maps, look at how beautiful villa turned out! Great sites, great vertical play, and overall nothing too excessive about it. Pros like it as well.
---
I'd say siege is in a good place now. If Ubi can sort out the balance issues (the operator boot camp in pro league is a good start; at least pros can influence the balance decisions now, which is good, since they have 12000 hours worth of knowledge to back their points), ping issues and the hacker problem, there's nothing stopping this game from being infinitely better than CS:GO.
---
Is her m769 good tho?
---
She was never bad. And never will be.
---
She's solid. 10/10 would make her my best girl if I didn't already enjoy Hibana and IQ more.
---
I guess I could handle it .
---
I'll give it a try when soon , thank you !
---
I used to be able to rack up enough renown to buy say a sight in one game. It really didn't take that long for me atleast when I started playing
---
Copper* platform isnt the issue
---
On what level of heaven do I go if I'm a Rook main. 
---
Not good as the lmg bud good against spawn peeks bc her first 3 shoots have litteraly no recoil
---
&gt; Can someone explain this please?
---
I can.
---
"Ubisoft".
---
What Operators are you good at, and who do you play on consulate most often?
---
What level do people who shoot it before anyone, even themselves, gets it go to?
---
Oof why u use Red dot
---
Also it's 9$ on humble 
---
The pain of knowing you will never get all that renown back.
---
practice your vertical game 
---
Ah I understand. repeat offenders getting tougher sanctions. There is a kind of system in place, I think the banned time just increases after each abandon. It's annoying to have leavers for sure, I think this game is best played with a 5 stack. Understandably not everyone can do so and therefore your idea would be helpful in keeping the not so serious ranked players out of ranked. Kind of like how we need a forgive option for teamkills. 
---
I've seen plenty of embarrassing stuff taking place on PC on this very subreddit.
---
It happens more often than console because:
---
• 75% of the user base plays there
---
• All the little kids are likely to play on console
---
This doesn't change the fact that shit like this only happens at the lowest MMRs, regardless of the platform.
---
I'm lvl 191 and I believe I can think of myself as a good player: **never** have I witnessed anything close to this.
---
Worked out great 
---
Dude be careful the random's name is on the top left 
---
Good Idea maby invite some content creators to push the tournament.
---
"it's not.much, but it's honest work"
---
Hm okay :)
---
They're the devil himself
---
For Lesions SMG use the holographic aight you can control it way more, use the shield and place your gu traps further away from the objective then throughout the round place them in the doorways so you dont have to leave the objective to place your traps it saves you time and health
---
doing so requires external hardware and can get you banned. now will Ubisoft ACTUALLY look into tickets? no lol
---
Dont frag yourself

Oh of course, I wouldn't want to punish people just for an odd DC  just the regular ones. I bet you'd see a great drop it it happening if they were a lot tougher. As of now, I simply EXPECT my team to not be full come the end of the game, every game. It's extremely frustrating.
---
It's a feature purely for dramatic effect
---
So it was basically one DLC operator, so like around a month and half of playing?

How would it be good for multiplayer? Noobs already have it tough enough with Smurfs in their games

I'm still a bit new but have, I believe 45 hours on so far, but I have been watching a bunch of pro league to try and learn map knowledge and cams and all that. Maestro always seems to get picked and is normally last 2 alive. With his Alda and Baliff, I believe he has one of the top 3 Kits on defense. Plus his Evil Eyes. 3 Armour anchor with an Acog on an LMG. Idk, This based on what I've seen and the 1 time I played him at a friends house. Hope this helps even if it's small.
---
Love that Ela is just "She"
---
Well yeah but context
---
I think this was added to but make them so viable during spawn peeks and such. They are and should be support ops picked primarily for their utilities rather than their firepower.
---
Pure skill.
---
Its happened on xbox for a while now it will come and go between rounds ubi have mentioned ig but havent fixed it been around for years now
---
It makes sense to me. As a long-time rook and doc player, the mp5 plus very good gadgets is really strong. If I'm playing rook on a good day, I can give myself a decent health boost with rook armor, use my very useful impacts to open up angles, and chain headshots with the mp5. 
---
This nerf just makes is more necessary to hit those headshots.
---
Did you guys see that? If you watch closely you can clearly see he’s hacking cause he ran lightning speed
---
As dumb as it sounds just don’t use the ACOG on buck’s gun. People shit on his guns when there is already a lot of recoil, then make it harder for themselves to hit things with an ACOG. A reflex/holo on his dmr isn’t that bad in all fairness with a compensator
---
I don't know your setup, but whenever this happens to me it ends up being the volume control of my headphones that are right on the actual headphones.

Sorry for the late response. He was using a mouse and keyboard but he seemed like a subpar PC player, nothing too good imo considering the fact that he wasn’t top kills while having this advantage over console players.
---
In my opinion Alibi. Shes much more fun to play but you need to practice where to throw her Prismas. 
---
Holo if you want to see what you’re shooting better, reflex if you want to see around you better

Ela, but that’s just preference, but all you need to do is set up your mines on or near site, and then lurk or roam
---
I think part of the issue with casual &lt;lv. 20 is that you just don't have a rank yet, so the game can't place you with similar players. I find that most of the time you get put in casuals with similar ranks, but for new players, anything goes.

Scroll wheel works, and it doesn't switch your weapon; if you were holding your primary, pull out a nade and scroll you still have your prinary

Ah thanks

I’ll check but I’m pretty sure it’s in game

Alibi. Better gun imo
---
Awwwww.... Isn't that sweet.
---
LMG’s aren’t used for damage, they’re good for suppressing and just having a bunch of ammo in general, the ALDA needs a nerf lol
---
I have my doubts as to Ubi's intentions with this "bug" but I think it's been fixed in the TTS and will come back along with the changes to Cav and Clash, which makes me happy

That text isn't used by any popular YouTuber, it just has a similar style. If you can find another YouTuber who uses it, send me the link so I can cry myself to sleep for not being original again.

I use comp on ARX
---
Umm.. Didnt have video recording on so i had to move fast :) Still got the shot tho
---
Porque?
---
claymores dont always kill, it depends how far youre away from the explosive end. The c4s worry me tho, some map parts like the white truck on consulate just kinda suck up the explosion in general...

Never knew Helen Keller was an operator

Nope, we lost all of them that night. But don't worry, we will get Plat 3 someday. . . someday. . .

Every clip like this just further give console players a bad impression. We’re not all this garbage smh

Had the same 2 days ago, later that day i queued for 8 mins, thought it was a glitch restarted my game and got asked if i wanted to rejoin my ranked match. After accepting i queued 4 mins but still couldnt rejoin it. Trying to get a casual to see if uplay was bugged i instantly got a match...
---
Nice 1

Yeah plus your entire arm gives you way more controll and precision than just your thumb

Blitz &amp; Blackbeard. I immediately know you have little skill when you pick them.

Well I mean let’s be honest the only acog op on defender that’s not op is probably kaid shotgun maybe doc too 
---
I do my best to hype up my teams when we play. Gotten a few responses from teammates about how I inspired them to get better. A “good kill” here and a “we got this” goes a long way.
---
wow you got a skin that could be bought much wow such post wow
---
It's funny to imagine what they thought when they saw the killcam

I never play as cav and go out of my way to avoid her when attacking. Does she have the ability to go invisible? Because that would explain a LOT.

That. Is the stuff of nightmares!

Nope, this is on ranked Hereford Base

---
I dare say I was reported by a few people.
---
Outplayed
---
Mav and clash are spot on
---
Free throws and regular shots are completely different. There’s a lot more mental pressure during free throws. The man sucks at free throws. He’s a decent shooter and a great playmaker. People only shot on him because it’s trendy 
---
Blitz was made for bitches
---
Lol
---
Looks like plasma pink, it's an alpha pack legendary universal skin but i think it got removed so it's not available anymore.

Take them on terrorist hunts! Ease them into siege. 
---
Then how will I have dance parties
---
It’s already out. I bought her last month and it was there
---
I too enjoy going to the Caveria and buying some caves.
---
My longest common record was 18 then to break the chain I got a rare chibi that was a duplicate. Didn’t feel that great ngl
---
welcome to siege?
---
Pulse
---
Making the switch as well and it’s painful. From gold 1 to not even able to play ranked.
---
How did you make that without the game ending immediately
---
Maestro is better in such categories as : weapons,secondaries,main gadget. Valkyrie is a 2 speed so she is quicc and thicc , Maestro is a fat boy because he ate too much meatballs and he is a 3 speed. Maestro is a great anchor,Valkyrie is a great passive roamer (roams near the objective usually) .
---
I agree
---
Glad it was good for you!
---
Bruh what?? Lol
---
Same with South Africans, we don't have servers so we have to play with Europeans  I'm guess it's the same for them 
---
In my year of playing siege, I have never had that happen to me, even with me playing anchors almost exclusively, I’ve only been suppressed once in my time here, and all I did was sit back, relax and look for a more dangerous threat, when I saw the angle of the shots shift that’s when I returned my attention to the shooter and let them walk into my sights. I’m not saying a coordinated team couldn’t achieve this, but it would be difficult. The best way this could happen would be if it was a 1v3-5, in which case there would be nothing you could do, because you don’t anyone to support you and they’re flanking you and pinching you into a corner
---
pure luck. if it was skill or hacks then you wouldn’t have missed half of your mag
---
Well hello there fellow Maestro main.
---
smokes have not been been working either
---
You can create custom games locally as a player and it will let you play as the only person. 
---
Fucking what
---
When is it
---
Lol not trying to be harsh but watch it again, at no point were you actually aiming at the trap yet hipfire almost gave it to you.
---
Kk
---
No, just no 
---
It’s a little threatening😂
---
Are you saying he is more of a “cav on attack”, with more stealth based breaching? Or for making silent murder holes and holding an angle to prevent a retake of objective?
---
Guilded  you can do scrims with your team but as far as tournaments for ps4 there is esl and if your lucky you could get enough people to do a tournament with your friends 
---
Thanks, that honestly helps a lot 
---
Wait. I think... this drone... sacrified itself for you to live. I think it somehow suppressed the explosion. I don't know how that's possible but that's the most reasonable explanation
---
No clue
---
Love the guy in blue team Who left 1 sec after you killed him
---
Hello
---
Tachanka because a lack of mobility is a disadvantage in Siege 
---
Thx
---
That's for sure, but I still don't know what's wrong man
---
I think a simple fix for the lean and crouch spam is it try to do it fast more than three times in a certain time intervals then the system just choked and wouldn’t respond until you take 1 - 1.5 seconds to stop. And Ash just needs a better hit box. Lesion is fine where he is. 
---
But it's a 2v4?
---
pls no bully
---
Because temporal is a cool word. Don't you want cool settings enabled?
---
😂 no where near that. That’s quality. Most I’ve got is 14
---
Depends who she is 
---
I understand why why blitz and Fuze didnt see you but its a mystery to me how the first one didnt see you
---
they should take away ash’s acog to balance her. there is no other way to really nerf her without messing up her character. they should also nerf lesion by putting up recoil a bit.
---
Props to you but I’m afraid I will not upvote this dO to the very reason that you are a cav main
---
Maybe on PC, but most of us console plebs couldn't do nothin with it
---
Guess he’s just the better player.
---
Recruit doesn’t belong in the game, might as well just let everyone have base game ops for free on all editions, then make them grind for DLC ops, there are plenty of them. 
---
It's on sale on chrono.gg, that might be why.
---
Or OP is a Caveira god.
---
yeah ‘twas a typo 
---
Shall we go place some evil eyes?
---
flair checks out
---
Also agree.  500ish bullets would give him the ability hold down an area for a good while. 
---
Where is that money being spent? 
---
"cOnSoLe DiAmOnDs = Pc CoPpErS" 
---
We dont know either 
---
People will lean and crouch spam in casual
---
It may be because of team coordination of gold ranks
---
Ah, thanks for clarification.
---
Tactical realism mode and holding fuzes gadget as for when Fuze is there it's a trade secret
---
5 adults gang rape a german boy
---
Very mature stuff man thanks

That's insane
---
My clip is from console. 
---
It's what happens when you fuze right above a vent
---
Indeed, like I said, I haven’t really played against a sweaty 5 stack of plats before so this might be a common occurrence
---
No it's not,i checked,and that is called tea bagging.
---
Lonzo is shooting 32.3% on jump shots this year. He is shooting 41.7% from the line. That makes him a bad shooter. How Fultz or Brown is shooting has nothing to do with Lonzo.

Pretty sure the the drone took most of the aoe damage
---
If they made him a 2speed 2armor and made it a lot faster to place and pick up his turret he would be a lot better than he is now
---
Hot 
---
He would still be stationary in a game about moving a lot 
---
Edit: didn't show the end of last game I guess. But it was not with them 
---
No one wants to play against or with a plat/daimond in casual. Most of the time your buttcheeks will be clapped. No one wants to go through that. In casual it's just how ppl are. Casual is trash and it's a joke. I hate it. I can only play ranked and T hunt now.
---
Imagine if this was a diamond ranked
---
Or they could delete his turret and make him just have an LMG as a primary, then he never has to be stationary. And he is instantly mobile and performs the same role as he currently does, lane denial 
---
Nice, now we can eat *our* puffs
---
forever
---
Yeah I’ve been looking at the Razer keyboards but man are they expensive 
---
fucking *HOW*
---
What would his new gadget be?
---
Indeed, that would make more sense in a r6s context.
---
Vigil is very sexy
---
I'm not totally sure if this was skill or just wild spraying.
---
You will be banned my dude .... I feel sorry for you 
---
Twitch Elite and Valk Elite can help you get a competitive advantage. The gadgets blend in better. Other than that nothing will influence the game in terms of advantage so buy anything you think looks cool. 
---
Well, no-one can really do anything about this so bad luck I guess.
---
You think you missed but actually you’ll hit the target...... eventually.
---
Ikr he a thic boi 
---
Bipod, lowers recoil but it’s significantly faster to attach and detach, giving him mobility that he doesn’t have. (It would look dumb if he put down his turret in half a second and put it back up just as fast)
---
Nice video, but can I get that questions help?
---
Wild spraying....
---
So where is the Vigi- 
---
***Oh, I get it.*** 
---
Which question
---
M/k isn’t that used on console for the sole fact that most xims are expensive or have added input lag. However, I do agree that it is an issue that every developer needs to address.
---
yeeeeeeeeeeah,i like thicc boys like maestro,rook and vigil.vigil is thicc af
---
Occasionally they will have like double renown weekends
---
Is this on Xbox? 
---
Can't siege themselves do shit about this, all I get is spam messages from these kids the whole game and team kills for what. Taking lesion? No they chose other ops. I think siege needs to be able to do stuff about this 
---
I completely agree with that.
---
..............
---
They really should nerf turn rate when the shield is pushed away
---
No mic is probably why
---
I bet that bandit hopped out into that claymore smh 
---
"And the rando just randomly TKed our dock".
---
See there's the problem. It started with a random intentional team killing which is what needs to be stopped. Also, what you are describing (4 players with one jerk) is what vote kicking is for.
---
...............................................
---
But, they were all in party chat and only came out after like 2 rounds of straight killing 
---
It’s because x box are a bunch of liberal sjws who are afraid of offending a soul 
---
All the problems that he has now are still there. Grenades and what not would still be a problem, but he can't exactly carry around an ADS with him, can he? His turret will probably still be too noisy to roam with, and keeping it on site is part of the predictablity problem. If they lower the noise on it, too, it's might as well be the bipod that everyone else is talking about.
---
Smart
---
This happens to me when i play ranked and it's on Consulate.
---
Idt you can vote to kick in console ranked
---
It's not inconsequential to me, ok :(
---
Maestro = fun
---
Try contacting ubisoft support 
---
Well since the mp5 is getting nerfed, it might be time to start using it 
---
#DRUGS
---
I'm in the process of writing up a revised list with the reasoning behind every operators placement based on their pros and cons. Keep an eye out for it. I'll send a reply to this post with the link to it when I'm done.
---
Cobalt, bcs blue.
---
Of course they do! :)
---
That's 25,000 for all base game operators. That's the same as one DLC operator. Ubisoft estimates that you will earn 25k renown every 30 hours of gameplay, if you play R6S for 2.5 hours a day (which I did the starter weeks), you could unlock every single operator, minus the attachments, within 2 weeks.
---
Lol it’s okay, I would agree with you if there was a story, but it’s just multiplayer in this one
---
How do I record gameplay of R6 and post it here from a ps4
---
Through it at the ceiling of the trim your entering so it falls straight down. I use her as a fragger when I’m lucky enough to get in a good lobby.
---
Can confirm
---
Not having any counters isn't a bad thing by itself just look at Doc, Rook, Caveira, Sledge, Buck, IQ, and Capitao they all have no counters but they're perfectly fine.
---
Edit: Blackbeard too

Hello VultranTv, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ai1318/deagle_only_lets_go/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Also you can see the difference in recoil haha. Lucky clip tho ggs
---
Yeah I know but I enjoy the bios tbh.
---
The term monkey only carries racist connotations if its directed towards a black person. I call people chimps or monkies when they mess up. Or I might declare someone woh is angry is "Chimping" out, much like how chimps freak out. It's all about that sweet sweet context.
---
It would look dumb but it would give him the mobility that he needs without changing who he is
---
You could make a religion out of this.
---
Yeah they should...
---
They just won't
---
Kinda like alibi but for sound not sight. What if the op could press a button to remotely trigger it? Putting something on repeat might make it too obvious. A bunch of different sounds you could toggle through plus a 10 sec alarm to cover sound would be cool. 
---
This was actually how the game managed seasonal operators at the beginning of the first full season back in 2016. 
---
These digital add ons are what you can call "unlocks" the game already has the content installed but in order for it to appear you must have individual add ons installed. At that time if you had the season pass or any year one edition bundle you would receive frost and buck through the season pass but only by having each unlock add on downloaded. After time they just incorporated the unlock feature with a season pass add on. 
---
Notice that you will see the temp_bonus and extra daily challenges, perm renown boost, dlc operator one (buck) etc. These were individual unlocks of the year one pass. 
---
It is useless now but because you have the content purchased the Liscense remains on your account. 
---
Funny how they market this game as a competitive shooter and strategies are developed based on how inconsistent and unreliable the mechanics are
---
This is why "memetubers" actively make this game worse
---
It's casual so they probably don't care
---
If I see an opportunity I take it
---
Fuze 
---
Like turning it into a minigun for suppressive fire?
---
You know, besides shooting him in his dumb face when he peaks through his mav hole. Or throw a c4 through.
---
Found the noob
---
You make a good point. Who would you rearrange with that in mind?? I'm in the process of doing a revised list with an explanation as to why I put each operator in their position. I've just started defenders so you got me at the right time.
---
I play on both xbox and pc and what i said goes for both
---
How is it a 1v1 when the entire defending team got killed without a single attacker dead in the kill log. What
---
That would be a much better idea than mine, and I do agree with there’s usually not a lot of places (except house or plane), and it would be better for the rooms that you can completely reinforce 
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Awesome ace bud hopefully more can follow
---
I post wasn’t for a lesion nerf.
---
 Only in a casual
---
You don’t need to win them to get a rank when I first played ranked I lost all of my games and got copper or bronze. So you can throw the games if you want to try work your way up from copper
---
He makes it work
---
Liscense / game sharing can only be done mutually between accounts with the content. You can game share only the account you purchased the content on with someone else and vise versa. If they have your xbox account that has the year one content attached to their xbox and have it set as their home xbox then they can access the content. If you have further issues i suggest contacting xbox support. 
---
16 - 3. Still lost.
---
Of course,fellow Maestro main!
---
I think it's safe to say that most people who are willing to communicate can speak English as well (even though it's not their native language, like me and my friends)
---
Honestly though
---
Just disable the aim assist and it helps after a while. Especially when learning the recoil of a specific weapon
---
is
---
Fucking finally. Now get over it.
---
The fact that it's a roaming defender team really got me.
---
I'm aware 
---
The interrogation happened during late game 
---
Try a DDU driver uninstall, and reinstall the latest driver for your 1060. 
---
Buff the sausage and make him 3 speed *immediately becomes overpowered*
---
Dude kaid lost his third RTILA . Bugisoft made this opp to electrifiying hatches . So he can electrify only to hatches which make him useless against thatcher . Also an smg with 700 rmp and only 27 damage it is the weakest gun in the game . KAID seriously need a huge buff .
---
sorry but it's hard not to talk about how sexy he is
---
Doc and Rook are completely negated by headshots.   
---
Sledge and Buck are both pretty much countered by reinforcements (except floors/ ceiling)   
---
Cav is a ton less viable against coordinated teams.   
---
The problem I have with Maverick is that when he starts popping multiple holes across multiple walls (exterior walls specifically), it becomes impossible to guess which hole he’ll peek.  And when they can drone the objective so he’ll know right where to look, it’s like playing whack-a-mole, but the mole has an assault rifle and knows right where you’re standing.  For me, the argument “just shoot him through his hole” is equivalent to “just stand still” with lion.  I don’t know how to fix this issue though.  If you make mute and/or Bandit a counter then he’s basically just a worse thermite.
---
Best I got was 24-1-3
---
not the point of the this post. we all know siege isnt about points. No need to cape for some random toxic shitter
---
Mav is not OP rn
---
 Expect House isn’t in ranked and is a bad map
---
I've been feeling It as well even in cases where everyones ping is at a reasonable rate. A lot of getting killed behind cover or watching a killcam where someone  sees me for ages while on my screen it looks like I got prefired around a corner. Servers are stressed or something. 
---
On Border the guy yelling repeatedly says that
---
I don't think any company has xim detection right now because if they find a way to detect it they just update it again so they can't anymore.
---
Tier list in siege are never really accurate because almost ever operator is situational
---
When do they start?
---
He fires his turret from an under barrel grenade launcher like most gadgets seem to now
---
If it gets over the estimated back out and start again, it’s not that hard

I know that ofc. In this ridiculous case yes. But when u r fighting 1v1 against shield with some pressure from elsewhere and they pull this shit? Thats fucking annoying. There are more bs with shields that at least this should be nerfed
---
I agree with what you say about Mira so I'll make some adjustments, however this list is intended for new players getting into ranked or mid-elo players who just want to know what is working in the meta. Everything is situational but it's just to give an idea about what you can safe-pick and what is more niche.
---
No no. 
---
Your friend must have access to your own account - the one you have your content purchased on. They must sign into your account on their xbox and then they must set your account as "home xbox" in the settings. From there they then can share your game content. 
---
You cant share it to another spare account on your console and allow them to sign into that account as thats not how it works. 
---
Just report them, vote to kick and move on. Don’t add more toxicity into the game.
---
This assumes the enemy team removes the brain from their skull and smashes it with a sledgehammer. Anyone not retarded will ask their teammate for a nade or just destroy the shield from a good angle then peak while pre firing.
---
Just trying to give new ranked players an outline of what's working in the meta and what is more situational to what is not viable.

Just because people aren't making posts about removing all frag and impact grenades in the game does not mean they're not there.

Just because people aren't making posts about deleting all the maps but plane does not mean they're not there.

Just because people aren't making posts about wanting an operator whose ability is to instantly kill everyone on the enemy team does not mean they're not there.

An interesting buff would be to make his bullet-proof helmet actually bullet proof (even if for only so much damage like Blackbeards shield). then they could take the stupid shield away and people would have to stop relying on headshots for everything

ill try it thanks

Shit quality does not excuse shit behavior.  You are putting your person enjoyment of griefing others above them being able to enjoy a game they paid money for.  
---
Ash should be nerfed, but not directly. Simply fixing crouch and lean spam, and she will be fine. 
---
Nope

It’s not a huge nerf for me, I’ll just go for the head more, we will see how it works out. 
---
They’re just bottled up emotions.
---
Flash is overall best choice, but comp is good if you tend to full auto for a long period of time, and muzzle if you tap alit. Flash is a bit of everything
---
My favourite show and my favourite game. Oh my.

Thank you for explaining:)

Well it loolks like you aint one as well  Dusty the frost main how do you understand
---
That scared the shit out of me
---
The most accurate thing I've seen all day
---
100 people in a subreddit of 500k isn't a lot 
---
Well they wasted a lot of it on the outbreak event
---
There’s a sub for art, they post here because it gets more attention, moderation is okay but the phone walls paper Shit or the art with slight photoshop done to it are annoying 
---
Currently, the whole game is basically Alpha quality.  Beta is for stress testing and finding obscure and hard to trigger bugs before final release.  Current bugs are consistent, easy to trigger, and well known.  Their refusal to even acknowledge that they are that and assure us they have a tentative timeline on fixing them is what shows their real lack of professionalism.  By choice or skill, they are not able to handle this game.  The lack of any feedback from Ubisoft says choice.
---
I tried searching for your "friend" and couldn't find them. A proper link is appreciated.
---
Amen
---
Well good job for turning a 2v5 into a 1v1
---
U right
---
Missing the legendary mp5 skin
---
Thank you ! :D
---
How the fuck do you get to live so long, The first melee on me would go through my shield and kill me.
---
15 seconds for attackers is enough. Great idea. 
---
Exactly. It's frustrating to know these are the people dominating the high ranks of console, and the only thing you can do is just try your best. Cheating for him in this case did not work out for him.
---
It can help . Getting used to recoil of the operators you like using. 
---
Gotcha
---
Lmao 😂😂😂
---
Reminds me of a Metro character
---
There's a reason most games don't support mouse and key.
---
I added in higher times bc it might be a good idea for larger maps such as tower
---
If you go around doing that in real life than you are probably single
---
This is me when I play echo 
---
I check it religiously
---
Maybe ask Ubisoft 
---
I hate seeing cav being played by a rando, they always die, exept that 1 time the cav, ran out, interrogated 1 dude then procedded  to kill the other 4 before they even got inside, we lost that game 
---
884 Ubiclub hours or 884 Steam hours?
---
Also sorry if some things don’t make sense English isn’t my first language.
---
I’ll agree to the fact that the sprays etc are pointless in overwatch loot boxes however at a much faster rate of getting the loot boxes than siege plus 4 item over 1 per loot boxes your bound to wind up with better shit than siege in a way faster time is my argument. It’s probably just my bad luck but I have close to 1500 hours in the game between two different platforms with only 3 legendary items from alpha packs to show for it not very rewarding or exciting. 
---
Also like I said in the post before the starter edition and right before they made all base ops and attachments free for everyone who didn’t have them the base game was $20 they raised $20 more to $40 with the release of starter and the changes which to me was flat crooked
---
Anywho thanks for taking the time to read and reply to my long ass rant I don’t expect change I just felt like I needed to get it all out there and see if maybe I’m just salty or if the community sees it how I see it :)
---
Macros bro

The only benefit is you save your KD. I'd say just try and make a comeback over surrendering though. 
---
It saves time 
---
When you were slacking off at work but you peripherally see your boss looking....
---
Just leave the game when you get a team?
---
With surrendering, you don’t loose k/d, just mmr
---
His gun has the real fire rate of the dp28 but the recoil needs to be down graded, pack more of a punch, be able to lean and dismount it
---
I'm printing a Yokai drone the exact moment I'm typing this ( I'm doing it in separate parts so on Saturday or Sunday I will post the complete drone)
---
But did you have help from other people or did you do it on your own?
---
Have you done any others? I would really like to see Caveira and Jackal. Again, really love the art style.
---
Try help your team as much as possible until match point, then just leave, you’ll have to get the penalty for leaving but it’s the only fair way on everyone else
---
101% correct, good sir. You got me beat.
---
I play on EUS on Xbox  and I actually may try that. I’ve gotten some good advice from everyone but I think your advice may be the best so far. 
---
His HP makes me angry.

Reverse card

I just see corgis. I have a corgi and play R6 so I like this. 
---
Reverse card (you didn’t see anything bet)

I didn't even noticed D:

nice

near start of year 2 i think
---
At long range things a fucking meme machine with an acog, trick is two round bursts if youre unsure of the headshot. 
---
No, my friend was like a low level so I was using controller against him so he kinda had an advantage I guess
---
check your most recent post
---
Uno ?

Onu

Carbine AR.

How do I be luck?
---
This is the web shit rainbow doesnt need lol 
---
You can under estimate that old man strength if you want...
---
u ok fam?
---
Frost for me. I have a soft spot for her shotgun, plus it's always satisfying to nab someone with a Welcome Mat where they least expect it. 
---
(On a PC standpoint)
---
Kaid for denying hard breachers and drones with the barbed wire. He's an Anchor with a good gadget but subpar guns. His TCSG Slug Shotgun, however, is hella fun to use (but console recoil for that gun is still broken from what I've heard)
---
Frost for roaming and fucking over rushing Ashes and Blitz's with her Welcome Mats. Her guns are heeelllaa fun to use, both the Sterling SMG and the Super 90 shotgun. If you have good map knowledge, maybe Frost is for you.
---
But of course, personal preference is personal preference. Have at it with whatever op you wanna buy.
---
r/woooosh
---
And we traded afterward xD
---
And also totes a LMG
---
God dammit Sam
---
Sorry, but
---
n o  t h a n k  y o u
---
Just don't get flashed lol
---
I honestly feel bad. I made the mistake of purchasing the starter edition first. I had no idea what I was in for. Eventually I just bought the advanced edition.
---
Siege is not in a poor state, every game has it's faults, but siege is relatively ironed out.
---
I know, the bullet just looks like it is in the death cam
---
How is this furry? And why are furries stupid?
---
Its weird seeing all your videos but never seeing your Toothless poster and plushie, its cute tbh. is he like your good luck charm? 
---
LMG. MOUNTED. AND LOADED.
---
He'd be able to move a lot quicker and be less likely to be detected.
---
It's a rifle IRL, but in game it's designated as a SMG and I don't understand why. 
---
this remembers me all that cat art that was done a couple of years ago , awesome too.

It's a carbine, but [the Korean Army calls in an SMG](http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=4089). I heard it was supposed to be a replacement to the M3 Grease Gun, so maybe that's why the SMG term stuck.
---
"Heck no."
---
-Engi
---
U win
---
It's called "Ubisoft doesn't know hit registration".
---
Damn that shit good 
---
Gg

No it really doesn't. The bullet goes like a foot above her head.

OH LAWD HE COMIN
