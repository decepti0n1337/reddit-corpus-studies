Not once. These aren't the first they've used, these won't be the last.

Unmanned laser car drone batteries
---
Global warming isn't fucking around
---
It was a good while ago so I don't know if it could still happen
---
Yes that would be frustrating but clash in a 1v1 is ez
---
Where's your proof? They already started they can't add any new weapons to the game.
---
console?
---
It does, a contact us link
---
The primary difference that I've read and watched (from the Ubisoft article and teaser) is that he can counter capitao bolts.
---
High caliber sniper is something I’ve been wanting for a while and I’m glad it’s becoming a reality
---
Yep exactly I used to solo que full try hard got to plat 3. Started to get repetitive, now my friends and I run at the enemies holding live grenades or lock ourselves outside as defenders lol. Not in ranked tho, wouldn’t wanna ruin anyone else’s game
---
That cool
---
Wait... Then how u lean with prisma in hand?
---
definitely something i didn't think about. worth a shot.
---
You have to wait until NEXT SEASON to fix an ICON? Lazy fuckin bums
---
Damn we haven't had a light blue in 3 years since Buck and Frost, This is fitting for the new DLC name too.
---
It looks like fanfiber made that holy. Nice work.
---
I can agree that most of the skins you see in shops are terrible.
---
About price of Elites - It's kinda the same price as for 'Legendary' skins in many other games, I think.
---

---
In LoL you did need to spent similar or almost the same amount for legendary skin.
---
In Pubg devs were not afraid of releasing 30$ halloween skin.
---
But I get your point.
---
Keep in mind that you can sometimes drop 'legendary' skin that can not be seen in lobby. Those skins look good, especially weapon ones. 
---
'Epic' skins like 'BI' are also one of the best looking skins in the game. 
---
I myself don't like most of MVP animations on elite skins. I find them cringy(eg Mira, Pulse).
---
Black water skin
---
Thank you
---
That's unfortunate comrade your right life could be worse. Sorry for your misfortune:(
---
when is the reveal
---
The right one is clearly the Indian. He reached transcendence so he isn’t bound to the earth anymore and starts levitating. Maybe the operator is very religious and compared with his Magnet gadget it could fit him.
---
The left one is a bird with 3 eyes. The new operator has a sniper (maybe with extra zoom) I think you can imagine what that means.
---
Now that's something worth dying for
---
😉
---
It creeps me out just imagining I had to hold a flesh covered gun or uniform lol I like it though.
---
 mostly bullshit whenever i played it but sure
---
Not sure I'll look.
---
Spotted the copper
---
There were only two universal skins. Very pretty though.
---
I'm glad night maps were removed from ranked and casual, it adds nothing to a competitive FPS and only makes the experience worse. PvE is where they belong.
---
I held F and i am still alive
---
That was a Kobe and a yeet in one, forbidden technique right there
---
I think I might not conveyed my issues clearly here. I've got no problem with losing. I'm not really bothered about rank and elo. It's just that in a mode based on sbmm I get absolutely shit on by someone with four times as much game knowledge, sense and skill that it sucks the fun out of it
---
The bit about not undoing changes is so true. They ruined both Blitz and Glaz because they're too fucking proud of their changes to just Ctrl-Z them.
---
I can’t ! I physically can not calm myself !
---
Trolling attack was kinda fun, it was not fun getting those kills as an attacker. I thought the map/voiceover was a bit lacklustre, good concept with okay execution.
---
Wait I’m confused are you talking about when they gave unique names to the gadgets
---
What if i give u upvotes ? Will that help ?
---
Yeah and having a gun like the AWP that can one shot someone would be pretty OP
---
No, we were talking about gadget Icons
---
I think that if they want to transfer to the new generation of consoles they'll *need* a new engine. GTAV is one of the only games I know of that actually nailed the transition from X360/PS3 to X1/PS4 and PC, and even then it wasn't perfect.
---
&gt;Bro you wouldn't call a gun godess
---
I NEVER said the gun is a goddess. I said the "ability" **COULD** be named after Kali, since Kali symbolises "power, time, creation and destruction". So it could very much be the Lance, since the Lance is also named L-VEL, "vel" being the divine spear in Hindu mythology, also named so in the south Indian language of Tamil.
---
&gt;BTW This is Wamaii and Kormora even said he's called Wamaii so she has to be called Kali the rifle is the CSXR-300 like Mira stated it's not called the Kali gadget.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dt03ny/new_operator_posted_by_kormora/
---
I read that. I also linked you the video. The video literally says "Kali gadget", but ubi removed that segment it on the video released on their YouTube channel. So unless it was an initial messup by them that they want to cover up, it's highly likely that the gadget name **COULD**, mind you, **COULD**, be the "Kali gadget".
---
And this discussion is about about Kali. For Wamai, it was clear. Mag-NET and that's it. For this lady, we aren't sure because the video said otherwise.
---
Yea, of course, for the cars in the building. Makes sense in respect to the gameplay for sure
---
He is so fucked hey 😂😂 between him and twitches F2 it’s nearly impossible 😂
---
My brains not working right now so I’m just gonna agree with you
---
Lol
---
Thatcher isn't a must pick
---
Yeah it was okay if you had to rotate down even if they held stairs. The only other rotate up was the ladder in garage but it wasn't that useful.
---
The three comments on this post are the most  divided shit i've ever read
---
This is wholesome
---
No she just hit her elbow on the side of the table
---
I think so, I haven’t had them on in so long lol. But they did help me
---
Same thing happens if you rappel and someone walks in front (unless it’s clash)
---
I can't count the amount of times I died to an attacker holding an angle from outside in this week alone on my hands.
---
Nothing wrong with two snipers, just would like Glaz to be given the rework people have wanted FOR YEARS. Ubi couldn't give a shit what the community wants, though.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
He has tachankas entire gadget as his primary, except his mobile with better firerate and an acog. Literally. Better. Don't forget, as you mentioned, he also gets two very useful cams and a breaching secondary. Direct upgrade bruh.  
---
Yes, there are 0 games that have 100 percent balance. What's extremely stupid that invalidates that argument, is despite not being perfect; you should always strive for greatness. A game like CS:GO is incredibly well balanced and oiled, and only faces unbalance on certain maps. This is where the basic game feature of a map queue system comes from, and why it is present in many games such as CS:GO, Overwatch, War Thunder, etc. 
---
\*\*YOU CANNOT USE NO GAME IS PERFECT AS AN EXCUSE TO NOT TRY TO BETTER YOUR GAME\*\*
---
\^\^Cannot stress the importance of that enough.
---
That is a lie. New content doesn't equal success, as usually the new content is shit. This game will go under with or without new content, the only thing that can prevent that is if they started focusing on fixing the game and it's problems rather than creating more.
---
I am capable of grinding for ops, but a new player is either forced to wait until level 70-80 to play ranked or buy many of the necessary ops.
---
You noticed that? You notice how I prove them wrong? I actively respond to each and every response because I am looking for someone to prove me wrong. I have facts upon facts upon facts of this games many bugs, inbalances, and overall problems. It's fun to see people try and argue with logic and reasoning over actual facts.
---
Don't be dense; nobody's "replaced". 
---
Jäger destroys/can't stop Capitão bolts/runs out of ammo. Wamai intercepts and localizes the object, probably highly effective at containing Fuze charges, may captures Cap bolts (based on a leak).
---
Kali's gadget mechanically burrows in and locally destroys reinforced wall countermeasures, does *not* create a traversible breach. Probably leaves a minor murderhole like a single Maverick puff/Fuze hole. Her rifle appears to make a non-traversable hole in softwalls similar to Glaz's rifle or a BOSG/TCSG12. Probably breaks hatches. Makes big holes in bad guys.
---
We have no idea how big the hole is however it is fired by a sniper rifle that puts massive holes in walls already so it is a murder hole made by a possible one shot capable weapon and the only other operator that can breach a electrified wall is maverick who has to be up against it and is electrocuted while doing it and I really don't see where you are getting this thatcher thing from.
---
Dude, I got the final kill with him and watching the kill cam was so embarrassing lol bullets everywhere 😂
---
[removed]
---
Tbh the ideas arent that outlandish, and even me and my friends have thrown around the idea of there being operators that are very simmiler to the new ones.
---
Sandy’s a girl?
---
I mean It had its flaws but I'd say maybe in my top 3
---
Legit it’s so much worse on ps4 Imo! Pc is so much easier to contain recoil
---
JNG-90 maybe?
---
It has *some* notes of a JNG-90
---
I think I'm one of only a few people that actually like tower. I just love the setting of it and aside from it being a massive map it's usually enjoyable to flank for me.
---
I’m still super new to the game but him anar Kapkan are my faves
---
Supercharged wall
---
The angle grip has less horizontal recoil on ela smg. Commonly used attachments us angle grip with comp or break
---
Could be alloy core.
---
I agree with that to a certain extent, as I enjoyed playing to buy new ops for 500-2k renown when I first started. However, will how necessary many DLC ops are and how expensive they are, it's a completely different story. The fact of the matter is, Siege as an identity crisis; It can't decide if players should have to grind/pay for ops like in a casual game, or if they should have them from the start like in a competitive game.
---
i used to play on ps4 and i use bucks dmr cause the recoil was wild but now im on pc and the c8 is like a laser beam for me
---
Indeed
---
Park in land
---
It’s possible but I think I saw somewhere new ops are in development for 9 months
---
Bad luck
---
Forget what tournament I watched but the commentators talked about some like the reflex because it gives better peripherals. Some like the holo because you get a clear sight picture. It also feels like you get like a .2 zoom.
---
No, because you would have to go from shooting at prime level to kill a dog to having to go back to head height to kill someone
---
And I mean I don’t think anyone wants to kill a dog
---
I am the same with the f2 ps4 I have the worst sin with the gun but on pc my kd for the gun is 1.8
---
I was more making a joke about the game mode that came out for air fluff one.
---
HOW IN THE HELL U DONT HAVE ANY RECOIL. PLUS U ARE USING ANGLED GRIP WHICH MAKES IT WORSE HOW
---
loin
---
Yeah, felt odd they upload the same video but only make one version for Europeans and one for Americans even though it's the same video
---
🔴 gang
---
I like the setting too, just the map confuses me
---
It really comes down to personal preference. I like the holographic more because all you need to do is point with the dot in the circle. With the reflex you need to aim with the top of the triangle which feels weird for me.
---
Hype
---
Sniper main 😬
---
The softwall was hit by her gun. Likely does to softwalls what a BOSG/TCSG12/OTs-03 does, but in more spectacular and uniform fashion. 
---
The reinforcement was hit by her underbarrel launcher, not "a sniper rifle". Of course I don't know anymore than the video showed and Ubi's written, but her anti-countermeasure gadget is based on the same principle of plenty of special-purpose explosive AP munitions that exist in real life - meant to penetrate the hard part and destroy stuff on the other side.
---

"I'm controlling R6 with a Gameboy.... So we're hopping straight to ranked"
---
I completely agree. Although these players might be too unskilled for you, they were owning me left and right. If I had shown the score board you would see I was 1-4 before this nice team wipe. I decided to try Fuze to practice his abilities against pIayers better than me. I honestly didn’t even know I had gotten the kills until the feed showed up
---
No, theirs is a muted blue colour. When I say grey, I mean the one in the actual picture. I don't think it will actually be grey, but I would like it if it was.
---
r/awardspeechedits
---
You're over-complicating what it actually takes to win. You only need a couple of specific ops to be competitive at a high lvl. What allows you to win games is game knowledge and aim, neither of which have anything to do with ubisoft's design decisions.
---
By the time you're even at a level where mira on oregon is NEEDED to win the round you'll have almost all the operators or at least the necessary ones (such as mira).
---
Almost every online FPS have unlock progression, hell siege even required you buy weapon attachments but they took that out, they're so selfish.
---
Also Chanka rework is happening, so that argument kinda falls apart right there.
---
There are some things even flex seal can't fix.

From what i've heard, all of the event that Ubi has made are all really good, they each have their own flaws but they are still good. Ubi should release more events more often
---
Why was half your team walking around that window?
---
Afaik it has a range limit and cant scan beyond that, but he can still see the footprints. And rapelling from a window generally doesn't allow you to scan a mid ranged footprint that you see. You'd have to have been really close ti the window.
---

It’s because of engine limitations, obviously. ^/s

You underestimate flex seal

What's that up there?

On contraire I never said anything about flex tape 😎😎😎
---
in fact, i expect that with the new sniper op, they might actually include a glaz buff to give some competition for this new op
---
Black ice sasg lucky bastard that’s all i want in life

Later virgins.

Stop using a potato as a router

Yoooooooooo dope

Me too, only discovered it when I did this. Might be useful for getting a pesky defender that's hiding behind there!
---
obv not. Closet cheaters are worse than blatants
---
I just sit around on cams for a minute while they enter and let them get comfortable
---
Those colors were a bit brutal man Idk
---
I'm going to have to agree, rainbow is magic is my favorite
---
The gadget hits a reinforced wall and explodes. What else would it do?
---
I'm looking at it right now and it is absolutely the correct emblem, did they fix it already?
---
This would also allow Kali to focus on reinforcements in lieu of Thatcher.   
---
  
---
***There Will be Bans***
---
Maybe it was implemented to prevent spawn killing with them 
---
I'm sure one of you autists could figure out the exact angle you would have to throw an impact grenade through a specific window to kill attackers as they spawn/leaving spawn. 
---
Having the grenade do little damage if thrown far prevents this.
---
Why make a new comment instead of replying.
---
Imagine letting the timer run for a half an hour
---
Further from the point of you throwing it or from the explosion area? It very well could be a bug they don't know l about. For years, the pdw did more damage from longer distances. Take some video and send it in
---
That’s what R6 Quarantine is going to be
---
Nah its a shit map
---
There's no video
---
Wait we get snipers now?
---
off topic, but how does it say smoke main by your name?
---
I guess that would make sense. But imo the falloff is too much too quick. A direct hit from 15m is like 6 damage. Maybe they could make it so a direct hit from 50+ or even less, is next to nothing, rendering them someone useful other then just putting holes in walls. I guess?
---
What are your thoughts on clash vs new sniper? I don't think ubi will bother making her shield pierce-able.
---
Further from the point you throw it. 15m+, a direct hit is next to nothing.
---
No, that doesn't seem particularly likely. In fact, it might be more beneficial that way, so that Clash can serve as a direct counter to Kali.
---
Imagine being this bad at taking photos
---
Send it to the team
---
Won’t happen. The gun has no range and is super inconsistent. It’ll feel like they shot a blank at you.
---
Can be with a field strong enough to induce eddy currents in objects passing through it.
---
It's how they separate aluminium from other recyclables. A big rotating magnet.

Ubi looks into this because of community push but won’t give Warden impacts and P90 when everyone was asking for it. Instead we get 2 speed warden.
---
Dam it u stole my loadout lol
---
Sometimes i Alt tab for a WHOLE HOUR and THEN it would find... Its fucked up... After this HUGE queue time i join a game that is already like 2 / 1
---
I'ma bit tipsy hense me shooting my own teammate😂sorry lol
---
You messed up perhaps the most famous half jaw quote
---
Also don't mind ppl calling u names.. ¬¬
---
Impacts are for setting up the site not to use them offensively.
---
Okay so I really want this to be on defense because I know for a fact that when shifting tides comes out and they don’t buff Glaz, this op is going to replace him entirely
---
Not randombly, had my reasons...3-0 un ranked...this man started reinforcing my wall(I'm bandit)
---
I'm only kidding, this is my buddy we do this to eachother😂
---
They aren't meant for ops but rotations. Think of them as useful for clearing the DBNO status only and move on.
---
Fixed it😂sorry for spamming
---
I can relate, when I was newer to the game I didnt know this map's layout very well so I would just stay inside the building, it was a disaster. I used to think Maverick is a strong pick because he can make holes and kill me from an unexpected angle. I thought this map was so attacker-biased. 
---
But after I changed my playstyle on this map by running around and go outside to pick off attackers I am absolutely trashing them.
---
I stopped playing that game years ago, so I don't remember much about the game, but its the kind of game that you can release your stress and gun people down left and right due to its TDM nature. I'd say its a fun experience for me.
---
I run 800 DPI 33/33 83 with the multiplier, I’m pretty sure that’s lower
---
From what I understand, three things happen, due to hidden MMR ranks for casual:
---
1) they are a higher level player than you, and they haven’t played casual in a long time. Therefore, your MMR is the same in casual as theirs and unfortunately you are both paired together. 
---
2) Whoever they are immediately squaded with has an average MMR of you and whoever you are squaded with (as in if you’re a silver and three of your other friends are silver and one of your friends is a plat 2, then you will naturally be paired with higher MMR players in casual to even out the average MMR) 
---
3) your MMRs are the same because you’re of similar skill rank and they are just playing at more of a “normal” level of play for that skill rank than you’re willing to do.
---
Consider yourself lucky that they changed the BOSG iron sight before that event
---
Pretty
---
That gaget looks kinda insane though...

---
Perhaps, but when a player switches server and they become unranked their accounts basically become smurfs for the 10 placement matches, this is how it has always been. While your screenshot looks terrible, it’s how the game has always worked, the only way to solve it is to have 1 global rank instead of 3 separate ranks for each of the different regions.
---
Oh shit...

Hello strongbravehandsome, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dta441/i_hope_in_year_5_they_add_operators_to_existing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Pls ubi
---
Some of you need to understand that people can use their money however they please as long as it is within the TOS of the game.
---
Basically this sub's, unfortunately.
---
It sure will be an alternative because if i am correct they confirmed that he will be 3 armor
---
Also it will really depend on how visible gadget is for attackers and how it can be deployed. Its probably thrown (like Kaid)/shot (like Nomad) and maybe hard to notice so you don't really place it inside, but OUTSIDE the objective on entries so attackers can be blown/flashed by their own nade.
---
No clue tbh
---
Okay.. Okay. Could I just have a Frosty and a baked potato please.
---
Damn. Operation "Full Reveal" looks dope.
---
It’s still bannable on Xbox and is considered a modification to the console
---
Honestly should probably start doing that.
---
I have the LMGE mag on rooks revolver with glazes scope, and the saiga 12 silencer
---
Just pc things
---
Im hoping we get another awesome skin like black ice
---
We gonna get black water skin now that black ice melted
---
It sucks in anything gadget being thrown by the attackers (idk about drones). 
---
Nades, Flashes, Capbolts will activate like normal after getting sucked in. 
---
Just like the blog post says, if you put it near a door and an Ash, Breach chargers something inside the room and run in, she can get hit by the charge thats suck to the magnet near the door.
---
I will miss playing as peashooter
---
Eh, their ping was only 50 and very stable. Unless the other guys were lagging their asses off, shouldn’t have mattered. I’d say it’s more just them missing a few shots.
---
nah sorry i'm straight
---
Hell yeah!
---
Why is there a banana thing on ela’s non-censored icon all of a sudden? Can that please be removed.
---
IQ has a 1911 in her operator video.
---
He could have been, but they massively overbuffed the scanner range. It's not a big deal, the event was meant to be a fun distraction. Still woulda been nice. The april fools and wild west events were somewhat even.
---
i really do.
---
solid tho
---
I think it’s a magnet, so anything with metal I assume gets grabbed. Not sure what the arrows are made of, but I assume steel.
---
Yeah it was good I only played Kapkan and Frost cause those are the two outfits I wanted I ended up getting Ela’s whole fit kinda pissed ngl
---
reminds me of the days when I played payday 2 and put a scope and suppressor that are both bigger than the gun itself.
---
f
---
Where is this
---
I think they are getting back on track with the showdown and doktors curse mode. So i have hope they can make something better than outbreak in the future
---
It doesn't break the rules. It is allowed, there is just a very vocal group of players that don't like it.
---
I have ice for one of Jaeger's guns.
---
I’ve noticed considerable scarring on the shaft of my bulbous cock from all the coarse grain sandpaper I use to aggressively pump off in front of my Nana
---
cause it ended?
---
Pro settings are usually 400 Dpi 9-9-83 (just averaging it) i use 400 as well but 10-10-63. Id think 600 dpi would be too fast for me lol.
---
Too late, people already beat you to it. Nevertheless it’s a sick icon.
---
Hopefully we get some decent season skins. The recent ones were dogshit
---
Loin
---
Rip, i would reccomend some type of lotion or antiseptic cream then let it set for a day or two
---
what if you just throwed the car batteries at the attackers?
---
Ik it was a joke I have no idea what the issue is
---
I can’t, my Nana is **very** demanding
---
She has to learn to be patient.
---
That made parts of my brain feel nice
---
The defenders only choice to actually defend is to spawn peek.
---
Man this is an old one!
---
what? the operator icon that people talked about the moment they saw this trailer?
---
I mean...it’s also for the most part a real world mechanic too lol

I didnt like it tbh

I’m hoping we get a water bender as an operator

"the Mag-NET System may pose an unpredictable challenge for some of our more reckless Operators. In short, they might blow themselves up if there’s a cleverly-placed Mag-NET nearby. Not much we can do about it except encourage them to gather intel before charging in (though we both know how well that’s worked in the past)."

I can see this working against nomad as well, Throw a air jab through a window to block off a doorway but the mag charge under the window catches it and now you're blocked off.

Yeah maybe I get why people likes this mode, but for me it was just no fun at all. defending was way too hard due to Pulse, as everyone said already. I honestly just did it for the packs

you gotta understand when this came out the only hard breach was thermite, you had mute and bandit, and the only real counters to denial were thatcher and twitch

It's weird with Quarantine for me. At first I thought it was a blatant cash grab, but thinking back to Outbreak, I enjoyed the shit out of that mode, and if they can fully flesh it out it could be a solid game.

It was shit

Damn i guess climate change really is real :/
---
It’ll stick you most likely with unranked or low rank players. As you do better it will mix some higher tier in. Solo queuing for ranked sucks. And remember to pad your K/D if it’s an impossible win ex 1 vs 4. When you rank for the first time expect to be silver or lower these days. And the more you play the more it takes to rank up. Have fun. Last bit of advice is find a good group that you can queue with and have communication

unranked is a blank in this game right now. like you don't exist, because the devs coded it that way for some reason, so its only until you have a rank that the 1000 mmr thing restriction and your elo start coming into play for matchmaking

I personally thought it was really imbalanced, but I did really enjoy it. It was a super nice change of pace and actually made me jump at times because of how intense it was being a defender. A lot more great memories with friends, and that's something I'll never dismiss. Thanks Ubi!

I have thought your about your idea again and after all it is maybe not that op, but I will say that I dont want it in the game for the reason you state above. It counters someone sitting still on site wich I don’t want to se in the game.

Left one is the indian with the sniper, apparently the symbol has to do with an Hindu (I think) god who's third eye can see through and destroy evil, similarly to how the sniper can pierce through walls and kill defenders.
---
Right one is kenyan and I'm much less sure about it but apparently it's another one to do with religion, specifically meditation and I believe protection. Which correlates to the mag-net in the video.

Then again I might be completely wrong so don't take me *too* seriously

That’s not true. Xbox has a whole setting for keyboard configuration they just leave it up to the developer to decide if they want to allow it or not

Y2S2. One game away from level 190 now. Seems like forever ago.
---
My bad, i must be ashamed of myself
---
I kind of want them to release a Thatcher+ Operator. It would be really cool to get an operator that gives attackers night vision goggles and has an ability to EMP the map to affect lighting and cams for 3-5 seconds, 2-3 times. It would have to have a cooldown so spamming it wouldn't be doable. The goggles would be a pick up item, toggled on and off by default as soon as the EMP hits. Lasers would counter the goggles naturally because anything bright shined into them would blind you while wearing them, and they would give off a glow so the operator isn't completely invisible while using them. A straight up hard counter to this operator is any light source, Ela's concussion mines and reworked Mira windows with LED lights that switch on when the lights go out.
---
The defender has a one time use placeable that puts a barrier around the room it's set in that will keep outside effects like Thatchers EMP grenades or Lion drone scans from being effective in the room. It would be quite noisy, easily identifiable and it can only defend the people in the room 2-3 times before breaking and becoming unusable. A hard counter to this is any breacher, Maverick, and the new sniper who are all able to get through walls and shoot the device. Soft walls are a huge issue for this operator, as are Twitch drones and grenades. To balance it a bit, I would suggest having to shock the device 2-3 times with a Twitch drone to destroy it, as the defender only gets one.
---
Hmm

It really bugs me, I stopped playing Siege and For Honor for this reason. I feel it just pulls me out of the game at how absurd the cosmetics are. I'm not saying they shouldn't have done it because each to their own, just personally it spoils the game for me, lol.

Oh boy, you're in for a treat. Happy playing, padawan!

Near the end of Grim Sky. Sitting on a cool Plat III. After placing Gold 1 consistently since Burnt Horizon.

Remember how the hiders would try to camp in that one room where you can reinforce all the walls if they had everyone there. And have trap like littering the door and inside the room too
---
The worst part is that was when I was silver 1...
---
Carefully, he's a hero.
---
But why don’t you. Just get to the point where droning, clearing rooms, peeking first, etc; is second nature. Playing well should be your default. Most people who say “yeah I’m not trying in casual” are usually pretty ass when “trying” in ranked.
---
What? I am complaining about an unfitting Halloween mode with unfitting skins.
---
This gets funnier every time it gets reposted :\
---
I honestly didn’t enjoy it. It was just sit there, get spotted by the squad of pulses, die, repeat.its so repetitive.
---
and pulse was not the right operator for this game mode dokkabies ability would have been better imo.
---
U need to come out of copper to see wht i mean or u never played then witch one is it.?
---
Or just to know where the enemies are
---
It’s a big syringe for a big heal!
---
You would want to get scanned in prep phase so the attackers try to hunt for Vigil and waste their time doing so
---
The operator also has to have a decent weapon too.

I swear to god, they had to be bronze, if they were gold, they dont deserve to be there

Operation healt
---
The whole point of his ability isn’t to be completely unnoticeable. Not knowing where an operator is in a room is detrimental because if you peak the wrong way your toast. His ability is god tier if you know how to play him right and on top of that his load out is stacked. 3 speed with impacts aswell.

"You've Been Spotted"
---
My experience in this season was that R6tab and R6tracker are way off during placements. I had friends who according to those trackers were in plat 2 but one match later were suddenly gold 2. 
---
But as you say he now has a rank, 11 matches and 6k MMR is a lot. Highest you can start at is 3500, gaining 227 ish mmr per match is crazy.
---
I see /u/Tee_B assumption of it having to do with who you play against but that doesn't really matter. You don't just get more MMR for facing high ranked opponents, only if there is a mmr difference between your team and the enemy team. To get 227 during 11 matches you would have constantly been matched against teams ranked way higher on average. Maybe this dude got lucky and only got matched against much higher ranked opponents
---
Looking at his ranks in other regions tho I think I can start to see how he did it. Look at his Asia rank, it's literally 15 mmr... So if he queues up while unranked with 4 copper players who are around 15 mmr they will only face teams that are ranked significantly higher then them as there aren't that any legit teams that have that low of an MMR.
---
To show the math a bit. When he starts out at 3500 MMR whilst unranked and plays with 4 people with 15 mmr their average MMR per player is 712... Think about that, how many squads are available to play against with anything close to that, copper 5 is what? 1100? So say they face squads with an average of 1100, the game will give them great elo for those first matches at least. I've never been in those ranks but perhaps the system sees it as an even bigger upset because the MMR difference is especially large as a % difference? I know I've gotten 200-300 MMR when playing as a plat 1-2 squad against diamonds once or twice. 
---
He did play that 11th match and won tho, where he couldn't queue up with coppers anymore, BUT does ranked restriction take place when continuing to search between matches? Does it take you out of matchmaking? I know you can't start a search
---
Just looking at his ranks in other regions shows this guy is a rank abuser first class.
---
I wish you’d have shown the whole reply so we could see the angle he had on you.

Think about the golden rule they have had for defense a 3 speed with acog is a big no no even for two speeds goyo is the only defender who is not 3 armor who has acog but a 3 speed Ubisoft will not let one have it for a very long time
---
damn

Seeing a glaz main say that

Oh man, I remember R6 during Dust Line. So much has changed since then. Although I won't miss Blackbeard during that time.

we all know

I can tell one is glaz. Is the other mozzie or kaid?

Just wanted to point it out.

This is actually so good. Wish I could give you a gold or even a plat

I have this one guy I mostly play casual with, who follows people around as rook or doc constantly going "bonjourbonjour" or "ahhh ouioui" or just random french words as callouts, drives other players insane, I think its great lol

Barbed wire was actually nerfed from 3 hits and slowint down the attackers even more to its current state. 3 hits are just annoying esp if everything is full with it

YOU choose the maps YOU wanna play. Not Ubisoft not anyone else YOU choose to play the maps you want before you enter the que. The community won't decide anything for you. You decide yourself what you play and what maps not
---
It does what it’s supposed to be doing so everything as it should be
---
Chaket is a mixed bag, some hate it and some love it. But at least its a playable map unlike skyscraper
---
Imagine basing your argument off of the recoil chart rather than what actually happens in the game
---
A map having a ton of soft walls is okay. In fact there should be more maps like that, as this game is not CQC enough. The problem with Favela is that the objectives are directly connected to the outside, and the attackers don’t have to go through “multiple layers” of breaching to reach them. Honestly I don’t want all maps to be standardized to Villa/Coastline. This game was meant to be close quarters, but the map design just does not allow that. If they made “onion” maps with a shit ton of soft surfaces, little need for hard breaching and CQC angles, while also being well balanced, they would be fan favorites. Imagine a Pro League map where a hard breather isn’t picked every single round. That sounds like lunacy, but it would be awesome.
---
Doesn’t take away from the fact it’s been posted multiple times and this post is also very late, and you’re 1 of a small minority I’d assume

Because they will get either bored, greedy or blasted by another team

Or Jager when he forgets to place ADS
---
You're not the only one with that problem, I've been experiencing these issues as well after the Halloween Event was over, I've been running the game constantly at 80-90 FPS on low settings and now I can't even run it steadily at 60 FPS, always dropping to 40 or even 30 FPS. Haven't changed any settings, so it might have to do with the game itself, but I wouldn't quote me on that,
---
Just don’t play on console
---
prolly went on yellow
---
I play on pc
---
I do. I'll be in the middle of playing and *snap* game is closed in the blink of an eye. Really annoying. Happens at least once a day.
---
Lmao true ,he would know
---
I’m thinking that sniper is purely a gadget and won’t do much damage to people or have much ammo. It won’t be her primary gun. It’ll work a bit more like the Zofia launcher.
---
Bosg acog is a fun meme, but won’t help it’s viability. It’ll still be a meme canon, now just a easier spawn peeking meme.

Btw how do you get multiple flairs added?
---
*Facepalm
---
Someone fuze this goober
---
I don't give a crap about a few downvotes. That doesn't prove anything. If anything, your supposition demonstrates the weakness of your argument. 
---
I have extensively researched this issue. Ubisoft has decided not to support native m&amp;kb. That doesn't mean that they deem emulating controller inputs, particularly through fully licensed means, cheating.
---
That's a cute little ad hominem, but I don't care what you think. I have no expectation that anything will change your mind. I do enjoy rubbing your nose into the fact that Sony supports this use. A player can do it all day long and there isn't a damn thing Ubisoft or you can do about but cry as you are.
---
I can't tell what's outside and what the inside is.
---
Those were free
---
You think spawn peeking sucks?
---
You'll fucking _Abhore_, Run outs.
---
Defenders run out thinking they're Gods Gift To Siege and will either score 1 kill/4 kills or no kills. Or they die for their impunity. No inbetween.
---
Hipfire in R6 Siege doesn't get you anywhere because aiming down sight is so fast that in the end it wouldn't matter since you can just hip fire while aiming down sight. Accurate hipfire is only worth it if aiming down sight is slow like pre amber rise season black beard.
---
I even used laser on PDW-9 on Jackal before, it doesn't change anything since aiming down sight is so fast.

Open your task manager and look for another instance of R6 and end the task

---
Isn't your issue that it looks like a made up gun?
---
That's not how it works. As you say you've lost a game against someone who's gotten banned for cheating, but based on this screenshot you've also won a game where a player has gotten banned for cheating so they pretty much cancel each other out and you are left with only 1 point gained in total for both of these games getting rolled back. System working perfectly as intended.

We you have of gold weapon
---
Especially true yes.... But Rook is a solid choice for newer players as well that aren't super confident in their gun skill. New players should pick him for his easy gun and early utility and seasoned players should pick him for his good gun and his impacts. Not just for peeks. I play him a lot even when I'm not planning on peeking
---
White noise.

About 2 hours in the beta, then actually started playing Red Crow.

If you learn the peeks from the spawns you can turn spawn peeks into easy kills. Just get into a habit of not letting your guard down as soon as you spawn. Your always vulnerable

Well Silver 1 is average, so you're well above average. Good job.

Woah lad , i didn't mean to be that way . I am sorry if i was rude or something

No this is wrong. What you don’t to do, is ask the team which of the high ban ops is someone not gonna play 
---
“Does anyone want to play either echo, lesion, or maestro” etc. 
---
Ban off that
---
its only this sub that people change the topic of what was being discussed mid discussion. 
---
I really dont give a shit about the usefulness or practicality. at the end of the day its a game it should have features that are nice for the player. i mean fuck even arma, the defacto milsim, has weapon inspect features. like you do understand its a game right you arent actually fighting real people.

It's always the teams responsibility to ensure that their players have adequate Visa to compete. Exactly like rugby and football.

You don’t get any points passed your max rank for the season so if 3001 was your highest rank whatever you lost would only bring you back to that total. Sorry dude that’s how it works.

Now all it needs is #BOSGACOG

I know and I meant three months minus whatever has passed this season.

Most play on 4:3 it just looks stretched when you watch them because it's putting a 4:3 on a 16:9

Nice play. A pro player did this once. He clutched a 1vX on cash/CCTV on Clubhouse, one hand detonating his C4 and the other shooting a person pushing him, also with Valk.

Yea I’m getting like 11 a game. Can’t really move ranks

Ok ok I get it

nice rig 😍
---
thx!
---
Then If i move server and get placement, can I get  bout 90~80 mmr per win??
---
But not this small thing.
---
Yea for that region. It’ll be a separate ranking
---
I can't believe I started playing during Op Health, where has the time gone!
---
i cant be the only one whos a bit upset that the game went in this direction, right...? :/
---
I started around the end of burnt horizon
---
How long did it take?
---
Most comments already addressed the ways that you can avoid/reduce deaths by spawnpeekers. One more thing though: shoot out nearby outdoor cameras so defenders can’t see you coming as easily.
---
For example, if you go onto Kafe Dostoyevsky and spawn at Christmas Market, you’ll notice next to the road on your left, there is a camera that a lot of defenders use to locate attackers at spawn.
---
ah, health

Year 0 December 10th

And regular breach charges. 
---
“Fuck it. I’m breaching everything “
---
The ops better be game changing because this game is getting super stale for a year that only had 1 season with decent ops, new guns, and a new map.
---
A little before black ice
---
Decent as in high or decent as in acceptable? If the former, yes, you can just look at the possible ranks and see that most ranks are below plat 3.
---
If the latter, you're asking something completely subjective and irrelevant. That's like asking if having your last name start with M is decent: that metric doesn't relate to alphabetical order, and even if it did, it would be based solely on one's opinion anyway. Likewise, decent doesn't relate to a system designed to matchmake players because the system doesn't determine skill, and even if it did, what level is acceptable is completely opinion-based.

The game was a place of lawlessness at some point. Semi-automatic sniper shotguns, people hiding in cupboards or on shelves (god i miss that stuff), the omniscient god of destruction Pulse, shield ops that are about as inevitably lethal as a hacker because their hipfire is just that ridiculously accurate. Fun stuff
---
I too like operation Healt

I started in operation shifting tides

it really needs rework

Did they buff the pump speed?

Nope

People use 4:3 because it apparently makes Holo sights better. Not entirely sure if it’s true, but that is what I’ve heard

Ok, i was uncertain because i couldnt find anything saying that. Thanks

Started in White Noise. Brother had this game and I had kept hearing about r6s but i was a snooty dumbass back then looking down on it as an overhyped fps. Tried the game on his playstation, holy shit. 
---
One of things I’ve hated in fps games is respawns, the whole number of kills is king set up, feels like your lives are cheapened because you’re rushing for kills and camping is “evil”, so finding out it’s focused on team work, one life per round and either obj or entire team death was really refreshing and drew me in. Bought the game as soon as christmas break came around and learned maps, operators, guns, etc. Game has it’s flaws, it’s mistakes (looking at you BB and Lion) but still very much enjoyable especially with devs that actually try to fix over powered or underpowered operators. To all the developers of r6s, I know you guys get a lot of crap, especially when people get really frustrated with mechanics, so I want to tell you, THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK! You guys have shown to me that you’re always trying to balance the game, fix problems with mechanics within the game and introduce new and fun content for us to enjoy. Thank you!
---
~Signed an r6s fan
---
tl:dr-Started in white noise, game is markedly different from hallmark fps like cod and destiny. Great game even through bugs and mistakes. Thank you devs for your work!
---
👍
---
People have known about this spot but why advertise it when it's a big advantage over people who dont onow

They can change their fov, that’s why it looks different

I can be worse, I started at Grim Sky. First death was by a spawnpeeking Maestro. I still feel immense satisfaction when killing a Maestro nowadays

Top fragging and luck can be related bro.
---
Also luck is an ever changing thing so some days you may be luckier than a death row inmate who was proven innocent the hour before his execution or that old Jewish woman who said that the British and Canadians got to her consent ration camp at 11 when they were scheduled to be killed at 3 or 4 that same day, while other days you will be more unlucky than the average clone trooper trying to hit a rebel soldier at point blank. It is stupid but true.
---
Damn. 
---
That's really good.
---
Couldn’t possibly myself.
---
I member. Or when blackbeards shield had 300hp. It was a nightmare to see him "peek"
---
I would like to watch the tournament.
---
Yet you probably weren’t in game chat giving call outs or helping your team kills aren’t everything
---
I mean grim sky also want a good season for me because I just go used to the old recoil and switched over to the new so I was not doing so well.  Also do you remember the name of the guy who spawnpeeked you? That coincidentally might’ve been me
---
Happened to me too. They were pushing the hall from main stairs and that painting fucked me up just enough to give them time to get down it.
---
You can but wh stilll need players
---
Bruh you did this yourself? Incredible.
---
Clash if you have a squad . Alibi if you want to have fun . Kaid if you want to play competitive

Ok but why not use the pmm its the better Russian sidearm

Yea but Glaz is usless now so gotta make up for it by introducing a sniper op with a better ability :P
---
I’ve actually had that happen to me.
---
You have one job, Vigil.
---
I'm just bad at the game in general so I'm fine with screwing around with guns like this purely for the fun of it not to actually be successful
---
Grim sky
---
Ubi why??
---
Nah it's actually because of the spike, it caused the reload animation to happen again because the actual reload didn't happen on the first animation.
---
*drrrrr EEEEE drrrrr EEEEE*

Console siege in a nutshell
---
So what is it

I know that it's because of the ping it's just that it isn't a spike I genuinely have high ping 90% of the time, these things happen regularly for me

Looks better, actually

Every part of that was satisfying to watch.

Good job!

Apparently, green hair = Ela cosplay. Pretty damn low effort, but at least other tit is showing so have an upvote.
---
Yeah but I say this because I say way too many people play casual like it’s the end of the world, but then they come up with all this Bs about why they don’t wanna be pressured to play unranked or some other crap
---
You know it
---
It’s because the percentage is supposed to be a compensation for not getting a pack. You could also have a fixed percentage and then you either get one or not
---
It says Ash killed them all though, doesn't it? Anyway, amazing comic
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Just want to know how do u show ur main
---
No fucking way people still upvote these posts
---
You get them at the same time. 
---
If there are operators who share the same weapon, the skin applies to everyone.
---
Did they switch manufacturers? Why is their skin yellow?
---
Ok thanks! What if they don’t share the same weapon
---
I like this idea although the rental time should be a little different. Rather than 12/24 hours you should be able to rent them for 5 completed matches, this would cost the player 25% of their price in renown, and can be used twice (a total of ten matches), after you've rented them twice you can then buy the character for 50% renown less, since you've spent that on them already. The rental price however would differ based on their price but it would be 25% of the total renown cost for each use. Just an idea though, tell me what you think...
---
0/10 cosplay, and see vigil on camera
---
Yes you buy it for the gun it’s not operator specific. For example if I bought a skin for the FMG9 I would have it for every operator who has that gun.
---
Very satisfying watching that
---
Would highly disagree, Bandit, Vigil and Cavs look REALLY nice
---
Because the percentage when you don't get a pack is what you get instead of a pack entirely
---
And when you lose you get a percentage for not getting a roll
---
I don't know about that. I only know for the same weapons. 
---
For example, Warden, Smoke, and Mute share the same shotgun. Any skins for Smoke and Mute also work for Warden's shotgun.
---
why is she standing alone? where are you in the image?
---
Damn I remember being excited about the rumored operator who has floor mats that instantly down you and thinking how op theyd be
---
Any ideas when S4 actually starts?
---
Ohhh, ok. I thought if I bought like for example the Girdlock skin for a weapon, it would give it too all that had a gridlock skin

---
No it wasn’t
---
There’s no new map it’s a rework of theme park
---
Respect bro. You have been through a lot. I didn't pick the game in the beginning because I heard all the problems and lack of content it had.
---
I have to say. After 100 hours of playing. The game is pretty damn fun, it has weird or annoying people at times, but seeing how it began, it's nice to see ubisoft didn't abandon the game and the players
---
We're fight Somali pirates next season

Ya know they could also be squads in like discord that just ignore you
