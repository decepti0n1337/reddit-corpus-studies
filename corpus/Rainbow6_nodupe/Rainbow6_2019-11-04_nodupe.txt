They said it could not be done.
---
---
---
I will, but I’m just thinking cause you guys look very red
---
Pretty creative, took me like a minute to get the joke
---
ok lets look at the leavers this way: if you never leave, that leaves 9 others that can possibly leave, now since you never leave that means that only 4 of those 9 possible leavers can be in your team what this ultimately means is that the enemy team will have more leavers than your team and thus you will still be able to rank up even if every single game had 1 person leaving :)
---
What was that jiggling lol 
---
Nvm in a idiot realized right after I commented
---
Yeah, I also hope they have a big sign on their back, saying "Shoot Me"(!)
---

---
It will probably be an elite skin if they ever get one.
---
I'm sorry but does jager have an ACOG
---
The new Xbox will be backwards compatible with Xbox one, meaning that queue times won’t go down even if people buy the new Xbox.
---
Also bare in mind that you have these concerns when the game has been out for push on 5 years. I think we’re good on player count, Xbox is still plenty popular in terms of player count.
---
i only got dumb charms just like every other event since Chimera
---
So true. I would say something like “if you feel like looking away, just hold the angle for a few extra seconds than you want to” but then that’s when the enemy will come. You can’t win with this strategy
---
Why are you quitting?

Why are you so concerned about your K/D ratio?

Is it possible to learn this power?
---
What's it gonna take to get biker cav from wildlands into this game!?
---
Just a lil tip so stuff like that won't happen anymore, keep your sight on the angle you are looking at then just move your body away. So like move while aiming, it has saved me several times already
---
Fun fact: when you shoot next to their head it doesn't count as a headshot. Counterintuitive right?
---
One of these things is not like the other
---
Haha I got charms

I almost have all i wanted, full ela full bandit and other stuff from smoke, the strange thing is on my payed account i get legendarys almost always and on the second account i got every even just the charms, really suspicious, ubis working with black magic apperantly.
---
At best they would not pull out the Gus, so it would be 100 damage at best, 40 damage at worst
---
We didn’t fully catch on until the third round on attack because we had never seen this type of thing until then, and in round three we tried to rush with her but be a bit behind to get a free plant and then stop them from getting a free disable. We did TK him on defense just in case he would try something.
---
I got the Blackwood skin for 9x19vsn

I’m going to be honest, I get roughly 90 FPS on T-hunt on my PS4 with VSync turned off. So 30 FPS is staggeringly low with Vsync being off.
---
Wondering what Simon riley was doing there.
---
Ok you have a point there but so do why should we let leavers of with a 30mim cooldown when they leave a ranked before even the ban phase has ended or becuse the other team has won 2 rounds in a row becuse that is what happens this week i have had around 5 games where no one left in my team i have lost 10rankups in a row becuse of this. I think they should atleast get 1h. We can look at Counter strikes cooldown system If you leave one match 30 min if you do it again 2h then 24h then 7 days if rainbow would have a system similar like that we would have not as many leavers
---
The reason I’m quitting is I don’t have time for anymore I have to deal with a whole bunch of other stuff right now but thanks for asking

Definitely but there's tons and tons of cosmetics, and really nice ones too
---
wut, her DPS is like the 4th best and has the best firerate for a primary (?)
---
that would make sense because i didn’t hit a headshot for the kill so i was confused how i killed her with 1 bullet
---
DO NOT PORT THE HELICOPTER!!!
---
I got Frost's skin and head, which is what I wanted. Nice and lucky, which means no chance of legendaries for me in the near future!
---
No that's an operator in the new cod. You unlock him with 100 headshot kills in multiplayer I think
---
i don't necessarily have a gun preference , but it's noticeable that i play best anytime i'm using acog
---
I just got a Zofia legendary headgear and holy shit that got me hyped af. I only have 3 legendaries that arent from things like "doktors curse"
---
I have quite a lot of legendaries, I have extraordinary luck I guess lol
---
That means she is always hard af to counter ;) they never get her, and she is always easy to use.
---
I don’t like maestro’s guns except his secondary’s I’ve thought about getting him before. And zofia I like her guns and her ability, will definitely consider zofia
---
But... jiggle slurp
---
how sure are you
---
Nook
---
She’s does seem easy to use.
---
i was gonna buy maverick awhile ago , but decided to go with jackal instead . but thank you , this honestly convinces me that i should've taken maverick over jackal n makes me want to get him rather than the other two i listed .
---
dokkaebi has only dmrs, and only one has the acog. maverick has a dmr and an ar, while lion has the french shorty and dmr, and an LMG with a 50 round drum mag. i would say buy maverick if nobody is willing to play hibana, thermite, or thatcher. there’s a really cool strategy you could do with zof/ash/soft breachers and maverick. if you want more insight on lion, give me a bit i’m thinking
---
a great cosplay AND useful for winter!

ok , take all the time you need because i still haven't made a definite choice .

Love how you ping for it
---
I have had this as well. But one was uplay one was steam. Also just out of freak coincidence, on the steam one I seem to always get players level 280 plus at level 75, but on uplay at 280, I get 40s as team mates. Strange times my friend. Maybe the two are installed to two different locations? Or one is optimized by nvidia and one isnt? Check geforce experience for both installs and see if DSRs are enabled in graphics. If it is, disable it.

cmon dude its pretty obvious they wont pair MnK players and controller players together on purpose
---
no, just keep holding it and move out of the angle. Instead he looked away while keeping his body in position, leaving himself exposed. Of course, if you're exposing yourself to new angles it doesnt work, but in this case it would have prevent his death/probably resulted in a kill.
---
I really wish I knew, but i’m assuming Ben Frost.
---
But they aren't Ubi's servers. They are Microsoft's.
---
you know lions ability, and his 50 round LMG can really put the pressure onto the other team. you can use him to rush, but you HAVE to have a fast reaction if you want to know where people are, because once that scam goes off, people aim around corners. it’s a tough choice but i would say maverick overall.

difference is, CS:GO has warmup

---
But why would I decide to start cheating after not playing the game regularly over 2.5 years... I have literally nothing to gain from deciding to start cheating in a game I don't actively play.
---
Lion has really good guns but a difficult to use correctly gadget. Maverick is easy to use just know to make more than one hole. Dokk is high powered in weapons but decent in ability and utility
---
You forgot the tiny u lol
---
I actually played with them a while back and was in their party. Actually really fun people and told me all about how they hacked the system
---
I like the assault rifles on seige  not much the machine guns
---
That sounds like something somebody who’s bad at recruit would say
---
they basically help you show your mains and stuff, if you want go to the right, see "community flair", and select away!
---
What do they do to you?
---
It's literally not happening.  That is the generic "non answer" tweet reply, "we'd like to use your idea, but really you should look at official announcements for any information"
---
How is ela broke
---
Next thing you know your team losses the round
---
Same thing happened to me just now and got me a Ranked Cool-down. :/ I've only had this issue since Doktor's Curse has been out so I hope they fix it soon.
---
You make aces look easy

---
I'd be less inclined to jump through hoops for this if I had been wrongly banned for being toxic. I feel personally offended for being accused of cheating haha
---
Honestly, it's actually amazing, just some strangers feedback so don't take it to heart. The face on Thermite and Smoke seems a little weird/off putting. But each person likes it to their own taste.
---
Ah well best of luck with whatever you're doing. Have a good life!
---
Mira is just learning mira placements and playing around said miras. Isn’t necessarily hard but takes a bit
---
No shooting mozzies drones
---
Yeah if they don't have that option for console... Then the last thing I need is to go up against Macy Jay or beaulo. But reading this part of the conversation is yeah I would like to see bug fixes, limb penetration, broken hitboxes, etc. (about hitboxes, could just be me but I've been having weird hit reg lately on certain ops like Ash, Mira, IQ and blitz)
---
Thanks man, google is a lifesaver haha

OY VEY shut him down! Lol people are super fragile on reddit. You get an upvote from me pal.
---
just cause they aren't in your squad, u don't gotta kick them
---
You probably asked for the purpose of discussion, so here it is.
---
Jäger doesn't need a buff or a Nerf at the moment because he isn't a problem. He's just the only dude right now to deal with the unnecessarily large number of projectiles we have, which are integral to the game. Now 2/2 is unnecessary, but acog on a full auto on defense is a lot worse. Goyo has a semi auto acog. Not a full auto. Taking away an ads is a Nerf, which means a team that can bring around 9 flashes, 4 frags and 2 smokes will now be able to wreck you even easier. Bad changes to Jäger.
---
Castle and pulse are fine.
---
Cap isn't a fragger. He has the slowest auto on attack and isn't really frag master supreme. His issue is the gadget which doesn't change if you make him 2/2. The literal best and most balanced changes to cap would be to simply revert him to his old state because he was MUCH MUCH more balanced then. He probably will be countered by the upcoming Jäger buddy, but that's just speculation.
---
Ah, thanks. I must have missed the post about it then. 
---
Yours looks really good though.
---
*those eyes*
---
"those eyes" what about the fact their library has computers that can run siege?
---
Yeah but then everyone would know I am bad at the game
---
not only do hands block headshots if you hit their shoulder or collarbone (read: not the neck) they'll flinch and can avoid or block headshots. good times.
---
Thanks bro

That NickyDeedles guy is a hatchling in Tarkov conformed

Bomb, because it’s the most balanced due to the operators and most maps being balanced around it.

This, I want to do this so badly. It looks amazing and I know my friends would totally do this.
---
It gives kapkan a subtle advantage when you try to shoot him from behind since his shoulders are so high up.
---
How would that be a balancing issue? The enemies would have to line up perfectly, not to mention it would be trivial to have bullet penetration only for the first person hit by it.

You should try flash hider. works super good
---
Did you sensor it, or was it like that from the beginning?
---
Yeah agreed that was kind of the point of my original post. I understand obviously that "the higher you go in rank the better people are at aiming for the head" but I'm sure the percentage headshots are still not so high that ttk is irrelevant. 
---
Thanks everyone for the responses it looks like its a pure ROF thing--which tbh I didn't realize the F2 was as high as it is.  That said, as a newer player I've heard many people casually cite the F2 as an OP gun--so I found it interesting that literally every assault rifle does better body shot damage against lvl 2 armor ops (all except the MK17, the PARA 308, and the AK-74M) and roughly half of the ARs do better body shot damage against lvl 3 armor ops.

So what's your solution to this problem? Can't take away the penalty for DC'ing because if people are losing they're just going to unplug their router and are back playing in a couple minutes, it's hard to fix a problem like this but I'd rather have someone get some sort of repercussion than constantly leaving when their team is down.

For me it happens over 50% if the time since one of the last updates. Probably since the doctor's curse update. When I get to menu screen it tells me it isn't connected and I have to hope that it will connect. Also, after waiting a while on the menu or getting back to the menu after a game, same problem.
---
I'm not :(
---
I can meet you in the middle at 1v4.5
---
Mate, quit it. It’s a 1v4 and ur just being childish. There was a teamkill so it was a 1v4. Also a 5k is an ace so don’t call it a 5k

Lol. It's quite common. To avoid, I walk ADS if I feel otherwise or I get solid info that all enemies are present somewhere. Even then, exact same things happen to me.
---
Not sure its what you’re accusing them if - I live in the west coast(US) and I have shit pings and load times with the servers here.I find it easier to switch to central US servers whenever the WUS start acting up
---
It's be best if they only implemented console cross platform
---
It is
---
That’s not exactly unrealistic. Nanobots are real things and they could just be placed at a vein and when they get a signal they inject. It’s not that unrealistic and could actually work

Lately I’ve been running capitao, rook, and Kapkan. Sometimes Jager.

Maybe implement all, but leave a choice for console to either queue for cross-console only or for cross-all?

Maybe cross all for casual and non ranked modes but cross all in rank would just be so unfair to console ppl

The game became less fun for me when i am playing Ash without ACOG. It may just be me but playing without an ACOG makes me feel like im in CoD or something. On defense it's a bit different as im not "attacking". I tried other attackers but it's not the same :/ i'm the type of person that is really hyped on their loved characters and i just don't have this feeling on anyone other than Ash. Long range breaching is hella nice cuz im a lazy bish and im not willing to go up to a wall, put a charge, back up and blow it... too much work! R4C is the type of weapons i love. High fire rate and medium recoil. I just hate switching ops all the time even tho it's good to fill roles

It also means they have to sync patches, seeing as pc now gets them a week or two before console.

Is that an attachment rail at the bottom?
---
Im not a bad fuze main, but i prefer other ops
---
Oof
---
Bruh
---
Jesus your team got wrecked by lesion lmao
---
You made this Rreeaalll quick, and it looks great!!
---
So sick of balancing decisions by Ubi in general to be honest. If they put it in, no matter how unbalanced it makes it, it should be allowed and never changed. So many people have bought elite skins and other content, just for the Op to be rendered almost useless later due to "balancing". Glad was the most recent example despite his more recent buff. His special is still pretty awful in my opinion because of thermal nerfing. I think we need to just accept some operators are less played &amp; worse, and some operators are more played &amp; overall better.
---
I already main multiple it's just at the moment Kaid is in heavy use and no one else ever picks him so even though I have plenty of others I can play and enjoy, to give us the best chance to win Kaid is often a good choice
---
Your IGN sounds familiar, have you been playing unranked eu recently
---
consistent sensitivity is very important...
---
I have the glaz elite but i never use it because of how useless he is atm even with the firerate buff.
---
so did i help you?
---
i really dislike playing fragging ops despite being fairly good with them. it's just boring for me, like I'd much rather anchor and bandit trick than roam around with him, and pure fragging ops like cav vigil ash just don't have any other option so i don't like them.
---
Yeah bro
---
Well no...It feels like that but mathematically it is the other way around: the longer you hold an angle, the more likely someone is to walk in front of your cross-hair BUT that doesn't really relate to whether you hold the angle or not, the problem is most people look away without moving their body!! The longer you stand still, the more likely it is for someone to peek you, doesn't matter if your look at the door or not ;D
---
So sad they weren’t selling the hibana skin this year.
---
I could never play like that but do you
---
finka actually takes more damage, at least while boosted lol
---
Okay good to know thanks
---
reinstall the game
---
Probably
---
Just set your match making in th to bomb only with Bartlett u as the only map and article 5 arcade mode will show up
---
Nope. I wish i did. I got given the grey universal skin that is basically the same colour as all guns
---
Good. Fuck the racist dogs of HK.
---
favorites dont really matter since kaid and nomads is pretty much the best pistol in the entire gamw just because of the acog
---
ALL HAIL OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR
---
The metal stairs always fuck me up aswell. Always unlucky
---
Railings are literally the worst things in the game.  They always cock block you.
---
How about give BOSG the scope on capitão’s M249
---
They need a system like Dota where if someone leaves, the game becomes "safe to leave" and others can leave with no penalty. Or with League of Legends, if someone doesn't connect to the game within the first few minutes, your team can vote to remake and the game just ends at a draw with no loss or gain of elo.
---
Umm do you know where Australia is? Some Asian countries such as japan and the Philippians are in the same time zone as Australia and they could also just be people of Asian descent with bad WiFi in the same servers as you comrade, having played in eu servers from Canada having high ping is not often an advantage and will often be a disadvantage acctually. Also do you even know ehaa as t Asian language that is?
---
no one
---
Take a look at them
---
My god, are you just this dumb or a hypocrite?
---
I mean it may be the same technology used in the Halloween event (minus the animation), whereby she did cloak fully. 
---
I feel it’s extremely hard to balance though, so I can see why they changed it if they did actually test this. 
---
A couple of ways they could’ve balanced this —&gt;
---
- Having it invisible to eye, but always glitchy on camera feeds (like when she runs while her gadget is active). 
---
- Her footsteps are louder when the cloak is active, so you at least have an audio cue whenever she’s close and cloaked. 
---
- Long delay after uncloaking before pulling the FMG-9 back out (1.5x Maverick’s swap time for his Suri Torch). 
---
- Traps fully uncloak Nokk overall. 
---
I feel this could’ve worked this way, which is promising. The only thing is that she’d have to get a big complete rework otherwise
---
gridlock, mozzie. i like the aussies. i tried playing a game with my monitor upside down but it was too hard
---
Without a video attached? How do we even know what your aim is like
---
Lol
---
Roast all of them
---
Okay. But not because you asked
---
I would like to point a somewhat different issue that happens in similar scenarios that you pictured. I am by no means insinuating that it was you but circumstances were very similar. I was playing in a 3 stack yesterday, and in the first half (defense) one guy had ~6 kills, everyone else 3-4. The score was 1-2  and after one of us messed something up (I don't know what it was) and the guy got pissed and spent more time writing in the chat than playing. He went on a rant how he is carrying this team and without him we would have lost already (mind you the game ended at 5-4 loss, which was kind of a miracle since both he and the other random proceed to throw like mad (both had friendly fire reversion active, and just shot the three of us at the beginning of each and every round). Being toxic is by no means acceptable, but is it possible that the speaker was a non native and simply did not know what is he saying is considered rude? Among my friends it is common to call each other names after a comical situation, sometimes it slips up (as we are used to be in a 5 stack) but it never harbours any ill will. Imho best choice is to turn off the pc chat and ignore all of it, since from my experience it makes it easier to focus.

---
I’m so confused rn
---
He will make you die from laughter.
---
i will with a boxing punch to your fucking face, People love to talk mad shit not knowing im an ex boxer
---
Still cheaper than an actual acog ...
---
Why
---
I don't like red all that much but everyone seems to like it so idk. I think it's between Ruby, Cobalt, or emerald
---
🔍🧐 no flick here....
---
Is it worth? Thats on you to decide.
---
I love rainbow memes they make me laugh and smile more than the actual memes
---
Ash doesn't need it Jager, Smoke, Bandit and Vigils Bosg do though. The R4C is usable without a sight. I always preferred reflex though.
---
r/Tachanka would love this
---
You're twitching about and then you shoot him in the head. Not a flick.
---
I'm going to guess you are not familiar with random pre firing a known high traffic area every time you come across it.. I play xbox and that is a live capture, so if I was cheating you would see my cheats. I pre fire doors all the time when I'm use to enemies being on the other side. Simple map knowledge my dude.
---
r/OxygenNotIncluded
---
Well I meant out of all the content micro-transactions
---
im meming dude
---
not really, i was shooting next to the bomb and he peeked up and i flicked over to him and shot him in the head, it wasnt like i shot before he got there so hows that twitching lol
---
Emerald is cool but imo it doesnt fit well. Maybe with caveira or somebody with a lot of green.
---
Mostly attacking kayaks, mute makes the sight impenetrable.
---
Cobalt doesnt stand out that much
---
Lmao I'd brake my monitor if that happened to me
---
There is no Crown so it can't be legendary.
---
So I have noticed no matter who you use and/or the weapon you use ( not talking about shotguns, the hoopla is too unreliable to count on them) it always ends in a down and a headshot. Had a few customs with the boys and the only thing we could come up with is. Stay off canter. So no straight up and down and be the aggressor, the guys that had time to Pie our the room and figure where the Opp was, took it almost every time. Again. Not a professional by any means of the term. But having that small advantage of them not knowing where you are will help. And yeah. Try to shoot em in the mouth (head shot) too. To count on damage fall off and recoil too unreliable. 
---
My $0.02
---
I bought the gemstone bundle so idk.
---
I'm assuming that's good
---
More than likely that's what happened. Your MMR changes even throughout your placements.
---
Mostly attacking Kayaks.
---
Drugs.
---
Don’t mind the coppers hating in the comments, nice shot OP! Very impressive gunplay on a controller
---
I kind seem to find the bundle? Can you show me where it is?
---
That's also my most troubling site. I try to go for some vertical gameplay with hatches or soft breaching the floor above site. Also if that doesn't suite your play style then I recommend pushing site level from floating docks.
---
It's better than what it used to be like. You gotta get used to it. Just don't use a ACOG til you get used to it.
---
The ordering is interesting. A shame there isn't two more blue ops and 2 less yellows to satisfy me more.
---
ok. youre bad.
---
100% skill. TOTALLY NOT LUCK.
---
Sorry bud, he isn't being toxic, but since you aren't understanding and he keeps trying to explain as normal as possible, he is taking measures to make you understand. What you did on this video is not considered a flick at all. This is just a normal shot pretty much any console player does. I play on console too and this is not a flick in it's slightest idea.
---
Nah man, I really don't care haha. I know I'm not cheating, it was just luck.  But if I down voted you it must have been an accident. I'll go back and look.
---
There isn't one
---
PS4 R6 here and..................... yeah............... we all toxic. THE OL’ Clutch or Kick on some stupid game that not even game point. The “hey kid do you got a mic? No” kicking someone. It’s honestly all relative, some days it’s bad. Other days you link up with a squad and wreck house all day long.  Part of the experience, and honestly PS4 is the only platform I have seen consistently having the least amount of people modding the game (hackers).  unlink the Windows counterparts (XBOX,PC). 
---
Still it’s annoying but like I said it’s all relative.
---
It’s like I’m watching a Five Nights at Freddy Video.
---
Blitz in a 5v2 smh
---
Ooh... just... a... little 💪💪💪💪💪!!!!
---
Bosg achieved
---
True, forgot you can't even place charges on indestructible floors.
---
What?
---
Jager looking thick tho
---
UP THE BOURNEMOUTH
---
&gt;I’m pretty decent at the game so that’s probably why
---
That
---
 Nice flair
---
Exactly. They took away the acog because it was too good. Now you have to choose between a weaker gun and an acog or a stronger gun without it.
---
Other wise
---
This is the OG GAME! like omg I'm getting flashbacks and shit
---
One more word on this bro. The whole crappy and good operator ban. All operators are GOOD (big ass generalization ) but for the most part they are. Just the super easy ones to use by almost anyone to have the ability to swing the ending of a match are the problems, ya know. And those are the ones me and the boys kick. 
---
Again my $0.02, Bro.
---
Not true at all. I have a solo q plat 1 account and had a solo q bronze 2 account. The bronze account is now low gold in a span on 20 games  and it wasn't even hard. It's literally just skill. Even if the enemies are teamed up in low copper, as long as they are not smurfs, one guy can shit on everyone with his skill.
---
Rook what the hell
---
Good opporators aka stacking zofia Jackle thatcher thermite big ronda habana Finka maverick aka all opporators that have a high pick rate
---
But the cyclical nature of everyone getting even just results in everyone ruining other people's games and makes toxic people more toxic.
---
If I get tk'd, mostly accidental. I never EVER, EVER TK back. There's just no point. It doesn't teach anyone a lesson and now that there is ReverseFF they can't kill me again. If I retaliate then they'll start blocking me and the stuff you mentioned. 
---
If I don't bite they'll have to go entertain themselves in other ways.
---
You can be responsible and be the bigger person or you can keep justifying your toxicness too, at the end of the day there's either one kid on a naughty step or you on it too stuck with that naughty kid.   
---
I know what i'd rather be.
---
Don’t die
---
What the fuck
---
Thank you bot. Shameless repost.
---
Uh
---
But we never even mention TT. And honestly, if you play TT, its mostly just to warm up (so you would be pretty dumb if you use aim assist). Anyway, technically, there is a bit of aim assist to shoot default cam but who cares. Its doesn't really impact the real PvP.
---
Aim assist in PvE is another subject on his own.
---
Possible, though typically the loudest voices in my games sound like college kids. I’m 39 and just want to play 10 ranked games to get a rank, get a charm and die with dignity haha
---
Opened it in a random alpha pack and thought it was cool, so kept it, don't remember the name tho, sorry.
---
They said that you **might** get something from them for hitting a big milestone, whether that be a black ice or something like it.

"Called the bunny hop, knaw your enemies to death!"
---
Yeah I don't know who thought adding a character who can see players through surfaces was a good idea on a hide and seek gamemode
---
That may be true, i encountered a hacker once, but man pc players are bundle of fun! Basically we played a round it all went well second round someone used hack and wrecked everyone. Third round the hacker got kicked but someone gave both teams unlimited health lol so we were all walking around the map just chatting
---
But that was the only hacker encounter
---
House isn’t a bad map you just suck.
---
I remember on clubhouse the lag pushed me off the building and I fell from a height that should have downed me but about halfway down I lagged again so I took no damage somehow
---
How was that easy, you MISSED 90% of your shots
---
Mira and echo should be S tier, maestro too.
---
YES PLEASE, I always quit them lol
---
That’s the joke

#BringBackOldGlaz
---
I don't play pc a lot, but I've never seen a hacker, at least in unranked/casual. If you dont know what unranked is: It's ranked, but you don't lose/get MMR, and it doesn't count to the ranked k/d or w/l rate
---
It’s good to play for YouTube content.
---
HOUSE is best map for casual
---
Hello ipost_mp4, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/drktkb/mp4png/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I would put Maverick in s, and hibana and Mira in a, but the rest is spot on
---
As Kapkan that's pretty normal, uness you suck at being Kapkan - since you should be able to get up to 5 assists per round.
---
It depends where the bullet goes, if you shoot through the chain link holes than your good, but if your crosshairs go over the wire it won't. It acts the same as a railing.
---
So yes if you managed to throw up and shoot perfectly though the holes than the shots will find the mark. But if u were to hit the actual wire then your screwed. Might be just being unlucky a lot but I hear people complain about the idea of a chain link fence stopping a bullet quite often in R6.
---
favela isn't bad either just tower
---
She’s really strong at the end, so if you team up with other ops to stay alive for a while, she can be an absolute blowout in the last minute. You really need the other ops to carry early on though
---
Okay yeah, him having a shield would actually change things for me. 
---
As for the personalized gamemode, I‘d love to see it! Only thing missing is custom maps :/
---
I know ! Its insane how toxic they are! I never encountered that in Pc and if i did i am sure my team would kick him for dirty play. R6 has been very fun for me on pc mainly because most use mic so it was alot of banter even if we lose. I noticed that PS4 matches are often more run and shoot than my PC matches.
---
replica helmets go for about $200 right?
---
Trash skin
---
I like tower it my favorite map but I’m not going so say it is a “good” map because it sure as hell is not
---
This is why calling out who you kill is important! If I didn't know it was doc, I wouldn't of been able to jump in showers.  Really shows how on pick can open up the site if you play your cards right ;)
---
Counterargument: not having pulse would also ruin the game mode. I’ve seen a lot of wins where they either don’t have a pulse or they have a few pulse players who are dead, and they can’t find the last player between nightshroud and map size. If there wasn’t a pulse, almost every round would end with monsters winning by hiding in a corner and no way to be found. 
---
I don’t know the correct outcome, but the game mode needs a lot of balancing to be sure
---
Correct. But you’re gonna have to pay import taxes ontop of that most times considering they are made in Russia
---
Especially if you remove the orange tip off the barrel!
---
What about the defuser?
---
This guy is literally lying, he’s just posting a Halloween picture of him (probably) posing like playing a game.
---
💀
---
Took a long hiatus from siege and missed the rework to the rankings, what exactly is champions?
---
Favela and house are fun to mess around with during casual, same with plane 
---
Tower though is never fun
---
Its casual rotation, all maps should be available
---
Where’s Hulk Hogan Maverick at
---
No this is actually me playing a warm up round. When we started the real matches I took off the helmet. This was at an actual tournament in the Netherlands
---
I agree, with u there. house is a spawnpeekers paradise, favela is a wallbangers wife and tower is just idk but its perfect for a specific type of person
---
Lesion's primary weapons should be a choice between a ladder and bucket.
---
Ngl never had a IPA I usually drink Rum and Japanese Whiskey and Mikes mangos for. A chill beer
---
Instead of yelling out FUS RO DAH, he just yells FOOKIN' LAZOR SOIGHTS
---
House is a classic favela isn't bad in casual but tower? Nahhhhhhh that's not even a good terrorist hunt map
---
Yeah. Got 10 assists while playing defence and then 2 assists and a kill while playing Thermite on attack.
---
It's litreally the weakest weapon in the game in terms of DPS.
---
They haven’t been explicitly been barred from playing; parents/guardians can buy the game for them.

Fuze and Kapkan xD

Yeah i know that but my friends dont play this game and for a solo que this game is rly bad or i am just unlucky ?

There’s not much they can do to buff him except his gadget. Smg-11 will have too much impact on a lot of ops and his shoty is good. I don’t really know how they can buff him.

Carbon Fiber please

Operation Health 2.0

ALL RIGHT BOYS. Message was sent let’s see what they say.

---
where is your gun. what is this. no. somebody please explain.
---
&gt;MP5SD2

a weapon with so low dmg needs at least an ACOG or you can just dump it. if you miss the head its impossible to win a fight
---
Beauty at its finest
---
Oof, you definitely gots to report that I’d be pissed.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
They would have to significantly change them  but still make them have only a slight bit of resemblance of the old gun. Such a radical change should justify adding new skins!
---
Consent is a myth
---
PC
---
yeah i mean how important can guns be in a shooter right ? also we dont need another op: health
---
Done multiple time, even from live chat, they keep saying that items are effectively on account but not showing, even though I showed the receipt of the purchase they can't do anything, it sucks.
---
Yikers
---
r/R6Steams
---
Ungrateful bastards, the lot of em
---
yeah why would you start removing ACOGs on scum like the 2 defending french fries who are gunwise totally broken but instead dont give one to an attacker with a gun that without hitting the head is absolute garbage
---
Thx but im done with this game
---
Why not have a dokabi instead then?
---
Oh ok
---
That fucking blows.
---
just stop meme is dead
---
From that logic why is rook a TEAM PLAYER on the top row
---
Me: sprintos into a room full of lying defenders
---
The. Helmet. Stays. On.
---
I think so as well, although, sometimes it would be nice to keep certain skins.
---
I disagree, she can’t get kills, but those boomsticks work wonders for knowing where the hunters are so I can head the opposite direction
---
when glaz was good
---
Yeah most of the community is pretty garbage..its really sad whats happened to the game, makes it reslly difficult to enjoy it anymore.
---
Only orange recruit
---
“Modded” and “Scuf” is different 🤡 and wtf is auto lean lmfaooooo
---
Yeah I was surprised I drew so well considering my luck is at the point where I shot a shotgun at near point blank range and all 7 random pellets made a near perfect outline of the guy I shot at.  I mean this was back in year 1 but still.
---
nice joke there

Dont ever show me this ever again

Her being one speed will be too much imo she’ll be an ash 2.0 she’s fine being 2-2 imo.

I literally hate all ttv and yt accounts now, no one wants to meme like this anymore even in casual. I’m level 195 and main rook, I come tbagging out with my armor deployed and it’s always one of them just to roast me. With unranked what’s the point of casual besides to meme
---
I’ll take your entire stock
---
i thought they said her having an assault rifle was too strong
---
im speechless
---
FYI I freaking suck at this game
---
I can agree with those weapons but I want to put variety unlike the operators this season where they have guns every one else has also think of his an-94 as nomads AK but with a slower rate of fire
---
Cheers
---
Stand in a Pentagon, aim at the head of the person to your left, and shoot at the same time
---
casual...
---
Nah, glaz has his own smokes unlike warden who has to rely on the enemy team to provide him with smokes, give warden smokes and boom hes balanced, also some leniency with movement so he can atleast shuffle around a corner a bit. Being able to see through smoke is by nature better on attack than defense imo

Also went on FQA, good shit! dudes from r/clowns said they miss you though. might wanna hit them up.
---
*Modern warfare looms in the shadows*
---
Well it was both. They tried acog and an ar.
---
I think he’s saying that if echo isn’t already picked you might as well go him over rook
---
Let's clarify, console is toxic, pc is 80/20 fine/toxic.
---
But yours is bad lol what ?????
---
His charge is very loud and takes half a second longer than thermite
---
buncha no brains see a downvote and automatically follow in, nothing new sadly.
---
*sniff sniff* God damn girl are you a bandit main because you have that stuff on you
---
That’s fine
---
NOOOO
---
You’re*
---
Yeah I have the same one, they look perfect

I'm guessing he is using the overlay and that grabs their highest rank (I think or their primary region) and displays their rank. If you dont know how the overlay works one you believe that match making is broken when in fact they might be NA silver/gold but EU plat/diamond
---
I’ve run Caveira and Nøkk since the feature came out.
---
It's the toughest site on Outback by far. My play is to have a teammate control mezzanine, have a teammate control electrical and have a teammate control games room. Then you can push the party door. Taking garage is nearly impossible without breaching the bottom and having both windows under control. Good luck.
---
Fuuuuuuuuck. Rough day in geography class little guy? Couldn't figure out which colour to use for the map of whatever cesspool you live in? Don't worry. We won't judge you.
---
Yeah definitely. u need to know that it‘s really toxic, so friends are helpful. But not necessary, I play most of the time alone and it works well for me. I try to ignore those toxic people
---
They reworked speed.
---
Shotgunning walls is cleaner.
---
Sound improved.
---
More game modes.
---
Rotating causal map list.
---
Every season has 1 event Halloween. One is going on now ends in a day or two.
---
Pick in ban in ranked.
---
There's a bunch more. Just off the top my head.
---
As much as I dont like to recommend  either of these Greyshop or FSB shop have a strong grip on the replica market. Grey has one for 199$ (USD) not including shipping and FSB has one for 150$ (USD) not including shipping. I havnt bought from FSB but ive bought from grey without issue.  Either way your looking at a while before it would arrive as it would need to clear customs also.
---
Lord Tachanka is perfect there!
---
It feels very much like any other thumbnail. Nothing sticks out or grabs my attention
---
Edit: Also Bucks gun has been cut?
---
I play on the same server. I maybe get one match where their is toxic players. Most of the other times it's a team with all mics doing callouts or no one is doing a call out besides me.
---
Those are good buddies. Sitting by watching and crouch spamming to celebrate
---
I was born in 96 try again. I’ll give you a couple tires to make it funny this time.
---
I mean, yeah. I usually try to assossiate my thumbnail with the most exciting thing that happens in my video
---
I agree, spawnpeeking is counterable if you know where it's from, and on every map every spawnpeek is pretty much in the same few spots. Only exception is bank and Oregon construction, I don't like dying in the first second
---
ubisoft wants it huh
---
Unfortunately it‘s not only the American community. The European is just as toxic if not even worse.
---
I thought it was a reference to Blood Orchid
---
Yes! This is one of the things that frustrates me. It doesn't really matter of you have the season pass if you just have one available per day anyway.
---
what rank are you considering low? From my experience falling down to low silver because I was on a shitty laptop, most people can use her decently. Its not that complex to time a phone call when you are entering the map, or kill someone and hack cameras
---
That’s my girl right there!
---
Yah that definitely does work but it’d be nice to have the option on
---
[I do this too, mostly just to organize my personal tier/preference  list](https://i.imgur.com/GlXQsYD.jpg)
---
No, they do not block bullets. Just aim
---
I got the two horrible charms: that dumbass Lab Rat and this retarted lost foreskin with a face
---
I mean tbf you could have gone to the left a little in cover
---
Big thing is learn the maps. Rooms are pretty much easy to know. Bookcases in it, its probably called library. So on and so forth. Be be the guy that dies and complains about it. Be the guy that calls out where the guy is. And NEVER say he's over there. Give a room or a direction on the compass
---
Used to run fuze/kapkan because he was my orignal main attacker, both Russian elites looked sick together.
---
I guess you can just change individual games and turn rainbow and other games on
---
Try the atomic pumpkin ale if you find it. Shit's bomb.
---
Maybe not that font, bucks poor gun, seems generic... you will get it tho!!!
---
I wasn't in the game then(I'm really embarrassed about it), i meant that white rose with thorns and blood on it.
---
Sorry i forgot to metion i made this thumbnail on mobile
---
Right now I'm using a Sennheiser gsp 500 and it's by far the best headset I've ever bought. Before those I had the corsair hs70 and they were surprisingly good quality for the price, my only issue was that the hs70 is definitely made for a smaller head than mine lol
---
It would add a small little incentive to have the season pass imo.
---
*falcon
---
Why would anyone anchor with these two perfect examples of roamers I never understood that
---
Lol they didn’t kick you because of your ace...
---
I started playing with friends, they were level 150+. They told me to play Rook, easy job, give plates, make rotations, anchor site. Now I main Rook. I like Rook.
---
I appreciate the time you put into this
---
When I played the game I always stayed obj as rook
---
If all the ops you have are taken, then you get recruit even though he isnt normally an option in ranked. There was one other instance where my friend's game crashed and he reconnected while we were choosing ops but didnt load in in time to pick, and he got put on recruit even though he as all the operators.
---
Blitz and jager when i want to have fun, finka and echo when im tryharding
---
No one at low rank bans anyone for the right reasons. 90% of the time Mira and Echo are banned when they're extremely easy to counter in low ranks. Low ranks just do the same bans that high ranks do without really thinking about it.
---
He shot my friend actually 😂. He thought my friends and I were gonna TK since he wasnt recruit and panicked
---
My friends and I call lesion "wackie chan"
---
Only the chosen few have the honour of being showcased
---
I call that heresy
---
Nice red hat you have
---
Itas12L or itas12S depending if it’s the primary or side arm
---
Well, console players are already playing against M&amp;KB players so...
---
or Gridlock's (ik it is a SAW)
---
Yes. To be honest, I feel like the season pass doesn't really give alot of value. It's more of a convenience at this point and could really use a relook
---
If you have a good else and a good smoke coordinating they get shit done.
---
You updated the integrated graphics? Are you sure that r6 is using your GPU?
---
She's extremely powerful actually, because she counters a direct chase *and* buffs the other trappers by making attackers less likely to notice the other traps.
---
Her grzmots slow attackers to less than her visible speed, on top of allowing her to trap enemies in Smoke and make them not see edds and welcome mats.
---
Yep. Welcome to siege.
---
very VERY nice
---
So glad they have pulse on offense or attackers would literally never win, since Jackal can't see invisible feet and Lion can't see stationary enemies.
---
its using both integrated and the GPU
---
Brother no it is no nut November
---
“I can ride my bike with no handlebars”
---
Naturally?
---
Good job.
---
Give her the SASG
---
Me too; and I got this dumbass Rat and Ball sack charm
---
Yeah I've tested it with 3300 hours of play time
---
For MnK on console, crossplatform would be nothing but great. MW did it perfectly and a system like that is something they would spring for immediately because that force MnK to separate from controllers. It was also confirmed in a leak to be a part of the QoL in y5 they talked about (along with the company wide push for cross platform ubi is doing).

not as annoying as lesion gus

The stalker is a bit to strong in this game mode, because you can't hide from his scanner. It destroys the whole 'hide and seek' thing.

Yeah, like I don't care if they spawnpeek because you can predict most of them and it's a free kill, or they try some wacky new one, and that way you learn a spawnpeek so... (I recently found a counter to my spawnpeek I always called uncounterable, so even still it's evolving.)

main thing i'd say that matters is the video card, and mostly any decent video card can run it 1080p 60fps, you can also search on youtube like "rtx 1060 rainbow six siege benchmark"

Didnt know miras first name was kyle

The CEO said it during the Q2 earnings call:

---
They just need to lock the class to a certain limit or decrease the range because I think it's too far.
---
This humor is boomer-level, why are sooooo many people liking these strips?  
---
Is the player-base that old?
---
Yeah, Xbox, I literally have easier games in comp in mid-high gold than my casual games. In my experience most of my casual games equals to plat 3 rank.
---
I’ll have to try it then! xD who knew in a R6 Reddit we’d have a discussion about Beer
---
lol good meme. You literally just run around the whole time throwing them in doorways and people lose you. Repeat the whole round. I have literally never lost on defense when I was Ela.
---
Its pretty good, you can't lean when not ADSing though
---
good luck next season
---
That was a gem of a game. Played that endlessly.
---
I didnt know that. That's odd
---
I play as doc all the time, and theres always one guy who shoots me for not healing his 1 damage boo boo, as im just about to shoot our teammate who is nearly dead with my last syringe. So i kinda dont play as doc anymore
---
I can’t count the amount of times I’ve hit a stun and poison at the same time and didn’t even realize it until my health was at 30. She’s definitely useful.
---
He means GTX 1060 btw, not RTX
---
Yeah I can't tell you how many times I've lost because of that stupid mechanic. Absolute cancer.
---
I answered to the guy saying glaz should be able to kill Mira behind her miroir. 
---
Just damaging it a bit I’m not against.
---
It’s 17+ to legally purchase the game not to possess or play
---
You’re about 6 months late
---
Do like the silencer aspect of it.
---
Ela? You mean Frost? Or did I miss something?
---
5 of the kin will never rise again
---
I had the wrong video my bad. I gotta remove it
---
Mira lacks counters, which is why she gets banned so damn much.
---
Goyo sets up his shield at the door. The other two places strategically around you as to protect you from stray bullets. He waits patiently behind one, keeping you company. Capitao readies his crossbow, sights at the door. Fuze looks around aimlessly. The terrorists try to enter but are met by the shield. As they clump up, Goyo smirks before whipping out his vector and exploding them all to finish round one in a split second. "EZ" his says. Round 2 begins and the terrorists make their way in. This time without the shield, Capitao unleashes a bolt of fire, killing half of them, Goyo finishes the rest off. All looks good so far. Fuze exits the room in haste. Goyo is perplexed. Round 3 begins and Capitao unleashes his last bolt and the round ends just as easily as round 2. "EZ" says Goyo. Round 4 commences but without the fire, the terrorists are able to enter much faster. With Goyo and Cap under pressure, a loud thud is heard followed by the sound of popping. "Oh shit run" screams the two defenders. But it was too late the entire room was engulfed in a cluster charge and fire. Fuze appears, "mission accomplished."
---
Yooooooou
---
I would hate it if Nøkk had good DPS.
---
The shield thing will either be useless or broken. I guess he’s a defender because the other is an attacker so an ar will be a bit too powerful for defense look at jager with his carabine.
---
The attacker is simply broken, he/her will take the place of all hard breacher and defense couldn’t do anything.
---
That's what I always thought. But my friend gave me shoft for not doing the best every game.
---
She has enough counter.
---
Twitch can destroy her miroir 
---
Vertical play you use the map to destroy/ evade her miroir 
---
Frags to kill he behind it 
---
Smoke of the miroir so she can’t see.
---
This will be way too op and glaz will be a must pick on some points. It’s too powerful of a counter.
---
Chain link fences don't block bullets
---
agree
---
the last couple of minutes were truly breathtaking
---
your hiding from it if you’re out of its range
---
Halloween gamemode. It's active for like 1 more day
---
I like running Alibi with the shotgun, don't @ me.
---
What the bottom one
---
This isn’t impressive
---
It is extremely hard to find a squad for me. My friend has been making one but cant find our final player and im getting restless
---
Just glad Glaz was included
---
It sucks fat cock tho
---
The lord's helmet , I was gonna carve the bottom out aswell and wear it as a helmet but realised I don't want my head smelling of pumpkin .
---
You can say recruit is trans if that makes you happy.

Better than me by a long shot chief
