I have to be a Doc main now because I got a black ice for him....for the P90

I’d honestly be interested in a map or an event that takes place in the White House where instead of the default hostage it’s the president secretary of defense or something.
---

---
They said they have temporal fix for it, and I haven't noticed any glitch yet
---
Blackbeard can make sense for certain objectives the whole plan hinges on holding a specific angle, but lion is just about useless after the nerf
---
I've read that book but mine had a different picture on it
---
I just asked because my dad has a copy of that book and it is huge
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior Tachanka?
---
OME WA SHINDERU
---
This made me feel bubblie I bubbled when I saw this it made me bubble
---
Wait is that recruit with Vigils gun? Is that possible?
---
But, they should.
---
Bruh what was getting censored
---
I’m told his earliest work is the best, later novels aren’t as great and the ghost writers do a decent job, but I’d love to start reading his work or even on audiobooks for when I’m driving in the car. I’ll keep the sum of all fears in mind as well, cheers!

That Bomber cosplay... 👌👌👌👍👍👍

I hate how much melees affect the shield. Especially for clash and Monty like you have 2 hands holding that bitch an elbow from ash shouldnt make you almost fall over.
---
Mango, Fruit Medley, and Mint. The holy trinity of juul pods.
---
Nice fingers
---
Sometimes teammates dont have mics and they use the team chat, muting them doesnt work.
---
I’ve seen the different cover you’re on about, think it might be a different print or a print in a different country but I did try and get that one haha
---
It's a great book
---
I only get commons and uncommon. And then every 25, yes no joke 25, I get something like a rare.
---
Yeah it’s about 900 pages and the font is smallish
---
Console don’t have em yet
---
No they don't lol. You can only get those skins by random chance since they're alphapack only. The point of them making a list is what? So you can be less suprised to actually get a cool skin?
---
Alright, thanks! :)
---
You might want to report their toxic behavior so they can get punishment. I don't think they will have immediate punishment if it's only once per game, even when RFF still isn't a thing, you need two or more TK to get punished (matchmaking cooldown)
---
Thanks, I grew them myself.
---
His Clark and Ryan novels are the best, but his others are good too
---
Yeah lets goooo 😂😂😂😂
---
Not everyone is boosting (I’m not saying they are or they aren’t) they might simply be playing with real life friends. I am plat 2 my friends are in gold and silver and I’m not just gonna stop playing with my friends because they are not at the same skill level as me.
---
Loving it so far
---
Fuze would be a very logical choice on secure area
---
You scared the shht out of Doc man
---
I hear that a lot but I'm not sure I believe it, I queued with a friend that accidentally put us in EU instead of NA (I don't remember exact server) and it felt like the enemy was missing everything, I guess they could've just been bad but I really felt like it was an advantage
---
Source please lol
---
Where you at?
---
You would have to never play any fps game prior to legitimately be in copper 4.
---
Kinda wish you could trade in 3 or so items for 1 item of higher quality or perhaps a free choice of an item from the same pool of items of rarity
---
Lmao these people. Did you kill him? No. Then it is not a kill.
---
Terror and Confusion started as the enemy ash attempted to peek the opposing jager, The non clan member ran in front of them, killing the Montagne in one shot, the clan members grew confused and shot each other, the party leader left leaving the one non clan member to complete the rest of the game..
---
deplorable.....
---
That looks a popsicle stick that was left open in a freezer for a month 
---
After seeing this I won’t be so mad about commons anymore
---
I’m going to have to look up the best order in reading his books later (if it’s needed)
---
whats gettin censored tho
---
Perfect description
---
Can i have some i dont have any
---
R/boneappletea
---
Do you think he’d run out to stim shiho?
---
Red October was his first, but Patriot Games is a prequel, so I'd start with one of the two
---
Capitao because i love his ability and his LMG
---
Better, you could have a casual mode, ranked mode, newcomer mode and a mode where we get to play old maps like the old kafe and Hereford base etc
---
Yes
---
Listened to on cassette in my car thought it was a really solid book
---
You monster
---
Nomad is pretty good if you’re just starting out. Helps out with defense peaking/ coming out and also protecting bomb or securing area.
---
Because the proleague players do it also . thats why ubi removes them
---
I'm a lesion and nomad/Mav main for their utility especially their use I'm high gold to high plat (my usual rank)
---
Yea that would be sick especially if they remake more maps
---
Ya you deserved it for being a jackass
---
That’s a stupid reason
---
Imagine getting a skin that is just a repost
---
Hell no, you shouldn't get a second chance if you let the attackers get the diffuser down
---
I like Caviera best, being able to flank people with silent step is the best.
---
Aha 
---
Me too I started with the all original operators but never use boosters cause I never get any

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

---
Those PC plats and diamonds pretty much have an unwritten agreement not to bring ops like lion and bb unless the other team does first. Which is why Parker frouns upon the players who do bring them.
---
You can only get it from alpha packs as of right now. However, if you're really desperate, there is a Frost bundle for 800~ R6 credits that gives you the Super 90 black ice and a headgear.
---
As for the chances, I don't think there's any official statistics but I opened 80 a while ago and got 4 so about 5%.
---
I don't think you fully understand how an airjab interacts with the game, perhaps you should go test that with a friend in a custom game and come back so you can see how ignorant you were.
---
Please tell me why does it say Minecraft 2017

Blackbeard is way worse. I almost 1v5 ed today and didn’t cause the last guy was blckbeard and I domed him but it didn’t t matter
---
Started a year ago dont have any black ices
---
What's not fair is being color blind and not being able to read the fucking chart

---
AcOg oN M870
---
Well would you look at that. Thanks!
---
Agreed, dont wana disable it because some people dont have mics.
---
That still doesn’t explain why they have a fairly low win rate.
---
Why does it say shit in German on his gun
---
Imagine thinking that current Lion is more "*bUsTeD*" then OG Lion.
---
Yo that sucks bro
---
I got four acc 3 70+ and one 110 and no black ice among them
---
The one times it's good to be apart of the losers club

---
How dare you
---
Yeah, let me look around for a bunch of cloaked traps instead of the Ela sprinting for me at 100 mph
---
The only part I agree with is the rotations of each round it should be attacking and then defend the next round. I solo que on Xbox and haven’t had to many problems and I’m at gold 1. Maybe I’m just lucky.
---

bruh 🤣🍑👅😂👌
---
AND HIS NAME IS
---
i actually got the black ice for the p9 yesterday pretty good considering i play alot of monty
---
It will never replace the true lord tachanka
---
I was hoping for an invincibility glitch damn
---
Win Delta is often misleading.
---
Example?
---
On the same chart you linked Smoke, Monty and Kaid have some of the lowest win deltas yet they're some of the most powerful ops in the game at the highest level of siege.
---
Sweets bundle... get you a kawaii doughnut bruh... whats more fearless than ice cream covered weapons in a war zone :D
---
I wouldn’t say it made him stronger, but it definitely changed up his playstyle. Before, the strat was to find out where people were before using the lion scan to rush in and prefire walls and shoot the outlines. Now, lion scans are primarily used as an alternative to droning to try and find out where people might be hiding.
---
Without remorse is the first I think. I'd recommend reading them in the jack Ryan chronology (not in order of publication) https://www.orderofbooks.com/characters/jack-ryan-john-clark/. You can omit without remorse, but it gives you John Clark's backstory which is really cool.
---
You see it? 😂
---
Yeah now I do lol
---
Nice clip! 👍👍
---
Watermarks, credit in the video? None. 
---
If people care for wanting credit or proof that they made it then this stuff should be in the video. Same goes for fan art, which this sub is super picky about if the artist is not credited.
---
I feel your pain. I almost never play BB, but every time I do, I get headshot through my shield.

https://youtu.be/0bY_pPslgPE ) Im not sure about terms of policies but as far as I know ban cant be lifted if there is proof of cheating. Either way it would be expencive to sue them, but use it just as a reminder, and dont go full sicko mode, watch the video and be sure you are doing the right thing.
---
&gt; Frost has such a high win delta because no one expects her at such a high level of play.
---
&gt; His AUG back then was absolute garbage and he didn’t have a nitro cell.
---
His AUG was total trash before but it's not even middle of the SMG tier right now. His DMR is still his most used primary.
---
Think about it for the other opeartors. In a 5 stack you might have them determine that someone has to play Lion because he's so damn good... but none of them are good Lion players.
---
There's a huge difference in types of players in platinum and above. Some players know the game very well and that's what gets them there. For others they have great aim and that's their primary skill. Then there are those that are a mixture of the 2. This doesn't mean that any of them can pick up any operator and be amazing at them. While Siege is still an FPS game it still has some aspects that are operator, map, and objective specific.
---
what you need is [aim400kg.com](https://aim400kg.com) my dude

i didnt know r6 was an anime
---
This is very frustrating. It’s only a visual glitch but it makes me very upset
---
Go fuck yourself
---
Do you remember your ping at all? Ik there weren’t any symbols in the corner but I’m just curious
---
My first black ice! Got it right before the new season. The holographic is super clean now too
---
O.O  you're astraught up dumb faggot
---
I am Copper IV and no matter how hard I do my team doesn’t do shit to help me. When I queue with friends, I do way better and we win. I have not won a ranked game since like 4 days before the showdown event dropped.
---
Yep
---
Yeah my ping and his ping were fine.
---
first one i got was for the m870 🌪🌪
---
so are you fagboy
---
At least he has atachments
---
want to hear a joke? ESRB.
---
Yeah I get that. Hopefully battle eye gets back to you especially if Ubisoft said they have “indisputable evidence”
---
Present
---
watermark kinda ruins it but love the pic
---
I mean it's a slug shotgun, so it *is* a one tap. Last one wasn't one tap though, he shot twice
---
Oof! I’m so sorry :( 
---
I’m almost a level 220; so you’d think I’d have teammates to play with. Or friends rather. 
---
Nope— been solo-queueing since I get the game back in Para Bellum. 
---
I understand your pain though! It really sucks! There is only so much one person can do. Especially against a communicating team.
---
What are training exercises?
---
Yeah no it’s always echo and Jackal  never cav
---
please lion stop blasting your shitty bass boosted music in my house
---
Castle yes, but tachanka needs to stay trash for the memes
---
Ah ok. Maybe it was the server itself and not you but at a really shitty coincidental time
---
Yeah that button is like the close door button. Useless bit of fluff. Fucking ubi cunts put that there to cover the toxic chat ban thing.
---
Damn. I’ve been playing since White Noise, lv 200 and I got 6 (R4C, G36C, 417, MP5, Russian LMG + Pistol)
---
After you read the book the game makes a heck of a lot less sense...
---
Ik, I probs won’t sue em Bc there’s no way I’d win Bc their a massive company
---
I mean if youve played on console you shouldnt have a problem bc youll know maps and angles
---
Yeah, I mean if I was trying to die I guess I could move. Good point.
---
I have only one black ice and it’s for the same gun 
---
😕
---
Actual casual and ranked
---
Should just save, but if you still want to get one probably lion
---
I dont and never will get why this guy is a god. He is a trash useless op and literally just there to occupy space. But hey, I'm also not 12 so whatever I guess.
---
Ubisofts 10 year plan leaked.
---
do you just hold your phone in your mouth to record the game while playing?
---
OMG! That was lucky
---
*Laughs in ERC-7*
---
Ditto this. But it is common ngl
---
Back in those days I didn’t even know his shield could break.
---
There’s a couple out there. My team plays in GamingLeagueGGs on twitter and also infamousleague. PLM is still in existence like the other commenter said but it’s kind of inconsistent. I found my team just by joining their discord. Both of the teams I mentioned are on twitter and you can dm them or tweet at them to ask for an invite. Both have LFT sections. Good luck!
---
A lot of chance for accidental melees though
---
PC baby
---
Want a motherfuckin' screenshot?
---
Heres a cool little trick i found. When opening alpha packs right as a match starts, i seem to have a higher probability of getting black ice. Sorta like ubi is giving you a pity gift
---
Alright so let me explain how this works. Rainbow 6 DOES NOT HAVE peer to peer connection. This means when you connect to a game, you're connecting to a private server and not a direct connection to the other people. Games like fornite, GTA5, call of duty, you connect directly to the server AND everyone in the lobby.
---
So because of this it is not possible to get an individual IP from the enemy team. You can only get a server IP. If they were to hit that server IP EVERYONE ON THE SERVER WOULD BE HELD. Not just 3/5 of the people on each team.
---
Yea, I hope they say something different
---
ew
---
“first, to do no harm” - doc, 2019
---
When that Bandit got airjabbed behind him, I cried.
---
I’d be fine with that IMO. I like those 2
---
i hope you use it with iron sights...
---
What's wrong with it
---
Ah ok
---
use the glitch to get it on R4-C
---
*epic weapon skin*
---
i agree
---
If their callouts really matter though, the delay from their death to the message being sent might not make much of a difference.  You may just be better off turning off chat, although i understand wanting to be able to communicate with those that don't have mics.
---
Everytime I play warden I get instantly headshot, idk what it is I just can't play as him.
---
I just like seeing him run.

I agree too many people blame losses on Lion but that's not Lion's main problem and this is what people have said with games with operators that stop player agency... it's just damn frustrating. You want to play, not stand still and be locked from doing anything. It's why Dokk is also annoying. It's why Mei is the most hated Overwatch character. It's why Zaria's ult got more annoying when they removed most other character's movement abilities from letting them get out of the gravity bomb. It's why McCree's flashbang is rage-inducing. Or getting hacked by Sombra, especially as a character as dependent on their abilities as Reinhardt, is just annoying.
---
Games should veer away from abilities that take away a player's agency. The ability doesn't have to even be good to be hated.
---
\&gt;I was just pretending, guys! For real!
---
General Kenobi
---
...often...?
---
He's likely a fairly low rank. I'm around low-mid plat and usually the operators banned are those especially OP on a map or something that goes against a team's strategy. 
---
However I made a smurf to play with some low level friends lately and I've noticed Cav and Jackal are permabanned in EVERY SINGLE GAME REGARDLESS OF MAP. It's actually kind of insane.
---
That would be cool.
---
Not a single montange
---
\### Haha
---
Console? Doesn't happen like that on PC too much. Depends on day of work anyway..
---
Imagine trying this hard to save face instead of admitting your mistake. Cringe!
---
If it makes you feel any better, I switched from PS4 to PC and the first black ice I got was on the MP7.
---
Libtard
---
It might take a day or two to get back to you. Good luck though!
---
F's in the All chat for this guy
---
Yall both being bitches
---
I hated that shield. I stopped playing because of it. It's irritating now, because he can peak stupid spots and I can't one tap him.
---
Looks like youre a nook and smoke main now
---
I contacted them 3 days ago so I’m kinda losing hope
---
Hey feel free to hmu whenever, id be glad to join u anytime
---
I think she still quite op
---
I run the game at 60 fps on low with the same specs, except that i have an nvidia 940mx
---
Sorry no engrish I only speak porch of geese
---
Lol if you are having such big problems with him you are doing something wrong. He’s not OP just because you can’t counter it
---
Your move.
---
See, I pulled a sneaky on ya
---
First black ice at level 71 ?! Oof
---
I have one without
---
I didnt know it was also a joke in ur main squad lol
---
Ah proud of you. Representing all recruits.
---
Fuck no. That ruins the game you dipshit. Thats WHY people risk the plant. Just cause you lost a game with a high KDR due to a team planting the diffuser. You want to break the core game design cause of 1 loss? Get good or grow up  .
---
I can’t tell if that’s good or bad lol
---
I remember when the opposite of this happened to me,  it says it Costs -4 for an operator,  I had them for 4 hours then it went back to tellong me to buy them
---
You're in for one wild ride! My man Clark is the GOAT
---
May I just say, "OOF".
---
But I’m playing against people who have hundreds of hours on M&amp;K and I lose almost every firefight I get into
---
Wow. Nearly a plat and that guy gets sledgehammered. He needs to go back to copper.
---
You’re an asshole

Are neither of them worth at the moment?

Should be good. I wouldnt be running anything in the background specifically rgb kb+m controllers is what i had problems with similar specs.
---
*Hi, Welcome To Chili's*
---
lol fuck recruits
---
I thought twitch and cav had a thing
---
i litteraly just had the same thing happen to me, we had a spawnpeeker and i just wanted to fire a few supressing shots into the window and \*pop\* they peek on my first shot haha
---
no.
---
Cant wait To See Lesions and Miras SMGS or shotguns these are Great
---
I mean, Lesion is banned in many ranked games for a reason.
---
Also while the traps are hard to spot, it's not too bad especially if you check a common path with a drone (usually they're on stairs, doorway entrances, window vaults, etc.). I see plenty of them and I have terrible eyesight. Also he has a counter in IQ.
---
Yeah it’s just luck of the draw with teammates. I have some days where I have great teammates and others where every other game I’m dying for no reason. On twitch drone, DEAD. Reinforcing wall, DEAD. Watching doorway, DEAD. I had one guy team kill and normally I just try to ignore it or else it turns into a massacre of the whole team but they guy who got team killed messaged me about it and I was just annoyed so I killed the betrayer thinking at least now he can’t kill anyone later and then next round he c4ed me and got kicked. Then the betrayed guy messaged me saying the betrayer was his friend. Like wtf siege?
---
...
---
Honestly if they just gave chanka the ability to crouch while on his turret he would be massvly improved.
---
Oh indeed
---
The people you play with in-game always seem to be toxic, but the subreddit is surprisingly wholesome

Clear more space your desk if you can and get a big mouse lad and get used to using your arm to swipe to turn on lower sense I did it recently works well

I just quit playing showdown all together cause thats what causes it. Just restart your game and dont play 3v3 unless u wanna restart

---
Oh ok thank you for telling me :)
---
Hm I wonder the same because I shot a hibana in the head killing her one shot but shot two more not realising I killed her
---
I say it anytime this is discussed: a well orchestrated Jackal Monty push to clear roamers is the meta, and there’s value in preventing an operating scanning old footprints to see new locations. Dokk is great but only within earshot, lion is one of the easiest counters ever- don’t move. Jackal? You can’t avoid.
---
It's more when I'm playing someone like Hibana. The other day I was playing, last player alive. I was echo'd, I jumped out the window to run and hide. My character was so drunk that my entire screen was wobbly for a good 15 seconds, enough time for them to come outside and get me. I couldn't see straight enough to shoot, he is OP honestly.
---
Blackbeard is extremely fucking good what are you people even... Just what?
---
Especially with the recent change to the recoil pattern on the gun, I usually run flash hider on my guns, but when that change was made I switched it to the muzzle brake to reduce the recoil of firing in burst mode.
---
☹️
---
is it showdown that causes it?
---
Ela and Zofia both recover from concussive effects 50% faster than other operators
---
No
---
It benefits my team because it allows me to win gunfights I normally would lose. Thus turning a 4v5 to a 5v4..... I’m bad ☹️
---
Lol fuck twitch

I got killed by my teammate like this today on Theme Park. He shot someone in the hallway and the bullets penetrated through him and the wall and made it all the way to my head.
---
Ooh so your approaching me?
---
so if your teamate died, and you get 2 kills before dying, its a trade. if you get 2 kills and then die, your team is at a advantage
---
Dokk is the abbreviated version of Dokkaebi,  the hacker girl from South Korea who came in white noise late 2017. Nokk, is the American pronunciation of Nökk, the new spooky woman who is a mix of mask boy from white noise and old spooky Cav or Cavaira woman from the skull rain and came out with the cardboard box for that is favela, but in attack rather than defense. Nokk, came out  this past month.
---
Yes. Six pick is a setting where both teams see each others operators. However, bit teams get a "sixth pick". One of them swaps their operator and that operator is hidden to the other team. So you only know 4/5.
---
LMAO
---
Y E S
---
Teams see each other ops and one person can use sixth pick to change ops without them enemy team knowing.
---
I don’t think that’s possible fella...
---
I feel like he should at least be able to take a headshot, like one, depending on how big the caliber is. The Maska helmet (what he’s wearing) is rated to stop quite a lot of rounds not designed for penetrating armor to my knowledge. Like anything that’s not 5.56 should have a rough time
---
Yes. It only happened in one game. But it was annoying af.
---
Why does it look like a patchwork of two decent skins
---
If it is needed I can give you photos of my set up
---
Exactly. And you can wait either 12 (?) seconds for the phone to automatically hang up, or take 5 seconds to stop it manually. Jackal can track you 3 times during the whole round, while Dokk can only call you a max of 2 times for 24 seconds (I don’t recall how long the phone rings for). And, if you have a mute, and you’re in objective, you can run into a mute jammer and it stops it automatically. Jackal gives you your exact location. Dokk just gives off a sound that you’d have to listen for and search manually. Dokk isn’t scary like Jackal at all
---
What an absolutely amazing accidental play

Very solid defender and one of the dlc defenders imo. Could help deny bomb plants. Especially with Echo being a very popular ban.
---
Ahh ok i got black ice for the mp5 and the famas so my French people are decked out (vanilla at least)
---
If you move while echo’d it makes the effects worse and extends the duration.

I don't play PvP, but why is Lion considered OP for ban? His special sucks now (at least in THunt), and his weapons aren't that great.
---
Or ya know, he played people on his skill level.
---
I wish these happened to me— lmfao!
---
 Nice job man!
---
Both of which are usually banned in Ranked.

i doubt this guy is copper 4...

My only response:

Flbrrururururughghlppppppp
---
Does thatcher have the SMG?
---
because thats what this subreddit is....?
---
Watch this more then I’d like to admit.
---
Is R4C the most common black ice?
---
So many people have it.
---
Oh welp my bad I guess I’m stupid
---
What were you expecting?
---
Yeah I’ve been doing a lot of ranked for a while, lately the Meta I encounter at plat on console is a Jackal Monty push.  
---
Your “half a brain comment” is lol. You literally can’t counter it, a lion scan is short and easy and a Dok call is only useful if you’re in proximity. A jackal scan is literally free intel on roamers with no ability to stop.  
---
You can disagree without being a dick man.
---
I pick lion because people are not banning him. What do you expect? Let the other team pick him and our team to give up an advantage?
---
IQ still glitched out? Lol
---
Mavericks .50 is the only that stands out to me.
---
I dunno. Clearly not what we have.
---
Don’t teabag though. That just makes it worse.
---
Wasn’t playing agains coppers, they were a mix of gold ones and threes with one unranked.
---
I stopped playing Ranked because I miss Secure Area
---
Just don't play clash...
---
Frogmen
---
Im level 160 and only have carbine and fbi secondary black ice
---
For the Germans? No. Spawn peeking is bad enough with the fat ass Frenchmen having them
---
It was near point blank when the shot happened as well as it being with dokkabei’s bosg but you’re explanation still stands
---
straight trash
---
So i was playing casual and got destroyed by ash ying and another person because i was clash and they kept flashing my team and used warden but not his ability just the fact that they knew stopped them from flashing me but i still  killed them. That is the most use i have had from him so far
---
What else would be here
---
Lol just had this happen to me too; bitch looks like the little girl from the exorcist. Freaked me out
---
I usually wait by one of her mines by a door to the objective and hope they go through that door and trigger it.
---
I was expecting a whole room full of Ella's. haha
---
Good job to all.
---
whatever floats your boat man, i play the game for fun.
---
I mean i would be happy if little billy on his xbox would stop uploading his EPIC 2 KILL GAME WITH HEADSHOT THE ONE TIME to the subreddit
---
He's OK if you want to be big brother
---
I only have frost shotgun black ice🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Do people think jerking around like that makes you harder to hit? It just makes you look like an idiot.

is that 1:1 or?

1:1 and has all features available on it

I have black ice for her PISTOL. That was level 40 ish and I haven’t gotten any more, currently level 90
---
Casual uses the same matchmaking as ranked it just doesn’t show you your elo. So what’s happening is diamonds who only play ranked will start out in casual with 2500 elo or gold 4. That’s why your getting matched with them if your around gold level
---
Stop fucking posting this same god damned image over and over again, we fucking know. There's literally no point to this post. Just type in 'Danish frogmen' on the search engine of your choice and this image will pop up. Fucking low effort karma whores.
---
I've been keeping track of about 140 so far. Including duplicate rates, and black ice separately. Should have kept track of increase in duplicates over time, but oh well. Want the data?
---
Thank you
---
Do you have the ldd or bricklink file?
---
that is absolutely amazing
---
Very dependent on enemy anchors making a mistake and not pressuring entry points. 
---
Pro like Kanto called her a troll pick.
---
I personally think that Ashe or Mav can do her job more efficiently while still providing team utility.
---
Happened in a terrorist hunt a while back to my friend. We tried to revive him, and then we all died except for the glitched guy. He was doing fine until the timer ran out, then he just dropped.
---
The fan packs are awesome
---
It doesn't matter how much a person can handle the gun. The fact that it's the only primary to have random recoil will always put you at a disadvantage no matter what the case. As a set pattern will always beat a random one in a game like Siege.
---

Love you lol

I’m lvl 100 and I got black ice for bucks pistol and twitch’s f2

Nope

Connection issue, you can see it in the top right.

I think that with enough practise you wouldn't need any mistakes to be made.

Suck my toe I am 10000 and no ice
---
None of the guns have a set pattern. This isn’t csgo

I'll recommend Lesion, but just try ramdom ops. eventually you're gonna find your best op
---
Damn really? I tried to check everywhere to see if anyone has posted this before, looks like I didn't scroll far enough, alright mate my mistake, I just guessed no one had seen them
---
have a nice day
---
oof
---
Have you used it since they updated it and made the reticle on the holographic sight smaller?
---
Get the Trijicon IR-Patrol for that biz :)
---
Then slap an old blackbeard shield on that too.
---
Big oof for me I’m level 95 and still haven’t got a single black ice
---
It does - it reduces damage taken by 25(?)%, all around. It just doesn't dbno against headshots.
---
It’s a zambie
---
Black ops 2 was the last good cod
---
No it's not zombie like it sounds more like screams of agony. Like what you would think something from a dungeon would be like
---
Oop
---
CAMRS irons are extra chad 💪
---
I wouldn't say it was just you. I'm sure if I were to play a casual game rn I would expect more of myself then I am capable of, I would play very differently then I would in a ranked game. If you're not performing well in casual it is simply because of your mindset. (Also most people play differently in casual making it harder to predict). Just try to treat every game the same, without lowering your still in ranked games.
---
And then there's me, who doesn't give shit about skins
---
Before it was a cheap clip on, now it's a Blue Snowball, which is way better lol
---
Didn't even really think to do that, it just...happened! Lol

Why does he have SG 552?

Why is there just a empty white box on the left
---
Monty: Let me in. LET ME IN!!
---
What
---
How is this a nice one, you didn't do anything but turn off the phone
---
Biggest tip, use his claymore to protect your flank, and then when you make a hole, don't make one directly in front of your face, make it to the side of you. That way, if they start firing immediately, you won't get headshotted.
---
It is literally a zambir
---
Is it really
---
The boxes on the left are empty I dont get it
---
Tjat happened to my game before
---
Yes lmao
---
I wonder how many people think, that headshot is 100% death rate after games told us so
---
O I get it now
---
Agreed. I'm not much of a black ops fan but you cant argue that it wasnt a great game. Zombies was the best in that one imo
---
Wow the Lesion cosplay is particularly amazing imo
---
Lol
---
All I need is black ice for the shotgun and I would have everything for smonk
---
I've loved playing Castle since the beginning.  I remember so many people used to hate on Castle and they were constantly asking for him to get some kind of buff but to me he's one of, if not, the best defensive op.
---
another reason why castle needs a 4th barricade
---
Recruit looks just fine, you're just picky
---
Maverick's gadget makes a little bit of sound though so be careful
---
Thanks, I'm flattered.
---
I love that pistol, you should be thankful!
---
Despite knowing it’s probably gonna be average I still buy it every year
---
Thanks man :)
---
Thanks :)
---
That's what I was wondering
---
I'm not saying she can't be countered. The ways to counter her are obvious. I'm just saying that if she gets a chance to interogate, it's basically game over and it's one of the best if not the best operator's capacity in the game. 
---
I don't think anyone can argue with that.
---
Seriously, about 5 seconds of constant wall hack? It doesn't even make sense in a game that tries in its own way to be realistic.
---
What rank are you? I find the smurfs to be different depending on the ranks. Like bronze smurfs seem to almost always go for spawn peaks, so I would learn the most common spots and prefire them
---
Cheers
---
:)
---
Outstanding Big brain gamer moves
---
extended barrel is really good on a weapon with zero recoil like the ump
---
Usually when I play Castle, I stay inside the objective area and hold angles and use short bursts to better control the recoil and since the extended barrel gives me more damage in the mid to long range due to less damage drop off on longer distances, to me its the best attachment to use for him.
---
Pulse, on the other hand, I don't use the extended barrel because I see him more as a stealthy type and that barrel is a dead giveaway to your position if you're trying to hide and you see that barrel sticking out. By the way, FUCK PULSE.
---
How dare you be non-toxic on ubisofts watch?
---
I play glaz and doc all the time so i have tips for those ops. For glaz only use the scope for long range. For example, if you're peeking a window or down a corridor use the scope, but try not to move that much. When you start roaming, always take the scope off. It makes aiming at enemies much easier. Also, make sure you use smokes when possible.
---
For doc, just heal people that actually need health. Look at the health bars at the top of the screen and anyone under 70 health try and heal. Don't bother wasting a stim on someone that has over 80 health. Docs are best to stay on objective aswell and let the teammates come to you if they need help.
---
900 pages! Holy piss.
---
Damn... Thanks.
---
YOU BEAT ME TO IT
---
She was definitely OP primarily because she could detect some 20 defender gadgets, giving the exact location, and was the only live, hard counter to vigil, pulse, valky and echo, all being decently picked and powerful, and influential ops. Adding to that, the frags gave her utility that even thatcher could not meet, inturn eclipsing the latter.
---
She simply had too much utility. Dok, blitz, lion all have seen nerfs do the point that their gadgets no longer were, and still aren't, as influential as IQ's. Lion still is, though, in a stack, but is balanced by 2 speed and lack of breaching potential, which again, IQ has.
---
Giving her something that was proven to be strong would being her back up to the top where she had too much. Instead, giving her a less effective secondary would cause less harm, like flashes. Yes, rushes would become more prominent, but at least she wouldn't have unimaginable fragging potential.
---
I really liked the Sum of All Fears, I wanna get the Rainbow Six and Red October though...
---
Obviously you had borrowed time but not self heal smh
---
Idk I'm probably retarded that I can't like a pic made with a phone, just saw one with 1.7k upvotes kek
---
Stop playing the broken game.
---
That's the only black ice I have. Got it in my first alpha pack too so now I keep getting uncommon, I guess my luck is over
---
An honest post.
---
Hashtag respect.
---
This isn't exactly his intended use, as you said it's situational and more often than not you should have all your barricades down in setup.
---
IQ 372.4
---
Fun fact, the post RIGHT NEXT TO THIS is somebody getting BI for the sausage.
---
But it does nothing most of the time, since it kicks in only if you shoot further than 20 meters?  
---
Compensator can reduce random left-right recoil.
---
Ty and how do you get the glaz main beside your name?
---
I see what you're saying. Idk, I guess it just depends. Everyone's got their operator that they're good with. I think he deploys barricades just fine, it's just a matter of making sure the coast is clear before exposing yourself.
---
What a legend
---
I'm just having an idea of him being able to place both regular and bulletproof barricades faster. And that maybe it can make him a more active operator that changes the map layout more dynamically
---
Damn... I am truly humbled! 🤘😊🤘
---
Hey that's a little less than mine ping yesterday
---
Lion is trash after the nerf, come on, stop complaining (I play him really rarely)
---
poggers
---
Well, I would do it like this: if you down an opponent and your teammate finishes him off, you get the kill, but if you die before your teammate kills him, then he gets the kill.
---
Same I got all the event packs except outbreak and this one. I am not gambling for cosmetics so I usually get all the packs. However, when there are this many it's way too expensive. It's not that I can't afford it, but I can't justify 60 dollars on skins. They should stick to smaller sets or just letting us buy them individually.
---
as i said the ump has no recoil and its an smg so having more range helps a lot, it basically cancels damage drop off
---
If you look closely, It says 175 on the right.

Yup. Let em hate. All that does is free him up for those of us that do like him!

But if im only going to be able to play them in casual what's the point in restricting it's not like im going to be able to play them in rank again to choose where i want and how i want to play.

The best we could get is a contextualized ping system, where holding it will bring up a wheel to give a command or warn where enemies are coming from

I'll always play Blackbeard, he's a badass

You fuckin donkey, that id the exact thing what I wanted to say

I have a teacher at my school that looks exactly like him

Because if anyone plays causal they'll constantly attack/defend the same objective, the whole point of casual is to relax and not worry too much about where you defend

There are tons of toxic players in that game mode its a shame. Great clip otherwise!

Getting an IP isn’t hard. Getting an IP, finding an open port on that IP and bypassing the security is quite hard.
---
I know Siege isn’t a common sense game, but Monty’s shield isn’t operator by electronics, it’s all mechanical. Meaning having the claw attach when his shield is fully extended wouldn’t pull it out of it, simply make it zip zap.
---
As for blitz, just remove the ability to run and flash.
---
And for any other shield except recruit, I don’t seen any other way to better counter than to just play an operator that excels in denying shields like smoke or an operator with c4. 
---
Why exclude recruits? Because recruit is too stronk to be countered in the first place.
---
Because you didn’t 360 noscope one tap the mira through the mira window on hereford base then penetrating through the walls to hit the smoke on Oregon while using your kamahamaha to kill the rest of the team then make pro league and ace against g2

Why does shit like that still work? It‘s really not that hard to detect this pattern and put them in high plat at least.
---
Because your trash and shouldn’t play this game.
---
I’m kidding, please don’t bloody slaughter me. Sadly this is part of the siege experience, people get angered over you doing better than them, even if you end up acing the round. “ good “ players see people who have troubles aiming or low sens as people who are just trash, and when these “ bad “ players do better then the “ good “ players, they get salty and do shit like this. But! Good job for a player who’s working on their aim, I suggest terrorist hunt head shot only runs to help improve

In what way would high ping help you in those situations?

Go to the subreddit page, hit the three dots (option menu) and change  your user flair
---
Every version of Ash looks derpy as shit
---
Twitch and Valkyrie are some of the few operators who have slowly gotten better looking, but Ash just always looks bad, first, it was low res blurry textures, now it's a receding chin and weird jawline...
---
They have not been kind to her. Kinda hoping they don't do a Nøkk face reveal to save her from this fate.
---
Would be cool, except marvel is too fantasy like while siege tends to be more realistic (Ik its not but u get what I mean)
---
You just really need to find a group of people that you can play with. Communication is 100x better when you are talking together in discord. I would never suggest solo queueing especially now that there are a shit ton of posts and diamonds who throw ranked games to get lower ranks for fun. Just find some friends and get in a group. It’s definitely worth it I promise. Your siege experience will be much better!
---
Blame vigil
---
This
---
OH I thought you were staring at the ceiling of one of the rooms but you’re under the map. Okay.
---
When I say Thatcher he is generally the most efficient as he can't get wiped by gamers but buck, zofia, ash are all good for it as well but I often find zofia and ash players to not be team players and buck is very inconsistent sometimes he will be the best team player and set up amazing players and other times he dies first every round.
---
i really enjoyed this video's editing tbh
---
That awkward moment when the idea you want to be implemented into the game is already in the game
---
Damn that's looks way too good
---
Ty
---
And people say castle sucks
---
ah shit now there gonna take being injured out
---
you mean bandit should get thor skin .
---
You guys saying Custom Game, then maybe add "No Time Limit" option, so we can learn without a forced stop for a while
---
If they did it as a limited time mode like the cowboy shootin and rainbow is magic I'd be down. I don't see marvel going for it though, siege is too toxic and doesn't reallt fit the family friendly bill
---
That's not a one tap when you use a shotgun that shoots pellets, since you are technically using multiple projectiles to kill them. With the BOSG it's a single projectile, so it's a one tap
---
'Here, let me help you kill me!'
---
Lesion doesnt need a notification when he can see the icon across walls, floors and buildings.
---
Obviously it's not every site as well since some sites hard breachers aren't very effective but if I ask for one in a site that is hard to attack without hard breachers then maybe someone should pick an operator that can support thermite or hibana
---
Roamers*
---
But Monty doesn’t win that anyway, not many people do regardless of operators. He should lose the 1v3. If it was a 1v1 however Monty doesn’t lose currently, whereas after these changes (stats could be adjusted and changed), you have a chance if you play it right
---
Not sure about that but the issue is especially in the console community is boosting. Basically a high rank queues with a 4 stack of coppers and bronzes which in turn gets the high rank placed in a low rank lobby and he claps everybody in that lobby.
---
Imo an ace is killing the whole enemy team in this game. You can think about it differently but that’s just how I see it.
---
Let me in.... LET ME IN
---
Holy cow I lost it
---
You call him lardex? You clearly watch TheRussianBadger
---
It’s real i think, we got a logo leak of the operators we can see a grappling hook
---
I've won a couple of 1v 3 situations  with monty before, and it's because I was patient and the other team wasn't, Shields would become almost useless if the changes you mentioned are implemented
---
We didn't know that could happen "retard" in ally time playing R6 I thought only a Jager ADS could destroy grenades (not counting Ash vs bandit batteries
---
what smoke headgear is that? it looks cool and looks like it comes from bf1
---
bandit get the boomstick you have a challenger

Ah yes I am biggest karma farmer because I post memes on a sub with less than 30K subscribers.

I really try to be as pleasant as I can be! Despite being a solo player - I do talk in chat as much as possible so that the line of communication is there. Callouts and trying to be a good spirit! Granted, it’s solo-queue so no one says anything.

yesterday i held down the trigger on a pixel peek with finka lmg. against a 5 man of arabs, and by the time i was finished 2 of them where dead because they actually tried to peek it. like that’s how aggressive they play and sure i was laughing in the end. fish brains. but god aim.

That first shot should of been a headshot

But it isn’t though. You have so much protection and still would have so much pushing power with Monty. You still have the duration for the Extendable shield and a buff to the unextended stance with the shield.

Difference is he can’t challenge people as much, solidifying him as a support op. Saying that, he now has a red dot making it easier to hit shots when he has to

Feel like MP7 would be a better choice without giving her a huge number of rounds. It will still encourage her to get close due to lack of Acog while giving her a nice damage boost.
---
Every high mmr player on console does this
---
Finally someone said it
---
Same has been happening to me too. I usually float between low and high Gold, never have reached Plat, and this season I have been queued up against TONS of Plats with Copper/Bronze teammates. Haven't lost to all of them, but damn it's soul crushing to lose Round 1 and think "Uh oh...this team is WAY better than we are."
---
Set an mmr limit when queuing with people already ubi
---
go fuck urself how bout that?
---
There are two different solutions to this problem:
---
1. Prevent queuing together if MMR difference is higher than X (could be 800).
---
2. Separate Solo MMR from Team MMR like many other ranked games do.
---
Currently Ubi just tries to detect such people and ban (as I understand an automated report is being created then a human checks the report and issues a ban), but this can never solve the problem because people will just keep making new accounts if caught.
---
Ya know what, fair i agree with that. They could be lazy or they dont care. I never looked at it from that perspective. But usually when someone starts playing a game they are not good at it. Look when i started playing the game i was ass at it i was lile silver 3 but then i got better at it. And the new players are usually bad like i was when i started playing. The new players are probably bad but they improve, i do know where you are coming from though so like yeah i agree with you.

Hahah yea

[My suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c67biv/my_idea_for_a_matchmaking_system_that_counters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) to solve this problem.
---
In this case my Matchmaking system would match that team (3 plat 3 + 1 copper 2 + 1 copper 4) against an avg gold 1 team (3155 mmr calculated) instead of an avg gold iv team (around 2600 mmr)

---
This. This is why I’ve recently started playing castle (AKA one of the most underrated ops in the game)
---
fuck no
---
To be completely fair you did pussy out of the throw a bit and fucked it up pretty bad. Yes the end result in this case was super unlucky but either way that nade wasn't headed anywhere either way.
---
How does that mean I’m bad? Because every ducking time I throw one it bounces back to me when it clearly shouldn’t?
---
But...rank in this game means absolultely nothing
---
I wouldnt prevent queuing together, but you could simply discount any player more than x below the max Rank in the matchmaking. 
---
So for example, if we have 1 Dia and 4 Coppers - currently they play against Silvers. However since Coppers are so far away from the Diamond in terms of Rank they are discounted from the matchmaking, thus they play against other Diamond players
---
Couldn't Monty have gone prone and shot castles feet off?

I was in a match yesterday 2-3 and the other team dossed us till the end of the round for an easy 2-4 win.

If he was smart yeah lol

Yeah! I got ash’s elite and the next day I got black ice! Does ubi favor random players?

Add Rook armor, an overheal, a Finka boost ( if those can stack ) and make the enemy a 3-armor and maybe.
---
Damn, he checked out early and couldn't take it
---
I have to admit I shit on castle a lot more than I should. I main thermite and a castle barricade can really screw up my plans sometimes because it often means I have to waste a valuable thermite charge if the rest of my team has fucked off elsewhere. That being said castle is kind of annoying if I’m playing a roamer.
---
Lmao! It looked like that was your plan all along. Well played!
---
I know your feel bro. I grinded out everything. And thats what I enjoyed. The feeling of trying an op for the first time which you worked for was amazing for me.
---
I meant for spawnpeeks and for example on bank 3f.

I’m always so hesitant to do ranked. I feel like the little things that already piss me off in casual will make me rage when it actually matters and people are relying on me.

Thanks but I see ppl with more than 1 how that?

honesty if they fixed how matchmaking works it would make the game great. It already is fun enough.
---
A 5k is 5 kills, ace is killing the whole enemy team.
---
Anyone else got fixes or ideas?
---
I just assume most teams are like that. As much as I want to rank up ranks are stupid. Too many people care more about the rank rather than how they got it. I don’t understand why. See,  in league of legends if you hit gold you could get an exclusive skin that was usually pretty nice. While cheating to get that is stupid it’s far more understandable than gaming the system to get a stupid charm
---
Depends on your rank
---
Yes yes yes yes
---
Oh noice. It looks a lot like the Instagram editing tool, so that’s just what a though.
---
Wait, there are 5 tiers of items? I thought it was (from lowest quality to highest): white, blue, purple and yellow/gold

What's the 5th one?

Is it possible to learn this power

Everybody has been saying “we need a universal black ice” while you say the real truth. We really do need a trading system.
---
I don't hate Dokk, don't worry. I only hate Blitz.
---
Not true at all. The average player is silver 1/gold 4. Somebody who makes plat 2 consistently is a far superior player than somebody who makes bronze 2 consistently. Hence why a plat player queueing with copper smurfs is an issue since they'll be playing low silvers due to matchmaking. All it does is inflate their rank and ruin experiences for those silver players.
---
Well thats not all we can do

Apes together strong

I'm not claiming that the mods here are somehow connected to Ubi, just saying tho. 
---
I remember the massive shitstorm that started with Ubi rolling out paid surprise mechanics during Chimera with damage control 'v e t e r a n' Ash elite bs. And guess what, mods here were doing their best to remove posts and comments about how Ubi was trying to roll out shady business practices and was trying to calm everyone down with a free reskin of an upcoming Ash elite. 
---
My point is that by looking at Siege twitter page you won't see a news/status update page, rather a massive ad machine to promote the game to get more potential customers. These retarded posts about black ice, 'new' legendary items and various artwork promote Siege to some extent. Who knows, maybe someone will want to buy a renown booster to get that sweet shit from an Alpha pack they just saw on reddit.

😂😂😂
---
Casual was designed for that.  Lets you all have fun and practice at the same time.  Hell you will probably have an easier time in casual xD
---
They talked about it last year, but nothing since then.
---
Pathetic how they got such an easy fix for the issue, but are yet to do it 4 years after release.
---
Really shows where Ubi has their priorities.
---
If you do, you should probably get a console for shooters to fight a more fair fight.
---
Nice
---
&gt; The reason its needed is because people arent playing with friends... They are deliberately deranking to exploit the system.
---
Which is useless unless you then play with friends...
---
I know it won't, but you won't see it as much in lower ranks, you won't have a plat hacker carrying a copper. There will always be hackers (unless ubi decides to pay for a better version of battleye), but you just won't see it as much across the board
---
“the system is deepley fucked and is in a state to be abused.”
---
Thats why were discussing what the best solution for a new system would be.
---
Do you mean a squad rank or a rank when playing with a squad?
---
Yup! I suck with Tachanka but I find the key to using him is to move that turret around with you (if you can). Same with Castle. Don't be afraid to take down Castle barricades and move them around to limit attackers options.
---
Dude just gets dubs
---
I love it, but it's been posted already long ago.
---
Just sucks that, on console, casual is kind of a joke. Whenever I play on PC I have fun on casual but on Xbox it’s like no one has ever played before, just not competitive enough to be fun
---
But you dont have a “game assigned to your account.” You have a license, for a specefic platform, assigned to your account.

Anyone remember a year and a half ago when Ubisoft was "looking into" addressing this? And then nothing came of it?

Did the goggles like disappear
---
Then do something similar to cs:go, make it that when you have a full team of friends your rank difference doesn't matter
---
That already happens anyway

Global ranks will be great, or at least casual mode with no parties allowed

I hate going up against 5 stack play/diamonds in casual

Are you saying I'm a biohazard container?

This is the right answer. Even apex legends has it like this in its very first ranked season. Its a shame ubisoft.

Can you? Last I saw Siege was not supported by the port.

The elastic sprung it forward and over the camera on accident but I thought it was hilarious so I left it in.

X-cum-Y means X with Y (cum is latin preposition for with)
---
Normally means X has Y inbuilt or X along with Y
---
i would go with alibi. her gun isnt super good but u could just hit there head. a strat that i like to use is placing here prismas in front of windows that are common for attackers to go through. this makes it so they cant destroy it so they have to choose a different way to go or vault through and get pinged. you could also do this with deployable shields in doorways.
---
Steam has an emulator now that works with pretty much all games

Literally had just finished our promos and we were bronze 1 and next game we got matched against 3 plats 2 gold's. We are gold usually so no big deal really but honestly pretty ridiculous that the ranking system is this bad.

Less damage drop off at longer ranges. Combined with short bursts, he can do some pretty good damage while keeping recoil low.

OH GOD PLEASE NO

Ye lol
---
Yeah I can see that. Flashes might be a much better solution than claymore. It fits in better with her playstyle while not making her as strong.
---
It will always hold a special place in my heart because Grim Sky was my first operation and New Hereford was the first map I ever played. I really like it simply because it will always encapsulate that first “R6 experience” for me, whether or not it’s a great map
---
It also happens to me all the time.
---
wait theres a red rank now??? (im assuming its ruby)
---
Yeah, a month ago I looked for Siege on their list and it said it crashed a ton and was basically unplayable, I was asking if it changed recently.
---
They could implement that teams have to be eaqul in strenght foe example match a team with 1 plat 1 gold and 3 silvers with a team that has 1 plat 1 gold and 3 silvers. If not exactly than at least make the teams similar. You get what i mean
---
I thought the stim pistol had drop off?
---
Every op from any year/season can be bought with renown, the currency you get by just playing the game, and R6 credits, the paid currency. The only time you can't buy an operator is when the new ops come out at the start of season, you have to wait a week. The price of the operator depends on when they were released, so for example, Mira, a year 2 operator, will be cheaper than Alibi, a year 3 operator.
---
It may seem a bit of a grindfest at first, but if you just keep playing the game it won't take too long, if you play well you can probably get 400-500 renown per game. I also recommend buying Boosters with Ubisoft club points if you want to speed up the process. 
---
I don't recommend buying R6 credits to buy the ops, you're better off buying the Year 2/3 operator bundles.
---
Maybe you have begun to take the game a bit seriously? Anytime someone uses the term playstyle or uses a synonym of the word tactics when referring to a videogame it tells me they have lost sight of why they play.
---
Stop worrying about how others play and just play. Trust me you will have a much better time with your hobby.
---
I’ve made plat twice but generally hover around your mmr. I feel like 1/3 of all players are on second accounts with their gem stone gun skins. One of my main complaint is it makes the meta stale because all they ever have is year one operators, so every round has ash, bandit, and jager.
---
I mean, you have a point, but you're also referring to a fairly small subset of the siege playerbase. Most people aren't playing the game to play with their viewers and grow their community, they're playing it to have fun/compete. 
---
Plus, if a viewer is way lower ranked than the streamer, they're most likely either going to get super hard carried or stomped by the enemy team - neither of which is terribly fun imo.
---
Yikes. Imagine cheating and still being shit
---
I really thought I was special
---
Zofia
---
If you are talking about the fact that there is a castle barricade next to a hole, it is sometimes used to block lines of sight without blocking your team.
---
For exemple, on Skyscraper on office, people often place a Castle up the stairs and impact the wall next to stop a repelling enemy to have a huge line of sight to bar but still by letting your team rotate to desk/stairs.
---
If you are talking about something else, then idk :)

I dont need sleep I need answers!
---
Why does Ubisoft cuck us over like this?
---
Totally out of beta, guys
---
Nokk is a fun but weak op, Lion is an insanely strong but kind of boring op. 
---
Lion is incredibly powerful in team-based gameplay. An ability that forces you to stand still is ridiculously overpowered in a game like siege, especially with strong team communications.
---
Tis but a couple numbers
---
Lastnight I was 1 game off p1, solo queue and got placed against a 4 stack of diamonds including one with 5.6k elo legit no ddosing cause I know him and just cause they had a gold 3 with them wanna know what I was given? 2 plat 3's and 2 plat 2's and we got slammed. It's been so bad for so long I agree on the cap. If I solo queue don't place me against kids who are 1k elo ahead of everyone on my team??? gg ubi
---
But guys, ranked is out of beta...
---
Yup, July 6th 2018.
---
Good luck with that. 
---
This has been a massive issue with Rocket league and the wider community and the devs don't give a shit. And in that game it's worse cause it's cross-platform and ps/xbox players can make unlimited smurfs. 
---
I'm champ ranks across the board and I would say that IF you are versus a premade 3 man party, literally 1/2 or 1/3 of all games have a smurf in them. Classic ? profile picture and gold or plat rank queuing with Champ2 or Champ3 (like low GM in overwatch). 
---
Devs will never go for it in R6 either because it actually discourages people buying smurf accounts.
---
Yeah, that’s the thing, I started this game and first season I was gold so I went against better players, you need to play with higher ranks so you can get better
---

How did a copper 4 do better than a plat 3
---
This is actually been a huge issue on PS4 and hopefully Ubisoft implements some sort of system to helps stop this.
---
👍
---
Now Castle will see a series is Ubi nerfs
---
Make sure you get more kills than deaths usually works
---
get more kills lol
---
No I’m not get any joy from winning a match because you wanted to play with your friends who are far below in rank, there is no exact way to fix this because to many people play with “friends” and to many options that can’t satisfy everyone
---
Git gud
---
This season for ranked is absolute shit, can we get an Operation Health 2?
---
sucko mode
---
They were searching for glitches
---
Check your graphics card my guy
---
We do though
---
When they're EU and have high ping on NA servers, it's kinda ping abusing. You'll have the advantage because you can be around a corner and kill someone before they can even see you.
---
Booting the server is different from booting one person specifically. You can’t do anything about the server being booted but it doesn’t kick you out of a match.
---
Im on ps4
---
Yeah I play a warmup game in case then after that I always mess about and I'll always come across toxic teammates who tk then since they're a 4 stack vote kick me, kick me bc I clutch a 1 v 5 by playing obj or bc I cant answer them quick enough when I join a match. I get so pissed people 4 stack andnthose people that I come across are dicks they always kick the 5th player who joins whether it be instantly, not playing well or playing too well
---
I’m disappointed and proud
---
No.... It's not the same, Overwatch has a max ELO difference, Apex uses highest ELO in the party and allows anyone to queue with anyone.
---
Looks balanced to me?
---
Nice! Im gold 1, gt:illumanti33676 
---
Hmu sometime.
---
To be fair, Ash, Bandit and Jager are in pretty much every match regardless of rank or skill level. Jager and Bandit don't really have any other operators to replace them, and Ash has an insanely good gun and helpful utility.
---
Or 4 stack of people throwing, it's super common in silver and gold for whatever reason
---
Mate it's insane , the Screenshot I think I gotten is literally the same !
---
Well you could make an attempt to hide the information because it happens on console too

This game is crap..no wonder it will never be a top selling

---
ok I thought you meant they ddosed you not the server. Ubi really needs to better with their server security so that won’t happen anymore.
---
OP4 drone has seen a ghost
---
Maybe we can take a jack and penetrate the wack crack so we can attack from the back
---
Ash is a better fragger than Ying.
---
Server tampering fair use violation and and in the us the servers ubi rents out is on the same network as a few us servers for the military so yeah kinda of a bad idea
---
I don't see what you question was solo queuing ranked and came across this great bunch of people . Enjoyed playing with them and wish to play with again hence till we meet again
---
I see you played the 2019 LA Lakers.

Lesion
---
If you're a diamond and you play with friends in gold, I'm still going to hate you but I respect everyone wants to play with friends. If you play with anyone below silver you need to rethink your actual skill level.
---
Your ps4 might be done if it happens in other games
---
I agree but I feel like a Silver cna play with Golds and Bronzes, Where as Plat's can play with golds and diamonds. I feel like you should be able to play in the sill group above and below you. Gold's get better due to facing plats but can still play with silver friends. Plat's can get better by vs'ing diamonds but can play with gold friends. And well coppers can only play with coppers and bronze and diamonds can only play with diamonds and plats. I feel like it's a bit more fair and offers you a opportunity to play with friends in a lower skill group.

Only in r6 and its gone after that match
---
This is almost sad
---
Andother issue with this is the amount of smurfs there are.  I am a diamond on console and sometimes I play with my irl buddies just for fun.  We lose more games than we win but I still get called a booster.  Now if u weren’t able to play with them Bc of my rank I’d just make a smurf and boom, problem solved.
---
Sorry to disapoint you
---
Clearly not a real copper. Just a friend taking one for the team. This will be a premade with the diamonds only in diamond because friends go on second accs and smurf to drop the team mmr.
---
where’d you get the helmet with the visor
---
Why are you defending them? It’s because of players like these I am unable to play a game I love and this is one of the biggest problems on console right now and ubi, Microsoft or Sony aren’t doing anything about this, I have to reach out to massive platforms like this sub-reddit just to hope someone at ubi realised how bad this issue is
---
Your fucking with them right?
---
They ddossed you or the game? Btw i dont think they can do much because of their servers
---
Kill people and don’t die lol
---
Oh hey Monty, nice Sayori roleplay.

Wow this had my dead ☠️😂
---
Insane
---
If you don't have a job, college, or don't have many responsibilities to worry about. Then yeah it's ez.
---
Trust me it happens infrequently but it still happens regardless and it completely demotivates me to play this game
---
Ik I said I agree that ubi should do better with server security but booting the server doesn’t boot you out of a game.
---
Looked you up and couldn't find you.
---
It doesn't matter. We are still there.
---
We are the best

"What were they doing?"

They were underestimating your power, that's what.

You are a great human being. I was hoping the other 2 would keep up their name calling and insults 💯😂
---
Yup... I recorded this last night
---
Ela is one of the worst operators in game by far due to her 0 buffs and 6 nerfs.
---
Way worse than peekers advantage, revert it please.
---
I have no reason to lie to bitch about losing on siege to players who are clearly better but the fact is there are so many players that are using external ways to win shows the absurdity of the absolute desire to win and I’m sick of it
---
You didn’t state that you were solo queueing. 
---
A screenshot of a bunch of usernames and a very vague title is bound to spark questions lmao
---
Have you seen how the glitches are done?
---
Maybe lower your ads sensitivity my guy, seemed to be very erratic
---
The poeple I played with were toxic and would yell at each other, one rage quit, I matched with them and solo queued twice, I got sliver 2, I gave them another chance and played 3 or so games with them, I got deranked to copper, these were the only poeple I played with.
---
You can check my rankings, I was gold 1 1 game from play last season after solo queuing and then getting into a 17hr vortex. Magic.Nuke is my IGN.
---
Ya they just want to chill out and not lose.
---
what do you mean by legendary?
---
He's boosting by abusing the matchmaking system by getting a bunch of extremely low ranking teammates which makes it so he will play against extremely low ranked opponents who he has an extreme advantage over in experience and skill. Ruins the game.
---
*Y O U ' V E    B E E N     S P O T T E D*
---
In the options menu you can switch game modes on or off, so if you don't want to play bomb turn it off.
---
Gold out of an Alpha Pack is legendary
---
Not to defend anyone, because people who purposely matchmake with lower ranks than them are cheesemongers, but diamond level ranked is complete AIDS. I’m a diamond on PS4 who uses a standard DualShock 4. The amount of times that I get DDOSed is insane. It happens about 20% of the time. I’m sick of it. I don’t want to be playing at this ELO level anymore. 
---
That said, I’d never queue with people who drop rank intentionally, but I do understand not wanting to play at diamond level right now.
---
You can set up 2fa with a Chrome extension. I did the same thing with mine and that works like a charm. BUT what I want to say is, go for 2fa.
---
Not new, been out for quite a while
---
DUDE TELL ME YOU WON! YOU HAD THE BETTER GUNS HERE
---
That would actually make sense, I'm usually plat 2 or 3 so switching region would probably place me as if I were unranked, so that would make sense then, thanks
---
Its distracting and causes stress that can lead to stupud mistakes. Just go on cams and try to help insted of being dicks
---
Restart launcher and game
---
Ounce i had a 1v2 against 2 diamonds and i was a silver
---
Yeah. Can you have two separate steam 2fa one on the phone and one on chrome? 
---
Is that what you are saying?
---
Hey pal, you just blow in from stupid town?
---
Wow
---
What they should do is they should match up the top ranked players on each team rather than the average of the two teams. So if a Plat wants to queue up with Coppers, they run the risk of playing a 5-stack of Plats, instead of a bunch of Golds and Silvers. Granted, those Coppers are likely just smurf accounts of actual Plats, so I guess nothing matters anymore. Also, quick life tip here: If you have a smurf account and you aren't making a living off of streaming this game, you need to go the fuck outside sometimes.
---
You'd think, but my group was yelling at each other constantly because they're so toxic and friends, one rage quit after a match, due to their blaming and poor callous I wasn't able to play as good and I also usually play an Intel Op like Valk, Pulse, or Lesion and my team helps me if I need it for fragging, I can do 1v2 and 1v1's pretty easily, but when your team doesn't care and is arguing it's hard to know what's going on.
---
Thank you, i appreciate it. Im Mira
---
Looks like the skill level of the beginning of the season of LoL
---
We had a warden, he came a little late
---
The moment the devs themselves laugh at the stupidity of their own designs yet do nothing about them you know you have a fucked game.
---
heres an idea, dont die and maybe we wont have this problem.
---
It wasn't heavy so i didn't mind, just more poses i could make

Or no because her pick rate went too high cuz they gave a 3 speed grenades and nobody played her how she should’ve been played.

Try H:50 V:60 Deadzone:10 and ADS: 25
---
Sad, but true
---
No but sometimes you get a gu mine anyways while getting an important wall. A great example of this is Border where a lot of Lesions put a gu mine at the door at armory wall.
---
Start at around 20-30V and 30-40H and around and 40 for ADS and work your way up or down. Siege isn’t a battle royale, you don’t need insane sensitivity.
---
He realized the error of his ways, but believed he couldn't redeem himself.
---
I think you are wrong, cavs pistol downs enemies even if its a headshot. I think thats it
---
A good jackal can ruin roamers on most maps. It's tough after playing him so much for so long and now I never get to play him.
---
They are making an entire new spinoff game surrounding Outbreak. It's going to be a Co-op game with Rainbow Six Siege operators.
---
We assume here that you CAN queue with lower ranked friends. The best method would be as you say, not being able to do so.
---
But under the assumption that you can, there isn't much you can do to make it fair for everyone.
---
Are they ?
---
Uuuh, tbh I don't really know if that's possible, but it should work in theory.
---
Well, just practice. Watch videos on strats, go terrorist hunt to practice and watch killcams. That’s how I got better, and especially on console aim is everything, because if your aim is good you are way above the curve
---
It goes to round 9.
---
You're that guy who constantly goes off by himself without droning aren't you

Play nomad and airjab her, play thatcher to disable her shield taser, claymores and effective too
---
ok. im dont really know how they do their servers. that's why i wanted to ask
---
Jackal taught him his ways.

That's the main reason why they don't show ranks in ranked
---

“It_Rook” you’re wrong there BUDDY
---
Pro League ready lol
---
Okay. Do you think it is safe to have 2fa only on Uplay and not steam?
---
My first was for the sasg
---
Can confirm, the only time my friend hit diamond was this way. Just play with some guy on his smurf who purposely dropped down to a really low rank.
---
And most of the legendaries will be duplicates or just the color pink in my case
---
So weird to see red camera flashes now
---
And you were still down 0-2
---
thanks, fixed it.
---
God damn buy the packs if u want the skins don’t expect ubi to give them to you for free
---
You play fuse so you probably do that a lot
---
True pain is being level 270 and literally 3/4 packs you open are duplicates.
---
Why r u golds playing with silvers tho in the first place
---
someone finally says it, thank you
---
&gt;sorry if you cant get to Gold

Nope just plat this season and last but ok, and you realize everyone starts off in gold at the start of a season right?
---
Thanks.

Incoming gladiator mains
---
Me (level 50 unranked) got pairs with low silvers against high plats.
---
You're right on the first point, but wrong in the second paragraph there. At least on console, I'm a plat 2, but I play regularly with people who are MUCH worse than myself and a few other friends of mine, simply because their in my friend group. We've spent countless hours trying to teach them the game and how to properly play certain operators and go about attacking and defending certain objectives, but when it comes down to it, their aim and pack of situational awareness is just something too much to overcome in any reasonable amount of time.
---
So yeah, people in the same friend group can definitely have a huge gap in skill.

You will never ever progress in the competitive ranked mode if you continue to play with average players. I learned from this and I found a team that are plat/diamond worthy. Anyone that I've known for a long time I play casual with or ranked on an alternative account. 
---
There is no other way unless your team gets better. They drag you down.
---
100% legit translation by a scholar:
---
“gimme dem toes”
---
Ok sweat
---
No in fact you get more depending how low the copper 4s are. If you have a copper 4 at like 500elo or -500 elo you’ll get more elo then ever. Say you only win like 20points an average game you’ll get like 50 if you que with super tank accounts
---
That would be almost so unreasonable like employ programmers and game desingers who can write a propper netcode or at least know that it is not a good idea to use an outdatet openworld engine like anvilnext for a fps shooter xD

Lucky bastard! Although Alibi's uniform just *goes* with her.

Happened to me today
---
Am I missing something?
---
I'm a sweat for saying I think an operator isn't good?
---
You're kind of aware of your surroundings, but please keep in mind that recoil control is one of the most important factors in R6. You shot the roof evrrytime you shot more than 10 shots. 
---
As a tip, go practice the recoil of your favorite operators guns in Terrorist Hunt. It enhances your map knowledge and at the same time you get a better feel for the weapon...
---
*slow claps in italian*
---
Is that copper? Lolwtf that is fucked.
---
Disappointed on the fact you didnt go double shotty
---
Nah you can't shoot through it but you can see easily through it
---
That’s what we want you to think
---
Why thank you kiddo
---
Thank you boi
---
Yeah, he didn't notice jackal sitting right next to him as he walks by.
---
It should make his friends go against higher ranks rather than him go against lower ranks
---
Thanks! I'm just weird that way, I'll literally reload on 30/31.
---
Why thank you
---
That's useful
---
League of legends ranked is pretty much just as bad
---
Yeah you probably shouldn’t have posted this
---
Well thank the lawd, one less broken thing for me to worry about.
---
If only i knew he wouldn't react at all.
---
the revolver is just a worse deagle, but it's not terrible either. it's good if your aim is good, but I take the P9 for efficiency
---
You’re fine lmao, I used to do the same, but also do not be afraid to rush in there, some of my best clips are the ones I make not trying!
---
Oh sheet
---
We were talking about his ability tho. At that point he’s only viable because he’s one of a few defenders with an assault rifle
---
Ok! I'll play 2-3 rounds of th before I play online. Is that what you meant?
---
Oh. Are diamonds so good that 5 golds can't beat 3 of them plus two bronzes? It seems like it would be an even match to me
---
Oof, bet he was salty
---
Awesome! I'll try and get some balls to do that😂
---
This shit infuriates me right here. I'm a copper4(last season was first and I instantly jumped in ranked. Soft reset hit me hard) soloq on Na. Popped over to EU and...I can actually play! In copper I'm dropping donuts and getting shredded.
---
Over on EU I'm about 2550mmr and it's EASIER! I'm pulling off strats and getting kills, winning way more games. These alt accounts need to be dealt with, they ruin the game for the lower ranks. It's frustrating as hell when the enemy team has 1 guy that can shit on everything. All we want us a fair shake but it sucks losing due to throwers and alts.

He didn't do anything. He just saw his teammate fail a "Bandit Trick" (where you place your battery before Thermite's charge goes off to destroy it). The Bandit was late, so the Thermite went off and killed him.

Yes, a warm-up is always good, but what I meant was to play TH to train yourself. So instead of alwas playing short rounds in casual or ranked, where some rounds you don't even fore your weapon, you play TH as Lone Wolf and just try to control the guns recoil. Benefits you when you play online later on as well...

Cav main here. It couldn’t have been caveira’s pistol because by only downing someone you get 75 points (50 for injure + 25 for Luison bonus). Also, if it were a headshot, 20 extra points would be added, making it 75 points. Anyway, i know this has already been cleared up by OP but i felt like y’all should know this. (:
---
Awesome
---
yeah they were
---
Finka would also be good.
---
Unfortunately no, it's based on an average of your squad, hence why you typically see 1 or 2 coppers with a plat/diamond.

Doesn’t have to be expensive to be fair, a lot of the guys cosplaying at con can do one of the easier ops for under £100

She is in pro league. She just doesn't get picked because she completely lacks mobility and/or kill potential which are the biggest factors in an operator for pro league.

“probably wont face that same team ever again”
---
Yes, you are going to face the same team again. Maybe not sequentially, but you will most likelt encounter them again.
---
And even if you dont encounter them again, you will encounter another team like them, or another team that has been unintentionally boosted into your bracket. 
---
As long as people continue to create teams consisting of different ranks, wether they intend to boost or not, the boosting problem will remain.
---
im redneck45acp on uplay
---
Yeah I have said it was bosg but that was a mistake I made it was actually the mk14 so sorry for the miscommunication
---
Oh it's only start problem , we dig deeper , we got ourselves a leaver or 2 leavers , it is not a fair match , but u still get the lose as it was 5 of u . I mean since 1st season Overwatch has very good thing , when you got yourselves a leaver it gives him time to go back into match , and then if you want to play it - you play it 5v6 but if you lose you don't get lose to your MMR
---
That’s why they WILL DO IT WHEN YOU EXIT, LEAVE, DONT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THAT ROOM. AND THEY GO UP TO THE WALL.
---
I agree with you, I'll see level 45 copper II's while I constantly get ranked High gold low plat every season, even in casual I’ll put my bare minimum effort and strategizing and I still shit on the enemy team, it’s not necessarily the players fault though, because the game has had such a long lifespan, and a consistently growing player-base, that even players that have played since launch are encountering new players nearly every game that don’t have a chance, it’s like a paradox the game has created in itself. Unfortunately I don’t really think much can be done, we saw the newcomer playlist introduced but it just gets filled with smurfs.

I guess I’m lucky enough to play with people who accept the advice then.
---
It doesnt matter if the ops are original or not
---
I agree
---
Nah I like him
---
Seeing as he’s banned every ranked game, idk if that’s a good move just yet. Thinking higher priced op now would save me in the long run.
---
This is why castle is a good op
---
It’s amazing how many times I could say the same thing for the person to understand the word “leave”

You've answered your own question. Vigil. Spawn peek, do it, join the darkside
---
I didn’t understand it either.

until I got scanned once while roaming, went back to OBJ, dodged a claymore, got hit by a ying and then trackal’d again

They can’t aim high to hit their dreams

hol up thats mine

Rule #1 in ranked, never play with 2 or less squad members, unless your in high gold or above

No I understood. I just didn’t realize you were playing with people who were that stupid.
---
Just say no homo

Spam and fish for headshots with the hi cap? Think thats what he means with shit aim.
---
Nøkk if u normally get headshots, don't get her if u normally kill by bodyshots. Dokkaebi is fun, her kit is somewhat different to other opperaters, featuring
---
- A dmr that's stupidly OP if u can aim
---
- A shotgun that for some reason has the range of a sniper
---
- An uncontrollable smg
---
- And finally making ur enemies moms or girlfriends (or both if ur into that :|)call at awkward times
---
Yeah I figured this out the hard way lol
---
Yup I noticed when half enemy team entered no noise since they shot the glass
---
No I don’t but that’s what I would do to annoy you and not be able to tk for the rest of the game.
---
He should have a shotgun primary and a shotgun secondary
---
I see 0 problem
---
No one:
