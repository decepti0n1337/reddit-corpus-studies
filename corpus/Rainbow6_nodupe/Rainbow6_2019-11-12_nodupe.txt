I wasnt saying it was I was aaying in general, why are you being so defensive?
---
---
---
Lava you get it with season 4 pass
---
Bro thx, if you hear anything lmk, otherwise I'll just look around when I get there ig
---
Almost enough to make me want to play Ranked.
---

---
I'd definitely wear one of these... if not for the fact I'd have to replace my AnneMunition charm.
---
With the reports that the new aug A2 doesn’t get an Acog while IQ gets to keep hers it shows ubi found a way to balance the same gun different across multiple operators. That was my main complaint being the balance. 
---
As long as there’s still a drip feed because the new bolt sniper is really cool I’m fine with reusing guns. To be honest I kinda like the ability to re use skins instead of needing new ones too.
---
This iq headgear would be amazing [iq](https://imgur.com/gallery/kSuFqug)
---
You ban Amaru instead of Maverick/Thatcher and you are even more complicated. You ban Maverick or Thatcher and now you have Kali. Holding the exterior reinforcement is going to be impossible
---
Because your saying it was faked while having no reason to say it is
---
It’s called Meltdown Montréal if you want to check it out.
---
I mean, I don't think he can continue.
---
Is this not on the console version? I’m pretty sure I’ve seen it on PS4
---
I do think she should have a replacement weapon to lower her skill floor but I think most people just don’t know how to play her properly.
---
Anyone wanna hop on rn
---
Your aim is doodoo
---
Yeah no problem next time you will know how to write it :)
---
Wait who is BostonBearJew
---
Can you show me the back? For research purposes

Uh

I'll look at it when we get closer

Literally what made glaz broken, sorry but no

I use to play with Boston a bit, he subbed in for my ESL team a few times. Guy was the nicest guy on Rainbow. Always loved this tribute to him
---
I love both mainly for the tcsg , I use goyo when I wanna focus on fragging and kaid when I wanna anchor, today I popped two 5ks with them with the tcsg its amazing
---
No you absolute pea brain I said I hate it when PEOPLE say that they have #leet skills when its clearly faked or the person clearly didnt want to kill them. People, as in the general population. So once again, why so defensive bud?
---
yeah, played alot and improved to the point i get only +-40 points but still climbed up to plat now. Feeling Great \^\^
---
Imagine the panic of the enemy team just watching their teammates vanish and then seeing 2 sledgehammer kills on the killfeed
---
Well, a while ago, two bundles for the GIGR were datamined.
---
**Right, after reading all the comments (thanks BTW) I'm gonna update this with more detail.**
---
Theres the test server going on to make sure the new updates dont break the game. 
---
The live release is in around 3 weeks.
---
lil loopy on those shots, this boxer does not approve
---
There is a test server where the patch comes out early to test for bugs and to balance the new ops and map
---
Test server, theyll be out in 3 weeks give or take
---
It's just to easy when you spam it like a handgun
---
Technical Test Servers on PC
---
What? How do you do things on that? Or is it just taking your game data and putting it into the arcade machine?
---
The new ops are on the TTS which is only available on PC

I would like new guns after 2 back to back seasons of recycled content and still there’s a new leak that next seasons ops will also get recycled guns so I’m mad about it.

Attacker: new sniper and pistol and cz
---
Defender: aug mp5k and i cannot remember check the patch notes
---
wait
---
Alright fair one mate. I don’t make a habit of leaving but sometimes it can’t be avoided. It might be tricky to implement a fair system that only penalises serial quitters.

Thank you

Shifting Tides has just entered PTB, given the typical timeframe its likely to be Early December if the time on the test server goes well.
---
oh no
---
Like I said it’s not the best map and will be harder with Kali but the argument you used with Amaru is not really a god one to point out the issues with chalet.
---
You know it's a 3D real time scene ? so the perspective can't be fucked (and it's not fucked at all, i don't know what you see here).
---
So hopefully Zofia gets one next!
---
Oh ok
---
I heard that the defender is gonna have GIGN MP5.
---
Make her smg at least good again
---
If you wanna know the story on why his name is there just look up his name, the reddit post talking about it should pop up
---
[a link for you](https://youtu.be/_bW4vEo1F4E)
---
Ok thanks
---
Yes
---
I think it’s too early to be calling for buffs/nerfs. Also, the range in the MAG-NET is apparently the same as Jäger’s ADS.
---
I was wondering why she sounded so different.
---
It kinda doesn't matter to me. Now if they changed a voice as iconic as Thatcher's...
---
Valid my ass, in real life, they would be sniped in the head by overwatch
---
mmm
---
She shouldn't have given you the last chance.
---
Yep the rest looks very ugly though.
---
Noooob
---
It may be early, but just feel like its things to be looking at. Time will definitely tell. I feel like the magnet has more range than an ads, on skyscraper i could blow out a section of wall where top floor trophy is and cover both door ways as well as half the room. I dont think that Jager has that reach.
---
Well i mean yea, ive only been playing for like a month and a half.
---
Communism
---
At first i thought it was fake but my god that looks amazing well done

Good thing it’s a video game and not real life

Ok thanks. I figure its not too bad to get 50k renown every 3 months hey?
---
Okay I'm getting really sick of this. One just because a guns good doesn't mean it's overpowered. Two it is the lowest damaging primary shotgun in game asides the AA-12 which is an fully automatic shotgun. It has a pathetic drop off range and is the worst shotgun again for range asides the AA-12. Not only is it the lowest damaging shotgun, and one of the worst for range. It has very high recoil. Low damage, low range, high recoil. All of those being countered by it being the fastest firing shotgun. Asides the double barrel as that's a double barrel. But when you look at it, it's nowhere near overpowered. In the right hands it can be sure. That's everything. The top players in the game can make Ela actually viable in a match even when she's one of the weakest operators in game. But the FO-12 isn't overpowered it's very balanced. Low damage, low range, recoil being high. Balanced out by high fire rate. Ela doesn't need a nerf. That'd be her 9th one without a buff. Which in the end would make her the worst defender in the game for viability. And all of what I just said is going off stats with the extended barrel. Note I've copy and pasted this from another of my own comments where someone else made the same notion of the fo-12
---
How fuck high are you right now
---
Check her post history and there’s a good shot there.
---
They removed bombers though, right?
---
“Some poo’s come out” - you probably

Noice cool cool cool cool cool

Are we not gonna talk about how he shoots two guys, granite three armors, with a shotgun point blank, yet they just go DBNO and don't die.
---
Says the fortnite player
---
I believe they're for the Greek operators that leaked a few days ago before Kali and Wamai got revealed, I've been waiting for Greence since Year 2, Hoping to get Sweden but i doubt it.
---
Terrible idea, you want to nerf the rifle into oblivion
---
Fair enough
---
I bought the game on epic games

Yeah I know I play since Y1S4 (Red Crow) on PS4 (I'm on PC since Y3S2 Para Bellum) the first Uniforms was KT Cobra on FuzeI think and after that Blood Orchids uniforms come ^^

O shit

Possible. I'm just saying, nobody knows now because it wasn't officially announced.

Yes I know, I clearly understood that...I can still respond
---
I think this would have a major impact on wait times maybe at the end of a match or at the main menu you could view all players from the last 5 games and you could do a temp ban on them that would last 3 games and possibly have a permanent list where you could have up to 10 or 20 players
---
You legit said that is not how you play. If that isn't, then what is? You're basically forging the argument towards telling people how to play. Stuff doesn't work like that, and not everybody lives in America.
---
real one for not snitchin
---
Please
---
if Ubi wants us to use warden and glaz they should do these steps
---
1. Remove the "stay still to use gadget" thingy for warden and glaz
---
2. give glaz back his claymore mine
---
3. give glaz a burst rifle alternative
---
if warden can move while using his gadget he would be one of the best defenders in my opinion and glaz will be used more
---
That’s fax
---
he was actually plat 2, so for his rank he wasn’t half bad.

All operators are unlocked for testing on the TTS.
---
You're not wrong.....
---
im going to let you guy in on a little secret. any time a game developer says "we cant do [x]", especially a developer like ubisoft that using an in house engine, what theyre actually saying is "our code is so spagitified that if wr tried to do that, we could break something else, so were just not going to bother". specifically, in ubisofts case it means "yeah, we could fix our code. but its more lucrative to just sell overpriced weapon skins."
---
the fuck does the leader of china have to do with a japanese character?
---
His name is on the side of some of the cabinets too
---
Mmm, brazilian BBQ 😋
---
It's been said multiple times
---
Still remember grinding like 20 rounds to get a charm from a free pack
---
What is this?
---
He looks like he has mild down syndrome.
---
Finka with the LMG. Enough bullets to compensate for missed shots and her ability basically halfs the recoil on your gun. 
---
For defense someone like lesion or rook. Helps the team out even if you die and the guns have low recoil.
---
Hello Winteehh,
---
Got this on the test servers. Icon next to Buck says, "Y5S1 ATK NOT READY FOR TESTING"
---
I found another one
---
u/CoreRoss
---
Check the MP5
---
Ok thanks.
---
Gonna have to disagree with you on Ela, her SMG has so much recoil that someone with shit aim won't be consistent with it.
---
The CCP regularly stirs up hate against the Japanese to defect from domestic issues. For example anti-Japanese propaganda went into overdrive after the Tienanmen Square massacre, and WW2 atrocities are regularly brought up as a crutch every time the Chinese economy is facing challenges. The Chinese hate the Japanese - or more specifically, they are indoctrinated to hate the Japanese. 
---
So yes I know she's Japanese, that should have been clear when I literally wrote out the word "Japanese" in the original post. 
---
tldr; it's a fucking joke, because Xi doesn't like Americans or the Japanese, or profanities. But I guess the humour is lost once you've had to explain it like that. 
---
This is where, in an attempt to save face, you counter with: well the joke wasn't even funny to begin with. Feel free to just copy and paste that.
---
So Year 5 S1 defense OP going to be using Buck/Frost pistol? I wonder what else might be accidentally be left in the TTS?
---
Worst part is lesion can fit in lions back pack
---
Montagne and Clash. Their role is to protect their team, and they are very useful even if they don't get kills. Traps like Frost and Kapkan can also get easy kills with their traps.
---
So make it have the range of a real shotgun.
---
Yet another year of Ubisoft recycling guns.
---
the only way i would see it getting reworked is to make it more accurate to the mount carmel center (what it's based off of) in Texas
---
Then that means the other British operator we seen in the Olympics trailer is mute with the goatee off to the right hand side.
---
Whats your idea of a "typical" indian accent? Cause depending on the region, levels of english education and how they learned english, people will have different accents.
---
How original
---
Same feeling bruv, same feeling. I atleast need one more game b4 I'm plat but I'm garbage
---
Arbitrary nodding restrictions makes no sense and leads to every gun looking the same.
---
We should be able to make our guns look how we want it.
---
Shut up
---
Yeah i found the MP5 too
---
I would die of joy
---
The Arx won't gave Nomads airjab launcher attached to it, maybe we can put grips on this one? Also I have the suspicion that the defenders mp5 won't have an acog, because if it did, I couldn't see anyone using the spas-12
---
Well what's your play style? Do you like to sneak or go in guns blazing?
---
*how*
---
He's probably replying that because you're just being a bit of a dick for no reason for someone who's trying to help.
---
No, I'm not pro league.
---
However, I am 1,200+ hours into the game, earned diamond 5 times and never cheated once to get there whilst going up against MnK DDoSers. I'm ps4 and have never touched a MnK, CronosMax/Xim4, scuf controller and never DDoSed anyone.
---
So I don't really get the value of your comment. Seems very flippant and completely useless to the community and conversation.
---
Maestro, Maverick and Kaid are all great it depends on your play style on who you pick
---
It’s every 3 months there’s a new season. I heard it releases December 3rd.
---
That’s pretty neat
---
Hello CHIGGA_Town,
---
Is the mode coming back?
---
Yeah, there’s no way to get the test server on ps4 or xbox at all
---
I mean, you're not wrong - I just wanted to temper people's expectations.
---
I mainly solo queue, though, so take what I say with a grain of salt.
---
It depends on your play style if you like to rush in then yes I would recommend
---
But if you like to support and stay back I don’t think it’s a good idea
---
Wow you wasted all that energy to make that big reply to me, thanks mr. Pro league I'm flattered
---
Did you do article 5?
---
We tried to kill the hostage in cool ways
---
Oh understandable
---
Wait for next session. The defender will be a good buy
---
I solo queued to diamond so go ahead with whatever line of bullshit you keep feeding yourself
---
Ya I was thinking about getting Mav and Alibi... I just watched a vid about Maestro and Kaid I would consider Maestro but Kaid is just really Bandit but better
---
If you get a skin for Valkyrie’s shotgun the same icon appears. More reused guns... yay..
---
bro is this supposed to be sarcastic?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
should have included an extra /s for good measure
---
Quick question. When you’re in the TS to test new ops do you get them for free (to test not when the new season arrives)
---
Reason she is picked is for the shotgun - which is shown by her winrate. 
---
There is no way to “control” a weapon that has no recoil diamond or has RNG recoil. It is mechanically impossible, which is why it is not competitively balanced.
---
The smg has no ability for range unless the smg is put on semi auto, it already has low damage and as stated previously has terrible recoil. 
---
The pistol is fine, I’m just pointing out it’s stats.
---
Nope they are doing a separate game for it
---
He left lmao
---
These are all really good except for Ela's
---
I lean towards no, in my opinion she is pretty useless right now I would save that renown for the new guys but it's just my opinion
---
you star! Thank you for this.
---
It’s an annoying thing but if you play with a friend there is far less chance you will be kicked
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
No problem
---
To be your first ace it was really good! The first kill was actually so smart.
---
Nvm new leaks of the skins show that it’s sledge
---
Not first ace, first 1 v 5, but thanks nonetheless!
---
Thanks!
---
Quarantine is a separate Rainbow Six game, that comes out somewhere in 2020. These charms are merely an integrated advertisement, just like Wildlands, The Division skins, Breakpoint and The Division 2 charms.
---
Good idea ty
---
Check the MP5 and Valkyrie’s Shotgun. The same icon appears there as well
---
Uh what about skyscraper haha
---
Ty!
---
Awesome, ty
---
You're very welcome. Hopefully less of a dick next time 👍
---
fuck this elite is so good
---
Omg so beautiful and well made! &lt;3
---
Yea i like finka, ill practice with her more :) ty
---
What can I say, I am what I eat
---
Cav vs IQ boxing match please.
---
I got confused with the names and thought outbreak was the one that was coming out next year
---
Need to be on mobile
---
I first thought that in Phantom Sight the charm was just the gemstone but NOPE they had to put the shitty stone and make it bad.
---
Each and every man under my command owes me one hundred nazi scalps! And I want my scalps! And all yall will get me one hundred nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead nazis, or you will die tryin.
---
Yep. Multiple times. Even complained to ubisoft and that blamed my connection pretty much
---
What rank are you?
---
What is everyone’s thoughts on Fuze? I main him and I think he could use a little buff maybe on a faster deploy time or maybe a more consistent AoE of the cluster charge because sometimes the nades reach the other side of the map and sometimes they can’t reach the other side of the room.
---
It wasn’t funny to begin with
---
Coming from someone who play Thunt a lot whenever i played as Jager the terrorists would never throw anything if I put the ADS down, Since they're introducing Wamai they're more likely to throw things at the players.
---
hush you. your opinion is meaningless.
---
Lmao
---
Fuck you!
---
not really a leak since its on TTS and it was show at pro leagues
---
*Blackbeard left the chat*
---
*Whitebeard joined the chat*
---
meaningless....
---
And it’s a kill you should be proud of. Welcome to Siege!
---
Has to be copper lmao
---
That’s not for you to decide
---
Thank you!! 🥰🥰
---
Didn’t wanna be rude but that bandit should have killed him and so should have the Valkyrie
---
i just did
---
That is ridiculously good. It honestly looks like it could be a promo for an R6 TV show.
---
But now shotguns deal 75% damage to limbs (65% to 3 armor attackers)
---
If she needed one, Ubisoft would've already done it, they have the metrics and data to help with that.
---
While I don't think Ela is the best defender in the game, not by a long shot, I think she's underrated and a solid pick for any comp. 
---
I wouldn't be opposed to a buff, however I just don't think it's necessary.
---
holy shit you nailed it
---
So next years first attacker will absolutely use the G36C? Nice
---
Her gadget is actually her Lusion pistol, that's why when there's a gadget challenge for the weekly challenges Cav can complete it easily by either interrogation or just killing with Lusion.
---
It’s completely necessary considering she’s the only operator without a recoil diamond.
---
I mean, all the CPU/GPUs that support vulkan must show an increase in performance, right?
---
Well the hostage didn’t win, thats for sure.
---
bruh
---
also +10 for superhero entry while doing so :)
---
Well there is a skylight there...
---
I got a kill today with it . Fuckin +20 for that
---
Awp or Ak ?
---
Think half potato is more smarterererer than a potato
---
Facts: im a potato too
---
If he carries 4 car batteries into battle you’re a bit foolish to assume he doesn’t also take a crack pipe too
---
What was the last win screen on bank???
---
omg you can use it to kill unsuspecting defenders too sometimes. I totally forgot that. +30 for supa kicka
---
I dont play ranked, but last season I was an amazing bronze 4
---
Want AWP
---
Mine is ember rise I’m down with the flowers.
---
Yeah I killed a frost who just finished putting down a mat. I died as well but it was worth it
---
Older cards weren't designed for vulkan.so you won't benefit there.
---
Newer cards will
---
What about gta online? That game is full of toxic tryhards and griefers.
---
Thx
---
Gotta say, i checked once and miras thiccness doesnt seem to be Bad
---
Fuck yes haha
---
Its not rigging the game, Thats her normal recoil, The Vgrip is the issue that adds in horizontal recoil while reducing vertical recoil. Which is useless if you know how to drag the mouse down.  
---
She is in a good spot for higher ranks, She is a CQC based fragging operator that can take on multiple attackers at a time. Thats what she was made for from the start. The mines are just there to help her guns. 
---
In consoles they need to reduce the recoil due to how the recoil management is harder using controllers. But on PC she is in a ok place. 
---
If they reduce the mag size and reduce the recoil, Operators like vigil and abili will be a better pick for the even lower recoil and good rate of fire. (The storm is a 950rpm gun). That completely removes the whole point of why Ela is in the game.
---
Do you get renown for being in gold 9r diamond at the end of a season?
---
Respect+
---
Or like a relaxing seashore with waves
---
No ACOG, No Problem!
---
Not ok
---
Trust me it's a massive factor

Black ice bronze was my very first charm

Didn’t seem that big to me when I changed from my 60 inch

Seven... Hundred!

If you need help with gear ask r/gaming
---
I think she is more a hatch mover than an entry attacker.  Seeing the amount of times she get doomed flying in.
---
It’s basically a new gun - how many people run SPAS 12 right now?
---
Honestly, I'm just trying to drop acogs from my playstyle as a whole.
---
It's hella tough after maining acogs for 2 years.
---
So Zofia can deny interrogation by whistanding while cav does the interrogation animation? I don't really get what's going on
---
What you mean ? Wamai gadget only takes 1 projectile per gadget, it is shown in the trailer.
---
Man died and this was maybe to honor him
---
Every decision made by the new balancing team has been completely terrible. Under their watch almost every op has been DOA and they have completely destroyed ops like Glaz and Echo.
---
I don’t have to imagine. And it’s pretty great tbh
---
I wouldn't know. I've only played one assassin's Creed, and that too only partly, and even then, years ago. It wasn't my kinda game.
---
Reminds me of the division logo
---
.______.
---
HOT
---
Only played a few months. Why is everyone hating skyscraper so much?
---
Very well done
---
Honestly I'm fine with this, didn't dislike it but I didn't care for it either. Getting shot from across the map because of a biggie balcony was never the greatest.
---
Side note: Does anyone have the causal map pool, i thought i saw that plane and house were getting taken out again and i wanna check to see if i have to play casual a shit ton before Shifting Tides in order to enjoy them.
---
I wish they didn't
---
3 speed ops make the game more like COD which I personally don't like. So more 2 speeds and 1 speeds please ubi
---
The game is super alive and in a healthy state atm
---
Ive been saying that since he was released.
---
5v1 : gg guys 
---
4v1 : yeah we still good don’t worry
---
3v1 : uhhh I guess he’s pretty good 
---
2v1: what is happening?
---
1v1: guys?
---
*death*
---
Buck
---
Do you play dokkaebi?
---
Pay 2 Play with 0 Prizes, no thanks.
---
She should alreafy get nerf-counter like 4/5 armor characters (with rook armor) or boosted over 100hp will survive the torso shot. 
---
I mean, I think she will join jackal in attacker ban rate
---
I'm personally just happy to have another op to run the Bartlett U skin on.
---
I think the next is Ela's elite which will release before the current season ends.
---
Looks nice
---
It was season 3 year 2
---
I could honestly see people making her work on Fortress assuming you have people covering your back. There's quite a few long hallways which would be perfect for her to hold while others push in.
---
Was this a ranked game per chance?
---
Cute sketch.
---
Really well done nice work!
---
That’s absolutely amazing especially the gun skin, it looks so similar.
---
Thank ya
---
DROP AWP men
---
Not this shit again...
---
I have yet to hear them, is there a YouTube link I could follow to hear it?
---
I like it too, even though the balance is questionable, I love it for its cqb fights.
---
I have their voices muted, it just adds more audio clutter.
---
&gt; why would I try to reach higher in plat when it's hard facts that I wi never reach diamond
---
I don't get this, is the only reason to play ranked for a charm? Because playing in high plat 2 or plat 1 is a world apart from plat 3. I play in those ranks to have fun and close competitive matches, that's what I mostly play Siege for.
---
I've heard about this  ut I've never seen it
---
https://youtu.be/B3MNO2C5FAE
---
Cheers
---
Oh.
---
Nice.
---
Hopefully this means they might buff the Spas 12
---
I agree with you but this idiot sub thinks outback is a good map because it has good defense sites, yes they fail to realize all 4 sites are really good and hard to attack.
---
Yikes
---
bruh just escaped from an old timey prison
---
Noooo I was hoping she would have a cool MVP screen and at the end throw her knife into the screen...
---
In my experience, the PC community is a lot more mature. I’m not sure how their ranked attitude is, but I’d expect a lot more coordination as the ranks get higher on PC ranked.
---
I’ve got like 200 hours on PC but 1100 on console, so in comparison, I will wholeheartedly testify that R6 players on console are clueless and toxic most of the time.
---
The best thing that you could do for your team is to really identify what exactly your role is, how the team dynamic is working out, and what you can do to help out.
---
Most of the time my friends on console get very tilted and upset after a loss, so most of the time I solo queue into ranked. As a result, over the years I’ve improved significantly, but my K/D is grounds for mockery. Like I said, I don’t know how the PC ranked community compares, but if it’s anything like Xbox, I’d expect to be made fun or or get some kind of toxicity.
---
Overall, the best advice I can offer would be to support the team however you can. I know that sounds broad, but here’s an attempt to explain:
---
•Not doing so hot on kills? Switch to a more defensive play (or roam if you get killed anchoring) and play ops who compliment your teammates/carry well.
---
•Teammates keep dying before you? Make a note of how soon they die, and identify how the enemy plays.  In my experience, it really feels like most enemy teams either play for KILLS or the OBJECTIVE.  The sooner you can figure that out, the better you’ll be able to adjust to their plays.
---
•Practice Calming your Nerves.  This might sound stupid to some people, but oftentimes failed clutches are the result of the jitters or fake-outs that the enemy team pulls. The calmer you are, your senses are gonna be able to pick that up sooner.
---
•[Related to the Play-Style tip I mentioned] See If the enemy team you’re playing against is a 2-stack or higher. Pay attention to who the enemy team bans. A lot of the time when the enemy team is playing with friends, the bans can give you a clue as to how they’re going to be playing. For example, if the enemy bans Ela or Lesion, you might be on guard for an early rush. Or if they ban Thermite/Thatch, they may be preparing for a push from only one specific wall or direction. Change it up!
---
Overall, the biggest thing that’s gonna help you is experience. Practice makes perfect!
---
Sorry for the huge paragraph. I hope these tips help you out! If you want any more, feel free to message me!
---
casa de papel collaboration? i’m out of the loop, can someone fill me in?
---
glad some people on this sub have a brain lmao, that map might as well just be a coin flip at the start and let that decide who wins
---
Y5 season pass skin is probably the alabaster one
---
Your pretty good
---
Bandit*
---
Don't care. Sometimes I do THunt and just stay on respawn as Monty while my team kills everyone.
---
Nightaven, Outer Haven, the two Operators wearing skintight suits like Snake... You may be onto something there.
---
Thanks, now I hate picking Hibana
---
yeah, that's what pubg has. or atleast I think it does; haven't played in a while.
---
Nobody:
---
Fat Cav:
---
While it would look cool and I know realism isn't that grounded in Siege. That kinda force would deffo break her legs and leave her sprawling on the ground outside
---
Console player.  Sorry 😒
---
Look I get it people want funny looking cosmetics and apparently don't want tacticool stuff but this is pretty fucking retarded.
---
Do you guys honestly think having santa in the game is cool? I'm generally curious.
---
But monty stole your ace
---
Man season pass skins this year have been wack. They should’ve at least made masks for the mask-less operators for season pass
---
Can't kick in ranked
---
No like I’m taking about leaving an auto clicker on and leaving the pc on overnight
---
Thanks, and yes, I imagined something like that after the "yes" answers to my question
---
I feel your pain. All I wanted was Kapkan headgear and uniform. Got the headgear but now he looks dumb with no black uniform. :( 15 packs and nope.
---
He's still a new operator, so it's not surprising he has a low win delta 
---
Also it's been stated several times that win deltas don't always mean someone is overpowered/underpowered 
---
Can you explain why he's underpowered?  Because a few people in pro league want him nerfed before next season
---
Chalet has shit rotates, and garage has gotten progressively worse with every new hard breach they add to the game.
---
This is not good at all. Recycling makes the game boring. I played this game for 1800 hours. But the game is getting boring because of weapon recycling.
---
Nice cosplay!
---
And happy cake day!
---
Happy to encourage lol we all have potato days and we all have great days 
---
Best to support newcomers too :)
---
* picks up a bullhorn *
---
football eeeh...
---
This looks really good! Nice work on the AUG too!
---
Pick Glaz, try 360-double-noscope-collateral-headshot, obviously fail, get shot in de head and die instantly, loose round, accuse them as cheaters and use their moms in every voice chat sentence.
---
Yup! Same. They’ve improved it so much since year 1. Glad I stuck with it, because it evolved so well.
---
I’d go for rook cause elas recoil will make her miss an entire mag and go for her while she reloads pog
---
You fucking nailed it, the helmet looks great and the AUG is sick. Happy cake day too!
---
Amaru is really situational in my opinion but for one who knows how to use her, she can be really unpredictable and effective in certain scenarios. And as for Nokk, she's decent in my opinion but just not thaaat meta changing. Warden tho xD
---
Where's your 1v5 ace video?
---
Repost
---
Everyone will be up on that platform now trying to get cheap shots through her holes
---
Who is Tracy Woo and the tallest dude
---
Commission pieces would depend on what you want.
---
F
---
Let's be real here.
---
How many ops this year were nerfed into release?
---
Gridlock- untouched, only getting an indirect nerf at wamai's release since he's a soft counter
---
Moz- still untouched
---
Nøkk- still situational, untouched
---
Warden- gotten buffed
---
Amaru- untouched (if I remember correctly)
---
Goyo- still a monster, still very strong, still untouched
---
Kali- (speculation) doubt she'll see a noticeable change since a LOT feel she's situational and map dependent. Even if she gets something, it'll be small because you can't do much to her gun and her gadget is a high risk one.
---
Wamai- this dude might be hit with a Nerf. The problem is, if this guy is hit, then Jäger rises back on top and he'll need to be nerfed,  and that can't be allowed either. So I can see him either seeing a Nerf (if needed, that is) on the TTS, or after 1 season.
---
So, doubt their "supposed" business model will hold good for this year. And especially considering that they'll be reusing guns, one aspect of the balancing is already sorted.
---
Console aside, this is a lot more of a legit ace than most of the clips that get posted on here. Good job.
---
high ranked players smurfing dont play like they usually do, you arent learning shit by getting outaimed
---
Kinda looks like the new tomb raider.
---
Technically OG operators like jager and twitch now have 3 PL sets. There was the season 1 universal weapon skin, year 1 PL set, and now this set
---
Or thermite to light HIMSELF on fire
---
And now I'm trying to figure out if my sub box is fucked and I haven't noticed if he has made a new upload
---
Please this
---
Nope, totally am. I just feel like I'm earning them at a reasonable rate.
---
Yoo tf, he looks like Matt Andrews, the Pro League host.
---
Or if you use equalizers to light that sounds
---
yes, i agree, but this was meant to look like the awp from csgo
---
Lmao. Nice clutch.

---
That pause omg
---
here we go with the maestro is better tachanka discussion again
---
Is it a bad thing?
---
Hard choice. Goyo is more for anchoring and off site hold. Moz is for roam.
---
I don’t relate the pilot program to PL sets, since you originally could buy the latter with actual money, not r6 credits.
---
Most likely you were already dead from server side but it took the server a little to let you know
---
I've played this game for 1800 hours and I'm getting tired of recycling weapons
---
&gt;stretch mark
---
Big lolz
---
depends on your playstyle but mozzie is easier to use good
---
I didn’t mention the team pilot skins. I’m only referring to PL skins

---
Clean clutch my dude, console player here as well, good job!
---
I've had a few so I know what the look like.
---
Personally what I've been doing the past few seasons is grinding to Plat 3/2 and then dropping and actually playing in low ranks throughout the season.
---
I do this because my ranks on console (Plat 2 the last 2 seasons) are completely infested with cheaters. If you're not going against a MnK then you're going against macro users, often times both. It's gotten to the point where it's literally 2/3 games and it has become absolutely impossible to enjoy playing in those ranks when you're not a cheater like me.
---
I genuinely hate doing, it's not some ego boost thing like many people think, it's genuinely just because it's the only way I can get games without going against cheaters.
---
Ever since I started playing Rainbow, I get tempted to shoot cameras when I see them in public....
---
Frost mains don't have opinions or rights stfu
---
But i can't get better if i just get runned over or get an instant headshot from a way better player
---
Well now we don't need IQ to find yokai drones
---
It’s under twitch for me. NA
---
I don't follow. Need explanation.
---
When your sensitivities are the same, your 360 rotation is the same, so what's lacking now? Why should they fov be accounted for?
---
The level 300 diamond is far more likely to do nothing but play ranked or unranked and is just playing casual to warmup, so they're MMR is lower than it should be on accident rather than on purpose, whereas the level 3 is almost always a smurf who is abusing the MMR system for easier matches.
---
It's unlikely that they'd do it with casual, but it CAN be done, it's just as easy to smurf in casual as it is in ranked. If not easier.
---
In live or tts? Cause I can't see it in twitch.
---
I mean, it was EVERYONE'S idea since she got released.
---
Live for me
---
like 7 gbs
---
Oh hell wait that's the penta set. My bad. For some reason, it looked like the PL set.
---
Just wait till you decide pc is better than console... you will land every headshot on those nerds.
---
You always run faster with a pistol in your hand and that gun is the biggest gun in this game so you should run slower
---
Turning a 1v5, into 5 1v1s
---
That's the Penta twitch set. It's out.
---
Man how can you fuck up such a cool character with this shitty animation, disappointing.
---
it would have cost you $0.00 to not say that and yet here we are
---
First, excuse the huge watermark, cause I just DLed the first free editor I could find.
---
So, as you can see I ran a straight 49m dash with :
---
1. the CSRX 300 : aprroximately 12 seconds
---
2. the P226 : approximately 10 seconds
---
3. the Commando 9 : 11 seconds
---
4. the C75 : also 11 seconds
---
5. (not included in the video) the super shorty : 11 seconds
---
So yeah I might use the p226 rather than the C75 because of its better iron sights and better potential for quick relocation.
---
Ubi has been slowing down the meta for nearly 2 years. Idk what rank you are, but to me (mid-plat to Diamond) most rounds take 2:00 to the full 3:00 minutes to finish.
---
While also animating unnecessary things that almost no one notices
---
No. hes the reason glaz became so shit he can fucking burn in a hole. Fuck warden
---
And my favorite map just got better
---
Now that we have the technology for bolt action, when does Chunky get a PTRD?
---
They're both 2 speed. Although I too would  like to see our tiny ginger run faster.
---
And I just wanted to point out something I hadnt seen mentioned anywhere
---
Tbh he’s probably copper or bronze
---
I’d nut if they gave this as her Elite. I’d sell my soul or a kidney to buy it
---
What happened?
---
Or maybe they’re all named Kyle
---
ok
---
Wait how is mozzie not a 3 speed wtf he’s so small lmao
---
Maybe, from my perspective Copper and Bronzes try to copy Diamond/Pros but they are just shit at it. Silver and Gold is where all the braindead plays work and I'd know, I was hardstuck there for my first year.
---
This is some Titanfall stuff, I would love it.
---
Just because "famous" people do it doesen't mean it's a good thing
---
Well that’s what I would have liked when I started. This is a little basic compilation of tips I gathered during my playtime. No problem!
---
In a way the entire team kinda of gets a part of the elite skin
---
Thanks. One more question, does pulse have a sledgehammer?
---
Everyone is a 1 hit to the chest. Limbs are like 75 damage. Her bullets are projectiles and not hit scan from what I’ve noticed.
---
yeah, it's mostly there so shield ops don't get instant kills when outnumbered, which encourages more cautious play.and still get one kill mostly for free.
---
I hope they would bring fortress back... I was just starting to like it.
---
So, I went and tried it with finka and the LMG seems to have no effect on running speed (though I will admit I couldnt record this time and thus my measuring is less precise)
---
Twitch is getting the dmr skin this time around too. Feelsbad that they're releasing proleagur skin's for guns nobody uses.
---
EpIcCCC
---
She is shadow boxing like a lil bitch
---
Nice headshots.
---
I sat there and waited for the video to start then realizing it wasn't a video
---
no
---
This would just make Amaru rushes more viable and then this sub would get spammed with Amaru rants. Imagine Ash rushing to 3rd flr but waaay faster. Dont forget Amaru got huge mag in her lmg.
---
Amaru is good where she is right now.
---
I dont assume anything about you, but on your way to plat with your smurf, you had to go through silver/gold games, which in the end ruined the experience of those games.
---
I know a lot of people smurf, but i still think its shitty to do so and i wish smurfing wasnt a thing at all.
---

---
😂 dude most smurfs are not iut there trying to beat up on the lower ranks thats boring where to busy trying to destroy each other so we can get to the top because we enjoy competition.  Bro i could careless about golds  and lower ranks i have zero care or desire to beat up on yall . I rather smack plat/diamonds because i can .
---
Any of them but the starter edition.  DO NOT BUY STARTER EDITION
---
Hopefully they'll make it available with renowns again. Also, I'm grinding for the last one right now
---
Some beautiful kills 😭🔥🔥😍😍.Welcome to Siege!
---
&gt;and btw, Monty's prroblem still isn't ADS time, it's his invulnerability to melee stun during the transition to and from deployed mode. 
---
True, which they should fix asap
---
Yea but not that broken especially if the range is the same
---
&gt;That could actually be powerful and not extremely circumstancul so good find
---
Thks)
---
Bruh, that’s really nice
---
No probs.
---
Pick up Hostie, place near magnets, get wamai to kill him.
---
No. This wud just reduce counters to her rushing.
---
60
---
[Here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/6vm4nt/thank_you_ubi_for_honoring_my_friend_in_such_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is the thread about him.
---
Too OP tho, but her gadget is pretty underwhelming rn
---
If he is Russian and he is angry he will be angry but in Russian.
---
Конечно.
---
It doesn’t destroy the projectile it will explode... and the magnet brings it to the hostage
---
Thought it was just me
---
Yeah mostly, that’s why I wouldn’t spend that much money on them (assuming they’ll be paid packs) and probably just save up renown
---
MLGs on the menu
---
Screams in blyat
---
Doesn't change the fact we still play as unranked for 10 placements ever season.  So is that unfair as well cuz we could potentially que slivers and bronzes and walk back to plat . Dude like think what your saying? It might be frustrating for those low life smurfs who beat up on lpwer skilled players to make them feel better but 90% of us just dont care about lower levels period.
---
Skin is not what he meant, Look at the ops that can use it. There is a placeholder Operator icon
---
You just admited that you like to ruin others games, just because it brings fun... Play T-Hunt if you like to play against bot that good opponents
---
I think they will, it was a nice move towards the community and got a lot of positive feedback. Get what you deserve champ!
---
starter edition isn't that bad, I bought it back in dust line and still had all ops and one seasonal skin + various other cosmetics until year 2 season 2 (because I played less). Maybe I played a little too much tho lol
---
##FOOOIOKIIIN LAIIIIZUUUUURRRRR SOOOIGHTZ
---
don’t be toxic,help new players.
---
Ah its the opposite to what i thought lmao. Cool.
---
The attacker i like, i always had an idea to have an attacker who basically just puts up barricades, but your version sounds better than what i had in mind.
---
The defender is going to be useless, and unfair; Shield ops are already easy enough to deal with, we don't need an operator that can just get free kills on them from the front, and i don't think we need a blackbeard counter either. Shield operators are absolutely dogshit when they cannot block damage, having abysmal ADS time, slow movement speed, being very loud and having no primary weapon; you do not need an operator that kan just ignore their sole strength.
---
tell them to stop
---
No such thing
---
Where
---
If you can, do the Fuze one that would be amazing!
---
😂 say what please state what i admitted too cuz your grasping for things that just aren't there
---
Two biggest differences I've seen between plat and gold is the fact that the best players in gold are those who can pretty much just aim well and the best players in plat are those who can use drones and cameras to gain intel and such. 
---
The experience I had in gold trying to make callouts and get people to listen to them was practically painful. While solo queing in plat I tend to find more people who try to make callouts throughout the match. This is probably why so many people want amaru to be a mindless rusher rather than someone who flanks  based off callouts and droning.
---
:)
---
I dunno what Frost is doing, but it doesn't matter.
---
She's too cute for this world.
---
Wow Ubi  u gotta hire this guy
---
This isa nessesity to have!
---
It’s also really loud tho
---
Yes it does
---
I’m plat 2. And I find long rounds enjoyable, it’s much more tactical and less of a just, use your ability once, rush the fuck into site and try to kill everyone. It’s a lot more slo gameplay, which imo is what siege is meant to be about. It’s not a game about rushing in randomly which is what most people would do with this Amaru change.
---
That's the whole idea?
---
Ok sorry sir...
---
Oh I'm on the WE servers, so unless u like heavy lagg I can't help u very much :(
---
Test server would be great
---
True especially basement can feel repetitive but bam phase definitely helps people like echo and Mira can get banned and really mix it up
---
Operator tips as there are none here:
---
1. Thatcher and soon kali, are required for a ranked experience with thermite and/or hibana
---
2. Play the simpler ops like rook, doc, mute, bandit, and jager for your five stack to start as they are pretty easy to play
---
3. Learn to bandit trick if you can! This is when you place the battery while a charge is going off
---
4. Learn maps as best you can and what ops are good on them
---
5. Get echo as soon as you can! He is probably one of the best ops in the game and is super good at denying a plant!
---
6. Get used to recoil and learn to control it! If you can hit your target you win your fight.
---
7. Maverick has no counters, watch out for his holes in reenforced walls
---
8. Reinforce the objective! If on bomb make rotates in between sites!
---
9. Make your freinds get some of the following defenders: lesion, maestro, valkerie, echo, Mira, and when he comes out, wamai
---
10. On attack get the following: zofia, nomad or gridlock, hibana, buck, capitao, maverick, and when available, kali.
---
11. Get used to the bullshit hit reg, smurfs, and other stupid shit.
---
12. Drones are literally worth their weight in gold on attack! Use them!
---
13. Learn call outs on some maps.
---
14. Information is needed to play effectively, use it well.
---
15.have fun and think of your own custom strats! This game has a learning curve but is fun!
---
Have a good day!
---
Still have my health charm
---
This is actually a great idea
---
Kali: Nerf will be coming from pro players perspective if anything. For majority 95%+ she will be fine. Gun becomes a problem in hands of those with fast reflexes and accurate aim, the ads time is so brutally slow and it trows atleast me off quite a bit and magnification is also so much it is hindrance, let alone speaking about zoom sensitivity what you might like quite lot more compared to other guns. I can see her power in hands of a pro and why she is rather problematic in that perspective.
---
Her gadget it more versatile but also bit on the weak side compared to tatcher. yes you can get value out ofd it but against bandit tricks it just wont do, not sure yet if trhis difference is a good thing or not. Lance might need small buff in speed for the explosion otherwise it might just be better to get sofia/ash/buck/sledge/iq to deal with batteries etc. Point is CSRX 300 will either make or break her for the most part.
---
Wamai: Well he feels just fine. MAGnet is more versatile but also more risky ADS alt.  I cannot see MN working well against spammed nades and flash bangs and you will run out of room to stack them on one entrance due explosion radius and stuff like that. Strong, useful and maybe just tad bit weaker also than jäger, but versatility offsets that quite nicely.
---
Bro... Pretty much everyone likes the lion and ela nerds... the fuck you talking about.
---
Nah dude I drone the room clear but it doesn’t matter because they can here the window get ripped off followed by the loud ass rappel from a mile away and run over to hit me perfectly as I enter
---
she has a secondary smg though..
---

Just a simple yes or no would've sufficed. Like he said, no need to be an as.

They're randos from disord. I didn't listen to them besides the kitchen callout.

when you post a benchmark score to boost your ego lul
---
I'd be indifferent to this change honestly. It'd still be suicide at high ranks. I haven't played Amaru at all really, but when I do I only use her to quickly get in a position early in the round, that I droned in the prep phase, risky for sure, but the best way to use her at a higher level. 
---
Kind of an unpopular opinion, but I've been liking the niche ops we've been getting, despite the balancing being questionable. Nøkk and Amaru are really quite fun to play in certain scenarios.
---
if you afk farm in t hunt lone wolf, you are okay. in fact, im t hunt afk farming rn. if you afk farm in multiplayer, uninstall r6, tie a noose, and beat ur wife with it because its still good for beating people
---
I would settle for it being the same as now except for not having her stand uselessly idle for half a second once she lands
---
[removed]
---
OP's idea only works for low level players who dont truly understand how to play Amaru. For high level players, it wud just be another Ash in the making, who can rush to the 3rd floor waaaay faster... Also, lmg with angled grip.
---
They’re fun, but your point of them not being good enough rushers is pointless.
---
Ive also got a sound decoy operator concept in the works :)
---
Yea, There are only 21 :/
---
+less sound pls
---
Correction: You get 21 but that's still reasonable.
---
I understand, everyone has their prefernces
---
Ok yeah makes sense
---
Lucky, I’ll always get to the 1v1 part and just forget how to aim
---
Either watch PL a lot, watch Pengu or similar Pros a lot, or just play a lot.
---
You'll learn with time.
---
If you want help with learning, you're gonna need to be way more specific about what you need/want help with.
---
Whenever I look at this thing I get halo sniper vibes
---
Is that an actual player?
---
AWP
---
I guess it's time to get interrogated by a boxing Lara Croft now !  
---
In the disappointment train too, tchou tchouuu \~
---
If you keep the delay before bringing up primary.
---
There is nothing wrong with having a second account. I can’t think of anything that intentionally ruins the experience of other players by that. 
---
I mean if you can’t beat them, you will eventually start to lose no matter what.
---
*Every time* **60% of the time**
---
Wait really? That's pretty interesting
---
you know what? fuck it armor deagle LETS GO- *headshotted*
---
Don't get me wrong, it's a good idea, just my personal tastes as you say
---
If Faze is universal, it's gonna be lit.
---
Agree
---
If you sell these as stickers I will totally buy them!!!
---
no we need dragon lore
---
I didn't mean the nerds were what the community don't like. I mean they'll tell you Ubi fucked up Amaru, Nøkk, Warden, Nomad and even Kaid to some extent. Yeah some of those are underpowered, but they are still usable in niche scenarios and some are overpowered, but not game breaking, Nomad maybe, but even then its no Blackbeard, Ela, Glaz rework, Lion level shit.
---
Just use secret star
---
We've known about these for at least a month through the cosmetic database, they're supposedly called Fractured Floe I think
---
Do be lookin fresh doe
---
no stop run outs happen usually from the same spots and you have drones
---
Maybe have all 4 corners broken? so its as if Amaru's grappling hook broke the corners of the barricade
---
I didn't make that point?
---
jager, Twitch, fuze, thermite
---
Except you’re wrong that’s not how they pitched it and if we want to make it more for that use I don’t mind bum it then it should be stealthier and quiet so going through hatches is a lot less obvious
---
Really? So if there’s no difference why even have a smurf account?? Why not only playing with the one? You hypocrite Fucking idiot! Do yourself a favor and stop talking.
---
It's another Chinese new year skin, like how we got the red Year of the Pig skin last year.
---
On my feet!
---
Ash on defense
---
Guy just got his first ace, give him a bit of praise. Or be a toxic cunt I guess
---
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RUSH B FFS!
---
Depends on how you use her, she can be used as an entry attacker really well if you know what you're doing, but even that's risky as hell, and for most, most of the time yes it's instant suicide. Umaru needs a buff.
---
I do feel like for this sort of operator to be introduced a direct counter would also have to be introduced on the defending side cuz having only Mute to counter this much Intel is gonna be questionable. Like if you are good at droning,and that takes skill, you can maybe get info on 2-3 players, now imagine getting pretty much the same amount of Intel with only the press of a button, this really needs something more and I do see the new operator or even Jager being able to destroy them since they are flying objects
---
Yea pretty much every unranked game I'm down a player or the other team is. It sucks
---
I’ve waited almost 4 years for a clean thermite skin. Hopefully we can buy these with renown like the Halloween packs.
---
There are still counters. Castle windows, Kapkan traps, Frost traps, Ela mines.
---
Thank you!! I have Cosplayed Ela, I'm currently working on making her Evo. I have some Cosplay pictures of her on my Insta/Twitter! 😊
---
I like the clip and that stuff, but imho it's annoying, when people write something like "oh look I am 60 years old and I am a gamer" or "I am new to this game" or "Hey I am a gamer girl, please like this" just to squeeze out a few more upvotes.
---
Factory new default skin
---
Bottom text
---
well its one of the better shotguns but still, its dumb
---
Is the tts up?
---
Feels more like a Borderlands weapon to me. Specifically the scope looks Maliwan
---
Oh you mean like Sledge who can take a hammer and instantly make a man sized hole with one hit? Lol
---
the trollface stays there for 5sec and then the video comes
---
Too bad almost everyone that plays competitively turns graphics down to achieve even higher fps
---
Except no high level uses her.
---
I really didn’t post it for that reason. I’m a gamer girl, I could’ve mentioned that above saying some dumb shit like “oMg GaMeR GrIL 4 LyFe” but I didn’t. I was genuinely proud of myself. Thank you for saying you like my clip but please keep the passive aggressiveness and negativity away.
---
Well yeah, that makes total sense. He's probably nd secretly worth of the Mjölnir
---
nice
---
It just feels like your doing better because when an enemy team is up players (at least in lower ranks) everyone just starts charging in aggressively like idiots and throws their lives away

Hello BiboLilo, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dva6bz/ubisoft_is_sneakily_making_you_visit_the_shop/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
oh my bad. i'd such a brain fart. i wasn't thinking of a current pr league skin. i was only thinking of the earliest ones.
---
Then you seem to be an exception.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Depends on which ones you're taking as an example, though.
---
I can somewhat agree with you on 3 speed defenders, as their entire role is to move around the map. 
---
But I don't really see that with attackers. Only real 3-speed ''CoD Rusher'' there's been was Ash. Hell, I could even say that Twitch, Buck, Sledge and Finka are also more of the entry-fragging ''CoD ops".
---
I personally think it also depends on the ability of the op itself. Look at Maverick, whenever I see people using him, they're using him for his utility. I rarely see people using him as a rusher/fragger. 
---
The 2-2 ops I mentioned earlier are all ''run and gun'' ops because of their gadgets. Think about it. Sledge, Buck and Ash all have gadgets that allow them to be played with a CoD mentality. Same with Finka, her entire ability is made for it.
---
Mp5k
---
I have a smurf not to shit on worse players but I have my main account for playing the game seriously, then another account for playing with my friends that aren't as good as me so I don't have to ruin the stats/rank of my main when I'm playing with them.
---
Sorry for the low meme quality, this is the first time ever I make one
---
he died from a  cancer  r.i.p man
---
They're just changing the name and adding the ranked side swap
---
Not Belfast my dude! That’s Northern Ireland! So make that operator actually Irish because the ranger wing is in the Republic of Ireland not Northern
---
no one likes a noob on there team but if you help them then they won’t be a noob anymore
---
 Sooooo cuuuute, Love it!
---
What?
---
A complete and utter dissapointment...this look and doesn't represent her whatsoever.

I would give you gold If I had money!

&gt;ry  youtuber and pro player  smurfs yall need to wake up .
---
I\`m sorry, was that the question? or is it just you trying to justify your shitty r6s smurfy attitude?
---
Me too
---
yeah people on consoles guess that’s the only game they have so they want to play, so either if it’s a 1v5 they just kick the person because Xbox usually doesn’t get lots of aces. If the kick doesn’t work, they leave to play some other round
---
I haven't been playing since the first week she came out until recently, I'm pretty sure my only kill with her was after grappling through the window
---
Thacher is just sombra (overwatch)
---
so much yes
---
yh but even in like 1v1 or 1v2s i still manage to destroy
---
Ubisfoot
---
On the table
---
Wtf?
---
Love the Ashe that's first to die and leaves on the first round. Classic.
---
Oh yeah for sure.
---
Think of it this way, sensitivity has two components the physical aspect and the visual aspect.
---
If 360 is the physical aspect
---
And FOV is the visual aspect.
---
And combining them gives you your sensitivity.
---
Then when your Visual Aspect decreases, you'd need to increase your physical aspect to compensate for the loss right? Like balancing an equation.
---
Well, the higher zoomed you go, the smaller your FOV goes, therefore the higher your 360 distance needs to be to compensate. 
---
Regardless of what calculate it with, across different zoom levels, you're going to need to adapt:
---
* If you use 360, you'll need to adapt to the visual difference (FOV change)
---
* If you use Monitor Distance, you'll need to adapt to the physical difference. (360 distance change)
---
From what I've seen, read and experienced. It's way easier to adjust physically than visually, it's way easier to use Monitor Distance and use your arm to adjust, rather than using the same 360 distance and forcing your eyes/brain to adjust to the different FOV and speed.
---
I am very much in favor of Wamai getting Ela's FO-12
---
The lowest price is 10K . it will not go lower than that
---
It's a small detail but you get bored sometimes and just read into bios and look at small details and i saw it
---
Kapkan: I'm gonna destroy this gals whole career
---
dumb opinion and that wont happen
---
she's fine the way she is.  Example is consulate when defenders are on Garage and you have players peeking the over the Garage.    Grapple the small break room next to the cubicle office, run across the hall, oh look, dumb ass peekers have no idea you are there.  I get them ALL THE TIME.
---
Next up, kafe-dostoyevsky.  I use her to break hatches from below and then grapple through. A bit more risk with less ROI but still fun when you surprise someone using that strat.  I have grappled right into the bomb room above kitchen and wiped out anchors (or they killed me).
---
And hackers
---
This is a good idea you should post it on r/R6
---
Because ubi look at sometimes
---
I have never had to wait that long I usually on have a wait time of maybe 5 or 6 mins the first game and then I wait like 3 mins after that but I play on the ps4
---
Save AWP mother noob
---
*Taps head*
---
No it’s callouts, backseat gaming is more of telling them what you would do and exactly how to do it, call outs are just prices of helpful information
---
Rook could come back as smoke, but even smoke couldn’t do so. He’s the chosen one
---
I like your flair :)
---
Honestly man, it just depends how you play. I’m quite aggressive so I use holo, I find that when I use acog I don’t really do much but hold angles
---
Lol it's true
---
Ok. Thanks for your answer.
---
One thing I haven’t seen in the comments is how the “full” fix list says the yellow light is being removed on the breach charges. Does this mean you can’t blow out floors with it any more?
---
Ok. Thanks :-)
---
What are invitational skins? Will we be able to purchase them
---
If you’re going to throw, do it in casual where you aren’t negatively affecting 9 other people’s matches
---
Strangely nice today, and there mate?
---
I say he should counter Zof for 2 reasons. 
---
1) Zof has no hard counter to her nades other than Jager and Wamai. Warden being a counter would help him out immensely
---
2) Zof’s concusses and a typical flashbang serve the same purpose, deny the opponent’s ability to fight back. If he’s meant to counter smoke and flash plants, why can’t he counter Zof? Jager, Wamai, and Warden can Counter a rushing ash who flashes into site, but only Jäger and Wamai can counter a rushing Zof. 
---
The idea of giving warden his own smokes doesn’t sit well with me. He would be way too similar to Glaz but with a full auto gun, and since it takes less time for warden to see through smoke than glaz’s scope, he’d be very frustrating to fight. I also don’t think he should be able to see through smoke while moving because then he could use the shotgun and basically be a close range pre-patch glaz.
---
Is he the only op with a magnificent beard?
---
It’s a bug a siege news YouTube messages the devs and they said it was a bug... Jesus Christ your dumb
---
When I heard That they were redoing the map I was worried  that they were not gonna Remember him and not put him in
---
sry but I can't agree
---
Lowkey actually fantastic, I'm a summer person so it's a little cold for my taste but it's great to roll the windows down and cruise
---
No one has replied again with "no high level uses her"
---
compete with royal tea, bobapop, dink tea, gong cha =))))))))
---
The original operators also went back to the original concept so I thought everything is possible.
---
You should make an amoled wallpaper series with each op. They're absolutely amazing though.great job.
---
 So saying: „Go Up! Throw impact! Use Gu-Mine“ for you isnt saying what to do. Dude
---
that happens when you join a match in progress and a round is completed while loading.
---
I don’t know about other skins but the 2 seasonal skins do work on the sniper

Ordering him to chill aswell, ya idk if your argument is still that waterproof afterall xD
---
I've been asking for this every Christmas since Blackbeard was added, thank you Ubi!
---
I've played her on the test server, and that's a definite no. She seems pretty weak imo. The bolt action is pretty damn devastating. Kali is going to be pretty situational. From my limited tactical abilities, she's best for garage pushes. She can get rid of Bandit, Mute, or Kaid gadgets on the wall, then punish anyone that comes into line of sight from the garage when Thermite opens the wall up.
---
I've needed the "win a round in ranked with every OG operator" trophy for like 2 years now haha.
---
I dont care enough about the platinum to throw away ranked rounds with op's I have never played/suck with. *shrug*
---
SHUT UP DAYOV...you ignorant slut
---
fair point
---
This is strikingly good.
---
How did u get those icons by ur name
---
Not gonna lie I haven’t even listened to the audio, but general opinion is that it’s not really backseat gaming, the term is meant to be toxic it’s like calling someone a try hard. He wasn’t being toxic whatsoever

thats fine, people have their own opinions

Hello pogitoman,

##I N C O R R E C T

That thing is loud af

No

Twitch, sledge, thatcher, lesion, Valkyrie are my favourites

Wait its out?
---
Sure is but I'm sure some people would get triggered.
---
i enjoy playing hibana so i’ll look into her but i don’t obey bandit often and i see bandit elite as a cuck move
---
I like kapkan, Jäger, iq and mute
---
Thanks bro.
---
That is indeed a nice idea, this if implemented would increase her pick rate in game.
---
Also don’t you guys think that her grapple makes a lot of noise, which easily acquires the attention to defenders?
---
Only thing they need to remove is that 1-2 secondes before she can move when she grapple a window that is just annoying for no reason as she already make a lot of noise like she would Say "LOOK AT ME I'M HERE" that is enough counterplay.
---
Styling on em

Can I get a buy

Ubisoft not getting targeted by triggered leftists and extremist Muslims matters too.

I mean, maybe? MnK on console is super iffy and not as precise as a lot of people think.

much better than a new model but same stats
---
Clever girl
---
open the TTS and see for yourself then
---
Yeah no Asiimov too strong
---
mute is personally one of my favorites for the animation but the skin is pretty bland in my opinion
---
Ela’s is this season, Capitao and Cav are next season.
---
It's not about some people being better than others.  It's about screwing with the matchmaking so that the teams are uneven.
---
As a silver, I don't mind playing with and against plats.  I'm a bit outclassed, but it's a fun challenge IF matchmaking is able to compensate for the difference in our skill levels (by giving me gold/plat teammates).  And the style of play is better (more strategic and more predictable).  
---
The problem is when that plat tricks the system into thinking he's a silver (or lower).  Now his skill can't be compensated for.  And what often happens is that he just goes around taking and winning every gunfight  because his aim is so much better or he plays in ways that would be countered if we were playing at his level (defending default plant in Consulate garage from piano, for example) but aren't because no one plays like that in Silver.
---
It's wouldn't be such a problem if this was rare, but (on Xbox at least) it's not.  This season about 50% of my matches in silver feature at least one obvious smurf on the other team.  What's particularly troubling is that the problem has been getting worse.  Silver used to be relatively safe, it wasn't until you got into bronze and copper that smurfs were common (and much more common than they are in silver right now).
---
Uno reverse
---
The Rhino on the Picture has a Mini Red dot and in the game it does not come with one. Anyone noticed that?
---
“It’s so fucking huge”
---
Seriously though, you could fit an arm through there
---
Wouldn't it blend in better with the blue light because it already emits a blue glow?
---
Probably just a typo and the wrong piece of art. The rhino is the real life name of the gun and I’m sure they have multiple profile drawings of each weapon so they might have put in one with a sight
---
Maybe it’s easier to take off the acog than give it?
---
that’s a custom game
---
Could be overheating but that also means damage might have already been done.
---
No custom
---
Yo sledge is ugly as shit
---
FOV is 82 Aspect Ratio is 4:3

To make up for nerfs

Mp5k is for Wamai, Mp5 is for the next defender after him, next year.

Hmm well in my opinion some of my favorites are Valkyrie’s, IQ’s, and Twitch’s. I feel like they have variety and are different from the normal skins in a good way.

What I'm trying to tell my friend that's hard stuck in silver. I used to be that way to until WB. You've got to always see how you can improve and what you did wrong. Like that siege commercial from a few months back said "every death is a lesson"
---
That's a whole new kind of long con in this game.
---
Hibana is my favorite. Twitch is the best by comparison with the base skin though imo.
---
DROP AVP MEN
---
Lmao yea man it’s just local to me glitch. Plus it’s not even me haha
---
I recently returned to siege and was sad to see many defenders lose their impact grenades. They're by far my favorite tactical gadget. Is the reason for taking these away because you find them too strong, or do you find them too weak?
---
Do you ever see a time when we have the choice between 3 tactical gadgets instead of 2 for each op?
---
fair enough then aha
---
On some maps you could use hatches back to the roof as well

I am Brazilian, and I assure you that this proposal has a lot to do with the sports that have always been in the country. And if you look, the same Invitational content recently revealed is the same as the Skins. Coincidence?

Why not both

Guess ubisoft thought that it was impossible for a rank 23

Mate I understand your frustration completely, I always wait for my other 4 friends to get on now before playing. It's ridiculous, kept getting matched with enemies who were also in plat getting all the run-outs and spawnpeaks and my team spend the entire round licking windows and aiming at the floor, not entering the building until the last 30 secs of the round aha
---
If you're banned then that is not the reason for it.
---
Neat. 
---
Remove Acog from the MP5.
---
And once again IQ gets an indirect buff. nice.jpg
---
Do you have a better solution?  The current situation is untenable.  I really feel like you don't get how big of an issue this is on console in silver and below.  It's at least as big an issue at that level as MnK (another issue without an easy fix) is in plat+.
---
You're wrong about matchmaking.  Because this determination would occur before matchmaking starts (splitting players into two pools), matchmaking would still work the same way.  The valid matchmaking concern is about what this would do to matchmaking times.
---
Imo the positives of this change would greatly outweigh the negative (forcing a few innocent players to face far more smurfs and increased matchmaking time).  But I'd love to hear a better suggestion; that's why I made this post.
---
Yeah I see it now
---
Get a lower rank.
---
Other team should have surrendered after such humiliation
---
Nice though. :)
---
Sorry to ruin your karma gaining dreams but these are the invitational skins
---
That looks like the laziest texture for a gun we’ve had yet. All the weapons so far look like they really shoot. That’s a damn nerf Longstrike
---
He looks like Gru lol
---
That’s a good point.
---
Looks like they have modified all the winning screens on all the maps . Could someone make a long list for it please ?
---
Next elite skin

Finally KiX will get a charm!

My advice to the enemy team would be to turn on their TVs. It helps.
---
I was panicking the whole time
---
I thought they were olympics because of their summer look.
---
That happens if you tab out alot. Try starting the que again at around the 2 minute mark. This works for me, it could for you too.
---
Yes she does and she downs anybody from anywhere, no damage dropoff. So you can down anybody whom you can see on your scope.
---
Cav without the face paint looks fucking wired
---
you do know most people live pay cheque to pay cheque right
---
Why make a 12x scope then. Either they make it right or they should not have done it at all.

There's a lot of foreigners in Morocco, that's why. The question you need to answer is how likely is it that a man from an Islamic country, with an Islamic name, is going to have a Christmas tree and presents underneath?

Hmm I do tab out a lot. Normally I do just re-queue but wanted to see how long it would go before actually letting me in. 9:54 was the final time.

Whitewashing smh
---
Mozzies looks dope as hell
---
i agree
---
We renamed Casual. Same Gamemode, New Name.
---
One sentence later:
---
Quick Match now has AA-DD. 
---
It's like watching a family member grow demented. So we now have Ranked, Unranked and Unranked Light? Wtf Ubi, have you lost your minds?
---
yes a new defender with an acog
---
Check the link in my comment below. Ping abuse is not a thing anymore.
---
Yeah you're right.
---
Cool idea, could've done a better song choice.
---
Fuze has a pretty decent one
---
The problem is it doesn’t fix his biggest issue, his gadget is still kinda trash and way to situational.
---
Still not bad though.
---
Oof. Sucks dude. Tried using a vpn?
---
A game that used to be good until they ruined it with microtransactions and pay to win mechanics
---
I'm pretty sure every rank was just 100 points more than it is now
---
Same !
---
Rook armor isnt a problem that needs countering though... I know that "just headshot lol" is a dumb response but headshots are an instant kill with every weapon. You should be aiming for the head anyways.
---
the oldest trick in the book
---
Dude if we’re going into specifics, then rly the explosions and the bullets aren’t real, they’re all bb pellets and no one actually dies. Even when fcking set on fire
---
Yes, you're right. 
---
Here's an article explaining it:
---
https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/18/rainbow-six-siege-lean-spam-fix-new-costs-old-operators/
---
 Is this an updated bio for Capitão? If yes what other operators have been updated?
---
the sniper reminds me of the sniper Ana has in Overwatch
---
I love me a tasty armpit
---
All I really go from that was “I want more guns because I want them”.
---
Compare the details of the two flags, and you’ll soon see several mistakes
---
That is so good u should send it for rainbow for an ad
---
I will give you my whatever the fuck u want for those
---
Ubisoft make this happen
---
As someone who has not watched the reveal and stuff that must have just happened, what is this gadget's ability?
---
True! My annoyance though is that I thought unranked served as that practice mode for people who want to warm up for ranked. Even for those people that quit and leave the team after one round they'd probably be better served using that unranked mode and not have to handicap their teammates. 
---
What is the point of unranked then? Casual should still be serving an unlimited map pool and no pick n ban stuff and changed rounds etc. Otherwise you'll basically just have 3 ranked modes, with one of them only "counting" whilst casual becomes another version of unranked lmao...seems pointless if they had already identified unranked mode as that mode to give people the ranked experience with no consequences. But sometimes casual players we don't want the ranked experience day in day out. Sometimes u just wanna kick it and be able to use every operator without having operators banned and what not and being stuck to certain maps in the ranked map pool.
---
You know who else google translates terms from r6? WAMAI!

It doesn't
---
lol blackbeard "Lettttssss gooooooo"
---
I have my most playing time on ATK with BB. Can't blame you for liking him. He's probably my top 3 favorite attackers. But don't discount his ability to suck. Too many people think he's overpowered even though he's been nerfed into the ground.
---
Made a video?
---
You just copy pasted old videos
---
&gt; What's offered is not remotely worth $60 like it was before.
---
What is being offered hasn't changed...
---
I don't care how hard it is, that's their damn job. We don't pay for nothing, except we love to make excuses as to why we should for whatever reason. And the majority of said maps are not "awful", yes I'm sure you pull your hair out every time you hop on one.
---
Also missed the point on the second paragraph. Again.
---
There's a metagame being played here. It's so obvious it's easy to overlook the reasoning. Ubisoft makes a good game. I pay them. They support the game with new content and continuous updating for $40 a year. Now they feel as though new content is not important. At the least, secondary to maintenance. A good idea in theory, but not worth $40. Not like new content and maintenance together.
---
I don't care how it's done. Throwables, 4 operators (or 3) every season instead of just 2, there's still ground to cover for weapons. They could approach it any number of ways, but NOT just maintenance and whatever map reworks.
---
I got to shoot one recently IRL. It isn't a bad gun for it's size and weight.
---
Nah Dokkaebi is best girl

What about my Pro League seasonal 1 set?

yeah!
---
Really solid idea tbh
---
Darude sandstorm sounds mad

Now that’s just flexing
---
This looks like the intro to a full movie!!!! This is super cool. I would definitely watch if a movie were made about r6 siege
---
Could have a metal tip
---
I main Cav and this is the most frustrating thing player her.  Cav gets robbed of the kill and the person quitting then rejoining doesn't get a death so there's no real penalty for doing this.  This is definately an exploit that should be addressed.    It's happens to me several times a day now as more players seem to have figured this out.  I think there hould be a ban implented for doing this but at a minium we should get credit for the kill/death.
---
Yeah he's far from OP but he's still ok. I really like his gun. Basically no recoil.
---
30fps? Yeah. All the time
---
Yeah we won't talk about that...
---
yes, you can play all operators.
---
Stache is still there, just hard to see in this resolution
---
It’s rare, so the chase of it and the anticipation are fun, plus I just think it looks awesome.
---
Cool
---
Who knows whats in the glass bulb could be ferrocerium powder
---
I'm with you, that's totally a dick.
---
Ik what his talking about, bullet tracers and what not, however that completely different to what I'm talking about. I was saying that round ending kill cams should include an animation of the fatal shot getting shot out of the gun and followed by the camera until it hits the enemy. Similar to how in siege a frag (grenade) is followed and traced by the camera until it explodes https://youtu.be/tbNjjrGcvKg . It would look like this random clip https://youtube.com/IJRKmZSfhh8 .
---
Save clip to OneDrive &gt; Download clip from OneDrive &gt; Post
---
Well now I can’t un-see it
---
Agreed
---
&gt; They support the game with new content and continuous updating for $40 a year.
---
No, they offer you a very specific set of things in a season pass. You've decided you're paying for things you simply aren't and are now getting pissy when that fantasy changes.
---
But he took my main! He deserve it
---
Happened to me too, don't let the game overwhelm you, you'll catch the information of the game at your own pace.  
---
And yeah, Lord Tachanka still lives.
---
Looks like he should be a minor villain in The Witcher 3
---
While I agree some people would get triggered, I’d just like to point out that I’m Muslim and have no problem with this.
---
Damn so you like them crazy?
---
Well I don’t think they can do that without adding a new gun I don’t think they have the ability to buff a guns stats for one op but not another and I don’t was to imagine doc and rook with that and I think they should keep him two speed and give him a p90 with no acog so he can keep his more lurker type of play style and  he should get an immunity to the visual effect of Zofia’s concussion grenades he also should be able to move a bit more while still being able to see through smoke this would allow him to use his gadget more efficiently as well as keeping his new play style and as you said he really needs those impacts back.
---
I like her just the way she is.
---
Dayum this is hype af
---
Buying a season pass is a risk. You took the risk so stop complaining.
---
then proceed to kill himself form the leap of faith,
---
The Pro League implications excite me. I don't play as often as I used to, but try to keep up w/PL and new ops. This will be big. They could ban her but that leaves Echo, Mira, Maestro, etc all on the board. IQ will be stronger in PL now which people have said, but she can't destroy it if it is in OBJ
---
That just seems like alibi with extra steps
---
Or the grappling hook also lajnches an explosive pellet that detonates just before entry... But then it would add noise back into the entry, thus alerting everyone.
---
Downvoting my reply, then saying relax? You see the hypocrisy there, right?
---
Also, **again**, not bashing op, just pointing out the obvious discrepancy between the post title and post content.
---
Oh, plane house and Oregon are probably my three favourite maps
---
Sledge is ugly...was a disappointment
---
Nice thanks
---
who downvoted? sure as hell wasnt mean
---
Nope, but that doesn't change how cool the skin is.
---
Exactly I do not think we will ever figure it out
---
This game launched in 2015 with 33 weapons and reached 60, Modern Warfare has 37, and they will most likely not go past 55 at the end of it all, think about that, this game is loaded with weapons.
---
No you could buy it for a while
---
The bouncing idea is interesting, maybe lose the double smoke effect and just have a high velocity smoke grenade launcher that bounces so you can place smokes round corners at long range.
---
Very cool - thanks Kanye

It says sledge in his shirt
---
Warden can finally counter someone lol
---
They probably repackaged every single gun so that they could separate attachments into their own separate file. So the new defender Aug probably just has "A2" or something will load in after the Aug's main file loads in, overwriting everything.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Honestly the uniforms suck. I’ll be happy if I get the headgears though
---
This! Casual is for practice. Practice to win!
---
...
---
Man, whatever, I'm not even gonna bother.
---
How about Clash
---
Ur not getting frame drops with that setup, no one cares about ur build shitter
---
Yeah I should definitely start playing unranked more. Usually I just play a few casual games whenever i had 20-30 mins free, but as you probably know, casual isn't the best place to learn about actually playing competitively.
---
I already have some ops I like to play as, so I guess I'll just try to grind out the maps. Any suggestions as to which videos I should watch? Thanks!
---
She can. It's just written in stone that she needs one bullet to down an enemy. Doesn't matter if hes rook armour plus 140 health, he will be downed with shot, however, he can instantly get revived so
---
Man, why you using the Soviet skin on the MP5K
---
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ i didnt downvote literally just said relax but ight bud smh
---
I see a spinning dreidel
---
Maybe it could be like Lesion's mines or kapkans traps.
---
You deploy it and when someone triggers it they get rooted, slowed, forced to the ground for a little while. And you have to go through a animation just like Lesion. Just an idea
---
But that is an acog in game
---
Ok, boomer.
---
I got this for ita 12 s

100% agree. I’ll never forget this news story from a few years ago where I think Walmart had a shirt for kids that said “boys will be boys” and somehow everyone was outraged by it online. After that I realized exactly what you just said.

BAILIFF, that's what it was! Thanks for reminding me.

I would swap Gandhi's skill to drop a nuke on the map.

This looks like a commercial man, good job
---
Better be quiet before the hordes come telling us this opinion is wrong.
---
I wish therr were more interactions like this in the game, where larger calibers can penetrate certain things that other calibers can't. Maybe Kali should be able to penetrate those metal boarded windows that are on many buildings where the devs just didn't feel like dealing with wooden barricades.
---
Imagine the same concept but for any breakable wall. She could just bust through like a wall takedown from the Batman Arkham series.
---
AUG gang!!!!! Yesss
---
Console. Console is what happen.
---
I hope they redo all the win screen locations, and maybe rotate between several per msp!
---
It's called "test server" for a reason.
---
Mozzie is hot.
---
he still has the worst ttk of all DMR's. (and worse than half the pistols)
---
...but that's besides the problem; the problem is his thermal is almost useless at this point and it's literally all he has; he's an operator who's gun is bad and whose gadget is useless unless he's standing still for 3 seconds *and behind smoke;* meanwhile Kali's gadget is one of the best in the game (because it's the first ever alternative to Thatcher, who's currently a must-pick for many strats)
---
I agree that Glaz and Kali are not very similar, but that's more to do with how bad he is than it is their intended roles (especially if we look at pre-rework Glaz, but they confirmed this spring that they *still* wanted Glaz to be a sniper)
---
Kali also has an automatic secondary, which makes her likely more effective than Glaz even in close range.
---
Your friend could buy it for you
---
I mean no, there would be absolutely no sense to run a breaching charge on her, I have played a handful rounds with her and its crazy how much you need the claymore as she is always rushed at, on the other hand, you are an open target while you are deploying a breach charge. Dhe gets 26 bullets in total, lets count she uses 6 for opening barricades and hatches, you still have 20 to play with, which is fine considering you DBNO in one shot, it doesn't make sense let that claymore go. But yes, depends on playstyle maybe, I find the breaching charge to be not so useful.
---
Mute's bio literally says "It may not be immediately clear why Specialist Mark Chandar's codename is Mute. While he dislikes small talk, he isn't particularly reserved and in fact can be brash - a trait that is off-putting to some."
---
And then get headshoted by an "infinite hours spent on siege player".
---
Is it something intended for spectator mode, or for teammates only?
---
Do you have any video suggestions? Or would any map guide video just be a good starting point?
---
Im dumb i dont get it
---
No, its only a hard counter for the SAS ops
---
It’s is still a stupid and simple bug. Not being able to switch the key is bullshit
---
Username... Checks out?
---
Magic. 
---
Nah, the ps4 records and i recorded the recording
---
It’s just when I just joined siege, I don’t know why but I had the skin and I might have a clue why but it will take me a bit to explain and from then it’s my only legendary weapon skin and I just like it for that.
---
You're absolutely right though; there are quite a few uniforms i avoid like the plague because I'm not a huge fan of being a glow stick. All depends on the situation.
---
Is the dlc’s regional title Nighthaven? Cause that sounds hella cool.
---
1. That's still one whole magazine of pretty strong utility, think a Shotgun without range limitation.
---
2. Zofia can do half of her job, Thatcher can do half of her job; doesn't make her utility any worse than either of them.
---
3. That's true, but this is still very strong.
---
4. people are saying that because having either one of these things would have been enough to make her a pretty decent operator.
---
5. What's your point here? Yes, she has the CZ to make her good at close range and the sniper rifle to make her unmatched at long range. how does this make her *less* strong?
---
What we have here is an attacker that can stand in for Thatcher (because disabling Pulse's sensor for 10 seconds is not Thatcher's primary purpose), Brings shotgun utility (without the range limitation), is armed with the strongest long-range primary in the game and a secondary that lets her still be viable in close range; let's contrast this to Glaz (which i admit is very unfair, but i do this because he too was *intended* to be a sniper), Glaz's gadget is borderline useless nowadays, he can stand in for exactly 0 other operators, his gun has the worst ttk of all DMR's and his secondaries are a mediocre ammo-pistol and a decent damage-pistol (yes, the pmm has been no more than decent ever since they buffed the recoil on all the true hand-cannons)
---
that's what i meant lol
---
Your idea is good but only for the newcomer playlist. Ranked is the “main” playlist, and if you punish higher skill new players it will just be adding another barrier to entry for new players - something Ubisoft would never want to do as its the easiest way to kill growth
---
Gandhi needs some nuclear warheads doe
---
Not sure wym. Both operators are part of a PMC called Nighthaven. As you know one is Indian and one is Kenyan.
---
Did you hit the arm? That would explain it
---
love hibanas and cavs. also blitz
---
He chonky
---
Maybe she got stimmed.
---
You got pretty similar to the one of the operators
---
 I wanted to buy it but after i saw the shotgun skin.....
---
Ubisoft stated that they need to break the pattern of licensing new guns for every new operator because it will quickly get unreasonably expensive if they want to reach 100 operators
---
Stupid sexy pixels
---
Maybe something with the tear gas idea where it does minimal damage but fucks up your screen after entering it
---
It sounds easy, but not in practice, I'm guessing you didn't play back then which is cool if you didn't
---
It was basically Ying/glaz combo which shit on people, throw in capitao, thatcher and a hardbreach or lion/finka/blitz and it was absolutely awful to play against and incredibly difficult to stop
---
Omg the mozzie is the best skin ever this should be an elite for him
---
Easy don’t look when you kill the dog

im the only one to want termite ?

ubi literally said it was impossible to change the load out for one op and not have it changed the other, like if warden got acog then valk would too. But now wamai has aug without acog

It was removed from alpha packs in operation grim sky over a year ago. Sorry.
---
I see a fellow PlayStation user
---
zof is much better IMO
---
What was weird about that? It looked like a normal kill
---
Possibly, however since she is a one armor and was that far away from site and being left on almost half health it seems unlikely. If she was stimmed she should still go DBNO I believe.
---
Imma just be in the corner playing mozzie, looking like a neon chocolate chip cookie
---
Dude if it costs as much as the halloween set for sledge ima pass, that shit is crazy

I love it

It is called scope

so, the gadget must be ''worse'' than valkyries

If you think the TCS is a shotgun, you're correct but it's more of a dmr. And m870 is the best pump action

Well, maybe op didn't see anything as important as this for these 4 years?

You shot the metal steps and the bullet ricochet and killed you. Not a smart idea to fire point blank into a hard surface.

3 things that likely happened

1. She got stimmed

2. you missed your shot
---
3. You should have pulled out the C75 auto.

agreed.

What's going on then?
---
Our words are backed with nuclear weapons!
---
For an operator that isn't a lazy copy/paste recycled op. Maybe some event packs.
---
Off topic but so far this season of fortnite is actually really good
---
Damn didnt try that. The MP5K with it on looks bomb
---
He mALONE
---
#CLARIFICATION
---
MAESTRO **can** because his turret shots an high temperature laser, that melts the plastic of the tank and potentially blows it up.
---
TWITCH **can't** because she uses a ZAP, a shock, electrons fluidity that causes electric shock, plastic is an Insulating material and the tank is made of plastic.
---
You have a skewed view of how the game works. Have a nice evening.
---
On my account I actually just had ash and jager and either banned them or waited for someone to choose them. But yes, as long as you have no ops to play you default to recruit. You can choose your loadout and everything.
---
No one but people on the project really know. That’s why you shouldn’t make statements like “the amount of bug fixes and maintenance has stayed the same”. Not all bugs are equal
---
HAHAH TK funny because he actually wants to play a functioning operator, stop being toxic and let people play the game.
---
I want a lowering in price still.
---
well; to be fair Caveira isn't exactly what you'd call a viable operator.
---
Truly. Sorta bs that people haven't caught on to this shit yet
---
He's basically like joe
---
Only sniper
---
Well I guess we’ll find out if Ubisoft thinks most people feel the way you do
---
I know I used to pay 25k for a new gadget with a new gun. Only fools pay the same price for less.
---
Super Gandhi more like Aang the last air bender
---
Super Ghandi: just declares war on the enemy team and then just drops a nuke
---
Nice
---
The next operator is actually Mista and he uses Six Bullets as his ability
---
What’s tts
---
Embrace tranquility
---
Welp, they don't call it anti-Material rifle for nothing
---
You can hear her like a bomb dropped from across the map
---
It says YEAR 5 SEASON 1
---
Our next season is YEAR 4 SEASON 4 
---
What is their to not understand
---
A counter argument to modern warfare barely having new weapons is that even with only 37 weapons, most of them can be heavily modified into almost a entirely new gun. For example, I can make the AUG in modern warfare into a AUG A2 with 5.56 rounds, a different stock, and a barrel change. Siege however doesn’t have this level of customization (probably due to balancing issues) and a lot of guns in this game are variants of each other. For Example:  (Mp5, Mp5sd, Mp5k) (AUG A2, AUG A3 Para) (Spaz 12 and Spaz 15).
---
While this is the case, I still do agree with you overall that recycled weapons aren’t that big of a issue. While new weapons do have a part in making a new operator fell fresh and exciting (Maestro getting a LMG on defense, Kaid’s TCSG12, Mozzie’s Commando 9 with that sexy reload, etc.), it shouldn’t be the sole reason why a operator is picked. What matter most in this game are the gadgets, the maps, and the synergies of operator’s utility. I can understand people who are let down by no new weapons, but I personally don’t bother much about it.
---
Wrong, Noty just said that it’s a bug
---
That is an awful explanation of what you were talking about. You just explained the bug that happened, not the game you were referencing.
---
Ohhhh okay, I’m console player so like it would be a while before I could figure it out. It’s probably the same as if fuze accidentally killed someone with his gadget
---
Gadgets change the meta in my opinion. Not guns. I don't see why everyone is pitching such a hissy fit about recycled guns tbh. I did to begin with, but I understand Ubi's reasonings.
---
Which hole 😏
---
I'm a console player as well so I'm only going off of what videos I've seen.
---
&gt;delete them all
---
I agree
---
This is a common glitch. Seen it so many times before.
---
My mistake. Would you just have to call it an arithmetic overflow, then, or is there a different term?
---
looks slick
---
I saw another thread where they said that wamai gets the blame for all the kills
---
This just looks like hyperion sniper rifle
---
nice clip, u should aim a bit higher tho

Thanks for agreeing with me. I guess several people decided their frozen wasteland they call home was worth downvoting me for

Yeah I may or may not have been slightly panicking😅
