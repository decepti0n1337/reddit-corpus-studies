Please give us an option to have a boring generic menu system. The menu systems with characters are very cringe/awkward for me and I'd like an option to change. Thanks.

Because your average player can‚Äôt abuse something to its fullest like a pro player can. She is super op in a post plant situation which with a group of randoms in a casual setting is super rare. She also provides a ton of intel on roamers, which in a pro setting is shared extremely well. In ranked people just typically use her to either hope no one follows them or jumps out a window on them.

Infinite scans is not as much of a problem imo because usually people in silver or higher don‚Äôt scan

If this is an act of renown grind, its an ass one imo, as you get more renown by playing the game and shitting on TH (because goobi cant stop giving those 150 renown quest to t hunt) than just AFKing

I do agree on how strong echo can be but from my experience he seems to get his way if you are lurking alone with no teammates and I usually consider bringing a thatcher almost every time if i see they like using echo i like bringing him way more than iQ because i have died plenty of times looking for that damn drone on the roof

I always think reverse damage for Team-killing offences should be the norm in shooters. Don‚Äôt let people get you down man, at the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game. Worry about yourself and it all falls together for you eventually. Time and gameplay, the educational Siege YouTube video if you need (want) tips. Not all siege players are toxic. Hope this helps in anyway.ü§ù

She will be op on maps with linear roam (Coastline, Border), and even on those she may simply force impact nade operators on roam. I don't think she'll be banned on maps like Villa or Kafe. Her sole role in the team is the roam control, you'll be missing other important operators when you pick her. Other than airjab, which can be taken out with an impact, she has average rifles and a secondary which can no longer be spammed after the recoil nerf. She's pretty good but I don't think she'll be a "must ban" operator.

Attack is Buck for versatility and Defense is Vigil because his ability is not so good but gun *godlike*

Those mean the same thing, otherwise cool!

It would be nice to have more of a spray pattern in the horizontal, making for more of a spaced grouping.

*ubisoft HQ* I like this guys reddit post on blitz rework, its logical and makes sense.... can you make blitz a 4 speed or at least faster than a 3 speed operator.

I like the variety option

Such a rollercoaster of emotions haha

Unbreakable, extendable, see through shield op, on *defense* needs a buff?!?
---
Putting effort into something that looks jarring and unappealing to most people you talk to means it's effort wasted. It's not really a case of "it's the thought that counts" here. Would much rather nice looking static images like they used to have than average looking animations.

this is being said as if you can cancel the flash already

It should - it has for me at least.

I actually have a friend who has at least 5,000 hours in it on steam bc he never quits the game, letting it run day-in and day-out

Technically Rainbow isn‚Äôt a national force nor are their operations counted as war, and therefore smoke is legal and not bound by international weapons agreements
---
Oh God no, please don't encourage them to come here
---
If this is a problem cross-platform, then they really ought to fix this
---
That was cringe af
---
Maybe, but I feel it‚Äôs better than what I predict Ubisoft plans on doing over the course of a year or two: remove ACOGs from every weapon other than DMRs, LMGs, and some guns available to three armor operators. 
---
You‚Äôd think they would, wouldn‚Äôt you? Such a shame really. 
---
How did u make this? It‚Äôs wicked
---
Well the only real solution is playing ranked by yourself if you have one friend just play with them stops most session joins either way rank doesn‚Äôt even matter all that much
---
I could never do that with my steam games. Im such a perfectionist with my playtimes that all of my stats are pathetic. 
---
But thanks for answering. Def gonna get it rn then. I was actually about to get it like tmrw on Steam bc it was 20 but then I just saw a twitter ad for it being on sale on uplay itself  
---
Honestly, the only changes I would make to him is to make his shield smaller and make his lmg mobile, with a similar bipod system to bf4. And as of now, he‚Äôs only ignored by the majority because the Pros say he‚Äôs useless. But he has one of the best SMGs on Defence. And you get the added bonus of the enemy team rushing you like idiots, there have been far too many times where one of my buddies has gotten 3-4 kills because the enemy team was stupid and pushed him.
---
?
---
I‚Äôm well aware of that but I think changing how his gadget works would make him less frustrating to play against. I think he is balanced but annoying and no operator should be annoying to fight 
---
In the display settings after you launch the game on pc, you can find a setting where you chose which display it uses.
---
They do need to fix that as well 
---
maybe a counter to mozzie could be that Dokkaebi could rehack the drones to get them back if she comes into contact with them/gets a hold of a drop from a dead teammates body? and Mozzie could maybe regain cameras if he deploys a pest on Doki‚Äôs laptop if she‚Äôs dead? pls dont bombard w downvotes this is just spitballing/speculation
---
That reload animation is going to provide some issues because ill empty out clips just to see that on repeat.

I guess that‚Äôs really he only way to go. A poor solution to a poor problem.

What about a compromise between the two. A quick press of a button does a quick flash, efficient to melee range. While holding the button will charge it up, slowing them down and not allowing them to use their gun.

Thanks! Sucks it doesn't solve the problem really. But surely gives more insight to it.

When u leave a ranked game u get a renown penalty, u get less renown

Im over here wondering how much time he took. 
---
Yeah that doesn‚Äôt make much sense. Making an animation consists of paying some artists and maybe hiring a mocap studio. I can‚Äôt imagine how a minutes‚Äô worth of animation would accrue over a million dollars in billings from a studio or in hourly wages.
---
Yeah it sucks because if you wanted to play a short game and before you left or something you‚Äôre stuck either leaving a ranked game or just being stuck in a 0-2 casual game
---
There was something in the game a while back where you won‚Äôt lose any points if you end the game with 4 or less players in your team.  
---
It got removed bc players abused it and just one left before they lost so the other 4 won‚Äôt lose any MMR 
---
Honestly doing this every round would save prep phase time.
---
I feel like both of these implementations are too specific to ever see use, like Ela's and Zofia's "extra" abilities - they get used so infrequently it's like they don't even exist.

LOL

Pretty nice when you see someone on a camera and wallbang them.

Lol but in all seriousness I get what you mean, console definitely has less communication. But in this case specifically we were playing in low gold because were helping a new player learn the game, so the bad communication is especially bad in those lower ranks, regardless of platform.

Lesion is the best support defensive operator in the game(smoke deserves a nod as well here). Maestro, Echo and Mira are the best anchors. If you play the support/hybrid I'd get lesion- he is a beast. 
---
Awful!
---
HAHAHAHAHA. Bro you realize this game is rated M...I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôd go over well you technically shouldn‚Äôt be playing it or whatever people say sorry.
---
I personally really like Tachanka 
---
Ok...and?  Mira gets banned a lot, too.  Does that mean Mira's OP?  Ela's gotten her fair share of bans, too.  So has Cav.  Same with Maestro. Yet none of them are OP, it's just that players either don't wanna bother countering them, or the operator is just annoying to play against.  Doesn't mean they're OP.
---
Pretty sure you can go as a 13 year old but you'll need parental/guardian supervision. 
---
Ur good
---
Idk if i agree with your logic. Maybe the Korean operators smgs were OP yes, but they coul've just lowered its dmg.  
---
Ubisofts tendency to nerf stuff instead of buffing things make the game less fun and more bland IMO.  
---
Similiar to the LoL and Dota2 philosophy debate. I think handing going with the flow of how the community interprets the game is more important then destroying fun metas no one was complaining or asking for a nerf for.
---
You've been posting this retarded shit for MONTHS, how have you not learned how to play the game yet?

Look at her pick and winrate.

Cav and Jager are still strong

Well the majority don‚Äôt care that he can plant deny it‚Äôs an important thing for defense. That‚Äôs like saying smokes gas should be translucent because it causes visual impairment and plant deny and damage. But hey we‚Äôre talking about the majority not just you

Akimbo FM9! Call of duty modern warfare flashback intensifies!!!!

camouflaged is what you said BTW. Whatever i'm not gonna repeat myself against people who don't understand. just read the post and if you are smart you will get it. his nerf is coming and you don't understand.
---
A rare euphoric feeling.
---
Now we need Sun Splash Lesion
---
Is that a south park reference?? 
---
I'm gonna have to agree with u/Mad-Observer here.  If you don't like Echo, learn how to counter it.
---
He has a shit ton of counters(Frags, Thatcher, IQ, Glaz, Smoke Grenades) and he's only powerful if you don't bother to drone out rooms or check for his Yokais, which are ridiculously easy to spot once you play against Echo enough.
---
Yep. These are solid.
---
Though I suggest Arctic mx4 paste, but if this one has better results compared to mx4, then go ahead.
---
That's not what I say when I hear that. It's more along the line of "OH SHIT OH FUCK OH SHIT HELP MEEEEE"
---
Surge protectors? Dead pixel checkers?
---
I have a surge protector but in my opinion dead pixel checkers are too expensive
---
Man the amount of effort put into this is amazing. What software did you use to edit/make this?
---
DLC character is just gael with an LMG
---
Boi this is console gameplay at level 20
---
&gt; his nerf is coming and you don't understand.
---
No, ik he's gonna get nerfed eventually.  Doesn't mean he needs one.  Ela didn't need a nerf in Grim Sky yet she still got one.  
---
This is posted every time we have this survey 
---
The horde of other recruits that come into view after you‚Äôve gotten the kill is terrifying 
---
Because they want the game to load quickly and not draw too much in the menu.
---
*plebs!*
---
So worth it though
---
Not to mention echo is only as good as the anchor playing him. Most people place echo drones in shitty placed and where echo really excels is in a 5 stack or someone competent with a mic.  Thank you u/_green_shadow123

this question has been asked thousands of times. you‚Äôre more than capable of looking for yourself.

I‚Äôll look into it.

It got removed because it was fucking horseshit lmao fym

He should clarify that

She's gonna lose it in the next update for her R4-C as a way of "Nerfing" her. Her other gun still has an ACOG, Holo sights with R4 C is still viable which is the funny part about the "nerf"

Is a house as much as headphones in a game where you need sound and comms?

Also it's not that deep. I don't really care what you do with your game but I guess people be triggered.

He did, he asked how old he has to be to go. He never said he was playing in it.

You know what I‚Äôm tired of running away from...fucking blitz
---
New tachanka elite 
---
Bro stop saying we don‚Äôt understand when you‚Äôre literally the only one fucking complaining. Get better or don‚Äôt play bomb. People like you are causing unnecessary nerfs to ops that are balanced between good gadgets and skill requirement
---
I‚Äôm not the guy who made the post but still... he prefers to ask the community so he can get the opinions of everyone at the same time 
---
Definitely recommend it. Had some dead pixels show up, 2 weeks later they spread and ruined my old monitor
---
Extremely terrible on your part since you didn't call it out. How hard is calling out something?
---
And that jackal was autistic as well.
---
Isn‚Äôt the bundle similar to one that jackal already has?
---
Ok...I'm confused.  First of all, Echo's not OP.  Second of all, in your post you're saying he should get nerfed, then in the comments you're saying he *will* get nerfed.  Pick one.  You're basically just arguing in circles, changing your argument from "he should get nerfed" to "he will get nerfed."  Saying that he's gonna get nerfed doesn't prove your original point, which is that he's OP.  Plenty of operators receive nerfs they don't need.
---
For example, Ela got nerfed in Grim Sky even though she was fine in Parabellum.
---
Cav got her mag size nerfed when all she really needed was the hipfire nerf.  
---
Your logic is flawed and your argument is weak.
---
Great hatching man!!
---
Ok you‚Äôve changed my mind I‚Äôll definitely go for it now üòÇ

Tank chick.

Can I get her shotgun and kill whoever did that? Ela lives matter.

No, it says y'all remember when Pulse had an active camo. And its just a glitch.

Lol I appreciate it, on my profile I have full video posted if you wanna check it out.

You should see my smurf reddit name.

Yeah, I guess you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs not a big deal, the game is fun regardless. It‚Äôs just a ‚Äúoh cool!‚Äù Kind of thing you know?
---
But like you said, not all of us will get our own maps. Reworked ones are more important anyway.
---
It‚Äôs a joke guys, come on, you don‚Äôt have to bash it.

That's clearly Gagarin

You, sir, are asking too much.

im just waiting for the "4 guys reinforcing at the same time" and i knownim gonna love it as well
---
Exactly, he's only as good as the person playing him.  If he was truly OP, anyone would be able to just pick him up and get 3+ kills every single defending round.  I remember my first time using him I got fucking destroyed, but once I learned how to use him I started doing good.  
---
Echo is far from OP and by OP's logic we should just nerf everything because everything is powerful in the right hands.
---
&gt;Thank you u/_green_shadow123
---
Np, I'm just sick of this "nerf this, nerf that" bullshit all the time.  It's the reason Ela got nerfed in Grim Sky.  People don't bother learning how to counter operators and whine about them incessantly until they're nerfed to hell and back, then they pick up and go whine about another operator they don't wanna learn how to counter.

Ah ok I was always curious as to why I see people get banned by BE

‚ÄúMen only want one thing and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting‚Äù

so a regular ping is a crutch? voice communication is a crutch as well. adding a ping wheel would have minimal effect on the current use of mics anyways. but for the people who dont use them it provides a way to communicate with your team more in depth.

Echo doesn't need a nerf...

You misunderstand, I don't just skip the work and do this. Whenever I am done with things and have some free time I draw.

&gt;you are actually stupid so i know no one will listen to you. 
---
First of all, no one is listening to you.  Clearly people are listening to Shadow(Observer and Ela), especially since their comments are getting upvoted.
---
And second of all, you just admitted you lost.  Right here.  The fact that you had to start throwing insults just proves you lost.  You couldn't win with facts and logic so you just started throwing insults, because apparently you're right and everyone on this sub is stupid, because according to you anyone who says Echo is balanced is a bot.  
---
And the "Get out" and "you don't understand" nonsense isn't helping your case at all.  Actually, it's making you look like even more of a jackass than you're already making yourself out to be.

Actually I think it was Tachanka before I found out that he wasn‚Äôt as good as he seems
---
Music isnt very fitting either. Visual transitions is more important than the sounds. Also, I should be able to hear the game noises a bit too. Good luck dude! You got something going!
---
That I had no other information to base it off of.
---
Lol well the point is is that you‚Äôre drawing firearms inside a school. Someone is bound to have a problem with it is all I‚Äôm saying. I wasn‚Äôt attacking you or giving you shit because you were drawing weapons. 
---
This happened for the season and I think it released a week before. I wish I could figure out how to find that announcement
---
As long as the uniforms are accurate 
---
Where are your crosshairs? 
---
Alrighty I gotcha

I‚Äôm looking at this and... I think you missed the door and hit right above it

wasn‚Äôt he arguing that not all guns should be one-shot-headshot? or was this someone else?
---
i doubt she's getting buffs, she was unbeatable pre nerf dude. you could zap for slow, and change into the gun all in the space of 1 second
---
You're such a Chad on god
---
IQ is fair I suppose. Blackbeard is still pretty damn strong though. He is one dimensional, but he‚Äôs crazy good at that one dimension. Being able to block headshots and shoot at the same time fundamentally breaks Siege. 
---
People like to joke and call him Nerfbeard but I still think he‚Äôs a threat and a nuisance to deal with. I think I‚Äôd agree about IQ and put her over Ying but I‚Äôll keep Capitao in my bottom three since they‚Äôre deciding to revert his asphyxiating bolt buff (for now at least). 
---
Might want to run a scan on your hard drive, that can be a bad sector causing that problem.

It would be sick if you can get a big toxic badge so you can put it on the velcro and not need to worry about it being permanent

I believe that was pengu
---
That gun does 61 damage of course it killed him
---
You‚Äôre literally supporting cheaters. Don‚Äôt talk to me about toxicity Broseph Stalin. First,  a game of chess doesn‚Äôt know if you swap all your pens for queens so that‚Äôs a bullshit argument. Next, there is no difference between a smurf and an alternate. It‚Äôs just a different name for making a new account so you can beat legitimately lower skill players while convicning yourself that you aren‚Äôt trashy pieces of shit. Finally, I‚Äôm not toxic by opposing cheaters, cheaters are toxic. Once again, basic dictionary skills. 
---
he absorbes the flairs of those who fail to fight him

internet‚Äôs usually fine, they should still fix that

I kinda understand why this option hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet. And probably never will.

Maybe get longer cargo shorts? And a fast helmet
---
Have u seen Lion nerfs? LOL His ability about to last only 3 seconds and give you intel as a dot no longer an outline of the defender, so you won't know the exact location but can make an estimate LEL
---
You used to be able to get up on the ruins but I didn't realise there's a new way. Nice work young buck. I'll be trying it out next time I play Villa.
---
Shoot the other team
---
Bleh, just gonna focus on Castle. He's one of the better operators in the game when you know which sites he's good at. The so called counters to him have to use utility to get rid of his barricades, and if they try to go up to the barricade to remove it, they're risking themselves by getting shot at if you placed them right. 
---
Work with your team. Can't pop hatches and ceilings if you get flanked
---
Blackbeard fundamentally breaks the game but tbh he's hardly ever a problem due to the nature of defense now, I don't remember the last time I died to Blackbeard at this point. I still hope he gets reworked but I mean he's never even played in PL at this point because of how easy it is to deal with him.
---
Even old Capitao is way better than people realise. He has smokes that don't get affected by Jager ADS like that's a dream come true on Bomb.
---
Theres gonna be a fuck ton of ash's rushing with reflex sight now.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE BATHROOM, GO OBJECTIVE!!!
---
Great cosplay man
---
This looks very good but if you want to you can spray it very lightly and from far with some black and brown spray paint or even take a crumbled up piece of paper deep that in paint and just add a little bit of stains to it to make it look weathered and worn out to make it look even better (there are a bunch of territorials on YouTube that show how to do it)
---
This is so beaten to death
---
If you want here are some tips for drawing guns. I myself suck at it so I find it easier is just starting with the basic shapes for them. Like the main part starts off as a rectangle. It really helps and is probably much easier than going straight to detail
---
These guides are fantastic. I could really use one for Fortress.

seriously why the hell do people cry over t bagging in a video game? its been around since the beginning of online gaming
---
As someone who was plat 2 on console. I came to pc this season and I‚Äôve gotten to gold 2. Pc is way harder. The people are way better. I‚Äôm starting to get to where I‚Äôm holding my own but it is a very big challenge.
---
New content please. 
---
Video games take place in the real world. Essentially beind a dick in a video game is being a dick in the real world. Just because it's online doesn't mean it's not a douche thing to do. Is it as bad as tbagging someone in the real world? Of course not. Is it still immature and annoying? Yes.

The rework changes his drone drastically. So now, instead of your body being bordered through walls when the drone picks you up, it just leaves pings over your head. Kind of like when you shoot an alibi decoy. 
---
"Come see what a real government shutdown looks like"
---
&gt; People just bitch because he's an annoying operator to die to. 
---
That's a perfectly valid reason to bitch about his design.
---
I read the female girl name for a split second as penokyo 
---
The number is purely from personal experience that I've had using them or seeing DMRs used.
---
The 5 shot average isn't purely about damage to kill but how many rounds people usually seem to spend to get the kill including misses or people just spamming past what they need.
---
It was a point to back up that I think 10+1 rounds is too little for a DMR and that they need 20.
---
True, but she is also very easily countered. She plays more of a role when used. Blackbeard was a literal god, especially if he was holding an angle or sitting in a window, etc. 
---
Lol just a bit ago I was cooking a grenade when I got team killed and then it resulted in me TKing my teammate accidentally

I delete old post because his don't needed he don't have picture. And i don't need karma.

10/10 would cargo short again
---
Not every map in the game is Fortress, there are plenty of areas where he can avoid long sightlines effectively enough to be nigh indestructible.
---
oh damn yikes
---
Very good although I'm gonna need you to take your shoes off in the house 
---
Are you trying to be funny now kid? 
---
Pro's in gold most likely only really play scrims and when they play ranked they are likely solo queueing or purposefully playing dumb just to mess around.
---
&gt; All players would need to do is get used to the timing, whip the mouse during the flash and whip back. 
---
That still sounds like quite the advantage to me, you're still forcing them to 180 twice. Plenty of opportunity to melee or hip-fire them after the flash. Even with them using a mouse you can't expect people to perfectly re-aim at where you are if you're strafing around them for the kill.
---
Also you forget that his current flash gets you even from behind, so that point is null anyways.

Also, pros have multiple accounts too, could be a solo account in another region where they just mess around. Pros need to have fun and let off steam too.

Because most pros do not enjoy ranked, either playing faceit or go4 on their mains. Therefore some arent ranked high atm

That's too limiting especially if you have a 5 man squad 
---
becouse i bought a time ago starter and i would like to upgrade it to standard if the operators would be cheaper in renown... so whats the correct answer?
---
does standard/starter edition mater in the renown cost for operators?
---
Simply call it "nostalgic cup"
---
Dropshot feels like a trickshot now tbh
---
If you had starter, you probably already have it upgraded to standard, so I suggest booting up the game and seeing what the prices are. It sipuid be 500-2000.
---
cav is not strong she is a close range operator that is only useful if you enter all alone and take a close distant fight its ez to counter cav, drone her out and have a teammate join you so you can refrag cav the operator is not strong if you know how to counter her
---
booted it up recently. still same year 1 operators 12500 and after that all 25000...
---
I believe friendly fire from guns should be removed, but leave gadgets as able to kill teammates 
---
That would be helpful
---
it appears your dog is a defender
---
Is baffles me how people have this notion that Echo is completely balanced and doesn‚Äôt need any changes. 
---
How is stopping a defuse safely from behind cover fair? There is absolutely nothing fair about that. That‚Äôs what makes him too strong. 
---
This is the most important change needed for Echo. Remove that function but give him a little buff elsewhere. 
---
Especially at pro play, if a team is able to get into a position to plant, why should they get denied by a player camping in a corner on site, not having to expose themselves at all. That‚Äôs a similar argument to Dokkaebi whereby she can use her gadget from a safe area (say spawn), and gets huge value from it. Completely safe. No risk at all. 
---
Echo should have to follow up and get the kill himself, if he wants to deny the plant going down. 
---
Teamwork. That's some real Rainbow spirit.
---
It all looks really good the only thing I would wanna see is figure out how to make the empty vials (?) Sit straight.
---
Backup any important files then reformat the hard drive.  Google if you don't know how to. You will have to reinstall anything on that drive remember.

I got ace by spawn killing. My team was laughing. But I got angry messages about it from the enemy team. Coppers are not the best 4 of them and one diamond. The diamond did the worst on the team. He can but check with your team first. For this time with me it was casual we were messing around.

My win% is 53.3%. Doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs high enough to be constantly clapped by plats.

you're forgetting that you can get away with the first kill, so nothing is stopping someone getting away with the first teamkill it needs a forgive system for the first teamkill.
---
Some decisions require the strongest will
---
theres plenty.
---
how to troll smurfs?
---
It's possible that because the season end is close, all the high ranked players go play casual because they don't wanna drop ranks.
---
A diamond player who hasn't played any casual in this season will start at 2500MMR (supposedly) which is low gold and he has to climb in casual as well.
---
It is also possible that you won a lot of casual and you have a high casual MMR.

Shame it took over 3 years to implement something like this...

When you pick fuze, the enemy can make it easy to never let you play your gadget unless it means certain death. Prepping windows, prefire after hearing fuze place one is all you need to do and he basically now has no reliable use for the gadget on all bombsites. At the highest level of play, I've been considering him a burden and even now still try to make him work for different purposes. However, he can do well at entry fragging for being tanky and with careful calculation, use cluster charges to draw out roamers into the open with a coordinated team to pick up kills. For example, in border you can cluster into customs from CCTV while your teammate is in detention to push a roamer. A very favorable gunfight (since he has to move to not get blown up, droning is a prerequisite of course) so the roamer has to back off and give up customs. If this is to help attack ventilation bombsite your team can now safely hold the hall next to metal stairs and continue to push safely into bathroom/tellers and begin to breach the site. Fuzing vertically is always safe but you could leave a charge on a barricade away from a roamer. This also involves another idea of mine to use fuze charges to slow down or cut off a rotation completely if timed right. 
---
Fuze isn't underpowered just misunderstood for his best potential as an operator. Like with frost, you have to get creative. These characters are ambiguous which I think is good for the meta rather than having every op fully fleshed out from the get go. Try some of these ideas, its worked out for me a few times and let me tell you it feels really good.
---
Where‚Äôs the tea-bagging? And the pretending to pick her up then near the end of the animation dropping her so she lets out a scream of anguish? Or throwing flash grenades at her?
---
It's fine, I think. I registered my game on a bad email so I can't do the 2 step verification but they transfered my game. They need some time ( my case was 2-3 weeks) but they meneged to do it. 
---
How is it training when blood is coming out

try to get an actual ssd, they are cheap as they never were currently. SSHD is a very outdated disk format and there is a reson it never went to be standard.

Just find it confusing that I‚Äôm the lone silver in match full of plats and diamonds. I‚Äôm sure my MMR isn‚Äôt that great to go against them.

The menu scenes are most likely done from the in game engine. The CGI cutscene is done by an outsourced company which costs a lot. Honestly people care too much about the menu background in this game.

---
Damn people be scrimming in casual now
---
&gt; at least with other ops you can actually shoot them.
---
Yes, and with other OPs they can shoot back, where Blitz has to rely on extremely shoddy hipfire, or expose himself to ADS.
---
I don't think I'm playing against bad Blitz', I think you're bad at playing against Blitz and want him nerfed. I'm pretty awful mechanically but make up for it by actually using my brain, so I hold my own in my friend's gold/plat stack, and Blitz is never an issue for any of us, even when its plats playing him, because we all figured out how to play against him. Maybe stop and think about things before making embarrassing complaint posts

'i learn how to react faster'. you can't, pressing in a mouse button is way beyond faster than clicking in a controller trigger, even with an elite controller, plus its much easier to land your shots when holding a mouse, so you can't 'just adapt'.

No, it's not making a hole on my screen but on his he can see straight through the hatch
---
&gt;Blitz has to rely on extremely shoddy ads
---
They literally are nerfing blitz for this reason, his ADS is way too fast, 
---
&gt;Im pretty awful mechanically but make up for it by using my brain
---
So by mechanically do you mean aim wise or what? Because most of the time if you arent playing mechanically good you arent using your brain.
---
And on the note about countering him, for anyone else that solo queues, hell even has 1-2 other people helping them, a coordinated blitz rush with ash, lion, ying, and even finka is a living hell. Most of the blitz players you probably played against solo rushed you and your team had communication and killed him because he was alone, throw another guy on the enemy team rushing you and he‚Äôs a nightmare

didnt they fix that back in the day with the paintings? i remember that happening when reinforcing, when the paintings on the wall would break and fall. and then they fixed it. and now its back again...

Everyone you see in this video is stuck in silver since the release of the game.

Why didn‚Äôt they drop shot

15% concentrated power of will...
---
Apparently not then
---
Mate, you just have no idea how strong he is at pro play, and high level ranked play. Your deluded
---
Yes you have counters, that counter Echo when you have someone who sticks them on the ceiling in the middle of the objective. That‚Äôs not how pro players play Echo. 
---
Take Oregon Laundry objective. The echo drone can often site near the bomb on the ceiling, around the corner, so much so that IQ can‚Äôt shoot it, Thatcher can‚Äôt capitalise when disabling it, and twitch has to drive deep into the objective after having to actually locate it, if she wants to destroy it. 
---
It‚Äôs not cut and dry whereby Thatcher counters Echo and that makes him balanced. Mute counters Lion but does that make Lion any less OP and broken. Nope. You just don‚Äôt get it whatsoever. 
---
There is a reason he‚Äôs always banned at pro play and also was the most banned operator in the SI playlist. Players know how strong he is (apart from you) and know that they don‚Äôt want to have to face that. 
---
Take a couple of other operators. Is nomad OP? You‚Äôll likely say no, but I‚Äôve been saying this and it‚Äôs true, she‚Äôs super OP in her current state and will get banned 95% of the time by pro players. Oh but pros could just shoot it and because of that, she‚Äôs balanced (your logic). That‚Äôs not how it works. 
---
I‚Äôm not arguing this point with you as you‚Äôll never get it, and it‚Äôll be like talking sense into a bowl of custard

---
so first i had to wait two hours, now its 3 days? 
---
Have you tried being asian?
---
idk i can ask you the same question, do the world a favor and delete this post 
---
&gt;Good to me
---
But you have no idea what you're talking about so..
---
&gt;and it was designed to be a Plane so keep it a Plane
---
It could still be a plane and not be an utterly broken shit map.
---
Nice play! Patience is key.
---
It got deleted anyway
---
Title says ranked but talks about casual 
---
I really hope this report makes the moderators ban you. Toxic children such as yourself only make this community worse than it already is.
---
Fuck off.
---
this was posted like yesterday 
---
coz lol
---
Good Lord
---
What comment?
---
I am no way shape or form claiming I am right, I am stating **MY** reasons for why **I** think Ranked is better, you don't have to agree with it. You have  **Your** own opinion that I am not slating.
---
 
---
&gt;I **think** the Earth is flat because there are no Ogres left alive  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Oh shit, it's just his opinion, he **must be right**
---
I have already several times stated you don't have to fucking believe me, I'm not asking you to, this is what I believe. Opinion is not fact, it is in fact personal opinion. I'm not right, but I'm not wrong, you're the one making out like thisd has to be factual information I provide. Do you even know the meaning of the word opinion? get off your high horse and let people have their own opinion, not everyone has to agree with you you sour cunt.
---
Please? Ela is totally worse than before. At release her weapon was like lesions mp on meth. She had a 50 rnd mag, same rod, almost no recoil and impacts
---
i use discord because my friend who i was playing with broke his controller with the headphone jack and the spare he had didn't have jack
---
kicked? they mustve because if you got kicked that means you have teamkilled too and if they tell you that u can mute them 
---
lol
---
I see
---
Hence the word seen in the title 
---
yeah i legit play my own counters on attack and defense but it sucks when they just thatcher it when we don‚Äôt even have a mute, bandit, or kaid
---
Gotta fuckin love all of the requests for a Blitz rework when he was PERFECTLY FINE before they randomly went in and buff the shit out of Blitz for no goddamn reason.  
---
Lol
---
the flash in the back makes it look like the gun went off in the air
---
Pc
---
Nothing is "un-hackable" as I mentioned earlier its possible to modify the entire console which would allow it, to cheat. Also Boundry Break has done some developer type stuff (such as going out of bounds on single player games) on it, so its very well possible.
---
thx
---
Yeah, fair enough. I‚Äôm still fairly new at this game, and new to FPS games in general, so I‚Äôve just been kinda trying out different things to see what suits me best. 
---
Just some insecure incel bullshit about facial structure being the defining feature of someone's life 
---
Yeah but not in ranked 
---
lolll IQ is a very strong attacker. she doesn‚Äôt suck just because you‚Äôre too bad to use her 
---
Holy shit this looks so realistic it took me a few seconds to realize it's siege
---
*TOOOMOOO*
---
*What's wrong, buddy?*
---
Fucking cringe
---
You can't control someone's action bro...
---
*t h a n k*
---
the oponents have a problem with aiming 
---
I can only seem to get aces with Bandit lol. My first one was on Tower, and I‚Äôm so mad I didn‚Äôt record it. lol 
---
Why is this nsfw?
---
This has been stated many times before.  It's because your shield doesn't always point in the direction you're looking when you turn allowing your entire head to get visible.
---
Gold is rather predictable actually, those golds are the people who got carried from bronze by the platinums
---
Sorry, just because I drop a few f bombs throughout the video and someone may be at work with volume on üòÇ
---
some bomb sites are just bad, but others aren't terrible and never get played at all so that when a team finally does play at one of these bomb sites I've noticed that throwing off a team from what they expect to be attacking can really mess with their strategy, and on some sites, people just don't know how to play, because they don't get the exposure to attacking that site. 
---
He saw me hacking and he intentionally broke the phone I was hacking, that was an accident?
---
Or an iPhone version?? For a wallpaper?
---
That's exactly why they buffed the shit out of him in the first place.  Like the devs don't understand the very simple concept of a "niche operator".
---
Bruh I get over 8 kills a game, it‚Äôs the teamates....
---
It doesn't happen to me much but it's not that big of an issue because u can just queue again straight after and anyway the games doing u a favour not putting u in a game in progress üòÇüòÇ

I too have plentiful hours in this game, and know it inside out like the back of my hand. Look, we are never gonna agree so we‚Äôll just call it there. Opinions are opinions. 
---
I just fundamentally disagree with everything your saying. That‚Äôs just me though 
---
Casual...
---
So a phone is more important than a  not having a 4v5
---
Cav. And a Ying main. I‚Äôm fucked with a well-timed Candela
---
untill rook spawnpeeks them to oblivion lol
---
Yea I know, but i think the resolo queue is not necessary... (Except if you can't find a server)
---
Yes, but make it only for the m870
---
No idea, it's been years since I played that game.
---
Extra security, can't trust your own cameras at times
---
rush and youve won
---
The SMG-12 and C75 are the opposites of the strongest sidearms. The SMG-12 is useless and the C75 isn't much better
---
(I play on console)
---
(Usually) it's Acog over everything else.
---
Then reflex, red dot, and holo are all personal reference. I go with holo, but the only difference is the shape of the sight, it doesn't zoom in faster or improve your aim. 
---
Me and my friend shot them all out lol
---
Maybe wait till it gets shot first, then stand in it, so they‚Äôll peek it and not shoot it again. There‚Äôs your shot.
---
Cringe level: 100/100

When it stops working tbh. It's literally just a meme thing at this point as posted... Repost it tomorrow with a title like "lean spam op plz nerf" 
---
BB.
---
He's broken.
---
Reworking Plane to make it competitive would require so much effort that the may as well make a new map.
---
Oh shit hey! That's awesome! Glad you enjoyed it.
---
Not in ranked because the loud minority (reddit) like to think they're in pro league. Everyone else would love more ranked maps, but instead 80% of people have to play casual.
---
I used to be a thermite mains once happy to see people still help and support their teams. 
---
The roaming video helped me get better at using Nomad to stop slow or stop roamers. I‚Äôve been maiming Ela and Mira and I‚Äôm leaning heavily towards Mira even though after watching the Ela video I‚Äôve been really deadly when focused
---
Thanks, will check them out 
---
A huge issue. It has been made so easy with the ranks being only an icon for your win/loss, deranking is so simple. It's only a hair harder than being boosted by a cheater, because you actually have to play and win the games, but it's safer, because you will never be punished for it, with a cheater there's the risk of being banned. 
---
Honestly it's a good map, good flanks, and I play the game to have fun not to take it seriously like my I decide the speed at which lobsters die
---
I don't get you. What do you mean? You seem to be going back and forth on your point?
---
Pc gold ranked is the biggest joke of all time 
---
&gt; Honestly it's a good map
---
Nope, it's one of the worst competitive maps.
---
&gt;good flanks
---
No flanks against people who have the slightest clue.
---
Yeah, *competitive* I don't play *ranked* I play *casual* with my *friends*
---
Your right, but I just deleted about 800GB of footage the other day. That shit fills up QUICK lol. This was during Operation Parabellum though, it was a while ago
---
Another reason why Ubi shouldn't allow people who are high ranks to play with lower ranks 
---
If you were paying attention, you would know that it's coming season 2. 
---
Where you playing all the ones I've got in a game with do it , fuck the one game my teammate spent the entire game outside even if we were defending 
---
Getting over 8 impactless kills can help your team nothing to win, its not about kills my friend and especially if you cant close out rounds.
---
Besides that, if you're an EU player you can DM me, i have a pretty active siege discord you're welcome to join
---
Stop bullying blitz mains!!!
---
He was a gold. üòÇ 
---
That‚Äôs what casual basically is
---
hey i just downloaded this game :(
---
You probably wouldn't get the full benefit from her as a solo-q player. But she is pretty easy to play, has a good gun, so I would run her on skyscraper and consulate or if you see someone run valk/echo consistently. Taking out any Yokai or cams will be beneficial without needing a lot of communication. 
---
Side note: Is there really even a reason to "main" ops? Every op is pretty similar in recoil minus some exceptions and their utilities are pretty simple. Why not play em all 
---
I wish, we might have won that game üòÇ
---
Weird. I placed in bronze and climbed up to gold 3. Then I dropped back to bronze. üòê
---
Your pants and boots looks like the J√§ger elite.
---
Or have the game select in order by most played operator based on availability.
---
Full Russian army he can place 2 times. 
---
Yeah but I just don't understand that person's thought process before he placed them üòÇ
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm bad. But you can‚Äôt tell me you don‚Äôt miss those frags....
---
Then be quiet :)
---
I‚Äôve never seen it on PC even with 90 FOV
---
i‚Äôll admit that i think the black viper for Ash is pretty nice but i‚Äôve only seem positive things about the Bandit elite 
---
Looking at it now maybe plats should be only be able to play with other plats and high golds and mid-low golds can play with coppers, bronzes, and silvers, and diamonds can only play with other diamonds and top players (when that rank comes)
---
Who can? Kap kan!
---
Thanks for this
---
Every little bit helps.
---
I'm an OG, but sometimes it helps to take a hiatus, reset and go back to basics.
---
ever been on insta? like 300 comments beneeth a post just straight up calling it trash
---
dude did you really just want to start an augment and back out when you lost
---
Friends and I call that play (and variations of it) "Operation: No One Should be There". Bamboozle the attackers by hiding or going somewhere they least expect.
---
Works every time.
---
coming soon
---
Well the TTS usually runs for about two weeks and then it drops. So whenever the TTS started, then add 14 or 15 days
---
Habit, I‚Äôm sorry
---
It‚Äôs literally coming in the second season
---
I don't think Hereford was fucked up. While I don't see it being the most viable ranked map even after the fix, at least the added stairwell makes it better.
---
Yeah, like wth. Why did I get downvoted 8 times for saying ‚ÄúI forth this‚Äù
---
Who uses impacts as a weapon lmfao
---
I don‚Äôt consider it broken. It‚Äôs a cool gadget, it does what it‚Äôs supposed to. 
---
The real skill comes from getting knocked by her gadget but getting up and focused on getting her down before she gets you down. 
---
What's ur ubi username? 
---
Exactly my point, he takes no risk to use his gadget, he can get an old footprint from prep phase and get led to exactly where you are... And after that get updates for a looooooong time
---
Alibi has a better gadget than Jager and Bandit you can‚Äôt be serious 
---
What does he do? A ping. Same thing can be done when a drone that is chasing a defender not to mention that has a live video feed. Dokaebi if you have good headphones can be even worse because it imobalizes them and also limits what defenders can hear. The defenders know when they are about to get pinged at can be used to bait or to make the ping useless. The only thing it does is let you know what room a defender is and get a potential wall bang.
---
Oh my god laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing
---
Definitely want this 
---
False. I see this shit on ranked all the time...
---
yeah i agree with you on this aspect. i dont think any 3 speeds should be allowed to get the 1.5. especially not defenders. im also targeting attack more. i hate just looking into someones soul in cqc 
---
not a better pistol by any stretch
---
Favorite op = Frost. Nothing feels better than a round winning welcome mat kill :)
---
Those cams glow blue on a white roof and there's no need to put two of them in the same spot
---
But what if my team needs me to pick Bandit, Jager, Valkyrie, or Lesion... he takes no risk to use his gadget, he can get an old footprint from prep phase and get led to exactly where you are, not only does he sees it, his whole team does... And after that get updates for a looooooong time
---
Naah, you can't consistently lose games if you're a good player. I often solo queue and although I'm a pretty mediocre fragger I still maintain myself in gold IV. With a complete team we are usually closer to gold I but still, I can't imagine myself dropping below silver even if I'm extremely unlucky.
---
Your 8 kills don't mean much tbh as they're all against other copper / bronze players so it's free kills for anyone with decent aim or a bad aim but a good map knowledge.
---
Btw. Don't feel bad about struggling, I was a copper / bronze until about level 100, you get better with time. Map knowledge, audio whoring and knowing the angles / vertical play means a lot in Siege and it takes time to grasp it all.
---
As a spook bitch main I can confirm that I don't play spook bitch to be effective, but instead to make people shit themselves.
---
I'll never understand reddit.
---
But yeah, the way Jager wiggles his hips is really funny to me
---
Also want to mention jackal scans 1 person at a time so if you can run to a teammate and cross fire or bait him even easier because he will be tunnel visioned on you unless he knows what youre doing but in that case he shouldn‚Äôt rush you
---
3 speeds should not have a weapon with a fire rate over 500. Fire rate and speed are everything in this game, having both is what makes ash a pain to play against
---
this is what competitive fps e-sports looks like
---
Either bait the jackal, or just don't move around unneedingly, if your tracked just move away from the position where he tracked you. Or be me while playing alibi and hid in a hologram whenever the scan goes off. It works surprisingly well, especially when he prefires the hologram and just gets fucked 
---
Thermite - those holes can win a game
---
Or sledge - holding an angle on the door are we? I shall make my own thanks lol 
---
Rook because i like the P90 and the armor packs. His revolver is pretty great too.
---
It really is, it does 78 damage on top of having less recoil.
---
Jackal I love turning the tables on dirty filthy roaming scum
---
She really does
---
"but, but it can do two things at once"
---
All you have to do is shoot them 
---
:(
---
If anything apex does the ping based communication the best. others should copy
---
i dont agree with 500, 500 is really low. i dont mind any fire rate on ops. i just dont think they should have the ability to have both an amazing gadget and a low recoil high damage rifle. they should make more weapons for 3 speeds that act like buck and hibana
---
Harsh dude 
---
I have been jackal tracked 3 times in a single round several times and not died by good movement and positioning. 
---
Just learn to counter him, take advice from these comments and git gud. 
---
Love the Sovietwomble style bullet edits.
---
i'd rather learn with time but i see your point 
---
Not if they're placed at a window barricade or behind a deployable shield.
---
And that's not a valid argument, because I could say that about any other placeable gadget.
---
ADS?  Just shoot it
---
Car Battery? Just shoot it
---
Grzmot?  Just shoot it
---
That's a stupid argument to make, considering every other placeable gadget is also countered by "just shooting it."
---
Furthermore, a good Alibi will place them in such a way that you *can't* just shoot it. like, just like how a good J√§ger or Ela will place their gadgets in such a way that you can't "just shoot it."
---
I'll get started on my guide. Can you just do text as well or only videos?
---
But I can shoot a drone lol... Once pinged, and all 5 know where you are, the offenders that are close are just going to pinch you... Not to mention, there‚Äôs a possibility that the whole 5 can hunt you at the same time... Broken
---
Hello, former IQ main who has been poking at her again. I have been player her vertical on maps that I can, sniping shit on ONJ from above then using breaches for some vertical kills. Is this a common tactic or am I just crazy? What‚Äôs the norm to use her now?
---
He gets 3 pings. Just run to site, bait, make a crossfire or try to go for a frag. I guarantee that if you learn how to counter him you will not even care when you get scanned. Also if Jackal scans you, think where you have been. You also know where be probably is. And always callout. If you are a solo player teammates may not help you but thats the thing. Its a team game. There are many operators who are useless in solo or are overpowered.
---
Some people have used nail polish containers for their needles, but I just went to a dollar store, and got some glow sticks, and used a metallic spray paint.
---
Isnt the Keratos droppoff now worse than the Luison?
---
Nah, the best way to learn is to find a competent team and listen to their advises. Competing against other unexperienced players won't do you any good.
---
If you're solo queueing then indeed wait until you're level 100 or so.
---
Jager cos his gadget is passive so I'm still useful even if I die instantly. Also he's 3 speed so I can quickly relocate/flank etc and his carbine is beautiful
---
Ha ha. Love the idea
---
Apex copy. Check dota 2 ping wheel. -_-
---
That was a joke my dude haha 
---
But if it‚Äôs a team game like you say, why is it a bad thing for him to have to call out instead of everybody instantly seeing where you‚Äôre at?
---
No
---
It is not broken. If you get scanned run or hide in a room with less destructible walls if he is so strong why is he so underpicked? If you can just shoot a drone ‚Äúlol‚Äù why was twitches drone nerfed? Just shoot it lol
---
A good player with a drone wont rush the defender and make the drone visible. If you do that you are wasting a drone.
---
Idk, it's still good tho.  It's got zero recoil and better irons so getting headshots is easy as hell with the Keratos.  It's better up close and at range by far.
---
New ops have had a good balance lately. If they have a high fire rate they have low ammo. The better thier gadget the worse thier weapon, there's always a trade off. 
---
Twitch and ash have mediocre gadgets but are 3 speed (which is too fast) and a couple of the best guns in the game. They are not fun to play against because they have a speed, fire rate, and low recoil advantage vs pretty much every defender. So to fix 3 speeds they need to take at least one of those advantages away
---
ping wheels are everywhere, but contextual reacting to other ping, all while the characters commenting on those with voiceovers. Thats unique.
---
"you just don't understand, you...you BOT"
---
r6stats says I have fired 0 shots with LMGs... and killed 3000 people.
---
Because the ping is through walls you have no idea which room because on a drone there is video and audio feed. He can be behind the room you think and a guy pinged will most likely be on the move and by the time you callout he has changed room and position
---
I WAS ROAMING BRO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
---
Cause people possibly see it as a cheap tactic... Just saying 
---
What my friends and I do is start up a custom game, and just run around a map with shotguns to test angles, while practicing callouts and just generally scouring the map. At least adding all the OBJs would make life much easier, versus having to start 4 custom matches (we had finally gotten around to studying Fortress)
---
This is a crazy idea. A 15-damage melee and 1 armor 2 speed is a big nerf. I hate Blitz as much as the next guy but these nerfs are near Blackbeard nerf levels. 
---
then i have no clue
---
Blackwatch is a Scottish battalion so they could probably use that.
---
I'd just like to point out the fact that the voice actor for clash can't be British, also I would enjoy another Scottish op or maybe an Irish one 
---
Sure, because a cardboard target is so much better. At least the white masks move around, try to flank you  and shoot back.
---
Of course they will never be a replacement for true players, but itws better than nothing.
---
Hello D1N0stique2002, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/av184n/smg12_still_usable/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Gold's and high silvers placing against low gold's, low silvers, and a fucking copper.
---
Then ur a good boio
---
r/falconpunchgifs
---
Is it really lore from r6?
---
(sounds obvious but just to be sure)
---
dont lie, you have done it at least once
---
I think they kinda scrapped the delta force operator portion of him. But more than likely the secret service member will be male. Yeah the raiders would be sick or I want pararescue. The guys that come and save the special forces units. They‚Äôre badasses
---
The entire reason why people are frustated with blitz is bcs he can close the gap on you, the counter being lucky enough to shoot his legs. and you want a full body shield covered operator charging and doing 50 dmg with no counter ? 
---
Dark Mode Rules
---
I'm jealous my first true ace was on villa when it first came out and I was mute and didn't even know so I didn't record it
---
That edit is class mate 
---
If any normal player needs to practice then they're probably not very good and don't have much more potential. Aim and game sense should transfer from game to game. Throwing yourself into matches will make good players better. 
---
That‚Äôs why i am to this day controversial about 1 shot headshot mechanic of this game. Imagine if we didn‚Äôt have it - we would have a similar EVO just like in BF4 when Ela just got introduced in Siege. Scorpion there was strong, but not an OP weapon. And i am not talking about different battle scales of BF and Siege. Probably a damage nerf would be still justified, but they could leave recoil as it was before if it wasn‚Äôt about oneshot-headshot....
---
1 OHS makes every fast rpm gun in this game cheesy to use. Scorpion was so bad on release because of that Ubi had to nerf it, to the point where you can‚Äôt skillfully control the weapon. 
---
It‚Äôs like a curse - Scorpion was nerfed that hard because  primarily because of that controversial mechanic
---
2 year old joke, still killing it
---
Right! I completely forgot we know what CTU he is. Now im disappointed all over again. 
---
But yeah AF Pararescue would be freaking awesome. Maybe somehow make him a K-9 operator. I wouldn't play anyone else. 
---
Loving how lesion and the German ops dress in jeans and cargo shorts like it's a casual Friday 
---
I've never successfully done it
---
Make him 1 speed, 1 armor so that shitters don't pick him and have to actually use a gun.  
---
His melee from a kill down to less than a quarter of health? Who hurt you?
---
It got the recoil lowered too. 
---
I think he means after the original nerf when it was totally uncontrollable and had the low damage. 
---
R6 stats are awful
---
Holes opened lol 
---
That's true, I guess, but the 1 shot headshot mechanic is what makes this game unique, and it adds a bit of realism to the game.  I think they could just change recoil back to what it was in Parabellum and/or give her the Impacts back, though you do make good points
---
How did he even get there?
---
hOldup
---
Came back from 0-2 near loss with just me and another dude. Whole rest of the team left but somehow we still kicked a**. 
---
Hes pretty easy to bait when hes tracking you
---
Damn
---
While I can agree, if you have ever seen a copper play, they are utter shit lol. I was smurfing in ranked to get back to my average, and as that acct never played ranked I was placed against low bronze and coppers, and holy shit they suck. I literally had pistol Aced one round; and the very next round, knifed three in a row and pistol killed 2.
---
Terrorist hunt for your aim and map knowledge will help out alot. When you play t-hunt only aim for the head never settle for anything other than a headshot it will help out your aim.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt turn him off right away, he‚Äôs not going to be in a suit but he‚Äôll have tactical gear that says secret service. Or at least I imagine he would. I really hope he‚Äôs a sniper. 
---
K9 would be sweet but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible on this engine for consoles. Hopefully next gen though! 
---
The guy asked how to practice to get better and you basically said "unless you're in pro league, don't" which doesn't make sense. What if they want to get to a high rank? Play in GO4s or other tournaments? Gotta practice for that. I consider myself good at the game yet me and my team are constantly practicing. 
---
It's fine, its fine.
---
you‚Äôre not lazy! just *efficient!*
---
Yeah I hope. Just tired of seeing non operator "operators" if that makes even a lick of sense. 
---
Also I agree. Although a man can dream. 
---
This is so accurate, I don‚Äôt main him but I love buck and this looks like real like but plastic. Sorry for American laws forcing orange tips and shit
---
The only written lore.  Takes place at the formation of Rainbow.
---
It was leaked to be a secret service but i would love a marine raider or green beret rather than a secret service operator
---
blitz obviously 
---
If you don't enjoy reading I wouldn't start with this imo, I picked it up like 6 years ago and still haven't finished it, it's not a bad book by any means but it's not really gripping or anything lmao
---
Preach brother
---
No, the game series is very loosely based on the book. The only similarities is that they are called Rainbow, the leader is called Six and that they are based in Hereford. Other than that they are nothing alike. But the book is great and I highly recommend it.
---
Or just don't afk when you queue for games
---
It does. Especially when you are breaking the door.
---
Will think about it :).
---
We probably won't be getting Israel ctu anytime soon 
---
It has been posted here plenty...
---
The screenshot posted to this thread was an error on R6Stats.com, not the official game page. So when people reply "r6stats" in the same thread we tend to think people are referring to us.
---
Sorry if this lead to any confusion, but I just wanted to be clear that the error you were referring to was not something wrong on R6Stats.
---
No one cares about your goddamn channel

Had a guy do 3 team kills this game this way. Also bodyblocking tries to get people up.

On top of that he was friend with one in the other team so they played together against our team. In the end they just sat on point so we all had to endure a REALLY long overtime for no reason.

Not quite sure what you are asking here, are you looking to find support for the game or do you have a question about the game?
---
Or you know, use a mic

My butthole was clenched the whole time.

General Reposti!

they are going to start remaking these older sets

Damn. Took you 123 lvls to get an ace? I got my first one when I was like lvl 20 something with fuse back during operation health on Bartlett.

Thermite is the worst op for newcomers to use, so easy to fuck up the whole attacker team. You can find a lot of free-weekenders breaching windows and doors with Thermite charge or don‚Äôt know where to breach. 
---
Well, Thatcher though I think he is supposed to be a good op for newcomers but in the actual cases I found they just refuse to do the teamwork thing and die early on even without using his ability.
---
Sledge has a good rifle which has nearly no recoil. However, if his ability is used on the wrong wall at the wrong time, that could be fatal for the team. And all the ops that can bring grenades will be dangerous if played by newcomers, especially in Hostage mode.
---
Ash, it seems that she is always being the core of attacker teams. Her strength won‚Äôt be optimised on newcomers‚Äô hands . But when nobody else wants to pick Ash, it then becomes a good choice for the newcomers.
---
Jackal, Ummmm. Yeah, maybe.
---
It‚Äôs not really a flick if you aimed out
---
lmao
---
I think there should be more forgiveness in casual tho, bc most games i load into everyone is goofing off and dont care.
---
Fuckin retarded.
---
lets hope its not part of paid packs again :)
---
Off topic, but can someone predict what will be that Thatcher rework Ubi once mentioned?
---
I can‚Äôt see anything but the amount of gadgets which would be disabled(not destroyed) to be increased, eventually leading to overall nerf of him....
---
This is an interesting idea. Blitz isn't overpowered but he **is** annoying, so this might make him use his gadget more strategically. Ubi would absolutely have to fix the shield desync before implementing anything like this though, since shields are already vulnerable enough when they are literally facing the opposite direction on your screen, and taking away his ability to do anything other than jog in the middle of a firefighter would be a death sentence with how disfunctional shields are now. 
---
So because i post this i am retarded (which means you formed wrong in the womb so the womb has to be cut open and the baby is removed, which doesnt affect intellegence/personallity)
---
This might not help but I play PS4 and on PS4 it is a serious flaw that if you join someone's party, if they have an IP software they can really easily access your IP. Maybe it's the same on XBOX?

Well I would say lion is a tricky one because I think that low win rate is by solo que. In solo que he is quite ineffective with a lack of communication but if you have a squad who communicate well you are going to be able to dominate because first shown by tachanka, standing still in the game is debilitating even for a short time and obviously if you moved your fucked

Support about the game. Because when I asked the ubisoft support to remove my store ban, I thought there would be other places to contact the devs of r6s or somewhat.

Probably no. Up to this point, if two operators are from different countries, they will form special unit, non-related to real world ones. So it will be mentioned that this operator is from F.A.P or whatever, but game still be considering him a part of one unit he and Mexican operator will be from.
---
P.S i didn‚Äôt f.a.p while i was writing it.

Right. you maybe could also have a self ban for yourself that is accessed in the home screen?
---
Its happening on console too. Can confirm
---
I get what your saying, because it frustrates me too most the time. But some of my friends are actually high silver low gold and I'm Plat 2 (I play with my better friends more often). So now I cant play with my lower rank friends? or is a plat 2 playing with all low golds and high silvers considered boosting?

I'm sorry.

I play a lot of t hunt on my own and I just use my pistol and practice flicking on the bots head or if you want recoil practice then play the op u want and use that gun and try and land headshots or maybe try play other shooters and try improving in those and it might rub off to siege example I recently started playing a fuck ton of bo4 and ive noticed my aim on there and in siege is pretty comparable. I would also try and find a new sensitivity

Yeah, maybe you‚Äôre right. Not gonna use all of it, but there are still a lot of stuff i want from the alpha packs

Never play casual with less than 3.

Sad but true.

It can mean both

Here it's good as in aimbot good

But sometimes it means bad, as in, as stupid as a bad AI

Just play as Caviera. Jackal can't track her Silent Step footsteps. 
---
did that. it doesn‚Äôt help at all:/
---
Running and gunning is not as successful like in other games. 1 shot headshot (except Ash), can't jump shot. Peeks around corner, different operator for each player except recruit. It's not 100 realistic but it's not CoD or Battlefield. And aure isn't Fortnite. So imo, it's seemingly realistic enough.
---
nope, i didn‚Äôt have anything deeper in mind! anything more is a happy coincidence! 
---
I think it would be fair is the rate of fire on his rifle was nerfed so it would shoot slower.

He never said he wasn‚Äôt dtf, either.

I‚Äôm almost positive it‚Äôs on the 4th/5th

Wait till Year 4 Season 1 drops. Ubisoft has reintroduced the aesthetic changes into the TS build. If no outcry then expect Siege to grow ince the 1 billion PRC players come online.
---
Have yiu seen that APAC team take on G2 during Sixth Invitational. Almost every Ranked game is that kind of standard of play as in close to ni tactics but insane reflexes. Also PRC was insisting on same server so 2019 could be the year of explosive growth. 
---
True, at least at 30 HP you'd have the ability to survive a stray bullet or two. Most situations at 20 HP you will not.
---
That's before my time, I came along when Hibana and Echo were here. It's not even that, i shot a sledge point blank and he preceeds to end my career while his health is left at 22. I sprayed him like Raid on roaches bro. 
---
they already changed him so that his rifle has faster fire rate, but less damage. I don‚Äôt think they would revert that, but the gun fires pretty fast as of now, at least for my play style.
---
TIL it‚Äôs called a sarong! :D 
---
People also don‚Äôt know to never solo queue on sundays. Casual and ranked just gets full of trolls. I‚Äôve literally tallied and studied my experiences since Chimera. Saturday after 3pm to 5pm eastern time all the way through Sunday, NEVER SOLO QUEUE.
---
That shit took me all the way down to Copper more than once, and within two sessions I got right back up to high silver-low gold easy just playing Ash/Ela and droning for myself. Lol
---
Fantastic way of looking at it but can i ask you this, is there a written list of rules for baseball that says performance enhancing drugs are NOT allowed,, there has to be right? (from uk no idea) my point is ubisofts list of rules doesnt even mention mnk
---
It truly baffles me 
---
Just remove the ACOG from all 3 speeds. 3 speeds are not supposed to be fighting at range. They are meant to take fights quickly, not from distance.
---
The R4C is fine as is. Just lose the face finder.
---
But that doesn't mean she's useless.  And he also thinks that the whole point of the gadget is to trick enemies.
---
We work with what data we have available. Unfortunately Ubisoft don't provide stats for us to show a true K/D for a weapon (kills and deaths with weapon equipped) so we show the only K/D we can.
---
I personally still find it interesting if I have more kills with a particular weapon than deaths to it - I'm not particularly interested in how many times I die with that weapon equipped as a death in R6:Siege is still a death, regardless of where it came from.
---
Everyone has an opinion, but until Ubisoft provide data that allows us to provide features such as a "true" weapon K/D we can only do our best with what data we currently have available.
---
Please do keep the feedback coming!
---
Why not the other one?

---
Chinese is used as an umbrella term for sinitic languages.

I could understand why they did it for the mp7 jager and smg-11 but ash?

Lol.  It's fine tho, no one's gonna use her anyways :(
---
I still use her tho
---
Me too.
---
The silver mindset üòÇ
---
Only one was a wall bang since the first shot next to the van 
---
Because they become a must pick the ACOGS and not many will run the other sights, They want players to use the other sights instead I wonder if with Year 4: Season 2 they'll introduce the sight coming with Gridlock and Capitao or not allow DLC operators have ACOGS. 
---
I have different error on PS4. Frequently the light on the Mira would bug out and remain red so I can't place it ni matter how I position it. Frequently have to try until after prep phase is over before the game decides to let it be placed. 
---
What?
---
I've just realized there is a map plan. This leads me to believe that a map from Greece will be some sort of old museum.
---
It‚Äôs an old glitch and an old clip 
---
Also I appreciate anyone who up votes this post for visablilty. Thanks. ‚úå
---
Because Ash is too good at killing with the ACOG so they removed it to balance her.
---
When you're camping in a corner as a defender and suddenly see "1 v 5" and 4 flashbangs immediately land at your feet...
---
Nah chief if you blow a soft wall or hatch and run in crouch and lean spamming, whilst firing your ACOG equipped R4-C at people‚Äôs heads with barely any recoil, it‚Äôs AIDS,
---
Yeah 
---
For balance. Ash still has the acog but not with the R4C. I still don't understand why some ash mains don't like the change. They still have a very good gun. If I was an ash main I would prefer losing the acog compared to getting the R4C nerfed. 
---
Waiting on that rework you promised Ubi
---
Depending on how long it is I'll be on around 3:30 CTE
---
I can hear it as long as explosions aren‚Äôt going off. What sound settings do you use? I know some people like the one that makes footsteps really loud but everything else quiet, you probably can‚Äôt hear it with that setting, but the default one you can.
---
That said, it‚Äôs better to visually check for it every now and then. I‚Äôve noticed people that use Mav, use him every round. So he shouldn‚Äôt be much of a problem to counter once you know he‚Äôs in play.

Just make second accounts cost money.

How fucking long did you stare at the lesion, and he just stared right back lol

I think that every player will discover reflex or holo sights and he will thing that these sights are as good as ACOG like me. You have to agree with me that reflex or holo are in some situations better then ACOG.

---
Just a separate mode like outbreak
---
Yup, I've been there and I agree that they're a bit too soft. Penalties include a 15 minute ban and a 30 minute renown reduction along with a reduction in MMR equal to a loss. Which isn't really much. You can just wait out a short 15 minute ban and the renown reduction is a complete nonfactor if you have all the cosmetics you want and own every operator. The MMR reduction just means the problem player is going to be matched with and potentially ruin the games of people of a lower skill level. 
---
While not perfect, a solution would just to implement the ever increasing ranked ban that would reset after a week like in CSGO. For example, first game punishment is a 15 minute ban, after that would be a 2 hour, then 24 hours, then upwards of a week ban. 
---
I would be okay if LMG'S and PDW's got the sight to boost their utility but not DMR's, AR's, Carbines, and SMG's.

Great work

That's the nature of casual matchmaking, no delays and no reserved slots anybody can just enter the match.

Plus kicking has always been a problem since year 1, the fact that vote kick is enabled on round 1 when people are trying to load in makes no sense at all also people can get away with teamkilling since they can rely on a buddy to render the vote kick useless since it requires the whole team to vote.

#my blitz rework idea
---
Kapkan stared into the void and the void stared back
---
What's worse is people have an alt for solo q. Maybe the 2 guys knew they were up against a 5 stack so quit out to save time. 
---
Good idea
---
Can you literally check the picture first and see that it literally already has the credit at the bottom?
---
You can see that Jager has a acog
---
He‚Äôs good if you can use him, at higher ranks you have to be more creative, put the traps around the map not just at the objective 
---
But IW didn't do BO1. Big think.
---
We have been showed to one to lead us to greatness 
---
Gotta love console siege.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with an Alt for solo q? And I doubt they knew it was a 5 stack and leaving a game to save time is a rather poor excuse imo
---
You don‚Äôt know anything he made fun of nix a current pro player for dropshot it him nix does not have cancer btw austin 2 made the video for attention 
---
*laughs in ela shotgun main*
---
Or if he made it where HS = DBNO state? That doesn‚Äôt seem completely broken, as most defenders can‚Äôt do anything after being downed (until revived). In a way, it‚Äôd be a slight buff to Doc in a sense that he has more usage to his gadget.
---
That...that changes nothing. Again, that's a lot of custom work for a 1 day event. It makes no sense from a business or a dev position. I get it, people think it would be funny, but it's not worth it and what we'd get vs. what the players would expect would be such a disappointment.

Wouldn‚Äôt that just be the same thing as giving an attacker another drone

I'm diamond, and when I want to chill in casual and play like a noob I get paired against superstar golds who see I'm diamond and therefore sweat their bollocks off. Played for 3 hours today and think I won 2 matches. Trust me it's worse for diamonds, usually getting tk'd or voted out.

Out of kaid and bandit, I honestly prefer tachanka.

The DBZ sound effect behind Monty had me rolling.

The video starts at 22 seconds 
---
Ya true but idk. It was console so the cheater thing doesn‚Äôt apply. I just can‚Äôt understand how my two teammates just didn‚Äôt use mics. I hate to say but they were just distractions for the enemy team 
---
But if an attacker goes to shoot the default cam they will immediately see the two valk cams. The complaint isn't what the cams are looking at, it's where they are placed.
---
Am I the only one that thinks this looks cringey asf
---
The difference when you solo queue that high is you have competent teammates.

Modern warfare 1 and 2, and 3 though. That was such a quality run

Probably because they‚Äôre stilling working on bugs and balancing issues

Old HUD too.

Nah blitz is still kinda weak in my opinion

Well you aparently gave it a go and i'll give your comment 4..... IQ that is but hey you wouldn't know better. The Meta goes in a circle (as you dont know) where teams have to drop down on certain maps. This balanced map of yours fluctuates so much in whatever rate you wonna discuss that the overall uncertainties become so big that i might aswell call it all data points outliers. You went with the basic flat eather view where if you look closely enough you'll get what you want.

And ofcourse i have too look a bit into your history of beeing a complete idiot and ass towards everyone and their cat so just a friendly tip, lay off the 12 year old attitude (and limit the quotes jesh we're bordering plagiarism here man) and then we can start talking.

Likely a Thad

Made me chuckle, should definitely be added

UwU
---
It takes a very small number of people start waves on the internet. 
---
Think of it this way, if you heard that "Siege is dying" or "X game is dying" for that matter then there are enough people spouting word of mouth for that game for it to reach you. Which means the game is being talked about, and is probably fine.
---
And the amount of players is still going up because, lets face it, the game isnt trash and the developers still care about it and you cant say that about activision or ea for example
---
I'll rather be gay then let you steal somebody's artwork for karma whoring!
---
shhhh that dosen't fit the narrative.

Add me on uplay: Bgeank

I've been looking for information on when this micro-patch came out. It looks like Ubisoft doesn't keep a comprehensive list of their patches. I'm not doubting you either, I've seen a few of these small patches for myself. 
---
He only asked you to credit the original artist why you getting angry about that? 
---
This is art
---
Soo,we are reporting this guy who stole the art right?

u/vreddit_bot

That was me 1st playing the game lol
---
Blitz
---
Haha yea it is
---
Lol. Sad you can't win without cheating 
---
Reported.
---
Thanks :)
---
Fine OG artist @fuzeGaNg
---
Yo lemme see that clip lmao
---
making it permanent is a bit of a stretch but maybe if it was from october the 10th to october the 30th and new cutscenes, missions and loot every year now that would be something to look forward to 
---
&gt;Yes, I just didn't have anyone else to place the reinforcements (Since you can only put down 2) If you place reinforcements on the upper floor, you can really lock down tower.
---
Few words slapped on a picture of space? Is the art even yours? Doesn't look like r6 theme at all, too random. At any rate, I hate fandom operation theme posts, there are just too many.

No no, Thank you.

Or when you purposefully try and land it one the window sill and it bounces in and gets taken out by an ADS... That's almost worse for me.

My favorite universals were blood orchid

QEC, spamming

All sights for all guns. Gimme the CQBSS on Maverick
---
My pp also does the biggining. 
---
It's up
---
I'd rather they stopped giving any guns unique sights. The entire point of not having custom sights was that they could balance the pros and cons of a small number of sights and now we have ridiculous stuff like acog pistols and special red dots for nomad. Next season looks like they've changed the acog for the M249 so only capitao and gridlock will have access to it. I'm just worried that they're removing balance for a gimmick.
---
Yay
---
Dont like... It has 666... Nvm lol
---
They are making it so glaz can't have banana vision when moving and they call it a rework. Idk how they define it.
---
Lmao that blast radius
---
As a lesion main, I take offense
---
What I mean is that with a stun grenade you have time to look away. A grenade is thrown into the room, you have a second or two to react. With Blitz, you are instantly flashed once he's close enough to affect you with his shield, and it's significantly harder to keep him at a distance than to simply look away.
---
Appreciate your support dude, I really do, I hope I can deliver you more joy in the future

There was an app on iOS called R6S Tactics that was pretty good. Idk if it has been updated. Likewise, search on google r6s maps. I remember seeing a website that helps with that
---
Same. I‚Äôm just shy of 500k, but I spent on a number of uniforms and weapon skins each season. I like what I bought, but I would‚Äôve liked 1mil more!
---
it‚Äôs okay haha, switching over soon. just going through the captures
---
It's not possible to give you a general answer, because this depends on the situation, map and mode.
---
Great for you buddy
---
Pretty close. I don't think thwy're gonna make it his elite and I kinsa hope not

sorry for the passive aggressiveness... but someone had to say it

Ok thanks

Good Shit. Very few people can keep my attention for the length of time it took me to read and look at a great concept.
---
Hey kid, you should fuck off.
---
Ur face has asshole on it. Nothing u say has any relevance or meaning

Bet he's playing Buck and still killing himself anyway
---
Spooky Bitch

Jesus fucking christ.

This just makes me angry
---
It‚Äôs uh been 7 hrs I thought I was done with this but I‚Äôm back I guess 
---
Nope nothing stays 
---
Nope.
---
Just gotta hold dem angles boi
---
I thought these died out 6 months ago. 
---
Spooky Beep

God the amount of people getting pissed at that was crazy. Smash fans are something else
---
I typically play with 5 stacks on bomb (gold ranks) and I'm leaning towards maestro but I'm scared of the ash mains that will make all of my bulletproof shootys disappear, Valk can hide her cams.
---
I can't even count the amount of times I've managed to kill myself with my own fuze grenades...
---
I said face not... Dat ASS!!! There's nothing sexual about her face.

All those kids he killed with his bare hands would finally pay off eventually

Sadly not, it‚Äôs kinda a bummer when it comes to cosmetics, cause I have a fuck load of cosmetics on my ps4 and next to nothing on my pc and it saddens me.

Thanks. Took a while. Happy people like it

Friendly AC-130 airborne, en route to AO, over.

Mods use Vega cards and are trying to suppress the issue so they can continue to cheat obv
---
Oregon for sure 
---
Piranha is rude too.
---
Sounds like the cpu bugg
---
Run
---
why is this so accurate
---
The person who said that was probably trolling. Hostage is a toxic shitfest one should never attempt to play if trying to enjoy the game in a serious or competitive manner 
---
And the carbon pro leagues are nothing like the originals. You just foiled your own point. 
---
Many people consider it a gendered slur. What are you, some kind of nazi???
---
That checks out 
---
Well other than going jager, best bet is to hold longer angles and hold areas that cant have nades thrown at them, which is pretty rare. 
---

I thought you were gonna teabag and I was getting pissed. ABout to say you had no right to do it after that
---
Yeah I am bit late, because I bought the game two days ago.
---
Oregon. Not my favorite map, but the most balanced and consistently enjoyable for me 
---
but, did you like it? or is it just a phase?
---
i get what you are saying. but a team with Doc makes Doc more valuable than before. the reset hurts attackers and defenders, but defenders have a Doc, and the attackers kind of dont. i dont count Finka, and even if i do i rather be a defender with Doc in my team than be an attacker with Finka in my team.

Post this on the TTS reddit. Maybe they‚Äôll add in the change before the new season and check out the r6fix subreddit too

At least he knows how to abuse the meta

If we were to only count his leap year b-days, he‚Äôd actually be 12, 13 next year.

Yeah, ignore the haters man, your art is great.  Especially the one with Kaid and Ela.  Still cracks me up every time I see it.

Are they having another revolution? If they are I'm down to protect my queen in battle.

Troll?

Depends on the map, and your knowledge of said map. Chalet and Yacht are two of my favorite maps for Kapkan - Oregon can be pretty alright too.
---
You don't usually want to put a kaptrap on obj - it's predictable and easily spotted.
