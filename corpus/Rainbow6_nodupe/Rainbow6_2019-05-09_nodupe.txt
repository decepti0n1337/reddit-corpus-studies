Hibana still OP

---
I see. It's a weird tool, but I hope to get used with it.
---

---
The poor guy I killed by accident was level 3, I think he doesn't know about the forgiving system.
---
Reverse friendly fire, activated after you TK once
---
Makes sense.
---
Like I said... **in your opinion**
---
Friendly fire reversed.
---
why should they copy working systems from other competitive games that have evolved over years with far better ranked modes? that would make too much sense.
---
i just started this game 2 weeks ago and i totally see where you're coming from but i dont think this needs to be explained since its pretty much obvious for anyone playing ranked. seems like the devs dont really care, just like MMR is apparently hard reset every season. whats the point of MMR with huge swings at the start and then reset it every few months. its frustrating for veteran players to get matched with new players that dont know every callout perfectly on all the maps, as it is for new or low ranked players to get their shit pushed in at the start of every season.
---
I have no clue but I'm thankful for the free kill üòÇ
---
lmao, it happens
---
I have failed the siege community
---
Favela needs a rework, and Bartlett as well.
---
I just saw this was wondering the same! I googled it and I appears to be that that person has reverse friendly fire
---
Oof
---
That they have been team killling
---
Hit reg machine broke
---
But how do I get into the Siege server at that point? I've linked my discord and xbox, but where's the server?
---
Sometimes you start a ranked, it goes on for much longer than expected and you have to leave, no choice in the matter, so maybe it‚Äôs best not to remove something like that. P.S. if someone wanted to leave the match if that happened they could just close the game.
---
Whaaat? Is that on default or am I dumb and turned it on?
---
My gf just sent me that and got ddossed right after
---
Cool
---
Teamkill warning
---
I feel like the first week TKing will go up just to see what happens. Like- we all know what‚Äôs going to happen but we are all going to experiment. Just please experiment on a willing friend.
---
Airsoft is illegal in Australia, it's a toy gun for kids
---
I'm excited to see it!
---
or Favela
---
If u read over what you said in the post, u said that if u get tked u can vote it as an accident, which makes no sense
---
Lol
---
That‚Äôs dirty
---
that doesn‚Äôt make sense then, if they could just close game why have the button?
---
Nope, there are preferences for multi-player too
---
You think you've seen it once, you've seen it all, until this shit happens.
---
Same as the last time; it's one of those lights and sounds toys for kids that I pulled the internals out of and worked with just the shell.
---
You can still TK once tho then the RFF activates
---
Oh my GoD STOp REAlodINg
---
Nice vid though man.
---
Then they could just close their game. Or unplug their console/pc. You havent really thought about this have you?
---
Maybe instead of surrender at the beginning you vote to "forfeit" because it's a 4v5. No penalty, no renown lost, no deranking, just end screen and then the main menu
---
Reverse team damage
---
Nice
---
NS not gonna lie
---
MP7 Poggers

Playing Secure on Bank, picking CEO as first round defence then rushing down with Mute jammers to the basement and doing up all the windows. 
---
Its hilariously fun every time.
---
Happened to me twice this season and just two days ago to my cousin lol mid games we get kicked for no reason and it won‚Äôt let us connect back. Where you partnered up ?
---
Maybe heal 1 teammate and if voted a accident you get the health :D idk lol
---
Look up rainbow 6 discord server
---
exactly? And if they close app they get a ban longer than just 30 minutes. You haven‚Äôt really thought about this have you?
---
Im a peasant, how do you add your main?
---
lol I‚Äôve done that once too
---
That‚Äôs casual my friend.
---
They are invincible for the the first 2 minutes of the next round.
---
I am considering starting up some commission work.
---
&gt;Jackal is a crutch operator
---
Hahahahahahhaa good joke
---
Then it broke me
---
And just don't tk anymore, there way less flaws than benefits for RFF
---
my heart rate fucking jumped
---
It's on by default, feels like a whole new game when you turn it off.
---
Is this the red triangle thing next to names now?
---
There's a 2.0 second animation from the point of breaking the canister, only issue is it can be affected by ping and does fall under client-side debris, as well. Prefiring black mirrors is basically a death sentence, try Mira tricking if you think you've got a sweet spot. Works really well somewhere like Favela where one spot overlooks a high traffic area.
---
The most relatable comment, though I remember one time I rappled into a windo and killed cav by landing on her or something? I have no idea what happened and ive never done anything like that since, all I know is I was glad she was dead, even if I don't know how
---
So they unplug their console/pc? Or they turn off their modem and disconnect that way. Oh, you want to punish those players harshly? What about all of the random disconnects that haopen due to the servers dropping or just internet spikes in general? So you want to punish everyone because of your inability to make friends and squad up with people who won't leave? I really hope you haven't thought it through. Because, if you have, and still arrived at your current conclusion, then I don't think theres any hope for you.
---
Does it affect multiplayer or just t hunt ?
---
Yeah for a solo queuer gold isn't bad especially for a beginner. Learning the maps is very important but also watching videos of operator tips and counter-tips. Good luck have fun
---
trying changing your vsync. i have the og xbox one too and this is how i get 60 frames
---
No, fortunately I didn‚Äôt know the guys I was teamed with so I technically didn‚Äôt disappoint anyone I know. The fact that everyone puts in the effort and pushes through 9 rounds of gameplay just for it to not only kick me, but also *punish me* for it is a bug or server issue that seriously needs addressing and could cause new players and impatient players to dismiss the game altogether. I‚Äôm too addicted to it as a great game overall to boycott it over this happening once, but you catch my drift. 
---
DEV‚Äôs, if you happen to read this, thank you for constantly updating our game and keeping it fun to play still, 6 years later. This is simply feedback for you guys to know something went wrong, and is not intended to be slander or negative speaking towards the game or you guys whatsoever.
---
It literally only helped pro league, she wasn‚Äôt popular before and she‚Äôs even less popular now
---
Hereford also has no bombers although there is one single C4 that spawns on the top floor sometimes.
---
Reverse friendly fire
---
Only t hunt.
---
Pardon?
---
You shoot a teammate you get hurt instead
---
They implemented that already?
---
Okay, well thanks. That will change my use of t hunt then lol
---
Earlier today yes
---
dude. scroll down like 2 posts and figure it out yourself.
---
Mira was assist though. Can you do better next time please.
---
Does this happen in game??
---
What happens when your team mate quit
---
Link? This is a sick keycap
---
FINALLY IT'S HERE, I'VE BEEN COUNTING DAYS
---
He..  But I'm working in another op who will counter this....
---
Random disconnects from servers and turning off modems are 2 different things. The ‚Äúinability to make friends‚Äù remark literally just proves you‚Äôre the kind of person to leave the game because you‚Äôre being 3-0d. Just like for honor, when you randomly disconnect from a match you don‚Äôt get a penalty. When you close app and leave the game it turn off the modem and come back it‚Äôs 15 minutes. All I‚Äôm saying is they could implement that system into siege, Jesus Christ get a fucking life. It‚Äôs a suggestion you fucking arrogant cuck
---
Mine appeared red and i didnt tk
---
Neither does blitz shield tho
---
Thanks :) yeah been watching a bunch of them, so many maps to get used to also! what sort of level will I come against full teams on a regular basis, will that be more plat/diomond level?
---
It's an option for a mostly cohesive team to be able to kick trolls and toxic players. You are most definatly toxic and upset you can't get free reign.
---
Can it be abused sure do people... no in my experiance if you aren't  a prick you won't get kicked. End of story.
---
Why is the first answer just Jihad
---
I wonder if that would work or if it would kick in before the 2nd teammate was killed. Someone should test this out.
---
I'm enjoying watching the idiots kill themselves once its activated.
---
No room on there for my main man monty :(

You can still kill people using equipment like nades, i believe because of that they will still keep the 2 kill kick inaddition to the RF System.

The new one is structurally better but the old one is aesthetically better.
---
Most logical answer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Comfort seems important and should be thrown in with the controls somewhere
---
Nah cus after the first teamkill there‚Äôs a timer for the person to choose whether or not they wanna kick, and the c4 explosion would kill everyone at like the same frame, game wouldn‚Äôt have time to register it
---
That would be so good, never-have to see tower, theme park, or fortress ever again, that would be the dream
---
Everything is proportioned or shaped wrong... I mean look at the hatch lmao
---
Doesn‚Äôt affect casual/ranked for me t hunt caps at 70-80 and mp is 60
---
I have never won a game on new hereford. None of the angles make sense, there's too much. I'd rather play old hereford in ranked than that monstrosity.
---
Is it a new thing
---
Ah yes makes sense
---
No we killed him
---
He wasn‚Äôt even the poster
---
Redo the floor pls
---
or maybe an inventory that shows everything you have
---
That would be MUCH appreciated, and very simple to add. Ive lost some of my earlier alpha pack items to the menus, never to be seen again.
---
Maybe he tked and he gets that symbol?
---
It should but highly unlikely that you got 4 whole matches removed due to hackers. 
---
Are you sure the game didnt accidently place you on another server region? Click on the menu icon and check the server and ping.
---
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas.

PriesT has amazing aim for using a controller.

Yo since when did they add the Titanfall logo? Lmao

that's siege for ya

You‚Äôre putting words in my mouth because I never said he was overpowered. Also, where are you getting the info for his adjustment? I haven‚Äôt seen anything. As for my argument, I‚Äôm not talking about adapting to him, because despite how easy it is for him to counter that adaptation you could still do it. No, what I‚Äôm saying is that his ability has max benefits with almost zero drawback. This unfairness is also present in the fact that of all the hard breachers he is the only one who doesn‚Äôt have a hard counter.
---
Its the first edited video pls no bully :(
---
This is bullsh*t and everyone knows it. We all like to tk when we get mad or messin around why not keep the fun going
---
Trolling is going to get all the more fun.
---
Last match, 3 players on my team and 1 on OpFor were marked for FF. Every match tonight there is so much TK going on. It‚Äôs like people want to test the limits.
---
Fabien gets replaced?
---
My friends are so annoying they don't even like to play bomb and shit so if there is a map option even to this small degree I will never play certain maps
---
Yes
---
The wagon that the band of people are riding on that are all shouting ‚ÄúUsing a M&amp;K on console is cheating‚Äù.
---
Yeah Lone Wolf is torture though. I just played 4 rounds of it for bullshit amounts of renown.
---
It has a purpose so I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs usesless. Dumb maybe but not useless.
---
Good deal
---
Because it is...

Yeah, I only play thunt to improve aim or complete the weekly challenge

Having gotten to Plat 1, it gets SWEATY with MnK users. The reason people do it is because it‚Äôs not that enforced. Hell, Microsoft SELLS products that allow you to do it.
---
I've played both and console is a lot more toxic than PC. People tend to tk more on console than PC and people ddos the servers on console. PC is chill with the occasional shit talker or cheater. That's all bye
---
They can still kill you 3 times though can't they?
---
You have to be blind yo have not seen that blue light

oh yeah chances are if your bring a shotty to a gunfight you're not holding long angles. 
---
Shields and shotguns are imo has not disadvantages with running lasers.
---
You can see all electrics gadgets. Thats all.
---
Yes, obviously
---
Yea I know that but a lot of people on PlayStation say otherwise
---
You can't lean at all if you use a keyboard on console?
---
Well it depends on how much renown you would earn. And if it‚Äôs a really good clutch   a couple of salty enemies could just vote no. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a terrible idea but just needs more thought and some baseline.
---
That‚Äôs not a bandwagon. The M&amp;K on console debate has been going on years before siege.

Is waiting 10 mins for a game, just to get a hundred renown worth it when you can play lone wolf, complete it in a few minutes? Bro, say it takes you 2 minutes per lone wolf. You could complete like 5 per 10 minutes and earn 180 renown, give or take. The trade off just isn't worth it my man.
---
you are joking, he is saying i am awful for being plat 2 and playing with friends that are gold. i can solo queue and carry my weight
---
Sure, but they still cause damage. If you‚Äôre not terrible at the game, you can easily charge through Ela‚Äôs traps and get a kill with no lasting repercussions
---
It is not.
---
No one knew who he was but I do now and he is
---
Was this on Tower? I think i was the Cav...
---
Whats wrong with yacht??
---
PC players wont complain for several reasons. The most obvious is that almost every PC game just allows you to use whatever input you like out of the box. Secondly, the advantage m&amp;k gives in fps isnt really comparable to anything else. Then there's the price of entry, an adapter that costs $125 usd is anywhere between half to a third the cost of a console depending on when you get the console, add in the cost for a decent mouse and keyboards. PC player can do the same thing in reverse for the cost of a $30 controller. It's the most blatant pay to win outside of paying a booster.
---
¬≠
---
Beeg mood reading this thread.
---
I died laughing
---
You can't get kicked out of the game if you kick everyone else out first
---
The way I play Ela is for intel than use the gryzmot for frags. Eg. If I am defending kitchen or archives in bank, I put mines in the server stairs and the alley entrance. They act as intel. I just communicate to my team where they are pushing from and try to flank them. I never go for kills when they are concussed unless it is absolutely necessary.
---
Why‚Äôd you record it on a phone?
---
Which one?
---
Why don‚Äôt they just add pick and ban for maps on ranked like pro league
---
we were playing ranked on kafe and i was roaming first floor watching the entrances by white stairs and i heard him coming in and killed him. then he sends messages saying i‚Äôm bad for crouching walking and being 2 floors away from obj

I have a feeling that this console generation will be the last when it comes to m+kb adapters. Next gen consoles will probably have something to combat it.

Ranked
---
 I disagree but hey everyone has their own opinion.
---
To be fair, it seems Microsoft still has a head on their shoulders.  
---
They don't officially support anything that does this (I don't think)  
---
Not sure who at Sony thought this was good but ew
---
On PC and you don't use your mic? Yikes!
---
What is mnk?
---
Easy fix here. I think halo used to have a system where players would vote for A. B. Or a random map.
---
My original gets 60 with Vsync off, and a solid 60 in multiplayer
---
Every game with Mozzie on the other team is a mini horror game.
---
Mouse and keyboard
---
The clip made me jump
---
No because we would only see the same maps over and over until we get sick of them
---
Weird that people complain about mnk while they're using controllers with 4 extra buttons and a CronusMaxü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
(enter some tldr post about how mnk is "different" - when both are literally just an advantage)
---
True. It's just that half of them are wrong.
---
Well yeah it's an unarguable fact that mnk aim is a massive advantage over analog stick aim. That's absolute fact. 
---
As for CronusMax, that's cheating too. It's macros.
---
Man I got scared
---
Oh no, it's retarded.
---
at least u got the daily done LULW
---
The only people who think otherwise most likely are the ones using mouse and keyboard.
---
thanks daddy, you‚Äòre the man!
---
Check his twitter, smart person. He didn't make this tweet. OP used inspect element and made gullible people like you angry. Who's the retard now?
---
I was referencing the first post to this thread.
---
you are fake news
---
&gt; t I've always felt that the intention of outside was for attackers to be able to choose an entry point to "siege".
---
And the intention of the defenders to be able to run outside is to punish the attackers that believe they are safe outside the building. 
---
The defenders that are running out puts themself at a big disadvantage, Sound of the windows breaking, Not knowing where the attackers are 100% accuracy since they dont have drones like the attackers, Being spotted after going outside all while having to deal with anti runout equipment and operators. 
---
&gt;My grounds for assuming their intention, by the way, would be the fact that the spotting mechanic for run outs exists at all.
---
The spotting existing to give the attackers an advantage since the defenders have their prep time to set up traps and lines of sight. Attacking in most maps (especially on this meta) is harder than defending and if the defenders can stay outside without being detected it will make it next to impossible to win some attacker rounds.
---
No comment has ever been more true.
---
(looks like a clown)
---
*YOU'RE A SNOB AND THIS IS CLOWNLAND ANYWAY!!!* 
---
Also, your point is that extra buttons isn't "enough" of an advantage to be cheating - which is almost as bad as your grammar.
---
You saw blood, and that means you got a hit and it registered. Your shot just missed the head.
---
how the person being shot is gonna check it? he cant see your screen
---
Yea, it's frustrating AF... :(  
---
Sometimes, casual won't be casual with people like them... :(
---
you don‚Äôt understand the advantages of running out? preaim it, learn, bring claymores, and drone popular runout spots. it‚Äôs not exactly the most difficult thing in the world
---
Shits dope asf
---
420 retweets hell yeah
---
Bud, one is supported the other is not, it‚Äôs as simple as that. 3rd party is what makes it cheating.
---
Yeah but Fuze users should use their brains now and look at the outline of their teammates and if they are anywhere in vacinity before letting off the cluster charge...
---
I mean if you‚Äôre sitting here claiming a pro controller is and advantage in gaming, then you also need to acknowledge ‚ÄúRazer Deathadder‚Äù is also an advantage.
---
Literally my only argument;

Cheating 100%
---
I would love it if the system did some math and figured out when, say, group members are TK'ing people who aren't in their group. Like if it happens every round, it's no coincidence and RFF should be automatically turned on for the entire group or some other penalty given.  
---
From my own experience the most toxic shit I experience is that from groups. Groups need to be discriminated against more and this new RFF system can tie in well with it. I just hope Ubi adds something for this because in its current state, group members can just take turns teamkilling you.
---
552 Commando &gt; AUG and LMG
---
You guys ruin casual
---
How does that make the game better though?
---
Except mav doesn't change play style. Defenders don't play any differently now he's in the game other than getting randomly killed.
---
Pro controllers can spam crouch and spam lean. Which... Last time I checked was such a problem that it had to be changed within the coding of the game so.. Yeah dude, their tools you cheat with.
---
I think we have different definitions of continuous

but what about the fact of the law of truth?
---
Anything older than Windows 10, not natively. I'm on Windows 7 and I have to download specific drivers. Anybody playing on a Linux distribution won't have native drivers, and that includes MacOS.

Excellent counter argument

Just make a m&amp;kb lobby like other games. I play on both PC and Xbox. I mostly use Xbox because it's where my friends are. I'd love to use m&amp;kb again. It's way easier to convince someone to spend ~$60 for a cheap m&amp;kb combo than ~$1200 for a PC.
---
Keep pursue on the attackers that are moving into key rooms with external walls. 
---
Skyscraper (Almost all the room have external walls and windows) the defenders and always contest the attackers who has more acogs, nades and operators like glaz while being inside the room, run outs keep the attackers under pursue and make them second guess they push or make them waste manpower keeping an eye on those runouts. 
---
Similar things on maps like border, vila,thempark,  bank(windows postplant bb holding ceo window is still op and you have to runout most of the time)
---
haha good joke!
---
I understand that it is using an alternate account to play against lower levels, however it is not cheating. Unfair? Yes. Cheating? No. If someone buys the game twice, they can play on whatever account they want. Smurfing is bad but shouldn't be bannable.
---
Oregon, border, or coastline every game
---
I think, console should gives developer more option to whether dev could activate MnK on their game or not
---
I guess it‚Äôs cheating right now. However, If the ps5 and the next Xbox can accept a mouse and keyboard, I think it won‚Äôt be cheating since everyone will have the option.
---
Mav is the primary reason I stopped playing the game so much. I hate how they just throw out the years of developed meta and make a bunch of ops redundant for absolutely nothing. He doesn't improve the quality of the game at all.

Spend all that time setting up the site only to die to an undefendable angle with no warning or chance to counter at all. You basically can't play anchor on site any more which I fucking hate.
---
That‚Äôs the point.
---
Non of these arguments are ‚ÄúGood ones‚Äù 
---
If pro controllers were cheating, they wouldn‚Äôt allow them in events and tournaments.
---
It‚Äôs like cheating for remapping buttons. How does that make any sense?
---
&gt;can spam crouch and spam lean
---
Was patched.
---
&gt;it had to be changed within coding of the game
---
Yeah, good point.
---
I'm able to spam lean with my normal controller, though. I don't need an elite to do it, thus it's not an advantage. As for crouch, that's patched as you stated, but it was doable on a normal controller with a little remapping via Xbox Accessories.
---
&gt; Attacking in most maps (especially on this meta) is harder than defending 
---
Would you not say that this alone would be grounds for my proposition. Seeing as how often defenders run out, only tipping the scale in the defenders favor?
---
I like that reverse teamkill system.
---
That'd be back to back to back
---
WHERE IS THE LORD!
---
Fun fact: the Xbox Elite Controller still uses analog sticks, therefore your point in relation to mouse and keyboarders is invalid to the extent of aiming.
---
Fun Fact #2: the muscles in your index finger are more developed than your other fingers; it is rare to have the ability to press down on a button fast with your other fingers.
---
Fun Fact #3: The Elite Controller's *pedals* are designed for the ring and pinkie fingers. Both of which cannot press buttons fast enough to be considered a real advantage.
---
Fun Fact #4: there is no such thing as lean or crouch spamming anymore in siege.
---
So essentially the only thing correct with your statement is that Elite Controllers have four extra buttons. (And the TLDR bit). They are designed for comfort, not for advantages.
---
No, because you didn't trick the game into thinking it was a keyboard. The game knows it's a controller you are using.
---
In the case of consoles, the game thinks it's a controller but it's not. You used software to make it think it's a controller. If the game knows, it's a keyboard, nobody got any problem, but as long as it's not the case, it's cheating.
---
They do, thats for native k&amp;m support. But then sony goes on to officially support a k&amp;m that has emulator support to bypass that.
---
Thats why you only play hereford and outback in terro hunt.
---
I killed my monty with a nade too...

Lesion and Maverick. Although no matter what you do Maverick will work
---
Why? It was a shit map. Lot worse than Yacht. Thats for sure.
---
Disappointed how it could not be a bakugan battle with ying
---
And how would you stop false positives? Elite controller users with sharp inflection points? You think Epic gave up lightly?
---
PS4 already has the capability to accept Mouse and Keyboard, it's up to the developer to decide if they want it to be allowed. With Siege it's not allowed and requires external devices to make it work

It‚Äôs ok that you‚Äôre bad with a controller

you‚Äôre just a bronze secure player. too simple

---
Second sticky post on this subreddit. All the info about it is there
---
yeah, no shit
---
But you know where your target is going to be, guessing is half the game, If someone peeked you either shoot their head and if you miss, you need to adjust your crosshair according to player movement and recoil, now if at that moment the opponent presses crouch you need to react to that.
---
Previously you can't because of the spam. Now, if the opponent crouches 1 you know where to shoot, and if he crouches a lot, he appears standing and you still know where to shoot.
---
People who choose to play fps games with controllers are willingly handicaping themselves and have nothing to wine about
---
Try Terrorist hunt! The people who play there are most of the time a lot more social and friendlier to each other!
---
Its not cheating, its just using better hardware
---
I know that. I‚Äôm talking about FPS games in general when i said that.
---
It is. No-brainer.
---
That kind of talk gets you downvoted around here. I made a similar comment previously and got downvoted because they don't like it pointed out when they are terribad.
---
What debate is there to have? You already know everyone on here is going to agree with you. It's been discussed to infinity on here. We all know it is cheating and Ubi have said the same so what new insights are you looking for? The people who use M&amp;KB on console are certainly not gonna admit as such on here as they will know the communities stance. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So you admit its a low effort post and call me a bleach filled trapezoid. Okay mate. Carry on.
---
I have to buy a controller to play on PC too, what is your point?
---
See, now you‚Äôre just stupid, on console, the point is to use a controller, using an M&amp;K gives you a godlike advantage, and is basically taking a Ferrari to a foot race
---
Guess that makes me a hypocrite then. Fantastic
---
So when you go into a foot race and you're using your preferred enhancement "supplements" where clearly the event does not allow uses to, is that cheating? Yes or no.
---
Ive been doing this on my trolling account for a bit now, so much fun lol
---
I don't fool myself. How do you know people are using the mouse and keyboard in a proper way? The XIM adapter being connected doesn't mean the player is using it at the moment.
---
You can't just look for the button presses / mouse behaviour. What if the player is playing with a controller but suddenly his cat walks over the connected keyboard? You don't want to ban these users do you?
---
Anti-cheats should be working 100% and shouldn't have false positives.
---
If your playing against someone with a mouse and keyboard I. A fighting game, it's an unfair advantage not gained through skill. Same reason people with blades can't compete in the Olympics.
---
Its cheating because the elite controllers are supported and license by microsoft while you need an adapter to trick the game to think that your using a controller instead of a m&amp;k
---
Found the cheater
---
But it‚Äôs still valid enough to talk about because viewpoints change over time, so I really don‚Äôt see your point on why this post doesn‚Äôt deserve recognition
---
Hello xxX42027Xxx, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bmhp4d/anyone_know_what_this_is_i_have_no_lag_issues_and/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
If that's what you get out of this, then you're really bad at comprehending things.
---
So you are saying in terms of PC it would be cheating when I use a controller in a fighting game? After all KB+M is the normal input device here.
---
This discussion is about a group of people trying to force their preferences on others and getting upset when different people have different preferences. If you want to use an ill suited device, then be my guest. But why on earth get angry at others who simply put one and one together and use a device which is better suited?
---
And no. Not every PC player is able to reach 144FPS. Some play with 30. Isn't that unfair too? Or the controller example I mentioned. At this point you are just arguing about acceptance here. And people not accepting something doesn't make it cheating.
---
You cant be more friendly to yourself.
---
MNK on console is cheating - case closed the whole world knows it. 
---
Sure you could bitch and moan about the abuse all you want, but until the problem is addressed all we can do is just play the game in its current state.
---
A majority of the MNK players I‚Äôve faced are your typical ASH mains - all aim no brain type of players. Why they don‚Äôt just play COD at that point is beyond me. 
---
My advice to anyone who‚Äôs interested in placing high plat/diamond is to invest more time in strategy then aim. Sure MNK users will always have the advantage of aim however with solid teamwork and strategy, you will be able to force the enemy to the beat of your own drum.
---
 
---
Don‚Äôt peak, don‚Äôt over extend, pick operators that compliment each other, play the objective.
---
Jager Buff: Now He Can Say The N-Word
---
So when a PC user is using a controller in a fighting game... it's cheating too?
---
It seems to me like people here just want to push down their personal choice to use a controller onto othersm despite alternatives existing.
---
Hold on, let's adress a couple things here.
---
First: Ubisoft has openly admitted that using mouse and keyboard on console is cheating. This has come straight from the developers themselves, this isn't just my opinion.
---
Second: It is not dickish to want to forbid someone from wanting to use an input device that provides them with a blatant advantage. Especially whenever the performance difference between players who use mouse and keyboard and console is literally night and day. This has been proven multiple times.
---
Third: Think of it like this, it's against the rules in many sports for their participants to use steroids. So most athletes will instead use other forms of training to improve their performance. Your argument is basically, let them use steroids, not allowing a player to choose which way they improve their performance is dickish. Do you realize how dumb that sounds now?
---
blokker\*
---
The people who do it act like it's perfectly fine
---
Using a different input device is a completely different story from actually changing a games code so you play by other rules.
---
We need someone with the glaz flare to say that
---
I did not mean Lone Wolf, I meant squads
---
I‚Äôm calling them Kyle from now on....thank you.
---
Some of the oldest stuff in the game
---
On PC it supports both, now what?
---
Because the game doesn't directly let you plug in a mouse and keyboard in order to do so. Ubisoft has acknowledged MnK and has stated it is cheating. The fact that you need a $100+ adapter to actually use that set up should be a pretty good indication that what you're doing was not how the game was meant to be played. Other games on consoles allow for MnK via directly plugging it in, Siege doesn't.
---
oof monty mains scare me
---
If you have to use bypasses to be able to use the devices then I'd say you're playing beyond what was intended for both the game *and* the console.
---
Using controller on PC is cheating.
---
Thank you for your reply! I didn‚Äôt know knolling-style, so I‚Äôll share my photo MUTE and THATCHER costume(it difference only mask)!
---
But the MnK adapter is supported by Sony, no?
---
You're going hard on the being wrong train here.
---
A console was designed to be played with a controller because is comfortable and practical for your livingroom. And back in the day games for consoles were designed to be easy to control with the controller. FPS games were born on and designed for pc by the doom team and naturally that means it is easyer to be played with m&amp;k. Imagine if someone was upset at the fact that other players have an advantage over him in a game like dark souls because his m&amp;k controlls suck since the game wasnt intended to be played on pc.
---
I was the one that made this but I'll let you off since it was on an old account that I deleted haha. Tbh I don't support it anymore since the 'Bad' maps won't get played
---
Yeah this is an intentional teamkill. Id go and yes on that^/s
---
OMG /// ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
---
True fortress is a really difficult map to learn the layout of, but that all comes with playing the map more tbh. And yea theme park can be a pain on both attacking and defending, I used to hate it when I first started playing siege but enjoy it now after playing so much.
---
Doubt
---
Little to no vertical play
---
Upgrade to Elite Skin man 1620 r6 credits if u own season pass.
---
The poor guy had to pick an operator, think how he would play while waiting for the match to finally load. He drove his drone, eager to find you and pick the best spawn point to attack...and that's where he was wrong!
---
That doesn't make any sense, you're implying I have a PC that can reliably run Siege and intentionally play on console.
---
I refuse to touch this game without friends, not fun at all.

Yes my friend. Avon are in my opinion one of the prettieset masks. Like the fm12 and m50 hotdamnüò§

Ever tried playing a fighting game with a keaboard? A controller DOES in fact provide an insane advantage here.

From my experience, Border is far worse for run outs. Though i don't have a problem with this. Unpopular opinion but run outs/spawn peeks are a valid high risk/reward strategy.

An I know how to translate German since I speak the language

i understand the frustration mate , dont doubt that , but what im saying is that the ultimate culprit in this its once again UBISOFT and not the players who can afford better hardware , UBISOFT has been whistling to the AIR during the whole duration of the problem , they are the ones telling console peeps to go F themselves.
---
now its only natural to play FPS with M/K and it will evolve that way , PS 5 will probably have those out of the box as a natural thing to sell , its up to game developers to balance their games to acomodate it.

possibly downed by enemy and then crawled off a high edge

tower was one of my favourite maps. very little spawn killing. really fun as a roamer too. How we lost tower in ranked and gained the new hereford i will never know

We'd end up playing the same few maps over and over. Broken system. Didn't work back in the day and wouldn't work now.

I upvoted the OP mainly because you were being an arse about it, have a nice day.

mate i understand the frustration , the day i started seeing controllers being used on pc i didnt like it too , but that was many many years ago , since then it became a normal thing and i adapted,  the same is happening to consoles now , stop crying about the players who have M/K and start asking UBI for solutions.

You can, go to settings and find match making preferences and select the maps you want.

---
I really want to see what happened from the other player's perspective. That looked quick as hell.
---
Cause the iron sights on bandit are good, all pros use them
---
Just for ranked though of course. Cause otherwise wed never see tower again and I kinda like tower
---
I'm trying to buy an Attacker, then Defender. I just bought Lesion so I'm looking for an attacker. Although the next season operator gadgets look boring, I cant really tell until I know their loadout LOL

For fucks sake is your sensitivity on 11? I get you're on console but so am I and I got that shit on like 90.

This happened on every team I faced in ranked last night. Amazing.

My vertical aim is bad so thats probably why i like it
---
Jump scare 100
---
Does the hardware magically emulate controllers by itself? Or does it use a third party software for that?
---
No haha I was just mostly just screwing around but also kinda giving the SE window an ocular patdown because I was sure someone would jump out there.
---
And weirdly enough Ubisoft has yet to ban a single player using KB+M. SOcial Media teams says what users want to hear, nothing more.
---
Ahhh, fair enough then
---
Good job
---
Fuck me that scared me.
---
It would suck for all players who liked unpopular maps though. I actually like Favela, and there‚Äôs gotta be someone out there who actually likes tower. The wide diversity of maps also requires you to know how to play different styles and operators, so having map select could take that part of the game out.
---
What's the name of this website?

Nope, I throw itbut they move, then I enter, was shooting Rook and Montagne got in the way and obviously I ended killing him ü§£

---
The only step that would stop the issue is disabling FF completely. That's all. If you allow it in some form it will be abused. I dont agree with removing FF but you're saying "muh step takenz gud" is completely bonkers because you're suggesting that even knowing its unsolvable, doing something to supposedly solve the unsolvable is a good thing rather than a pointless or irritating thing.
---
Look, right now I can Echo blast teammates all day long and they cannot defend themselves by shooting me dead because of RFF.
---
What a good change. Those steps certainly were forwards and not backwards, on an issue which has no resolution without actual FF disabling.

---
Is there such a problem with giving stacks better control over the map? It's still basically random and if you care about the map you're playing you should also be stacking up with 4 others. I'm saying this assuming it would be a limited choice of like 3 maps once the players have been found. This is the perfect way to find out what maps different ranks of players like playing, and which ones they don't like playing.
---
Would be nice to see some statistics for that. However it‚Äôs a hard thing to police, plus in game reporting is a joke so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But as I said mere assumptions from both of us as neither of us work for Ubisoft and arguing on the internet about something is something else. However I‚Äôd be inclined to hear your side of the story, as I am all for hearing the opposition rather than them trying to ridicule your side of the argument. Your argument should stand up to mine as to why you believe playing with a keyboard and mouse is fine on console, and how it does give people an even playing field to each other as I argued in my first comment. 
---
Regardless I hope you still have fun and enjoy game, because that‚Äôs what we are here for.

This annoying bug exists for about 9 month, and development team gives 0 fucks about it, I've posted about 3 posts on steam support community, all they have to say * we're still investigating *
---
I got Thermite (okay) and Pulse (gross). Thermite I am already great with but Pulse, hell no I didn't even play him in his OP days.
---
Nice one mate! It's really helped watching YouTubers and taking things slower, I was a complete disaster running about trying to get kills üòÇ Now I'm definitely able to hold my own and have been getting way better even over the past few days!
---
Did you even watch the clip lmao. You saying this person could have killed them?
---
That‚Äôs it though. Good Mavs will see where their team is pushing from, and attach from behind then when they have someone watching behind, he will attack the side or with his team. A lot of versatility, which is good, but almost zero drawback if you‚Äôre good at staying undetected, which isn‚Äôt hard.
---
Plat doesn‚Äôt mean as much when smurfing is so easy.
---
It takes a brave man to share a clip like that
---
Thats the exact feedback he was talking about
---
I dont like this
---
This has definitely helped me get more into the game, I'm finding now that I'm able to increase my sensitivity a little after every few matches to get used to it and now I've found a comfortable medium between reaction time and also making sure I hit those shots!
---
It will also be activated if you down a teammate. Attempting to kill your downed teammate will kill you instead. Bans are less common now, but still possible if someone finds a loophole.
---
Yeah, looks too jerky. On MnK if you 180 it's usually one clean motion unless your sens is too low.
---
Is a alternative dimension!
---
[Had a similar encounter some time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8mkr70/better_than_horror_games/)
---
Except it literally takes half a second for someone to check a wall for burn holes which you can do even in the middle of a gun fight not to mention when nothimg else is going on
---
It‚Äôs functional. this gas mask name is FM12, it‚Äôs successor to the S10 respirator.

FOOKIN LAZER SIGHTS
---
Just throw out your drones in high traffic areas and play him like you would a Rook or Doc. Unless you have a good team you communicate with it‚Äôs actually very difficult to capitalize on a concussion blast since he‚Äôs a 1 speed.
---
Thanks man. Ill look out for it. Add it to my collection
---
Yeah I can't remember the last time I used mine either, honestly I'd happily buy a phone that didn't have a front camera at all but I suppose that's not realistic in today's society so I guess some kind of flip or pop up camera is the way to go, or a second screen on the back like I've seen on another phone.
---
Nice to see another Vigil main BTW. How are you liking that buff against Lion?
---
PCMR, right?
---
If there were 2 others alive before and you killed them, then yes
---
Happened to me 2 times in one fall and i died on impact
---
Half a second is a lot of time, and having a player stare at a reinforced wall the whole round is a bad use of resources. It‚Äôs not "check it once real quick then you‚Äôre good" because it takes half a second to make a hole and clap your cheeks.
---
Nope . Shared benefit
---
dear diary....
---
The PS Messenger app makes the process a million times easier
---
In some reasons like this I‚Äôm happy for it but it still enables toxic people to troll you
---
We would never see Old Hereford. Wait. What year is this?
---
I showed you my black mirror pls respond
---
Do you still get banned or kicked for killing your self trying to tk?
---
I bought the game myself, I‚Äôm gamesharing for the game add ons only so would I keep my stuff I purchased if the share ends?
---
VG is great for people who want to purposely drop down to super low ranks and ruin the game for people who are nowhere near as skilled as them. That's about it. He does too much advice giving for someone who gets all of his nice clips 3 ranks lower than he would naturally be.
---
Because he defected to the US.

I'm not "flexing" I was saying if I was poor I wouldn't have both consoles (and the higher end version of one), my point being that console players aren't "poor" gamers. Sometimes maybe, sure. But most if the time they're gamers who prefer consoles.  (Also someone with knowledge of PC building could easily build a high end PC gaming desktop for the price of an xbox x and ps4, just an fyi).
---
Those are poor comparisons. I'm a guy, but abortion could effect me. If I was old, education could still effect me. Indirect effects generally, but still something. Console people using MnK has 0 impact on you, a PC player. The most effect you could argue would be saying some MnK players may go from console to PC, but since you insist console players are too "poor" for PC that can't happen, and if they all suck it wouldn't effect you anyways.
---
it means there are more options on both sides
---
I find it tough to take casual seriously now that I've played a bit of ranked (about 100 games) I just started playing siege a few months ago and at first I thought I'd never play ranked because I felt like it would be too much pressure but the toxicity levels in casual is insane compared to my ranked experience. 
---
People get upset in ranked and they get a little rude but I've encountered FAR fewer people who just want to be toxic for the sake of it than I have in casual. 
---
For reference I am currently gold 4 and my highest rank was plat 3
---
I don't get it.
---
Then fix your game to prevent them from doing it. With all logical aspects, its not cheating. Its like being faster in a race. Keep in mind that you are playing a very fast response game on a controller, people usually dont like that very much.
---
I was coming here to support OP's idea, but you're actually completely right. That'd be very broken. Good thinking.
---
How do you do that
---
Whoever has that symbol has either team killed or injured a teammate which activated the RFF (Reverse Friendly Fire)
---
It looks like it could be the AR33
---
Okay so after hours of doing other things I popped back in and it just worked for some reason. I don‚Äôt know what was going on before, but thank you for the advice!
---
I didnt let your balls explode on me, but can we be friends?
---
Tried the tool. Seems like i get similar result no matter what i type in.
---
An attempt was made
---
I laughed quite alot at this
---
but you can bleed out when injured
---
Clips like these are great for r/R6ClipsandCreations
---
Damn so many
---
You lagged. Replay cameras are broken on shields.
---
some cunt already downvoted my post. file a bug report. its not gonna do much but that way its in their system.
---
yes, and it was talked about in pro league because I think one of them did it lol
---
I'd say work on those battlefield-reloads, but you seem to be doin just fine with them
---
the best is nig\*a1, but with the g.
---
We need more of this!
---
Aptly put.
---
Is that watercolor?
---
All they had to do was sit site as well 4 people that's so easy to hold
---
*Confused screaming*
---
it means the other team was having a damn shootout
---
Ah yes, I love how it calls out who the toxic people are. 
---
This is amazing
---
Very good deal for 8 pounds haha. But like the guy above said , go for ducky or varmilo or vortex if you go for pre built. Much better than Corsair/Razer. CM is pretty good too among the big brands.
---
whilst i was in silver with my mate who was plat at the time he hosted a game and i was in a 1v4 as cav vs plats and managed to win its one of my best memories on the game
---
I have this luck with the enemies.
---
FH, angled, acog.

---
Sorry, developers publicly clarified that the keyboard and mouse support on PS4 is not to be used for rainbow six. So no MnK play on console. :)
---
You could have cropped everything else out ya know. Took forever rfinding wtf ur talking about
---
Bahaha ILLEGAL! CALL YOUR REPRESENATIVES YALL
---
This is the quality work that is perfect for r/R6ClipsandCreations
---
Hey, at least Nadez.Train (weird that he wants to nade trains WHILE OP is attacked AT trains?!?) got one of the hardest achievements to get, so there is that!
---
Honestly I'd be down with that
---

Okay but plat *what*?

Plat 3, aka gold 0?

With how easy it is to get to Plat 3, this doesn‚Äôt surprise me.

Get knocked off, dbno, no one picks you up, bleed out, death by falling caused by nomad
---
I do this on Chalet garage. Pretty neat trick.
---
Hopefully there‚Äôs no redstone or IQ will be having a fun time.
---
Sorry
---
Feel like an American operator would have made more sense
---
I kept trying it on chalet too but kept missing by just enough apparently.
---
Perfect
---
I mean I feel tracing goes a bit further than inspiration but
---
Ubi plz nerf
---
Yeah you're right, bad word choice on my part haha
---
Those are my recommended ops as well, but the problem with that is I just dont like the thought if playing jager without an acog, I dont think I've picked him since then, same with bandit (which is how I learned how good his iron sights work) havent picked them but I let the game pick a lot. 
---
Turns out that on defense I do best by doing what is not recommended, aka ext barrel acog P90 on console with max length spawn peaks.
---
That made no sense
---
I try to place a sneaky drone somewhere so I can see where he is before doing it. Dont succeed as often as I'd like to, but when I do I become very happy very fast hahahah
---
Lmao I‚Äôm fucking dead
---
Obviously Scar let him fall off the ledge into a heard of wildebeests
---
Got kicked in a 1v1, scouted the room with a drone, had plennnty of time, and was even heading in, knew where the guy was.
---
Gone.
---
Solo play is almost better in Ranked. Just because idiots won't kick you if it means any better of a chance at winning.
---
U a PC player? The knife and lean button are the same on console. If you push aims ND lean at the same time it will knife instead dog aiming it leaning. Also thumbs have a faster reflex as well and are shorter so sometimes they hit before your fingers do. Causes you to knife instead.
---
I have that for every 2 rounds, not matches.... EVERY 2 DAMN ROUNDS. It doesn't matter if i spawn near or not.
---
Oh shit, I didnt know it was illegal! I hope the cops don't show up at my house. I got a career and a family to take care of. I wasn't aware that using a KBM could put all that in jeopardy. 
---
Oh, and please reference my fake internet points as a reason I should care again. I really enjoy that.
---
Neckshots counts as headshots in the score I believe, which might be the reason
---
Ooah
---
Than I wouldn‚Äôt call csgo‚Äôs matchmaking settings better.
---
I am almost certain it was a headshot, but I did clip the edge of the barricade. It was through an exterior window on tower. He was also in the next room so idk.
---
i have a blue snowball and it doesnt pick it up for some reason
---
Keep trying

[removed]
---
No leakes for now , we‚Äôre gonna know it in 1 week more or less
---
that all depends on how good the user is with MnK and his knowledge of the game. with that said its still a huge disadvantage the fact that you think you can beat an MnK player with a controller is just ridiculous
---
Get it just to flex on them casuals

Why does he look like a mix of Thatcher and Blackbeard?

Except the random ones that aren't. How come he cant bust through some ancient brick wall that's basically already falling apart.

But where does he store his D R U G S?

Why is there a button, now everyone can get in

You apparently don‚Äôt know about the siege pro league community
---
White is the absence of color...
---
yeah, rogue had a video on it.
---
iirc around 3 feet or something like that, similar idea with blitz and ying, but with different ranges.
---
LOL, that soi funny
---
For spawn peek denial that‚Äôs about it though I guess you could watch site if the defense was down in kitchen/kafe
---
Oink?
---
yeah it‚Äôs only been posted about 100 times already
---
If it‚Äôs not Tachanka is there ever a reason to play anymore?
---
This one's better -. .. -... -... .-

Exactly
---
Castle too op pls renerf
---
is that a Condor MOPC carrier?
---
Nah not tracing. The feet are in different positions, but yeah, VERY inspired
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Don't CS:GO's flashbangs just freeze the image onto the screen for a moment?
---
If the objective is in kitchen and you are glaz then this is really good, otherwise it may be a waste of time
---
White is not a color.
---
Pressing the button and getting through the door is hard
---
No, recruit is neither fun to play or beneficial. I‚Äôm fine if people want to play recruit themselves, just don‚Äôt kill me over some shitty meme.
---
The number of times I've self Fragged or Fragged a teammate because the hole fucked me over is why I stopped.
---
Wait are u serious?
---
Same here. We usually do a few matches past our placements, bump into a 5 stack of 150 pingers crouch spamming on console. Then play one casual, see the same thing, then uninstall and play something else. Must have uninstalled at least 10 times.
---
The button would universally open it. I think that's what they were getting at.
---
Same as me lol.
---
Holy shit if this is real then he looks so cool
---
I don't get the hate.  He's a counter terrorist agent who came from different upbringing.  He is ugly, but so is what he does.  The fact that most of the CTU agents look like fucking glamor models is the part that breaks continuity.
---
Is he a Damn skin head
---
Yup. Just saw this and was like "WTF!!!! It's finally here...."
---
It needs refinement. Like I‚Äôm in a skill gap of Plat 3 and Gold 1 and I loved this game. But I‚Äôm getting more pissed at Casual matches then I do at Ranked matches
---
1st reply to the 69th comment

MmmmMMMmm a creeper over there, there is

I just took the screenshot from the game itself dude. Not a fake. Real elite released in game.

Oh my god, i can't believe this is happening. The long awaited skin is finally here!!!!
---
so he turned into a German biker gang member? lol
---
Wasnt it stated in the patch thing destroying friendly gadgets was a bit of a no no?

I hear it in the old Beta noise even

It‚Äôs part of his backstory, I kinda like it
---
Also just thought the resolution/aspect ratio will be different too so not sure how it will fit on the S9 screen, hope it looks good though!
---
Yeah this replaced the photo of my cat haha but he gets enough love as it is.
---
r/banditelite would love to accept him.
---
your 6 isnt the games logo -1/10. But seriously, not too bad.
---
Sorry I think you mean doesn‚Äôt deserve. Cause obviously blitz needs a nerf
---
No
---
But first it was MY drone, so you shouldnt get damage for that AND it was captured by mozzie, and i testet it in the round after it, i could destroy j√§ger ADS and barbed wire and all that shit too.
---
Nope
---
People usually play to win not to ‚Äúdick around‚Äù
---
I just got siege and have been called a ‚Äúsmurf‚Äù so many times and I‚Äôm only level 15, I played lots on PS4 though and don‚Äôt have ranked unlocked yet. Just got my pc
---
Where can i do that test to find my fitting operator? I am new and i am still figuring out some stuff

I can get behind that

Just gotta hope shipping to uk isn't too hefty.

There is a lot of glitches in hostage , the enemy team that are with the hostage can kill the hostage and it would count as a loss to u its BS

They should. Your work is really good for information but the fact of the matter is, you tk innocent people.

I've I murder you because I want to study the human brain that doesn't make me a hero. If you tk people to get tkore I go on the new system that doesn't make u a hero. 
---
Legit the reason you're getting downvoted is because you're proud to to people which means you do it outside of testing the new system. To top it off with your argument about it being the same as hackers and such... You are ehurtig your ownnn team not the other team... So I'm sry man but just no.

The problem is this gets posted frequently enough to choke a horse.  Playing casual getting mad about randoms doing random things. Then you dont understand the simple day 1 memes. Then on top of that you think your feedback here is going to be taken seriously at all? Hell naw lmao.  Not to mention i personally guarantee that before this time 6:20 PM on may 16th, i will have seen at least 50 posts like this.  Now if people like could not clog up the sub with nonsense that gets posted 50 times a week we could get to more real issues. But nope keep posting this type of thing. Its exactly what this sub needs.

Hound is great, especially when combined with Pro leaguge uniform... I was disappointed to find out that he didnt have a full set (both heagear and Uniform, skin charm) but wont complain, works fine with the available uniforms.
---
No they made the game weak bro. Like before all these nerfs people actually had to pick ops strategically. You had to think and move. There's no way around it. Bad players wanted to get more kills and not have to strategize or play tactically. Those are the facts.  The good players had no problem getting around those ops. But people dont want to work at getting good. So yes i will discourage it till gamers actually have to be good at games again. Like theres negative and postives with each op and yall just want one or the other. Its pathetic.

i'm the same, Kapkan is my favourite one, always seems to get a few extra points and a kill or two with it.
---
This makes sense though.

Yeah, he should have 2-3 uses per drone. I don‚Äôt like him having 2 drones either, on console at least it‚Äôs a pain to hit while under it‚Äôs effects and it‚Äôs hoping around,
---
I'm not holding my breathe. I always make it to the final win but something stupid happens. But I end up carrying my friends up to plat since they get like 80 points a win, compared to my 30. But I do wish luck in your journey as well feller

Had same problem couple days ago and this is what ubi support said i should do and it worked:
---
- Go to Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In-Game tab.
---
- Make sure "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game" is ticked.
---
- Go to your Steam Library.
---
- Right click on the game and select Properties.
---
- In the General tab, make sure "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game" is ticked.
---
You may also need to clear your browser cache in Steam. To do this:
---
- Navigate to Steam &gt; Settings
---
- In the Settings Menu find "Web Browser"
---
- "Delete browser cache" &gt; OK
---
Hope it works for you.
---
I like the 4th one from the right, I wish ops looked more serious with their gear like this guy does
---
You‚Äôre gay if you wouldn‚Äôt
---
No, you take the damage from it hitting them
---
Awesome, about to try this, I just came accross a forum saying the same thing so I'll give it a shot
---
Its level restricted to 50, which is probably more than enough to teach you about siege.
---
I know most of the stuff and even know how to counter defenders, traps excetera. My weakness is just slow reflexes and aim (many situations like clutches and defuses fail just because I cant kill anyone). Spawn peeking is also a fairly known concept.
---
Followed by ‚Äúa‚Äù, then ‚Äúg‚Äù then ...ban
---
You still get the benefits of the joystick aim assist when you‚Äôre using the MaK on console using adaptors.
---
You can‚Äôt lean before you ads though...
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs about what to expect.

As if you‚Äôve made this some sort of racist segregation. Reason is no one really knows turkey has a military at all. That region is in turmoil right now
