That part of the map is so bugged. Even you can just teleport from there to inside of map

---
Characters don‚Äôt move while you are ADSed
---
Throw a team member in order to protect his deployable shield
---
Well done
---
Looks great, I love it!
---
Rook will pretty much always be useful but someone people find anchoring boring. I thoroughly enjoy him though and his gadget benefits everyone (as long as you remember to put it out)
---
Imagine not
---
While ADSed you don‚Äôt move

Alibi‚Äôs bandana does cover her face
---
Thanks mate I was just confused
---
Maybe reinstall?
---
truth
---
Mmmm....no.
---
so absolutely no counters? seems fair
---
Eating those alpha snaccs, I see what they did there
---
It does take place after siege, so technically yes
---
Your trial ubisoft account is linked to steam. Launch it through Uplay and you can log in to the other account.
---
When you say 'very likely' do you mean you're still questioning it? If so I hope you find your true self-identity soon! Awesome cosplay by the way :)
---
I just don‚Äôt see the point. Sure there are ops I‚Äôm better at then others but I just use whatever the team needs or whatever I‚Äôm feeling at that moment in time
---
Dont apologize dude, they reinforced kids room.
---
Plus, your name is JohnRambo90.... john Rambo doesnt apologize for shit
---
Pretty sure it is because you are running it through steam and do not have it purchased on there. If you run it through ubisoft game launcher then it would work I think. Or you know you could just buy the game.

Im makin fucking mac and cheese

You assume you can only 360 no scope with glaz

Dam bro can you frame that and send it to me.

---
Literary no one outside of this sub thinks outbreak was a failure.
---
Outbreak still has some of the highest player counts for this game and that only counting pc numbers. The event was good enough to green light the premium pack system and quarantine as a standalone game.
---
Quarantine is made by a different dev team so your comment about improving TH makes no sense.
---
i‚Äôm big confused?
---
Wow you stopped some drones at a mute jammer, low effort post OP
---
Stronger than Kars.
---
I had this happen to me on clubhouse it happened a while ago
---
Good at wearing a beret and saluting
---
I deleted it then went on the uplay app to reinstall. It just sent me back to steam telling me i have to for it even though i am using my friends Ubisoft account(he owns the game)
---
I wasn't trying to lol. I had just smoked so I'm a little nutty
---
No, he took one half of the off brand
---
Not true. Every R6 veteran buys a new account.
---
bout 80 most of the time, 100 in intense parts
---
You may change bloom also. You may adjust it until you see things clearer.
---
Awhile ago, this happened on Kafe, I was defending, a teammate tked me, I had asked, and was fine on the following round.
---
I knew you would say that buddy. It's why I worded my comment the way I did. How does it feel to know that you've been out maneuvered, to be a puppet on a string? I have you now, and always will.
---
Spetsnaz operators are the best memes lol
---
Mmmmmm tasty
---
p much
---
So much of new ends up being people bitching about a toxic enemy team or teammate and whining about their mmr being wrong and hitreg and so much other garbage.
---
Honestly, I don't *mind* console clips, as long as it's not a shitty clip. But 99% of them (even the PC ones) end up being "Hey I'm playing fuze and fucked up my aim and ACED AND KILLED THE HOSTAGE AND A TEAMMATE HAHA
---
It's just disheartening. I wish there was like /r/SiegePC or something. /r/SiegeAcademy is decent but all the questions are stuff new players just dont wanna google like "what mmr is gold" and "what sight do you use"
---
Are you using his steam or yours? Maybe if you logged into the account associated with the uplay
---
Lol maybe there all vodka

Faster activation of Glance, Glance meter no longer has to be full to activate, replace MPX with P90, remove impacts to accommodate for new acog to make it an actual choice, see-through smoke while moving

Depends on your playstyles

One reason is money.

The other reason is that these are ugly as fuck and didn't sell well so now they're trying to break even on these pieces of shit.

Am I the only one that wouldn't join to an enemy team invite?

I wouldn‚Äôt either lol, but some people might be fooled if they wanna boast or something and join the party to be toxic but then they get ddosed
---
the point of a [game](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/game) is to have fun, not to neccessarily win.

if you aren't having fun it's no longer a game, it becomes a self-inflicted cause of misery.

/s
---
The Yokai have her!
---
Or Yokai
---
Ting is useless right now because of hot breaching being disabled, but she‚Äôs good in the long term. I only use Ela for shotgun kills because the EVO is by far the best shotgun in siege. Ying will probably let be more useful in the long term.
---
Next round the entire enemy team is cav

Eh, go ahead and reinforce it. Maps only gonna be around for 5 more days anyway.

I swear I saw someone say that now it says it‚Äôs deleted üòÇ

Does he have his LMG mounted and loaded?
---
Nah
---
yep
---
*laugh in American server*
---
Well since youre new the game, I highly recommend Mozzie on the defender side, he is able to take control of enemy drones, has a carbine rifle as his main and a shotgun as his secondary (great for punching through a wall) hes a 2 speed 2 armor, and is rarely banned in ranked.
---
If u dont play ranked however, Jackal is a ton of fun. Operators you probably shouldnt buy for now are Jackal, Echo, Lesion and Mira, those operators get banned all the time in ranked.
---
Echo is filed under "auto-ban"
---
Stop asking the same fucking question
---
Haha you're right, I'm just so use to everyone on this reddit and in the game going on about their aces.
---
You're forgetting the closet soft wall
---
Unless your friend bought the game through uPlay, the Steam version has an authenticator in it. You would need to log into the Steam account that owns it along with the uPlay account.

Bro anyone that plays thermite over ash for hard breaching is retarded, just kill the enemy team and you win amirite???
---
Thank you, I love support from friends and strangers alike.
---
Playstyle and team coordination. These becomes increasingly common as you go up ranks, I have games where I go 15-1 and then the next I literally can't do anything and die every round.
---
If your opponents have a play style that counters yours, and/or have insane teamwork that far outstrips your own team- you're going to have a bad time.
---
You might not be able to do ranked, but you will still be able to do casual.
---
Teammates can clip through shields, for both teams. This is to prevent people from getting stuck on eachother
---
This prob wrong but nomad her guns may be shit but the gadget is useful as shit
---
They just play a lot
---
Definitely like a gold 2-3 those players were so unaware it‚Äôs crazy
---
I'm like your brother.
---
I would recommend sledge, ash and for Defence J√§ger and kapkan. They all have good guns with almost no recoil. And maybe also Lesion
---
I guess treasure in Europe must not be very valuable
---
Unfortunately it is not my fault if your country can not afford to have a server and I believe you have to respect the people of which the server is. The other factor is that in our country a lot of children play early so not how to take care of what they are going to do or talk about, it's going to mature you too.
---
Ela in her current state is one of the worst operators in game. her scorpion is the only primary without a recoil diamond as well as bad damage. Her pistol is a niche and very weak due to its poor range and damage. Her secondary gadgets are quite useless as she's a roamer given two stationary gadgets. And her mines are lackluster in certain situations.
---
Ying has good guns both of them. A decent secondary, useful secondary gadgets, and well a very affective gadget in every situation.
---
I sorry this went to far
---
Did anyone else get Tachanka as one of their first ops because he sounded really cool?
---
Replace his secondary with his shield, so when he's on AK-12, the shield will be protecting his back, and make him deploy cluster charge with his shield in the front :P
---
And all I had to do was switch to WEU servers and I‚Äôm already in gold III after 25 or so matches.  
---
When I started this season, I was ignorant to throwers and lost so much MMR that I went sub copper.  Add solo queuing to that mix and not being such a great player at the start of the season.  
---
Point here is that MMR is flawed.  I‚Äôm climbing MMR and will prob be platinum on the WEU servers but will be stuck at bronze on the EUS servers.   Yes I played a lot more on EUS but I know I‚Äôm better than bronze.
---
You can play unranked
---
GOD DAMNIT I KNEW SOMEONE WAS GONNA SAY THIS
---
They should be instantly shot down via firing squad
---
You're right about Lesion and Doc, but the rest is wrong.
---
I always do the walls on the steps since you can't get in that way anyway. Still get team killed for it
---
Anyone it doesnt apply to is a loser and is therefore irrelevant. Cry more about people "trying hard" when its effortless to beat you.
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
How? I‚Äôm so confused
---
Fix his scope sens (it's 5% lower than every other ACOG, fuck off ubisoft).
---
Undo his recent nerfs, and I would have his gun gain damage at distance.
---
At under 5m it could do say 51, at 10m it does 69, at 15 it does 75, and so on.
---
Idk those are just random numbers.
---
If you reinforce northern and eastern wall, you effectively reduce the number of entry points accessible by the defenders to 2:
---
1-Doorway north.
---
2- east window leading to that small 1st floor rooftop space and master bedroom window. 
---
At that point all the attackers have to do is rush in and overwhelm  the obj. Inevitably, defenders will be roaming and will be picked off one by one by a sniper (probably in treehouse) or the attackers in obj. I've seen it time and time again from both sides. I'm a little high right now...

Did you cop?

We're in the second atm and will soon be in the third, I'd say it's still worth getting the season pass rather then buying ops straight out or buying skins

Btw i should say that is prob a teenie messaging u lol, he has no imagination with his insults.
---
Why go to the trouble of making a post?
---
Hey man, I saw the sub, thanks a lot for the feedback! :)
---
To be honest, this was just a bit of a tester in a lot of ways. I wanted a go at editing my own clips and making them look half decent, and in a way I'd like to say i've done that lol. This wasn't meant to be a sort of 'montage' but rather a "heres some plays I made on my twitch stream today", where the difference is i'm not 100% sure, but I know what I mean lol. It was my first time ever editing like this, so was definitely just a learning experience for me.
---
Thanks for checking my channel out :)
---
cant win fights because fair 1 shot mechanics got you down? just aim at the legs and watch as they struggle to hit a shot rightfully theirs!

Zofia if you're out for the rush boi life, finka for a fast support op/decent rush op, and gridlock for hard tactical plays

It's online, if you want to read it.  Fuze fuzes her womb.

Dude was teleporting all over the place, he would destroy our stuff even when he wasn't Twitch, hell he knifed me through the fuckin wall.

Wait, I cant even buy the season pass with the coins? I'm on xbox

You looked in the shop

Legendaries aren‚Äôt in the shop

I posted this earlier but reading your post now definitely made me think cav cosplay is perfect .
---
Are u familiar with the cav meme?
---
There is no way you can be bronze in one server and plat in another with same conditions. 
---
Just. No. 
---
Solo queue is hard, yes, but if you are a plat player you won‚Äôt go down all the way down to bronze. I‚Äôm just gonna guess you‚Äôre exaggerating to make a point.
---
I‚Äôm embarrassed to say it, but I think I recognize the chick in the center magazine.
---
Dude!! 
---
1- i kinda wanna hear that story now!
---
2- I had an eye patch for about a month because of an eye problem and played Capitao non-stop during that month simply because of the eye patch lol.

Smoke elite is pretty interesting like he had to come to work during a Jog

Sorry, gonna need video evidence for that... Also, you're trying to start a witch hunt... Not cool.

Dude

I just soft wall my window and use the hard wall to the right or left for cover.
---
wat
---
Well, yes, but actually no.
---
What, do you think they‚Äôre hacking on console? What about this is ‚Äúsus?‚Äù
---
No. I think Ubisoft broke the game to be honest.
---
What i like to do is run straight at the enemy and predict when they start to shoot at my legs. I then crouch, flash, and sprint to the side, boom easy.
---
?
---
Sorry, I should‚Äôve just assumed you hadn‚Äôt.

Don‚Äôt give it up

Hmmmm i Will try

‚ÄúSo then they were all like: recruit your too powerful, you have a whole fucking artillery bunker at your disposal, so they kicked me off the damn team! So ya know what I did? I started selling PORN!‚Äù
---
You might not be OP but you‚Äôre still the one saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúsus‚Äù
---
What‚Äôs the issue?

Had the exact same today they either crash the server so no one wins or ddos for a 3-0 headstart on defense

Someone claim their 12 year old

OwO

Dude I felt pretty good about it ok don‚Äôt ruin it please

Still mad?

Probably gonna be waiting until 68% now

Ok now thats fair
---
*clap* it‚Äôs so beautiful, you may be a weeb but you have damn good knowledge *clap*
---
Shush
---
The issue is, in the clip I can't see OP's head at all. As a matter of fact, it looks like a wallbang to me. I have no idea where you see his head. Either way, you have your opinion and I have mine. Leave it at that.
---
Well the arrow isn‚Äôt in the bar, so I don‚Äôt know why you would.
---
One day my friend, one day
---
You can‚Äôt see them because killcams are busted

Smoke goggle glasses things
---
Just got two 2% in a row. Thanks for the RNG.
---
Lmao im sorry you have to deal with this
---
I swear I find the weirdest names on here
---
What i forgot to add is, try to run not straight, but slightly to the side, then change direction after flash. This way they have a harder time reading your actions
---
Use your drone you can usually see them setting it up at the end of the timer
---
As a Fuze main I cannot approve of this 
---
But it is pretty good tho
---
I agree, everyone is just salty they got killed early
---
Not at all and it's a shitpost

Looks like someone's about to get a whole lot of elite skins

The chance to do so is not greatüçÄ

As somebody new to rainbow, can anybody explain this to me
---
Play often as buck and use both of his guns. DMR has setup for long ragne (acog, muzzle brake and so on), and rifle come up with red dot and flashhider. For example when i play coasline i oftenly open up floor behind the bed from below and use rifle with red dot. In the other hand DMR become handly on the long distances. There is not so much long distances in the game, though.
---
It's not a in game exploit. People are using 3rd part bot services to stress the servers that's running their game
---
It has the ‚Äúuseful‚Äù tag

When your rush fails for the 1000000th time so you decide to make a career change

That‚Äôs what ‚Äúsubs I thought I fell for‚Äù is for

I know that I was just saying what if you were dokabei and there was a smonk with a shotgun at close range also I didn‚Äôt know the guy was right behind the blitz so I couldn‚Äôt heal myself beforehand how about use your last 2 brain cells to get this

It's 2 off the top rank, so yes it's a high rank. That other sentence means nothing.

ah yes. thanks

didnt think about this thanks

"well actually still bang so.. oh wait no she's deaf too shut up"

*confused and scared screaming*
---
If you are Gold III you should still be able to play with your friends that even are in Plat II
---
This might be something that does not affect you but I just wanted to emphasize that they do not only add a Champion rank in Ember Rise
---
They will remove Gold IV (2500 MMR), make Gold III 2600MMR+ (instead of 2700MMR+) and make Plat III 3200MMR+ instead of 3300
---
They also add Copper, Bronze, Silver V, but I am not sure what the requirements for those are
---
This also means that the average Siege Ranked player is from now on not anymore Gold but Silver
---
*I'll take your entire stock*
---
I think the labeling is deserved, considered it‚Äôs quite a low skill based tactic, I think the reason people think it‚Äôs toxic is because it‚Äôs damn near a form of gambling, High risk for high reward and it usually is a moronic tactic considering you are suppose to be defending your objectives instead of playing pop goes the weasel
---
Your router has literally 0 connection to your framerate or GPU settings. 
---
One possibility is there has been a driver update to your GPU/Graphics card that coincidently occured at the same time as replacing the router. 
---
Check driver settings and if there has been an update perhaps try back dating it and see if that helps.
---
It won't replace siege if you're asking about that.
---
Looks great dude
---
I play PC so I have no dog in this fight. That said I've played on a controller to see what it's like, but idk if getting rid of the fire mode option is the correct play. even in your demonstration for single fire, you fire 2 rounds instead of 1.
---
Is ash slow now?
---
Siege, and Warframe over on the left? Top tier 2-for-1 deal.
---
Ah ok thank you
---
It happens way too much when in higher ranks on Xbox (plat 2 to diamond) they often tk a guy that guy then invites you to a party (pretending he‚Äôs gonna throw) and when u join they kick u offline. It is really bad however that you lose mmr for leaving

Yeah, I miss the old feature where you would stay with the squad until you decide to re-que. People are searching for another team because it's quicker to find new game this way. I miss the fun I had with some randoms playing 2 hours straight and having fun.  Now basicly every game is a new team.

It depends on your playstyle. If you plan on holding tight angles and ADSing, the laser isn't going to help you as you won't really be hipfiring anyway. If you plan on trying to go for quick flanks and are needing to cover ground quickly, the laser may be more beneficial. Just be conscientious of it by trying to keep it out of sight (looking at the doorframe, not through the door) and you can play around most the drawbacks of it.

I had someone threaten to take down my internet if I didn‚Äôt forfeit a rocket league game once, I called his bluff, he said he took away my ability to gain mmr (he didn‚Äôt), but the threat may not be empty next time so I don‚Äôt trust anyone.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs stupid that people aren‚Äôt good enough they have to kick people
---
It really is, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm happy with staying around plat 3 on my multiple accounts because I don‚Äôt have to deal with ddosers or mouse and keyboard players.
---
Ranking Gold still eludes me since last time I played ranked 3 people just took turns team killing me and let the other team win. Not doing that shit again.

Pretty sure I've seen pros using it.  Don't see why you need pros to use it anyway. You don't use it but I don't see you in pro leagues.
---
That‚Äôs what I did when I first got the game 2 years ago. Sorry casual teammates.
---
that would be a very short essay
---
I second this
---
I bought it from Grey-shop but in hindsight i would have bought it from fsbshop for $150
---
Yeah but how would I test something like that?
---
Just because you got some assholes in your lobby doesn‚Äôt mean everyone‚Äôs like that chief
---
Yes you will keep the year 4 operators even if Year 5 began
---
Save up to 500k renown and open 100 packs
---
I think Siege's gameplay is simply too arcadey to have truly satisfying weapons to use, but that's okay as it's meant to be competitive over prioritising good gunplay.  
---
556xi, AR33, PARA, M762, M590A1, SG-CQB &amp; TCSG all come to mind as decent in this respect, but everything else is varying levels of blech.  M1014 stands out as probably the worst in the entire game.
---
Cool
---
*It was time for Thomas to leave, he had seen everything.*
---
Cracked up at the frag destroying a gu mine, idk why
---
How?
---
People say the 10th but it wouldn't make a lot of sense. It would make more sense for an 8th or 9th release since they tend to drop new ops on Tuesday and sometimes Wednesday. They always try for the 2nd Tuesday of the month for an op drop. Thursday or a Friday release is very rare. Operation Phantom Sight dropped on June 11th which was on a Tuesday. Like 90% of ops release dates have been on a Tuesday.
---
And didn't it remind anyone of Keanu Reeves from E3
---
Ok dafuq's wrong with her
---
Shows the PMM but has the gsh18 selected instead.
---
Hmmmmm
---
I tried making a bandit one, but mine didn‚Äôt turn out as well as urs
---
Aight but fucking everyone says that. Play ranked, can't play ranked yet? Download GamerLink on your phone, make a post looking for a R6S teammate so you can't be voted out and if you're tk'd you can be avenged. Don't wanna download shit? Look for the subreddit specifically for finding team mates in siege. There's many options to fix your problem but instead you choose to bitch
---
How
---
*FoOkInG lAsEr SiGhTs*
---
No man should have this much power
---
They should throw the old Hereford in there too
---
Yeah, no that doesn't work. That generally is a guess as it's not confirmed. If you Google it you get like the 9th which wouldn't make sense. They always try and go for the 2nd Tuesday of the month for a new op release. The 9th is a Wednesday which could be possible but wouldn't be correct with them going more for Tuesday launches.
---
NO WHY THE SHIELD WAS GREAT WHYWHEYEHWYWHWHEBFBEHSJSOENEJS
---
Thanks. Is this the only available?
---
You are exactly what is wrong with the siege community mate
---
I love how i get downvoted for playing with a fuction of the game, tell me what would you in plat 2 on pc :D
---
side note : only equip laser to guns that has good hipfire spread, such as &gt; R4-C, MP7, F2, etc, go figure.
---
The brass commands are leaving the potato servers
---
are you sure ads is faster with laser? i don't see any difference when I equip it.
---
It‚Äôs all messing around with my friends. Never have I been annoyed or seen anyone been annoyed when the enemy tk‚Äôs in casual. Fuck off.
---
A drone, similar to twitch, but has a cluster charge attached... Harvard you can send me your acceptance letters any time!!!
---
*zomboss starts cackling
---
What happened to aiming just on the wall to hide your laser sight. Do people not do that anymore?
---
same can be said for you.
---
That‚Äôs easy to do, hard to get out of
---
The only reason I really see on using a lazer sight is a shotgun and maybe very tight spread guns like forest's SMG or the p90 when you can run around and hip fire
---
hmmm, looks like someone is shooting in my general direction, let me just jump in front of the bullets so they can get an easy kill (big brain bait btw)
---
No. Maybe it is in the ember rise patch notes and i haven't seen it yet. We gotta wait til tuesday and test out.
---
And funnily enough, germans make the biggest background with around 25%
---
BIG BRAIN
---
I still have Rainbow Six Vegas in that thicc ass VHS box
---
I can see why you would wide peek a corner without ads, its to have a larger pov during said push right? sometimes not ads-ing while peeking a corner gives you more advantage than ads (since it limits your pov)
---
Same
---
love to see it
---
Probably scuf
---
It‚Äôs ok mate, one day you‚Äôll grow up and understand.
---
not that hard
---
That's a nice headgear
---
Hey quick question how do I get that ash main title you have?
---
I‚Äôve always played with a laser and I have not once gotten killed because of it. I have however killed a few people holding ridiculously dumb angles and killed them because of the laser. It doesn‚Äôt really limit your play. You just can‚Äôt be an idiot like the frost in the video. There‚Äôs no reason you should ever be holding that angle. 
---
(Hit diamond for my 5th time this season.)
---
No

Ok

No problem
---
No idea, but the funny thing is my team has never died from that spawnpeak once, but the times that i do it, i usually get 3-4 kills
---
Should I make a bandit one
---
Thx
---
You do love to see it mate
---
Great
---
Legit dude. Glad I'm not the only one who saw him lmao
---
I go alibi bring a clash and done

If ya want 2, I can send u my failed 1 2 compare

Nah your good u can send a picture though

M friend sent me the direct pic no link and I actually looked for the link.

I always down through the school area, it‚Äôs far easier to counter

Real question is , why does Dokk have a ring in the middle of her thumb joint?

Im on console so i only faced one hacker. In the year i have been playing

---
Few weeks ago solo que casual. Got grouped with the classic sweaty ass 4 stack of diamonds. Immediately started calling me garbage, trash, to quit the game and kms. They did horrible that game. I Carried them to victory and got 12-1. At the end of the match I turned mic on and said ‚Äúnext time you keep calling someone garbage and other shit make sure you don‚Äôt get carried‚Äù 
---
Tbh idk how they were diamonds,their recoil control and aim was horrible (PS4)
---
What's special about this skin? Sorry I'm a noob
---
It's an incorrect opinion. Aiming is harder.  Mnk on console is easy diamond.
---
Both are good choices . Maestro is a fun op I use him without the shield tbh and I'm sure he'll synergize org Goyo
---
Even the cosmetics?
---
?? Are you joking?
---
Console is pretty toxic, at least in casuals. I haven‚Äôt had too many problems though. There‚Äôs plenty of players also
---
probably carried or just had a bad game lol, im on ps4 if you wanna play some time
---
lol
---
K
---
Ok whatever
---
Well I had the same problem the only difference is I was impatient
---
yeah but theres a way to make it so you can turn it off and on by holding the ps button and selecting the option. when i played on ps4 i used r1 and l1 for shoot and aim as those were the buttons for ps3 and 2
---
Siege is a more CPU intensive game than most. I went from a 6700K to a 9900K and saw CPU usage drop from around 75% to 45%. If you want the best I would say 9900K or Ryzen 3900X, both will be strong for many years.
---
Yepp as it‚Äôs part of the ‚Äúbundle‚Äù of buying the pass
---
I don‚Äôt remember how to do that trick but I did it on accident before.
---
I see then I think I'm gonna like it considering that I play FUCKIN A LOT of siege
---
Hello TheGreateGambler, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/czzvw3/3/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Why would you turn around??
---
About once every season. Lol
---
Imagine playing one of the best shooter in the latest years
---
Its bandit trapped
---
For real though, does the game calculating where the light goes really that game breaking? Literally almost every other game with lights has that feature and it doesn't kill computers now does it?
---
I dont even use lasers on shields because most of the time, the laser doesnt even work. I've even tested it and at point blank even, the bullet doesnt hit where the laser is pointing.
---
I find the game really enjoyable, but on PS4 there is a lot of mouse and keyboarders and ddosing.
---
Overall I think the meta is pretty good right now, especially that pick and ban is in ranked. There isn't really any OP operators.
---
In recent seasons there has been some game breaking glitches too, but usually ubisoft implements some sort of patch pretty quick.
---
Overall the game is enjoyable if your willing to look past some of the frustrating things I just mentioned.
---
If there is no claymore or anything like that then maybe you might be alright
---
Laugh in thatcher main
---
Ok thnx

Oh god they so bad...

Eh?

crossover btw Harry Potter and R6
---
That was the r6 free week, you could download the game on psn and play for free.... even without ps+. Now that promo is over you need ps+ to play
---
I‚Äôm 100% sure these guys were just messing around like me and my friends, but we got in a queue with 3 diamonds and 2 plat 1‚Äôs. We only played shield recruit on offense and we won the match. It was a great time
---
Which games? Dynamic lighting is hard and is part of the reason that RTX is a big feature
---
Exactly, my point is not every operator needs a counter. Maverick, IQ, and others don‚Äôt need a counter because they can be dealt with without one.
---
That‚Äôs because of the free weekend, free weekends you do not need a sub
---
Watch out,Kikep0912 is scamner. PSID is Manny_0317
---
you can't get new skins in these packs
---
Buy a scuff\^\^
---
Rook does have a higher pick rate than you might expect. The plates provide another layer of armour for whoever picks them up. Basically turning a 1 armour operator into a 2 armour operator, or a 3 to a 4 etc. This can mean the difference in a gunfight, as the armour usually increases the number of bullets needed to kill you.
---
I would recommend watching [this video, by Gregor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOzshW-l05Q) or [this video by Rouge 9,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxPu85eWpc4&amp;t=2s) for more information on this.
---
Same lol
---
Definitely has some similiar feats as Octane
---
You should play the objective instead of relying on clutching or losing
---
This is phenomenal (to the person who actually made it)
---
And that is why you don‚Äôt play on WiFi
---
*Fus* *Ro* *Dah* ?
---
No it just makes makes them go down, I‚Äôve never had more health but I‚Äôve always goes down with plates on
---
It‚Äôs more extreme than that, based on the video you linked from rogue-9, took armor adds **two armor** to an operator (turning a 1 armor into a 3 armor, 2 into 4, etc)
---
OP, remember to credit the artist in the future.  
---
Anyway artist is Shureder.
---
You could've cropped it atleast
---
Nope it doesn't work. My smurfs on my uplay account. I need to 2 copies. So that sucks.
---
Memes. That's why.
---
I have heard good things about [this keyboard.](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gaming-keyboards/g213-rgb-gaming-keyboard.html) I would recommend taking a look. I use a different Logitech one, but I have been using the brand for a long time, and it has been working well for me.
---
Yes, but whats the point of valk? Giving the defenders an extra crutch to the victory, like bulletproof cams, they are not needed if theres good communication, but it can help.
---
why
---
LOL true.
---
Well.....I may have been using my mobile hotspot

Yeah it's pretty cool. Unfortunately, your main is trash.
---
I think that is the one man.  Thank you!  Has a palm rest and everything. Think I'll go for it :)
---
If I'm remembering correctly, alpha packs have the cosmetic inside already decided when you first receive the pack. Not 100% sure on this, but there is no point to saving them unless you want to open several at once.
---
Keyboards aren't that important, buy the cheapest one available and you'll have 40 left for a game.
---
My idea is to use Fuze everytine on hostage
---
It looks like a network issue but you‚Äôre also getting frame rate issues as well, so it could be that as well. 
---
Are you using the same router/modem as before you moved?
---
Are you using the same cpu?
---
Oh thank Thanos that's cleared before things went South!
---
So?
---
damn, if only xbox had a built in recording system.... oh wait.
---
Being a tf2 player aswell I know the good trick of hiding the laser behind another wall
---
Glad to hear I could help. You can't go wrong with RGB right?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible but it‚Äôs very difficult
---
When I get home I can inv you to my discord and help you out. Name and tag for discord are Zayles#3997
---
Naw, I get what you mean. It's a little spicy just to be like "here's an independence charm" and just completely ignore the corrupt leadership and burning Amazon. I understand why they ignored it. It just feels a little fucky to me in light of what's going on.

Headshot machine if you blow the whole mag and get lucky

Shit really? I need to watch the videos again then. Either way still increases the TTK.
---
Flair checks out
---
damn, do you live in a boeing?
---
All they had to do was hide
---
Agreed /s
---
It doesn't give you more health. Watch the videos I linked, it increases your TTK by making you more resistant to bullets.
---
Let's just not address you're shooting a wall from about 10 meters
---
Username check outs.

It's not like the frost has the best pixel peak in the world.

Too* well*

Don't get shot

Yes debris is still and will most likely remain client side for ages. I know it‚Äôs annoying but ubi doesn‚Äôt seem to care about fixing the most apparent issues.
---
&gt; On every other sight you aim at the center of the reticle.
---
ACOG?

Ugh, that's ugly (coming from a Brazilian). Last year's was much better.
---
They even won that round after a guy blew himself up

üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Ah okay

People know about this and try to rappel up to cut the rotation off from the ramp but if you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôll prep the door by the train so when you reinforce the hatch you run over to the double train doors and fall through the hole from the roof and run back in site.
---
Wow you need to get back into so you can be as good as the pros you watch... it is attainable
---
Dont you think instead of using it on some dummy at 80 health, it would be better used to revive someone to 90 or heal up someone who is actually low?
---
It‚Äôs a suggestion.
---
Because the aiming is more exact. And it isn't as choppy as it is on console.
---
Umm i was watching pro league last weekend and i seen i reverse monty plant üòÇ
---
wasting resources doesn't make you a team player
---
Agreed
---
Yeah I made a post about this a year or so ago.  It‚Äôs a terrible design choice.  You could say that it‚Äôs there to force you to retreat but if I can‚Äôt hear anything I‚Äôm not going to want to retreat.  When I‚Äôm that hurt that‚Äôs when I need to hear the most.  I mean I guess it‚Äôs better than your whole screen going red like in MW2.  I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs been in the game this long.
---
 Every time I try and use a laser I'm ~~self~~ conscious of how someone is gonna see it.\*
---
You can't be self conscious of anything other than yourself, that's why it's called *self* conscious.
---
Hey nice well done! I‚Äôd love to see it
---
Aaaawww now i feel bad
---
Yeah but then you‚Äôve got that whole thing about servers failing for legitimate reasons and people losing elo unfairly
---
Nice drawing but crappy legendary
---
It's Zofia right now.
---
That‚Äôs the last thing I expect a Doc to do for me.  If I get tased by a Twitch drone, I‚Äôll just need to play a little more cautiously for the time being.  It‚Äôs my fault it happened so I gotta do better during the round. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care, but I might be ready for a change
---
He was a bot so using vigil made u invisible to him
---
Yeah, but ACOG has other marks, and reflex is like a red dot, has only one mark. Its counterintuitive
---
It's a Swedish made shotgun though.
---
Thank you for being honest.
---
Lol
---
nahh, he aint 51, ...is he?
---
Thats a pro team. A team that works together and has each others back. Big difference.
---
Well In a perfect world I could see it happening two ways.
---
1. Add a "proleague playlist" that emulates  proleague play with all the maps and rules of proleague for all the wanna be pros.  Add all the maps to ranked for the more casual player that wants to get sweatier than casual but less than the proleague playlist.
---
Or
---
2. Make another playlist called year one or OG or something like that. Add all the maps and game modes. Give people a "casual rank" or "year 1 rank" so it matches them with people in their skill range so it's sweatier than casual but people can still enjoy their favorite og maps like house, plane yacht, Bartlett, etc. 
---
Wouldnt be perfectly balanced obviously. But some people have a lot of fun on games that arent perfect. An example to throw it way back, old cods like mw2. Granted that player base is likely not represented on this subreddit 
---
Or ubi could figure something else out that makes more sense to them
---
What do you mean by ping abuse
---
Yeah but even when you step back there is absolutely no correlation between the laser and the bullet hole it seems completely random
---
Have to agree with AR33 having the best feel in the game.   For secondaries, I'd go with the Deagle.
---
"trying to have fun" &lt; accepts the vote to kick for no reason
---
yeah i think i've had it with this sub &amp; stuff like this in my feed lmao, deuces

Exactly. I play Fuze all the time and he‚Äôs always been a great op to me. People think he‚Äôs bad because they try to Fuze Windows all the time. Pro tip: that‚Äôs suicide. Only Fuze from above, and take a buddy to cover you. Simple as that. It‚Äôs beyond easy to both get kills and absolutely annihilate enemy gadgets from above, at very low risk to you. Just enter, pop those bad boys to cause some havoc and flush defenders out of objective for your team, then breach the floor and cover them from above. Easy win

UBisoft doesnt host their own servers. They can not stop DDOS attacks. Please stop posting about console DDOS complaints here.
---
That definitely happens sometimes. My headshot kill ratio is something like 37 or 38%, meaning 1/3 kills is a headshot. But there have definitely been games where I‚Äôve gotten 3 kills a round and all are headshots. Wonder why that is, like how come it seems like you just go on a streak of them sometimes

5. 10/10 cosplay

Its all personal preference to me. I like using it on some guns but some guns just don't work well with it.

As a "DPS comparison," yes, it would be horribly wrong, but, as long as they are all calculated the same way, the chart should still be accurate as long as you remember that it isn't DPS.

weird, but will be fixed anyways next season

I'm all for new players playing this game but I never notice a difference when a free weekend comes along. I only ever get teammates who have no idea how to play the game. Meanwhile, the other team is a 5 stack of diamonds. It sucks not having a full group to play with.
---
Yes
---
Idk, a bit I think
---
i tried it in casual, too much crackhead energy for ranked tho
---
Jesus Christ it's Jason Borne
---
Good shot. YES
---
The smg 11 is a much better choice tho
---
I need laser eye surgery, fast
---
Very nice with controller
---
Ok man just end it
---
Because it was only down to me without hatch blown or really any way into bomb sites. Also, I had no call outs or any idea where people were. (Also an assumption when its 1v3 in favor or defense)
---
Ahhh console, that explains it.
---
Your username was only funny the first time it was done. Now you just look like a clown
---
yeah you're right. clash' side arm is still fucking broken
---
*vomits violently*
---
Nice sketch! I use to be a dokkaebi main but then a bunch of my friends started playing her at once and nokk came out so now I mostly play nokk. Still got it with the bosg tho
---
I accept this as canon
---
It‚Äôs a separate game, but is based on a previous event in siege called outbreak

Also yes I‚Äôm pro game not gamer
---
I shot someone with the Super Shorty once. It wouldn't have made a difference if I decided to tickle them instead.
---
what should I say to make you happy? because I just can't say good idea when it's probably one of the worst ideas from this whole community
---
I'll be honest about it.  When I 1st got the game I didn't realize how much of a disadvantage they put me at on the rare occasion someone actually sees them and..... at this point I leave them on there because I'm just far too lazy to go through and take them off of almost every single gun
---
this is why console is garbage.
---
Bad idea.  Two minutes doesn‚Äôt give attackers enough time to roam clear, determine the strongest entry point, push, and plant.  Two minutes is crunch time and would create panic in even the most calm players because they need that extra full minute to determine the best approach to the situation they saw in the prep phase.  Defenders would be able to do the majority of what they‚Äôre already doing but with less time to worry about defending obj.
---
Basically I already regret posting this
---
Wait for goyo
---
Late game Lesion
---
Will be funny to see this get countered with Amaru when she comes out.
---
Tightens hip fire spread but everyone can see where you‚Äôre aiming.
---
it tights the hip fire
---
That‚Äôs fair I guess but the comment above me suggested that you get a pass if you have to use Mnk to play due to some sort of disease affecting your body, which I disagree with.
---
They realised it was a bit much and gave it to everyone who participated
---
Gives away your position
---
bc they realized the threshold was way too high after the event was over so they just gave it to everyone who contributed
---
Seriously he is fucking amazing
---
Your first mistake was playing on console

Free weekend??

U have officially both ruined and bettered Maverick‚Äôs operator pic
---
&lt;3
---
a lot of r6 players are teenagers.
---
Once you understand that the community's behaviour becomes more understandable.
---
Oh ok thanks!
---
I would say something toxic but i wont today. If you main Maverick and bitch about to ground nerfed Lion it says a lot.
---
Yeah i think somehow was clipping him into the floor or wall and got fall damage
---
glaz was never was the same after the reform
---
Since you didn't know, ubisoft said they were gonna give all users who participated during that event the free skin anyways.
---
Mamma Mia Marcello, thanks for the link!
---
&gt; me wonder even more why it is counterintuitive to you.
---
I don't say it counterintuitive for me. I said it is counterintuitive at all. 
---
&gt; Second: To me that would be removing the sight from the game. It would become a red dot with a slightly different reticle, that still covers up a huge spot exactly where you need to see (which is why the red dot is so rarely used in this game)
---
Ok. i agree
---
&gt; That is just wrong. With reflex the center of the screen is still where you shoot. You are simply not telling a fact here, sorry.
---
May be you right, i not 100% sure. But the point is while the other scopes in the game is designed like "aim with the middle of the mark", reflex is designed like "aim with the top spot of the mark". And it is counterintuitive .
---
i thought I was the only one who noticed this, you're right
---
Life in the fastlaneeeeeeeeeee
---
In their defence ubi also messed up their names in the official teaser and had to re-release it. The leaks also were kind of muddled likely due to ubis internal confusion
---
Look at everyone acting smart by saying " Well if you used your primary you would have had him" well no shit idiots.

You are welcome!

I aspire to be you that accuracy

Hello Toxiccbtw, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d0559e/i_lost_to_teamers_in_a_mech_this_game_is/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I thought that one was haha. I know very little about keyboards clearly, I'll keep looking

Who has the p19?

I try it out every once in a while but don't do too well because I am used to acog and holographic
---
I recently started this game and I don't understand how you guys find the state of shotguns acceptable. You literally shouldn't be able to compete after a certain level since they can't one shot at ranges where they should very obviously one shot.
---
Oh, I can body shot her all day. But when I put a bullet in her forehead, she shouldn't be walking. I've seen it hundreds of times to the point where I literally only aim for upper torso when I know it's her.

Try different operators and find out who fits your playstyle.
---
I‚Äôm talking about ones without skeleton keys
---
Yeah, I hate people who blame others for their shit plays. I really wish there were more players who would call them out when they act that way. As a more seasoned player(1200 hours) I do try to help new players understand their mistakes rather than just saying "don't do that". I also am proud of the fact that I've introduced a few dozen players to this game and they fucking love it. Watching them go from absolute bot to quick peeking mad lads is the best.
---
Mossberg is a swedish company, I thought it was american too! I cried a little on the inside when I found out it wasn't.

Ugh another elitist jacking himself off lol
---
That's a votekick right there
---
So is house. Unfortunately.
---
if you have ever experience cheaters in that capacity or understand the game, you would know that a person shouldnt be invisible and teleporting to the defenders and killing them with their weapon. When they arent even visible to the defenders. 
---
So yes i actually comprehended this guys english really well. I think it is you that has a problem of comprehension. So i will repeat his answer for your question. 
---
"YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE IN YOUR PLAYER MODEL DURING PREP PHASE." 
---
do we need to repeat it any louder for you to comprehend. and yes it would take a simple writing of code in the anti cheat to detect player model movement on attack or when someone dies in prep phase (with the exception of twitch drones).
---
Ok and it‚Äôs changed now so that‚Äôs not the problem anymore. That‚Äôs not what this is about.
---
I feel this on a molecular level. My cas games are always against plats with low silver teammates

So how it works is the day the new season drops, every passholder will get the new ops for free. For one week they will be exclusive to passes. 
---
A week later, they will be open for purchase by non pass holders

Can we talk about how horrible the lag compensation is in this game? This is honestly the most frustrating thing and it's the main reason "peekers advantage" is a thing. 
---
What he saw: Insta died, without the enemy ever firing a shot or even being turned in his direction.
---
What replay shows: She turned and shot 4 or 5 bullets and killed him.
---
That technical issues like this STILL haven't been resolved in this "competitive" shooter is a wonder...
---
Yeah I know just a thought experiment
---
Yeah, what's your point? Microsoft has no legal obligation to try to deal with/report such crimes. If they don't feel that it's a problem, they will generally just ignore it.
---
So, I really don't understand this meme.
---
The idea is good but then it could become more popular than the normal modes with the new players and then we just have another call of duty
---
It‚Äôs still a crime, am I wrong?

If you're rushing it's still a tactical ban. He gets banned sometimes in my plat gamee

And then blame buck for the "tragedy"

No.

This is gonna be impossible when Maru is introduced

Yeah this happened to me one night like 3 months ago. Couldn't play for couple hours.
---
Well you‚Äôre a bit of a c*nt, aren‚Äôt you?
---
Free Weekend is LIT

Wrong. And I'm outside right now. Also don't "do something with your life me" you're arguing with me over something so pointless and I'm just messing around with you. I can't believe you couldn't tell..

Pm me sounds good

I‚Äôm not expecting any upvotes I just posted it so I could save it lol
---
I wasn‚Äôt even alive then
---
We all have a copper play sometimes, it happens.
---
No you weren‚Äôt!
---
Ok. Thanks for letting me know
---
It has to do with camera placement on the character, ubisoft changed the camera placement between the eyes, so there places where people have more field of view
---
fix your ping, boi
---
So you‚Äôre one of the reasons I had to add extra y‚Äôs to the end of my name!
---
Yeah... it makes no sense. That's a really good excuse that surprisingly - despite being dumb af - got traction and people belive it is a way to go.
---
In reality, number of hackers who make cheats is significantly smaller than number of cheaters using said cheats. If you would ban accounts used during creating of a cheat, you have a high chance of stopping hacker from even making that cheat into public.
---
Imagine you are a hacker, you need accounts to test your creation, and if every account gets banned every 1-2 days, you would need tens of accounts before your cheat is ready, that cost money, reducing your profit margin. And even then anyone who will buy it, have to keep in mind, they could use current version for few days before they get banned. Such fun, many clients indeed.
---
Ban waves every 2-3 months turn the game into subscription mode for cheaters. Pay for cheat, pay for copy of game, have fun for month or two, repeat.
---
This isn‚Äôt a video so I can‚Äôt tell you. My guess is he rounded the corner on a delay or he peeked and then shot. 
---
Or it glitched. Or it lagged
---
The player pov is in between and a little above the eyes, so he shouldn‚Äôt be able to see your ‚Äúentire body,‚Äù but it is possible for him to see part of your body from that angle

The fuc?What is the secondary called than?
---
Didn't even notice he ws Maverick lmao
---
Im talking about Mamma Mira. Mamma_Mira for me to be exact.
---
I was playing as lion we were getting alot of run outs all round so on the matchpoint. I scanned at the beging of the round and this rascist fuck and his friends start giving  me shit calling me a bunch of rascist names. It ended up being us two in the room securing so i Tk'd him and quit out before we could win the round.
---
It‚Äôs actually good tho. You have great reaction time, along with a good aim and landed that canister pretty good. I‚Äôm nowhere near your level yet so at least now you know that someone looks up to you :)
---
Haha lion main ‚Äúmane?‚Äù Get it?

Did this twice last week as Kaid, it really is more just being lucky.

huh read my post history and you‚Äôll figure out why lol and if you are to retarded to figure out who i was talking about https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cyohbu/someone_in_my_game_was_ddosing_and_when_i_called/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app also i dont normally look through the post history of people cuz i dont really care but wow your a asshole

I mean I'm pretty bad but damn.

Sony should make it where if it detects any MnK on the system it will violently explode.

Edit: can't spell
---
I can relate to this so much!! It literally happened yesterday in CS i clutched and wiped 7 guys with 10 kills in total and at the end of 5 more rounds i had in total 12 kills.

Yes, it's kind of ironic.

free weekend in a nutshell
---
Playstyle?
---
 Very rushy and agressive
---
I tend to anchor and lurk with mute for the most part, which usually works for me, but yeah he should get a buff
---
Lol I love Pulse.
---
Take the free kill and run with it. Can‚Äôt make it to where defenders can‚Äôt go outside, that‚Äôll ruin the game. People will play the game how they want
---
na, scus to be specific
---
As is the way of console
---
I play on Xbox in the USA. I think it has to do with the way MMR works. I'm ready for the new season with the MMR adjustments for matchmaking. Maybe it won't be so bad.
---
That's highly dependent on your monitor, monitor settings and in-game video settings.
---
Sep 10
---
Thanks for answering. We are trying to build a roster so we can rotate, but since we all just started we only have 1-2 operators on each side. I mainly choose operators based on guns they use (which is probably wrong way for R6) that's why I bought Ashe, but I really enjoy playing defense as Mute, because of his gadget, but can't decide what is more useful, bulletproof camera or C4? Also, I'm saving for Mira, because she has Vector, one of my favorite guns ever. Do you think I should go for her or buy some other operators first?
---
I don't think so... R6 has bullet travel time. Thats the reason you can have a trade with someone where you both kill each other.
---
Casual players play like retards, they're impossible to predict- let alone play against.
---
My second main defender is Dokkaebi but I'd say maestro as he's ez to play whereas Dokkaebi requires skill but if you're good with her she's a real tide turner in game
---
Being team killed?
---
Being voted out?

What‚Äôs your solution?

Cause he activated tge turret and it counts as if he shot that unregistered bullet
---
I already have it!
---
For youtubers I prefer get_flanked and coreross. They cover everything from guides to update-news.
---
For operators I'd recommend getting a few to choose from. You can't always depend on getting your main, so having at least a few options is a good thing. Get a few ops you feel good with and learn their ins and outs.
---
In general: learn the maps and focus on playing the objective. It's a big difference to games like cod etc - don't only focus on killing, focus on the objective and communicating with your team.
---
Have fun with your new game
---
would each mine hurt an operator individually?
---
Thanks!
---
Clearly he had armor

Rise up gamers

I added that so I don‚Äôt look like some bronze talking lol

Increases your hipfire accuracy my 25%, which also includes the transition period while ADS'ing.
---
It's very good if you're an entry fragger who never holds angles, but useless otherwise.
---
It increases your hipfire accuracy my 25%, which also includes the transition period while ADS'ing.
---
None taken, I know full well that I suck lol
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll post a photo when my mask making done!
---
That fucking title though, that shit's gold af lmao
---
To start, it isn‚Äôt terrible to like an operator solely for their gun, but it really isn‚Äôt the best way to do it. You mostly want to contribute to the team and help them out. Rook, for example, allows people to take more body shots than normal. 
---
I like Mira, however, she is more map/site based, because you have to know where to place your Black Mirrors. Her Vector, although a good gun, has CRAZY recoil, and can be a headshot machine if controlled, but it‚Äôs difficult to do so.
---
Also, the Nitro Cell/C4 is always the better option, at least for me. If you know someone‚Äôs there, but they won‚Äôt peek, then you can use the C4 to kill them without warning.
---
Cunt
---
Learn to coordinate an attack.
---
That map REQUIRES you to be able to perform ESL level team coordination.
---
Poor circulation. Go for a walk or something and it should be good
---
:thermitethink:
---
Yes, that is true. Something I do, though, is take my drone back to spawn, or hide it somewhere where the enemy team can‚Äôt see it.
---
No because I'm not playing like a dumbass. I'm just using a difficult loadout.
---
I still make callouts, I still drone and want to play as good as I can. I just like the challenge of the loadout.
---
Its not fun to play Casual because I don't know how successful I am using a handicap when everyone is careless and trying even less than me.
---
U gotta like redo this with proper pictures I‚Äôm so confused I see Bartlett everywherw
---
Yeah I saw few get_flabked videos, but never heard about coreross, thanks.
---
And I noticed I have "problem" of rushing as a defender, trying to apply CoD, BF playstyle, when in reality my goal in R6 is completely different. i guess I'll have to train myself to be more patient
---
The first kill was great. His body just limply falling down.
---
Yeah sorry I didn‚Äôt make the template

VarsityGaming is also good with his Copper to Diamond series, and his Operator Mastery series.

Hibana changed the game the most because it used to be protect Thermite whilst he gets a wall, then escort him to a hatch. Hibana meant everything was getting opened pretty easily. Worst is probably Jackal or Lesion, no skill ops.

mingo.art
---
Mira changed the meta for a lot maps. For example Oregon basement, and kitchen.

Honestly, they should have just nerfed the thermal cover, not basically make him have to stand still to do literally anything.(Also, why frags?  That literally does nothing for him)

My first round as Warden when i swapped to his shotgun. Got an ace
---
No, not everyone can go buy a keyboard and mouse. Sure it‚Äôs inexpensive. But if you want to use KB&amp;M go on a computer. Or if by some weird chance they do, you should be in servers on pc, not console anymore.
---
T hunt definitely helps with that. And a few maps are just bad in general (favela). Honestly tho if you just keep playing casual and even if you don‚Äôt do good at first you will eventually learn the maps and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
He looks like The Rock tho
---
i was an eh player until i followed the recommendations for the terrorist hunt. my aim was poor, and now i am calibrated to play on a wack ass sensitivity of 100-100-100.
---
i actually enjoy terrorist hunt, because there‚Äôs roughly 3 enemies per room, i run in, 3 headshots, 1 magazine, and its onto the next one. it helps to make sure you‚Äôre confident in your aim, not to mention i learned the maps a lot better from playing terrorist hunt. 
---
then make it a statement of a ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù in terrorist hunt before you dive off into several hours with your gang in ranked, to make sure your aim is on point, and your reaction time is ready.
---
Well that's mean ain't it?
---
Putting you in pc servers makes sense but it‚Äôs not happened

I know how to fix it play console u idiot lol üòÇ

---
Omg this happened to me a year ago with lion!
---
No. The map is still extremely poorly designed, there's only two possible rotates from either side of the map. The map itself is extremely tiny, and the sites themselves are incredibly bad.
---
Casual for sure
---
Capacity doesn't matter just make sure it has fast read and writes and is not full all the time.
---
Well her lmg-e stats aren't that bad, if I am not mistaken they are pretty darn close to her at with the exception of fire rate, but who needs that when u have 150 rounds in ur belt
---

What
---
I suggest not being such an arrogant prick buddy.
---
That could be from a game early season
---
The map is literally to small and to destructible.
---
Lets see if they rework it in the next 2 years
---
Not playing the game is still better
---
Recruit
---
The reason why her AR is more commonly picked is cause of the faster RoF and the slightly better recoil with the proper attachments. It also has a very huge difference in reloading speed. HOWEVER you can't suppress someone into a corner with only 30 bullets so who cares
---
Well not to be mean but the place is in a poor city where strong walls aren't common and are mostly thin wood walls.
---
True
---
I like the way it is for casual. That's mostly the nostalgia talking though. All my fav maps are horribly imbalanced, House, plane, yacht, and Favela.
---
This shit bothers me so much! Your screen looks clean, replay shows the person in the open for 2 seconds to line up a shot... makes me feel dumb and frustrated every time.
---
Even if you can't keep the ops, you can play them all for a month and you'd know which ops you liked and which you hated and then you can just buy the ones you like.
---
Yeah I use her lmg cuz I can handle the recoil, and again 150 rounds, fuck reloading, just spray
---
‚ÄúHmmm why do I remember OP‚Äôs name? Oh he‚Äôs the reposter from last time as well.‚Äù
---
He probably felt more comfortable using a gun without an acog in close quarters
---
Especially when you have a buddy who is also rocking an LMG AND is playing Finka
---
You can literally prefire a door for an entire Bomb plant..... it‚Äôs great when it works
---
Those weapons were automatics. The BOSG isn't.
---
Just a bug which has been in the game since lauch afaik. Just use discord or some other app. Only way to fix voice chat not working is restarting or starting a custom game then quitting immediately.
---
God that's fucking horrible... U drew him too tall

I think they announced that Ranked will require an actual unanimous vote.Wont help as much with a situation like this,but it will.
---
I can't believe that the gun and knife fight lasted for that long. I'm not great but my team would have forced me to uninstall if I'd lost that fight
---
Took my brain a minute to process
---
20k more and you can buy a skin
---
How long has this been like this for you? I was worried it was just me, but maybe their servers have been bad lately?
---
Is that in euros ?
---
R6 is competitive, just not enough. In the state that it‚Äôs currently in, it can‚Äôt compete with games like CS, if Ubisoft would just try and fix some of the well known issues that the community screams about on the daily it could have a chance.
---
Speaking of holding doors the 150 drum mag also makes it an easy bait for people who dont pay attention. Just today I was prefireing through a door stopped halfway and waited. Lesion came almost immediately and I finished him
---
When in reference to Russia, it kind of does. I'm not even mad, just found it in bad taste.
---
A couple of rounds but normalised afterwards
---
Game: Tells you to reload.
---
Last 40 bullets in belt: Am I a joke to you?
