I left CSGO for this because I got tired of having to run FaceIt just to have a decent experience, since MM is a meme... and a really shit one at that, too, at this point. Also doesn't help that, well, spinbotters still find a way to creep in and bypass FaceIt's proprietary anti-cheat from time to time (as rare as that is, it actually made me prefer to deal with the vaulting+teleporting cheats that happen in Siege). Plus the meta is stale.

Fan speed is at 65% pump speed is at 100% and I can’t get AC as I live in the UK

After a match or 2 temps are 80-83c this being a spike average temps are in the 70s which obviously isn’t good

Probably won a game with a hacker on your team which made it reduce points and you probably lost against a hacker that gave you points on another game
---
The sound of reinforcing hatches motivate me to reinforce.
---
I still perfer old Hereford
---
Wdym? Wasnt lesion elite released and smoke elite soon?
---
Well if you’re not close or there’s explosions and gunfire it’s still hard to hear
---
I like the idea of exploding drones but should be high damage, like as much as 20 damage max, enough to kill a downed player, can destroy hatches or open up a hole large enough to vault through
---
I agree that pic is not very flattering but the animation and how it looks in game is pretty cool to me.
---
Wait... Mira elite?
---
Deadass just seen that
---
I want it bad!
---
lol no, keep ranked competitive
---
You fucking piece of shit. 
---
You added your own watermark after erasing the original artist's signature.
---
Not sure if this a troll. Probably is.
---
So a reskin, of what we have already?
---
but you did do it
---
This happened to me too then after a few days it was back

This one officer

He'd be useless if Mavs not chosen though.  He'd be situation like warden, but worst.

Yes. OP also just reposted an old artwork and erased the original signature of the artist and added his own to act like he drew it.
---
Omg this is so creative
---
Repost

Yes Bandit and Cav, the ones who never come get their plates
---
Username checks out
---
I just thought of Hereford because it was the most military oriented map or a whole new map like the western game mode.
---
Not drawn by OP. 
---
He erased the original signature and added his own to act like he drew it.
---
It works both ways, when it's small and u melee someone it looks punch
---
Way more than other countries
---
Depends on what roam game you’re playing. If you’re wasting time I’d suggest cav if they know you’re cav they’ll stick together and be careful of flanks and they’ll normally waste a lot of time looking for you. I also suggest cav because she can play the flank game too because of the silent step and if they’re by themselves it’ll be a free interrogation so she’s very versatile. But if you’re holding down a section of the map I recommend lesion his gu mines are harder to see than kapkan traps and you can see which gu mine was triggered/destroyed a lot easier. Kapkan is still a good character but his usefulness depends on how good your enemies are.

Though you get doo-doo players on every platform. I sometimes mess around and use controller (which I donno how to use) in ranked plat games for a giggle. Still get kills. Game Sense and Positioning &gt; Controller and M&amp;K.

I used to love playing it but it just feels like bs now. I get killed because the enemy shot the air while I am behind cover or my headshots don't register. It happens too often and it might just be me but it's not fun to play anymore, and I should add that I have a great ping.
---
I'm mildly concerned now
---
The old one only had one way internally for defenders to go upstairs making retaking an objective impossible. The hatches were all pretty much useless for attackers and for the defenders as I said earlier only one way back up. Another big issue was the sight placement left some impossible to defend without large amounts of peeking or required entirely separate rooms to be cleared before the attackers could take the objective. The new one for the most part fixes all of these problems, you always have at least 2 staircases back up and the building is large enough that roaming means more than just spawn peeking.
---
Goodluck bröther

Fr how are skinny jeans a good idea for someone working in law enforcement? It limits your flexibility bigtime.
---
It was an ash main who cares
---
You dont have to, but if you want to I play on pc
---
I was expecting that
---
Tbh I kinda wish they done more operation health’s
---
You forgot the 12 year old kid saying he fucked your mom and that you’re a nigger.
---
Placement doesnt matter as long as its down soon as the rook spawns, the guy getting the armor so late that he's able to get headshot from that bs oregon spot must have been either afk or kapkan that decided to grab it too late because time is obviously a premium, but there is plenty of time to grab the armor after reinforcing 2 walls.  
---
That guy who died that way just needs to prioritize what he does better or not be afk.
---
Boots with the fur

Damnit, late again...

Ash would slip and slide through those bullets with her breadstick of a hit box.

That's because it's not true.

Yea I tried leaning away from being an anchor, it feels weird but good getting into gunfights more often
---
Take my downvote shitter
---
what if ubi is listening and keeping old Hereford as in timeline old and we haven't figured it out yet.
---
It is, and has been proven several times. Whenever I think I should’ve gotten the kill, I take a look at the clip and slow it down, never has it once shown be indisputable proof that it should’ve been a kill.
---
Completely accurate
---
I can hear this image.
---
I wish I could upvote that more than once
---
boohoo someone else is getting fake internet points
---
So...were you? Or exploiting in anyway?

For those of you who don't know the RG15 pistol (found on GROM operators) has a green laser dot instead of a red

I would find that fuckin hilarious.

---
Same, although I'm not a big fan of new Hereford either; but when you compare the two, new Hereford is much better. Not sure if people saying Old Hereford is better is just a meme or they don't remember how poorly balanced it was. Either way, I'd be down for them bringing back to casual.
---
IDK about no racism on SCUS.....

Heh. I used to hit those pings all by myself!

Now I want to speed run that game again, man portal was so fun
---
Drugs? Why no drugs?
---
If you want to inform people on the importance of crediting artists, maybe then you should take action and do it yourself? Its also not like the watermark was removed from the piece anyways.
---
Not this map then. Looks like another Fortress.
---
Dumbythicc
---
That was awesome!
---
Now *thats* PHAT
---
Why did i hear it with megumin's voice fore explosion....
---
Since they are re-evaluating the ranked map pool, I know Hereford is getting out, so add Old back into casual and get rid of the new one, I don't care if its unbalanced for Maverick or Nomad, its Casual, not Ranked
---
I would love to have an r6 soda maybe something like the renown booster drink
---
How has it been proven several times? Please tell me, and just because you never experience bs doesn't mean other people's experience is the same as yours. Hit registration is awful in this game, unless you have the lowest possible ping and even then I'm sure it's still bad.

He's a boon to roamers and easily the most annoying. Plus he's the least counterable, sure you can ban therm but you can easily just go bandit or kaid. And all the other ops don't change up the meta as much in one v ones.

In the feed he should be tking

Although it’s very loud when being triggered it’s not so clear when it’s destroyed depending on how far away the traps are from each other

So you want the signature to be so visible that until it blocks the art ? They made it small so that it is still pleasant to look at the art while keeping the right of his work.

if you don’t restart the queue after 2 minutes you’re just wasting your own time. it’s common sense.

And you gotten love those moments when the entire community unites in "okay Ubi wtf" after seeing a SS or clip that clearly shows Ubi fucked something up
---
Awesome i'll give it a go thanks!

Thank you dude! Oh about the Dr.Pepper: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/90smo1/since_you_guys_seemed_to_like_my_montagne_dew/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

bruh
---
i'm not saying it's bad, just not really a necessity
---
"xbox record that"
---
It happens though. You get into a fight, you need, you duck behind cover and need to quickly toss a nade out.
---
You drone, I push!
---
Yes I was playing it with my friends every day and I will recommend it for everyone , even tho the game has loosen some number of players .
---
Rooks armor is way better than Doc’s pistol.
---
20% damage reduction for the entire team as well as doubled bleed out time and guaranteed down. Even if Doc manages to use all 3 stem shots he still provides less of a benefit than Rook, unless Doc manages to revive.
---
Also, Rook’s armor is proactive while Doc’s pistol is reactive, meaning that Rook helps you win fights while Doc’s pistol requires you to win the fight first.
---
Doc also has to survive to use his gadget while Rook has a 100% success rate (unless your teammates are really dumb).
---
Is this Juice from SOA?

Totally unrelated but on the topic of changing, how do I change this flair back to normal?

my POV
---
You know what, you're right i want to hang a live cat by my gun and strangle it each time i lean, great idea
---
Awesome work, how did you get that font for the title?
---
Mira’s smg is way better than the smg-11
---
Jager pulse and ying should be one up each
---
I don’t know because I can :/
---
Idk a friend sent it to me he made it
---
Again, I'm looking at more of their impact across the whole round rather than strictly what their abilities do. Doc has more utility and better gadgets, and ultimately has a better chance of helping the team overall compared to Rook. Sure, Rook may have a 100% success rate if everyone on the team gets their plates, but Doc has a higher chance to do more good, and again has better gadgets.
---
Sorry, do you mean they ban operators?
---
On this point I can say you are ok not using the voice, but in ranked it's all it matters, if you are nice to others and give good call out no one will care about the 9 y.o. voice.
---
Grind those, you move more, you play more (you die less) and you engage way more!
---
Sure, it doesn't teach you everything, but you learn a lot more about shooting and the maps themselves.
---
Is this supposed to be a general tier list or focused on higher levels? Castle on a coordinated team is insane
---
As well as clash
---
I also decided to do it from above using spectator mode! Turned out pretty well.

This shit gets reposted almost every week and still manages to always get +1k upvotes oof
---
Oh snap
---
I just tried this and Holy S*** it’s absolutely beautiful imagine playing a match like this..
---
S-tier is meant for straight broken operators, and I wouldn't say Jäger is broken. Pulse isn't exactly strong, as his guns really hold him back from being better. (I hate the UMP and the shotgun he has.) Ying's job to get defenders out of position is just done way better by operators like Dokkaebi, Capitão, and Gridlock. And finally, Mute's effectiveness is entirely dependent on the objective. Some objective he's super effective such as downstairs on Oregon, but on others I would rather just have Mozzie or Bandit. But thank you for the input. :)
---
Not really
---
I've ran into more hackers in cas then in ranked. Worst part is no one believes me
---
During the weekend, so 16th to 18th is correct.

Also while we are at it , can UBI please add bomb sites to this map if they are discovered please? 
---
Even though I am plat I still get autism when I have to change in 2 seconds
---
You only have 1 life per game. That life is worthless. Attack bravely and take more than 1 of the opfor with you.
---
OpFor is short for Opposing Force, aka enemy.
---
TLDR: was at matchpoint in the Australian Map. 3 attackers left. The guy ahead smokes the corridor leading into OBJ then got killed. I was about to go in when the last guy finally showed up. It was a Glaz! Saved!
---
What did Glaz do? Stood there looking at the smoke room (not ADSing with his banana scope. Just regular looking at it like a lost puppy then smoked the other direction and began holding it.
---
WTF? Glaz, you have banana vision, just use it and kill them all. Needless to say all the attackers died. Then I looked at his stats. Unranked level 6 - it was a Casual Match.
---
Ubisoft's fault - currently running a Spetznaz offer for more renown if you play and win as Spetznaz and this newbie thought he was a leet sniper. One who aims in the other direction instead of an already smoked out OBJ.

Surprised twitch is on B and not A rank as she has one of the best guns for frags.
---
You: *want to see through the Wall with miras Gadget*
---
Miras Gadget: NO
---
I just hate ubisoft for haveing shity developers that leaves glitches and buggs all over the game....
---
And despite shield concept in this game...if i ever deside to leave it, it will be cos shields, completely ruin game imo and will never get balanced.
---
:(
---
Why don't rush? Plenty of times rushing works. I don't rush and sometimes the game is over before I have even caught up with the rushers - i.e. either they slaughtered all the defenders or they are all dead and it is 5 v 1 waiting for me to walk through that corridor to evade 5 bullets, Kapkan traps, Frost mats, electrified barbed wires, electrified walls, Maestro laser beams, Echo shots, Ela mines, C4s, impact grenades - you name it.
---
Also sorry for weird wording i'm not a native English speaker, i also have the game in English so i can give Callouts and i don't have to akwardly translate the names
---
ranked is completely different fromc asual, study maps, practice aim and find a squad to play wth if you want fo get seriously into it
---
That is an operation health meta. We have moved beyond doing the hard breacher thing - in many rounds they are no where to be seen in recent seasons.
---
The D-50 is amazing provided you ADS. If you hipfire, you are dead.
---
Wrong u should add the time from the first kill to the last kill
---
&gt;Oh wow, message Ubisoft and complain because that's bullshit
---
Aww \~ Isn't that cute since they cannot disclose anything; it's your data so you got the rights to. Request a refund, you are not cheating unless they can proof otherwise. 
---
While those auto-ban can be annoying; they can at least give you the 'process' which caused the ban, and at least investigate it further. 
---
Banning and telling it's cheating is nice and all. If they cannot proof it it's just a false positive; If they ban you without giving proof it's denying access to something you have paid for; I don't think that's allowed by law? At least a refund seems in order?
---
in all seriousness it would probably help me learn them easier lol.
---
Poor guy actually tried. Dropped another pest there because the first wouldn't hop onto my drone. Fat RIP.

Me and a friend were TK'd by a pulse in ranked in prep phase. He put down a nitro in commander's and walked away from it (behind the desk), then exploded it when we were walking close to it and said "it was just an accident". To anyone who picks pulse to TK, fuck you
---
It is the same.
---
CONSOLE CURSOR TIME
---
They cant thats why. This was suggested many times before.
---
To be fair it isn't that clear. It's only really evident on a couple maps like Hereford and Border, when there's the West and East entrances
---
Well i see some comments says that you should lower your sens , i play on a low sens but i dont think that you should do the same unless you are playing on insanly high sens , For your aim try CSGO its free now + you can download workshop maps and train its really good and i think good sens in csgo is between 2.5-1 i play on 1 but i dont advice you to go lower or higher than that , for your reaction time try human benchmark site they have a test just play it everyday and you will get better , play it like for 2 minutes every 5 hours or something like that , when i started i  was 220-250ms but now i can get to 150ms at my peak , besides all that there is something called game sense that cant be learned from CSGO or sites you must play the game to get it right to know the angels and the maps maybe watching pro players might help , all i could say is just play the game and you will get better and better , dont rush it . ( CHOOSE A SENS AND DONT CHANGE IT )
---
Is it ? I feel its much faster and i cant hit my shots , maybe i have to change the fov or something ?
---
But make it able to take it off like in BF, during the game
---
*Pulse and Blitz could be moved up a rating in my opinion for sure. They’re the only changes I would’ve made to my own ratings*
---
I doubt that will work since the program is still basically on your hard drive, another user is basically another folder in the system folder, I don't see how creating another user solves it.
---
If BE checks the system for cheats, and not only while they are running, then you shouldn't really cheat, even in MC.
---
She’s gonna need to Finka bout her decisions after that one.
---
The bottom should be the memes
---
You changed aspect ratio in display settings right? You fon't need to change anything, different aspect ratio will feel different...
---
Her guns are bad but her gadget makes her still pretty damn good actually.
---
I wouldn’t move blitz but i cab agree on pulse
---
Meh idk if i agree that much
---
The whole point of siege is coming prepared to the right beforehand, there's no equip/unequip function.
---
Everything has an advantage and also a disadvantage.
---
6.5 maybe a 7. This is actually really good, cosplay worthy.
---
Maybe yeah. Pulse was a certain for a move up in my opinion. Blitz (and shields in general) can be so strong though
---
Sadly, I'm a man so I can't cosplay :(
---
Yeah but that kinda makes shields selfish
---
An issue for which I created an R6fix post that expired, without being “acknowledged”, after being confirmed by 6 others. I’ve seen Ubi act on bug reports that don’t have any confirmations, but usually they designate them as acknowledged.
---
I meant to put him there lol. I did it on mobile and put all in mid level and then rearranged as the formatting is so frustrating. I totally agree.
---
Does your PC still see it? Check your device manager.
---
Same, I am playing battlefield these days. Hope they could fix this issue for us so we can both get back online.
---
Ding ding ding. After a career KD of 1.17.
---
The quality of the game is amazing becouse of the ddossers btw ;)

When did rook get impacts.....
---
Im finka bout using rook for now.
---
OK sorry did not know that have never really been to a convention
---
Real men use iron sights? I use heavy artillery.
---
So have you seen Mavericks in other games?
---
Console cursor is an awful idea.
---
Did you not read my reply where I called him out for it?
---
That's absolutely definitely goddamn right. But Ubisoft will be working on produce new operators.
---
That happened to me too the other day, they tried to vote kick him I denied then they vote me and he votes it. I don't know why people do that hey, desperation or herd mentality.
---
My blood was close to boiling though oh well, the vote system sucks anyways I don't even bother vote to kick when i'm team killed on purpose I usually just leave or I stay in game just to make loud noises and make useless call outs if it's in ranked.
---
This is either gfx card driver, corrupted files on your os or the gfx card died, which is possible giving its age.
---
First try removing and then reinstalling your gfx drivers. Use Display Driver Uninstaller to be sure you get rid of everything and reinstall as usual.
---
If that doesn't work then your last option will probably be to reinstall your windows os.
---
And if your card doesn't get recognized, it's probably dead.
---
Ah sorry missed that it was you who replied. 
---
I even upvoted your reply without realizing that it was you saying it.
---
I think gridlock should be moved up, she has amazong utility. Smokes, a secondary shotty that can make sight lines, and a gadget that is always helpful post plant. Combine this with an lmg that is actually viable and great for holding angles. Yea she is a 1 speed but you cant play her up close and personal. As someone who likes to play support she is a great op.
---
Use tachanka
---
I said it as a meme, but I usually appreciate console cursors when done correctly.
---
Good example: Warframe.  Fully D-Pad-integrated menu with the *option* of using a cursor, which works very well.
---
Average example: BO4.  Same as above, but the cursor is very basic and some of the mechanics are poorly integrated (changing your class in Zombies, for example).
---
Bad example: Destiny.  No option for D-Pad, forced to use a shitty cursor, all the menus are pop-ups and drop-downs, makes me want to puke.
---
Since R6 already has full D-Pad integration, only blubbering retards would dislike the option of a cursor.
---
Other games are running fine bro like gtav cs Skyrim only R6 is not detecting :( :/
---
That was really well done!
---
On a side note... Why do we have to choose the spawn location before we scout the area with drones? Wouldn't it make more sense to scout first and then choose the spawn location?
---
All skill
---
Okay. Just making sure.
---
I'm lvl 151 and I'm still pretty crap
---
I thought of this idea too, and thought it could also be used to cover the bottom of barricaded doorways from drones, and fill up mav holes.
---
I legit thought that was r6
---
Only season that was worse was operation health and not by much
---
F
---
I played Destiny a fuckton, that's where most of my hate comes from. Also ye I'm a blubbering retard.
---
Not really. Nice try tho.

1. Im not 80s kid.

---
This is the only year that I've not bought the season pass and looks like I've dodged a bullet. I can see the next season pass sales down massively if they don't add interesting ops and new guns for the rest of this year.
---
Miss me with that ad shit
---
Get out od here
---
Although these are available in ubisoft club rewards (uplay rewards if you're on PC)
---
Should have clarified it. It's console, I can imagine Ela ain't as strong on PC even with her Grzmot Mines.
---
Y'all ever rush a barricade and knife it or shoot it and it just happens to get you a kill? it's weird when it happens but damn if its not satisfying
---
*laughs in Portugal*
---
Capito isn’t essential neither is bandit for that matter because he can be replaced by Kaid, none of the operators are really essential because utility can only bring you so far in a game. Some are just more helpful.

I said this years ago and got shitted on in this sub lol...

Nah dude, overkill is using a nitro cell to block the entrance and then blow it when you here a drone

I know it’s stupid, but I still spawn there
---
I'm on console and a ton of people play ella shotty because lots of people on console can't control the evo at all so when I play ranked with my freinds there is an ella shotty every game and the reasoning is because of the extend barrel it's making it a great tool for objectives live Hereford bank and challet
---
I guess they probably should have kept that BETA tag on it for another year... or forever. XD
---
Bandit been smoking what he’s selling

so true lol

Same thing happened to me. Feels so weird yet satisfying when you throw a metal wall at sledge, but he ends up coming the other way and bopping your a*s.

And the map should show where the objective is

Have you ever played console?
---
I know it's asking a bit much for new maps 4 years down the line, but it really breathes new life into the game. A week into this season and it felt like nothing has changed.
---
Why should Ubi make him even worse?
---
Yeah.. but rounding up by 1 is a lot closer don't ya think
---
I mean it's not like most of the community thinks otherwise /s
---
Good man
---
Nope bandit is my main but Tachanka is my lord
---
flick = bolo or shroud
---
Awesome! Thx. Gonna check it out now.
---
He got clintoned
---
It’s harder than other guns, but just because they’re not used to it they call it like impossible and shit it’s just kinda stupid. His gun has more recoil, you have to kinda accept that
---
Pick and ban? Wonderful change. Very dynamic and strat based.
---
Kate rework? Brilliant. Definitely better than having a new map with it's own balance issues. I'd much rather have a balanced map than a new and imbalanced map.
---
New ops? Nøkk is good but needs aggression. Waden is bad though.
---
Guns? You play this game for guns? Last time I checked, A, this isn't csgo, and B, siege has more than twice the guns that literally any other game on the market has. Wouldn't hurt to use old guns once in a while. Just remember that sledge and Thatcher have the same guns and nobody complains about the l85. And seriously? Your complaint is the guns? There are people who have religiously mained ash since day 1 and that's the r4c in 90% of the rounds, and now the same guys are complaining about an "old" gun? That's hypocrisy right there. Pick a side, for Lord's sake!
---
I'd rather have a season with weak ops that can be safely reworked without impacting the meta badly than another season like Chimera. Definitely a "safe" season, but far from bad.
---
Locate the bath hazard!
---
By restricting the vortex to mainly new op's weapons we are being further incentivized to buy new operators or season passes. Simple as that
---
What happens in the bedroom. Stays in the bedroom.
---
Then get a squad. Best to play this game with people you know.
---
Don’t forget the fun high pings bring
---
Username checks out.
---
Suspect neutralised.
---
Apparently the team that connects first is always attack first, they need to fix that
---
Happy cake day
---
I've just assumed that I was just naturally good at controlling recoil, I guess? I've been able to control every gun in the game with little to no practice. The Bearing 9 just took me a day or two because of how ludicrous it's recoil is.
---
My Eldian ass think: "oh, that Marley".

Dupreeh is sweating bullets...

I wasn't in this game but I played with him B4.
---
I honestly wish they’d let us set the ammo counter as the default bullet count or the Realism Mag count that’s in Custom Games. 
---
I really like the fact that once you drop a mag in that mode, it stays as empty as it was and you might end up with 1/2 a mag instead of a full one. 
---
It would definitely make people more aware of their firing and so on because they’ll just run out of it and not realize.
---
I like it, good idea.
---
Goddammit sorry ;-;
---
Oh SWEET, not sure if you remember me but my username is Heartbreax, you carried our whole team by like 7 kills lmao
---
I see nothing wrong here, fuze is doing exactly what he needs to do.

https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:154-353395-16&amp;ct=tcm:154-76770-32 The ranked disparity bit.
---
Oh thanks
---
I don’t think Europe is non-toxic as a whole. 
---
I’m sure there are plenty of toxic people, especially in soul-corrupting games like Dota or LoL. It just so happens that I don’t play much in EU servers, and every time I did I ended up having a great experience.
---
And instead of posting yet another “oh look at this asshole, I fricking hate fricking assholes frick”, I wanted to applaud gentle and polite behavior instead :)
---
Yeah I practiced with it in thunt for hours and now I'm OK with it. Not the best tho. I can play smoke here and there with shotgun managably but the SMG 12 I'd avoid
---
the whole sentence is wrong imo. just saying that he's toxic. and i thought they havent fixed that auto ban on country name
---
Me and my team do this every time were on a map known for spawn peaking. We will all (all 5) spawn peak the same spawn from either from the exact same window or from 5 different areas.
---
It's easy to distinguish people that tk on purpose
---
Nobody would ever play if there’s not squad matchmaking. Plus there’s no real incentive to play.
---
Fuze helped the hostage. I see no problem here.
---
They streamlined it recently so it’s faster. It’s still slow tho
---
That’s actually really cool ngl
---
Dog I cant fuckin get out of silver getting TKd every other game congrats my dude.
---
Oh yeah! Haha you wanna play sometime?
---
Oh my bad, 2 speed was supposed to be another option, although it may be too weak. I'll edit that out.
---
Same here, was gold 1 all season and finally it plat 3, decided to play cuz fuck it it’s part of the game to lose then went on something crazy like a 13 win streak now I’m almost plat 2.
---
The best thing to do is have it off at all time
---
Yeah of course man, I’ll add you when I’m on tonifgr
---
For all you content creators
---
I want a full subreddit of this gud boi
---
Only if you have a crappy monior you should enable
---
I feel like it should be an audio device that plays footsteps and throws off enemies, I don’t think it should be an effect like echo. Plus the addition of frost’s smg are meh, I’d prefer a UMP.
---
Kaplan is the new operator who can put traps so obvious and blatant that the human brain is incapable of registering them.
---
It’s also a word in German that means chaplain, so I imagine autocorrect recognized it from my list of keyboards/languages. :)
---
For the particularly obtuse out there, I meant Kapkan.
---
Also if you're interested :P [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cozt10/i\_made\_a\_3d\_image\_to\_use\_with\_3d\_glasses\_of\_ash/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cozt10/i_made_a_3d_image_to_use_with_3d_glasses_of_ash/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

You're insulting people on an internet forum about a video game. That's how you're making a fool out of yourself.

If you're in the objective you will stay DBNO to contest it.

Alright. I might be on tommorow I'm sightseeing rn

That discord sound got me good

Oh sweet, have a good day mate

It's a hacker

Never played this one but I used to love Rainbow Six 3 Black Arrow
---
Makes me want that user-made-op that can sandbag the holes...  Hnng
---
You too
---
DataMiner.
---
Not yours
---
Nice trigger finger ツ
---
Haha haha haha
---
sometime you find a match, so that people can do challenges. however most of the time they just kill each other. You can change it to where you can go Solo or bring in your squad only. I recommend changing matchmaking preferences to T-hunt classic only because the other 2 modes are hard to do alone or with just 1 friend
---
I play solo t-hunt to warm up or for daily/weekly challenges. I wouldn’t really look to hard to play it with radios in a queue cuz you’ll find difficulty getting teammates. 
---
Play alone as a warm up
---
When was this taken?
---
I swear I made a dick hole like that in that spot like three weeks ago
---
Hahahahahahaha, your feedback is greatly appreciated
---
The first guy I search never got diamond this season lmao.

I know that it doesn't happen only to me, and that's the point of the post m8.
---
This shit isn't supposed to happen. And no, I'm not the only one that is making an "outcry" just open your eyes. The game. Is. Unplayable.
---
Fair enough, thank you
---
Fair enough
---
I see lol thank you
---
Damn nice clutch
---
Thank you!
---
They aren't diamonds my guy. You can check their stats on r6stats before you spout bullshit after you lose.
---
why? he should, 90% of the time he is fuckin useless.
---
Wait, this is illegal
---
It was probably me
---
IQ grenades being given to Finka. Don't understand why Ubisoft decided to give a Russian Super Soldier grenades, which were working so well with IQ's gadget. According to some people it's because she was getting too strong in Pro League.
---
Time traveler
---
#RECRUIT DA BEST!
---
Just joshing you 😂
---
He's a defender not an attacker.
---
Plus, he just needs a buff, but that would make him a bit too strong imo.
---
Let them buff the recharge speed and make it similar to Cav, Vigil, and Nøkk.
---
2x scope?
---
I did, 4 of them hit diamond this season that’s what it showed me online anyway...
---
I’m pretty sure they were playing with their feet the whole game
---
MEME OVERLOOOAAAD
---
In my opinion, Echo.
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah it was a few weeks ago lol
---
I wasn’t disrespecting the artwork I was disrespecting you.
---
Operation Health 2
---
Scorpion &amp; SMG-12 recoil.
---
It was too strong with an operator with a little hit box
---
My eyes
---
HAHA. I didn't notice Sry. But it look really cute tho
---
Thæñk ÿœü
---
Jaeger and vigil both have an AR, and nokk and jackal have an smg, no reason a defender can’t have an attacker utility
---
I love it as a casual map and to mess around but that’s about it
---
Can we have one of the operators do "Excuse me What the Fuck"
---
Ÿœür węłçœmę
---
I’m famous
---
Yessssss
---
I would say that PC is much more tactical in cas (meaning more casual players understand the basic to almost advanced tactics at lower levels) 
---
Monitor - this is one of the most u forgiving FPS’s I’ve ever played, so everything little thing matters. If you can scrape together the change to get a 144Hz monitor over a 60Hz trust me it makes a difference. 
---
You will notice less toxicity playing pc as well
---
Thank you !
---
Lol, that was me at the end. Good shit man.
---
The new Hereford base, this ones more balanced but I loved the old one
---
Bro. Those things were fucking laser beams with a shit ton of fire rate.
---
Oh yes! I can't wait! The week of wait I have left before I can set up my pc feels so long...
---
Bruh, those are guns.
---
The secondary gadgets are on the team it compliments the most.
---
I'm pretty sure you are protecting an asset that they want dead.
---
you're probably right. But what about finka!
---
Offence is Hibana and Mavrick, defence is Echo and Vigil.
---
I believe their is already leaks I saw something the other day I’ll try and find the channel
---
Thought it was a rage post at first lmao thinking you were gonna put your fist through it.
---
casual is awesome
---
I wouldn't say like proper smoke grenades but like mini smokes the dont last as long but can be deployed alot faster
---
Lesion
---
Is it harder considering I've never played an fps with a mouse?
---
Nice dude, do you play PS4? Cause it's rare to find them and I don't play with many non-toxic people on PS4.
---
No problem.
---
And how do you control recoil on pc? Do you just drag down? Must feel wierd.
---
Everyone knows
---
Play THunt solo. Pros do it a lot. The AI is not really the challenge here. Gathering map knowledge is of major importance to being successful in this game. It also helps you practice the different recoils. If you don't have friends to play this game with, find some! You DO NOT want to solo queue in Siege! This is a team based game and the only real way to 'git gud' is to have good reliable teammates! Enjoy!
---
Marley and Me is my guess
---
Do you have a particular image in mind ? For reference
---
No no lmao, Siege has given me that anger before but this PC is worth too much to do that to
---
When did I say anything about RGB?
---
Understandable, the mnk situation tho is omega gae
---
The Defenders tint when looking outside.
---
Doesn’t matter, there’s going to be a hundred operators, your going to need to do something new eventually, an ar on defending team is a game changer, maestros lmg is a literally game changer. If a few ops can have attacker only weapons then there’s no reason a single operator who specializes with smoke grenades can’t have smoke grenades, unless it is a game engine limitation there’s no stone written rule that you can’t do that. It would change the meta, and a new one will form
---
All good lmao
---
That is true. For real maestro will never stop firing with either of his primaries
---
This is very true. As a PS4 player, you get kicked a lot for no reason
---
I always use the pistol, quicker change time than the SMG
---
They were OP, I just think they should've nerfed them in a better way than the floppy as fuck recoil they got.
---
Final is one of the only operators I don’t own along with warden so I don’t really have an opinion on that one and I don’t think I’ve ever died to a finka grenade but she’s not picked often in mid gold
---
You missed every shot, and proceeded to jump down after them.  I’m thinking Pulse did the right thing.
---
Damn =3 flashbacks
---
I mean yeah but not to often, i play a lot of valk so i watch the cams then preform that spot with her spas.
---
Holy shot I didn’t know that fuck
---
I looked up all of the dpi and sensitivity settings of the pros as well, lol. I have a corsair mouse, and the average was 800 or 1000dpi for my particular mouse. I guess the best is whatever your mouses natural dpi is? Which mine is 1000 dpi. Always poll as high as possible as well - which mine can go to 1000hz. I've learned too that if you're having a hard time hitting those hard shots, try turning your sensitivity down a bit. And then work back up - it'll build muscle memory and control and then you can slowly fine tune
---
I miss old Hibana
---
Luckily not, would have hated knowing Epstein, but a joke about his death is one thing, seeing the beginning of another argument of Clinton this, Trump that, on the siege subreddit is.. Well.
---
Reddit has enough of those fights lmao, I thought I'd escape them by coming here.
---
You are
---
Ur both retarded but your friend should try to pay more attention before running infront of people
---
Also a good idea
---
Leaving is a dick move. Learn the map and callouts. After you understand the map and play better, you might like it more.
---
Self promotion sucks dude
---
Its okay when you leave but pls don't do it in ranked
---
no.
---
I could care less about leaving
---
You guys are down here BULLYING him/her because people run into a doorway AS HES SHOOTING. If anything, bully the dumbasses running in while he empties the mag in a guys chest. Goddamn
---
My man, you have 3 gold 1's in your team, so that's why you got matched up against 3 plats, also why didn't you photograph the top guy from your team, he's prob plat too.
---
.
---
MnK is a problem, but I don't really mind anymore, if I can hit all my shots before they can I will still win the gunfight regardless.
---
Man thats really embarrassing for the other team lmao
---
I don’t play ranked..
---
ayyy that's me getting shot lmao
---
Night, night, diamonds tonight
---
ayyy that's me getting knifed lmao
---
So you can forget it...
---
I like the idea of adding another bulletproof panel mostly because your team usually blows them up vs tearing them down.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/rumor-rainbow-six-sieges-season-3-operators-revealed-in-apparent-leak/
---
I second this. Been running Valk since she came out.
---
Understandable
---
🅱️appy 🅱️ake 🅱️ay
---
NO TACHANKA IS A GODLY OP WTF DO YOU MEAN? Literally my first 2 aces were with tachanka
---
We already have like what 18 to 20 maps? I think it's much more important to fix those and make them balanced than to keep adding new maps. Also a lot of new maps they've released have just been bad or at least controversial
---
Honestly he’s much more powerful than people think but 270 degrees of turn would be very nice
---
Cool. Thanks
---
look this guy is a complete fraud i know him. i was friends with him for 7 years . now i am in Canada and he is in iran i told him to get 300 karma if he wanted a 20 dollar gift card .
---
🅱️hank
---
ayyy that's me geting shot lmao
---
I am the top guy🤦‍♂️, someone left. We could’ve won the game but my friends started messing thinking the other team was trash. They were playing really bad the first 3 rounds and we destroyed them so my teammates got really cocky. Just frustrated cuz all them players were diamond at one point on their home server.
---
They are, they are diamonds on NA but are plat on EU
---
**According to my rather limited research on their top fragger: https://r6tab.com/680eca52-48d2-48c8-957c-a85fb5a9f126**
---
A lil more than 10 sec but 👍🏻
---
Suck my dick
---
Dogmeat?
---
Id upgrade to a liquid cool cpu fan like the corsair h100i or something similar. Also, if you overclocked that beast of a cpu you probably are gonna get some high temps!
---
Yeah I added an "EDIT" at the bottom, I didn't see you were only with 4
---
I mean I paid for it all myself lmao, would never think about punching it
---
Imagine playing plane and tachanka have a straight line with 9 shields on the way and we are back to day D
---
stay mad
---
I was joking
---
Only thing they could do I guess is improve the recoil for console because the recoil on pc is great.
---
now flip the video
---
Happy Cakeday
---
Welcome to Rainbow 6 Siege..................................
---
It's getting a rework don't worry
---
Congratulations! So how much for are you going to sell this beautiful piece of art?
---
This would literally make him a must pick. Giving him 2 more reinforcements would turn him into the most overpowered operator in the game.
---
He's fine as it is.
---
I herby dub you, a rather good man. Thank you.
---
They clearly look different this just seems kinda racist.
---
If you're on mobile go to sub page and press the three dots in right top corner and press "User Flair", then press Edit and type :Recruit:
---
Do you main one of the people that gets banned a lot?
---
What an idiot......
---
This is why kids shouldn’t own guns.
---
Ikr like please give me these opponents lol
---
But countering a spawn peeker is one of the most fun things you can do
---
Holosight, Vertical Grip and Flash Hider
---
Probably not the best or most popular but it’s my personal preference for Maverick.
---
Got'em
---
Echo no, blitz yes, I love blitz. Picked him all the time. They just ban him because they dont know how to counter him.
---
I am just here to tell you that emojis doesnt belong here on reddit, only in sarcasm or nuked memes but here in reddit we dont want instagramous expression of laugh. Sincerely fellow redditor.
---
I like fuze being a methodical op that can do more than just throw his charges wherever he thinks someone is. He’s better with a little thought pit into him, like baiting someone into a corner with a shield and letting his charges rip, the ying duo, an exceptional gadget destroyer, etc. With a top tier gun I wouldn’t want a speed boost in the slightest.
---
You're welcome.
---
For those of you queueing with bois, night kafe is a great place to put outdoor frost mats (especially outside mining window) and all it takes is an alibi to disguise and maybe a friend to distract enemies
---
Idk man, im black myself and am curious.
---
Console gang wya
---
do you have extended joycons?
---
Stay cleas of the blast area!
---
Putting a drone by your spawn point is a tactic
---
Damn never looked at it like that. You make a good point
---
Only a maestro can compose this many jokes
---
Can I play with you
---
M&amp;k on console tut tut tut ruins console gaming
---
I just noticed that
---
I’m guessing you play in lower ranks like me?
---
Congrats man, i hit plat a few days ago as well cheers :D
---
It's kinda been said but it's not really a Caveria issue you have atm, it's more of a fundamental issue. Don't hip fire like that you are more often going to miss, use your sights. Make sure to sprint especially with caveria who benefits from silent step.
---
Giving him two more reinforcements wouldn’t make him overpowered. If his gun and gadget are underpowered.
---
Reverse Friendly Fire, if you down or kill one of your teammates &amp; they mark it as an intentional TK, the icon will stay by your name &amp; any further harm to your teammates by you will be instead inflicted on you for the entire game.
---
Except he doesn’t have an F2, his guns are quite mediocre, and you would probably do better by just picking the shield and hip firing with the PMM.
---
I play in plat 4 atm
---
Damn, i always be in gold and now silver? I must go back and change that... somehow...
---
Pc
---
Clown town is isnanely shit, everyone hates it but ubisoft makes us play it because...
---
Reasons?
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Copper 6 has been created
---
What reason do you have to kick someone if they aren’t TK’ing and just playing the game?
---
if defuser is planted you can go DBNO as last
---
Diamond 2
---
Have you considered not rushing like a dumbass and waiting an entire ten second before pushing?
---
Is that a wiki copy and paste?
---
The ak12 has the highest rifle dps in the game, insane fire rate and hipfire accuracy, a fast reload and no recoil.
---
He's still unplayable in his current state since he's a 3 armour, but his guns *are* good.
---
Don’t u mean plat2
---
Think before you post
---
I’m gonna guess you’re joking there?

Lol it's very odd

No Im serious, Ive been plat almost every season except for one
---
Ty
---
No I meant about plat 4, that’s not a rank
---
Happy cake day!
---
Yes it does nice 5 k 👍
---
And yet, more downvotes.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Oh sorry, I meant plat 3
---
👌
---
Yeah a 1v4 tho
---
Oh surprising that they ban blitz a lot, once you get into gold and beyond he’s not usually banned for me
---
uwu
---
so you were toxic and teamkilled someone on your team for not picking recruit? imagine posting this and not knowing how mad it makes you look
---
u/uwutranslator also
---
I wish I had the same. I still get gold and silver teammates sometimes. Dont know why
---
“Aim 2” might be a stretch
---
This is what makes it to the front page of the sub. I wish there was a place for actually skilled clips to be shared
---
I don't see anything different.
---
So yeah this actually isn't a Ubisoft issue. Lots of people blame Ubisoft, so just know, this problem is your own internet.
---
Np
---
No feet cam?
---
2 show matches, awesome
---
Prime?! Is that a motherboard or some other accessories?
---
Stfu. Fuze is still a viable option on hostage he just needs to not fuze the hostage room.
---
Cool ace but what flipping rank is that!
---
Plat 3.
---
Watch Varsity gamings siege school. If you are dedicated to being better watch all of his siege school videos, they are great for beginners and explain the core aspects of the game!
---
You've resorted to insults in order to prove a point. You're the lowest of the low. Worst of the worst. Scum of the earth. I've won this argument due to your own destructive behavior. EZ
---
The sad part it clash would win cause of her stupid tasers☹️
---
Is that thatcher on the cover?
---
Toxic players really
---
8/10 at least he tried
---
This happened to me once in casual, I was screaming to my buddies to revive me all while they told me I was walking around. And so I rushed the enemies in order to do something before I perished, luckily I was able to kill that last two defenders and win the round
---
Are you dropping this buggy old turd when cod comes out?
---
Usually a 4 queue of people that just like being assholes, can’t really do anything about it unfortunately.
---
I love this response
---
No...
---
Hahaha yeah but I did get two kills
---
Do you want to help me I have had the game for a year and have just hit a point where I have just rapidly gotten worse
---
Naaaa he got a better carpet
---
And if I'm not mistaken the canadian 9mm also shoots just as fast as the gsh, if not faster
---
The invincible thing allows you to prefire into the back of montagne then shoot someone theres many ways to abuse it, it is not something that would work and is unrealistic the current system is balanced just dont solo queue.
---
Maybe aim .2
---
Holy shit, did u hear him? 
---
If so what headphones do u use
---
Personally I can say I cap out some pistol fire rates even without my macro
---
How fast can you shoot a pistol 🧐
---
Love this style of editing, well done!
---
That statement is true lol I hate when people in ranked ban him... Why not ban an operator that would have more of an effect¿?
---
I agree, personally when I face toxicity it’s never actually serious. I play Xbox and usually play 2v2s over LFG posts and they are all kinda toxic but you can tell it’s all in the spirit of the game. I would so that there is toxicity but it’s necessarily bad toxicity. Also, even if there’s is a lot of bad toxicity, people forget siege is a competitive game, it was a game designed around competition. That’s why it is so balanced ( excluding old lion, jäger and ash)
---
oh ok
---
Damnnnn nice flick
---
If I play pretty much all roamers on def, who should I play on attack? I never feel very confident on attack.
---
What’s your sensitivity?
---
Yes I’ve seen you play with George, you’re absolutely insane ! Will be checking out the content for sure ! One question I have to ask if you don’t mind, do you play on night mode or hi-fi?
---
Hey, the Beaulo event
---
Casual is terrible that's were all the Smurfs live and people who are diamond or plat Cole to sweat there ass off you are better playing off ranked. Casual is the new ranked it's been that way for awhile.
---
It wouldn’t make sense for jackal with the nerf example you gave but it’s the same reason people ban cav blitz and lesion they don’t want to figure out how to play them jackal actually has the lowest win delta for attackers just saying
---
It is from the boys
---
Distance got super nerfed/s good read though, I really enjoyed it
---
Welcome to siege
---
Hey bb i got the book to
---
Intel, or ryzen?
---
He didn’t say it isn’t toxic-he said it isn’t as toxic as people make it out to be. 
---
That means-yes, it’s toxic BUT it’s not as bad as most people think it is.
---
did you get linux on switch
---
Same. 
---
My friends are pretty much the most toxic people I’ve met. 
---
There’s some toxic assholes in Casual and some Smurfs that tbag the shit out of you but it’s not as bad as new players think it’s going to be.
---
I thought that data was before the buff. I guess I need to check that part again later
---
This is a first time for us lol. Weird, not too sure.
---
I understand, but the defender this time is making a choice, a risky one, where they have the potential to be scanned based on what they choose to do
---
Just a little peek
---
Wow, this is as fucked up as slipknot
---
It's time for a buff. I totally agree with you, I love the book. (More than some people, it was being used as a doorstop at my local library)
---
Android so kind of yes
---
How to get worse than a console version?
---
\#BlameLiquipedia
---
Do to the portable nature of the switch, it leads to people using less than stong wifi connections.
---
"Just a little dick"

(≧▽≦) homeless
---
I'll try some terrorist hunt with those setting holy cow but I'll do my best!
---
First off why tf do you care in terrorist hunt, it’s an easy way to afk renoun farm, let’s say ur on vacation just leave ur pc on and do that then you’ll be pretty happy when you come back.
---
I love how those 2 rappel down at almost the same time, just to get shot out like birds
---
No they don't, money does. I'd never have taken that guy hostage in the bank if I wasn't broke as fuck!
---
Shoots five bullets out of eighty count drum mag
---
Swaps to secondary
---
Once monty is close, he *should* win these every time. Smack clash, shoot the feet, if she pulls her gun just put the shield back up. Its like a dance, except its deadly and clash loses.
---
Only time clash can win this scenario is if the monty plays nervous and doesn’t push, letting her slowly tase him to death.
---
No, not really being at a disadvantage and still dunking on shitters is what keeps people up at night
---
Was just messing about with friends in customs when I remembered you can shoot through the windows on the plane. Had no idea how this shot worked...
---
Also, lag spikes.
---
Thanks man appreciate that a lot, for anyone else who might see this, feel free to just join the discord and message me personally with any questions you might have about siege :)
---
You fired 2 shots
---
