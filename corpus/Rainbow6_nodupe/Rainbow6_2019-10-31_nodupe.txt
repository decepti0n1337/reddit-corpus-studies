Pretty funny joke, I see a lot of people laughing

---
Lion look your old gadget!  Where?   *laughter*
---
I mean, honestly. This isn‚Äôt reverse Buck, it should be an underbarrel assault rifle
---
Well of course all guns are harder to use on console
---
You're mistaking her with Smoke
---
lol üòÇ
---
Youre the best big brother I couldve ever asked for
---
Really ps4 and xbox people are pretty good and yet you are being extremely rude to them. Also your grammar is shit. ;)
---
It reminds me of Clash portait, because the end of it, help...
---
Claymore? More like: La- lame whore... right?
---
It‚Äôs a tactical retreat!
---
Yes, that‚Äôs blatant. I‚Äôm just asking about this one in particular. There isn‚Äôt anything they can do to edit the recoil pattern for the gun on console only, right?
---
He forgot to breathe
---
They already do the recoil are less important on console. It‚Äôs just using a joystick is hard and offer less recoil control. I used it for like 2 days and I can control it easily.
---
thank you for your input on my grammar, clearly shows you are a genius. I wanna see you speaking in my mother tongues and then we can talk about grammar again.
---

---
also I do not agree with controller people being good. the gameplay on console is less fluid and very slow compared to PC.
---
Don‚Äôt peek slow + drone
---
Is this Rainbow Six Siege on PS2?
---
what‚Äôs happening to breakpoint?
---
Reverse CAMRS maybe.

I‚Äôve had the most fun out of any gamemode with this one, I don‚Äôt see how me having fun with a cool gamemode means I need to leave.  Let people play how they want and stop dictating everybody.

I meant like in a cas or custom but thanks

dude, at least post your MMR üòÇ

Well... I watch Pro leagues for the strats. My bad

He alludes to you Americans being fat, that you drink an excessive amount of soda. 
---
Hence why you probably have a soda machine in your house. 
---
That would be my guess anyways.

It‚Äôs literally on the second worst shotgun in the game.
---
It would never in any world compete with his KIA.
---
Wait actually?

Bandit and J√§ger flashbacks
---
I'm retarded sorryüòÇüòÇ fixed it

&gt; Fucking dumb. Let's just turn the whole game into a meme ubi. Gj. Smh.
---
I wonder who said this?
---
SMG-11
---
Don‚Äôt know but like trading cards
---
 Nice :3
---
Nah dude. The shotgun is amazing
---
Shit happens. Went to itch my nose while looking in a window. Almost missed the last guy and it was such a great final kill cam to watch, I was the big potato.
---
Must be lower rank. That or Ubisoft added bots to the game.
---
They just jealous of you for getting an ace so they tk
---
That just gave me an idea for an operator.

Hey this is beautiful! Is your other stuff linked somewhere? I'd love to follow you!

Not in my experience, would be fairly easy to test? Clip an uncontrolled spray at wall in Thunt and in custom/online and there you go? I could check tomorrow
---
On the one hand, for console playerbase to swell like that and be able to play with each other it's great.  On the other hand, playing against people with M+K (Legit this time) in a game with 1 shot headshots and no aim assist.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
oof
---
To an extent I think that you should be able to rule out maps that you dont want to play like how you can rule out different types of objectives
---
Ex. If you dont wanna play tower, you can just select it in settings and then you wont get loaded into games that picked that map
---
Ps I am aware that this might slow down the game finding speed but it's still your choice and no matter what you do with this idea, there's gonna be some negatives.
---
I‚Äôll try and test it , thanks for simple ‚Äúsolution‚Äù
---
Console players on modern warfare are doing fine.
---
Delete this
---
Yep
---
Sometimes it's just a 3k though :/
---
Yeah, weird. I looked over it and the trap was taken from inventory. So it should have been on the door
---
Because it‚Äôs casual, that‚Äôs why. Casual will always be the most toxic playlist to play in this game because winning and losing doesn‚Äôt mean anything so people feel like they can be shitty people for the sake of stupid shit.
---
Let me know, would be quite weird if it is!
---
For sure
---
all of them.
---
You may wanna use headphones

 I got hit at lest 7
---
This is really well done! I hose you consider doing more like this because this is great stuff.
---
Good joke?
---
Cubert from pixels wreck it Ralph and the game
---
its decent for learning maps and headshot training on normal but yeah still not as much of a challenge. I miss playing realistic in matchmaking but back when I did it was still 20 minute searches and now it seems like I can't even find a match to begin with.

The newcomer playlist would like a word with you.

Because this is swiggty buff

For some reason my game runs worse on low :(

Both are terrible if you want to avoid large amounts of toxicity.

How does your reticle so small? Just curious

Personally, I am from canada and all I have to say is.... FUCK YEAH TAKE NOTES UBISOFT

I don't think that'll stop them.

You get terrorists stuck behind walls. I get them fucking shooting me through walls. In the words on smash bros ref "GAAAAYME"

Sarcasm bud
---
Looks like a fun first game
---
Pulse bans makes a lot of sense for top floor attacks and objs. Kafe for example has a lot of wooden floors with room for pulse to move around on the second floor. 
---
Gridlock is a bit of a wildcard ban because its normally nomad since not a lot of gridlock players on ranked.
---
Bandit ban is to counter the thatcher ban
---
No you won't
---
I disagree, not many console players use ela for her smg given that the recoil is so uncontrollable. Her shotgun is pretty amazing though, alot better than the other weapons that received birthday skins.
---
ok

You mind if I ask who that was? I completely forgot to ask before xD

Not in the near future, it requires them to change alot of the hefty ground work laid out. It's not as simple as you would think.
---
Thanks for your feedback! Unfortunately, I think this issue (if it is a widespread issue and not my PC f*cking up) would not concern consoles bcz they seem to optimize their games way better on consoles than on PC

KapkAHHHHHHn

Cam was on glass, smoke destroyed the glass it was on.

ACOG/reflex, flash hider, vertical grip on LMG. I switch ACOG for a reflex in close-range maps like Oregon or Skyscraper.
---
On PMM I run suppressor for taking out cams, and laser sight for hipfire accuracy since if I had to switch off a 100 round mag LMG to keep firing, I most likely don't have time to aim down sights.

What lmao?

Deem it the PP Roni, big dick pasta energy
---
Yes
---
I actually got this skin just a few days ago, I think it looks really good!
---
If you play her a good amount then the recoil is no problem. Acog still is great cuz I can use it in close range and when out of candelas i could still play with range as well
---
Oi, finna yoink. Ty m8
---
"first time"
---
This is your smurf account. Stop playin
---
True but im a kapkan main so.... ubi can i have a nitro and a shield at the same time
---
Prepare for this meme to be thanos snapped by the mods....F
---
Firstly who uses a pump semis are much more fun and secondly that is not how the pistol recoil would work the slide moves the length of the case of the bullet not enough to pump a shotgun
---
Op icons make a rainbow
---
Ok
---
The cam was on a glass pane that got broken by the canister btw
---
Yeah, I just remember that stuff that‚Äôs all
---
LOL love this game
---
You know, I‚Äôm a warden main but I still play other ops. Maining an op doesn‚Äôt mean you should only play that specific one.
---
Ight then thx for at least talking your time to check this meme out
---
Well yes, but actually no. I Most likely believe he aint in champion nor in the deep copper iv wich are the most scare ranks meaning he wont have much impact in blacklist. If it did increase the time to find a game there should be a linut how many you can blacklist or just time how kong player is blacklisted, like 2 days before unlisting
---
True i have echo as secondary main
---
I have a smurf so i can play with my friends, they dont enjoy Playing against high ranked players and i get that.
---
Glasses in the basket
---
I mean, as much as I hate echo it‚Äôs still probably a good thing. The game can get boring fairly quick with a small variety of ops that you play.
---
Hell yeah
---
Not like he really uses them anyways
---
Honestly couldn‚Äôt tell ya why Jackal popped up as a problem all of a sudden, but I‚Äôve personally always thought F2 was busted. It‚Äôs just that there was always a much better gun in the R4C ACOG.
---
you do realize that teamkiller in this game is far less than good players right?
---
Meh plus im really good with echo and kapkan 
---
I use kapkan to roam and then push and with echo im really good at clutching
---
THX
---
So does EU , BDS , Forze are so strong
---
Well, they both have good guns, gadgets and speed/armour that fits their playstyle and useful secondary gadgets so I can see why people enjoy them. In fact I used to consider myself a Kapkan main and even bought the elite.

I know it won‚Äôt affect queue times if u ban like 5 ppl, i‚Äôm saying over time you‚Äôll ban more and more and see the times go up.

- If available, op BD dogtags or chibis on the respectible op.

- The six collection hibana on... hibana.

You should use what you prefer, I started using the P90 and MP5 when I started maining Rookie the Cookie and I prefer the P90 when anchoring and the MP5 when I roam/spawn peek but I use the P90 for that aswell

Why is the china version of Ela's icon on it?

Yeah lions. But im looking more for the specific style he has in game. Can't seem to find one that's close to it.

Except only unfunny shitposts get upvotes here

Thats some next level bullshit... maybe he lost his brain on the way to lvl 217 lmaooo

So while I do agree, my positioning left me vulnerable, that doesn‚Äôt dismiss the fact that buck gets sucked behind the wall by the ghostbusters continuing to land shots and kill me.

How did this happen? Any context?

the best is they rework the rework hereford to have the old hereford skin, and they get rid of this rain, sunshine is more beautiful

Aight appreciate the help.
---
This... seems like a flex
---
Nah that‚Äôs his lil bro
---
Correct
---
Am I not correct in thinking that it's still impossible to lean without ADS in console even with MnK, pretty sure the game doesn't allow for it as it's not in its code or some shit like that?
---
Picky? It's just people getting bored of a skin and wanting to switch it.
---
Needs seran wrap on the visor and it's 10/10
---
New bandit nerf changed to 4 armor 0.5 speed
---
The worst part about this is that it's on Facebook and someone, somewhere is gonna use that pic unironically
---
It‚Äôs got a solid fire rate and could definitely get a small damage buff. It also boasts a large magazine and predictably vertical recoil. 
---
I‚Äôd rather an operator be strong because of their gadget over their weaponry, especially as a 1 speed. This is all my opinion and I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm any more right than you are but I just prefer to be strong due to utility over weaponry. This is siege not COD
---
Nut milk

I wouldn‚Äôt say they would be too strong with simple gadget buffs. But that‚Äôs just me

I personally would take clockspeed over a lot of core's. Some CPU's have alot of cores but dont have the highest clockspeed . If you find a CPU with a lot of core's with the same clockspeed as a version with less core's. I would take that.

---
I mean have you ever tried running with one?
---
By teasing the enemy, you mean teamkilling your teammate and throwing the round for no reason at all and ruining the experience of the event?
---
These perks wouldn't be as significant as explosive damage reduction it would only be something like place gadget faster than normal. (stage 1: - 12% time, 2: - 16%, 3: - 20%) only rook would gain dmg reduction but max would be 9%

Ah yes enslaved goose

SEGWAY MOUNTED AND LOADED

Wow this looks amazing. Good for you

Not true you need full seal. Wear goggles underneath

No, because it doesn‚Äôt have an ACOG

It‚Äôs the ACOG that sells it for me, I really like Kapkan and I do quite well with him but I struggle a lot compared to Rook/Doc because he doesn‚Äôt have an ACOG sight.

When you spend the majority of the match anchoring obj and holding an angle, ACOG &gt; No ACOG

But they have Thanksgiving stuff then they have to make a map in a month along with the packs
---
Rook‚Äôs utility in my opinion still won‚Äôt be strong enough to support him, his primary gadget is useless if you end up alone.
---
I always play semi-defensively, even on Attack. Rook is in a good place because he has good weapons and has a primary gadget that supports the rest of the team
---
Changing his weapons in favour of better utility will certainly change the meta but in my opinion the Rook Plates aren‚Äôt effective enough to warrant him being on the team if his guns are poor.

Peace was never an option, the duck says to multiple special operations units with fully loaded assault rifles.

yes i know but still who says it isn't used to scale the private section, huh? lol
---
Commissioner warden
---
But you making by ok? Eating well, drinking water, doin them breathing exercises?
---
They all have always had a low winrate and pickrate
---
Nothing you can do, what do you want us to say?
---
I like it. As LordFrieza8789 said, I like the more practical gadgets like this.
---
I think almost every member of Rainbow has visible abs as they are supposed to be in a very fit shape. Except for Gridlock.
---
I want this to be a actual game
---
How do?
---
Oh okay, so copper then
---
Im totally fine , let's say the food is kinda bad but u gotta eat so u do that , water yeah ofc drinking about 4 liters a day , well about breathing exercises well sometimes a man gotta chill but that gonna be in rainbow at home with his family.
---
So lucky, can shoot all the defenders and get challenge progress
---

?
---
I like it. But if it‚Äôs like maverick, wouldn‚Äôt it be to slow? You could never close a whole breach hole in time. Also there are probably people waiting for you at those holes.
---
He also doesn't wrap the shirt in gift paper, but just gives it in the plastic bag of the Walmart he bought it at
---
That's definitely why you don't see many.
---
The higher ranks you definitely see people using them a lot more
---
Blitz, fuze and montange are all attackers
---
She already really strong and shouldn‚Äôt be able to pick herself up
---
Ooooo my freeeecking god, i know,i frecking know, but there are bosses over the game who could say "lets focus on fixing bugs" but they dont! This is my frecking point, what is so god damn hard to understand?!
---
Endothermic is when Thermite gets bandit tricked.
---
He gets really hot inside.
---
that's why he's difficulty-- oh fuck I meant to make him difficulty 3
---
??
---
It feels like ma boy Maestro is always in the middle of these lines everytime I see them.
---
Trade you for my MP5 duplicate. I want the R4C one so bad.
---
How am I whining? I am stating facts. I‚Äôm talking about his weapon, I don‚Äôt really care about the gender of the operator.
---
I just got this last night too, the disappointment is real
---
this is why i stopped playing i went from 8hrs+ a day playing to less then 3hrs a week, matchmaking into already losing games is a joke. i have a job that is 24/7 if needed and i cant just join ranked games all day just to quit and get banned and leave my team down a man i just cant do that to them .
---
Id love to
---
Ubi tried to make Warden a Jager alternative and he still sucks (even though he‚Äôs so easy to fix), so I wonder how this new defender will be. I also wonder if they‚Äôll get an ACOG because Warden didn‚Äôt have an ACOG when he was 1 speed.
---
Yes it sure is
---
we hear ya i spent about that on ps4 , i burns but you will get over it , maybe....
---
Wow great another useless horrible charm
---
I have super rare charms and skins as well as PL sets :(

^^^^[hint](https://cryptii.com/pipes/text-decimal)
---
I‚Äôve only gotten the worst legendaries so far
---
Tachanka hesdgear, Lovelace for f2, baroque flair for alibi, lesion headgear, silenced six12 skin, etc. 
---
Only decent one is distinguished tangashima or whatever
---
cant believe the last two didnt pre-fire your ass haha
---
#lord tachanka
---
When the round is over you'll see the round ending kill or defuse, etc. At that point your kill cam wouldn't matter.
---
You're missing the guns.  Also, you're missing a gun.
---
Fragda Magda
---
So... Thank you for your service?!
---
Are those abs I see?
---
I think the defenders gadget absorbs a grenade and then when an attacker gets close it activates it stunning/exploding them like a combo Jager/Mozzie mix.
---
Happy that you like it!
---
I love how the helmet bends outwards from both sides it makes me giggle
---
Look him up.
---
I don't know, I don't like this idea, it may be because I've internalised that once you do a kill you must move to avoid being spotted, but I don't think it would be so useful. Also, when they put in pick and ban for a brief period as a discovery mode they turn off the killcam and it was madness.
---
We will see in pro league
---
What if I told you Twitch viewership doesn‚Äôt always correlate with player counts?
---
R6, Madden and Hearthstone are great examples of games with low viewership compared their massive player counts.
---
I was thinking about that. My first idea was not to show the kill cam. However, if the kill cam doesn't appear, this would open opportunities for hackers and stuff, don't you think?
---
Put a smoke lens from a dye mask in there
---
Every time my team starts a vote kick on me, while I'm last one alive, I love to either straight up leave (if on defend) or clutch post plant (on attack) and leave without defusing. Just to give them the taste of almost winning a round and then being butt fucked.
---
He‚Äôs a stoner don‚Äôt waste your time with him
---
In Russia, sausage eats YOU
---
because accuracy with that pistol would be crap
---
Good india number one
---
Worse, you dont get the characters lol i just bought a pc and dont have all the characters
---
Yeah I know. Still pretty cool.
---
To be fair they smushed together assault and engineer in BF1 and BFV, didn‚Äôt they?
---
Thicklock
---
Well past time for Rainbow Seven Siege
---
Wow I saw you said that‚Äôs like your best friend but I‚Äôd HAVE to stop playing with him after this
---
How to get free karma;
---
Simply cut the white out of any of the 50 icons (more icons, more karma.) Use a brush with a glow effect on a second layer. Make three brushstrokes. Done...
---
Not this shit again.
---
I hope not, because then what's the point of bringing hibana or thermite if some operators can have their unique gadget + the ability to make the hard breachers redundant? But then again, making sight lines is what Maverick does, so I guess we'll see what comes of this.
---
smug ella best ella
---
Speak for yourself
---
I don't know if it's possible to do that but I've downloaded R6 from Steam and at the first run uPlay asked me to make a new account specific for uPlay.
---
He‚Äôs asking ‚Äúwhy are they all..?‚Äù
---
This year I did Cav and buck from u/SAU-SIEGE comics! I got the suggestion to do both last year when I posted.
---
"Destroy 20 attacker drones"
---
Cries in Mozzie
---
I never watched Twitch in my life, but I play Rainbow almost daily.
---
Has your day been good :)
---
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean. You deal the enemy 100 hp more than his. And he is not getting downed because you headshot him.
---
Thank you very much
---
&gt;but they will need a huge boost of content to justify a new game. 
---
Not necessary new content (in the sense of the number of maps, operator and so on), but new possibilities.
---
Imagine a version of Siege where fire and smoke would propagate realistically, where you could turn down the power, flood areas...
---
The art style is a reference to untitled goose game. So is the title
---
Stop witch-hunting and you obviously don‚Äôt know how ddosing works
---
Nice work on keeping it up
---
Castle barricades can only be broken by hitting, I think that would be a good alternative, you could then leave holes to make it harder for the attackers to run up and hit it
---
Oh no, this reminds me of a dream I had
---
My mate literally messaged me on snap, that was in the party with us, telling me he was trying to ddos me
---
sorry to tell u but ur post might get taken down bc of whitch hunting
---
This is a solid idea and it reuses a gun which isn't so popular which would maybe gain popularity
---
used to be the same but people raged about it being too little variation
---
yeah, maybe
---
But a really well thought out op, I would like to see some sort of post breach denial
---
i got the garbage lesion headgear
---
I think I need some context.
---
I don't know how to phrase my question aside from "Why are all of the "operators" anime cosplays or tumblr fan art?"
---
Any elaboration on my part requires knowledge of the subject matter, and I'm honestly stumped as to what exactly the original question means.
---
So my question to OP is, **What makes you think** are all of the "operators" anime cosplays or tumblr fan art?
---
Vigil: Am I a joke to you?
---
Can we all just agree that frost needs a portibile javalan. I run out side place a Matt, Silver player walks into it. Precedes to get hit from raining death from above.
---
I'm trying to make all my season ideas have 2 reused weapon, 2 new primaries and 1 new secondary
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ exactly it‚Äôs supposed to be a challenge. Get a 5 stack and stop complaining
---
Yes!I am happy that the ARainbowLife comics has gotten such a great welcome!
---
I hope your day has been good too!
---
Then they were just trolling if they we gonna ddos they would of got his IP from joining the party
---
Okay but I don‚Äôt have anyone to play with the pony is why am I getting g a team of low gold and low silver when they get highway gold low plat and a silver
---
Nice comic
---
Not another boring Dokkaebi art piece to take my upvote!
---
I think his tool would need to have a much further range than Mav‚Äôs torch then. Having to foam both sides of a Thermite or Hibana hole, with the same proximity required to use Mav‚Äôs torch, is precisely the problem. With almost all the sites I can think of, his ability would be useless simply from attackers holding an angle after wall breaching. Having to cross that gap at all would be too risky.
---
Sorry, am not trying to be negative. I like the idea of a foam to cover breach holes, drone holes etc...I‚Äôm just having a hard time seeing how a Mav-torch-style applicator could be feasible. Maybe I‚Äôm still missing something.
---
Makes sense. i'll definitely be practicing that. Thanks!
---
Do you happen to know if Castle's reinforced barricades can be shocked too?
---
but literally impossible to acquire in a video game now
---
Yh, the key thing to remember is just experiment with your play style and the different operators.  Look up tactics on YouTube or watch streamers on twitch.  Do the situations and terrorist hunt for practice.
---
I really like the effort you put into these. The AK5 converted to 9 mm is cleaver.
---
Heroes never die!
---
Oh wait, wrong game
---
Your stats are wack. It's like you got boosted or something. I've seen nothing like this before.
---
Yeah and then when you go and thermite a wall and it gets instantly closed up the minute you open it thats when it would be stupid to have it instantly
---
Soo thats actually my group dude, just sent u a friend request so u can find ur love again. Much love
---
Mr Sack Ball incoming
---
Yes unless it‚Äôs blatant. Like last night, when another friend asked the squad who wants to touch my face, he was halloween smoke,  ‚Äúno game sense friend‚Äù said he would and smoke shot him in the face.
---
That's because you GIVE people viruses
---
And yes this is also a joke
---
For 100k renown you can get a diamond universal camo
---
Oof I thought it was just because he couldn't because he was like in year 8
---
Ever had N√∏kk right in your face while watching cams? That there is scary.
---
for you, maybe
---
to me, they are beautiful
---
i have the same problem it all started after the Halloween update
---
Thank you!
---
screw #BOSGACOG, we need #AUGACOG
---
I do agree with this but with its high damage it will be able to kill a 1 or 2 armor operator under 10 meters in three shots max
---
I love the artstyle
---
FOR HONOR
---
Your bullets don‚Äôt drop and they shoot from your scope
---
Do like COD MW did..
---
I thought it was ash lmao
---
I'm sorry im new to the game is that operator nokk?
---
you cant bhop :(
---
They will.
---
Honestly this guy just seems like a troll wasting time
---
Wow if u can dm me one of his stories I would love to hear them!
---
I‚Äôm not sure weather or not to laugh or write a paragraph on how this is fucked up so I‚Äôm just gon give you an updoot and leave it at that
---
This is dope
---
Also would give new players with no op to play a reason to expiriment with what they use
---
Boomer
---
A blessed image
---
will i be able to get a stream charm from it?
---
This is good :) 
---
I need to ask, when is the halloween event going to be a game with nothing but Caviera? :) 10 Caviera's, dark building .... She has scared me in normal games plenty of times haha
---
i'm all for PS4-xbone crossplay, but not with PC
---
Same. Almost smashed my controller when I hit 97
---
That‚Äôs how I viewed it. Saw it on another sub and found it funny because my friend loves alcohol and is a Jager main.
---
Can you share it?
---
The Ella Halloween skin looks so bad but everyone other skin looks sick.
---
Gorgeous, I have a girl and she‚Äôs the nicest little cat
---
Give me a bolt action with a holo and I'll be happy to go inside the building. I played COD2 rifles only for years so I'm a little bias.
---
I like it. I think the foam needs to spray out relatively fast. Like fill up a Thermite hole in the same time it takes to put up a castle wall.
---
You‚Äôre not that much of a cunt if your friends are ok with it. But you are if they don‚Äôt want you to. I‚Äôve broken contact with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that TK‚Äôd me on purpose after I asked them not to.
---
All right I‚Äôll give you that because I never heard of this. 
---
In most case you shouldn‚Äôt survive a headshot.
---
They really are. My one is only just a year old as well so super playful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Idk they said they are looking at switching nokks load out and I really hope that doesn‚Äôt mean getting rid of the deadly a primary switch would be fine
---
now that's a cunt if i've ever seen one
---
I think they do
---
Commando 9 is a real colt635 SMG designed for 9mm.
---
It would be cool. But they‚Äôd need to have each voice actor come in again, and if they change the game or rework stuff they‚Äôd need to bring in the voice actors again for the little stuff. Instead they have one guy who does it all instead of all goodness‚Äôs know how many
---
Gotta love that game
---
Time to get serious. {-}7
---
My Maine coon is 2 bit lazy but loves cuddles. I have a Bengal too and he‚Äôs playful
---
I need friends to play it with, so stressful playing alone lol
---
Yep, Red Dot is actually better over reflex in this particular example, but in the end, it's still a matter of preference. I'm using Red Dot only on this gun and it works really well for me, hence I recommend it. Red Dot works really well on guns that have below average rate of fire like ump45, give it a try.
---
If the sniper would work exactly like awp on CS:GO, I fail to see how the operator is even remotely balanced. I'd be really pissed off if they scrapped the bolt action rifle tho. Let us hope they find a good way to balance the operator.
---
We can pretend there‚Äôs something there
---
Why do you need to give new ops a ‚Äúreason to experiment‚Äù with cosmetics? New players should  be only focused on learning maps and earning more operators, not cosmetics or recruit
---
Genuine question: why develop new content for the game if there are engine limitations?
---
It just bothers me from when the fortnite fanbase had a "only OGs this and this " era as well as complained to the devs about how "OGs should get this treatment".  The thing was whenever this era happened the game was only a few months old so I don't understand why people were calling themselves OGs.
---
Could the legends be true?
---
Look at glaz, they go back and forth between broken and trash. A sniper simply doesn‚Äôt fit in siege.
---
My guy out here looking fresh
---
I dont get why he would want a 9x19 ak monstrosity. Just give him a real SMG instead of making shit up.
---
**Cosplay Comment Reminder:**
---
Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.
---
No. Playing recruit is throwing. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt really matter much in casual but Ubisoft should still avoid giving anyone a real reason to play recruit. 
---
IMO, Ubisoft should remove recruit completely for anyone but the newest Players
---
I know but the magwell looks too big for it, let's just say there's an adapter inside the ak5 magwell :shrug:
---
A kid at my high school wore a shirt that said ‚ÄúFree Hong Kong‚Äù on it
---
*it's a guy*
---
üòê
---
Boom goes the foam
---
If it wasn't Halloween I would have thought this was an April fool's joke.
---
Lmao the action figure
---
Pizza boi
---
Well I kinda deleted the game and requested a refund then bought it off steam
---
My Chemical Romance just announced a reunion I am no longer invested in this argument internet person! Today is a good Halloween!!
---
Can't wait to spawnpeek with Vigil.
---
That would be impossible. Grenades have a fuse.
---
This is awesome!  Happy Halloween :)
---
i‚Äôm good. red dot is definitely the worse sight imo takes up a lot of your screen and just looks disgusting honestly and reflex takes up the least of your screen and has a good sight, holo is also a good sight
---
It would be interesting to have a defender that used a camera on their person to see, lime that they are missing their eyes but they can see via a camera link into the brain. 
---
N√∏kk would be a hard counter against them.
---
Calm down there bud it was a joke
---
I like goyo alot
---
yes. I sprinted through it very carefully.
---
just no
---
I can't hear your tone of voice on the internet.
---
These are incredible!!!!!!
---
Yep, servers are broken it seems.
---
Plus Gubisoft has given China the finger before unlike Blizzard
---
The only missing thing is the actual uniform. Great work tho. But I'm too late... No nut November has come...
---
The face paint is really good
---
Hopefully they never do that again. The whole reason they have 3 week test servers is so the community can, ya know, test them. How OP was Warden that would make Ubi tone him down this much?
---
thanks for the feedback. The AR is based on a modernized version of a SIG 540, the SIG 540-1M that is curernctly in service in my country (refernce:  [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/SG-540-1M\_Famae\_Ejercito\_de\_Chile.JPG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/SG-540-1M_Famae_Ejercito_de_Chile.JPG) ). This is why the stock is there, and for the gadget, yes its like smoke, but with a combination with ela/echo debuff effect) also its on the attackers side. Because is you can also use a shield, you can offer to the team a very heavy push and/or an entry denial. The grenade acts like an impact nade so its quicker than any other area of effect in the current game and you can use while you are protected with the shield (if you like to play with a shield) so this one have different plays styles.
---
That has nothing to do w the community being toxic
---
She's 16...
---
Ya I know but you understand I was making a joke right
---
aint that camo kinda weird for a swede?
---
It could be very useful in some sites, but it kinda worries me if it would be too powerful with a Mira
---
Bruh, I'm 14, and I never think 'bout it
---
So, no credit to Pengu? He mentioned it on stream
---
Yes on my Twitter page @midiankai and on Instagram @ midiankai, Instagram is updated slower, also I have a merch shop, dm if interested
---
Cause they are AUTOMATIC weapons. The 3 speed added to it but they were AUTOMATICS which is why the AUTOMATICS were so strong with acog.
---
This is accurate representation of a life for a ranked player
---
You states?
---
You must not play casual, because imo like 2/5 vigils use it to meme
---
Thank you, It was exciting month!
---
Could be mistaken for hitler, lol
---
Nope
---
Middle east
---
Because "haha recruit pick so funi xDDD" is a dead meme that should stay dead.
---
Recruit is a pick for fresh new players whose only operator got picked, and isn't meant to be used in literally no other situation.
---
You guys rock!
---
check Blender guru¬¥s channel on youtube, he have pretty good tutorials
---
Legal age?
---
thats a meme/image macro whatever you want to call it
---
Nah, that ain't a toothbrush, that's a dirty Sanchez.
---
Why nerf and not a real one?
---
So capitao
---
18
---
I want a legit First Person Legacy perspective- And I don't want to pay for it to be a feature.
---
Middle right looks the best to me, they're all pretty good though.
---
Can someone explain the licensing thing to me for the guns in games?
---
No c√©u tem breach? 
---
E morreu
---
It would be perfect for a hard push but if you had a gun like Zofia, you could switch from a impact like gas that explodes on impact or in general vicinity of a defender but also something like an airjab that sticks to tee surface and detonates when someone walks through it. It would make holding an objective even better but the downside is that smoke and this op are immune to it cause they both could be using the same gas formula
---
STOP! You've violated the law pay the court a fine or serve your sentence your stolen goods are now forfeit.
---
A few reasons, [this probably being the biggest](https://www.reddit.com/user/LiberDBell/comments/dpu5wk/example/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).
---
As you can see, attackers can easily shoot it out from outside the building and then have angles in.
---
Even if you couldn't shoot it from there it's still a bad placement on fully reinforced walls regardless. Mira's are best used in spots where you can peek and kill people on the other side. Putting them in places like this does nothing more than giving the opponent an opportunity to open in with a Twitch drone or angle from above/below where they then get free angles through the reinforcement that they wouldn't have had if you didn't place it there.
---
I do now.
---
Who mentioned what?
---
It‚Äôs saids so somewhat in finka‚Äôs bio that she has drinks with him, if that‚Äôs not Russian of a date I don‚Äôt know what is
---
Ok have a great day :)
---
Maaaaybe...
---
I'm sorry to break it to ya buddy but I think there's plenty of people that play recruit because it's fun, I fancy myself as someone who does that, not because it's "the meme".  
---
And on your second point this has already been discussed
---
Lol it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs YouTube or not. You can‚Äôt steal someone else‚Äôs work and make money off it..
---
tbh you're taking this light-hearted comic a little too seriously
---
Good thing it's not twitch
---
I see
---
...
---
What am I charged for? I just gave u a suggestion!
---
Or is it No nut November?
---
(If it is, you will have to try making me pay with my blood)
---
They let you wear that? And bring a nerf gun? When I was in high school you couldn‚Äôt wear goggles or hoods or hats or anything, even on costume days
---
I've been suggesting this exact gadget since like season 3 year 1. Listen up, ubi!
---
Wow that‚Äôs really fuckin‚Äô sad lmao
---
I understand you but ADS speeds were never why the Red Dot wasnt used, if you want peripheral vision, use Reflex, normal sight,p Holo, zoom= ACOG. The sights are meant for holding angles
---
To burn chemicals need air it some other fuel. Just day it puts them in a vacuum

You had me at ‚Äúbolt action rifle.‚Äù I‚Äôve wanted an op with one of those since I started playing back in year 1. Now all I need is a dude with a sword and the game will be perfect.
---
Excuse me sir? Do you develop games for a living, specifically a game that has millions of players a day? Can you code not only mechanics but enviornments? Are you original enough to brainstorm operators that dont break your game on release? Or are you just an angry couch potato? Hush yourself and bye Felicia.
---
Hmmmm

They're available on my Etsy

---
Why is Battle for the Grid so highly rated and popular?
---
I dont get this assumption that all bolt actions are snipers.
---
We fought a world war using bolt actions, they sure as hell weren't all being used as sniper rifles.
---
Siege has a lot of problems, but that the trade of you get when you have a game as complex as siege
---
aight you convinced me
---
"Fradga" lol
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
True
---
Most of modern bolt action weapons are snipers.
---
Sure in both WW they used bolt action rifle that wasn‚Äôt meant for sniper used but they won‚Äôt add a old WW2 weapon, it will get outclassed by any other gun. 
---
Just imagine if one side during WW1 only had bolt action weapons and the other all automatic. The side with bolt action will get destroyed
---
Thank you she‚Äôs old but gold! Aha
---
I feel you on the high sensitivity, being able to swing around fast is key!
---
You were so good that they had to use divine powers to kill you.
---
Cav gets played a lot right? Right?
---
*Right?*
---
RIGHT! man I miss it.
---
I've honestly only ever had this problem once or twice, but it would be nice to adjust some of the brightness on them.
---
I've had my reflex blend in on old themepark before.
---
Yes, they're called trolls, throwers, griefers, inters, quite a wide range of vocabulary for people who enjoy ruining games for others.
---
They will never be a relevant group when it comes to taking community suggestions.
---
They did say engine limitations for now....
---
nah but somehow all he says gets put in the game
---
Welp lets see
---
I am not, you are right, except the devs who ARE doing those things are ass at it. Especially balance and content.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me before and I take it as a sign of respect
---
What?
---
720 noscope off clubhouse garage into garage
---
Smh bro really just put the same picture of warden twice and thought we wouldn‚Äôt notice
---
Based on pro league win rates the game is overall defense sided, but I agree with everything else you've said.
---

THE FOAM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO REINFORCE THE FLOOR

I am aware of this, why do u think I said they‚Äôd run back to their zim(an adapter that emulates controller for their KBM).  
---
I thought we were talking about console supporting native MnK, which would then cross platform queue with PC.  Those players would then run back to their emulators, because they‚Äôd be getting slammed by PC players.
---
Ahhh yes drone out the instant spawn peek, sorry I‚Äôm just a copper 4 player
---
We've waited too damn long!
---
Oh god what have you done to my baby
---
Oof. I hope its cause you can memorise the layout.
---
How much did it cost
---
The only thing worse is dying 3 times at different spawns
---
What a chad, literal girl magnet
---
I guess that helps too
---
Plenty more where that comes from, also, you are free to sue whatever attachments you so desire but might I recommend using the flash hider on J√§ger‚Äôs rifle? The extended barrel provides very little benefit compared to the other choices. Unless it‚Äôs someone like frost who only has that and a suppressor as an option then I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the extended barrel on anybody. But again, you are free to use whatever you want so good luck out there.
---
Oh, because I couldn‚Äôt pull off the 1v5? Sorry, next time I‚Äôll try dying at the beginning of the round like the rest of you.
---
It‚Äôs pretty cheap, there are a LOT of stars after all. Although these companies that let you name a star are almost all bullshit since there is no way to make any actual space agencies recognise your stars name
---
Also an alpha pack for not dying in the first 20 seconds
---
Is this Disneyland?

Touche

I have revealed it‚Äôs true form

Make the playlist house and plane only

Yup, Power Rangers was probably on a charity stream so it was propped up. R6S viewership is down by almost a third to half depending on time of day as some Siege streamers are playing it, and the general excitement of a new game in the same genre. I apologize to everyone I didn't think that it was so obscure that people wouldn't be able to make the connection.
---
Btw muzzle on zofia is also very popular with pros
---
Escape from tarkov has one because they just don‚Äôt give a fuck
---
Ruin has come to our family

Since when could you buy a mother fucking star

Dont forget to put the gun inside the battery to be able to shoot out of it

Hey u/Dallashh here‚Äôs the pic
---
I want that charm!
---
There‚Äôs cav nokk and that damned four speed ash
---
Perhaps, but remember, it‚Äôs personal preference, and we‚Äôre not professionals
---
Hahahaha fuck off 
---
Love your vids btw
---
The game is getting itself as close as it can to real life circumstances.
---
They are not going to change something that literally makes the game more realistic.
---
Lookin like peashooter from PvZ
---
I have the same gun
---
Nah bruh.
---
Nope!
---
By the time I uploaded this post I was Voted out of a match 5 times in a Row not even kidding. 99% of it's use is for toxic reasons idk why it's still in the game.
---
Mad lad
---
Idk it feels like the comic is taking to a child when it does stuff like that? I mean it is going for like a cute childish look ig so fair enough
---
Sledge maybe, his primary isnt super fast but the smg 11 seconddary definitely is and its fun to break down every soft wall on the map rushing is super fun with him
---
Hasn‚Äôt he been nerfed where they don‚Äôt do damage when stepped on?
---
It seems to happen a lot when joining a game in progress, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs just toxicity or they don‚Äôt want to wait for you to load in for another minute
---
Yeah, like I said attacking is inherently less comfortable. Defense knows what‚Äôs coming most of the time and are well prepared. That‚Äôs why attackers have assault rifles and defenders have mostly smgs, in part to balance the natural advantage that comes with defending. 
---
Maps like coastline are practically 50-50 split because of the random nature and balanced meta of the map. In Penthouse/Theater alone there‚Äôs 20 different ways to attack that site. Attack VIP from outside or through hookah pushing and take control of 90+VIP, push Aquarium and open Theater which also requires taking 90, play below and open the whole site, play big double window on Penthouse, play bathroom hatch, play Hall of Fame from outside or stemming from VIP control. Defenders still even it out.
---
But we should strive to emulate the gameplay and choices of pros, given how much time and motivation they have to win
---
Haha idk if u were referencing somethin or not
---
If they‚Äôre hacking true
---
Some aliens pissed rn
