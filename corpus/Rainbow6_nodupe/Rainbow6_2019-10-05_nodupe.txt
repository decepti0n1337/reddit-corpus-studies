Filmed vertically bruh

No, someone posted a video of them making one and they just slapped a filter on it. Took 5 seconds flat. Exact same outcome.
---
Finally someone gets it

Yeah I can't wait for Quarantine next year and you should check it out you'll probably like it, it's probably gonna be a continuation of outbreak with a new story.
---
If you have good aim then doing this unironically actually works much more than you would expect (at low plat)
---
I'm fully aware of that.

Metal Gear is a Kojima game, but nobody in their right mind would say that Survive is a Kojima production. It's the scraps of something great reassembled for a cash grab.
---
Same deal with Ubi.
---
It’s a headshot machine now
---
I saw the quarantine trailer it did lool amazing not sure it requires a whole new game they nailed it with the modes, but im not going to complain
---
Oh
---
From where you're kneeling, this must seem like an 18 carat run of bad luck.. Truth is: the game was rigged from the start.
---
I never see anyone complaining about the vector
---
This entire subreddit is art spam like that.
---
He links his deviantart in a comment
---
Edit: and plugs his instagram in another one
---
If it’s 1v1 and your opponent manages to have enough time to get on top of the cabinet and plant while you are still doing who knows what on the other site (which is literally just on the other side of a soft wall with a door right in the middle) then that is entirely your fault.
---
Unless you somehow manage to get in a situation where you are busy fighting someone and for some reason completely go deaf and not hear the defuser being planted then you should probably just break the computer where the vault is and save yourself the stress.

This is gold

Gold now :P

No, they made Ubisoft games, with his name.

Definitely lesion. Then ying. Then cav.
---
Its not karma farming, hes plugging insta and and youtube, its total self promotion and should straight up be banned off the sub /u/Deosl
---
I think that the recoil is very manageable, I have gotten cross maps without much of a problem.
---
Total BS.
---
#WHAT IN THE GOD DAM
---
Tbh lately i heard so many complain about it, since they released Goyo's vector
---
Lol I was dying it was hilarious
---
I have all the ops
---
I completely agree with you, the vault isn’t even 100% guaranteed to work first try and the time you spend on that+the time you take to plant is more than enough to move through literally one door and stop you.
---
Just destroy the computer if it really causes that much trouble right?
---
For next season
---
you're kinda slow on the screen opening for a Plat 2
---
Looks kind of shitty tbh.
---
Definitely!
---
Well no dur I make 100k a season
---
Yep just came here from there. This sub is a fucking joke sometimes.
---
Exactly, didn't buy Goyo yet so i am not sure if there's a big difference or is it the same?
---
they can't see you but you can see them

Wait really? Since when?

Suka blyat! Don't tell me what to do, blyat!

Yeh I saw it, I don't do it like that

Her eyes need some work but nice shading

Alright

We've been tricked, we've been backstabbed and we've been quite possibly, bamboozled.

It's cool, but why are the eyes so realistic looking?
---
It feels like she's staring through my very soul
---
exactly what i was thinking like the rest is good but the eyes look real

yea ik,,, i can’t really draw eyes but thank you for the critique!! i’ll make sure to fix it next time. :’)

Never tried it but you could probably cut the last frame of the time code adjustment layer, right click on it and chose the 'Add frame hold' options. Just guessing, not near my PC to check
---
Do you fix your own car? Paint your own house? Ever remodeled a shower? Or re-done a roof?  How about replace a window?  Just because someone CAN learn, doesn’t mean they have the time. I do a lot of things for myself, but sometimes I have more money than time and I want to ensure it is done correctly.

I'm looking at both the photoshopped fuze icon and your fuze icon and they're completely different. Sucks it's easier to hop onto a stupid bandwagon instead of doing some research.

I thought she'd be a really good rusher. Like ash, but worse, because the grappling hook could help you rush faster. Not that she isn't; she's just not as bad as I expected.

wow this filter IS nice

really? maybe if you seed it up
---
Yeah, I'm there a lot actually.  Problem is two-fold, though.  1 is that there are way less active users on that sub and 2 is that discussion is limited to strategies and nothing else.

fuck you too

Probably took more time than the logos tbh.

Yes. This is good.

u sure mate?

Wow

No the entirety of  Xbox servers are empty but you. We’ve been waiting for your call to battle for a while now.

I see your point. I guess I should’ve said I have no interest in learning photoshop. It wouldn’t help me in the field of work I’m in. I don’t really have time to use it anyway.
---
For those who liked any of those post you’ve been bamboozled.

do your fucking research next time bud!

I thought the exact same thing

lol

Honestly this is my new favorite too

ok but that's MW you sound stupid lmao

That's cool too. I just love pointing out that we have the luxury of learning anything we want to learn these days it's awesome

It's more than less a lie, people don't like being lied to.

Congratulations, u did it the right way. Now let’s see the proof for ALL of them.
---
**INCREDIBILIS!!**
---
Crazy how a place like a oil change shop works like that huh?
---
I get that but generally isn’t it almost identical? And it does look glower then the filter but like is anything else different. Like maybe the color scheme?
---
fine dude here's the proof that I DON't use a filter
---
If you're reading out the letters as if it were an initialism, then it'd be 'an'. If it were just pronounced like 'fell' tyen it would be 'a'

It's the law

just measure. move your operator 180/360 and measure
---
Too late to take back my boner I might as well still live up to it
---
Well, it would be better if you actually paid somebody who's not trying to kind of scam you. I mean, if you want money for basically no work, at least be open and honest about it.
---
Also, can't you just screenshot them?
---
This is some simple 90s photoshop shit too.
---
Not really... I mean, I see your point, I'm a graphic designer myself, but some people just don't want to go trough the hassle of downloading Photoshop which could be an original trial that will delete itself after 30 Days or it could be a pirated copy downloaded god knows from where and that would require you to triple check for viruses and what not. Then you'd need to check a tutorial on how to create this exact same result, since people who don't know this is Photoshop has no idea such a filter exists. And then, apply it themselves. For someone who knows, this can easily be done in less than a minute, but for a clueless person, it could take more than an hour, installation, tutorial searching and application considered.
---
For us sure, downloading PS isn't a hard task, but I'm 100℅ sure anyone else in my family would end up downloading 20 viruses in just the first step.
---
Some people would rather just pay a couple of bucks to have someone do it for them.
---
Now everyone's. Gonna be a lesion main muhahahahahaha

I would argue Frost is a better trap op.. But how about we root for Frost x Ela and call it a day?

No point in buying skins in rainbow six siege when you can only see your gun and only after the game if you win. But I see your point.

Your Fuzes look EXACTLY the same LMAO
---
Oh shit instant downvote
---
100% agree with this. people being retards and needlessly shitting on some dude. Wether its low effort or not (which it definitely isnt, learn something about photoshop people), thats not the point, the guy took the fucking time of day to do something he thought was cool and post it to reddit, Dont be assholes, its not “karma-whoring” and why the fuck do these neckbeards care so much about internet points anyway, its fucking stupid.
---
It’s even better now, since untitled goose game is out

OMG THIS NEEDS TO BE MADE

i was waiting for someone to run out on u lmfao

I really don’t know why you didn’t

I like how op deleted account lol

Learning how to put a filter on photoshop is just one thing. You cant just pop onto photoshop and click the "apply that one filter i saw on reddit" button. Some level of knowledge of the UI and functions of the program are prerequisite, and that takes at least some time to learn.
---
Always improving I'll try to find a way to make it better but I'm working on more Spooky Operator Logos Who Should I do next?

But the squad could consist of alt accounts smurfing
---
But im broke, and if i could buy any of these i would just buy Maverick

About 8-9 yr old
---
#Ping in bottom left cant show 5th digit, I see its trying. Nearly 43k
---
Nope. NE PA
---
Good
---
Shotgun is just so much more fun to use absolutely shreds people
---
Theres a 5th digit there. Thats nearly 43k

You should give this to your crush.

What other things? You only got the lava skin if you pre-ordered the season pass (think there's a skin for every season).
---
What about blitz

Because balancing?

Rainbow is our since 2015, that makes you 13 years old at its best. You should not be playing this game at all.

Alright.Explain please,because my brain loses more cells every second.

Ah I'm sorry, didn't realize you were a big strong with big strong muscles and a big, **big** dick who is so cool he doesn't need help *ever*. Had I realized who I was talking to I probably would have been *far* too scared to ever suggest that you don't be a huge asshole for no reason. I'm so sorry, just *please* don't hurt me
---
Is that better? You're overcompensation is showing a little
---
May I offer some honest feedback?
---
Oh I see, thank you
---
Did you reboot the game?
---
Being real, guy on the right probably was really trying. Some of the stuff isn't just completely traced. It isn't a filter. Some people use the stupid fucking filter so shit on them, don't make a guy delete his account because he wants to make something
---
Yes
---
Are you good at staying alive through the round? Are you usually the last one alive? Then echo. If you have good map knowledge and usually make plays that get you killed go frost

Advance deployment
---
Clash is a tremendous threat if the Clash player knows how to quickly switch into his secondary and headshot you immediately, toying people like a fool, OR coordination with his teammates makes her so impacting. I've met these types of players before, and it's worth remain cautious when facing Clash, unless she's all alone.
---
Maybe try switching servers, just to test it?
---
Take a break. Play something else. Come back in a week. Works every time.
---
If you can control the recoil , they are both really good weapons
---
Thats not a good argument, or at least it doesnt cover all reasons why someone would buy the icon. What if someone is morally opposed to pirating? Then its just objectively cheaper to just buy the icon.
---
Yikes

Wait oh fuck, don't say his na-
---
Uhh no I usually die off the first one
---
Elite Mira is best rainbow girl
---
Buck is cheaper than mav

So said ‘squad’ could have a friend or two on alt accounts (alternate accounts) which means they have stats they don’t care about, will just leave when they’re losing so the other people don’t lose as much elo

If you’re in America don’t let your dreams be dreams

I already have buck, sorry i forgot to mention that.

Might want to introduce her to CS:GO
---
I don't get you. It's very obvious that the two icons are objectively different. You just did not think critically for yourself and obviously hopped on the hate bandwagon. Now you realize your mistake and are trying to insult me to change the topic.
---
Well they make it to the front page because people like them enough to. So maybe just cause some people don't like it, doesn't mean that the majority dislikes it.
---
It was for surrendering not kicking
---
I doubt she'll see much use in pro league so...... I asked pengu and he said she won't be used in pro league and that she's ranked operator not meant for pro league which he also said in his video, Goyo is the one who'll get most use in pro league if he's not banned.
---
So she'll be like Nokk never used but if anyone does use her it will be slashbug since he uses Nokk quite frequently and he likes her so I see him using Amaru effectively.
---
He literally did it in 5 seconds
---
"kIllS dOnT mATtEr"

is this real life?

where did the posts go

10-20 hours to fucking trace an icon? Jesus Christ.

Lol quite ironic coming from you
---
From what I saw he never claimed it took him a long time.
---
Same thing with pressing qe unnecessarily , for me at least
---
And why is that?
---
Usually they make a certain amount of items so you are limited by the number of item created for the event. You don’t get duplicates so you will have all the items if you by all the alpha packs.

Aah yes deep-fried operators

Yes because clearly absolutely none of those shots even hit her despite the fact that half of them connected.

no prob man anything to help people out, i put it on high once and i noticed my frames in game were like 90 (compared to the usual 180-200) so was so scared something with my gpu happened until i checked the graphic settings and to my surprise almost everything was on ultra
---
Same reason for every game subreddit. A) There's *not that much content to discuss*. Yes, there's all these op's and maps... and they're here for months and years, while reddit cycles posts daily. There's just not that much you can talk about to possibly fill the front page every single day. On top of that, people come to the game sub to relax, they want easy to digest content, that's why people always want memes. Footage of the game, art/comics, memes, they're easy to digest, they don't take a lot of thought and/or effort, they make good filler content basically.
---
I want to but people are getting mad at me for posting these, I will probably have a .png of all the ops out tomorrow or Sunday and that will be free to use

Think it depends on your play style as well, I tend to play Valk as an anchor/shallow roam, but I know others that play her a lot more aggressively. Having said that, I also know people who play doc and rook as aggressive deep roamers/spawn peekers because of the acog

Except gEnIuS here uses a MB instead of Flash or Comp.
---
10 minutes tops, sure. But what else were you guys expecting it takes when he got 10k upvotes anyway. One moment everyone loves him, and another everyone's banding up against. Wherever the bandwagon goes, right?
---
It really is sad. I would hate it if I was told I put no effort into an art piece I put effort into. Like I get it, it gets annoying to see the same thing reoccurring over and over again (trust me the ban phase in this game drives me nuts sometimes), but in the end who cares? All of this just for stupid internet points that are worthless both in and outside reddit. Clearly if you are so fixated on getting internet points and un-validating those around you just because you don’t see it to be good enough, then you have more problems then you could imagine.
---
Yup. And people never question anything. Bothers me how stupid some people can be.
---
Bruh he was like two three steps tho. Mmmhhh not 6 foot

Are you playing on a controller? And take the long barrel off, it’s useless.

Seems like OP is just a reposter who pretends to be the cosplayer until just got called out.

God. At least respect the time the guy put in.

Can u send me a link please

You meant "high eyes" right?

 Seems like OP is just a reposter who pretends to be the cosplayer until just got called out and deleted both of the posts.

You are 3 ages in one? That’s impressive.
---
I mean just add glow right.( Sorry I don't know anything about PS)
---
To be honest, I think it's not enough. Most people leave the matches to go out with friends for around 3H, which means that when they come back they can play ranked, but with some elo loss. I think that everytime you leave a ranked match, not matter how much elo you gain/lose, you should be one rank down, from gold one to gold two e.g.

God . The secondary SMG meta was a pain in the ass

Tell her to play the game. She doesn't know what shes missing out on.
---
not to shit on your idea, but, you can see area of effect (AOE) of a device but you can’t see AOE through walls
---
basically requires like of sight to device to see its AOE...
---
So basically IQ but less useful? Also why do you need to be able to detect laid and bandits gadgets. You can see them already.
---
If anything Jäger needs another hard nerf so hes not the must pick anymore ...
---
Care to further explain?
---
Up, down, up, down, up, down, up
---
no one would've had a problem if he wasn't spamming the sub with them one at a time
---
By far not less useful. And yes, basically a second IQ, but we need something against traps. 
---
Well...i put them in because they use electricity. Thats the point. You see electric stuff.

---
Anyone can get diamond, 5 man stack at rank reset, get 100+ mmrs/game, free diamond for everyone...
---
&gt; I hit diamond last season 200+ Elo above on my Smurf NokkR6, basically ONLY USING NOKK considered to be one of the worst ops in the game. On my main I was 150 below diamond, and it honestly hurts me to hear this bs come from your keyboard. 
---
  
---
Takes like 5 mags to get used to the recoil, you are very talented at the game.
---
&gt; Personally I’ve really good with secondary SMGs since the beginning of the game because I got used to it. 
---
Pro league...
---
&gt; He is one of the MOST BANNED OPERATOR in almost all level of pro league. 
---
So the operators make the gun good...
---
&gt; The MP5 is good A) because it’s part of doc and rooks kit. 
---
So the gun is trash, acog is op. Help me more pls.
---
&gt; B) it has a fucking Acog. 
---
Actually triggered xD Why are you comparing pro league to ranked?
---
&gt; So please before you sound like an uneducated shitter watch pro league, play in some comp, get outta silver and then talk about things like you actually know the game. Fuck outtta here 
---
Im pretty sure players know how to play without a coach. I could join G2 as a coach and just stand behind them without making a single sound and they would do perfectly fine. I could join open qualifiers and then tell everybody i played in the six invitational. Im so good, im experienced, im good at the game, im smart, every women wants me, im the best coach on reddit. Wake up man, you are a fucking retard thinking you know shit but you are the same fucking ranked player with some shit strat to win against randoms who dont know how to reinforce a wall... Thank you for wasting my time with your essay.
---
&gt;On top of that I coached a team, and got pretty far in Go4’s, and as well as played in Semi idk if you have but just like that I have direct experience with the Ranked scene and the Pro level scene.
---
What kind of dirty mind do you have?
---
No, he blew the candles out WITH the sledge hammer.

Well.. do you know when Halloween is?
---
Seeing a Mute jammers AOE is basically a smoll goodie, because he is supposed to see traps. You basically always have line of sight to Kapkan traps, but now you can see then far better. I made the thing with the walls because i dont want him to be just a better IQ.
---
You just rinse and repeated them
---
Yeah that Natalissa chick hey, am I right?
---
Ahahahahaha Tachanka omg I can't xDDDDDddddddDdddDDDDDddd
---
And can only use a pistol while looking. I mean, we had thermite, so why did we need hibana? It's always good to have diversity.
---
I get your point, honestly, but I still think there's a large number of people that enjoy seeing these, and the comments on the original post before the entire 5 second thing shows that really well
---
But she cant use her Primary while dokng it. And she cant see the AOE. As i told you, we need more ops against traps.
---
How did you got onto this spot at the first few seconds!?
---
We can call him dickface now
---
The drawing has "Sledge age 35"  and he is born 82. So he's 37 now. 
---
Making it 2 years ago then. So it would make OP 11.
---
I bet its done more recently though. His Lore states he is 35 on the website. So obviously not been updated.
---
Marry her
---
Pic taken from snake-nade's twitter.
---
OP said 9. Pic says sledge is 35. His age now is 37. So 2 years ago atebatif OP wasn't lying. Making OP 11. Still too young for Siege lol.
---
OK and how often does that happen?
---
Odds are that was not planned
---
Thought you were pointing out it was making an OwO and i was gonna say something about his April fools costume but now i see it. Fuckin hell
---
I always get all events packs , with r6 , there is no limit as usually it cost between 9k to 12k r6 credit to acquire them all per event
---
I mean, what's your playstyle? Look through their gadgets and guns and pick whatever fits you most. I personally love dokkaebi but many of my friends swear on vigil. It comes down to.you, man.
---
If they would implement a native MnK on console then yeah.
---
i mean, it doesn’t really make sense, since recoil is the gun going up and backwards, so planting a gun down on the ground (proning) should increase recoil because you’re not holding it with two hands
---
&gt;in situations like these    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;pay-to-win
---
I dunno man, if I were to buy a pay-to-win item I would expect a much bigger impact than having 1 or 2 spots on 1 or 2 maps where I would have to literally camp all round to maybe get any benefit
---
Bandit was  the most noticeable case,   but    in one update they just made  like   half of  the operators **A N G R Y**. Old  Kapkan was badass.
---
Some guy posted a neon glow version of an operator logo and got a lot of shit for it because someone else proved that they were karma farming and could recreate what they made in 5 seconds
---
These special forces wear camouflage that let's you blend in with some surfaces??? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yo I know this was posted a week ago but if you guys get a group from Reddit going, I'd love to play. Most of my friends play sporadically if ever lol
---
I see where you are coming from.....BUT it doesn’t really hold water.  If it was a weapon that did more damage or something I’d easily say pay to win, but an operator skin? Extremely situational. Highly unlikely
---
He looked like an owl to me, you apparently just have dick on the brain.
---
I have the Turtlebeach Ear force Recon 60p and for it being a very low price I think it’s really flippin’ good

Why are you in incogonito?

dang i call a guy who called me a fake "genius" and an admin deletes my comment and gives me a warning but apparently calling someone a "fucking incel" is fine.

Prolly had info on you. Cause u can’t cheat on console. Unless you’re like a genius programmer.

Better question who cares

Yup

Bartlett was originally created for article 5, i doubt it'll get a rework any time soon.

Why? You want everyone to acknowledge your elite Ash?

It IS ok when you post something like that. When you do this once. But not when you do it every day. Not a karma farm at all, oh nono, no sir, no way, can't be. One day he just prouder dan other!

for me I think, that you need to Smurf somewhere(casual) so you can play with your friends no matter what elo they have. 
---
In ranked I think this 1000 elo gap helped a bit. It's to much in the lower ranks and not enough the higher ranks. can't play with p3 people when I'm p1. 
---
But this season has been more enjoyable to me because i don't encounter any more diamonds+copper teams

My freind has killed 2 people with one bullet on glaz they are coded in.

Ah, classic case of r/woooosh on me. My bad mate.

commando9
---
hmmm yes let's give more elite skins to operators who are barely played or already have one instead of ones that are pretty popular but don't have an elite. buck, castle, cap, and Monty are all played a ton yet Ela gets an elite before them
---
*insert details joke here*
---
Mess with your sens but itll be easier to controll and aim. I have them myself and I can say they help a lot but its going to take you time to get used to it. You're going to see improvement for sure.

There's literally no point
---
Sso funny...
---
Hey! I earned that! The game recognised I was good player number 1 and awarded it to me!
---
Who cares, if you want them to be gay let them be gay, if you want them to be strait let them be strait, and anywhere in between. I don’t think devs should have to say one way or another. It’s art so the end user should let that come down to them as an individual.
---
Level 196 and still TKs when they get carried in Ranked.

Does she have experience decorating cakes because both Sledge and the AK74 and very well done for any beginner?
---
I’m new to reddit in general and don’t quite know how to PM, but could you do a thatcher and frost one as well? Those are my other two mains.
---
I can't sleep anymore. I need to know if sledge is gay... I mean the way he he holds the hammer and everything
---
Um who cares dosen't affect anything in any way
---
Who? What? Is this another season pass?
---
That is what I meant, i forgot to say that. Unless it's keyboard pc vs keyboard console
---
For attack (bomb) is go: ying, fuze, Montagne, finka, and capitão(or jackal) 
---
Defense (bomb): Jagër, smoke, echo, doc(or rook) and goyo 
---
For any other game (regardless of casual or ranked): I’d go attack: zofia, lion, buck, thermite, thatcher (or twitch) 
---
Defense: kapkan, caveira, valkerie, mute, and frost
---
you can install SSDs into consoles
---
No I know it doesn’t, but why not do it if they did it with Hibana
---
If you're going to replace your HDD..then just buy a SSD as a replacement.

why would internet matter for when you're just loading maps, textures, models, etc.

Partially similar.
---
No it's not. Read my previous comment again.
---
At least you played blitz to give yourself a chance
---
Not just that, they’re also incredibly unbalanced by having access to almost any possible loadout from the five base CTUs.
---
Good crosshiar placement. At the head.
---
I got matched against MnK clan kids with the same front names in casual just a few matches ago. I feel you bro but we both know that complainig wont solve a thing. Hopefully devs do something about it but I doubt so
---
I agree with all this but if you learn how to use the Scorpion you can do fine with Ela. If you learn the recoil patterns you can hit headshots every time.
---
They're similar but Goyo is more about entry denial rather than plant denial.
---
this was a different stream you weren't in the one I was in, it was a few days ago for me.
---
And think about maps like theme park or Hereford where it won’t even come close to working
---
Its trash
---
Honestly? I have no idea.
---
Since I got ice for it I haven't really used the f2
---
With these converters not really, it simulates Controller inputs so its nearly imposible to detect MnK with this method
---
Yeah, but maestro's lmg is ridiculously good. It just would not be balanced.
---
Happy birthday buddy, the cake looks great!
---
Everytime a girl is harrassed on a match I play, I try to make them stop, but we can't change them...
---
I even tk'ed one dude :^)
---
What if you had to spend a certain ammount of r6 to trade like 15r6 per trade
---
That's good.
---
That could work but it would get annoying for the average player who doesn't want to spend r6 but really wants a certain charm or skin
---
Cause u were rude and it was uncalled for
---
What if it takes a certain amount of damage (let's say 200) then it will run off?
---
You are also dumb. That’s not main focus either.
---
calculated
---
Nice
---
So you went digging into my profile looking for something... to use against me?  Buddy, I don’t care what people see.  If I post it, I’m not ashamed.
---
Well it really wouldnt be any more balanced then a full team of mp7 or carbine recruits wich already exists in the game
---
Bingo
---
Well you dont have to trade, it would be optional, no cosmetics are neccessary.
---
Boring
---
It happens, at least we have one person that’s helping out. Thanks!
---
Poor kaid, he learned the hard way how bad the melee mechanic is in this game

this would be really cool but i don’t want to see my dog getting blown up by an edd or a nitro cell lol

I’ve shot my other pupper teammates so yea

Y’all need to play the division, I think the first week of the game over 100k dogs were killed.

To be honest I don’t remember it’s been years
---
For real, just want to play the damn game without the sexual comments.
---
Thankyou. I find it fun
---
That looks really goodbut I got a pretty dumb question . Would that doc skin ever be available again because it looks so damn good
---
r/angryupvote
---
It’s fun isn’t it?
---
How?
---
Fortunately I have not, and likely will  not ever have to make that decision.
---
What did.... why did.... hold on
---
yeah...there is a pixel...you can even get it from inside
---
This exact same thing. Someone started posting operator icons with backgrounds like "Oh it's Finka's icon but if it were red" or "Here's Jager's icon with the German flag behind it." And then hundreds of people started doing the same thing for karma.
---
I just make callouts when I need, people usually respond then
---
I really don’t know. Like I literally discovered that I got that uniform the other day. Even tho I have elite skin for doc but this looks so good.
---
Why would people ban blitz?
---
Are.... are you serious?
---
They definitely turn the mics on once I start making call outs, I get the “are you a girl” ambush.
---
Yeah it's a simulation in universe. The Team Rainbow operators aren't actually killing each other, they're all on the same team!
---
The only non-simulation things were Outbreak and the Bartlett Situation with the gas.
---
map knowledge
---
I head on. How does one shoot from the hood into the shoulder from head on?
---
That...sounds super low quality posting. Wtf? Anyone with a bit of photoshop knowledge can easily recolor icons. Yikes. The mods need to have some quality control.
---
You forgot black eyes and bulletproof cams
---
But then  again,  they've  been  trained to be hostile. I wouldn't feel bad putting  down  a  rabid dog on  the street in 
---
  self-defence, so I presume  the same  should   go  for one that's literally trained to kill me.
---
Wait is there _really_ a gap between the outside floor amd this wall or were you just joking?
---
You have a point, but the dude was just sharing some cool shit anyways. I was really looking forward to a couple of the ops he had planned. Either way, whether he was whoring or not, people shouldn’t have took a fat deuce on him for it.
---
Yeah... i just figured i would put the hard to counter ones for new players honestly overlooked black eyes
---
For sure, I play on PC as well (not R6 but other shit) and it’s way better, but it isn’t grounds for coming here and shitting on ppl that can’t afford or don’t care to have a $1500 machine
---
You may be right that I care too much about a username. The thing is, I just have always had that name when I was on console and would have liked to have it on pc and the user that has the name is a completely empty account. It kind of sucked being told they couldn't help me but they could help a streamer. As for my rank, I've been diamond on pc the last 3 seasons, but that shouldn't even be relevant.
---
It's a mercy killing.

This ain’t new. At all
---
It really does tho why is doc so built
---
Yeah there is a glitch like this in yacht too
---
Adding to his point, many streamers/players play on pc with a controller and do just fine. Really you just need to practice. You can be comparable in skill to a KnM with a  controller.
---
Judging by the rff sign in the bottom doesn’t look like it happbed in one round
---
Plus only giving the attacker a pistol is operator suicide. Dokki, Lion, and Jackel exist to put pressure on roamers reliably and droning is such a better way at finding roamers

Basically, RIP, Chimera blitz, you will not be missed.

That’s actually cool didn’t even know that!

If you ever add a Philippino operator, will this be the design?
---
Well, shit. If this happens, I'm gonna need a new main.
---
Everyone goes Bar and has a drink.
---
I’m hard stuck in silver and gold because I get 10+ kills each game but my teammates just can never frag out the same
---
Most of the time you will lose. You are prone to the ground with no ability to move so the attacher knows where you are he just has to peek and pre fire and bam you’re dead.
---
Yea but that’s literally the point
---
Get gud is what most people would say and they are kind of right. Just keep playing my first season ended in copper iv with a peek at copper II but after that i progressed to the point I’m able to get into high plat solo q style
---
I know and it’s not a fun mechanic
---
Buck?
---
As long as clash doesn't come seems like a good strat
---
I love and hate this
---
I DESPISE dogs (and also happen to be scared of them) so I would be more than happy to demonitize one. Also, I know this is just an idea/joke so don't woooosh me or anything
---
Ego is wild.
---
The dog should just get injured
---
That’s my next thing I want to try.
---
I'm willing to bet that They haven't touched the thunt since the game dropped
---
(Removal of bomber, whole rooms of c4 and barbed wire nonwithstanding)
---
Don't make me kill a puppo when im on defense 😓😓
---
I hope we all agree to have a sort of etiquette here; if the Operator himself is shootable, do *not* shoot good boy. If good boy is chasing after your neck and you have no option but to shoot him and do not have a shot on the Op, then so be it. 
---
No shoot good puppers unless trying to kill you
---
What if it was a robot doggo instead? Wouldn’t that solve all the moral problems?
---
She probably thinks he ruggedly handsome (which he is, but that might be a reason)
---
Wouldn't work. It might for a second, but I guarantee you that once the fan art started and people started empathizing with it then we'd all be screwed.
---
Not really... you’d be helping with the global issue of over population...
---
I'm not saying that what he did was hard but some of his had a couple of different parts to them, like the IQ lighting bolts in her eyes. (New to Photoshop) How did they manage to change the colors around for only some of the lines?
---
This needs the Benny Hill theme song playing in the background
---
There is rarely a reason for you not to use them

i see the halloween even has started early
---
Elas face 🤭
---
and that is because they didnt want to release the number of pidgeons lol.
---
Man you really that focused on getting kills you didn’t make a single call?
---
there is no downside
---
the damage knockoff is so negligible it doesn't change the ttk
---
Thanks! Once you've made the report, can you link me the R6Fix report for reference?
---
People make me sick
---
Oh me I’m a Thatcher/Thermite Echo/Rook Main me, best support player in the west, I hate acogs and 3 speeds, hate em, wouldn’t catch me dead playing them, just here to help my team get the W.
---
Recruit isn’t even in rank. I really don’t care that they don’t have the dlc weapon. I prefer that they create new good content ( good ops good maps/ rework good balance) than use this time to give recruit all weapon.
---
Your level has nothing to do with the opponents. It’s only your rank and that gets reset every season
---
Says while rocking ash main ash main ash main (it was a joke)
---
this is cute but i hope ubi never puts AI controlled gadgets in the game
---
another good attack strat here is to ying the mira's, and throw another ying into the site through the doorway on the right. As the first one goes off, run in and enter the room while the second is going off. Easy kills.
---
If only he used his chungus knife
---
Alright cool now you're trying to put words in my mouth too. I didn't say that. In fact, I told you the best thing you can do to take care of the problem. go all the way up to my first comment in this chain and click the fucking link to [support.ubi.com](https://support.ubi.com) and bitch to the people that can do something about it. not the ones that know about the issue, can't do anything about it, and have to sift through 40 of these stupid low effort Karma whoring posts and 40 shitty op ideas and then another 20 shitty drawings before getting to any damn content worth viewing on this sub.
---
Basically it works like a roaming Frost trap.  Pins you down until it’s either shot or the operator or their teammates kill you.
---
It's terrible man. Hopefully it can be stopped before all console players are driven away
---
You know I was joking too right? I play support sometimes but Ash, Twitch, Zofia Bandit Jager are always gonna be my mains, and Rook, I genuinely love rook fir the odd spawnpeek or meme armour runout
---
practice makes perfect. that morning when i got on i was just practicing the recoil for the bearing and look what turned out. personally i think flash hider gives the best results
---
Is he wearing airpods to block out the noise?

Hello Cupittycake, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dduq8o/connection_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Shut up, whiner.
---
I love how everyone freaks out about killing dogs, but not the facts that...
---
1) Several humans are killed every round.
---
2) The multiplayer matches are canonically simulations where nobody is actually dying.
---
3) Kills arent even long and drawn out (with the exception of Caveira) as the military theme ensures characters are trying to be efficient.
---
I think theyre just worried about balancing such a character (and rightfully so, a canine op would play completely different than anything we've seen in Siege, and might be a bitch to program regardless of if it's an NPC or directly player controlled)
---
I can still dream, though
---
It’s a new way to “spawnpeek” coconut brah did a video about it and other spawnpeeks like a day ago go check it out! I don’t think it’s a glitch! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe3neVuXtf0
---
Bikini would be proud.
---
not mnk just practice (i still potato a shit ton) i run 45 v 65 v and 30 ads
---
Make the sad dog noise global across all games world wide when killed
---
Ok, when I read the title, why was my first thought that they plan to add an actual dog as an operator?
---
Where are you wandering to?
---
One time in a solo queue there were 3 pretty cool dudes but one super toxic dude. We were winning 3-0 and he kept talkin about how he was the only reason we were winning (He was in 3rd place in terms of kills, just he thought that since he kept commanding us what to do that he was the leader or something idk). 
---
He then mentioned how we all care too much about winning and are tryharding anyways when we mentioned the scores. 
---
I pulled up a surrender vote and all 3 of the other's on my team voted yes haha. None of us really cared about the rank I guess. It was glorious he got so mad. Then I got matched with him on the very next queue and he downed me, then tried to finish me off but richochet'd and killed himself lmao.
---
I don’t have a 3d printer or really much interest in them atall to be honest. But thats pretty cool of you to do that and release them to everyone. Nice one mate
---
Mutes coming!
---
Title made me laugh more than it should have to be honest. Nice shot though!
---
The difference is that this dog would be a named character, and have merch
---
I’m not a sociopath. I love dogs and wouldn’t want to hurt them.
---
mw3 ptsd
---
General Reposti (of yourself????)
---
The difference is when it's a player controlled character it's a lot easier to tweak. There's never any guarantee an AI is going to behave properly.
---
note i forgot about pc and stuff
---
Of you're ok with shooting a person I don't think a dog is a step up...
---
Not every black person with an eye patch is nick fury.
---
Actually worse lolololol
---
What’re these several reasons?
---
I say it should whimper after death
---
Hmm. You make a good point.
---
Then the devs need to remember this is a training exercise and the dog would actually just be very good at playing dead
---
There’s literally a clip and recording function built into your Xbox, no need to be sensitive when someone points out your shitty video quality, my guy
---
Well why do I have to play against lvl 275 every game on my main and on my smurf against level 50's
---
Very nice!
---
don't know if it's bullshit but this shows the sides they're on
---

---
Heard that 🗿
---
it doesn't bother me and they said it's harder to get licenses for new guns now
---
Better then shooting it directly
---
I've done this on my K70 rapid fire lol.
---
F and G are too close for comfort.
---
At least you know you’re fucking retarded 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Alright sounds good
---
Only 3? I think I'm up to 5.

Kapkan pick rate rises by 100%

Nah

Nice!
---
Wouldn't have happened if it was blitz, that shithead runs faster than the bloody phone signal.
---
Go back to minecraft kid this game is rated m for mature and you clearly don't fit the criteria.
---
You kinda forgot about like, every other platform, which it came out on *before* gamecube
---
Where
---
Two words: robot dog
---
Good thing I never played it then
---
I like the suggestion of being able to mimic sounds in some way better than canine op.
---
Are you joking or serious about the dog operator?
---
Nick Capitão needs to be the new director of SIX
---
If I saw that good boi bounding around a corner I would just say sorry to my team in advance and let the end come.
---
[looks like a seasonal charm to me c:](https://imgur.com/a/4RRPei0)
---
Ash with 3 smokes 
---
Oof
---
There should be an operator that gets spider senses for a short period of time
---
