Priest if you love a well balanced sandwich. Y'know it's got provolone, turkey, tomato's, mayo and some music. Maybe a little of bacon in there for some fun and it's on the or marble bread. In general it hits all the flavor bases.
---

---
Paladin if you like you ham and cheese sandwich nice and simple
---
Shaman if you like an Italian sandwich with all types of meats: salami, pepperoni, capicola, sopressata, prosciutto, mayo, tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, olives, oil &amp; vinegar, seasoning and even olives stabbed into it with a pick. You like to have a lot of flavors to taste and plenty of nuance.
---
Druid will be for those who love a veggie wrap as equally as they love a French dip or even a chicken parm. They can never fucking decide on which sandwich to get so they end up getting the sampler of sliders.
---
---
---
Okay, so good dps = low dps, right? :D
---
I don't know your interests personally...  Do you think LFG was a positive addition to WoW?  If not, don't you wish more people had posted more frequently so that Blizzard might have realized the ramifications of LFG implementation?
---
I said this same shit about lfg and flying mounts and no one listened then, but I just shut my mouth and tried to stay positive.  Like the other commenter said- "i told you so" didn't feel the least bit satisfying.  In fact, I didn't even say "i told you so", I just quit the game because it lost its magic.
---
The great thing about opinions is that you can form your own :D
---
is COD in classic?
---
I see where ur point, but I think its different because Kevins point is that something happened in the game, that you didnt enjoy and if you could choose you would choose to remove it. (the rogue)  
---
But I dont see how that would really work if I cant even play the game anyway.   
---
blizzard has said that their #1 issue with the launch is making sure all these WONDERFUL players and fans of vanilla are able to log in, and play and experience the chaos.  
---
they dont really care if the starter zones are so crowded u cant complete quests, cuz thats how it was back in the day and it will still be
---
I was hoping classic wow would bring out players that have matured over the past15 years, but reading shit like the OPs post quickly reminds me that it’ll be the same teens playing as 2004.
---
Too long.
---
Ni hao! And farm some gold
---
ur picture describes exactly how layering works????????????????? what lol
---
&gt;unplayable
---
I don’t think that word means what you think it means.
---
Not in the #NoChanges camp but i'm very much against layering. To quote a post i made on the topic a few days ago.
---
&gt; All i've seen of layering is that it's sharding but worse. I played on Nostalrius launch before they implemented adaptive respawns of mobs and objectives. And i would be more than fine doing it again.
---
I'd rather struggle and only get to level 10 in the first week without layering, than have layering and get well passed level 30 in the first week. If there is 500 other players in Red Cloud Mesa(Tauren 1-6 zone). Then i want to acually be able to see those 500 other players in Red Cloud Mesa.
---
Man make dungeon!
---
I've done a lot of competitive raiding back from BC-MoP, and the damage that matters is always the damage done to boss or critical adds, not overall.
---
THATS THE STUFF!
---
XD
---
word
---
the amount of rank 14s is based on how many active pvpers there are, essentially for every 350 players pvping you can have 1 rank 14. because you need that 13000RP from the top bracket atleast once to get you to rank 14 from rank 13.
---
buzz words
---
Only if you let me get that nice shield
---
No, you’re right, Classic is gonna die because we’re actually able to login and play, and not because 50% of the population leaves because they can’t play.
---
Ya u rite
---
Sounds fun can u explain it? :-)
---
Ofc we will play in August. The Question is if we will play in November.
---
Lots of old druggies playing classic Everquest (p1999)
---
At least he can form a sentence...
---
To elaborate a bit, the rank 7/8/9 grind is completely fine, just regularly do pvp. Rank 10 will be a bit of a push but not too hard if you play a lot for one week. Rank 11 is where it really starts to slow down, and then rank 12/13/14 get much crazier at each rank after that. Rank 10 is completely obtainable by a normal person with a job and family (that lets them play WoW a lot!).
---
Concussive shot?
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted.  I played through all of classic and I don't think my experience would have changed at all with the existence of the wow token.
---
I chose blacksmithing so I could make myself the lionheart helm
---
There's no reason to take 26 agility over 1 crit 50AP. It's just worse.
---
If the rogues are running UBRS they can run it again just like the hunter. There's no reason to give it to some random rogue over yourself. The same thing is going to happen again and again until you magically find a group where everyone has it. That's insanity.
---
If you're running with a guild, then you're spamming UBRS with the same people over and over again before heading into MC. Of course you give it to the guildie rogue, because you're getting yours in the next hour or two anyway.
---
Everyone is running UBRS Phase 1, if you farm the gold to buy 2x Bone Slicing you'll come out behind the people that farmed their actual BiS.
---
Why not just heal?  Or roll a dps class?
---
That is literally dumbest statement I’ve ever heard and why the game got to the point that it’s in. I would attempt to argue with you but I’m sure you enjoy BFA and as such it is a waste of my breath. I award you no points for your effort in your reply, and may god have mercy on your soul.
---
I feel like this is completely obvious to anyone that is levelling at lvl 10 and accidentally aggros something that starts casting fireballs at them.
---
You’ll be able to transfer your characters to a Wod server.
---
1. sharding. Its cancerous just like on retail, you will see people you probably wont see again. its abruptive, constant phasing in and out randomly.
---
2. Increased server cap on launch is bad because the world is not ment to host more than 3000 players, private servers jacked everything up like Herb/Vein node respawns, dynamic mob respawns etc.
---
3. Kevin Jordan even said that Allen Adham one of the big bois of vanilla wow originally wanted the realms to have a cap of 500 players. take that into perspective.
---
Except they still got our money because we all played those games for at least the first two months
---
You need to do an economy course, or accept what people are saying when they say there needs to be a way to get gold out of the economy.
---
&gt;People who disagree with me are all closeminded, but *im not*
---
/s
---
My argument? You mean the clear fact that open betas have a long history through the game industry? lol
---
Yeah. I love Mechagon because my PvE shard isn't phased most of the time but everywhere else is a total mess
---
You're misunderstanding layering, you will still see 500 taurens in the starting zone at launch, layering doesnt affect that.
---
I would pay mad money to get a figure of my main
---
It doesn't need to be implemented.  Vanilla WoW was released in 2004 an was successful without it.  Private servers ran in people's basements with tens of thousands of users were successful without it.
---
This whole "it's necessary" thing is complete BS.
---
Also, is no one else bothered by Blizzard's assumption Classic will have long term plummeting subs?
---
yeah but different devs, different views so idk
---
The idea is mage/rogue because they have the highest amount of CC potential (sheep, sap, gouge, stuns, etc).
---
While warriors can offtank things, I think they were trying to get at CC.
---
I believe based on another post that Scott Mercer did the encounter design and Jeff Kaplan "populated' it aka placed the mobs and trash in the week following.
---
Art lock-off generally happens slightly earlier on a game, my other question is did they already have Ragnaros from the art team but nowhere to put him? That's not something easily done in the timeframe, almost all the other stuff is re-purposed.
---
Still miles better than how Vanilla retail was, which is kind of the point. Back then the average player could get away with shitty enchants and wrong specs in AQ 40. Show up with that in a average guild these days and they'll most likely tell you to get it fixed. That is just one out of many scenarios where the leeway is much smaller than back then and the understanding and expectations of people is much higher as well. Because the game is 15 years old and the meta of online gaming these days, is to look up guides and somewhat understand whatever you get into.
---
I'm against layering because it does nothing to address initial overcrowding.
---
With 3000 people per layer, per continent, there will still be 1000+ per starter area at launch.
---
Layering only solves the problems that Blizzard created for themselves out of  greed.
---
They instituted no kind of gatekeeping that would allow them to estimate demand, giving them no way to estimate initial populations.
---
Giving classic to retail players for free ensures that the launch will be a clusterfuck of tourists all in the name of maybe keeping a few more accounts subbed for an extra month. (Classic launches just over 2 months, ie. billing cycles,  after the latest BFA patch.)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
However, at this point, because of those sins of avarice mean that server mergers and/or server splits are absolutely both going to be necessary.  If there have to be massive disruptions to communities just so Activision's stock price might go up four cents, I'd rather have them hidden behind the euphemism of "layering", because that can be spun in the press.  As much as I would love to see Activision fall on their face literally any other time, it's in all of our best interests that the press doesn't get an excuse to run with a "Failure of Classic WoW!" clickbait headline when those server mergers (layer collapses? whatever you want to call them) happen.
---
There were plenty of ways to avoid the need for layering.  Just as there were plenty of ways to deal with initial overcrowding.  Unfortunately, the long and the short of it is, there isn't time now.  We've got bigger problems than layering.  Layering will disappear by phase 2 (and I'd wager not a day sooner).  RCR/Autosquelch, Loot Trading, Shared Sub and leeway will be screwing us from day one until the servers cease to be profitable.
---
TL;DR It doesn't matter.  We're stuck with it, and we've got worse garbage than layering to deal with.
---
It’s  not, you should see the female farther down arguing AOE is always better Bc hIGHeR DPS on MeTER gud that’s why it’s called deeps DUH
---
Holy Troll Priest, easiest spec and horde side troll has the best racial for healing.
---
You said exactly what I was thinking better than I eve could.
---
Thought you were talking about the pserver
---
&gt;I'd rather struggle and only get to level 10 in the first week without layering
---
Theres a compromise though, that I'm for. Why not shard the 1-10/1-20 maybe, starting areas, and keep EVERYTHING after that completely open and un fucked-with?
---
Tailor / enchant 
---
Aesthetic town costumes were actually really popular and a big money maker. The tuxedo comes to mind
---
Enchanting was huge money maker. I had all the rare enchants and used to get tips for disenchanting gear on the regular and laying down those rare ones.
---
 Feel like you are doing good in the community too. You're valuable
---
Tailor also made bags for people which was a huge QOL boost. Again happy customers.
---
Plan on doing the same this time around except for a Priest UD main
---
I'll never stop reminding people of the issues that classic is going to have, sorry fully grown adult who posts on everything that I do.
---
im about as open minded as i can be, except i see reason where reason is
---
Engineering, Enchanting - feral druid life. Will be dropping enchanting once I have my heart of the mountaint (BIS trinket for ferals), for mining, as I can solo run the dark iron forge and smelt for days as required.
---
Engineering has a ton of toys which are fun and useful.
---
I'd take layering over &gt;30min Queues or Dynamic Respawns any day.
---
yes, i tested it: https://redd.it/bsh5bg
---
and backwards too: https://redd.it/buttaf
---
Yeah, fair. I guess a distinction can be made between story-telling and content. And yeah I'd love to a see a classic re-telling of everything that has happened in the later expansions (minus pandas)
---
It's sad.  You should have seen this sub a year ago.  People were getting upvoted for saying there should be no changes at all, and the discussion was about how to get the most authentic Vanilla WoW experience.  Someone proposing layering would have gotten downvoted to oblivion and laughed at.
---
The popularity of Classic has brought in a whole different type of player.
---
It definitely goes the other way as well. I've seen plenty of posts here and by playing on servers, of people crying about 'herp derp I only do x% less DPS than the others" with the mentality of why would the less DPS matter, when the group/raid/guild will clear the content easily anyways, even with people in subpar specs.
---
There's definitely people playing subpar specs not understanding not everybody wants to put up with them.
---
problem is, people who are "showing up, bringing consumes, helping summon, gear running alts, providing utility to the raid" are the people who care about progress and their numbers and they aren't playing meme specs. Seeing a meme-sepc instantly tells you that the player doesn't give a shit about being optimal -- or even decent. If they cared they would have picked a better class.
---
Well those are the obvious ones from a realism perspective. Your body is literally morphing, anything holding on to you is going to have a hard time holding on when your body shifts into a small kitty or hulks out into a massive bear.
---
So you think GMs are creating gold or tokens? There's no way on Blizzard servers. They track and lock down that stuff far too much in their support department. Tokens make them a lot of money, they aren't going to let a rogue GM cut into that.
---
Tokens sell so easily because the entire region buys them. A number of people sub only through tokens, for years. I filled my Bnet balance by buying tokens with gold.
---
Are you really unaware that the character models were redesigned in Warlords if Draenor?
---
On an average well populated server you'll need to be in the top 300 or so for your faction to advance thru rank 9. in a premade of any sort that'll be very easy (since you are mostly playing against PUGs), solo it's also easy but will take many more hours. 
---
It will all depend on the exact server you are on but lots of people got rank 9/9 on vanilla *before* the BGs. You'll just have to adjust your playing hours up or down if solo. In a premade doing up to 20 hrs/week you are 100% guaranteed to hit rank 10 very quickly.
---
Very true, this one is very simple and polished
---
&gt;its not what its for and it 100% wont work, thats just sharding like in retail, no1 wants that.
---
It's not like we *want* sharding, but instead, we understand it's a necessary evil to reach a compromise that helps with the original game, rather than undermining it. 
---
People say that 90% of people wont even reach level 20, so servers will die. And at the same time, they say sharding wont work because that only controls the sub 20 population.
---
If thats the case, why isn't sharding 1-20 better?
---
Not having enough time to play but the time that you do play min/maxing and going hardcore and playing as efficient as possible IS NOT BEING A CASUAL.
---
That was an interesting read :D, ty for the post
---
they did not remake vanilla.
---
they found/made a way to dump the old code into the new engine. 
---
The ground work is now done as i believe was said in a video, so tbc would be easy compared to making new content.
---
LFG and summoning stones are both quality of life changes.  LFG is just a bigger change.
---
I completely agree. I want launch to be an absolute mad house, you only get to experience a fresh server once and I can't see it happening again in official servers.
---
The ramifications of layering on a pvp server is HUGE as well. 
---
I think it's also worth pointing out that the company we are dealing with ruined this game with multiple expansions of what they thought the community wanted. We need to send a form message as a community that we want VANILLA version of this game, not a pseudo-vanilla with (more) things Blizzard Activision "thinks the community wants or needs"
---
I honestly am waiting for the day they announce layering won't get turned off, which won't happen before launch due to the reaction it would create. It's easier to swallow after "you've played with layering on for months". The time frame has already changed from a few weeks to a few months... Because they think the community wants or needs it. 
---
Launch the game with no layering. If no one is level 10 in a week, we'll be crying as a community for it.
---
[removed]
---
Oh well, too bad for you I guess ;)
---
10 cents an hour's good money when you are chinese
---
Roll a PvP char.  Leveling isn’t hard just time consuming....right?!  /s
---
Buddy I’d just layer hop ;)
---
Lmao I didn't know that, that's hilarious. They also got cyclone then right? I'd imagine that would have been insanely frustrating, get out of cyclone into being immediately dazed.
---
What.... with non-hardcore guilds that 40 minutes doesn't even cover raid forming time, summoning time, afk/bio time during the MC and then you need to separately go to Onyxia. You are just confused because of pserver speedrunning with every single world buff. A good guild can do it in 90min.
---
It’s been lost to convenience like everything else. It’s not convenient to have to be strategic so dungeons are now face roll and as such, skills have been lost over the years
---
Dead DPS do bad DPS. I hope to god you're a troll.
---
I really hope there will be no layering after lvl 25-29 zones...
---
How are you gonna wiggle your little gnome body out of being concussed?
---
For a warlock and the sake of easy math 2.5 spell power = 1 dps
---
1% crit = 20 spell power
---
3% = 60 spell power
---
4 warlocks with 3% crit = 240 spell power or roughly 100 raid dps being added
---
The issue is a boomkin does &lt;300 dps avg in a raid. So even adding the raid dps hes doing 400 dps
---
A warlock easily does 450 dps by himself so theres that....
---
We're going to have to disagree then. You don't greenlight many millions of dollars worth of work because a small fraction of players are demanding something.
---
The failure of Retail has pushed up the need to start anew. There isn't anything that can be done to fix retail. It will continue to bleed subs till it's a ghost town.
---
Blizz will remake Classic, TBC, Wrath, then they will go down a different path while keeping those old servers alive. It's the only thing that makes sense.
---
I'm not mad. I would just prefer not to play with that type of player. It's all good speccing weird for a laugh or whatever. But insisting on playing something like boomkin if your guild could (most likely) use you in a more useful spec is a bit too selfish for my taste. I like players who tries to play the game as well as possible, and tries to lift each other up, instead of dragging each other down. For me that is much more fun.
---
By starting on the 1.12 patch, which has been the decision for a LONG time now, we were already past the point of "no changes". Please stop trying to use this argument.
---
Literally everybody sees reason where reason is. Even close minded people. The problem is that seeing their own reason as such, and calling everybody else trolls, is also what closeminded people do.
---
I liked wotlk too, I enjoyed dominating s5/s6 because blood/frost DK was broken :)
---
They obviously wont roll it back because the new ones do look smoother and more modern, but they should consider adding it as an interface option. It would do no harm and it definitely does impact the game
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
picture describes a better alternative to layering.
---
you might want to look at it again and think harder.
---
Dude I almost had a real mental crisis once, I loooooved playing this game but I could only enjoy it while high..
---
If you need to be high to enjoy something, do you even enjoy it in the first place?
---
I personally don’t even leveling that much in Classic, so i’ll be smoking a bit on release.
---
It’s the not the authentic ‘vanilla experience’ if you don’t die in Tirisfal glades, release your ghost only to be falling through the ground in Stonetalon Mountains due to server instability.
---
Playing through the ups and downs of a fresh server isn’t something you get to repeat all that often..
---
#nochanges
---
It’s good to be a DK. Occasionally.
---
Ironically, raiding is a lot more skill intensive. If you're looking to progress in retail WoW you'll need a lot more mechanical skill
---
Also u bring 4-8 to raids..
---
The China issue was for Hearthstone and other lootbox games. They were no longer allowed to sell randomized packs, or they had to disclose the percentages, or whatever the case, they made it so you could buy a very small insignificant amount of dust for $60 and get complimentary hearthstone packs as a bonus.  They basically went around the gatcha game laws to keep lootboxes in their games.
---
roles transcend games
---
It was definitely in TBC, so I think so.
---
yeh i member, good times
---
1) won’t be an issue, as long as you can stick to the guild raid times and you contribute!
---
2) just don’t tell anyone your age?
---
Ill sign, but cant you just toggle on pvp?
---
Complainers can go back to retail.
---
When you goto a porn site and it asks if you’re over 18 do you click no?
---
SM/Ruin, doesnt really sacrifice anything, Shockadin loses some of their more marginal PvP talents for PvE talents. Spriest is pretty much the same.
---
Druids and Shamans have good hybrids specs, but their "pure" min/max PvE specs arent great for PvP. Hunter similarly, loses a LOT of good PvP talents as MM/BM, instead of losing a small amount of PvE talents as MM/SV
---
When you use certain immunity skills in WSG you automatically drop the flag, so you can't just run through a bunch of enemies without them being able to stop you. When the battleground first launched they hadn't figured out all the kinks yet, so we (and many others) figured out that if you Mind Control the opposing flag carrier you could cast Blessing of Protection on them to force them to drop the flag. I can't remember exactly how they fixed it, but it was promptly changed along with the [Judge's Gavel](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12528#comments) which did the same thing.
---
Definitely, it's the same suspicion as a trade would be.
---
I do. I plan on playing both. Any other witty things to add?
---
I just wouldn’t tell them
---
The slow gets knocked off (not that it works on raid bosses), but the damage tick remains
---
These days Chinese gold farming would be too expensive, income has gone way up there. You better start practicing your Vietnamese and Malay
---
No thanks. My $15. Not yours.
---
You've gotten mixed up somewhere.  I originally wrote:
---
&gt; I loved TBC and Wrath, but I feel like if they go with re-releasing expansions we'll just hit a dead end. If they release different Classic+ expansions based on Vanilla, we might end up with a lot more great content in the long run.
---
So *instead of* Classic Vanilla servers, Classic TBC servers, Classic WotLK servers, AND Modern...
---
We could have Classic Vanilla, Classic+, and Modern.
---
Re-releasing every expansion wouldn't be a good plan since it would fragment the player base.  And doing Classic+ servers instead could give us decades of Vanilla-like content that doesn't trickle in Modern elements like flying, LFD, and daily quests.
---
Yeah cooking is actually awesome at the high end level of the game and a ‘must’ for Naxx. You can actually make a fair bit of gold off it, selling raid food to the players who can’t be bothered farming.
---
Someone’s just posted a fishing / cooking guide which looks pretty good, gimme a sec I’ll find it
---
That spec is really weird and bad for all content.
---
Yes they do, but thanks anyway
---
You are bad for the game.
---
I always wanna play my DK more because death grip, but then I remember I like moving around like a squirrel on crack
---
I'd just go with 35.
---
This definitely is debatable. It always depends on your group/raid.
---
If the tank and healers can handle more incoming damage on the tank then AoE'ing down the mobs will be faster than killing targets one by one.
---
I'll look into it, thanks.
---
&gt;Its like comparing US dollar to South Korean currency
---
Not really... day 1 - 100 gold is worth more than day 452.
---
Using current ps server gold buying prices 800g is about $20 or a wow token
---
Correct, the highest rank of screech is only found on the Winterspring Screecher if I am not mistaken.
---
Uhg, i'd rather level slower, looks like a PITA.
---
imagine if the 3rd player in your chart isn't actually DPS, but has a different role
---
Nah, they just do LFR with little mechanics and have a chance to get almost as good gear as mythic raiders.
---
We need that POP!
---
I'm looking for a non-fishing Horde cooking guide. I know that would take a lot more grinding, but its surely doable. You just need to find all the recipes that help you level.
---
Wait for them to get low health on the bridge and then bounce them off so they crater. Enjoy the repairs.
---
The dude's right tho.... who even thinks about that lol????? Cringe.
---
This...was, beautiful
---
Big blue dress
---
Hey, hey, how much you win?
---
If this means you have a job you are not with your people. What's next, do you have a family and social life also, HA!
---
I'm more interested in the part below that. I want to create my own Hate List. Care to share that text?
---
+1 for old style numbers
---
In terms of atmosphere I love Tedlrassil. The questing in Darkshore kicks major ass. I think that's what I meant before. If you simple must do the human starting zone then come to an agreement with your friend but imho leveling together in the NE areas would be pretty great, especially given how many elites and rares are in the NE starting zone!
---
Can't be hamstrung if your a seal.  Checkmate warriors
---
If they have control over layers, which I fully expect they do, they can overtune it on the first day to prevent overcrowding by reducing the threshold population required to spin up new layers. Then return to expected sizes on 2nd day +.
---
First day is going to be a shit storm regardless of what they do anyways.
---
Ahhh, it's literally stolen from blizzard...
---
Ya it something people say when they dont have a strong argument. They just throw in buzz words, it's pretty transparent.
---
Awww yeah. Sweet. That's an awesome little touch from Blizzard.
---
So you'll be happy with 6 hour queues on first day?
---
Skydiving off the side of Darnassus. 
---
Sometimes you would hit the trees and die but most of the time you’d make it into the water.
---
You think that the people on this sub that say retail is a faceroll do anything past LFR or heroic dungeons?
---
You are by far in the minority for liking loot council, just know that. The only way I would ever play in a loot council guild is if the officers were all people i've known and trusted IRL for years. Otherwise, not a chance in hell. 
---
I recently did a loot council guild on an everquest progression server. The drama was insane. 
---
Stuff won't be hard enough to need a loot council anyway...isn't that the point of a loot council? To get the best stuff to the best people, to clear hard content? Its just not needed here. 
---
DKP is 100% fair. You put time in, you get loot out. No BS, no favoritism. Is it the best system to effectively gear a guild? No. But you won't need to for wow classic.
---
Can't say I've ever even thought of this
---
You bitch, i wanna play in the streamer realm and if i cant, i wont play at all. fuck you keep your opinion to yourself and dont force people to play like you want them to.
---
I’ll go back to my tide pods now
---
I’d gold that if I wasn’t broke
---
You're barely worth replying to. I've been playing since open beta.
---
If you think that 5 of those people will add more to the raid than the potential to be a liability, you didn't play vanilla.
---
With 40 people there's a potential for a few of them to be worse than having nobody.
---
Ignorance or troll, the world may never know.
---
I am both for and against. 
---
Layering as they have described it is ok. Layering in practice has not been true to what they promised. If its in i will abuse it where i can. 
---
I like the idea of individual servers 
---
Illidan 1
---
Illifan 2
---
Illisan 3
---
Illidady 4
---
All with the one pool of names and guilds. To be merged before phase 2. 
---
I dont see much downside of this as it is a less abusable system of layering.
---
Is this a troll post? I feel like this is a troll post.
---
Thanks, I needed a good laugh
---
This leaves dead servers after the first rush is over.
---
Thanks for the responses guys, I’m much less nervous about finding a guild now 😁
---
Their most common use is to build hype (and to find edge case bugs missed by a smaller sample size). The entire purpose would be to build more interest beyond those who watch streams. It would do the opposite of sabotage the release, and it might give them an opportunity to see the effects of layering with larger populations in later zones.
---
Pretty much this exactly for me.

What do you mean, aren't you 19? 
---
The answer is Yes
---
Caffeine and nicotine are both performance enhancing drugs. You didn't even respond to that part.
---
Haha that's brilliant. css were the times, UK mixvent!
---
I know but in that case you should heal to full hp when you poly hahaha
---
What if I like cooking, but don't want to fish?
---
Dude... They greenlit it because a private server had hundreds of thousands of users.  That implies an almost guaranteed player base of millions for the real game.  That is $$$$$$ for making a game that is *pretty much already made for them*... By themselves.
---
What exactly are you disagreeing with me on?  I'm sure I can convince you I'm correct. (Lol)
---
Oooh that should be on here. I'm adding it.
---
8k!!!!??!?$ hiring people to do it?
---
More like leash two. Pet taunts one while you burn it down. Then pet taunts the next and kill it. Repeat until all are dead. No drinking.
---
Wont that just make the content too easy?
---
I honestly can't see the difference could someone explain it to me, I think my eyes are too weak and can't keep up with the movement of the first link to catch the differences. Thank you
---
I’m gonna bet when this was released that not even Blizzard knew how strong warriors actually were.
---
Got an old one someone through away. It was broken in several places including the arm missing. Found the tag on the bottoms and they sent someone to fix it...for free! Gotta love 10 year warranty.
---
It's often better to get many targets collectively low once your tank has established threat so the fights don't last as longer. Sometimes it's good to burst a certain target if they spawn mobs on a timer, but for the most part trash mobs should just be aoe'd. :)
---
Yeah I think that there will be some servers with a mad rush past the first few zones... BUT there are multiple zones by that point, a few dungeons, and resources that start becoming important to fight over. It's too big of a trade-off after the first two or so zones to be worth it. Competing with 300 people in durotar isn't an authentic vanilla experience, but competing with 300 people in the barrens and past that can be. 
---
At the very least I'm glad they're putting an internal cooldown on when you can actually change to a different server.
---
"To wound all enemies is not good enough for most situations".
---
I really hope actual CC in dungeons becomes standard as well.  The blazing zerg that retail dungeons have been since Wrath is not as  immersive as paced systematic CC that fit Vanilla .
---
Spoken like a true squishie... And when was the last time you tanked a battle Mage_Girl? How do you prioritize your raid targets, or is it just generally around the skull icon if one exists? I was simply saying it’s obvious OldShool has been through it a couple times, his experience runs parallel with mine, I’ll run with the experienced.
---
Make sure to check out amds gpus they are usually better value. The rx570 is 50% faster than a 1050ti at the same price in my country. But yes for classic any modern gpu should run it fine.
---
As a shaman while leveling use 1h and shield, daggers are an excellent choice.
---
I'm still mad that Blessing of Freedom doesn't affect it.
---
If I’m not mistaken, the Hardpacked Snowballs are only available in Christmas, but I see no reason why world events shouldn’t be in the game, so we will most likely see them!
---
Unknown I, II, III. Dopefish exploration. The escapism movies. Also the original wow movie. Not that crap Blizzard made.

[NA vs Ragnaros](https://youtu.be/R6RMeAB-RVM)

This video is pretty much single handedly responsible for me wanting to raid in WoW.
---
Each layer is supposed to have the population of a normal realm though, right?
---
Bought a new laptop so I can play at work and grind out this leveling adventure a little faster. Got a mid grade. Dell is having a “Black Friday in July” sale and I got the G5 15!
---
It is way off, not only can you make an account on private servers for free making gold farming and bots easier to do but when an economy is fresh and when one is years old it's also totally different.
---
bit of a stretch there bud
---
I still remember that a friend of mine paid over 100€ for 1k gold in vanilla for his epic mount.
---
There will be 6+ spots for healers with windfury, there will be 0-1 spots for a dps shaman...just saying.

---
100% this, but at the entrance to MC.
---
There was something highly enjoyable about griefing the opposing faction who’d obviously just wiped during MC and forcing their entire raid to emerge from the portal
---
Ah thats the level of hardcore min maxing i like to hear.
---
How is engineering for a druid? I know you can't use grenades or other shit in form, but does that make it useless?
---
I love that you made this! And then to share it with us! That's awesome, thank you
---
Honestly I'd be too lazy for this
---
Sounds like there is just anecdotal evidence of how often people got banned, but considering how many gold farmers there were, I'm guessing most people didn't get banned for buying?
---
Beautiful hunter weapon.
---
Absolutely.
---
I do hope he has a good time playing according to his mindset tho
---
I mean, if you're trying to fill out a raid 1% spell crit is a good deal, even if they stand in the back and innervate and nothing else
---
Yes. I expect them even with layering... Have they said that layering = no queue?

This is what all practical testing over the last 10 years tells us.
---
Yeah having addons that reveal cool things you would have otherwise missed can be great.
---
The picture is the icon for the Dazed debuff that mobs inflict to slow you while you're trying to run away.
---
Okay, but that goes back the same point that once you argue you don't need shamans for dps increases then you also don't need pure dps for dps. In any case, an enh shaman as your 6 or 7th, and to a lesser degree 8th, shaman are still much more than their own dps. 
---
So even if you are not min maxing the nature of what shamans provide doesn't change.
---
And its not like moonkins or feral druids whose additional party damage isn't that high (argument for a feral druid in the tank group). Shamans add far more then them. People argue bring a priest with shadoweaving if you have 4+ locks. For most groups a shaman adds more damage than shadow weaving does (i mean thats not true if you have 6 locks, but you get what i am saying).
---
My points stand. If you don't have 7 resto shamans then taking an enh shaman is hardly any dps loss over a pure dps class. (And their loot doesn't pull much from casters, healers, or melee dps so they effectively are cheaper to bring.)
---
Again, always better to bring tons of resto shamans.  But i get it trying hard and getting 50-60% of most of the top dps sucks (I think its higher in this range earlier on for enh, and higher later for ele.)
---
I'm so bored. Every day I wake up and think "what should I do today?" 
---
Boot up my switch? Nothing new. 
---
Boot up xbox? As if.
---
Hang out with friends? Don't have any
---
Hang out with girlfriend? What's that?
---
Play classic? I wish.
---
If it prevents me from sitting in queues for hours and hours on release then I'm fine with it. It's not like you won't see people when leveling, you just won't see all of them. And as long as you don't layer hop too much you should see the same people again. 
---
But even then, the people you meet while leveling on Classic will have a very high probability of not getting past level 20, let alone 60. So "making friends" while leveling won't be as prevalent as it was during vanilla or even on private servers.
---
Yeah i really don't get the rush craze... the whole point of going back to classic is to enjoy the experience again, not be done with it as soon as possible
---
DPS exists for reason other than topping the damage meters? 
---
https://i.imgur.com/LBM55wY.mp4
---
yeah, there was an interview where they said they expected little to no queues. From my understanding that is the main purpose of the layering system to begin with.
---
Honestly this would probably work

Poly &gt; blink &gt; mount &gt; run
---
In my experience younger people (15/16 and up) are better and less annoying than older people (40+). I’ve had two older gents from England in my raid team, those were nice, but otherwise older people have just been a pain to deal with because they can’t take criticism without hurting their pride.

A lot of people want Vanilla WoW forever and absolutely no changes but I think leaving it on 1.13 will eventually cause too many people to get bored and quit. Personally, I've been hoping for new content that fits the style of classic WoW but with modern engine improvements, a lot like OSRS has. An alternate timeline would be something I'd love, we could still go to Outland but an outland designed from the ground up with no connection to the TBC version. Maybe based on the [old WC3 map](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/b/b2/WC3x-A06.jpg?version=10c09248b4c028c1b8e725308e759323) or [Beta WoW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_byHjhTzfSg).
---
Second animation only got a single crit
---
Indeed, I was mere jesting.
---
Oh yesss - it really gives the melee attacks way more weight and impact!
---
While maybe true, we don't know how long it took them to make Ulduar and MC, while iconic, is not a "good" raid. It's just the first and the one most people remember from Vanilla.
---
Shut up and take my upvote!
---
Damn, I thought it would give me tips on what things to take into account when creating a personal Blacklist against streamers.
---
Thanks anyway :)
---
I was around for a couple pserver launches and I loved the initial rush, queues included.  Being packed around so SO many people in a starter zones is just so exciting.  You can see the vibrant full server that is to come.  Frustrating a bit? Sure.  Worth it? Absolutely.
---
Try telling your tank that when he dies and then everyone is doing a 5 minute corpse run in classic bc you broke a sheep. 
---
See how fast you get kicked.
---
Damn, I always thought the plate and mail looked especially good. Though the cloth and leather look pretty bad, imo.
---
It wouldn’t happen as that would be hard to

Implement, and just not worth the time.

Tauntable bosses and almost none of em cleave you dingus. You dont realize how forgiving mc is. There's also this little potion called limited invuln potions, you should look it up. Meanwhile deathwish poops on rapid fire, and execute poops on you sub 20%.

There wont be a single hunter in the top 50, sorry bud

Don't you ever farm ?

Bought gold during Burning Crusade in High School but put my home number as contact. Spent $100 for like 1000 gold. Chinese woman calls my house at 3am asking my mom if she bought gold. She was so confused
---
I came back from vanilla for bfa and I noticed something was off, but now you made it clear.
---
No idea why they changed it..
---
Meh. They'd constantly be trying to tell everyone how superior they are for playing like the Amish.
---
There's probably not enough people that would want this to fill a guild, let alone a server.
---
With my warrior? Rarely.  I had a hunter for farming.
---
&gt; Nameplate Scrolling Combat Text
---
Thank you so much for this! I never liked things like MSBT putting combat text on the sides. This is a MUCH better option than default Blizz!
---
You have my axe.
---
Look back through cdew/venruki/monkeynews vods on the days beta cap was released. Would be pretty easy to work out what their time per level was.
---
I haven't seen adds for illegal gold sites in current wow since early legion. BFA is the first expansion where inflation has declined. From what I have seen buying tokens will quickly drain most players, certainly drained me. Currently a token costs 127k so you have to sell 40 to buy the brutosaur mount.
---
this happened to me, i was the biggest noob. I told my friends "i couldnt control my character and it walked off the edge" and they said yeah u got mind controlled by a priest and remember thinking how cool that is. After that I thought to myself I could never make it into the zone like it was some elitest place where i was too shit to go to, but I just ressed and ran in lol
---
I hope we wind up on the same server.
---
The way 1.12 progressive patching goes is even though it's 1.12 at base, the patches cycle up from 1.1 , although some patch orders are skipped due to being bug fixed which are already implemented in the 1.12 version anyway.
---
If you meant the talent revamps then I wouldn't mind it being the way it was originally , though a lot of the specs weren't functional.
---
In a way my argument is more valid due to it actually existing in the 2004 version of the game, while layering is 100% not something that was created anywhere near the original version.

No.  OP is lying.

Quest your way through the zones for the money, rep, and gear, but take advantage of mob-dense areas and grind, especially if your character is well-suited in a particular location.

Worst quest ever.  Take my damn upvote.

The reason engineering is so powerful is the consumables, like grenades. If you aren't constantly crafting and using them, then engineering isn't a particularly good profession.
---
In addition, lower level stuff might be cheap in the beginning, but after 6 months when most people are at 60, the iron, copper, etc ends up getting pricey.
---
Blizz takes they’re cut in cash though. $20 for a token for a $15 subscription.
---
What kind of retard buys lottery tickets
---
I understand.  That's exactly what I thought at first, but then I figured it was probably only like that much later on after Cataclysm because otherwise, what's going on with Blizzard in the clip makes no sense.
---
As I understand spell batching, it's only for grouping up multiple simultaneous events, like multiple CC or healing spells landing on the same target all within 400ms.  If it was literally only a 400ms update "pulse" on anything and everything, then that would be very obvious, something akin to FFXIV's 3-second global pulse on periodic damage/healing.
---
(Probably 10k gold)
---
I agree. But I do enjoy some of the original design philosophy in vanilla WoW over retail and other modern MMOs. (Not saying those are bad.) But mostly, it is nostalgia and the simplicity of vanilla as to why I'm going to play classic.
---
You do not have beta access, the client is available to download because of the last stress test.
---
Exactly this. Very rarely if ever was rp done when in dungeons. The focus was on the gameplay. The rp came and cities and out exploring. 
---
If Roleplaying is not for you, then to each his own, but is truly does make the world infinitely more interactive
---
Has anyone confirmed this works on classic?
---
Ok - I've been told that even if I completed all the Durotar quests as Undead, I'll only reach around revered before moving on to the next area.. and that cloth hand-in for rep only becomes available in Phase 2. So I don't think it's viable for an Undead to acquire a raptor in Phase 1
---
Such an awesome book. 300 pages of greatness. Couldn’t put it down
---
undead horse stationary jump sound.  press space, press s to backstep to cancel animation, press space... result is an annoying NEIGHH NEIGHHH NEIGHHH to the delight of people around you.
---
no priest ever should talent improved renew. its a minor flat base increase only slightly worth it with max rank renew, even then not really. max rank renew is super mana inefficient and the spell sucks if you don't downrank.
---
The internal cooldown on layer hopping is exactly what i was referring to earlier when I said their change didn't fix it.
---
In one of the utube vids about layering ,there's an asmongold clip where he tests the new layer locking , he goes outside ironforge while in a group with another person and they are literally standing in front of each other on the map but each stuck on a different layer.
---
Although the lock out is a valid idea I feel like it wasn't effectively executed , a better fix would've been to just limit layer hopping to rested areas only, at the very least that way people know exactly when they can layer hop and won't have any shenanigans occur with people phasing out of sight randomly, which is extremely frustrating to see in a classic environment tbh.
---
&gt; I'm curious, do you think there should be progressive itemization 
---
Well , they've tried to pace itemization with the respective content phases, although I wouldn't mind that they don't use the exact way that items were progressed in vanilla , some items on the other hand worry me , their stats being slightly too strong for their respective phase,  having higher defense and stuff on items that didn't have them during a certain patch will make raids feel easier than intended.
---
&gt;   Also your part where you might as well rename classic to BFA makes you look a LITTLE over dramatic don't you think? lol 
---
I feel it's always nice to add a little spice in arguments, especially when the guy whom I was answering seemed especially desperate in his attacks. Though I hope the general idea behind my message wasn't lost.
---
I’m not positive but I think bc introduced faster regen rates and just generally higher xp gains. Also tuned all classes that probably made leveling easier across the board
---
Makes sense.  One of the reasons they're keeping the modern API, if edited a bit.  Though it's fair to argue for keeping the 1.12 API, I don't think many were using totem stomping macros/addons back then, at least from my perspective.  But maybe I was just too naive.
---
So basically, NE add very little to raiding ability (nature resist and 1% dodge...)
---
Humans give 5% spirit, even if its base that is something.  And they also have Desperate Prayer, which is really nice dps or healer CD. Its a free giant heal (10 CD but still) .
---
Dwarves provide So much more and also have Desperate Prayer, Stoneform is really nice, frost resist is nice. Everything but gun spec is nice.
---
Nightelves don't add things for Raiding, however, i think they are a superior PvP race than humans (not in tournaments as you can always have humans 10m CD available). (Shadowmeld is nice on defense or with ganking.) They also are the superior leveling race if not going shadow. As Starshards and wisp are better than 5% spirit. 
---
This is why i typically say Humans are last place priests. The only reason ever to not go Dwarf priest is looks. Drwaven priests are the best priest and they are a soft counter to undead priests 1v1, as they can remove their DP with stoneform and can block MORE fears than WotF can from each other, and they still have a giant free heal. In groups, as you can spread fear wards around, only improving their usefulness over undead. If you are already willing to sacrifice the power of a dwarf for looks, i say do so and play a night elf and get something different in return. Extra pvp defense ability and non shadow leveling ability (its actually good for all specs until 40). 
---
And honestly, while not being a dwarf does limit your ability in 1v1 and a bit in pvp. Its not that bad where your crater is useless. And if you wanna play a priest but not look like crap, i get it. Once TBC roles around everyone gets fear ward so its much closer. Also if classic is Blizlike then you should be able to macro  shadowmeld drink/eat. So if you fear and run away enough to drop combat even if they or a pet is chasing you as soon as combat drops you'll shadowmeld and eat/drink. Its a really nice reset. I mean they'll come and get you but its some nice free mana/healing. Its also nice in pvp in general say you kill someone (or you and your 3 friends do) and your low on mana and you just it the macro and drink and people cannot stop you from far away.
---
thought so :( thanks!
---
I feel like with potential layering abuse the classic wow world first 60 race will be illegitimised due to the potential of aoe farm groups constantly hopping back and forth. 
---
I stand by the claim that layering should be limited to the first two zones. Barrens and Westfall should be where the chaos begins and so it should.
---
*laughs in Shaman*
---
The damage text was more or less the same until some time in Cataclysm. It's not silly to use an example from BC, as he and everyone else who played back then that paid attention would know that this damage text is identical in every way that counts for this thread.
---
Because it's a repost
---
I hope anyone offering gold for a currency/service outside of the game (including a WoW token) gets banned
---
Of course. Taking their cut in WoW gold would be stupid because WoW gold is worthless. The tax in tokens isn't Blizzard's cut.
---
Then this guide isn't for you lol
---
Everyone has a different definition of the word “casual.” Some people equate it with being terrible. Others equate it with having less time to play. Still more simply use it to mean “I have no interest in raiding.” All three are accepted definitions, yet there is absolutely zero overlap in the three definitions. And I’m sure there are other definitions floating around as well.
---
will just have to wait and see what actual sims say, on pservers in bwl gear 1 crit = 17.5 sp for me or something like that so i rounded up to 20, i dont ever see it being more than 30. My point still stands
---
&gt; but I wouldn't expect "There's no driver so insurance is hard" to be an insurmountable obstacle.
---
Harder than you'd think. Very, very long term costs here. But mainly, there is little legal framework for this as of yet. It's not about the companies agreeing. It's about how it's going to be viewed in the eyes of the law. Eventually it will get taken up as a major case and the hammer is going to come down in SOMEONES favor. Until then everyone is going to point fingers at eachother because nobody wants to be responsible for ALL the accidents. It's sort of a critical mass moment. There are so many things that have to happen simultaneously. Built out infrastructure, driving consumer costs down, legal ramifcations. And nobody wants to be the first one in the water.
---
This is 100% my biggest concern with classic right now and always has been. I will be the first to download a mod that fixes it
---
50g per hour is a respectable rate for farming. Game token is what, $15? If you value your e-labor at $5 an hour, that makes $15 worth about 150g.   
---
Worst case scenario, 300g.
---
iirc Ragnaros art assets weren't in the game at launch (neither was the MC attunement quest). That was patched in later. Ragnaros 1.0 was also very buggy, if I remember correctly.
---
And he wants to DPS Shaman.
---
They just fired a bunch of GMs sooo...
---
You have more choices of quest zone at this point to.
---
Nah. Id say only use wowhead or thottbot for help.
---
Though I'll probably use XPerl or ElvUI in lieu of the classic UI.
---
it should be 100% bannable
---
So your solution:  
---
* Doesn't let server communities begin forming pre-launch, as the exact list of servers will end up being an unknown
---
* Will lead to queues on launch day
---
* Splits apart players on day one. You weren't able to create a character in time on the now closed high pop realm, but your friends were? Sorry!
---
* Doesn't account for the early character name reservation window
---
* Involves potential server merges and transfers - which annihilate communities like nothing else
---
* Vastly underestimates the projected size of the launch. 5-6k per server? Early beta stream viewership would indicate that Blizzard is projecting *much higher*. This isn't a typical MMO launch.  
---
I don't mean to shit on you at all. But I think this does highlight just how god damn complicated this situation is, where almost every potential solution is rife with issues.
---
I understand the LFR to mythic dea but if I can do the raid on LFR and see the content I'm basically content with that as in vanilla you only had one version and you had to be apart of a guild if you really wanted to get in there.
---
They came from Everquest where warriors were the only tanks for raid bosses and also could top dps(while tanking). I think they intended for warrior to just scale well with gear like most rpg warriors.
---
I take a stim 5 days a week for hard manual labor. If I take stems to play games, I'd be off my rocker man. Not only does it keep you awake, it keeps you much more focused and articulate. Your time management would become so much more efficient.
---
Shaman damage is fairly pathetic. If you plan on raiding, you should plan on playing resto.
---
It is true that there is a certain subset of players who will react poorly to any criticism, regardless of how polite, well-intentioned, or gently the criticism is offered.
---
There’s also a subset of players who think themselves to have “solved” the “right” way to play the game and anyone who does anything differently is an affront to nature, to be corrected by any means necessary.
---
Personally, I find both groups disagreeable and avoid them as much as possible.
---
Packed zones with chat going wild is fun.  
---
6 hour queues are absolutely not fun, and you're nuts if you say otherwise.  
---
Ideally with layering, we get the former without the latter. All depends on the layer sizes and overall execution (which admittedly is very ambigious).
---
Battle rezing the tank and inervating the healer seems pretty dang useful...
---
The kind that has more money than you.
---
Interesting af my guy
---
Yeah haha. I stopped using it around 2012. Only had a handful of friends using it by then. Most of us had grown up with it till that point.
---
I agree, hunters are assholes. Kek.
---
Man I loved markeedragon. I I sadly did way too much business there.
---
The only real difference is that OP linked a clip if pure crits for the vanilla clip, and then a clip with only a single crit in the newer version. Of course the vanilla one pops out more when every single attack crits.

If they took Pandaria and WoD out, I'd be much happier with the story line.
---
The gold was never secure for a long time, a lot was lost in the process from botting account/selling bans to getting scammed by buyers, etc... The gold they made could disappear in no time.
---
On P99 I got burnt out just leveling one character. 59-60 took me 45 hours. Savagery.
---
... its almost like people prefer the previous proposal from Blizzard over the later one. How is that inconsistent to you?
---
We are called damage dealers not threat dealers muhahaha
---
Because we've seen it before. Use your brain.

Yea.  I think my highest is still at 58 or something after years and I just couldn't do it anymore.
---
Average wage in China is something like $3/hour now, average person earning 11k annualy. Their income has basically quadrupled in the past decade.
---
I rather liked Pandaria. It was the Garrosh story I hated.
---
Most of them don't seem mad about it though.  Most of them know it'll be a necessary evil.  You are, of course, aware that layering is only for a week or two on launch, then gets disabled?
---
That's not true. Tokens are spent on play-time, and many people do this. So it actually removes a ton of gold from the economy, which does indeed reduce inflation.
---
You will have no problems. I joined my guild at 16. Was a pvp guild and I brought a lot to the table. I played with a bunch of foul mouthed people. So I fit right in. A few previous guilds probably thought i was to much. Just feel it out, if it doesn’t fit , move on
---
The first one is pure crits, and the second clip only has one... Bad comparison imo
---
u mean for the pull? or how do you guys use hunters for cthun trash?
---
Yeah the only thing I'm interested in as well. Give me them quests baby!
---
Bots will make a hell of a comeback
---
The best form of healing is resurrection.
---
You are crazy. Druid beats mage all day long
---
It's literally the same font.
---
Use an addon if a microscopic detail like this bothers you that much.
---
Hippie speedball is sativa and coffee
---
This is the really nice thing about Troll spriest with blackout. Unless they do cross faction match ups or you are dueling you don't have to worry about Hardiness.
---
Anyone that's leveling during launch should expect to get slower numbers because they aren't going into 30-40 leveling with great gear on. IE monkeynews had Whirlwind Axe at level 30.
---
Lol of course, you’re right. Sorry I’m high
---
I don't know why, but I find this so satisfying. Maybe I'm just a horrible person.
---
Ughhh..... that’s kind of the worst form, as it implies you died and weren’t contributing to the fight
---
But they would have great gear if they’ve been grinding dungeons, and monkeynews used the weap from armory anyway.
---
yeah that's brutal. good luck!
---
lol, is that because teleports actually get you further?
---
I'm not playing classic because laying is shit.  It is beyond a deal breaker for me.   I'm quiet happy on pservers atm.  I hear a progressive server is coming soon from one of the largest groups.   I refuse to pay $15 a month for a subpar experience.
---
Stacking world buffs was never intended. You're just helping them relive the classic experience.
---
You don’t think the absence of a threat meter would impact other bosses?
---
Name of the new one?
---
Return to Reckoning has mostly T1 and T4 population. You only get a few between T2 and T3 sadly.
---
This is seriously one of the most delusional things I’ve read on this sub. Please get some reading comprehension. I’ve done nothing but tell this guy to NOT gimp his build and you’re over here saying this guy should spec how he wants because respecing costs are nonconsequential, meanwhile you’re talking about getting your gold from an endgame dungeon. Absolutely genius.
---
Hey, did you know you can easily pay for respecs if you just sell 1 arcanite reaper per day? Simple stuff for non noobs like me and you, right?
---
Blizzard could essentially make every public interface lua function to private. To make an addon you'd have to search through the binary and to run it inject code at runtime, effectively "hacking" the game. Not to say that i'd want that or anything.
---
I don’t think it would happen either, but I think it’s an interesting thought.
---
Have fun on Chromaggus.
---
The fight was built around having an addon called decursive.
---
This has a lot of redundant information in it, for people newer to classic/vanilla can better understand the system but if you go the the talent/spec section i have a build there. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/bfvml0/a_good_classic_priest_leveling_guide/
---
Im not trying to tell people how to play, im sorry if you took it that way. I also don't think min/maxing is bad even in classic. I have changed my TLDR section to more accurately reflect this.
---
Pathetic
---
I was mostly trying to point out that new content is unlikely. Everyone has their own point where they think that the game went bad. I still think rotating legacy servers is the best route no one has to stick out the full gauntlet. Something like release TBC, simultaneously release another “Vanilla” server for those that want to drop off. It’s not perfect in many ways it’s probably impractical depending on how many jump ship a new server may not have enough space or it may not be justified.
---
There really is only there paths Blizzard can go.
---
1. Leave Classic as is forever. This will eventually lead to stagnation and like if players.
---
2. Go the Classic+ route. This will require the biggest investment from Blizzard, so probably won't happen.
---
3. Rerelease expansions as they were. This is probably what will happen since it requires less of an investment than new content and will provide "new" content for those that are bored with Classic.
---
Pay to win
---
Which would require a completely separate client that can only connect to that server. Not gonna happen.
---
I do it sometimes in Retail just for fun, it's good practice for... uh... having fun I guess
---
Also helps reduce inflation when there's very little in-game income available relative to WoD/Legion. No more 3000g+ missions at the mission table that you can complete on every character.
---
&gt;aoe farm groups constantly hopping back and forth.
---
I will never understand people that think there will just randomly be a bunch of empty layers for people to jump to to kill mobs.
---
crossroads raid
---
Is it comfy?
---
Was in beta. Everyone saying using dagger shield flametongue is wrong unless you get a dagger with higher dps than your current weapon. Use rockbiter til 60 or windfury at 30. Only use dagger + flametongue if your dagger is higher dps than your current weapon. 
---
IE: 
---
crescent staff from wc with rockbiter did better than any dagger with flametongue with the exception of the 1.3 dagger from BFD which I never got.
---
Some will call bullshit but I swear to god I remember this. What server were you on then?
---
How do you wiggle your little gnome body out of being crippily poisoned?
---
Yes, but, ELIXERS!
---
First of all there is no AH cut on tokens. Second, the gold doesn't leave the economy. It's displaced from one player to another: The person buying it for gold to the person who paid for it with real money. It doesn't disappear into the ether.
---
Downvoting you for being honest and speaking truth.
---
&gt; It still does more dps than shadowbolt because it has a crazy low cast time and scales 100% with spellpower where SB only gets 85%
---
It triggers the 1.5 second global cooldown, so not really that much shorter than SB. If you aren't getting every tick out of corruption (ie: trash mobs) then it's not worth it. If you're standing still able to free cast on a boss it's also not worth it because you're taking up a valuable debuff spot for a personal dps loss or slight gain (depending if you get lucky on nightfall). 
---
&gt; Corruption also gets bonuses from ISB
---
False. Only direct damage shadow spells get increase from ISB
---
&gt; proccing nightfall
---
True, but very RNG dependant and not a reliable source of damage
---
&gt;4-set T3 bonus gives you another 12% damage on your corruption
---
Tier 3 set bonuses are applicable to so few people, and for such a short period of time (relative to the time passed before getting it), it's nearly irrelevant
---
Shattered Hand
---
This, the reason it is so popular and remembered is because it was the _first_ raid in WoW.
---
It's a must honestly. Razer naga is what I've used since about Wrath of the lich king, maybe late TBC. Almost went with a corsair, but my hands are smaller and the naga fits much better.
---
A temporary measure within which all unemployed, guide monkeys could get a character to 60 and collect enough black lotus to retire from farming by phase two... It's broken beyond belief and you shouldn't accept it.
---
That being said, they'll likely fix it by launch so I'm not worried.
---
This is a massive one that's underrated. It might seem silly but it makes your damage feel more visceral.
---
It's really fun and really speeds things up.  All the melee classes can make use of it if they have a slow.  It's most effective for warriors, but shamen can use it with earthbind and/or frostshock.  
---
If you PVP it's a big deal.
---
Epic
---
What are you going to do when blizz shuts down those severs? Host your own?
---
So i guess i could play devils advocate to this post so please dont downvote me into oblivion.
---
The thing with finding like minded people who min max is that things just go quicker and is overall cheaper. Let me explain. You pop 110g's worth of consumes before the boss, pull, wipe. The boss had 10 percent hp left and if everyone had pulled there weight with spending money on consumes or was the right spec we would have killed it. Now because of those people you have to pop another 110g's worth of consumes and that adds another say hour of gold farming to your weekly schedule. And your now instead of finishing both bwl and mc on the same day you now have to ask everyone to come back to your alt raiding day to finish what was already supposed to be done
---
Not really for PvE. They have fixed a lot of the pet issues.
---
Yes but due to the decreased demand of "unofficial gold", farmers have less incentive to farm which slows the rate of new currency generation. This in turn reduces gold inflation
---
Lmao
---
Thinking of buying a new processor/mobo. I'm using like an I5 3 series I think. I most definitely need a new chair. Just not sure what would be good.
---
Idk that seems a little far fetched. 
---
Before we know it, you’re going to suggest OP sends it to us by bouncing invisible information rays off of space-robots.
---
I think the best route for them is to always keep some Vanilla servers. A huge chunk that will play classic hate every expansion.
---
Monk, with Engineering, but another correct answer would of been druid
---
*laughs when you dismount to cast it, then get knocked off by a fish*
---
You had me until mayo on an Italian. I thought we had something. Something real.
---
Ya, totally legit, I agree with you. I am not opposed to min/maxing at all, I apologize if i left that impression. Whatever your guild duties are when you join you should fulfill, if it is min/maxing consumes world buffs, etc then do it, that is what you are there for. 
---
The argument that I am trying to make is for the players that think that you play TO optimize, and that vanilla is the same way. It is my opinion that this is how retail wow is approached, which is not bad I enjoy this fact about retail, and actually enjoy retail. This is, however, not the case in vanilla there are rewards for some people playing and doing things that are deemed sub-optimal.
---
Empty layers? No.  But the majority of people will be questing in X zone while hardcore no life aoe grinding groups will be leveling ahead of the majority by a long shot.
---
If you're thinking you're going to play your Druid like a differently styled Rogue, let me be the first to tell you you'll never come even remotely close to being a Rogue, ever, with any build.  There's a lot of players that are going to want to play a feral "rogue" and are going to be beyond disappointed.
---
They both have stealth and that's where their  similarities end.  I just wanted to make sure someone make that clear before you made a decision.
---
Know what? I'm not even going to bother with someone who's obviously baiting by posting complete nonsense.
---
Yep, likewise. Couldn’t have said it better myself.
---
my who?
---
wall jumping
---
It was really a thing of its time, I traded a lot accounts through their forums in TBC.
---
Just finished my first Warcraft book. Rise of the Horde. Good book.
---
Bought gold in vanilla once to get my mount. Always wondered why blizz didn't just sell it themselves
---
I convince my friend by showing him the hype and explaining how it was so successful. Showing him YouTube videos helped also.
---
&gt; Miss me with waiting 45 minutes do complete a single quest, day 1.
---
layering helps you log in, youll still have 1500 people in your layer. starting zones will still be nuts.
---
Seriously could not imagine playing on a pve server. It literally takes 50% of the fun out the game.
---
A new house
---
The sense of survival-community and dangers of old Duskwood.  
---
Stitches marching down the road sent the entire Duskwood zone into a frenzied panic to defend Darkshire.
---
There will be tons of rogues and comparatively few druids. Plus you've already done rogue once. I think tauren druids are cooler than elfdruids but that's just because I think a horned bear is dope.
---
TLDR might not be telling people how people should play but the rest of your post still does.
---
I believe their plan is to stabilize at 3k max online for phase 2, second hand info though. The numbers specific aren't what's important for my point. Say there is 3 layers, the speed levelers would have 3 times less competition from other speed levelers. 6 layers, 6 times less. 10, 10 times less... Understand?
---
yeah, so tier 3 guild. Already said if you don't mind being a few months behind on gear

No blizzlike?
---
Just be considerate, on time, and willing to follow directions. If you can manage these you’ll be more valuable than most of the classic population.
---
Pick a main, then play the other as an alt, once you’ve progressed through to AQ and start leveling your alt, by the time your alt is 60 you will get super easy gear since it’s so late, it takes a long time to level but having 2 or more 60s is great atleast I think so!
---
I wish people didn’t suck.
---
it may come back just yet.
---
Is it worth it to level cooking and fishing as a mage?  I feel like I could just AOE grind for 10 minutes and buy whatever buffed food I need for a raid.
---
It doesn't, I simply provide an alternative to min/maxing. That there are plenty of great rewards outside of the mainstream of optimization.
---
Druid!
---
You have the option to perform any role (Tank, DPS, Heal) at a high level in PvE. There's a lot of stigma against them, and misinformation, but they really can Main Tank almost all content, be very competitive DPS, and of course be very strong healers.
---
They have very little gear competition for all of their specs, offer unique utility in their CC, Brez, Buffs, Innervate.. and are in demand due to how few of us there are around.
---
They are really the only true hybrid in vanilla, and you can even have certain builds that allow you to swap roles from boss to boss. With the Heart of the Wild build you can tank some fights and heal others! It's so much fun being dynamic and adapting for the situation.
---
They are absolute monsters in PvP too, both in BGs and out in the world. They're a top tier leveling class too!

Just have sharding... the first 20 levels is the first day and a bit. "Oh no! I saw someone disappear! /cry" 21-60 + endgame is about 98% of the game, no point in screwing any part of the over for the 2% that's in the rear view before you can even blink.

On cast time reduction: Incorrect
---
Divine fury in the holy tree decreases cast time by .5 seconds on smite and holy fire (and heals) making the 2.5 second cast spell 2 seconds. ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest)  tier 2 holy divine fury)
---
This is actually better than shadow bolt because shadow bolt goes from 3 to 2.5 instead of 2.5 to 2 so the cast time reduction is larger percentage-wise, but the coefficient is based on the original cast time.
---
3 / 3.5 \~ 85.7%         for shadow bolt
---
2.5 / 3.5 \~ 71.4%      for smite
---
The first point they recast at the same time talented is 10 seconds so 2 times 5 for smite and 2.5 time 4 for shadow bolt
---
.714 \* 5 = 3.57 \* spell power in 10 seconds for smite
---
.857 \* 4 = 3.428 \* spell power in 10 seconds for shadow bolt
---
You are right on the crit thing though.

"Play what you like to play the most"  then reroll after some months in to the game after noticing you will never raid in some specs, can you raid as ret paly, boomkin druid, shadow priest, melee hunter ect? Well prob 1 in 100 the 99 left will be forced to respec or reroll so please stop missleading players using that rosetinted statement.

Not sure if this is from vanilla, but the Shadow Priest Mana Mana clip is one of my favorites!

Say what you want about Retail, but [this thing](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168419/comfortable-riders-barding) improved my gaming experience tenfold.
---
Dude, no one will read that whole shit man....
---
I honestly think that raiding will be way easier this time around and min maxing races won't matter because everyone knows the best gear, consumables, and buffs. A lot of it will be brought to raid because people needed something to do on the days leading up to the raid.
---
You got it completely backwards.
---
&gt;The result is unquestionable: the dev has no other option than selling power items to the players. You can cry, you can whine, you can change all the guild icons to P2W, it counts for nothing. You are a tiny minority and the majority just want to buy the privilege of winning. The devs aren’t evil or greedy or want a cash-grab. The MMO scene started with $15/month subscription for everyone, a fair and completely P2W-free scheme. And then the players started to buy power from illicit sellers, even at the risk of being banned. This is another proof: players rather lose their account than play without purchased power. So the players forced the devs to give up on the fair subscription model and start to either sell power in the cash shop or allow players to trade subscription token for in-game credits. Please note that these methods (illicit RMT, cash shop and token trade) are equal for the buying player, while cash shop is clearly the best for the devs.
---
&gt;**Trying to do token trade is a desperate last stand of the devs to keep some fairness in the game against the will of the players.** If they wanted cash-grab, they would just sell in-game credits in the shop for rates that would dwarf farming. Yet they get constant abuse from the “fairness” minority. Unfortunately this minority isn’t big enough to upkeep even a single subscription + cosmetic shop server, otherwise devs would make one for them.
---
Jesus... Save it for your blog, mate.
---
You won't use it for starters. You planning on healing?
---
The layout seems less odd, k owing that it was originally circular.
---
2007 me holds a newfound grudge against the decision to remove that bypass. So much running the empty instance in reverse.
---
Not to side track, but at first glance I thought your title was “I’m stuck between a rogue and a hard place.” It made me laugh enough to want to share.
---
That's up to you.  There are places you can make a lot of gold fishing (such as ZG).  As a warlock I'll be using it for leveling for those mp5/hp5 buffs stacking with demon armor.  Also sometimes fishing is just a way to do a mind dump and relax for a bit.
---
As a warlock I plan to start leveling the two at around level 30, with the idea of cooking Nightfin Soup and Poached Sunscale Salmost to stack with demon armor and troll's blood potions.  I'll be running 39 hp5 and 8 extra mp5.  I'll be even more of a mana battery than warlocks already are.
---
Nice guide! As mentioned by others I’d like to see you do one that doesn’t go the fishing route.
---
I usually put fishing off until the end when I level a toon, only because of the time involved.
---
Against layering, WoW had a perfectly good system for new servers with overspawn code for early leveling zones. I know about 90% of people didnt actually ever experience this on this reddit, because Ive brought this point up numerous times in the past and the vast majority of commenters simply deny its existence, or state that its the much slower pserver rates of dynamic respawns. Opinion has changed since Mark Kern confirmed this was the case on a [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/grummz_em8er/clip/BloodySpinelessEyeballTebowing?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) last month.
---
Leave it as it was, some of my fondest memories of WoW was starting on new servers with the mass chaos of everyone rushing out of the gates. Except for the very first few HOURS of server launches, there was 0 wait time for mobs or quest objectives, mobs spawned literally within seconds of killing them. It was so fast that if you wanted to eat or drink, you had to pull mobs away from where they spawned to kill them to exit combat.
---
This was the vanilla solution, by the original devs and was part of the feel of rolling new servers. I know a majority of people rolled on older servers where the leveling areas populations werent swelled, but you literally just have to wait for the server to develop if you dont want to be part of the initial race, literally the definition of a mature server.
---
Just say no to meme specs.
---
&gt;First as far as I know the world record for the fastes 0-60 leveling was 4 days, 20 hours. and 52 mins of game time.
---
Joana, who holds that record, is expecting 20 hours or so faster. There are MANY players who anticipate sub 100 hours.
---
Even with 6-8 hours of sleep a night, at 100 hours, you're hitting level 60 with 50, 60 hours before the first reset.
---
Totally gonna happen.
---
What book is this?
---
I'd love to see that. Any proof? 
---
And the integrity of Classic servers? It seems likely people in the hardcore group of people playing on WoW classic serves would be admins on the serve and be able to kill bosses like GMs at will and hand out loot. IE, private serves can't be proof of a less than 10 day rag kill since you can't prove it was done without cheating.
---
As someone that played PvE, it sounds like you should play PvP.
---
karazhan would like to have a word with you.
---
Why are you planning to fish hillsbrad as alliance? that seems wildly impractical. 
---
If you are alliance, you can just start in elwynn (assuming basically every alliance character eventually shows up in elwynn to do deadmines and the ones that don't need to get to stranglethorn anyways for the book), Then fish the elwynn river bank on the westfall side, and the elwynn river bank on the duskwood side. that's 150 skill right there, then you go quest for a bit until the 1 gold for the book is not a ruinous price, and go over to stranglethorn for the book and you can fish some mithril head trout to eat from 25-35.
---
Just say no to memes?
---
Plus warstomp. Everybody loves Warstomp.
---
We know nothing about raid damage, but if its similar to dungeons in beta everything will be way easier with the lower armor, health and damage. 7 days seems tough because of the leveling, you probably need 12-14 hours and some luck to get your MT. No one else really needs gear. Under 10 100%, my personal guess is about 8 1/2
---
I said while leveling??
---
Don't bring sense into this. Legendary Hammer of Ragnaros hitting you in head wont daze you, boar hitting with with their nose will
---
Y2k all over again shit here we go
---
Asking for proof and also saying the only way they did it is because they are admins of the pserver and give themselves loot. Wtf are you babbling about?
---
In a way doesn't matter. It about when about all 40 of a group like method get to 60; not when the first one does, or even the first 10, or event he first 25. 
---
I can imagine someone beating Joanna record; but no way anyone does it by much more than 20 hours. But this is really a question of when more or less all 40 of a group like Method get to 60; not just a few.
---
The main difficulty is doing the quests for dousing in time. Double-check the questline for that because that's what might make it actually impossible.
---
Sounds efficient.  I"ll look into it and see how it works out.  I'm pretty satisfied with the horde routing, but I haven't done as much experimentation on the alliance side.
---
It an example, play what you like but you cant expect others players to agree and group with you, "play what you like sounds cool" and its also missleading n00bs in to leave the game after they notice X spec is not optimal and he has hard time reaching his goals after thousand of hours spent in the game, so play what you want depending on your goals
---
As a druid you'll be a healer in raids. If that's good for you then druid all the way! If not then reconsider rogue.
---
Preach baby boy! 
---
Very rarely does someone choose a class based on what others are doing and they main that 1 character for months/years... they always end up being disappointed and feel like "the other class is always better"

It could be kind of interesting to start a clan called Misfits. You aren't allowed to play a cookie cutter raid spec.
---
Oh shit I've used AAP in retail and it's insanely good. I didn't know it had a version for classic, I'm gonna have to check it out, thank you! The best part about AAP is the arrow navigated you around mountains and stuff, I wonder if it does that in vanilla
---
The amount of beta males that make invalid points defending blizzard never ceases to amaze. Nicely Done.

A friend and I created a discord server and we design custom emoji requests for our friends and made a space for people to get to know each other and talk about their day. Myself and the co-gm make sure to keep the general chat very chatty and welcoming and that appeals to a lot of people who simply want to connect with others and make internet friends.
---
We have about 30 members right now in the discord, most of whom intend to start classic and 10 of whom are very active in chat; I suspect about five or so are dedicated enough to actually make it to MC. We'll have to recruit hard but i have high hopes we will be a successful starting guild for friendly folks looking for nostalgia and progression.
---
I read this in like 3 minutes on a cell phone I dunno what people are complaining about. Glad to know, this is what I want from Classic.

Private serves are known for people who own them doing whatever the hell they want when they want. It isn't an environment you can even expect people to not cheat on some level and there are usually tons of bonuses to leveling and other stuff to incentive people to play on low pop private serves. 
---
\&gt; Do you think MC is a difficult instance? 
---
Mechanically; No. But Is it hard for people who are completely under geared to do any content regardless of mechanics? Yes; because the numbers involved don't care about 'skill' the way the mechanics usually do. You either have the DPS to kill the boss before an enrage timer or you run out of mana, you have the tank that doesn't get one shot or 2 shot too fast, etc. That part is down to numbers and gear more than skill.
---
Different servers had different gold rates. Gotta remember that.
---
I'm sorry, are you new to the internet? 
---
Xx
---
I get your point - but typically "a few people" would be ahead of the pack like that back in the day - with 2019 being the way it is - more gamers exist that want to push their bodies into sleep deprivation just to say they did something first... (which nobody will care about 2 months into the game)
---
I can easily see a very populated realm having hundreds of players level 60 within the first few days because they won't sleep / have multiple people running characters.
---
The drop rate wasn't bad there but with a few people doing the quest it's not even happening. I completely skipped the entire chain because after doing all of the quests for 40 minutes I didn't see a single live vulture.
---
Ah the good old days. I actually made quite alot of money buying gold back then. 
---
Now you might wonder how I would earn money buying expensive gold from china. Growing up I quickly learned that I many times could buy stuff and find someone that would pay me more than the initial investment. Same goes for gold. 
---
I was 15 when WoW launched. I was really a nolife farmer being in Tyrs hand probably 3-4 hours every day. I rememeber also doing alot of «chest runs» around Andorhal (the town in Western Plaguelands). 
---
Anyways as in most schools back then, tons of us was playing WoW. And some guys asked if they could buy 200g-400g etc. In the start I had enough gold for those asking. I sold gold at the price of 200g = 100 NOK which is around 11-12 USD. Fast forward a few months, I had nowhere near enough gold to keep up with the demand. 
---
For one order of 800g I tried buying gold from china. I used my moms visa card. I discovered that this was legit. And my profit when I sold it at school was 2x the amount I payed china. I kept buying gold from china and selling it for double the price at school for the remainder of Vanilla WoW. It actually turned out to be of such a volume that my mom would want "cuts" of the profits since I was using her card. I never really kept track of what it in total ended up being in profits, but I am sure it was at least 3000 USD. I spent it all on food/candy in the school cafeteria. Not the best use of the cash, but hey - I was young :D 
---
Gold is really such a valueable resource in Classic WoW that I am sure Chinese farmers was very happy when Classic was announced. This time around gold is even more valueable considering the obscure gold needed if you want to maximize raid potential using consumeables, pots, buffs etc.
---
THIS MUST BE IN THE GAME PLEASE
---
&gt;Second after hitting 60 you'd need to do a fair bit of farming the lvl 5 mans and UBERS 15 man for all the blue gear for MC. 
---
You really don't need that much gear- you'll spam LBRS runs to try to get an UBRS key so you can do the quest to kill the pyroguard because he's part of the aqual rune quest.
---
&gt;Fourth is another big obstacle; you need Hydraxian Rep to get the bottle that lets you put out the ruins and summon Rag. I actually have no idea how long it would tank to grind that rep but you only got it from killing stuff in MC. 
---
You can AOE farm elementals in silithus for rep
---
&gt;A particular challenge is that the MT for Rag needs a lot of fire resistance gear
---
True
---
&gt;Back in the day this was done by crafting dark Iron gear with required a ton of Rep with some faction and a bunch of materials from MC trash. 
---
If you mean the Epic Dark Iron Gear like [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Iron_Helm) (which I'm guessing you are because you talk about needing MC trash) this wasn't actually added until later- BWL patch to be specific. What tanks need to gear fire res are +fire resistance greens- obviously dark iron would be better but you don't need to farm it.
---
&gt;Personally I think Rag will not fall until around day 15
---
Day 7 at most IMO
---
I plan on playing the worst pure DPS class with the most bugs because that is the class that is most fun to me. Luckily, I'll still be able to raid, because the abilities of the class are needed for certain fights.
---
HR people are the worst, tbh.
---
So true. It seemed like higher pop meant high rates in gold. High/Full was like $15-20 for 5k a med/low was $10 for 5k
---
I remember using these as a rogue in AV.  I would hide in our throne room and as soon as the enemy tank pulled I would knock him down and watch them raidwipe as the boss dropped aggro on the tank and took out the closest healers.
---
That's super nit picky and you know it but you're right all time peak wasn't the correct, but cataclysms all time peak was definitely caused by it which is starkly shown by that huge drop once people experienced the expansion.  
---
Cataclysm destroyed WoW on a level that I've not seen in many games besides maybe NGE in starwars oddly enough trying to copy WoW lol.
---
Just pointing out your bullshit. That's all.
---
We will cross our fingers! I think starting with any interest at all is strong so we are hopeful.
---
Important data for future generations.  When I will be the 4873th player to reach lvl 60, they need to know that it was all possible without any special purchases
---
equip nightfall
---
spam wingclip
---
Yeah thats crazy bro. Gonna be getting my shaman to 60 then im thinking either a rogue or a warrior tough decisions
---
Wait this is why people are upset? I've always done it this way on private servers...
---
Love a good gold roll. Won and lost plenty of gold that way
---
That’s so awesome, I’m sure he just wanted to make your day being that you were a kid, I remember during TBC I was killing mobs in zangarmarsh and they were bugging and wouldn’t die, so I reported it and a GM answered my ticket a little while later and asked me to go back and kill some more of the mobs, so I rounded up like 4 or 5, being a frost mage, and proceeded to AoE them down, well I ended up getting some ads and I almost died, and I suddenly went up to full health and mana and the GM was like “oops I see you were having some trouble, I hope this helped” and I killed them all and they weren’t bugged anymore and life was good, I was awestruck by the power the GM had to make me not die and waste his time lol, cool story dude!
---
I got more than an entire level killing those oozes my first character.
---
I don't think I ever did it again in vanilla, although I know I did at least once pre-Cata
---
No problem! I fell in love when I found it because I really don't think OG combat text works in modern WoW as it is. It also can also display stuff that affects you on the personal nameplate if you use that. Thanks to Justwait for making it (and BigWigs!)
---
Haha nice that's awesome
---
They're literal gods amongst men
---
For a hunter.   Add another day played for a warrior.
---
Yeah a bunch of guilds are shooting for it. Not shure if its gonna happen first week but maybe 70% chance i give.
---
Second rester absolutley 1000% a few guilds will have withour a doubt
---
Yeah but $100 for 1000 gold was definitely not the best price, regardless of server.
---
Gotta remember bro, most of these people here havent seen the spergs from private go in. Id say its pretty likeley its done week one. 10000% chance done by week two not even a question
---
Subtract 12 hours with the 60 hunters / mages powerleveling the warriors. I main paladin, and have hit 110s for the past few tests I've done.
---
It's nitpicky that I point out a fact? I'm not arguing against your main point but you should be aware of that language you are using. In fact I agree with it. If you look at the point Activision acquired Blizzard, it actually strongly correlates with the beginning of the decline of the game. They likely had content developed for Wrath before the acquisition but it's clear that the playerbase noticed a dip in the quality they had come to expect from Blizzard after that point and started to jump ship. Yes, Catacylsm did damage to the integrity of the game but it is naive to ignore that the trend clearly gained a lot of traction in WotLK itself.
---
Not to mention at which timeframe of BC.
---
I could imagine it’d be a lot more expensive the month after release compared to during Sunwell.
---
Evade tanking Rag when tank dies at 1% wooo
---
Edge of your seat shit
---
Honestly the game is better with then imo. Plus the vanilla UI is absolutely terrible.
---
No I don't. But you want something that didn't exist in the version of the game we're getting. It's not going to happen. Get over it.
---
It's not impossible to do, but anyone that does it in a week almost certainly cheated by using multiple people on the same account.
---
Pay to win will always be in the game. The only difference is whether you're okay with a black market that steals people's identities and ruins their lives, or a legitimate, regulated market where players' safety is a priority.
---
https://discord.gg/pp93tu
---
Then the word 'classic' basically has no meaning in this situation.
---
I don't know where that is, as i have seen a few of them. But most of the ones i have seen never account for the 3rd or 4th factors. What they do is look at damage per mana. And sometimes damage per mana +coefficient of the spell. But typically they don't consider the damage per mana per Total CAST TIME and Mana spending times with coefficients.
---
So you'll see maths on Mind Flay and it will be 426 (+45%) / 205  = 2.08 damage per mana (DpM) with 0 SP
---
@200 SP this would be 2.52 DpM. Now thats is great, however, You should consider cast time and mana regen. So over 3 seconds this is  0.84 Damage per Mana per second (DpMS).
---
However, this still doesn't account that you spend that mana at the start of the three seconds with channeling abilities. This varies depending on if you are stacking spirit or how much mp5 you have but you can get 70-80 mp2 (per tick) pretty easily. We will say 35 mpsecond for this.
---
This means Mind Flay  now is 426 (+90) = 516 Damage
---
205 - (35x3) = 100 mana cost if Mind flay is your last mana spending ability. So now its 516/100 so 5.16 dpm and 1.72 DpMS. VERY good skill. Even if you take out the spell power its very good on mana. (Note Mind Flay is far worse at lower levels its mana cost is very high and base damage very low, they just made the versions at 36 and even more at 44+ much better.)
---
Lets look at Smites. 
---
Smite - Talented is for cast speed 2.0s 393 (+71.42%) and 280 mana. 
---
393/280 this is 1.4 DpM (Bad), DpMS is 0.7 which is closer to mind flay.
---
@200 Sp: 536/280 = 1.91 DpM and a DpMS of 0.96 Here we can see that (not considering the massive buffs to shadow damage). The DpMS of smite is higher at 200 Sp but only if the person is constantly casting. If they cast just one Mind Flay, it has almost twice the amount of damage per mana per second as Smite. 
---
Now you have to look at the entire rotation. This is why people who say Mind Blast is bad are wrong. As its a 1.5 cast you remove 0.5 worth of mana regen from its base cost. When you do that it ends up more right in line with 2.0 cast speed Smite (talent) and it allows you to start Wanding 0.5 seconds faster also increasing its dps. SWP is similar.
---
So Shadow might lead with a HF at times, but MB-SWP-MF-Wand is typical Thats 0-1.5-0-wanding for mana spending time or 1.5 seconds. In casting time its 1.5-1.5-3-wanding or 6seconds. 
---
Compare this to Holy's Smite-Smite-Smite-Wand. This is 0-2.0-2.0-wanding or 4 seconds of mana spending time. This means right here shadow gets an additional 2.5 seconds worth of full mana regen. The cast time is 6 seconds also. 
---
watch what happens if you play Holy like people play shadow: Smite-MB-SWP-Wand. 0-1.5-0 or 1.5 seconds of mana spending time. See people way overlook this. Now you could add another smite, or alternate between mobs. The cast time is 2-1.5-1.5-Wand or 5seconds. This means you also get 1 second worth of extra wand dps which isn't small.
---
Additionally, if you look that these cast times from the perspective of mob aggro (when you first hit the mob). The holy using SWP and MB has only a 3s cast time verses Shadow's 4.5s and 3xsmite's 4s. This means you start applying wand damage (additional damage) faster. Now leading with Holy fire changes this but as you know if you have Spirit Tap up you don't want to waste 1 second casting it over an "empowered" Smite. Still its viable and changes this a bit.
---
Do you see why smite spam isn't always ideal? This isn't to say its bad. Its actual DPS is very high. Things also change at higher spell damage as smites have much better scaling. But don't forget Shadow gets an always 25% increase of damage and another possible 15% from shadow weaving. 
---
Still Spiritual Guidance provides some early and good amount of +spell that really helps holy specs (as this buffs all your abilities. Smite (71%), SWP (100%), Shadowgaurd(80% nice), Starshards (100% crazy), Heal (86%), and Greater Heal (86%) are your best scaling abilities.
---
If anyone has good videos that really encapsulate the hype of wow in a concise way please lmk
---
Where can i buy this book ?
---
&gt; deinstalled
---
what?
---
Fair enough, it’s not for everyone :)
---
Yeah it was poorly worded cause I was trying to be brief. I didn't mean hybrid "versatility" tax, which I agree is shit in vanilla (there should still be a hybrid tax, but it should be pretty minor). I just meant versatility on how you decide to orient your character. Those choices should be sticky, otherwise talents are meaningless. It's analogous to how meaningless gear is in the modern game because there's so much of it coming at you constantly.
---
Yes thats why most guilds raid with fury warriors as tanks and shadow priests + ehn shaman as healers
---
I’m gonna go ahead and assume you don’t do anything involving servers or data management for a living.
---
There’s no perfect advice for something like this, but here’s what I got:
---
If you’re anything like most of us your probably going to end up rolling both in due time if they both are something that you’re excited about. My advice would be to start with the Rogue. You have this clear, fun, and exciting vision for the character. You would be re rolling your original class which will be full of nostalgia when you dip back into this game. I think that could make for an exciting re entry. Later on you can roll the Druid after exploring a bit as your rogue and getting that first taste of classic. 
---
That’s what I’ve got. Either way you’re going to have a blast :)
---
The amount of retards that are incapable of any sort of critical thinking never ceases to amaze. Nicely done.
---
You expect the same company that’s directing the secs on classic not to fuck up what they already fucked up once?  There’s a clear reason they want it to run on the current engine, so they can hit a switch and poof store is in along with the lfr/lfd. 
---
Granted they may not enable these, but the option will be there on the current core engine.
---
on my server the cheapest they go is 80g, if they're 15g, thats actually amazing for making gold cause you can just prospect them for jewels. Make mad money by selling the gems.
---
What server you on, I might slide over there with a wow token and make a few 100k really quick
---
I might be over estimating it but you are definitely underestimating it. 
---
DPS potential frankly is more down to gear than skill for the most part and their gear is going to be crap; not to mention at level 55 you couldn't even equip enough pieces of the tier 1 dungeon set to even get the 6 piece bonus... If this is somehow down in a week it would be with a full 60 raid geared to the pinnacle of what is possible and even then probably not likely.
---
tier sets good for pvp druid, got all the stats.
---
Yes, and no, respectively.
---
If the fastest level time was 4 days back in whenever fuck land its not going to be 7 days. Unless 40 people play 24/7 I don't see it happening.
---
Most guilds do run with fury warriors that tank OMEGALUL
---
&gt; There’s a clear reason they want it to run on the current engine, so they can hit a switch and poof store is in along with the lfr/lfd.
---
No, it's mostly security The in-game store *is* going to be in Classic already, for realm transfers.
---
According to Joanas website, they are attempting to work with a programmer to make an addon. 
---
I've been running characters through the guide on a private to practice. It could be the server or my playstyle or maybe just the guide, but I'm often half a level below where the guide says you should be.
---
FUCK SHIMMERING FLATS VULTURE.. FUCK THAT IN THE ASS! literally took HOURS to complete.
---
Can't win them all, a majority of the other professions do have great gold making, especially in the new patches
---
You can't read, go play pokemon go and fling pokeballs.
---
Depends on how long layering stays in the game also.
---
Rogue
---
And you sound like someone who likes to lie to himself, let me know your raid composition please, lets see if you put your money where your mouth is
---
I can hear the ventrilo through this.
---
Here's the thing about BiS lists: A lot of them are done in a incredibly lazy manner. These shallow lists usually don't reflect items that are way easier to get for nearly similar effectiveness.  
---
We have had 3 people in a previous guild (well, we didn't have those people for long) who refused to gather items that were not on their BiS lists even though they were massive upgrades over whatever shit they already had.
---
Most BiS items are super contested and you can get something very close to them for way less effort. For example, instead of going for Blackcrow (LBRS) and Dal'Rend's set (UBRS) as a somewhat fresh lvl 60... why not go strat UD instead? You can get Carapace Spine Crossbow, a ranged weapon that's actually slightly higher damage and has a slightly better speed but you lose 1% hit. You can get Bone slicing hatchets there, which are worse than Dal'rend's but other than DR barely anyone will roll against you on them and surely nobody will complain about you winning them. You can also get other good items like your BiS cloak there.  
---
And before anyone says something about him lacking hit because of no Blackcrow: Just use the damn Trueaim gauntlets! This item alone (drops from the Blackcrow boss btw) provides over 3% hit, just equip it for the 3 fights where your hit actually needs to be capped.
---
Once you have your close-to-bis you can use your time to get other things done like farming consumables for the first MC runs. And nothing stops you from still joining runs for your BiS once you have your close-to-bis. But you don't need to kill yourself by running LBRS 50 times while neglecting other things you could do, including having fun.
---
Oh that's good to know, thanks. I've had pretty good luck with his guide but I do a lot of random grinding and mining which leads to killing a lot of out of the way mobs, that could be it. I just know I didn't realize until recently that Vanillaguide was based on TBC XP values so it just randomly says "you should be X level now" and you're actually 1.5-2 levels behind.
---
It's worthless because hypothetically, anyone could do it.  Everyone else just chooses not to, because it's dumb.
---
But they're also doing it by cheating, which kind of defeats what little worth there is to it.
---
1 minutes
---
There are mutliple guilds out there shooting for it. Seriously dont doubt it man theres a high chance its gonna happen
---
I get it, you want something different. This won't be that, unfortunately. Good blood, and the wind at your back.
---
kill yourself retard
---
Still a good recipe as clam meat is over abundant and you should use it as much as possible.
---
Played there for some months but they seem more interested in making changes to the game rather then trying to restore the original.
---
I'll break it down as simply as I can. Layering is not an authentic experience. The problem is that having 1,000 players per starting zone isn't an authentic experience either. Fighting 50 players for each boar spawn sounds terrible. Since neither option will be authentic, let's at least have the experience be fun. Gotta go with layering.
---
Server 15 on the last stress test gave me a whole new appreciation for the word “stress” when it comes to leveling on a heavily populated server. So, I’m giving an exploration strategy similar to your own some serious consideration.
---
In particular, I could see exploration being very effective for any players planning on multiboxing another character at the same time. Exploration experience doesn’t get halved while leveling in a group, so both characters would benefit equally. And when you get to those Sathrah/Vagash/Hogger spots, you already have the built-in group needed to overcome those encounters.
---
I thought of one possible improvement to your exploration strategy. Have you considered skinning? For 92 copper, you can start killing/skinning all critters (rabbits, deer, cows, rams) along your route in addition to skinnable corpses left behind by other players. That would really help with your initial money gathering in those early levels.
---
How do these ppl not have a job?
---
Ive roleplayed in wow for over a decade. Why do people want rppvp realms? When you roleplay, you typically -dont- wear gear made for pve NOR pvp.
---
This means that when you and your Night's Watch guild head to darkshire to do some fun rp events, you're gonna get it ruined by a gang of hordies named stuff like Xxepicpvp or Istabulol. How is that immersive? When someone who isnt roleplaying prevents you from roleplaying in the big world.
---
I have a feeling people want rppvp servers because they're retail griefers who want an easy target to bully. Im staying on normal PvP so i can actually RP in the world.
---
What? My friend bought 1000 gold for 30 bucks shortly after launch.
---
No, they released fresh servers without the AQ gates open. A bunch of people transferred to them to get the Scarab Lord mount.
---
Why not? They’re already doing progressive item releases with content patches, why can’t they do the same with mounts(that are items)?
---
Don’t forget Susan92
---
Ni hao
---
I had fun in MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20.  Of importance is that there is buff overwriting, so a more powerful renew will overwrite an existing one.  This allows meta stuff like coordinating who will take improved renew or not. I suspect it will be a lot harder in classic if they don’t allow the old-school decursive and CT mods that auto-canceled heals.  In a 40 man raid, here’s a lot of coordination required, and it was fun working out who was on whom in our priest channel.
---
Just because I said people will beg for WoW tokens in the face of Chinese gold sellers and that the latter would be better than the former does not mean I want WoW tokens.
---
Nor have I ever said a lack of LFG will be the death of classic.
---
Your reading comprehension is as low as the karma you've got for this post.
---
Because it's fucking retarded and bullshit. That's why.
---
your question is how much classic gold can you buy with $15, that will vary depending on time but most importantly get you banned.
---
Trading Wow Diary pages 23, 7, 13 for 15
---
Lol nice to see that you've made an alt account.
---
each and every WoW player should have this book
---
&gt; The best form of healing is ~~resurrection~~ never taking the damage in the first place.
---
Because there's a difference between progressively adding content and items to the game and adding items only to remove them later. There isn't a single item in Classic that will ever get removed. And every item that was removed by 1.12 won't ever be available in Classic.
---
I died laughing at the last line 😂
---
Why?
---
Just implying buying gold from a third party is more efficient than grinding it yourself. gave me a nostalgia trip I guess you could say.
---
It's not that bad. I've purchased xpacs with gold lately as well as some other stuff on bnet. Couldn't go both ways with Chinese farmers
---
When can we expect the movie on Netflix?
---
I’ll be disappointed if they dont
---
Cross-realm zones? No way Blizzard is ever adding that to Classic.
---
I bought gold in vanilla once and never got banned.
---
It takes a few minutes to buy gold from a third party. It would take hours or even days to grind the same amount of gold. So yeah, it's much more efficient.
---
I have zero intention of farming for gold in Classic ever. I'll buy as much as I want whenever I want and just do the things in-game I enjoy.
---
Easy way to not be taken seriously? Use would of been
---
I'd really like to see a variation that is merely active in non-contested zones, and stops there. By the time you reach the barrens/westall people will have spread out quite enough to avoid the giant wall of people trying to do starter quests, and it could be removed when needed later
---
dude I'm pretty sure thats the site I used in vanilla and BC. They had good deals for the realm I was on it seemed.
---
Countless times where I'm minding my own business, gingerly running along to my next quest, then suddenly aggroing every living thing possible in the whole region, getting instantly dazed from the first hit, getting triggered, deciding to turn around and teach those basic forms of AI a lesson, only to be absolutely melted down because I underestimated them from the rage.
---
The game can be cruel sometimes.
---
Doubtful.  The locks is still effectively cheating. 
---
Let's say you are running a marathon that lasted several days.  You aren't required to sleep.  You place helpers along the track to periodically give you a skateboard.  Also, at night, someone carries you while you sleep.  You might cross the finish line first, but you cheated to get there.
---
ps:  The "skill" required is basically nil.  The time required is high.  How the fuck do so many people not have a life or a job?
---
God damn screw warrior and hunter, imma roll warlock again on classic :D
---
I thought it was agreed on that the reason for layering had little to nothing to do with the starting zone experience and that this was a measure to avoid dead servers in 3 months when the tourists have left?
---
All the comments I've read so far discuss this in relation to those first few zones.
---
Let me know if I'm wrong, but could someone link the 'true' reason for æayering, if one such has in fact been stated by blizzard?
---
The issue that I understand layering to help fix is to essentially overpopulate a server in the beginning such that when 50% have left after a couple of months layering can be removed and the server still has a healthy population.
---
Bonus:
---
Personally I would have preferred a different solution. 
---
Create Sargeras-EU-1, Sargeras-EU-2, 3 etc
---
After 3 months servers will be merged if they contain too few people, or just renamed if they contained enough players themselves. 
---
(Names would be unique across all 'numbers/versions', or freed up on rename)
---
I guess you saw a mirror because none of that applies not even the slightest.
---
It doesn't make sense, You rekt yourself by liking something moronic.
---
Whether it is intended or not, high dps is the most powerful utility you can bring to an encounter.
---
What's it like having blizzard deepthroating you?
---
That's called selling.
---
I will raid as an elemental shaman.
---
In a single player environment, yeah it is that obvious. But once you put people in a group, some people just don't think and autopilot their role. Or just don't think it matters since the tank's job is, according to them, only to keep aggro while the healers keep him alive.
---
I probably could have worded that better cuz I agree with you here. Regardless, I’m looking forward to raiding MC and, hopefully, all of the Vanilla raids
---
That said. Sacced Succubus and improved shadow bolt probably get thrown into this... I think I remember that things like Shadow Mastery don't improve your coefficient... but a buff on yourself and a debuff on your target might...
---
I should look that up at some point lol
---
Either 4 hours of sleep each night or all nighters alternating with a full night's sleep are easy to pull off. Hell, I had a much worse sleep schedule during some exam periods.
---
This attitude is how you end up with your daughter or son spending $80,000 at a private college for a degree feminist dance therapy and then moving back home because they can't find employment.
---
40 man raid, computers back then... chances are the raiders would be running such low settings any art or decor wouldn't even draw in, I know I did. Plus if you were a healer you stared at green bars anyway.
---
Onslought Made it pretty clear on the countdown to classic podcast what it takes to pull this of.
---
It's not 100% guaranteed that they will succeed, but it's definitely doable.
---
Ulduar was seriously something special. My friends and I did it in hard mode together after the core of our 25 man guild died and it still felt seriously epic and rewarding.
---
Ulduar is one of the highlights of wow. Just like MC too.
---
Yeah, and early season it was also impossible to remove cyclone with pvp trinket or even paladin bubble.
---
Most top guilds on the private servers appreciate trash damage more than concentrated damage vs. Single targets ( eg. Bosses) past AQ40
---
&gt; who is nice, helpful and fun to play with
---
Then they wouldn't be playing boomkin, though.
---
It's alarming that the majority of comments in this thread are completely misrepresenting layering and the reason it's around. Most of the critics and supporters seem to think that it's sharding and is being implemented for the same reasons sharding was.
---
Spriest is my fav class in all of wow, but considering respec costs and without having unlimited time to grind pvp ranks, how can I really get pvp gear?
---
Obv dps specs would dps, tank specs would tank, healer specs would heal. I don’t mean anything like fury warrior main tank. I just don’t understand the casual elitist for classic wow... if there’s a class/race you want to play, then play it. If it’s in the game, then use it if you’d like to. 
---
If you decided to play shadow priest, why would you sign up to heal a raid?? I don’t think people would generally choose to do so...but hey maybe I’m wrong. 
---
But I guess it doesn’t matter either way, classic is yet to drop, things will go as they go. Just play how ever you want to, it’s just a game, suppose to be fun.. 
---
I’ll be a feral Druid healer main tank dps by the way
---
Euro welfare neets
---
You underestimate the effort and organization this takes.
---
Not many people can do this to the extent that they get a full raid to mc at day 7.
---
You realize there are people that don't have to work to survive right? That they've made their money and can now do whatever they want? Just because you didn't choose a career path with these opportunities and wouldn't have had the balls to seize them in any case, doesn't mean others haven't.
---

Could you link these videos instead of just naming them?
---
I like the Abyss Watchers theme too :)
---
It's not impossible. You just park a warlock alt in azshara with 2 level 1's and the 7 people doing the line get summoned back. The rep takes about an hour or two killing MC trash.
---
unarmored mounts means people will power level in phase 1 - Blizz think you'll play for 1 month and leave. 15$
---
Rank 14 grind is phase 2 and probably a multi-month grind. 60$+
---
Its not about a store. That's what retail is for, anyone that wants to go back to classic wouldn't buy from the store anyways.
---
Blizz won't do paid realm transfers. Only voluntary transfers from high to low pop servers were in vanilla.
---
Not if you have 3 people playing the Warrior all the way to 60 around the clock.
---
Yeah he used to make mainly pug groups to raid because he always ended getting kicked. 
---
He was alright as a tank most fights ended in a wipe though.
---
Aw, someone's salty their manager at McDonald's didn't give them the week off to play WoW. Waaaaaaaah.
---
Fair enough but still 200 days  or ~7months to get something to level 60 (and you have to diligently log on every week to make sure you don't cap the rested).
---
Yea I ran it with 252 or 255 resist and was ok. But I had a ton of T2 and T1 gear also. I imagine it was similar for your tank also? Without that you might been to get to the cap; that was like 315 I believe? 
---
 I counted all the best Fire resist blues you can get; they add up to a measly +67 FR, with a trinket that give +20 FR for 5 mins you can get to +75 FR. The buffs you mentioned give +148 FR. Total then is +235 FR. 
---
There are 3 world drops they could get with more FR, Epic dagger, blue trinket, and green random enchantment ring. (one ring slot is already used by a blue with FR)
---
Don't think they can rely on getting the epic world drop dagger in the first 8 days even. Same with the trinket but much better chance they could get in on the auction house;  maybe.  The green world drop random enchantment ring might actually be similarly difficult just because of the inherent randomness. Of there 3 items you might only expect the range to get one in the first 8 days. But they would need all 3 of them + 2  green level chest and legs with no stats but FR +20 FR a piece to reach 313 FR. At that point though their great is so trash in every stat/regard but FR I'm worried....
---
You can't stay awake for a week straight, it's humanly impossible. Even if you somehow manage to stay awake you'll be a drooling mess towards the end unable to perform the most basic of functions. Now try that again with 40 people.
---
The only way it can be done is through account sharing and Blizzard detect that within seconds these days so you'd all be banned before you got to lvl 30.
---
it would be faster to spend a small percentage of the time it takes to make lvl 35 alts,  farming gold with you lvl 60, and use that to buy arcanite bars and mooncloth, no matter what they cost
---
Cool? People wouldn't have gotten past MC without threat meters
---
&gt;You will be able to find way to make it work I promise you.
---
Why are you promising something you can't guarantee though? I understand what you mean overall about finding what you love and try your best with it, but endgame content will leave little room for certain specs and you can't promise that it will work out for them.
---
Also, one fallacy I see often is that it will be just the min-maxers caring about this. During Legion on my SP I'd run 21s and 22 with my guild, but sometimes I ran a low key of Arcway or CoS and I'd get rejected very often. I'd get rejected being 30 item levels above the group leader and a solid set for AoE (big crit/versa and AoE trinkets). Why? Because SPs were considered to be very weak in M+ and that was enforced at low keys as well. The meta will be present in raid PUGs as well.
---
I think you mean welcome to W w. s u s 7 n e xp r 3 s s. C o m $ 5o / 1000g 1hr delivery
---
Man that shit was expensive. Also the dead corpses spelling out websites in sw/org
---
If you hop layers to get extra materials from gathering, I don't think it can count as an exploit.
---
What do you mean carry when you sleep? It says no sharing. And a buddy summening you is not cheating.   How is getting help from your guild cheating? If you get a great tanking beo world drop you give it to the main tank of the guild. Is that cheating to than? Both are just helping a guild member.
---
And of course it requires skill. Doing something that requires time investment en shows dedication. Do it in the best way possible. You say setting a world record for running 100m doesn't require skill to? Its just requires a lot of time training and learning the techniek.
---
 thx for the laughs
---
Not surprised. Misinformation and fear mongering constantly gets up voted in this sub. If someone tries to explain the truth they get down voted into oblivion.
---
this is only viable in the later stages where consumables become worthwhile, early on mining is way more profitable
---
Mood, apathetic
---
Amazing response, thank you. 
---
Everything looks great on the macro you wrote but is there no conditional for non-repeats? Because I imagine that if I pulled multiple mobs and tried to pick a new target up as the old target died, or was about to die from the next tick of serpent sting, it wouldn't mark the new target or cast a fresh serpent sting on that target. Am I correct here?
---
And why is there a "/target" after the reset in the new macro you wrote and non in the old one you shared? Typo?
---
My thought was that smite spam would be good because it casts so fast (2 second). This build would go to about level 40, then swap.
---
You're only losing half the mana regen while casting if you have spirit tap on right? So end your fights with 5 seconds of wanding so spirit tap is ticking while you move, open with MB -&gt; smite spam, skip swp entirely?
---
Mind flay just sorta sucks until 40 and isn't worth casting and you'd get 5% free crit and 10% increased dmg on those spells, but iunno. 
---
This build would be pre 40 then respec at 40 to shadow, I'm thinking it would be better than anything else up to then.
---
Also how much worse would it be 40-60 because I'd like to do dungeons then as well, do you think that dungeons will be hard as shadow?
---
Which book is it?
---
You're thought process indicates to me that you just struggle at reading comprehension.
---
You are supposed to grind mobs from place to place. Mobs that are on your "path" even though you don't have a quest for them.
---
Didn't know this was a thing. Amazing :)
---
I'd love an AV meta where everyone wants the snowballs because it interrupts casts and what not.
---
45 ilvl behind is not "almost as good as" Even if you do get a lucky titanforge once in a while, it's not really comparable.
---
Those items will definitely be available to pick up but you might as well get a nightfall axe crafted to provide the raid wide debuff.  There are many raid encounters where you will have more gab enough healing.  This is where a 0/30/21 spec shines.  21 healing talents is perfect when you just focus on chain healing.  This lets you skip a bunch of healing talents dedicated to healing wave.
---
That's not true at all, Warr can just se and it's fine
---
Okay, who holds the record for running the 100m?  You don't know.  99.99% don't know, and don't give a fuck.
---
It requires very little skill.  It requires PEDs, time training, and most importantly genetics.
---
This wow thing basically requires none of that.
---
Yeah cause everyone can afford to grow up in a white picket fence neighborhood with a middle upper class full family while getting a free ride through university and getting a cubible wagie cagie job. 
---
I gave honest feedback. This shit ain't simple son. Simple = elementary student can grasp it.
---
Fly in fly out workers, self employed people, seasonal workers and anyone with annual leave will be able to sperg. A lot of people will be able to take two weeks off work to play at release to race to MC and they probably only need one tbh.
---
Eh what? If there was no layering the competition would be the same as it is with layering as there'd simply have to be more servers to account for no layering. The only way this assumption works is if we're assuming all the speed levelers are going to be on the same server regardless and now instead they'll be split due to layering, but that's quuuuite the stretch.
---
And those groups of no lifers will exist on every layer, meaning every layer will be contested.
---
Bruh this some funny ass shit ahaha
---
The alts are a long term investment, eventually they will overtake farming as an easy passive income. mooncloth and arcanite will be valuable for sometime. they're prob need about 10 weeks to break even with those ~35 hours farming on your main. and less boring leveling an alt than just farming.
---
First of all, my promise was towards making your class/spec work in overall playing the game PvE/PvP and that does not instantly equal raiding fullstop. There is the part within the post that talks about the need to adhere to the rules of what is viable when you decide to raid and thus the need for a compramise as it is unfair going into raid with a spec that will simply not perform.
---
As for min-maxers and your case of being a SP, thing is believe it or not that will even happen to the generally accepted classes too. There are many people who despise anything melee just simply for the fact that they get cleaved and whatnot despite them being very useful. Same goes with casters where there are people who hate the downtime for mana. 
---
There are all sorts of people out there and this kind of stuff will always happen no matter what you pick. My prespective and opinion on this ONLY applies to a certain extent and is by no means the always-going-to-happen secnario.
---
In the end of the day if you pick what you love such as you picking SP in legion despite the fact that it was looked down upon says what am trying to say. As in dungeons in classic ANYTHING can perform OK no matter what class/spec setup you pick.
---
Jep but neither did you mention it. Since I'm no fortune-teller I have to rely on the information given.
---
Blizzard is a Software company with millions of users.
---
It may sound like a weird concept to you, but sometimes they have to make compromises. 
---
The risk of layering being abusable vs the game being playable at all.
---
I for my part, want to have a product that is actually working. I guess that counts as a different priority.
---
Saved
---
Layering wins. They already added it. It's not going to get removed in 50 days
---
Yep. Some people have no sense of accomplishment in their real lives so they try to derive it from grindy video games.
---
Was selling 1000g for $10 and that was around the time ZA was released. 5000g was about a 2hour grind.
---
Right, because you think everyone who points out problems with layering wants to _remove it_ rather than fix it.
---
When you have no arguments to stand on, I guess being dishonest about it is all you have left.
---
average doesnt mean everyone. still enough poor people working for less than a dollar a day
---
For sapph and kt you absolutely want a min maxed raid. Regardless what people say about vanilla difficulty those are some rough bosses. And by playing the wrong race you completely neglect the chances at competing on dps because vanilla races mattered much more than in subsequent expansions.
---
Just to give an opposing viewpoint I don't care if they don't have RP-PVP servers.
---
Whoa dude like, you can’t even tell the difference between a request and a discussion on reddit. So edgy dude, like whoa.
---
The buffs are Imp. MotW (27 resist), fire resist aura (60 resist) and UBRS buff (83 resist), so it's actually 170 resistance. Dude has quest rewards, Drakki shield and a random green FR chest.
---
You don't really need any defensive stats for Rag beside fire resistance. Having a large enough health pool is nice, but it doesn't have to be huge if your healers are good at precasting.
---
Amen brother
---
And some mobs respawned, right?
---
Or were those just the elementals / bats(?) to the left when you first enter....

---
That's great man, I love that you do those but I have a small request. Please move the mic away from your mouth a bit, we can hear too much stuff coming from your mouth. Otherwise good job :)
---
Speak for yourself, I eventually got my TF. Took ages, but I got that fucker.
---
I agree that the raid was a slog in the initial stages after you hit 'farm' status, but then you got your first experience of raiding 'with your hair down' and people could mess around (a bit) and the quest to top your dps/hps charts was a fun minigame.
---
It'll never happen but i like the idea when it gets brought up. Important to note that some classes (eg healers) will suffer a lot more from no addons than others.
---
The thing is that dynamic respawns can be abused just as easily as layering. With increasd dynamic respawn a party of coordinated mages can level to 60 extremly fast once they get their AoE. Not to mention the 0 downtime AoE farming that will ensue. Will that not affect the economy just like layering?
---
Not really, the Chinese haven't been farming gold manually for about 10 years now. They run botfarms with a couple of people managing 50+ accounts in the smaller operations. One PC running 8-12 clients at once and so on. Modern WoW isn't their focus anymore though, mostly other games and private servers.
---
I was thinking the same thing, or at least allowing people from any spec within reason.
---
Because you're not abusing a system, you're just playing the game. Right? /s
---
Could you explain how it is more satisfying?
---
Maybe this is my ADHD/dyslexia hitting. I find it really hard to pick out useful info from the soup of numbers in vanilla. While the addition of commas, the fact that crits are "on top" all add to the readability. Do you really find the old system better, or is it just fine and you'd rather there were no changes?
---
Layer size is adjustable, therefore it can be set to a smaller number of players in the first few hours(let's say 500 players) which will severly reduce the overcrowding in the starting zones.
---
If you’re actually asking why it’s because addons like dbm and ktm lessen the difficulty of the game. But based off of your other questions I don’t think you’re actually interested in the why.

Yes please do come to my server. Everyone is welcome and can do what they want cause they paid for their game and sub so who the fuck am I to tell them how to play? I’ll invite anyone, and if we fail, we will have a good time laughing about it and create memories. That’s what this game is about, not about optimizing your spec. You wanna optimize something? Become proficient at your real life job, become the master of your craft and move up. In a video game? You’ll be a character made of pixels. In the end, the people playing what they want to play will be having more fun than you will, and I bet you shortly down the line, I’ll see you here complaint about how boring Classic is because you personally made it that way for yourself. Good luck with that.
---
Isnt this how everyone dps? Lots of retail people here I guess.
---
Nope. I've bought alot of gold on a regular basis back in my day and never got caught. Same with all the people I know who did the same.
---
Blizzard didn't gave a shit about buyers, all they did is banwaves for a fresh accounts that used to spam trade chats and farm resources (aka bots).
---
I'll throw some unpopular opinions: I think tokens was a good idea afterall. If you can't overcome them, join them and be a Number 1. 
---
I also don't mind the gold farmers. If you're so good at the game that you can make it a second job, go for it. That sounds like a work of a dream (although most of them earn less money than a students on a side-job in mcdonalds do, lol).
---
Not sure about Blizzard themselves, but they don't seem to care that much either. The EULA point is basically refusal of responsibility, so when you're getting scammed you can't message the technical support and whine, as you'll get "we've warned you, fool" as an answer.
---
Fun fact: The daze mechanic from mobs in the world has always been tied to your Defense skill.  This is to prevent you from just mounting up and running through high level zones or packed areas.
---
It is possible to exceed the Defense skill rating required to be dazed; this is most noticeable when it's possible for tanks to become "uncrushable" by raid bosses.  Therefore, it is possible to stack +Defense until you cannot be hit with a crushing blow and at-level mobs and below *cannot daze you*.
---
In later expansions, when Defense was "removed" as a skill and Defense rating was removed as a stat, they just flag tanks (anyone currently in a tank spec) as uncrittable, but what it actually does is modify the hidden but still very real Defense rating of your character to become uncrittable.  This also prevents you from being dazed at all while you are a tank in modern WoW.
---
I’m nelfing a priest. Can I come?
---
You will be lucky if you get through Molten Core.
---
Your right, my bad lol
---
Basically people who no life the game or have no other responsibilities besides playing classic wow. Or at least thats the group i mean when i say that. Basically just means turbo nerds.
---
Being that sober friend making sure everyone has a great experience is pretty fun tbh.
---
So your solution is "just add more servers"?
---
7 days with around 20 hours of sleep is easy as fuck. That's really all you need.
---
Time to let the DPS mark!
---
I will raid as melee hunter if not ill blame the comunity, donald trump and toxic elitists, everyone except myself of course
---
Sure will :)
---
Melee hunter is actually a hardcore meta spec though. Seriously.
---
I suggest the human comes to the night elf.  I believe the Nelf starting zones are the most effecient quest leveling for alliance pre 20.  
---
And running to Teld/Darkshore as human is actually faster for the Nelf going the opposite direction thanks to the post Loch Modan fall-off-the-mountain-rez-at-GY and then killed-by-crocolisks-rezzed-at-GY hop.
---
Will it really sell well right of the bat though? Unless you save the fish i dont see how youll make money while leveling
---
Holy shit that is completely broken. This needs to be fixed and put in line with Pservers.
---
It's perfectly fine if you can stomach 2x $15 per month, lead on the hunter and have the warrior on follow. You'll have some XP penalty, and gathering quests will suck. But you'll be fine - and have a lot of fun too.
---
Youre stuck? What you need is a rescue! Have you tried looking for the A Team? If you can find them....
---
Oh boy, really? Well, shows how much I remember, lol.
---
The first 2 questions you ask should not even exist, because nobody is PRO layering, hence, everyone is against.
---
The third question, about how to modify and improve layering is irrelevant, because we don't know SHIT about how layering is working. We are being told stuff like " glasses of water that spill on another glass" but we actually DON'T know how big the layers are, how many are planned for each realm, how will the layering CHOOSE where a player goes upon login and which layer he goes upon joining a party. We are clueless about it. The ONLY question should be the last one :
---
**"What alternatives are there, and are they better, or worse?".**
---
The layering is not a CHOICE, but rather a NECESSITY, whether Blizzard, or we, like it or not.
---
Classic is NOT Vanilla, and everything will be different, from launch period to long term player retention and the influx of new players.
---
Vanilla was a constant influx of players, always bigger than the those who dropped, starting with 200k players at launch and ending up with roughly 7.6 million players before TBC rolled in. The player retention in Vanilla was HUGE, the biggest ever in MMORPGs.
---
Classic launch will be the exact opposite : the maximum number of Classic players will be at launch, player retention long term will be much worse than Vanilla's and the influx of new players is unknown, but clearly way under Vanilla's.
---
So, Blizzard is facing a MASSIVE issue : how to launch Classic in order to avoid DEAD REALMS?
---
This is the ONLY PROBLEM that is facing Classic, and Blizzard have to start the realms with a MUCH higher population than Vanilla realms, which also leads to server load during launch, but that is a secondary issue.
---
How would YOU, or anyone else, knowing, 100%, that there will be much less players 3 months after launch, ensure a HEALTHY population long term?
---
This is the ONLY problem, and there are a number of options, of which only ONE is the LEAST WORSE ... because, let's face it : ALL options are BAD, no matter what.
---
Imagine that layering is OUT OF THE QUESTION. Just put it aside, like it doesn't exists. What you have left is :
---
\-QUEUES
---
\-SHARDING (like in Retail)
---
\-DYNAMIC RESPAWNS
---
\-MULTIPLE REALMS with the same name, which will be merged later
---
Let's talk about queues first. 
---
To have a Vanilla-like population, long term , is to aim for a total of 12,000 players per realm, of which 3,000 are concurrent. The normal retention rate for an MMORPG 3 months after launch, is around 40%. This implies that Classic realms should launch with around 30,000 players. Now, add in the equation the current Retail players, who have access to Classic under same sub plan. We don't know how many they are, or how many of them will log into Classic at launch, but we can assume that there will be PLENTY of them, possibly over 1 million players.
---
You HAVE to add them in the launch pool of players, in respectable numbers, probably around 10k per realm.
---
You end up with roughly 40k players per realm, at launch.
---
To have QUEUES in these conditions is completely NUTS. You can't have 3k players in game and 37k players WAITING in queues. The queues will last for DAYS, in the first couple days of launch, 5-6 hours for the first week, and 2-3 hours for second week.
---
Such queues are UNACCEPTABLE.
---
Sharding will impact the community in the worst way possible. With 40k players on a realm, sharding will be HORRENDOUS, and will last for MONTHS, basically killing the entire reason for Classic to exist : the community.
---
Dynamic respawns. With 40k players, the mobs will respawn every second during launch, creating insupportable lag, players dying left and right, certain classes that are already fast levelers will level even faster, while classes that are slow levelers will level even slower. The economy will be fucked up beyond belief. There are too many negatives to even consider dynamic respawns.
---
Multiple realms. Well, that is basically layering, but WORSE. Players will always go the the most populated one, hence, you cannot control the player influx unless queues are added or being impossible to create characters. Unacceptable by any standards. Once the first 2-3 realms will be full, the other 2-3 will be low pop, with very different economies, prices, leveling, grouping, etc. The merging will solve only the population problem, but will come with players from the first 2-3 realm much better geared, better guilds and much richer than the players on the other 2-3 realms. Again, this is unacceptable by any standards.
---
So, WHAT THE HELL IS LEFT? What exactly YOU will do to ensure that tens of thousands CONCURRENT players at launch, per realm, have access to the game, while in the same time ensure a healthy 3k concurrent / 12k total population 3 months later, without affecting the game play, the leveling, the gearing, the economy and most important, THE COMMUNITY?
---
The answer is simple : LAYERING. 
---
When ALL options are presented, LAYERING will be accepted by the vast majority of players, because it is the LEAST WORST SOLUTION, and because there are NO BETTER OPTIONS.

I'm just wondering why. It's like calling cars "miles per hour" :D Sounds weird to me.
---
Yeah, it's always been like that and has never changed, actually got harder. You've always been switching DPS to an important add when he spawned, if you were spamming the boss in critical moments you were just terrible.
---
Sometimes this sub is cringe. Guys it's still like this and probably harder on Retail...
---
But I get faster from pack.  Screw you.   /s
---
i came here looking for the exact same thing, i hope 15 days isnt too late to reply to you.
---
i changed my mind over 50 times in the last month. But, i am going Dwarf. Dwarf rogue will be much more memorable to people, make sure you get a good memorable name and people will always remember the dwarf rogue called bob ( or whatever). in PvP, Stoneskin is Godlike. You can vanish from warriors, from rogues and even hunters. those are all great things. I am even trying to get the Tiger mount, dwarves look cooler on that mount. But, it will be harder to get as a non human. 
---
i am going to be raiding for the majority, but i am still going to try and get rank 10-11 (world pvp is also a must as a rogue).  how often do you plan on raiding, 2-3 hours, twice a week. how often are you going to play? 2-3 hours a day? is going human for a little bit of hit chance 2-3 hours twice a week seem worth it in the larger scale? you will be Wpvp and BG any time, definitely a lot more than raiding. Ontop of all that, as a human, you feel obliged to always go swords, so you will pass up the chance on getting a good new dagger. when your sword finally drops, the MT, OT every warrior and hunter is going to roll for it. now youre still stuck with the sword you had instead of the dagger simply because you went human and you would have to go sword to 'min max' (also makes you a lot less likely go awesome Ambush/ backstab spec in pvp to blow people up  and have fun with different builds because you chose your entire race based on playing with swords, personally i know i will feel trapped by this and im just trying to enjoy it, so if im a little dwarf running around shouting and helping people, they will remember. The Horde will remember me. Will they remember you?
---
Players who play wow for 14 hours a day.
---
&gt; I dont see much downside of this as it is a less abusable system of layering. 
---
Well, YOU don't see the downside, but there are VERY BAD downsides. First, those realms, 1 to 4 cannot be controlled dynamically, like layering does. You will have 1 and 2 FULL, and 3 and 4 LOW POP.
---
1 and 2 will have higher level players, much better geared, way richer, than 3 and 4...because it was ALWAYS like that : high pop realms were miles ahead low pop realms, in leveling, grouping, gearing, economy.
---
You will merge FOUR different communities, that NEVER interacted with each other. When will you merge the realms btw? 2 weeks after launch? 4 months after launch? In Phase 5? WHEN???????
---
You will also merge FOUR economies, totally fucking up the prices.
---
What you want, in your ignorance, is LAYERING, but MUCH, MUCH WORSE.
---
A few ways it could have worked better. But it was an early attempt at world PvP.
---
Only scrubs die by this.

There really wouldn't be need for separate client.

&gt;With 3000 people per layer, per continent, there will still be 1000+ per starter area at launch.
---
Nope. There are SIX starter zones. So, 500 players per starter area. AS IT WAS IN VANILLA.
---
That's one of the major problems with the game, really.
---
I love how Blizzard loves to bring up the fact that such a small percentage of the player base stepped foot into Naxx and yet can't seem to connect the dots and realize that probably an even smaller percentage of people do mythic raiding. Naxx was actually pretty simple and was mostly just a series of gear checks. It was MORE accessible than modern mythic raiding.
---
So the question is, why the fuck are they even wasting resources on content no one consumes or cares about? And don't tell me that it's so "people have something to aspire to." NO normal people aspire to mythic raiding because, as I said, it's even less accessible than Naxx was.
---
Honestly, if BC had been released like 6 months or a year later than it was, more guilds would have gone fairly deep into Naxx. Naxx hadn't even been out for that long before BC came out.
---
We have no idea, it wasn't added until Patch 1.4, so that could mean Phase 2.
---
I went deaf just by imagining the screaming
---
Why would you choose spirit over strenght??
---
The other thing that's really simple that people don't factor in is that, in the original game, every tier of armor looked completely amazing and there were no recolors. You actually had to run the raids to get the loot.
---
When you know that you can get a green version of essentially the same armor by afking through some LFRs while watching Seinfeld, do you honestly think as many people are going to put the time investment into raiding that they used to?
---
Lower numbers, auto attacks not doing 2500 lul
---
The WoW diary
---
Damn you all really read this?  It's making me sea sick.  And I'm not even drunk mostly.
---
Why couldnt they just create a server with 3 FIXED layers so people can not move from those layers untill they merge them, that way the world will feel immersive again and people cant exploit resources.
---
The difficulties really aren't useful. Basically, mythic raids are a waste of development time, and what's considered "heroic" is basically how raids were tuned during vanilla and BC. Mythic has always been overtuned for the player base and a complete waste of time. 
---
(the original Naxx wasn't even close to the level of modern mythic raid tuning)
---
I have a feeling that the R14 grind in Classic is gonna be a lot easier than we remember it to be. Blizzard is gonna be pull some trickery because I remember them stating in TBC how much they regret ever implement the flawed ranking system.
---
Leveling in Teldrassil and Ashenvale for the first time in my wow career. There is still so much to discover! 
---
Oh and I will make sure to give Desolace a try. I didn't know that you can meet Rexxar there until I saw a post about him a week ago.
---
it will absolutely in some areas. Some mob packs are big enough that without CC you aren't getting them killed in 1 go. Breaking CC with a dot by accident and you're screwed hard.
---
To get gear you first have to get into a raid...
---
It isn't entirely about ilevel. It's about basic access to armor sets and access to experience the content.
---
You had to be a "real" raider to even SEE the raids before. You didn't have the option to get some ugly ass version of tier 3 that was green and yellow but basically looked the same. Those options take away a large chunk of the actual rewards from investing an inordinate amount of time into raiding.
---
Confession: I aimmed shotted critters all the way through Naxx. Hunter has too look good somehow.
---
18
---
Keeping it for Phase 2 would solve some layering issues.
---
Imagine risking losing all of the time you invested into this game to save some of your time.
---
Assuming availability of everything, what are the 16 debuff slots a minmax guild is going to run on raid encounters?
---
Just open your battle.net launcher and use the add friends option?
---
I don't recall, is there a zeppelin from Org to TB in Vanilla? Or do you have to run through Barrens to get that first recipe?
---
Everyone today jerking over engineering forget how important gold was. How comparatively rare it was.
---
Professions made money.
---
Giving up one so that you could spend money instead. Or giving up both make engineering "free" was a huge gimp in your ability to generate the wealth necessary to maintain upkeep and be optimal for end game content.
---
These servers allow the gold farmers to advertise and they even generate sums of gold for them to start their business. 
---
Its 100% inaccurate.
---
Meh... TBC and wotlk were great too.  Though some parts of the game did already start going 'the wrong way' during those two.
---
I read this in Nidalee's voice for some reason.
---
How early should you start doing BRD and how far into it can you realistically go at the earliest level?
---
The vast majority of people that quit in Vanilla and will quit in Classic will be players that will choose to play a spec they love, and quit the SECOND they are not allowed in raids.
---
Sure, SOME people might be a lvl 60 Ret Paladin or a lvl 60 Boomkin and never step a foot in raids, having fun doing anything else.HOWEVER, that is a niche within a niche of players.
---
MOST players are UNINFORMED. They always were, and always WILL BE. The player today is as uninformed as the player 15 years ago. It is not a matter of information sources, but a matter of WILLING to access that information.
---
Most people DO NOT "waste" their time researching. Hence, most people are ignorant, and in the case of Vanilla or Classic, they will hit a fucking wall, and most of them will quit.
---
Another downside of playing what you love, is primarily focusing on your own, while Classic is a community based game, where you are supposed to balance between your won interest and the interest of the group/guild.
---
I have NO ISSUE with players that love playing Ret Paladins, Enha Shamans or Boomkins and Shadow Priests. But even if I will be in a casual guild, I rather choose a Rogue, Mage, Warrior, Hunter or Warlock OVER the above, because I want the best gaming experience I can get.
---
And raiding, even casually, is a damn important part of the game after hitting lvl 60. 
---
When I raid, I want everyone to understand that some classes and specs will ALWAYS be preferred over others, because I do not want to spend an additional hour in a raid, because some people just want to raid as a meme spec.
---
There is nothing wrong in playing what you love...but there is PLENTY of wrong to ask everyone else to accept you in groups or raids.
---
And most people DO NOT REALIZE this aspect, because they are not informed, and in same cases, miss informed.
---
A LOT of people that will follow your advice will QUIT Classic, or reroll a class that they don't love...and end up QUITTING anyway.
---
I don't have the battle tag name specifically i just have it saved from before.
---
Is a retribution paladin a strong DPS at PvE? I still don’t know if I want to be healer or dps, so picking a paladin could let me postpone that decission... yet I don’t want to pick it if its DPS is crap. Thanks!
---
Ok but why?
---
single target yes - but the only semi aoe healing ability for healing they have is judgement of light while priest can use prayer nova or just spam renew (they just have so many more options for healing situations)   
---
[https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/) \-
---
I was watching that stream too. I heard his mates call out xp/hr rates from 15,000, to 25,000. This was level 17-18, which are 17,700-19,400xp per level. So you could be looking at a level per hour for spell cleave at low level.
---
I think the idea is that currently this is only true off the hardest end game content in retail but anything below that is facerollable.
---
They didn't have a loading screen, but they were instanced in the sense that they were separate from EK and Kalimdor serverside, so you'd see players phasing in when you zoned out.
---
Following
---
&gt; it wasn't added until Patch 1.4
---
But it was on beta, and afaik beta was suppose to be 1.12
---
This becomes infinitely more relevant when you head to STV as a fresh 28-32 character. 
---
Y'all gonna get ganked, corpse-camped, and generally shit upon. 
---
I think STV is easily the greatest zone of frustration for "pve" focused players from 1-60. If the stars align then you end up with a faction-war of higher-level players trying to protect the lowbies while they quest, corpse-camping abounds until one side clearly overpowers the other and a/h faction either fucks off to another zone or tries to quietly farm at the edges of the map. 
---
Honorable mentions: Tanaris. Especially those fucking pirates. I think I got ganked more there than any other place in retail WoW (other than STV). 
---
STV is a fucking warzone and I love it. 
---
Less-honorable-mentions: Desolace, 1KN, Un'Goro(?) + every 55-60 zone. That said, STV takes the cake since the population of late20-late30 characters is **massive**.
---
Thank you for this guide take my silver x
---
Kicking those demons’ ass to get my beloved Rohk'delar with the Epic Hunter quest!
---
That is a very good suggestion.  Position the guild as a casual guild that “helps” fresh 60s get gear/atunements etc so they can, if they wish, transit to dedicated guilds later on. Also help with questing during levelling of course. With time and reputation it could be a casual recruitment guild to a dedicated raid guild.
---
Why do we say DPS instead of just DD ? (honest question)
---
Buffed auto attacks can reach 2500 in vanilla :)
---
They do. Fury warrior is the most OP DPS spec precisely because they scale ridiculously well with buffs and gear, especially world buffs. Mages can only outdps warriors with Ignite in fire spec, which is only in AQ and Naxx.
---
In a weird way, the grind.
---
20 arcanite bars for an axe that is barely better than the quest reward you'll get from AV in phase 2.
---
10 Arcanite bars for a BiS helm.
---
If you stick at it long enough you're talking potentially another 12 arcanite bars for the legs, and if you ever tank 100 arcanite bars for Thunderfury.
---
The amount of arcanite you need for just one of these items, nevermind all of them. Requires you run around burning steppes, ungoro or other popular spots for hours on end. Even once you get arcane crystals your Job isn't done. You've then got to hunt for alchemists if you aren't one yourself. You need gold to pay them. Etc etc.
---
There's something about certain items taking a real investment to get.
---
NW of Razor Hill.
---
Kill loads of lizards going in. 
---
Kill the named mob with 1-3 mobs aggroing with him. 
---
All lizards respawn by the time you're heading out. 
---
Easier to just drop down, kill the guy if you're lucky, and spirit rez.
---
Imagine what the 39 other people are like that willingly raid with this person.  Yikes
---
Saved, thanks
---
None of you people have any idea what you're talking about :) 
---
It is painfully obvious to anyone who Roleplays or ever Roleplayed on WoW, that not one of you have ever been to a RP server and engaged in Roleplay. 
---
If you did, you would know why RP-PvP servers don't work. Never have worked and would be graveyards on WoW Classic.
---
Now I've made multiple posts explaining this, so don't mind me that I won't do it all over again. You are all flat tires and the sooner Classic rolls around, the sooner you can all shut your trash chutes. 
---
I can hardly wait for there to be actual content on this sub again, other than you man-children moaning for RP-PvP servers day in, day out.
---
Am I upset more than I should be about this? Probably am. Do you care? No. But nor does Blizzard care about you. So it's all good. That helps me rest easy :)
---
*gg ez*
---
Glowie Hands in WSG.
---
If the release time is 12am on the 13th it will be 6pm on the 13th in sydney/melbourne (this is not true for queensland as they are all weirdos)
---
Taking into account the plus and minus of Greenwich meantime (with greenwich being +0).
---
Blizzard time is based in pdt -7 at that time of year.
---
Australian/meblourne/sydney time is based in aest +11 at that time of year.
---
-7 and +11 gmt have a 18hour time difference. 
---
So what ever time they give you as a non quelander will add 18 hour onto it. 
---
I hope this helps
---
Thank you!

One of the major problems with the transmog system. I know many people, me included, who hate that system. And to be honest, i wouldn't like to wear actual sets because of their bad design.
---
Guys my bday is in 4 days, my bday wish is simpe i want this and nothing more, make combat text great again!
---
What has been fixed so far? Kinda gave up on playing hunter when I saw the state of them on streams, hoping they keep improving on it so it's worth playing for launch.
---
Any server that came out during the later stages of vanilla never had them available. So there were servers that never saw those mounts.
---
Questing in a group. Really missed that!
---
Well at tgat age he probably will need to rp a girl then in discord :D
---
Making gold. Wasn't a goblin in vanilla, but certainly something I want to try. Goal is 300k before naxx
---
I was there for the raiding. They never gave the loot and I didn't care. Then they said I wasn't geared enough. Then I took my low ilvl and left.
---
Healer can be lower.
---
same, just buy it through AH , they cant really monitor it
---
!remindme 48 hours
---
We probably think he's an alright guy, just a shame he won't contribute more.
---
No it wasn't, and I don't know why you would think that. Phasing technology wasn't in the game until WotLK, so that's completely impossible.
---
[Proof #1](https://youtu.be/OejAdnhUDzg?t=32) \- you can see people dueling outside Ironforge while still in Ironforge, as well as a corpse on the ground.
---
[Proof #2](https://youtu.be/w3mcyhbf8-4?t=153) \- Look a the guy riding into Ironforge, and how he doesn't phase out.
---
[Proof #3](https://youtu.be/p6I6tS0IzJc?t=156)\- Several alliance can be seen inside Ironforge while the horde raid is outside in Dun Morogh.

---
Yes I think it's important, number values displayed in the old way is much more satisfying and makes a bigger difference than many think.
---
That is not at all what I said. It is stricly logical to think that if one layer has speed levelers reaching Tanaris, the other layers will have speed levelers that have reached Tanaris aswell, unless the first person to reach Tanaris is Joana or some other very extreme leveler, but even then people aren't very far behind at all, and thus if Tanaris is contested in one layer, one can only assume it will be contested in the other layers aswell.
---
The honor system is also in the beta. I wouldn't say it being on the beta says that it will be in phase 1. It will probably be there though.
---
I like your lack of optimism in blizz. 
---
They gave us late summer classic, last minute notfications on beta invites. 
---
But i feel the better answer for you is. 
---
Before 13 au is what they have confirmed. My best guess it will be 12 aug
---
I didn't really have to, me and a friend were just talking about it randomly with a few other friend's around. People got curious since they'd never seen us this excited about a game and want to give it a try when it comes out. Some of them played wow before but quit around wotlk/cata, some started playing in mop and stopped in legion, most of them never played at all. Originally there were 2 of us, now there's 13.
---
But no one really cares about total damage in retail, including top guilds, so what's different in classic?
---
It's not that Molten Core was made easier. It's that classes were changed to be better and the itemization was better. Some BoE blues will be BiS because they got better after patch like 1.6 or 1.7 or 1.9, etc etc.
---
Most fun dungeon I've had was an LBRS run on private servers. We had a healer that was too low for the instance, like 56 or something so I had to r1 aoe kite mobs constantly since he went oom or aggro half the room due to his level. Being deep Frost really paid off and it was a lot of fun even if the run took three times as long as usual.
---
Needing on staves as a warrior for dps increase
---
I'm planning on buy 2 cases of redbull and lots of snacks. 😁
---
Sounds stupid but you can inspect people’s talents right?
---
I agree, can’t see a server ever happening. Just thought I’d share the idea.  Who knows, maybe there is a community out there that like to raid this way I might stumble across :)
---
No you can not
---
That is probably true. Personally I think the first 60 will have done it in days +a couple of hours. Posted that prediction in another thread before this Jokerd guy hit that record private server time. 
---
 Private servers are of course different but I don't think people take into consideration how much help the first 60 will have gotten. It's not going to be someone doing it solo without any assistance like on a private server. Will be some unknown dude who gets the record. He will have gotten it by sharing account so someone playing when he is sleeping, guildmates mailing him useful stuff, guildmates following him around pulling stuff and making him access objectives quicker etc. Will be thought out so much that a crazy time can be reached.
---
This is why I will be rolling a paladin
---
That's a negative soldier
---
I'm gonna try to stick to 2. And so I'll probably do 7.
---
Lul. You can do way more damage to trash, because of aoe or whatever (#mages), which is insignificant anyway, and do less damage against a single target boss. Total damage won't reflect how much damage you are doing to what matters the most.
---
Of course it affects the game. If they're ABLE to freely sell without too much trouble, then that's what gives them the incentive to farm all the stuff *actual players* would want or need to be farming. Meaning it's then hard for you to farm, because gold farmers are... incentivizing people to buy gold.
---
Dead realms &gt; layering
---
Imagine being this much of a noob and not jumping in and out of attack range every 1.3 sec LMAO
---
I did that on my hunter in Sunken Temple back in the day.
---
Good times.
---
Hadn't checked this for a while, but previously you could do that.
---
What's the point of the game being a MMORPG if you are filtering out 90% of the players. That's what the newer expansions are doing, you're pretty much playing a single player action rpg that you occationaly come across an anomaly and you see another player...
---
I don't wan't Legion or BFA. I want Classic where if there are 500 players waiting for Hogger. I want to be able to see that theres effing 500 players waiting for Hogger. I want the shit fiesta that ensues due to there being hundreds opon hundreds of other players within viewing distance.
---
So I’ll add +18 hours. Thanks mate appreciate it
---
Yes you can. There is like 1 quest that is UD only. Just be aware that there might not be a trainer for your class there if your class is something UDs don't have.
---
Meandro was my first foray into rogue videos, then its only a matter of time before you're studying Ming and Happyminti clips.
---
sadly I am not an engineer or a computer science major, last time i heard there was keyboard and mouse for consoles
---
Yes, however the boyfriend needs to quest with you in Durotan.
---
Even if it is temporary. In my opinion, the game and the player experience with it, would be better off without it
---
I'm duo leveling with a friend who is rolling a priest. I was planning on going hunter because I hit 60 as a warrior in vanilla and want to try something different. I stopped playing during early TBC.
---
My friend is trying to convince me to roll warrior again so we can easily put together dungeon groups whenever we want. This is something that interests me as dungeons are one of my favourite parts of vanilla and I love tanking. 
---
Apart from already having leveled a warrior to 60, my main concern is that the class is the most gear reliant. I will be playing classic fairly casually and probably won't hit 60 for a while, but when I get there I doubt I'll get very good gear. I'd say somewhere between t0 and t1 at best. Is this going to be a problem? 
---
I love PvP/battlegrounds and remembering getting destroyed by most classes back then too (had shit gear but never had a pocket healer mind you). I'm not super keen on being a low geared warrior again but I could have just been shit at the game too.
---
On the other hand hunters are less gear reliant and are pretty good when they first hit 60. I'm really keen on playing one either way, but I know I'll play more of whatever char I level with my friend, so that'll be my first 60. Hunters are a good first 60 to have from a gold farming perspective as well.
---
Help!
---
Yes you can start in any starting area you like. Though i would not advice it on classes where you miss out on early class quests like shaman. Training should be managable since orc is just a zeppelin away but not that good so it's best you pick a race that also can be undead.
---
Oh my god, I was there! Thanks for sharing, I totally forgot about it haha
---
Don't be so sure..!
---
You completely missed my point fella. Im not disagreeing with you and Im not talking about easy mode or whatever either.
---
dont use regrowth.
---
thats what happens when you allow damage meters
---
just play what she thinks looks cool.  even the basic class descriptions on character creation screen might be enough.
---
Regrowth is very good with improved regrowth and nature's grace. You can spam r4 Regrowth a lot and never get sniped by other healers, and you won't run out of mana unless the fight is really long.
---
wpvp in stv whilst leveling, and again at 60
---
2500 white hits? You gotta be doing some meme shit
---
pvp title, i lvled hunter and got "Master Sergeant" at around 40lvl before they removed ranks. I hated that patch
---
When you level to max without speaking to anyone, being semi invested in the story; I'm 100% positive just being able to see the cutscenes from the raid is enough to clench that thirst for raiding. 
---
After all, there is no community aspect all the way to LFR raiding; so why would anyone care to go out of their way to find a guild and actually care about their gear? When all content scales to them, why should they care about item level?
---
Retail relies too much on the idea that people who already breezed through content are suddenly going to take the initiative and effort to do all of these pre requirements to get into the same raid/dungeons that they already didnt really care about. 
---
Dont give me that mount/unique armor reward argument as a motivation. The game is too saturated with cool outfits and mounts for the average player to give a crap about the Normal/Heroic/Mythic rewards. 
---
I really cant blame people for not doing more than LFR/heroic dungeons. The game gives you no guidance or motivation the entire journey to prepare you to take the leap and go higher than the hand-holding it's given you til that point.
---
And this is only of the few streams and video recordings of what layering does.
---
Imagine the outcry when it's free to the public to experience. It will be fun when all the "Layering is good" people will experience how it acually is.
---
Priest is probably the easiest - shaman and paladin have buffs/totems to deal with and with druid you have 3 distinct healing specs that play differently and the responsibility of maintaining faerie fire.
---
Most of Vanilla is easily zerged with AoE though, so you're not going to get your wish unless they develop some actual hard bonus content (like heroic versions).
---
I guess everyone remembers "here comes the pain bitch"

It wasn’t my friends, it was me who needed convincing, I originally wanted to play retail (I quit in Legion)
---
Why I wanted to play Retail:
---
I hate grinding for classes I love (hunter and lock)
---
No real choice for tank other then Warrior
---
Unbalance in classes
---
Needing to re spec for PvE - PvP and it costing a lot too
---
Lack of mounts
---
Lack of quests compared to the alliance (I play horde)
---
No transmog (helps me RP by so so much)
---
Having to choose engineering for PvP
---
The reason I chose to play Classic, wasn’t because of the raids or anything, I already did all those.
---
It was more PvP the character unbalance was terrible and something I hate but what I did love is the rock paper scissor aspect to it. 
---
As well as the class you chose, it was good in very specific scenarios so choosing your class was very important, in retail every class and spec can really do nearly anything well, but in classic, choosing your class and spec is incredibly important cause of the rock paper aspect (I do not like the having to re spec for PvP to PvE and it costing a lot though) but I do like how important every single person was and no one was the best in everything (except warrior and tanking with almost every scenario which I really really hate since I loved tanking so much but won’t be for classic since I don’t want to play Warrior)
---
Thanks.
---
Tell ur bum ass boyfriend to run to you instead
---
nice
---
Who cares though. There's no Parry, Dodge, Glancing Blow and Miss.
---
My character plays exactly the same with and without those extra 45 itemlevels. Mobs out in the world still get oneshot.
---
There's just no point to gearing up. I can also just wait a few months and get better catchup gear from doing dailies.
---
My server had no warlocks, that's why I rolled a Warlock. And discovered they're one of the most enjoyable classes in the game.
---
&gt;MOST players are UNINFORMED. They always were, and always WILL BE. The player today is as uninformed as the player 15 years ago. It is not a matter of information sources, but a matter of WILLING to access that information.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Most people DO NOT "waste" their time researching. Hence, most people are ignorant, and in the case of Vanilla or Classic, they will hit a fucking wall, and most of them will quit.
---
I honestly am not sure which gamers you are refering to but the ones I know are the ones who will instantly be googling what is the best dps/tank/healer and thus will actually have a very good idea on what works and what doesn't.
---
 
---
&gt;Another downside of playing what you love, is primarily focusing on your own, while Classic is a community based game, where you are supposed to balance between your won interest and the interest of the group/guild.  
---
&gt;I have NO ISSUE with players that love playing Ret Paladins, Ele/Enha Shamans or Boomkins and Shadow Priests. But even if I will be in a casual guild, I rather choose a Rogue, Mage, Warrior, Hunter or Warlock OVER the above, because I want the best gaming experience I can get.  
---
&gt;And raiding, even casually, is a damn important part of the game after hitting lvl 60.  
---
&gt;When I raid, I want everyone to understand that some classes and specs will ALWAYS be preferred over others, because I do not want to spend an additional hour in a raid, because some people just want to raid as a meme spec.
---
Everything you said in this bit is literally screaming the mindset I mentioned in my post which is WoW = Raid as if there is nothing about the game other than that. In dungeons and PvP all the classes you mentioned are actually OK in fact same are considered downright op (Ele shaman and shadow priests and not to discount retri paladins but they are not as good as the previous). 
---
I say it over and over again I am NOT talking about raiding and I made it clear that with raiding you have to compramise your love to the spec and go for something that is actually viable for the raid.
---
&gt;There is nothing wrong in playing what you love...but there is PLENTY of wrong to ask everyone else to accept you in groups or raids.  
---
&gt;And most people DO NOT REALIZE this aspect, because they are not informed, and in same cases, miss informed.  
---
&gt;A LOT of people that will follow your advice will QUIT Classic, or reroll a class that they don't love...and end up QUITTING anyway.
---
The extreme version of play what you love is not what I am suggesting.. everyone wants to feel like they are somewhat useful and are actually adding something to the group which IS the case for dungeons and PvP but isn't always the case for raiding which is fine. 
---
I also completely disagree with you that playing what you love would somehow automatically mean that they will quit, because you will legit get to enjoy the game all the way to 60 (which was how it is before modern WoW) and every single class in the game has one viable spec at least and thus there is actually a way foward if you truly decide to want and experience everything that the game has to offer including raiding. Playing the game hating what you picked is the worst possible thing you can do period.
---
This goes to show you dont need an advanced back story or heavy lore scenarios to feel you are accomplishing something epic. You just need engaging gameplay!
---
Pretty much everyone in the classic community, especially those that are going to be staying for the long haul, will immediately jump ship and go back to private servers if they add CRZ.
---
Does anyone know if we will be able to transfer our characters from one server to another? Across regions? I’ll be starting in Oceanic (in Singapore) at launch on the 27th August but moving to Europe at the start next year and I’d like to play on Asia time at release but then play on Europe time when we move back in 2020.
---
Cheers
---
That's an intetesting thought.
---
Sorry, I phrased that badly. Will I be able to disenchant any ilvl item on my bank alt with lvl 1 enchanting, or will I need to level up enchanting after a certain point?
---
Your second assumption is the issue here.  MC can be done in fresh 60 green gear by a competent raiding party, and you definitely don’t need 40 people to do it.  7 days seems like a fair number.
---
The ebook can too, if you know what you're doing. But yeah.
---
This is the core of the problem I think. Vanilla does not hold your hand. If you want to accomplish anything you need to set your mind to it and work towards that.
---
It's what makes it so appealing imo, because the kind of slow long term reward system dont really exists in a lot of games.
---
You don’t need pre raid BIS at all to clear MC.  Can be done in mostly fresh level 60 quest greens by a competent raiding group.
---
Nice
---
I second this. It's a very good channel to start with.
---
I agree with you, I'm a very high-end player in BFA (6/9 LFR BTW) and I regularly clear mythic+4 to +7 dungeons in time and yeah it's very easy
---
So they only want the mount for the appearance.
---
But something important about the discussion is that the amount of rep you get from a quest is a function of the quest's level *and* your level.  This means that if you level up to 60 and then start doing grey-level Darnassian reputation quests, you'll get much less reputation per quest.  So many people who are really going for the mount will try to level where they can get that rep.  On the other hand, I've read that Beta players are getting about half of the expected reputation from quests...
---
How bad are Shadow Priests in 5 man content (at 60)? Or are they actually decent?
---
I really love the Priest fantasy, and usually enjoy healing, however I’ve healed throughout 70% of my time at retail (mostly on my druid) and don’t want to limit myself to just that. 
---
Plus, as I’ll have to mostly be casual, I won’t have time to go beyond PvP (where Shadow is king) and 5 mans, hence my question. Alternatively, can you viably heal 60 dungeons as Shadow?
---
Oh boy. Good luck with that! Any tips?
---
Because retailers are stupid? Seriously who knows. Trash is such a huge portion of any raid that not caring about it is really dumb.
---
Level ALL the classes.
---
Bosses take 2-3 min each to kill. A raid can last hours.
---
And you think trash DPS is insignificant? :D
---
Immersion. The world is inconsistently consistent. It’s like real life where every class has true strengths and weaknesses. Imbalance is reality. Shit ain’t balanced IRL, that’s what made succeeding in wow so satisfying.
---
I didn’t dismiss the issue, I think if the text is actually different then the animations and front/text should be changed in beta to match original vanilla.
---
All I’m saying right now is that there isn’t substantial evidence. All OP has provided are gifs from two points in the games history that aren’t related to classic.
---
If you want people who *don’t care* to support it, or even those who do care, you should provide substantial data. All I see is someone looking for something else to whine about and two gifs from completely unrelated points in the game. From your attitude it actually seems more likely that you’re just supporting it out of habit, and are looking for something to be upset over. From what you said, you see a difference in the gifs. That’s fine, but if it wasn’t something you caught in the beta then how do you know your mind isn’t playing tricks on you?
---
All I’m saying is that if OP wants to make a real point then find a clip from vanilla and recreate it in the beta. Stop fear mongering and finding stupid shit to complain about, make sure it’s an actual issue with substantial evidence. One example of the combat text being different in completely different expansions is not evidence.
---
&gt; You gotta be doing some meme shit
---
If buff and debuff stacking counts as "some meme shit", sure :)
---
Tauren or NE Druid?
---
thats what im going to go for as a human, i think. safer bet.
---
RemindMe! 27 August 2019
---
I remember grinding for weeks to get mats for AR. The satisfaction when I finally equipped it and ran around showing it off in Orgrimmar was priceless. Watching low lvls inspect it... Good times.
---
If you liked running instances and constantly being asked to run instances, life at 60 was awesome.
---
Night Elf Warrior. Because of that sweet dodge bonus.
---
I didn't raid, I got pre-raid BiS but all of the guilds had a plethora of warriors.
---
I used my rogue and warlock to farm gold. Maybe I was missing something, but prot warrior was not very good at making gold.
---
Tanking instances, I love tanking. I was in a group with a skilled warrior and a skilled healer, so we were speed running all of the 5 mans, chain pulling the entire thing.
---
Well, unfortunately that's not how it's going to be. 
---
When people get into general chat to express their frustration, they'll mostly receive answers like "go back to retail", I guarantee it.
---
WSG tho.
---
Okay. Then why don’t you just wait a few weeks till the tourists have left?
---
Well, in terms of least problems with this scenario assuming OP plays a troll/orc specific class: yes.
---
In terms of social/enjoyment/experience in game factor: who knows? Maybe we have a situation here where the BF is a complete noob and the run to Durotar seems hard, better to ease them in. We don't know just from this post.
---
I'm still somewhat upset to this day.
---
I lost count the amount of times our rogue core evasion tanked bosses I'm vanilla while we ressed the tanks. Nefarion, Instructor Razuveus, Twin Emps. Christ we had some butt puckering moments. Sounds like an awesome way to get that achievement.
---
 For me not necessarily nightsaber but I would prefer a different mount. Reason being rolling a gnome and having mechanostrider as default. Absolutely hate that one.
---
 But hitting exalted rep is tricky. Have done it on a private server but the quests there gave full rep even if the quests were grey. Also there was spillover rep, will this exist in classic? 
---
 Even if no spill over and a heavy rep penalty for low level quests it will still be possible to grind up the rep very high and then get the last by doing repeatable quests( cloth turn in, exist some others) but I'm not sure it's worth it. You are not going to have any freedom when you play if you plan to do another factions quests. Will have to plan out everything and make sure you do quests in an exact order to not outlevel them. Classic is going to be more fun if you just do quests in whatever order and can jump around zones freely. Will probably go with that option and just suck it up and have that horrible mechanostrider.
---
I will be going druid, as I like being an underdog. Its personally far more satisfying performing despite the odds. 
---
But as far as raiding, I dont know how much I will be raiding, as I already did the content back in Vanilla, and compared to current raids, they are mostly trivial. Outside Naxx imo.
---
Hope youre right with instant invites. My first goal is getting an UBRS key when hitting 60, which I suspect will make me quite desireable.
---
"Great, another post on
---
* this may be unpopular but min max is the right way
---
* this may be unpopular but min max is the wrong way
---
or
---
* my way is best and yours is dumb
---
\----- oh?"
---
Thanks for the post. "XXX-way is my way and everything else is fine too" are the rarest of the posts and my personal favorite. 
---
No comment on the dwarf jokes though? By far the best reason to play them. "I don't have a drinking problem. I drink, I get drunk,  I fall down... no problem!"
---
This is a speed vs. safety mentality. The modern game is all about speed and efficiency, the game 15yrs ago was about just finishing the content (raid, dungeon, whatever) at all. 
---
Big DPSers are great if there is no threat to the party, but the point this guide is making is that big DPSers don't matter when you wipe to poor target management
---
I would highly recommend if you're interested in WoW, game development or how Blizzard used to operate. It's got interesting insights all throughout and is well written. Plus Staats is a big printing nerd so the physical copy is a beautiful book printed on lovely paper with glossy photos and what not haha. Perfect coffee table book
---
When I played, I never did a lot of end game content. By the time I was in my late 50s, approaching 60, BC was released. 
---
Now I get the chance to experience some of the content I missed out on which excited me the most.
---
No there isnt. 
---
Link me ONE single damage text addon that can display damage numbers using the mobs position in the 3D world instead of drawing numbers on a 2D surface.
---
Changing the behaviour of the text to emulate Vanilla is NOT possible with an addon. In the future I advice not posting about random shit you never cared to look into.
---
How can I convince *my* friend to try classic? I've been talking about it ever since the announcement and showed him hundreds of classic videos. He's a legion fanboy despite only having played for about one month and he hates classic with a passion for no real reason
---
I like both.
---
How long did it take?
---
As a mage playing on a pserver I often view my top priority as keeping the healer alive. As long as the tank is ok and is quick about gathering up stray mobs I find this to be the most effective way to prevent wipes when things go south.
---
The 1.12 portion is supposed to be what text and stats are on for spells and abilities mostly.
---
You are free to link the addon and prove us all wrong though. Funny how people who know they are wrong never bother with evidence.
---
It is mana intensive but unless you're in Naxx most fights don't last long enough to oom you with this spec, especially if you're bringing mana pots/runes - its obviously not efficient but sometimes that isn't important.
---
Hots are a powerful part of the resto toolkit so it makes no sense to just have all the druids in raid spamming HT. Generally 1 druid should be regrowth spec, the rest specced for HT, and you can even have one of the deep resto druids swiftmend your hots off the tank for extra efficiency.
---
So there is a video out there of a streamer looting the Gurubashi arena chest, switching layer and lotting it again within a minute of each other.
---
There was also a video of someone mining the same thorium vein multiple times switching layers to get the node instantly refreshed.
---
Blizz has responded with putting an internal cooldown for players switching realms.
---
I thinking it is actually necesarry to solve alot of the problems that exist at launch and at early stages of the game.
---
However the potential for abuse, i.e. getting more things/kills on a server than are anticipated, is huge and could impact economies in bad ways.
---
It also unnaturally disconnects the server, in vanilla there is a huge importance on community. Layering essentially divides the community.
---
Maybe the post script should encourage blizz to closely monitor layering abuse and other issue involving layering.
---
I dont remember cause it was back in actual vanilla but multiple hours xD.
---
https://youtu.be/uZjpmvXp_hk
---
Wrong expansion but this video really encapsulates my hype.
---
The real question here is why you would give your opinion on leveling classes you clearly never leveled.
---
In that case, you’ll be in far less demand as a Druid tank than warrior.  Druid is on my list of possible mains at the moment as well, but a lot of people will stick their nose up at you as a Druid tank, even for 5/10 man content even though they’re completely viable.  
---
Same for raiding, but the concept is similar.  At most, a guild will bring 1 bear off tank, but it’s completely optional and not needed.  You can improve your odds by being willing to heal and off tank when needed tho.
---
He keeps posting videos from 70+ content and comparing to to retail. 
---
I literally don’t see a single comparison of Classic VS Vanilla. It’s like complaining that a Burger King whopper doesn’t look like Five Guys when you ordered a Bic Mac from McDonalds.
---
I think the last good games came out in march 2017
---
Tauren. 
---
That sweet shapeshift out -&gt; warstomp -&gt; heal
---
&gt;Also I see we're making slight hyperbole in how different classic and retail are in this regard lol. You don't start with super high crit
---
You are joking right? Last time I played (legion) I had 70% crit chance just from speccing into Fire with full blue gear as a mage.
---
Yes you can.  Just be aware if you pick something like Shaman all your skill trainers and class quests are on Kalimdor.
---
Whether it's there or not you'll also be trying a long with the hundreds of us planning to get a head start on our twinks
---
Better go in 35.
---
Actually, it doenst Matter at all. When the mob is in range so are you. Just gotta dance around that range (10yards?) Instead of Dancing around the melde hitbox. The Video actually Shows leeway having very little Impact but it widens the kiting Radius you gotta use.
---
Man this seems like a part-time job and less like a game haha! How do you know if you’re top-50 for a Rag kill?
---
Thanks! 
---
Yes, the jokes, easily the best!
---
Other people have posted gifs and videos, and if you don't believe them (?) then just go and youtube some vanilla wow content?
---
Here, try [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok)
---
Cool book
---
Met my ex-wife in vanilla, hope to find a knew skank this time around
---
Im afraid youre right, but Im hoping the perception of druids might be different this time around. Otherwise I think all it takes is a few people giving you a shot, performing high, and they will call you again. In the worst case, Ill just have to stick with my own group of friends and their playtimes
---
There was no way back then to know it would become the rarest mount in the game. Allowing people to get it now will just make it lose its prestige and uniqueness.
---
There are many thing which were available at start and won't be in Classic wow, deal with it.
---
&gt;all the rest of the raid mounts that followed complete trash. 
---
no
---
?
---
Vulture quest is the easy one. There's a lot of them. Just run between their spawn points with a timer and you have the quest in no time.
---
You mean salt flats venom quest right?
---
I think you're applying daylight savings time when it won't actually apply until october 6th or something. Sydney time is +10 gmt in August. Also as it isn't DST then, Queensland are also at +10 gmt.
---
Loot Council, Sign up on Homepage.
---
Go with +17 hours of you're in the eastern states.
---
I actually like Plate 2.5. The other sets though look just terrible. The AQ weapons are Hella cool though.
---
I think you are missing the point. No addons would not make game harder in a good way. You could not gear players as you would have no fucking clue wich mage is doing damage and who is sniffing glue under the table.
---
Dude get him to go to barrens, IMO barrens is the best and funnest
---
Remind Me! 27 August 2019
---
I main tanked (not very well) in TBC when I was 14 and my computer was a potato. You'll be fine.
---
Exactly. I was at the point where I had my mostly Bis gear preraid plus some MC and Ony gear but still ran UBRS and other dungeons cause there was rare items like Hide of the beast and chromatic carapace that were useful for Rag, plus a good source of dragon scales. We used to ran it with lvl 58 people too so you had people from not even 60 up to people raiding still needing the dungeons everyone else was doing.
---
What do the health benefits look like and is there a 401K match?
---
This is making me want to roll on an RP server worst case.
---
10/10 RP
---
This. If you dont keep some servers Vanilla, the whole "We want Vanilla" movement, which literally started in TBC will restart. If people want to play Vanilla forever, assuming there is enough population, they should be able to. I am hoping for TBC, but I like the idea of keeping my Vanilla toons if I want to run something with them.
---
If they go to a rotating server where they start you over at the end, I'm officially out. I dont want to spend hours grinding something just to have it eventually disappear, and have to do it over again one day. No thanks.
---
I miss when I was just an adventurer, and not the champion.
---
Ah, is cross region character transfer currently not possible in retail wow?
---
Probably not the type of answer you're looking for:
---
I made it to level 60 as a Mage with Enchanting and Tailoring. I was dead broke. Self promoting enchanting was something I didn't feel comfortable doing and planning ahead the tailoring cooldown for profitable crafts was also something I did not have a handle on.
---
At the time I made my choices for RPG reasons and looking back I definitely did not have a grasp on the MMO portion of the game. I found crafting and enchanting my gear very satisfying and shuffling cloth into enchanting matts did make enchanting smoother.
---
If you are ok spamming enchanting recipes in trade and good with self promoting you can make a pretty penny with enchanting. If you are looking to list stuff on the AH and have your goods sell themselves, probably pick a different profession.
---
Side note: For money I largely did fishing. Wailing Caverns entrance is still one of the cooler zones to this day and I would just chill there(UI hidden, auto loot on, ambient noise only, fishing mapped to mouse button) while watching TV, catching bags of Deviate Fish.
---
To be fair they never said no changes
---
Prove it kid.
---
Just put yourself out there, be proper, make good In-game choices and you good to go. Age usually isn't a problem if you act mature.
---
That's a typical old man joke tho. Every time someone writes 'Whalecum!' I see them as a balding 40year old.
---
As a guild leader I'd probably want to use loot council. But as a raider I'd prefer a dkp system. Feels difficult (at this time, probalby changes once Im actually in a guild and get to know the peeps there) to trust the loot council wont be corrupt and favour their own friends or themselves.
---
Loot council is the most beneficial for the raid overall but with dkp everyone feel more equal. (granted you get a raid spot every time you sign up)
---
I just want to play with my friends again. Hopping in discord and just hanging with the boys.
---
Simple is better so just flat DKP for time then extra per boss. Time coefficient goes up for progression with a bigger bonus for first time clears. Then the best for distribution is a blind round of bids with the highest bid getting the chance to outbid in round 2. Very simple and very effective.
---
Not that I've heard of, although it's probably worth a try to open a ticket and ask when the time comes.
---
Play what you want and you will be granted a spot.
---
Population will indeed decrease when retail ppl understand that you need 2 months to get to 60.
---
Thats what I am talking about! Now I dont feel so bad for spending $2500 on a new gaming rig that is completely illogical to play Wow on because my old one could have handled it just fine. Your dedication, good sir, is truly epic.
---
Why keep spamming?
---
I thoroughly enjoyed it myself as well. The book goes in to depth vanilla coming together mostly following John Staats experience but he was curious of others and includes their stories too. It talks about crunch, quests, alpha, beta, servers, getting Korea in on launch, game engines, cut vanilla content and Coworkers coming into known roles.
---
s a l t y   s c o r p i d   v e n o m
---
i still have nightmares.
---
I know it's off topic. But I can't wait for the hunters to cry when they find out that the leaf won't drop from domo till phase 2 (and I'm saying that as a hunter myself lol)
---
Love it. My home desktop is fairly new but I built it with only integrated graphics as I wasn’t gaming at the time. I’ll add a GPU in a heartbeat if it can’t handle MC/AV/etc.
---
Nice! I was thinking of doing the same thing, and setting a desk up in the basement, I just cant figure out how to configure the room so it doesn't look retarded. :(
---
Play what you want to play, the time investment is too large in classic to play any class other than the one you can actually have fun with.
---
Sunder armor is gonna be there
---
&gt;And just to clarify, Im talking specifically outside raiding.
---
There will be a shortage of tanks outside raiding. And too many tanks for raids. It's simply a numbers game. 20% of a dungeon group is tank. Less than 8% of a raid is tank.
---
Tanks will easily find dungeon groups -&gt; Tanks will easily get pre-raid BiS gear because they aren't competing against other players in the dungeon -&gt; That means tanks will stop grinding dungeons much sooner than other classes -&gt; That again means there are even less dungeon tanks -&gt; That means the remaining tanks will get pre-raid BiS gear even faster -&gt; Repeat.
---
RAID tanking is an entirely different scenario. You will probably have a hard time getting a raid spot as tank immediately. You'll probably be relegated to offtanking, perhaps even dps'ing.
---
The Corehounds respawned until you'd killed Magmadar. The Lava Surgers respawned until you'd killed Garr.
---
It is notoriously in the running for worst spec in vanilla pve raid content alongside enhancement shaman and boomkin
---
A sense of achievement when getting gear. 
---
I want to be able to rightfully flex hard-to-get stuff in a town hub. Lots of MMOs these days just give you the mount, pet, gear so damn easily.
---
Postage is reasonable. I just ordered a copy to France and only paid $7 postage.
---
You might be ok with integrated. If not, and you are only really playing Wow, you can get a decent GPU that will handle it relatively inexpensively. If you are familiar with GPU's and stuff, my laptop has a 1050Ti in it, and it ran Classic beautifully at 1080p. You can pick one of those up on eBay for under $100, or even a 1060 6gb is under $150. If you are running a resolution above 1080p though, you will have to shell out a little more.
---
&gt;Simple questions thread
---
&gt;What is the meaning of life?
---
Ok we’re taking this a bit too literally
---
It looked fine on the stress test so I’ll roll with it for now. But ya, prepared to shell out some bucks once live hits and it’s put to the test.
---
Those aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
 Tpt  4.

---
Go male Night Elf. The pinnacle of ugly!
---
Most of my friends who played back in the day are as much hyped as I am. Some are still fighting with the idea because of IRL stuff. But I'm not too much worried as they will all sooner or later give in to the hype as soon as the game is out. 
---
I think a lot of people here underestimate how many people will try it out as soon as they are just two clicks and a few dollars away from joining their friends/coworkers who - for the first few weeks and months - nonstop talk about their adventures in Azeroth.
---
This is news to me. I believe it, but I’d love to see some math. Have you seen anyone write it out? Or are you trusting it from experience?
---
Yeah you end up fighting just because you don’t want to die. Even if both players don’t want to fight, there’s no way of communicating it so you end up trying to get the first hit just to get an advantage.
---
Crossrealm BGs was in vanilla. But they called it 'battlegrounds' then.
---
I think I was in cyclone(?), There was about 4 servers per battleground shard iirc.
---
Isn't fairy fire useful? 
---
And combat res?
---
DPS may be not so high, but combat res should make up for that, no?
---
Thats great, man! Hopefully your spending is done. :) Assuming you want it to be...
---
The issue comes after the tourists leave, not at the launch

What book is this from?
---
I dont consider myself a shill, I'm just tired of people arguing about something and trying to come up with solutions when they dont understand the actual problem blizzard are trying to solve, its just a bunch of nonsensical circlejerking.  
---
" as far I can see in your post history, you are hard core shilling for layering "
---
and you're doing the same against layering, except you actually came up with a solution that isnt basically low lvl zone sharding.
---
What do you think is the problem blizzard is trying to solve?
---
They don’t ban you for buying gold anymore.
---
I don't see how you can logically come to that conclusion. We're not excited for Classic because we want to run through old questlines on hard mode in what might as well be single player.
---
That is the first I’ve heard of this can you provide proof because this is great otherwise and it will mean people will have to walk to a spot and see if it’s occupied then change layers until it isn’t.
---

---
use this spec for leveling as enhancer with a twohanded weapon + windfury. you can also put on healing gear and heal dungeons.
---
As apposed to intelligent non wow related drug abuse.
---
It is both - you can control the number of people in the starting zone by having a small layer size on launch day then increasing it to 3k once the first people are hitting 60.
---
Because I would want to save them incase other friends both RL and ingame might want to play with me or vice-versa in the future and if I have had used them, I couldn't invite them anymore and also, why would I invite a random? That seems silly to me, I don't give a shit about some random player.
---
I thought about a full non invite stop to, and it's not a bad idea, I just figured some players would want to play with their friends and this might become another issue.
---
And again, if you get some inconsistency with the use of invites like people selling their invites, it's fine, again you're not aiming for a perfect 50/50 balance, you're just preventing extreme levels of inbalance.
---
But like I said, this was just a suggestion, I'm sure much better solutions can be created.
---
No there is not, blizzard removed certain commands or blocked access  to them when they implemented the new combat text. 
---
From what I gathered they completely remade the entire combat text because the old one was too CPU intensive and they just remade it. But they never added the old combat text animations nor you can alter them
---
You can spec a 30% speed increase in cat form at level 21. Travel form 9 levels later is just a minor improvement that isn't able to stealth or fight effectively.
---
I plan to have 2-3 AH sniping running at all times, keeping an eye out on all the twink and important pre-raid epic pieces.
---
Park level 1 toon on important vendor all over azeroth, log in check on separate account once or twice a day to snag recipe and regents.
---
Profession on all toons, particularly multiple transmute and tailor cooldown running at all times. 
---
Farm the shit out of DM:tribute on spare time. Should net 120g+/hr
---
Aye. Of course it affects the game. Naive to think otherwise.
---
The time they put in to MC definitely showed
---
What did they fire the GMs for, can you elaborate?
---
Pretty stupid, tbh.
---
Also most of those changes happened before blizzard and activision merged.
---
because the alliance is filled with cat ladies ?
---
The nice thing is that you gain skills when disenchanting items. Iirc, there is a certain level of items where you have to have your enchanting at a certain level in order to disenchant. 
---
I believe the answer is yes you would need to level it up, but luckily, disechanting those early level greens and blues should help out.
---
well said
---
I mainly want to do PvP, but also I’d much rather level up on a PvE realm. Is there any hope or finding a PvP guild on a PvE realm, or should I just bite the bullet and go PvP?
---
thank you "bigcheesetim" very cool
---
From what I've seen of the stress tests they also have overspawning in starting zones - the mob respawns are around 1 minute in the 1-6 areas when they are busy.
---
You cruel, cruel man
---
The skill floor has been lowered while the skill ceiling has been increased.
---
It is accurate. With new methods to gold farming, people make golds easily. Payo (a streamer) had about 1000 g and was lending other streamers gold.
---
farming gold is my passion. I make 2 million every day in retail wow, I feel I would hit that 300k goal in classic much earlier than I planned.
---
Questie
---
Bejeweled flightpathing was the best, made TBC so much nicer.
---
This was by far my favorite memory of classic wow. That and kiting mobs on the first boss of black wing lair. I loved playing a hunter
---
I mean, I've booked 2 weeks of holiday to play on release and I work a full time job.. me and a group of friends have done this
---
Offering assignments i can choose from. Well that is an offer nobody can't refuse.
---
Yeah man I miss the 1 hour queue times. Sometimes 2 hours on a twink /s
---
" ??? You were the person who suggested 7 servers, not me. Don't try to flip this on buddy. Now you're attacking me over something you started. That's gold. You won't even respond to feedback, but still try to shut it down. You're completely illogical. "   
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO you literally said "7 is too many sub-server"  
---
I said 7 layers at first as a hypothetical.  
---
You decided that "7 sub-servers are too many"  
---
I ask how can you decide whats 2 many when ur idea was having static realms and that literally goes against what blizzard wants (everyone to play)  
---
What do you mean none of my arguments has many any LOGICAL sense, im starting to think you dont even know half the words you're spewing out.
---
[deleted]
---
From 2.2-2.3 they accidentally readded it.  I had so much fun exploring again in TBC: World ZG, behind the AQ gates, behind strat, a bunch of random peaks around the map.  The world felt so big and it felt fun to "beat" the developers back then.
---
We were students back in vanilla.  Now we are in our 30s
---
Just do it dual boxing...
---
No it wasn't, 60/40 wasn't so bad, the shitstorm surrounding the topic was due to the extreme levels of unbalance, 10-20 minutes of queue times wasn't that bad, even I got them even tho I played in the faction with less player base, but alot of factions in alot of servers reached levels like HOURS of queue time, literally they could get 1.5-2 hours of queue time, the shitstorm surrounding the topic was mostly due to these extreme inbalanced servers.
---
I literally had friends who got hours of queue but still hated the cross realm feature after while because it literally killed BGs and almost everyone stopped playing them, you jumped in now and then but quickly got bored, there was no social aspect to it anymore, no premades, no cooperation, everyone literally stopped talking to each other and just went in played for while without giving a shit about the objectives anymore and then stopped playing.
---
Some unbalance is still better then a aspect of the game that no one plays anymore.
---
Is this from stern?
---
Do bleeds (specifically Druid pounce, rip, and rake) scale off attack power?
---
My opinion is that Blizz choices come down to whats cost effective and profitable, though they spin it thats its for the good of the player never about money. While there are plus sides for the consumer there are also negatives and people value each differently.
---
I get not everyone shares the same opinions and some people will hate queues while others will have more time and patience. Like xrealm BG's both sharding and layering take away alot from what would be community and relationship building time for me. I would rather deal with queues and potential server mergers personally.
---
 I would like to spend phase 1 getting to know the people on my realm  and finding a guild to fit my playstyle. I guess with layering some of those people I will not see very often, people that maybe I would have seen and interacted with without layering. It will be harder to build that reputation for yourself and relationships with people passing through layers. Unless they are quite limited not 5+ on a server. I hated Xrealm bg's for the same reasons people I got too know and fought with and against suddenly became just random guys rather than rivals and friends. Just passing through like doing dungeons in retail no need to communicate may not ever see them again. To save queue times, is Vanilla wow even a thing for people with no time or patience?
---
Why do they even have servers on retail? With all the sharding you may aswell just log into the game and be done with it. Its the best way to save money, so much less dead space where there could be a player. Do servers even exist anymore? Probably all dynamic and running in some Amazon farm somewhere saving those pennies. Im still not sure what happens when phase 1 is ending and there are still servers with 15k+ people and multiple layers? Do they just hope that is not the case?
---
Just farm cloth it’s faster
---
How annoying is the Druid rez cooldown when healing group content and 5 mans? Trying to decide between Shaman and Druid, and that's a big sticking point.
---
Yea I really miss getting farmed by premaids all day and 2 hour ques rofl gtfo.
---
In the stress tests they have clearly been experimenting with setting the layer size so that the starting zones are playable - its not always 3k. I believe the reason blizzard prefer layering over just sharding the starting zones is that it solves both problems - dead servers and unplayable starting zones on launch.
---
When young me started playing in late vanilla I often got pissed because of mobs teaming up to kill me instead of going after eachother. 
---
I always asked why wolves and bears would team up to kill me instead of going after eachother, even though it made sense AI wise.
---
This is barely readable. I'm pretty sure this guy used up his lifetime supply of ellipses.
---
I'd guess 40/60 in favor of horde at the start. Undead racial too good to miss for PvP. It'll balance out hopefully.
---
Other than the name, how is it any different to the end user experience?
---
 It is clearly not working as they described - people are switching layering without joining and leaving a group.
---
These caused same-faction griefing too
---
TBC Without flying, would be fucking awesome
---
Layering does not aim to fix the early level bottleneck issue. It is a solution to realms that would otherwise be dead in three months. It allows Bliz to scale back the realms to a healthy population at the end of phase 1. Now is their math right? Only Sargeras knows.
---
I just want a nightsaber for the looks but I like this theory more, I am now a proud cat lady
---
They dominate flexibility bro ;)
---
The items wouldn't change but he new ones that dropped have different stats
---
This is how it functioned in early patches of vanilla. You can find old forum posts to back this up. Would be an interesting idea for sure and something I've played around with in my mind. However I don't see blizzard going this route as much as I would love it.
---
RemindMe! 27 august 2019
---
Wow, thanks. That’s pretty wild
---
For alot of final bosses you would want a fully prepare raid carrying their weight. Optimizing buffs, spec, rotations, gear, etc. Also raid composition and attendance was massive.
---
However Nihilum's world first KT kill on youtube is from the POV of an undead fury warrior. Clearly not the optimal horde race for dps, orc or troll far out perform undead. Thier main tank was a tauren, not optimal for a threat/dps output. So it is not a necesarry requirement for raiding, casual or progression.
---
This being said, for people who want to push world first in WoW: Classic I'm sure race and faction will play a large part in what they play, much like world first races in retail. That's totally cool.
---
On paper this is true...but I'm too old and cynical to stand around and watch the RL, officers, and their girlfriends get all of the gear again. I'll go with what is the flawed DKP system for 1000, Alex.
---
pretty much explains why there's very little aoe dps for most classes in classic
---
I mean, it's happening.
---
Why is picking a class so hard?
---
Like, I kinda want to play hunter but at the same time it sucks playing a class that so many other people will also play.
---
Thank you for the answers. Was that graph made on reddit or another site?
---
Just a heads up, most database rep values are incorrect, and true values will be much lower. I am planning to do a similar thing alliance side, and was quite sad to see every quest with 250 rep actually gave 100 rep on the stress test. It will require a lot more cloth farming than I initially thought.
---
Warlock.
---
Fantastic. Thanks mate
---
this belongs in 9gag.
---
I'd say 30, at 20 you dont get to experience at lot of dungeon and druid will really shine on there when you say you can heal dps or tank. As rogue, you'll have a hard time getting a full group.
---
Each continent is a discreet zone.  there are 3 per continent.  6000/6=1000
---
Both would work but if you trust someone the latter would be easier 🤗
---
It can, but they've given no indication that they plan to do so.
---
what mapmaker did you use to make this map?
---
Love theese kinds of memorys. Ty for sharing. Afterwards you realise what close call it was and it all comes down to seconds or even miliseconds sometimes. Quick thinking!
---
I played a little classic and stress tests on my wife’s brand new 2019 MacBook Air. Had graphics at medium settings and was still dropping frames probably running 40fps or so, turned down the distance and ran much smoother. I did not try it on classic settings, I’m sure it would run fine on classic, I got used to it after a little bit but noticed I would get a slight headache if I played on it for a while. But because of this and not wanting to occupy my wife’s MacBook for classic, I ordered a laptop with a dedicated GPU. DELL has a good sale right now and there’s always deals on amazon and new egg.
---
Having something meaningful to do for the entire duration of a play session every single time I log into the game.
---
Oh yeah, that was a pita and now you know who to blame lol
---
When you run ubrs 50 times and lose briar to a druid. Really stings
---
Why do you care how others play?
---
Exactly! It'll slow down the process, which is why I thought about counting in the spillovers quests :-)
---
There's going to be a very low percentage of players actually in MC before phase 2.
---
What would you even count for the playerbase here? If one side has more level 1 bank alts it stops everyone from rolling that faction? Even if the imbalance at 60 BGs might be skewed the other way \^\^
---
This may be a dumb question, but how do you find premades? Do they recruit like guilds?
---
* Frost Mage
---
* SM/Ruin Warlock
---
* Holy Paladin
---
* Disc Priest
---
* MM Hunter
---
I think a few points jockeyed around for PvP here and there keep your PvE looking pretty good as well, so "every single point" seems silly
---
Games don't really grow anymore in modern days. They usually have an initial 'boom' from the "tourists" or people that want to play what their favorite streamer is playing. 
---
Classic is way too slow of a game with very a "high effort, low reward" system, the youth these days are too used to instant gratification.
---
I agree with that. There is no DKP system that's 100% fair to everyone. If people fight over loot, it doesn't matter if it's DKP or Loot Council.
---
Agree so much. The new damagenumbers suck and  doesn't make you worship a big crit as much. The old popping effect was so cool.
---
I second this. I’ve been practicing leveling different classes and warlock has been the fastest/cheapest/least gear dependent of them all. 
---
Hunter is a little more annoying just due to having no pet until level 10. After that it’s basically just as easy as warlock with almost no downtime while grinding/questing. 
---
Just be prepared to be a second class citizen to the tanks and healers and top tier dps. You won’t ever be as special. Just kind of there to fill a dps spot.
---
Yep. Just cut the health of all lfr mobs by 75%,  remove titan forging, and let it flex scale so queues move fast. It's not a terrible idea to have a tourist mode for non-raiders and alts trying to see the conteng, the problem with it today is that its about as fun as giving yourself a tobasco enema, takes hours, and has a chance of awarding crazy TF BIS loot.
---
I've never heard those would be problems.. Wouldn't it be as simple as Blizz increasing the population limit for phase one?
---
Bean is a really good classic hunter
---
herp derp, no, it's not. It's to first gradually raise the cap across all realms and only then add more if those get too full to the point where they would remain above the desired 3k\~ cap once the spike dies down (they can predict the numbers better than I can, obviously).
---
If you don't crit though, you don't get the mana refund.
---
I remember scrolling through the ah wondering why do many people were selling below vendor price.
---
This morning I got in a bidding war with some guy over some embersilk cloth that had no buyout price. Ended up getting it for 15s, very nice. This is why you need to set a starting bid on your items
---
Im all for dynamic respawns, but I think people would blow up even more about that
---
Real life friends it’s normal to have
---
Never said that. In the comments I said I'm fine with healing
---
Running dungeons w my guildmates
---
More than often a guild that has a clearly corrupt loot council will have a reputation for it, so doing a little research can go a long way. Also if you do a few raids and notice that the loot council is clearly favoring themselves/their friends you simply find a different guild. But honestly I cant say ive ever really experience a corrupt loot council before. While it may seem easy enough to abuse from the outside you gotta remember the officers of a guild want the guild to succeed to get better gear so abusing loot council is a quick way to get a lot of good gear but in the long run you're only screwing yourself out of better gear in the future since a corrupt loot council guild will have a lot more trouble keeping members and thus progressing. Its more beneficial to have a fair and honest loot distribution and any guild leaders worth their salt realize this.
---
I'd love to see your thoughts after 15 minutes of that said chaos. People often don't realize that the chaos actually ensues for days on end. I agree it's fun for a quick fleeting moment,  but it gets old  quickly.
---
TL;DR please
---
[Bean](https://twitch.tv/bean) is the best Hunter streaming classic right now. And he will be in the horse duel tournament today also. [Zeroed](https://twitch.tv/zeroedtv) is another good Hunter, but not as experienced as bean.
---
Looking good. Do you know a good .json editor or do you just edit the raw files to make new routes? Thanks.
---
You’re either a troll or never played vanilla. It’s unforgiving my dude. You’ll see.
---
In classic yes now it's about doing the most damage how blizzard has gotten so lost
---
Waaayyy cooler than being yelled at to wipe so the party can try again in a couple minutes with no consequence
---
Tank population in Vanilla private servers/classic is much higher than 'back then' and later expansions. Same with healers.
---
That being said, there's still a lot more DPS than tanks/healers.
---
Most videos I have seen have said that you take two gatherings solely to vendor the mats. AH won't be worth it at the beginning, but if you're leveling as you go you will be in a good spot to farm things like Thorium and Black Lotus once at max level, which will sell for a good amount once the economy is flowing.
---
Did you watch the video? The world isn’t black and white. The video shows an extremely bad combat mechanic.
---
I mean layer hopping aside. The idea is that 12k of that 15k is tourism, so each server should only have a normal number of no-life speed levelers. If they have 5 layers they'll have 5 times as many resources to split between them until everyone else catches up.
---
I played on private servers and this didn’t exist.
---
I don't really thing you limit creation of characters what you limit is the volume of players that can be on from any one faction with a bit of liquidity - you would say on a 3k player cap allow 1.4k alliance, 1.4k horde with 200 liquidity.
---
I'm not sure I'd have fun playing with people new to the game. Sounds frustrating. I suppose some people enjoy that though
---
What makes warrior so bad at 1v1s and which alliance race is the best at PvP?
---
Horde dueling tournament? What time is that? (Est). And thank you, not very up to date with this stuff.
---
Not sure if this is sarcasm or not lol
---
&gt;Just be prepared to be a second class citizen to the tanks and healers and top tier dps. You won’t ever be as special. Just kind of there to fill a dps spot.
---
I disagree wholeheartedly with this statement though.
---
The skill ceiling is extremely high for a warlock or a hunter. A skilled hunter or lock can be close to immortal in 5 mans and save groups from wiping with clutch kiting, cc, pets, and being generous with healthstones.
---
Learn to use your whole kit with either class and you'll never feel like a "lesser" dps.
---
Mining in Un Goro Crater
---
I thought the camp was erased in cata.
---
I never had enough free time to properly analyze some underlying methodology that Joana might use and lost all interest in ever doing it after the bluepost about parry chance against three level higher monsters. Following something that's intended for hunters will be a nightmare for other classes and I wanted to make something that anyone could follow with ease.
---
Based on feedback, people seem to land somewhere around the 5 days played mark which is pretty standard for someone who isn't doing alot of unnecessary running during the early game and has a plan to get a mount as soon as they hit 40. I do clear very thoroughly and don't allow myself any rested experience, so players who find themselves ahead of my level estimation can be flexible with skipping content they might not want to do.
---
All of them have played WoW at one point. All of them quit due to it getting ridiculously easy. So presenting classic to them. Was like giving a heroin addict a spoon and lighter.
---
You really aren't understanding this... Same number of servers. I'm assuming they are NOT going to end up on the same severs.
---
I've explained it fine already though, so I'm not going to try again. Try rereading I guess?
---
If you're not willing to create and lead a guild it's not happening.
---
Hello there! Long-time WoW nerd here. I've leveled a few dozen warriors to 60 in Vanilla content over the years, and I've run into this issue before.  
---
If you want to have a mount sooner than later I would encourage you to focus on improving leveling strategies. Having gold farming techniques pre-40 is highly overrated. By the time you grind/farm enough gold for a mount at 40, you could have just been a *much* higher character level and earning double the gold per hour anyway.   
---
The value of drops and vendor trash skyrockets from 40-44 in such a way that unless you're powering crafting professions or spending gold on the AH you're gonna have a mount by 43-44 at the latest.
---
There are a few resources that you will find as you go along, but the reality is as long as you know what spec you want to play, the 1-60 journey will teach you more than any guides can! Guides are useful for knowing farming areas, how to level lockpicking etc
---
You see my dilemma then! But agree, I am really liking Mage for the reasons you mentioned.
---
you had to have a shit ton of time for that to experience that in limited time frame, vanilla was the best iteration of wow maybe but it wasn't about skill if you wanted to experience that, it was about time and most people didn't have the time to collect all you needed to collected in that limited time frame
---
with classic that might change so its not a big deal, but if you pay 15 euros a month plus the game and can't experience a big part of the content due to time that isn't really good game design
---
This fucking game is gonna be so easy this go around that you can clear this shit with 20 people and half of them meme specs. 
---
We under estimate just how bad we were back then
---
Playing with the same people on the same server all the time and getting to see people's reputations grow for better or worse. I've only played modern wow so cross realm had always killed this for me.
---
Join a good raiding guild and make sure you are an officer or the top mage dps.
---
Then run Naxx a lot and gather 40 splinters and there you go
---
It's hard to say what make warriors "bad". But usually they either get kited easily. The best thing about warriors is mortal strike and their cleave damage, neither is that impactful in 1v1's.
---
Alliance race is better for BG's because paladins are better. usually in worldpvp horde wins due to will of unforsaken or hardiness(orc stun resist), which is typically better than the ally variant of escape artist and stone form.
---
Warlock shits on mages in duels. Felhunter is such a OP pet, it is highly resistant to magic so you can't sheep or nova it, it can dispell mages auras or it can dispell the warlock out of nova or poly. There's some things the mage can do like keep up random buffs and detect magic on warlock and iceblock coil etc to make the fight more bearable, but usually it's in the warlocks favor.
---
you never progressed with mythic raiding have you?
---
method cleaned 3 different action houses for Jaina, the mechanics are in a completely different league from vanilla and gear matters a lot
---
I noticed that many of the dungeon tanks on the beta were just going full out dps and eschewing sword and board. How plausible is this actually? Is it more efficient to just take 4 dps?
---
A family so I can neglect them again
---
Re: best alliance race - it depends on which class you’re going to play. It also depends on whether you prefer to compliment your strengths or help cover your weaknesses. 
---
I highly recommend checking out MadSeason’s alliance race guide. He goes over all the races, their racial abilities, and gives his recommendations for best race for each class. https://youtu.be/YyFN01p2xLo
---
If you aren't playing with a group of people I wouldn't worry about considering what others are doing. Enjoy the game how you'd like to. Worst-case scenario: You level a hunter to 60, and later change your mind and switch to something else. Congratulations, your hunter will still be able to farm pretty great amounts of money which will be useful in any case.
---
People play Mythic. People watch Mythic get done. Just because your not interested in the difficult content doesn’t mean it’s a waste of time. If you remove Mythic you lose a lot of streamers and the top guilds. And if all the top tier players leave do you think the population will be fine after that? What about when people like Preach and Asmongold bitch about it and say that’s why they are quoting? You think those two won’t cause a bunch of people to unsub even if their viewers don’t Mythic raid?
---
Warrior slightly slower the difference for the rest is seconds more/less
---
Yes as a non-hunter i will probably go with your guide. BUT i do see some problems with it regarding contested zones at launch. I know from own experience on private servers that places like shimmering flats and other horde "dominating" zones are almost impossible to level on. So im just afraid that i will end up grinding mobs for 2 levels now and then because there are some quests that just cant be completed. But i guess there is no way around that anyway
---
Apparently, broadcasting items like this is more favored and you and I will be down voted for wisdom in regard.  People would rather be told the shortcut and make basically nothing from it in competition, than find it naturally and make enough to actually spend the gold.  🤣

Since then people have talked about it quite a bit, but I can't actually find videos showing it in action (and neither videos disproving it). It should be farely easy to test during the next stress test.s.

Then you would have to understand why layering even exists, to remove queue times due to the insane surge of people at launch.  
---
So if theres low lvl zone limited layering then if i go from lets say like Silverpine Forest (Layered zone) as an undead at lvl 20 and go into Hillsbrad Foothills (Non Layered zone) I would then get kicked from the server as soon as i step into Hillsbrad Foothills because all the layers &amp; the original server are full.  
---
Either you layer the whole world to make it consistent or you have sharding but then you need to raise the population cap on all the servers which has a whole plethora of annoyances that we see from these 10k vanilla private servers.
---
Rams are pretty badass.
---
Relax man. I’m responding to his specific idea of “static layers” which is functionally just an independent realm except more confusion for players who don’t understand what layering is. Be slower to slam the sperg button next time
---
- against ×10000
---
- if i had to give a concession to remove layering from the broader game, I'd say only allow it for the 1-5 zones.
---
- server clusters, better server management by Blizzard, clear warnings that joining servers marked as "full" will cause long queues.  I've asked pro-layering people "well what if the population doesn't decline, won't Blizz have to keep layering in?" and they usually list off quite a few ways manage servers without layering.  So then I say "well why not just use those methods to begin with?". So yeah, there's tons of better solutions that maintain world integrity.
---
I'm going to copy paste some posts people made that were straight up better worded than anything I can put together:
---
U/muesli_nom :
---
Furthermore, the whole defence for this feature just runs counter to Vanilla philosophy: "Waiting for spawns is not fun".
---
Yeah, having to build your own groups also is not fun. Drinking after every second mob is not fun. Actually walking to your dungeon also isn't fun. Wiping and running into respawn is not fun either.
---
My point is: The whole reason Vanilla/Classic is such a big draw is because it offers a counter to all the convenience of retail, because that convenience was paid for with a much shallower world, with much less focus on social interaction... and that is exactly the thrust that layering is going for: It buys convenience with less social interaction, with a compromised server community, with the integrity as "this server is our world" destroyed... and it is catering to those that just want to rush through content, for those that do not understand that a certain slowness and lack of comfort is an important part of what makes Vanilla Vanilla. I mean, seriously, for all that talk about the journey being soooo important to the experience, remarkably few people seem to be able to say "Yeah, well, I guess I'll wait out the first rush", or "oh well, I guess I'll group up for named mobs". No, everyone's slavering about not getting out of the blasted starting zones fast enough. Do you even hear yourselves?
---
In essence, everyone that is ready to accept layering - because they only see that it lets them progress faster/with less hassle - are exactly the kind of content locusts that made retail what it is today. Aight, bring on the downvotes of indignation, because apparently that's the majority of those "excited" for Classic these days.

edit: Yeah, and I'm tired of discussing layering, too - but it's such core flaw in Classic right now that it needs to be addressed. Trust me, I'd much rather talk about the fiftieth "are dorfen priests mandatory for raiding" topic than this, but it's got to be done.
---
U/miska- :
---
You’d think players would have chosen to receive Classic in an unaltered state, first and foremost. As was the plan. Not Classic: Save the Servers Edition.
---
I’ve been thinking about why some people suddenly went on board with layering. (this post is also aimed at Blizz)
---
It’s essentially because Blizzard presented players unpleasant scenarios from the past, and then said they provided a solution for them in case “bad things” happen. ("bad things" as in MMORPG specific situations, like big messy launches/community driven server populations, which have been notoriously discarded over the years for the detriment of the genre and its core audience)
---
What they didn’t say is, that the “bad things” (server queues, low pop realms) are actually worries on BLIZZARDS end, because on players end, it’s already been proven over and over again that it doesn’t impact their enjoyment of the game in any significant way (look at old WoW’s success, and the fact that Classic is even becoming a thing again). Whereas sharding/CRZ does harm their experience greatly, as we’ve seen in live for long enough now. But again, on Blizzards end, tech like sharding/CRZ seems super handy to use and“friendly” to players convenience wishes (fulfilling players convenience at the detriment of the game = big red button being pushed by Blizz). It’s the same situation all over again with layering, except with different names this time and miniscule alterations.
---
If players chose to support that “solution” (layering) Blizzard presented to them as such to avoid their “pain points” (waiting in queue, being on a low pop realm), it would be worth it the players mind, because they’d avoid their “unpleasant launch experience” and POTENTIAL “low pop realms” thanks to layering, according to Blizzard. Basically, Blizz said to players "here's where it's gonna hurt, don't you wand a bandaid?" and as always, players go "yes save us from the pain!" without a second thought that what they experience isn't even a wound to begin with - it's just a traditional MMORPG, one that the audience waiting for it craves really badly. Blizz sold them that they "think they want Classic, but they don't"..
---
Also, one key thing Blizzard doesn’t mention to the players, is that the Classic launch is supposed to be a unique, core part of an MMORPG, which Classic would be through and through if left intact. My guess is they don’t say it, because they forgot themselves what MMORPG’s are supposed to be all about, which they’ve proven to have forgotten because retail exists the way it does. They've sold themselves on their own fail plan.
---
TL;DR: What it comes down to essentially is: Blizz gave players an option to reduce their so called “pain points”, and as always, players flock to that without a second thought of how that will actually affect their gameplay once it’s in, and how they’ll relate to experiences that’ll come from changing the core gamplay like that in live.
---
And Blizzard thinks they’re gaining +points with players by doing that. WRONG! Don’t fall into that trap yet AGAIN! Look what it’s done to your game, and how disgruntled your players are cause you strayed off the niche path of making an MMORPG! Even Competitors copy WoW left and right, and now there is NO MMORPG out there that can fulfill the core audiences needs the way Classic could if you just let it! Listen to your dev brain, not players brain!! There’s a very good reason why’re you’re making the game, not the players!
---
Speaking of game designers, here’s Kevin Jordan, a Vanilla Dev, who explained the effect about how players are really bad at choosing their emotional experiences in the game really well in this short clip:
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/PoisedClumsySpiderANELE
---
It’s really time for Blizz to remember why MMORPG’s were so beloved in the days of old WoW, and what made them so great. And it’s also high time for them to say “NO!” to players asking for an out to reduce their pain points, because it’s NOT a pain point!! It’s a vital, core part of this type of game they either enjoy for the specialty it is, or they don’t!! MMORPG’S are not like any other game… it's a niche that thrives on a certain audiences mindset. Don’t change it up just to suit those who don’t care to play a unique game like that with it’s very own good and bad sides, which sets it apart from any other game out there! Let the game sell itself BECAUSE there is gonna be NOTHING like it out there on the market, and players are gonna love you for it! # nochanges
---
Just a feeling of community. It'll be nice to see people you've seen before, people talking in general and trade chat, people wandering around needing help with groups quests. I'm looking forward to it feeling like an MMORPG again.
---
Even just hanging out in the capital cities and shooting the shit with people, or advertising your professions in trade and people actually needing stuff from you because you bothered to level it.
---
Uhh the guy he replied to literally was talking about “almost as good gear” so yeah the discussion is about gear.
---
ESO has awesome crafting too. Especially the alchemy, from eating raw mats to find out a property to mixing and matching them to churn out different potions and poisons, and having every mat able to be used in any potion/potion instead of just predetermined recipes like in wow
---
Get in with a guild early, hope said guild goes has the skill and luck to get through Naxx, be the most dedicated mage on the server, hope that the guild leader or his girlfriend / wife isnt a class that can use the staff, realize one of these things are likely to fail and the plan goes to shit, hope Blizzard releases Classic TBC, form a group of 70s to go farm Naxx for your weapon
---
its stolen in the fact that its literally replicating the same world. all the npcs, art, names, items, all belong to blizzard. so yes, it is stolen.
---
Well if 12k of 15k are tourists, and 3k are normal players, this means without layering and normal servers there would be 600 real players and 2.4k tourists. These 600 split the resources between them. With 3k players, the split 5 times as many resources between them. That is totally fine and how it HAS to be, or there would be less resources than normally available.
---
There's more contributing factors other than being "top dps/heals". If you're not contributing outside of raids (aka being lazy and not farming consumables etc) then why the hell would he get it? Like I said, it's best not to set yourself up for disappointment.
---
Go horde, there's always more alliance players so the balance needs to be adjusted.
---
Days of chaos sounds good to me.
---
For a second I was like “really is it honestly that big of a deal” but after seeing it...yes, yes it is that big of a deal
---
If you're going for 5 man healing absolutely make a Shaman. They are far more versatile than Druids in that kind of environment. You have incredible AoE healing, totems provide a fantastic DPS increase for any party, and your spell kit utility is just superior (offensive dispel, remove diseases *and* poisons, Dirt-cheap AoE kiting).  
---
Some people note that Shaman healing scales the poorest as you get absolute BiS gear, but their utility only increases with time. For me, that makes them a force multiplier that no other healer can match.
---
Won't be a problem anymore.
---
I am for it on day one, for it in week one, and will be increasingly against it as time goes by. I hope the layers collapse really quickly as the initial surge of players subsides.
---
“There’s no point in leveling, it’s just numbers”.
---
It's in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c01d4s/when_are_hardcore_players_expecting_to_start
---
But he deleted his comments? Isn't there some old reddit memory website? That recreates things like that?
---
It’s more so how other people see you. They basically just see a dps that will roll need on all their gear. 
---
You’re never going to be in a situation where you can shine and get comments like “nice heals” or “great tanking, I’m adding you to my friends list”. 
---
But my point is; if he ever wants to reach max level with just 2 hours a day, those two classes are his best option.
---
I'm not necessarily FOR Layering, but I'm also not against it. I'm pretty apathetic to the whole thing. On one hand, I don't really want all the jankiness that goes along with layering. On the other hand, I'm 30 y/o, with a family, and a 9-5. I get, at the most, 2-3 hours of free time each night. I'd rather not spend 1/4 of that in a Queue or fighting over mob tags just to get out of the 1-12 zones.
---
I thought leveling as warrior was painfully slow? I would have assumed it would be like shaman or something
---
If I had a nickel for every time Blizzard's "good-faith solution" appealed to the lowest common denominator of player and made the game worse, I'd be able to buy their company.
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong, socially it was a good thing. But while retail did a lot wrong, the difficulties are insanely useful.
---
Hard disagree.
---
Imagine if there was a difficulty setting for Dark Souls. Imagine how that would change your opinion of someone who said, "I beat Dark Souls."
---
The status would be gone. 
---
That's retail WoW.
---
I'm for it. 
---
Getting it to work how it's intended to work is key. Not quite there yet.
---
Alternative would be to allow access by invitation only. Over a 3 month basis
---
Trailer park boys

Etc.\*
---
I had engineering the first time around.. and have kept engineering on my main since, all the way into BFA. When classic hits I’m looking forward to rolling herb/alch instead.
---
Thats funny, I traded my preraid bis rogue on a pserver for a tier 1 druid because of how cool I thought it was to have epics, had never played a druid in my life before that. 3 years later and I'm still playing druid and I'm also maining it for classic
---
Yes it is their fault. Players have the option to do harder content and progress. Instead of having people just wanting to see the content now you have people wanting to do harder content. If you choose to be an LFR only player than it’s 100% your fault.
---
Having a game that I can actually play and enjoy with my friends.
---
Layering doesn't affect channels. There were probably just not many people in the zone.
---
Wish there was some mini games or social games in the big cities you could play.
---
If I’m in world pvp w a Druid that provides some sustain, how much more effective will I be?
---
That’s not really how MDMA works. You kinda have to get to that threshold 100mg dose. It doesn’t allow for microdosing like other drugs.
---
I love it!
---
Drop manatide totem right now or gkick!
---
I think you should change your outlook. The world pvp phase will be unqiue and a limited time chance to experience event. You can always bg on an alt later.
---
&gt;Multiple realms. Well, that is basically layering, but WORSE. Players will always go the the most populated one, hence, you cannot control the player influx unless queues are added or being impossible to create characters. Unacceptable by any standards. Once the first 2-3 realms will be full, the other 2-3 will be low pop, with very different economies, prices, leveling, grouping, etc. The merging will solve only the population problem, but will come with players from the first 2-3 realm much better geared, better guilds and much richer than the players on the other 2-3 realms. Again, this is unacceptable by any standards.
---
​
---
So many wrong assumptions.  First of all, this is how every MMO has launched.  No MMO launch has been particularly amazing, as I recall, but players survived.  The awful, bullshit, straight up lie you are peddling is that players will always go to popular realms.  That is straight up untrue.  Some players will.  But most will not, especially if they are warned about significant queues.  If you join a full realm, after being warned about queues, EXPECT TO SIT IN A QUEUE AND STOP COMPLAINING.
---
Server clusters is pretty much the most universally accepted alternative to layering and you dismiss it with absolutely BS assumptions.
---
You are literally creating a boogieman that doesn't exist "omg if there's no layering you'll all be in 40k pop servers and never get to play" so you can support Blizzard's awful changes.
---
I’m just saying it’s faster. Do the normal quest circuits, if you have to go out of your way for a little rep it’s not worth it.
---
I take prescription concerta. 54mg XR. I couldnt tell you any negative side effects honestly. Maybe irritability of not being productive enough at times, or seeing things around me that aren't done from people being unproductive lol. 
---
I've only ever done addy, concerta, and LSD. Oh cocaine once, but that wasnt really for me. Too expensive and doesnt last long enough lol.
---
It is 10am pst. So that is 12noon cst, and I guess 1pm est?
---
Imo the evolution is not a fix. Vanilla was not broken. It’s just evolution of something wonderful. Sure....the evolution did not work perfectly but honestly....they are allowed to try and one can’t hold it against them. In the end they are giving us classic. In addition to the evolution product that is the current live game. 
---
I am saying that my expectations have increased as I have aged. It’s maybe a bit sad but I think it’s pretty common for humans.
---
That alternative is not something I am for. Like most of us here I'm super pumped for Classic. I would be devastated to wait 3 additional months.
---
There are not a lot of great AOE spots for lower levels. The server will be really crowded. Even if you get "ahead of the pack" people like me will harass you. An 60 AOE mage can be taken out by a level 1 with just pulling more mobs in.
---
Play Warlock/Mage, which is one of the more popular classes to have it on.
---
Be respected in your guild. Just don't be that kinda guy who turns up for raids and that's it. We've all been there. There's these people who's just there, fulfill their spots and that's it but you barely know them or play with them. Be friendly. Socialize. Help people.
---
Know your shit. If you're playing Warlock/Mage, perform above average. Bring consumables all the time.
---
The staff is usually more a sign of 'thank you' from the guild, than something which was put on the guy because he was the one doing the most DPS. It's definitely a mix between it being good on you and you earning it through people willing to give it to you. Something which is usually reserved for long-time members and overall likable people of the guild.

Imo not enough buttons and odd button placement to be max effective. I use 9 of the 12 buttons, plus ALT modifiers, and keyboard bindings as well.

Thanks for everyone participating in this.
---
My brother remembered that he bought a certain edition back in the Vanilla days that granted him an extra Pet and a Bag (he thinks 8 Slot) for free on every new character (BoE as far as he knows).
---
My research brought me to the following results:
---
Will he get his Pet back? - Yes, if he uses the exact Battle.net Account and did NOT fuse the games/content of his old Account to a new Bnet-Account.
---
Will he get his Bag back? - No results so far, but I would assume yes similiar to the Pet. I could not find any informations on this so far. Does anyone remember/have source for this?
---
I know it's probably not the easiest question to answer, but it's simple. :P
---
This is brilliant
---
Yeah those gaming chairs are ass. They marketed them well, because they are not comfortable or even good for your body. How much was your chair?
---
A good system would then have you win the item for 101.
---

---
Yes, I used to have the hex series 6 buttons for LoL. When I went back to MMO though I needed more buttons lol.
---
Lmao, any warrior worth his salt knows this is correct. Even more so in naxx with bosses like Loatheb and Thaddius. Also no one can compete in vanilla on overall against a warrior with BRE. I probably know more about vanilla warriors than anyone else on this subreddit. Feel free to ask if you want any tips.
---
That is completely untrue and I'm not sure why you believe it or where you heard it.
---
People will still switch layers when they join groups.
---
As long as it's limited to low level zones, then I think layering will only help the game.
---
I’m planning on playing a decent amount, but not enough to reach rank 14 or anything like that. Will I still be able to compete and feel powerful in world pvp and prepares even if I’m not devoting my life to gearing up?
---
All my friends are saying they wont play it, but something tells me they will once classic comes.
---
Classic has a strange and strong force.
---
Even guilds with good rep can have hidden corruption. And, that assumes you can deeply scope out a guilds rep before you join. Can't do that today pre-lauch. Corruption is only one problem as well. Other kinds of bias, incompetence, misinformation come into play as well.
---
Depends. Are we doing bosses with the slack asses? If so, we leave the moonkin and pally on the bench and continue to push content with the lazy bastards
---
Ok thank you!
---
It will be great...if you’re max level.  Anybody still leveling during phase 2 will be crying and begging for BGs to release faster.

What a badass
---
You shouldn't step into brd before around 55 and only if you have the quests, it's not worth ur time otherwise because it's such a big dungeon and if you're too low lvl mobs will take forever to die which will extend the run even more.
---
People love saying "you can join it at 52, no 50 !" I'm pretty sure whoever said that was either getting carried by higher lvls or was a healer, even then it's preferable to have higher lvl healers , the last thing you want is having the healer pull a pack of mobs that the group was able to pass due to their larger aggro range.
---
All the whining and flaming after 24h when people realize that they can't just rush it xD.
---
Yeah, I actually have the same exact opinion lol
---
leveling alchemy/herb is a bigger accomplishment than MC in the first week. I don't think they will have flasks for week 1.
---
I don't see a problem fighting for spawns, and that should not be a long term issue by any means, especially if they create enough servers.
---
Indeed, the industrial revolution has not yet come to Azeroth.
---
Just do your research on pre-raid-bis.
---
If you can handle getting pre-raid-bis most guilds will take tou regardless. 
---
In terms of social aspects, just be yourself. Most people remember being 16 and will sympathize with you.
---
The starting zones are usually very small, contain class quests and are honestly quite hard to mess up. Because the area is so small and a huge amount of people will be inside, it's too situational for me to tell you where you should be killing monsters for a specific quest. I'm still not sold on adding 1-5 content to the standard routes even tho a lot of users are pushing for it and have written the respective files.
---
Go to the settings page and try to change the keybinds to something else. If that doesn't work, send me a screenshot of what the buttons register as. As for the database: I've already coded the necessary components to pick your preferred database but wowheads API is a little wonky with the framework I'm using so more testing is necessary. The twinstar API isn't familiar to me atm but I'll look into adding it.
---
 "well what if the population doesn't decline, won't Blizz have to keep layering in?"
---
To my understanding population isn’t that big of a deal later on because many quests are spread out over different zones. So even if the population remains the same layering will still be removed because the population won’t be as concentrated.
---
very interesting system - when you say 'the loot master makes the final call on distribution', does this include the power to deny a drop that hugely benefits another class [thus having a bit of loot council]?
---
Not a bad solution, but the issue is then is that other people can push the price up if they know you're going to bid for an item.
---
Ebnflow on youtube has a great phase 1 PvP BiS HotW druid gearing video. I tested it out on a p server and it's really strong vs similarly geared players. If you have the skill you'll be able to take on slightly higher geared players.
---

---
He is honestly one of the best resources I have found for druid info.
---
I'll admit my view has been jaded by private servers disabling wbuffs and buffing raid bosses. But you gotta keep in mind that top guilds are usually the ones that *can* afford such things because they can sustain a raid roster of people that are actually good at the game. I still think people are in for a pleasant surprise if they think KT is faceroll. Frost Blast and tank MC's are incredibly punishing mechanics.
---
Shadow Priest PvP Profession option?
---
Planning to role a shadow priest for primarily PvP content in classic. I've leveled a couple spriests to 60 on northdale and Kronos and daveled around in some PvP, dungeons and World PvP. 
---
I'm conflicted on what my crafting profession should be? Alchemy or Engineering?
---
Engineering is great regardless, but is it necessary for Spriests considering the toolkit and insane CC and damage? 
---
Alchemy would be nice for mana pots and such, making money, etc. 
---
Engineering or nahh?
---
That pirate quest in Tanaras was always a war zone. If you want to start shit in your early 40s, that's the place to go.
---
Good players are ALWAYS prepared for raids.

If they aren't prepared, they aren't good players.

---
If he's the top DPS without farming consumables then he's still top DPS. Consumables are farmed to achieve that end, they are not the measurement itself.
---
they can just hop to their faction layer and avoid pvp while they level
---
As long as you are skilled you can get away with most things. This is true in real life and also in game imo.
---
It's the same combat text, it is right. You're just being picky, I dont even know why would this be something to discuss.
---
I absolutely believe that with a dedicated guild and a plan to secure materials and gear for critical roles, this can be done.  
---
It would however require the entire guild making sure quantities of items are collected and sent to a dedicated crafter for each profession required.  This will help with fire resist as you will need it if in blues as well as consumables.
---
Then there is the gear checks, it means each DPS is responsible for meeting their near pre-raid bis or so. With tanks and Healers set up and dedicated to priority in dungeons.  
---
The next and biggest challenge, is ensuring enough people have hit 60.  As people can enter the raid at lower levels, they hit a massive defensive check in chance to hit, basically invalidating third roles in there.
---
All in all, yes this can be done.  Getting the quantity of devoted enough players to do it though, that is the challenge.
---
Depends on where you spend most of your time. If you’re a lot in Estearn plaguelands doing stratholme runs Herbalism is good for casual gathering inbetween runs.
---
If you’re hunter engineering is essential, secondary profession optional.
---
Just ask yourself what environment you will be at, what resources are common there?
---
Engineering is pretty damn great for literally any class. However, druids are the only class where I feel like i don't HAVE to take engineering to be successful at PvP. When you compare that to, say a paladin, you are shooting yourself in the foot big time by not taking engineering. Druids have so many answers in their kits that I never felt like I was missing out without having engineering. With that said, engineering is still god level.
---
I've only got a wife right now so she's screwed
---
Where did Blizz day it’s happening for all of Phase 1?
---
Sounds like it needs a return so that doesn't slow down your gaming!
---
So... as a warlock I shouldn't cast corruption on everything I see?
---
&gt;The extreme majority do not think fighting 500+ people for one quest mob is fun
---
I don't like managing pet happiness, soul shards, ammo, manually forming a group, running long distances because I have no mount, etc.  But it's part of the game, and when you start making sweeping quality of life changes for perceived problems, you're going to have numerous issues.
---
If Blizzard makes enough servers overcrowding should not be a serious issue, and should not last.  Also, overcrowding is only bad in extremes.  A small amount of overcrowding is good, as it forces players off the beaten path.

Calling it quits because all your gear is red is the true WoW experience
---
Every server will be overpopulated on launch, and this is just one of the launch day problems. Private servers even had these major launch issues. So a solution to launch is needed to make the playing experience smoother. Hopefully they solve the potential resource abuse like, devilsaurs, black lotus, and the gurubashi arena. They also will need to remove layering within the first month or RIP the economy.
---
Everything, except hardcore progression raiding will be doable with your game time.
---
What makes warrior so bad? Well unlike paladin he has no healing he has no bubble he can be easily kited he has no range abilites and mages just shit on them. Best ally race for pvp? Really depends on your class man. For example warlock goes well with gnome. Rogue with dwarf. Night ass Hunter is a solid combo too. But anything is possible really
---
Warlock has the edge on mages. Mage has no pet and no self healing unlike the lock who can kill slowly and safely with dots plus felhunter eating the mage buffs/debuffa and silence him
---
The theorycraft consensus appears to be that 3% crit to 4 casters does not make up the DPS loss from bringing an non optimal caster. Its there, but the comment about the chicken dance being the better raid utility has merit(3% crit to 4 casters vs making 39 people laugh during pre-pulls).

Why would a Cloud Serpent be good for Mara? Many of the Mara mobs are immune to nature damage

I'd make sure to have a few druid tanks at 60 to carry 2 of the level 50+ warriors through brd/lbrs fo gear and XP. Then a run or two of UBRS at 60 is all you need.
---
Making gold pile bigger **is** the game. There's a whole sub for it
---
Might also indulge in some service buying like buying gear from top raiding guild
---
Wish I had it recorded. In naxx on the Frankenstein boss, entire raid is going down, I’m a resto sham, last man standing.
---
Manage to heal myself and cast a couple lightning bolts to finish the boss. Felt pretty epic, I took my time tbagging everyone while they praised me before I started rezzing.
---
Phase 2 will be the best phase imo. No bgs means it will be so much world pvp. I expect ~2-3 months of phase 2 but I hope it will be longer.
---
It won't be fun for anyone that lvl during phase 2 though. Areas like ungoro, winterspring, felwood, searing gorge, burning steppes, EPL, WPL will probably be full of people farming honor.
---
Just make a twink to do lvl 39 pvp in phase 3 if you want to be a op flag carrier.
---
Lol I was playing a pserver with my roommate yesterday and a friend came over and was all pumped we were playing WoW and started talking about his retail character and all the xandalari troll stuff that’s in the story now and how amazing it was and i dont know if I’m just a biased jerk but none of that sounded interesting to me. The lore post WC3 burning crusade is really good imo already and it just got fuzzed up after wow wotlk
---
I'm sorry but this is trash.
---
You should definitely never fish until level 60 and fishing 1-300 can be done within 3 zones.
---
Cooking guide: go to the AH and buy anything in your recipe book you can find. Boom done.

Ye well, make some noise about it and they'll do the extra work. Otherwise, if people seem content with automated solutions they'll do that.
---
Back on my old PvE server prior to BGs, there was always 20-30 people PvPing at TM/SS.  Will still happen
---
That just means faster weapons are less viable as you cannot spend as much time kiting between each swing. But you should not be using fast weapons regardless.
---
By going that route you remove the "edge" of being in a contested zone. STV is a damn battlefield most of the time, but it makes for the experience. I've seen large scale fights happen in the middle of the jungle because someone didn't like that someone else killed them. 
---
It's understandable to not want to play on a pvp server, but don't come in and say they should be removed entirely.
---
Yes apparently the enchanting skill requirement was not a thing until I believe TBC?
---
You just need a level 5 character to learn the profession and then can disenchant anything of any item level.
---
Play Druid if you wanna heal, be a hybrid support, or going 100% hardcore into feral tanking (they’re still pretty decent tanks but you gotta be super motivated to actually get raid spots.

Feral dps is worse than rogue by a long shot.

If you wanna be a sneakyboi and melt some mofos be a rogue.

I agree that you can take almost any class 1v1 in wpvp, if you have enough mana for it. I'd say Stormx-like hybrid specc with int/stam gear is far superior to feral. At some point, you won't be able to rely on burst alone and you won't look so smart w/ your agility gear when only shifting 2 times will deplete your mana bar.
---
Being a filthy casual, taking my time and having fun without any pressure to reach endgame.

You know you can just jump down from the top and skip all of the lizards on the way in?

Before you two get into it just understand that "good" is up to you to define, and you both have different definitions of the word. Hope this helps

what about the hate list?

---
Are you a genius?
---
any planetside 1 players in here?  this warrior set always made me think of the VS
---
Got Guantlets of Annihilation on right there. There is no 2h close to Dark Edge (outside of Naxx), so swapping and losing out of that proc chance would never be worth it.
---
I'd rather be at the back of the queue because I got an item rather than because I'm not in the guild clique who sit in discord 12 hours a day.
---
That depends on your route and the amount of players in the starting zone, typically you need somewhere between 30 mins to an hour to exit the starting zone. Power levels can do it in 30mins but for argument's sake lets just say it's 45 mins for everyone else.
---
One thing I was proud of was doing WC during the stress test with 15s only got to the first boss and our hunter left so we had to 4 Mann him
---
If you’re winning encounters, you don’t care. And if you start struggling, you point out the bottom performers first.
---
Get a Sword of Zeal and Mirah's Song instead.
---
the problem i have with the plate sets is that it looks futuristic to me.  they are quite cool but yeah they don't seem to fit in warcraft
---
Depends if the lazy people are funny/likeable/charming/fun
---
Step 1: Do not have children
---
Step 2: Play video games as much as you want
---
Doesnt work like that. Just adds autoattacks. I have no idea where this meme comes from.
---
No, I am more sad tier 0 will not be in at the start. It just makes the most since, adding it in during AQ-40 makes it obsolete by then for most classes. I think it would be fun to farm it and do the quests while it would be relevant to do it. I can see why the bgs will not come out till later, to give people that old school world pvp feel. That was a huge part of vanillas history.
---
&gt; It's particularly effective vs Warriors.
---
While hamstringed?
---
&gt;The proc rate in the pirated realms is also too high.
---
Actually you have no clue if this is true or not whatsoever. But never let an opportunity to tell everyone how shit pservers are slip by right? ;)
---
My heart is saying play undead but I am not sure if I can wait BG que for an hour.
---
I just wish there were more Alliance players in the realm I will play.
---
Does anyone know if there will be CRBGs in classic and any ideas on Alliance, Horde ratio and BG que time?
---
never played hunter despite my thousands of vanilla hours, i cannot WAIT to do this!
---
Idiot detected.
---
Playing the game as intended isn't cheating.   As you said, no one does this.   T
---
You're comparing a worst-case scenario which doesn't happen often to something which happens in a huge majority of all guilds using DKP. On top of that, most somewhat decent guilds know and understand with 40+ people, you can't reward the clique of people over other people, because people simply won't stay in that guild.
---
I dont like all this sneaky stuff and gaming the system. I want the loot to be representative of time and effort the individual put in, which is why I think a fixed prize is the best system.
---
Yeah but it's funnier to point and laugh
---
How many times are you planning on going with paper outside a layer as you level? That's a clear exception that shouldn't be that common.
---
I was planning to do the same but with Darkspear instead of Thunderbluff. I’m concerned that doing this from level 1 might mean I won’t even get honored for Undercity by level 40 which means the mount would cost 10g more.. anyone considered or calculated this?
---
Every item in the game is like this. Look up any item from Vanilla. They dont have much stats.
---
But if you want to keep passing up 10 different "insignificant" upgrades instead of having all the small increases add up and get further boosted by buffs, you are free to do so.
---
What ? You can easily do MC/BWL in under an hour, many guilds have done them under half of that. Even if you're not the best player and don't have many consumables, 2 hours should be more than enough time for raiding.
---
Is the Black ram from the standard ram vendor available in this version of wow?
---
Of course there will be some people ahead of the curve on every layer, doesn't have to be the same amount on every layer but there'll be someone obviously, making the zones contested.
---
Played BC as a main tank with a guild full of great  dps, best friend was a rogue that would tag a mob, avoidance tank, and drag it to a tank, and then vanish.  Accidentally pull a pack? The cc was great, traps and sheeps galore! Our holy pally cl was even great on pick ups and pulls.  Alot if skill, alot of know how, and even more strategy. Game felt great!
---
I'm interested in more details as well
---
Leveling two is fine if you're dualboxing in fact if argue it's more efficient and faster.
---
I'm going to be dual boxing a mage along with my main
---
This means:
---
- free food and water
---
- portals anywhere across the world (once learned)
---
- aoe/sheep support for overpulls
---
- gankers steer clear most of the time because they would rather not engage a 1v2 with a paladin who can bubble, and a mage of all things together, they won't know on observation that dual box is going on without excessive following and watching.
---
- easy gold farming for both mounts and epic mounts even.
---
- I can go herb, mine, skin, and enchanting all at once.
---
Yeah I'm pretty hyped.
---
I know, because people tested it in the past.   It wasn't that good.
---
For sure and guilds of that caliber, in my opinion, are necesarry for a healthy server, for many reasons. Economy, materials, pugs, they are important in allowing less hardcore guilds to progress directly or indirectly. So in a sense min/maxing is important to the community in many ways both directly and indirectly.
---
By no means do I think KT is faceroll at all, or some of the other bosses like Thaddius or 4-Horseman. I mean those two mechanics on KT were the cause of alot wipes in Wotlk with only 25 people in the room (I never got to KT in vanilla). There is a reason that less than 1% of the player base actual killed him (it wasnt just because a new expac was coming out). These end bosses of raids deserve alot of respect. It going to being fun having to deal with so called "simple" mechanics again.
---
So all the things people have been doing on retail for years 😑
---
“OMG I’m so excited for classic, can’t wait to do the same shit I’ve been doing all these years but this time it’ll be Vanilla”
---
Like I’m all good with being excited, but you could choose a better reason.
---
Shitpost
---
Farming consumables should be a given....it's required to be in a good raiding guild
---
The fish sell well or the cooking? :)
---
Eh, ran several 10-15 man scholo strat and ubrs.  They just didn’t call it raiding until BC, however, it is very unfortunate that classics patch cycle didn’t include adding new progression dungeons excluding dire maul.
---
That’s one thing that kinda sucks. We only have harder and harder raid content to look forward to and nothing more ‘casual’ 
---
One could argue that tier .5 was something similar having to revisit old dungeons for new events but I don’t count it.
---
Is this a joke?
---
I’m going to be somewhat high ranking in my guild, but warrior now just doesn’t seem worth it. Weak in pvp, weak in pve without crazy gear, tough leveling process, is this class at all enjoyable for someone like me who will devote 20ish hours a week to wow? I plan on reaching BWL but I’m not trying to speedrun, I want to actually enjoy the game and the questing and professions
---
It’s good, but not great. He still suggests using poisons in raids when they are wholly inferior to shadow oil.
---
I look foward to people logging on to actually just have fun , and not to just complete some goal.
---
Do you want to be good at pvp? pve? Wpvp? I typically look at what top players are doing for builds, look at what items are good for situations such as, cleave, single target burst or a straight control build. Like u/tower11 said, finding a good streamer that explains what they do/why is crucial to understanding how to play rogue.
---
kill it with fire
---
Locks are great in pve. They are needed most for their curse of elements, which buffs raid damage significantly.
---
Most raid builds aren’t DOT based, but SM/Ruin for those sweet 5k shadow bolts
---
That's the problem though.  You will be farming these places a lot.  If you're not an asshat, you'll probably run chain runs only to rend with the same group.  If youre someone who's going to take a 10dps upgrade over someone who would do 150 more, the group as a whole is worse off for subsequent runs.  You wont get invited to the next run or maybe even any run if your name gets known for that type of behavior.
---
Of course it would be to prevent 10second disarm.
---
I used to swap to my weapon chain hand of rag when another warrior switched to d stance.
---
Doing good DPS, or "topping the meters", is not mutually exclusive with focusing the right target and using your CC when necessary.
---
If anything, people who do good DPS tend to be better at those two things, too.
---
This is what dps is about. Kill them as fast as possible so they can't hurt your party. High dps is what allows this. You're not blowing up a target if you're flopping a pool noodle around the mobs.
---
This just looks so wrong... I wish I could run the original client to see if it was different.
---
&gt;only hunters roll need on ranged  
---
&gt;only melee roll need on melee weapons
---
If I see a group with these loot rules I know they are led by morons and I simply wont join.
---
I said before I wish I could've posted it also but it's on the back of this page, so couldn't get em both in one picture. I'll upload
---
Just use mods that tell you all your CC timers, dont really need to think then
---
Guild rules , also a good player will get the extra to top the stuff ! or its a lazy player
---
It's not the same game.   The dps will be doing more damage, the healers will be healing for more, and the tanks will be generating more threat.   The items are in their 1.12 state as well.  
---
When we did MC in vanilla, it was completely different.   Gear was itemized horribly.  The talents were a mess, and we didn't immediately go in with all the knowledge.    Not only what the bosses did, and the best ways to kill them, but the knowledge of the best way to play our class.     Gaining that knowledge was a huge part of Vanilla wow's difficulty.
---
Crippling Poison is a 70% slow. Hamstring is 50%.
---
So yes absolutely.
---
Then Blizzard should also bright back all the annoying bugs from launch like the looting bug. Also servers will be randomly taken down for days at a time to match the launch experience. Also random accounts will be 'stolen' to bring back the days of worse account security. Also the game will have to limit the number of copies sold to match the population at launch.
---
The problem is tier 0.5 is better than MC gear
---
In Classic will slower weapons hit harder like they did back in 2004-2005? Or is damage normalized for attack speed? This PvPer wants to know! Thanks :)
---
ill bite, what game?
---

Check out the shaman discord, theres a good guide on there.
---
Oh cool. Interesting.
---
As a Dwarf in vanilla I spent a ton of time working towards a gnome mount so I get it on some level. I will not be spending my time on that this time around.
---
Usually you can have a few dots running and most bosses have adds that definitely can be dotted. 
---
Beyond that they don't do too well in the first phases but once ZG and especially AQ is out they start to rise quickly. 
---
Locks are also just nice to have in the raid. They provide summons, healthstones, soulstones, banishes and SM/ruin locks significantly improve the survivability of your raid.
---
I basically had the same idea, except I was going to do elem.
---

Look for any code editor that you'd like. Common choice for non-programmers is notepad++, you can pretty much use it as a regular notepad except it automatically detects and helps you with the syntax and stuff. Other ones are Sublime, VSCode, Atom, Brackets, Emacs, etc etc. But they're made for programmers so could be too much for a beginner.
---
And ZG is an easy enough raid. Especially by the time your ready to raid MC/BWL/ZG will likely be on farm for the most part. 
---
There is plenty to do for the casual! Just do what you can to be a Courteous player, be on time for the raids, have your consumables and learn the fights; that’s worth a lot, often more than being top DPS.
---
read the comments to find out...
---
I can't believe people are still this bad at understanding the game in 2019. You're exactly right, and yet every comment above yours is about how doing more damage means you're bad and you cheated by cleaving or whatever else they tell themselves.
---
Wtf lol
---
Leveling a warrior with a healer friend is very nice. Can always solo level a hunter alt later on, they are one of the fastest to level solo.
---
BotW?
---
Interesting. The keyboard event triggers as it should and even registers the correct keycode after you hit a button but som....
---
Nevermind, your keybinds are disabled (first options in settings)!
---
I find it funny how much everyone is trivializing the game.  I'm not saying it's the hardest thing ever, but for a player that's only playing 1-2 hours a week to clear BWL?  That only happens if they get carried.  And sure at that point you can just say you can clear BWL with 39 people so literally anyone can "clear" BWL.
---
Botw and nier automata
---
Dkp also means newcomers wont get anything. I joined a guild and it was around 3 months till i had enough dkp to compete for drops. I like the decay but i like weekly resets when you raid 2 to 3 times a week plus more.
---
Humor is something that no longer is allowed on the internet then or?  It's just you that has no sense of it?
---
Yeah, I’m a bit torn at the moment, I don’t know exactly when I’ll be moving back to Europe but I’m more inclined to think long term. It could be the first few months of 2020 but it might get drawn out. Is the lag quite bad across regions? My broadband is super fast here. Would I need to set everything up with an EU battlenet account and use a VPN? Cheers
---
Best racial for warlock? Horde and Alliance. I like orc for horde and human for alliance.
---
No
---
All these people drinking the "viable" koolaid are going to be in for a fun surprise at 60.  Sure everything is "viable" as you can clear MC with 39 people it's viable to be afk too.  Some of the classes were just poorly designed/balanced.  Unless you really know what you are doing you are going to struggle to keep up and contribute.  If your raid what's to carry you that's fine, but when they are wiping and looking to sub out the bottom dps, good luck.
---
Didn't know I was going to make so many people angry about professions. My main point is that professions are not the same as they used to be and are highly devalued in comparison to classic.
---
Very interesting - how would you deal with people not attending old raids?  For example, someone with #1 loot priority has everything they want from MC/BWL and only shows up to AQ40 raids
---
It’s totally possible with enough support. Only 40 will be in the raid, but there will be many more people farming mats for consumes and resistance gear, setting up lvl20 warlocks in key locations etc. With enough poopsocking anything is possible.
---
People crying about corrupt loot council are often wrong, too. Some dude just joined the guild, a bis drops, he wants it, an officer also wants it, guess who it's going to? It's going to the guy who was there longer, is a lot more invested in the guild and has proven to be reliable. Obviously.
---
Officers getting loot first is basically how loot council is supposed to work, its not corruption, it benefits the guild most. Officers and long time, established raiders, ofc. 
---
If your "uncorrupt" LC gives items to freshies before giving them to officers, your guild is going to shit because half those freshies will disappear within a couple weeks and you might as well have vendored the items you gave em for all the good it did to the guild.
---
Joining a LC guild is knowing that there is a pecking order and that order prioritises the guild over any individual player or any notion of fairness. These guilds are the ones that progress the most, and people who join it and understand that will eventually get their items, too, just not first. They can also move up the pecking order through effort and investing their time and effort in the guild.
---
How can you not get through your thick skull that vanilla is all about preparation? The rotation is not hard, SO YES, people who come with consumes etc are GOOD players
---
Yes, it’s 30 points into affliction and 21 into destruction
---
Tanks and healers both are always in high demand.  But as far as five mans go pretty much any tank class can tank even if not specced for it.  In a pinch even a good shaman can tank 5 mans.
---
I leveled a Druid and frequently tanked it healed.  I was feral spec, but I carried int gear and was able to heal 5-mans fine.
---
If you’re wanting to raid tank your only option is warrior.  Nothing else is capable of crush immunity.
---
😡no
---
We’re not getting Vanilla raidframes, Classic will use the Retail ones.
---
No problem, happens to the best of us.
---
I have leveled my cooking quite easily as I have leveled to get the easy quests.  Honestly, I am not sure I agree with your assessment that leveling is easiest with fishing.  I typically make 200ish by level 30. I have an alt bank I will send all food items to and take a break from grinding to cook a bunch while I get a drink, go to the bathroom, etc.  I typically sell the food items for silver (druid, so I rarely have a need to eat them for HP), keeping a stack for when I have a hard quest/mob that needs a stam buff.  
---
A slightly deeper dive: cooking is made of three things: travel time, cooking time, and acquiring time for the food.  Travel time for fishing can vary if you are looking for schools of fish, while traveling for food from the world is typically part of leveling.  Likewise, you gather food as the the leveling process, while fishing will be a 15 second experience outside the leveling process.  Cooking time is essentially the same for the two, and ideally you are not at the screen for either.  With 2 of the three being integrated into leveling, it seems it is better to just plan ahead and save your ingredients
---
&gt;Humor
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means
---
im glad myself
---
You deleted your initial comment. So I'll just post it on this anyways.
---
I agree, however I would say 'viable' is relative. Most average and harcore guilds don't consider moonkin druids viable, because they bring literally nothing to the raid, other than the crit buff, which doesn't warrant for the lower DPS. However, I can understand why some guilds do consider them viable, because all they want to do, is to clear the content, which can be done with moonkin druids. 
---
I like TBC class balancing as well. My favourite expansion. All classes/specs were 'viable' in the sense that even average/hardcore guilds could use about any spec, because they perform somewhat within what most guilds could consider acceptable.
---
Feral druids innervate themselves for higher dps too
---
That shouldn't worry you as you can't even buy the riding without being exalted.
---
Absolutely not
---
I really don’t expect many retail players, that never played classic, to make it past level 20.
---
OP is going to vote for whichever 2020 candidate most resembles their favorite Harry Potter character
---
Everyone's certainly entitled to their own opinion ;)
---
Mildly amusing
---
What is the point in being level 5 over level 1 if you don't mind me asking?
---
It's such a bummer that Kaplan went on to Overwatch. I know he's probably burned out of MMO's but man his talents are wasted on that game.
---
Yep, I like Snape... so I'm voting for Elizabeth Warren!
---
The short answer? Locks are quite good in pve, and gods in PvP.
---
The in-depth answer?
---
The debuff cap is pretty high, 16, so they're going to be much better at launch then they were for a big chunk of vanilla. There are three guaranteed spots for warlocks in raids because of their curses. The debuff cap isn't too much of an issue though because the warlock raiding spec doesn't really so much on dots - you are primarily spamming shadowbolt because it's pretty much your most efficient spell. You won't be dotting up raid bosses so much so it's not too much to worry about. If they raise the debuff cap even more later than locks will do even better. But as of now they're still very good in raids, and excellent in dungeons. Warlocks are a pretty rare class, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding raid slots unless you suck or you're a jerk.
---
In PvP locks are absolutely amazing. You can take on multiple enemies at once and dominate them. It's tougher as alliance because you're gonna be facing undead but you can still stomp people. You can disrupt entire groups of people and your DoTs give you very easy ways to deal lots of damage, and your direct damage skills are nothing to sneeze at. Your fear is extremely useful foe disrupting people, even if they can break it. Most people tend to ignore your pets and they are a nice source of damage. Locks are awesome in PvP when played well.
---
Raiding can get a bit boring because of the constant shadowbolting, but as long as you don't suck you're definitely a benefit to the raid. You've got some excellent utility and good damage. In dungeons you're pretty fricken awesome because you can dot em all up. Just don't fear things constantly otherwise you'll wipe the group and develop a bad rep. The leveling process is awesome, you're the second best solo class in the game and can solo elites easily. Like I said you're a PvP god.
---
So yeah, warlocks are pretty great. I'm planning for my second character to be one.
---
This cannot be right, fishing means you aren't getting any experience. Surely the most time efficient way would be to quest to the top of the bracket, cook and skill up what you have and fish the rest up.
---
And yet they still want to rush in and pull shit.  It always aggravated me for them to do that.  Like, dude, if you want to tank go for it. If not then stop pulling shit.
---
the worst kind of person lol
---
Levels warlock to summon people to random dungeons only to relevel their main later?  They aren't saving any time over walking their first characters to the dungeons.
---
I appreciate the response, but I did that the first time around and don’t want to do it again. I have less time to play now, so I’d rather PvP on my own terms and be more in control of my time
---
It's supposed to be a few weeks, not months.
---
Enhancement is the leveling spec. You can heal just fine and there isn't much ele gear even in the game outside of cloth, it'll be much easier to gear up as enhancement.
---
Aq20 wasn’t a 20 man version of aq40. It was its own dungeon.
---
Rational, logical thinking? This isn't allowed here.
---
Maybe on the horde.  If you have a feral in your raid you can allocate a debuff slot to judgment of wisdom so the feral can innervate priests.  JoW is also good for hunters and arcanite dragonlings too.
---
Blizzard said people are gonna get all their stuff from the special editions if they bought them back in the day. On the stress test I saw people with the mini Diablo pet.
---
that was 100% me as a 12 year old playing a balance druid

---
I assume because people tend to hoard DKP for weapons/trinkets.  Also, certain classes come up with agreements for class drops so they can hoard more DKP for weapons/trinkets/armor shared with other classes.  (for example, the warlocks agree that Warlock A will spend 1 DKP on a Felheart piece and no one else will bid against them).

Thank you so much! This is the first time I'm actually hyped about lvl'ing cooking lol xD

Any chance you can do more of these? Herbalism/alchemy would be awesome aswell :)

(Yes, I know there are other guides out there - this one is just really simple and cool made)

There is this other game on the market ... what's it called. BFB, BFC, no .. BFA, yes. You are able to raid in smaller groups, making your experience surely better.

Classic isn't that game.

Perfect, that’s what I was hoping to hear. Thanks for the response. I guess the trick is just making sure I get on a high pop realm!

These are decisions you should have made before you started raiding/leading, and you should have communicated such to the group. If you're asking the question, "what do we do about people who show up to BWL without consumes?" you've already failed at leading. Establish guidelines, make them clear, and follow them.
---
I would take a bm hunter who had no consumables but was an excellent strafe kiter over one who was perfectly min/maxed had stacks of elixer of mongoose but didn't have the kiting skill to do his or her leaf quest.
---
When I played most locks would be SM ruin with some variations some would get improved HS some would not I can’t remember the specifics but I know for top DPS when you are hit capped it is not SM/Ruin it is Demoic Sac/Ruin 100%. DS ruin is not good at all for pvp though so SM/Ruin is more versatile and don’t forget how much it costs to respecc

Is hunter leveling going to be too easy ? Because of the pet tanking and feign dead am I ever going to die in solo ?

Never played in vanilla, but did mess around in BC. Played more in Wrath.
---
Arriving at a new zone, filled with orange &amp; red quests - grouping up with randoms to tackle those hard [Group] quests! Adding said randoms to friend list, running dungeons with them, continue questing in the upcoming zone and finally running raids together in a guild.
---
You have pretty minimal cc and depending on your form, are also pretty squishy. You're going feral spec for leveling? If so, you can usually out run them in cat form.
---
It is easier just to join a raiding guild by the time it comes out and do MC, ZG and AQ 20 than it is to wait and travel to all the places to collect tier 0 and then complete the extremely long quest chains and gold sink to make it epic.
---
He's talking about UC rep as undead :-)
---
Guild name, server name and q-net channel
---
Yupp, it's a vanilla video!
---
Why can't the layering fans just wait? If the goal is to make as true vanilla experience as possible this is the better option to take.
---
it's not something you can explain in a few words. For me it's something I enjoy doing and I have accumulated a  lot of experience back in original vanilla times and more recently on private servers. You have to know what kind of goods are in demand at various stages of the game, this changes a lot throughout the life cycle of a server (months / patches) so you can't just blindly follow a list.  There is also a weekly cycle to profit from, as raiders often buy more the afternoon before their fixed raid times.  So the same potion would sell for more on a Sunday at 3.00pm  compared to Monday 10:00 am.
---
Avoid gear and weapons in general, the AH fees on those are huge and unless you sell them very cheap, the risk of unsold items eating up all your margin is too big.   
---
Some of the best items to sell are enchantment materials and reputation items, since they have good prices and very low or no auction fees.
---
You can start by just using a AH addon and start scanning the AH twice a day for a few weeks. (for example when you wake up and when you go to bed.)    This will give you a good basic grasp of the prices of stuff, but then you will need to learn from experience how to use that data.  Over time you learn which items are good to buy for profit  and which are to be avoided.
---
You will not outdps people with consumes as someone with no consumes
---
That's amazing!

You need to have purchased the EU version of the game, bnet is universal ( you can switch through regions) but you can only play the game on the region you purchased it, in this case you need a BFA sub to play classic so you must have the EU version of that game.
---
The ping can be somewhere between 100-300 ms for oceanic playing on EU realms, at least according to an aussie friend of mine who used to play on EU, no idea what your exact ping will be though but I can safely say it wont be below 100 ms.
---
Thought about it aswell, but then again, it's only 10g. I'm willing to give that up if it means more rep TB/Darkspear in the end. Probably makes up for the 10g, haven't done the calculations though.

 Stormwind gate just got 10 feet higher.

I made it to "/cast Bagpipes!"

I think you are overestimating the cost of servers, unless you are implying Blizz is trying to minmax their financial gain at the cost of player unhappiness. I agree though, layering sucks. It especially sucks because it will ruin the feeling of leveling completely. You won't get that feeling that other people are advancing with you and you won't recognize others as you go etc. That is what really makes leveling fun in Vanilla. You might be doing DM at lvl 18, then at 30 you might meet the same guy trying to join a group for Gnomeregan etc. Now, people will be popping in and out all the time which sucks. It will make it harder to get to know people too.
---
I would have preferred a different approach (by someone on here) where you could choose which layer you wanted to join like an actual realm, and you would be stuck on that until they merged them. That way, at least people won't be popping in and out when leveling and you'd get to know the people you level with and recognize them as you go.
---
Cross realm bgs are horrific for classic and the honor system/ranking. People who have never ranked on a private server have no idea what they're talking about.
---
I mean it was in WoTLK. In classic innervate was a resto talent though wasn’t it?
---
So wait a few months then play. I fail to see how your own personal schedule should determine the game design.
---
*Dreadsteed of Xoroth
---
Stop remembering me.. another day ruined. Thanks.
---
I'm quite familiar with how to level a warrior. There's a lot of things that are challenging for them. The kite grind xp does not make up for it. There's a reason the most powerful class in the game has the hardest time leveling.
---
Maybe not so simple of a question.. but I'm going to be playing priest and leveling 1-40 as Spirit tap/wand spec like most. Then at 40 switch to pure shadow for shadowform. My question is, there are 3 talent points that are floaters after you get VE and silence, and I'm not sure which to put them in. 
---
Option 1: 5/5 shadow focus, 3/5 blackout, 0/3 shadow reach - I feel like blackout stuns outweighs the potential 20% range, as I can't think of too many reasons the extra range would be a difference maker while leveling
---
Option 2: 3/5 shadow focus, 5/5 blackout, 0/3 shadow reach - Not sure how much 6% hit vs 10% hit makes a difference. Plus I'll be leveling on a pvp server so the max blackout might be very helpful if I'm getting ganked.
---
Option 3: 5/5 shadow focus, 0/5 blackout, 3/3 shadow reach - The pve spec. More range and max hit but not potential stuns.
---
Probably not a huge deal in the end, just wondering what other people's opinions are on the matter.
---
This is something that will differ from one guild to the next. We've decided that anyone can take any piece of gear that they can wear, if they have loot priority. If it's clear that someone is taking a piece of gear merely to spite someone else or to grief the guild, the loot master has the power to deny them that opportunity (but this would only be used in an extreme situation).
---
&gt;You won’t ever be as special. Just kind of there to fill a dps spot.
---
I don't see what's special about being a fury / rogue / mage when your raid mostly have a shit ton of them already. And why the hell would you need to be "special"? Just play what you like. If it happens to be top dps, good. If it is not, then good also.
---
I have never played wow before about 3 weeks ago. Due to wow classic releases I am interested in playing the game people loved back then and getting the experience. I tried some modern wow and found it quickly boring. So I tried a bit of private server play to prepare a bit for actual classic and that game is amazing! I have zero nostalgia and have never been a fan of mmos in general, and the private servers are a bit dead, but the game play is just a lot of fun.
---
That's what retail has trained you to do.
---
For some pieces yes, some not. The set itself is not exactly great for most classes no matter what phase you are in, but they are easy to get because dungeons have no cooldown so you can just grind it out in a week rather than wait for RNGesus to give you good loot and rolls once a week.
---
So champions/hero’s aren’t really that different than classes conceptually. My gf and I play league and I just told her “you know how each champ has different strengths and weaknesses and abilities? Classes in WoW are like that too. They just have way more skills.”
---
Something that hasn't been touched on here:
---
Theoretically...every guild that even bothers raiding will clear naxx *eventually*.  If you're in a tippy top guild, you might end up with several versions of atiesh among your ranks as well.  If you raid naxx for a year it seems reasonable that you'll have 4+ staves kicking around.  Hell, if you find yourself in a guild that has killed KT you could just take it upon yourself to lead an alt raid of naxx where you pick up some splinters.  There's a lot of options there, really, but the downside is that if you're playing a mage and the first atiesh goes to a different mage...you're unlikely to see another mage with it until lock/druid/priest all get one as well.
---
It was rare in vanilla because of how near TBC was to the world first naxx clear.  Even if classic gets expanded beyond naxx it seems unlikely that characters would be wiped, so you're likely to have a long-term option for obtaining it as long as you're raiding at all.
---
Of course, playing the slow game will take away a bit of the prestige of owning it, on top of the fact that you never really know how long you'll still be playing classic.  If you want to really push for it...the rest of this thread is pretty spot on.  Start a guild, be an officer, be a class lead, be the player people can depend on, etc.
---
Looks great. Also works on a tablet. Nice.
---
If they changed any of the raid sizes then it wouldn’t be classic.
---
Hey there! I soulstoned myself in that one raid I was invited to.
---
Razuvious did so much damage that a direct hit was always a one shot. As a rogue, we would be fighting for second place on the threat meter so that it would go down like this:
---
1. Mind controlled tank dies
---
2. First rogue on threat list gets one shot.
---
3. While the boss swing timer is going, second rogue hits evasion and tanks for dear life. 
---
4. Third rogue hits evasion 1 second before second rogues evasion runs out, second rogue vanishes, third rogue tanks.
---
We beat him a few times like this.
---
I agree, and even though it's only for a couple of months at most, it's during arguably the most important and fun part of Vanilla – the journey to max level.
---
Yeah I knew about the speed normalization but the way the worded the question was very vague
---
Yeah just gnome and human for alliance.
---
How long until phase 2 starts?
---
There are macros that will allow you to move the unit frames around, if that’s what you are looking for. Or you could use the MoveAnything addon to do kind of the same thing.
---
Sign me up! Lol naa
---
Right. The only reason they were lax on pservers was because the people playing them wouldn't touch retail, so it wasn't hurting their bottom line. Blizzard's vanilla reference is a server from 2005, it's hands down superior to some people guessing how shit worked.
---
Amen brother. I have such limited time to play this time around waiting in queue just won't work for me.
---
Also a large portion of the casual player base won't know or care about what layering is but will not tolerate long queues, Blizzard has the challenge of appeasing both side of the his issue.
---
level 10 iirc
---
Traque
---
Executus is good overall as well
---
I thought it was kinda funny. Cmon guys.
---
Excellent. Thank you for that, I'd have gone mad not reading more. I need to buy this book now.
---
If consumable requirements had clearly been communicated before, as well as the spec guidelines, and you had 39 prepared and properly specced players show up along with no-water Wendell and Pam the Prot Pally, would you leave the final spot empty?
---
Exactly. The healer only has so much mana. DPS still needs to be high to keep the group alive.
---
If they tell us how long layering will be in and not based of phases it would be better. I think it needs to be a set amount of time before its gone, not gauged off numbers. Minimizes the abuse on higher population servers.
---
No, but now pservers are affecting blizzard's subscribers so they'll have an axe over their heads.
---
Yeah, that's mostly because it's a unique situation for both classes - warriors have a fear break, do lots of physical damage, and can close the gap with you twice. It's really one of the only situations where a warrior gets to shine 1v1. I played a warrior throughout vanilla and I just avoided dueling altogether because my class wasn't built for it, but I adored battlegrounds and world PvP.
---
No, it's supposed to be 'not longer than phase 1' which will be months and the majority of the playtime of people getting to 60
---
If it’s right then why does OP post clips from every expansion but classic?
---
If the beta doesn’t match classic I’m all for restoring the combat text. It’s just silly and pedantic to constantly post gifs and clips from *other* expansions as proof. People’s memories are not always the best, if it truly isn’t like classic then I’m sure there are a substantial amount of clips of the actual combat text from vanilla.
---
It’s not like I’m against them restoring the text, but it’s asinine to point to an issue and expect people to be sympathetic when you don’t provide actual proof.
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
Yeah, go farm more consumables noob!
---
...fucking hate that mindset. I hated farming so much so I never did it, never used pots and flasks, still was top DPS.
---
Thanks
---
No it wasn't.
---
I think most people have experience queues.  I would take three days of queues as things settle down over layering in a heartbeat
---
A lesson that would be useful for you to learn.
---
&gt; Also, roll on a PvE server haha
---
I feel like I should, because of less amount of time I have to play the game. But I always rolld on a PvP server, I don't want to change that. ahah
---
You are welcome!
---
To the tee, I was often the first second or third on this scenario. Our top 3 were all pretty close.
---
That episode was a great listen. Highly recommend
---
How do you intend to address the disparity in how often different classes upgrade their weapons? 
---
Specifically, Hunters have a very small list of usable epic ranged weapons, meaning that they'll almost always be on top of the weapons list when melee weapons drop like Warblade of the Hakkari, Fang of the Faceless, Core Hound Tooth. 
---
With your system Hunters can safely save priority for any of the above 3 weapons while also guaranteeing Rhok'delar, since it is a class specific quest item with 50% drop rate.
---
Similarly, classes that use 2-h main weapons will naturally stay at the top of the list since they upgrade less often than dual wielders. That would, for example, give an advanrtage to an Arms Warrior over the main tank when looting a stat-stick ranged weapon.
---
I haven't stepped foot in a battleground in ~10 years.
---
&gt;Only due to plebs begging was curve and edge not cut with that release. Even though it usually ought to have happened (see their twitter posts regarding crucible) The additional 15xx guilds are all just there thanks to the additional months of progress time for them
---
Yeah, and? A raid being current content for 6 months is not unheard of.
---
Cute
---
Yea but you can’t kill Vael in greens bud.  I won’t be replying anymore on this thread since you are just an obvious troll. Enjoy playing your ret paladin/enhancement shaman/moonkin outside of the raid farming materials for other guys that get to have fun.
---
y'all really playing to lose i see
---
My bad, I've never seen it on classic talent trees, didn't realize it used to be a talent before 1.11
---
Ya I'm happy I stayed away from druid early on. It must have been just painful to play.
---
I remember our druids in raids asking me, on a pally, how to heal. I had no idea what to tell them. They barely ever had any healing done.
---
I'm sitting on the toilet and not super interested in doing the research for you but it should be fairly easy to find if you look for it yourself.  I believe it was a comment from Ion, involved the words 'hard stop' or 'full stop' and it was more recent than the video you linked.
---
Retail =/= Classic
---
I highly doubt they would not enforce gold buying banning as it would fuck with the small server economy.

I never understood why people think Humans (and Alliance by extension) are the "Good guys" in World of Warcraft.
---
Both sides have their goods and bass but Alliance are far more bigoted than the Horde in general.
---
Great, just letting him know it will be hard for him to get raid groups.
---
I have only played a couple MMOs, and not for very long. I want to start with wow classic. Anything I should know? Any good resources to take a look at so I can have a plan?
---
Prefer open auction. I've never used "fixed price" system tbh, what do you do if more than 1 person wants it? If the price is fixed and they both offer say 50, who wins?
---
Sure DKP leads to not taking worse gear but like...if literally nobody bids just have people roll. People are acting like they'll vendor gear if nobody bids.
---
Enjoyed the read mate, thanks for sharing your exp!
---
&gt;outside of the raid farming materials for other guys that get to have fun.
---
You know if someone plays a non meta spec it's **because** they find it fun, right?
---
The delusion is real.
---
it makes me wonder if jeff saying "raiders don't care about art" had anything to do with that. 
---
Yeah, they focused on just pumping this dungeon out, creating a good area (not good looking) and bosses from scratch. As opposed to "Okay, we want these bosses by name, and each has a thematic, so lets build these bosses around that thematic."
---
Total conjecture, but it is an interesting thought.
---
Paladin definitely if your goal is supporting and changing the tide of the battle. Divine shield is the ability. 
---
There's big visual clues with Paladin abilities. People will know you saved their lives and thank you for it.
---
Before WOW classic no one was watching WOW streams anymore. I don't think you realize how close retail is to death.
---
Why make this is you have clearly no idea what you're talking about? This almost reeks of misinformation, hopefully you're just trolling on purpose and not actually retarded
---
I actually hard agree with you on grizzly hills. Such a great zone. But you had to know you were going to get downvoted posting it on this subreddit right?
---
Been there done that. Sign me up and stop assuming people don't know what they are talking about. 
---
yOu tHiNk yOu dO bUt YoU dOnT
---
Just like classic raids are going to be a joke. People didn't know how to play the game back then and the average computer couldn't run raids at double digit framerates.
---
Fucking Larry always afk missing his tranq shots. Well at least the 32 warriors with WF were able to kill the boss before the boss could even enrage, again.
---
Honestly I think it's more like mythic is the real raid, they make it, and then they just remove shit and reduce numbers for the other difficulties.
---
I think the trick is to level the main to 60 first, or at least high enough that they can farm gold reasonably, then start doing alts in tandem like you said, that way they are never off rested xp, and you can feed them gold from your main. I plan on doing that with 3 alts.
---
Sub gives access up to legion. 
---
But essentially - blizzard won't really be able to stop "friends" from giving someone 200g in classic for nothing because there is nothing wrong with giving a friend gold.
---
Then they trade the current wow token price in gold on retail. 
---
So yes the wow token doesn't exist in classic but there will be gold trading between games 100%
---
I wonder if the big guilds are still gonna push new content as hard or they are gonna drop retail and push for world firsts in classic
---
I'm going to level a shaman tank build to tank for my friends. 
---
After some of them quit and I'm going solo, I will try to convince people shaman tanking is a thing in all 5-mans.
---
This would work, but private servers are full of warriors because at max level they are so useful even if they don't tank, so I will probably trow in the towel before max level.
---
So when game comes out, there is gonna be lot's of lot's of warriors. Asmon play warrior and I think that will also add warriors.
---
Later there will be less, but the fact is that the game is not so hard that you have to have a warrior for a tank. End game will be full of em though until much later.
---
y u do dis
---
The Orcs came in uninvited as immigrants to your "world" burned down your cities, created a world war.. Then settled their own city.This is something a liberal/communist would vote for xD
---
&gt;Iv narrowed it down to Druid and Paladin and would love your opinion on what I should play. 
---
Wildcard. Don't play those stupid classes and roll as an ele shaman instead.
---
Payo might be the best geared rogue on beta, and most popular but to say he is better than perplexity is a complete misunderstanding the class. Payo will probably tell you himself that perplexity is better, it's not even close.
---
On the topic of perplexity vs venruki, venruki or any mage really, should beat any rogue 100% of the time on beta. I also witnessed perplexity destroy venruki and ziqo in multiple duels yesterday, so like just because you see someone win or lose a duel doesn't mean the person that won is better lol. It doesn't really work like that, especially in rogue duels at level 30-40.
---
This is me in 2 months
---
That and how in the 1.12 patch at the end of vanilla (I think), they boosted druids bear/direbear/moonkin forms armor. So before, I think regular bear form was something like +90% armor and direbear was 180% (around 35-40% damage reduction). Then they boosted it to 180% and 360% bonus armor (around 50-55+ damage reduction). I can't imagine how anyone could have tanked before that patch. Which is why they didn't and druid tanking got dumped on. And by this point they were getting into tier 2.5 or tier 3 stuff, so probably nobody really had aimed for getting much tanking gear and it was pretty much too late for most. Then a while later, BC came to be.
---
I want to have a palladin and a warrior and also a human and a dwarf, how would you do the distribution and why? thanks!
---
The 1.13 client let's you move you unitframes without the need for some macro or addon.
---
Respeccing isn't cheap.
---
Holy in bgs are great fun if you have competent teammates!
---
Go paladin 100%, druid only has a battle rez.
---
Yes, Hunters are a tricky case, especially in MC/Ony where there are several strong melee weapons but few strong ranged weapons. We include the Petrified Leaf for Rhok'delar on the Weapons list, meaning that Hunters will need to think twice before they "suicide" for a Core Hound Tooth. Regarding stat-stick ranged weapons, reread my Accessories and Weapons categories. Fast ranged weapons (2.8s or faster) are considered Accessories. Slow ranged weapons (slower than 2.8s) are considered Weapons. This essentially divides all of the "stat-stick" ranged weapons from the proper Hunter weapons. 
---
Thanks for your input! You spotted a serious issue that I've been trying to resolve.
---
Wasn't faerie fire always overwritten by sunder armor in raids? Or did it stack?
---
My plan is to try and find someone to tank trade with, so that even though we may have our dungeon gear, we can tank for each others' alts to help them get groups to get gear, essentially giving all our alts the same demand as a tank even if they aren't.
---
Right click report isn't in classic from what I saw on the beta.
---
Yep, 
---
Shadow Mastery/ Ruin was one of the more common specs for endgame raiding. You get Shadow Mastery in the Affliction tree, and Ruin in the Destruction tree. Something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z). 
---
Or you go the [demonology version](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZfxhuMxoxZxx0tr0z) and of course you still get Ruin. 
---
Or you dip into affliction [for imp life tap](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Ix0bZfx0zThoZvx0tM0z), keeping demonic sacrifice and of course still getting Ruin. 
---
You need to be shadow because you're MC/BWL raiding and everything is fire immune. Conflag is for pvp
---
I would rather have BWL 80man
---
If you know the fights, and you understand when and how to switch aggro. You wont need an addon to scream at you to do things.
---
There is no addon that impacts a boss. Because addons can not influence the boss mechanics, Just the player, by providing information.
---
I’m conservative irl but am pretty committed to my lifelong horde pals (who yes, are clearly the liberals) I’m definitely going to go around calling everyone racist in game and complain whenever anyone wants gold instead of giving me something for free.
---
In Warcraft yes. In World of Warcraft its a different group of Orcs entirely.
---
He's not even using daggers.
---
The balance is the exact same as 2006. You're comparing your experiences with the nost core which does not matter.
---
We just blind bids, with the winner paying up a set amount of dkp above the 2nd highest bid.
---
Like I'd I bid 100 dkp and someone else bid 50. Id get it for 60 dkp.
---
Everyone in the guild was happy with this. Officers also ofc made sure a dagger rogue got the bis dagger even if a warrior or hunter bid for it. So a bit of LC was included, but only fair.
---
Has blizzard said anything about this? You could always trade gold for gold, argue that it's the same game with the same sub. 
---
I could see them frowning on it, but I can't see them perma banning people like they used a third party site or something.
---
warlocks are everybody's buddies for summoning them, and hunters play a pivotal role - kiting specific trash pulls and on some boss fights (razorgore, twin emps come to mind). 
---
Also hunters have tranq rotation for chromaggus and huhuran, which is not trivial at all
---
Reminds me of how shamans were said to be meant to be offtanks. With mail and a shield, they could get about 35-40% armor as well. Then with rockbiter weapon, they had supposedly a lot of added threat on auto attacks, and earthshock had a lot of threat. Then they have some totems to help and are seemingly meant for tanking. And heals I guess. But did any? Probably very few.
---
I'll echo what some others have said:
---
* sincerely appreciate now having to register
---
* super clean UI, minimal in a good way
---
Thanks for your reply! My question was vague due to my ignorance. I quit by patch 1.8, so I did not fully understand how normalization was originally implemented.
---
&gt; But it's probably gonna be a rush fest, since they are used to rush content for few years now...
---
If anything the pserver crowd is going to be rushing much more than the retail crowd lol
---
Why is it the worst? I would say undead is probably the worst starting zone imo.
---
Hi, /u/g0ns0ku

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ca8zfe/idk_if_priest_or_warlock/). 
---
&gt;Those that want Classic gold are much better off buying it from a 3rd party.
---
People just don't like using sketchy third party sites. Are regular gold buyers going to keep using third party? Yes of course. In that respect you are correct.
---
There’s tank scarcity for dungeons, but not really for raids. If you think about it, every 40 man raid only needs 2 dedicated tanks(there’s fights where you need more, but a sword and shield on any warrior will do). For dungeons, you need 1 tank per 5 people. So for the same 40 people you now need 8 tanks. 
---
Getting a spot in a raid as a tank is fairly difficult too. Usually tanks are the officers/GM, or friends with the GM.
---
That’s great to know, thanks!
---
knowing that the world im in is the same one as everyone else on that serv-
---
oh wait, nvm
---
I mained a dwarf rogue in vanilla with a druid alt. The druid started as my main. The rogue was more forgiving on the dps meters. I switched back to the druid during Wrath to heal.
---
The mechanostrider is the only racial mount that looks bad to me. I had both a night saber and a palomino as a NE. Ram is only ok.
---
The amount of these Balance Druid memes that are showing up is too high.  
---
Everyone that thinks the meta will play like it was back in 2006 are beyond help. Forget about Balance for a second, even as Restoration and Feral. Innervate is for themselves in 2019. If your Priest is dumping 11k mana in 30seconds. You have bigger problems.  
---
Do some research. Learn the current meta. Then try and make shit posts like this.
---
But can't you just come back to do those quests as a big boy and quite quickly do the quests?
---
Did you mean to reply to lollypatrolly?  Either way I hope what you're saying is true.
---
You’re much more likely to be scammed by an individual with no accountability than a company with a reputation and VISA/MC/PayPal TOS to uphold.
---
Time
---
Have blizzard stated release times worldwide or for regions?
---
Do you only speak in clichés?
---
I'd love the more details aswell please!
---
Just time. Doesn't matter how far away you are, it only matters how long it's been since you performed a combat action against another player.
---
It's not like PvE where the second you have aggro you're locked in combat.
---
No actual time has been given.
---
In a interview they said "a couple of months" for phase 1-&gt;2, they want first phase to be short so people have plenty of stuff to do.
---
The other phases they said they will be flexible of when they release them, depending on how players progress. They don't want to release a new raid when only a few people have completed previous one.
---
Have a look at nobbel on YouTube if you like to dig into the lore and then pick your character based around what intrigues you the most!
---
Three days of waiting to get in until things settle, or three days of layering until things settle? I’d rather the latter.
---
What is that book/guide name?
---
Being top dps doesn't matter in my experience, at the point you get atiesh you basically have naxx on farm, so it goes to the most dedicated player.
---
I think so, I'll be home in a few minutes to check
---
Sure, but thats vague and easy to work with. Its not like "this person is a general, focus their fight around adds, or this person is a named mage that people know about, give them these iconic abilities"
---
thats all i was thinking
---
If you're doing it purely for the gear aspect, then that's a very ineffective use of your time.
---
Right from the get-go, both of you are wasting 50% of your time. Half of the time you're on tank characters that gain nothing by doing dungeons.
---
To somewhat counter that initial 50% waste, you need to tailor the group for the gear preference of your alt. But EVEN if you create the perfect group for your rogue alt, you're STILL wasting 50% of your time because you need to return the favour and tank HIS alt.
---
It would have the same effect if you joined a dungeon group with 1 other physical dps. AND then your friend wouldn't be wasting his time on tank that needs no gear.
---
So it's just really ineffective use of your time. Ofc if you add FUN into the mix and you like playing with that guy, then it's a whole different story.
---
They didn't 14 years ago. Why would they change that now? #nochanges still apply after all
---
Hahaha love this! I legit had noggenfoggers filling my bag and bank always.
---
It sure as hell was not. But he is very rich and he did buy tickets.
---
I remember missing raids because I forget to queue up an hour early lol. I'm pro layering as long as it goes away eventually, which I'm afraid it won't.
---
For better or worse I think it a really good sign for classic that Blizzard spent the resources on laying in the first place instead of just using sharding. It shows an actual commitment to address what what classic players want while still appealing to a broader audience.
---
I haven't seen this. Is there any evidence otherwise? Video? Patch notes? Blue response?
---
Blizzard does not ban people for buying gold. And they won’t get involved in cross-game transactions because there’s no way to verify them, nor do they care.
---
You’re delusional if you think people will accept finding an individual they don’t know to trade with AND accept a 25% tax over just using a website.
---
id get an add on like qusetie or something, that way you can prevent yourself from wandering around looking for stuff
---
I think you'd be surprised by just how many people DON'T use auction addons. I buy vendor trash on the AH all the time for less than it vendors for.
---
Who wouldn't be if some self-centered druid is ruining your well-deserved place on top of the healing meter?
---
People that won't hit 60 week 1 but want the guild to kill Rag week 1 would be the ones leveling warlocks...
---
Macro Questions:
---
\- Do we have the macro icons and API that retail uses, or are they limited to what you could do in 1.12?
---
\- Do you still need a startattack macro for all your abilities in classic?
---
Well, you’re gonna have to either deal with it or wait a few weeks.
---
Theoretically...every guild that even bothers raiding will clear naxx eventually.
---
But in reality, most guilds die and consolidate sometime during AQ40 because its the biggest difficulty spike in Vanilla raiding. You actually do have to be pretty dedicated to progress in Naxx.
---
Nah, doing it myself is fine on whatever level of difficulty. 
---
I don't feel more fulfilled by killing a mythic or a lfr. I just want to watch it die and be a part of it. After that it's just gear farming, and as has been established you can do that just about anywhere. 
---
Redoing a boss over and over to be rewarded in being able to kill it but on a higher difficulty isn't a rewarding experience for me.
---

Let's just say that you're being very liberal with the word code by calling the route files that. JSON reads very much like text and after you understand the very basics, all you do is copy paste. I've spent some time building a routing tool for people who absolute don't want to take the JSON approach, but it always ends up feeling very clunky and slow, even for those with no prior programming experience. I'll try harder and hopefully come up with something better.
---
Wowhead pvp guide is probably trash, can you link it tho?
---
And yes blizzlike it's 10%.
---
Option C: New updated private servers baby!
---
Ty
---
5 seconds of not doing direct damage or taking direct damage. Dots don't count.
---
I can’t speak for Horde quests, but from my experience going through nearly every Alliance quest in the Beta through level 33-34 quests, most Alliance faction quests gave spillover rep to the other three factions, but there were a few exceptions, usually Darnassus rep quests (The Tower of Althalaxx questline, some Ashenvale/Stonetalon quests, and a few others). On the other hand, I’ve also found three quests that gave 200 rep to all four factions, usually at the end of a long quest chain (Reception from Tyrande, Bride of the Embalmer, and The Missing Diplomat).
---
I’ve always wondered where the Horde gets their gigantic tusks. I don’t remember any fauna in either continent that has like 50-foot tusks.
---
Retard bfa zoomer
---
I can't wait to do all of the old warlock class quests. Locks definitely were my favorite in Legion but it got me craving the old days of enslaving my demons one by one.
---
Do you think that gold sellers in any way are a detriment to the game?
---
Paladin has the most obvious impact in both PvE and raids, and if you want to be making clutch plays then go Paladin.
---
I'd say go feral. It sounds like you want to play druid, and you'll get a raid spot as a feral. Don't be swayed by this "only one per raid" nonsense, your  innervate and battle res are of huge benefit, and off-tanking and healing are also to your benefit. You can also do really well in PvP, especially as a flag carrier.
---
That’s not expensive at all for a book like this.
---
Clicks all consumes, wow what a good player, such skill
---
You're arguing against a technique that has been well established for 15 years my friend!
---
&gt; where you could choose which layer you wanted to join like an actual realm, and you would be stuck on that until they merged them. 
---
That would be the same as not having layering and just using regular servers though.
---
On pservers or Retail?
---
Likely in a guild that doesn't really care, or just as filler sub-40 people. Some bad DPS is better than less total DPS.
---
That doesn't really solve the "holding on to DKP" problem.
---
I was a priest main, and I was angry and jaded af. But it was because I was also the guild leader and had to constantly deal with loot drama and people's drama in general. 60 something active members with a 45 person raid core. I was one stingy priest.
---
Browsing this sub again, we just want to play
---
Until 1.12.0 it was a 25% reduction each kill. After 1.12 it was 10%. So we'll have the 10% reduction.
---
**Q** can be used to open the legend and **Esc** to close it.
---
I'm a dumb programmer that still hasn't managed to make a welcome screen that would clarify these things.
---
He did say loot council with trustworthy officiers tho
---
That'd be great. I'll be having this on a surface propped on my desk.
---
remake old dps numbers in an addon :O
---
TIL that innervating the healer that know to manage their mana is actually necessary / useful.
---
It will be on the same realms. With no extra subscription cost they won’t open more realms just to separate the community into four.
---
Keep in mind there will be no BGs on release. I think you'll need to wait for phase three for those. Maybe phase two.. Can't remember lol
---
They won't shut down classic
---
cool-- thanks! definitely plan on using when classic hits, have already shown to others and they liked it as well
---
Old ElitistJerks articles are your PVE source.
---
As far as PVP goes, get good.. watch rogue content from all over and check their play.
---
Of course then I talk with the tank I'm a saint like. Tanks don't need to know about our dark side.
---
You’ll be very disappointed in a few years :/
---
Lol, what do you main now??
---
Why is engineering allowed in duels?
---
Why isn't alchemy allowed?
---
Because originally you didn't roll a class because of what it does best. You rolled a class because you liked many aspects other than its main roll in raid. And it's a pain in the ass to build an alt just for raiding.
---
But we get it. If a thing is not minmaxed then it does not make sense to you. Right.
---
I feel like coca cola is not something you should just be downing either lol
---
To your second point, I've never paid anyone to tank for me, nor do I think I would. Being big dick swinging top tier tank is great and all, but there will 100% be a shit ton of tanks who fall into the "good enough to not kill the group" category and will do it for free. 
---
If you want to sell runs of something get yourself an UBERS key son, that'll be where the quick money for runs is.
---
I won't have much time with work these days but I am most looking forward to feeling character progression even while leveling.
---
I guess if you stack worldbuffs, have great gear, and get a windfurry proc crit, you could get a big number.  Hard to do realistically I would think.
---
Hmmm doggy style
---
It would be their lowest rated episode in a decade. Nobody but you and I care about WoW anymore.
---
How do they have more than 40 people when they are used to being 25 man guilds? Also leveling an army of locks to 20 and putting them everywhere sounds like several days of work by itself.  They would need 3 locks at every location to do the summoning. Honestly they probably would waste more time leveling and running all  those locks everywhere they want than time it would save them in the first 7 days.
---
So you are saying when they re-release they won’t have achievements for the people who kill stuff first?
---
I'm willing to get stuck in a queue knowing that the people who got in are having the most chaotic experience trying to figure out how to get past the herd.
---
Did we watch the same tournament? The admin tournament was griefed for like 3 hours, had basically no rules that was enforced, the brackets were drawn onto a cardboard box and 3/4 of the brackets were drawn without someone’s name in the hat.
---
I’ll take a thousand of this tournament before suffering through watching the asmond one again.
---
10% is nothing compared to the satisfaction of ruining somebody's quest, over and over again.
---
Haha fair enough, I’ll let you sort out the boomkin drama
---
Yeah, no. Most guilds that raid will not clear naxx eventually.
---
Out of all the posts against layering, none ever provide a solution or even a compromise. Blizzard did though, they limits it to the first phase
---
Do intend to use any kind of software to help you with it?
---
Classic wont force you to continue to TBC though, so to say "max 2 per guild will get it" is incorrect.
---
Saddest thing in the pic: Combat log **"What happened to me?"**
---
Remove layering
---
Okay this sounds like super fun! I will definitely take some inspirations from your pipedream. If there was a way that people moving onto raiding and actually contributed back to their academy/college would be so cool. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
It’s not free money. Your time is worth at least 1s 39c *per second* in-game. So if it takes you 10 seconds to scan, buy, collect, and vendor - the profit needs to be at least ~14s.
---
I don’t bother scanning or listing on the AH at all. If something has no value but currency to me, I just vendor it.
---
&gt;Hardcore players wanting to optimize everything will play warriors for dps, but Im thinking this part of the community is small.
---
Why is that?
---
I dont think Warrior is an absolute class.
---
I usually scan the AH while I poop and come back and just hit the search button and it pops up results instantly. No loss to the scan.
---
I think that there will be enough players to form a B team guild where everyone can still get gear.  I hate this idea that there are only hardcore raid guilds with 100 members and everyone farms for 3 players. "Normal" guilds will emerge and dedicated "normal" people will play at their pace. 
---
If that ret pally had good gear hed do better damage.
---
Most of the tanks in vanilla have absolutely no clue about what they are doing, that is for all the classes tho, if you are good you will be always on demand, a tip I give is to have yourself a healer, make a healer friend and have him heal you in dungeons, things will go really smooth.  
---
The later the game goes no tank will want to waste time doing random dungeons so if people want a tank they will usually have to pay them, we used to give tanks resist greens or something they asked for w/e reason from strat because we needed tanks asap
---
You are missing a key factor..... most of these private servers are run in a way in which legally blizzard cannot force them to do anything. If private servers based in various RU,EU and CHN are harming your bottom line, then your server is shit to begin with. 
---
I personally wouldnt care if Blizzard went after private servers, but they will not and cannot go after most of them.
---
Even on that basis you could bank what meat you pick up along the way. 
---
Ultimately whatever way you look at it, it's going to be less efficient to solely fish than utilising the meat that drops along the way through questing. That should be included.
---
Well that would be the same for any guild above casual level. And that time is not obscene, granted that you don't have to do it in a rush before every raid, but prepare well for raids for a while to come, so that you e.g. have farmed runes for some days to last you a while, then you farm gold for X consume another day, etc, instead of doing them one by one before every raid. 
---
The difference is that a hardcore guild will have an efficient process for gatherings those consumables, and probably have many of them as a collective guild pile of consumables, that every raider contributes to and uses from, so that the time spent per person will be lower. At the same time they need less consumables, because the clear raids faster and don't whipe. Whereas a guild struggling, but still tries hard,  will need to use new elixirs and pots every whipe, and their raid will last longer than a flask. 
---
So I'd say that the people needing to spend most time on raiding are those that have the intention of trying to hard, but for some reason (bad raid leaders, etc) are spending extra effort on actually clearing the content.
---
Lol just because it’s a symbol doesn’t mean you can just make up whatever you want. 
---
“The orc on the cover symbolizes the poverty of the immigrants trying to cross over into our country”
---
See?? Am I right just because I said it’s a symbol?
---
This also applies to your gf btw
---
Let me just cut your journey short: You won't find such a list.  
---
I would simply do as you've planned. Max out TB quests, but if possible I would do Orgimmar quests in between. I have a feeling that if any other faction would 100% spill over to TB, it would be Org.
---
 Which Races are BIS for Warriors? (for both Horde and Alliance)
---
Prepare your wallet
---
A fair guild, what you put in you get out. Far to many times I've seen people just turn up for raids get loot then fuck off till reset. Then there is people who actually help others, farm mats and seem to be on equal terms.
---
Haha
---
Would make a bucnh of these and just use them for DnD minis
---
Cancer chat. Not kidding. I like some good laughs while lvling.
---
I think you missed my point. You're on a tank that doesn't need any gear 50% of the time. Using your method you are literally always wasting MINIMUM 50% of your time. Always.
---
You can try to STAY at 50% wasted time, by denying classes that share your alt's gear type access to your group. If your alt is a priest, you deny all other spell classes access.
---
Wasting 50% of your time is a BEST case scenario using your method. The tank scarcity has to severe to make that worthwhile.
---
Thank you for the response. I can tell you put a lot of thought and work into this. I plan on using the site regardless. It's really awesome to see classic finally getting the third party support it deserves :)
---
No the first one was so perfect I dont want a part 2
---
wouldn't make sense to me
---
It's been a while. Is PI is power infusion, right?
---
Bringing one or two bad dps of 25-30(?) is a pretty minor problem. That 200-500 DPS of z*25 is extremely small and not the reason for whipe
---
I always saw myself as having two jobs.
---
* Dying before the healer
---
* Turning things into sheeps
---
Shooting giant balls of fire was just a perk.
---
How do fights break out over dkp? The only advantage to dkp is that it is 100% fair and avoids loot drama.
---
Why would anyone want that?  South Park mocked the WoW community and made playing a low status behavior.
---
I got mine from the pre-order store link on the [kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/whenitsready/the-world-of-warcraft-diary-0).
---
Does human racial for spirit only affect base spirit or is it calculated with all the +spirit items?
---
I understand there's a drop-off in hunter damage in AQ and Naxx. Are they still brought into raids? How about in organized PvP?
---
I don't care about topping meters,I just want to be a part of progression and be seen as valuable. 
---
Is it hard to get T2.5+ gear that's BiS when rogues and warriors can deal more damage?
---
Eh, this game, especially classic, does not have explicit rewards for world first kills.  It's a player-driven goal, and there aren't any official rules.  The guild with the most resources and strategy will reach it first, but they are using mechanics other guilds can use as well.  It was never intended for world firsts to be 'fair' in requiring people to level without support from other characters, that's your opinion you're spouting as fact.
---
 My plan for finding a guild is just get to know people as I level. Hopefully when I am level 60 I will have a friendlist that isn't pathetically small and hopefully one of the guys on that list is in a nice guild that have a spot open. Feels better joining a guild when you know someone there. 
---
 One thing I would look for in a guild would be a good loot system. How would you know in advance though if a loot council is corrupt( guessing loot council will be the norm)? Would suck to spend a lot of time in a guild only to realize you are never going to get a chance at the best loot no matter how much of an effort you make. 
---
 Another thing would be that the guildchat isn't super annoying. I'm not a kid and it gets annoying if there is a lot of silliness all the time. Nothing wrong with it, it's just not for me. I prefer it if there is more a "professional attitude"( for a lack of a better word, English isn't my first language) and the talk is more about the game rather than never-ending talk about non WoW stuff.
---
Good dudes, reliable folks that take things seriously but at the same time dont require you to no life 
---
Folks that dont get offended by every little thing
---
Horde: PvP - Orc, PvE - troll for threat gen, but orc is pretty great too with axe spec.
---
Alliance: Human for both I believe.
---
For PVE Orc and Human. Followed by Dwarf and Troll.
---
PVP gnome or dwarf. Orc is still.
---
It isn’t. It still is one of the best mmos out. To the point of DFO which is pay to win in China and Korea, is the only thing that can make more money than it.
---
Yeah, but that doesn’t work for the buying, collecting, and censoring - which is at least 3 seconds per item and even more on Classic because the artificial spell batching affects everything, including buying, selling, and looting.
---
no because the artist decides the symbolism.  if you decide that then it's just a coincidence, and you can look for symbols that may or may not exist.
---
Yeah I guess it makes more sense to use nightfall or another weapon with actual melee dps stats while swinging, then swap to a caster weapon while healing. No real need to care much about a caster 2 hander specifically.
---
Engineering consumes are cheap and alchemy consumes are expensive as fuck (free action potion)
---
I think the best way to do LC would actually have everything be transparent.  The decision criteria/order, etc.  That way people know what to expect.
---
Off the bat I’d say paladin is the easy pick for a few reasons. 
---
They offer a lot of value to group play with minimal player investment, they’re straightforward to gear and very accessible. Gameplay is streamlined so that adding utility (hands, auras, cleanses, heals, hoj) is easily done while maintaining your rotation regardless of spec. 
---
The downside is that some people find the play style  boring and shallow and your pvp as ret is pretty much the same as pve (imo). Holy is more dynamic in pvp but pretty static in pve, but that’s an imo. 
---
Druids are pretty much the un-paladin. There are some very real reasons why they were the least played class and have a pretty crap reputation from the time. 
---
They take a lot of player investment to even be middling outside of resto. The opportunities to add utility are there but the rotations aren’t as streamlined as paladin and this can lead druids chasing meters to get tunnel vision and miss out. So way less accessible outside of tanking which is pretty simple. 
---
The upside is that it’s hard.
---
The number of available females with cute Instagram photos, obviously. /s
---
No it must be how else does someone make money. If he bought lotto tickets he must be a smart man and that's how he got his money
---
Played Druid from launch. Can confirm it was terrible. They removed Hurricane entirely, it was that bad.
---
&gt;Unless you never buy or sell anything to another player, you’re supporting Chinese gold farmers.
---
Ya that's a pretty big stretch there. Like a massive stretch. Here I'll throw some random shit together and make a similar analogy. I farm irl. Does some of that food end up on the plate of a serial killer? At some point sure. So I'm lowering the cost of food, by producing more, thus helping serial killers!!!! 
---
&gt;You’ll be using a 3rd party site to find them.
---
I mean ya. Discord is a third party site. So you arent wrong. There will probably be a discord channel dedicated to trading gold. Not exactly what I was talking about tho was it?
---
Why dont you just post all the details so everyone who reads can benefit?
---
Its much more fun to be an evil rogue 
---
"im bad and thats good, ill never be good and thats not bad. Theres no one id rather be than me"
---
On pservers, you can get to level 10 with your starting gun (as dwarf in teldrassil). Even the hardest part isn't terrible. Engage at max range and use swing timers to know when to move backwards to get an extra shot or two in along with timing your sting and arcane shot. 
---
Even at it's most challenging, it's still easier by far than leveling a rogue.
---
That’s not how it works.
---
That's right, thanks for the reminder :)
---
Questing with a random stranger, only to add them and have a tank 20 levels latter
---
Now that's a bit over the top mean. You should apologize.
---
I think I want to go for a dwarf only guild if I can find one.  I love the dwarf flavor in this game and having to operate around the class limitations in groups would be interesting too.  Don't need no corrupt magic users(holy doesn't count) or obnoxious jumping nightelves.  Dwarf players are usually a cut above the rest too ;)
---
All I want to do is wander the worldmap getting into dwarven shenanigans and to do the odd dungeon and battleground to spice it up.
---
I think I actually said that. "I dunno I just spam flash, have you tried that?" We don't have a flash. "Oh that sucks"
---
If you dont come to raid prepared, then you need to find another guild. People are not a scarce resource, if you cannot do basic shit like bring consumables, farm your preraid bis and use a proper spec most benificial to the raid, then you are not needed.
---
Homepage?
---
That perfect medium between shit posting but not "I'm 17 and the n word is funny" shit posting. And mature people that want to progress but not "I'm 30 and have a wife and kids".
---
I don't think it exists.
---
Warriors are pretty much the best DPS in terms of numbers and flexability (they can OT easily), so long as they can gear.
---
Warriors are a popular class for a reason, they are the definitive raid and dungeon tank, are unreal in PvP while also topping the meters in PvE as DPS.
---
I'm really on the fence as to take Fishing or not. 
---
I've done a test run on just using drops as I'd neither levelled cooking or fishing back in the day. I think so long as you know what meat not to vendor it's pretty easy, if not a little hard on inventory space. 
---
I was also levelling BSing at the time, so I had opportunity to go back to the bank and drop 10x Bear Meat/Goretusk Snout/Spider Ichor etc.
---
I need to experiment with fishing as I have zero idea how long it would take in real time to catch 55 fish... 
---
As I'm rolling Alliance it seems that Deviant Fish are an absolute pain to farm, so I'm further put off.
---
What about Tauren's hit range?
---
This "suiciding to the bottom of the list every time you get a piece of gear" really makes it hard for people to take gear that isn't super good. What do you do when everyone passes on that T1 pally gear?
---
Exactly, the best part.
---
Retailers who play warrior/rogue will quit at level 15 when they still haven't got any titanforge epic weapon and have died 3 times to harpies in the barrens.
---
Big debate about whether or not that mount also requires exalted Darnassus.
---
be prepared to play the game for 10 years.
---
Doing this but on the ships and MCing people off into the water and dying of fatigue. It was my fav thing in the game.
---
I couldn't help but notice the Sagefish and Greater Sagefish did not have locations. I assume these would mostly come from pools. Any information where the pools commonly spawn?
---
Classic.wowhead mentions Loch Modan and Stonetalon. Would pools spawn in any level appropriate zone with fishable water?
---
Protection paladins can steam roll DM east
---
join a hardcore guild and be a really tryhard player
---
omg, as someone whose favorite cartoon growing up was Jem, THIS IS THE BEST WOW VIDEO I'VE EVER SEEN
---
so you’re asking for the echange rate between $ and gold. Not only is it extremely variable over time and server, but it’s also bannable so I don’t see why it’s a question in the first place
---
To find a good guild, look at what they do outside of raiding. How active are they in pvp and in doing fun  guild events. Any guild can raid, but it takes a special group of people to make every day an adventure.
---
Come chat with us in /r/ClassicWoWplus
---
https://shivtr.com/ have a really good signup system + so much more suitable for wow, like gbank and stuff
---
I'm sure Layered servers will have an increased cap as well because they wouldn't want to have 100k join a single server and make the layers non-collapsible. So there's already a cap, and they wouldn't need adjusting. If they guess the tourist percentage will be 75% then they should make all the caps 12k for phase one in both cases, reducing to 3k for phase two in both cases.
---
Here's the thing, I know how long it takes to progress in Classic WoW, it takes quite a lot of commitment to hit 30. I'd say once a "tourist" hits 30 they stop being a tourist and 90% of the time they will end up playing the game long term. So I'm proposing that they shard the game pre-30, and for 30+ zones the whole server converges. My reasoning being, if there ends up being too many people in STV then that's just proof that they underestimated Classic and made the caps too high and/or too few servers in the first place; and this'd be just as big a problem either way, so there's no reason to throw end game economy/world pvp under the bus just so the players don't realize Blizz miscalculated for a little while longer.
---
Yeah, Auctioneer will find and buy it for you, but it still has to do it one at a time and with spell batching, it’s a noticeable annoyance. Then it’s the same for getting them out of the mail, even with Postal. And the same again for the addon that vendors grey items. One per server heartbeat. It’s the worst thing about the artificial spell batching, the auto-loot feature feels laggy as hell because of it.
---
So you’re definitely talking at least 3 seconds of non-shared time per item. Which means the profit needs to be about 5 silver if you’re on a 50 GPH minimum wage.
---
&gt;Am I alone to believe it will make casters and ranged non-viable in pvp?
---
Yes.
---
EB isn't the best, but it's possible.  I did it on the beta just fine.
---
Frost Shock is more of a slow.
---
Most classes can do some form of trash farm, hunters probably come closest with their trib runs
---
Not always but it did happen and it was funny/frustrating seeing your character get hit with a killing blow from far away.
---
More like to upset rogues getting hit out vanish more than anything.
---
Ok. That’s good then. So you think hunters are still playable in pvp?
---
Yeah like who is going for Honor lol
---
My little secret is Malay/Venezuelan gold farmers.
---
Higher difficulty completely changes how you fight boss, because even smallest mistakes can cause wipe plus there are new mechanics in higher difficulties.  
---
If by just walking in LFR and facerolling a boss is the same to you as progressing on a mythic boss through hundreds of pulls then idk what to tell you  
---
you probably play all games on journalism mode
---
PvE server, PvE server, PvE server.
---
If your playtime is at a premium then you don't want to waste that time getting stealth ganked and corpse-camped by some nolife basement dwellers who spend 12-14 hours a day online.  You'll make much more progress when you can quest and travel freely.
---
You won't have time for hunting herb and mining nodes, so take skinning and skin your kills as you go.  And since you're skinning, take leatherworking too if you're playing a class that wears leather.
---
Play a class that other players want in their group so you don't have to wait forever to get into a dungeon or raid, especially a tank or healer.  If you play a tank you've always got a group.  Stay away from rogues or DPS warriors - they're a time a dozen and nobody's favorite groupmate.  Hunters are great for soloing but you could have a hard time getting into a dungeon or raid.
---
Mages, spriests and warlocks are always welcome.  If you play a druid you can tank, DPS or heal so that might maximize your playtime.
---
You aren't getting it, but I really don't care dude. Sorry. GL.
---
Fucking yes
---
I bet a T3 prot pally could.
---
You bring up a really valid point lol when I had my twinks in BC BGs didn’t give xp. I’m really curious how they will manage that in classic.
---
The hype around the game is enough to convince them for me
---
FYI there was 0 chatter going on in general chat, except for the few of us asking for a layer invite.
---
I don't even think anyone on another layer could see it.
---
it decreases their deadzone, it’s not something negative for the hunter
---
I dunno, I bet he might assuming his characters don't get erased by the private server shutting down
---
Typically speaking I would assume the gold will eventually be 10$ = 100g. I think it will dip further over time but its easy math. With that said, extrapolating the cost from retail to classic it would mean around 300g for a token.
---
For your Discord method to be viable, there has to be enough players willing to pay 25% more and go through the inconvenience. Consumers just don’t do that, even if they hate China like you do.
---
On pservers the auras didn't stack. We don't know how it will work with say moonkin aura as an example.
---
Not for the time being, sorry!
---
But I can get hit at 8 yards so after I wing clip I’m still fucked for a few seconds right?
---
high work, high reward. 
---
pain to level, gear, pvp without healer, farm gold. =P
---
lots of upsides... and downsides.
---
Which race should be BIS for Warriors: Orcs or Taurens?
---
You will find dungeon groups easily as 1/5 (20%) people are tanks.
---
Raiding something like 3-4 / 40 (\~10%) are tanks so you will have to be more skilled/geared to earn a spot.
---
Rag is dead within 9 days 100%
---
Berserking in BGs is the big one, and remember both the attacker and the target can have the buff.
---
Probably true sadly. 
---
Back in the day that wow episode was their best shit. Amazingly fun and to the point lol.
---
See, I'm not so sure. I was always under the impression that Perplexity was hands down better. And I would say that his knowledge on rogue is top of the board, but then I happened to watch a few of Payo's streams and he is hands down more fluent with with timing and plays than Perplexity. Perhaps, it's just his reaction times are better? I'm not sure, but having followed Perplex for a long time.....I would actually put money on Payo being the better player.
---
A subreddit to alternative wow after classic nice
---
Thanks! This seems like a solid choice
---
Yup, I was gonna hit 5 first and then go but I'd likely hit 6 before clearing the lowest level quests, so I decided 4 would be the best time to go. It's really not that far to Hearth and train skills either. A quick jaunt back through Dun Morogh over the cliff and I can easily be back in Teldrassil/Darkshore.
---
Got plan a little more carefully between levels 10-20, though. The shortcut will give Res Sickness at that point, so that's something to consider. As soon as you hit 20 its smooth sailing with Teleport.
---
They don’t ban people for buying anymore.
---
The stream povs were always unsynced  when they tried to switch between them and this tournament has warlocks summoning people around to stay head of the trolls so idk what tournament you’re watching
---
World of roguecraft was a thing for a reason.
---
Fuck off kid.
---
If you get in close range you need to be feign / trapping or scatter / trapping to get range.
---
Of course. Good luck.
---
In my experience the best guilds are the ones who start from a small dedicated group of good players and grow slowly. Over time other people will see your success and they will want to be part of that success. The idea is you don't invite a bunch of people to make a big guild, you are friendly and really good at the game then people notice and want to join you, so you have a big guild. People get the cart before the horse with the Big Guild / Good Guild methodology. Focus on yourself, play the best you can, do not talk openly about your guild recruiting and do not openly invite people. Let those who are interested come to you. Otherwise you mass invite a bunch of random people who have no loyalty and in a few months they will leave the guild with a few other of your guildies they befriended. So...
---
Do not invite/recruit people. Let people inquire about your guild themselves. The people who inquire about your guild will be more likely to stick through hard times and will generally be more loyal to the guild.
---
Focus on playing well and be a mature, positive and friendly member of your server. Build a reputation and make sure the people you play with have the same values.
---
It's a double-edged knife since you also can get hit from further. You can only attack a single target (well, aside certain skills like SS/WW), but multiple foes can attack you at once, so it may end up working against you instead.
---
What's the portion of people who played vanilla 15 years ago here you think? My background is vanilla, BC then pservers. I don't get your comment.
---
I just flashed back 15 years holy fuck lmao, that fucking bag
---
Yup. 
---
"Oh, just ask for an invite." 
---
Is the worst way to include immersion into a server.
---
All I'm asking for is a smooth launch, or a launch with minimal clusterfuckyness.  I'm flying 900 miles so my cousin and I can relive the glory days in the same room, so I hope Blizzard is ready for at least 5 million screaming fans to come stampeding through their doors at the same time.
---
Thanks for the answer, I guess that my playstyle is more adapted to the warlock class, but my first toon was a mage and the nostalgia is making the decision a lot harder.
---
Tokens came in 2015 and I know from my own experience that buying gold didn’t get you banned atleast in 2013. Of course people will buy gold. If you have the money, why not?
---
Yes, plus that extra 1% dodge is nice (unless you’re fighting an arms warrior).
---
Thanks for the advise! I'm thinking Mage, Hunter or Resto Druid, how do you think they compare in Raid Demand/Gear Competition? Also can druids farm gold/solo content as resto?
---
very blizzlike
---
gotcha, thx for the reply! =)
---
Tbh I'm interested in trying to farm the bosses for the Compendium of Dragon Slaying; being able to make decent money on the side sounds like a bonus. 
---
I'd want to farm this item for my warrior and other warrior in our guild or if you ever sold one it would go for a fortune. Tiny drop chance? Yea. But that was always the case.
---
Do you have a source for the calculations on that?
---
You are very uninformed in international laws. You also have no concept of people playing "Something" because there is nothing else they wish to play. 
---
You must have no idea how many people in their mid 30s are playing retail because they really didnt like FFXIV and there is nothing else.
---
I believe Orcs I'd you want to primarily DPS as horde, and Tauren if you want to PvP and Tank.
---
Right click report is removed for launch
---
Things turn around when you made the thorium grenades. Poly pyro pom pyro kills almost anything by the way, otherwise you’ll want to have ice barrier and mana shield. In vanilla, fire blast and cone of cold actually do damage.
---
I had about 50k honorable kills as classic mage and another 50k in TBC being legionnaire and 2,4k 2s 3s and 5s
---
Let me know if you have any questions.
---
There's plenty of Daggers and Axes you'll use as a Warrior.
---
Unless you're in a heavy progression focused guild min maxing then you will be fine. NE Warrior is so much more fun for PvP too.
---
Just like back in 2005
---
I don't care about how I fight it. Did I help kill it once? Yes, ok then everything after that is just a gear farm to me.
---
You might feel like you've achieved more because you've killed it on the hardest difficulty, and that's fine. But it's not how I see it. 
---
Boast about killing something in a game, lol no. A select few even understand the achievement. Outside of them, no one gives a crap.
---
They definitely are.  I'm leveling a pserver character and there's like 5 vulture spawns, all spread out, and you need 10 of the goddamn item.  Took so long to do.
---
Not even close to 10% it's like 3% IF THAT.
---
okay, nice anecdote but it doesn’t change the fact that it was bannable
---
It should be the default in the game no doubt about it, I hope they change it. But say they dont could someone make an addon with it? Would be annoying but just another addon ya need
---
How can a company that's running a server in china, based in china, have no power over another company running an exact copy of that server? What does international law have anything to do with that?
---
That is an interesting and revealing answer.
---
You are right. Its 10% on white hits but total dps is around 1-2% and i edited my post. Thanks for the downvote.
---
50g/h is about what most players make in vanilla at max level. I can't see a token costing more than 100-200g (factoring in blizzards cut) any more than this seriously breaks the game and would force players who are serious about raiding to spend money each week to keep up with consumable requirements.
---
If you care about PVP, you're better off going Dwarf or Gnome.
---
Night Elves make the absolute worst Alliance rogues.
---
Sword skill does nothing in pvp. Go with gnome or dwarf if you dislike gnomes and don't worry about the swordskill.
---
Exactly. Both of which are clearly superior options. Mirror servers win if you expect Blizz to underestimate Classic's potential. (prevents realm splits) Sharding wins otherwise, because it protects the end game economy. Doing both however gains both benefits without any downside other than more work on Blizzard's part.
---
So with the surplus of human warriors will axes and daggers be less competitive then?
---
The threat/dps loss is pretty significant on warrior
---
I'll be going the 14/32/5 spec as MT for MC and BWL.
---
They didn't before. At least not to an extreme. What they did in ban waves was botters. The occasional player was banned but I knew a ton of people who bought gold and weren't banned.
---
Just the fact that they were going to revisit the episodes plot it would get people watching it. That episode was pretty high ratings wise.
---
Still better for a mage to use the 1h offhand from nax with another mage using the staff
---
Not planning on going prot.
---
Charging from stealth is hilarious
---
Epic:)
---
This article won't stop me because I can't read!
---
naxxperience
---
Was a Boomkin who raided - why does everyone think they're entitled to Innervate? Isn't battle rez, 3% spell crit, and decurse/remove poison enough? FFS don't complain about Boomkins being Oom while taking the mechanic that's supposed to mitigate that away!
---
The game is not balanced around 15k people. They would need to add dynamic respawns to EVERYTHING ingame to deal with 5 times the amount of players than intended, and these can be abused again.
---
That’s true, a Balance Druid will never bring more to the table that a Mage or Resto Druid wouldn’t do better.
---
But they did it with AQ!! Listen, I understand the game enough to know what it needs. 
---
The guy said he played vanilla for over 4 years, which originally lasted roughly 2 years, so one it means he played on private servers, which without exception means his characters got wiped at some point.
---
If Blizzard did anything post Classic I just hope it's a short but sweet Scarlett Crusade Raid (Maybe Boss&gt;Boss&gt;Boss like the Icecrown Tournament.)
---
Then have some gear that drops that allows offspecs to be played more seriously.
---
Perhaps an Ahnk that gives Paladins a Taunt and some MP5?
---
A Druid trinket that gives them Mana for Oomkin?
---
I absolutely love the site. Thank you for your awesome work, it is much appreciated!
---
I have one suggestion: I keep forgetting which color means what. It would be a lot easier (for me at least) if each item on the actions list had little icons next to them, i.e. „turn in quest“ could use the yellow question mark.
---
I'm for blizzard doing whatever they want. It's their game. If i like it I will keep paying. If I don't then I won't. Easy.
---
Stoneform is definitely OP against others rogues for sure. Escape Artist is convenient but you could always take an Insignia of the Alliance if you need to escape. 1% extra hit is nice but it’s not a game changer that destroys all other rogues.
---
Now night elves are without a doubt the weakest of the four options but you’re not gimping yourself all that much unless you plan to minmax for PvE/PvP.
---
as long as they kept the legacy servers up and just created new ones for each major update of classic i think everyone would be happy. but yea i prefer BC and Wrath but i never played Vanilla so im excited to try it finally
---
That's because there's between next to and literally nothing you can craft with strictly vendor mats. Comment was reminding the added cost of required vendor mats. 
---
The Nightscape Tunic, for example. Silken Thread will eat 9-10s profit off of every craft, reputation depending. For profitability, you need to shave that off the vendor price. To break even vendoring you need to source your leathers at 7s 24c, rather than the 8s 53c that would be suggested with the tax materials forgotten.
---
No, I don't want Classic to be something way different from vanilla. I want to play vanilla WoW. I don't want to play "what vanilla would have been like with a third faction."
---
Have servers for classic wow been announced yet?
---
Yup.  We grinded Naxx in BC to get someone a staff, took like 3 months straight to get enough shards for one.  40 shards, I think like 20% drop chance per boss means only a couple per week.
---
We were talking about classic. At the point in the game when those raids were out consumables weren't even a thing.
---
how's the weather on virgin island?
---
Hell no, get new friends if they don’t want to see old orgrimmar and our one true warchief
---
This,
---
Also gnome only has 3 less base agi than nelf and an actual good racial
---
A+ comeback. You really showed that dude
---
Min maxing again son. If you're a really good player rolling a gnome warrior, do you think the really bad player rolling human warrior will be better?
---
People seem to be under the impression everyone is at an equal personal skill cap, with only racials setting them apart.
---
The only things I would really worry about racials is when it comes to PvP with things like Wotf and shadowmeld etc.
---
RemindMe!  30 November 2019
---
Only problem is that you wont have any silver to buy a fishing rod and skill, right?
---
well as long as they kept regular vanilla servers up and untampered with you could. nobody would force you to play something you dont wanna play
---
There's no way you're serious.
---
There are multiple, m'lady.
---
Interesting. This is a good advice indeed. Quality over quantity kinda. Kind of like expanding my friend list and then collectively decide to form a guild and then work our ways up the ranks. Sounds fun.
---
nope, all manual. Swapping between windows lol, but I have dual monitors so it's not as bad as it sounds. My monitor is extended between the two and i have each account running on each monitor. all I do is move the mouse back and forth. I send the Paladin in with righteous fury and use consecrate on a big group and ret aura, then arcane explosion with the mage with arcane subtelty.
---
Works like a charm.
---
And i thought infact that in a non joke set up there actually were arcane frost mages and just 1 frost mage for winters chill
---
Layering phasing sharding it's all the same to me, it termed different so we are more accepting of the medicine.
---
So much soapboxing around here.
---
What about just not telling people what to play altogether?
---
Using "projection" is the most pathetic low effort comeback.
---
 Is like the one word version of the age old most childish comeback of all time; "I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces of me and sticks to you." Except "projection" is even more fucking low effort and brainless.
---
This, but I'd say separate AH.  Likely, the economic differences between realms won't be significant by the time a merge is advisable.
---
I know they won't do this because #nochanges and I'm fine with that but I would actually love that. I'm very much looking forward to the nostalgia of Classic/pre-cata wow but I honestly have 0 desire to do 40 man raids. I've always preferred smaller raid sizes. Obviously that's just subjective - I'm not saying 20 man (for example) is objectively better than 40 man.

They're not gonna start opening custom servers with all the bizarre ideas people have.

I just read a lot of speculation here on what everyone thinks blizzard will or won't do but we simply don't know.

Perhaps they won't keep in layering for as long, I do know that I don't want to be in a queue on day 1,2,3

Hi all,
---
I am planning to level an alliance warrior on an English pve EU realm. Can only play between 09.00-12.00 pm during weeks and 10.00-night in the weekend central European time. Wanna go for a slow leveling experience and enjoy. I am an old vanilla player (39 years, Dutch) so know what to do. Anyone interested please pm me your blizzard tag so we can play together in the same realm and level together.
---
Keep in mind that on retail you could NOT see the reduction, the combat log always showed the full gain, the only thing it was taking into account was the split between different players.
---
The diminishing return was taken into account under the hood in the calculations, but if you were solo ganking someone 50 times in open world you would see the full gain 50 times, even if the full gain only actually happened once.
---
I am not sure wether the Honor tab of the character sheet worked the same way or showed the actual honor that would get taken into account in the rank calculations.
---
Can anyone from beta confirm whether the combat log works like this on the beta?
---
I'm talking about full runs. They mostly be hoping between several other groups farming for them. They quickly join to see if they get the drop and move on.
---
Ooh tss
---
You get a reduced amount.
---
Shaman tanking is as meme as priest inner fire tanking is.
---
Aim to play the game for at least 2 years as the only thing you do outside of work.
---
Right? Im starting with 4 friends on the 27th. Pretty excited to finally play the game i wanted as a kid.
---
For some reason I couldn't help myself.
---
Please elaborate on how leeway is good for hunters? Decreases dead zone?
---
I understand I can wing clip further however my opponent can slow me just the same.
---
Dead zone is 5-8 yards however realistically it is 5-11 yards.
---
I can only apply stings, concussion shot, and arcane shot on the move.
---
There is no hard cut when people leave. It's not as simple as 15k people starting and 12k people leaving by level 30. People will leave gradually over time, probably a bit faster at the beginning than later on, but there will still be tons of people that quit on max level.
---
I like to think of it as anyone not sticking to strict vanilla content should be playing a different game.
---
I don't remember the name, but the boss before geddon was arcane mage, so not all of them were heavy lava themed. Iirc the first one was also more of a curse type than a fire/lava type.
---
u dirty ferengi
---
Thinking your idea is bad doesn't make someone "really salty and closed minded". His point about splitting the population is fair.
---
Yep; we were the #3 or #4 Horde Guild on our Server and we topped out at Twin emperors in AQ40. WHen rumors started swirling about how the expac was going to make all gear irrelevant like 9 months in advance the raiding war machine died down.
---
In fact it ended up being a relief that the new raids were 25 man in a way because those 9 months of now raiding and kinda just waiting totally broke our guild. On the other hand I always missed the innate epic feel 40 man raids had.
---
Yeah, understandable. The odds are extremely low; was mostly just playing with the idea of it happening. :3
---
Good players don't need crutches ;)
---
Are there any quests for either faction that actually utilize the Faldir's Cove area? I cant ever remember doing any quests in that part of the map.
---
Yeah the disc priest buff.
---
It’s appropriate, too. There’s that cave full of forsaken in Thunder Bluff, and it was the tauren who convinced Thrall to let them join the Horde in the first place.
---
You'd be suprised indeed, when I'm playing a lower level character in a lower level dungeon the dps is all over the place. And it's just impossible to pick 1 target because people will just go and pick the other and keep switching.  
---
I often find myself sweating from the exertion it takes to keep finding the best target because my group is just doing random targeting.
---
Up to 9% for PvE, and it does not matter much in PvP.
---
Where am I being salty? Your thread literally asks the community what they think of your idea. You're clearly just whining because I don't like your idea.
---
Classic is being brought back because there's a huge demand for **vanilla WoW.** There is not a huge demand for all the thousands of random ideas that all kinds of people personally think would be fun. There's a bunch of these not-actually-vanilla ideas and none of them individually have *any* provable demand beyond what tiny fraction of the community is suggesting that particular thing (usually just the one guy who suggests it).
---
If there was a big demand for custom vanilla servers with whole new rulesets, or tiers of new custom content or whatever, there would have been popular private servers that offered things like these. Instead, the *only* private servers that have *ever* been succesful were the ones that were as close to real vanilla as possible. In fact, the quality of a private server is measured almost exclusively by how close it is to vanilla.
---
For that reason, I don't see the point of Blizzard listening to these custom server ideas that clearly have no widespread appeal. Have you seen a lot of people asking for a third faction? Enough to fill at least one entire server? Of course not, just as you haven't seen thousands of players asking for the same balance change or the same type of new content or any of the other countless things that all kinds of people have come here to suggest.
---
If you come here asking what people think of your idea and you start calling them salty if they don't like it, you're not really here to ask us what we think. You're here to say "this is what I think they should do and I don't give a shit what others think," but you thought you could phrase it as a question in order to not sound like an entitled weirdo who thinks his stupid personal idea should be inflicted on everybody.
---
It took years to get Blizzard to make Classic. They've *repeatedly* stating that their priority is to create an exact replica of vanilla. They haven't so much as acknowledged any of these idiotic custom server ideas. Why should I assume that they'll devote a whole server to exactly your idea?
---
In short, your idea is dumb and you presented it in a shitty way.
---
Playing with people that I will actually see again
---
I think raiders like good art and interesting themes to dungeons as much as anyone. But this was before WoW even came out. Blizzard was still learning, players were still learning.
---
Plus he just needed a raid area created quickly, and was encouraging a coworker to get it done. I don't think anyone should take that comment as any sort design gospel. Look at Karazhan as an example of themed encounters, and players talk highly about that dungeon.
---
It's going to be an issue in Org or IF. They will have to keep those layered if the population doesn't decline.
---
This really makes me want to play on an RP server on launch
---
That's clearly wrong.
---
Mages and Warlocks can also solo Tribute runs.
---
Thanks!

I don't know horde 1-10 well enough to build one, but it should be completely possible.
---
Removing those bugs doesn't have clearly negative effects on the game.
---
Nope.
---
&gt; Not sure how much 6% hit vs 10% hit makes a difference.
---
Just to chime in on this specific part, I found [this resource](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Magical_resistance) with the following table on spell hit:
---
Level|PvE|PvP
---
:--|:--|:--
---
Vs. +0 level (same level)|4%|4%
---
Vs. +1 level|5%|5%
---
Vs. +2 level|6%|6%
---
Vs. +3 level|17%|13%
---
Vs. +4 level|28%|20%
---
Each additional level|+11%|+7%
---
(also, I checked the wiki history, and that data comes from an edit in 2005, so it should apply to Classic)
---
I'm definitely not an expert on this, but from what I understand, getting 3 points of Shadow Focus will hit-cap you against enemies ≤2 levels higher than you. Going beyond 3 points doesn't seem to provide much benefit (except in very specific scenarios like an enemy Mage with [Arcane Focus](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=11222)).
---
Let's hold hands and do it together
---
I'd just like to add on to this, although your single target dps is lacking you can just aoe dps 4-6 mobs pretty easily and get more damage and farming done anyway.
---
Plus, it was risky to gear up a bear druid, even in 1.12. The class designers were clear that warriors were meant to be the best tanks, so even if druids had become strong tanks, people were afraid that a nerf was incoming.
---
My guild was hesitant to invest gear in dps warriors for a long time, too. All it took was one bad patch ("warriors are supposed to tank!") and all of that gear goes to waste.
---
We won't have to worry about that in Classic.
---
Nope, you just wiped on that attempted insult twice now. You can keep trying, but it won't get you anything.
---
But it sounds like you are used to not getting anything.
---
So, I wasn't sure if my laptop would run the game. Have been playing on a private server and it runs very smooth. Does this mean I will be able to run classic aswell or will there be some graphic upgrade?
---
Bean’s a great hunter, but he’s nowhere near as experienced in Classic WoW as Traquenage is. You can look him up on YouTube, he’s a sick player and probably the best hunter of Vanilla.
---
The dicks in the guild not being in a position of power.
---
Lets not. No reason to tell everyone how to make gold.
---
Frankly, don't vendor any of it, in my opinion.  I have used it all at some point.  I agree that the clam meat is the most useful because of the abundance and two recipes.  I have not gotten the recipe for tiger meat (yet), but mainly because I haven't looked.  Most of the recipes are from questing, but I just inherently check trade goods vendors now.  Someone in another chain commented on the Auberdine fish one, and it is one I always get along the way (I am a druid).  
---
I don't consider it lost gold, as I eventually sell them after cooking them.
---
1.12 comes after 1.4. It isn’t the decimal system.
---
Yeah
---
Do you have any reason to believe the technology works like that? In interviews with prior devs, one of their comments was that the playerbase would throw out tons of suggestions or criticisms (why didnt blizzard do X, Y, Z?) when in reality many things just weren't possible. 
---
People are really arrogant to assume blizzard just didn't have ideas and went with the first thing they thought of, or are otherwise ignoring ideas here.
---
You're totally right, but maybe it's from a now extinct creature or one that is very rare. And the rarity of these massive tusks would best be displayed outside a magnificent city gate, but that's just my guess.
---
You never make it to the first boss because everyone is /hugging and /kissing, talking about how great their friendship is.
---
orcs have the axe,fist bonus which helps quite a bit if you use those weapons, but it doesn´t really matter in the end, we had a tauren mt, and we did fine.
---
Any chance you could post the math?
---
Cats just require alot of consumes. So you have to put in top tier effort for middle of the pack dps. And if you dont put in that top tier effort noone will want to take you to raids
---
I'm in the same boat. Got about 30~ people in a Discord that I know from other games so I know I can rely on them in some fashion. Waiting for that big day in August so we can start the journey.
---
engineering is for 1v1 pvp tryhards. I PvPd almost exclusively in a premade with my guild so we could farm HWL for certain guildmates. I didn't need that one grenade every however often when I had an entire guild backing me up. And premade v premade was so rare it wasn't worth it to try and optimize for that scenario. Anyway I was a rogue so even 1v1 I still dominated most people without engineering. As I said, never once regretted not having it. And alchemy had the value of not having to bother people to craft shit for me, which is something I enjoy.

---
Staats is such a nice guy too and his willingness to do the latest round of dungeon talks with Josh for literally hours really shows his love of what he made. The fact that he would work on the game in his free time and was an early hardcore raider to boot? Seems to me that Blizzard needs more people like him at their company, not less.
---
I'm glad people are griefing these streamers. This is why i pick alliance.
---
Obviously, meant re: leveling.
---
Cat DPS requires a ton of extra work in the form of farming Manual Crowd Pummelers from Gnomer endlessly and it will still only put you under the actual DPS classes.  It’s only going to be worse in Classic than it currently is on private servers since it appears base damage will be lower on Classic.  
---
You will bring some utility in the form of a battle rezz, ability to off tank in a pinch, maybe jump out of cat form and toss some weak heals in a pinch, etc.... but bringing a real DPS is likely better.  
---
With 40 raid slots to fill you can probably find a guild to take you if you’re persistent and prove to be a reliable raider tho.  
---
Up to you at the end of the day.  For me the MCP farming is a complete deal breaker.  If I play a Druid I’ll likely rock a HotW spec so I can heal and tank instead.
---
Classic character creation? I didnt even know that was a thing! So we choose our realm and names ahead of time and we just cant log in I'm guessing?
---
He can do Ony still!
---
sex with his cousin
---
yea so im not gonna read your thesis on this situation. you could have simply said "i disagree but who knows" XD
---
Not really true. Weapon skill increase chance to hit and crit in PvP by 0.2% per point. Because of this it means the hitcap in PvP goes from 5% up to 6% once people start to get their ZG enchant and T2.5 sets.
---
I would sooner play without you than play without the horde.
---
Hey Nicro,
---
That's a good point. It's no a preorder anymore is it? I'm going to rename it.   
---
The Backerkit store requires me to "lock" an order before it is processed...which is utterly stupid, but that's they way they roll. You should have an email from them with a link to the PDF. Hope this helps.
---
Blizzard’s 200+ IQ move to get rid of [Dirge] and [Anal] spam is to create “pls inv to [streamer] layer!” spam instead.
---
You mean back when there was much more limited choice in games? Comparing the mentalities from 15 years ago seems like a pretty bad idea to get actual expectations.
---
I love how they won’t remove leeway for the 2% of players that didn’t play on a toaster in 2005 because it would “effect the classic experience” but they have no problem adding in layering, which is clearly effecting everyone’s experience. What a joke
---
Yes. The only thing actually pulling me away is that I've always wanted to experience Paladin in Vanilla. Love the class lore.
---
You'd be surprised.... Never assume the laziness and stupidity of people.
---
If they're not prepared, they're not good players.
---
I think you're onto something. The latest dungeon talk on Countdown to Classic that's going to come out very much touches on this. The Opera fights and other fights inside Karazhan were entirely created based upon the shape and theme of the areas created.
---
true but saying "i dont want  it so we should get it" (paraphrasing) is close minded to the desires of other people. all because you want something and i dont, doesn't mean you should get it. there is always a way to make everybody happy.
---
For EPGP isn’t it standard to have some sort of tax mechanic to prevent people from staying high on the list?
---
&gt; but for a player that's only playing 1-2 hours a week to clear BWL?  
---
He wrote 1-2 hours per day, not per week.
---
Ha! Thomas Jung taught a texturing course at my local community college. Very cool guy who gave great advice and made gorgeous art. Major factor in my push into game dev
---
Awesome thanks for the suggestion.
---
You're showing your ignorance new friend. Enjoy classic :)
---
If you are good at something never do it for free....
---
why? they are trying to organize a cool tournament. what harm does that do to the community at all?
---
Anyone know the name of the font used?
---
I you probably parsed green. You were in a shit guild, mate. No other way to put it.
---
Rule of thumb: if a player action happens without you pressing a key it's considered botting. That includes autohotkey scripts. Use at your own risk, I do not recommend it.
---
Don't worry, you aren't missing much. The trolling has been amplified 10x from his last tournament.....did Tips learn nothing from it? They have enemy name plates on as spectators too for some reason just enabling the trolls. Very sloppy and nowhere near the production level of the Rich/Asmon tournament. If you criticize them in tips channel though you'll get timed out. Pathetic attempt, I'll watch the highlights on YouTube.
---
Downvoted for saying something true without anyone bothering with a counter argument.
---
Nice sub.
---
I called him a "freaking dip" ironically, it's like a elementary school insult and it was a joke mate...
---
You have to be one of the biggest poster childs for raging against something you don't seem to understand the basic fundamentals of.
---
!Remindme 26 August 2019
---
You've read?  I mean, any guild can do whatever they want.
---
What a ridiculous false equivalency, yes because I say that going for BSH over rends swords as pre-raid BiS due to the fact that the latter is needed drastically more by melee classes and will therefore take many, many, many attempts to get and inevitably piss off whoever you take them from, that definitely means I'm implying you should pass up 10 different upgrades. /s
---
Highest diff is with cthun gloves then you jump to 4%. This is Pserver stats however so in retail might be even lower considering armor values.
---
No, unless your PVP opponent has more than 11 +defense from gear or talents, 1 point in weapon skill is worth 0.04% crit and anti-dodge/parry/block in battlegrounds and also 0.04% hit in world PVP.
---
I guess tanks are treated differently?
---
Parsed green?
---
All I am requesting is proof of your claims, which you failed at providing and instead chose to deflect.
---
Breath of the wild
---
Not that I'm aware of, but you could make one with the information from a site like [classic.db](http://www.classic.db). What class and race are you going?
---
So you're not even aware of parses? You were definitely in a shit guild, lmfao....
---
Blizzard gave us all those files.
---
I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces of me and sticks to you.
---
Backstory: Being a high school student with rather strict parents, I could not attend raids regularly. The one and only time I did an Onyxia raid was with a PUG on a Saturday afternoon during late vanilla. After inspection in Ironforge, I headed to Onyxia's Lair, only to find out the boss encounter had already started. Thankfully, the group wiped, and I got to have Onyxia all by myself :)
---
Not really, anecdotal example
---
To be fair tho, this is a geared/fullyconsumed/worldbuffed mage barely soloing it. So i wouldn't expect mages to be able to solo in this method without having most of their MC/BWL gear at the least. Also the other ogre with him (forget his name) heals the king i think, although you could counterspell that.
---
This is exactly how layering was designed. Characters are meant to be fixed to layers unless they group up. According to blizz dev interviews. It's like static mini servers within a server. Except the mini servers have the capacity of a vanilla server from 2004.
---
Now the implementation **still needs work**. It's clear there are some issues with the system in it's current state and that's what the beta should give them time to fix.
---
\&gt;  they're able to achieve top 5  
---
OMEGALUL Top 5 nice one. Maybe if your guild is filled with Downies that Autoattack and Wand through an entire raid encounter. Druid DPS is mid tier at best, and that is only if you are running full consumables and master shapeshifting in raids, which is pretty difficult.
---
Blizzard simply forgot to remove sharding
---
Actually Orcs are best for tanking for the 5 weapon skill.
---
Mage is big dps, hunter is utility and druids innervate casters/healers and hot the tank. Resto is gonna be slow to farm anything.
---
Hunters also get to farm Mara in the beginning.  Go get your epic mount in the first week.
---
&gt;Okay, then where is your source that it's worth 0.2% per point?
---
Ok, you are just fucking trolling.
---
I had an empty stormwind during the stress test.
---
&gt; Don't put words in my mouth
---
Followed IMMEDIATELY by
---
&gt; you'd change everything so you could play the way you want.
---
LOL. Not worth responding to you anymore, sorry.
---
Yeah rip hots man :/ game had potential if they would of actually put effort into it as a legit MOBA
---
Only that if layering remains, the game we are all hyped for doesn't actually exist anymore.
---
B-b-but my feelings will make me do more DPS than the guy who has 261 more raw spell damage than me!
---
It’s more than that. It’s being an active member of the guild. Helping people farm consumables, gear (these shitty dps classes are great for 5/10 mans due to flexibility in role as well as utility), recruiting, and just all around helping the guild.
---
I didn’t raid in my guild in vanilla (too young, didn’t even ding 60) but I was in my dad’s guild (I think they came from Everquest for the most part) and I remember them filling up the remaining ~15-20 slots for an encounter being really difficult. You’d recruit people into the guild, wipe on some random MC or BWL boss, and then not finish the instance and have a bunch of people quit. 
---
I don’t think people will be wiping as much anymore, but even on pservers people would quit for completely ridiculous reasons. Friends in different guilds, one of the officers being too talkative, didn’t like DKP, and some would straight up just get their gear for the tier and dip for a dedicated PVP server. Quality of character behind the screen matters a lot more than what’s on it imo; a few shitty specs are better than no slots or someone fucking up the fight and dipping

Yeah, but he couldn't be kited on this server either. There are a lot of references to mages and warlocks soloing East and North. I couldn't find a true source, so it remains to be seen, but it'll probably happen.
---
0.04% per point equals 0.2% with +5 skills.
---
It's super basic math.
---
I think they said in one of the blueposts that sitting to get crit doesn't proc stuff like enrage or reckoning. I think this was a common bug that worked on pservers
---
Thank you. You’re the real MVP.
---
So your 0.2% is wrong and my 0.04% is right. Thanks for doing my work for me.
---
Strongly opposed. The whole point of classic raiding is the big 40 mans
---
Still using your guide to go through 60, latest things I noticed:    
---
* In Azshara the point you put on the map for the quest arcane runes is a bit off and it took me a while to figure out where it was supposed to be exactly https://classicdb.ch/?object=149483    
---
* Typo for Morrowgrain in Buy 15 morrograin 
---
* In feralas as well, I was confused when you had the zap the giant and fuel for zapping, those are repeatable quest but not sure if you intend people to do one repeat before moving on
---
Yup. Some servers had layering that was minimal, some had maximum. Depends on which stress test and which server. The idea was to find out what the state of things looked like at each extreme to find out what the middle should be.
---
Because the mage group needs their crit aura. That’s how the Oomkin gets into raid the first time. Then they start beating some mages on the charts and show the raid leaders how useful it is to benchmark mage dps against a boomie to make roster cuts.
---
Leeway had nothing to do with client computer specs. It was because of the network limitations of 2004.
---
No, 35 minutes ago, you said 0.2% PER POINT. Then you edited your comment a minute or so ago.
---
Nope. Gives me time to gear up my twinks.
---
It all depends on how the bosses work, if they have leashes or not (i think they shouldn't if its vanilla-like)
---
Except that ceiling goes away with the compared unit having max hit as well basing stat versus stat. 
---
The variable is that the additional hit cap can be manipulated by swapping one piece of gear for superior stats. Thus the acclaimed additional DPS from the min/max.
---
People like to compare units that are not hit capped and try to exhibit this as some huge gap.  In actuality it is not as the raid gear provides the hit cap.  Basically what your actually gaining is a free armor slot that doesn't require hit to maximize a stat on it.
---
Once again, yes it's ideal to be the combo, no it will not break your DPS being something else with other benefits and purposes.  
---
As a matter of fact, if you want to do the actual math, this exact min/max in a 40 man raid accounts for about a total of .0003% of the total raid damage in variation if using about 30 DPS and each being identical with perfect gear and rotation.  That's not a fictitious number either, do the math, it's .0003% (and some change).
---
So congrats, by changing your race you still amount to jack shit difference in the raid.  Play what you want to play, if that's min/max that's fine, but no it doesn't make or break any class in content, people need to stop pushing elitist agenda.  Let people play what they want.
---
Also most boomies didn’t understand their rotation enough to know you had to downrank starfire.
---
Your superpower is getting laughed at by everyone for showing up with an Oomkin spec
---
Ok so there's a lot of misinformation in this thread that I'd like to clear up:  
---
First of all, the +5 weapon skill racials are *not necessarily* a +3% to hit chance.  Basically vanilla/classic use two different formulas for calculating your miss chance.  As a baseline, weapon and defense skills are the target's level \* 5.  Raid bosses count as level 63, so their defense skill is 315.  A level 60 player has 300 weapon skill as standard, barring any benefits such as the aforementioned racials.  
---
Now there are two formulas at play, where X is the opponent's Defense Skill and Y is the attacker's Weapon Skill.  
---
If the difference between your weapon skill and the target's defense skill is **10 or less** then the formula is:   
---
5+(X-Y)\*0.1  
---
If the difference between your weapon skill and the target's defense skill is **greater than 10** then the formula is:
---
7+(X-Y-10)\*0.4   
---
The above formula determines your "chance to miss" the target.  As you can see, up to a difference of 10 between your weapon skill and the target's defense skill isn't very punishing - each 1 difference in the opponent's favour means a 0.1% greater chance to miss.  
---
Above 10, the difference is far more punishing.  Each 1 difference in your opponent's favour means a 0.4% greater chance to miss.  
---
What this means in principle is that if you already have +5 or more weapon skill,  be it from the Rogue's "Weapon Expertise" talent, or from gear, then the benefit of the Human sword racial is +0.5% chance to hit, because the difference between your weapon skill and a raid boss' defense skill of 315 is 10 or less and the less punishing formula is being used.
---
The above formulas also mean that when you attain the threshold switching from one formula to the other, IE you reduce the difference to 10 or less, you also gain a +1% additional chance to hit.  
---
THEREFORE, for a Human Rogue who doesn't take the Weapon Expertise talent deep in the Combat tree, and has no +weapon skill from any equipped gear, stands to gain a massive 3% extra chance to hit from the sword racial.
---
Since most Rogues will take the Weapon Expertise talent deep in the Combat tree, they'll already be at +3% chance to hit.  Those 5 extra points of weapon skill their racial grants are only granting an extra +0.5% chance to hit on top of that.
---
Girlfriend ? eww
---
Pve sure I got the guide for you fam
---
Keep ice and dice up and keep evis on 5 combo points can I get a gold star now please
---
Prove me wrong
---
Troll is only for tanks. Ally human isn't bis pvp, gnome is.
---
Key of looking good in your armour as a tauren is to always turn off helm. Always!
---
Don't show helm and it looks fine to me
---
Why not have a warlock summon only the 2 duelers to a random location. Spend 5 minutes doing the 2 duels. Then have a warlock summon the next 2 duelers to a random other location. Why do they keep summoning everyone to the same location?
---
I already posted them, you just claimed they weren't sufficient even though they weren't edited or disputed throughout vanilla or pserver history:
---
&gt; Weapon skill does not affect your chance to hit other players in the battlegrounds or in the arena, but it still affects your hit chance against enemy players in world PvP or duels.
---
Yeh but they didn’t have the foresight to add them and we still end up getting only raid additions. Oh well
---
Once again, hit cap is achievable without the racial.  It's not a non navigable stat that remains arbitrarily unfulfilled.  And 1% of 3% raid damage is .0003%. Or are you incapable of that simple equation?
---
They reroll as Horde could be fun
---
If a friend want you to join the alliance, trust me, its not your friend.
---
For the Horde!
---
Check your schedule, and take away one by one everything that is mandatory, like work, dates, w/e, the time left, be it in leisure or even making food, etc, everything can be turned into gaming time by people like me who dont want to spend more than 20 minutes cooking, or dont watch tv ever. That's the time we use for gaming usually!
---
The OG vanilla players yeah, but lots of private servers grinders are probably \~17-25.
---
It's not "their face when," it's "that face when."
---
Thanks for the replay! I don't see any addons listed under 1.12 classic on curse. Were there any on this site that you would suggest for my question? Thanks!
---
Keep posting, almost....there
---
Also wendigoes.
---
Thankfully my entire friendbase is horde. Glad i dont need to make this choice! (And by choice I mean abandoning my friends to see what the Lok'tar is cookin'.)
---
No good human tank is going to sacrifice 3% hit chance for an axe or dagger. Threat is going to be incredibly important, even more so than it was on private servers due to the bosses parrying and dodging significantly more. So while hit chance doesn't prevent the bosses parry chance, it's going to be very important that the attacks that aren't parried or dodged, are actually hitting.
---
Seems to be based on dps from a 10sec rotation. It's about clipping. They favor weapons that fit perfectly between aimed shots timewise in this case. You would clip more using rhok if you cast aimed shot on cd. That said I'm pretty sure aimed shot scales off top end as does multi shot. PvP rarely allows you to play a perfect rotation so I would go rhok personally. I might have read it wrong but that's how I took it.
---
not just a part
---
no shit. layering itself is antithesis to what made WoW, WoW. One single world.
---
Layers shouldn't be hoppable. You should have to pick your layer upon picking server, and then you're locked to it until the full server layer merging. THAT is one single seemless world
---
You can go enchanting to sell the mats?
---
You could be like me and put your entire life on hold for 2 months so you can play wow 16 hours a day
---
.... idiots?
---
Look at this man. This isn't vanilla wow. This is Bfa with extra steps.
---
Im 36, married house career however I rarely work more than 40 hours a week and can work from home as much as I want, meaning I can play when my work is on the low. Key to me being able to game a lot is I told my wife the day we met Im a gamer always will be. Dont wanna hear it later down the line. Eventually i know why i wanted to marry her cause she accepts my hobby even tho she dont understand it sometimes. Make sure to play 8 hours SOME days and not all days. Find a middleground.
---
yup I think it'll be nice
---
2 hours a day is more than enough to clear these raids and be fully prepared for them. Sure most guild will want to have at least 3 hour blocks of time to raid while content is still going down more slowly, but assuming his schedule has a bit of flexibility he’ll be ok.
---
Are you a big PvP'er though? Only wondering because I played on PvP servers up until WotLK and I had no specific reason to other than it was just what I was used to. I was always a very casual PvP'er, and when I made the switch, it was mind-blowing how comfortable everything was.
---
I only stress the point because this time, there won't be BG's for a while. The hardcore PvP'ers are going to be out in the world all the time hunting other players as their form of entertainment. Great for people who absolutely enjoy world PvP all day, but not great for players who only play on PvP servers because they think it's the normal thing to do. They just end up complaining in guild chat all day about being camped, even though it's part of the PvP server life.
---
We should at the very least be able to skin half of a centaur
---
&gt; Do you have any reason to believe the technology works like that?
---
What technology? They had per location phasing since Wrath, there is no reason sharding can't used per zone.
---
Server merging can obviously be harder, a lot harder, since they would need to create a solution for conflicting names.
---
My friends have become so split that i do not even think i want to play at this point :/
---
Well that's fine because I don't think anyone can understand your comment anyway.
---
Trash mobs in retail raids don't really have the same meaning as they do in vanilla. It's why you see M+ runs with comps that deal with both bosses and trash mobs in ideal ways, it's because they actually matter in dungeons. In vanilla, you can have things like the trash mobs between Twin Emperors and C'Thun be more dangerous than other bosses inside the same raid, and trash mobs in vanilla tend to drop more loot than in retail so they're also important for the group overall.
---
PServer players who are notorious for being assholes being assholes. 
---
Well colour me ever so surprised.
---
Plus a cool tabard and dark edge of insanity
---
yeah  I made that shit up
---
I didn't say Blizzard ruined the event, I said they should have teleported the participants so the griefers wouldn't ruin the event, these events if gone right could have given Classic a lot of visibility, which all of us would benefit of, but those griefers are doing nothing but ruining a cool community event, wasn't Classic about having a good and friendly community? Becouse what these idiots are doing is giving Classic a toxic visibility
---
90% is hearing tips type and say barely anything
---
It's so weird to watch this stuff unfold and think that it's actually still possible pservers have a better Classic experience than actual Classic. 
---
The fabric of wow is immersion and layering rips it apart.
---
And finally, for PvP, vs a player who didn't take some kind of +defense talent, your miss chance is 5% and there won't be glancing blows, so each +1 weapon skill is only +0.1% chance to hit  (so 0.5% basically for the racial)
---
That's such a small increase it's basically insignificant.
---
Ok, let me put this as clearly as I can.
---
In order to achieve hitcap without the orc or human racial you need 3% additional hit from gear. This gear has to come from SOMEWHERE, and using this gear means you need to replace gear that would otherwise have provided either crit, raw stats, or some other attribute to boost your damage.
---
You will also need to use some kind of gear with weapon skill to reduce the glancing penalty which also has to replace some other piece with either hit, crit or raw stats.
---
So again, can you demonstrate that not having to get 3% hit and +5 weapon skill on your gear lead to negligible dps loss? Ofcourse you cannot. Thats why you just try to insult me instead. 3% hit is HUGE in Vanilla when you consider how gear is actually itemized. Especially for a Fury Warrior this 3% hit is an absolutely huge difference as you can drop items like Accuria f.ex and instead use other rings that provide a much bigger benefit.
---
I think the only surefire way to prevent griefing is find a choke point in a contested zone and have mages from both factions spam blizzard on the chokepoint for hours.
---
We'll see about that..
---
it doesn't do nothing, it adds 0.5% chance to hit.  Nothing special but still not nothing.
---
I have a good few others that are between the 20-50 range but just picked a few
---
Rationalize it anyway you want but nothing will change the fact. L
---
Of course we'll see old orgrimmar. When we conquer it.
---
Cause they already made some of the worst decisions/mistakes a person could make. Who knows the loose cannon decisions they will make. I’m serious.
---
And if everyone in the raid also puts in top tier effort you're back at the bottom with rets
---
My thought is that with 3/5 blackout, I have a 6% chance on every tick of flay and sw:p to stun which will also give me extra damage and time before the mob reaches me. Even more with 5/5 haha so still not sure
---
A warlock would be a very strong choice for someone who may not have as much time to min/max as other players. Just about every guild I've raided with on both private realms and wow up until Cata, we were always very light on warlocks in the roster. Also, they're a very efficient leveling class. Additionally, you have a lot of options for instance solo farming as a warlock.
---
I have made a device to pause time (other than me and my in-game character)
---
Would work well if they came back with Member Berries
---
Haha, nope, not happening to me, luckily! I have no friends! I can roll whatever I want! Ha HAH.. ha..
---
Love the Shaman
---
Mature language filter goes on that list
---
A day has 24 hours.  If you can't figure out how people manage to use 8 of those hours for a game, maybe you should work less, dump your GF and go back to school for some basic arithmetic.
---
These guys are in the area a huge pvp tournament is happening, but the're on a different layer. The mound they are standing in is generally where all the spectators stand to watch the fights.
---
Hunters are usually not the most played, I wouldn't be worried
---
There was a hunter with this who made a pvp video back in vanilla.
---
Been wondering how I'll manage without the function row :D
---
Get that twitch chat bullshit out of here
---
There were literally 6 level 60 druids on my server. 1 was feral. It was bad. I couldn't even remember *how* bad until looking back over patch notes. 
---
Someone else mentioned it, but got the numbers wrong. Instead of 360% armor modifier for dire bear, it was 125%. 
---
Agi didn't give attack power. Leather stats for druids were a complete joke, even for healing. Resto had to roll on cloth (and that did not make anyone happy)
---
Only animals and humanoids bled. (no rip/rake)
---
Ferocious bite didn't even exist for the first 5 months.
---
Everything cat needed buffing, and still wasn't that good. You basically just clawed things. Balance was such a joke it's not worth mentioning. 
---
For someone who leveled druid to 60 in vanilla without knowing any better, the way people talk about how amazing feral leveling will be is ... I can't even imagine how different it'll be. It won't *quite* be a brand new game, but it would be so different from the Vanilla WoW I played that it wouldn't actually pop any nostalgia for me. Plus patch 1.12 itemization is...I mean, consider going from not being able to do *any* damage to having Tier 3 Right after stepping into a 60 dungeon.
---
I mean it's basically a question.
---
Do you want windfury so you can do crazy DPS?
---
Or do you want blessing of salvation so you can actually do a full rotation?
---
I work about 4 hours a week and volunteer the rest of my time, but it's summer right now so the things I usually volunteer for aren't a priority.
---
My plan is to go hard for a week for the week-one/WF Rag kill and then slow way down. There won't be enough to do to warrant 8+ hours a day (I have no interest in anything beyond rank 3 PVP). I want a couple alts to 60 and geared before AQ hits, but other than that, it's just a few hours a week to clear all raid content.
---
Girlfriend will be on a vacation with her family that I put together and all my clients know I'll be 100% unreachable until Sept 4th.
---
Immersion? Who wants *that*?
---
You're consistently downvoted because of how wrong and ill informed on the subject you are, not because you're right. Seeing your name pop up all over this thread paints you as the angry one also, irony
---
Please explain how playing on a pve server would prevent them from doing the exact thing they are doing now.
---
&gt; personal attacks
---
No.
---
But yours
---
&gt; full autism
---
&gt; unpleasant asshole
---
So yeah
---
&gt; Have a nice day though.
---
You too.
---
1 weapon skill only increases hit chance by 0.1% if the difference is 10 or less between your weapon skill and your target's defense skill.
---
no it adds 0.05 per skill which is 0.2% hit, and if you aren't hit capped doing pvp you are doing something terribly wrong
---
It's definitely a little harder on the healers, but druids can tank almost everything. Warriors are for sure the better option in late game, but if a raid leader/main tank really wanted to run as feral he could absolutely make it work. People did this even in vanilla.
---
Typically though the RL/MT is a warrior, and there's one or two feral druids in raid that can put out upper-middle dps and top level off-tanking with only a gear swap.
---
I get that you are following my post history to get angry at me, but you really should read the replies before responding. Some servers had minimal characters per layer as part of testing layering. Please follow the conversation. Per the rules on the side: please stop attempting to gate-keep discussion.
---
You are doing whatever you can to justify you're immense rage, but do remember that layering will be going live August 26th when Classic launches. I can't wait, I will actually be able to play!
---
3% spell crit buff to raid from boomkin form. And by being friendly with your guild

You can heal plenty downranked to rank 2 and 3. Certainly in easier raids or 5 man’s.

I think it was common for rankers to camp fight paths for people landing before BGs were released
---
Layering will probably last months.  Insane queues would last a week tops.
---
maturity  
---
organization  
---
leadership  
---
these 3 are the reason I often go for somewhat hardcore guilds, despite being quite casual myself.  In those guilds I can perform at the level that is expected from me, but only for a few months, say 4-6 months, after that I usually step down from raider to rank 'social'   But that season is enough for me to get my 'raiding fix'  and gather an decent set of gear.
---
Disenchanting for profit will typically only work on a server with a mature economy.  There is no market early on, so you make very little and in some cases negative gold by disenchanting while everyone is saving for mount money.
---
It's NOT 0.04% hit per point, not against a player, it's 0.1% per point.  It also has no effect on crit whatsoever.  There's a baseline 5% crit chance + any additional from talents, gear and so on.  Please see my post above, it's hugely detailed.
---
Was this confirmed during the AV test?  I’ve been paying a lot less attention lately, so that’s good news if this is the case and will make me consider playing a Druid some more.
---
Thanks!!
---
Since people are giving you joke answers, here’s a real one:
---
Roll a mage/lock. Start a guild. Be well organized and professional so that you can recruit great players. Carefully pick great officers who will be drama free and loyal (not in a subservient sense, but committed to your guild). Raid consistently for a year while keeping attrition low. Be a good leader and and even better player so that people like you and think you deserve it. Farm naxx. Get staff.
---
Was leeway a thing in private servers? Or did they take that out?
---
Rating is based on percentage performance. So being top 5 on honor isn't good enough on a low pop realm, and on a super low pop realm it won't even be possible to get rank14. You want a server with as low pvp competition as possible compared to its server pop. So a really casual server essentially.
---
If you're not picking the head gear and horns to maximize the amount of horns your character can have, then what are you doing, truly?
---
You were in a shitty guild, tho.
---
It's also hugely wrong and provides no sources.
---
Ah yeah, I forgot about the talent rework - that was by far the biggest improvement.
---
&gt; I get that you are following my post history to get angry at me
---
Guess again, I'm simply reading comments in this thread.
---
&gt; please stop attempting to gate-keep discussion
---
lol saying this after telling me to read before commenting. Pure satire
---
&gt; You are doing whatever you can to justify you're immense rage
---
You're the only one mad here champ
---
&gt; I can't wait, I will actually be able to play!
---
And you'll quit in 3 weeks because everything isn't as easy as retail, if you support layering this hard you obviously never played when vanilla was current.
---
Are you high?
---
If there are multiple herbalists/miners you would typically roll.  If there is like a rich thorium at the end of DM east and you are the only miner, that is your mine.
---
&gt; Please see my detailed post in this thread.
---
Yes, a post that is wrong and provides no sources.
---
i don't even know how that retailnoob got famous. he has no clue at all about vanilla, he's not particularly funny nor in any way likeable.
---
This is based on what others have reported in the beta and the experience of private server players. 
---
However, doing a comparision of private server to beta there seems to be a greater regen rate given from spirit making it better. 
---
I presume you know that weapon dps is king. A staff with 11 int and 54 dps beats out an axe with 11 str and 50 dps. 
---
There are guides out there that might explain it better than i can. Like i know kargoz has a pretty indepth guide. Skarm talls about stats a fair bit too.
---
The crit/agi is just a better stat for warriors early game. Look up what it gives and you will see
---
The crit part is hard to explain. I can see why you think its not as good as raw dmg but crits reduce kill times. This one id need more time to write it up why its better.
---
Im not sure 100% of the actual math on spirit. I know there are some good calculation on spirit in relation to mana.
---
Blizzard mocking us again
---
It heals for plenty for the easier content. With mediocre blues you can get a rank 2 to around 350 heals. Rank 3 probably 550. Again, for basically no mana. You can just lay on the button. 
---
With whatever that one idol or whatever is, which lowers HT cast time by .25, it’s even better. Then you just sit on rank 3. A 1.7 second cast for almost no mana that heals for 500+ with a rejuv ticking is entirely sufficient for a great deal of content.
---
[I mean, ok.](https://jrlburke.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/could-should.jpg)
---
2.0's all the more reason to choose Regrowth, though.
---
Good friends!
---
Shhh can’t say anything bad about classic, that means you hate the game and don’t want it to be improved!!
---
It’s beyond me why they didn’t design it like this.
---
Or mage, save on that travel time with portals
---
[citation needed]
---
You're claiming formulas and rules that go against every source of data we have.
---
the issue is that warrior didn't get the hybrid treatment and everything is balanced around Warriors for optimal play, its dumb
---
Organized pvp hunters remain viable, as while there damage may be lower it is harder to avoid then rogue and warrior.  The utility of a hunter, entrapment/viper/etc is also not an issue of scaling.  Also hunter has a passive stam modifier talent, so their survival actually scales up faster then many classes.
---
If your mate is skinning then either don't level a second or go engineering. There's a couple of rewards for going engineering early. For horde there's a quest in ashenvale where you need an engi item to complete it, this can net you a fair bit of money early on if you level fast and craft them.  for alliance there's a similar quest in duskwood although that item can be bought from vendors(but it will be sold out really quickly on launch)

&lt;**Morning After**&gt; | **Alliance** | **NA** | **PvP Server** | **Semi-Hardcore**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**About us**: In early 2006 during the last era of Classic World of Warcraft a close group of officers left their end-game raiding guilds to form the core of Morning After. The goal was to fill a hole that was missing from end-game 40-man raiding, it wasn’t accessible to your average player. Many of the requirements to join end-game guilds were out of reach to your average player both from a skill as well as a time perspective.
---
Morning After focused on finding members not based on their current gear score or guild history but instead on finding members who were fast learners and who could listen carefully. Five days later Morning After downed Onyxia with a rag-tag group of players, mostly comprised of members who had never seen the encounter, and quickly progressed through content. One month later Morning After downed the eldest son of Deathwing, the black dragon Nefarian, on the fiery ramparts of Blackwing Lair above Blackrock Spire.
---
Morning After brings experience to the table. Since 2004 our officers have not only beat all classic 40-man raid encounters but have also lead a group of unseasoned players to the glorious end as well.
---
We are looking for players who can dedicate two nights a week to pushing through raid content. Players who learn quickly and come prepared to maximize our efforts with a shorter raid schedule.
---
Join us, we have a lot to get done. 
---
***“And from the ashes arose something new. Something brighter and full of spirit. With the breaking of dawn a new day was laid before, it was the Morning After.”***
---
**Raid Times**: 2 days a week (the exact days are being decided). Right now Tuesday / Wednesday evenings 6pm PST - 9pm PST are leading the vote! Note, we won't be raiding on weekends as we have family / old people RL obligations.
---
**Loot System**: EPGP or equivalent. This may vary depending on add-on availability on release, however we feel EPGP is the fairest system around.
---
**Recruitment**: Currently all spots are open, although DPS classes will fill out quicker.
---
**Application to Join**: Applications are open via our guilded.cc page. [You can find it here](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnWloDno6E?i=lAenOqP4).
---
**Additional Info**: All of Morning Afters leadership have been playing since release, Nov 2004. We are an "older" group of gamers (so we are told), our average age being 40. We are ok with all ages over 18, however you should be a mature player and ok with profanities being thrown around like a plastic bag in a thunderstorm. We won't tolerate racism and try our hardest to not discuss politics or religion, but this isn't strictly enforced. Also, don't worry about gear or knowledge of strats. We have built Morning After in a way where we train less experienced players to take down end game content, this is totally fine. If you can learn, you can play with Morning After.
---
**Additional fun fact**: Your guild leader (me) is the famous Ashmai of Nath, who wrote the old World of Warcraft songs "Purple Monster (The Druid Song)", "The Priest Song", and "Blizzards Ballad". Be prepared for live guitar WoW songs during raiding operations to boost moral.
---
I don't get how people can even defend this shit. Do you play retail? Because if you don't, try it how sharding (oh sorry layering) works in action. Especially world pvp is absolutely amazing, not gonna lie. People who are losing the fight are disappearing into the other shards when the join the WQ group. Truly amazing WPvP experience. And don't forget about rares, NPCs disappearing into the other shard in front of you.
---
Apparently everyone who has ever played on a private server is the literal devil, and everyone else has never so much as hurt a fly.
---
This guy is living in 3019
---
If we broke the nochanges rule for this I’d be very ok with it
---
I have edited it. 
---
Just left the note about queenslanders as they are still weird.
---
You are expecting a criminal construction fraud to learn? It’s not a community event to him, it’s another step in his get famous plan.
---
Totally would if it meant beta access.
---
I did this with a gnomes only guild, let's say it was interesting to play without healers...   5 man dungeons were fine, and I think we did UBRS (but with 15 people)  , but no bigger raids.
---
Yea, but then you are kind of saying a PvP server is even BETTER for a tournament?
---
My comment was aimed at you writing:
---
&gt; If you roll a PvP server then cry over people PvPing you
---
and I disagree with that, hence my point that they could have done exactly the same thing on a PvE server. So this is not a PvP issue, it's a griefing issue!
---
Blizzard already broke that rule, time to start the petition to skin centaurs legs
---
Yes it is
---
It did look like a joke.
---
I probably wouldn't recommend it. There's not that many good ele pieces in dungeons, although with a bit of patience you can get r6-8 pvp gear to wear instead.
---
Though I would really urge you to consider heal in raids as elemental specs. It's not uncommon for guilds to allow a shaman to be elemental since it doesn't impact healing all that much.
---
Only if the rest of the raid isn't also putting the effort into farming consumables and isn't as equally skilled and knowledgable about their class.
---
Put any tryhard in a raid full of casuals and their going to perform well, but that doesn't make their choice to play a sub-par class using a sub-par spec any better.
---
[No. It's. Not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYR9Gh1T0QM)
---
People are going to learn very fast how difficult it is to keep 40 raiders happy in a loot council guild. DKP at least gives players the illusion they are earning something even when an item they want drops and they don't win it.
---
Best loot system is as follows:
---
- DKP
---
- All items start with a min bid to offset inflation further
---
- 10% weekly decay
---
- 25% phase decay
---
- Certain items reserved for X class with a min bid. this is needed to save people from themselves and keep Hunters from bidding on Thunderfury. The min bid also ensures you don't see certain classes getting items for ultra cheap and skewing the DKP
---
All systems have flaws, but this system will ensure the longevity of your guild regardless of whatever cliques or drama pop up.
---
Sick! Thank you!
---
It means all healing received.
---
Sorry, got other convos going and you're the only one not getting past the premise stage... Probably explained it better to the others, no hard feelings, just don't have the time.
---
Private discord -&gt; queue a wsg as 10 against each other. Voila, unlimited time in private zone.
---
No. The fact that you had to have 40\~ people was part of the challenge. Changing that would trivialize a lot of the content.
---
You mean the side that can give 30% reduced threat to all it's dpsers and can make the majority of content trivial ? I think you're confused about which side is the one with crutches friend :)
---
A game does objectively still exist, but not the classic that we've been wanting and that Blizzard claimed to be making.
---
Have you watched the tourney from the start? There is no pvp going on, they are just standing on the people dueling just to ruin it. Not to pvp or anything like that at all.
---
Why are you so upset about pixels Mr. Boomer? Twitch emotes or not, this doesn't change the fact that Druids are not top 5 DPS contenders.
---
Sometimes you have to make choices.
---
You can always get another girlfriend once you have all of your raid gear.
---
Healing received, and reduces all kind of healing. Spells, healthstone, potion, bandage.
---
It's works like mortal strike, just much weaker.
---
Most vocal doesn't necessarily mean a majority. It seems that It hardly ever works that way.
---
So let me get this straight... The problem is that there is a strategy to spending your points correctly to earn the pieces you want rather than  to simply dump everything at every piece that drops?  
---
All of the "problems" of dkp do away if you isolate it by tier of content.
---
Commented on youtube as well, but this is legit.  Keep'm coming man, these are exactly what they need to be!!
---
Work the night shift - Play at work. That's what I'll be doing.
---
I started playing vanilla shortly after launch, including completing all of Naxx long before TBC launched. It's almost like you feel the need to generalize me to support your view. 
---
I have actually used meeting stones and dungeon finder as good examples of improvements to systems that have the invisible consequence of causing the game to lose its community. The idea of server communities is mostly what people are nostalgic about classic for, since, as I just mentioned, there are systems on retail that have been objectively improved on from a mechanical standpoint. 
---
I asked you to stop attacking me because it is derailing the conversation (and yet you keep generalizing me and putting words in my mouth). Please review the side rules, thanks!
---
inb4 some very smart boi comes and explains how layering is totally different from sharding and also how its needed to combat queues yadda yadda.
---
I haven’t played WoW in years, do I have to buy the game again to play classic or do I just start paying the $15/month?
---
Unpopular opinion. But T2,5 looks good for most lasses out there. I just don't think many sets fit taurens.
---
Get new friends
---
&gt;They want a much smaller amount (not specified i believe atm) of realms and they want them to be healthy, layering helps solve that as theyre able to stack many times a regular realms pop ontop of eachother.
---
What they want is an easy solution where they don't have to do a lot of work.
---
The best solution for quality/integrity is many, many realms (likely clusters).
---
The best solution for Blizzard is layering.
---
Also, they had 1.5 million people in 2005.  That's not nothing.  You act like vanilla release was this easy experience where they were perfectly prepared.  It was the opposite.  It was more people than they imagined and *the game was fine* in the long run.
---
You puny humans
---
Why regret it when you can just go back and grab the quest?
---
I miss the days of playing WoW and dueling outside of Org. Haven't played the game in 8 years and it's still in my thoughts daily and miss it so much still.
---
Really? That fuckin late into the game? 😂 It was still used on other healers though, yeah?
---
Just the monthly sub. All xpacs except BFA only require sub.
---
Giving streamers privileges is exactly what Blizzard want, that's the reason pretty much all the known streamers . Streamers move masses of people, every viewer the streamers have is a potential player new player on release, and as you know that is something both we, the players, and Blizzard, want, not only for Classic, but for  it's future ( potential TBC and WOTLK servers if Classic succeed). So if these potential players see that a CLOSED BETA is having issues with toxic players, the first thing they would do is avoiding this game as they will not want to experience this behaviour if they end up playing. So yes, Blizz should have totally done something about APES.
---
&gt;  It's almost like you feel the need to generalize me to support your view. 
---
No, it's just the only thing that makes sense unless I want to question your intelligence. 
---
&gt; he idea of server communities is mostly what people are nostalgic about classic for
---
And yet you think layering is a good thing...
---
&gt; there are systems on retail that have been objectively improved on from a mechanical standpoint. 
---
It's also easy to see how phasing/sharding/layering tech has destroyed the community. So this is a terrible hill for you to die on considering the facts.
---
&gt; I asked you to stop attacking me 
---
Disagreeing with you isn't attacking you. Get up out of your big boy chair and learn what a discussion is.
---
I’d guess maybe reputation
---
you are missing a bunch of stuff fyi.
---
Love the website, I wish there was a way to get this imported into Questie/pfQuest.
---
Do we know what time it releases precisely on the 26th?
---
Loot priority: GM girlfriend =&gt; GM =&gt; officers =&gt; disenchant =&gt; raiders
---
I would like to take this moment to talk to everyone here about faction balance.
---
According to some of the data from classic beta : [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?maxLevel=40&amp;minLevel=20&amp;realm=4619\_Classic%20Beta%20PvP&amp;realm=4618\_Classic%20Beta%20PvE](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?maxLevel=40&amp;minLevel=20&amp;realm=4619_Classic%20Beta%20PvP&amp;realm=4618_Classic%20Beta%20PvE) .
---
There seems to be a much bigger alliance audience, for the sake of epic faction battles, fun wpvp encounters and low BG queues,I strongly urge anyone who is still considering which faction to play on to roll horde, faction balance is very important , the last thing anyone would want is completely one-sided battles, that's just no fun for anyone.
---
That’s easily solvable.
---
The server list will consist of server names and have a drop down of “sub” servers aka layers. Ie - server name is Arthas? Arthas 1, Arthas 2 and etc for the layers. These layers can all have characters created on them, but those characters won’t be able to interact with other characters on a different layer. At all. Guilds/friends would have to coordinate which layer they want to start on.
---
The server will generate another layer when a certain amount of players have created accounts... let’s says every 3500 - 4000 players.
---
This system ensures that of a layer is lacking population, it can just be merged into the bigger layer. Arthas 4 low pop ? Merge into Arthas 1. All those toons and data are now a part of the Arthas 1 layer.
---
This type of system involves a lot more programming and cost to design than taking sharding, expanding its scope to continents, and calling it “layering”. I suspect blizzard just took the easy and cheap route and that’s why there are many issues right now.
---
That is not entirely true. You could have a small amount of layers per server initially. When every initial layer is full, servers just dynamically spawn new ones. Could even allow for party registration to ensure that RL friends end up in the same layer.
---
They don't have full time jobs or very active social lives. Or they're children.
---
Boom this is exactly the type of stuff I was looking for. Thank you!
---
I mean, you can play with your friend if you ask him in advance what layer he made his character on. If he made it on a server that’s full, then you both would have to make characters on another server..... which is EXACTLY how it works right now...
---
If your friend is making characters on a full pop server he’s either dumb or isn’t really your friend.
---
Choosing a class from a lvl 40 duel tourny is dumb, but choosing it from a lvl 30 duel tourny is galaxy brain.
---
Sounds nightmarish. At that point I might as well get my wife a boyfriend, too.
---
I think people shit on him because he’s a fraud and a thief, and they don’t really like that.
---
I think you’re underestimating the amount of time it will take for the game to die down. Even years after vanilla launched queues were the norm on weekends that could last for hours.
---
I'm not saying that a low pop server has to be bad to rank on, but they are not necccesarily good either. So if you are going to give advice on what server to rank on, advice what actually benefits ranking, instead of some random realm that may or may not be good.
---
I vote no layering whatsoever, from day one til they shut the servers down.
---
If they absolutely insist on it, then it should last no longer than 1 week.
---
If they keep it in for more than 2 weeks I would just leave. I am paying for classic, not layered bullshit version of classic.
---
I dropped Warcraft after Cataclysm, came back for Legion and after a month of that I was like "never again". If they fuck up classic with this "new Blizzard" way of thinking I will leave again and never return.
---
I have read all the arguments from both sides for weeks now and the reasons for it all far way short and violate the "no changes" rule at its very core.
---
&gt;pservers have a better Classic experience than actual Classic
---
It's looking to be that way.
---
The layering and artificial lag looks awful.
---
well, this(yours) solution is already better than everything proposed above and below
---
It isn't problemless though, as grouping with friends becomes problematic and what OP complains still holds true "you just wanted to spectate the biggest community event on Beta, but their layer was full"
---
You're just arguing semantics.
---
+5 Accuracy to axes doesn't mean shit, the orc racial literally prevents 50% of any healing. Orc's don't make the greatest tanks, why talk if you;'er clueless?
---
lol the fuck did I just read? So people, myself included, wanted to have kids because the wanted a family so they had kids.
---
I agree with the sentiment, and I want it to be that way too, but the reality is that vanilla content is going to be pretty easy. The biggest difference is that 15 years ago, people played on worse connections, worse computers, and didn't have the 15 years of gaming experience. 
---
I am still hoping that there will be some dungeons and scenarios where we will have to play smarter, looking at you last room of UBRS.
---
The difference between layering and sharding is that sharding dynamically adjusts the population on the shard (maintains a constant value) while layering sets a capacity to the population on the layer (sets a maximum value).
---
Layering is superior because you will be playing with the same people and won’t see people phasing out all over the place like in retail.
---
You think you will be wearing plate in raids?
---
I've been playing a lot of retail WoW recently and I can see how phasing is needed. When implemented correctly zones feel just right, enough people for it to not feel empty, but not too much that it feels to crowded. But of course this kills the community feel of the game. Hell, I was just playing last night and some dude said he would enchant my weapon for free. "Fuck yea enchant me daddy" is what I thought and he ran out to my position. We opened a trade window and turns out we couldn't do it because we were on different realms. I could've had a nice enchant-bro buddy but nope, the phasing system said fuck you. :/
---
It is like you are playing a mini MMO where you have the chance of grouping up with someone you will never see again.
---
Of course the proper solution is to just design the game so that players have the incentive to go to other zones when one zone feels too crowded.
---
That's basically a nice way of saying "first and last, buddy". I mean, not sure if you can read between the lines?
---
Dude I understand you are attempting to discuss without actually understanding how copyright and intellectual property works, I am not here to convince you of anything other than your own ignorance.
---
If you think blizzard would not have already shut down multiple servers that are home to MILLIONS of free players, just because "Not a threat to retail" then you are being willfully naive and downright silly.
---
They have an amazing legal team, that does all this research and files all these injunctions daily..... and the servers are still alive. Not because "Blizzard lets them", but because there is no legal avenue to attack them and blizzard would not chance their reputation in using less than ethical ways of attack.
---
So stop trying to continue this discussion, where you are telling me operational facts about blizzard that have been known for years.
---
huh.  that doesn't belong to me
---
Classic is not a dueling tournament- rolling because of one is a little short-sighted.
---
Hunters are useful throughout raids, even without counting tranq shot utility. Most trash pulls are done by hunters and some of the more dangerous trash packs are kited by hunters.
---
Funny because I did it many times after. Not bannable.
---
Is there any reason to give it to a warlock over a mage? I would like it but it seems like it would always make sense to give it to a mage
---
I have been saying this the whole time. Why don't we just move to a classic pserver lmao?
---
Same, I love hunter but every stress test has been overflowing with them, so Ive decided to go priest which is my second love and alt a hunter down the road. good luck to you!
---
I respect the fact these tournaments exist, not the people behind them though.
---
Warlocks don't wear armour, they wear robes.
---
I know from personal experience at datacenters the amount of processing power likely required to have several hundred thousand active users on the server side. 
---
It's completely possible to do and it's just a question of if blizzard wants to pay for the power it would take to pull it off.
---
But then the user end... well frankly I'd rather have 10fps and a thousand players on my screen than a shard or a layer hiding part of the world from me. 
---
This is likely the limit blizzard is scaling against.
---
Ok so playing Vanilla is the right way in your opinion is to rush all content?
---
Yesterday I dreamt I played classic. I was so happy.
---
Not even a joke....
---
I agree it isn't as good in battlegrounds, but it has made the difference in me getting a flag back.
---
I generally switch it and mc cap. And a tier helm if neither are up. 
---
Either way, it is still a big advantage to have engineering in pvp. I regularly use rocket helm and mc cap when they are up. I always have either a shadow reflector or an ice reflector on. And I always have a backpack filled with iron grenades.
---
absolutely nothing should carry over from beta to classic
---
It’s not possible. All my original chars are EU and I moved to Aus and had to restart.
---
Why would you think your Classic WoW tauren would ever look like a tauren from Cata? Weird meme is weird.
---
But waaaah people might have a rough time leveling on launch day because that's the only time anyone has to play forever
---
So your opinion is that unless you rush all content you are doing it wrong? Meanwhile, here you are asking for extra content while I have things to explore. Are you sure you are doing it right?
---
Curious how sm ruin locks add survivability ?
---
Lol?
---
This is pretty cool, have to bookmark it for launch!
---
Because that really doesn't solve the problem. All you are effectively doing is creating more servers.
---
I say that this "problem" really isn't a problem at all. Just let servers and starting areas get overpopulated, fuck it. If the player cant stand the wait times or all the people on the server then just let them move to another one. It'll be a clusterfuck on day one, but I'll take that clusterfuck over killing the classic feel with layering.
---
Good, good. Now, how do we get the horde to duel each other? :thinking: :thinking:
---
[I agree with OP](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/antagonists/images/f/f2/D9249a0ca874c3c3b6641814d40fe87764568388_hq.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181109210945)
---
No they are not, even with MCPs.
---
2 days later one more friend of us wants to join our party - time to recreate all our characters. Our names are already taken, and we all have to do it in the same time period
---
It is not how it is working currently. You can create characters on even "Full" servers. You will be warned, but that's it.
---
Same here. For me to actually enjoy gaming I need to have all these things in order. Like, I always prioritise social events, job related tasks and workout routines and ofc sleep. Then I can kick back and relax with some gaming (as an alternative to Netflix). But then I for sure don’t have 8 hours left of the day.
---
Correct, what I am saying though, is that a system would be better off giving leeway to a class/characters if LITERALLY NOTHING THEY CAN BID ON DROPS.
---
This is quite possible for a couple weeks in a row, not to mention that you dont even get 40 items a week, so even if drops are perfect someone will have lost DKP to decay before they can spend it if it decays every week. Doubly so fo classis which have prioritized items, like warriors, where all DPS items are prioritized to Tanks because they have it for overall faid DPsS (Increased Threat).
---
Must have been hard being teased in bc in underbog then, what with the  broken hunter having tamed a druid in bear form.
---
That I agree upon
---
It’s about priority as ppl say. I could play for 8 hours a week all through my 20ies and most of my 30ies. I am now in my 40ies and I must admit I would be hard pressed to play 8 hours per day. Simply because I am not young anymore.  Not that I have time for it either with kids and everything. I am quite the opposite of a workaholic. I have basically been trying to fake work for my entire career;) always trying to arrive late and go home early for work.
---
NEET?
---
Bfa subs were leaked awhile back, its doing downright awful. 1.7 million subs at the time, and less people are actually playing it now. Obviously not an official number, but its the only one we got. 
---
Several other MMOs are doing quite a bit better. Not following the sub model, but more profitable too.
---
Deciding anything because of a fueling tournament that will likely NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN..is dumb asf
---
Maybe, here's a concept.. Just *maybe*.... Try not being a whore for only BiS gear and accept that you can't have perfect gear?
---
If you keep chasing those numbers in a guild of 40 other people doing the same thing, you're gonna be in for a world of disappointment.
---
I don’t understand how it’s pedantic. We were discussing whether they have a flash. They do if they downrank. Regrowth isn’t a flash and you saying regrowth would be better to cast isn’t true. And I explained why. It was literally the conversation we were having.
---
I do the blades bidding
---
Jeez you sound like a fuckwit when you start a response with "honey please".
---
Layering won't affect how many people are on a server, you just might only see a portion of them if your server is crowded. 
---
They haven't released any server info. You won't really know what server stats look like for months. If you server's faction doesn't have a lot of guilds with MC cleared after a month, you might be on a poor server.
---
I never played ona  private server for a significant period of time and I am definitely going to roll on a PvE server. PvP server = gank city. I like PvP but I most definitely prefer the voluntary PvP that only occurred on PvE servers.
---
Pvp happens on a PvP server? Imagine being entitled enough that though actually think you should be immune to pvp on a PvP server.
---
I don't see you refuting any of my points. If all you can do is insult me, then I'd say you lost this argument kiddo. Cheers!
---
[FTFY!](https://imgur.com/w0TENXh)
---
Layers lmao
---
I suicide for it. There isn't a lot of good healer Armor in phase 1 anyways and depending on how the internal cooldown works, T1 pally is good on Loatheb. More to your point, we are happy to DE inferior pieces of gear - people will suicide for BiS.
---
Well, if you’re me then I’m already level 30 after two days. So yeah, starting from scratch would be the best option.
---
On another note, the cap doesn’t have to be a hard cap. Could be a soft cap with a 100-200 variance to accommodate situations like you’re describing. There eventually has to be a hard cap though. You can’t have a functioning vanilla server EXACTLY like it was in the past with 10k players running around.
---
Oh I understand. If I had 2 weapons that we're relatively equal, I'd run crusader and weapon chain to do this. But I'm just saying swapping to have a chance at crusader is much less impactful in a fight than 3 sec disorient that isn't broken by damage.
---
Ofc not but it's true frost mages are so op late game they can 1v3 if they know what they're doing. Mages and rogues are the 2 masterclasses for worldpvp at 60 imo.
---
warrior plays differently at high levels of gear vs low. Especially in PvP. Same with Pally. Mage does too.
---
What??? 
---
phase 2 is when the merger would happen right? As planned like with layering. Possibly before then.
---
Most players wont be 60. 
---
The prices might be out of whack for the first few weeks but eventually will settle back to a normal value. 
---
It might be higher pop realms have a larger number of high levels but im pretty sure the level 60 to low level ratio will be similar across across all realms. 
---
We are talking about realms that will be merged. People will know this aswell and play accordingly. 
---
Queues are not the enemy. Its just an inconvience. 
---
Faction imbalance will be there no matter what. Say server 1 has an 80% alliance and server 2 has 80% horde. You will just equal it out. 
---
Faction imbalance is an entirely different issue and can be helped with less realms.. 
---
I still feel its the best option the only thing you mentioned is the economy stuff and that doesnt seem that major, long term, and will fix in a week or two when the merchers fix prices. 
---
People will play on the lower pops for the start to get ahead with leveling. Whole guilds will have 50 man rosters etc on these realms. 
---
I feel like you are being very grumpy at someone being "wrong" on the internet. But i feel my points are just as valid as yours and help with fixing abusable systems.
---
Except for AB though. Horde always smashed AB, at least on my server.
---
on what layer?
---
Yeah supposedly way less downtime with spirit gear to the point rogues are not drinking at all.
---
Paladin can do damage when leveling
---
You've just parroted what most have already said there, bucko.
---
Thats what they did and the tournament is taking forever to finish
---
You use whatever weapon is best. Leveling the skill doesn't take long at all.
---
Yes same
---
Best duo level partner with a shadow priest? My brother is leveling a dwarf shadow priest and I’m stuck between warrior, rogue, warlock, and mage. Do any of these classes have synergy? I know the two caster classes will have gear competition so I was leaning warrior/rogue. 
---
Any help is appreciated!
---
Just because it's physically possible to do something doesn't make you not a massive douche for doing it. :)
---
If you get joy from causing misery to others I feel sorry for you in life.
---
Got sources on that? And numbers of other mmos?
---
It's called STV.
---
Who won?
---
True, but only a fraction of even the more hardcore pvpers will be able to use that advantage in premades. The rest of the time you deal with retardins, so it's a pretty even trade.
---
Some people choose the game over IRL
---
Goddamn, I can't wait for food to actually be useful again. I was a mage main and still brought food for those extra stat bonuses.Only ate conjured food when I was too poor to buy some food and drink.
---
If you don’t want people from the opposing faction to fuck with you either 
---
A) kill them, or 
---
B) play on a PvE server
---
There’s no right or wrong here.
---
If it needs to be, then I would be for layering of first two zones for each race or for 5 days max and only to like level 40 zones. Nothing beyond.
---
There are dozens of us, dozens !
---
Like what?
---
I am saying that I offtank, bit I am not allowed any of that gear because it is prioritized to main spec Tanks.
---
Because I was Orc, all swords and daggers were priority to rogues and non orc fury warriors. Tanks soak up all of the tier gear, and all the accessories. If there was decay at 10% per week I would have lost 25% of my DKP to decay before an item became available for me to bid on (6 weeks of 10% decay on previous weeks = 521.7%/700% of a weeks DKP).
---
Looking at angry comments on these endless reposts is strangely appealing! 
---
BURN THE OP!
---
Up vote and a sad face lol :(
---
You weren't reading many. There were compromises listed all over the place.  I get downvoted for suggesting we have some servers with layering and some with out. Everyone goes in to face the consequences or bounty of there decision. Everyone wins.
---
He means that layering will not be an authentic vanilla experience, which is during phase 1. Phase 2 will not have layering, which is a retail thing that would cut down on server lag and what not.  I say just play the game when and how you want my dude, its gonna be epic
---
Definitely doable to level tailoring at the same time as leveling; however, you will need to dedicate some levels to grind out humanoids once you get to the new brackets of cloth. If you're trying to speed level to 60, it isn't viable. But if you're casually leveling, it's not a real hassle.
---
What is a drachm
---
I would say learning cooking and fishing are only really worth it if you plan on taking your sweet ass time with leveling. The cooked food really does make a difference in combat, but it isn't necessary. If you want to go straight to raiding then you can level just fine without those extra food buffs.
---
Feral Druid, Enhance Shaman, Shadow Priest, Ret Pally, or any other specs the communith shunned in Vanilla. Ruffle them feathers
---
I only work 7 months per year. In the remaining 5 I have nothing to do. No other hobbies, no more girlfriend.
---
This is my dilemma, I change my mind every other day
---
Don't go Shadow if you're duoing the whole way. Heal and partner with a Warrior / Rogue / Mage.
---
That's a nice story :)
---
So you act like a child in return eh? Real mature.
---
I've literally told you why DKP works, because keeping 40 people happy (more like 50 if you want to account for absences) with minimal loot dropping on a fixed raid schedule is impossible.
---
DKP turns the guild into essentially a business, with people earning wages and spending accordingly. What usually ends up causing DKP to fail is you don't reward the leadership doing all the hard work of maintaining the system. It becomes volunteer work and nobody is a charity. To combat this, you have to give wages to the officers as well, usually in the form of gold, free raiding mats, etc. Make their lives a little easier for the work they're putting in.
---
A truly hardcore guild does not ever last with loot council because they are some of the most toxic, cliquish group of players you'll ever come across. Just think to the early guilds in WoW, how many of them actually still exist today? How many of them broke up due to guild drama over loot? DKP isn't perfect, but it does at least remove the ability for someone to scream favoritism because they do 0.1% more DPS and have 100% attendance vs 99% attendance. You want an item? Spend your points. Win or lose, simple as that.
---
Lastly, I promise you I've played in hardcore guilds, including top 10 worldwide back in the day. Loot council never worked for long periods. The reason people like loot council is that they're either corrupt or they're lazy. It puts onus on the player to prove themselves and usually by the time the player realizes they've been taken advantage of, several pieces of loot have dropped that they never had a chance at. Person leaves, another ignorant fool joins, rinse and repeat until you run out of schmucks.
---
There is no PVE server, it's a beta. And there are no ways to create a completely safe duel environment in vanilla.
---
If the best defense of your behavior that you can muster is "it's not illegal" then maybe it's time to look in the mirror and remember that you're interacting with other people just like yourself.
---
You're going to get all types of people in Classic as you do in Retail. Your primary community is your guild. Find one with a great attitude and you'll be fine.
---
Subscription? What are you taljing about? Role playing games dont have subscriptions. You just buy the books and some dice.
---
From reading your comment I feel the same negativity that never got me into modern WoW originally. Wouldn't it be better to welcome new people to the game and let it remain populated rather to tell them to not try in the first place?
---
Fake you forgot to add people dueling under it.
---
blizzard is not launching the game as it was then. they added several mechanics that never were in vanilla and will inevitably have a bad influence on the game, just like they had in retail.
---
He's planning on going shadow and switching to heals when we're together. Can't he switch out of shadow in desperate times when we need a PWS or renew?
---
Just let it happen, alliance are objectively better anyway. 😉
---
I thought it was universally agreed that MC was by far the most shit raid in WoW by a huge margin.
---
The fact that you assume I would ever waste time doing such a thing is hilarious. Get a grip.
---
You could actually address the claims I made or you could make a really silly analogy. You went with the latter. 
---
What’s the opposite of pedantic?
---
Have a good day, man.
---
Priest and shaman for sure. Undecided after that
---
It’s not just DBM though. Not having threat meters requires strategy and cooperation of the whole raid.
---
Don’t worry, he’s a retard.
---
To answer your question, I think no. It won’t be to you as it was to your friends, simply because back then, it was new to EVERYONE. Now, alot of people who played back then or who have played it on private servers for 13 years, will be there. Theories and strategies have been made long ago, and everyone know how to beat everything really quick now. As a result, the game world becomes alot smaller as a whole.
---
Don’t let this scare you away, though. You’ll find nice people to play with and enjoy the game at your pace. Some people, like me, like to go quickly through the game at the highest pace with the most effectively strategies and methods, but that’s how we choose to play the game. Many don’t. It’s up to you what you want to make of it!
---
Respecting when someone says they're done with a conversation, maybe?
---
" Not bashing, I'm just genuinely curious how you balance it all. "  
---
I guess this part of your OP was a load of shit huh? Having a job that takes 1/3 of your time for the next 50 years isn't some sort of grand achievement btw
---
&gt;I'm curious if its going to be close to all the wonder and whimsy my friends described it being back in the day.
---
No, and it's not possible to be that.
---
That was a specific time reserved for the past... it's 2019 and classic will be very successful, but it's not Vanilla and won't ever be.
---
The community is not going to be anywhere near what it was back then - there will be pockets of it but the general community will exist in a world where Fortnite exists.
---
You'll have a lot of fun in Classic so it's worth playing... just set your expectations right and you'll be fine.
---
You won't hurt 60 in a week, you won't kill rag in 2 weeks and you wont hit rank 14.
---
Try it out, really try to hit 60 and you'll see by the time your 60 if you will end up spending hundreds or thousands of hours in Classic.
---
Good luck!
---
Because ultimately your toon gets deleted at some point
---
Classic is the best game ever made. Period. If you want to try it - you absolutely should. It blows retail out of the fucking water. TBC (The burning crusade) was awesome too, but from then on it went straight downhill. I would recommend not playing prot warrior early on, you might get called nasty names if you don't know what exactly to do. I'd recommend mage, that is totally an opinion, but they offer an array of abilities that could help a newcomer (portals, conjure food/water, etc.). Anyhoo, play what you would like - that's the glory of the game! But if you're even slightly interested give it a shot. Worst case, you don't enjoy it and you cancel your sub. Careful though, it can be addicting!
---
I see you are a man of culture. I too like foamie the squirrel 🐿👍
---
not when the way to get them to play the game is to fundamentally change how the game is played to accommodate them, no.
---
vanilla isn't meant to have tens of thousands of players on a single realm, hopping between worlds on a whim.  realms can't form a community like they could in vanilla that way.
---
No, just the tanks.
---
But you get my point using DBM as an example.
---
I believe that using no addons yields the same end results as those who use addons.
---
The fight doesn't change, and it does not get more complicated.
---
Layered
---
Why was this removed?
---
Where am I bashing in that quote? I'm asking a simple question. Is that offensive to you? I suggest getting off the internet if that's so
---
Still, a night elf can pick up weapons like dooms edge, deathbringer, crul, or black drake talon witbout worrying about weapon skill.
---
It hasn't been worth their money. Why would a company spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees to get legally nothing in return? It's the same reason most retail joints won't follow suit if stolen goods don't total X-hundred dollars. Even if they win it costs them a couple hundred. Now they are "losing" revenue from every unique account on private servers. The retail servers are a joke, again, not being worth the legal fees to fight against, other than sending cease and desist as a threat. Vanilla has always been magnitudes more popular. They could have shut them down, paid or the nose in fees, and have a whopping 0% uptick in subs.
---
Onyxia's idle animation is sleeping, did you fraps this on a local private server or something?
---
Come play Rimworld.
---
I keep throwing around ideas but I know I'll just end up playing the same class I've been playing since 2005, human mage.
---
The real choice is if I am gonna pick male or female
---
I have no idea what half of these things mean but I'm excited to try it, thank you.
---
WTF are you talking about. 
---
I'm saying that any gear I could equip is prioritized to other classes / roles.
---
I'm saying that I have nothing to bid on for the first 4-6 raids because all drops go to Tanks. NOT nothing I wanted to bid on, PHYSICALLY  NOT A SINGLE ITEM I WAS ALLOWED TO BID ON.
---
I just ended up having MAX DKP and am able to outbid any rogue on Accessories and Bows when they drop and are available to DPS.
---
Maybe instead of getting mad at me, and acting all sarcastic, you should read what I posted under understand it first.
---
I don't know what half of those things meant regarding classes but I'll try a mage out. Thank you.
---
Since its 1.12, wouldn't it become obsolete with the next patch? Haha
---
Thought you meant wow
---
I considered gnomes for a minute just because it would be even funnier to run gnomish gank squads, but playing without healers is too extreme for me.  I want to play a paladin anyway.
---
Some dude from Taiwan hacked my account and got it banned. Even if I got the account back, I wouldn't be surprised if all my old characters were gone
---
I imagine I'll be going very slow and trying to learn about everything on the go.
---
I tried playing 'Retail' as they call it and it was like getting strapepd to a rocket and being told to read as people hurled books at me. I was immediately max level and had no idea on what to do...
---
Why can't they just make enough servers with population caps. After 2 months, merge the servers with low pops? I don't understand.
---
If you're really struggling alot why not just go to a pserver that has instant 60 and try them out a little?
---
I work 6-8 months a year, I've got my end of contract date set to the 26th of july, so I got pretty much 3 to 5 months of classic binging before they call me back to renew my contract.
---
The game is still extremely not retail, and if the tourists quit after a few weeks honestly that sounds like normal Vanilla flow anyway. I also really doubt tourists and rushers will be the same group at all. Most rushers are going to be PServer types, while most tourists will get to level 20 and quit.
---
Vanilla works because you need people, it's not some accidental thing.
---
Stop misleading the OP by your own axe to grind.
---
Skinning a human should aggro every humans
---
I can't help but laugh unfortunately.
---
It's kind of necessary at the start otherwise we will end up with empty servers very quickly.
---
No. Layering while leveling will severely limit in-game interactions over time. The magic behind Classic was seeing the same people in different zones and friending them over time. Layering will fuck that up severely bc I'm assuming a huge portion of the playerbase will already be 60 when phase 2 launches.
---
How about no layering at all.
---
As if WPvP would even be remotely relevant in retail without sharding.
---
Yep, I’ve been telling that to my friends everytime they want to join me in WoW, «It was alot easier to learn before». Also, because I am a horrible teacher. 
---
If you’re into it you can also look up guides on YouTube or whatever. I really like to do that when I am new to games. Learned Europa Universalis quickly this way. There are TONS of guides for Classic.
---
I'm sorry I was trying to be pretty explicit - I remember being the young guy who knew nothing and got yelled at for it lol! Prot warrior = protection warrior, which means you go heavy in to the protection talent tree for warriors. Each class has 3 different talent trees which are uber important for the role and style you would prefer to play with/as. I'd recommend watching this video: https://youtu.be/3t-OsvFBiXE
---
Definitely. "of Nature's Wrath" green mail items are going to be your best friend. You can get \~350 nature spell damage with nothing but AH greens and a few select blues, such as the Briarwood Reed from UBRS.
---
The greens were pretty cheap when I did this on a major private server. Elemental isn't a raid spec so I was able to get them for \~5g each. Just check the AH every single day and buy anything cheap that's an upgrade. You can get away with cloth or leather bracers/boots/belts if you must, but try to replace them with mail ASAP. The greens won't have stamina so you're pretty squishy if you're wearing cloth.
---
If you ever do raid, the biggest thing to get is the on-use trinket from the Heart of Hakkar in ZG. You can pug this one pretty easily and the heart is guaranteed to drop every raid. Healing shields are nice to wear too - the only shield in the game with spell damage on it comes out in phase 5 - but you need to kill Rag or Vael to get one.
---
If you have more questions feel free to ask homie
---
 ¿Por qué no todos?
---
if your account is inactive long enough, your character name gets flagged/renamed to open up the name on the server. presumably you could re-choose that name if it's not actively being used.
---
I never played original Vanilla but I had a very good experience on a PServer and retail is nothing like it.
---
&gt; I'm in my 20's now and I'm curious if its going to be close to all the wonder and whimsy my friends described it being back in the day.
---
Yes and no. A lot of people are very much into the kinds of experiences that come with playing your first MMO, and that cannot really be replicated. Similarly, it won't be identical to the 2004 launch. But I don't really value that, tbh.
---
On the other hand, Vanilla is a unique experience and it offers that by means of making players depend on each other, which is what generates community. Most modern MMOs don't do this and lose that particular spark. There's also a major difference in how the game is structured. How quests are setup or how professions are setup. You could theoretically wipe it all by installing a bunch of addons telling you where to go but there's plenty of whimsy if you want it.
---
Don't you kink-shame. It's 2019.
---
Funny story, when we did naxx in wotlk I was so drunk during professir putricide I couldnt decide who to heal first.
---
"Guys i dont know who to healllll everyone is dropping so low but everyone is supposed to be low and WHO DO I HEAL?!" 
---
It was a blast. My friends still make fun of me.
---
Yes he can. Switching in and out of Shadowform is not a big deal. Plus he can heal a bit using vampiric embrace
---
Okay, you know how I know you didn't read a single thing I posted? I said reserve certain items for certain classes and save them from themselves.
---
You're acting as if you're going to sit on DKP for months and not spend a single thing, and if that's the case then that's your fault. Here's the funny thing about loot council though... You could do the same thing, and STILL not get the item you wanted because your buddy decides you're no longer his BFF and someone else is.
---
Items like armor and such, who cares if it's BIS or not? If it's an upgrade, take it. Stop hurting the guild and waiting for the perfect item to drop while the rest of the guild carries you.
---
That Image has far to much matching gear. Where are the bright Pink Boots, and the Shiny Mustard Helm....

&gt;drachm
---
1/28672 of a hundredweight
---
not him but the numbers were leaked and you can get in trouble on reddit for posting the data directly, which is actually still accessible on certain archives. certain websites will refer to that data because they still have it saved.
---
eso has 3 million players, RuneScape has 1.9 million, black desert online (never heard of it until now) has 2+ million and there's a bunch of free to play MMOs with much higher populations and make lots of money. even Warframe boasts about 8 million players sometimes
---
blizzard stopped putting out official sources for their subscription base years ago when it started dropping. last publicly announced number was 7.1 million in 2015 IIRC, which isn't too good considering vanilla had 8 million and the game peaked at 12 around cata
---
at it's highest BFA had 3.2 million subs. Classic doesn't need to do much to be a roaring success.
---
I translate it as "not optimal", as warrior is the optimal one. All other tanks are not much better than shaman.
---
I played a resto druid in vanilla, I love druids, but I think when people come to vanilla with more experience and a better understanding of min/maxing, druids will have very little place as raid healers. I remember having to put a good deal of effort to beat pallys that I outgeared pretty badly, and I did it using rank 3/4 HT (rank 3 suffered quite a bit from +healing, but it casted faster).
---
Now I think I will play a Holy pally and *actually* have flash heal.
---
Why does the blue guy not have Anduin's face or something photoshopped on?
---
im pretty sure there use to be a bug in early vanilla that you could tame them.
---
This is incorrect. A properly mitigation tank bear druid has no problems tanking most raid bosses.
---
I guess I just never saw it done well. I saw some ferals try...try and die.
---
I feel like for decay to work you need to have not placed a bid on an upgrade that dropped that week. 
---
One fury drop in 6 weeks and 5 other warriors need it, it isn't really fair to decay that pool of players that didn't win.
---
And I don't do that (99% of the time) either. So...?
---
Implying anyone invited the Lazerchicken to the raid in the first place.
---
I'm playing with real friends. So no luck needed.
---
There is less chance of fighting over loot in DKP than loot council. I've done both systems and both have their flaws, but loot council done poorly is so incredibly toxic. The fact is most people leading a guild do not have the tools or personalities necessary to be impartial leaders. Most people make loot council guilds to take advantage of others and be lazy. Easier to force players to fight for your affections than maintain a DKP system.
---
Winning is winning.
---
I wasn't a raider in vanilla but I think all vanilla WoW did was release better armor with harder raids. Like you still had to go through the work of getting geared for those harder raids if you wanted access to the better armor.
---
In retail WoW they literally just give you high level armor to allow you to experience newer content. It is ridiculous. I think the highest ilvl before patch 8.2 was around 380. You had to do mythics and raids to get gear that high. 
---
Now they literally just give you ilvl 380+ gear to allow players to experience the newer content without having to do mythics or raid. This completely takes away any sense of accomplishment that came from doing mythic dungeons and raids. What the hell is the point of even doing these hard things when all you have to do is wait till the next patch where blizz will give you high ilvl gear during the fucking intro quests?
---
your crazy. every character of mine will be a skinner just for the extra vendor items. skinning is easy af to level and pays off in the long run.
---
Why don’t I ever see leeway described as that.
---
Artificial lag. That’s *exactly* what it is. Walking directly over traps and not triggering them? Blizzard not even hitting you? Please. Who is the person who approved this, did they even play Classic or any pserver?
---
So what is your solution to initial overpopulation of zones?
---
People didn't know how to optimize bears in 2005. An armor capped bear with 12K HP can laugh off crushing blows. Is he as tanky as a full mit prof war? Ofc not, but he is tanky enough for raid bosses.
---
Dwarf warrior, but with a major possibility of class being overplayed, or human paladin and eventually becoming a plate wearing class that has to wear cloth and look like an banana with T1
---
&gt; not when the way to get them to play the game is to fundamentally change how the game is played to accommodate them
---
What do you mean by this? Blizzard is keeping in so many annoyances to preserve how Vanilla was, so I don't know what you are referencing.
---
Unless you have 39 other real friends with you, you'll still need to find randos. That's just classic.
---
I'm playing with real friends too, doesn't mean I won't have to play with others
---
Girls like blues and purps.

The LFR system has pretty much destroyed wow.
---
Makes sense.
---
Warlocks are most useful in small fights. 1v1 or 2v2. That makes them good solo defenders. The pet means you cant just CC the Warlock and cap the flag. You have to actually fight them and kill them - and Warlocks are pretty good 1v1.
---
Mages are more versatile. They're either pretty good or very good at basically everything. They can defend a base, run the flag, join the fight, or just stand back and CC people that attack the healers. If all else fails, Polymorph and run away.
---
Artificial lag?
---
Probably not great in world PvP. Warriors are somewhat vulnerable in the open world, and and tend to struggle at PvP until you get decent gear. The damage potential of priest/warrior is going to be lower than rogue/lock/mage and priest. Anyone who knows what they're doing will focus priest first, and kite the warrior
---
Thank you, kind sir!
---
Im the opposite.  I played horde during wow retail but wanna try something new so I'll play alliance.
---
Bummer, I stand corrected. Well that sucks then
---
really?  if blizz was smart, they would suck the streamer dick even harder?  lol
---
Nah not really. I told my friends I’m going to play Paladin, so all of them seems to be going Ally too, even tho a few of them wanted to go Horde. People are free to pick whatever they want and if it comes down to it then I guess you’re playing on different factions. 
---
That’s it.
---
Magnataurs from draenor? Those things were giant
---
My spell, I decide where it goes! You can play your own druid if you want an innervate.
---
Humans are goal oriented creatures.. if his goal is to get it and he is serious, then that is all he really needs for motivation.
---
Where can I find that cat image? Google sucks please help
---
It's 300€. Really stable and kid of heavy. It can hold up to to 200kg.
---
Which is super fucking dark since they're apparently humans sometimes
---
The communities of most MMOs are toxic these days. People have forgotten/never knew what it was to be a part of a server community. Finding a good guild and growing with them is the first key to making your experience great. With the right group of people around you even the worst of times can be great fun.
---
the beta is basically over...
---
Lol loser
---
Not after she has been engaged in combat (a wipe as described above)
---
I don't plan on raiding, thanks though. No interest in pressing frostbolt and nothing but frostbolt for 2 raid tiers.
---
I don't see there being many new people come to play a 15 yo game on private servers.
---
You're crazy! As a tauren, I will be *specifically* farming for an orc wolf because of how much I loathe kodo mounts.
---
So in terms of pve, were gods, but for world pvp were somewhat vulnerable. Might have to take that. Thanks
---
Alright bubba lol
---
Hi, /u/TheFreshHearth

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cadc8p/ive_been_going_back_and_forth_between_these_two/). 
---
There's a chance no one will get rank 14 of the server pop isn't high enough and someone hasn't gotten high enough honor, which matter when and what server you play on will require way more than 2 hours daily
---
Instead of spell batching Blizzard is putting artifical lag into Classic to "mimic" spell batching which is really bad because its done poorly and some things like self healing and interrupts shouldnt be affected by this (as they werent affected by spell batching) but they are in Classic beta.
---
Something about this tells me you are upset about more than classic wow.
---
To everyone talking about server merging on low pop realms:
---
They want to keep the amount of realms low. Not only that but a common issue that people don't know about server's merging is that you lose all sense of realm identity. You combine two servers with their own completely unique experiences, events, and cultures can make for a disastrous experience for each end user. 
---
Also think on the flip side of this proverbial coin. Why not split up a full realm into two realms? Because it would be a bad experience.
---
Queue times are bad for everyone, including Blizzard. Layering is their solution in the most practical way possible while using code (modified of course) that already exists. Is it good? No. But looking at it from a company perspective? You don't want your game to have "too many people" playing it that it prevents ANYONE else from playing at any point. So for them it's a good solution. I think it is as well. It still promotes a healthy realm life for it's entire existence rather than to be destroyed months after post-launch. I think that's better in the end than fighting hundreds of people for a single named mob for a quest, or queue times, or poor post-launch server health (including server merging).
---
Gnome and dwarf facials are pretty far from minuscule in pvp.  I’d argue stoneskin is the best active pvp racial in the game.
---
Aight so I can comment on the Fury Warrior side.
---
It is quite well documented that for a DW Fury against a raidboss eliminating Glancing Blow damage reduction, which in Classic as far as current knowledge holds requires 310 weapon skill, equals around 12% straight up dps increase.
---
The formulae for GB reduction is linear so going for 305 weapon skill is pretty much 5-6% dps increase.
---
The racial for Warrior is big. But it will not make or break encounters or anything. If you personally want to min-max then yea, it is an obvious choice. But if not caring for absolute min-max roll what you enjoy.
---
pretty much all preparation you need for classic is money for repairs and flasks for tanks if at all possible. If you still fail its 100% on the player skill and not any raid preparation.
---
You have no other life priorities other than survive and video game. It's not hard.
---
Gold is much less valuable on retail. Unless you're raiding mythic you don't really need it. In vanilla even a semi casual guild is gonna expect you to bring some consumables. Maybe not flask but fire protection potions mana pots elixirs etc. if you plan on raiding naxx and don't particularly care about pvp a huge part of your daily life end game is devoted to farming gold. Paying money to bypass it all would completely destroy a large chunk of content. Thy would have to make the cooldown on a token either be extremely long (month cooldown) or have the amount of gold given per token be dramatically lower.
---
The alternative is literally sitting in a queue and missing the whole event anyway, except you're staring at a login screen instead of being able to work on your character. Stop frothing at the mouth over layering.
---
Yeah and only humans get reputation gains?
---
r/rimworld is leaking
---
All races get reputation gains, humans just get it at a higher %
---
Doesn't really change the answer. If you pick Warrior or Rogue, then you're going to kill stuff so quickly and he's going to do such little damage by comparison that he might as well just heal you full time. 
---
Not a ton of synergy between Shadow and Mage - he would slow you down if anything - but if he talents for Holy Nova then you can AoE grind together. Holy is quite a bit slower for him when he's solo though.
---
if you're expecting "plays like a totally different genre" you're going to be disappointed, but the better gear does change your playstyle and your rotations for many classes
---
You can sit on the mats too.  Just out them in the ah for a very high price.  They won't sell, then get mailed back to you.  Let them sit in your bank.  enchanting mats deposit is 1copper iirc.  basically nothing.
---
lol, its all good pal.
---
 If someone bases their life off of politics, of course they will be thin skinned. I forgot to mention that I play alliance side, so I think classic servers are going to be a mixed bag. I would be curious to see what the political demographics are based on time zone, faction and server type. The analogues would be amusing!
---
Thats why I said it "could" work. Give me a better way to rank with only 2 hours a day?  
---
I also said it was a complete waste of time. I feel like this joke is going way over some of your heads. Just jumping at the chance to point out something is wrong, without actually reading the post. 
---
Is it better to rank on a dead server at naxx patch? No that's completely ridiculous.
---
Don't be a pederast
---
Fuck yeah man. Drunk raiding is the best. I'll never understand why people have a justice boner yelling at people for it.
---
Can you give us a side by side comparison of priest, paladin, and druid maximum output of a 1.5 second cast heal from each? Assuming equal + healing of say, T2? I know that Rank 2 Healing Touch will incur downrank penalties on +healing that Flash Heal from priest and paladin won't have. Flash Heal is about quick and dirty, not mana efficient. I just want a real comparison to see if druids really have a flash heal.
---
Don't be obtuse
---
I did.
---
You’re meant to be able to get to the same result, it’s just more difficult to learn and memorize rather than have it spoon-fed to you each time. If it were impossible we wouldn’t be having this conversation.
---
DPS (and the raid as a whole) would have to be more carefully coordinated without threat meters because there’s no visibility of how close you are to pulling threat. I don’t understand how you think this changes nothing.
---
The most successful guilds back in vanilla were all LC.  You needed key role players to get geared up.  You needed to make sure every piece, if remotely useful, was given out.  That doesn't happen in DKP systems.
---
How dare people provide entertainment for us.
---
Ofc it's better to rank on naxx  patch because everyone who wanted rank 14 already has done it and the gear isn't useful anymore
---
Please understand the beta is a beta.  It's unpopulated and they are testing many things (including layering configurations).  When the game goes live issues such as this are likely to be few and far between.  By the time the community is ready to host events like this, layering is likely to have been removed by then.
---
Layering is going to be necessary so that blizz doesn't end up with every single realm as low-pop once tourists back out of the game.  I like vanilla, but lets not kid ourselves, many people coming from retail are not going to stick with it.
---
Layering is not for initial overpopulation of zones, it is so they don't have to merge servers later.
---
Even with layering starting zones will be a shitfest on launch.
---
lol, just saw the first point and it shows clearly you are what I hate of WoW community, so I left.
---
I’ll play with you. If you roll horde
---
Reminds me of a story my uncle had for Guild Wars. Everytime he would group up, he was berated for not knowing the group content. His response was always the same, "I'm trying to learn it."
---
Wow won't be the same as people remember it being. This would be a great time to start though. The people playing Classic are the ones that want that sense of Classic community that used to exist -when everyone was young and dumb. 
---
Be respectful, be receptive, and be patient. If you tell people you are on your first deadmines run and this is your first time playing wow, pretty sure you'll have 4 people stoked to show you the ropes.
---
&gt; Since most Rogues will take the Weapon Expertise talent deep in the Combat tree
---
Except Human Rogues don't need to, while all other rogues *must*. Humans put one point in it because there's nothing better on their way to Adrenaline Rush, but the other point is only 0.2% +hit.
---
So instead they take 5% Eviscerate damage or 2% Poison application chance increase.
---
How do I get into something like this?
---
It sounds like if a guild wan't to do that many priorities your not really DKP anymore. More like class loot council but individual dkp
---
And what if you could have 5 stacking auras?
---
I'm being back my undead warrior tank, baby!
---
This is why hardcore guilds really only bring 1-2 druids for brez. And they have a mana regeneration spell. Why not use it on your best geared healer so he can spam max ranks for a couple of seconds? 
---
The intent of the spell changes from player ability. A good healer doesn’t NEED innervate. But if your at like 80%+ mana and you are the tank healer you can spam bigger or faster casting spells allowing other healers to focus on other people for a while. 
---
It is never worth to use innervate on a dps. But that’s not because healers need it. But it does help them.
---
&gt;Oh well, I guess WoW players will have to learn the hard way before realizing DKP is superior.
---
DKP was used for the first ~3 expansions by nearly all guilds. Nobody uses it anymore because the raid gets far better results when certain classes/players get certain items. If you're playing the game for gear then I guess yeah you might get screwed over by a loot council, but people in progression guilds tend to care about progression over loot.
---
Yes. Its incredibly frustrating.
---
Stockades is great for so boosting someone if you are helping level an alt!
---
I'm getting the impression you didn't read my original post.
---
How is this upvoted? Zero explanation. Wall of no-tier response. Cross realm was a step towards the systems in retail wow that disrespect server communities. Other solutions would be excellent if they could be figured out
---
Yes.  I thought my friend was going to go mage (he said as much), but then lately he's toying with the idea of going pally too.  I honestly think I have it in me to ditch just to play horde, but I think in that scenario I am going to regret whatever choice I make (especially if I decide in favor of warlock instead of priest, that doesn't sound like a fun time on alliance until &gt;lvl 42).  I dont really want to play alliance, but I obviously also dont want to play without friends.  Push comes to shove I know I'd roll alliance, but I dont think I'd be happy for a while.
---
As someone who played both, horde have an easier travel time to gnomer hands down.
---
Making food/drinks is the 4th one.
---
Your math is just wrong. It's 4% per weapon skill point.
---
We've known it for years: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill?diff=prev&amp;oldid=349241
---
And it's been confirmed on the Beta: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#glancing-blows
---
Yeah that's my point with pally t1. And yes, pally's dont have much good gear from MC but you want all your paladins to eventually get 8/8 t1 for loatheb. What you don't want is to  be disenchanting pally T1 all the time cause no one is willing to suicide for it and is trying to save up their priority for the next rejuv gem
---
What answer do you expect when you're asking a question that's impossible to answer with that amount of information.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Tank, DPS, or Healer?
---
Ranged or Melee? (If DPS)
---
Very magic, or little magic?
---
Pets?
---
Are you more into Churches (lots of time praying or crusading) or chilling in nice Gardens? (Healers)
---
Race only has only a minor impact on play style so pick what looks the best for you.
---
Look up retro wow.  Good server for testing builds and characters.
---
Yeah - I admit even I'm thin skinned about the entire Antifa stuff. 
---
A census like that would be cool; but you'd have to poll the population and that depends a lot on volunteers. I have no doubt that it'll be a mixed bag... but my predictions of the infamous barrens chat remains.
---
What expansion did you begin playing in? Not even trying to be a snob or elitist, if you experienced the magic of how a realm flourishes in it’s full glory, it’s hard to argue against it. Nostalgia aside, I can remember the interactions and community being so much richer as a direct result.
---
I've already learnt all the quests that big bag rewards. All I need to do is get lucky and find one now.
---
People on this sub: Umm do you have a better solution for blizzard???? Are you a game developer??? If not then you can't criticize!!!!
---
can't see  where he says that in the parent comment?
---
When WoW classic releases, can I buy it without a sub to retail WoW? I've never played WoW before but always have and have heard bad things about modern WoW
---
Idk if they do it still, but almost a decade ago when my account got hacked. Blizzard restored all my characters
---
Imo. I’d only roll a healer Druid if you LOVE flag carrying pugs to victory. In terms of gear for Pvp all you need is ur blue Pvp set and u can get rank 14 if your compentent at FC. And in world Pvp they are monsters. Imagine mages that can swap to tank, stealth, run away, and root/high dps wrath spam. They are tied with hunters with the highest skill cap in the game. But the skill floor for druids is way higher to be able to just hold your own compared to a mage in Pvp.

---
LOL salty alliance downvoting cause their faction sucks =P
---
This is the correct answer.  Unless there's some technical aspect that I'm unaware of why can't 10% of the servers exist with no layering.
---
Again, stop assuming that I am hording DKP. If you read what I am saying, it is that the raid wont let me spend it.
---
I am saying that for the first 4-6 months of new content I have ZERO drops, because the raid (and by extension the main tank) is more important. 
---
I'm not hording my DKP, I'm literally barred from spending it. In cases like that I don't think it is fair to decay it because the guild literally wont let me spend it.
---
I would like to bid, and would actively bid on items, but I cant.
---
Salvation actually makes warlocks really strong in alliance raids, because they are more often than not limited by threat more than anything (especially when you get critting).
---
As one of the two who lost the vote, my answer would be it depends on how attached you are to a faction or race/class combo. Personal flexibility and playing for the team factors in too.  
---
I played both factions from vanilla to MoP so I had no strong loyalty. My idea human warrior was dashed, but after a very mild tantrum/debate I realized two things. During vanilla, I didn't theorycraft to nearly the level I and other people on the sub do today. Additionally, the DPS or threat trade offs when it comes to meter competition are rarely insurmountable with more effort elsewhere.
---
Shamans are likely going to be over recruited, to get as minimim all melee groups with Windfury and mage groups with grace of air, that's a lot of people to get gear first.
---
Try joining a PvP+PvE guild, so you can focus on PvP early to hear up as fast as your time and the honor system will allow.
---
Step 1, dont sell meth
---
You didn't read a single thing I typed. I said DKP with certain loot reserved. That ensures specific classes get the gear they need.
---
I'm not sure what DKP you've done in the past but there's more to good DKP systems than just show up, earn points, get loot.
---
Plus you have to spend 900g on top of that for nightsaber riding
---
I just find alliance completely unappealing.
---
Or has chosen not to bother.
---
Sometimes it's worth it, and sometimes it's more trouble than it's worth.
---
No, that guy is nuts.  It's like 20-30 hours or more.
---
A token in vanilla would be like a 1000g.
---
Thank you for reading my post. Some others in hear don't understand that because of reservations for MT/OT there are no items for people to bid on.
---
He commented on his own comments rather than making it one comment: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/caa3dw/dps_loss_for_not_rolling_human_warrrogue/et7gv91/
---
A horde tournament being pvped (or ganked) by alliance. If its a pvp server there aren't any actions cross factions that are really considered griefing.
---
Does that site run like ass for anyone else?  I never thought a graphic would cause such a slowdown on a webpage.
---
10-20 minute queues may be acceptable as a trade off for stronger server communities.
---
Yeah this is happening to me. My friends all want alliance, so instead of normal orc of every available I guess I'll be dwarf. Dwarf is definitely the best on alliance, still prefer orc, but the game will be more fun with my friends so I am alliance this go round apparently.
---
&gt; As someone who wants to play any class as long as it gets invited to stuff and provides utility
---
roll a mage
---
No reason to edit it, everyone knew what you were implying in the OP anyway, you just accidentally let it out in a post below
---
already does
---
&gt; grace of air,
---
This gives agility, why would mage groups want it?
---
It really depends on a lot of factors. Is it worth to level the weapn skill on daggers before you get a new upgrade, is it worth the dps loss that getting slower weaponskill after dings costs you etc.
---
How is it any different than loot council exactly? In both cases you could be barred from bidding on loot. One system provides you tangible evidence of you gaining points for your work, the other system you're in the hands of a council that may or may not give you an item depending on various factors, some of which you have zero control over.
---
Both systems have their flaws, but at least DKP won't result in officers and their druid girlfriend getting all the loot.
---
I don't think the honor system will be in for phase 1
---
Probably, but the Discord will be better for everything except drama.

---
As long as you play Horde (or at least not a Gnome) you're fine
---
Because healing&gt;lowdps. 
---
You can brez as a healer.
---
Raids usually bring ONLY 1 boom kin for the crit.
---
You can decurse as a healer. 
---
Casting decurse as a dps isn’t good. Especially with super low dps that requires more effort to be viable, you can’t afford the mana to decurse without hurting ur dps by a LOT. A healer doesn’t thane this problem because they don’t usually cast 24/7 and that isn’t a factor to their hps
---
As much as a boo kin due to them not going oom as quickly.
---
Innervate is used for free casting of expensive spells for a period of time for intense damage like enrages and etc. not to recover the mana of the healer unless ur on a close kill situation and ur only healer is oom on nef or something. Healers shouldn’t be going oom in a fight, but using innervate will increase their hps which is more important than low overall dps.
---
It was a step that went away from the original design vision, toward the mentality we have now in retail where we view convenience as paramount. Sometimes it’s not worth it to gain convenience if you lose server cohesion. I agree that something has to be done, but why did it have to be something that detracted from server community
---
Ah; the teleporter. I forget about that.
---
That's just flat out wrong. Most were actually Axes.
---
Highly recommend it, physical copy if you can since it's full of screenshots etc.
---
1 hour is too long, but you’re strawmanning OP. He didn’t say he wants the long queue times, he’s saying he wants to think about and discuss alternative solutions to the issue.
---
5 spells get it right! Don’t forget int buff, conjure food, and conjure water!
---
As someone who knows next to nothing about Wow the second picture still looks badass.
---
Yeah it's sick, sometimes you can skin quest items from certain mobs, like if the quest is for their skins or whatever. One in particular that stuck out is that quest in Feralas for the red-furred ones which has a pretty terrible drop rate. I wasn't paying attention and shift-clicking to skin so it auto-looted and noticed I was 90% done after only killing like 10, then noticed I looted something extra while skinning the last kill.

Oh man, I didn't even out those two together. Barrens chat, 2020. The world is not prepared. I will have to put it into a separate tab or leave it altogether, otherwise any party/guild text will just scroll by instantly without me noticing.
---
Druid. It looks pretty badass even as a mog in retail
---
Play both? Got plenty of time to experience both sides
---
$100 for 1000g seems insanely high.
---
But bears don’t have high avoidance right? 
---
Wars can block/dodge/parry but have less armor and hp. While bears can dodge but have higher armor and hp? Also don’t Wars have more oh shit buttons compared? I’ve ranked a lot of warrior in pservers but not bear
