Alright cool, ty for the wisdom

In a dungeon you'll be fine, as long as you are a decent player with decent gear. But you might find it hard to be taken seriously. Just find a decent guild and get a core group of people you play with often and you'll be able to play any class and any talent spec you want. Even boomkin. But don't expect to be anything but mediocre on raid DPS charts or PvP scoreboards. But if you're having fun it doesn't really matter
---
Modui pls! It's so beautiful!
---
I would advise keeping pet commands on separate hotkeys.
---

---
After you get VW you will be able to take on multiple mobs regularly and you will want to be able to tell your pet to change targets without wasting mana reapplying a dot that still has half duration left. Additionally you do not want to accidentally cancel any of your channeled spells just because you told your pet to change targets.
---
Hey, at least we aren’t r/StarCitizen how do you think those guys feel?
---
If a game is really good, you forget about doing everything. Including actually eating. At least that's my experience
---
Dope, well this will help my decision but I'm still not sure lol
---
I'm leaving a warrior with my friends shaman
---
A lock or Mage with his priest
---
Then lock/mage or druid solo leveling
---
I'm not expecting to get them all to 60 within the first year but I'm excited to play them
---
The modui addon is the best middle ground. Still keeps the original look and feel but darkens it a bit and adds more functionality
---
Quite a lot of mana actually. Shapeshifts are really expensive in classic.
---
well, the thing is the more armor you have, the more each health is worth. It increases the value of mend pet. Stamina does not increase the value of mend pet.
---
Yup. A healing Druid would be amazing for a rogue.
---
You could both stealth and wreck in PvP.
---
rogue is a saver choice. warrior is really a pain without a really good highend gear, aswell as support behuind your back. 
---
not like rogues don't need gear - they do, but warrior is really underwhelming to play if you dont have a really good gear.
---
rogues are easier to play good aswell. 
---
in general i'd play a warrior if you plan on deep diving the game and tryharding, then its a legit choice. 
---
but again rogue is just saver, cos you don't depend on these factors.
---
though if you play with buddies, warrior is more fun and more of a team play class. and with some support like shaman it can be fun regardless.
---
August is considered summer just remember that.

this big badass flame god wont be so high and mighty when the wow expansion comes out in late 05 and the max lvl cap is uped. and instead of facing lvl 60 tanks and mages he is gone be stairing down the swinging sword of a lvl 80 tauren warrior or even higher!.   
---
any way back to reality as said b4 tanks are esential in this instance, and so are guilds. u want to get the most ecperienced MC tanks around not only for their strategies but because MC allso drops the battlegear of might, the infamous warrior epic set, wich makes warriors all but nuke proof. allso if ur raid grp has taken down onyxia (wich should be easy if ur doing MC now) ur tanks would definetly want the highblade to make tanks hurt as much with a sword and shield as they would with a 2h. Guilds are unfortunetly essential as u need the consistancy of teamwork and discipline to execute this living hell of a place"
---
Sorry I meant to add losing your pull dot macro after 3/5 corruption, when reapplying dots may start to affect your rotation, as many start lulling with immo and dont need it past its first cast.
---
You will want to bind that pet attack to a mouse button and keep it rotating while dotting up after you pass the insta cast corruption timeline

Blizz has mentioned "Hero Classes" which everyone ive talked to assumes is some kinda of level cap increase. I dont know if thats true, it could also be additional classes (besides warrior, mage, ect) that have to be leveled from 1. But if Blizz does plan on raising caps it will not be for a long long long long long time. (3 months between patches here, come on.) If they do raise caps, yes, MC will be much less difficult. I assume that the maraudon bosses would seem very godly to a group of lv 20s. But if the cap goes up (haha) dont you think they would add even higher lv dungons? that would be beyond impossible for lv 60's? just my 2c
---
If you happen to be on a server with a steamer, and they stop playing, your server will die overnight.
---
Pretty much being unkillable in PvP, and being a beast healer. 
---
I leveled with two warriors on my paladin so we got pretty wild, but solo leveling yeah it’s really just command + auto attack. 
---
End game is amazing tho, you have so much potential as a support role and people love you. I log in and get multiple whispers for pvp, farming, whatever
---
It wasn't uncommon for guilds to guard their strategies for bosses and even trash packs early on. I don't think cooperation became common until around AQ40 when guilds were falling apart at Cthun
---
Tanking will require a bit more rotation and skill, but there isn't much rotation for fury. Basically using bloodthirst on CD and incorporating heroic strike and whirlwind where rage and threat allow.  There is a bit more variance to rage management over energy management on a rogue since energy gains consistently. I think playing warrior well requires a bit more skill and attentiveness.
---
Hahaha true
---
Yep, that was supposed to be the Naxx portal. After MC and BWL though they realized that having to run your 40-man raid through a 5-man just to get to the raid entrance actually kinda sucked.
---
For real, Frostadamus and Madseason are great
---
Oh doy, you are fail.
---
Have you tried The Old Republic? I’ve been thinking about going back and playing through the main quest lines of the 5 classes I hadn’t played through.
---
&gt; I think people are overthinking the sharding issue and getting too worked up over it. 
---
True but your post kind of made my sarcastic brain voice say, "You Japs are getting way too worked up by us announcing that B-29s will be flying around in your airspace next week." 
---
People saw how awful a bad thing was and the people who did it are going to do it again. Until it's proven to not be just as bad I think it makes sense that people are skittish. And yes, whichever inevitable fucktard (not you, Esk) was about to type "did you just compare..." Yes I'm literally comparing nuclear bombs to WoW sharding.
---
just keep doing what you're doing right now.
---
If you have a 144 hz it's not that big of a step up but still smoother.
---
This is what I played in Classic LOL
---
I think it'll be more like fat &gt;&gt;&gt; morbidly obese.
---
I duoed with another rogue in 1.12 specifically.  We were both in stealth a lot.  I only went sub to improved ambush/initiative though (at first).
---
Still somehow feels like a sub full of 11-14 year olds. Even the mods are.
---
Oh man, I forgot reputation gains used to not give hard numbers.
---
Shut up you stupid incel muppet
---
&gt; Vanilla raiding was easy
---
vanilla raiding was hard, but only because everyone was retarded
---
This, this makes sense.
---
TBC introduced heroics and badges. I liked it at the time, but imo a lot of modern Warcraft design stemmed from dungeon difficulty settings and badge/point systems.
---
I just said I was only doing 5 hours a day and never got past rank 9?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I played on 5 separate healers and we farmed a dozen or so rank 14's
---
I never wanted to do 18 hour days like they were, so no I never got past rank 9
---
but to claim you got rank 13 with so little play time means your server was shit
---
I would just tank dungeons. You will be able to make groups much more easily as a tank, and it turns your biggest weakness (battle rez instead of normal rez) into a strength. You could even tank in a Resto build as long as you have Feral Charge and all of your gear is leather.
---
If you really want to heal: Druids are great at it and pretty engaging. The lack of a rez is a bummer but you can get around that by making sure that one of your DPS slots goes to a Priest, Paladin or Shaman.

There's definitely some good classic content out there, but my god a lot of the content creators are stale.
---
Warframe felt so easy. I felt like my character was always suuuuuuuper OP. Nothing felt rewarding.
---
Imagine you're questing in Westfall, killing boars or kobolds or whatever and then all of a sudden 25 other dudes pour into the area and camp all of the spawns so they can help Asmongold finish a quest 10 seconds faster. Streamers tend to get groupies that follow them around religiously just for the opportunity to /say something that thousands of people will read or whatever. Look at some of the classic demo footage from big name dudes for a better example.
---
we will not stop until druid is less than 5% of the player population!
---
warrior, late game. just find a priest
---
Why Last Stand though? Won't you be missing out on Impale?
---
"innervation."
---
Some of them definitely need to chill out - I've seen that Kargoz guy do "live leveling workshops" or variations like every single day.
---
The man is going to burn himself out on forcing content before the game even releases.
---
I'm already prepared to lose gainz playing this game. I don't even care. 100% worth it.
---
60 to 144 is a huge difference.  144 to 240 is nice if you're playing very fast games at a high level but will probably not even be noticeable in WoW.
---
Lots of people do this
---
[removed]
---
This has been talked about quite a bit already. The ones that are most recommended are Holy Pally, SM/Ruin Lock and MM Hunter.
---
Thanks for the heads-up.
---
well... when i first went to westfall shore i told my friend "if one day the horde attack stormwind, the will land and attack from here". i thought factions would have drivable ships and could sail the seas like WC2 :)
---
Druids are good, but they are healers, mostly. You can do some weird specs sometimes and it sort of works, but it's a healing class at the end of the day.
---
As far as I am aware they haven't explicitly confirmed that.  It's the assumption we are all working under, but I don't think they actually set a limit for when the sharding will end.

---
That was a very long way to say "ya but sometimes there is a reason to get worked up"
---
If Blizzard does choose to shard all the way up to 20 then I don't think the consequences will be quite as dire as nuclear bombs. It's not ideal, but it is a small moment in the big picture. I hope it doesn't kill 100,000 people.
---
mage *yawn
---
also hunter.
---
rogue is ok in bgs, you can enjoy it and be useful. its not like they are the alpha and omega of bgs, but they have their place and useage.
---
The day Classic was announced, a buddy of mine joined /r/frugal and began saving. He also started investing in the stock market. He figures that by the end of this summer, he'll have enough leave saved up to get paid for two months before he's able to quit his job and still survive for almost a year before he has to start looking for work again.
---
I told him he was an idiot and should just take a vacation. A gap on his resume is going to kill him.
---
Yep! It’s also a nice feeling knowing you aren’t wasting gear...like getting rank 13 gear on one character and tier sets on another, as opposed to grinding rank 13 for marginal upgrades that will soon be replaced.
---
A mage is going to be my pvp character. Mage looks fun for pvp and is great in premades. But mages also benefit from their pvp gear, because their tier sets don’t have great stam, so you are really getting gear way better than t2 and better than 2.5 also for pvp.
---
I’ll also have a warlock and warrior for raiding (these classes benefit a lot from raid gear!)
---
I will of course have to fill out the mage with some gear from raids, and will sometimes do pvp for fun with my warlock/warrior.
---
You’re not wrong. Many people who have played pservers will enjoy it, some that haven’t will like it and enjoy it, but a large portion of people who haven’t played it or haven’t played since vanilla wont because it won’t be the same. I played last year on pserver and did enjoy my time, but quit when classic was announced for the summer. I think I will play for a while. But I know I won’t enjoy it like I did back then because half the fun of a game for me is learning the game and improving and I’m probably at my max skill that I can be in wow. I’ve been server first guilds, and I’ll never have the time to rank.
---
Heh, I appreciate the insight but I more meant in terms of enjoyment rather than efficiency. Thanks though!
---
Mage/hunter
---
Then just pick the one you like more. I love snow
---
With lots of grinding you should be able to.  Not with just questing, no.
---
Well shall hunt them within the snowy woods.
---
Hahahahahaahhh fuck yes
---
&gt; It was a really good game, professions, dungeons, raids, invasions and other events, I loved all of it.
---
Well said.
---
Animations and world size were the biggest let downs for me.  The "end of the world" setting was also a big turn off after a while because it didn't really have any meaning.
---
I was lucky enough to get invited to Rift Alpha, it was seriously hard core in Alpha compared to launch.  Totally unforgiving if you failed to interrupt or avoid ground sludge.
---
Unless you’re grinding for the majority of your time, there won’t be enough quests to sustain you to go from the minimum to the maximum in any zone except the very first one (Silverpine). The level range for zones are just recommendations based on the available mobs and quests in the area.
---
Damn, I gotta get down on this Druid Discord. Can you link me, good sir?
---
20 int = 40 SP for anyone in 30 yards.
---
So as a group buff, yes, it will do more for the raid than even +100 int would do for one person.
---
do you think it would be quicker do travel and do the quests in other areas or just grind?
---
&gt; Druid tanks are decent, just not raid tanks, and supposedly it's  possible to do okey dps as feral, but it takes a lot more effort than  normal dps classes. 
---
Sounds like you haven't [got the memo yet](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/)
---
SPs come along if you have a good deal of warlocks though, right? Like say if you guild has 5+...
---
As previous poster.. with a lot more grinding than otherwise, yes its possible. 
---
OTherwise no.
---
If you're thinking about a levelling spec really the order is probably more important then what the exact spec will look like at 60. If you go fury for bloodthirst and then go arms for tac mastery for example it would be pretty strange to then start working on 10 points in prot that do nothing for you while levelling in the 50s just to unlock LS at lvl 60. Most people would just keep on working on arms at that point for some talents that actually help you before 60 like Anger Management, imp overpower and impale.
---
Most PvP druids fight as feral, so they have to switch out to heal anyway.
---
On the other hand, they will have a community of hundreds farming mats/gold/items for them and carrying them through whatever group content they need to run.
---
You think that's true but it's not. 90% of classic bgs when you ran into a pre made you just left or afk'd.
---
Pre mades dominated a server making bgs unfun for everyone. Cross realm bgs were a blessing.
---
I've tried getting into that game so many times
---
Got a level 70 rdm and the game just feels so clunky and the movement feels absolutely awful
---
Honestly don't know how people can play it
---
play classic on a small 24inch 144hz -\_-
---
play classic on a 40inch 4k 60hz \~\_\~
---
I need to know the wow release date so I can time my 2-week notice for release day. My day 194 will be a negative bank account balance.
---
Thank you so much!
---
bro if this shit don't drop by august i'ma fuckaniggaup (races include, whites,browns &amp; blacks. no discrimination)
---
&gt;so there is no way to take retail and steer it in the direction of vanilla
---
Eh, you could. Remove sharding. Remove groupfinder (it's practically gone for end game anyway). Remove transmog. Slow down gameplay. Etc. 
---
But obviously they won't do that, because a huge chunk of retail players like those things. But it's not actually a technically challenging thing to do, the core gameplay is still actually more or less the same, just different pacing. 
---
Stuff like talents and abilities would be much harder to change. But I don't think that's what most people associate with the "vanilla experience". Aside from what I've already mentioned about the pace of the game, just combat is probably at least twice as fast in modern WoW.
---
It's better to use a Disc or Holy Priest that has points into Shadow Weaving. That way that healer spot facilitates the utility of the Shadow Priest slot. Which allows you to fill a real-actual DPS where that Shadow Priest would have been in the raid.
---
Holy shit this is too real.
---
&gt;have fun killing the owlbeast
---
Roots, roots, and more roots. If he resists roots, run away.
---
Hahaha 10 mins of it reading the.paragraph.really slow and stoping to think after each sentence
---
I legit wouldn't be surprised if warriors make up 20%+ of the playerbase.  Anyone who did any research knows that Warriors are easily the strongest class from 1.12.  
---
But real talk, healers are going to be in short supply so boomkins, ret pallys, and enh shamans are goin to be pariahs.
---
How bad are druid tanks?
---
If you are going for speed, you'll want to be questing as much as you can.
---
Imagine how much harder raiding would be without threat meters.
---
The amount of grinding you'd have to do would turn your brain to mush. Depending on your class, grinding it like that may be just as fast, but honestly it's just not worth it. You'll burn out 100%
---
Quotes because it's a little hyperbolic to call it a guess; numbers aren't being pulled from thin air.
---
My view of MOP is pretty favourable, but I feel that's largely because I had a hell of a lot of free time over the summer of 2014 and a fair few friends were playing it.
---
can you kindly link me, or tell me the ideal route?
---
Ahh that makes a lot of sense, thanks! So I guess the gist is, the healing priest stacks the Shadow Weaving, heals in between, and then casts at least one Shadow spell before the 5 stacks wear off, thus refreshing the debuff?
---
so do all of tristfall, and then what? any ideal route?
---
I like this idea, provided xp only as rewards. But i also want arena so what do i know
---
Yep!
---
Shot management, auto shot timer, feign death mechanics, pet management, and dead zone mostly. 
---
You dont have to agree with him on everything, but hunter definitely is the most mechanically complex class in vanilla.
---
Yeah I actually played it a good bit. The only reason I haven't is because I had the auth key setup through my old PC on blue stacks and customer service wont remove it without a phone call and of course they are only open during normal business hours so I haven't tried lately
---
It most definitely can.

---
Its sad but I completely forgot what original stocks looked like...been sitting here trying to remember the whole run and I cant seem to grasp it.
---
&gt; Sounds like you haven't got the memo yet
---
Sorry can't be bothered to read that. But I thought warriors were much better allround tanks? I know for a lot of bosses druids do just fine, some even better than warriors, but then on some they have a lot of trouble (or so I've heard). While a warrior can do everything. And there's no shortage of warrior tanks, so why bring a druid? You can obviously off-tank sometimes if you want to, but you will still mainly be a dps during boss fights.
---
UT checking in here. Woke up to snow this morning. Expect it'll be 90s in the next month. So yeah.....

Yep! Always a pain as the damn thing is higher level than you, from memory like level 16 or something bonkers.
---
Perfect game for RTX 2080
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
But... which is it. Furry or feathered?
---
Lesser Magic Wands.
---
I'm rolling priest in a group containing 4 of my IRL friends. The plan is that between the 5 of us we could pretty quickly get a pool of 4-5 stacks of linen cloth in our respective starting zones. I'll pick up Tailoring, make some boe green robes, DE them and hopefully have enough lesser magic essence to make at least 1 lesser magic wand. Although depending on how many stacks of linen we get and the RNG of DE'ing all the robes I'm hopeful I'll be able to make a small handful of them. I figure I *could* probably sell them to my fellow lowby priests/mages/locks but everyone is poor and I'm not trying to deplete the limited cash anyone has. So since it won't have cost me anything but time (with the exception of some copper for the tradeskills) I'll bless some randos.
---
You sure do lose muscle mass if it's been over a week and you haven't worked out though, but who cares you'll get everything you need ranking up
---
I raided MC through AQ with the top performing boomie on "ell-aych-si" and no it definitely cannot.
---
Cool.
---
You’re gonna have to mix in a bit of silver pine, barrens, STV, maybe thousand needles. Gonna need tanaris and Un’Goro for those higher levels too
---
Good rogues beat warriors in a pure 1v1 mostly.. I know a lot will disagree here but there's a lot to be said for crippling kiting.  
---
Rogues don't really lose to many classes on average in 1v1 so that's really what you want to determine i'd say.  
---
Mass PvP or 1v1 PvP. Mages excel in both, rogues excel in the latter.

---
*DISCLAIMER* I don't know the first thing about creating addons, but - 
---
A Flight path workout app.
---
Jump on a bird for a 4min ride? Up pops your next workout, looks like it's squats. You've set it to beginner level, so it only has you do 10 this time.
---
Flying from Darnassus to Silithus? Oh you poor soul, time for some circuit training.
---
Such an ugly thing
---
That's all a shadow priest does as well but then wands instead of healing since most guilds wont let them take up a debuff slot
---
If your AQ fights were longer than 5-minutes I think that explains a lot about the situation. It can sustain 5-minutes. Horde Moonkin may have to actually down-rank, but it wasn't TC'd nor tested under Horde conditions.

1. I got upset when my hunter pet was not able to hold other players' aggro in pvp when he used growl. 
---
2. I thought white quality weapons were the best I could get until my friend told me had just wasted about 1.5 gold buying some dinky leather pieces in IF at level 12. 
---
3. Probably lost about 3 pets before I realized I had to feed them.  ( I didn't read much quest text back then for some reason)
---
Not much a "top performer" than, huh?
---
This mages are crazy, hunters must ninja their loot before they do more dmg to the party.
---
I dont think so... unless she's REALLY good and turning her dick inside on command.

I've heard stories of people walking the tracks because they had no idea an actual tram existed.  To be honest I might have done the same but I think I got lucky and the tram pulled up right when I got there.

For the spec he was. However the spec is shit and you're incorrect about its performance. Compared to other boomies he was top of the charts.

I still think the comparison is a good one, given when a news story breaks and nothing new has come to light - that’s what media stations still do. Push out the same news but with minor tweaks to spin.   I’m not defending it regardless.

You aren't missing something. Rispetto is living the retail dream. Int in vanilla simply gives you mana and a small amount of spell crit.

The spec definitely isn't amazing, you're right. It's a notch up from Shadow Priest's ceiling, but that isn't saying much. However, I'm not wrong about its performance. If you want you can join the TC Discord or head on over to the Nost forums. You can pick up the Moonkin resource there and see for yourself.

This is an awesome explanation, thank you! I believe I would really enjoy druid as a main. I don't think I have the time needed to farm all of the necessary gear sets and additional enchantments and supplies for the variety of specs and gear sets. If I had more time, druid would undoubtedly be my choice - It combines some of the best parts of each class and rewards those who are great players, what's cooler than that?
---
Damn you’ll get that R&amp;R plus all the saved leave. You lucky mofo
---
Ah, yes, I fucked up.
---
Slightly better than spriest isn't saying much, and doesn't mean you can sustain dps 5min.
---
Nice! 3E0X2 here!! So your welcome for the power you had!!
---
In Wrath, my friend told me that Druids work like Mages, Rogues and Warriors did three years prior, and I'll be damned if that assessment hasn't held up until today.
---
Hence why I suggested you maybe come join the TC discord so you can be properly educated on the subject or you pick up the resource yourself to see for yourself.
---
1 case plus a vcr
---
nah, it didn't, I made a mistake
---
The fact that you took that last sentence seriously is sad
---
As a full time Prot Pally in TBC and WotLK, I'm not going anywhere near Paladin tanking in Classic. I'll roll Druid if I want to tank, and it's between a Paladin or Priest if I want to heal primarily.
---
Probably to be the "tankiness" of his blood DK.
---
I agree that 20/31 would be much stronger.  Get that 2h slam spam goin.
---
Really? I found it was the other way around, at least post-BWL gear. Using skull right away to either eat or stop blind/gouge off trinket forces the first vanish. Most pserver locks/rogues I've talked to think SL lock wins every match up most of the time and the spec is ALWAYS banned in any duel tournament because of how strong it is.
---
Yeah that sounds terrible. Can't say I've ever seen it happen though.
---
Warriors just do so much damage in classic. You could go full prot and slap on 2 one handers and still dominate over most classes. LS because i want to be able to off tank without respeccing. Plus its just good to have.
---
Might as well just add the ability to filter the sub by post flair.  Then people can post whatever they want, flair appropriately, and everyone can just sort for discussion or memes or guides or whatever they want.
---
I actually prefer sharding in all the alliance/hord zones and ones you get to the contested zones it stops. Sure barrens is a big place but alliance is not that lucky.
---
Definitely going arms til anger management, then into fury til 40.
---
That 3% crit loses value as the mages/locks gain gear. In a BiS Naxx setup with world buffs, mages and locks already have 50-60% crit, so 3% is worth very little. Mages in my Lightbringer Naxx guild had crit at a value of around 25-30 spell power during bwl/AQ and early Naxx, but in the scenario I described earlier, the value dropped to about 10-12 spell power. 36 spellpower for a caster is not enough of a dps increase to counter the 200-300 dps drop by bringing a boomkin instead of another mage/lock in endgame gear.
---
Early on though, like in MC/BWL, boomkin can do reasonable damage and the crit aura is quite good since the casters have low crit on gear.
---
Im gonna do all of them multiple times, couldn't t care less about the time. I just wont tank because I dont have consistent time to tank raids at 60 :(
---
Yeah. You wont have to fully clear every zone but yeah you can't just do one zone for 15 levels like retail.
---
As I have since the very beginning, I will be playing both factions. That being said, my main faction will always be Horde.
---
Muscle mass takes over 2 weeks to start going away unless you're bedridden, so I guess in this case you're right lol.
---
It wont for most after first 2 weeks of raiding.  Private servers weren't perfect but theres so much knowledge of MC that we went in full blues and got to domo first night, then downed some and raged the next.  
---
You wont have to explain what each class has to do, stand where, watch out for.  The few uneducated can follow the masses... most fights will be "ranged stand on star, melee assist X, mages fucking dispel"
---
Bag vendor is only 5s for a six slotter. Buy from a tailor if it's convenient, but don't break your back to make it happen
---
Then why have the ability to queue for BGs solo?
---
Do you mind if I ask how you support yourself? I can see why the lifestyle you have described is compelling. But living responsibility free sounds tough. Perhaps you have money saved? If it’s too personal of a question please disregard.
---
[Spire of Hakkar](http://classicdb.ch/?item=10844), [Zum'rah's Vexing Cane](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18082), [Staff of Jordan](http://classicdb.ch/?item=873) just to name a few. I think the random suffix greens might be better though but they're a lot harder to come by.
---
Vanila with tbc class changes and tbc raids
---
Yes. I was saying that they are reverse engineering, not just slapping classic wow as it was back in the day. They have to go back and change all the lighting, animations, spawns, everything by hand. Thats why its such a long process.
---
and cross realm ensures ranking will be done through premade AV, because that's a blast for everyone, right?
---
Yeah if you can just show up you're good to go. Up until late wrath I was horrible. But I was there for every single raid so I always had a spot.
---
Definitely Forsaken. Forsaken is the only race to play in my eyes, brother.
---
Ya. I'd be horde. But wanna be a hpal. So ally it is I guess.
---
Like this one
---
Every silver counts on the road to getting your mount as soon as you reach level 40.
---
&lt;Sorry&gt; | NA | PvP | Alliance | EST/CST
---
Introduction:
---
On behalf of all guild members, I would just like to say to the horde, we're sorry... Sorry... is a group of close friends and family. We have all experienced Classic WoW, and are excited to have it back. We appreciate a good community, and are looking for players we can get to know and trust. With any MMO we understand max level is just the beginning, but RL is more important to us this time around. With that in mind, we still want to experience ALL aspects from this great game.
---
Goal:
---
Sorry is looking to form a tight group of 10-15 players, at first, for specific roles in pre-made PvP. However, we will need PvE gear to excel in PvP. Therefore we expect to run many preraid dungeons, to acquire everything we need for raids. We are determined to see all content Classic has to offer. Whether that means forming alliance with other small guilds or recruiting more people, we'll do what it takes.
---
Raid Times:
---
TBD
---
Classes Needed:
---
We still need:
---
- Druid
---
- Priest
---
- Warlock
---
But will take anyone interested for the time being. Please message me here or join the discord!
---
https://discord.gg/9jENjfM
---
Time is money friend!
---
I've mained Blood DK for years now, so it's sort of my only option. Was considering enh shaman but nah lol...
---
I’m still working on the pull rotation with multiple mobs.  I feel like I’m missing something.  I’m 42 currently.  
---
Are you dotting up a second and third mob once the first is at a certain %?  So when it switches the first one should die from dots prior to it turning aggro to you? How are you maintaining the threat so well that you don’t pull aggro and take hits if you dotting a second and third so quickly?
---
2h Fury :)
---
Hey, we evocate.
---
Great stuff
---
I’m leaning Rogue specifically for World PvP, however, Ive heard they suck in BG’s.
---
What’s a solid choice for both with more of the focus leaning towards dueling and such
---
Its more like the anti “established useful specs only” club. A lot of people on here have been pretty belligerent towards the idea even of people wanting to play low performing classes/specs
---
lmao thats what i tell people when they ask how i was 330 lbs out of highschool "body by naxxramas mother fucker"
---
it doesn't matter because your eyes only see 29fps
---
It'll probably require an active sub. 
---
They ain't getting a penny out of me until classic launches.
---
Yeah I agree with this. People watch Pat PvP and assume htat's warrior pvp.  
---
A bad warrior can do well. A great warrior looks incredible (MonkeyNews as a good example)
---
Dude bro. I'm in the same exact boat brother.
---
yeah it is. Unlike Deadmines, Alliance can do nearly every WC quest, they only miss out on two (Serpent Blooms, and Leaders of the Fang) and it has quite a bit of nice drops as well.
---
More like:
---
"Is this the way?"
---
"I don't know, I was just following the tank."
---
"Well *I* have no idea, why are you following me?"
---
At that point having a 144hz monitor with a 1ms response time and a graphics card that supports g-sync or the Radeon equivalent will carry you way further. Gsync syncs the frames per second to your monitors refresh rate and is pretty incredible
---
I'm cool with cross-server BGs as long as the servers are grouped by release date. If we're in phase 4 and Blizz has to release a few new servers due to popularity of the game, I wouldn't want those new ones having to compete against guilds who already have BWL on farm.
---
Jack of all trades, master of none
---
&gt;The community doesn't know what's good for them at all.
---
This is 100% true. 
---
&gt;remind me of retail idiots asking for more and more quality of life bullshit until finally the game basically plays itself like it does on current retail.
---
Cross realm BGs is literally this. This is the dumbest thing I've read on this website in the last year. What do you think the purpose of xrealm BGs is if it isn't convenience? 
---
&gt;The one thing we should all be ok with is #nochanges.
---
Fuck that, 1.12 is arbitrary. It would be absolutely tragic if the game was far superior on 1.11 and we had to make it objectively worse just because of some retarded meme. 
---
Cross realm BGs were introduced because battlegroups were required for arenas and they already had servers with glaring population issues that they did not know how to otherwise fix. We have the power of hindsight and can prevent servers from ending up in the same broken state which not only negates any "need" for cross realm in the first place, but also makes the player experience not suck total cocks for players who would otherwise be on these broken and diseased servers. 
---
If you think cross realm BGs is a good idea because it will help people on lopsided servers ask yourself, how does this help them form pve groups? How does this stop them from being zerged out in the open world constantly? How does this do anything besides reward the cancerous behavior that resulted in single faction servers in the first place?
---
&gt; any ideal route?
---
It's not that simple to describe the route. [This](https://www.joanasworld.com/horde-1-12-tirisfal-glades.html) is a good guide though
---
Not sure how short a reply you'll be bothered to read (not who you are responding to by the way), but I did read the link and your response.
---
The link answers your response, and also opens some interesting considerations for classic wow I hadn't thought of before.
---
IMO, we still need to change DPS meters so to account for the DPS increase to other classes.
---
i.e., the value of 5% of a fellow grouped casters critical strike damage are attributed to the druid vs. the class that cast the spell.  
---
Things like this would drastically improve understanding the value of support classes.
---
&gt; Anyone else running some fun, not cookie-cutter specs?
---
I'm trying to decide on the most interesting build for my NE Priest.  I like the idea of 17/17/17 builds.
---
Glorious.
---
Get right in there and report back.
---
Pine Barrens chat
---
people are against the idea of morons trying to trick other people into being garbage and making the game worse for their groups, you can play whatever terrible spec you want and use an ability every 45 seconds if you want to play by yourself but you're an asshole if you also demand everyone else puts up with your nonsense and carries you through content 
---
all of this so you can shoot a different colored frostbolt
---
&gt;There is plenty of fun exciting things to post without the low tier content.
---
So why don’t you go and post them and stop crying?
---
Priest or Paladin? Priest or Paladin!? 
---
I keep going back and forth. 
---
Priority 1 is healing in end-game content and gearing up. I never really got to experience that much back in Vanilla so that's what I'm all about this time. I really enjoy healing, so that's not a problem. Sounds like Paladins have a slight upper hand here, correct?
---
Priority 2 is the odd bit of PvP at end game. It sounds like Shadow Priest is more fun and more viable than ret, (though I could be a PvP healer I suppose, which would be okay). 
---
Priority 3 is enjoying the levelling experience. Levelling takes a while, and I want to savour it. I plan on doing a few dungeons while levelling, and am happy to heal or tank them as necessary. 
---
Priority 4 is minimizing tediousness in the end game. I recognize that some tediousness is required either way, but some classes are more tedious in terms of farming consumables etc. Than others. 
---
What do you guys think? Priest or Paladin?
---
I'm also going to create a Dwarf hunter as an alt for farming since that seems kind of fun to me.
---
I really appreciate any insight on this.
---
If population numbers stay high (5k+) they'll shard more zones, guaranteed.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/botting/comments/3gwqi6/iama_professional_mmo_botter_ama/
---
They're fine from 1-59, and are viable (though not stellar) in dungeons at 60 but are not as good as warriors when it comes to raids.
---
This sub is currently starved for any kind of content. That is likely to change after release, and this conversation might be worth having then, but I don’t think we need to be too serious about “meaningful content” for a 15 year old game. 
---
Let the people enjoy their memes
---
Oh yeah I need to upgrade my monitor, actually use my extra headroom my 1070 will have on Classic.
---
Best solution imo
---
Call it a 360 because you do 360 and walk away.
---
I’m fine with the way it is. 
---
What’s wrong with having information and memes together?
---
Anyone upset with how things are done in this sub are really just upset with themselves and this is the new thing they have to be mad about.
---
So let’s just leave it the way it is because 90% of this sub don’t give a fuck anyways.
---
This + ele shamans are arguably the strongest 1 v 1 wpvp class with good utility in bgs. Just difficult to gear them
---
had a lot of fun in BGs and world PVP as a warrior, just make friends with a healer buddy.
---
Im sorry but boomkins are so fucking cute. Idc if that sounds gay as fuck. Everytime i see a big flufy owl thing i just cant help myself
---
&gt; Warriors just do so much damage in classic. You could go full prot and slap on 2 one handers and still dominate over most classes.
---
Uhh, I don't think you've ever played a warrior in vanilla.
---
They only do a lot of damage if they have good gear, which you wont have while leveling.
---
And you certainly wont be dominating anyone as a 2h prot.
---
Also, anger management is really not that great of a talent.
---
Do whatever you want, but I don't think you understand what you're getting yourself into with this spec
---
They don't suck in bgs, they just aren't as over the top as they are in everything else.
---
If you want something that's amazing in world pvp, duels and bgs mages are your safest bet though.
---
THANK YOU there's so much focus on the titles and rank gear. People forget that its about stomping out alliance scum. That's the real candy, and it's the sweetest candy.
---
Not on the one that starts with E - well, every now and then, but usually it's 10-15 minutes for alliance
---
I'm going to in order to fit my leveling style.  Was originally going to train tailoring as I leveled, in which case gear from dungeons wouldn't be of much use.  But I think I've decided on some combination of gathering professions instead, which means I'll definitely be running for those dungeon upgrades.
---
Viable to a degree. They dont get crushing blow immunity is the main issue. But some bosses couldn't crushing blow, Like Patchwerk, I think druids were the best tank in that one in particular.
---
"Some noob is talking about "the expension coming in late 05". That was a horrible joke, of which only total IDIOTS would fall for. The level cap won't be raised for a long, long time, and there will most likely not be an expansion. Ever." -ghaleon-
---
This made me chuckle a bit
---
Healing in general is the easiest role, while Paladins and Shaman are the easiest healers. They spam 1 very efficient heal over and over and over and over.
---
The reason it's the easiest? You don't compete with other healers. You work with them. DPS compete with each other - if another DPS in your group is using every single world buff and consumable, then you need to do the same if you even want to have a chance at competing with them.
---
I think he means, who fucking cares about the loser jackoffs that stream.  That's how I feel anyway, who fucking gives a shit about some narcissist that thinks he matters because he plays a video game?
---
80% of raiders were some combination of never played an mmo before, super young, all around bad at games, played on potato pcs, played using potato internet, played using suboptimal tactics, were clickers and keyboard turners and they did just fucking fine. You really think the difference in killing that raid boss was a couple ret paladins for 75% of guilds? It fucking isn’t. 
---
But thanks for outing yourself as one of those people.
---
Just going to say, people that follow streamers are bigger losers than the streamers themselves, and that's saying a lot.
---
spending literal days leveling only to have to gear up to save yourself a couple hundred gold a month seems obviously stupid just at face value, you're going to need gold for mounts, enchants, consumables, engineering and tons of other shit anyways 
---
if the appeal is anything other than "I want to play this class in pvp" you're making an obvious mistake
---
The soul shards really isn't that big of a deal as it doesn't take a whole lot of time to farm them. But to answer your question it depends on what your goals are. Mages are better at farming gold and generally do more raid damage throughout classics lifecycle. However warlocks are way more recruited and easier to gear imo, and they also have arguably the single strongest 1v1 pvp spec in the game (SL warlock). There's reasons to play both and it's down to what your goals are
---
racism
---
This is awesome. Unfortunately my wow pod is not as well crafted just a desk with dual monitors and a cheap ass office chair I need to upgrade. Any suggestions on a long lasting quality office chair would be appreciated.
---
This!
---
This wasn't my noob moment but hilarious none the less:
---
I always loved looking at the gear higher level players had to get excited about the possibilities ahead. One day, I was roaming around Stormwind as a single digit level and came across a mid 20s hunter and pulled up his gear to check it out. To my surprise, he only had on gray and white items so I asked him why he didn't have any green, blue, or purple items attached thinking it might be for a quest. All he said to me was "what do you want me to do, paint them?" My friend was over at the time and we couldn't stop laughing. Can't wait to have some more moments like this!
---
She's too fat for me
---
as if I should be ashamed of not wanting to mislead people into thinking "everything is going to be fine no matter what you choose to do"
---
fact is kid, if there aren't mega servers and the factions are somewhat balanced you very well might not have a guild willing to drag your ass through content, you're a bad person if you try to trick people into thinking it's going to be fine
---
people should have realistic expectations and pick something that is able to contribute in the role they want to perform
---
I don't know!
---
So much this! I came in four seconds!
---
Is there a picture or am I missing something?
---
My condo neighbors would shit themselves on the way to call the HOA.
---
It was instant queues for the first 6 months of that server, stopped playing after that tbh
---
Yeah I understood what he meant, I don't give a shit about a streamer either but for all the reasons I mentioned I don't want to play with one so I offered a serious reply.
---
OMG WE NEED MOUNTAIN DEW CODE RED!!!!
---
oops, i missed clicked ..its there now
---
Wow you just marched straight into the lions den hey
---
Awesome screen shot 😊
---
How were warlocks as far as dps in raids and dungeons?
---
I had a newborn  when I played vanilla.  I lost a lot of sleep burning the candle at both ends.  Now that she's 15 and I divorced her video game hating mother, I'll have even more time!
---
4:3 Ratio  xD
---
Such an epic questline.
---
"hi do you want me to play the valuable role that my class excels at and otherwise takes an hour to find, or the completely oversaturated role that any class can do while leveling?"
---
Gee, I wonder what I'd choose.
---
It has to drop
---
Ah, the TRUE WoW Classic prep
---
People that are entertained by someone doing a thing they are interesting in are losers?
---
Did you get lost on the way to this forum?
---
&gt;	fact is kid,
---
Lol. You’re a clown dude.
---
PfUI is so amazing
---
The higher lvls can help the lowbies with bags and weapons from the AH and joining their dungeon group or helping with certain tough quests. Oh and loaning them the gold for their mount. Other than that there isn’t much you can do besides maybe keeping each other company with silly whispers or voice chat and encouragement. 
---
Seriously there’s nothing better than replacing a shitty
---
outdated weapon with something sick that a fren sends you!
---
Elm is a pretty cool name
---
Healing is very simplistic during leveling in vanilla - it's nothing like the chaotic clusterfuck that is endgame retail.
---
You just take your biggest healing spell and cast it when the tank loses hp. Drink between packs. That's it.
---
\*This\* conversation grossly lacks substance.
---
I have played warrior actually. The idea that warriors are crap until later stages with gear scaling is a myth warriors are beasts in endgame pve, period. Anger management is a great talent, its 1 free rage every 3 seconds. And im not doing 2h prot, i was just making the point that warriors have more room for talent personalization than most classes. I agree with you that they do lack heavily without good gear whilst leveling, but weapons matter the most by far. So if you have a good weapon progression plan, you're set. Im also duo leveling with a lock.
---
Dad joke ftw
---
Vanilla ui sucks nuts in comparison to what other UI can provide you with. Its like riding in a horse and buggy when you can be riding around in a standard car
---
and you're a coward who knows they have absolutely nothing to go on and sees your chance to bury your head in the sand instead of confront why you're entirely wrong
---
And if not into being a clothie then hunters can excel at all forms of pvp with practice and skill.
---
I know nothing about priests in classic lol. What are the benefits or drawbacks or a spec like that?
---
A fluff filter would be perfect. I enjoy low-effort memes as much as anyone sometimes, but I'd also like to just filter through and participate with the community and talk about classic topics.
---
So woke. So smart.
---
bye felicia
---
That's your opinion. Vanilla UI is fine.
---
Which class should I play? I plan on playing classic but never played it before, I am not much of a WoW player I have played a bit in the past and have always specced as a DPS as I don't think I'm comfortable with the game enough to give tanking or healing a try yet.
---
I want to be able to get into dungeons and raids, pvp is not something I'm interested in atm.
---
I want to play a class that can be levelled relatively fast
---
Don't really mind if it's a melee class or caster just something fun and easy to get into as a beginner.
---
And which professions should I pick to make lots of gold along the way or complements my class best?
---
Playing a server recently had a shaman tank UBRS when our tank quit on us. Worked fine, hard with no taunt but I guess the point is it worked. Ran a full clear too. I'm not here to justify Shaman tanking but similar to druid/pally which 15 years ago were simply scandalous, you CAN do it. May be suboptimal but it works.
---
20s is going to be a very small amount to spend by the time you hit 40. Other practices will be infinitely more useful for getting mount gold.
---
What?
---
Stay in Dun Morogh.  Not only will it be slightly less (keyword: slightly) less populated but the zone is absolutely gorgeous and the trip to SW/Elwynn is pretty quick via the tram if you decide to head that way after level 9-10. 
---
Dwarf is definitely the way to go, and Dun Morogh is absolutely one of my favorite zones.  I'll buy ya a drink in Kharanos!
---
You char never gets fatter so who cares
---
There probably aren't benefits. You aren't going deep enough into any tree to get the "good stuff".
---
We'll be cheering for you on "My 600-lb Life"
---
Godspeed.
---
Play what you want!  As others have said, it was always difficult to consistently get 40 people together anyway so although I wouldn't guarantee you would have a spot 100% of the time, you will still get plenty of opportunity.  Listen, pay attention, and be ready to help heal/buff if needed and you will do just fine.
---
I wonder if the XP per hour is significantly more than traditional leveling. 
---
I remember doing it on my mage cause I heard it was really good xp and you didn’t have to change zones as often. But I didnt use add ons and stuff back then so I don’t know if it’s a big improvement or just slightly more
---
I hate to say this but the blade of baron rivendare has unholy aura on it. It's a nightmare to farm, but it would help the DK cosplay.

Yep, &lt;Death and Taxes&gt; and &lt;Drama&gt; were the OG best of the best in Vanilla... then they moved to Korgath.  They were still bad ass, but their absence meant &lt;Relentless&gt; and others would steam-roll the rest of us trying to jump into Naxx with world buffs.  Ah, the old days.  I loved my time on Shattered Hand, for better or for worse.
---
But literally using and UI addon can provide you with SO much more useful information compared to the vanilla UI. In every measurable catagory the vanilla UI is inferior. Yes it works but your choosing to purposley gimp the amount of useful information being fed to you for no reason what so ever
---
Which is still more likely than getting Rank 14.
---
1. Apples and Oranges I think. It's difficult to measure healing performance, so I would consider both classes equal with different strengths.
---
2. You can also be a battle healer as Holy / Ret, which sounds super fun to me. It's not quite TBC Shockadin level, but still.
---
3. On paper tanking sounds like an option, but in reality it's not very practical. Warriors and Druids fill that role so much better than you, while Paladins can truly shine as support dps or healer. 
---
4. I have no vanilla experience raiding as a Holy Paladin, but the consensus is that you are not as reliant on consumables compared to Holy Priests. You will have to farm (like on any other character), but it's less punishing on a Paladin if you happen to slack a bit.
---
I agree. But since when can Sally's off tank in a pinch? Horde player here but I never heard of that working in a raid.
---
I was going to leave this job anyway because of reasons, and I've decided to go back to college and finish my Bachelors instead of hopping into another job.  I only have my Associates right now, and this way I can have a nice two month gap over the summer to level, gear up, and get my guild off the ground.  I think things have worked out pretty nicely tbh.  I have plenty of other reasons to go back to school and I can live off that fat juicy financial aid for a year before I start racking up debt.
---
every tiddy streamer will have a line of dudes waiting to donate 50 gold to her at the epic mount trainer the minute she dings 60
---
Ive played to lvl 20 on p servers. But the battlegrounds didnt work and i felt i was throwing time and gold on to a server i will be shortly leaving
---
What? lol that would be a 720. Everyone looks at this dummy!
---
Want to fight 5 people at once and finally kill all of them after a 10 minute fight? Look no further! SL warlock is for you! The damage isn't great but you're a wpvp raid boss
---
I've mained a Warrior in vanilla. You will not be destroying anything as a Warrior without a) being 60 + geared, or b) geared. It is honestly not a fun leveling experience to me. Tanking is awesome, it's my favorite thing in the game, but dominate is not what you'll do without gear you can really only get endgame. Any spec can get to 60. You could level as prot, it's just gonna suck.
---
Not no reason. The fun of vanilla was figuring information out yourself.
---
Anything to get ahead of the pack
---
I don't remember a guild named Surge.  DnT and Drama were originally on the server Shattered Hand and later moved to Korgath after the free server merge was offered.  A low-pop server with no lag was too good for them to pass up.  I kind of regret leaving Drama when they server hopped.
---
I don’t doubt it will be easier. But I think the general playerbase will be more unfamiliar with Vanilla mechanics than most private servers. If there was only one Classic server, then I’d expect most of the hardcore knowledgeable private folks to be there and be the status quo. 
---
But the masses will be new to the game, or so I think. Even at 60.
---
Obligatory comment... 
---
“LIVE TO WIN, ‘TIL YA DIE...”
---
This is a nonsensical argument.
---
The meta game for Classic WoW is solved. The world and server firsts were completed over a decade ago. In the intervening years, we learned how to prepare groups that can absolutely faceroll the content. We also now know how to maximize the strengths of the weaker specs. Stop shitting on people who want to explore the latter instead of the former.
---
Hero classes were listed under "on the horizon" on the official WoW site during vanilla.
---
Or the meme where you can’t pick between the 2 buttons, one being equip the epic and be a force to be reckoned with, or option 2, finally not be broke.
---
I see what you're saying and agree to an extent. It would be impossible to do without rebalancing all the raids however, and at that point is it even classic wow anymore?
---
Maaaahhhhh\*\*\*\* !!!!
---
Huh that’s really interesting. It sounds like there’s work involved but that it’s going to be an ongoing market. I still don’t see why you would embrace living half the time you could as you put it, but it ya impressive what you’re doing.
---
It's apparent you don't know what nonsensical means. 
---
People are free to make an ineffective character regardless of if people make fun of them on the internet or not. I won't invite them to my groups.
---
This is helpful, thank you!
---
Yes they're talking about PvE sustained dmg. Rank14 is better in pvp with 3.8 speed (vs 3.4 BRE).  
---
  
---
Rank14 wep is ilvl 78 and BRE is ilvl 77 so you'd expect them to very similar if well itemised. Generally the reason rank14 gear is good is because of the itemisation - in pure ilvl it's right around Rag/BWL lvl gear. It's only that many classes have pve gear that's bad for pvp that leads to pvp epic gear being sought after. If you class has good pve gear (like rogue for example) naxx gear is far stronger than rank 14 gear.
---
Some people are going to find themselves 40g shy of affording their level 40 mount. It's good to start saving habits early.
---
Does not follow SOP. 😩

Yeah 13 in Scholo wasn't weird at all. I'm pretty sure I wiped in there with 15 once from someone falling down a hole and aggroing an entire room.
---
My absolute worst moment I still feel bad about to this day - I was about 13 at the time leveling my warrior I was around level 22 -27 or so in the Wetlands and was messing around on the reputation tab and discovered I could set certain factions to “at war” to I decided goblins were greedy and that I would wage an all out war against them.
---
I was questing throughout the zone , and grouped up for a random elite quest, finished it, and returned with the group to the quest giver , a civilian goblin. Unbeknownst to myself, I still had ratchet set to at war, ran up to him, and mercilessly murdered him causing all of my group mates to get a DHK. 
---
#feelsbadman
---
I decided to play on a PVE realm, not because streamers but because it'll just be more relaxing for my old ass but hopefully I'll never have to deal with a streamer on my server
---
Oh I tip Warlocks for summons if it's for that, but yeah you right
---
But what about his armory?
---
The raiding guilds in Vanilla and TBC started calling it out quite early. The 20 man catch up raids were cool but when you had people farming all raid content but still feeling obligated to farm ZG (and later AQ20) people got a bit annoyed. TBC was worse with the original huge nerfs to SSC and TK (which helped my guild at the time but IMO led to us keeping a few bad players who hurt us later on) and the change to raid gear being meaningless outside of raids in TBC were widely disliked by raiders.
---
Yes! Can’t wait to do this one again 😊😊
---
reminds me of a bg i was in when wotlk came out and i was in a bg group of only dks lol
---
This is too perfect
---
It totally makes sense. I raided very hardcore in wrath and thought it was the shit. I guess it all depends when you start.
---
They deal damage, they dont heal or tank... Are you one of those idiots that needs to know what number you'll be on the damage meters?
---
Mage here I will always moonkins 2 stacks of water every dungeon
---
supply and demand, you know the supply is going to be high
---
I also won't invite a dps warrior to a 5 man at any point purely out of spite, so there's that as well.
---
Oh no doubt, I was a major rare tamer all the way through Cata, got almost all the awesome ones.  There is nothing like camping one for a long time and then getting him/her.
---
Might wanna look into that epic mount quest chain if you're banking on an easy epic.
---
Are you me?
---
Spite? You mean so they won't roll on any of our gear, same reason hunters are on the bottom of my list.
---
Haha, I must have gotten stuck thinking about the feather reagent.
---
Sharding is only helpful. It makes loading in and playing possible. You can actually level up if the start zones are sharded at launch. 
---
Also opting out entirely defeats the purpose
---
Actually the only thing I plan on doing besides WoW the first month is continue to hit the gym. I can cut off all other social life, but I love the gym, and it only takes an hour. #liftforLordaeron
---
It's potentially better IF you have the procs as ignoring up to 2100 armor on anything is pretty insane, however because all of it's power comes from the proc and it's lower base damage and faster speed rank 14 weapons are more consistent.
---
It's also a pretty low drop from ragnaros, who drops a lot of insane gear anyway (band of accuria and onslaught girdle are insane for pretty much the entire game and may only be replaced in naxx aswell)
---
Haha maybe warriors off the list then.
---
I know the supply will be high but will demand meet the supply as both warriors and rogues tend to be highly sort after?
---
Probably Paladin? I'm not sure but I'd say that most likely
---
That wasn't a new concept at the time. Blizzard adopted that from older MMO's of the day. It was common for Hybrid classes to have a lot of breadth, but not be the best at any of them. The concept of "Pure DPS" etc was not a blizzard creation. So I don't fault them for that.
---
They eventually ripped that, and every other traditional MMORPG element out of the game though, at the players requests so ehh....
---
Hunter has the most involved spec with autoshot weaving.
---
Yes
---
Yeah like Madseasonshow. I liked his class and race selection videos quite a bit. Personally didn't need them but I enjoy his content so I watched em anyway. Would recommend just to get an idea.
---
nah I don't actually care about the gear, I'd do it just to out of spite, if they want an easy time of getting a group they should tank
---
Me too
---
You're going to run out of quests sometime in your 40s and after 55+ or so.
---
His YouTube channel is actually pretty good
---
If your worried about being top dps go mage/rogue/war
---
Like the other post said, they tried to ask what people thought about those simple changes like removing lfg tools, sharding etc. and no surprises the vanilla crowd still didnt like it.
---
The game isnt just faster now, it pretty much turned into another genre.
---
It looks like a reaction based action game with rotations and a luck based loot system with a horrible player progression with no individuality in the talent system and your character choice.
---
In almost all aspects I can imagine thats the direct opposite of vanilla.
---
You want to hear the biggest difference ?
---
I visited the retail subreddit for a change and the first post I saw was:
---
 **How do you start a game now that has been out for 14 years and which has multiple expansions?** 
---
And half the people say things like: only bfa is important; you can get the 110 level boost;  you can level up from 1 to 120 in 2-3 day or so;  Mindlessly killing mobs while questing isn't really practice for M+ or raids; Old expansion content is still around for leveling, achievements, completionists and collectors, etc, but this does not appeal to everyone;  In the live game, the old expansions doesn't even matter. Just BFA. ...
---
Thats just sad to read and tells you it is not a RPG anymore.
---
They desperately want wow to be like lol and dota, queue for a group, have 1000 apm click action with bright colors for 10 minutes, flame your teammates and get out.
---
[Amazing :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b49lii/i_googled_riposte_and_wikipedia_had_a_undead/)
---
I hate seasons
---
I've never cried so much in my life.
---
It's funny because I'm pretty sure getting spots in a raid as a tank is near impossible because there is only 2/40 spots open.
---
Dungeons on the other hand would become a breeze 
---
I only entertained warrior as I enjoy the class thematically and I have read that they are quite strong dps wise in vanilla
---
Nah
---
Leveling as a priest is a breeze, and you can easily heal dungeons as shadow.  Just keep a good wand on you, because that is vital to a quick leveling experience.
---
But one does Blackrock 'n Roll into it!
---
So good!
---
Not for dungeons. Melee dps takes more damage and has worse cc. I wouldn’t be too concerned about it though, levelling dungeons you can find spots ok and the level 60 dungeon gearing is over pretty quickly. As long as you show up and do your job no one will have a problem getting a raid spot.
---
I even can believe a lot of the raids were good, it was the stuff surrounding it. Black Temple and Sunwell were both amazing in a lot of ways.
---
 Nerfs that happened too early were obnoxious. My guild was kind of stuck on Al'ar for a while before the nerfs because we had recruited a few new tanks going into TBC as a lot of people quit and the guys just weren't good enough to do the fight. The nerf meant they didn't have to improve and we didn't end up replacing them and that bit us in the ass later. It also turned Al'ar from a fight that was shaping up to be one of my favorites into a boring nothing.
---
PvP gear is a cool idea, but TBC made raid gear actively bad for PvP and all of the easy 10 mans and whatever else gave epics made having raid gear just not interesting outside of raiding. The guilds I played with in vanilla and TBC were pretty PvP focused in Vanilla and one ended up being a top level raiding guild because people were raiding to get PvP gear mostly. The switch in TBC pushed a lot of people out of the game and split the PvPers from the raiders. A lot of the leadership that came into the game to PvP and ended up enjoying raiding just didn't have much invested in the game by the time Sunwell came out because everything was already a mini-game.
---
The mini-games were good. Raids were very fun and quite challenging. I actually liked Arenas outside of resilience. But it wasn't a world anymore and that was just less fun.
---
What about Warlocks, more specifically Soul Link!?
---
Found fiancee on IRC. They've been subbed to wow more months than me since I quit and the guild kinda quit I guess.  
---
Shoutout to scrubbusters, keep the maelstrom on top.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Not sure why you're getting down voted. There literally hours of guide videos on YouTube that answer this exact question.
---
warriors are great dps in vanilla it's just frustrating to try to fill a group for an hour and have dps warriors who want to come, it's not like you need to be prot to tank
---
Getting a Training Swor of the X from a Kobald is like unlocking godmode at level 5.
---
What content related posts? We get one blue post per week and it's stickied for like 3-4 days. You're not missing anything. The memes are a bit much right now, I totally agree, but at least they're more varied than the "what happens after naxx???" posts.
---
Yeah I could understand the frustration in that
---
Yes.  Supply will outstrip demand on dps warriors for sure.
---
For 5 mans you can tank well enough with like 12 points in prot, so as long as you have that you're good.
---
Rogues were good but I don't think they were particularly sought after.
---
&gt; a lot of sitting
---
Buy a standing desk.
---
They're the most efficient PvE healers.  And when it comes to PvP, Paladins are the best healers hands down due to their insane durability.
---
Won't if them run they changeajfepahsas  som1 pleaase ccall doctr havvng strok
---
You can never have enough rogues and warriors in your raid. Top guilds will aim for 20+ rogues and warriors.
---
I'd fire you for turning in something like this.  Now you have unlimited time to play wow!  I'm such a great boss.
---
Pretty accurate timeframe too.
---
According to that bigass survey we did, overall warlocks are more popular than rogues but less than warriors and mages

**Ghouls Gone Wild** | AU | HORDE | PvP
---
Classic WoW is going to be awesome. *Ghouls Gone Wild* wants to experience this awesomeness with **YOU**!
---
Primarily a social leveling guild to start, with the intention of transitioning into a dungeon and raid progression guild. 
---
PvP groups will also be arranged.
---
**What we stand for**
---
We ask that mature, friendly and respectful people join. At this point in life we understand that most people have full time jobs, so allowances will be made for any and all attendance. 
---
Expletive language will obviously be allowed (however bullying or aggressive behaviour will not) and expected. We are Aussies after all. Interesting/quirky people are highly sought after.
---
Ladies are also welcomed and encouraged to join. We wish to be an equal opportunity guild in all aspects. 
---
**What to expect**
---
We wish to be running group questage continuously throughout the level brackets. It's both much more enjoyable and quicker to do so. Leveling dungeons will also be planned of an evening. These will become more prevalent as higher numbers of people join.
---
High end 5 man dungeons will be run once we have a decent amount of people at level 60. These will be as to allow for equal gearing opportunities, as well as incentivesing people who don't play normally play with each other to do so. 
---
Raiding will be organised once the game is released and we have an idea of numbers/availabilities. A poll on discord will be released closer to the date as to work out which days suit best.
---
We don't want a clique. We want everyone to enjoy playing together. Obviously certain groups of players will enjoy playing together, however this will be encouraged to not happen consistently. Class tuition and gameplay help will also be available and actively encouraged. **Our social team will not min/max**
---
**More information**
---
The three guild organisers are all 30+ with full time jobs and wives/children. We are avid gamers, with the intention if making good wow players even greater (ourselves included).
---
Please private message me on Reddit for any other enquiries of which you might have. 
---
We hope to hear from you!!
---
You basically summed up what the TLDR was.  The post more or less concludes that warriors are superior tanks, but a feral is more flexible of a raid slot.  Its arguing for bringing one feral rather than one extra (warrior) off-tank.  It also brings up a gimmick of absurd threat generation that a feral can output, but requires the druid to farm gnomer for a 3 charge staff.
---
Why are you looking for the easiest option? The type of difficulty you are trying to avoid would be important to deciding.
---
In the speedrun meta, yes. Not during progression or any normal clear though, as you won't have a chance to gear these players up.
---
No wonder it took months to clear MC.
---
Haha that one is all yours!
---
What's on third
---
I actually like feather fall better
---
Just google "site:reddit.com/r/classicwow horde alliance pvp", there you go.
---
Lmao BFA had a world quest that gave a good trinket and it required you to take selfies in certain spots with certain objects in frame. You cant make this up lol
---
Mage. Quite easy to play but very very wanted by guilds/raids. 
---
Warlock is also easy but far less wanted.
---
Ah, so I have been accidentally watching too many speed runs then? 
---
That was part of my problem seeing that there is 10 warriors being bought to raid and wasn't sure if I would struggle to not only compete for a spot but then also have to wait for 10 other warriors to receive their loot too
---
u/bringbackmemories Thanks for the trip down memory lane.  I found  your imgur image dump with commentary.  I've lost most of my cache of old pictures due to giving away my original computer with all my original photos on it. I was undead Warlock for a while, then switched to human warlock only to be hunted down by horde (which was really fun) while trying to level back up.  Spent some time in &lt;Drama&gt; and I can't remember for the life of me where I went after that.  WE or Indomitable.  I was definitely in Haze and then Royalty, so maybe WE?  
---
Thanks so much for all the memories!
---
**Re-post**
---
In reddit, a re-post is an offensive action with the intent of getting karma, made by the OP who has just submitted previous content.
---
Question, do you think we'll be able to character transfer between accounts?  I'd love to level a rogue alongside my main and then transfer it to my main account later.
---
I was a rogue in vanilla. They were fun all around. Sniping cloth wearers in bgs was a blast! I def didn’t feel like they sucked
---
Yeah, hi, it’s me.  The enhancement shaman.  Raid leader wouldn’t let me come raid with Nightfall.  :(
---
I have renewed hope for classic though.
---
I'd suggest warlock.  They're more rare on Alliance side (due to WotF on undead), so you should always be in demand.  If you enjoy solo content, then it's hard to name a better class.  With Fear + Seduce + DoTs, you can easily manage multiple enemies at once and solo elites.  Not to mention, Locks are insanely good at 1v1 PvP.
---
Locks are still highly sought in groups for summon.  If your group needs a hard CC, you have it with Succubus.  Make a macro for it, and you can operate it similar to a mage's sheep.  Does you group need a dispel or silence?  Bring out the felpuppy.  Locks also provide some of the best throughput dps on long boss fights.
---
It depends a bit how serious the guild is. If it's 2 nights/week 2 months to clear MC type guild I wouldn't be surprised if they run with 8 hunters, 8 druids, 2 fury for example. As you get to the more serious guilds it will morph into class stacking like max 2 druids/hunters and trying to pile on the resto shamans and fury warriors.
---
Not overpowered.  In general 2h weapons aren't amazing for PvE, even if they can be pretty good.
---
The meta warrior specs were dual wield fury.  2h fury in general could maybe beat the hybrids in dps, or the hunters, but it would pale in comparison to rogues, mages, locks, and dw fury warriors.
---
In that sense it isn't a problem, because even if it's the best 2h weapon for PvE ever it isn't going to be game breaking because the spec itself just isn't that good.
---
No dude you dont loose muscle mass if you dont workout for a week lol. Maybe if you dont eat or sleep and constantly run for a week strait then yes.
---
A week off here and there after intense prolonged exercise is a good way to build even more muscle and recoup. You wont loose a thing
---
God I love the WSG OST so much. The place felt epic when it first launched.
---
Glad someone gets the humor
---
As a shaman, I’ll level enhancement, switch to Ele for AV farming till I get TUF, back to enhancement and hope I can land in a guild they’ll let me raid with Nightfall as a support class.
---
Respeccing was a B in classic... goin in with a plan.
---
hook a treadmill and make your character walk when you walk
---
&gt; By the way, for all those who are lvl 20 yet going gaga over MC, consider doing yourself a favor and finding a good guild soon. Without organized players who play constantly with each other, this place just can't be done.
---
Dat feeling when you get pwned by one in WPvP tho...
---
Shes just right for me
---
[Here is a pretty good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap0_cCQlqo) about the speedrunning culture on private servers. At 7:30 you can see a typical class composition for Horde, which consists of almost exclusively warriors and shamans.
---
Those players don't need any gear from the content they're clearing but it has become a competition to clear it as fast as possible. For normal progression though, this would never be competitive, as you have to raid the content for ages until your raid is geared up.
---
ty
---
no.
---
if i do run out of quests, what are the best areas to farm it out to 60?
---
It's no different than any other class.
---
Yeah I'm not planning on respeccing much, worst case is druid, level as feral till 50, then swap to moonkin to get int gear then swap to resto at 60
---
Mage I'll just level as frost (or the leveling spec) then swap to the dps spec
---
Warrior just level as prot
---
LFG destroys community aspect of the game which is the soul of a MMO. Things like this are not improvements. There's a reason the game is in decline and classic just hitting the reset button on something that is so far away from what made it great. If you don't have time to play a real MMO then by all means play your half-assed, rng filled, single player game.
---
I specced 1 of every single talent point when I first played the game. I can't quite remember at what point I realized I needed to specialize, but it was fairly late...
---
Generally speaking, hunters are known as the “beginner” class. They have a pet that will tank mobs for them while you stand back and shoot. That being said, hunters have quite a high skill ceiling as well. So an experienced hunter that knows the ins and outs of the class will be significantly better than a newer one, such as weaving your auto shots in between movement and abilities. I would recommend this so you can get the hang of the gameplay, how it feels, etc and still have room to greatly improve your play if you decide to go into raiding/pvp in the future.
---
Get yourself the axe Nightfall. Buff everyone and provide utility. People will want you around
---
A quick search says this is very wrong. Up to 1000fps (with a diminishing return past 150fps).
---
If you ever ask "Am I the only one...?" The answer is always no. You aren't that unique, nobody is.
---
Thanks for gold! Will be buying an extra R for official name change of retadin
---
Ooh that’s something I hadn’t thought of. I’d bet an illumination + holy shock would generate a bunch of threat. Cool!
---
K
---
&gt; crap until later stages with gear scaling is a myth
---
They're great DPS from MC to Naxx, but you need gear. You aint doing shit if you're not hit capped and dont have good weapons.
---
&gt; its 1 free rage every 3 seconds
---
It would take you 45 seconds just to get enough for one heroic strike...
---
It's OK while leveling since you will be starving for rage, but once you get some half decent gear it becomes a waste of a talent point.
---
&gt; i was just making the point that warriors have more room for talent personalization than most classes
---
They really don't.
---
You have some wiggle room in 2nd and 3rd tier of fury tree, but you have to get the key talents like impale, flurry and BT which leaves you with just a couple of points to play around with.
---
You're not going to be a beast in endgame if you give up talents that scale your dps for things like Last Stand.
---
&gt; good weapon progression plan
---
That's either running a ton of dungeons or buying them from AH.
---
There's really not that many quests that reward good weapons.
---
&gt; Im also duo leveling with a lock.
---
Anything works if you do that
---
The trickiest part seems like getting enough plate with the Internet and spell power to make it work, but it sounds like fun to try!
---
I look forward to seeing you in barrens chat
---
Yeah that mitigation is nice, but do a sort of hybrid of all three trees while leveling and then pick one to focus on at 60. Consecrate seems like it’ll make trash pulls a ton easier at low levels, mana cost aside.
---
We had a Chinese farmer mascot.  One of our guys saved him from a gank and he offered him a pretty good deal on a hand cannon. Then for like 4 months, anytime he was getting ganked, he would send just "hordes" to a few people online in my guild.  We always killed the shit out of whoever was killing him, and he always offered us good deals if he had a world drop.

Flask has 16% uptime, and will give a max of 12.5 strength on average if you blow it every cool down to full effect. So overall 25 ap, and it plays well with cooldowns. Think I might prefer the green trinket with 20 ap and 1% hit.
---
Mine did too, except I called her bluff.  Been divorced 13 years now.
---
having more bag space = being able to hold more shit to sell between vendor trips.  there's no reason to not buy a few bags early on.
---
well do you want to be a portal/food bot, or a summon bot?
---
So I know absolutely nothing about computers except that they are electric boxes that play my games. A friend lent me his very old Alienware laptop so I can play classic. It’s from like 2011 I think, but it should run classic fine, right? Those things are supposed to be like super gaming rigs I thought.
---
When I played in beg of bc I had never hit silithus feralas or searing gorge/searing gorge I can’t remember which one or  azshara. I have played every expansion from then to legion and to this day I have never gone to azshara or silithus.
---
In dungeons I usually don't invite warrior dps. Unless everything else is filled first.
---
When 20% of player base is playing dps warriors you're going to not only find it hard to get in groups, but get gear when it actually does drop.
---
Rogues should take the cape, it's a handy effect, and very rare.
---
Warlocks are my baby, and even though I'm really tempted to play one again, I really can't recommend them.
---
They were great in BGs. And in pvp vs people that didn't have amazing gear. 
---
But damage outscaled everything else in later patches, don't believe people that say they were tanky with sl and double sac, most naxx geared classes will shred through that.
---
And I have a very strong suspicion a lot more people will be running around in Naxx gear than the first time around.
---
Negligible.  Unless you’re really into hardcore raiding and min/maxing. It won’t matter. 
---
Play what you want, friend.
---
Dude the inside must smell like farts so badly.
---
Thank you, this was my original concern.
---
Do you think it would become any easier as a Warlock/Rogue?
---
I don’t like that kind of tawk.
---
I really want to find a "dad" guild for this reason.  I did a lot of pvp back in the days of vanilla and never once stepped foot into a raid, but I now regret it and with less time it seems like I never will, unless there is such a group with similar time constraints and a passion to raid.
---
Gnome is better for both pvp and pve but play what you want.

No no no no...you see, you must use an empty jug, and fill it with your piss, then drink it, then piss, etc.
---
What sucks is that warriors and rogues will use the same weapons and armor pieces as well as bring a ton of them in raids which makes getting gear a pain in the ass.
---
No, you had to grind mobs to get to 60. You literally could not do only quests all the way through to max level.
---
I wonder if he ever realized how badly he ate his own words....
---
That’s actually a good idea haha
---
Rogue is very similar, but still better than warrior dps for getting gear.
---
Are you looking for a class to gear quick? Or something that will be helpful in raids? 
---
I always tell people to play what you enjoy playing as that should be goal #1 if you don't want to burn out.
---
I didn’t realise that evasion could be cast without stealth. I spent two entire expansions stealthing and then casting evasion...
---
I have had trouble “sticking” to anything and really enjoying it. I feel like if WoW Classic doesn’t hook me I may have had a fundamental shift in my hobbies lol. I have been rocking destiny 2, division2, diablo 3 when seasons drop, Grim Dawn
---
This is like the most ill informed thing I've read about warriors yet.... You are in for a rude awakening. FURY warriors are top end PvE dps with good gear. Every other spec does pathetic damage.
---
Was 19-22 when playing WoW I think, back then played 4-8 hours Mo-Fr and 10-15hours on Sun/Sat, was Single with a stable, easy Job in Europe. All good.
---
Now I'm 35 years old and the situation is very different:
---
Now in a Management Position in Asia, wife and twins on the way. It's so bad that honestly my job is the bigger obstacle than my wife and the babies lol. 
---
The good part:
---
My wife being Japanese was definitely helpful that I didn't need to convince her of "gaming". She even says it's good for my mental health, being often quite stressed and all. I even tried to bring her into the game on private servers, but didn't work out and honestly with managing our life overall, it's probably better she doesn't play as well. She is roughly aware of the concepts of Group Play and Raids, so she knows that if I would do a raid 3-4 hours are blocked that evening/night.
---
Maybe I can train her to do some farming and fishing on my main or an alt while I'm away or something. ;)
---
So chances are that I still will be able to manage, 2-3 hours a day. I'm used to sleep 5 hours per day by now anyway. Probably will play on EU servers (yes, 300ms+ for sure, but is doable) within a year or so we're probably moving back to Europe somewhere (work related again). Not enough to pwn the noobs in pvp all the time or rock the damage meters constantly #1 every raid, but enough the have fun and achieve things here and there.
---
Looking forward to make WoW part of my life again - Manager, Father, Husband and proud Member of the Horde. :)
---
This is wild. That digging up internet history like this is becoming more and more of a thing.
---
I wonder how it's going to look say, another 20 years from now
---
I'll be the ret pally supplying you with the Nightfall buff, bro!
---
After hearing a widespread rumor of a book in Ogrimmar that could teach alliance to speak orcish, i snuck around Ogrimmar for days trying to find it.
---
SOMEBODY SAY POWER??!!
---
We're talking about a fresh server on day 1 when there are not high level mains.
---
Best boomkin is the lower end of the line (not to moonkin form, for sure) and switches to melee dps when low on mana..then back again.
---
I can’t freaking believe this hasn’t blown up yet!
---
No bg's campin southshort just killing alliance for free
---
The 5% racial is nothing even in end game gear. People roll Gnome because escape artist is so damn good in pvp.
---
Anywhere the mobs drop valuable loot/respawn fast/no competition. I personally farmed the water elementals in Felwood for their Essence, which made me some decent money.
---
Yeah, and 20s is a miniscule amount compared to 40g. Carry more so you don't run out of bag space.
---
They can tank. Warrior is a fairly one dimensional class. They are there to deal and take damage. That’s it. 
---
That being said - outside of raiding - warriors are highly technical. Hamstring kiting, stance dancing, weapon set swapping etc is huge for them and mastery of those things makes a huge difference
---
How would you interpret "Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag" as a hashtag?
---
Now... we play the game,
---
I absolutely agree that getting bags is important. I am saying that you should get your bags from a Tailor instead of buying them from a vendor.
---
&gt; I also got really mad when I kept collecting these pet collar junk items and other things thinking I could put armor on my pet only for my friend who got me into the game to tell me that you couldn’t customize your pet’s look.
---
ok but i want this now
---
I guess I'm looking for a happy medium. I want to be useful to bring along to raids but also not have to compete with 10+ people of the same class for loot. 
---
Warrior/Warlock/Rogue were the three classes I was originally thematically interested in. Upon doing more research I found that warrior and rogue were really overpopulated and was hoping the consequence of this would help my selection.
---
Pretty soon we'll be doing both!
---
:D
---
Warriors will be the highest dps past aq 40 or so if they have a high threat tank. If the tanks are low threat(and might be during early phases with mc gear and such) rogues will be able to do more damage because they have an aggro dump. Whatever you choose, both are a blast, and probably OP.  Rogues and Warriors in fact do the most damage, so you want a lot of them. It just depends on how man we have, we might just have boatloads(probably), but we will still need boatloads. If you go warrior, just be willing to tank 5 mans, and if you go rogue, enjoy that sweet pvp, use your powers for good, etc.
---
\*This\* IS my smile
---
Yeah don't they have a fast swing speed for getting weapon skills up?
---
11-16 lol  try 24 and now 38 here
---
If youre soloing a lot probably swords? Positioning for daggers will be a pain. For the most part your ripping sinister and evis
---
They’ll be in extremely high demand, but no one is going to have any money.  So I’m sure you could farm cloth and sell them but it doesn’t really sound worth it until much later when folks might roll an alt.
---
me either just got out of a relationship so perfect spot, own house, great job, just my pets
---
The first year or two I played WoW I actually slimmed down a good bit. It helped I was still a teenage, but I skipped meals because I just wanted to play, and never really snacked much. Plus I went outside with more regularity because I needed to stretch my legs and get out some energy, as opposed to sitting on the couch/chair.
---
Mage, easy to level, relatively the easiest to raid as in mc/bwl, also have a bunch of nice utility. Also, importantly, the highest ranged dps. So unless you want a raid full of fragile melee, you will need plenty of mages.
---
My motives are a little different, but I'm going to have a PvE main and a PvP alt. I'm doing that because I always like to have an alt so I can do something different when I feel like it. But I don't think the PvE main / PvP alt strategy is at all uncommon.
---
Probably more negatively impact the GDP all of Western Civilization. ;)
---
I'm on it!
---
38, own house,great job, noi kids, no baggage, just me and my 2 cats. Booty call if I need tho, if only she would play wow.
---
Don't do that.
---
This a joke? Bathroom breaks are also known as flight paths
---
I'm not saying to not buy bags, I'm saying to buy them from a Tailor. I said that in my first comment. It's cheaper, you're helping another member of the community, the money stays in the economy instead of going into the vendor void, and you might just make a friend.
---
Shut up and heal nerd.

Altar boys are the hottest around the age of 10
---
So do we get to choose between retail graphics and vanilla graphics? Do I get to use the new bear model? This is extremely important in my decision of playing a druid or not. lol
---
This entire game is a waste of time. If you dont enjoy the process of competing vs other players and beating them--why play? To me miserable farming 10 min games, for 15 hours a day for pixels that you dont even own (they are all on the server)?
---
I believe scopes can be applied to bows as well. Was a vanilla casual engineer
---
Yep I've seen the guides. Not easy just cheaper I guess. I had a pala main in vanilla aswell so been through a similar experience. Not banking on it just see it as a small added bonus.
---
Least they have an alpha that gets updated every quarter.
---
And it's fucking stunning.
---
Me either, this is awesome.
---
I played a druid back in the day. I'm fully intending to roll Pally main, then Druid alt. All i ever play is hybrids. The only time I got a pure dps to max level in retail is when they started giving out free character boosts with expansion purchases. They just don't interest me. 
---
Hell, in retail right now my only non-hybrid max level toon is a hunter just because survival was pretty fun to level with.
---
Please someone make this happen
---
Rogues are strong everywhere. Theyre just not stupidproofed in BGs.
---
You might want to check out today's stickied thread for help on this

---
You're getting downvoted but not wrong. Anyone who thinks bringing addons that ceased development during Vanilla/tBC to Classic is naive. The API isn't the same.
---
The level 5's need to be priced to buy, or else people will skip it for the level 13. I expect to see them around 10-15s on average.
---
Out of those 3 warlock would be easiest to gear and the most useful in pve, unless you tank as warrior as tanks are always needed.
---
Locks have a lot more utility. Theyre also way easier to level, solo, and make gold. Having a lock in a dungeon group is amazing to save time waiting on people to run to dungeon.
---
If you really want to play warrior or rogue more then do it. Find a guild that has a spot for you and don't worry about the gear, it'll come eventually.
---
Assuming you mean for leveling, any healer. Also, dont level as prot. It doesnt even tank as well as fury or arms.
---
Same. Said, "Fuck it, KT threat works and that's good enough."  
---
uninstalled dpsmate.
---
Is this like serious or are you just bored?
---
I’m genuinely curious.
---
Its a meme at this point. Ret is a fine spec. Maybe you still need to heal sometimes but Ive never seen spec discrimination on the 4 pservers I played on.
---

Dark Souls is not rewarding. It is punishing. The only time youre rewarded in dark souls is when you dont fail. Players can certainly enjoy and prefer a difficult punishing game that require mastery to succeed--but thats not rewarding in the way game developers use the term to describe systems and design philosophy. 
---
WoW is rewarding. WoW showers you in loot, xp, skills, talents. You're hit with a constant stream of positive feedback to your efforts--the proverbial carrot. Dark Souls, is the stick, molding you into the player you need to be to win--to not lose.
---
When you mouse over an enemy, the cursor is a sword. I used to think while attacking the mob, ‘stabbing’ it with the cursor-sword would increase damage. Kinda like mashing a button to increase damage in other games.

Not sure why I got downvoted, its in the fucking [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/)
---
My 1st 60 in vanilla was a priest around AQ release. I was able to heal all dungeons up to and including the lvl 60 dungeons.
---
I also healed all of MC in a progress guild without any real issues. No one could tell I wasn't holy; my assigned target never died without doing something stupid like turning his back to the mobs, and I rarely completely ran oom. 
---
Just find a composite spec that you can heal what you want to and also solo grind/pvp with. That's one of the more fun things about classic. You can think about the game and make plans even when you're not playing, just to customize for exactly what you want to get out of your character.
---
You and me both my fren
---
If they changed it due to legal issues previously, they would be foolish to bring it back and invite a law suit over the color of some crosses.
---
It's a trap!
---
There will be  10 R14s come phase 3 on each server.  There will be ~12 BREs
---
Guarantee it
---
Serious about a non-serious issue i suppose
---
Fair warning. Warrior leveling in classic is freaking aids.
---
Priest most fun; getting shadowform
---
Priest least fun; little dps gear exists
---
Lock most fun; HUGE toolkit
---
Lock least fun; Not a hybrid
---
Gotcha, it's a lot of work but in the end you get the best mount in game! (Imo)
---
For horde depending on the gear available 2h fury is much better than you are making it sound
---
I started playing with a much more experienced friend. We did RFK I believe and a blue BOE bow dropped.  My friend tells me to roll need. I do. Thing was, it was about the same dmg as my current bow and what I didnt know was that he wanted me to sell it. The group told me to equip it and I didnt want to since it wasn't better. I got yelled at and I didn't understand why as I was new. My friend pretended to not know me and I was called a Chinese gold farmer and told I did shit dps. I remember bursting into tears and refusing to do more dungeons. Quit playing shortly after for a while.
---
Well you usually get a "are you single?" comment at least.
---
You joke, but I'm actually looking to replace my 3440x1440 60Hz monitor with a 3440x1440 120Hz monitor in the coming weeks... And the first game I'm probably going to play at 120Hz is classic WoW.
---
Factorio is hard locked at 60Hz.
---
Mage and rogue are the only classes you cant go wrong with. Theyre easy to play at a base level and theyre crazy powerful. They scale really well with gear and both have bonus professions that make good money.
---
Even then its not worth it. The only hybrid class that comes close is feral druid with max consumables on alliance, and that's like 70% of an equivalent pure dps or warrior. Shadow can't dps cause of threat and debuffs, Moonkin doesn't have enough hit and throughput, Shaman go oom faster than boomkins... it sucks, but that's how it is. Boomkin isn't a support class, its a pvp spec.
---
This is my budget build so far

After your first quest as a new Tauren, you are given two quests. One to find the chiefs' grandma and another to kill cougars. You might be tempted to do both before turning them in. however, you should do the grandma quest first, then turn it into the chief in order to receive a second quest that takes you to the cougar area. Doing so, you can avoid needing to run back to the cougars once you've already finished them and can do both at once to save time.
---
Just a small tip that might not matter much but may help!

I think the problem is in serious guilds its hard to justify giving gear to a boomy. Which is a shame because the guild member might be very dedicated.
---
They're worth nothing later in the game's life.
---
\&gt;&gt; It really got me thinking about how I can PVP and PVE at 60 without having to re-spec so much 
---
which vanilla did you play that you didnt need to spec from regular healer spec into smite spec? 
---
And for that matter, since smite and healing specs are different, youre blowing 100g a week sometimes to pve and pvp. How is that more convenient than the life system where you just swap the talents on the fly?
---
Meme all you want about how shitty retail is yadda yadda, but saying you're happy for the old talent system essentially because it is less cumbersome is ridiculous.
---
I fucking remember this transformation from [bodybuilding.com](https://bodybuilding.com) holy shit lmao.
---
First Aid will not be a part of tailoring.
---
everything about that xpac was perfect.
---
Thing is in most modern games you won't even get past 80 fps because they are optimized horribly for high refresh rate. Many games are locked at 60 because of console port or physics shenanigans (Bethesda).
---
We. Ain't. Got. No. Liiiiiife.

Doh! Good catch.

Everyone has to have a hobby!
---
I'm cool with this being our little secret
---
I've played a lot of Eq2 and the amount of skills wasn't an issue. Granted you didn't need to conserve mana(power) for heals, etc., nearly all skills were used in harder fights because many abilities had long cooldowns compared to WoW. It wasn't that you had a bunch of skills go unused. It was that you were doing more things during the fights as opposed to using a few skills over and over again and autoattacking, like some other mmos
---
Jars? What, are my parents millionaires? Mountain Dew and monster cans, baby
---
Yep, I've thought this way for a long time. I don't it's feaseable to do in real time though, it's probably more suited to post-fight log.
---
Yep, same shit blueless day :)
---
I kid but I actually love it. Don’t have a car or garage so this is my baby.
---
Bathroom breaks? Everyone knows flight paths are for masturbating.
---
Just throwing this out there: I really hope Blizzard decides to do a tuning pass in Classic. Give some specs a little bit extra love. Give a few specs more friendly mana costs or a damage buff. Hell, I'd even go as far as giving Paladins an actual taunt.
---
I can take a hit to authenticity if it means that the community isn't just focused on bringing 5 of the 9 classes and leaving the others to wrestle for the left over scraps.
---
Its because the druids way is not to kill, but rather protect others and aid in combat, leaving the killing to others.
---
And they are fat owl bears.
---
I've done this for a few games before...especially with launch connection issues / queues / etc.
---
First connection attempt?  10 pushups.
---
Second connection timeout?  20 jumping jacks.
---
Etc.
---
I did half that grind (rank 13) but I can't even show it due to not logging that character up until recently. Blizzard refuse to restore any old achievements. This among many many other things done in vanilla.
---
.......
---
My main bad habit from wow before was smoking.

My 'bio break's were running outside to suck down a cigarette as quick as possible.

Definitely not planning on doing that again.

Winterspring to gadgetzan you say?

Nothing wrong with that! :D

Build her a pc of her own. Get her an account. Make sure you roll alliance (cows are ugly yo).

Maybe roll her a druid and get her to pick flowers. 
---
Before you tell me this wont work, i got my mrs to play counter strike this way. Wow will be easy.
---
Yea recap works but is shit
---
Rip july release :(
---
I still to this day remember the dwarf warrior from our rival ally guild who always ran the flag. Such a bastard to take down. His name was Blackburn. His guild was like neck and neck with ours in both raiding and pvp.
---
I think they release WC3:R in May and release Classic 2 months later. 2 months to build up the hype through replaying WC3 story to the point where WoW starts...its perfect.
---
Good for you, but I bet most people don't know about unused alpha object placements hiding in the normally unseen out-of-bounds area of a dungeon and would find it pretty interesting.
---
I think the title could have been worded better, but I don't think the intention was clickbait.
---
PVP in Classic needs a face lift. I know the no changes crowd is loud about it, but it really was an old system that did not work as intended. It either needs battleground, deserter debuffs, or ways to obscure players status in BGs to avoid gaming the system. 
---
Especially given that people have basically cracked how to rig the system with about 14 years of reverse engineered code, practice, and YouTube tutorials.
---
Right?? How was it not taken?
---
&gt; but the shit-flinging it often turns into 
---
Show me where this thread resorts to "shit flinging". AFAIK the discussion remained civil.
---
Statement without argument. Dismissed.
---
Wasn't a kid when wow came out.  Never saw this GIF before either.
---
This is awesome though!
---
i dont think anyone has ever said "u need tank?" in vanilla. yes, yes we need tank. you know we need tank.
---
How was this a legal issue? I must have missed that
---
Does anyone know if strat/scholo/ubrs will be locked to 5 mans or raidable like in the past? In this era (Dec-January 04/05) my guild was raiding those areas with like 15+ people not even everyone level 60 to start gearing us up for MC. I kinda hope its like that again in Classic but I guess it won't be a big deal if its just 5 mans.
---
&gt;Warrior just level as prot
---
bad idea unless you want to make the slowest leveler twice as slow
---
Take my up vote , funny song tho!
---
Idk why I laughed at this but I did
---
The Red Cross copyrighted the symbol and no games can use it anymore
---
Because they are technically using the Red Cross's logo without permission I think?
---
Fuck it, I just got a divorce. Finalized May 30th.
---
Let's go raid, dude.
---
yep my guild did this in everything to gear up for MC. When I was guildless around level 55 they first invited me along to a strat raid to heal and I was with them ever since (for Vanilla).
---
I find t hard to believe the Red Cross has a copyright on a red plus sign. I’m sure it isn’t a direct copy
---
Ascent as well. World first Rag kill and the GM got interviewed by some big publication, TIME perhaps?
---
am i the only one who is thinking about a particular woman i saw in a cafe and fantasizing sucking her toes and having sex with her back at my place? most probably, yeah.
---
Actually mage will win out with rolling ignites in Naxx. Warrior isn't far behind though. And warrior/rogue win out in pretty much everything before Naxx.
---
Keep your cock sucker shut.
---
Sadly the best balance spec is a pvp spec that forgoes even bothering to pick up moonkin form :(
---
&gt; May be suboptimal but it works.
---
This is the thing. It's janky but so long as everyone plays along and tries to support it you can get by. Honestly Shamans have a great initial aoe taunt in CL and what amounts to a soft taunt in ES. He should be using a dagger with rock biter and tab targeting, then saving ES for when something peels off.
---
Mage or some healer.
---
I'm sure they're devastated that you won't invite them to your groups. Imagine thinking you're not invited to my birthday party carries any weight whatsoever.
---
Feral tryhard is good dps, feral tank is solid off tank and can main tank most stuff, resto heals is good. Balance is only decent in pvp as balance/resto hybrid spec
---
I keep seeing the 'I was a kid like all of you when classic was out' posts reaching the top...then most of the comments disagreeing with it.
---
I'm guessing most of this sub were kids then, hence the votes...but the vocal members of this sub were older?
---
No one has money the first month so there's no point at all trying to gouge anyone, and the mats required to make things (linen/greens/shards etc) are all being generated by the absolute ass load by all the lowbies levelling.  
---
From my last experience week 1 on a popular server the lvl 5 ones were around 30-40 silver and lvl 13 one around 80s -1g. Lvl 13 one is much less popular to buy though because you can find pretty equivalent ones from quest rewards around 13-15 anyway.
---
It is the universal symbol for the Geneva Conventions.

In this case, they have to change it, because the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) are pretty asslandish dicks about the copyright of their organisations symbol.

power outlets in america are different than PAL frame rates
---
As you say, I doubt they are rethinking it and making it more fun. Shame though. Damn Shame.
---
I'm not really sure I agree with your points on resilience and PvP gear in general, also because you're not really right about what you claim. A lot of people would benefit from having some 2/5 set bonuses from high tier PvE gear, along with certain trinkets and especially weapons, not to talk about the few who would obtain the overpowered War Glaives which I think it was a joke could make their way into PvP.
---
You get to be playing PvE and you want your gear to be superior in both categories of the game? Imagine if PvP gear would be superior in PvE? How would that feel?
---
I think it discouraged a lot of people, especially me, that throughout many many patches PvE gear has been superior in PvP. This of course comes from a heavy PvP player, but I never understood why you couldn't just let each side have their gear. We do what would like, and should have the best gear available to us - to me, that's logic. Not having to raid BT or whatever instance, to not have a pretty big disadvantage towards all the others PvP'ers who take their time to do so.
---
Both it does go both ways though. I remember some tanks having to obtain resilience gear for PvE.
---
&gt; Its pretty obvious that he miswrote race.
---
Thank you

at launch I remember in my circles anyway it was solely TS and later ventrillo came around, then I remember being on either/or depending on the server and guild

Yeah, iirc, C'Thun was such a brick wall for guilds that they broke their secrecy and started comparing notes with each other, and not long after that, someone figured out the encounter was mathematically impossible without exploits at the contemporary gear level. Blizzard patched it the next week.
---
Nah it's mostly that it's a huge dps upgrade at a low level.
---
Or even better, a treadmill with a desk for your laptop
---
&gt;the content related posts.
---
And what would that be, pray tell?
---
The guides? The Tutorials? The Guild recruitment?
---
There are dedicated Websites for all these purposes. This isn't a repository of "Vanilla Knowledge", this is the digital equivalent of a fireside where old and new adventurers come together and share their stories, get drunk and talk nonsense. It doesn't have to be "serious". The attitude "get down to business or get out" is part of what ruined retail Wow in the irst place.
---
Let people have the memes, the sillyness, the stories and the chat, instead of sucking the fun out of whats supposed to be a recreational activity, by trying to sterilize everything into pure functionality.
---
Okay fuck me for writing class instead of race, I get it. I also think orc is the answer. Thanks for the answers.
---
!Remindme 3 months
---
I thought I was min maxing properly on my first few priests by avoiding silly wands and spirit tap.. Spirit anything... I spent so much downtime and gold by mind blasting everything via proccd blackout and drinking to restore mana after every single mob. Got many priests up that way until one day on a private server someone laughed at me and explained it
---
Yeah week definitely not. But it will happen after a month+
---
You are absolutely wrong about that. The quests were there, you just had to know where to find them and do then while level appropriate.
---
I feel like so many people smoked back during my wow days. Like every dungeon had somebody "brb smoke"
---
Soul shards are cancer.
---
You’ve been warned
---
I did this build on a private server while leveling. Whenever a rogue tried to gank me I think I could sense them be like "Oh wait, why isn't he dead yet? WTF?!?". Because 1v1, Fear is just stupid broken in vanilla. No diminishing returns!!
---
NA PVP realm horde guild looking for players.
---
Core that we have now are all private server vets and looking for anyone and everyone who wants to raid!
---
Msg me if you got any questions :)
---
I'll be sure to unsub if they do.
---
There's  two great options: hunter and mage. Both are the kings of farming to make lots of gold. They are each easy to level, but harder to master the intricacies. That comes with time though so dont fret over that as vanilla has been around forever so there are plenty of guides to get you up to snuff. 
---
Obviously, both play differently. I'd recommend playing each up to 20 or 30 on a private server just to see which you like more. Get your feet wet a little bit.
---
As far as professions you'll need to understand that everyone will be gold starved initially. So any guides you look up now for "best professions for X class for gold" will not apply. I prefer the plan for the future approach. For example, I'll be rolling skinning and herb on my mage. Vendor all the skins while leveling for extra cash flow and save every herb I find and cloth drop from mobs. 
---
Drop skinning at 60 and use all the saved cloth drops to level tailoring and make my 60 robe. Then drop tailoring for alchemy and use saved herbs to level that. 
---
Now, there are better approaches to make cash initially but as a mage who cares? You'll be able to make up for it on the back end easily.
---
I've played horde 90% of the time, but I'm hooked on making a gnome warrior so ally scum it is
---
I'd be happy with that
---
Wow nice
---
That happened because of the whining of the pure dps classes in the forums and less because of  Blizzard. And it made no sense. It's great that you can respec with a Druid, but for every situation there is a better class so there's no reason to bring someone who can theoretically tank or heal after he teleported out and respecced for 50g.
---
(Still playing a Bear in TBC and a Feral in Wrath / ICC with the insane burst AoE was very enjoyable)
---
This is another clear case of where you should NOT donate to. If they are wasting funds on defending a fucking red cross they are NOT helping out people in need.
---
I think the voice chat was in Wrath, and connected with the RealID system or something.
---
Ahh too late man, I'm already going through the rubbish bins wearing a gopro at blizz HQ
---
I hope that is a joke/troll. The weapon provides amazingly high stats for early raiders. The aura itself is already worth it if you break down the math.
---
The reason why you won't see this on pre-bis lists is because it is a very rare weapon and most people only care about personal stats, thinking they compete with their peers. But if you consider your whole group then this weapon is really strong.
---
It took them months to get enough players to 60 and to figure out where the entrance was lol.
---
Yet the phrase gives no credit where its due...
---
Uncultured indeed..
---
Shut the fuck up
---
I think I'm pretty much bilingual because of wow vanilla. It helped A LOT.
---
Don't tell anyone or we'll both get in trouble ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It's really not.  It's better than it was on alliance because of Windfury, but it still wasn't competitive with DW fury or rogue/mage/lock.
---
Which is why I haven't donated a single cent to the red cross, ever since they started doing that shit back in 2008. As far as I am concerned, they lost sight of their mission, and are thus not worthy of existence.
---
Horde: variety of aesthetically unique and interesting races
---
Alliance: Human, small human, smaller human, purple human
---
That depends entirely on the guild.
---
If a guild is smart, they will strive to outfit their tanks whenever they can, but they also won't give non-tank related items to protwarris just because they are the tank...dmg is a requirement, and there is a boatload of furys and combat rogues salivating over every drop.
---
Omg auto-attack on the hotbar is the reason why to this day I still HAVE to have sinister strike bound to '2'. I find it really hard to instinctively press any abilities that are bound to '1'....
---
I think a lot of people would argue that getting rid of full group premades is not something they want to see happen.
---
Depends on the guild and system. My old guild used dkp with set prices. So who ever had the highest dkp and wanted it got it (minus troll bids).
---
https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/706
---
Doesn't really seem to apply to wow.  I don't think they would need to change it.
---
Yea, but I could play WoW between my turns on a game of Total War: Warhammer 2, Mortal Empires. 
---
But if I am very honest, I would only play TW on flight paths.
---
Sylvanas &gt; Magni &gt; Thrall &gt; Bolvar &gt; Everyone else.  
---
Sylvanas: Strongest boss with Varimathras, defended location, Undercity was the secondary hub for Horde
---
Magni: Weak boss, but Ironforge was the primary hub for Alliance, and Magni sat roughly 10 seconds from the main hangout spot.
---
Thrall: Strong delay with Vol'jin, primary hub for Horde, but nestled at a remote corner of Org with an easy access "backdoor" for the alliance.
---
Bolvar: Deep within Stormwind, horde have to run past bridge+trade market, 2ndary hub for Alliance.  Downside is portal room is at the opposite side of the city and is a far run for Alliance to reinforce.  
---
No one cares about the others because they're rather remote.  Any competent group will likely down the boss before the defending faction can react.
---
Nihilum was an amazing guild but most of that was after Vanilla. EU got the game late so it's to be expected but they only had two world firsts in Vanilla... and one was from a hotfix nerf (C'thun) and the other was due to a despawn bug (KT).
---
Look up Skarm Tank on YouTube. He has a few videos on druid MT videos from ZG, AQ, to Naxx. You'll be BiS tank for certain encounters, but not all as shapisftw pointed out.
---
320? Brah.. I doubt you look that skinny.
---
Bears will always be the top flag carriers in WSG, so if you are into PvP it's good fun. I'll roll a Druid as my main alt. Plan is to build up rested and occasionally use that to run a few dungeons as a tank, then build up rested xp again.
---
TBH at 60 in a raid environment, Resto is the only really competitive spec. Yes I know, you can always raid as a Feral, Oomkin or Shadow Priest or Ret Pala... But unless you are raiding with friends or guild, you will have a tough time finding a group inviting you. But Resto is perfectly fine (not for Strat Living though because Magic 30 minute curses and 30 min rezz timer will ruin your day).
---
First day in the game, I was walking around Teldrassil doing some quests. I see a level 60 and literally type in /say "oh wow check it out!" and start trying to get the attention of the other players nearby to let them know a level 60 dude was nearby. I was genuinely in amazement that someone had reach level 60 and had all this cool looking gear, needless to say no one else in my vicinity shared my amazement...
---
Turns out he was really nice and gave me a bunch of gold to train up my skills, invited me to his guild, and made sure I had a tabard.
---
Boomkin is a massive oom'er. Especially without self-innervate. You are wrong.
---
Many would say that priest levels faster because they are more efficient. However the slow 2H rockbiter enhance spec using earthbound totem with a swing timer to weave in and out so that you take advantage of the slower attack speed is supposed to be really efficient.
---
I'm not saying it would make the spec/class viable. I simply want to have a better way to evaluate the effect the class/spec has on each raid boss.  
---
For instance, I may do better overall raid-wide DPS with 5 mages in a group instead of 4 mages and 1 Boomkin. That's fairly simple to calculate. But there are other aspects too - such as the effect of CoE. An option to calculate raid-effect by a Warlock applying CoE should have the added damage of ALL spell damage done added to his damage done, instead of calculating the damage done by each player - a portion of which was a result of the CoE he applied.  
---
Or what about calculating the healing/mana regen from Pally judgements? Shamans totems are applied to their healing/damage meters, why not judgements? Why not calculate the amount of damage mitigated by Devotion Aura?  
---
Some of the best meters are the ones people love to ignore - like damage received, damage mitigated, damage absorbed, CC breaks, CC applied, interrupts, cleanses etc.  
---
But for raid effectiveness, we usually end up with things like "Raid DPS" and that's about it. Yet some things can literally be a game changer when done right. Especially CoE. And if you've brought a hybrid class, and you're doing more than just standing in the corner spinning in circles, then everything you do to help the raid (especially outside of a "standard" buff), should be credited to you in a meter.
---
This is definitely my problem as well. I lean shammy though because it’s been my main since wotlk.
---
This gets stuck in my head more often than I'll admit.
---
Good.  They started vanilla off pretty weak but after the uptaded dm tree they were competitive with mages.  Mages just parsed better in some cases because of the way the game handled rolling ignites.
---
It depends.
---
Every guild has their own priority state.
---
Typically though you want to gear the people by a few metrics.
---
1. They are active, available, and aren't jump ship with all the gear you've given them.
---
2. They know how to play well. This doesn't necessarily mean they're doing a cookie-cutter build, but just that they know what they're doing as far as mechanics and roles.
---
3. It'll give the highest return on the investment in terms of overall raid efficiency and power. Sometimes this means congregating gear into one person, other times it means spreading it around. Just whatever gives the best overall result. And this will vary on a case by case basis, every guild has their own system and how they do things with what they have.
---
4. They could just use a pure DKP-style system with no real restrictions beyond it needs to actually be useful, and not just buying shit because you have the DKP and want to troll someone you know really wants that item.
---
Dude it is not \*that\* bad. Have you ever even played with a moonkin? Their weaknesses are overblown, their damage is fine for most stuff, good moonkins have healing gear ready. A tryhard moonkin does more damage than a slacker pure DPS.
---
WoW isn't a competition. It is a RPG. We're just a bunch of people playing "pretend" in a funny fantasy world. Vanilla especially is \*piss easy\*.  Even back in the day people were doing "Druids only", "Hunters only" etc. raids for a fun challenge.
---
The only important aspects are social. Behaviour, attendence, preparation, gear distribution etc. Keeping everyone happy and together. The personality of a player is much more important than pretty much anything else.
---
They should make the debuff start when you que and not when you leave a game or it will never fix que dodgers. Or as soon as the que finds a group everyone gets a debuff so they can't do the normal que dodge with 1 player.
---
I'd be ok with this if (and when) they added new content after Naxx.
---
lol you don't know anything bud. Horde warrior with BRE does disgusting dps in mc/bwl and still farily competitive in AQ &amp; Naxx. The meta and understanding of the game has evolved so much over the years. What people did in classic isn't relevant anymore.
---
Unless your guild was just full of assholes, I can't imagine leaving a team for another since you were both clearing Naxx.
---
I think the percentage of casual players vs these type of players will be vastly different than on private servers. Private servers have a lot more hardcore players that have been playing vanilla for years and have nothing else left to do. The amount of casual players should outweigh these pre mades enough such that only the occasional game will come up against these groups. I think they at least need to test this with single server battle grounds first. We can't judge how the community experience will be based on private servers as it's a fairly strong possibility private server veterans will be asmall fraction of the player base.
---
It's gonna be running on the new engine. So expect it to be an unoptimized peice of shit.
---
Tree boi would like a word with you.

**&lt;Addicted&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Semi-hardcore PvP/Raiding Guild - English**
---
**Introduction**
---
Addicted is a serious but friendly guild which is looking for outstanding players in order to rush the content when the game comes out. We will both rush PvE and PvP content.
---
We are also looking for socials/non-raiders, there will definitely be raids for alts
---
**Goals**
---
* Have the first 60s of the server among our members
---
* Be the first guild of the server to clear the PvE content
---
* Manage the PvP ranking of our server when PvP comes out (in order to have the most R13/14)
---
**Member Expectations**
---
* Must be very familiar to the game
---
* Strong PvE and/or PvP knowledge
---
* Team member, friendly attitude and not being a pretentious asshole :)
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
At start 2 to 3 raid days, later reduce that to 1 to 2 days when content is on farm/speedrun. The days are not defined yet but will be discussed together with the members.
---
If you are interested or have any questions please contact me on Discord : Dexedrine#2775 or Vicodine#4176

please explain why a BRE warrior is topping meters in this BWL speedrun
---
So you support que dodging where a premade steam rolls a non premade? You must suck at this game if that's the only way you can win. One would think a skilled player would want to play other skilled players but that's not the case. They want to steamroll every group they come up against. It's like they don't even like PvP.
---
The first week of class is bullshit anyway, so you can skip it. Trust me
---
Just reading this has given me a lot of respect for Guild Leaders / Raid Leaders, I can imagine it’s a tough job that comes with some degree of stress being in charge of loot and how it is distributed. Incredibly brave work. I can imagine you have to put friendships a side and use a lot of thought before going into raids or loot drops on who needs what, who is loyal, who shows up every time and performs their best, bravo. 
---
I hope I can be part of a good Guild with a passionate guild master.
---
you should stop responding to people. You're just making shit up now to support your side.
---
&gt;Because they want to play people they see
---
What the fuck does this even mean?
---
I fail to see how one can have a rivalry when there is no competition.
---
Thanks for responding. It seems that this method is the common way to go. I can imagine it’s such a challenge with people who are loyal and love the Guild see people win loot and leave the guild for others. It must be real trouble at times seeing potentially undeserving people win over hard work and commitment.
---
Any streamer who actually goes onto a pvp server deserves the ganking.
---
...well that was awkward. Anything else you care to share?
---
That works too. They should hire you or something.
---
&gt;Chomping at the bit for any opportunity to escape, even if for a little while
---
Is that why you make your life about video games? So you can escape the crushing reality that no one cares about you and that you have accomplished literally nothing, only being a consumer while contributing nothing to the society that has created the things that you love?
---
;) no fucks given mate. That fucking dance they do hnnnng
---
Still thinking on how to do the SFK part solo. 
---
According to some comments you can open the cell for the door opener from above. If you're lvl 23+ you should be able to lesser invis potions.
---
Or I do it the classic way. Look for paladins between 20-23 and form a paladin only taskforce.
---
...have an up-vote, you weird internet stranger. And good day!
---
Love it, but the +10% regen and +10% regen in combat bonuses that troll has would fit this nicely.
---
im probably going to make more than one char, first one will be rogue for sure, then maybe a hunter after, i dont want to make the first char super easy to level because i dont want to get sick of it before my hype wears off if that makes sense lol
---
Absolutely, it's an essential part of the experience, isn't it? I'm actually planning on leveling two characters side by side, one on my own and one with a friend. And for the character I'll be leveling with a friend, I'm thinking we should make a tank &amp; healer combo. Won't be any problem getting a groups together whenever we feel like it then.
---
You can heal any 60 dungeon just fine, though you will really wish you had healing talents while you're doing it.
---
In raids: don't do it. Priests really need talents from both Holy and Disc to heal properly, and you can't get both while you have 31 points in the Shadow tree. 
---
Just be up front with your guild and tell them your situation. Good raid leaders will have a slot for a Shadow Priest. They might still ask you to heal, and if they do ask after you were honest about being Shadow, then you can ask for help with the respec costs :)
---
Is this another rare mount?
---
Nihilum had world first cthun and KT.
---
I love the thought of getting all cozy after lifting weights, having a shake, and just adventuring around.
---
For me it was quite a easy decision. I’m one of the few people who actually like gnomes so ofc i went with gnome. Escape artist is really handy for pvp also which I’m going to be doing a lot .
---
That 5% extra intellect will maybe be like 2 extra frostbolts in lvl 60?, also something that could potentially save you in pvp during a long fight. As you can see I always look at the perks for pvp, in pve I don’t really care, but gnomes still comes out on top there to which is a bonus. If you like gnomes go for gnome. If you can’t stand the little shits it’s better to go human, the racials are not that big of a deal.
---
The only things ill be giving out are my condolences as I aggressively level as fast as I possibly can
---
That's why you play Druid so you can be Leader of the Pack.
---
Gnomes also have very high base intellect which is multiplied by the racial multiplier.
---
Some might prioritze roles
---
In that case it was always tanks healers than dps on loot.
---
Yes.
---
thats a cat
---
O.o
---
u rite
---
Well I suppose it makes sense to try to build up their support classes. Ideally I was looking to play a support class this time around the park, I’ve always been a dps chart higher but I felt too much like an expendable player and I want to really settle in to a guild and find home there.
---
Play an Aus server. To my knowledge we don’t have any big streamers to worry about but you’ll have to deal with 250-300ms. Experience wow how we experienced it in vanilla!
---
Wait...you guys were using containers?  That explains everything.  Good thing I'm a full functioning adult now and know what a toilet is.
---
Seen your other comments and they are filled with hate. Cant take you seriously.
---
I’ll enjoy playing my retail wow with a lot of my friends who are not planning to “relive” a disaster that classic was. I’ll probably give it a shot, played horde since 1.9, I might try Dwarf Priest. (Its classic so a priest can only be dwarf (fear ward) or undead(wotf) and holy specced, am I right ?)
---
Until your pet gets an armor reducing debuff. 
---
Both are needed!
---
It's the same engine with some minor tweaks.  Will run on a toaster still.
---
I already did this back in the day. I would do pushups every loading screen and this was on some 90s level desktops so you know I had some serious gains back then.
---
That is true, but i remember that literally every rogue in all my parties rolled need on that dagger, must’ve ran it about a thousand times :)
---
They're still doing it. It's not even a hybrid thing anymore; that's totally gone on all classes. They just don't know what to do with it
---
Dont forget purple-redish hair and an inherent disdain for cis-white males.
---
My last guild was always high and you could hear the raid leader hitting a bong before getting in the zone. Real horde shit ya know
---
Sorry, but you don’t get to be bitalentsual in vanilla. You have to choose like the rest of us.
---
Sit back because this is a long one. Everything you need to know about BRD, a little bit of lore, every single quest, every single boss, and some stuff in between. Hope you guys enjoy. For those that have watched my previous videos, let me know what you think of the format change. Thanks!
---
If you want a self-healing tank, then you want to play a Resto Druid (8/11/32) or a Feral/Resto Druid (0/30/21). Both are legitimately amazing tanks in 5 mans. Better than a pure Feral build IMO.
---
This doesn't work in raids however. You get killed in 1 shot if you drop out of bear form to self-heal in a raid. But it doesn't sound like you're trying to raid with that Last Stand / Lifestealing build anyway.
---
Was in high school last time and loved it. Can't wait to give it as much time as I am able.
---
Married now. Full time demanding job. No kids thankfully. Wife won't be cool, no matter how much I prep her ahead of time.... I'm just gonna stay up late when she goes to sleep.
---
Unless you get a Tony Gazelle Freestyle #NoChanges
---
steeps
---
Good luck, most guilds the MT is the guild leader or a close friend. I've seen VERY few if any guilds have a MT that wasn't someone actively running a portion of the guild.
---
Marriage is for suckers.
---
You may need to re-read what you quoted, because I didn't specify this thread or reference any specific thread.
---
Wands really aren't important while leveling.  More like a stat stick in later levels than anything.  During leveling a priest and a warlock in vanilla the wand was literally the last ditch attempt for damage (that was basically never used) when you were bone dry of mana and on cooldowns.  Absolutely not something I would ever consider buying from anyone for any reason.  It is seriously a waste of gold considering how important mounts are in comparison.
---
Oh man, wait until you here how I say Thaurrissan. 14 years of saying the name wrong has burned itself into my brain
---
It's still a maybe, I'm doing some testing of different things on pservers. Either way, I'm not planning to keep tailoring at 60, but for leveling it seems good for A) bags and  B) for a secondary set of healing gear so I can focus most of my quest rewards etc. on dps pieces but heal 5mans *easier* while leveling.
---
Will probably switch to engineering at 60, but from my testing engineering doesn't do much for you while leveling. Considered going double gathering but the economy at launch isn't going to be in full swing, so want to make things that I'll actually use for myself.
---
no one coming to your birthday party is enough to make you slip rounds in the draft

And here I am saving for my first uw monitor to place on bottom with my current 27inch above it. Figure wow should be a good game to dual screen

I’m gonna start coming to you for all my WoW questions. Answers don’t get anymore informative than this.

Shoutout to all gaymer relations! We’ll be playing together 🌈
---
I must have been 18 back then... shits changed
---
I change my mind a lot these days on what class to play, but I always feel like I go back to Warlock. With that being said, I’m actually most concerned about which faction to play.
---
I know that, as Horde, I wouldn’t have to deal with WotF and I could have the added bonus of stun resist. I love orcs, but have been tempted a bit by undead. I like the way both races look.. each in their own way.
---
However, I know that there will be a lot more warlocks on horde side and, without salvation, raiding will be a bit more rough. With that being said I do like the fact that, as alliance, I’d have less competition. I have less play time than when I was younger, so less competition isn’t a bad thing. Though, I’d have to choose human despite gnomes having better racial abilities. Never have been able to stand gnomes.
---
As for PvP, I always seem to put this big emphasis on 1v1 while really... I guess it doesn’t matter that much. This leads me to want to play horde. That, and I like how orcs look most of the time. I also like the way human warlocks look. Plus they fit most mounts better.
---
I know it’s been talked about a lot, but maybe someone has some first hand experience that they think would help guide me? Any viewpoints would help and be appreciated.
---
I do know it’s from godfather 3. Regardless this is more of a sopranos meme.
---
Lmfao
---
This was me. I went from lean 200 pounds 6'1. To over 300 and miserable. I've since gotten more healthy. Ain't gonna happen this time around
---
You'll probably be happier with your current 27" on the side than up above. I tried that setup myself and ended up switching to it on the side, it's much better.
---
I then ended up getting a 2nd 27" for the other side and mounted it all on one big VESA bar. It's fantastic.
---
If that's the case, you made a blanket statement based on a premise supported only by your own assumption. That is called "circular reasoning", and constitutes a logical fallcy.
---
Look, I see what message you are trying to convey here. It's commendable. You advocate for people being civil to each other.
---
And I am right there with you.
---
But "being nice" does not entail "accept every opinion unchallenged, on the off chance that there may be some dicks in the discussion demographic". That's not how it works. I am perfectly within the realm of reason, when I criticise threads that repeat the same old nonsensical babbling about "features" in Classic that go against the mission statement of Classic.
---
And even if there is a dick in such a thread, that wouldn't devalidate my critcial contribution.
---
You are not prepared!!
---
Like, I have a question. Do Druids go oom anyway, even if they innervate themselves?
---
I’m so conflicted 
---
I’ve been waiting for this game to be announced for so long 
---
But when it finally was announced my computer stopped working and now I don’t know how much it’ll cost me to get a new one that’ll be able to run the game
---
So pissed...
---
I smoked while I played in a shitty one bedroom apartment. Probably drank a whole bottle of crown Royal a night along with two packs of smokes. Honestly I don't know how I lived thru it
---
I guess they'll have to change it since they're legally obligated to. That's really lame of the red cross..
---
&gt;but saying you're happy for the old talent system essentially because it is less cumbersome is ridiculous.
---
Wrong. Telling other people that their videogame is wrong because you like your videogame better, is ridiculous.
---
If I like Apple Pie, and you like Cherry Pie, and I tell you "You are wrong, your pie is ridiculous"...that's the level of stupidity in your post.
---
Damn, Talona's screenshots are the best. Super high-res and of course it's always nice to see my old guildmates in DnT &amp; Drama.
---
Ion was the guy that did the math.
---
&gt; there will never be an expansion pack for this game, ever. bliz has already said that new content will be released for free with your subscription. and hero classes does not equal higher level cap. it means more specialized, generally harder to play classes, for the players that have mastered the existing classes. there prob never will be a level cap increase as that would make existing content way too easy. 
---
Oh, my.
---
Richard Simmons could make a comeback with this plan
---

&gt;What are your thoughts on the smite spec as patched for Classic? 
---
It's really simple:
---
**Our thoughts on the matter don't matter. What matters is the thoughts of the people you play with.**
---
If your guild is okay with it, it's okay.
---
If your guild isn't okay with it, it's not okay. Either respec or find a guild that is okay with it.
---
Classic is, above all, a community driven game.
---
Not really, breaking the functionality that addons like that use will cause most other addons to function too sadly.
---
I'd love to play it but with the advancements of addons, guides, familiarity, bots etc these days I can't imagine it'll feel the same as before. 
---
Plus with work, waifu and children as a regular subject matter I doubt I'd hit cap again. Loved classic during the time though. Very fond memories.
---
Foolish comment. Priests become so much more efficient with wands and your first talent points should go wand specialization if you can get a wand early. The earlier the better as wands will out dps your spells for quite a bit in the early levels. Early rotation is smite/mb and wand to death coupled with spirit tap and you'll never have to drink while solo leveling.
---
This has to be the worst use of this meme I’ve ever see.
---
Make a macro /startattack. Works for me.
---
Hell yeh! I got a good laugh just from your comment. I agree
---
What do you think modern macros and addons means? The game has changed a lot over the last 14 years, the addon API is no different. As someone who has developed addons for both versions I can tell you that no vanilla addons will work and it might be too much work to get them running.
---
A bigass survey with 10k votes that doesn't take into account actual game experience, is more than likely based on a biased demographic (PServer Players, people hyped for Classic, Vanilla Players).
---
I am not downtalking anyones contribution here (after all, I participated :P) but I doubt that survey will accurately reflect what will be going on in reality.
---
You mean hogging the red cross symbol for the great work they do? "No, lets care more about our video game then people literally dying because of war, famine and natural disasters." As if a red cross gave you much more immersion then they get out of hogging the red cross and crescent. The only reason it is the one and only health symbol besides  red hearts is because of the Red Cross in the first place.
---
Each national red cross or crescent is a organisation in itself and can lend lend aid to other national organisations when called upon, if the committe decides something it has little to do with the work a national Red Cross or Red Crescent does.
---
Do not blame each 190 Red cross or Crescent organisation because of one national organisation being shitty or because the committe decides to hold on to a red cross that they have an actual use for besides entertainment, it seems extremely petty to care more about having a specifik mark for your health or healing in a game compared to what they are trying to achive with it
---
But no matter that, which organisation are you giving money to since you stopped giving to them in 2008?
---
You should be able to run it on a very cheap laptop. It’s not a graphically intensive game
---
Holy spec.  Smite+Holy Fire.  Hang out with warriors as they tend to draw attention.  You can Heal and dps at the same time.  Avoid direct confrontation because you are basically wet toilet paper.  
---
PVP is a bag of shit and there is no right spec or way to do it.  As long as you can be effective with your spec you can survive.
---
That fucking hashtag, I love it man
---
They just mentioned "Starting zones" whatever they define those as. 1-10 is probably the safe bet, but could be the 1-6, or even 1-20 zones so it would be like the demo.
---
No its the Geneva Convention

It's good for screenshots... and not much else.

Like said rogues and warriors are high in demand but also in supply, this means If youve got your entire pre raid BiS youre golden. But while a mage might get brought in half of his no chance youll be brought with the mountain of completion you got.
---
Warrior gear is also proper expensive
---
\^  yea a laptop should suffice, especially on classic graphics mode. I hope it works out for you though!

Wands are one of the most important things in leveling, especially a priest. And the point is exactly to avoid becoming bone dry of mana ever, to keep the leveling as efficient as possible. That's the reason priests also get the wand specialization as pretty much their first talent.
---
Stay strong brother
---
two questions I’m not sure about
---
1) what professions should I work on as a warrior? Also I’ll be playing with three friends all the way through and one is a healer so I don’t think first aid will be needed correct? Should I do blacksmithing and mining? 
---
2) if I plan on tanking 5 mans and dps in raids/questing should I go arms or fury? I like arms for mortal strike but I really can’t decide, also for PvP I don’t know which spec is best?
---
Wand makes up about 60-80% of a Priest's damage output from level 5 to 40. From then on it's about 50% of their damage output.

So I have the wowhead page book marked, but is there a way to get updates to my phone so I know when they make a blue post?
---
I continue to be amazed by how young many of you are. I was a decade older than you are now when Vanilla came out.
---
But I'm not sure I see the problem you're describing. Two of my girlfriends are likely to be spending a significant amount of time playing as well, and the other two certainly have independent enough lives that it's not as if they're going to be sitting around pining. Either way, I cannot imagine the idea of them begrudging me spending time doing something that I enjoy.
---
Play a dps warripr and tank 5 mans. Thats how I did it. Best of both worlds. Dont invite any other plate wearers. Easy life.
---
As if druid loot wasn't already stupid easily attained.

---
&gt;OPTIONALLY switch to vw
---
Dont write a guide
---
i dont disagree that BRE does well in pve, but procrates are not the same for classic, so that could be a factor.
---
Frost/fire mage would be a good choice as well.
---
Who reaches 60 first, you or your char?
---
Are you ok
---
Yep, that's what I said. Nhl had two world firsts, C'thun &amp; KT, and neither really competitive. DnT had 8 and none were from bugs/hotfixes and two were very impressive: one being Viscidus where they killed him and no one could match their kill for weeks and more than that I think they were the only guild to kill him pre-nerf. And then they had world 4H 1st which was the wall in the hardest raid in Vanilla, Naxx.  
---
Each raid had a wall. Most bosses were killed in rapid succession up until one very hard boss. In MC it was Rag and a tiny bit Domo. BWL it was Nef. AQ was C'thun, Ouro, and Visc, so DnT here again. And Naxx it was 4H as Saph &amp; KT fell quickly after 4H.  
---
I wouldn't even rank Nhl in top 3 Vanilla as Fury had an impressive 11 world firsts, but none of them were walls and only 2 were from Naxx. And then there's Ascent, which only had 3 world firsts but one of those was a wall, Rag. 
---
Of course you have to give respect to Conquest who came out swinging early and took 6 bosses early in MC. And then there's Afterlife with 4 world firsts, 2 early in Naxx and 2 in MC, one being Domo.  
---
Nhl might only be ranked 5 in Vanilla, but they would hit their peak in TBC...
---
I’m with the other guy.  Single class raids were people fooling around in mostly epic gear towards the release of TBC and only happened in MC, which by that point had been down-tuned.
---
If you wanted to do Naxx, or AQ, you needed to bring the DPS, and that meant speccing a certain way and prepping.  It wasn’t piss easy in any sense and if people came with their talents all fucked up, it could really screw things up.  
---
Moonkin was a fine a class to have a single one of to put in a group with the mages.  More than one or two in a 40 man Naxx run though and you might find certain bosses aren’t dying fast enough.  Spec very much mattered, just ask any holy priest if there was a difference between going full holy vs. putting a bunch of points into shadow so you could farm raid mats without respeccing.
---
I am expecting to be more so at the 2-3 hours a day mark, what with having the standard career wife kids combo.  - Probably up to 6-10 hours on the weekend depending on family plans.
---
I got my pepperoni cocks ready for Classic
---
Sad thing bout this is that most of you already on day 194
---
Read the post. Im going 2h fury lol. Flurry, dw, bt, all of it.
---
&gt; addons, guides, familiarity, bots  
---
All of these existed in Vanilla. 
---
Addons were more powerful than what we will get with the new API (looking at you decursive / healbot), maybe we had less guides but much more bots (I'll take the guides over the bots any day).
---
Even familiarity : do you think we went blind when they opened fresh servers ?
---
They probably knew you weren't holy if you didn't drop lightwells or go spirit of redemption on wipes.  
---
I assume your composite spec was something like 21/25/5?
---
Im guessing the hybrid tax is more aimed at the fact that you don't need to level a new character should you want to change your role at some point. The time spent leveling a pure dps class is wasted if you don't find it funny. That said, I think Blizzard could have done a better job at making hybrid dps more "Okayer".
---
Yeah probably a nightmare to farm lol, definitely cool for rp though.
---
I have been at least monthly letting her know about my excitement for classic since last year.  Already made sure she is fine and okay with me spending 1 week of vacation time for just myself, and knows around the time frame when it will be, and knows I will let her know ahead of time when I will be MIA.  Its taken a few conversations in a row for some months, but yea she is starting to remember those together and knows summer is coming.
---
Stop propagating this.
---
Classic will run on a modern client, so it will require the same laptop than WOW retail (a Geforce 1050 afaik).
---
Don't worry, his gf is actually a gremlin
---
I read this as "joke of all trades".
---
no changes
---
And good riddance tbh. They got hybrids right in tbc, and life was good.
---
Yup, my wife's going to level a shaman with mine, solo warrior leveling is fucking rough
---
If you play as a Transfluid night elf, you can do whatever you want!
---
Idk, I honestly don't find the leveling experience that bad. I personally enjoy it, and have found arms to tactical master then fury the best, at least for my playstyle. I'm still unsure what i want to respec to for 40-60, ill probably dnd up grabbing ms.
---
Thou shalt have no other Games before me. Exodus 20:1-17
---
Technically it hasn't been put on any of the CDNs yet (as far as I can tell). This information was gleaned via querying the URL [http://us.patch.battle.net:1119/wow\_classic\_beta/versions](http://us.patch.battle.net:1119/wow_classic_beta/versions) and seeing that the build config part has been filled out.
---
Unfortunately since the CDNs don't appear to be filled out we can't use this information retrieve a build config and hence we can't use it to spin it out to a possible file listing.
---
In saying that however I find it interesting Blizzard is using the TACT system to put up version information  rather then the new system Ribbit. It possible means there's classic beta version and build config information out there but I dunno how to query the patch server using Ribbit.
---
untill all the warlocks decide to collude and min bid so they have more DKP than the mages for the azure song mage blade
---
But still better than a master of one
---
Nope, those things don't bother me at all. I took a job that was basically isolation for 3 years and it actually didn't bother me at all.
---
What’s the discord?
---
because it had the same Artstyle like WC3 and people like it. I also think that the Artstyle is timeless like 2d games.
---
Speaking of 2D games, Secret of Mana got a remaster with 3D graphics and people did not like it. It is not always better to get the best graphics, the artstyle of a game is really important.
---
Dedicated warriors and Rogues are ALWAYS in demand.
---
Those are the classes that benefit most from consumables in the game and the difference between a rogue/warr using consumes vs one that doesn't is monumental.
---
If you are a good player that also farm consumables prior to the right then you will never struggle to find a spot.
---
I'll still roll a druid but I'm crushed that we won't have tree form until TBC.
---
It’s not classic without the old graphics and animations.
---
For instance, the undead fast stealth walk in retail looks retarded, while the gliding one in vanilla is the bomb.
---
So is the sound and animation when poison triggers, and crit sounds of ambush/backstab.
---
Ooooooh yeah.  Right right, I forgot tree form wasn't a vanilla thing.   
---
Thats sadness.
---
You and me both OP.
---
The problem is that Blizzard is not really releasing enough infos. there is no Alpha that is streamed or anything. So people will post the same thing over and over again.
---
Everyone needs gear lol. Anger management is great for retaining ragd too. I can't tell you how many times you start off fights with extra rage from the last and just faceroll mobs. Its greaf for pulling one, then pulling 3 with the pooled rage. I'm getting flurry, dw, bt, so ill have the full benefits from the main pve dps spec. I should be fine. If it goes south obviously ill change it up and try new things, i just hatd playing the same exact shit everyone else is playing. At that point, why even play.
---
Everyone should get first aid. 
---
Many people level fury until 40, then respecc for MS. 
---
MS is generally sent as better for pvp
---
I played a mage in vanilla and leveled a Warlock alt to the mid 20s, but I found Warlocks a little boring. It really just depends on what you enjoy playing, I think.
---
Cannibalize though:P
---
Yeh, I played from beta. But I don't think any of which were anywhere near as advanced as what we have now! And thottbot wasnt exactly a comprehensive guide either! 
---
Disclaimer, I wish I knew about bots back then. Even things like profession and gathering addons, azeroth auto pilot etc is going to be a huge difference.
---
The #1 tank on Genjuros eu horde left mid naxx progress to join nihilum and ended up killing KT world first with them.
---
It killed the whole guild, and after that the whole horde faction on genjuros eu.
---
Guy was a legend to 14 year old me though, ended up basing my future username on him (was named neeko on genjuros, naeko in nihilum)
---
How much does one of those cost??
---
Sorry have never bought a PC
---
They have a Classic Bot for Discord servers, so in theory if you wanted it only for yourself you could set up a Discord specifically for that Bot. We use it on our Guild Page and I got the Blue Post message 27 seconds after its upload.
---
same will happen with male streamers.
---
Yeah raid nights ill probably be rolling a slam spec or just good ol 2h fury with impale. The "blood" spec is mainly for wpvp or other outdoor activities. I'm very much not the druid type. I'm excited to see bear tanks though nonetheless, definitely nice to see something other than the same warrior with a different name and haircut every dungeon.
---
For me Blizzard should offer both modes: by default use legacy graphics but let the possibility to use updated graphics for people who got used to them and prefer them.
---
Should make everybody happy right?
---
best thing blizz could do is do make extra streamer server were only the streamers with their guild can join. Streamers will destroy a lot of server otherwise.
---
&gt;You mean hogging the red cross symbol for the great work they do?
---
**The red cross has been used as a symbol denoting "medical aid" or "medical supplies" since 1880. As far as I, and every being capable of rational thought, am concerned, it is a symbol in the public domain, which belongs to all of mankind.**
---
No one, no matter what he does or how great his contributions are, has a right to slap a (C) onto that, same as no one has a copyright on the letter 'A'.
---
I don't care what contributions they make, or what they have done in the past. If you think you can take something like that symbol, and pretend it's yours, you're a dick organisation, and unworthy of support.
---
&gt;Do not blame each 190 Red cross or Crescent organisation because of one national organisation being shitty
---
In german, they say _"Der Fisch stinkt vom Kopfe."_ ... the fish starts smelling from the head. If the ICRC allows it's national organisations to do such bullshit, they are all guilty, end of story.
---
It's easy, you see the damage without the debuff/buff of the raid, then you see it with it. Vanilla isn't about personal DPS, its about the Raid. It's just a bad mentality to think individual meters mean everything. If your raid leader doesn't appreciate the buffs classes brings, you need a new guild/raid.
---
Assuming this isn’t sarcasm (or just a joke), it’s actually hard to say. If the laptop is really 8 years old it’s gonna struggle playing anything.
---
Also, Alienware is more branding than anything and always has been. It’s like beats by dre. They’re decent headphones but way overpriced. Gaming laptops in general are like that with a few exceptions.
---
Yeah I’m hoping it doesn’t release until the end of summer so I have enough time to save up for one 
---

How was Brokentooth nerfed? Are you talking about generalizing attack speed in TBC?  
---
Or did you mean Lupos?
---
Soooo many people will get lost in here. And torch room, oh man... Retail people have no idea what's waiting for them.
---
i'll probably skip out on sfk/rfc. everything else tho is on the list
---
It's very hard to say which you prefer until you actual see them in action. People at the moment are deciding on the idea of Vanilla graphics, and the idea of BFA graphics which probably won't line up with what they actually prefer in game once they're playing and have the option of trying both.
---
Literally takes 5min to make first wand if you know what you are doing. So if you are asking because you want to buy, then you should make it yourself. Should be able to get it around lvl 9-10. If you are asking because you want to sell them, then yeah, you can probably make a buck.
---
You're right though about fury being by far the optimal pve spec. My statement about prot was simply untrue and I recognize that. But I still believe warriors, when equally geared with most of their competitors &amp; despite switching a few talent points, will generally do equal to greater dps on most fights.
---
The dauntless task of r14 made it pointless to fight other premades, sadly.  
---
By the time someone *MAYBE* wins the usually 30mins+ WSG games, you could've stomped 5 games vs randos.  
---
There either need to be VERY sever penalties for not joining, or kill honor being upped and not diminishing within the same game, maybe even win honor needs to be upped vs other full groups.
---
MT typically gets loot priority in vanilla. Tank survivability and threat is a limiting factor early on. The MT is the most important spot in the raid though (if your MT leaves after you funnel gear to him, you're fucked), so the MT will usually be the GM or a friend/officer.
---
Love when people are giving opinion on something they have no clue about :)
---
"smite spec" is basically just 2 talent points (searing light).  Well, you can go deep into disc for Force of Will but that's a pretty big sacrifice to give up spiritual guidance which is a big spell power hit. 
---
Anyhow, I dunno about in pvp.  It seems tough to me because smite is a 2 second cast with no range talent and no crit talent like mages/warlocks get.  
---
You might be able to attrition people but you wont be bursting anyone down and kicks might fuck you up (though being able to drop a mind blast if kicked is still nice).  
---
The smite spec is pretty good for farming.  Holy nova is decent aoe, and if you're chain farming single mobs spirit tap and spiritual guidance make for some big holy fires.
---
Lower than zero effort. Shame.
---
Just level paladin. The perfect class for doing "other things" while levelling.

---
TBC had many issues Classic didn't have.
---
The world felt smaller due to making Kalimdor and EK mostly obsolete after the leveling phase
---
Resilience Gear was a huge mistake. In Vanilla PvP and PvE were more connected.  In TBC it's two completely different progression paths.
---
The horrible lore changes that were the beginning of the end for WoW's story
---
Homogenization of Horde and Alliance
---
Flying mounts as you have mentioned
---
No 40 man raids anymore
---
Overall I'd say Vanilla &gt;TBC
---
Vanilla feels the most complete out of all versions of WoW. TBC is great and was probably the best time in WoW to be a hardcore endgame raider. But overall I think TBC was a step in the wrong direction. They took a big shit on the lore and the homogenization really started with TBC.
---
I'm going to test this tonight. I doubt it would be 50% but I'm interested to know.
---
Do they typically become officer as the guild leader wants to essentially give them a sense of responsibility in which reducing the risk of them leaving or feeling unimportant? If this makes sense?
---
!!!!
---
If I play a "rezzer" class, I'll make sure to put lazy druids at the bottom of my rez priority list!
---
The Horde experience is just flat out better for you as an individual. Better quests, better items from quest rewards, and better overall racials. You also don't have to fight against Shaman, who are a nightmare for classes that aren't Warlocks. And Alliance doesn't have very many Warlocks thanks to those aforementioned racials.
---
I'll be playing Alliance, though, because Alliance is better as a team. Paladins are the best support class in the game. They make everyone around them better.

I got three kids.  And once the last one is in bed I got time 3days to play until 01:00 (I’m to old to go up at 0600 after playing to 01:00 more then two to three times a week). I make sure I spend some nights with my wife as marriage is important.  I do play approx 1h every night to wind down after a stressful day.  
---
So my plan.  Well same as always keep family happy, manage my work, keep my friends around and then if there is time over play until I’m to tired.
---
I think 5% racial will work out to like 10ish int difference (the 5% and 3 higher starting int).  Almost sure the 5% is based on base int, not from gear.  It's basically a single enchant.

Not overpowering but whether it's negligible is up to you to decide.

I hear ya! Yeah mine knows the first week is going to be me having absolutely zero life. Day 1 will be a 24-36 hour stream depending on when classic actually launches and then after that ill be streaming normal times + playing on my laptop on the couch. So at least we're together a bit.

Can you go more into weapon set swapping? Is that like, swapping weapons mid-combat or something?

They might only need a stress test to see how to handle early sharding, and make sure the game is good to go. Since it's running on a very good platform and they've managed to import everything correctly from the 1.12 version.

hopefully it'll just be a stresstest beta and a july release anyway!

Even in TBC, Boomkins, Feral cats, and Ret paladins were rather underpowered, at least in PvE. Shamans had it pretty good, though.

Dude runs it down and says basically every raid boss is tankable by a druid without much issue.

Typically yes.
---
Boomkins and feral were at least playable, and druids and paladins could tank well by then.
---
My primary gripe with tbc was raid design fucking with melee dps a lot.
---
You’re 100% right. Don’t know why I thought the second dungeon set came out with AQ 40 (probably because of the step that took you to Silithus). That was 1.9, Beckon filmed this on the 1.10 PTR.

My guild didn't have bidding in that sense. All items had a set price (Say tier cost 50 dkp (random #). Who ever had the most dkp and "bid" got the item for the set price (tier was 50 dkp). If no one wanted it then it was forced on someone who needed it at that cost. So all tier gear cost the same to everyone no matter the class so no manner of colluding could lower the price. That warlock would pay 50 dkp regardless to the point of it being forced on to them for 50 dkp. So unless you passed on all gear and someone else always took it you couldn't really game the system.
---
They need to change out alot of people in the retail team to make that happened. They dont have the mindset
---
I personally don't like the new animations, they feel clunky and bumpy, the old ones were much more smooth.
---
If we could get higher res textures and models *without* new animations, I wouldn't mind it but I'd rather have everything old that everything new like retail.
---
Lightforge &amp; Elements sets will still drop for the opposite faction because they don't have a class restriction. Quite a few caster mail items will drop for Alliance actually, but they aren't totally useless because Paladins can still use them.
---
Nothing with a class restriction will drop for the opposite faction.
---
I actually think its more likely that Activi$ion Bli$$ard jumps on the mobile mmo bandwagon and develops some scuffed mobile WoW.
---
I was either really naive or just ignorant tbh, but there didn't seem to be anything that said there was a tram.
---
That's hilarious. Probably slightly better than my attempt :)
---
!remindme 1 day
---
Umm, no? It's a long process because there is lot of fiddling and testing to see if they got it right but the bulk of the work is automated. They are not doing everything by hand. :) They convert the original 1.12 Vanilla data into the current format they are using now and update the appropriate routines from the original 1.12 source to the current client.
---
(I'm a game developer and I have also looked into the original Vanilla WoW data formats for curiosity's sake.)

LOWER THAN ZERO EFFORT. SHAME.
---
Depends on the direction of the wind. Sometimes herbs will sell more, sometimes the potions will sell more. There will be an average base price of herbs you can eventually work off of so you can buy when they're cheap, sell when they're high and determine if it's smart to make potions.
---
W00t
---
For me the new animations look way too bouncy. And the models look too cartoony.
---
Also the old windfury/poison etc look way more awesome than the new ones.
---
I hear you
---
vanilla kooks, worst kind of kooks of all for me
---
Private servers.
---
I have no idea where my life will be in 2 years. I might not get to Naxx on the real thing. But I can knock out a few bosses on a private server before classic comes out.
---
If you're starting now? Naxx might be a reach... but you can always try something new. Different class/race/faction than you plan to play in classic. It won't ruin the experience. If anything, it will make you appreciate Blizzard's finished product even more.
---
ITT: people not relizing shadowpriest runs oom after one mob.  
---
@OP, you can heal as any spec, but not being able to cast downranked greater heals properly will cripple you big time
---
Private servers have inflated armor values so unless classic wow buffs the raids the proc might not be that useful against bosses.
---
As you say yourself, all discussion on server economy are purely speculative at this point. So I'll try to answer your question the best I know how.  
---
If
---
A = cost of crafting materials (including training/ reciepe cost)  
---
B = Auction House deposit fee  
---
C = Auction House cut  
---
D = sell price  
---
Then a succesful sale is;
---
D + B - (A + B + C) = X  
---
Where X is your profit.
---
Every stage of BiS for Mages is so ugly, the reason I would go with gnome is simply that I am so small, that I don't have to see my gear all the time
---
I am a memer. I like to play weird builds. Just wondering if anyone has anything I haven’t already thought of. Let me know!
---
Thanks
---
I've only seen it drop once in my entire vanilla career and private server career combined, that is a lot of Ragnaros kills.  
---
With the proc up, all clothes are zero armor, means you do character sheet damage to their faces and souls.
---
Depends on stuff we don't know about yet (sharding).
---
Exploration takes like an hour or so? There's youtube videos that go over it.
---
The Dwarf excavation site outside of Camp T can be healed by the Alliance.
---
Rather then that, Classic becomes incredibly popular, and in 10 years a small community will ask for Classic BFA
---
Exploration screws you because you won’t be able to afford any skills afterwards. Don’t do it
---
Swapping between slow 2hander and 1h + shield mostly. Will allow you to go on the Defensive in PvP or if the tank dies with Shield Wall and Shield Block.
---
I'd rather play Classic on the 38" ultra wide 4k I have at work than a 144hz 24-27". This damn monitor is a beast and 60 fps is well enough.
---
That's the joke, you keep doing the same stupid shit and never really turn away from doing that stupid same shit.
---
we had a min price but also a bid, so you could bid say 80 to make sure you got the piece if you really wanted it.

[This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/alu1bz/dumb_thursday_math_rushing_out_of_starting_zone/?st=jv6bm525&amp;sh=bb68cac8) by /u/awesometographer is about the best answer you're going to get.
---
Ive done every dungeon with my current character, except wailing caverns and ragefire chasm (I play alliance)
---
The quest XP is good, it breaks the monotony of questing, it teaches you how to play your class in group.
---
LOL.
---
It is indeed very wrong and it's been proven that the human eye pretty much have unlimited "FPS" capabilities, it's how fast our brain is that sets the limit.
---
“People of taste”. Lmao is this a hidden diss on those who don’t like boomkins?
---
I think ill lose weight instead of gaining it from eating one meal a day
---
Cheers will check it out!
---
Yea, since BC, I've barely touched anything beyond some heroics. Felt like a waste.
---
Because the new animations and models make my Undead look like a floaty Disney Princess who was caught in the headlights of a car. New rigging made my Blood Elf put her arm through her leg while stealth standing. 
---
On top of the dislike for the "spirit" of the new models. You have a most clash between them and the gear. All the old gear is going to have low res muddy textures. With new models you will have bright "HD" head models with all those low res textures. 
---
A lot of remasters aren't remaking the old game with the "spirit" in mind. They try to stay true to the original while updating the old textures and models as best as possible. There are a lot of changes that remasters/remakes did that people hated because they were different.
---
Just a heads up: revealing you have a husband is not the same as revealing you are female =P
---
PvP was solid in MoP for post-cata WoW
---
Travelling all the way to Orgrimmar to do RFC as an alliance player is a right of passage imo. Especially as a Paladin, nothing quite beats tactical usage of BoP to aggro the guards and let your group get in with less dying.
---
I see your point and understand it completely. I just don't see why not just let every person choose themselves? just have it be toggleable? I really like the new models and especially the new animations they just look a lot more fluid and natural to me. A bit annoying that the remove the option completely even though it won't affect anyone else.
---
Was thinking about sharding and how effective it will be. For example, the boar quest at gnome starting area gets lockdowned by few players doing it at the same time. So unless sharding really thins the herd there are going to be issues.
---
All is good as long as there is always a cold one in the fridge.
---
That might seem like an easy solution.
---
But I want my character to look like how I intended on other players screen as well, also if I decide to watch movies or streams, I want to watch *vanilla*, not some mix of 1 polygon armor on HD models.
---
I am not sure why this is a response to my comment. Or even the parent comment. We were not even talking about add-ons.
---
Fair point, thank you.
---
I want my character to look like how I intended on other players screen too, also the immersion breaks when streamers and people who record put up movies with HD graphics.
---
I mean why can’t they just remake vanilla, nothing more, nothing less. Just remake the game we loved and that’s that.
---
I've played both in PvP and I'd say both of you have points. 
---
A Warrior with decent gear can literally charge, MS -&gt; WW/OP -&gt; Exe Priests or Locks (mages just nova and one shot you), not to mention how much of an advantage a Warrior has against a Rogue assuming both don't have CDs. A Rogue with all CDs will probably always win, you're right. But that's like 4-6 times during a BG. A Warrior will shred a Rogue 1v1 assuming similar gear and no CDs.

I built one a mini-itx computer for $300 a couple years ago using this subreddit. Couple things to save money: 
---
* Be honest with yourself. Do you really need the CPU with 8 multi threading cores for your porn and WoW habits? And do you play cutting edge games on max that warrant a newer GPU card, or is a discount card from 4-5 years ago good enough(or better) than what you need?
---
* Sales!!!!! Take advantage of discounts.
---
But... a cheap laptop will play it. I played legion fine on a $300 computer.
---
Noone ever complained about rolling a Mage in vanilla. Great versataile DPS class and always welcome in groups.
---
The ppl that played alot on privat servers already know pvp overall will be a shitshow.
---
With no bgs in p2 and ranking for the extrem players delayed, it will be a horror for casuals, 48 zones will just be shut down by hardcore rankers that had time to stack consumables for weeks, everyone will be ganked 5 times for maximum honor, the ppl that belive p2 will have anything resembling interesting fights like TM vs SS or even level 60 vs level 60  are delusional and dont know how the honor system work.
---
Your only hope as a casual is that you will have a small amount of hardcore ppl on your Server so max 1 zone is shut down.
---
And then bgs will start, a typical wow classic server normally isnt this big so there are max 1-2 bgs running. Que Dodging will just kill the pvp, a typical server just has 1 or 2 premade groups per fraction, i would assume at the start its 2-3 but it will be fast reduced to 1 because the rest cant rly compete. And then Que Dodging and random stomping will result in bgs slowling dieing out, cause who ques bgs just to get rofl stomped.
---
My guild used a bear to MT it back then. It was viable.
---
Exactly. Douche canoe over there doesn’t seem to understand stats aren’t changing, but what gear we’ll have available has been narrowed down a bit.
---
Rogues don't suck in BGs. They are exceptionally good defenders for both WSG and AB. Rogues in PvP are all about patience if you want to be successful. This is why some people think/say they "suck" because they don't appreciate that, but simply want to zerg around and Rogues are a poor choice for that style.
---
Unless you play in VR with a TREADMILL like [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9x4iza/i_will_level_160_completely_in_vr_hmd_treadmill/).

 [https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/our-history/the-beginning-of-the-red-cross](https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/our-history/the-beginning-of-the-red-cross)   
---
\&gt;**The red cross has been used as a symbol denoting "medical aid" or "medical supplies" since 1880** 
---
The [**International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement**](https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/how-we-are-run/the-international-movement) started in 1863 and was inspired by Swiss businessman Henry Dunant.
---
The suffering of thousands of men on both sides of the Battle of Solferino in 1859 upset Dunant. Many were left to die due to lack of care.
---
He proposed creating national relief societies, made up of volunteers, trained in peacetime to provide neutral and impartial help to relieve suffering in times of war.
---
In response to these ideas, a committee (which later became the International Committee of the Red Cross) was established in Geneva. The founding charter of the Red Cross was drawn up in 1863.  
---
Its not copyright, its from the Geneve Convention, the Red Cross has to spend resources to this day on teaching people about the red cross's meaning so they dont get fucking bombed, proving that its not a stupid plan to enforce all across the board to atleast in the future make sure that everyone knows what a red cross means.
---
Cheers!
---
You answered your own question in your post bud. It's all speculation. You can't even expect a profit right now.
---
Druid aggro is very high. Only a dual wielding fury/defiance Warrior can even come close.
---
The reason why they are great as backup/secondary tanks on bosses like Patchwerk is that they can easily keep up with threat, since most of their rage comes from their own damage.
---
Meh, the logic for rogues and hunters is that you have so much AGI that you WILL get overpowered anyway so you'd better activate evasion or deterrence : you eat one overpower every 5s but meanwhile you dodge mortal strikes and whirlwinds.
---
I'd expect it can't stunlock and burst an opponent like rogue can in wpvp?
---
Y'all still going for that "boys club" mentality in 2019 huh
---
Its not minor things. Its still the Legion engine.
---
Do you have any example of them shoving religion on people? Every time I've run into this claim there is no examples to be given and even less proof
---
also, it might not be the majority, its just the loudest people.
---
Depends
---
Hey thanks! Won't healing dungeons be hard without resurrect?
---
I'll keep that formula in mind. Do you mind if I copy it to the [excel doc I made a few weeks ago](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1384lv6M3hY4ensedLi8Sua6sDDdfeIZ2GBxVl6SBPOY/edit#gid=1730814515) where I list all required crafting mats?
---
You know it'd be really cool if Classic WoW's community turned towards supporting physical health. 
---
Like I see a lot of silly posts like this but I do hope players do the opposite and take the time to stay physically active. Like workout during downtime and such, either when taking flightpaths, waiting for the priest to show up for the raid, etc.
---
They care more about visuals in game then first aid workers being killed. That or they just dont know the significance of the work the red cross do.
---
All economy is based on speculation. There has to be a venture capitalist here somewhere ;)
---
There's a strange "stigma" around Alliance warlocks in PvP. Yes, horde have tremor and WotF, but Alliance also have paladins and their very strong dispels - Freedom and BoP are godsends (but then again, they can be purged so... yeah.) 
---
You also mentioned 1v1s, so I guess my info isn't really that handy. I was speaking more for wpvp and/or BGs.
---
I am a serial offender of "Grass is alway greener" and constant rerolls in WoW. For Classic, I am having a really hard time locking down my class/role.
---
Goals:
---
1) I want to enjoy the leveling process. I am not trying to rush but I also want to reach 60 within a month or two. It's important that my class choice has flavour and an enjoyable "powering up" feeling as they level.
---
2) I want to Raid casually and do lots of PvP. I don't mind tanking but I think I'd get bored of healing, and with PvP in mind playing a healer would probably lead to lots of respeccing. 
---
3) Currently, the classes I am leaning towards are: Rogue, Warrior, Mage, Warlock. I like Hunter but I don't think I'd want to main one, and Paladin would be an option but I am unsure if my friends are going Hore or Alliance, and I feel like rolling a Paladin to DPS or Tank might make me feel that "Grass is always greener" phenomenon once more.
---
Just remember if you roll a warrior to take up tanking while leveling. There are many pug groups that wont take a dps warrior for 2 major reasons
---
1. Tanks are usually warriors and most have absolutely no desire to share loot which is completely understandable. If you choose to go solely dps, then let the group know you wont roll on any tank gear. That may get you an extra invite here and there
---
2. They have no CC to speak of which is a very big deal in Vanilla. Some pulls can be VERY tough without enough CC.
---
As for raiding, there will be a million warriors so you'll have to accept a rather slow go of getting geared. With all that said, play what you find fun. It's a game after all. Burnout is real in Vanilla and playing a class that isnt fun makes it less like a game and more like a job
---
naw just say some dick clicked on it 5 times as soon as you dropped it. Works best if you blame a rogue because everyone knows that's exactly the sort of thing rogues do.
---
[*burp*](https://i.imgur.com/ZZ2ffkX.png)
---
Basically as you increase in levels say 30+ you will start having to quest in 2-3 zones. Some of those zones will lead you on quests to those zones. The most efficient way to level is when running to the quest area you should kill mobs to and from that area. It may be slower getting to that area but your time is far more efficient.
---
PvE or PvP?
---
Hey I know this is completely random but would you be willing to map out exactly what talents you will be taking by level on this build through a message I would really like to run this build when classic is released
---
as long as you dont bring food on the desk its gonna be fine
---
I don't see the value in the remaking of the game itself, the value with classic is that we get to play an amazing game again. What if for a lot of people that'd be even better if they had some control over graphics of their character. The decision has already been made kinda, we are not getting the 100% exact replica that was vanilla. And IMO that's good because vanilla certainly wasn't perfect so if we can fix some things without messing it up, why not?
---
Yeah, my day 1 is that guy's day 1436.
---
How can anyone play classic without reliving the dread of stv?!! PvP my friend
---
Wow:Reloaded
---
They are great:
---
* arguably the best offtanks for up to 3/4 mobs
---
* best backup tanks because how easy it is to gain threat for them
---
* soak up raid gear that noone wants and get tons of BiS gear on their own time (PvP, crafting etc.)
---
* Higher DPS than prot warriors when tanking \*and\* when not tanking, plus they provide a strong DPS aura.
---
* Prot Warriors take less damage than Ferals, but Ferals generate more threat.
---
* Fury/Defiance warriors take more damage than Ferals, but Ferals generate less threat.
---
* Can tank the majority if not all bosses.
---
* Warriors are optimal for most bosses but Druids have a couple of bosses where they shine too.
---
* Druids generally have to put more work into their class, especially to maintain their core strength: versatility.
---
It will.  C.R.E.A.B.

I've ran MC in some poorly geared PUGs on private servers and couldn't get past Shazzrah. Eventually that PUG turned into a guild and we cleared the whole thing, but it took i think 3-4 resets before we cleared MC, which i find hilarious because people had ZG craft sets and 1.12 talents. The one difference i'd use for vanilla raiding vs later expansions is that it is very unforgiving, MC is still fairly trivial but even the mechanics in MC for some bosses are very unforgiving, someone doesn't do his job however trivial it is you wipe.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQ8w46JOL4
---
It'll run *better* (a little) than the original client.
---
Well, that’s where we disagree, I don’t see adding he models and new animations as “fixing” anything.
---
A week? Lmao, who is upvoting this? That's utter bullshit.
---
I remember running Scolo with some warlock countless times and the Headmaster drops. The druid rolls and wins. Oh,the drama...
---
I remember trying to do it then get spawn camped in the BFD cave
---
getting overrun by horde every time
---
then have people ragequit and wait more time finding replacements
---
an endless circle of suffering
---
Not even close to how bad it is in vanilla. Some hybrids could use like a 5-10% buff or maybe better resource gen, but for the most part you bring them and they do enough (especially for their utility/buffs).
---
In vanilla most of the hybrids could get literally 50% more damage and it would still be a debate on whether you'd bring more than what you need to spread utility around.
---
Any class that can heal - just don't level as prot. If you and your mate wanted to run dungeons to keep up with gear/quests/fun, just tank as... well, literally any other spec. Your damage and rage regen will be much higher, letting you get way more threat, and subsequently let your DPS just blow more shit up.
---
You may take slightly more damage... but you actually take way less damage because stuff dies way faster. It's a weird paradox. Just make sure you keep a 1h/shield around your level.
---
It may be nothing guys, so keep your pants on.
---
I've played 3 servers and gotten ahead each time. You want to 2man level and do starting zone until lvl4, always skip the first quest in starting zone if you can, move straight to the highlvl stuff. 
---
Fx in valley of trials I rush sarkoth to get lvl2, then go back get the quest to kill imps, get back and get quest for the boss in there, my group will be one of the first to kill him and we are out of starting area really quick with lvl4. You can start most of the quests at lvl4 in durotar.
---
90's level desktop.........loading screens.......... pushups during loading screens...........serious gains.........it all makes sense.
---
Just as raid leaders shouldn't think you can't raid at all with some odd specs here and there, acting as they're min maxing kings while they're in a casual guild that raids 1-2 times a week.
---
We had retri paladins, Balance druids, Feral tanks, Shadow DPS here and there. We managed to get almost all raiding content down.
---
What about DC electricity red + and blue -
---
Farm status raiders!
---
So you replace a gimped dps with a gimped healer. I don't really see what difference it makes.
---
You'll be allowed to roll on 2Hs. I think you seriously underestimate how shitty some 2Hs are for other classes and how good they are for rets.
---
It's an extreme example, but look at Sulfuras. Super bad for warriors - Super good for rets. All about those SP scaling procs.
---
Karma crops are doing great this year.
---
Barely? It has the same int and spellpower, but an extra crit and mana restore usage about the size of a greater mana potion that doesn't share potion/mana gem cooldown.
---
The mana use is good for maintaining mana through trash and lowering consumable use during boss fights, but the big difference is the crit, which is worth about 15 spell damage in pre-raid gear and grows to 25-30 come BWL/AQ.
---
I recently ranked to 14 on a private server, and I lost about 5kg in the process, mainly by skipping meals (just forgetting to eat) and stress from bracket pushers. But I guess it’s a different experience for everyone.
---
Sustain how much dps? I believe you, but what specs are you above and below with that strategy (5 minutes sustain).
---
I'd also factor in the time you could spend grinding instead of checking the AH, doing the sums and making and listing the pots.
---
Usually solo questing comes out on top, but if you have a few well organized friends who had a set plan and knew exactly what they were doing then group any/every time
---
But it does effect me. Your HD models don't blend into the world like the old models do. Which means you can have an unfair advantage in pvp encounters because my model will pop off the world making me easier for you to see from a distance or even in cover. On top of that the didn't the animations add some unique animations for certain spells which again would give an advantage because there is no cast bars to know what spell is being casted and all spells use the same base cast animations.
---
I recall me and my best bud, both rogues would quest together. Sometimes it would take a few extra kills to get whatever item i needed or he needed to, but who know if I was solo, I may had to wait as well. A beak here a pelt there.
---
Think of kill swapping to, just because you kill it, it may not be your kill, so there's that, kinda gotta stay close.
---
Don't forget 2 pieces of loot per boss.
---
With remasters, you still can go back and play the original. (Heck, in Starcraft: Remastered, you can switch to the original graphics with a button.)
---
Not so with Vanilla/Classic WoW. It's not available to play (pservers don't count). So the first priority is (and should be) to make it available to play as it was (or at least as close as possible).
---
If Blizzard decided to actually create a remaster later, I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't play it but I wouldn't mind others playing because the original is available.
---
Most remasters are worse than the original, anyway. While the aforementioned Starcraft one is good (because it's *very* faithful in it's recreation), the upcoming Warcraft III Reforged looks like shit. Just because everything is high poly and high res, doesn't make it good. It's the art direction. It's just not good (in my eyes).
---
The same is true with WoW. The original Vanilla graphics is definitely low poly and low res but has a very strong and wonderful ambience. The original art direction and artists were good. The new WoW models doesn't mesh with it and cheapen the experience.
---
I forgot about my guidebook and atlas, need to digem up
---
That is so fucking stupid
---
Back in the day I used to have a group of people I would pvp with and we would always look forward to the good premade teams on the other side of the server. We would even coordinate via server message board. 
---
Steamrolling is boring but the server rivalries made it interesting. 
---
Honestly if they made huge battlegroups again it would ruin it for me at least.. although 3-5 servers might be okay if it helped queue times balance out. It's nice knowing the people on the other side somewhat.
---
To be fair a budget build could struggle with high resolution 144fps.
---
Duo leveling is actually better. Check out Kargoz on YouTube for tips.
---
Maybe not all of them, I'll save some of the out of the way ones for an alt. But there are a few I'm looking forward to running multiple times. Running ZF is one of my fondest memories from vanilla so that is one. Sunken temple, BRD, Scarlett Monastery, are all up there for me personally.
---
Just make it 1 pixel longer so its a red 'T' instead of a red '+'.
---
Just hire me already, Blizzard.
---
Who pulled the Surger and the Core Hound?
---
I suppose you could grind mobs to 60 in those zones, but a few weeks ago some guy pointed out you can hit level cap by killing boars. Doesn't mean it's optimal or fun!
---
Cross-realm BGs were introduced in 1.12
---
They don't "remove" anything. They are using the 1.12 data, where those new models and animations don't exist. They'd have to "add in" the new graphics. Also the data and code is very interlinked. They had to work very carefully to make everything work. Trying to keep both sets of code and making sure they don't interfere with each other would complicate things.
---
Developing Classic has taken a lot of time already. Add the modern graphics would take an unknown amount of extra time, introduce bugs and delay the release. The goal of Classic is also to bring back Vanilla as it was. The extra graphics options we'll be getting (modern shadows and water, increased ground clutter distance) are basically "free" with the new engine, that's why they have been left in. Anything else (especially things which would require extra work, time and money) is not a goal.

Human mage .....
---
Whats wrong lol
---
No worries, I got a glimpse of the post earlier but couldn't reply 'cause I was going to see Endgame, but you weren't wrong either. I don't remember which PvE gear was good in PvP (for Warriors I think it wasn't much) but I can believe it. I just disliked the balance they ended up with.
---
That’s weird. My shitty old comp from 2011 manages just fine in orgrimmar during peak hours on one of the more popular p-servers. It has loads of other issues but hey at least no lag in orgrimmar, what more can you ask for
---
I want the game as it was at launch minus a few non life quality issues
---
In vanilla I played a fury/prot hybrid build to do this, and it actually ended up being pretty crazy for duals and later arena lol

I'll quest solo as much as possible, but group up for elite quests.  This way I can level at my own pace and when I find time. 
---
Some quests/elites for the end of the quest, are not solo'able by every class. Also, spawn rates are an issue, so sometimes its better to group up for the end elite quest, as it saves everyone time and you can de-group once the quest is completed, then continue on solo.
---
I'm 6'6 and 230lbs and i look like day 15. You underestimate height + a bit of muscle
---
Damn, thank you for the in depth write up !! I think I’ll enjoy it I’ve always been one to enjoy playing unique, underplayed characters in games like heroes of the storm or overwatch. Definitely appealing to me to have a unique kit and play style. Also I’m a pretty casual player, so it’s not like I’m dying to top damage meters or anything I just want to have fun. As long as I can PVP as a hybrid healers with a bit of damage and mobility I think I’ll enjoy it . As for PVE I’m totally happy to heal
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Kill quest in a group, Item Quest solo. This is the fastest way
---
yes. His attack speed was generalised, changing it from 1.2secs to 2 secs.
---
INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!
---
&gt; I'm not convinced that a bear out-tps a good tank without pummeler by the way. 
---
Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo) by Skarm, a guy who has tanked Naxx with both warrior and druid. It's a comparison of the two classes. 
---
Druids naturally out-threat sword and board warriors. Dual wield tanks can out-threat a bear (without pummelers) but they're less durable. So basically bears are a middle ground between the survivability of a full defensive warrior, and a threat focused dual wield tank.
---
Thunderfury definitely closes the gap in threat.
---
Bears and warriors excel in different situations. Druids excel in certain situations, have unique buffs, CC, battle rez, the ability to change roles fight-to-fight etc. They make a great addition to any raid comp.
---
Ye, but Sapper Charge is not BoP nor does it require goblin specialization to use, so you can just buy it.
---
Isn’t botting bannable? I’ve never used it but that’s what I thought at least
---
My guess is druid. Moonkin is just pure meme, you are giant owl for efing sakes. And while leveling you can just attack anyone from stealth if you go feral, annoy them with roots and if things go south, you just pack your things and run as a freaking cat... until you get out of combat, stealth and attack again.
---
I actually get slimmer. Is that a bad thing? 
---
Serious question
---
I'm lvl 52 on a private server and still do at least 50% of the DMG with my wand. You need a good one tho. Like now I got 51 I got the wand from "win one alterac valley" quest. It has 64 DPS with + do frost spelldmg, but who cares about that while leveling.
---
But then you instead sell it on the AH because you need money for that ridiculously over-charged mount.
---
On the other hand, priest leveling is just so much smoother.
---
More often they are there at the formation of the guild. You don't want to trust a random with being MT.
---
I intend to go holy/disco from lvl 11.
---
I will play with friends when I need to but primarily aim at going every dungeon as many times as necessary for the bosses to cough up my gear
---
&gt; My primary gripe with tbc was raid design fucking with melee dps a lot.
---
People on this sub will still convince you that the heroics and raiding is the best raiding experience to date, despite nobody essentially bothering with melee until T6 (which you clear in a single reset anyway).
---
If you are serious enough for 2 characters, then you are serious enough to play in a guild that clears mc/bwl in 1 day and puts their raid days on reset days. That way you just respec twice every 12 days, for what costs you less than 2 hours farm. If you then have another character, then its likely to optimize farming (i.e. mage or such). This way you can use your OP raid gear in pvp. You want engineering in pve anyways, and avoid having it on your farmer.
---
It’s all about supply and demand. It’s said in a lot of YouTube videos already: it changes from server to server and phase to phase.
---
Examples are resistance pots (fire from phase 1 to 3 - nature for AQ - nature/frost/shadow for naxx 
---
And stuff that’s released in later stages and useful for alts like major trolls blood potion.
---
All current raid pots usually sell for profit. The less people supply it the bigger the profit.
---
It’s a lot on you, reading the market demand and the current supply by your competitors.
---
On that note, I don't much care for the Red Cross organization to begin with... They aren't exactly truthful about what they spend donations on...
---

I traded no gf and having friends to having a gf and no friends and it's way better.
---
I'm in the same boat, but with Undead and Troll Mage
---
Was 13. really basic english knowledge and first ever RPG in general.  
---
I read in guides that rogues want to use slow weapons for higher dmg crits, so i NEVER used Slice and Dice.  
---
You know why? Well why would i want to use something that does exactly the opposite, aka make my weapons FASTER.  
---
Ultimate facepalm
---
I would say it depends on class you level. If you can kill anything solo its bettet. If you are a rogue its better to have friends as long as he can steath to.
---
this is so good.
---
yeah and its been shit, since 1.2.3. same as wow after wrath...
---
That's such a meme though. Just give the Spriest a slot of VE and put him with your warlocks. He'll do like 60% of a caster in DPS, 60% of a healer in HPS + apply SW. Bosses go down super quickly these days.
---
A fantastic conversation chain to read.  Thanks everyone: this is one of the best Reddits I know of.
---
yes
---
no it did not
---
I'm leaning towards alliance currently, however choosing the right server with a balanced population is my absolute top priority.
---
If you look at the private server scene over the years, the faction ratios can be very sporadic. LB &amp; K3 were both relatively balanced, slightly favouring Horde. Whereas the most recent server: ND, is about 60/40 alliance.
---
Hopefully we will be able to run censuses on the beta to get an idea how things will pan out on retail.
---
You are Kappaing, but form what I've seen so far from the Classic team, they might actually be doing old school developer stuff, like where bug reports are handled and Beta's aren't just glorified early releases.
---
Honestly, the Tier 10 PvP gear is great for blasting and requires about the same amount of time investment per week as raiding. 
---
Holy PvP can be rough if you're by yourself, but you should be able to get some nice crits off if you've got protection.
---
Hi, /u/mythipegs
---
It is a very questionable spec IMO.
---
Priests already have mana problems even if they spec full into healing. Makes no sense to me at all. In the second half of vanilla progression, it is absolutely worth it to have a SPriest. And in the first half it doesn't matter *at all*.
---
Yeah but I play a paladin, that way I can masturbate during normal play and pee on the fp.
---
Should you try to go fury prot then? For the regen provided by bloodthirsty (close to death strike), + you can get the fury regen when you get a crit and last stand. 
---
You can also get the + threat talent
---
You might need a shield however for tanking ;)
---
So every windfury attack and SoE totem belongs to the resto shaman for 4x melee in the group then?
---
Kill Honor is a bad idea i think that could result in something like ganking beeing the best honor gain and we will have p2 for that.
---
I think it would have to be a 30-60min Debuff that prevents getting Honor/que bgs for the entire group, and that should work if you solo que too, so que dodge in any form = debuff. The Honor prevention is a must, to prevent que dodge + ganking combo.
---
Much more likely that he is underestimating how fat he is. A lot of people looking like day 120 say they look like day 15.
---
I don't want to cause waves, but considering the desire to form connections with other people is one of the defining characteristics of human beings this was a big of an alarming read. The need to belong is pretty universal outside of certain situations, and an absolutist attitude towards relationships doesn't really pan out, man. They're all about finding middle ground in the give-and-take, just that the give-and-take has to be percieved as about equal for the relationship to survive. 
---
If you consider relationships like that to be slavery, I have to ask, how good are you with compromising?
---
SPriests already add raid damage after 3 Warlocks on average. Plus with 16 slots they should apply VE and sit in the WL group to constantly heal their life tapping up.
---
&gt;i don't think it has to do with being an asshole, but if you're going to be elitist, might as well be the best there is.
---
Thats one of the best rationalizations ive ever heard.
---
Leaving a guild doing naxx to join a guild doing naxx faster IS an asshole thing to do.
---
I could imagine he left because if his current guild was only doing MC and he wanted to experience more endgame raids but no matter how you cut it, that was an asshole behavior towards his own guild.
---
I’m not sure removing hybridity/RPG elements were necessarily at the players’ requests.
---
I played a Druid, and knew a few Shaman players, who really didn’t mind not being “the best” at their chosen role. There was a weird yet real amount of satisfaction in buffing/helping your fellow raiders, whether with your presence or otherwise, and I often felt appreciated.
---
By contrast, I think it’s only when they started removing hybrid elements that players started getting annoyed with whatever hybridity/RPG elements they had left. Blizzard essentially said “We’re in the process of making you as good/competitive as pure DPS/tanks/healers/etc” which naturally made people impatient to get to that point.
---
https://imgur.com/a/MezTC2A Wand is 15% of damage done. Lvl 45 with good lvl40 blue wand killing pirates in tanaris with normal grinding rotation (mb -&gt; pain -&gt; flay -&gt; mb -&gt; wand).
---
Hunters typically shit on rogues. Go either.
---
Fd trap. Kite
---
That's one of the highest dps blue wands in the game (at level 60) but ok, i'll try to see how it goes. What mobs are you killing?
---
Correct me if i'm wrong here. But doesn't lower armor on mobs/bosses mean that armor penetration would be even more valuable? (as long as they don't reach 0 armor and some of the penetration is wasted)
---
Found the Red Cross enthusiast
---
Nobody forces you to watch streams if people dont use the graphics you expect!

"I hate working with these... humans."

            - Garithos, 2003

Then no one would premade, everyone would solo pvp, a privat server already tryed that, even if you manged to make it work without ppl just queing at the same time.

I just cant stand misinformation when it comes to help organisations
---
Questing in a 5 man group. Not because I think it's better though.
---
It's actually not the official beta, I don't think anyone outside blizzard has access to that one. But this is the Beta client (1.13.xxx) that people datamined, and they are hosting it locally on their own PC.
---
There are no NPCs, spells don't work, etc. It's just for checking out various things that Blizzard is adding, for example UI changes. Since they have the beta client they can test if addons work on that build.
---
And the mounts + Thunderfury was added by the player themselves, using .gm commands
---
Explore xp will be by far the slowest method, not to mention it will put you well behind the Zerg, forcing you to go through the bulk of players again. 
---
A combo of questing and grinding anything you can will get you to 5 faster, without fail, and with more silver and gear.

"Low performing classes" lol
---
would only help if xrealm bgs.
---
Que dodging for xrealm would work like the guy said with a fall guy.
---
Que dodging for realm based bgs often works with a twink on the opposite fraction.
---
If we had xrealm bgs, and names +  realm not visible que dodging would become very hard.
---
If you then add the inability to gain honor to the Debuff you could be kinda sure that the matches would be played out.
---
But there is a chance it would kill the premades, since it could that farming honor solo is more effective, random vs random often dos not last that long, and insta loose again premade groups is fast too.

If you start trying to count how many times Esfand says "right" in his videos you'll never be able to listen to him again :)

10? At the beginning of phase 3? It seems a lot to me... depends of the length of phase 2 of course but it’s MINIMUM 3 months for the first month and 1 r14 on average every week maximum. So a 5.5 months phase 2
---
Alright, I'll do some testing myself in similar fashion and see how I will do. Thanks for sharing.

This isn't about copyright. The red cross, red crescent and red crystal are protective symbols in the Geneva convention. They indicate that a building or person are for medical purpose or protection of civilians.

I want old graphics because they are good and I don't see much that could be upgraded in a way that would be more than a side grade in my eyes. Modern graphics often just seem to add detail, which is something I find really unimportant. And I definitely don't trust blizzard to improve it, given that I have a few gripes with the 6.0 models/animations and a LOT of issues with the 7.3 and onwards graphical changes.
---
I don't have a strong opinion on retail graphics toggles other than that I most likely won't use them. This thread had shown me that there are plenty of fanatics who will freak out over any possible competitive advantage of retail graphics, so I won't have to worry about ever being at a disadvantage for this decision in any way (not being sarcastic). I also am not hugely into RP so my character looking a bit different to other people doesn't bother me either.
---
Renew is the most efficent heal a Priest has when counting amount healed per point of mana spent. Its not meant to be the only heal, but as a supplementary to cast on the tank or when a DPS gets agro and takes maybe 20-30% damage.
---
It's good to group up if the area is populated so you can share tags and fight off the other faction. If the area is empty I'd rather just solo.
---
For now I killed mostly undead in Wpl. 
---
Mind blast, SWP and the rest with wand. Other chars my lvl there don't kill mobs faster, but I got no reg downtime.
---
I agree while it should be enough, after getting used to 144hz I can't even play wow at 60fps anymore. Makes me want to vomit. Ofc its not as crucial as in FPS, but i just cant stand it anymore. Less then 120fps in literally any game makes me want to vomit.
---
Because they are established? There are plenty of guilds with equal leadership to Method and different goals. 
---
I mean I've already applied for a few. They all seem friendly and switched on. Most of all they seem keen. 
---
What annoys me most is the negativity, and people bashing things purely because... No one can say what will and won't happen, an educated guess would say that some guilds won't make it, but very few guilds have stood the test of time in WoW, even the greats. Eventually things fail, some sooner rather than later but condemning every guild to failure on a Reddit, doesn't exactly help the guilds. Now people read this and see "Nah it'll never work" and decide to not sign up to guilds.
---
The most destructive thing to guilds right now isn't the risk of players not getting 60, but people not signing up due to everyone telling them they won't work
---
The biggst problem is you need raw spelldmg gear.
---
How do you get it ? Rank 10 will be hard at the start. And you still need all other slots filled.
---
Raid ? How do you explain to you raid you want the caster weapons and cant use the typical priest weapons ?
---
Sure if you can get your hands on decent gear it will work fine but the biggest problem here is the gear not the Specc.
---
You could try to get a raid spot as a shadowpriest, to be able to roll on dmg gear.
---
And then go for something like Rank 10 gear in p2, and push for rank 13 in p3 to be able to keep up with gear.
---
But then again who would give a shadowpriest something like staff of Shadowflame.
---
Gear is the biggest issue for priest and always has been, and playing a DMG holy specc only make the problem worse.
---
I've always taken the long route:
---
Max all professions as I level.
---
Do every quest, Yes EVERY quest, even all the dungeon quests. I am a completionist, and that way is the most satisfying for me. I usually get to lvl 60 in about 10 days playtime.
---
High recommendation if you are not in a rush.
---
Soloing is faster if you know exactly what you’re doing. If I roll my hunter as intended I will solo all content needed to level. If I level a warrior I will duo level with a friend, however anything past duo leveling IE 3+ people is not viable for speed/efficiency.
---
Afair, the deposit is returned upon a succesful sale, hence the addition and subsequent subtracktion of B.  
---
But, you are right, I am not factoring in unsuccesful sales.
---
The bag drop rates are boosted incredibly high on pservers. 
---
On a pserver you can expect to leave the starting area at level 10, if not 6, with at least 3 bags. My last run I left with 7.
---
On Joana’s recorded vanilla run, his first bag drop was at level 23.
---
Play testing on a pserver adjusted to vanilla, I ran through to 20 and 40+ dozens of times, and maybe got 1 or 2 bags by 20 on average.
---
9g 85s 14c, actually.
---
I can't listen to him regardless. He has an annoying voice and doesn't really bring up meaningful opinions to anything without just parroting something someone else has said.
---
Lol, just so you know, there are a ton of Red Crescent organisations in Muslim countries that are part of the International Red Cross movement. Despite that, the Red Cross movement is neutral in religious questions.
---
Yea, sorry, just looked for B quickly in your formula and added the rate... in the wrong place, edited and fixed it now :P

As a paladin player I can tell you that most alliance skip sfk and i would too if it were not for the sweet class q reward.

&gt; As far as I am concerned, doing so, is stealing intellectual property from mankind as a whole
---
Rofl you've got to be kidding. You would be surprised that Adidas protect their logo so it isn't used in weapons manufacturing logos, but again I guess that is stealing IP from mankind? It's "just" three stripes after all. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_stripes
---
**Three stripes**
---
Three stripes is a trademark of Adidas consisting of three parallel lines, which typically feature along the side of Adidas apparel.  Adidas was known for this branding early in its history, with its owner, Adolf Dassler, describing it as "The three stripe company".Designs for shoes registered in 1949 incorporated the three stripes along the side.A Finnish sports brand Karhu Sports sold the three stripe trademark to Adidas for (the equivalent of) €1,600 euros and two bottles of Whiskey.

Honestly the big time wasters are gonna be things like GY runs especially from dungeons
---
But what about everyone who DOESNT just fly to 60? It took me over 3 months to get to 60 back in the day and im planning to take my sweet time. At the current state, picking a crafting profession to make your own gear is a waste of money as dungeon drops are better in most cases. This would give proper options for gear other than running dungeons.
---
I just prefer the old look and animations it also allows for more players because it will have lower pc requirements
---
You didn’t read that Blue Post about turning your character into a XL Kul’Tiran with perma rez sickness (diabeetus) immediately without your consent, regardless of Horde or Alliance if you gain x weight (according to your bmi) over the course of Classic?
---
There is a reason retail has a level boost. Everything under the current content is basically worthless and it's just a chore to do it before you get to actual content...
---
How can you speculate on server economy without servers being out yet?
---
That's like speculating on how good a soccer player a person who hasn't been concieved yet will be.
---
How is this even a question? Of course you would get to continue your character.
---
Will you be playing with a CRT with 512 kbps internet connection too?
---
Idk why, I'm already laughing at your comment prior to clicking the link.
---
This guy is wrong. Most people that play retail don't even have a 1050, that's way overkill for classic. You just need a laptop with 8gb ram and an i5 processor, which will only run you a few hundred.
---
it's like leaving a football club for another basicly.
---
if you think another guild has a better offer, why not tbh.
---
Yeah a possibility look what happened to runescape
---
It's pretty sweet if you're not melee, admittedly. Warlocks are fun.
---
“Hey wassap old fren” 
---
From bobby with mild confusion
---
We can use pserver data as a basis for discussion, even if it wont be 100% correct for live servers.
---
There should be free (one time) transfers.
---
Which is why I'd love for a TBC server to start at 58, so you dont even have to bother with the old world, and then keep the Classic servers on for those that want that content.
---
IT'Sh MY FIRShT TIME
---
Yes his logic doesn’t make sense hehe
---
To be honest it's not really different from any other class. Sure, the number of warriors you see in the polls may be disconcerting but compare that to the amount of druids, warlocks or hunters that have to compete over a mere 1-3 raid slots and it's really not that bad.
---
There will be a huge demand for warriors and rogues. At the end of the day it all comes down to you ; if you're a good, informed, min/max player with proper gear and consumables you'll get into any raid group or guild without trouble. If you're a tourist and a bottom tiers warrior you'll be lucky to get into a raid group let alone get any items.
---
So are you ready to tank dungeons from time to time to get your pre-raid gear, invest time and effort into mastering your class and collecting proper consumables and buffs before you show up to a raid? If you answered yes to all these, then by all means roll a warrior and you'll have an amazing time in Classic.
---
This guy gets it
---
I really hope they don't change anything.
---
I'm pretty sure I'm within the 1% group of people who dislike the 'new' animations and textures. It's not only nostalgia, I genuinely like the way the game looks. Just like how I love the way wc3 looks.
---
Let me out it this way; I loved Age of Empires II graphics immensely and when they released III, I honestly thought it was a step back. Not graphics wise per se, just so far as art style is concerned. 
---
I just wished we went full hardcore vanilla and implemented the Tauren plainsrunning ability, instead of them using mounts. That shit was bloody awesome in the vanilla beta.
---
&gt; A LFG listing tool like GW2 has would have been so much better.
---
Basically what they had at the beginning of WotLK before they replaced it with the dreaded LFD.
---
Yes but they were shit at figuring out if you were using them back then.
---
thanks to the guys coming over from genjuros Nihilum got the WF in the first place. There is a video on youtube, where Kungen explains how the players from &lt;sin&gt; made the Nihilum roster so much better.
---
I played with Naeko in WotLK, where he was still a fucking beast, playing DK.
---
jea dont let your dreams be memes, everything can be viable if you fight against plebs that you outgear by 2 tiers :P
---
or be smart and let players continue their characters they worked on and new players would start from nothing, starting from 58 would ruin economy as you could have all professions doing daily craft.
---
Except your soccer player isn't borne yet.
---
What's on pservers now might or might not happen on Classic servers. There is just no way to know. So you can speculate all you want based on any and every server economy you have available to date, but it still wont tell you how it'll be on the Classic server you chose, or any of the others for that matter.
---
&gt;streamers can't play 24/7
---
Tell that rlenk
---
This is an interesting question.
---
Halo MCC actually brought back the red crosses on health packs in Halo 1 on standard definition, but it was changed in the remaster.
---
So perhaps Blizzard will scoot by the legal bits since this is kind of a recreation of history?
---
Starting? It was always a shitshow. :)
---
I would have expected the option to be able to copy characters over for free..
---
Yeah it makes perfect sense that a caster that can switch to tank, use stealth, heal, ress i combat, buff mana, use dots and hots and a powerdull debuff should be close to a mage in raid damage, that can make free food and portals... Perfect sense.
---
Alliance or Horde for Warrior? What do you think the pros and cons are?
---
I reckon I like alliance cities more, but horde levelling seems better because they access dungeons a lot easier and have an easier time crossing the sea IMO. I know horde have an advantage in a lot of cases in wPvP but alliance in BGs due to design. Also alliance have it easier when it comes to raiding due to paladins but they are a source of competition for plate/mail stuff.
---
Here's a dude makes a good analysis of the desirability of each class in raids in Classic based on that big survey that has been mentioned in this thread:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhgbxq/wow_classes_demand_and_supply_study_in_end_game/?st=jv6flskt&amp;sh=07a83744
---
As You can see, DPS warriors (and even rogues because people seem to be afraid that there will be too many rogues) should be in demand for raids, especially on PVE servers. Here's his conclusion
---
&gt;Warrior is the king. If you want to get a spot in the raid and have no problem with the leveling, go warrior.
---
Warlock: I had thought warlock should have no problem to join in the raid. However, I guess many people have the same mind, so it becomes a tight market.
---
Rogue is another reliable option for a melee class but overpopulated in PVP server. We could not tell these extra rogues would like to join in the raid or not, since T3 gears are an excellent upgrade for PVP.
---
The garbage PvP rank system is to blame here. All that counts is honor per hour; you can't afford to have long matches against other premades when you could shitstomp randoms in Arathi Basin in a few minutes.
---
But Classic is born and about 15 years old now. We know all the mechanics and how everything is made, the only thing we miss is the pricing on official servers, but we have a decade of private servers to base speculation on.
---
&gt;What's on pservers now might or might not happen on Classic servers. 
---
I'm not saying its going to be the same, which is why I specifically said SPECULATION.
---
ofc, especially since naxx was so heavily gear dependant. makes sense taking the best geared from wherever you can.
---
Even though them leaving basicly killed the server, i don't blame them whatsoever..
---
How would it? People still need to level up their trade skill from 0.
---
Most bosses should have 3730 armor. Kel'thuzad and some others have 3000.
---
5x sunder and faerie fire is 2755 armor reduction. Improved expose instead of sunders would be more. Best case you get benefit of maybe 1 BRE stack.

I'm going to roll 22/0/29 melee hunter.   No bows or guns, thrown only ranged attacks haha
---
Seems pretty unlikely
---
The "free" epic mount won't be available until Dire Maul is released. And while the level 40 mount is indeed free, you have to buy spells for all 4 demons which does add up.
---
Are those tank only? 
---
IE would I take the crit trinket instead of Tyranny if I wanted to play deeps?
---
Also please let me know if you remember/know other examples of such "mandatory" quest reward items!!
---
Thanks!
---
Day 3058: Musclebrah
---
I'm quite sure it's been changed to base later, but like Tauren, it is on total Stat in vanilla.
---
Electricity is now banned
---
I dont think there will be separate TBC servers. Classic just continues into TBC.
---
Imagine how divided the playerbase would be if everything would be separate, especially if they would also do WOTLK.
---
Separate Classic, TBC, WOTLK and retail. Thats not going to happen. Also, i think they will only do TBC if the demand is high enough, and after some years, when everyone is level 60 for a long time and has done almost everything multiple times, i can not imagine the demand for TBC not being high enough
---
Lvl 21 and already a more congested actionbar than lvl 120's in retail. Can't wait!
---
I've been working on losing weight and getting more fit for Classic so I won't get too fat.
---
Was 300lbs in Jarnuary and currently sitting at 265lbs. Hopefully I'll hit 250lbs before Classic launches.  
---
My ideal weight would be around 240'ish, but beggars can't be choosers :D
---
Feels like mythic+ raid to me
---
Ain't nobody needs a reminder for that
---
The human racial is extremely good for warrior dps and tps, good enough that nearly all ally warriors are humans. Another pro is that ally warriors can have both blessing of salvation, kings and might which are pretty good buffs. While horde has windfury, a warrior has no threat reduction which means it's a bit more scary to dps as a horde warrior. 
---
Orcs are very strong in PvP due to their stun resist. Human warriors don't really get anything for PvP, but dwarves, gnomes and nightelves get some extra utility. 
---
As for paladins stealing their loot that will be pretty rare in raids, but will happen during leveling. Keep in mind though that dps warriors will wear a lot of leather/mail in raids, so in a way they are actually stealing loot from the rogues. 
---
A big con with Horde is that none of their cities are close to the Blackrock Mountain, so venturing out to BRD, UBRS/LBRS, MC and BWL is quite a journey, so long that many guilds require everyone to bind in Kargarth, which of course is annoying.
---
Lol
---
&gt; It looks like a reaction based action game with rotations and a luck based loot system with a horrible player progression with no individuality in the talent system and your character choice.
---
As someone who has played both BfA and vanilla, it's more or less the same. BfA has actual PvE gameplay for every class, even though it's shit compared to expansions like MoP, it's still miles ahead of vanilla, which was extremely simple, both in terms of PvE encounters (levelling, dungeons, raids), and class gameplay (spam frostbolt, etc.). As for being "reaction based", yeah? Like if you're in a raid and some mechanic happens, you need to react to it, how is that different from vanilla? Most of the time it's more about learning and predicting the fights anyway, not pure reaction. Like any boss fight in any video game pretty much. 
---
Imo there are more *meaningful* choices in the modern talent system. The choices in vanilla was usually between getting 3% that or 5% that, rarely anything actually affecting gameplay. And I would even argue that there is more "individuality" in the new system, as most choices depends on what playstyle you prefer, or what gear you have. In vanilla it just wasn't possible to do a spec that was noticeably different from everyone else, since you want to pick up the few actually useful talents that you can along the way anyway. So you didn't choose between the talents that mattered, you picked all of them, then choose between some of the bad ones that didn't affect you much. 
---
As far as character progression goes, levelling is now a much smaller part of the game, which is fair. But at end game I'm not sure it's particularly different. It goes a lot faster to gear up to "bis" levels. But it's still slow enough that it takes a pretty long time, so not sure how much of a spiritual difference there is there between BfA and Vanilla. 
---
And although I strongly dislike the titanforging (chance of getting a small upgrade on anything that drops), aside from that it's really not much different from vanilla in terms of luck. In raids (where the best loot drops), you go in, kill a boss, and it drops an item from it's loot table, if you're lucky. Main difference is that each boss drops more in BfA than it does in vanilla, with smaller raid sizes. So you gear up more quickly (again, change of pace, not significant mechanics). 
---
&gt;Thats just sad to read and tells you it is not a RPG anymore.
---
It's an **MMO**RPG. It doesn't have a fixed story. Every expansion we get a new story that builds on the previous one. So now if you start playing in BfA, you get to play the BfA story. The old stories are still all mostly available (aside from vanilla), but not something you have to play through to get to "current content" (where everyone else is playing, hence the MMO part). I guess the choice blizzard made in making old expansions irrelevant is a bad one, but with this many expansions I really don't see how it would work any other way. And comparing to vanilla, you only had one "story" there anyway, so what's the difference? That you don't start from nothing anymore? That doesn't make it any less of an RPG. 
---
&gt;They desperately want wow to be like lol and dota, queue for a group, have 1000 apm click action with bright colors for 10 minutes, flame your teammates and get out.
---
Nah, not really. They make complex raid encounters like that because that is what people like raids to be, and has since vanilla. 
---
&gt;Like the other post said, they tried to ask what people thought about those simple changes like removing lfg tools, sharding etc. and no surprises the vanilla crowd still didnt like it.
---
The LFG tool that is actually used in BfA is really good imo. Instead of spamming trade chat you can list your group, then people can apply to groups from a list. It's clearly an improvement over vanilla, as it doesn't take away any interaction or anything, just makes it easier to see what groups are forming. Just wanted to say that. But otherwise, yes, many retail players clearly don't like the same type of game as most vanilla players. Don't think that is up for debate. 
---
There are two versions of the game in BfA. One is for "casuals" who do the story and collect shiny stuff like toys, mounts, transmog. And they mostly treat it as a single player game. That is very different from vanilla. 
---
The other side of the game is for the typical MMO player, where you level/gear up and do dungeons and raids with your friends. This part is still pretty much the same as in vanilla (and in some aspects more similar to vanilla than a lot of earlier expansions has been). But also keep in mind that this was the *only* part of vanilla. It's a bit different now, sure. But it's mostly small changes that doesn't affect the overall experience, like what happens in every expansion (like TBC and Wrath, which people here still seem to enjoy). As someone who didn't really play the game after early TBC, when I came back in WoD, it still was very much the same game in this regard, and still is.
---
I used to do it for loading screens in LoL. Usually enough time for 20-30 situps depending on people's computers.
---
The best case scenario is when you are planning to game with your SO who will completetly discorver Vanilla because she love how you talk about the game :)
---
the meta is strong in this one
---
Because it left the other guild unable to progress further?
---
Its not like a football team, a new quarterback can fill in his spot instantly, everyone knew back then if you lost a main tank, especially one that was good and geared for naxx, it would almost be impossible to find a replacement.
---
Hats off for he accomplished his goal of server first but if you dont think this was an asshole thing to do to his old guild then im sorry to say, something is wrong with you m8.
---
Because MMORPGs are social experiences. If you've set aside 4 hours to play with your friends it's kinda disappointing if it's over in 2.
---
I'm not sure that's actually true, if it is I'd love a source on that. Since on the panel they showed the initial "classic" gameplay with the new models [here](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=753)
---
I havent played WoW in almost 10years. I loved playing for the very first time when the trial version came out saying I could download an play free for 10 days.  I miss my lovely Human Prot Warrior with that lovely Shield slam ability that was super Op in PvP and pve. I will definitely be back to face my favorite enemies the MURLOCKS
---
Hmmmm... Fair enough. Although it feels like there'd be a different 'vibe'(?) to the content just because of how different Vanilla is as a game. The boss fights are also quite different in Vanilla in comparison to more modern content, which I think might help promote some really interesting strategies.
---
... or it might not be interesting at all. :b
---
Cant you hold off and buy the level 5 grimors(sp?) Only on the demons you dont need for leveling? Which would save a bit of gold.
---
I don't think the proper path for blizzard would be  servers of each expansion.
---
I think if classic hits it big enough for them (sorry, but it won't) they will do progression servers, which are a fairly common thing in quite a few mmo's now... But blizzard have a LONG LONG LONG way to go before those even become remotely possible
---
Their expansions still sell insanely well, no reason for them to turn development anywhere else yet
---
&gt;If you've set aside 4 hours to play with your friends it's kinda disappointing if it's over in 2(min)
---
That's what she said
---
I played a mage in classic and TBC and really enjoyed mage content levelling and at end game. I rolled a lock and thought that locks were better, better at pvp, easier levelling, but couldn't compare the end game as I never got there on my lock.
---
I think the grass will always be greener. I'm rolling a mage again come classic though, I'm sticking to what I know, and plus mages have tonnes of great things about them that other classes simply don't have any alternatives for (portals, CC, damage, etc.)
---
Newer does not always mean better. The old models have a lot of craftsmanship in them, which i find lacking in the new models. Sure, they are technically inferior in that they have fewer polygons to work with, and lower resolution textures - but the artists really outdid themselves with creating characters that look relatable and satisfactory. 
---
In contrast, the new models, especially the faces, have high poly counts, but every face looks the same (they have corrected some of that, but not enough), and a lot of the character of the old faces went missing. Sure, the faces now are animated, but that animation looks the same for every face (and across races, which, ugh!), and it's often uncanny-valley material for me as well.
---
All in all, while technically more advanced, the new models, for the most part, are inferior for me. It's like with many remasters in film: The old. often critically acclaimed, version gets an overhaul that just does not capture the magic of the original (e.g. Psycho); Even though it is *technically* more advanced, it fails to capture the atmosphere of the old one.
---
So, just as I prefer the original Psycho to the new one, I prefer the old models and animations to the new ones.
---
I don't think we will see post-vanilla content.
---
Not only would it fracture an already fractured player base, but just looking at the pserver community, anything beyond vanilla didn't have a huge following. There's not enough interest for it.
---
Don't get me wrong; everyone should play Vanilla exactly how they'd like to play. I, for instance, won't be attempting any speed-run raids. Instead I'll be playing a lot more casually. However, I would still most definitely find it entertaining to watch relatively short videos of hardcore players flying through raids and claiming various speed-run titles. :3
---
Please not just any RTX 2080 TI you need the  MSI RTX 2080 TI GAMING X TRIO with the 2x 8 pin and 1x 6 pin (3 POWER INPUTS!!!) for maximum power!!!!!!! KA ME HA ME HAA!!!!!!!!!!! /cast hemorrhage /cast \[mod:shift\] backstab
---
# MSI GeForce RTX 2080 TI GAMING X TRIO
---
Hah. WP.
---
Wow won't get a sequel. At BEST we can expect what they learn to carry over to other projects like D4.
---
The class balance is fine and the DPS of hybrids is fair considering the utility. It’s just the retarded mechanics that 100% fuck melee over for anything that is difficult at lower gear level/current content.
---
I am hoping they re-release an up to date version with Classic, like a re-release of the 1.12 Brady guide &lt;3
---
I never watched a stream in my life so I don't really get the whole "streamer will ruin the game/make it great" vibe
---
Underrated comment. Have karma.
---
I hope so, I'll happily buy it. Partly nostalgia party to be useful.
---
&gt; when everyone is level 60 for a long time and has done almost everything multiple times, i can not imagine the demand for TBC not being high enough
---
But what about new players? Making old content useless has been a complaint since the TBC announcement.
---
Oh the innocense in all these comments.
---
Its so weird to imagine that once even MC was a new and challeging instance.
---
Good find, thanks for the share +1
---
I know... But i said please ...
---
Retail  is that way -----&gt;
---
My first memory of MC was hearing about a top guild on our server was starting this new instance with a sick flame boss at the end. I didnt even know where it was located until later when i joined my first raiding guild lol.
---
That wouldn't necessarily work actually, premades from various guilds would just create a skype/Whatsapp/FB/Whatever group and say in directly time to each Warsong/Arathi they just got the queue pop. These premades are often already communicating between each other to an extent anyway.
---
30min deserter for leaving a queue/not joining a BG is way better imo, there's no way to go around that.
---
it sucks for his own guild yes, but it is a game and doenst owe them anything imo.
---
its not like the guild couldn't find another tank if they wanted to
---
Destruction stuns require you take the anti pushback for rainfire/hellfire wich is absolutely useless
---
I love that you actually have to grind areas and have time to explore the story and different zones before zooming ahead and out leveling places or by getting to max level by staying in 1 place using the dungeon finder....
---
Nah, to kill a bis geared SL lock ull need to have full cd, play perfectly and ideally be UD.
---
* chose a tauren character because I thought they would have way higher starting hp and strength stats than other races 
---
* thought ghost wolf makes me invisible
---
* decided to attack alliance players at lvl 20 - planned to go to stormwind - I thought eastern kingdoms would be crowded with alliance, and to not alert enemy players of my presence i SWAM from bootybay to northern part of westfall, killed a bunch of lvl 5s in elwyn before a random higher lvl alliance player murdered me and I had to corpse run from duskwood
---
* spent talents in elemental as a shaman, almost didn't use my spells because i didn't want to run out of mana
---
* kept autoattack on "1" on my action bar for the longest time
---
That wouldn't necessarily work actually, premades from various guilds would just create a skype/Whatsapp/FB/Whatever group and post direcly after having a queue pop that they received a queue. If anybody from an other premade writes it at the same time, they're almost certain to fall on each other. These premades are often already communicating to an extent anyway, it would just organize them even more.
---
There is diminishing returns actually, Check it out
---
I played it two days ago and grew bored after a few hours. Won't be touching it again for quite some time.
---
You should be able to transfer your character from Classic to TBC as soon as TBC releases. Starting from scratch is a huge mistake.
---
You just sold me Druid even though I never considered it an option. Are you working in an ad company?
---
That's so sad haha.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap0_cCQlqo
---
The hybrid tax argument is stupid since warriors have both a god tier tanking spec and a god tier dps spec in PvE. Plus a god tier PvP spec of course. People need to stop with that.
---
Bad hybrid design in Vanilla was purely the consequence of Blizzard not managing / not having the time to fix hybrids. It's easy to understand when you see what was paladin tank in Vanilla versus what it was in TBC. Specs like ret enh and moonkin were also greatly improved in TBC.  Even though there still was god tier PvE dps specs, there was no hybrid huge imbalance anymore. Just different playstyles.
---
&gt;If Blizzard were to make a Vanilla WoW 2.0 (not Classic but rather another WoW or expansion very similar to that), it would mean they are accepting the fact that their 'inferior old game' is actually much, much better than the trash that is currently Retail. They will never do this; they cannot afford to have such a defeat (even though it would be an honorable one).
---
Why would admitting they made mistakes be a bad thing for them? What would it cost them?
---
Yeah well, it's impossible to do in BGs saddly. What you describe is pretty much what happens in an Arena setting though (you could get carried a little in Arena but not much), hence why it became the most skill requiring activity in PvP later on. In Vanilla there's no way for that to happen. Killing blows are random, damage depends on your class, flags caps/defs are random, Win/Loose ratio is not enough dependant on you, etc.
---
Lol. Gotta be a real fucking clown to talk like that.
---
Resto druid is pretty easy:
---
- You get to 60 quite easily
---
- You have some difficulty with getting pre-raid gear (people don't like druids in 5mans for some reason)
---
- You are a healer/decurser. Everyone 'knows' druids are bad healers so they won't mind it if you are not top of the charts
---
- Your tier armors are okay, which will be easy to get
---
- Few people play druid so you'll likely get into 40mans, but not necessarily to 20mans.
---
- You don't need many consumables.
---
- Your 'rotation' is quite simple as moonglow, 95% of it is spamming rank3 HT, some rejuv if you are single druid, max rank HT in emergency
---
As opposed to what?
---
I'm going to skip battlegrounds this time round - towards the end of vanilla all the lower tier battlegrounds - WSG and AB - were impossible as they were twinked out.
---
The key is just don't sleep the first 36 hours or so, you'll eventually end up ahead of the pack ^^
---
Even for those who haven't touched WoW since vanilla retail, there's going to be tons of guides for every conceivable thing. All the content creators will be falling over eachother to make the most newbie-frendly MC walkthroughs and so on.
---
I don't think you get it. they're doing sharding to prevent server crashes. what the hell do you mean, "opt out?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5G\_aoEcwK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5G_aoEcwK4)

I'm going to stop commenting on this and go bang my head against a wall in stead.
---
Why is it over?
---
I like you watch, what model of Seiko ?
---
Got to 120.  Did a few dungeons and canceled my account.
---
Every time you die, get from the screen and do 20 push ups. Now you can reverse order in op's picture.
---
Yes, that was a "very early prototype" (when they just took the live game and started to experiment on it). If you watch the whole panel you'll see that they will be using 1.12 data. They also talk about the animation data being linked to the code and restoring the old animations means not just dropping in the old data but adding back in the old animation routines.
---
In that old prototype they are talking about the 7.3.5 client and server "with it's database data stripped out and imported from the 1.12 version". The "database data" they are talking about is *not* the graphics. "database data" in WoW means literally that, relational database data, which they use to describe loot tables, spell values and other numerical values. It *doesn't* include any "assets", which are the models, animations, textures, world geometry, etc.
---
It's a neat tidbit but as said, it's just a glimpse of a very early prototype. Actual Classic will use all 1.12 data.
---
ive already paid for TBC back then.
---
Not going to pay on top of the montly fee... so no
---
Ok...
---
What pack? There's gonna be like 6 or 7 taurens top.
---
Who gets married these days?
---
When you're a lv 14 hunter, but you encounter Vultros next to Sentinel hill
---
I beg to differ.   
---
Since the quiver effects all ranged attacks it's actually also good for casters that rely heavly on their wand while leveling. If you as a priest spec into "imp wand" and wear a quiver, then shadow word pain + wand is a very good way to kill mobs without downtime.
---
Or take a step back and look at what im actually saying.
---
Played since the beginning untill WotLK, took a break and then  resumed with Legion and quitet with BFA.
---
I'll go for Modern Graphics... i Like the gameplay, but i like graphics aswell.
---
Trust me speedruns are definitely a thing in vanilla pservers and they will probably be a thing in vanilla too. 
---
Here's some of the insane pserver speedruns(note not all of these are the fastest, just personal favorites of mine). Now ofc blablabla private servers are all off and what not, it's kinda irrelevant, I'm just showing that it's done on pservers and the runs are insane.

---
I remember the L60s in my guild chatting when they were in MC bank 2995 - 40% waiting, 10%fighting, 50% corpse running was their description
---
I really don't see them keeping classic open, Frozen at the end of the content, for all time.
---
At least Rogue depends a bit on the type of server you're rolling. On PvE servers, they tend to not be as prevalent as on PvP servers, for obvious reasons. In fact, I vaguely remember rogues on my old server being the *least* played class at 60 except for warlocks (which had 0.1% more pop or so).
---
That said, if you're looking for a raid spot, you might consider going Combat Dagger Rogue. They do not get into the heavy loot competition over swords, and daggers itself are a niche that practically *has* no loot competition, excepting a few stat sticks for hunters (Dragonfang Blade, for instance - which usually rogues get priority on anyhow, because they get more use out of them than the +1 Agi they have over the Strat axes for hunters). So raid leads often take a dagger rogue over the nth combat sword, because it helps gearing up the raid faster and more reliably.
---
Actually, speed runs recently became a thing after a website (can't remember the name), started tracking clear times on private servers.
---
This is from different private servers so data is like slightly off from server to server etc.
---
There was a guild who cleared BWL in a little over 20 minutes.
---
That's the one :)
---
I guess so yeah.
---
I got slagged off in chat on my RP server when I called my death knight Flüffi - they thought I wasn't being serious enough.
---
Funny, I was just thinking exactly the same thing about the private server player who has replays classic content for the last eight years. Mindset plays a huge role in fun having potential, as does participation in community.
---
if that's right and it takes serious time to implement I'm not gonna sit here and argue for it. But the person I was discussing with earlier was against it even it if took no time at all to implement
---
The new character models look so doofy and odd, and lots of people agree seems just to be the way older players feel
---
ranged DPS or healers,
---
I was 40 and single.
---
I'm now pushing 55 and still single.  All the time in the world to waste yet more of my life, most of which has been sadly wasted already.  I'm limiting myself to 10hours a week though.  No hurry for me, I just want to go back to Stranglethorn Vale and pretend to be a pirate.
---
What are you saying? Tauren warrior is GOAT aesthetics.
---
yeh man, renew is cool. the talent is still utter shit.
---
The bosses do hit 0 even on pservers very easily with just a little bit of pen.
---
Both, but I will not reasonably expect to quest with the exact same group of people every time. Joining a guild making friends blah blah blah
---
For the record tBC is my favorite expansion of them all, I rate it higher than Vanilla as well. It felt like Vanilla with fewer rough edges, and "generally" pretty balanced (though they went overboard with the attuning process).
---
So to answer your question, I assume that once it is brought out, they will just copy all characters that existed at that time. No need to Import, or pay for anything.  
---
I honestly hope they do just this, no fuss or mess. If I had to guess they will say they will copy characters as they exist at a certain date, and with the same rules that apply to Classic (retail subscription, can play on all "Classic" servers).
---
Nope, haven't had that one either. The whole "female gamer=gets harassed" is in the same boat as "male gamer=30 year old virgin". Sure, sometimes it's true but the vast majority of the time it's not.
---
BRD was such a huge dungeon - too much for one run.
---
And I lost count of the number of times I did jailbreak.  Mostly for other folk, who were strangely AFK when I needed to do it for my attunement.
---
Was going to post this. Coincidental how that video goes up, asmongold reacts and now this topic :thinkingface:
---
Ok yeah I get 50% wanding too if all you do is mb, pain, wand, which is a poor rotation really for dps. An extra mind blast and flay will up your dps decently but you should still have par mana if you have enough spirit in your build. And that is with basically an epic wand for your lvl, the AV rewards are ridiculous levelling weapons for level 50s.    
---
    
---
I think for the vast majority of levelling 25-60 (in a world where AV isn't out yet), your wand will normally be 15-20% of your damage.
---
leveling a char takes time, it's repetitive process. Only thing to skill profs for daily craft is gold. Make char, send gold to it, buy mats, skill profs, craft cooldowns, profit.
---
The pre 1.12 BRE is better than the 1.12 version in PVE because the debuff works for everyone and stacks with everything, and bosses in vanilla with proper armor reduction debuffs have so little armor that a lot of the 2100 armor pen is wasted.
---
Personally I'm not against a "switch". As long as I can play with the original graphics, I don't care.
---
Also, Classic has taken quite a lot of time to create. Although everything they've shown and hinted at points to there not being an option for modern graphics, I wouldn't be completely surprised if they actually did include such an option as an extra.
---
I just try to show that it does require work and testing, it's a source of potential bugs and certainly adds to the development time. Everyone can then decide how to feel about it.

Lol, you are one of those. vow is vastly overrated. It’s very easy to use, and good for lazy play, but if you can run and dot and use fear in the correct way the imp can be much stronger. You can pull a whole camp from range with an imp, dot one mob and kite it until it dies, and if things go bad the camp has Argo on the imp instead of you so it’s still easy to run away and reset. Vw has all the drawbacks of being melee only, with no ranged pulling capability.
---
BRE has a pretty high droprate in phase 1 because a ton of rag loot isn't on the droptable so it's gonna drop a lot more than you think.
---
&gt;and 1 r14 on average every week maximum

This is a false rumor.

**Q: Which boss are** **YOU** **looking forward to meeting again in Classic?**
---
Are you me ?
---
I'll be no lifeing when classic launches. I won't be speed running, or leveling extremely efficiently, but I'll probably be putting in enough time to be close behind the head of the pack.
---
I hope there are people in my speed bracket doing dungeons. If not, I guess my second char will have to get me my lowbie dungeon fix.

This is hilarious.  I can't prove it right now (at work), but this is a good friend of mine.  This was actually a cut he did for a lifting comp, but clearly in reverse order.

I think in that situation it's very likely they would have both. F R E S H tbc servers and also other tbc servers that allow transfers, and then of course evergreen vanilla servers still.

The Expansion is FAKE

Some noob is talking about "the expension coming in late 05". That was a horrible joke, of which only total IDIOTS would fall for. The level cap won't be raised for a long, long time, and there will most likely not be an expansion. Ever.
---
Ye, I'm sure this expansion nonsense talk is going away in a while... :D
---
Yup
---
I was so happy when Omen of Clarity was added to my floating combat text mod - seeing those words float up in front of me, knowing I can pod off a full strength healing touch/regrowth/rejuvenation for no mana, pull aggro, and die.
---
Druid heals were ridiculously threatening.
---
I plan to level an alt priest mostly through dungeons. And I've heard others say the same thing but about warriors. So there should be plenty of groups lfm
---
Aesthetics being the key word. You can look pretty while the orc warriors get a place in the raid team :p
---
Wrong sub dude...
---
But those that have money to instantly get an alt to max profession level already have money. Its is going to be a tiny minority of players (remember, people who follow the forums are just diehard fans), while the vast majority wont have the resources to do that.
---
Can warriors heal though?

Therefore to be able to maintain you need to be in the Top 10. To gain points you need to be top 4.
---
Will try to find the explanation on another post and paste it here if I have time
---
I have never heard about that complaint. Almost all opinions i have been reading on forums for the last years is that things started going downhill from Cataclysm. Most people i know see Classic + TBC and most of the time also WOTLK as the prime of WoW. I leveled many alts in WOTLK and i never found Classic and TBC zones and content useless. The whole world was “alive” and you could find players all over the world. 
---
In retail old content is useless yes, there you only see players in the latest zones because that is the only place where there is something to do and the rest of the world is dead.
---
I watched the whole thing.
---
This again huh
---
You are assuming the size of the brackets. You can't do that
---
Private servers host maybe 20k people total and thats a generous maybe. Ckassic WoW will bring back millions of players.
---
Speed running will be a thing in Classic. Bigger than on private servers. It won’t be something for everyone and more will casually follow the scene than participate, just like it is with speed running in other games.
---
Falling for that orc newbie trap.
---
PvP is going to be ruined by twinks anyway - we got a couple of years of fun before they were the dominant force in battlegrounds, after that AB and WSG were no-go areas for casuals.  I'm going to skip PvP this time round.
---
Im probably not gonna be in that much plate. Just enough so i can actually tank. Its gonna be a balancing act and also why i will never be able to raid with it xD
---
I’m in the process of leveling a Lock right now and I’m interested in hearing your points, but I also have a few notable points of question.  
---
One being VW Sac is a lifesaver in open world PvP and oh shit moments for bad pulls.   The other being that isn’t constant fear kiting making you OOM faster, which makes you tap more?  Imp can’t take many melee hits mid to late game, so I’d imagine this is a lot of fears.
---
I’m just wondering if this Imp strategy works better in certain level ranges than others, such as when you have Dark Pact but by then I’ve read a strong alternative to VW is drain tanking with a Succubus—but even then, some say VW is proven to just be that good.
---
Im 6'4" dude.

Not to mention their CPR training is (or was) years behind the American Heart Association (AHA).

Need to confirm this. As a complete code noob or noob related to any sort of programming at all I found this video very user friendly. Watched it during blizzcon on the stream and time passed so fast. Really interesting. Every dev that spoke about the development brought something interesting to the panel and it was really a joy to watch.   
---
This was the only bright spot about Blizzcon 2018.
---
Yes assuming the server size as they were in vanilla (3k-4k players), 50% on each faction. But this does not drastically change the number of rank 14 1 or 2 more) 
---
Moreover this is the perfect number of everyone agrees to let one player be first and that the top 4 are only the rank 13, which can be the tricky if you have multiple premade team per faction
---

Because forums are almost exclusively inhabited by the diehard fans, not the casuals who play a few hours a week.
---
&gt;In retail old content is useless yes, there you only see players in the latest zones because that is the only place where there is something to do and the rest of the world is dead.
---
And it will happen again if Blizzard simply updates the Classic Servers to TBC.
---
I have a $2k rig and I don't even play games anymore. I just watch GSL on Twitch.
---
This show is a classic. But still wrong sub.
---
You are confusing population caps with total population.
---
I think this little virgin just called us both fat.
---
So what do you suggest taking instead?
---
Even in your lvl20's the mobs will be dropping 8 slot bags regularly. Loot tables may be totally off, but playing on a popular private server recently I had so many bags dropping that I would simply vender them, usually every or every other trip back to town I'd have a bag to sell.
---
Hopefully with Sharding at launch, it wont be that bad. The initial release will be problematic as so many folk will be in the starting areas. The issue I see with just exploring for XP, is you get zero coins, not even vendor trash. Low level starting quests tend to result in bags and stuff which help you level (well at least make it easier). 
---
Skipping this to explore for xp, will mean you cant train your new skills. 
---
Hopefully blizz are way ahead of this and sharding will limit the number of players in the zones at one time. 
---
Grinding is a good way to get XP and coins, especially if it is humanoids you're killing. So just kill everything on the way to a quest mob, and same with on the way back, set auto loot and just vendor all the rubbish.  
---
You'll soon level fast enough.
---
Makes sense!

Isnt there something like 30 bosses in this full instance?

&gt; For instance, the undead fast stealth walk in retail looks retarded, while the gliding one in vanilla is the bomb.
---
The same for alliance druid cat form in stealth - in vanilla it oozed like viscous oil - then they updated it and it looked like a speedwalker with diarrhea.
---
Birdbox, basically theres these "things" that invade the planet that fuck your brain up so much if you look at one that you'll immediately try to kill yourself.
---
Especially the warcrafty ones.
---
exploration leveling is a meme to get gullible noobs out of the starting zones.
---
Broken Tooth had 1.0 attackspeed throughout Vanilla.
---
Dps warrior can easily tank any dungeon and just not invite anyone who would want the dps gear?
---
You get less XP when killing mobs in a group. Towards the later levels you are starting to get starved of XP and questing solo will definitely be preferable. You also get a bunch of travel quests that are annoying to redo because your buddies are not on the same part as you are. 
---
But it's more fun to quest with friends and of course safer.
---
I am really hoping we get to test the efficiency of sharding in the beta
---
While I don't agree with the cross server solution because it'd ruin an appealing part of vanilla, I feel like way too few people have an idea of how fucked the BG scene is going to be once the big boys start competing if nothing changes.
---
The reality only really hits you when every single match is against the same chinese premade completely annihilating you.

Don’t forget epilepsy inducing RBG flashing lights and a coil whine that sounds like “REEEEEeeeeeeEeeeeeEeeEeeeEeeee”

It’s like there are two types of gamers. Those who balloon when they play too much and those who wither. I’m the second type...sitting down doesn’t demand any energy so you can eat like 1000cal a day if you’re not careful.

I am considering the Warlock for sure. One question though: Why did you dismiss the Mage? I thought their leveling wasn't that bad?

---
&gt;What are your tactics on not completely pissing your wife off?
---
She's an even more WoW nerd than I am so it'll be quite easy! Not a wife yet though.
---
I know everyone is going to roll the better classes, but I've got hope for druid. I'm sure Blizzard will release balance patches. Surely they can't have entire specs being basically useless just because that's how it was 13 years ago.
---
The attack speed was normalised in Patch 1.9 (Jan 2006). So Brokentooth lost the fast attack speed which caused the spell push back, and was amazing in PVP against casters.
---
Just like mine, she's a keeper!
---
Chill out man, gaming is for every age!
---
dont know how that'd work though, cos Beta wouldnt have the player numbers to require sharding.
---
&gt; Ckassic WoW will bring back millions of players.
---
That's what you think, sure. 
---
&gt;Private servers host maybe 20k people total and thats a generous maybe. 
---
Online at one time. I think nost had 1 million + registered accounts. A lot of those duplicates, but still, that's alot more players than 20k.
---
OP is talking specifically about r14 pushers queue dodging. Twinks aren't relevant in that bracket.
---
Or you know, statistical superiority. Like 12 year olds don't make cow toons lol
---
Iv got a kid due just shy of a month away and while my partner gets the whole gaming thing. I don't think she is going to get the classic thing when I want to play 6 hours a day work and do the parental new baby thing. I'm sure I'll get a week's grace for launch but no idea how it's gonna go after that. :/
---
Melee hunter is pretty memey, I love the balance druid spec because it feels pretty trolley to play, but it‘s perfectly viable (29/11/11). Deep fire mage is not optimal but very fun to play. Shockadin can be a thing I guess?
---
Short answer: Yes.
---
Innervate should be prioritized towards healing Priests, then other healers, then Mages, before being used on anyone else.  There are several compounding reasons for that.  But sadly, Druids benefit particularly poorly from Innvervate.  Even Warlocks technically benefit more from a Druid's Innervate.
---
And there are few exceptions, with the primary exception being dependent on whether the original stacking regen bug is in a fixed or bugged state on release.  I presume it will be in a fixed state, since I believe it was fixed around patch 1.10.
---
It’s tied to your level, so it goes up each time you level
---
I'm going to be streaming for the first 3-5 hours I go back to classic, just to make a diary of my return, and the feelings it evokes.  It will be streamed privately, no audience beyond my closest friends, and after that I'll reserve streaming for special occasions - e.g first time back in some instances, things like that.
---
People stream for different reasons, some for publicity, some for a diary, some just to share with friends.
---
Once you actually play classic hunter you will realise that you wont have enough points after you max armor, which you should always do for PVE Tanking. Whatever kid.
---
Is there a video of this 20 min BWL run?
---
Hope you get better soon :)
---
Nope, the attack speed was generalized in patch 2.0.1 (TBC).  
---
Lupos lost his Shadowdamage in patch 1.9.  
---
Are you sure you're not confusing the two?
---
Kills the atmosphere. The new Molten Giants in molten core feel totally out of place and make MC way 'darker' than it's supposed to be.

Get a pull up bar and do pull ups while on flight path or push ups or situps.
---
Paladin here Kreygasm
---
Thanks)
---
I think people get confused with the whole "hybrid" reasoning.
---
The only real balance problem with hybrids is in pvp. It's the access to healing that makes them strong in pvp which means they need to have lower damage. If bears and paladins would have been able to tank it wouldn't have been a problem in the same way balance-wise as there isn't really any tanking to be done in pvp. (sure AV and flag carrying but it's such a small part of pvp overall)
---
That's the reason that warriors can have high dps and not the other classes with multiple roles without making them completly unstoppable in PvP.
---
There's also a phone built-in :D

---
It is tied to leveling up and increases by 2 additional conjures per level, starting with a conjure of 2 and capping at a conjure of 20.

For some reason I expected this. 😂😂
---
rnt they making classic on the bfa engine? not sure if they will have the old models for everything - not in the beta
---
In Tarnaris, all the way down in the lower left area, there is a quest were you have to find a Laden Dew Gland. After a few kills but nothing but empty and punctured dew glands, my mind told me that my rogues weapons was the cause of them being punctured. The quest took a lot longer than it needed to. :/
---
That's funny because WotLK era was probably when I met the most people and made friends in game. Finding people for dungeons, my server even ran an IRC based (DKP) Pug for Naxx, we'd even get like 75% of the people back for the next night and it was PUGs.
---
I had so much fun playing, but now all you ever rely on is dungeon finder, so you have to know people outside of the game, like discord because meeting new people is basically a thing of the past in modern MMOs.
---
And I'm sitting here, wondering if I could make a (streaming) career out of playing classic..
---
Diminisging returns. Basically you can overlap these stuns. Without reducing the effectiveness
---
The sport is called football.
---
That's essentially how I played Vanilla, but I did more of the Disc/Shadow spread. 
---
By the time we were in AQ40 and Naxx I was full bore healer for PVE and hybrid for PVP. But I had 1 or 2 of the rarer enchants so i was making enough money to support my habit. 
---
I am not discrediting anything that happened during original-Vanilla by any means, just looking for perspective on a spec that I didnt try out.
---
Completely agree on all the points you made. I'm going to toy around a bit while leveling and get some familiarization. 
---
LoWeR tHaN ZeRo EfFoRt. ShAmE.

I am NOT washting DKP on that piece of crap!
---
There was that one TBC private server, Felmyst, that had just INSANE hype around it. Folded in a day but it was on track to be the #1 server
---
I remember how I upgraded my PC in Classic from 512mb ram to 1gb ram to get "smooth" gameplay.
---
I find it is easier to list classes I don't plan to play in classic so I will roll everything you want to play at once, level each one until it has no more rested exp, log that character out rest and do it again with the next rested character.  I'll either end up going on a tear with a character that ends up being my main because I fall in love or I end up with a variety of high level characters, it's a win/win though as long as you have the time.
---
Yeah, I agree. It takes away from other spots I could put points in, but it could help me push through a damage fight where my teammate is doing well. (Solid mage that knows how to keep his distance.)
---
They would have to keep the amount of beta invites awfully low in that case or stagger them heavily.
---
Interesting. Thank you for the example. Ill check it out after work for sure.
---
Warriors have 2 god tier PvE specs.
---
All the other hybrids have 1.
---
Do you understand the difference between 1 and 2?
---
It's exactly like if I answered "but can hybrids have mortal strike?". Yeah, does not make sense.
---
Ahh plebs. The original E-peen boost! Lol
---
Not trying to be cynical, but with the amount of already-established streamers who will be steaming Classic, I wouldn’t quit your day job.
---
I watched that last night, that's what got me thinking. 
---
I either went Disc, Shadow, or a hybrid of holy/disc back in Vanilla. I never toyed around with the smite spec. Figured I'd get some input from those that (might have) did.
---
He makes a surprise appearance in divinity 2 as well. (Not really, one of the first bosses is just like him though)
---
I did most of my grind on my warrior to R11 back in the day. I'm not going to have the warrior this time around and I was looking for a viable world PVP spec that I hadn't tried. Looks decent with gear. Forgot we were pure +healing or +dmg gear back in the day.
---
The best part of Classic was the forced immersion while playing. You didn't have to decide to explore, you were forced to. 
---
Second best part was the realm relations. I'm hoping there will be no cross realm dungeon finder and while I hope there won't be a cross realm BG system, I think there will be.
---
Third best part was the sidegrades from gear. There was no end be all end for BiS. You had situational BiS items that were required to do certain things. This means, you don't have to run that ONE instance for your upgrade. You have to run multiple instances, MULTIPLE times because EVERYONE needs those sidegrades.

whats druid leveling like?

thanks this was cool, i never found this while i was doing my research.

That’s just from a lack of pump. This is not true muscle loss. Raw strength is still regardless of how much blood is currently running to your muscles.

Didnt meme about retail. Just not into it TBH. Been AOTC on the druid for all of Legion and first parts of BFA. So I gave it the old "college try. "

I specced often in Vanilla. I'm not trying to deny that requirement. But rather reduce the need for it through creative talent build.

Essentially. Lol
---
yeah i watched his video's but he kind of gave me mixed feelings about it.
---
If tank loses aggro to a healer, he is a bad tank. Or the healer healed during pull before the tank managed to land a few hits.
---
Healing spells generate half the threat damaging spells do. And it gets divided on all the mobs in combat with the recipient.
---
I'm still an active sub. Just dont have the "pull" as I have for the past 14 years. AOTC for all of Legion and first raid in BFA. Not a major accomplishment but at least I did jump in the pool vs dipping a toe in and writing a scathing review.

Just waiting for the classic grind now.

for example, also holy nova

Me too. How do you feel?

---
On paper, is different to in practice.   
---
But sure... if the TOP warrior in the world played Tauren instead of Orc, there'd be difference. For casual play, min maxing means absolutly nothing in terms of raid spots.

I unfortunately do not have the side to side real estate to make that work. I'm in a corner on an L shaped desk

In my opinion maraudons hidden wing earth song falls is the most beautiful thing you will ever see in a game

The imp does more damage than the voidwalker, and by nature of being a ranged pull it can hit the mob 2-3 times before the mob reaches it and have a lot of threat built up. Now, in a long fight the imps dps does go way down because it runs itself out of mana quickly, but thats okay because at the end of the fight it's just cleanup - you need that extra burst dps at the start if you are pulling multiple mobs because you want to get one dead asap.
---
You don't use fear as part of a standard rotation, but if you do get agroed when you aren't really ready or if you get an extra add it can be a lifesaver, and an imp will shoot firebolts at a feared mob just fine while a vw will run around trying to chase it and typically fail to accomplish anything useful. When fear expires, since the vw couldn't get close and taunt the feared mob immediately runs back to you, while if the imp has been hitting it with firebolts the mob will run for the imp - big imp advantage. But again, I don't use fear while typically grinding, it's for when things screw up and you get agroed by more mobs than expected, or pvp occurs, or you need to kill one quest mob thati s a bit out of your level range.
---
The other thing is that the voidwalker actually can't hold agro at many levels if you go all out on DPS. An imp isn't better at holding agro, but at least it provides a stamina buff and more damage while you face tank or kite a mob. Leveling with a voidwalker probably works better if you don't wear any spell damage gear at all, but that isn't how I like to level.
---
As far as levels. Obv you use the imp from 1-9. At 10, even if I am primarily using the imp i still do the vw quest - it's just a superior pet for a few situations, but after the quest I just continue to use the imp mostly. Using the imp plays more like playing a mage- you get max range from your target, send the imp to attack, start casting dots as the imp is hitting, and run the opposite direction. Eventually the mob reaches the imp, but if timed right your threat will overtake the imp's and the mob will change directions and head for you instead of killing the imp. Optimally, by the time it gets to you dots and imp fire bolts and a few wand hits have taken it down pretty low, if it's a humanoid it starts to run away at this point but it will just die from dots. In comparison, the same situation with the voidwalker requires you to agro the mob, wait for the voidwalker to hit it and taunt once, dot/wand etc, all while the voidwalker is taking hits and spamming taunt. If you heavily grind with the vw, it's lifepool will slow you down, because you finish some fights with it nearly dead and it's consume shadows ability costs a lot of it's mana. While the imp will die and run out of hp even faster if it's taking hits, if you are kiting as described above it will do fine. I am not 100% sure since it's been awhile, but my feeling is the imp mana regens a lot faster than vw mana as well. And the best part, IMO, is that when using the imp as your main pet you really don't need to worry about shards at all, and it can be used as a disposable pet as often as you want with no serious consequences.
---
I'd typically level affliction, putting 3 points into improved imp after instant corruption. No, I don't put 3/5 into corruption, because casting while moving is critical for kiting and pvp. After 3 points in imp I put all talents into affliction up to shadow mastery, and then fill out demonology to demonic sacrifice for sm/ds build as my initial level 60 build. Depending on whether i had a lot of friends to run dungeons with or not, I might switch to sm/ruin at the upper levels, but sm/ds is better for solo grinding and farming at least until much better gear is obtained.

The era of monitors like the HP 2335, BenQ 231, Philips 230W and Dell 2405. Back then people who cared about visuals (often that decision was influenced by their area of work) would pay way more for the monitor than for example a graphics card, because the monitor was there to stay for a long time. These days you can buy a 4K 144Hz display for those prices. It just shows that over the years displays have become a lot cheaper and instead those guys are now spending fortunes on Titan graphics cards and what not.
---
They can’t just progress everyone. Some people want Vanilla and ONLY Vanilla. Those people should be able to continue playing that. If they force everyone to TBC some people will leave, and the whole “we want Vanilla” crusade will start all over again.
---
Behind every speedrun there are hours of preparation and massive consumable farms, and you would better bring friends for that.
---
Only enough that a 10min video of complaints about it is exaggerating the issue.
---
Yeah I'll give you a complete break down once I get home for work. This build is great and allows you to solo pickpocket farm sm around level 40 and make like 25g per hour off the blues and such.
---
No worries. Thanks for your comment. My job sucks and I got some free time on my hands. But yes.. I'm not sure if I could achieve becoming a successful streamer. You never know if you never try I guess..
---
If you heal well enough, people won't die I suppose? In reality, you can plan accordingly by bringing a shadow priest or shaman alongside you.
---
Yes, indeed!
---
My first 60 was a NE Rogue. I leveled as hemo daggers
---
Discord?  Please. The Anti-Druid crowd are using IRC. Old fashioned ideas need old fashioned means of communication.
---
Allright, thank you for your time.
---
Good guilds can give quite a lot of DPS items to their tanks. 
---
And DPS players do understand that it is a mandatory decision to avoid bottlenecking the raid damage by low threat tank will produce in mitigation-only set.
---
I’m starting to come to the side of the anti-meme crowd
---
That's just straight false, on multiple counts.
---
I posted one a few weeks ago
---
If you dont play the class you want to play, for whatever reason, you’re gonna be unhappy regardless.
---
Play the class you want. There will be a guild for you, with a raid spot for you.
---
Actually there is legal precedent on this if a reasonable person could interpret this as being a health sign it still infringes on the trademark. The case I most remember is when m&amp;m chose a very similar color to reese’s for their peanut butter version. They were forced to change to another so people could distinguish them in a store. The law is weird.
---
(I know you made a facetious post just thought you might find it interesting)
---
It'll take less than 5 minutes
---
" my friend who has a lvl 60 shaman on argent dawn told me that his guild summoned ragnoras to orgrimmar and defeated him. donno if its true but maybe some of you argent dawn ppl can tell me. "
---
Yeah, I think he's pulling your leg, buddy...
---
Destruction Warlock
---
40 people farm consumables together for hours prior to every raid? I've literally never seen that happen ever.
---
It's okay, but the problem is you have zero utility in raids. There's basically no need to bring a rogue instead of a hunter, for instance.
---
Healing is an actual roof of "this fight requires X amount of healing, any healing beyond that is redundant" there are no such roofs for DPS.
---
Therefore gimping healers over DPS so long as you still survive is always the efficient way to go.
---
I can run the Vanilla client on a $200 Windows tablet and a 12 year old netbook. Granted it doesn't look great, but it's playable on both of them. Pretty sure you won't have to spend a ton.
---
Already got that, and Inspiration. Still one more point to spend before I can go up to Improved Healing and Searing light. See [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsV0oZ0xtc) for an example.
---
And then the happy Nightfall shaman strolls up to the boss, and the 1 in a million happens. hits Stormstrike, auto attacks and procs WF, all 5 are crits for about 8k burst, boss turns around and whacks him straight in the face. RIP 15% spell damage increase.
---
And yes, this happened more than once with ours to the point we said fuck it you go resto and smacked Nightfall on offtanks and hunters, like Keftenk said.
---
I did one that was basically ignored.
---

---
Found the idea very much worth a discussion, but people like their memes more.
---
wow came out almost the same time as the iphone ... everyone actually had to call each other back then unless they had msn ...
---
I'd like to see Twins or Nef done sub 5 minutes for instance.
---
im going rogue for a few reasons, its less pressure at 60 for one, you have a lot of funner things to do whilst leveling, lock picking, poisons all that fun stuff, plus you are super sneaky and can avoid ganks or gank whilst leveling. i have played both, but it still excites me when i hear a rogue go stealth! lol
---
good luck with whichever choice you make!
---
AFK in SW at such a high frame rate when it is being raided!\*
---
Personally my benchmark for my build is 144 FPS at highest settings at the gong during opening of the AQ gates. If it can't do that, then why even bother.
---
This is perfect
---
I will be playing Shaman, my favourite race of the available one is Troll, my main interest is PvP both BG and wpvp
---
Spec wise I am probably going to focus on enhancement or restoration, just curious if there's something I should be aware of that I am missing out on by picking a Troll instead of Orc/Tauren. Might change my mind if the difference is too great between the benefit of the races.
---
Welcome to speed runs on private servers
---
No problem!
---
You have to multiply the healing with every group member. If you put an SPriest in a WL group then that is 4x20% of the damage dealt, so 80%. HPS is usually lower than DPS on average.
---
Those are estimations based on raid statistics, so it varies from situation to situation and raid to raid etc. But people usually understimate the overall utility a Spriest brings on the table.
---
There would obviously be free character transfer/copy available, why's this a question?
---
I played 1 month of BfA and been unsubbed since then
---
This was the highlight of Blizzcon for me. I wish they'd do a short series of presentations/demos where they go into more technical detail.
---
Resto shaman new top DPS confirmed, erryboddy reroll.
---
Or you can do 2 raids with those friens instead of 1.
---
Or you can use the remaining 2 hours to play a BG together.
---
Nothing is certain with Blizzard. Remember "you think you do, but you don't"?
---
every class should have 2 god tier PvE specs? :)
---
14 weeks to level 1 week for pre bis, 10 hours a weel is enough to raid if the time matches up
---
Warlock is  one of the easiest and fastest classes to level solo
---
I think it's not going to be that bad. I mean there is support for D3D12, so especially WoW will benefit from that being a CPU heavy game, not to mention that that CPUs are much more likely to bottleneck than GPUs considering how old the game is and most will probably still play at a 1080p res.
---
Nuke proof, I love this quote so much 😂😂
---
Yes but that also means you need to have X amount of healing as a *floor*. So if it takes you 6 real healers to meet that requirement, then adding a holyweaving priest could mean that you're taking 6+1 healers and losing an entire DPS instead.
---
I am going to go mining and tailoring while levelling, saving all my mining materials to respec to engineering at 60, or shortly after. For me, tailoring is an important part of the class identity of the mage I want to play - being able to make your own robes and cloth gear fits into what I find fun about the fantasy class. I'd say do what ever you want, if you want to run engineering and mining while levelling then go for it! The only thing I would mention is that on fresh servers, you might struggle to find enough nodes to levelling engineering consistently alongside your character level, so you may have to stay behind and grind the zone out before moving on and hunt for nodes, but if this doesn't bother you then no worries!
---
&gt;raid leaders shouldn't think you can't raid at all with some odd specs here and there
---
&gt; they're in a casual guild that raids 1-2 times a week.
---
&gt;We managed to get almost all raiding content down.
---
So you raided more than twice a week, and didn't clear all content. Meanwhiel one of those "min-maxing kings" does raid twice a week, AND clears all content, from ZG all the way to Naxx. Why? precisely because they don't allow the meme specs and expect 100% efficiency from their raiders.
---
I'm one of those very raid leaders you're singling out, We'll have one feral druid out of the hybrid non-healing classes and that's it. We would be able to get to and kill Kel'Thuzad eventually with full hybrid roster, but we wouldn't be doing the 20-40 min clears of ZG/MC/BWL/AQ as we do, and spend so much more time raiding than we could be.
---
When you value efficiency, the hybrid specs are no-go.
---
I may be confusing the time when it was changed, as it was a long time ago. I played heavily in 2004-2012, and got to Marshal on my Alliance Hunter. I was sure that in Patch 1.9, around when AQ was released, hunters all stopped using BT as their PVP pet, cos it no longer had such fast attack speed. 
---
It was round about patch 1.9 hunters pets all started having their own talent trees, and I was sure this was when BT got nerfed. It was certainly before tBC was released.
---
It's not just the loot, it's the people. Who gets to have a spot in a raid. You are managing raid efficiency, guild progression and player happiness in every raid that you organize:
---
- You want to have the best players with the best gear because they give the most 'power' to the raid. You deal more damage, heal better, avoid aoe's better, the raid goes smoother.
---
- You also want to have people in the raid who can actually profit on the commonly dropped, average items. Things like tier pieces or trash drops that can accumulate fast. These are good items but not the best
---
- You also want to make sure the majority of the players are happy. Sometimes its better to give an item to a player who is helping the guild in other areas than combat (defuses dramas due to personality, contributes to guild bank, etc)
---
Managing guild size is also an issue:
---
- You want to have a big guild so raid spots are always filled easily and so that you have bigger owPvP zergs.
---
- You also want a smaller guild so each player feels important and can have a raid spot. Nobody wants to be in a guild where he can't raid even if he signs up for it. If people leave, they might encourage their friends to leave as well, and now you have even less people than what you've started before that big recruitment wave.
---
- You also can't rely on single players too much. They can leave any day, or get sick, or stop playing all-together. A random dps is easy to replace, but your best geared class leader? Or the main tank?
---
Or prot paladins during the wotlk pre-patch.
---
Think I have narrowed it down, as much as I would like to do spriest or ele shaman I don't think I'm going to want to fight that hard to get gear to make them as strong as I would like in pvp, healing or trying to dps on priest is going to be frustrating until  aq/naxx, and yes I know you can just get the pvp gear etc but I fully intend on getting full bis on a character this time around.
---
So I'm looking at mage, warlock and haven't ruled out rogue, who is scarier fully geared? Which class even you see them riding up to you when your defending mine are you just like fuuuuuck not this guy again
---
No cross realm bgs. It’s fucking lame
---
Druid leveling is very fast, because you have practically no downtime, travel very quickly and you have stealth to get past difficult parts for a quicker reward.
---
Your friends are not up to date on Druids I can tell you so much. They are very good and likely the optimal raid off-tanks.
---
But keep this in mind: If you want that to be true you need to go the extra mile. Warriors can get their gear mostly from dungeons, crafting and raids. Feral Druids get a lot of good stuff from reputation factions, including PvP and crafting. It is fun to gear a Feral but also not as straight forward, which is probably why your friends think they "suck", because they haven't yet played with alot of good feral tanks.
---
I'm pretty sure it won't happen but I definitely would like it to happen.
---
They did detect it and banned all accounts with a wave just like today.
---
Rogue/warr the least fun to level they are gear dependent and often stop more to heal up. 
---
Locks are great but if you aren’t alliance then you will have a shitty time with aggro. They are more utility on horde until super late. 
---
Mages are the master ranged class imo. They have little aggro issues, easy to level, they make their own food. Super great cc and well rounded aoe/single target. Once the game phases into AQ they go fire and top meters. Can go mage either faction and dominate pvp/pve
---
I’ll be crawling straight to durotar after the first 4 quests, getting me a doggo
---
Shes more excited than i am
---
Certainly, I'm not the RL to aim for the floor however since at that point any singular mistake would be a wipe, in that case I'd have brought 7 healers anyhow, which still ends up a net-gain.
---
There are most likely "breakpoints" where it evens out or even slightly tilts in the SP's favor, but overall I find that very hard to believe, especially with their ranged restrictions and all that hassle.
---
I'm considering a holy priest though I have some doubts. How annoying is it to run around the world and having to kill things in a healing spec, and how bothersome is the whole downranking part?
---
Wow, how come no one has ever thought of that? People must have missed this interesting take for the last 14 years. Time to replace the mages with Moonkins and Rogues with Enhancers and Ferals!
---
Ok, if you want to talk about percentage, to gain honor at rank 13, you need to be in the top 0.2% of your faction.
---
I mean, technically it already does happen, however the damage credit of the WF goes to the person who hit the boss, not the person who is supplying said buff to the raid. All it'd need is to change something in the code of DPS mate to transfer WF data and Nightfall Proc data over to the Enhancement sham to see what their actual dps brought to the raid is.
---
Oh yea that definitely makes sense.
---
You really have to drink quite a lot. It's not as bad as the warrior or rogue but you'll spend a very long time on your arse quaffing epic conjured spring water. Whereas a warlock/hunter if played properly will never have to drink or eat. 
---
I'd also add that because there are so many mages, playing it casually means you'll have trouble finding spots in raids and BGs. Warlocks and druids are much rarer, but still needed so you can easier get a spot.
---
Buy the 24inch 144Hz now, then upgrade in 2020 for a Samsung curved 49" 4k 120 Hz TV.
---
Man you should really just fucking read up on the honor system before spreading all this bullshit. 
---
Also it's 0.3% in 1.12 which is what classic will use.
---
Good sarcasm, but seeing as it was followed by talking about something that was never mentioned in my post. I'm going to have to award you a 0 for effort.
---
I've never mentioned replacement of classes, but a bit of infomation that is pro-inclusion of other classes deemed to be doing useless/terrible dps.
---
That's assuming all the snipers are willing to throw away money into a 2nd subscription, to have another twink on the same server, since Vanilla did not allow having both factions in the same account/server.
---
Or am I missing something?
---
It's not simply about getting sued.  
---
The Red Cross is meant to be a symbol of immunity in the theater of war, attacking someone bearing the cross is a war crime, as is falsely wearing the cross.  
---
Yeah WoW is just a game, but the Geneva Conventions are extremely serious and having that symbol associated with a combative game, especially in the context of attacking players that are displaying it while trying to heal, is something that should be avoided.
---
Yeah that’s the right attitude!  Keep at it, and if you begin to make some money off of it then definitely make the switch.  Just pls don’t kill yourself going full pro before you’re making any money
---
Unless you have a lot of muscle, you're fat. 
---
You're 5 inches taller than me and almost twice my weight (175lbs). I think i'm between pic 120-175, no way you're pic 175.
---
My brother has your height, he's about 220lbs and that's already pretty chubby.
---
Yes people have done all sorts of calculations over the past 15 years.
---
It's still not worth bringing meme specs if your goal is to clear raids as fast and efficiently as possible.
---
Shamans/rets aren't as good at keeping up Nightfall debuff as hunters and offtank warriors.
---
Resto shamans can provide windfury
---
Holy pallies can provide all the blessing
---
One holy priest can spec into shadow weaving for shadow damage debuff
---
The druid crit buffs are only group wide, so raid dps increase is minimal
---
Roughly 250 DPS (300-320ish with SW:P) an amount of this will not be VE damage as it's from wand,
---
Sure we get an HPS of 240, but that's not the effective healing. A warlock will life tap roughly once every 3 shadowbolts, or 9 seconds. It'll be healing 100% hp warlocks over half the time which also severely de-values it, and it still costs you debuff slots in shadow weaving, SW:P, VE and mind flay (mind flay is a ½ scenario), while still needing to stick within 20 yards and channel as opposed to 36 which poses all manner of issues as well.
---
People may underestimate the Spriest, but putting it in a vacuum also showcases it as in a much better situation than it is.
---
To be honest, I think those were later patches, SOJ I think might have had it. Been a while!
---
and that minority will ruin economy for majority as resources from profs that may sell for 10g would sell for 3g as there would be so much of them available. Instant level wouldn't work pre cata.
---
„Mages with  Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian can open a portal to Deadwind Pass and trick the party“ just checked some other guides and I already like this page
---
it apparently hasn't occurred to you that resto shaman are equally capable of dropping a windfury totem, sorry to ruin your entire post so quickly
---
What about putting it in a warlock group?
---
There's no way someone can answer this how you want them to
---
What is the reason for Sham and Ret not being as good at keeping the debuff up? Due to a non spamable melee attack?
---
just checkout legacyplayers dot com ;)
---
From scratch
---
&gt; I'm hoping there will be no cross realm dungeon finder
---
There's no dungeon finders in vanilla, there's not even ways to teleport the dungeon.
---
They have no spammable attacks to force NF procs
---
My bad, I was looking at the pre-1 .12 column
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0_formulas)
---
But chill man, no problem, we’re just exchanging here :)
---
Still, depending if the phase 2 length, 10 r14, per faction per server might be a bit high 6/7 maybe. We’ll see :)
---
The automated LFD was introduced with patch 3.3.0, before that we had the [Looking for Group](https://web.archive.org/web/20090807221227/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/lookingforgroup.html) which is what GW2 has. Only it was limited to the local realm, GW2 uses a mega server.
---
you need 2/2 healing focus.
---
Even for 100% pve?
---
No stuns on the druid side, but you still have one stun in bearform (bash), roots, heals (very useful in OWPvP, especially in 1vX or XvX)
---
Stunlocks are primarily useful in 1v1 situations, where you can lock someone down to death, if you are in 1vX, you might be able to CC one other person with sap or blind, but gotta be quick!
---
A wise man indeed.
---
I will heavily consider Warlock.
---
Troll is the least good shaman race for PvP. But I'm probably going to roll Troll for my hunter as well because I love them so much.
---
But if you want to min/max, orc would be the way to go.
---
I'm, not looking or an absolute answer as there isnt one at the moment, I want peoples conclusions based on the data we have, which is from Pservers.
---
Is someone making weapons with red cross? Is someone selling products on the basis of the red cross? Marking a hospital or things like that ingame etc is 100% harmless. If anything it brings more awareness to the red cross.
---
God Blizz has turned to shit
---
Yeah because using a red cross ingame for healing causes first aid workers to die.
---
Nope, troll is better.
---
It works. As someone working in media I can tell you people like to watch the person who speaks to them. I actually also don‘t like looking at a mini screen at the bottom of my video with some guy infront of a mic but they do it for a reason
---
Well, if you read the 1.9 patch notes, it says "Base pet speed is now standardized for all pets, including legacy pets. Pet speed can still be modified through the talent [Bestial Swiftness] and pet abilities such as [Charge], [Dash], etc."  
---
This is movement speed, so all pets now have the same movement speed after patch 1.9.  
---
Lupos also now deals Physical damage instead of shadowdamage.  
---
The Pet Attack Speed was generalized in patch 2.0.1 (TBC).  
---
Maybe you are confusing the attackspeed with the movementspeed generalization?
---
The watch to synchronise raid times
---
Ohgee just posted a video about how he predicts speed runs to be the new competitive factor for classic, since world first is not really a matter of figuring out tactics etc. 
---
I personally won't enjoy speed runs, and am fine with playing casually and just enjoying my raid time.
---
There were hand weapons with three stripes in circulation, yes.
---
I've lost a lot 20 pounds in the last 2.5 months, which is difficult to do with chronic pain and sometimes limited mobility.   I totally agree that you shouldn't ever "graze" while gaming.  Often you'll shovel all the foodz down your gullet without even enjoying it because you're focused on pwning the noobs xD.
---
But seriously, DON'T EAT AT YOUR PC/LAPTOP.  Set aside time to actually eat and enjoy your food. It'll also recharge your mental batteries to take a step away from the game :)
---
The only thing I bring into our office when I game is a bottle of water or coffee...in my Epic Coffee Mug, ofc!
---
Sorry but all damage is being calculated. If there was a huge potential for extra dmg if you bring a enhancement shaman over a resto shaman that would instantly become meta. We really did not misunderstand or overlook anything big.
---
It definitely could be done, I'm just not sure if Shino is willing to program it. He has a discord where you can leave suggestions if you want.
---
Ooooookay good sir.
---
*dying laughing*
---
Clearly the mods don't care about their own rules.
---
Uh......
---
I do this, until the need to nap kicks in. My vaca week is going to be waking up at like 7-8 to go lift, come back and eat/shower. Then play until 12-1, inevitably take a hour nap or so, then play again till like 11 with dog walks every 2 hours or so. 
---
I love Classic, so much. But my health isn't sitting backseat for anything really.
---
1200 dmg from holy shock crit under trink?  Cmon
---
Again, I'm not talking about Min/max here at all, just that people shouldn't be scared that they are bringing nothing to the table if they play the class or spec they like.
---
I feel like i lose a good amount of conditioning and strength after 2 weeks off. I definitely feel doms more for sure. But the second week after coming back from 2 or so weeks off, is fucking great. Joints all fresh, etc.
---
You can heal dungeons as any spec you want. You really only need to care about healing talents at 60 when raiding. So go with what gives you the best level experience
---
&gt; how bothersome is the whole downranking part?
---
You normally have 2 ranks of a heal on your bar, max rank and mana efficient version. You can look up a guide to find out which rank it is, for me as a druid, it's rank 4 for our main heal, healing touch.
---
From there you have PW:S max rank always, and Renew which can be downranked as well, but not usually as it is pretty efficient as well (priest mains can correct me on this one)
---
As for running around the world killing stuff as healing spec, it is slow, but not as painful as one might expect, you will be wanding.... a lot.... and I would highly recommend leveling as shadow. 
---
Leveling you can heal as a DPS spec without any issues. I have done it as feral many times, where even my gear didn't have spirit/int on it.
---
I am actually building a budget build just to play classic as I only have a laptop which only can just run runescape
---
\*\*\*WHACK\*\*\*
---
aaaahhh I knew I would need my  [Foreman's Blackjack](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16114) again !
---
We raided around 2 times per week, more if we had people online and almost got all of naxx down. if we had 2-3 more months we'd for sure clear it. 
---
And since classic is here to stay, you'll have 5 years to down content.
---
Hopefully people just leave your guild and join a more casual friendly one instead of feeling forced to play specs they don't like, because having fun is more important than being efficient to 99% of all the guilds =)
---
You certainly don't need to level as holy, as you can still heal as shadow for 5 man dungeons pretty well. When you are 60, ideally you should have a profession to make money with rather than grinding. But remember, you can still grind mobs with a friend, can still be profitable.
---
As for deranking spells, I personally like it as you can respond to the situation with the correct spell. It may take awhile to get used that's all.
---
Slightly tangential question here:  How long did it take for summoned items to despawn when you went offline?  Was it instant or did you have a little time?
---
WoW 2, a mobile exclusive
---
I would go Alliance just to avoid WF. if you go horde you constantly need to keep an eye on your shaman so you are in range of the totem and make sure you get put in their grp.
---
Melees fear mages, casters fear warlocks (literally).
---
As for mass pvp bit of a tossup.
---
Warlock has the edge in sustain but will require more micro management with your pet. (It's not hard to be honest, just make sure you turn OFF autocast for things like spell lock, and devour magic)
---
Hey chill man, no problem, we’re just exchanging here :) 
---
I’ve read it but my bad, I was looking at the pre-1 .12 column
---
Anyway the number of r14 per week is 1/3 + 0.3% of the population/5
---
Where 1/3 is the first player of the faction that will gain 2k rp (and that requires 5k to up, so 3 weeks, with 1k floating rp that could be given to someone else...
---
0.3% is the group 14 that will gain 12k RP minus minimum 11k of decay link to rank 13. And 5 the number of times you’ll need to gain 1k. To go to rank 14.
---
Do you agree with this?
---
I belive it's 15 minutes.
---
You need First Aid 10/10.
---
Engineering is almost a must have for warrs, and a must have for tanks.
---
You learn a new rank of water at 10, 20, 30, etc. and food at 12, 22, 32, etc. 
---
You start out making 2 per cast at the level you learn them, and make an additional 2 per cast, so 4 water at 11, 6 at 12, 8 at 13, etc. They max out at 20 per cast.
---
Also, keep in mind you learn the appropriate water and food for your level, but after 5 levels for water and 3 levels for food, you can use better water and food that is purchased from vendors.
---
Idk if its the same in all countries, but at least here u can finance a laptop with like 0% interest and just pay a few euros a month in fees plus the actual payment. So for a laptop which can run WoW im sure like 30 bucks a month would suffice. Not that much if you want to experience launch :)
---
Someone did alliance, so I am going to do horde, as for horde you have orc and tauren primarily.
---
Orcs have stun resist (15%) as well as axe specialization (from memory could be wrong), and finally blood fury which is a dps trinket type idea.
---
Next is Tauren who are amazing tanks with extra hp which gives a bit more survivability.
---
As for faction vs faction, windfury totem is amazing DPS increase when it procs, as well for tanks totems really are nice to have. Do they offset paladins? Paladins do more for the overall raid, shamans amplify their group.
---
I'm in the boat of "does it matter?" Because only people pushing hard for progression won't take "meme" specs anyway, and that wouldn't change their minds.

Depends on where all his [fat is stored](https://senioraerobics.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/types-of-body-fat2.jpg). Lucky people have it spread throughout their bodies, some have it 90% stored in their stomach so everything else looks skinny but their stomach is past their balls.
---
Does this guide cover any pre-raid BiS gear found in BRD? With the latest Blue text specifying the versions of gear that we can expect to get in phase 1, I figure it something we can narrow down now.
---
I've thought about this as we don't have a wand and idk wtf to do with my hands when I'm waiting to heal.  Maybe I'll melee stuff now.
---
The zone you get into after clearing dwarf/gnome starting zone (can‘t remember the name and not talking about westfall) and another zone you won‘t believe me: I never quested in the barrens. I tried to avoid it like a mad man for some reason

wow, never realised that. cool tip, thanks.

thanks, i will do some more research and go from there.

appreciate your replies.
---
Also, druid tanks are a lot better on Ally side, since they benefit frpm the raid having Salvation, as well as HUGELY BENEFIT from Kings. On the other side, Druids can't trigger windfury, so no benefits on Horde.

Engineering/Blacksmithing. Yes it can be a drain, but people can feed you materials.
---
Engineering has a shield found here - https://www.wowhead.com/item=18168/force-reactive-disk  which helps your AOE tanking.
---
You can tank as fury or arms in 5-mans, may not be the "MOST EFFICIENT" but you have defensive stance and a shield still.
---
Not true, as achievements didn't exist in Vanilla, they were added in... what Wrath? You can't have something added when they didn't have a database to track it. I still have like 3 60s on my first account with zero achievements.

I think raising awareness to players looking on vanilla with Fresh Eyes that, your not a useless, selfish player if you play sub-optimal spec, does matter. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I totally agree that Min/max has a place but so does fun and playing freely as you wish, I've spoken to several people now who have felt pigeon holed into specs or classes they don't like because they are worried they won't clear content.
---
There is no point to discuss your example of the Shaman, as neither Nightfall, nor Windfury is Enhancement-only. Same with Shadow weaving, as a Healer can specc into that, although 1 Shadowpriest per raid in later stages of the game is not unusual, still not necessary though to get the buff.
---
The only other two raidbuffs for damage that behave differently and are coming from meme-speccs is Moonkin and Feral aura, as they can't be emulated and the Moonkin aura gives a rough dps increase of 100-120 per full mage-group in standard not too bad / not too top end Frostmage raidgear.
---
&gt;8.7. Avoid Misinformation
---
European?
---
Yes, but most servers gate a lot of quests to emulate patches. For instance Silithus should be empty until 1.8 and 1.9, but it probably will be populated on classic.
---
Overlooked to be honest. The biggest drawback is not being crit immune on raids which makes them a bit more scary to have early in the raid tier, and pre-T2. T1 has basically no epic gear for druid (minus the non-main pieces such as belt/cloak/neck/rings etc).
---
You have a higher health pool than warriors to compensate for lack of crit immunity, your armor is very high to make up for lack of block.
---
And threat generation is much higher as a druid.
---
I myself, tanked naxx 40 patchwerk primarily, I was offtank as hatefuls were eating our warriors so I stepped up and had a great time, and we were able to bring him down.
---
It will be a hard road, but it's possible!
---

---
Be shadow, annihilate the first guy who targets you.
---
MoP, WoD and Legion balance druid is fairly unique and there's not been anything like it before or after in WoW. Don't know about Bfa since I don't play it.
---
Closest thing to a dungeon finder in vanilla are the Meeting Stones. Which for a while I forgot existed for a while.
---
Retail has it listed at 15m, which sounds about right. I played a mage quire a bit in tBC, and WOTLK. I don't remember there being a specific timer before, but it didn't go poof when you logged out.
---
I used to make water and food and trade them with someone, and they would trade them back to another character or mine. Usually I would offer food or water in return, or a port.
---
Any hybrid healer, druid I favor myself, as even as feral you can heal, as well as crank out extra damage to speed things along.
---
I don't know why OP wants a paid transfer, but I sure as hell don't want a forced transfer. I want to play vanilla. I have absolutely no interest in TBC.
---
Damn, demonic runes... That is an absolute critical in the nostalgia.
---
Do the professions you want
---
People can play what they want and raid leaders can decide to accommodate them or not I think being sat or unable to find raids will force the issue. Same goes for 5 mans if the leader doesn’t care that’s their choice but if they discriminate against the meme spec it’s not necessarily the leaders problem if that person gets mad. They just want to build a optimal group to clear the content in a timely fashion.
---
Cross realm bgs have to be in imo
---
#nochanges
---
I used to to proc it all the the time while leveling up as a moonkin the last few hits of a mobs health. Seemed so satisfying back then
---
PepeLaugh he didn't know
---
Both have some huge draws, if you want to raid, as DPS slots will be super competitive I would recommend going shaman.
---
Totems are ALWAYS welcome as they bring huge utility to the raid. And heals of course are always in demand for a raid.
---
If you are going to primarily run around the world solo, can't go wrong with a hunter.  (Well technically you are never alone with your pet but still)
---
What vw means ?
---
Again this is looked at from a min|max angle, not a more casual angle. 
---
There are lots of peopled pigeon holed into a spec/class/race combo they don't like, because they feel that they won't be raiding (at all) if they dont. I just thought this comment by a user was fairly refreshing from that trail of thought.
---
You knowing how to heal as your class is what's most important. Just grab a hybrid spec dood and they can Rez for you
---
What's the best vanilla class for a havoc demon hunter main? For PVE
---
Buffs aren’t damage as much as you think they should be. A meme spec with windfury is going to be dramatically out performed by other specs benefiting from that same windfury.
---
Void Walkers, thanks
---
There is no way the (majority of the) classic playerbase would accept pets, emotes or stickers in the game.
---
The whole game is a meme nowadays, why would you want any symptoms of that in a legacy game?
---
Yes their range is an issue that is also overlooked. It limits them in some areas. An even bigger concern is their lack of AoE though.
---
But the point is I rather have a Spriest who does decent DPS and a good amount of group healing (which varies how you correctly stated) than a gimped holy priest who has to refresh the debuff. Holy priests already have mana issues. They almost always get my innervates because of this. To gimp them to apply shadowweaving seems like a weird tradeoff to me.
---
There are also other considerations why it is a good idea to get a Spriest. They gear slightly differently from other casters. They need less +hit than any other caster and no +crit, so all they really care about is +damage and mana. They can find really good pieces/sets from PvP and off-pieces from raids that aren't as popular for other classes. Also for example the off-set from AQ fits them super nicely.
---
Feral Druid is pretty much the same as dps.
---
As tank not even that. Had people leaving the group before starting zulfarrak... It was hard to be a contrarian back then. 😕
---
yeah, i really enjoyed tanking in wow and played a warrior in Vanilla actually.  But i want to do something new and i am assuming that there are going to be a ton of people jumping on the warrior bandwagon i want to be a little different but i don't want to hate my life for picking a class no one will take a long on raids.
---
Speed runs are a thing on pservers some guild recently cleared Naxx in 1h 8m which I believe is the new record for pservers.
---
Oh man does this bring back memories, LFG jailbreak!
---
Awesome video dude, awesome.
---
Oh and I totally agree, and it's nice to hear people say it so eloquently rather than call people playing sub-optimal selfish etc. 
---
There definitely needs to be more love in the sub for people's desires to play random things! Rather than a Ret pally asking how they can spec to be a more supportive DPS and being screamed at to go holy.
---
Then set aside 2 hours to raid and 2 hours to pvp or something, if anything your getting more done in the same amount of time
---
I plan on doing a full run with two RL mates, jailbreak and all.. I fully expect to not have the same other party members for the whole thing with us though!
---
[If they told people what is inside it would've stayed the underdog.](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/beaver-butt-goo-vanilla-flavoring/)
---
Hmm still hesitate.
---
Alliance till late TBC...then horde.
---
I want to taste the old spice again with alliance but... Windfury is on horde side sooo I think I will flip a coin at the screen.
---
Did they do a blanket nerf on SSC/TK?  It has been so long I can't remember but I do remember the blanket nerf on Sunwell + I think almost everything else near end of TBC.  Makes me wonder if we get a "classic" version of TBC ... are they going to undo the blanket nerfs or just leave everything as the pre-wotlk state which dramatically reduced Sunwell difficulty(and everything else).
---
Hi, /u/RoughishAroma
---
Or, a way to get yourself into a less populated starting zone.   
---
Last time I leveled "fresh" I ran my UD priest to mulgore due to it being the lowest pop 1-10 area. By killing some mobs on my way out of the UD starting area and exploring I was halfway to lvl 6 by the time I got there, and it took my 45 minuts (pretty much the same as doing the 1-5 area would have taken). So no, I wasent ahead of the curve, but I was in an area with a significant lower amount of ppl for the level 5-11/12 part of my leveling.
---
Yes but the comment this person was making was that if a an enhancement sham is laying a WF totem down, and this totem affects 4 other warriors for example. 
---
These warrior then each get a WF Procs for 500 damage, which means the Sham has Essentially hit for 2000, + whatever he is hitting + the windfury he might get.
---
I had just never looked at it like that, which is why it peaked my interest.
---
Ugh I was with you til the end.
---
Damn alis ruin everything
---
I didn't even know you could run through bwl in 20 minutes
---
My main character was a mage during vanilla bc, and wotlk. At the beginning I really liked raiding as a mage, but after a while it was kinda boring. And I was not having a lot of fun during PVP.  
---
One of my best friend IRL and in WoW was playing a Warlock and I was very jealous of his character, especially in PVP, he seems so powerfull.
---
Wait, will it? I assumed they wouldn't add in anything until the AQ war effort opens up, since it makes up like half of the quests there and it seems silly to have the rest of the NPCs without the war effort.
---
P
---
I want to echo the adventure part, one of the biggest draws was the social aspect of the game. You were *FORCED* to talk to other players, but even with that you *WANTED* to. Having a second person with you, was a huge benefit. 
---
For grouping, you made friends who you "grew up with" (in levels), so when you hit endgame and started going through groups, maybe wiping a few times, nobody got angry. You were too busy having fun with your virtual friends to care about the time.
---
And people knew your name. You were not DRUID_2349802 to someone, you were "Druidzilla", friend or foe they knew you, and if you were good at your class, the enemy stayed AWAY from you.
---
A good way I describe classic is this: "go to a world where you escape, not to a world where you want to escape". Since end of cata (mostly Dragonsoul), I felt like the world no longer drew me in. I didn't have the same connection to my character as I did previously. 
---
Too many times I would just sit in a major town and just buff people, talk to random strangers, or travel across the world to help some low level group with a random dungeon or quest they were struggling to complete.
---
The success or failure of classic wow, will be on the community, as it should be. Retail is all about the devs, but classic is all about the players.
---
This fear of not being able to raid with a meme spec is totally unfounded in my opinion, because just like in vanilla back then, there will be a ton of guilds on a server, not just one. Some of them will aim for optimal preparation / specs / effort and not take an inferior meme spec in a raid and others will raid for the joy of being together in a raid regardless of spec and outcome.
---
The success of those guilds will of course also be different, but there are top guilds and average and bad guilds, and you as a player (I mean not you in specific) will fit in one of those guilds and raid just as it has always been. The casual angle player will be in a casual guild with casual raids and likely a casual type of success and there's nothing wrong with that.

It's better to quest the way you want to

I'm all for this change, but what about using poison gas and the likes, that's also against the geneva convention. Or is this just a case of blizzard changing it without really being legally forced to do it?
---
If you google classic wow warlock leveling guide that link I posted is the first thing that pops up. Really not hard to find a half decent leveling guide for any class in classic wow.
---
Talona, My ex gf, had a Dell XPS laptop from 2004 that I think cost $3500 or more.  After a year of 16 hour wow playing and catching all the crumbs from the garbage we ate it would overheat if you didn't clean the fans regularly.
---
&gt; or by getting to max level by staying in 1 place using the dungeon finder....

Altho most prolly hate this guy, he still makes a great point about running dungeons in vanilla and it's actually something I'm looking forward to.

So long as you can drop totems while swinging that Nightfall, you will have a spot.  Vanilla raids, at the top end, stack Warrior DPS.  Every Warrior group needs a Shaman dropping WF totem as well.
---
What most hybrids, including Warriors, do not seem to accept is that the raid will call on you to tank or heal at times.  That could mean during certain fights or that may span several weeks at a time because a core tank or healer is not able to raid.
---
Because people get salty whenever someone’s told to google something specially a question as a simple as a leveling guide.
---
&gt;And 5 the number of times you’ll need to gain 1k. To go to rank 14.
---
No.
---
If classic is successful, I do think there is a possibility that Blizzard takes a page out of Runescape's design philosophy by letting players vote on upcoming implementations. That essentially could create a "WOW 2" in a sense.
---
I mained a hunter during vanilla, and it was a lot of fun, and easy leveling. My alt was a NE warrior, that I ran fury and prot. Both were fun, in my opinion. Vanilla tanking is a LOT different, but I enjoyed it.
---
You need 40 people, without using raid finder. That is almost as hard as going into the raid itself. It lends to NEEDING guilds and actual meaningful player interaction and relationship building. This is why we love Classic so much, the game mechanics force you to build a great community to fully experience the game

---
Blackhand's Breath is a bit controvertial among feral druids, because it is one of the BiS options for a DPS trinket. The problem is that Mark of Tyranny is not only *the* BiS tanking trinket, it's not even close. SHotM is about half as good, and the next best trinket is miles behind. This is a classic case of vanilla wow being a cruel mistress.
---
If you are going pure dps BB is technically better, but the problem is that if you are playing high-tier pve feral druid, or even casual tier raiding and don't want to suck, you need to be able to tank, dps and heal all in one raid; your gearset prio should be (in my opinion) on tanking first and damage second. The whole point of bringing a feral druid to a raid is its massive versatility, and to be versatile you must be able to tank bosses. If you want to go pure DPS you are sadly better off rolling rogue.
---
EU, used vent over TS through BC and WotLK.
---
Not a single thing I disagree on other than it being unfounded. This sub, is one of the premiere sources of WoW Classic information at the moment, and is currently piled full of min/max style posts and answers to questions. This does have an effect on what people play. 
---
I'm lucky that I have never had this issue, but I see it crop up alot!
---
I mean look the odds are stacked against you but if its something you want then throw yourself into it when you're not at work and put the hours in. Only way you will be able to succeed. Go hard and always stream like you have an audience of 1000s and who knows maybe one day it will happen.
---
Jokes on you, I never had a career to begin with.
---
You will be taken on raids, you may be healing for quite a lot of your time (by swapping gear mostly), which is fine. There will be a few fights where you will step up as well.
---
I have never regret playing druid since WoW release. There's just so much to the class. I healed the majority of naxx, as feral. Yes I wasn't topping healing meters, but I was able to hold my own with my decent gear.
---
This time around, my guild has me as their "token" feral, and I will be tanking a decent amount. Until we land in AQ, tank gear for feral is rough, as tier sets are class-locked. Once we enter AQ40, you get a tier set which is designed for hybrid, as well as REAL feral weapons. (Green dragons also drop a feral weapon but the DAMN THING DOESN'T EXIST I SWEAR)
---
Even healing as a druid is interesting. As you have 2 hots (one with a cast time, other is instant) you have a ton of flexibility to move around, while heals are rolling.
---
I said it before, if you are a skilled flag carrier for pvp, people will be screaming your name in rage as they can't pin you down.
---
For sure, play druid. No matter what role you fill, I guarantee you will have a blast. (Seriously who doesn't want to do REAL stealth runs? 3 rogues, 2 druids walk past everything)
---
This isn't true at all..otherwise there would be no hand of rag or thunderfury achievements in vanilla, which I have from 2005. It just says the date added was 2009 when achievements unlocked.
---
Saving this thread incase something crops up! This would be awesome.
---
E
---
But you put the Resto shaman in the group with 4 warriors, they also get the WF procs and instead of the Enhancer, you put in another warrior in the raid, gaining another 2-3 Enhancers worth of DPS with one single player, thus saving you two additional raidslots for the same amount of dps your raid can output.
---
You mentioned earlier that it's not about replacing, but whether it is intended or not, the replacement happens automatically as there are limited raidslots available. I know, I know "but from a casual perspective". But from a casual perspective, anything goes. Just don't expect the same outcome, and if you don't, then who's stopping any guild from meme-ing their way to victory?
---
+4 DKP for raiding on a hot day
---
the old armor was designed for the old character models. for example:
---
you know how some of the boots and gauntlets from vanilla have that "cuff" on them? like the Field Plate Boots and Field Plate Gauntlets.
---
on the old character models, it looks fine. but on the new ones, the cuff becomes HUGE and looks really stupid.
---
keep the new models OUT of Classic! #NoChanges
---
Exactly, one of the best things about exactly having to travel to the dungeons is that it gives them a sense of place. That is, you’re not just being teleported to a floating hallway, you’re actually travelling to a real place in the world. It gives your dungeon experience a proper grounding.
---
Yeah, I rolled a fresh hunter on the launch of "that big pserver" and spent hours trying to get The Rake, but there were about 10 other hunters there and every time he spawned, someone would kill The Rake just for spite and it was a huge waste of time.
---
I ended up grabbing one of the orange tigers that look really cool on the islands by Troll starting area.
---
At around level 26ish I think...can't remember, I tamed one of those cool looking cats that way up north in Stonetalon where you have to kill the deer, slimes, and other crap.  I discovered that those cats have really fast movement speeds, and with dash they are crazy fast.  I had a blast using him until I was at a level that I could tame Deathmaw, which was my end game choice for raiding.
---
How does this stuff get upvoted..
---
Next let's make it so only 30 from the same guild can join a raid while you get 10 randoms. Let's just remove competition.
---
Buffs have never been calculated that way they never will. You play a shaman to support your group because you know it brings windfury. If your guild leader is building a group and he’s going to look at this two ways one he may be giving up a healing slot he needs fillled that could be a problem. Also by that same logic all the shamans even the healing ones would appear to be doing damage even if they never touch the boss. The second thing he would have to deal with is this change making the meters a mess where you can’t actually determine the performance of your dps classes because well all the damage they are physically doing is being funneled to the resto or meme specced shaman. Now how can the leader accurately judge which specs aren’t pulling their weight if they fail a dps check. That’s why I oppose this functionality change.
---
Ore than that yes, as you decay will become bigger and bigger.
---
Week1: At 55k rp, you’ll gain 12k, loose 11k.
---
Week2: At 56k rp, you’ll gain 12k, loose 11’200.
---
Week3: At 56800 rp, you’ll gain 12k, loose 11’360.
---
Etc
---
You break even at week 23. 
---
So yeah, 10 rank 14 is drastically too much at the end of phase 2
---
If it helps, many of those gearsets only vary by 1-2 items. The difference between DPS Burst and DPS sustain is basically just the helmet, and PvP Fight is almost the same a PvP Kite, just with a couple extra damage items thrown on. Finally the healing set doesn't have to be particularly strong, its basically jsut random engame gear you can find that has a lot of +int on it. Later on in raids, you can slowly pick up the tier gear that drops after the resto druids no longer need it, and use that to slowly replace your healing set.
---
If I had to reduce it down to its bare bones, you could be effective as a feral in raids with a tank set, a dps set, and the aforementioned low-effort healing set. Don't bother with PvP gear if you don't have time to commit, but that applies to any class.
---
Or 0 points in prot.
---
&gt; Hopefully people just leave your guild and join a more casual friendly one
---
Why ever would you want that? You'll be shooting yourself in the foot. The people that would be keen on joining my guild are the ones who share my view, obviously.
---
Why ever would you want to mix the casuals and the min-maxers rather than keep them separate so both types of players get their ideal enviornment.
---
&gt; because having fun is more important than being efficient to 99% of all the guilds
---
Some players have fun by being the best and doing their best. What's fun to them isn't seeing johnny thundercock get his Dark Edge of Insanity as an enhancement shaman, it's clearing BWL in 22 minutes as opposed to last week's 25 because we perfected our strategy.
---
Seeing other peoples viewpoints is a very valuable life skill that I'd suggest you work on, I fully see yours and don't demean it, I'd love it if you'd return the favor.
---
People are calling this stupid and I understand their outlook, but this right here is a very well explained reason. 
---
It sets a precedent that's not worth damaging.
---
The more the merrier?
---
GK Chesterton, in the early 1900s, said it better:  
---
"An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.”
---
Yeah I don’t see the problem, it’s a niche post. Where else can you show off your atlas?
---
You're argumentation there only works if prices are the same on private servers, which they are not. Dreamfoil does not cost the same on every server, the pots you make with Dreamfoil does not cost the same on every server. 
---
So speculating about profit margins is impossible, since currently they vary drasticaly between the 3-4 "active" private servers you can imagine they will vary even more between the (speculation) 40-50 official classic servers.  
---
This is the exact same reason why videos explaining that "this is where you should grind to make money" needs to be taken with a grain of salt. You always need to research the current prices on the server you are on before conluding weither or not it is viable for you, same goes for buying/selling mats or finished products.
---
If you're good and put time in to learn your class it's no problem.
---
o
---
&gt; and why the retail crowd will never understand that
---
Why would we never understand that? Wouldn't classic be an opportunity to get a better understanding of that?
---
If you play more, just play one alt on the other side or other server. That way, when they all quit you can continue on the other ;)
---
This, absolutely.
---
The boss mechanics aren't always super complex but the gear barrier is much higher. Resist gear for many bosses is required otherwise your tank will get MELTED.
---
Tanks are the backbone of the raid, there's usually 2-4 depending on the raid, up to 6 in naxx 40. (Yes 4 horseman is a pain without having the extra 2)
---
The raids themselves are much slower paced, with the mechanics being less intense (no massive movement, explosions everywhere and such). More of a test of stamina, with fights lasting 10-15 minutes sometimes. And healers have to be healing for that amount of time. (And tanks, getting hammered on for that duration)
---
You go to raid for the gear, mostly. I fully expect bosses to just FALL OVER up to AQ40 where there's going to be a ton of hurdles for people who didn't actually raid classic, and Naxx will be a wall for the majority of the playerbase. (Due to the gear investment for resists) Even with that, the raids are fun. Hanging out with 39 other people you know, is a blast.
---
Nnnnnice. :D
---
30/0/21 is the best spec for elem pvp, NS is just insane compared to EM
---
Thats where the problem is, lot of people loves Classic but playing fully progressed game wont be fun forever. People would start to quit, realms would turn to graveyards.
---
Thanks for the info and links! (:
---
The irony is, now that Balance has consistancy in how the spec plays - I miss Wrath era Balance so fucking much. 
---
Give me **Starfire** back. The long cast time that hits for a fuck load, that rng stuns people, that I could fast cast with my set piece + NG for huge burst outta no where.
---
Give me **Starfall** back. Not the AoE "this isn't surge but there are 7-9+ targets uggghhh" we have now. I want to press it, have a moon above me head and STARS rain down around me hitting everything as I cast spells. 
---
* Give me insect swarm back damnit.
---
* Give me back cat form pounce.
---
* Let bearform actually matter again. 
---
* Give me feral charge bear back. The one that interrupted and physical rooted. 
---
* Make clone base line.
---
* Make my heals actually matter.
---
* Make mana matter.
---
* Give me tranq back. (And let it heal through LoS WTF)
---
* Give me fairy fire back.
---
* Give me thorns base line.
---
* Give me trees that were an actual cd.
---
* Give me the old Typhoon back. That slow moving wave that went god damn 30 yrds. Nothing was more satisfying than getting a clutch typhoon on dal sewers. It felt rewarding. It felt awesome and I loved it. 
---
* Give me back hurricane!
---
* Give me back old eclipse. I don't care that it was RNG. Having Starfire as my main spel, proccing Eclipse and dumping 40% damage increased wraths felt good. What we have now is casting any non-empowered spell feels trash.
---
Druid use to be about using everything in PvP. A Moonkin that only did damage/Cloned was nothing compared to one that used everything.
---
Will definitely be interesting to see if the numbers hold up when comparing pserver clear times vs. retail clear times. :3
---
The absolute biggest difference is actually the fact that the game is not as much just about raiding as retail. Questing and leveling is a huge past of the game. It will take most players weeks, if not months, before they even step inside a raid.
---
Besides that the mechanics of bosses are easier and your tools to deal with those mechanics are much much worse, so it's still difficult in its own way. The loot is probably where you will notice the biggest difference as a "linemember" :P
---
There are more players in the raid, but still less items dropped per boss.. So gearing up the entire guild takes ages and how you distribute the little loot that drops is way bigger subject than retail.
---
On the other hand you have the concept of best in slot item's witch hardly applies to retail wow at all, because of titanforges and socet/tertiary stat procs. Getting a best in slot feels amazing, because you know for certain that you can't get anything better.
---
But we can still SPECULATE based on the numbers we have.
---
What part of speculation don't you understand?
---
Yeah I vaguely remember some preview where it showed how DKs would work. From what I recall, you’d turn your EXISTING level 60 character into a death knight, losing that character in the process.
---
Yeah and I've got friends who can carry me even if the pre raid bis isn't all there.  Shaman t1 should be enough for me, even if the +heal isn't always the best.
---
Are you implying I'm not ok with eating beaver goo?
---
They are fun, for sure. Definitely more strategy involved. The only thing is, they're time consuming. Lfg in a main town, finally get the group full, then start the long journey to the dungeon. Scarlet Monastery as alliance is one of the long journeys I will always remember.
---
Haha nice, I'll have to give it a go before Classic hits and consumes my life!
---
Damn. I was unaware. :o
---
There isn't alot of positive threads about these specs, and I get why. I just think we shouldn't be putting people off them as much as we do in the threads. Sometimes very harshly as well.
---
In general, I'd expect a lot less rep from quest and turn-ins in Classic compared to any pserver
---

About 4 hours.

/S
---
With the plan to have sharding, I don't think it will be super effective, unless you are traveling from one of the popular starting zones (UD/Orc+Troll) to the Tauren starting area for example.
---
I'm more of a "the journey is the destination" kind of player. I might do that on a character eventually, but I'll be far too engrossed in all the pre-cata areas to take that much of a detour my first time back.
---
What you're saying about branding is true, but it isn't hard to say at all.  It'll run Classic just fine (even better if they redo Windows).
---
Yeah I'm not sure. I don't think the AQ specific quests will be in, but there are like 20-25 other quests in Silithus and other areas that are being implemented through vanilla. I'd imagine most of them will be in Classic but I don't really know.
---
And then get the hand of Edward the odd to add to your mini game!

Never raised in classic - but certainly was a lowbie watching the raiders in the guild.
---
There was never a raid night without controversy.
---
4-10 people was standard to be missing at the time of raid.
---
All hell would real loose - 3-4 more would drop off because their friends hadn’t arrived.
---
Get used to sitting and watching people slowly boil over.
---
I know I did.
---
thanks man, yeah i know i may have to heal and tank in the same night i am pretty ok with that.
---
Perhaps you overestimate and I underestimate the importance of this sub with 78k subscribers in the grand scheme of things. And in the end, it will probably even out somewhere in the middle.
---
I would assume that on reddit for a classic wow hype, the amount of people with a more "serious" mindset to be greatly inflated compared to the overall player base. An average player surely won't frequent and involve themselves in those types of discussions for a longer period of time.
---
Oh, by the way, the calculations exist. You could also do theoretical calculations by yourself based on a static fight, at least approximately. Let's say for Frostbolt with average raidgear, you get this example for the Moonkin:
---
1200dmg/2,5sec cast\*2crit modifier\*0,03 moonkin aura\*4 mages = \~115dps
---
I just don't think doing it for an Enhancer, whose job a Resto can do just the same would be a fair calculation to justify having an Enhancer at all.
---
You laugh as people are running around dying (because of fear nd dots)
---
Well, I can only speak for myself, but a forced TBC upgrade would make me quit.
---
This is a fully progressed game already, and I'm sure Blizzard will periodically launch fresh realms, maybe merge old realms. If people don't want to play Classic anymore, fine. That's no reason to force TBC on people who like Classic.
---
All the mentioned guilds were amazing. As someone that was playing all day every day didn't come close to what they achieved I look back and get filled with awe.  The fact we randomly selected a server that had 2 of the top guilds in the world and were a part of their early stages of building up their characters early on is just a great memory for me.  My Gf and I played enough and were the right classes, we could have joined any of them, but I had 8+ friends (that I still have) from back home that were playing with us and we didn't want to leave them behind.  I made the right choice.
---
Rogue or druid are kings of WPvP. Rogue is much better at 1v1, druid is the best at 1vX.
---
Stealth, heal, roots, forms, the skill requirement to balance all of it is higher, but well worth it.
---
Alternatively, Hunter is good out in the world, as you can kite melees into the ground, and pets do a good job at keeping spells pushed back for casters.
---
As long as you don't PvP I'm with you. Being so damn big makes us too easy to click.
---
Technically though, the Resto Shamans are bringing that DPS. Of course we could go down a Rabit hole of saying "Arcane Int is a buff to damage" which now you've made that statement I can totally see what you mean about the damage being sparadic!
---
Hey man, 
---
If you’re still PC less like a month before before launch let me know. I might be able to piece together a decent enough rig from spare parts.
---
I gave up a LONG time ago, but I'm looking forward to classic release, very much!
---
According to my research, you get about 50% less rep overall from city reps before spillover rep is applied. I'm still working on the document and plan to post it before too long. I expect it to be the most downvoted post I've made so far because people just can't believe that private server rep values are wrong.
---
Because new doesn't = better.
---
I think they're vastly over animated. Dwarf running is bobbing up and down way too much. It's like they made them as animation as possible to show what they could do instead of trying to preserve the race fantasy we've grown to love.
---
that's the most retarded explanation I've heard in a long time
---
Most guilds actually had a bench as well, like 3 or 4 people just waiting around in the chat Incase people didn’t show up or dropped out. 
---
Flexicble raiding is one of the best things in current wow (obviously doesn’t apply to mythic). It’s so helpful for casual players though because if you have 12 or 19 people there’s not much of a difference.
---
Do you want to remain melee? Warrior or Rogue. (Or ret pally if you want to be meme status)
---
What I like doing is fishing work outs.
---
Fishing is mind numbing and I hate it, but its a good time to take a workout break. Every time you hook a fish do 10 push ups. Cast off again, the next one you catch do 10 sit ups. Rinse and repeat for like an hour or whatever fishing milestone you're trying to hit.
---
But flightpath workouts are something I've done before as well.
---
Summoning stones would be a welcome addition though.  Getting replacements was a nightmare without it.  Chain running was even harder.
---
This guy is just preaching astrology. Geneva convention had nothing to do with the change

---
It'll be fun - the dungeons in vanilla had so much character.  Even a bar.
---
To ba fair grandpappy Malorne had a thing for the moon. Maybe attraction to large rock woman runs in the family.
---
They bring the buff the dps do the damage. Like I said dps has never been calculated off the buff a class brings and it never will.
---
Well, I for one am most definitely looking forward to watching. \^\^
---
Yep! Be sure to talk to your guild, a good guild will know this, and they will prioritize you for tank gear after the main tanks, and give you leftover heal gear to keep you relevant. You probably not be getting gear early in raid tiers but once stuff starts falling, you will have more gear than you will know what to deal with!
---
I wish you luck! If you aren't thinking about pvping, be sure to think of it, druids are MONSTERS.
---
Yeah, the language is a little absolutist - I apologise. But my point is merely that if people go into it with the wrong attitude - an attitude informed entirely by WoW in its current state - their experience will be doomed from the start.
---
Geometrically?
---
Goodbye
---
I was thinking of getting into a vanilla private server just to get the feel back for the game. But then if I spend that much time leveling on a private server, an I going to want to do it again when classic is released? It's a struggle...
---
Found it, thanks! (:
---
Then Im going to speculate that the profit margine you can see will depend on the current market price of the server of your choice.  
---
Also, that some herbs will most likely be more worth selling straight then crafting, unless you have the highest value pattern that said herb includes into. Example: Gromsblood is used as part of Flask of the Titans and therefore have a pretty hefty cost (normally). So given that Black Lotus are optainable in quantities like on private servers (not very likely) you will most likely make more money selling Gromsblood as herbs, unless you have the pattern for Flask of the Titans.
---
But again, there are so many unknown variables stil that speculations most likely wont lead to anything usefull.
---
It’s sad that you both chose to keep that last friend around.

I'm gunna have to disagree. I don't consider myself hardcore #nochanges but being required to walk to the dungeon or find a warlock is a pretty significant part of vanilla to me.
---
O
---
Yeah id say im #1.   Anytime i do work out i seem to lose it evenly from everywhere.
---
After classic, I fully expect retail to go free to play/50% off subs and Blizzard to start working on a new MMO full time. Retail is dying. The sentiment I gather is that each expansion is holding less stable subscriptions for less overall time. Maybe the numbers will prove me wrong. I just think it's time for Blizzard to move on. It's hard when every game to come out since Vanilla was effectively funded by the success of game and its expansions.
---
Found a guide [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/vanilla-wow-cooking-guide-1-300/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/vanilla-wow-cooking-guide-1-300/) 
---
Basic guide for horde, and ally.
---
The main thing is that meme specs generally don't bring anything that isn't just core to their class. Sure, an enhancement can provide totems, but so can any other shaman. A ret paladin has blessings, but so does any other paladin. A healing priest c an spec into the shadow damage debuff. There's only a select few things like feral/moonkin aura that are actually unique to the spec.
---
Shamans are pretty bad wielders of Nightfall as well, they just do it because their DPS is so atrocious that they might as well. I mean, enhancement DPS is legitimately no much higher than that of tanks. Their totems are basically the same as a resto shaman's. Unspeakably terrible PvE spec. You can totally succeed at raiding with an enhancement shaman, but the spec has zero redeeming qualities and objectively weakens the raid.
---
Im not saying im beefed out, but yes id say im well above average on muscle.
---
Hulk hogan is my height and he weighed 303.

So just picture a chubby wrestler
---
Vanilla raids are more about preparation than the fight.
---
Most raid bosses have 1-3 mechanics, and that is simpler things like move out of the fire. Classic rotations are much simpler too, e.g mage is largely just spamming frostbolt.
---
In Legion and subsequent patches, raiding (speaking of LFR) or world raids, you run up and use your entire arsenal to do as much damage as possible while avoiding injuring mechanics.   While the mechanics in these fights were complex in the latter half of the expansions, they were also way more forgiving.   You could pop all cooldowns and do massive damage while standing in the fire for a few seconds to make sure you got as much out of the cooldowns as possible, the healers could top you up for awhile but eventually you'd move (or not).   Little risk of pulling aggro off the tank, making a mistake on movement would either drop your health significantly or outright kill you.
---
In Vanilla things were different.   Doing mass amount of damage with all cooldowns would pull aggro, easily, especially early on.   And if you were squishy you would die, in one hit.   THis wouldn't just off you but could cause a chain reaction as the tank now has to fight to get the aggro back (much harder in Vanilla) while the boss one shots squishy after squishy.   Easily destroying the fight, since back then boss timers were quite unforgiving.   Most guilds would clear content with seconds on the enrage timer regularly.   As for mechanics, most boss fights were pretty basic, unless you were kiting, CCing or doing stuff of the like, but standing in the fire to get the most out of your cooldown, not gonna happen.  You'd take way too much damage for the healer to stay on top of, you'll get screamed at in chat, and you'd die.  And with not a lot of druids being in raids, you wont get a brez.   Now the raid has to work harder to make up for your loss of DPS/healing.
---
Mana is way different as well.   While now you seem to have a blue bar that rarely budges in raids, spam all your stuff and you'll be fine (healers mostly) for the entire encounter.   Vanilla it was much harder.  OOM was a death sentence for the raid, but also for you.  Not having the ability to maintain your job and mana meant you'd be replaced by someone who can.   Drinking after a every fight was a guarantee, not a courtesy.
---
Grouping does mean less competition for kills. I myself, am going to be grouping for the start as a druid 1-10 SUCKS, and 10-20 sucks a bit less, but 20+ I blow past literally everyone.
---
With that said, if I see someone in an area I am questing, I always invite them, unless I am 1-2 kills away from leaving.
---
Making friends helps you out a lot as you level, as you will be set up for the end of your leveling, as well as when dungeon groups are popping up, they will look to their friends first.
---
So when you say BS subs for Dash, do they not stack?
---
The bosses aren't FFXIV rip off mechanics vomit that are impossible without DBM
---
Your theory—or what have you—is why raids bring a single member of those meme specs. Using 2 debuff slots to buff 4 locks dmg by 15% is worth it. If we assume a spriest does 40% of a lock, 4 locks doing 15% more, when transferred to spriest, makes him nearly a full dps. 
---
what if you bring a second? Now each spriest wants a debuff slot, so now it takes 3 slots to run 2 priests. The debuff is still 15% and still 4 locks. Assuming spriest is still 40% of a pure, each spriest now only does 70% of a pure. With 3, it’s 4 debuffs for 60% of a full dpser. What do I really gain with 2 spriests? Well, shadow weaving goes up in 3 gcd instead of 5. So it’s a gain of 3s at 15%?
---
Same argument can be made for multiple nightfall enhance. 
---
But none of it really matters, with good healers, mc/ony/bwl is a 10 healer affair. You want 3 tank specced warriors. Assume 4 of every pure dps: mage, lock, rogue, hunter, warrior for 20. That leaves 7 slots. If you go 5 of all pures that’s 2. Drop a hunter for 4 total to get 3 open slots, one for a spriest, one for enhance, one for feral.
---
I never had any problems leveling cooking while I quested without a guide.  Every quest hub I go to, I just check the innkeeper and trade supply merchants for recipes that pertain to the animals in that zone.  I will list the first couple that you find as Horde if you want some examples.  Note:  these are just off the top of my head.
---
  One of the first recipes you get when you take cooking requires Chunk of Boar Meat.  There are tons of Boars in Durator so kill boars when you run by them and you will get more than enough to take that recipe to grey.  Then at XR there's a recipe sold by the trade merchant that requires Strider meat.  Guess what you have to kill loads of while questing...Striders...so that gets you to like 120 or more until it's grey.  The same vendor that sells the strider stew recipe sells the next level of food which needs thunder lizard tails which there are also a butt load of and several that you will kill for quests as well.  You'll be like level 175 cooking just from that and haven't even left the barrens yet, then there's the Savory deviate delight recipe.  If you get that, get your fishing to 25 and farm those to cook up and you'll level your fishing/cooking, and make lots of money.  That money maker is almost guaranteed.
---
The subject of the thread:  "**How are the profit margins on buying mats and selling the potions you make?"**  
---
I gave you an answere saying that it will most likely vary from server to server. And that for some herbs you will need to have the "best" option of craftable in order to make money on crafting rather then selling the herb.  
---
How is that not in tune with your subject?
---
Started playing after some work friends recommended it and had absolutely no clue what anything was. First character was a Tauren Warrior. 
---
Got Leatherworking and nothing else, not even skinning, so I never leveled it. 
---
In the Barrens people asked me to tank Wailing Caverns. No clue what tanking was, ended up being taught, very kindly and politely (which looking back now is amazing) how to tank. Using sunder and such. When first loot I ever say dropped in that WC I saw the "Greed" or "Need". No clue what the difference was but since "Greed" sounded mean I didn't want to seem selfish or anything so I hit the button "Need" because it didn't sound as bad. Turned out I actually needed the gear but later on was told the difference after a different drop. The group I was with was so nice it made the game super enjoyable for a noob like me. Thinking back, that WC run might've been a really big deal for me and getting to learn more.
---
UC has Varimathras and Orgri has that one elite guys at the entrance near the bank that is truly the hardest boss of the game
---
You live an interesting life, lol. Unless your 4 girlfriends live with you I don't think you'd have that problem anyways.
---
To be honest, it wouldn't shock me.
---
Also I wouldn't be shocked if they just continued the classic timeline, by releasing Hyjal, caverns of time, and various other things that were planned for vanilla, but never came to be.
---
It came out 2.5 years before the iPhone, but text messages were still a thing, not to mention AIM and IRC, amongst other tech. Even Teamspeak and Ventrilo had been out since early 2002.
---
Hah, not exactly, more of a hidden diss on people who see Classic through a tunnel-vision lens of min/maxing endgame PvE.
---
lol! Those goddamn sound effects got me
---
If I'm an investor, or a mega shareholder, I'm thinking classic signifies Blizzard's lack of faith in the future of retail. Perhaps it's the death throes of WoW paid subs altogether. Maybe they switch to a cheaper format. Maybe they move on. I think they just want to appease as many people as possible with the best of both worlds (classic and retail) before dropping a bombshell some time into Classic.
---
If I were raiding as a Boomkin, I'd expect Warlocks and Mages to get gear priority over me.

You are completely ignoring the point of the thread by repeatedly saying "it doesnt work". I made this thread to have a discussion based on the knowledge we not, not to hear about the knowledge we dont have.
---
This is exactly what I love! Didn't think I'd see this. Taking a a week off work but definitely hitting the gym everyday of classic launch.
---
Yeah I can totally see what your saying. Does the same thing go for getting a Druid Tank for the buff rather than a Feral DPS for the buff and then having another pure DPS?
---
Maybe. I'd say a good portion of these comments are people in the age range I described, explaining that they are still single and that their reasoning was their 10 year prep for classic to re-release. lol
---
If it’s the same sub how does it surpass retail?
---
If you are playing classic you’re also subbed to retail and vice versa.
---
That guy in particular (name we Kulrich or something) was a bit of an asshole. 
---
But we had plenty of people who weren’t assholes jump ship during the Naxx race from our guild (Transcendence) to our rival guild Exo or server transfer. 
---
Sometimes even if the other guild was only one boss ahead, just how it went. People get antsy when you’ve wiped a lot and they have a goal in mind.

Like reading an ignorant thottbot comment from 2005

Raid size &amp; Gear
---
Usually you want to quest solo. But when you roll up to Verog the Dervish’s platform and 12 people are waiting for him to spawn, you try to get invited to one of those groups 😂
---
Drop quests you solo (find 6 zhevra hooves). Kill quests you can group for (kill 12 waterseekers, 12 thornweavers, etc) if theres a bunch of people tagging those mobs.
---
Shhh. Don't let the people in this sub know that there are literally dozens of us who play retail but are super excited for classic.
---
Huh?
---
I'm surprised they thought Ony was so much easier than MC. I always thought they were about the same level.
---
I forget the details honestly but I know they did some nerfs. I think it was the same time they fixed Vashj and Kael'thalas to be actually possible, but the one that I remember is that Al'ar would fly to fairly random places originally and then they had him kind of go in a circle or something like that. I was loving it as a tank but we needed some of our newer players to play better, and then they nerfed it and it became a boring fight. I forget what the other nerfs were but I remember that one really well.
---
It's been over a year, almost two. and a chrome book could probably run the game
---
You can spam Wing Clip endlessly for Nightfall procs.
---
I've actually tried this before. She kind of liked Elder Scrolls but fell off. We played WoW Retail in Legion and she got upset because we were levelling too fast (hit 65 in like a few days). Maybe she'll like vanilla but she likes to read every quest and just drags along slowly. I may be forced to do that anyways with the vanilla playstyle so it may work. But, usually I'm doing things quick since I've been playing this game for fucking everrr.
---
It would make people quit, but would bring more people back, TBC and WOTLK (pre 3.3) were great expansions.
---
#Doubt

It's pretty easy for blizzard to distinguish bots/scripts from genuine players.

Literally a 300 dollar laptop from Walmart would be enough to play classic.

no dude, 6'-4" should be ripped at 220. Weight increases exponentially by volume.

That was rude as fuck. All they really needed to do was dot everyone once and watch them squirm for the last 10 seconds of their life.
---
Wisp master race.
---
I actually want an enhanced graphical version. The gear is so ugly as is. It's even uglier with less polygons. It's about the gameplay for me. It's not purist, but it's less consequential than changing core mechanics.
---
A little bit of muscle if you're 15
---
This is gold. I love how everything was an epic mystery. It's not impossible to do that now, but unlikely since you'd have to avoid any sort of open beta, and take steps to limit data-mining. I miss that sort of ignorance.
---
I downvoted you because you complained about getting downvoted
---
Probably rogue
---
Most vanilla boss mechanics revolve around a single or sometimes a few players not fucking up. Most fights from MC to late BWL you can just stand around doing nothing but dps/heal and once in a blue moon you'll be hit by a living bomb or a rain of fire and have to move. The tanks however will always have to move, control the boss position and swap targets etc. By AQ you the mechanics start affecting more of the raid which imo is more fun. But it'll also highlight the bad players in your raid and it can become quite frustrating to have that one person who can never interrupt Skeram or drags Sartura through the healers etc. 
---
Another big change is the amount of people you can afford to lose on a boss attempt and still kill it. Less so during Naxx though, but even on KT you can afford a few people dying. 
---
Having more than one of each class is also quite different. Especially for the mage/warrior/rogue team which will probably fill a good 40%-50% of your raid. Having class channels where you can talk while raiding is pretty fun. 
---
Another thing that definitely is different is that the trash quite often is harder than the bosses. For a normal guild the suppression room and trash before lootdrakes is actually quite hard, whereas the bosses are very easy. Same in AQ where the trash before and after Twin Emperors is much harder than the boss itself. So painful in fact that a guild back in vanilla hacked the game files to make Skeram's platform disappear so you could jump right down to CT. The entire guild was banned for it. 
---
Many say resistance gear is a big thing, I wouldn't say it's that important for most players. As a dps/healer you won't really need resistance gear until AQ and that's only if you can't get Viscidus down with AoE (melee still uses it for Huhuran). Sapphiron is probably the only boss which requires the entire raid to equip resistance gear. The tanks though will need resistance gear on Raggy and several other bosses and warlocks need shadow resistance gear for Twins. 
---
But the absolute biggest change out of everything, will be threat. It is such an alien concept to everyone who started playing in or after Wrath. Probably to those who played before as well as they haven't used threat for over a decade. Having to balance your damage depending on the tank's performance is a huge part of vanilla raiding. And don't forget healing, if you are too quick to heal on bosses where adds spawn like Fankriss you'll get whacked pretty quickly.
---
Sorry, I mostly meant for people who have already purchased BFA and aren't currently subbed.  I'm sure there are a lot of people who are in that spot but are waiting for classic launch to re-sub, so in that case I'm spending my 15 to sub to Classic and getting the ability to play BFA for "free".  I'm aware that BFA needs to be purchased in order to be able to play it.  I would have liked an option to only sub to classic personally, as I would imagine others would, because we know anyone that is about to jam classic likely has little to no desire to play retail.
---
Speedrunning Vanilla is a yawn fest because it’s less a test of tactics, and execution and much more a test of pre raid effort and organization. 
---
Speedrunning is also a natural effect of playing an mmo, your farm kills of a boss will be faster than your progression kill, simply due to gear, gear goes up across the raid every week. Speedrunning guilds who get more weapons on average, or have their weapon drops front loaded towards the beginning of access to the instance, they will have an advantage. 
---
That said, outside of intentionally gimping your team to make content hard (raiding 40 man’s with 20 people, or allowing PvP specs in raids, etc) speedrunning is the only avenuefor raid competition. But similar to getting World first nefarian the second time through—who cares? 
---
I’m all for being efficient, but a 30 min bwl isn’t even fun, it’s like getting gratification from taking ALL the candy left in the bowl on Halloween. 
---
I dunno, I’ll be making consumables all of classic, I’m hoping to spend the first year stockpiling them for aq/naxx. I really see no reason to pop anything in mc/ony/bwl/zg.

Have you seen the population of some of the private servers running vanilla?
---
Second this. I always level cooking while im leveling my main for the stam/spirit buff and you do not need a guide just follow the natural progression.
---
I never said it didnt work, I said it all depends on what patterns you have, what part of progression your server is on, and what herbs are being farmed (high supply = low prices) on your server.  
---
Ok, to give you an example from the server I play on atm. I have an alt with maxed alchemy, and my main is herbalist. In the past I used to sell Dreamfoil since I didnt have the patterns for the Flasks that use Dreamfoil, aka I could make more by selling it to those that had. But after ZG came out and you can make Mageblood potion with Dreamfoil and Plaguebloom I make more money by crafting those and selling, then by selling them straight. Now that's just me crafting what I herb myself. If you're premise is not to herb, just craft then there's a lot more to consider.   
---
Fluctuating prices for one, but that's more based on "playing" the AH then spesificly for alchemy. But just to quickly explain what I mean by that: You can make your entire profit margine by buying pots on say saturday (a day where many ppl dont work and hence play/farm more = prices go down) then you sell the same pots, without even crafting them yourself, on wedensday/thursday (the most common raid days of the week = when most ppl are trying to restock their consumables).
---
So yes, it does work, but giving an exact "you will make x amount" by doing so is close to impossible.
---
Warlock most fun - watching people die to your dots
---
Warlock most annoying - literally 0 mobility
---
Best reply yet.
---
Personally, I've played PC games all my life for the graphics.  Since Wolfenstein and Doom, over the years the most exciting thing about upgrading video card and PC components and getting the newest games was what the latest and greatest graphics would look like.
---
If fact, it's kind of funny, but when my buddy had me try out WoW, my first impression was that the graphics were not that great, but I ended up loving the game play enough to overlook that.
---
If there's an option in Classic to turn on the latest and greatest graphics for the game, I'm turning it on.
---
any range classes with similar rotations/mobility?
---
Inner Focus and Power Infusion are two of the best talents in the game.
---
I hate to admit it, but watching Asmondgold's autistic rants about how WoW sucks now compared to what it was is somewhat of a guilty pleasure...
---
The vanilla wow subreddits are all jam packed with people who 1. have never set foot in AQ or Naxx and 2. talk about it like its the only thing that exists in vanilla.
---
Probably not too much. If you get a rare recipe then there might be some money in it. Flasks are great moneymakers if you can get a clear BWL every week. Markup can easily go to 15-20g per flask if not more. I don't think flasks will be used as much in classic as in vanilla though and the recipes are quite rare. Transmutes are good money too. Arcanite is good and easy to make. On private servers transmute essence of undeath to water is usually more valuable, but Classic might be different. 
---
Overall it's a pretty mediocre profession. You'll always have someone in the guild who can craft for you, usually for free. I'd suggest getting engineering instead because it's the only profession that gives you something extremely useful that no other profession does. 
---
Herbalism is also very good money.
---
There is nothing better then having close to perfect gear at every lvl... im going to run through sm for like 20 times untill I have everything I want
---
The minimum specs for current WoW are still incredibly low:
---
2.8GHz CPU
---
4GB RAM
---
Intel® HD Graphics 530
---
Too soon. Too much pain from the last time.
---
S
---
I was never expecting any exact figures, and never claimed to. I just wanted to know what level they end up with for the people that have kept up.
---
If you switch it off, everyone you see will have the old graphics. It's like Starcraft Remastered.
---
I'm unsure on Alliance race tbh. Dwarf or Human. Min maxing aside, I find both of them to be cool. I prefer dwarf customization options, human model, dwarf 2h animations and I kinda dislike both 1h animations.
---

---
Relying on world buffs as part of your BIS setup might work on janky private megaservers where the ony head is popping off every 5 seconds. But that won't be so easy on retail classic.
---
hahahaha XD
---
15s-20s
---
Yeah, I could only find one that posts when wowhead posts front page news on their site. I don't care to see 99% of the content on their front page. A classic blue tracker bot would be awesome though.
---
'for all the noobs posting here, it takes 40 people to clear out molten core, and they all have to at least have their rare class gear and be extremely skilled, except for the pallies, which have no purpose except spamming cleanse.'
---
lol
---
You needed to kill KT to make Atiesh, so your guild was already full clearing Naxx
---
 Or did he leave right after the first kill? Because that would be a shitty move.
---
/thread
---
This is not sarcasm or a joke. I really am dumb as rocks when it comes to tech. My honest thought process was, “old game, old computer, should be fine?”
---
True, but from level 5 to 13 that first wand will do more damage than any skill or spell you have.  You can literraly just wand everything without using spells and face tank mobs.
---
Seriously. I played a NE arms warrior and was allowed to dps in raids in vanilla. Unless you’re in the top guild on the server, no one cares what race you are. If you are hardcore, they *might* care, I don’t know.
---
Any guild that says “You’re a gnome rogue, not a human, so you can’t come” is a guild that I would want no part of.
---
CaN I rIdE tIgEr aS gNoMe aT lEvEl 12
---
Because you never will be able be picky about tanks, unless you find it fun waiting to find groups much longer.
---
Ya mon! I raided as a troll priest in vanilla. Who needs good racials when you have da voodoo?
---
This is very true.
---
Also, lots of BiS gear is crafted or obtainable from PvP(depending on the phase). Melee dps who bring consumes and have things like lionheart helm will be taken to raids.
---
This should absolutely be mandatory. The amount of pre-mades to try and boost someone faster to r14 is going to be insane.
---
It’s going to be entire pre-mades trying to funnel one person all of the kills while 3 rogues stunlock healers and the chosen one murders everything for quick and easy HK’s
---
My bro is rolling warrior first thing, i'm going shaman. I'm going to have him order me a pizza after I out level him and he needs help with things like WW axe. 
---
After 60, i'm bank rolling a warrior. Buying full Scarlet set, and other great BoE's to make it a cake walk.
---
LUL at the dude saying his team of 30 level 60s can take out any group of 40.
---
I'd also go with appearance over racials. Dwarf or human for me.
---
R
---
Stun resistance is just too good for pvp.
---
Can we have classic first and then worry about stuff like this lol.
---
I was actually kinda hoping they'd change up the fights a bit so players would be surprised. Keep the same general feel of vanilla but change a timing, or a debuff, or something..
---
I am responding from personal experience of leveling a few characters. But you do seem to know my story better than myself. I do love your attitude toward a community you see yourself a part of.
---
Thank you, this is very helpful! This is very comprehensive and yet simple.
---
What do you typically do after crossroads? My personal preference is to not fish much while leveling unless I'm waiting for the boat.
---
What is then?
---
If by "help organisation" you mean a propaganda arm of the church, you are right.
---
And you are right, they are not using copyright law. They are using the Geneva convention.
---
**Which only makes them more outlandish assholes**, because the Geneva Convention put that symbol underprotection **TO PREVENT WAR CRIMES.** They did not put it under protection so some suit wearing assholes could troll people who make goddamn video games.
---
They claim that the use of the symbol in videogames "dominishes the significance of the emblem". Sure thing dude...aaaand, claiming that some Indie studios broke the Geneva Convention because they used a 5px wide red cross doesn't, amirite?
---
"Defend" this idiocy all you want my friend...it won't make it any less idiotic.
---
At 25 years old and on launch, I was the  old guy; some people even called me grandpa. Now... Here we are. Many of you fucks are finally 25. I laugh for about 5 seconds before I realize that I am 40, then I start laughing again. Why? Because now, I lean into it! 
---
Welcome to World of Grandpa-Land.
---
No shit
---
Don’t do it. Wait till 60, when you’re done leveling and have a mount. Obviously grab the fishing and cooking books while leveling and save them. Takes 6-8 hours to level fishing to 225 and cooking to 300.
---
No. Only spell with similar mobility is blink with I think a 20s cooldown.
---
I would say if you have patience, and a lot of time to brows the AH you can make a lot of decent profit of it. But you need to constantly be checking, and sniping the "under average" AH listings.  
---
Also one tip I can give you as an alchemist is the craftables that use fish. Since if you are herbing and selling your herbs you tend to want to maximise your own profit hence not undercutting to bad. But with fishing most ppl will fish in order to cook up some buff food, and so the alchemy fishes they might catch is to them "an added bonus" hence they might not pay to close attention to the going rates when they post them on the AH.
---
OP brought up a good topic. But my faith in humanity just decreased a tiny bit.
---
This is the stupidest fucking thing I've heard of in 2019, and I live in the US under Trump.
---
True, and he's hard/impossible to like because he can be such an ass but some of his content has had some really good rants/points lately, especially for those interested in Classic.
---
More attic junk, this sub is turning into the History Channel
---
Mirah's song has higher base dmg and better stats than the 2 daggers you linked.
---
However daggers in general are absolutely viable on Fury Warriors. Though not common due to practical reasons (Being distributed to Rogues/Hunters to keep everyone happy).
---
Because it’s the way it was and should be..?
---
You start at making two. Every ding adds two more
---
Cooking is great to level and there are some amazing quests and recipes to get.   Its also good leveling Fishing with it, and you can fish all the mats you need while you wait for boats. Cooking/Fishing is great for raid food too. The buffs are awesome.
---
 I wonder if this dude is in a fight club or does his face always look like someone used it as a punching bag?
---
I don't think i'd want to play an offensive priest in pvp without Silence and mind flay.
---
Hell yea, easily.
---
Yikes...thats just flat out selfish.  "Other people shouldnt be able to play the game how they want to because its not how i want them to" is just...yikes.
---
He literally left as soon as we killed it to join Vodka. My best guess is he thought they would be better positioned for BC not 100% sure never spoke to him again after that.
---
Honestly while the quests are someaht cool lore wise, I'd skip them entirely as they're inefficient to do and meaningless overall.
---
In pvp orc stun resist could save you from a rogues stun lock.
---
&gt;and there is no general exception for video games.
---
But there is one for every movie, TV series, comic book and Novel that includes some pictures.
---
Because, Art.
---
And Videogames are not art, amirite?
---
Double standards much?
---
I’m going Priest as my main, just easier to level, and hopefully raid. Once I’ve got some money behind me at 60 I’m gonna level Paladin and do PvP at 60. I’ve always played both since launch.
---
Procs were so impactful and exhilarating in the early expansions. I think that’s due to classes having a moderate amount of abilities and you couldn’t have a rotation that had 0% gbc downtime.
---
That's because they are church propaganda shills, not an organization that is helping people.
---
I'm not interested in leveling fishing while leveling for that reason, but I do want to level cooking. My goal is to organically convert white mats that I am already getting while leveling to make food and level cooking. Actually eating the food to save money and food buffs are bonuses.
---
I would get anxious and stir crazy just standing idle waiting for fish to bite at server launch. :)
---
I'm sorry what does hz stand for?
---
In general 40 man, pre prep, difficulty. 
---
Classic has two difficulties of raids, mc/ony/bwl/zg. Sure, bwl requires a higher ilvl, but mechanically it isn’t much harder than mc/ony. This is where LFR/Norm/Heroic sits. These raids in classic require no effort out side of the raid, are mechanically easy. 
---
Next is AQ/Naxx these are noticeable jumps in difficulty inside the raid, a number of bosses take real understanding of the game to devise a tactic. They also require 2+ hours per raid of pre raid prep time. This is a different but comparable difficulty to those who are like 1/2 -1/3 through a mythic progression when Method clears. 
---
The most difficult is final boss progression in a progression oriented mythic raid guild. For example, if you are currently working on Mythic UU’nat that’s much harder than classic raiding. Classic raiding at the highest level will still be mechanically pretty easy, it’ll be a big time investment, but no more than the 30+ hours top guilds are putting into Uu’nat Progression right now.
---
I want an option for people to use whichever they want.  Hell, i dont know which one i would opt to use until im in game and see it.
---
&gt;If by "help organisation" you mean a propaganda arm of the church, you are right.
---
What church? Can you give me any examples of the red cross pushing religion on people? It takes a clear neutral stance in everything including religion. 
---
Either they let everyone use it or no one gets to use it, they should not be spending resources on shifting through popular culture, do you really think everyone get to use a red cross to whatever means they want or that the Red Cross should sit and skim through videogames to check if its used appropriately?
---
The red cross symbol is synonymous with first aid because of the red cross fyi, its not like they did stole it they literally made it into what it means.
---
Yeah, that and alliance have fear ward as well which I seemed to forget about. 
---
Also, as for spec, I doubt I’d ever take the time to seriously run around and PvP as soul link. I think I’d find myself mostly rolling around as SM/Ruin, which I think might work better as alliance due to less dispels. 
---
It’s really going to be a hard choice in the end..
---
The three stipes is a trademark, denoting a brand of shoes and clothing.
---
The red cross is a symbol denoting medical aid.
---
Do you understand the difference, or do you want me to get the crayon box?
---
He's incorrect. I finish level 10 with 18 silver. Plenty.

Tauren can free cast a CL after Warstomp, which is pretty huge in PvP. Orcs have stun resistance which is really strong. But if you like Troll, just go Troll.
---
Ele/Resto hybrid shamans are really strong in PvP regardless of race. I'am always happy if we have a couple of them in our BGs, because they provide great utility and are flexible healers and offensive casters and ofc they have Purge, which is very strong, even important. Enh to a lesser degree because their burst damage completely relies on RNG.
---
Keep in mind, classic will be running in the legion client. Anyway, yeah I think so. It might struggle in big PvP events and in capital cities but other than that it should be fine. Looks like a pretty low end graphics card tho. But wow isnt that graphic intensive anyway
---
Do you work for Burger King?

---
Well, no. There is no general exception for films, TV series or comic books either.
---
Trolls have beserking more useful for a tank for threat. Orc ap spell essientially gives yourself the MS rebuff so probably better for a dps minded person in pve. Most tank weapons aren’t axes so the axe specialization isn’t as beneficial as say a human sword specialization. Horde gets windfury great as a warrior because it increases rage generation.
---
you can heal as shadow up to the level 56+ instances pretty easy. So dont worry about that
---
Wow.
---
I would think so too.  I have been thinking about this with the hinterlands quests as well because I like to farm the turtles, but I'm thinking it will be populated more so than when there aren't all quests there.
---
I'm stuck between rogue, warrior, shaman, warlock and Hunter, and maybe druid.
---
I loved my lock and Hunter in vanilla but I miss getting new weapons and having a boost in damage. 
---
Played shammy healer in tbc and my lock in tbc and wrath. Then warrior from cata to BFA. 
---
Helpppppppp
---
For me, I would rather Blizzard spend its time and money on ensuring the authentic vanilla experience and everything that entails. I’m not in it for anything new, I mean this is a 15 y/o game. We’re coming back to relive something, or coming to experience something that we missed out on. Nothing new is necessary in my opinion.
---
We had a signup system. At invite time they just invited people from 1-40 on the list, if someone wasn't online they just skipped him and invited the 40+ signed players until it was full (devided by Melee DPS, Ranged DPS, healer and tanks).
---
Only time they waited for someone if it was known by the officers they'd be late and it was an important player for a progression raid, in that case 15 min was the latest you could be.
---
Can't quite decide on Priest or Druid... I've leveled a priest to 60 on a pserver... Priest is alright and I know I will enjoy it.. but druid has always been my favorite class since I started playing them in TBC... always been resto druid... How is resto druid in classic? Is it like TBC or wrath? I know there is no tree form yet, think that's TBC... So I'm on the fence... Also not sure about leveling, can I level as balance? Or is that a no-go?
---
Classic raiding has more of a focus on preparation and beating bosses by bringing the right set of abilities/skills from various classes.
---
For example one of the early bosses in Molten Core has an enrage that can only be dispelled by a Hunters Tranquilizing shot or I believe a rogue poison with the same effect, but the rogue poison was a chance on hit.
---
In retail those kind of group focused mechanics have largely been done away with in favor of mechanics that focus on personal responsibility. Classes are so homogenized in retail WoW that you’re generally going to select players that can do the most dps, that are playing the most flavor of the month classes and are the most geared. 
---
Classic also only had one difficulty level which encouraged guilds to bring up players to their current content level to refill their ranks as folks got tired of raiding or moved on to other guilds. With the move to multiple tiers of difficulty and catch up mechanics you have to be pretty close to the end of your journey in WoW playing solo and pugging before you get in any serious group focused content.
---
First day will be crazy good, I plan on getting tailoring and chanting simply to make the first wand then dropping them
---
Game is so old and poorly optimized it doesn't even run well on super high end computers.
---
With standard debuffs (sunder, cor, faerie fire) available to all raids even non caster bosses (3731 armor) have only 136 armor remaining. You cannot reduce armor beyond 0 so that 2100 armor reduction from BRE is largely going to waste in this scenario.
---
Yeah both of those daggers suck ass. Felstriker however, now we're talking
---
Waste of time. Use the banks mailbox as a bank until later
---
I leveled holy priest in vanilla and it was fairly slow, especially between 55 and 60. When I rerolled Alliance and leveled priest again, I did it via shadow and it was a lot faster (and respecced when I hit 60). 
---
You can always just level via instances as healer; The lowest level dungeons are fairly easy to heal and you will get better as you go up in level. The most important thing to remember is to always be priming a heal and use lower ranked heals at higher levels. Good luck!
---
But in a duo or. And warrior really shine and you help your healer increase their kill speed so hardest to solo level without a doubt great duo leveling classes though.
---
the quest lines and lore to get the different morphs was awesome
---
classic&gt; a lot more trash to clear and effort in getting consumables and buffs
---
I hear ya, but they probably will leave them as they are. That is certainly how it looks.
---
The robe is incredible but you don’t need tailoring to wear it. Go your own way with professions and farm the mats for the robe
---
Holy vs shadow specced literally makes 0 difference in healing pre 60. Stick to shadow
---
Go Disc/Holy and keep a set of Damage and Healing gear, or go Holy/Disc and keep a set of Damage and Healing gear with the latter option not being as effective in PvP.  I think a RL would be happy to have a Disc priest pop PI on a mage for some insane damage, and you're missing out 10% Spiritual Healing talent points in the Holy Tree for some added utility. Seems fine to me.   Disc priest rips shadow priests a new one too 1v1.
---
720p 30fps just like the old days
---
So if you want to try then I highly recommend you KEEP your day job in the meantime. Maybe take some time off or whatever, and stream a pretty consistent schedule outside of work and you never know. It will be slow and painful but maybe you will get traction, best of luck.
---
Azshara. I wasn’t aware of all the quests that start in IF. That has changed.
---
Do you have a talent tree guide I can follow for when I play?
---
They’re a massive company, they can do multiple things at once you know. A phone app is hardly any cause for outrage
---
People who know what they're doing will tab target you anyway.
---
If you can spare the $15 a month I recommend that you do it and just dive in whenever you can. Doesn't matter if you hit the cap or not, just do whatever you enjoy when you do have the time.
---
Jokes on you, mine is stalled.
---
Very true. Good luck explaining this to your guild though. I know because I tried.
---
&lt;Not the Face&gt; - NA Progression / PVP Grind 
---
Server Type: PVP
---
18+ We drink, we swear, we loot. We are kinda like pirates.
---
Faction: Horde
---
We are PST leadership, raids will be at 6PM but we are flexible. The goal is to have 3 raid nights, no more. We will clear all content and keep it on farm. We have a lot of raiding experience from Vanilla to release. We don't want to spend a ton of time in raids as we will be running a 24/7 HWL Grind Team.
---
Our priority will to be the best on our server. We are NOT looking for world firsts. We are NOT looking to be the best raiders. Our goal is to be PVPers. This requires PVE in Classic. We have a few previous HWL in the guild as well as many Vanilla Naxx raiders. We need more members.
---
We are working on leveling spreadsheets, BIS "routes" and properly forming premade groups to best maximize leveling in gearing. We are try-hard has beens. That said, we have fun joke around, meme, couple streamers, gank and overall have a good time.
---
Loot will be on a hybrid Loot Council / DKP. Meaning items such as Thunderfury, Anathema etc will be decided in advance and distributed appropriately.  This includes any weapon that would be benefitting the raid. Tank gear etc. This does not include hand of rag or any armor etc. 90% of loot will be DKP. Let's be real. MC has very little gear that is upgrades to pre-raid BIS.
---
* You can contact me directly @ Spun#1337 on discord if you are interested. We have a lot of spots to fill.
---
Honestly as a warrior if your not willing to tank while leveling your going to have a tougher time finding groups simply because the tanking warrior isn’t going to want loot competition. With that in mind though most groups will be waiting on that elusive warrior tank to finally start their run so finding groups will be fairly easy as long as your willing to tank. All leveling dungeons are possible to tank as a dps spec. Look up skarm tank on YouTube to see the limits of non prot tanking.
---
Outside of CoH  yeh classic is it, last 5 plus year of mmo's suck bad. Asian mmo's I can't stand and the others are just stale
---
Would you say your life is better or worse now?
---
Okay
---
I really want to play a rogue, but do they have any farming options at 60 like hunters/mages do?
---
So DS/Ruin without ruin? What would be an advantage of that build?
---
When they say that they will take the best developers from other projects to make mobile games then yes I do get a bit miffed.
---
Alliance certainly don't have an advantage in BGs. The top players are similarly good but Horde usually attracts more above average PvPers than Alliance in my experience. Horde has better PvP racials but Alliance have some Map advantages. Shamans and Paladins are very different from eachother but in my experience equal if both sides play well.
---
In PUG vs. PUG situations Horde has the upper hand in my experience even if only slightly, but not because of balance, rather because again, Horde generally attracts PvP active players. In premade vs. premade it is very equal. It is even so balanced, that premades often queue dodged eachother.
---
They are, *to my memory..* but with Onyxia you get right in there after a few minutes of trash clearing, so you can get a lot more attempts for your time spent there. vs progressing in MC you've got to clear much more trash and bosses, and then if you take too long respawns again, definitely would make them feel harder due to less exposure.
---
I hate those guys
---
If you'r not Human/Orc for weapon skill, then it does not really matter. In this case your OH pretty much is a statstick. Would pick Scarlett kris since stats with BoK and higher dps. Although farm felstriker from UBRS if you want BiS.
---
I think there will be people who stream on every server, and I think that there's a reasonable chance it will create interesting faction rivalries more intense than in retail vanilla. You get a streamer swarm gaining a rep on one faction, there will be a swarm that develops on the other side.  Unless you keep getting ganked by a swarm of nerds following a streamer around, then it should be a net positive.
---
Have you tried to run WoW on minimal specs recently?  I did for giggles in legion and bfa with my older laptop....it's not playable.  "Minimum specs" means "game will launch without crashing".   Not "you have more than single digit FPS and can actually accomplish anything"
---
I still think the idea of war crime is an interesting thing that you can't enforce.
---
Hate to be that guy, but this sounds like one of those scammy comments where you're looking for people to give you money or parts. I have seen this so many times on Reddit, honestly.
---
These comments tend to sound humble and sad, not mentioning that they want or need help. Which a lot of people tend to fall for, so they offer help. The sad part is that people take advantage of these people online.
---
Basically, even though they have a working computer, they just want better hardware, so that's why they comment like this. In ope of people to fall for it.
---
I know this sounds super cynical, but it's just facts. Dishonest people ruining it for actual people that might need help, and it absolutely sucks that these people even exist, it's disgusting.
---
I'm not saying that you ARE doing this, I'm just saying it SOUNDS like this is one of those comments.
---
What made it so good for hunters? Is anything comparable?
---
Well here's the thing about fishing...or any profession for that matter.  It only takes 5 skill points per level to max out by 60.  If you take a few minutes each level to get 5 fishing skill, that's all you have to do to level fishing while you level.
---
Taking a quick look at the cooking recipes on Classic.db
---
\-Crispy Lizzard Tail gets you to 180.
---
\-Curiously Tasty Omlet is sold in Grom Gol and made with Raptor eggs in STV...gets you to 205
---
\-Soothing turtle Bisque.  SAVE ALL TURTLE MEAT...you'll get tons after Shimmering flats...just mail it to an alt or bank it.  You will need 10 Turtle Meat for a quest in Tarren Mill where you will get the recipe as a reward...it gets you to 255
---
\-You'll have to do the cooking quest to get past 225 cooking.  Quest giver is in the inn at Gadgetzan, requires you to be level 35
---
\- Tender Wolf steak gets you to 275...I distinctly remember getting tons of wolf meat for this one in Feralas on the wolves there
---
\- After 275 you're looking at end game type recipes Grilled squid (Raiding food for melee dps +Agility), Nightfin soup (MP5 food for raiding casters), Both of which require fishing and the squid is seasonal to boot.  
---
The other one that comes to mind for end game is Desert Dumplings...sold by the innkeeper in Silithus, made by the meat from the sand worms in Silitus (Raiding food for melee dps +strength)...Note:  not sure if this will be available right away or may not be available until later content phases.
---
Those 3 raiding recipes will get you to max cooking and they will make you tons of money.
---
YOU LANDLUBBERS ARE TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT! I’LL HAVE TO IMPROVISE!
---
Sure, that is possible I guess. Do you have any evidence that builds have been available for testing outside of the classic team? Besides the demo. I'm not sure I've read anything stating they had opened testing outside their dev team. I guess it would make sense that they've been releasing to internal employees who want to help test for 6+ months. Just have not heard that was being done.
---
Yes, barely. If you want to take a profession for a single crit go right ahead lol The mana on use is negligible and you should be using mana stones anyways. Who runs our of mana during trash? Yikes.
---
That’s just the way games are now. There will always be some type of micro transaction on games now. If people keep buying them companies are going to keep selling.
---
I am proud of myself, for using DKP on that beast of a weapon. As a hunter : - )
---
Ya this is also true. I just meant that for ranged physical attacks, i.e. bows / guns, it's only worth for hunters
---
It'd would have a bigger affect on the raid's damage in the hands of a Warrior though. If people expect their hunter to have a shot at this the first time it drops they should be fine letting the warriors/rogues go for the better ranged items as well at the same time as the hunter.
---
I feel personally attacked with this meme.
---
Tirion: Let me ask you a question, before he cornered you in the exploding outhouse, when the Stormwind Guard was sucking him off...    
---
Varian: Woa wait. One sec, it was the other way around.    
---
Bolvar: What?!    
---
Varian: Arthas, was blowing, the Stormwind Guard.    
---
Bolvar: Son of a Bitch!
---
You're not reading dude. Pserver drops are wrong, you can't predict classic economy without knowing what drops. You're looking for discussion about something you can't predict, go flip a coin it'll as accurate
---
I did and I am currently playing on one, whats your point? Are they fully progressed for over a year? Are you aware that classic wont have 12k per realm? As cap back then was 2.5k. Imagine going AQ/Naxx every week for a year.
---
you can heal every leveling instance till you get to about level 50-55, and look to go to BRD, LBRS/Scholo/strath/UBRS, then you'll prob need to be full healer specced.
---
Just have some healing gear in your bag, and you'll be fine. 
---
I'm leveling an ele shammy, and will be healing all the way up.
---
just have healer gear to put on and your shadow spec will be fine.
---
You know what else is BiS for hunters?
---
My foot up their ass!
---
I am most excited for the lack of quest indicators.  Quest indicators make you turn your brain off and mindlessly follow arrows and kill stuff.  Without them you have to to read the quest log to not only find the objective, but the area the objective is in.. and sometimes you read it wrong.. and it takes an hour to finally find it.. and while most modern gamers would think "wow i just wasted an hour on this dumb thing", my brain goes to "YESS, GOTCHYA!"
---
But your experience isn't indicative of the truth. That's all I'm saying. Just because you had to grind movs doesn't mean it's impossible not to.
---
And let's be honest, this subreddit is 99% shitpost memes, people asking what class to roll, and pserver vets that refuse to admit that pserver experience and data isn't 100% accurate.
---
Nah, it's straight up dumb as hell, just like how China demands censorship of random skeletons.
---
I'm sure the Chinese government has a reason, like skeletons produce anxiety over mortality which results in people gravitating towards religion which controls their minds which positions them against the government.
---
Every evil action has a rationale behind it. 
---
Reckless censorship is a fucking disgrace.
---
Oh man, if I could I would, but the guide would be hours long if it did
---
What does healer gear consist of as opposed to assumed high spirit and spell power gear for shadow
---
I know thats the argument blizzard used like 14 years ago but the counter point is pure dps classes have 3 dps specs they can choose from.
---
The hybrid tax never made actual logical sense in the greater design of the game, and like many things about old wow it was thankfully pretty much eliminated by wotlk.
---
Nostalgia.
---
Spell power and healing power are separate stats in vanilla
---
:(
---
Mods suck.
---
Ya, I won't quit my small income just yet.  
---
Yours and the other people comments gave me some motivation in actually trying it. Thanks for that.
---
Are you expected to totem twist as a healer?
---
I was this except 32. Then I started dating this girl last week and we both seem to be into each other.....
---
Of course this shit happens before classic. GODS DAMN IT.
---
Take everything but ashje therul and nerubian!
---
What do power outlets have to do with the human eye/brain's processing power?
---
I don’t have an attic - just a book shelf.
---
If a game aged well like WoW Classic, there is no need for a complete remastered. I like the option to crank up the graphics to ultra high, it's a fantastic and it's really all you need.
---
When you look at WC3, this game desperately needs whole remake. The models didn't age well imo.
---
You need to make those decision per game. Baldurs Gate EE, I thought the new version looks great only ruined by unnecessary new characters. BG2 on the other hand, stands the test of time easily.
---
I think it depends on the Art-Style of the game and of course Sounds can trigger memories, so if the game can age well, you shouldn't change to much.
---
It's the appeal of many retro fans like myself, to revisit those old times. But keep in mind, that this isn't always possible. I mean Gothic 1 and 2 are one of my all time favorite games, but those also would need a complete remastered. It's to clunky, doesn't look good.
---
The only other PC game i am looking forward to is playing through the master chief collection campaign with my buddies
---
Nope, dw fury on the warrior would have a bigger effect on the raid damage.
---
I think mass-market gaming as a deep experience has waned as the market has shifted away from "Figure it out, pussy. Here's a 120 page instruction manual." That old mentality provided a rewarding experience because, though it's not much fun for a few hours, there is real depth to the experience. Other than a few Bioware games from almost a decade ago and the Witcher series I've seldom felt much satisfaction from AAA-production level games since WoW was released. 
---
Or maybe WoW just burnt out all of my dopamine receptors.
---
Nobody can farm quite like those classes. Rogues can pickpocket elites in BRD for a decent chunk though.
---
You’re right, and I imagine you’re a very efficient player.  You sound like an absolute pleasure to play with. Just do us a favor and keep your piss poor attitude away from other peoples hype.
---
to be honest, for lower level instances +Spell power, with Int &amp; Spirit are all you need, so normal spell power gear will help. Once you get to higher level, you'd start to get +healing spell loot.
---
wotlk alt classes
---
This has nothing to do with the topic.
---
You should be fine.
---
The GFX card is pretty ancient, but should be able to handle WoW admirably...it is a 14 years old game after all :P
---
These mods won't even delete this comment.
---
I like this. This is now canon. Nothing is dead in these mines.
---
Sins of a Solar Empire

Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne
---
I'm inclined to believe you assuming you are carrying a lot of weight in your legs. Still, 320 is big, should cut it down a little and take some pressure off the heart.
---
&gt;classic will be running in the legion client. 
---
Wouldn't worry about that. It's running the legion engine, but the models from classic, with a much lower poly-count and lower resolution textures. He should be fine.
---
lol its not bis
---
Mods are commies.
---
Lol. Give them a break. They just be following the rules set for this subreddit as best they can! Is not like they are intentionally being douchebags.
---
Dark souls.. Though I would still be playing that also
---
oh shit, really? Is there that much 1.12 version of gear from BRD that is pre-raid BiS? I figured it was a handful of stuff,even for all classes, since it is only like lvl 52ish.
---
Maybe it would be a long video, I still recommend you make it if you can. I can't think of anything more useful for the upcoming Classic WoW
---
Is it bis tho? wouldn't double 1h enchant (+10 ap) + something like 2x corehound tooth be better?  
---
50 ap + 2% crit vs 86 ap?   
---
zg fang of the faceless dagger + warblade is:  
---
66 ap + 2% crit vs 86 ap  
---
i feel like 2% crit is worth more than 36 flat ap (that doesn't scale with buffs)
---
My girlfriend wants to play with me. She started playing WoW after TBC so she never got the real vanilla experience. We'll level together as we have time to play, and I'll probably have a side character for my solo time as I game more than she does.
---
Best bet is to grab engineering, which will be required to compete in high-end pvp, and craft up a shadow reflector. That will reflect a fear for you but I’m not sure of a magic cleanse. Possibly a consumer but I can’t think of an item
---
Easier to just place the laptop near an open window, though :p
---
After reading through the comments so far, did anyone seriously expect anything other than that to happen? :D
---
I mean that only accounts for 5% crit. Tribute and ZG and songflower buffs all still exist.
---
I think it'll be the last good griefable game to ever be re-released. Most devs work too hard to make sure trolls like me can't take advantage of others.
---
I've been yearning to stealth around low level quest zones just ganking endlessly. Now that streaming is a thing, it's all going to go on record and be immortalized.
---
Reporter, "What do you intend to do to fix these numbers Blizzard" 
---
Blizzard, "Well you see, we plan to release WoW Classic sometime in the next 4 months and our subscription count should see steady growth for at least the next 12 months."
---
I’ve been eagerly anticipating this release. Will watch tomorrow.
---
My laptop is worse than that one and mine can run 5-boxing on retail WoW with no issues whatsoever. So yeah, you’re good to go :)
---
unmentionable servers and those little wow challenges. Playing some FPS too. The void hurts. It mains me every moment I logon wow and it not on classic.
---
Came to give props on the Sumo. Nice timepiece.
---
&gt;why aren't **'speed runs'** a bigger thing in the WoW raiding scene?
---
Because they are boring af idiocy that's sucking all the fun out of the game, reducing a rich, immersive fantasy RPG into a stupid numbers game. The people who think that's exciting, are the ones who also think they are intelligent because they learned how to read barcodes or speak Clingon.
---
tbc
---
It'll never be like this again though. Kinda feels like people here are getting excited over feeling that way again
---
Yeah but it still took 3 people to summon the other two. Its not a situation where everyone gets to rely on everyone else to summon them. Youre still trekking there 60% of the time.
---
I still think they are just gonna test it in house and drop it on us randomly...Nothing to back that up other then a feeling, and a dream.....
---
I dunno how recently you've played or how well you remember BRD, but you can't do full run+jailbreak all in one run unless you're prepared for people to leave the instance a few times and trek to a few different places and back to the instance.
---
This thread gives me faith in humanity.
---
First and foremost, I want to play in a cohesive world. I want to see what you see, I want to look at your character the way YOU intended it to be seen. This is an MMORPG, your decisions matter. Even minor, aesthetic decisions. I want to laugh at your rapeface Dwarf *or* admire the badass beard animations of the HQ model
---
- but pick one. A toggle option would only cause a divide in the community (HD sunshafts and shadows are okay though, as long as they don't give you an advantage).
---
Now with that out of the way, I actually wouldn't mind new graphics for everyone. I'm not a purist in that regard. But I'm a purist when it comes to the spirit of vanilla, or any good RPG: Your actions affect the world around you, even the look of your character. Everyone will write a different story, but we should be all writing on the same page, on the same paper, with the same pen.
---
That said, the people who pushed for Classic realms for years are the reason why I get to play it again in the first plays, so I will accept whatever these people demand. And if that's a purist attitude on models, then so be it.
---
Does (**Magic Resistance Potion** increases your resistance to all schools of magic by 50 for 3 min.) work too?
---
Altitude is the difference between a gnome and a splat.
---
Exception, not the rule, but a feral druid who is min/maxing hardcore (crowd-pummel farmer, power shifting, all pots, etc.) can easily be in the upper pack in damage while providing more utility than most dps with LotP, Battle Rez, etc.
---
That said, probably 1 in 500 feral druids will actually be able to play the class correctly since it requires a complex rotation, energy add-ons, and extreme dedication to farming gnomes for hours.
---
\&gt;  I don't mind tanking but I think I'd get bored of healing, and with PvP  in mind playing a healer would probably lead to lots of respeccing.
---
Good PvP healers carry BG matches more often than not. I don't think it is boring either, because there is tons of stuff going on in a match.
---
\&gt;   Rogue, Warrior, Mage, Warlock (...) Paladin
---
From the vibe I'am getting from you I would roll a Mage. You won't regret it and neither will your friends. It is the most flexible DPS (like Priests for healing), scales very well with gear, great for PvP and PvE, decent alone but also very welcome in groups.
---
Rogue is a great class too. Not as flexible as Mages but they have their very unique perks. In PvP you need patience with them though. Some people say they suck in BGs which is far from true, but they have a super unique playstile that makes them great at defending flags, backcaping and spawn hunting, but shitty at fighting straight up and mid-control.
---
Warlocks are really strong but inconsistent. They have higher highs than Mages but also lower lows. Often super hard to deal with but they have more apparent weaknesses if that makes any sense.
---
Don't roll a Paladin. You don't appreciate supporting enough and you won't stick with it or regret rolling one.
---
Don't roll a Warrior. They require more effort on your part especially in PvE, which you want to do casually. Gearing a Warrior and filling your bags with DPS consumes is not super casual friendly. In PvP situations they are great, but \*only\* with groups. Else they literally suck and have like 0 good matchups.

Wotlk private server for some goofy OP heirloom shenanigans while I test out a new keybind setup. Trying to decide if I wanna commit to a replay of one of the final fantasy games or not.
---
Get a load of this guy.
---
It’s gonna increase your chance to resist all magic minorly for 3 minutes or until dispelled but that’s definitely not gonna guarantee a fear resist. Plus that will be your only consume during that combat, you’d need a better consume to use for a PvP fight whether it’s a fap, lap, lim-invuln or health pot. 
---
Shadow reflector is 5 seconds of reflecting fears as a trinket crafted through engineering and requires engineering to use

Camelot Unchained.

Google that. Look into it. When it releases, it has the potential to be something incredible. The guy putting it on has been making games since the beginning and has been involved in some real solid games. He decided to go on his own this time around and control the setup and make sure there is none of that "Lootbox Fuckery" stuff. VERY well thought out and he has been very very very open to ideas from the community involved with it. We had some discussions early on and really helped him with the game design. He sat in discussions WITH the Backers and adjusted the game design based on those discussions to make it right. It has a TON of potential.
---
WaRrlaRllalrlAlrlrl
---
You dont think they want to market it in advance?
---
Nice try Mod
---
Could be like apex and just drop it out of nowhere !
---
Hah, I saw that yesterday - great stuff.
---
Anyways, if you wanna know, I can list a few items, that was considered BiS in TBC even for PvP.
---
Since PvP is situational it would really come down to matchups, when we are talking Tier gear. For instance, if you were playing the second dps in a 3v3 team, and you usually were not the target to be brought down first, you could mix up your gear by getting a PvE 2/5 set bonus to pump up your dps.  
---
The 5-man HC Sunwell trinket that consumed holy power was really good for healers in 2v2 especially.  
---
The green daggers from BT, the head-piece from Illidan, and of course War Glaives tipped the scales A LOT.
---
What irritates me is just that PvE gear is affecting PvP. I would prefer if each side could have their own gear. Because history shows that it has always been PvE gear that could be BiS in PvP, never PvP being BiS in PvE. Aiming for gladiator plus raiding hardcore BT is just too much to ask for, especially if you don't even like PvE.
---
Like imagine if a guy with gladiator title could join Method and have a + 10% damage output, just because he had a better weapons from PvP - that's how it feels when PvE gear is superior in PvP. But w/e this is a vanilla thread, so PvE gear is mostly gonna be superior anyways :D
---
I too have also been thinking about rolling a rogue when classic releases, and I think with the rogue class it's a staple in the mindset of having to gank a lower level as you pass by them. Griefing is just part of the toolset in a rogue.
---
Every quest on pservers seems to give max rep- was a lot less rep in reality.
---
In BFA First Aid has been removed and added to the Tailoring profession.
---
This fucking bear asses quest looks great !
---
I'm curious to what mechanics you think are retarded. You mean fights like a'lar in TK? I hold TBC closest to my heart purely because of the raiding encounters. I think they were all awesome
---
No changes?
---
thanks mate, I was resisting going engineering but I might consider it
---
I botted on an extra account for a loooong time and they never banned me for it. 
---
Worth mentioning I botted for the hell of it, and not to obtain anything in particular. It didn't share a server with my main account or anything.
---
Thanks for the reminder that I'm 30 and virgin. I will sort it out eventually but not now when Classic is around the corner. At least my sister has started probing her acquaintances because she feels sorry for me, so I got that going for me.
---
If you are planning on doing any PvP anywhere above the casual level, you’ll pretty much require it. It gives so many beneficial items. 
---
Ranking with a premade would require it
---
It's our version of a ban against drawing the Prophet Muhammad. It's primitive and disgusting.

I’ve had a few posts removed since this sub was created. I used to think it was me. Then I started reading a bunch of comments in different posts from people saying the same thing. Now I believe it’s the mods who need to re-evaluate, not me.
---
Then you clear two raids in four hours.  Or spend the last two hours taking out a couple faction leaders.  I’ve done four hour MC raids, they are not fun at all.
---
Download the free to play retail client and test it.
---
Why does it agitate you so much that people likes this? That's kind of sad
---
Yep, same here. Everything is just so bland now that the only thing I even bother playing anymore is Rocket League which is the closest game to a sport there is, but even they got bought out by Epic yesterday so that's just a dying cause now.
---
All my RL friends are going to play Alliance. I can't wait to hear them patting themselves on the back about winning AV like skill has anything to do with it.

Grim Dawn

personally i think it will come out within a day or two of the release date announcement.
---
PUBG, Overwatch as of recent, apex
---
I just started playing this great first-person 32v32 medieval melee game called Mordhau.  It's been incredibly entertaining and has a great skill-ceiling if PVP is your thing!
---
I have a feeling it'll be a weekend stress test beta that'll be announced somewhat sudden. I imagine they want to verify their early zone sharding works as intended when there's thousands of people on. Something they can't accurately do with employees, or bots.
---
Probably because they are still playing on a 2001 potato laptop and can't handle upgraded graphics.
---
Is this the Babadook?
---
Vanilla on pserver K3 because it's lower pop than that other pserver.
---
Doing a practice run and testing out low level professions, and strategies for stuff.  Testing different routs for stuff...etc...
---
This^
---
If they were going to market it, I feel like they would have started by now. I also think a big marketing campaign could possibly signal to the everyday consumer that they have lost faith in the retail version of the game, which seems like something they'd like to avoid.
---
All I see is gold coins?

Could mean everything, could mean nothing. This community is becoming unhinged lol

I built my computer for like $1300 years ago (when gtx 780 was new) and immediately jumped into playing OSRS.

has that turned out to be ok - i backed it a year or two ago and havent put time in playing.  after upgrading the PC ill be able to prob enjoy it if its worth it
---
&gt;  I always like to have an alt so I can do something different **when I feel like it**

Nice way to say you are camped in STV :D

We're just so desperate.

Realistic answer, a lot of people say a lot of stupid shit.
---
You're forgetting that this stuff isn't new anymore, there's tons of guides
---
Omfg nail on the head. That shit feels like one of those Quick Time Events to me. So mind numbingly dull
---
Apex launched out of nowhere to avoid any de-hype during pre-announcement because of the negative EA stigma, they said it themselves during an interview.
---
Im sure Blizzard would want any publicity they can get around classic wow to get the hype-ball start rolling.
---
&gt;And I’m not proud of myself
---
I self-flagellated my way through entire zone wide camp fests for about 3 days before I gave up. The only pserver of any size in cancerous to play on and the entire community there seems to support it.
---
That is what I miss. If I want to roleplay as an asshole why can't I? Its a rooeplaying game and not everyone wants to play as the goodboi who helps others.
---
Other older mmo's had way higher penalties for dying and it was basicly free for all.
---
I miss Tibia in its glory days. That game was hardcore. ( 20 year old mmo and still running )
---
Arguably I don't have anything low end enough lying around, but I'll take your word for it.  I'd expect the client to have way less overhead than BFA, but I don't know if the shaders and textures are going to match the 2006 client or retail.
---
water cooling is such a meme
---
Part of me wants to play druid in classic since its been my main for so long on retail but my favorite spec is feral and it seems like a lot of work to pull of decent dps as a feral specially having to farm the pummelers. Also will probably be annoying trying to get into groups since everyone has always had this stigma about ferals.
---
I can't get to the link at work, but if its the same picture that was posted yesterday... 
---
It's just saying this article was updated, typos, or they're adding things to it behind the scenes, or their adjusting the webpage it sits on. It doesn't really mean too much. 
---
This article has been there prior to the alpha being dropped. I remember browsing around battle.net and looking into support articles and seeing it about a month ago.
---
It's honestly the most fun I've ever had in a video game. I used to have a massive saved image collection of all the salt I caused, but lost it when I replaced my computer and didn't back it up. Not nearly as impressive as ["Angwe's" shrine](http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/), though. That guy is a ganker legend.
---
There is a guy in stormwind like the hamburger today guy who says “I’ve seen the pandarans. I knew they were real”

Activision merged with blizzard once they heard about classic. They are fanboys aswell.

There are more bad people to be carried than in retail.

There's been a few hardcore MMO games with a similar death system to Tibia but never with the player count to sustain it.
---
Let's talk about trinks, ba-by
---
Let's talk about blues and greens
---
Briefly skimming back through mod logs, I'm not sure where we've removed any of your posts, u/mrplow3. Can you link me the ones that you thought were unfairly removed?
---
They didn't say they were taking the best talent off of other projects. They said that they were letting developers who had burned out elsewhere move to smaller projects.
---
That's something Blizzard has done internally since before Hearthstone. It's what lead to both Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm.
---
I don't know if you've read about Titan at all, but it basically broke Blizzard. It's the real reason why Metzen left (it literally made his anxiety so bad he couldn't even be in the building), and it's also probably the reason why a lot of "old" Blizzard left. If Overwatch hadn't sprung from it, Kaplan would be gone too, as would many, many others.
---
After that, Blizzard decided they couldn't do the massive games the way they used to. They got cautious and turned inward.
---
They started to let employees work on side projects, and obviously a lot of employees started working on side projects that were mobile.
---
If you've been a Blizzard fan for a while, then you've gotta know that (as a company) they're very insular and kinda culty -- the whole "you guys don't have phones?" thing was bad, but understandable because working at Blizzard is like being in an echo chamber. They likely really DO have a lot of people that play mobile games on staff, and they probably did really think people would like it.
---
It sucks, but I get it.
---
I think running wow in 144 fps is a little bit of an overkill. I'm not sure what im sitting at, but I dont get any FPS lag at all using a 144hz monitor in any area, but I never closely pay attention to my FPS either. 
---
I'm using a i7 8800, 1080ti, and 32 gb of ram. But basically if you have a good computer that can run it well the main concern you need to have is your monitor. If you want to see 144 fps, you need to have a 144hz monitor and make sure you make the change in windows for that monitor to use its 144hz
---
Nope, y'all wanted us to let memes through, so you're gonna take it and you're gonna like it.
---
&gt;now I don’t know how much it’ll cost me to get a new one that’ll be able to run the game
---
You will be hard pressed to actually find a computer that *can't* run it. Minimum requirements includes 512 MB of RAM, 1.3 GHz SINGLE core processor and lastly, for graphics minimum is the GeForce 2 series with recommended a 7600 GT (mid-tier of the 7 series).
---
Okay, so to put this into more perspective, looking at bench marks of LAST generations top card, the 1080 Ti, it is 31475% faster. Yes, that is the right number. Even a 130 USD graphics card is around 7000% faster. If you compare with the absolutely top of the line gaming PC available during vanilla, that 130 USD is *still* several thousand percentage faster. You get the point.
---
Now, this is the specs needed for WoW in 2009, meaning in Wrath of the Lich King. That is because the specs remained like that from end of vanilla until Cataclysm. The original vanilla requirements were even lower, but I assume Classic will have slightly higher requirements due to how it is made this time around.
---
So long story short, even the cheapest PC you can find will run Classic.
---
There were cross realm BGs in vanilla, so even the #nochanges crew has merit in their claims
---
Reporter lol
---
Its bis pvp at the time, not pve. For both warriors and hunters.
---
A lot of people forget this. Lower tri count models, less particle effects, and overall less post processing effects.
---
I’m more so keen to find out if they will maintain the engine in parity with retail (easier for the engine devs to maintain a common engine from a cost perspective) wouldn’t hate to get the newer multi threading benefits that has been developed in the newest patch updates.
---
Giving those older multithreaded CPU’s a bit more punch.
---
We're talking about level 60 here, so everyone is a twink basically.
---
Life. Trying to grind out a girlfriend to exalted before classic
---
Alright lads I want to shit on some allys in PvP what class do I play? Mage? Lock? Rogue? War? Shaman even?
---
Or you can play on a PvE server
---
Any reason to have Engi if you PvE?
---
I raised through Naxx and spanked Marshall in PVP when I was younger so played it a lot, I just remember how hard it was just leveling an alt with friends. I cant imagine how it would be without any friends in the game anymore.

Yes it did... in the hands of a warrior it would be a dps loss over that warrior dual wielding. In contrast, it would be a net gain for the raid on the hunter. It would be great for a warrior to use in pvp as arms.
---
It was updated again 1 hour ago....
---
on a Budget ? go for AMD CPU and GPU, while Intel and Nivida is still the "better" Hardware in many high end cases your get more performance per $ with AMD. 
---
since Classic will have multithread support (8.0 Client) AMD will also have the benfit of more CPU cores in low budget cpus
---
Constant 144FPS will atleast require and Ryzen 2500 and a RX570. 
---
Builds around this will coast about 800-900$ (700-800€) with all components. i don't think  cheaper is possible if you want to stay on that fps. but maybe you can take parts of your old setup (case, HDD, SSD, PSU) 
---
Warning: it is not 100% predictable if this will run WoW Classic at 144FPS but we can asume the performance will be like BFA. (same engine version)
---
You should check out Stellaris. IMO, it's just an all around better version of Sins of a Solar Empire.
---
Handicapping as well. Doing dungeons or raids with white gear only idk
---
Bro I am straight up, not having a good time!
---
Yes we did. We played BGs with other servers in our battlegroup.
---
A 2h sword in a warriors bags will have no effect on overall raid damage 😏.  And if a hunter wanted any ranged weapon besides Rok or Ash, then they dont know how to play their class.
---
Risk of Rain 2.  Game is aces.

Mostly refreshing the subreddit while I slip deeper into insanity. Starting to think really unhealthy thoughts about what could be done to get a release date.

I just checked OSRS, they have red crosses on bandages, despite RS3 having green ones
---
Who made the red cross into a symbol denoting medical aid?
---
LET ME IN
---
I would think they would at least do a 3 month marketing campaign then. Would start sometime soon here this month, putting a release date in August. Unless they just do a hard push with one month of marketing....or none. Who knows.
---
In a raiding guild the warriors will be dual wielding. It's not about who writes the biggest numbers. In a 100% raiding guild, ashkandi is bis for hunters only.
---
You have negative karma. Our auto-filter disallows negative karma accounts to post, because the vast majority are spam or garbage accounts.

I think the mods are *way* to lenient here. Not removing this post after 54 minutes is just another case for that point.

Embarrassing when r/classicwow/ tries to analyze financial reports

Just make it so that when you queue as a group, when any of the guys that queued presses "join BG" all the other guys are immediatelly teleported to the BG as well.

No more scouting

They could probably remove more of the posts with the same question/idea/whatever posted for the 10th time in the last week.

Or maybe they do and its just after i see them.  Idk, i dont really 'keep track', i just know i seem to see a lot of the same shit over and over.
---
I feel the some way. 
---
Only thing is, if Blizzard put sharding into Classic, it’s no longer the Vanilla experience they are promising.
---
Its against their plan to leave everything as it was. Its also a shame that some slight number tweaks could make a shitton of builds viable and close the gap.
---
shh, it’s a conspiracy
---
A lot of posts get downvoted here, yet you start an actual discussion with several people. Idk how it works
---
That was before we reached peak shitposting. I believe this post proves we’ve reached critical mass.
---
You suck, nerd.
---
Lightwell and spirit of redemption were pretty garbage and not something I'd take at 60 even back then. Though I did have both while leveling because I didn't know any better.
---
If you are tired of the AAA-gaming circle, i'd recomend you to try out some indie games. It's there the best games are made now-a-days.

The epic quest bow is awesome, but that staff is fugly. Bring on the Untamed Blades and Ashkandis baby!

Largest attack power bonus, simple as that. Hunters will not be expected to ever swing with it, but still out of all the classes, and for raiding purposes only, nobody else makes use of 2h weapons in general.
---
Well obviously they can't catch everyone. If you didn't use the program for X amount of time before they decided to launch the tsunami you're always going to be safe.

I enjoyed when I played and knew I could easily kill one mob but would have to run if his buddies join. That seemed like an appropriate power level for an even leveled character. A balance of accomplishment with sense of danger.

Yep. That's why I'm playing. Games are shit now.
---
TBH, we try to be reasonable about what we remove and try to be consistent, but that's clearly not always the case. ModMail exists for a reason and we try to respond to everyone pretty quickly on there if they have suggestions/concerns for the sub. We also did a "state of the sub" sticky post a couple weeks ago and planned a few changes to the sub, including banning (temporarily, until ~Phase 3 of Classic releases) low-effort "Wut happens after Naxx!?" posts, but there was a good amount of pushback on that and we opted to not go forward with the moratorium on that discussion. The point being, we're not perfect, but we try to take into account community feedback when possible.
---
It's as if only the AAA fucker exists. You're missing out on about 99% of the gaming landscape easy if you only focus on AAA.
---
Truthfully if all you look at is AAA there's almost no need for a PC to game on. Indie is where it's at, IMO.  I've got too many good games without all that BS not to mention an entire back-catalog of shit I've never played starting somewhere in 1963 from a game by a couple of dudes from MIT.
---
I got no time for AAA, truthfully. Too much on my list I need to tackle to even bother with that loot box garbage - even if I got it for free like when Destiny 2 was free to download over thanksgiving. I gave no fucks. Was busy playing better games.
---
AA and Indie are where it's at now. AAA can just about be ignored. You won't miss it.
---
Mordhau, it fills my pvp needs for now
---
Since we're all just sitting on our thumbs waiting for any news at all and the shitposts are at an all-time high I guess people just assumed. Right now it's mostly posts that would probably get removed once things fiiiinally start up.
---
It seems so logical, right ? Classic feeling is grindyness, slow progression, wpvp, 40-mans and stuff like that. Not hybrid dps at the bottom of the barrel, nonfunctioning paladins and generally class stacking to the max.  
---
Noone proposed hybrid dps buffs by 100%, but don't make them feel bad.  
---
A change I'd like to see is switching stuff up in the talent trees, if an elemental shaman or retribution paladin would have different meaningful support abilities compared to healers, they'd be an option probably.  
---
In general, I'm always down for more diversity.

Nope.
---
Spell batching won't change how rolling ignite works, you either need to make it stack independently for each mage (meaning you can't take it at all, because it'll mess with debuff limits too much) or it needs a serious rework. Neither are great solutions, so we're kinda stuck with what we've got.

I don't know about the other mobile games they have in the works, but Diablo Immortal is being developed by NetEase in China and not Blizzard directly.  I wouldn't be surprised if the rest of the mobile games follow suit.

The bosses are hard enough. Not purely mechanicly but the combination of a few mechanics, collecting a 40 man roster and pre-gearing.
---
They did create it by inverting the colors on the swiss flag though. I don't know if their copyright would still be in effect today without the backing of other legal systems, but it is certainly their symbol.
---
It also isn't just a red plus sign. The image shows a red cross on a white background used to denote healing or medical care. That is the red cross's symbol

“How they want to”, if they don’t want to play vanilla, they can play BFA.
---
This only works for certain things a lot of bosses still have resists to this.
---
Hahaha
---
stop with your logic and put your tinfoil hat on please
---
I call this "lead guitar syndrome". Everyone wants to play Lead Guitar(DPS), nobody wants to play Drums or Bass(Support).
---
A Resto Shaman can provide Windfury, but if you're filling the 40th spot in the raid and you're bringing a Resto Shaman just for Windfury, an Enhancement Shaman will do more dps.
---
Likewise, if healing is covered but blessings or shadow weaving aren't, you're going to get more dps out of a Ret pally or Shadow Priest than you are bringing an extra healer just for buff/debuffs.
---
Now, if you're in a cutting edge raid progression guild that can build the perfect 40 man raid makeup with people waiting on the bench, you don't run into that situation, but for most guilds, it's not crazy to run into a situation where bringing one of these specs is helpful.

It works for all bosses after MC and BWL, which is the only time mages go fire. No bosses have too high spell resistances at that point when warlock curses are applied.

---
No it didn't.... Yes, fury warrior is more DPS, but upgrading an arms warrior to this instead of giving it to a hunter would be more DPS. Not everyone is going to go for the BiS all the time every time. You do you. But this was never in the discussion until you brought it up.
---
Back in vanilla i was hunter now in classic i want play shadow priest. the only question is how good can i farm with spriest.
---
While I agree, there are always people who want more challenge.  This could legit give content months of challenges to strive for.  It would only really be possible to do for those who have already geared and cleared the content.
---
Cheers for the detailed reply.
---
I am definetly settling on either Mage, Warlock or Rogue.
---
Rogue probably being the less prefered one, just based on the leveling experience. Mage and Warlock are equal for me at the moment.
---
Oh, sure. Most engineering stuff is BoE so you could get the trinkets from the AH or a guildie, but the explosives are consumable so you might want to roll engineering yourself to have an easier time of replacing them. They're useful as you level for spikes in AoE damage and for stuns if you pull extra mobs.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Yes, fury warrior is more DPS, but upgrading an arms warrior to this instead of giving it to a hunter would be more DPS. Not everyone is going to go for the BiS all the time every time. You do you. But this was never in the discussion until the other guy brought up fury.
---
Oh no not my precious 1-10 experience! Game is ruined!
---
Is this really happening? Maybe I’m just to new to this lmao!
---
For all those declining this,  what's the reason other than 'No changes'. This isn't a change,  its an addition that makes no change to anything tangible other than giving players another step to strive for.
---
It would make people minmax even more. That will end up with warrior tanks, priest healers and 25 of the same class dps because that "best dps this patch". Guilds will pouch eachothers mages for example to be able to kill the boss.
---
I would not mind more challanging bosses but I do think it would be bad for classic.
---
Technically I didn't either....my laptop has 8GB of ram, and it was still unplayable.  Like you could use it for AH/mailbox stuff, but that's about it.
---
Any idea what is BiS for hunters?
---
But why? There wouldn't be much of a benefit from running at 144fps. Hell, in a raid, pre dx12 implementation, it was nearly impossible to get 60fps.  
---
Just seems like a silly, needlessly expensive goal.
---
Alternatively, marketing pre-launch would only increase the initial launch problems and need for sharding etc.  Bad launches get bad press. Marketing after launch would provide a smooth experience for people wanting to try it out.
---
This is just a quirky mechanic imo, not a bug. If they start touching things like this classic will not be classic.
---
They’re launching with sharding. They have stated it’s for limited zones at launch. If you have a problem with that I guess you will need to figure out your personal response to this. Personally I’d rather have a smoother launch day without the entire server in 6 starter zones trying to tag mobs. So while by no means do I think sharding is a good thing and would prefer it to quickly be reduced and removed. I also can’t blame them for wanting to provide a smoother launch than the original game had. I also prefer my first day to be progressing through the leveling zones instead of fighting hundreds or thousands of other people to get those first boar tags at lvl 1
---
Lock is super good as horde because you're not dealing with undead racials and they're just good in pvp in general.
---
What is wrong with you people. You're trying to turn classic into BFA. SHOO PEST
---
Yeh If I'm being honest it's probably between mage and lock
---
Do you mean like the BS trinket or wa?
---
*Or* you could look beyond the sorry state of AAA gaming; For every Call of Duty, there's a DUSK, a Project Warlock. For every Blorplefield, there is an Ion Maiden. For every Anthem, there's a Senua's Sacrifice. For every Retail WoW, there's a Camelot Unchained. Point being: Yes, there's a problem for gamers that knew how good gaming was ten or twenty years ago. But there also is a solution, that basically mirrors the state of gaming twenty years ago: Look into the niches, and thou shalt find. Turn ye away from the big publishers, and beyond the desolate wastes of AAA you may find an answer. Or perhaps... salvation?

---
Nice watch
---
I'm ashamed that I like this
---
Actually *you* brought it up by saying it would better serve the raids damage in the hands of a warrior, which is a completely false statement unless the raid is letting their warriors sacrifice damage to be PvP specced. In that case it fuck it, give it to the ret paladins!
---
It's 100% better served for raid damage in the hands of a hunter.
---
I still as a rogue with aq 40 and some naxx gear has mages anywhere near me in dps so will it really matter
---
I could add a little text or something. I'd have to think about that one.
---
Classic first please. Lets get classic out and then start looking at way aheads. lol
---
Its a garbage idea. If you want mythic play retail.
---
But it's a Hunter weapon!
---
Would help if you added what the budget is, what res your screen is and if it is an 144hz monitor.
---
nah tbh
---
I will for sure. But I wont go out of my way for them either, for example rfc, if I cant get a group I will probably just level past it. The same with gnomeregan. There are some good/fun items to pick up there for end game, but that's something you can pick up at lvl 60.
---
The Red Cross is extremely aggressive in protecting their trademark. To the point that they have gotten the US Trademark Office to create a special refusal basis just for them apart from the standard trademark similarity refusal for anyone using a red “plus” symbol, even for unrelated services.
---
100% agree its a remake of the old version of the game, if you want something else that is what BFA is there for.
---

My hamster wheel powered toaster handles it pretty well.  You should be ok.

(seriously though, I first ran WoW on a SINGLE core processor with maybe 512mb video card, though it did struggle a bit on certain raid encounters)

Doesn't matter how many times you say it, it's still an idiotic thing to say and you're not convincing anybody.
---
It would very much surprise me if they wouldn't offer such a service.
---
Probably something like one free copy, but paid service for alts (what's the cost for a retail server hop? Something like that). 
---
Personally I wouldn't do a transfer, but a copy sounds reasonable. Of course a fresh start for everyone is also possible, but I doubt Blizzard would say no to thousands of dollars worth of character copies.
---
No that's 1. General, on the pserver I'm on now there is a global 5. LFG channel everyone on the server can see, grinding in silithus I can see people in EPL lf1m Scholo etc. Works out perfectly
---
2560 x 1080p

Yes it is 144hz

---
I did 3 plays back to back within the last month. I'm spent on that one unfortunately.
---
Explain to me how "this is stupid" == "this agitates me"
---
How is it a quirky mechanic? The tooltip explicitly states it shouldn't work like this.
---
From what I understand pservers are tuned higher than classic so it might be even easier.
---
It's not about the classes, it's about the item. Ashkandi does not drop every day. When an item drops and it's a BIS from someone, they should get it, period. BIS does not mean "very good", it means the single best item in the whole game for that particular slot. A warrior with Ashkandi will replace it for the chromatically tempered sword + edge of chaos etc inside the very same dungeon, and will 100% replace it for dark edge of insanity if he is allowed to play 2H.
---
A hunter will never remove it from his slot, period.
---
Synd på Alliance, annars hade detta varit pre is vad jag söker. Själv inte ny, men inte spelat på åratal.

My current build is Ryzen 2700x, 1070 and 32gb ram(overkill but I use this for development as well) and twin 27inch 1080p acers (one at 144hz and the other at like 60 or so I can't remember. The next thing you would need is a monitor that runs at 144hz and the correct cable to run this. HDMI does not run 144 hz to my monitors, only a dual link dvi I believe but I assume other monitors can vary so be sure to research.
---
Where i come from boy, hash is something else all together
---
In my experience (vanilla and on pservers) there is a shortage of tanks and healers for groups, but dps spec warriors can tank just fine all the way up to 60 and so you’ll take him as your tank instead of spamming chat for another hour looking for a “real” tank spec.
---
Hard is relative...
---
I really enjoyed playing on a private server where most bosses had 1,5 - 3 times more life and dealt between 5 and 25 % more dmg. Dealt quite good only patchwork was challenging after nax relase with its hp and dmg buffed.
---
Why are you raiding as arms?
---
The Division 2. It's kinda like WoW + Diablo with guns.
---
Not an accurate test.
---
The retail version of WoW uses higher poly-count models, and higher resolution textures, so it will run worse than Classic.
---
I appreciate you responding with a brain.  I guess poaching really would be a bad thing it would bring.
---
Yea, it was intentional, not a bug. A consequence of the limited debuff slots. I'm sure they would have liked to have every mage have their ignites separate but for fire to be playing at all without ruining the debuffs on every boss, this was the compromise.
---
Do I stick with Druid that's been my main for years on retail (started in wotlk) or go for warlock the one class I haven't played at max yet.
---
I like to pvp a lot along with dungeons and casually raiding. I know all the effort you have to put in as a feral druid to dps but I'm just not really sure if I want to put up with the stigma behind ferals in pve but on the other hand im also not sure if i want to be stuck healing/tanking  content all the time. The one thing that's still drawing me to druid is how fun they are to play in pvp which is one thing i'll be doing a lot of in classic. 
---
As for warlock, I've only leveled one to 25 on a private server but boy was it a breeze. Being able to juggle 2-3 mobs at a time was pretty fun and I loved being able to summon and give people health stones in dungeons. I know everyone talks about how bad farming soul shards was but I really don't think it will be too bad since i'm only going to be casually raiding. The one thing that I don't like about lock is how they have 0 mobility. After playing druid for so long I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
---
ryzen 3000 series are coming out soon so the 2500, 2600, and 2700 series will be a great buy when they are discounted.
---
This is better now than it was when I first saw it back in the day.
---
Can you mention any good indie games?
---
Post results... SS or it didn’t happen
---
"Or maybe WoW just burnt out all of my dopamine receptors." that hit close to home.
---
0/10 chance. In blizzards eyes and financially Classic isnt a noteworthy release, it's a side project that's not considered a "main title".
---
This type of thinking got us to where we are in Classic. Challenge is in Retail, I’m not playing Classic for a “challenge”.
---
Fine. You picked the game, I pick the pieces.
---
I'll be the mighty battleship. You can be the thimble.
---
This is a really good write down!
---
Hi, /u/Knows_all_secrets
---
This video is about how it affects raid dps and speed kills, not individual dps.
---
Start with guide videos or pvp or something to build up a fanbase, videos you can work on while still having a day job. If those videos are popular and you gain a subscriber base you can try streaming. If you just start streaming on twitch out of nowhere I don't think you'll attract much attention.
---
Could probably make an add-on for this
---
Arms warriors do less damage than hunters. If you’re going for “loot efficiency” or whatever to increase raid performance, might wanna try not including specs that are garbage in pve. 
---
Ashkandi is a PVP weapon through and through. It’s not going to affect raid performance who you give it to.
---
A
---
How can you say it's intentional, when the tooltip explicitly states it shouldn't work like that?
---
Do people really need to hear this shit? It's a god damn video game.
---
I’m confused by this. If they release a beta, even assuming the lowest population/interest levels  possible  there will certainly be hundreds of people instantly logging into these starting zones.

Uhh make sure to somersault while jumping for extra speed
---
Just add more slots to the raid lol :p
---
Try playing some soulsborne/sekiro? anything fromsoft makes is genius,that is if you dont mind a challenge
---
Upgrading the arms warrior to a fury spec is more dps than giving this to the warrior, too.
---
No thanks! I dont want this in Classic.  If players want Mythic difficulty, then they have perfect opportunity to do this in The Battle of Azeroth retail game.

---
How do you determine they should have started now?  If release is in august they should have been marketing in April?
---
Why would marketing a game signify a loss of confidence in another game?  Does marketing diet coke make you think regular coke sucks now?
---
My only issue with fixing this mechanic is that it would also warrant reevaluating the 16-debuff limit, which has the potential to change a *lot* in terms of dps rotations and raid compositions.
---
Oh I did, I just mean to say that the stones don't really cut down on the walks all that much. I'm in favor of leaving them in and walking to dungeons sometimes, being summoned other times.

To be fair I did in MOP. I couldn't keep up with my friends who were unemployed whilst I was at work and university. Ended up using it to run raid finder, a bit if professions etc so keep up with weekly caps.

Hands down one of the best dungeons ever made in WoW.  So much going on.

I wonder if the stupid lava hop will still be the preferred way to do it.

I'm leveling with my friend, he'll be healing and we'll ne doing dungeons too
---
Why do you need mining though? Aoe farm and buy the supplies you need for Engineering while you still can have Tailoring as a 2nd prof.

You are probably right. That would make sense to try to stress them properly and make sure they are instancing over when needed.
---
I'm stuck between a Mage and a Lock. I mostly want to PvE with some WPvP shenanigans. Which class would have an easier time finding raid spots and 5 man dungeon spots?

Prep time is long, especially if you want to be stacked with consumables.

Fights are mostly really easy though.

Why would they market it? They are not trying to get new players, they are trying to get back the people who quit, and all of us already know about it.

A friend still believes E3 is where they will announce it and start hyping it all crazy like, but I hope we don't need to wait that long!
---
It might sound weird, but I loved that you had to spend time forming a group, running to the dungeon, and learning/explaining what to CC and strats for a room or boss.
---
Running to dungeons, depending on faction, was sometimes an adventure on it's own. Exploring new zones, getting a new flight path, finding a new quest hub. Great stuff.
---
Everyone was super congratulatory when folks got a level or an upgrade. 
---
Had a good tank/healer/dps? Add to friends and invite them again.
---
No, but marketing a 14 year old coke recipe may make me think the current coke recipe isn't doing so well...
---
F
---
ALL HANDS ON DECK!
---
Thank you!
---
90% of these go to hunters and rets
---
Ah yes, my first Sub-Dom relationship
---
Yeah, it feels this way. Unless they are going to drop the date around something like E3..... but even then, how far out from the release will they announce something?
---
There is a guide I saw on this forum yesterday, on leveling cooking/fishing to max by level 35.
---
I never even thought about that 
---
I use to work for Rent a Center but after working there for 2 years I guess I just have a bad taste in my mouth from them 
---
I’ll try this though , thanks for the heads up
---
I see a Sopranos meme, I upvote. I'm a simple man.

Some men just want to watch the world burn
---
Reputation won't mean jack if you can buy name changes. (Blizz yet to confirm or deny.)
---
This means unpunished ninja looting.
---
Um. Remember that int doesn't give spell power in vanilla. A 20 int buff to 5 players is worth 1/3% crit to each, so it's worth about as much as giving a single player 1.7%crit. That's not as good as most mh/offhand combos, even pre-av.
---
Try and convince her to play too! :P
---
Everything was meaningful back then and people knew it, so they were excited for you! You werent handed anything in vanilla. Everything was earned.
---
I can't speak for everyone. Getting constantly inconsequential rewards, it doesn't give me any fulfillment. I don't know what recent expansion have done to just fail at having fulfilling rewards. Probably burnt receptors you were saying.
---
I think that WoW have started and been for a few expansions, punishing players who were used to the non-twitchy gameplay that Classic+TBC had and are catering more and more to the younger and "twitchier" players. 
---
It feels like the class and most raid encounters are designed in a way that they feel like a constant full speed sprint, even on a non-competitive level. Maybe i'm just getting too old at 27yo to be playing these twitchy games. Let's all hope WoW:Classic is a  colossal success so Blizzard will release The Burning Crusade in the future
---
Hahahaha you have to expand your horizon of shitty games then.  Blizzard is far from the worst, especially among other AAA developers.  They’ve had their issues with new expansions and games at launch, but it’s typically volume based on the server (something you can’t beta test for) and it’s usually resolved within a few days.  What are you referencing with Diablo 3?  The Error 37 at launch?  As frustrating as that was, the game was far from unplayable during that time.
---
For comparison for bad launches and horrifically unfinished / unpolished games follow the absolute disaster that is *Anthem*.
---
especially if going with a healer you never want to level as prot. you’ll be doing at most a fifth of your optimal dps with virtually no surviability increase. 
---
110% go for the leveling dps spec and for dungeons just change to a shield unless you want to bore your healer friend and yourself to death by taking a minute to kill mobs
---
They have blizzcon. They don't normally do much of anything at all at E3.
---
This sub hates the idea of adding extra opt-in instanced challenges that wouldn't affect the core game.
---
Basically, this sub follows the fallacy that any and all change to vanilla is bad. (but of course pussy out when it comes to the *massive* changes brought from the class revamps, because secretly they know classic would be garbage without them)
---
This is dumb af tbh. 
---
It's possible that, if vanilla ends up being superpopular, that they expand on it after a while. The last thing you want is to have to update the world so it works for both graphics. Because yes, they'd have to make the world equally goodlooking to the player models for it not to look completely ridiculous.
---
2 different types of models don't work in a game longtime so eventually one would die out. JUST LIKE IN RETAIL.
---
No new models. Only old models.
---
there will still be different BIS for different phases. 
---
 BIS in Phase 1 will be different than Phase 2 because diremaul comes out which will introduce different items into the game.
---
Do you need an active subscription to be considered for the Beta?
---
They aren't even the same game anymore.
---
Oh I am aware, but that is SO far off, that they are not waiting till then. IF they are going to market it early, then E3 might be one of the biggest platforms. At least I think it would be?
---
I believe because its not used in any shape of form as a matter of healing, that should still be okay.
---
No name change or RIOT!
---
Hunters have a rotation where they can weave in raptorstrike in between auto shots. Hence a really good 2h weapon is needed.
---
I run the 1.12 client at 144fps no problem with a 2500k, RX 480 and 12 gigs of ram with a bunch of crap running in the background so I imagine you'd be fine.
---
This sub is a meming shitfest
---
Everything you just said about CU has been said about nearly every single MMORPG to come out since Warhammer Online. Never again can I be talked into hyping myself up for a new MMO after over a decade of unfinished games and disappointment.
---
If it really ends up being a fantastic game then cool, I'll give it a go, but I've been burned way too many time by MMORPG's and false promises to ever invest the slightest shred of hope in one before it's released. Classic WoW aside, ofc.
---
I used to enjoy browsing this sub sorted by new.  Now I waste most of my time downvoting 90% of the posts because it's the same posts over and over.
---
Perfecting my bank roof jumping skills
---
"Hunters have a rotation where they can weave in raptorstrike in between auto shots. Hence a really good 2h weapon is needed."
---
Copied from reply above.
---
This sub doesn't move fast enough to really need that kind of moderation.  All the important and relevant information is stickied.  We're 80,000 hype men here and growing.
---
Just stop dude.
---
Nope a subscription isn't required, For example i got in the BFA beta last year without an active one.
---
Good choice. Playing classic must be like rolling forsaken for this kind of grind.
---
Albion Online just went F2P, I gave it a shot, and now I'm waiting Classic on it. Ho and doing W3 campaign again !
---
Lol, Blizzard is literally selling people a 14yr old game, and you act like they're doing you a favor.
---
They don't need a stress test because they could easily spin up a botnet to do this in house from remote server spots. If they wanted to give us a huge surprise they could easily keep it hush hush and we'd just see it when they announced release.
---
I agree they were useless.  But most true holy priests took them.
---
And remember to hit shift+v
---
Fishing.
---
I guess I'll try tanking and if I'm not doing dmg ill swap out, but I'm not convinced just putting on a shield will be enough damage mitigation
---
Yeah, that's a good point. I'm sure a decent number of people flip flopped since then too.
---
I'd like to see the 10k player sample from last summer compared to a new one after a release date is announced, probably when this sub gets to 100k. I'm sure it'll be a nightmare of work for the surveyors though.
---
&gt; without using raid finder.
---
Just to clarify:  You don't use raid finder for actual raids in retail.  Only LFR, which does not count as actual raids (seriously it's basically cutscenes with loot, it's that easy...).  Actual raids you have to form by hand and run/fly to the instance like in vanilla.   Difference being you need like...10-25 people (raid size flexes out side of Mythic which is static 20 people) instead of 40-60 people.
---
It's also BIS for PvE with melee weave playstyle which technically gives the most dps as a Hunter. Melee and range attacks have different attack timers and 3.5 attackspeed is perfect for adding a melee attack inbetween auto shots and active range abilities combined with Nerubian Slavemaker.
---
There was a theorycrafting post here about a week ago which explains this way better than I can.
---
They pretty much never market anything at E3, so why would they start with classic? They don't need a convention to market something, if they even plan on marketing it.
---
We still don't know all the information. For example, Sunken Temple quests. They were added periodically for each class from 1.4 to 1.12. So do they all get added in Phase 2? Phase 3? Will they add a few for each class in each phase? Will they hold off on adding items that were adding to mobs that already existed in previous phases, for example Onslaught Girdle?
---
Vanilla wow twink on a notorious pserver, Street Fighter (V and 3s).
---
If you aren’t trolling then you have no understanding of your audience on this sub, and for that matter little understanding of why the classic wow audience wants classic wow. 
---
It really doesn’t matter whether it’s a good or bad idea (which, lol it’s a bad idea), just that this audience isn’t looking for new ideas at all. The point is that we want vanilla wow servers not some sort of weird vanilla+ that some trolls keep pushing, which makes people here immediately think “ah this is a retail player who just doesn’t get the appeal, get lost.”
---
I've pondered on starting a #WoWBody trend. The idea is that you make your fitness a high priority with the goal of looking similar to your character by the end of a particular phase. No female dwarves allowed.
---
Yeah. What a great "friend" I had. Ditched me the second he realised his ninja looting idea was found out. I guess he thought it wouldnt be a big deal but when it was he decided to blame it all on me.
---
This is why i sub here
---
How does this work with minimum range on their auto shot?
---
it's not bis for hunters either, except in pvp. For pve there are a ton of other better options for hunters.
---
AoE2 is lit af.
---
You should play some Old School Runescape too.
---
I was always a fan of dressing up in Blue Overalls, a Straw Hat and equipping a Farmer's Broom then going to Duskwood to beat noobs to death with a Broom.
---
are you sure that's a thing outside of private servers? i've noticed this before and also on the priest i'm currently leveling, that casting does not reset the melee swing timer as, afaik, it should, meaning i cast a spell and accidentally right-click the mob and i just instantly dong him with my staff. should be the same for ranged auto shot
---
&gt; You could pop all cooldowns and do massive damage while standing in the fire for a few seconds to make sure you got as much out of the cooldowns as possible, the healers could top you up for awhile but eventually you'd move (or not).
---
IN LFR, sure.  In actual raids (LFR is not actual raiding and is *not* a fair comparison to Vanilla raids, you shoudl be comparing normal or heroic difficulty) this is not the case.  You can and will get your ass 1 shot in retail raids....way more easily than in Vanilla.
---
😤😤
---
Yeah, but there are very few fights where a hunter can reliably melee weave, true though that in those few situations, ashkandi would probably be bis
---
Honestly the sacrifice for "smite spec" is very little.  If you aren't worried about farming you can skip Spirit Tap and go Spiritual Healing and heal 100%.  If you take spirit tap to farm you will miss out on 10% increased healing, which is significant but it's a small sacrifice for being able to do shit solo in the world without downtime.
---
not too familiar with vanilla i assume then? prot warrior damage is laughably low even decked in raid epics and its the norm to have dps warriors tank with def stance and a shield while leveling and for the most part in max level dungeons too.  im not trying to be rude but prot really has no benefits while leveling up and it would only gimp your speed
---
You’ll want a 1080 or equivalent and at least a 3.8ghz quadcore processor with 16GB (drr4 2133mhz if possible) and it might be not enough in big raid groups.
---
This increases confusion, increases complexity, and decreases immersion.
---
What is the in-universe explanation for multiple versions of Ragnaros existing?  It diminishes the accomplishment of defeating "normal" Rag, because you haven't *really* defeated him.
---
It also dilutes the clear sense of progression (not just gear-driven) from Molten Core to Naxxramas.  Feeling the difficulty ratchet up as your guild progresses through raid tiers is part of the magic.  Naxx, even today, is *hard*.  The encounters may not be as mechanically cluttered and complicated as modern encounters, but there still exists very little numerical margin for error.
---
Look at the speed running community that has emerged on private servers: even without adding artificially difficult encounters, players have created additional challenge for themselves in trying to beat their previous best time, max out their character's DPS, etc.
---
The model you're suggesting is what drove a lot of us away from modern WoW.
---
As long as they let us have the OLD stealth animations I'm good.
---
Depends on what you like.   
---
There's a list of a few hundreds of games which i'd recomend to others.
---
Total War Warhammer 2 and classic pservers.
---
You’ve baked a pretty big judgment into this by saying that varying difficulty levels would not affect the core game. A judgment many would disagree with.
---
Why is it so good for hunters b/c of Attack Power, when people constantly scream that attack power is shit for hunters and not to give them Might?   Can someone explain this?
---
I've been this mage in vanilla.  It's awesome until the boss turns around and one shots you.
---
I'm pretty sure by raid finder they actually meant the group finder which is definitely used to find people for raids in retail and didn't exist in vanilla.
---
I'd recomend you slightly unhype that game. There's no way it's gonna live up to expectation.
---
1.12 client and classic isnt the same. You should compare classic to bfa frame rate.
---
I'm not but I've researched enough to question you, it would help if you provided evidence of what you're saying instead of repeating it. Didnt see this mentioned in any guide
---
Buuuuuuut maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
I'm sorry if you're being genuine, but some people on the internet absolutely ruin it for others. Which absolutely sucks. I hope you will sort your hardware issues out though, would be sad if you missed out on Classic because of it.
---
You don't want a super fast offhand it eats up too many flurry stacks.
---
this was literally posted 1 day ago
---
You can use group finder to find members for your regular/heroic/mythic(lol) raid. I think that's partly what he's referring to.
---
Mages are always needed for dungeons because of polymorph but you'll have an easy time finding a spot as both, maybe a little harder as mage since there will be so many of them but each raid group will have like 5 so you should be good. All in all do you want the tanky dot class with pets or the mobile bursty caster with some of the most annoying snares in the game.
---
Working for IT I loved this just for them breaking out all the infrastructure changes. I was originally thinking they could fire up some old servers and put the latest patch in, but realized it's 2019. They use the cloud just like all of my clients and they can't/won't do that again because it's inefficient.
---
I liked the overall video. Gave me hope that Classic is in good hands. Hopefully the Classic team tells Blizzard to fuck off and keep destroying retail.
---
This one made me laugh really hard for some reason.  Like way more than it probably should have.
---
&gt; I think running wow in 144 fps is a little bit of an overkill
---
There's no such thing as overkill.
---
I hear you man 
---
But I’m sure if it releases in August or maybe even late July I’ll be fine
---
Just sucks this happened all of a sudden
---
Play warlock man. You’ll have a blast!
---
They did a really good job with this presentation. Got into the nit and gritty without confusing the viewer.
---
I mean, if it's BiS for hunters, that's juts the way it is. If something is BiS for a specific class, they shouldn't get hate for it. But yeah, I get the overall joke.
---
If we want to have the “what happens after Naxx” discussion again, then maybe...
---
the wow engine is garbage and you may struggle to hit 144fps in some situations regardless of hardware
---
Yea that's what im probably going to end up doing. I'll just have druid as an alt gatherer or something. Thanks for the reply!
---
I would say 60% of people who want classic just want to play the game with core mechanics intact. Talents,  abilities,  things to mean something.  Adding a layer of opt in difficulty that has no loot changes or anything that actually changes any core features shouldn't affect those other people.
---
Indeed. Game industry overall is not completely screwed, it's AAA games. In past years I haven't bought a single AAA game and still I've found many great games I've had fun with.
---
Some actual advice. Thanks:D
---
Sure but if its 10 percent of what the trailer made it seem I will be more then satisfied the big think is it will be a full game whens its released with no game breaking bugs or basically a game in alpha no micro transactions and a company who is doing everything it can to keep fans happy
---
Lmao... but this is where I get ALL my financial advice.  Any I doing it wrong?
---
Is it weird that I'm really looking forward to going back to shadowbolt - shadowbolt - shadowbolt
---
OSRS, good time sink and something I can continue playing alongside classic when it launches.
---
Rune of the Guard Captain..Horde only....*cries in Dwarfish*
---
I've got all of those, the bestiary, and dungeon companion. Man I am hype about the idea of using these books again.
---
I assume you were Alliance based on this:  The only zone on that server that is 1000% cancer is redridge, and it's just because of one or two players that camp the zone quite literally 24/7 to the point where people worry about their mental state.  The rest of the server is fine (yes STV and Duskwood have lots of gankers...but they did in actual vanilla also....in fact I had MORE trouble in STV in actual vanilla than I did on this pserv).
---
How will I ever enjoy playing the game if I don't spend 45 minutes fighting 100 other people trying to tag every single imp that spawns!?
---
Thank you for a response with a brain.  Tbh i didn't mention it in the main post,  but was going to say the difficulty gets removed upon a new tier coming out so that you don't get the hard mode to regular mode feel between tiers, but i understand what you mean.
---
I get the feeling that the lore for Old Gods and Bird Box are pretty similar. Especially the Yogg-Saron encounter. Seems like both of them borrow from the Lovecraft realm.
---
damn bro that is a rough layout. I always think of November + December as the "gotta plan these months around holidays/events" months, but you've got four extra months tacked on to the end! oof
---
If you are an arms warrior in BWL, no chance you are getting this. If you cant even be bothered to spec properly for raid, you dont deserve a BiS weapon. Thats just reinforcing bad behavior. Your whole raid will be arms then.
---
If there's no loot or drops or any rewards (except bragging rights), then it's a completely opt-in experience that you never need to participate in.
---
It simply gives the player more choice for an extra challenge. It's like doing molten core without half your gear to look naked: it's an extra challenge that doesn't affect anyone else
---
I have played on a private server recently soI know what you are talking about with the LFG channel being seen by everyone but that is not how I remember it in vanilla and according to the link below in vanilla it was local to the zone you are in.
---

That rotation is just complete nonsense. I wish people would stop pretending it's viable.  There are so few fight mechanics where you can just stand still at hit box range and have a perfect rotation. You will undoubtedly clip more shots and look like a moron running around trying to avoid things that you would naturally avoid at max range.
---
I mean you definitely could imo, you just need to figure out a niche that people actually care about. And as other people have said, the odds are not great
---
I'm fine with the polished version of the old models (they were updated to look better with every expac) but not the new ones. Why?
---
Some of the races lost what makes them great. Take Humans as an example. Their models were relatively SLIM, so they could wear robes and look like a mage. They could wear plate armor and still look burly.
---
Then, WoD turned them into Neanderthal gorillas. They have weird proportions. Their wrists are inflated, and they walk too bouncy. The WoD update really improved faces, but hit a wall with the anatomy.
---
Now, if you try to wear robes on a Human Male, it looks fucking horrendous. All of your bulging muscles will be popping out. 
---
And the reason why "having it toggle-able" is not a good idea is because I want people to see my character as he is. I don't want to say "Oh dude, my character looks so good in x form." Think of how useless transmog would have been if it were client side only.
---
But with decent crit doesn't it get you more flurry stacks anyway?
---
Oh, yeah that's true....but IMO that's basically the same thing as spamming in World, but with a UI on top of it so you don't have to constantly repost your shit to chat....it's like posting a wanted add for hired help...not like clicking a button and getting a group auto assigned.
---
Running low level guild members through dungeons and party quests.
---
Wrong... For PvE a hunter will use DW with double enchants. Usually Dagger and sword from ZG.
---
touche
---
Here's video with [better quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYZ_cZRieRU).
---
When did Blizzard confirm this?
---
I liked to sit on my 60 priest in areas like ashenvale and stonetalon, rezzing players that died to dangerous mobs and protecting them from alliance gankers. Felt like my way of "giving back" since 60s protected me in those areas.
---
I agree. But it could still produce useful data. If Retail runs acceptably, you should assume Classic would do no worse.
---
Maybe, but I see a *lot* of comparing LFR in retail to raiding in Vanilla on this sub, and it's not a fair comparison in the slightest.
---
Since it's 1.12 I guess they will all be in the game at release.
---
Running around SW but jumping so I don't land on any cracks in the street.
---
Might is only melee
---
Where does it explicitly state that it shouldn't work like it currently does?
---
Didn't you know that WoW and girlfriend are opposite factions? Once you start grinding WoW again your girlfriend reputation will get back to hated.
---
Crappy memes like these are why people hate memes on this sub. Please put some more effort into the idea of these before you make 'em. Also, repost?
---
\-Sincerely, someone who dislikes BFA.
---
Don’t care for any of the FFIV remakes myself
---
Hard disagree.
---
&gt; instantly inconsequential 
---
Let me tell you how I quit BFA.  
---
Do the PVP conquest grind.  
---
Um....ok I have to choose a weapon. Theres only one choice for Ret. But hey its 370, better than my current!  
---
But since I capped conquest I'll get a chest tomorrow (its monday).  
---
Tuesday: oh boy let's open the chest. Its...THE SAME 2H BUT ILVL 380.  
---
I quit and unsubbed on the spot.
---
Spell batching only applies to user entities interacting with user entities as the server queues both actions up within a certain timeframe
---
not user entities interacting with npcs as those are handles as soon as the server receives the user input
---
Memes fill the gap while we wait for classic release or another blue post.
---
The trick is you have to melee right BEFORE the cast. Casting resets your swung timer, but if you reset it after 0.1s, it hardly matters
---
Wait, AP on weapons applies to ranged?  I guess not knowing that is what I get for literally never playing a hunter (outside of legion just long enough to get 110 and go get the class mounts).
---
Messed around with EQ2 for the first time ever since they released a fresh TLP served a couple of months ago.  Decent game, but didn’t hold my attention for very long.  Then did an EQ1 stint since they decided to launch a fresh TLP server for both games at the same time.
---
And then I actually started a new char up on a Cataclysm p-server after seeing a guild was starting up that plans to progress through each tier of content using only appropriate gear levels beginning with T11.  Never thought I’d be interested in playing Cata again, but literally grasping at straws here trying to fill the void until Classic at this point.  We’ll see where it goes...
---
I would maybe use them if their running animations weren’t so terrible. But until they fix that bouncy run I’ll stick with old models for sure.
---
I want an actual PVP mmo and Camelot is taking too long. BfA could have been it but
---
Took me about 30 min of farming before a raid and they dont disappear from you bag so it's really not that bad
---
Resto Druid is definitely viable, it’s just not quite as good at healing as the other classes. Still, you’ll absolutely be able to find raid spots.
---
Also, I leveled as balance. 
---
My best friend and I both made druids, he leveled as feral I leveled as balance. My main takeaway for you would be that it IS doable. It’s definitely not as efficient as leveling as feral, although I think the transition into healing is easier. But yeah there’s quite a bit of downtime if you’re leveling as balance. It’s possible though, I did it and enjoyed it WAY more than my first character I leveled to 60 which was a mage.  
---
Druid is insanely fun, especially in WSG. I played Druid from vanilla to MoP and loved every minute of it. 
---
I’m going priest (possibly Paladin, I’m on the fence) this time around though just to mix it up a bit, plus I really like healing.
---
Can you explain why you are using double enchanting on the 1Hs for comparison but not +25 agility on 2H? That is an extra 50 AP and .5% crit. You're kinda heavily skewing it in favor of your argument and even then it barely breaks even. 66 ap 2% crit vs 136 ap .5% crit and, because fuck it, 1% dodge as well.
---
Yeah for sure. Yet another reason i'm looking forward to Classic is I'll have a reason to find a good guild. The last time I cared about my guild was back in TBC/WotLK. It's going to be nice meeting people in game again.
---
those come in phase 5.
---
Yeah no joke 
---
From Late November til the beginning of April Money is usually pretty tight 
---
But it all works out , things could be worse
---
Later, dual pugios (rogues hate this simple hunter dps trick)
---
T
---
i agree its getting ridiculous, they said a classic summer and its may. really hoping they dont fuck us by releasing it after august
---
Son of a bitch....I've played an insane amount of paladin and I somehow never noticed that AP on weapons and AP on might aren't the same thing.  I guess not knowing that is what I get for literally never playing a hunter (outside of legion just long enough to get 110 and go get the class mounts).
---
Same for server/faction changes. I’ll be upset if blizz says, “police yourselves, GMs won’t intervene for loot dispute. Also, anyone can ninja anything and server transfer so the community can’t police/shun anyone”.
---
Looks like the link to "Beta profile settings" changed from http://account.blizzard.com/beta-profile.html to https://eu.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html
---
The former page 404s, so they've clearly seen an uptick in beta interest and wanted to get the link fixed.
---
Will kiting Kazzak to SW be possible?
---
Or just check this sub.  I usually find them here faster :p
---
We assume. I mean itemization is going to be 1.12 all the way out. There is no confirmation that quests that were added in 1.11 (outside of raid/pvp quests/vendors) won't be there in phase 1.
---
Also: might is only melee attack power, so if you have to choose, wusdom is a higher priority. But if you have 4 pallies, get might
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview
---
It's not classic if you're not playing at 800×600 at 12FPS.
---
oh i was counting for the 2h enchant.  
---
2x15 agi vs 25agi = +10ap for 1hs (5 agi = 10 ranged ap)  
---
Should probably have split the parts.
---
Handles what? The performance on the old vanilla client is irrelevant, as the game will run on the new client.
---
Considering how many times ive died because i couldnt get a heal off, you got a point.
---
This has been a question on my mind since I heard about WoW Classic... I really hope it is but my gut tells me Blizzard would rather not deal with the issues that can bring.
---
No Attack Power is amazing with Hunters. Re read what *vanilla* blessing of might does. https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25291
---
"melee" that's why might sucks for hunters and literally every other blessing takes priority.
---
&gt;This isn't a change, its an addition
---
Move the goalposts all you'd like, but adding something that wasn't originally there is, in fact, a change
---
If you’re looking for games with great atmosphere and action then look at Dark Souls 1-3 and Sekiro! The Dark Souls games all have DLC/Collection editions, but they are really well built and thought out, more like expansions than extra tacked on stuff.
---
Witcher 3 is incredible. No need to expand too much into it at this point.
---
And indie gaming has never been better! Stardew Valley, Slay the Spire, Hollow Knight, Rimworld, Enter the Gungeon, Baba Is You, Darkest Dungeon, The Binding of Isaac, Undertale, and on and on!
---
True End-game Content! I can totally relate to this. Also, finding the out-of-bounds clip that let me get under Stormwind was pretty cool until I had to kill myself to get back to where I was supposed to.

Instructions clear, will ditch only friend

I really like asmondgold honestly lol. I haven't really even been invested in the game since classic. I mean I played Lich King for a month and a couple other expansions but never more than like 2 months compared to like 2 years of vanilla. I don't always agree with what he says but find his rants entertaining and learn a lot about retail and other expansions I didn't know.
---
Ejaculation *and* urine receptor? That's the kind of efficiency you only get from the Germans.
---
\&gt;.&gt; But then I can't respawn inbounds.
---
Haha wtf
---
Oh cool!
---
I've heard Paladins are the better healers at 60, is that true?
---
Amazingly my bp at last checkup was 118/73.
---
I do walk about 5 miles a day though.   I just eat like shit.
---
You're free to think that, but as someone who serves, possesses a Geneva Conventions card, and have first hand witnessed and supported the recovery of persons that were under duress and needed the protection of the Geneva Conventions, it's not something that I want to see devalued.
---
Primitive and disgusting behavior is the exact reason the Geneva Conventions exists, to protect us against said behavior.
---
I wouldn't compare a religious drawing to getting internally ripped to shreds by hallow point bullets or being a victim of a war crime.
---
If you are on BWL progression, it is BiS only for hunter though. After ZG, it is basically useless on everyone in PvE. No harm in tossing it to the hunters in the meantime. It does fuck all for anyone else except a ret paladin I guess.
---
But you dont have decent crit rate as dual wielding preBiS warrior, because so much of your +% alotment goes into +hit%, because as dualwield you need so much of it.
---
Only later on you will just crit after crit after crit all the time.
---
Not really. I couldn't get into modern WoW's wack-a-mole style gameplay either. I was so hyper focused on my own rotation it was as if nobody else was even there, somehow it turned what should be a massive social experience into basically playing Simon on my own.
---
The simpler rotations let you look up and take in the whole experience with everybody else.
---
True. Not a bad thought.
---
depends on your crit and hit rate but for prebis you definitely don't have the gear to keep flurry up with a fast offhand.
---
Yeah 100% agree, that is why most hunters don't try it and in all fariness shouldn't. Buuuuuuuuuut, it is technically BiS if you are good enough.
---
Yea, if you have the mechanics of a potato, don't do the rotation...
---
Rank 14's rise up
---
absolutely vile. he'd probably get to 60 in a week though..
---
Whatever  you like
---
+healing. Early on generic +damage/healing is rare, so your damage set will be mostly pure +shadow damage.
---
Also most pre-20 most +x gears aren't really worth it due to Pre-20 penalty and typically having less than maximum cast speed further reducing your coefficient.
---
1-20 just stick with Of the Owl gear (+int/Spirit). 20+ you start finding +healing or +specific damage gear more often, though it's still somewhat rare unless you get a green with Of Healing or Shadow Wrath. Again, if you can't find anything better, stick with Owl or anything that gives a good amount of Int/Spirit.
---
30+ is where you really start to find more +healing or +X gear. 
---
There's also more crafted gear with good stats on it now. (there are some gloves at 20 for pretty much every element you can craft via tailoring but they're world drop patterns). Robe of Power is a tailor-only goody for the early 30's that has good stats a fair amount of +damage/healing that can last you into the early 40's. And starting around 39+ you start finding more craftable gears with caster stats on them.
---
Shadoweave gear becomes available in the early mid-40's (but you need to do a quest in the Searing Gorge before the trainer will teach you the patterns, so generally you'll need to buy it from someone else since the quest is like level 48 or so to do (most of the gear tops out at like level 42), though it's still a fair amount of +shadow damage for its level if you haven't found any similar level Shadow Wrath gear, and the mats are pretty cheap.
---
As for the healing itself. Save mana pots you find for dungeon healing, or last-resort emergencies while soloing. Try to snipe killing blows where you can to trigger spirit tap during battle to get some extra mana. Aside for that, just find the lowest rank heal that will get the job done and use that with stop casting.
---
if you're using a bunch of pure owl stuff your regen should be fine for using max/near max rank heals with stop-cast. if that's over-kill, stick with a lower rank.
---
Yeah, I covered this in another reply:  I've literally never played hunter outside of Legion and even then I did it just long enough to get to 110 and get all the colors of the class mount (I got all colors of all class mounts for all classes in legion and hunter I did second to last...just before warlock b/c i hate pet classes).   I also pretty much exclusively play paladin outside of when I was doing that in legion....I just quite literally never paid attention to the difference between might's AP and item AP.   
---
Also to clarify before I get called nub:  I DO NOT put might on hunters, I do put Wis on them (or salv or light)...I just never paid attention to the difference and assumed it was b/c of ability scaling.
---
There are plenty of low pop pservers to practice leveling routes on
---
There are plenty of amazing games out there! There are a few AAA games that have been alright I'd say. Or there are plenty of indie games that you dip your hand in!
---
Might be worth getting a ps4? Plenty of great games! 
---
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
---
”How do you kill that which has no life”
---
Yeah, shadow is king in 1v1 except against someone who can match the damage output and counter/negate the damage through healing. Itll be a difficult decision. 
---
I raided as the Priest class leader and healing manager way back in the day so I completely agree with having 1 or 2 utilities spread across the priests in the group. (We don't ALL need spirit buff capabilities)
---
Making content opt-in isn't a magic wand for preventing it from affecting the game.  Adding more difficult versions of raid content, even without attaching tangible rewards, dilutes the experience of defeating "normal" content.  Suddenly, killing "normal" Ragnaros means a little less because I haven't *really* killed him.  The "real" Rag still exists.  And how do you explain multiple versions of this content in-universe?
---
I think this also holds the potential to make guild management more difficult.  What do you do when half your guild wants to go back to heroic MC and the other half doesn't?  Collecting and herding 40 cats is already plenty difficult.
---
&gt; It's like doing molten core without half your gear to look naked: it's an extra challenge that doesn't affect anyone else.
---
So why not just do that?  Players on private servers already impose plenty of artificial difficulty barriers in clearing raid content (e.g. speed running).  Emergent gameplay is a *good* thing.
---
They will announce it when its ready. They are still doing internal testing.
---
We have all experienced rushed releases, the end result is people complaining and displeasure.
---
I'm all for it releasing in August as long as we get a near perfect launch.
---
I can also see them doing a "surprise launch" as well, considering its now a new IP its just a matter of them opening servers and making sure they are stress tested properly.
---
Well patch 1.12 was released on August 22nd, 2006 so maybe .....
---
Grinding with rested, omg 👌.  I don't know if it's actually better, but I just love doing it.
---
Yeah, it would be so absolutely horrible if they pushed back the release date to make sure the game is fully ready with minimal amount of issues /s
---
Its just under 1.5 million accounts for lights\*\*\*\* with just under 280k active accounts.  There are surely duplicates like you said.  People need to realize that this is why blizzard doesn't give 2 shits about classic.  Its a significantly small number of people that are going to be playing the game for the long haul.  They cant monetize it.  I'm sorry, but if you think Classic is bringing back people in the multiple millions on launch, for extended periods of time, I think you're going to be disappointed.  I hope I am the one that is wrong because the extended success of Classic will likely govern if TBC servers are announced,  Seasonal Classic Servers, or nothing changes.
---
That’s extremely self centered.
---
I absolutely love the new models and you don’t want a toggle just because you want to force me to see your character in the old models.
---
Probably, I think it's the standard for p servers. But its understandable. This place takes so long that I can't think of too many people that would be willing to sit through the whole run.
---
might gives melee attk power. Blank attk power also applies to ranged attacks.
---
You’ve changed the entire endgame. Guilds will compete on these hard-mode challenges instead of what they compete on now. You might think that is better, but it is absolutely a change to the experience of the game. Among other things, it introduces yet more tiers of elitism that are annoying to some people who just enjoy WoW as a good MMORPG. If you want insanely hard PvE mechanics, there are games for that. Vanilla just isn’t all about that, and that’s how some of us like it.
---
My coworker just saw cartoon pubes, can we get a NSFW please?
---
Quite funny actually how dedicated they are to that zone. I rarely do more than a hand full of quests in that zone anyway. With darkshore, loch, westfall, there’s almost no need to do it. Did a few there last night and as I walked to the inn to log off, there was the tauren Druid chasing people in the inn
---
I am really looking forward to leveling a paladin, but I have some questions about holy tree gearing. I know that a lot of paladin BiS gear is cloth/leather, but when non-plate drops, do paladins generally get a chance at this gear? Also I see a lot of people talking about how good they are in PvP because they can wear plate, but how can they be tanky if a lot of gear is from the cloth/leather/mail family of armors? Lastly, is there *any* 'good' spell power plate that people are targeting? 
---
I have played a lot of paladins from WoTLK and on, so I am used to items that are actually built for a paladin and not borrowed from other armor classes, so I am just trying to wrap my head around it.
---
All good questions.  I can answer at least one of them.  From what I've read all items will be in their 1.12 state (as in stats that were changed along the way) but items will be added to loot pools in their intended patch "bucket" (so "catch-up" epics added to bosses in later patches will not be there right away).
---
Mind numbingly dull.
---
And also mandatory for a full 20 minutes in order to even see the content.
---
Just got Forza horizon 4 on pc, it's included in Microsoft game pass, and that only costs £1 for 3 months at the minute.
---
A hope.
---
Id be curious to see how the game would have evolved without the queue system.
---
just go alliance lock, its not as bad as everyone makes it seem.
---
I hear you, but don’t you think a lot of that content is satire?
---
No one is saying that.
---
Most of the memes on here about "no-lifing" are people who are taking time off work to try and speed level with their guild... Because it's a lot easier to put in 200 hours over 2 weeks with no work than 2 months with work.
---
I seriously see so many people bitching about people power gaming, and circlejerking about how much better the game is when you play it casual... and literally zero posts about how you need to put in 100 hours a week, quit your job, and how you'll be a failure if you don't have scarab lord.
---
You're the one blowing things out of proportion.
---
I 100% hope it is.
---
I see now, I was wondering what was up with your math lol you were only using the difference. Makes more sense. Maybe it was just my experience, but I feel like most people will see two Ashkandi drop before 2 core hound fangs. ZG weapons are indeed better, but that comes after BWL. Ashkandi does fuck all on anyone in PVE aside from hunter...(and I guess ret paladin?) In progression it is definitely BiS option most of the time. After ZG it's just a whoever want's a big pvp weapon drop.
---
Do you actually have a WoW box to tick? I only see Overwatch, HotS, Diablo, SC &amp; Warcraft.
---
Ye true, but should i miss one i can just bookmark and check the link u/TT_Hughes shared :)
---
Why are you here?
---
Its funny cuz it's gross
---
What do those people do once they've beaten all the content available in classic, ie. naxx clear, full BiS, rank 14 grind, on every class, etc etc.   
---
You would get bored of not having anything more to do in the game wouldn't you? The only thing to do would be to hang out in orgrimmar/stormwind and use trade chat as a chatting app.  
---
Personally I would like to see them add content after naxx while staying true to the theme of classic, maybe unreleased zones/raids that they had wanted/planned to release back in 06, maybe something like making a Kharazhan Crypts raid, or whatever. That way it could be vanilla forever without content going stale once everyone has cleared everything.
---
Reading these comments just give me a feel of nostalgia here. No one knew where the dungeon was, no one knew what it consisted of, the difficulty, the loot, or anything. It was all new to us and everyone was living the moment of exploring this amazing mmo. I love every bit of this.
---
yes there was confirmation. read the blueposts.
---
yea if you have zero muscle.
---
Only one monitor? Just because it's Classic doesn't mean we have to live in the dark ages.
---
... Yes
---
How did you find me here, dad?
---
Also, for any rogues out there,  [http://shadowpanther.net/](http://shadowpanther.net/)  exists again.
---
ahh but the item progression means that Bonereaver's Edge will be BiS for Warrior PvP, Hunter can have Ashkandi if they want (or ret pala LOL)
---
Why is the front of the car in Org and the back in SW?
---
That's the one!
---
Not necessarily.  Naxx was available in 1.12 and will most certainly not be available at launch.  Blizzard is rolling out content in phases in order to gate progression, and this includes gear that was introduced alongside new content.  Here's an excerpt from [Blizzard's explanation of their plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346):
---
&gt; Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
&gt; One example of the many items we’re planning for is: Titanic Leggings, which is a world drop that first appeared in 1.10. We can confirm that it will be controlled by the same content unlock that restricts the other 1.10 loot changes.
---
You have a slow range weapon and in and out during range auto CD.
---
&gt;I seriously see so many people bitching about people power gaming, and circlejerking about how much better the game is when you play it casual.       
---
        
---
The post isn't about casual vs hardcore, its about how unhealthy obsessions can become.       
---
         
---
&gt;You're the one blowing things out of proportion.       
---
       
---
Minimizing an issue and pretending it doesn't exist is a good way to deceive yourself mate.
---
Im actually pretty sure T0 pieces didnt drop for opposite factions except the BoEs. I specifically remember selling Gauntlets of Elements on the neutral AH for like 35g (lol) and telling my friend about it and him saying that Elements shouldnt drop for Allys and then myself thinking that I had never actually seen the BoP pieces drop.
---
Purely anecdotal, but its a very specific memory I have.
---
Lmao that face at the end is perfect
---
It doesn't? It says your critical fire spells cause damage over time as well (paraphrasing). It doesnt explicitly state "every instance of Ignite uses it's own debuff slot and cannot be stacked". Consolidating ignite was nessecary for the spec to exist in 40man.
---
Maybe in a shitter guild I guess!
---

'nuf said.
---
Game files.
---
I played WOW on a cheap Dell laptop for yeaaaars. I would consider looking into a laptop! I feel you though :/ mine shit out recently and I’m hoping I can save enough for a new by release
---
I hope your coworker will be able to get over this trauma in time.
---
Where have they ever stated it will be removed?
---
Never.
---
Oh, ok. I enjoyed it. Only play to min/max boys, never do anything remotely different ever lol.
---
https://youtu.be/uxF53OCsN3Q
---
Mind your own business
---
My bad, I think my page loaded before he sent his reply or something. I want to point out, because it seems like it wasn't covered, this is just in vanilla. Might is all AP after that. It's all good, just one of the quirks of vanilla that people forget or never were told. Your instinct was right from your experience.
---
Blizzard has never promised to remove sharding.  Think about that.
---
Mages and Locks are both good, but I have a feeling in classic Mages will be a little better than warlocks in PvP this time around.  Warriors are probably going to be the most common class, I'm guessing 20%+ representation, and warriors really deal with fear pretty easily.  Even on Alliance side.
---
As for PvE, mages and warlocks are on pretty even footing imo and compete with each other for loot, though there is a little more of it in raids.
---
Rogues only compete with warriors if you're going combat.  Combat is a good PvE spec but not great PvP.  On daggers there shouldn't be much competition.
---
Hunters have the least gear competition imo.  They are the only class that uses ranged weapons as anything other than a stat stick, and only warriors can try to take dps Mail.  
---
Hunters were a very dominant class in 1.12 PvP and probably the most gear independent because of pets.
---
Nah, it isn't bis at that point either. Even your prebis (dal'rends set) is slightly better, (50 ap, 1% crit and dual 15 agi enchants). And if you got a corehound tooth and doom's edge thats quite a lot better. The only thing ashkandi is bis for is if you're trying to do the melee weaving rotation in pve, and that's only really possible on a small number of boss encounters
---
I dont know. Never heard of so many beta keys that it’d require sharding.
---
Even hundreds of beta keys, folk are split over 3 starting zones for horde and alliance, and then split on starting times.  Can’t see them releasing thousands of beta keys. 
---
Where as at release of classic, there could be hundreds in each zone at the same time, Making the need for sharding. 
---
Again, it’s just my opinion. 😀👍
---
Yes there is harm. Its BiS pvp weapon for warriors and it hardly cjabges the hubter's dps. Hes still bottom of the meters even w this weapon. Dont waste it on a hunter that will replace w ZG weaps lmao.
---
I used a random number generator for you and you got human mage.
---
boys hit the gym hard until release....then you won't have to until you're done grinding out your prebis
---
It's terminal, she's starting to vomit.
---
Definitely best suited on a hunter. We get it, you warriors want it because it looks cool. But for progression in PvE (and PvP) it’s hunter.
---
The only wonky part here is that you imply to maintain the dps on pyro crits because your plague server opts to keep the highest crit dmg while the original concept just kept track of the last 5 crits (and drops any and all weaker ones if multiple happen within the same server application tick - also referred to as ignite fades/munchies) It was even possible to troll the current ignite owner by having your entire mage squad swapping over to scorch to weaken it because of that mechanic.
---
Regarding the clip: it shows how ignite got spammed off thanks to brainless debuff spamming. Which could still happen as it was never a priority debuff even in the 1.7  revamp. 
---
The only relevant factor for ignite is that it can cause a raid wide dps stop on mages if the current owner of the ignite stack is creeping up and runs the risk to pull aggro. Your gimmicky pyro setup is something you can safely forget about once the real servers are up again.
---
It just isn't an issue. They are memes. A tiny percentage of people might be doing that, but those people are already doing that with other games. They know it's unhealthy, and "stop doing that" isn't going to help them, at all. No one is like "yep let me just go quit my full time job and break up with my GF so I can play wow for 14 hours a day". Your post is directed at an audience that just doesn't exist.
---
I think you're one of the very few people who actually take those posts seriously.
---
2H fury is completely legit especially horde side. Hunters get better weaps from ZG. They should not get prio on askhandi.
---
Addons were in Vanilla...
---
I feel attacked.
---
You get seal fate 5/5 at level 39, and SF+imp. Ambush at level 53, so I'm not sure how that's a leveling spec.
---
You're also underestimaring hit chance, weapon skill, parry chance, riposte, and weapon specs. You get a lot of passive benefits from combat. Not having to stealth every single time also helps.
---
Honestly going for SF before improved SS or opportunity(if daggers) or even imp. Backstab/ambush... seems like the worst thing you could do in the early levels.
---
I mean, you're sacrificing so much just to get one extra combo point sometimes.
---
Might aswell just go for initiative.
---
Or maybe improved ambush with remorseless+initiative.
---
It's pretty much the same thing except you get better stuff along the way.
---
Lmao, i love how the urine and ejaculate collector is made in Germany.  It seems fitting
---
I'm absolutely positive that stuff like DPS and threat will be developed/ported to classic in no time. Im really not sure if those add-ons are used in retail now or if they are included. 
---
So far from what I have seen, pfui or something similar, that I used on pservers is working on the alpha client, there was a screenshot of it a few days back. 
---
I have hope that not long after release we will have the add-ons we desire, even if that just means a few qol add-ons like bags, dismount, autoshot timer etc etc.
---
Have fun when all your good warriors leave ypur guild then lol.
---
But how can we find out if Priests can heal!!
---
And it came from saying things like i know we dont want to change but this isnt a change its an addition. If anything happens i hope they do it like osrs where every proposed change is voted on by actively subbed players. Maybe even only level 60s. That way dumb shit doesnt come in because a blizz developer read a reddit post with 70 downvotes and decides hell yeah they'll like this...
---
If you dont like addons then dont install them.
---
I’ve missed playing WoW! I play a lot of crap phone games, and footy Mgr games. 
---
I’m looking forward to playing WoW again as it truly was epic back in vanilla. 
---
I definitely won’t play as long as I did back then, I remember AV weekends, where I wouldn’t leave the house. Raids for 4-5hrs on a Saturday.
---
I have a demanding job, a wife and kids, but I am hyped to play again. I’ll prob play 2-3hrs a night, and raid one night a week once it’s live.
---
Most people are going to say this has been posted multiple times in the last few days/weeks.  The general consensus is that addons were widely used in vanilla, so why would classic be any different?  The beauty of it is, if you don’t want to use addons nothing is stopping you from not using them.
---
&gt; No one is like "yep let me just go quit my full time job and break up with my GF so I can play wow for 14 hours a day
---
Intentionally, I sure hope not. Addictions are very hard to beat though, and before you realise it the damage might have already been made. Lets truly hope that audience doesn't come to life.
---
I shaman really as bad as everyone says? I know resto is the main spec for raiding, but is enhancement useful?
---
You missed Age of Conan, Elder Scrolls, and like four others but nobody remembers what they were.
---
Yikes
---
A pve ***PROGRESSION*** guild that is in the BWL stage doesn't give a flying fuck about that warrior that wants to PVP. He can wait his turn, Ashkandi drops all the time. I saw like more than twenty on a single character. For raid impact, give to hunter until ZG opens.
---
This sounds like a great system! Simple, clean, fair, and if you have enough interested people it sounds really reliable.
---
I play vanilla with no addons except for ones that allow me to move unit frames. I have a massive screen and prefer my nameplates and things to be a little more centralized as opposed to off in the distant top left corner, so I kinda sorta get your idea of the pure fantasy of the game?
---
Addons are 100% optional, and you can play the game without them. There will be addons developed for classic wow. Addons like questhelpers, gatherers, threat and damage meters, boss timers.... all are useful but not necessary.
---
Play the game with none, my man. Detach yourself from the real world and delve into the game like you used to. Just because others use addons, does not mean you have to.
---
This math is flawless
---
And extremely reasonable
---
&gt;I have a demanding job, a wife and kids       
---
Good to know you have your priorities straight, lets hope its a general feeling.
---
Where did you get the idea that addons were not a thing back then? In fact they were way more powerful than they currently are.
---
Thats exactly why i'm going for exalted now. Hopefully I can still be around honored by the time i'm 60.
---
lets not avoid the fact that coke classic which has come out in the past year or so to "bring back that classic coke taste"  is doing much better then the coke from beforehand. the recipe was changed from just coke to coke classic which I find in stores nowadays and I can finally say coke is now better then Pepsi truthfully
---
Rested speeds up both aspects of the game, and the curve of effectiveness is greater the higher level you are.  I would quest rather than grind, because you could almost always keep up rested status in between leveling your main, greatly increasing your speed
---
I am not intending to sacrifice or even damage my studies, my career or my relationship for Classic WoW.
---
That being said however: If someone decides to do so, then that is **his own business**. I am in no position to tell anyone what to do with his life, nor would I be pretentious enough to believe so.
---
You can’t easily tank 5 mans while raid dps spec if you just put the time into collecting tank gear
---
https://mapsfortanks.wordpress.com/the-maps/
---
They weren’t there at the very start...
---
For buffs
---
all my good warriors will have BRE and not care about Ashkandi
---
Fury is the raid spec for dps warriors tho and not arms, which was the other guys point. Warriors don’t use this in raids even if they have it
---
Disc is largely a supporting tree for Holy. You don't have the functionality of disc priests in later expansions. There's no bonuses with the shields, no penance, stuff like that. 
---
I believe you would be disappointed trying Disc Priest in Vanilla in comparison to what you know and love in Cata. Take a look at vanilla talent trees to get a better idea.
---
Disc in Cata is a millions miles away from what it was in vanilla :(
---
Hyped about the game being more complex and flavourful again with classic? Why are you here?
---
why is ashkandi not good in pve?
---
But you're not playing classic for new models. You're playing classic for vanilla quality.
---
I was teetering on the edge of checking out Stellaris. You just clinched it.
---
TBH I always pick the thimble.
---
Your mentality of playing a spec is incorrect when discussing classic.  There’s literally no difference in disc and holy aside from getting slightly altered stats and a couple abilities.
---
It does NOTHING for any class in PvE except hunter. Dalrend is not better, 1% crit =/= 36 AP. Also people seriously seem to underestimate STA value in PvE. Earlier progression (i.e. T2) still runs decent risk and the padding to keep you alive = more dps.
---
&gt; I am in no position to tell anyone what to do with his life
---
So you're one of those who might see someone destroying themselves but will do nothing to help because "you're not pretentious enough" and its their business?
---
So I believe during blizzcon they went over this once. 
---
They want us to be able to use addons, but they want a mixture of the 1.12 client and a portion of the legion / BFA client addon API. 
---
What they dont want from the 1.12 client are things like decursive or ... I think it was Healbot where it would play the game for you automatically. You press one button and you decursive everyone in the raid based on a priority system so there was no overlapping on decurses or something like that. And healbot or whatever it was would down rank your heals automatically and heal the lower person in your group by pressing one button without any real skill. 
---
What they don't want from the 7.x client or 8.x client is the world LFG tool I'm guessing. Things that will allow you to get into an area and automatically join a group thats working on that quest, or a LFG tool at all where you can sign up for groups by just clicking a button.
---
Things they do want i'm assuming are boss mods, ui enhancements, raid frames, and things of that nature from 1.12 and possibly even from the recent client.
---
You won’t know if they’re prot or fury if they tell you they can tank a 5 man and have tank gear there’s really no reason not to bring them
---
To be fair, given the practices commonplace there, I would not be surprised if that was a thing. I had 2 german girlfriends. They are...creative people ;-)
---
&gt; But is it so bad that i should just pick something else? 
---
Yeah, I don't think you've ever heard that. PI is 31 Disc, and PI is played A LOT. In high end PvE and PvP.
---
This sub acts like every Hunter in the game is going to be the same 11 year old from 2004 that they ran into... I really doubt that's going to be the case, at least to the extent thats suggested in so many threads here
---
A PVE PROGRESSION guild doesn't give a fck about the marginal dps bonus a hunter gets when they already killed Nefarian. Also, during progression, this is likely still an upgrade for a warrior, and a bigger one than for the hunter. 
---
But hey. Don't listen to me. Lets look at private servers:
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/Item/Default.aspx?page=1
---
Filter for warriors/hunters. Almost double the amount of warriors have these equipped, never mind in their bags. 
---
It is still a great weapon to DPS as a warrior with when you likely haven't gotten enough weapon drops at that point in the server.  2H fury is no joke especially horde side. 
---
Alot of DPS warriors are basically only in the raid to get that Ashkandi, that is what they want more than anything. You give the first one to  a hunter, people will gquit.
---
Its just manlets coping
---
Really kinda making me feel bad here.
---
Doomposts will ruin any forum. Change my mind.
---
That's why you shouldn't join guilds with GM or lootmaster being a hunter.
---
Guilds don't *have* to compete on the hard-mode challenges. It's a choice. It doesn't change anything. If they compete on that it's because they want to. So what? How exactly does it affect you?
---
haha watch me
---
No I’m playing Vanilla because I like parts of it. It ain’t a perfect game, and the models are one of my issues. The new models I really enjoy especially Forsaken with tongue physics.
---
Your eyes can only perceive about 37 fps at best. If you disagree, you are either lying, or a fly.
---
Commonplace gaming monitors cap screen refresh at 60Hz.
---
Why would you want 144fps?
---
I remember forum posts claiming GuildWars would kill WoW. It usually devolved into arguments about whether GW was even an MMO.
---
You'll take what you can get. Healers are not in demand anymore.
---
If that was true, then sure give to hunter. But it won't be, because BRE doesn't just drop like candy.
---
The outrage is this: PC gaming fans save up hard earned money to go to this event, often for years. That year they teased Diablo news, and so: many Diablo fans were there. A room full of dedicated pc gamers and fans of Diablo, and they dump a mobile game on them, not to mention frankly insult them. 
---
There is no excuse that can be made to justify it, however much you may (for whatever screwed up reason) wish to defend your corporate overlords, the reality is clear: they screwed up, badly, and need to get shit on for it.
---
That's a paranoid thought honestly. Yes on the top end it will be very rigid. But mid-lower end guilds will focus more on fun, and community. Min maxing has SOME trickle down effects but it won't be as dramatic as you think it will.
---
Actually I’ve never had anything removed. I’m just being a smart ass because I notice everyone complaining about mods removing stuff.
---
There's going to be a fuckton of rogues and warriors in PvP during classic (two of the most over-represented classes). That orc stun resist racial is going to be huge.
---
Warhammer Online, basically all MMOs that came out after 2006 were hyped as wow killers.
---
You have to remember that this subreddit is mostly represented by the most hardcore vanilla fans. The actual game will not have the same ratio of hardcore vs casual as this forum does. I would not worry about being able to raid with off-meta specs and non-minmaxed gear. There will be plenty of guilds out there that will do fine without worrying about all the tiny details of things.
---
Uu'nat is kinda looking like the hardest boss ever at the moment if you look at the number of attempt, so yeah, that's an understatement. It's more like 80+ hours at the moment.
---
I think he’s asking about Pre-Bis coming out at launch Phase 1. People are putting these lists together. StaySafeTV is making Pre-bis list YouTube videos for every class before classic comes out. Only frost mage and Fury warrior are up right now though.
---
No. It will kill the forum too ;)
---
Is this even a thing? It sounds like nothing but hype.
---
If I have time and it's possible, I intend to take 2-5 days off work and become a vegetable. So long as I resume normal life and maintain my responsibilities thereafter I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing for an adult to indulge in.
---
As with other WoW expansions, when they say "release in summer" it means they have until the end, being the 23rd of September, to release it. Don't expect it to be sooner or you'll end up disappointed. If you just assume the 23rd then anything before will be a nice surprise.
---
It's a matter of who can actually use it. Warrior? If you wanna raid as a warrior you use a 1h, either with a shield or another 1h. Arms is trash in pve. Paladin? Okay, sure let's see if that ret paladin does more damage than the hunter in BWL lol. That leaves hunter as the only of 2h sword wielder. It is the only class that is improved by the weapon for PvE.... except ret paladin. But he needs to be a good little boy and put his dress back on to start spamming flash of light.
---
Yeah, and also in my defense I didn't actually play pally in ACTUAL vanilla....I've played it pretty much exclusively since, but in actual vanilla I was a druid.   My only pally in vanilla experience is the last few months on a pserv (though I have raided up through BWL at least as a pally and even scored a BRE for my ret spec on said pserv. :D).
---
Amazon wage cage vs classic gaming throne
---
Gold farming!
---
I truly find it meditative and relaxing to just pick virtual flowers or mine nodes.  The fact that I can go on AH binges afterwards and make a bunch of money is just icing on the cake.
---
The running animations are really what kill me. The new models are definitely better looking, but after being so used to the old models running motions the new ones are very jarring (and bouncy, as you said).
---
Correctamundo.
---
If someone wants to destroy himself, he is free to do so, as long as, in doing so, he does not negatively impact the lives of others.
---
"Freedom" entails the freedom to destroy yourself, if you so desire.
---
Dude that is some excellent story telling your doing to yourself there, but no more.
---
Cheers man. It is just I feel like some people would have adventage over me using it ...and it ruins the game for me..so I have to install it :S
---
unstealthy?
---
I have an appreciation for some low effort and even shit tier memes. But this is just... Bad.
---
Yeah it isnt like they have made the game before, or have a playable version of it right now, or have the entire game's data from the patch they're releasing. Definitely so complicated that there could never be teams of 4 people making private servers supporting thousands of players for free. /s
---
Old shoes it is.
---
Let people play how they want to play.  If you want to play casually and make choices based on what’s fun for you, why can’t others make their choices based on what works best mathematically?
---
So the great thing about classic is that min-maxing was a thing back then to, HOWEVER, if you didn't min max it wan't the end of the world. 
---
You have 20-40 people in a raid, even if a few people do meme specs and such it wont matter much at all. Sure itll lower your DPS out put or your TPS or your HPS but you'll still be able to down bosses. 
---
Until you get to C'Thun / Naxx you'll still be able to clear content with less than 40 people. Sure would it be easier if you min/max... Yeah... But Vanilla was scaled off of shitty computers, terrible latency, and other factors that we wont have today and people still cleared content back then with those shit specs so itll happen here to. 
---
If you can't find a guild because you want to be a boomkin, whelp make your own I guess lol.
---
You hunters are in for a surprise when you see that people realize you don't scale at all in 2019 and aren't giving you prio for any gear that can benefit a melee DPS.
---
What a fantastic human being you must be.
---
Thats how I imagine a typical min/max’er. *grabs popcorn*
---
So weapons grade projectile diarrea
---
Nothing says shitter like any guild running arms warriors
---
People were min/maxing even back in vanilla, it just wasn't as widespread as it is today.
---
What exactly prevents you from ignoring them and play your own game, at your own pace, at your own leisure?
---
Oh, right:
---
# NOTHING :-)
---
&gt;It does absolutely nothing for any class in PvE except hunter.
---
i'm not arguing against that, i'm merely stating it's not bis for hunters at any point in the game.
---
&gt;Dalrend is not better, 1% crit =/= 36 AP.
---
it is ~30 AP at the gear level your in at BWL. And you can dual enchant dal'rends for +30 agi. 2h's can only enchant +25 agi, so that's -5 agi, and besides, the +25 agi enchant won't be added until phase 5, when war effort stuff is added.
---
The reason they are doing mobile Diablo is Chinese $. There is nothing more to it, so not much to say.
---
The new models are garbage, they weren't just given more polygons like they should have done. It was a complete change to the art style and I personally hate it. I've always preferred the old models because of this reason.
---
These threads encapsulate the desperate state of gaming.
---
In 1.12 it started becoming a thing but it was pretty bad.  Power word shield got, I think, 10% of your healing added to its absorption so it's scaling was pretty minimal.  You can't really build around it in 1.12.
---
Also, disc tree was all over the place really.  You can do it but it really doesn't do great in world PvP, PvE healing, or farming/solo PvE.
---
Wooo, 2 seconds head start :P Come on guys you gotta take your time! Dinging early is never good.
---
Haha! Make me think of the doctor in voyager! 5/7 meme
---
What about the leather/Mail wearers considering half your gear as a Fury Warrior will be Leather pre-raid?
---
Everything I said is consistent with both employees working at Blizzard and those that have left the company.
---
I'm not saying that Blizzard is good, or that they haven't done a lot of things wrong, I'm just saying that they didn't force devs off of projects to stick them on mobile apps. There's literally nothing to support that idea.
---
Honestly, even people that started in Wrath should know about threat...especially since when they started playing they probably werent getting into the best groups, or alt runs or whatever where the tanks werent the best/well geared.
---
I definitely remember having to use soulshatter on my warlock, and if you had to  switch targets or something (new stuff spawning) you wouldnt have the option to soulshatter again (3 min CD?).
---
I think it was still a bit of an issue in Cata even, though it was easier for tanks to build enough threat.  Mostly you just had to watch yourself on pull.
---
Min/Max people have always existed and the game will still be fun in spite of them.  Take the time to talk to your groups and guaranteed you'll find friendly people who don't mind taking it slow.
---
😂😂😂 It’s true I remember being in my bachelor apartment not having to worry about shit and playing WoW for 16-18 hours a day sometimes. A lot has changed in my life since then...
---
What if the fury warrior hasn't gotten any good 1h weapons yet?  Wouldn't 2h fury with this be better than say dal rends?
---
It's almost like graphics are a personal preference and a toggle has literally no downsides because everyone can play with what they like. 
---
I agree, I'm not playing classic for the shitty (nostalgic) graphics, I'm playing for the game. And honestly I'll prob just switch back and forth.
---
Oh so everyone has to do something because of how you feel about it.
---
Well I dont like fortnite, I expect them to shut down the servers by the end of the day then.
---
Oh I misread the question. He's asking for the new BIS lists and not if there are different bis lists for each phase =D. Oops
---
OMG does this mean we get the old troll walk and run? Because the new one made me unsubscribe.
---
99% of players wouldn't do it because there's no loot. 
---
It's simply an option that exists.. it doesn't mean you have to take it. It's existence doesn't change other content.
---
&gt; So why not just do that?
---
They can do that, too. That's the beauty of allowing players choices. Players can have more fun doing things they want to do. 
---
I'd even go a step further and not make it a single difficulty increase. Allow for modifiers and a range of settings so you custom build a difficulty. Maybe that would take the pressure off your "perceived normal content-lessening"
---
Ah right. Though we'll be using old models and textures and stuff like that (which affects performance less than lighting and stuff but still). I'd go test my bfa framerate now but that requires being subbed to retail and there's no way I'm doing that.
---
You seem to underestimate or not realize that a lot of them are serious. There’s a reason why a shit load of people are willing to use their vacation days JUST to play the game..
---
I was definitely hoping for all the new visuals in classic. I'm excited for classic because of how the game played not because of nostalgia.
---
Disc is very playable, but it's an incredibly different spec then you're used to in Cata. Disc didn't get their identity as the bubble masters until WotLK, and the whole atonement heal via damage mechanic came much later.
---
Vanilla disc trades the improved healing of holy for generally having more mana and a few bits of useful utility like Imp Inner Fire and Imp Mana Burn. Your 31 point talent PI is great both as a group support skill or as a way to help you occasionally kill off somebody in PvP who is giving you trouble. Disc can somewhat be seen as the pvp healer spec. 
---
However the more common PvP spec is tri spec, going into disc for imp mana burn, shadow for silence, and then holy for holy nova and some nice defensive options there.
---
You're also seeing Disc/shadow as a full support spec bringing both PI and Shadow Weaving to the raid.
---
Oddly enough the closest spec to the heal via dps one is shadow thanks to vamp embrace.
---
Last two AAA games I've bought were red dead redemption 2 and GTA V. 
---
Sooooo many more better quality non AAA games out there
---
yeah man! my favorite music to listen to while studying. also nice for grinding :)
---
Really nice, thanks
---
Pray tell me, oh morally superior being: What's your idea then?
---
Do you want a society where someone can arrest you, and put you in a straightjacket to "protect yo from yourself", because what you are doing isn't meeting his criteria of how you should live your life?
---
Because, what you end up with, if you follow that line of thinking to it's logic conclusion, isn't a society you wanna live in, unless you like wearing uniforms and shouting paroles while waving your arms around.
---
If that is your idea of a perfect society, then boy are we lucky that you don't have any power.
---
I'm in the owl camp here, on n'dale grabbed one at level 10, switched to cat at 40ish, feel pure shit just want her back x
---
Totally agree that the memes and way people are talking about it is really offputting.  I really hope people aren't going to nolife it like it's 2004.
---
+25 agi didnt exist until 1.10
---
Idc about your filthy mongrel horde. 2h are never better for the master race. Dumb people who want a pvp weapon aren't making the progression list, so no gquits.  Strictly numbers based, with every class playing how they are most efficient, this weapon is only a net gain for a hunter in pve. No one else should have it equipped. Also, do you not understand that #runs of BWL after ZG is released is like triple the number of runs before ZG? Of course more warriors will have them, that's why I said wait their goddamn turn lol. This weapon drops, swear to god, every 2 or 3 Nef kills.
---
Oooo the beautiful atlas.. What the hell did i do with mine?? Someone help me pwetty pwease
---
That’s your opinion and to try and force me to use the old models which look like crap to me, to the point I prefer Diablo 2s models, is a complete dick move.
---
Replace title in summer in: My husband’s 11 hour WoW addiction.

Idk when they introduced flying mounts it was a great time saver. But that was only nice after discovering everything.

Going to darkshire, jumping on top of that one building, ganking alliance players

Fishing is not really needed, but it helps. You can just kill beasts for XP, skins and that tender meat.

You have my sword.

Karen just reported your ass to HR.
---
No I am just asking for your opinion that is all
---
To be fair 2h fury is a thing for horde warriors because of windfury totem. It's actually better than dw in some cases.
---
Top horde guild on Lightning's Blade NA had the server first Asskandy drop. Guild used DKP, hunter blew his entire DKP wad on it and won. The guild lost their shit and broke up. Server drams for weeks.
---
It’s gonnnabe late August for sure.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
AND MY ASS
---
oh wait..
---
Arms is ok for PvE too. Fury is just better, so people play that instead. 
---
It is the best weapon for warrior PvP though, and the weapon is the most important item for a warrior, so it's a bit unfair not taking that into account. How much difference does the weapon actually make for a hunter?
---
If you think what they're doing is so easy, then maybe you should apply for the job and show 'em how it's done.
---
Anyone can be an armchair developer spewing all kinds of bullshit about things they have no clue about
---
gdi
---
And yet everyone tells me its all satire and memes.
---
So it is in classic and still relevant? Did you think I was saying this math was considered back when BWL was a fresh raid? That is prehistoric. People were still most in blues and greens and chilling in fire back then. My memory is a bit hazy, but I'm pretty sure the internet didn't exist yet either.
---
&gt; And the reason why "having it toggle-able" is not a good idea is because I want people to see my character as he is
---
Literally nothing could matter less.  You don't get to see other people look at your character.  It doesn't matter at all.  There is 0 drawback to a toggle.
---
Don't let him sneak up behind you bruuuuhhhh
---
Depends on your teammates. If they don't peel it is going to be pulling teeth, if you run with decent group with voice chat and have some people peeling you'll basically never die
---
I was trying to spell "Lebowski" like The Big Lebowski and it turned into "lesboner"
---
Ever noticed how bouncy all the animations are? It looks really sad.
---
goodbye
---
You won't have the globals to be honest, ESPECIALLY in a raid.
---
There is a lot of resentment for the other side respectively. 
---
Truth is people telling others how to play is just that. You are essentially doing the same in your post. 
---
Just ignore it, drama on both sides of that argument. Beauty is it all sorts itself out, just don’t be a prick should be your only worry.
---
Ashkandi is a PvP weapon for Warriors though, except on Horde if you don't DW. For Hunters it is a PvE weapon. IMO raid loot should always be distributed for PvE first.
---
These fucking questions. They were in vanilla so yes. End of.
---
I blame Blizzard for not giving us enough stuff to talk and hype about!
---
It's a goofy dot spec, mostly for massive pvp, or soloing. Demonic sac a voidwalker for hp/tick, along with siphon life you just mass dot everything around you, lifetap for mana.
---
As with every community the issue is likely gonna be with the mid-upper tier (not the actual top end) who are knowledgeable just enough to share unsolicited advice to others and expect them to conform, but not secure enough just to do their thing.
---
Didn't they have sharding in the blizzcon beta?
---
“Who’s ready for a classic summer?” Then sure gives off the wrong message.
---
This is complete nonsense, sorry.
---
A lot of Healpriests were 31 disc. The Infusion buff and bonus mana outshine everything deep holy has to offer, not to mention Divine Spirit.
---
Also something to keep in mind, as mentioned there will likely be a lot of mages running around and in general warlocks fair really well against them in pvp.
---
..which after they get back to their normal lives most likely.
---
also I wouldn't say it's &gt;that&lt; many.
---
Assassins Creed I, II, Brotherhood and Revelations
---
Dueling in Ironforge just outside the bank.  Also using this to polymorph people into old ironforge in the kings room. 
---
I’ll also ever forget climbing into the unknown reaches of loch Modan that eventually landed me at ironforge airport. 
---
Damn those were the best dwarven days of my life..
---
it doesn't benefit the melee in PvE which is all any guild cares about in progression.
---
Here let me try:
---
I have heard some terrible stories of racism from close people in my life. Most have gone through serious trauma. I don't want to see their trauma trivialized by allowing the "okay" emote to exist in [Overwatch League](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/04/05/report-blizzard-forbids-okay-symbol-in-overwatch-league-arena-claims-its-a-white-power-symbol/). It's just a meaningless symbol that can be replaced.
---
Some people think it's alright to have a graphic of an Italian chef making the "okay" symbol on a pizza box. But next time you eat pizza from that box just imagine an innocent slave being whipped.
---
That's incredibly unfair.
---
The red + symbol, which has served as a universal convention for healing, is harmless and has absolutely nothing to do with the suffering, death, and war of life that has existed since before the first human.
---
Thank you for your service but maybe we can invoke the freedoms you are protecting rather than how taking them away could possibly prevent 1 death per year.
---
It also ruined world pvp.
---
It also means the quest text has that information in it - ie the kind of thing someone would tell you if they were actually giving you a task.  A lot of the more recent quest text won't include that info, which is functional cause the indicators and arrows point you in the right direction. But it starts to seem like all the NPCs know that I have a magic Garmin in my brain. Rather immersion-breaking.
---
Yeah but that doesn't have Arya on it.
---
Which will undoubtably be 50% of rogues attempting to name their character
---
As someone else said mages get blink that's about it. All casters are really immobile, (except druid, they are special). 
---
Hunters can move and shoot though.
---

---
Arms is fine for pve in 5 mans, in a raid it’s worse than a many specs because Mortal Strike counts as a high priority debuff (won’t get knocked off by other debuffs) and you really want those debuff slots for other, more valuable, debuffs. As such, you’re essentially not allowed to use Mortal Strike in a raid environment, which is a huge hit to arms dps. 
---
In 5 mans however they do absurd damage with sweeping strikes/etc.
---
Have you seen the running animations? Every character runs like 13yo girl. Do you like 13yo girls? What's wrong with you.
---
Even so, I still see people regularly get lost, not know their way around at all, and screw up the Lyceum on the current big pserv.
---
Don't think so, if you're a raider in retail WoW you wouldn't have an attitude problem with vanilla. You might think it's a slow and boring, but that's a personal preference, not missing a point about something. I like vanilla, but even I think gameplay is pretty damn dull for most classes.
---
Because there are no specs and you can't inspect them to see where they have talent points (at least not without addons, no clue if any are capable either tbh). Warriors with DPS builds are also more than capable of tanking dungeons - hell, people tank Raids without Shields on at this point. 
---
Any Warrior levelling will more than likely be a DPS or hybrid DPS-tank build [like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/A__AgAACPkA), such as my friend who is going Arms/Prot. They still have everything a Prot Warrior has prior to L40 except they do more damage and can level between dungeons solo. After 40 they'll likely spec full Arms because Mortal Strike damage is huge, or full Prot (not likely considering questing is shit as Prot).
---
Shoot auto.  Run into melee and back out before your auto comes back up.  Completely viable on several fights.
---
Because people are deterred from visiting low effort meme subs if they aren’t into it. I stopped coming here more than once a week or so once it turned into the trash that it is now. I’m sure I’m not the only one.
---
Of course it does benefit the melee in PVE if they don't have a better weapon
---
Or play Druid and peel for yourself with a trade of lost healing effectiveness.
---
Healing is high skillcap, you can't just tunnel vision like a Warrior.  Have to work on situational awareness.
---
I never said hunters will get it. In fact I said good luck convincing your guild about it. But it is a fact, that if you are using any form of points system, a hunter should have as much right to bid on ashkandi as anyone else, and not get blocked by "but it's a melee weapon".
---
You can play new modeld in bfa. Fuck off
---
Honestly, this will likely be a dps upgrade for many of your warriors in early progression BWL. Its not like they all got BiS one hand weapons already.
---
For hunters, it is a PvP weapon because 1 handers are also better.
---
No matter what you play will you suck compared to pserver no lifes. Don't let that bring you down.
---
How hard is healer to master in pvp? About as hard as anything else really. Though remember that only paladins and priest actively play as healer roles in pvp.
---
once its finally released, this sub will become a ghost town because people will be actually playing the game instead of memeing on reddit.
---
What's wrong with using vacation days for that? Their entire purpose is to be used when you want some time off. I want time off to play a video game. Is this inherently more wrong than wanting time off just to relax or to travel?
---
min/max will be a minority. Log in, play what you like with who you like, join a fun guild, and you’ll progress just fine.
---
I try not to tell people to play X class, you don't want to pick a class you don't like playing.
---
Ill most likely run healer and mage just hope im somewhat decent so im not totally useless.
---
Regardless of which said you may fall on, you have to admit that there can be a disconnect between players and it can break immersion. Even though a toggle seems like the best options to make everyone happy, when one player doesn't see the other player in the same fashion, it can cause confusion.
---
I remember me and my friends always making fun of the way we would look in same gear but with different races. Like a big Tauren in a robe vs an undead. But if some players see other different, there will be a disconnect between the players and neither will know what the other is talking about. 
---
Honestly, it's not a big deal to me and far from a game breaker, but it does break the immersion when you're really in the moment.
---
It did. This was right around the time I quit though. I can’t tell if that was because the game was starting to suck or my priorities were changing in college.
---
Okay, you guys seem to not be understanding, so I'm going to remove all the extra arguments I've been tacking on. Apparently my memory isn't perfect and I forgot 25 AG was war effort related.
---
&gt; It does absolutely nothing for any class in PvE except hunter
---
That's it. I really never meant it was absolute BiS for hunter. As a weapon, it is BiS ON a hunter.
---
That's excellent.
---
Name one single fight where a hunter can't do this. Just one. Because I can't think of a single one where it would matter at what distance the hunter stays to the target...
---
&gt; Arms is fine for pve in 5 mans, in a raid it’s worse than a many specs because Mortal Strike counts as a high priority debuff (won’t get knocked off by other debuffs) and you really want those debuff slots for other, more valuable, debuffs. As such, you’re essentially not allowed to use Mortal Strike in a raid environment, which is a huge hit to arms dps. (This is looking at 40 man raids, not 20 mans - I’m sure arms is fine in 20 mans as people care less about debuff slots in 20 mans)
---
Isn't that only a problem with an 8 debuff slot limit?
---
I literally played retail till last month.
---
And what’s wrong with you? So pissed off that I enjoy something you don’t like that you make personal attacks?
---
You need to fuck off.
---
Especially since forsaken models lost nothing and gained tongue physics.
---
2h is better horde side bud
---
I don't share that opinion so why should I be forced to use the old models?
---
"Strictly numbers based, with every class playing how they are most efficient, this weapon is only a net gain for a hunter in pve."
---
????
---
You will still have DPS warriors swinging prebis weapons during BWL progression. They also don't have tons of hit gear for dual wield to be really strong yet. This will be an upgrade for PVE for warriors too if that is really your argument. 
---
It doesnt drop every 2 nef kills, that is completely an RNG thing.
---
Not to be Debbie Downer but there has been zero indication that the new models will or will not be in Classic, so you may be "forced" to use the old models by Blizzard themselves.
---
And you can not be a piece of shit, yet here we are.
---
Oh wow that's precious. So trying to get people to stay healthy, responsible and with good relations all around is bad criteria, and leads to being a Nazi?
---
But you also wouldn’t return if there is no content at all...
---
But now u forcing ur opinion..
---
Thinking just Priest not paladin.
---
Good.
---
Good luck convincing anyone here to change their habits. Just focus on yourself man.
---
Sure it does.
---
Im new to WOW in general so im not totally sure what class i actually like playing i guess over time you try many and find the one you like the most.
---
Wasn't aware that Robert Downey Jr. is working for Blizzard.
---
Pretty cool panel though.
---
Ah, thanks for your reply and confirming! :)
---
i see.
---
why is 2h fury considered ok to level with, but nonviable in endgame pve?
---
If every hunter doesn't have a better weapon, they get prio during progression. PvP doesn't matter to raiding focused guilds. After ZG, sure warriors can have it the next 20 times it drops before Naxx. Warriors can also use their R13 weapon, which they better fucking have access to if they want to whine about PVP gear. As other guy said, arms is a big no no in raids.
---
Mods. Please.
---
I understand that, and if they do that I will wait for the mod that does the WoD texture swap.
---
My issue is the people saying I should be forced to use old models for self centered reasons and the dipshits attacking you for preferring new models.
---
Consolidating ignite was purposeful, so no, it should not be fixed.
---
I call that living the dream. I'm hoping to just be able to get a few hours in after work every day.
---
Yea but no one buys your shitty low level greens n such on really low pop servers. Honestly if there's one out there in the 2-3k range that'd be amazing.
---
You're kinda missing the point here... the point is that we all have different opinions about the models, so a toggled option would satisfy the most people. Some people, such as the poster above who is so selfish that they want to rob people of their ideal experience so that they can know that everyone sees their character the "right" way, won't be satisfied. Can't please everyone.
---
What the other person sees on their screen is honestly none of your business. Even back in vanilla, people could use custom character models. This only changed what they saw however. A graphics/model toggle is no different. What's happening on some rando's stream is irrelevant.
---
I want the old models myself, however I have no issue with others toggling to a newer graphic style.
---
To be honest there's not that much difference.
---
A Holy would typically dip 21 points for the spirit buff if they decided to go deep disc or just grab meditation if they were going for a more pure holy build. (It really depends on if you can get your people to use the Lightwell or not as to whether it's worth going that far).
---
However Disc gets basically a single-target bloodlust for casters as a 31 point talent, and can still get pretty much all the important holy talents, which is actually quite a potent tool to have in your back pocket, as you can use it either to boost your own heals during a rough patch of a fight or use it on a mage/lock so they can really pump out the deeps to end a fight quicker.
---
But playstyle-wise it's pretty much the same as holy. You just get your buff/wand/threat/regen talents sooner and your healing talents later. 
---
You end up healing pretty much the same way, just your talent spec looks somewhat mirrored to holy.
---
The problem is that shields aren't very useful. You NEVER shield a warrior under any circumstance (it murders their rage generation). And since they're the tank 99.99% of the time, it's a pretty much useless spell. Situationally useful on a Druid tank, but still not a very high priority.
---
CONFIRMED ! :O
---
There won't be a mod, unless you want to get banned, as such a mod would mess with the game files, which breaks the Terms of Service.
---
I was reading this sub before it was even announced. Yes. I would.
---
Well, paladin and shaman healers are both extremely good healers and rather tanky. Priests have a lot of healing utility and mana regeneration while casting. Druids can shape shift to break roots and cannot be polymorphed while in forms. They also have incredibly good heals over time which other classes lack.
---
There was a great post yesterday about how BFA servers can't support more than like 20-40 people PVPing at a time without the server freezing up and becoming a huge lagfest.
---
This obviously has a huge potential to affect WoW Classic.
---

This happened in the 80's. They came out with "New Coke" and everyone hated it and wanted them to go back to classic.  " Follow-up taste tests revealed most consumers preferred the taste of New Coke to both Coke and [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi)[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola#cite_note-43) but Coca-Cola management was unprepared for the public's [nostalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia) for the old drink, leading to a [backlash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(sociology)). The company gave in to protests and returned to the old formula under the name Coca-Cola Classic, on July 10, 1985. " - Wiki
---
The thing that stands out is the amount of luck that came together to allow Classic to happen. The fact that the art assets had to be found on an offsite backup location, that they worked at all, and that they happened to contain a complete version of what was needed is pretty unbelievable.
---
It's the equivalent of remembering that you worked on a game in your free time 15 years ago, asking around and finding out your parents still have an old computer sitting in the basement somewhere. So, crossing your fingers, you turn it on and it boots! Then you check out the computer and there is tons of data on there, but it's all kind of mess. Then you happen to see the Desktop and notice a folder called "Finished Game" that happens to have the entire game in a working form ready to go.
---
That's almost the complete opposite of how things usually work out. The first thing that goes wrong is that the offsite backups were 'routinely' wiped out years earlier. The next thing that goes wrong is that the backups exist, but are corrupted. After that, the likely scenario is that the backups are missing what you need or have an incomplete/useless version of what you are looking for.
---
Because dual wielding is strictly better. I'm being told perhaps windfury on horde can make 2H fury ok, idk for sure. I have only ever played the faction that bathes and understands basic architecture. Either way, I can't see it being better than dual wield. The number difference alliance side is absolutely insane.
---
Everyone did what they want.
---
You said it yourself.
---
Stop telling people how to play.
---
Yes there is a limit on instances... Thank the hunters farming Mara. I think it was only 5 per hour when it was put in however. I think it was increased in retail not that long ago.
---
Also, true hardcore progression guilds will have players going for rank 14 at this time. That R14 gear will allow them to stomp content. So yes PvP does matter.
---
A I miss the days. Tbh vanilla was like crack for some people. I remember the honest game trailer about wow when he says „No! I‘m not addicted I only played for...OH NOOO!“ (trailer came out after vanilla but you get the point). Everyday there was a news article about how dangerous wow is and stuff. It was one hell of a hype and some people took it too far. What I wanted to say: enjoy classic but don‘t forget about your loved ones and your own ☺️
---
It was pretty bad everywhere. I don't think I made it more than an hour or two in any given zone without some guy randomly one shotting me. It didn't seem to matter where I was.
---
that being said, yes Redridge was horrible. It took me like 30 minutes to just get out of the zone because said pserver doesn't have the OG flight path guards.
---
I agree 100% with you!
---
I finished Odyssey recently and now I'm working my way through Origins.
---
The themes/locations really drew me in. I have no clue what's going on in the modern-day storyline, nor do I care. I just like stabbing people in antiquity.
---
Its not opinion, its using your argument but with actually correct information. Vanilla client had addons. Classic will have addons. As easy as that.

---
Yeah quite a few people have brought that up. I'm a permanent, diehard alliance player. Can you explain some of those cased? The damage difference between 2h and dual wield is insurmountable on our side.
---
Yes you can reset instances in vanilla.  At least in 1.12.1 the command is "/script ResetInstances()" without the quotation marks, or if you're using something like pfUI you can right click your portrait and hit reset instances.  I could be wrong, but I think the limit is 5/hr.  I'm sure someone will correct me if I am wrong.

Only 1 Enhancement at the most will be taken for serious raids.

Karma farming bot post. Top two comments are shills. Mods are letting this sub turn into a dumpster fire.
---
You have the ability to murder people in real life, you have the ability to walk into a 40 man raid alone, what is this point trying to make?
---
There was min/max people back then too. Just wasn’t as prominent as it is today. Regardless, just play the class/race you want and have fun.
---
I guess it might've been broken on the server I played on, my bad. It's still OP
---
Eh if it’s a texture replaced and not a model edit it will be fine.
---
Hell they don’t care about the porn model edits, they just accidentally got hit by warden.

Which funny enough, FF14 has both and no one gets banned

"You don't get to see other people look at your character"
---
This made me laugh out loud - i want to follow the guy and whisper him how great his character looks with the new models for some reason.
---
You are 100% right tho, nothing could matter less. It's like being angry that someone who is colourblind is playing the game because they cants see the character "as he is".
---
They dont stress test with employees or bots, it is a simulated load.  They can determine load values with much greater accuracy by simulating them in house than with a random assortment of public characters coming in and out.
---
People harp way too much on stress tests when they are no longer necessary
---
You're the man! Thank you so much.

I never told anyone how to play in my post.

Really? Forsaken are one of the worst now, the new animations are garbage.

They have to be careful they don't start a perceived mafia.

Anyone remember countless “WOW stands for Waiting On Warhammer” shitposts back in the day.
---
100% disagree. My forsaken look better than ever and the animations are sick on them. Especially with tongue physics. Combined with the new caster animations they are even better.
---
Also notice how I wasn’t the one who brought up animations. I only brought up models and tongue physics. I care more about model toggle than the rest.
---
No, a 16 slot debuff is still incredibly limiting. As he said, MS is a high priority so it will still be knocking off debuffs that actually do things vs it doing absolutely nothing to a boss. Also their raw damage numbers are just bad compared to fury.
---
I never told people how to play. My dislike of the min/max attitude isn't me saying no one should.
---
By the time bwl comes out, your fury warriors should have better dual wield weapons. Ashkandi should go for offspec/PvP
---
In Classic this was referred to as Ignite Rolling. It more or less comes down to timing and spell batching. Wasn’t really raid breaking or a big in the traditional sense, and could barely be duplicated (never purposefully). It was just one of those inevitable occurrences with rolling and having 4-6 mages throwing fireballs and getting crits.  
---
There was a lengthy discussion about it on EJ that broke it down.
---
If you know you're just echoing the same post as everyone else, why not just go and read those threads?

Well that’s weird. Okay, you do you.

Hunter auto-shot has always had different mechanics from casting a spell or shooting a wand or even a warrior/rogue using shoot.

When do you plan on spending time with your wife/family as you work your second job in azeroth?

But you cant do Vanilla gameplay in BfA.
---
The difference here is that the red cross symbol isn’t actually in the public domain like the "okay" symbol; it’s governed by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the misuse or misrepresentation of he red cross is a violation of law.  It's a legal issue not an insensitivity issue.
---
When I started playing in Vanilla I was kid and didn't know about auction house. So way I farmed money was to dive Stranglekelps and sell them to vendor. This is how I actually farmed money for my first lv 40 mount..
---
If I'd just sell those herbs at AH I would probably have money for epic 60 mount already.
---
Elitist jerks existed in vanilla. Min/max culture has always been a thing.
---
TBH WHO had a superiour design than WoW in many aspects. The technical side was so \*bad\* that it died off rather quickly though.
---
Armor always looked the same to me. And aside from female trolls and Tauren there’s not really an immersion breaking change. Femtrolls got multiple purty faces and fem Taurens mouth never closes.
---
Is that only with BRE?
---
Depends a bit om RNG but sure. Should still be treated as a PvP weap not hunter prio cause of some BiS PvE nonsense.
---
Hoping people like yourself who complain about the post don’t click on it just to comment a complaint like you’ve done, there are no other posts that choose between mage/hunter/lock based on gear dependency for PvP aspects, you wasted your own time commenting here but thanks for the input all the same
---
Thanks for the explanation on benefits, wegwacc. Edited my response to be corrected :)
---
&gt; They aren't even the same game anymore.
---
Yeah... I wonder why that might be... ^^/s
---
To stay a bit on-topic and answer your original question though:    
---
On one hand, the matter is pretty simple in that one of Classics purposes is that of recreating vanilla WoW. Vanilla had no multiple difficulties so they also shouldn’t be in Classic.
---
On the other hand – ignoring the whole recreation angle - I think that for quite a few people here the addition of multiple difficulties to raids took away some of what made raiding rewarding.     
---
While gear still is (and has always been) a great motivator for participating in raids, there used to be a special kind of prestige to being able to see places not everyone got to see. 
---
The addition of multiple difficulties in retail WoW lead to an overall decrease of difficulties. What used to be the “normal” difficulty got its harder elements pushed to “heroic”, effectively making normal an easier mode while “heroic” maintained the older difficulty. The introduction of LFR just made the whole thing worse and now there is nothing special about standing in that final boss room anymore.
---
Blizzard tried to bring some of that back when they introduced extra phases for certain final bosses during mythic but it’s just not the same. 
---
Being able to set foot into the temple structure where C’thun resides deep inside the hive-structure that is AQ40 or seeing the upper regions of Naxx was something not many people could experience back in the day and in my opinion it added to the “magic”.
---
Something similar can be said for games like Dark Souls that ship with only one (quite challenging) difficulty mode. Some people say that the addition wouldn’t take away from the experience because “You don’t have to play the easier difficulty if you don’t like”, but besides problems with overall game-balance that additional difficulties would bring, it also would take away that special feeling that makes struggling through that game so damn rewarding. People in the Souls community that made it through those games feel a certain kind of connection to one another (It sounds dramatic, but I can’t think of a better way to describe it) because they all made it through the same kind of experience. An easy mode would take that “bond” away.
---
Personally, if Blizzard ever were to go ahead with some kind of Classic+ project and decided they want to add more difficulties, I’d vastly prefer if they went with the Ulduar model for hard modes rather than Normal/Heroic/Mythic versions of the same raid if they absolutely feel they must.
---
Steam is full of amazing games. Maybe no amazing mmorpgs, but amazing none the less.
---
Factorio, for example is a great game. Hell even some big titles are great. League, Dota, csgo, sc2, rocket league...
---
If you’re only looking at blizzard, Ubisoft, ea, epic—yeah eventually you’ll be disappointed.
---
Ct mod was manditory in vanilla, titan pannel was used by everyone, questie and monkey quest was used by everyone. This post is bad.
---
DPS classes with engi will out damage those without engi because Grenades are used to max dps on aoe packs.
---
We don’t know what the servers names will be yet, to my understanding.
---
What about the downtime running into melee range and then back to 6 or 7 yards for range, then back in, back out etc. If you could range dps from any distance it wouldn't be an issue.
---
I wouldn't use the word "accidentally". They decided to give them a warning, with future action if they continue to use the innocent textures.
---
&gt; That is an activity that we would prefer to respond to with a warning, rather than a suspension, **this time**.

---
Especially in pre-bis/early progression gear, warriors don't have enough crit to reliably refresh flurry. This makes a slow offhand more desirable, as it will eat less flurry charges in a give time period. This is a pretty miniscule difference however, and I honestly just recommend wearing whichever offhand has the best stats. It's a glorified stat stick.
---
All things being equal, or near equal, then slower OH is better early on.
---
I played with people on PvP server some people are going to be really really good, and other just put in the time not the skill. Consider jumping into a sport like Basketball, just because MJ exists dosent mean you shouldn't try.
---
Yeah, IDK what to tell you....I have several toons in the mid 20s and a 60 pally that's raided up through BWL and this wasn't my experience.  My wife has TWO 60s (warrior and mage) and this wasn't her experience.
---
It looks fucking cool, therefore it must be BiS.
---
Farm arcain crystals.
---
This was me during vanilla...
---
Well if this hypothetical raider thinks Vanilla is slow and boring and doesn’t want to play Classic, then no - their attitude isn’t a problem; they want to play Retail and, as you say, that’s their preference.
---
But if they wanted to try Classic out with the goal of enjoying it, then their attitude towards the speed of the game (namely: that it’s boring) would be a problem and, crucially, they would be missing the point. 
---
But the fact that they’re missing the point doesn’t make them an idiot or anything - it’s not an insult - it simply means they have a different preference. 
---
Do you understand what I’m saying?
---
becoming?
---
Son I've been unhinged since 2004.
---
I would since they unbanned everyone and then said it’s a warning. If they really have a shit they would have left them banned.
---
BRE is an outlier due to the proc. This does not apply to asscandy. Even then, I'm pretty sure dw fury still pulls ahead
---
Meanwhile really no other game or mmo killed WoW, but only WoW killed itself and has to be reborn again.. and here we are
---
My GF with whom I live together isn't going to be happy about that balance though...
---
In the beginning you might have problems sustaining rest exp, but it should get easier over time.
---
It takes about 10 days logged out at an inn or capital city to get full rested expierence for 1.5 levels, and it takes anywhere from 1 to many many hours to burn through all of it, depending on what level you are at the time.
---
I leveled a hunter on the weekends on Nostalrius to about 48 lvl before it got shut down on pretty much entirely through rested expierence and I did a lot more grinding than usual, but I still found it worth doing some of the quests for item rewards and additional exp boost from completing quests on the mobs I'm killing anyway.  Exclusively grinding doesn't help upgrade your gear too often.
---
He is talking about progression guilds. Melee will not be able to use it. Because ret are not a thing, warriors are 1h fury speced. Only hunters can equip it. He is right, even if they have worse weapons, no melee can use this in PvE.
---
Uhhh.... I never said arms warriors. 2H fury exists. So does PvP.
---
Literally nobody here has done that.
---
&gt;That's it. I really never meant it was absolute BiS for hunter. As a weapon, it is BiS ON a hunter.
---
ok, but to be fair that's you misunderstanding the definition of "bis", when people say bis they are always talking about absolute bis for a specific class. Not what weapon is most useful in pve on what class.
---
Yeah just go to bed. I don’t have to be there
---
BWL is phase 3, ZG is phase 4. Different content phases, different BiS.
---
All it really needs it something to amputate your legs to prevent those blood clots from reaching your lungs.
---
Also ironically last private server the top guild had arms warriors during MC progression bc they were ranking at same time and MC is easy af.
---
You would think, huh? But private servers have been using Vanilla for years and people still play. 
---
Personally, I’m with you in that I would love to see them release the content that they couldn’t squeeze in the first time. But I think that would have to be on its own server. Any messing with Vanilla will have people who want JUST the original very upset (and rightfully so), unless they leave some pure Vanilla servers up. Honestly, if Blizzard gets this right, they can have a revenue stream that lasts a very long time.
---
I definitely did not like any of the new models, but it feels dumb to play new content with old models, so I can’t wait to only be able to use old models
---
Love the appropriately and intentionally positioned watch. Good touch
---
I actually managed to full clear that zone on three different toons and only get killed by that jackass like once.  I honestly have no idea how and considered myself very lucky.  I definitely got killed/camped by others some though.
---
It's implied
---
You literally just said that people who min/max will ruin the game, in the title of your post.
---
Certainly in the shortterm and with a few of the huge high end weapons (even on alliance side with obsidian greatsword), but dual wield wins out eventually on either side side, especially if you're making sure to keep the relevant armor debuffs up. Generally every two hander should be considered a pvp weapon.
---
You can't exactly use BRE and Ashkandi at the same time in vanilla now though, can you...
---
I know BRE is BiS. I don't have numbers to hand for other weapons though.
---
Oh I see, that's probably good practice.
---
Lol, this was actually an article?!? I was in my late 20's when Vanilla came out. My girlfriend, at the time, and I were winding down our 2 year relationship and we thankfully went our separate ways in the first 2 months of live. After that, my God 11 hour days was the minimum. I had a normal 40 hour a week job with weekends off and all I did was play WoW and there were plenty others in the guild I was in that were the same
---
That would be a Trademark.
---
We are 1% or less of the playerbase if you want to play anmeme spec play one. No ones going to tell you how to play. However in that same vein don’t blame min makers when you choose to play subopimal specs and they are trying to get stuff done in an efficient manner. You always have the choice of running your own casual friendly meme spec clan.
---
Hey man, it ain't my account. If you're willing to risk your account, all the power to you. It wouldn't be my time going down the drain. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
There is 1 R14 a week. Honor system doesn't even drop until phase 2 my guy. Phase 3 is BWL. So out of all the guild you seem to expect to compete for R14, with maybe a total of 12 weeks or so to rank, you think progression guilds will have a bunch of R14 in BWL? You think the other 10 competing top guilds aren't going to snipe weeks away? At best they will mostly have R13. What do you get at R13? A comparable weapon to Akshandi? Oh look at that. Your problem solved itself.
---
Ragnaros, to start. Shazzrah. Baron Geddon. And that is just MC.
---
But lots of hunters gain uniqueness. You saw what happened on pservers pre Bwl? Every hunter had a lupos.
---
I have faith you’ll be ready by Launch 
---
Can’t wait for this game , I don’t think I’ve been this hyped for a game 
---
I know it’s a re release but I wasn’t able to play at Launch like most people back in the day since I didn’t have a computer and my parents scoffed at me when I asked them to buy me a game that needed a monthly subscription on top of the game itself
---
Pretty confident I've decided on a human rogue.
---
What are the main challenges / annoyances I'll face?
---
The same armor is drastically different between races, Tauren vs Gnome, the models are so largely different that the same piece gear is drastically different.
---
The comparison above is to be applied to the "buff" human models vs the original skinny models. So even the same armor may appear different in the way that a new char model may say "My muscle really look great in this gear" vs the older model char saying "What muscles, are you crazy?"
---
Regardless of which you prefer, this the fact of the matter. Is it a big deal or game breaking? Not to me but at least I can see that there is clearly a difference.
---
Don’t think there are. You should be able to level without selling stuff though
---
If classic is successful enough that blizzard can commit the resources toward relaunching BC as well, I'd rather they start developing their new content with the same design philosophies that that had back in the day.
---
Every Release Date post delays the announcement by 1 hour
---
&gt; rele ass-date
---
I don't know how hard it is to master healer in PvP, but if you plan on rolling either priest or paladin then all I can say is, as a warrior, I absolutely LOVE when healers spam dispel on me.  
---
I mean obviously you gotta throw some heals and stuff too but as long as you keep dispelling, you should be good imo.
---
2h Fury is fine early on, especially when you're limited on hit gear. Obsidian Edged Blade itself can last some time. But the strength of some of the weapons available for dual wielding post-MC combined with having more hit available make it fade away decently fast.
---
\*FATALITY\*
---
They aren't making the BWL list if they don't have good dual wielding weapons. They had phase 1 and 2 to gear. Not a single fucking warrior that cares about raiding is going to benefit from switching to a 2H. Stop responding to the same comment so many times.
---
Killing frost mages as a warrior. Yeh chances are I’ll lose 70% of fights but it’s still fun to win those other 30%.
---
In reality, modern WoW = WoW 2. Completely different games at this point
---
&gt; I looked it up and no, you get +25 agility from the same furbolg vendor as 15 agility. If you mean war effort patch, then loot tables are absolutely going to include it still. Blizzard confirmed that.
---
this is wrong, they are witholding all items that were added in a later patch, until their respective phases. It's items that were there from launch but got changed in later patches that will have their 1.12 state from the get go, that's it. However, even if this didn't apply to the +25 agi enchant, it doesn't change the fact that dal'rends is still better than ashkandi with +30 agi enchant on them
---
Well, if you like starting your raids 30 minutes earlier and then having to constantly keep them farmed during raids for the bosses, then I guess “it’s not that bad”, for you.
---
It's not really progression BWL anymore if you're deciding who gets an Ashkandi, eh?
---
Ha, yes, or better, My dad's 11 hour a day addiction.
---
Side by side with the original with "2004" "2019" in caption.
---
Seeing as they did not mark Classic as a "major release", I do not anticipate a box release or any marketing except maybe internet ads. No TV ads or the like.
---
What this would mean is they do not need an official release date months in advance like they do with "major" releases, as the time required to produce TV ads and boxes will not be there.
---
Those hotpockets are just sitting in an open air container. No wau they’re going to last for 30 days

It's a nice job that takes only 2-3 hours.

Druid or Rogue
---
I have been playing a private server and am leveling a Druid. I love healing in retail as Druid in both pvp and pve. I hear bad things about druids other than resto is meh and in TBC I played a rogue. I enjoy the sneakiness which is why Druid or rogue but I am not sure if the nostalgic feeling of rogue will outweigh my love for resto Druid healing.  Persuade me to do one over the other please!
---
Look, I think classic is going to be pretty big. I dunno how big, but I'm definitely gonna screenshot this particular comment right here for if it ever blows up massively.
---
I saw blizzard is not attending e3 this year
---
Alright I just ran around Durotar for a bit. I should point out that I'm running 2 monitors and the one I'm running WoW on is 1440p, I'm also running stuff like Kittens Game in the background right now. I cranked everything to max (which I wouldn't actually do on retail because some things just eat performance while making the game *barely* look any better). I'm getting about 80 fps. 
---
Now I tried reducing just a few settings, literally only changed 4 things. Shadows from Ultra High to High, Liquid Detail Ultra to Good, SSAO Ultra to High, disabled Depth Effects because I hate that shit. I'm getting around 110 fps.
---
I imagine getting 144 fps will be really easy by just reducing a few more settings since setting some things to max just eats fps and doesn't look noticeably better unless you squint really hard.
---
And what if someone disagrees with you? What if someone wants to become a whale lumping in front of a computer?
---
What do you do then? Shout at him? Organise an intervention? Hit im until he gets up? If so, then yes, the end of that path is Fascism.
---
Or do you do nothing? Then what's the point of you obsessing over other peoples life choices?
---
------
---
Bottom line:  
---
What other people do with their life, as long as what they do is legal, is none of your business. You can live your life the way you want to. And if you want to be seen as a decent human being, you extend others the same f\+n courtesy.
---
'the most efficient PvP druid spec'
---
Top comment: possibly the worst spec ever
---
I love this thread already 😂lots of good insight though, some one mentioned stormx, that would be a good start/end point I think.
---
I think Wildstar fell into there somewhere also.
---
What’s up! I still talk to Antisnow. Lost track of everyone else over the years.
---
Quest/Grid is and always will be the fastest.
---
As quests are pretty much always faster. 
---
The only exception is that in a few places, the travel time hurts you enough where grinding out a couple level is overall faster than travelling there and doing the quests. (hence why Quest/Grind is the fastest).
---
Since questing by itself tends to include a lot of grinding, you just get an extra big pay out of xp at the end. And on the other hand, you can get massive payouts for taking out a single enemy for a quest or spending a minute picking up a couple items (which would take 20+ minutes of grinding to equal).
---
However this does imply you have a good quest order to minimize empty backtracking (i.e. you always want to be working towards completing a quest no matter which direction you go, as much as possible, and if not, grinding a bit here and there along the time way as long as killing the enemies quick enough to be worth while).
---
You play your way I’ll play my way while meeting all my social and work obligations. K thx bye.
---
Is it possible to add search function for items with procs and equip bonuses? Like f.ex. http://itemization.info/item/14541 and http://itemization.info/item/12628
---
Ahh, so it's a trinket you mostly use on trash. Still, it competes with nax trinkets, and the rest of the stuff is meh, so take it
---
I didnt say it was easy. I said unpaid lesser resourced people do it faster. Which I'm not wrong about. I'm not implying I know coding or any developer skills.
---
They still beat hunters im DPS with prebis gear vs MC geared hunter lol. Sure they will be on the list, you cant guarantee all your melee get raid weapon drops.
---
It still wasn't me telling them how to play. I never said not to min/max. I think people putting too much weight on that is bad. They may think someone not putting weight on it is bad.
---
&gt; and they walk too bouncy
---
I feel like it's an issue with almost every race after rework. They all jump around like some kind of Disney cartoon character.
---
Arms is definitely not trash in PvE. It’s the best build up until you’re farming Nef. I PvE raised naxx as arms (with Ashkandi) and could top DPS. Yes fury outclasses eventually but it’s by no means “trash.”
---
I'd rather have low effort low quality posts than no posts at all.
---
Mind Control. Levitate fishing
---
Yea, like I said , they will be working on ranking at this time....
---
Horde side no
---
Magmadar too in MC, and arguably golemagg, and luci to avoid his dots
---
2H fury is a spec lol.
---
i loled :D
---
Yep. A lot of people amass an intellectual inventory of the "right" and "wrong" ways to play a game, and then parade around the internet clubbing people with it in order to feel a jolt of self satisfaction.
---
"Hey so I know you warriors want this weapon that is bis for pvp for the whole game, but we're going to give it to a hunter so it's slightly better than other things he can have for pve, the part of the game where damage is hardly relevant to finishing raids."
---
Saying this is PC gaming’s last chance is a little extreme. Maybe you’re just playing games you don’t like? I’ve been having a ton of fun with Magic Arena without paying a dime for it. Just don’t play a game if you don’t like it.
---
You’ll be fine.
---
Those words were specifically said but its the summarization of your post.
---
Not me; I am so ready. To relive Classic's launch, with knowing what I know now? I'll be able to enjoy it that much more.
---
Eyes of the Beast to mess with the newbies
---
Don't ever let being new to something stop you from doing it, no matter what it is. Get out there, suck at it, learn, get better, and enjoy it.
---

Little known fact. Every single item in the game is BiS for hunters.

---
Art assets are stored in the client, which was always available even to public. Since they changed the file system in MoP they have tools to convert old assets for the new engine. Server side I never bought in on their story of "what a surprise we just found the old database right at the time of a very big petition and the Nost debacle.". Blizzard is a multi billion $ company, they always have backups of everything. Since you can buy their stocks I'm pretty sure they are legally obligated so save everything.
---
It's amazing they finally do it though and they have very passionated people for the job. Game is in good hands.
---
It matters for people who care how they look in the eyes of others. They want to look exactly a certain way. I don't say that it's good or bad, you can have your right to have any kind of opinion. Also onesided Transmog exists, people who think the opposite actually use model swapping add-ons to switch the race, like, switch Dwarf rogue model to Undead rogue.

If memory serves me correctly there are three items in the game that offer +skill to daggers. Two armor pieces and one dagger. Will update this post later when I remember. There’s always that :D

---
Oft known fact, every single item in the game gets denied to hunters
---
&gt;I've been reading in threads and post here and I see the same thing over and over again. Posters telling others how the spec they want to play isn't viable , how they won't get invites if they aren't the right spec, and how they need to be the best class/race combo or forget about endgame. 
---
I think people are giving warning in most cases as to what they have seen, and people who don't agree with their opinion lose their absolute shit. No one is requiring you or even really gives a fuck if you do play optimally... People are saying hey these spec are not really represented in P server communities, maybe you should look for another if you don't want to get left behind.
---
&gt; This isn't the classic I played. Everyone did whatever they want and people had fun and succeeded. You didn't rush to wowhead or thotbot after every drop to see if it was BiS. You played and had fun. 
---
People were checking this stuff in classic, people did not do w/e they wanted and succeeded (rose tinted glasses are one thing). If trying to excel in something is what makes it fun for a load of people who are you to tell them it isn't, it is literally gate-keeping fun...  If people trying to be good themselves ruin the game for you, then you have the problem not that person. 
---
&gt; I fear this attitude I see here is going to make Classic feel like retail does with ilevel. I hope I'm wrong. 
---
I don't fear an attitude at all, people still play like to compete competitively even in an easier game (which I think is a product of people who have spite for "min/maxers") and people in retail still want handouts and also call those people "elitist and min/maxers" disdainfully.
---
Ass and sword! Uh...
---
They’re probably too busy updating their own builds at the moment
---
Lmao.  Nope. I correctly summarized your shitty post.  Try to communicate better if you didnt mean that.
---
Yep, game was not good.  Too generic.
---
There are plenty of fights where you don't really have the luxury of standing at the optimal ~5 yard range for this to be seen as a regular strat. Try this on Sartura and you're going to get dabbed on hard.
---
If you open the floodgates to allow a trickle of water, the trickle quickly becomes a tital wave.
---
Allowing for some craziness makes the entire sub insane.
---
It has far more to do with server programming than server hardware. The servers will be set up entirely differently for Classic. I'm not going to pretend like I have a wealth of knowledge about server architecture, but I have friends who do. They tried to explain it to me, but the average person just doesn't have the baseline knowledge of server architecture to understand, myself included.
---
You're not forced to. You can continue playing with the new models on retail.
---
Also Black Desert Online, although a bit more newschool
---
But it is bind on pickup, right? So you gotta craft it yourself
---
He gave you his, it was that your opinion was equivalent to this other bad opinion.
---
If I played 3 hours a day and wanted time to eat/play with my kid and some time with my partner then I'd need to play to midnight on weeknights and get about 6 hours sleep and that's without ever going to bed at the same time as her.
---
5 hours on the weekend would mean I'd wouldn't be able to arrange anything to do with family and have to start playing before my son wakes up or directly after he sleeps at 7 - again making my partner to go to bed alone.
---
I agree it's a very fun job that takes only 2-3 hours, but I wonder how people have so much free time that they can start a new 25 hour a week hobby without it impacting time with their family.
---
An addition is a change.
---
EMM CEE RAIDERZ, WE AIN'T GOT NO LYFE!
---
there is no way they don't let you do this, it will probably be default classic and an option to use new models
---
i'm going to use the vanilla models but i doubt they would miss out on this
---
This may not work this way on actual classic is the problem here
---
Psh. That requires fresh air. Can’t min/max my vanilla experience that way!
---
Thats the thing... there is no downtime if you do it correctly. You have 3 seconds between autoshots, thats enough.
---
&gt;try and force me
---
lol over here acting like you're being repressed or some shit. Can't understand why some people won't want others to see them as a rejected dreamworks character
---
I guess discussion is forbidden, its all about memes and nostalgia baits..
---
my parents once showed me an article like (maybe even this exact one who knows) and i remember saying to them "he is what we would call a noob" lol
---
&gt; Your mentality of playing a spec is incorrect when discussing classic. 
---
Lack of sleep, I guess.
---
WTF
---
Oh gee I dont know...only most of the fights in MC alone have some type of debuff or damage that affects mostly people in melee range. Mag, Geddon, Shazz, Ghenas, Golemag, Garr,Rag.  Try a melee rotation while you have magma shackles, fear, or fire dots on you. 🙄
---
I already posted about this in this thread but just in case it gets missed:
---
Yesterday someone made a post about how retail servers freeze up and break down into a total lag nightmare whenever more than 20-40 people PvP within an area. Since WoW Classic is being based on the BFA client, this obviously has some serious negative consequences for WoW Classic.
---
This thread was deleted. Why? 
---
Like yeah I know the reason was "unrelated to WoW Classic" but it's a thread literally about a limitation of the same client/network infrastructure that WoW Classic will be running on. It's super related to WoW Classic and a valid concern for players to have.
---
Thread deletions like that *really* need better explanations.
---
Summary of my post would be "This person feels min/max is bad". Not "This person says no one should min/max". My communication is fine. You might want to work on your comprehension.
---
Paladins in your raid too slow to BoP then. (and if you're playing Horde, shame on you.)
---
I feel like 30 days food won't be enough, unless you can have a technician come and refill it ofc.
---
Kinda obvious addons are imminent. They wouldn't have given us an idea of how they were planning on liming what addons could do if they weren't fully intended to be in classic.
---
I've actually clocked in over 2k hours in rocket league lol. That's the only game I play other than WoW. But yes I do agree, there are a ton of great games out there that are overlooked, however nothing has really grasped my interest other than RL and unofficial classic servers.
---
I don't really care, I'll take whatever models they decide on. If they decide that newer models are easier to work with and easier to animate and bug fix, clipping, etc. Then go for it.
---
Hmm, what would you say to going mining and tailoring and then proceed to drop mining instead of tailoring for engineering for bloodvine later on?
---
Same. I'll just mod it so I can look at pretty models
---
Okay maybe but at least let us have that discussion.
---
&gt;You see people always talk about the hunter 8 yard dead zone - which quite frankly is a lie. Your dead zone are 3 yards. 5 yards is your melee range and that's the entire point behind this post.  
---
&gt;Instead of sitting back on range and idling half of your 10 sec rotation because you have no ranged skills to fire. You will be standing at 8 yards range behind the boss, close to the melee dps. You will get all the buffs your melees receive. You will down all the potions they consume and you will add 2 melee swings to each and every of your 10 second rotations because doing so will increase your raid dps between 80 to 170+ dps

---
Someone would spec Disc Priest as a PvP spec and the shields are useful there, and still plenty good to PvE heal with as well. Or you could always shield someone else in your group/raid as a life saving tool if they took a lot of damage for some reason.
---
It's like saying BoP is bad in Retail WoW because Pallies can't use it on tanks (for the same reason vanilla Priests didn't want to use bubble on tanks). BoP is still incredibly valuable to Retail Pallies just as improved Shield will be useful for vanilla Priests.

I'm 35 with a 5year old and another due the last week of August. Been playing private servers off and on since classic was announced and I would wait till my kid was in bed, and then play from about 8-12 each night. I play on a laptop with an oversized lap desk reclined on my couch. My wife and I would watch a movie while I grinded levels. Once I was raiding I only really raided 2-3x a week during the same time frame
---
On the other hand, they could just make it a toggle and allow everyone who doesn't want the new models to use the old ones. Where is the harm in allowing people to use the new ones if they want? They could even make the old models the default option. In fact, I think they *should* make it the default option, but allow people to opt in to the updated models if they prefer them. Where's the harm in that?
---
That  Lady Gaga Alejandro song.
---
You're literally telling people they're ruining the game, and then you're trying to split hairs by going "well I didn't say you shouldn't"? Come on dude.
---
Hmm so you are going to keep tailoring through all of the phases? I might do that as well, ty
---
Several people have told you what I have.  Its you.  Now shoo.
---
Also CD Projekt Red make great games with no looboxes and value for money dlc.
---
So after bloodvine tailoring doesn't give any bis anymore, meaning i could drop it(from a minmax perspective)?
---
Aftermath right? Haha I remember that.. Aedak was not happy
---
CD Projekt Red make some fantastic games without lootboxes .
---
Yeah, not exactly easy or reliable to farm. It's easier to just get a raid dagger. I saw a single felstriker drop all of vanilla, and I wasn't even there for it.

So 2h arms dps is not trash. With proper gearing and play you can pretty handily beat most other classes, and stay well above the median. Until late bwl/zg/aq fury doesn't actually destroy 2h dps. The first two phases, really good 2h wars will keep up with fury, and far surpass hunters.
---
Actually im pretty sure a 2h pve warrior will always outdps a hunter, regardless of phase given similar gear levels. Bre is probably better for dps for 2h war but ash is very powerful if you can't get one. And the dps increase from anything(not bre) -&gt; ash is going to be more dps than a hunter gains of 2...
---
For PVE, the difference is basically: Do you want slightly bigger heals, go Holy. Do you want the Power Infusion spell, go Discipline.
---
For PVP, Discipline is more offensive oriented and Holy is more defensive oriented.
---
There is nothing wrong with going for either spec, it's just a matter of personal preference.
---
Lack of sleep makes me a shittier person and perform badly at work, I envy people who can function normally on 6 hours. Id still miss going to bed with my partner tho.
---
Do you want Vanilla WoW, or Vanilla WoW modified to your tastes? We can't cater to everyone. Also no one's forcing you to play a game AS IT IS. You're acting like new models were already a part of it and the devs took them away.
---
New models = New game
---
Old models = Old game
---
This is a reasonable complaint. I wasn't involved with that specific post removal, so I'll need to go find it to see what's going on specifically, but usually, we try and explain removal (or if we don't explain in detail, if you send a ModMail, we'll usually reply with more explanation). I think communication is one of the more important aspects of running a subreddit, but sometimes, we get busy and things fall through the crack - I make this mistake, too, especially if I'm removing posts while on my phone but forget to go back and give an explanation when I get back to a desktop.
---
Why would you not just go MS spec in this instance, you gain sword spec, and MS which will out dps bloodthirst early on. Also sweeping strikes is very useful.
---
That is not true at all, the game is MMO, not singleplayer. If he won´t play the optimal thing, he won´t be accepted to raid. You can play your own game while leveling. After that, no. Not if you want to have gear and progress.

And then there's me, who has dreams of doing a full blackrock mountain clear in one sitting once bwl is out lol

You played there too? I was in Orgrimar on a bank alt when that shit hit the fan. I called my buddy who also played on LB as a troll priest &amp; troll warrior and it was crazy. I mean, now we know it's kinda a bis Hunter Weapon but back then the only gear hunters had as prio were ranged weapons.

To be clear, we did not remove this post, the OP removed it themselves.

No I’m not. People are saying they want players to not have the option for self centered reasons. I’m calling that out as self centered and being an asshole. So yea they DO wanna force me to use old models. And no I’m not acting like that.

FYI your post was auto-removed because it is a text-post that doesn't have any text in the post's body. Title-only text posts, or text-posts with less than roughly a tweet's length of characters, are auto-removed.

---
I already game on the computer at night after the kids go to bed. I’ll just play wow instead.
---
Not sure if you've played Retail WoW but there when you pick a spec, you are locked out of abilities that other specs have, and you are given abilities specific to the specialization you chose. You're essentially picking a sub-class - complete with it's own set of passives different from other specs. You also get a talent tree that again, is specific to your specialization. It's an entirely different playstyle and set of abilities.
---
Whereas in Classic WoW, Priests are all the same and talents give you some extra flavor to help the playstyle lean in one direction or another, but it's not a completely different class.
---
whenever people call fortnite the most addicting game, oh boy my gaming sessions in wow were not measured in hours.. they were measured in days!

Lmao.  You aren't even good at being a troll.

Can someone explain to me what this post is about?

ROCKET LEAGUE FTW
---
it's really not.
---
The issue is that the mana to damage prevented ratio is crappier than any healing spells healing to mana ratio. This wasn't changed until TBC and even in TBC it was still only worth using for say jumping on bombs in BF or similar mechanics.
---
It's much just more efficient to simply heal the damage than to prevent it. Outside of a few situational things like Flag running or knowing a big hit is going to come out that might outright one-shot the tank (though that's a disaster waiting to happen having a tank that weak). Since the mobility sometimes works in your favor, but it's still got a long ability CD, and costs a fortune relative to it's actual effect.

Paid character renaming was in vanilla. #nochanges
---
man, having a loved one to re-experience Vanilla WoW with would be amazing
---
Interesting. I might do that.
---
Yeah +AP is both melee/ranged. But if a buff or item specifies then it only does that one.
---
I disagree actually. I didn't play spellcaster or know it well so I cant comment on Boomkin. However Ret and Feral where both worked well. They both added enough damage via party buffs to offset their lower DPS. For example the world first Brutallus had a Ret Paladin and that was the DPS check of BC. The actual main problem is that you only had room for 2 supports in a melee party so you couldn't take Ret, Feral, and Enhancement you had to pick 2. In 10 or 5 man content was where they had more struggles.
---
Ok give it to a hunter and watch all your core DPS warriors quit the guild, resulting in an overall net negative to PVE DPS
---
Fast off hands use more flurry charges, but also generate more hits overall, which can crit. I'm not 100% sure either way...
---
No matter what game you play they will exist, they have always existed, they didn't ruin the game before, I don't see them ruining it now. Beauty of MMORPG's, there's many players with different playstyles, personalities, and philosophies. Eventually you'll find yourself among your kind.
---
I think gw2 is fun to jump in to still, but it doesn't have the ability to retain player's outside events

You 100% were thinking of Surge on Burning Blade. I played on that server and they were the only guild that cleared Naxx. Like they literally owned the server.

reads like you want to play a druid - i'd say go for it  
---
you clearly like druid healing and other people will like you for it, so thats great. You still get to be sneaky. Worst comes to worst, you can always go feral which should scratch that rogue type itch if it comes up. Can't really switch it up with rogue like that.
---
For PvP it is just as BiS for Hunters as it is for Warriors. If you look at it from a purely objective standpoint. I neither play Hunter nor Warrior.
---
But the argument for Warrior is that they really would like to have it for PvP and for the Hunter it is an actual raiding upgrade. I don't really care but objectively it should go to the Hunter then. Culturally to the Warrior.
---
This isn't actually true unless you have late bwl gear already. Arms with bre competes with rogue/fwar in phase 1/2 and early 3
---
CHT unique tho
---
wf is better with 2H, and wf proc with 2H gives you a lot more rage. and 2H is always better for trash.
---
but its only viable for non orcs without edgemasters or when loot is scarce.
---
bre can be BiS for non orcs even if they have edgemasters (until KT 1h swords), but that depends on actual boss armor numbers and glancing blow implementation which so far is not really truly blizzlike anywhere I believe.
---
Ah Wildstar.. so much wasted potential in that one :( R.I.P
---
Generally speaking, healing gear is available for all three healing classes with priority on some pieces being given to certain classes a small part of the time. Here are some examples of cloth / leather pieces that are great for every healing class that paladins generally have an equal opportunity to get.
---
Wild Growth Spaulders from Majordomo in Molten Core are insane. Leather shoulders that are best in slot for Druid / Shaman / Paladin until tier 3. In high demand by all classes, but generally speaking no class has 100% dibs on them. Maybe one or two people get the first ones due to guild politics. The same goes with Boots of Pure Thought from trash in BWL - best for every class. Cloth boots, but everybody gets 'em. Some items do have a "class first" kind of structure. For example, Paladins can't use staves or use spirit very well, so in some cases, Paladins have priority on maces and certain pieces of gear with mp5 gear.

The gear Paladins (and most classes) wear for PvP is different than what they wear for PvE. You'll use different pieces for the most part.
---
As for good +healing plate, Gallant's Wristguards from DM North are a great example of +healing plate gear from a boss that's 2-man farmable in like 5 minutes. These, along with Loomguard Armbraces from Scholo (mail), are the best you can get until the bracers from Twin Emps near the end of AQ40, which are also the best option available to the healing classes.

The issue with hunters is that they are the bottom   of dps most of the time and if they didnt have tranq shot there would be like 2 hunters max allowed in a raid.

Twin Blades of Hakkari were better for Hunter PvE

&gt;Not sure if you've played Retail WoW but there when you pick a spec, you are locked out of abilities that other specs have, and you are given abilities specific to the specialization you chose. You're essentially picking a sub-class - complete with it's own set of passives different from other specs. You also get a talent tree that again, is specific to your specialization. It's an entirely different playstyle and set of abilities.
---
Yep ik all of that, op did int explain this was op's way of thinking either you both have just seemed to assume so. I just don't think insulting how a person thinks and calling it incorrect is helpful when you don't know what they were thinking. 
---
&gt; There’s literally no difference in disc and holy aside from getting slightly altered stats and a couple abilities.  - Previous poster

&gt; Whereas in Classic WoW, Priests are all the same and talents give you some extra flavor to help the playstyle lean in one direction or another  - You

Sounds exactly why you might decide for against one another
---
I still dont get it. 500 people in northshore abbey is not fun. The end. I dont see how people are so upset about this. Waiting 30 min per kill is not the vanilla experience either. It's to get through the initial rush. If they keep it going, we can all get upset later.
---
I have freedom I have the freedom to smoke a shit ton of weed and play wow and I have the freedom to do that and for others around me to not give a shit so mind your own business man
---
It does, and I don't disagree, but PR speak =/= Legal speak. Classic Summer will still be Classic in Summer as long as it's released in Summer (up until 23rd September as I said).
---
Paladins are very straight forward in pvp/pve, skillcap is decently high, but to learn to handle the class and be ok at it, is not hard.
---
For me, that's the only one that really had a chance to do it, but it was so insanely buggy that I lost interest.

You are right but the truth is, half of the people in this sub won´t be affected at all. I mean, they are already basement-dwelling neckbeards. There are people who take it seriously and play only when they have time for gaming. Others view it as their life. But I am fine with that. More power to me in real life if there are literally ten-thousands of people out there sitting in front of a computer and playing a single game for 10+ hours a day for months. If they choose to ruin their life, that´s not your problem. If they die because of a Heart-attack, thrombosis, get a stroke or something, their blood will not be on your hands. Let them do what they want to do with their life and you do something more useful with yours.

This just isn't true. Good arms warriors smash hunters through the first 4 phases for sure. But probably the entirety of vanilla. Yeah arms do less than fwar, but it is much more skill dependent than people think and it's very easy to be bad just like hunter...
---
Idk, but I remember in high school I thought one day I'd play WoW with my kids.  Then years later Cataclysm happened and I realized what a silly thing to think.  Now.. I probably will play WoW with my kids.

Agreed. It should be free to copy characters over. And of course they retain any mounts/legendaries that were only available early in classic.

These are the altered/short versions not the vanilla ones as far as I can see.

Bug, or feature? Rolling ignite was just a mechanic in 1.12, so look forward to that once you can finally spec fire.

Yeah I've seen it on sale a lot and almost got it a few times. Just busy with an enormous back log of other games I haven't even installed yet plus I'm getting into flight sims now and those are a universe on their own D:

Yeah, sure you didn't 👀
---
Totally doable and also a fairly common approach. You can save the mats or buy them on the AH to level engineering. Many people do that, so be aware that the market will reflect the demand in a few months when casuals are hitting 60. Once you hit max engineering, it isn't too hard to get the mats on the AH for your consumables.
---
Summer is June-August. (https://www.visittheusa.com/info/weather-seasons) :)
---
one word: freedom
---
This is so wrong. What dumbass guild would prioritize a marginal increase in AP on an already shitty dps class over giving a warrior one of the best PVP item spike in the game?
---
So I was skeptical of this too, but how it works is that you have windfury totem which gives the chance for free attacks on hit. It doesn't matter what you hit with, so a horde warrior using a 2h sword can spam Hamstring.
---
It's 10 rage, no cooldown, and 20% chance to proc the Windfury totem for a free hit.  The free hit is really big because it's a slow 2h weapon, and gets bonus AP.
---
So that's basically how it works.  Hamstring spam with chance for windfury procs.
---
Tl;dr: OP has an addiction for creating alts.  He won’t level to 60 until 2024, which is a NE Druid, the first thing he made back in 2004.

If this helps, I found this on a Classic PVP Discord that may answer your question somewhat.

I want to remind everyone that it's not your right to sneak into the sunken temple, assassinate the cretins trying to resurrect the Blood God, and then relieve the tortured Green Dragon guardians from their twisted slumber, it's a privilege.
---
No. Even alliance side 2h is pretty dam good. Especially early when you lack hit. The first warrior that gets Obsidian Edged Blade or BRE will likely top meters for a while on either faction.
---
Leveling will be a bit more tedious than some the other classes and you'll have to get reagents for things like vanish and poisons but not an uncommon thing in classic. You're also pretty gear dependent so knowing where the good weapons come from is handy. Also fairy fire from a druid is pretty annoying.
---
After watching this, and its only even MORE laughable that anyone would think private servers are accurate representations of how vanilla played, and how Classic will play.
---
If the originals couldn't even find their data, and needed "a backup, of a backup, of a backup," what makes anyone think the source code being passed around for private servers is anywhere near being correct?
---
Yeah im new to WOW but already know that Warrior + Healer are like OP together.
---
DS 3 was on sale on steam recently... I got a refund.

It’s a time capsule for fans of Vanilla, if you don’t like the models go play Retail. Nobody is forcing you to do anything, but having toggeable new models is a horrible idea and there should no changes besides very minor things like colorblind mode, but complete changes to how people screenshot, interact, and spread the games image online is a horrible idea. 
---
The world doesn’t revolve around you, we want to go back and have been fighting for this for a decade or so, it’s not a dick move to want to have fidelity to the cause, it’s a dick move to try to use foot in the door techniques to get us to concede to changes to Blizzard who is known to take an inch and go a mile.
---
Might be weird, but I am actually excited to be gear dependent. That is a plus for me.
---
Gear in retail is so minor and meaningless, in looking forward to upgrading one white to a green and actually seeing a difference.
---
Hello Alex, i play a Spriest back in vanilla, and with bwl gear, i was abble to kill the lvl 51-53 satyrs on feelwood with only one dot, that way i used to farm my runes witch were needed to be used for mana along with the pots, and get some gold on the side.
---
get a warrior friend, i was able to 2 man DM tribute runs this way, not as efficient as druid+rogue but still we could do 3 runs per hr, we just had to kill a few packs and skip the rest with MS, Mind control is your friend to kill those packs as 2 man.
---
The other guy listed a lot of my biggest ones but I'd add Into The Breach (by the same guys as FTL), Darkest Dungeon, Risk of Rain 1 and 2, and Grim Dawn. There's so many more, the list goes on and on. There's also Mordhau that released a few days ago, I've heard it's excellent. I'm going to try it out today.

How did I never know about that one!?!?  I took way too many round trips &gt;.&gt;

It has a 4 second CD and 15 second debuff on the same target, so CD is not an issue. Technically it's almost spammable, but you wouldn't want to do that. The prevention is comparable to what a Flash Heal would heal, but the extra mana cost is because it's supposed to be an Oh Shit button. The fact that it's instant cast and buys you extra time to save a life balances out the mana cost, and putting points into Improved Power Word shield increases it's mana efficiency, making it more useful for something like PvP wher e you'll find yourself more often in situations where a single team member is getting focused and you need to buy time to save them - also the types of situations where fights will be shorter and you'll have time to sit down to drink up and regain mana. Useful for both PvE and PvP in the appropriate circumstances.
---
Yeah I don't like how the mentality is "even blue fwar dw is better than ash 2h dps." Which it isn't. Upgrading from blue dw to ash 2h is a larger dps upgrade on alliance side to than hunter gets.
---
Look at W3... they’re marketing it a year in advance
---
Yep, neglected that part. Apologies
---
Oh no I completely understand, getting a blue from a dungeon is such a good feeling hell even a green gets me excited specially in the early levels.

I'll play however I want. I created a guild of like minded people so I can just ignore everyone else. :)
---
You won't play Classic with all those thousands and thousands of people who'll play. Just find like minded people and play with them.
---
He’s right though, the whinging about completely unnecessary things is what divides communities and caused the catastrophe that was retail WoW. Blizzard doesn’t know who represents the community, and the vast community played on private servers without toggeae skins. Because we wanted a raw and unique experience.
---
This is the biggest problem with it lol.

It was fairly nutty in BC, which is what I meant by arenas. It wasnt a min/max type thing but spell reflect and duo with a ret pally friend made for some interesting times. Sorry.

You are looking at this from a biased/emotional perspective though. The thing is I wouldn't give it to a Hunter personally because I know how people would react, even though it would in theory be the "correct" thing to do. Keeping people happy is IMO much more valuable to me than doing the min-max thing.
---
Well nobodies going to quit Vanilla because of the graphics so looks like you have no choice, if you want the models go to BFA, you can’t always get what you want.
---
toggle or not, it's not classic so it's not happening
---
Murlocs*
---
Funny, your the one trying to make the world resolve around you. You are against an optional toggle that effects you in no way. Also I don’t enjoy retail at the moment. 
---
And it is a dick move when your reasoning is “I want you to be forced to see my old mode”.
---
You are being a dick and so are several people here. Stop with the bullshit retail arguement and give an actual arguement.
---
There’s a difference between *choosing* a class and *learning* a class. You should definitely learn fundamentals before you learn class-specific tech/info, but it’s never too early to choose which class you want to play based on class fantasy, functionality, etc
---
Arms is trash because mortal strike pushes debuffs off the boss and does nothing 99% of the time. So you shouldn't be using it.
---
I mean, I'd just feel bad for the warrior leveling as prot lol.
---
I'd be picky about warriors who joined my group expecting to dps if they are the only warrior in the group. Like, why not just tank. If you do tank, I won't invite any other warriors so you can have all the mail(pre40)/plate gear that drops.
---
See and this is just stupidity. Early phase 3 arms especially with bre competes dps with fwar.
---
My poor dogs are going to get so fat.
---
Lots of good and useful stuff is going to be left out unfortunately.
---
Nobodies going to quit Vanilla because of old models and if they do it’s not the right game for them. But thousands will be in uproar that their game they campaigned for is being subverted by retail tourists.
---
Any guild that needs racial benefits to win is full of the worst players, both in terms of ability and personality.
---
Also, I personally don't watch streamers of any sort, but if I ever did I would look for the ones whom already have established YouTube channels and good content. A lot of YouTube channels I watch say they'll be streaming when classic hits.. I won't be watching them but if I did I'd watch them over some random stream I'd never heard of before.
---
With 16 debuff slots and proper knowledge of how debuff slots work you would realize your statement is just silly

Also images for Vanguard, Age of Conan, Warhammer Online and Wildstar prior to Rift.
---
No he’s not. He’s being a dipshit because I enjoy the new models and would like an optional toggle so everyone is happy. No one in this thread has given an actual arguement that isn’t “Go back to retail hurrr durr” or “I want you to be forced to look at my old model, I don’t care if you prefer the new models”.
---
That's my plan. To play what I want. I'm actually considering remaking my original vanilla characters.
---
I think its because theyre trying to avoid dead frames. In animation theres a certain guideline to avoid dead frames in animation because it can make things look weird and unnatural.  
---
Though if you try too hard and incorporate a movement in every frame, you get these weird bouncy and wobbly animations that we have in BFA.
---
Ironically, the game with the best chance of killing WoW is WoW Classic.
---
The orcs looked absolutely amazing, though.
---
Haha I love the vanilla class design so much. Send help!!
---
Spew such nonsense elswhere, buddy.
---
I played in Vanilla.
---
Our guild had several members playing non-optimal specs. We had Boomkins, Enhancer, a Shadowpriest. I played an Affliction - Lock through most of BWL and way into AQ 40 until I became the dedicated Emperors Tank. We even sported a melee Hunter.
---
Our partner guild ran it's own 40man raid, including 2 Feral druids, a smite-priest, another Melee hunter.
---
The best alliance guild on the server had 3 Retribution Paladins...two of which were renowned all over the server for being absolute monsters in PvP.
---
All these guilds cleared the content.  
---
All these guilds had one premise for the game: It had to be FUN.
---
There was one super-elitism hardcore guild on alliance side on that server, who only accepted "meta" specs...simply being in that guild was reason enough to be put on ignore by most decent people on the server, simply because no one wanted to have anything to do with these assclowns.
---
----
---
Bottom line: Your post is nonsense.
---
The PC gaming market is bigger than ever before and continues to grow each year. The problems you listed still only really apply to a handful of games, there are plenty others in more traditional routes. Are you excited for Cyberpunk 2077 at all?
---
The point about fast weapons eating up flurry charges is not a big deal. For your offhand you should look for good stats and high dps. Weapon speed can be a tiebreaker if you're considering two different options. 
---
For auto attacks only, weapon speed on the offhand is a wash because a fast offhand generates a proportional number of flurry charges as it eats up, compared to a slow offhand. There is a small difference when it comes to BT and WW though. Flurry procced from those abilities' crits is independent of the auto swings; WW and BT crit the at the same rate, no matter what speed your weapons are. So you will lose a tiny bit of flurry uptime with a fast offhand because of instant attacks.
---
The benefit of gaming your weapon speed is when you use two weapons of the same speed. Since your auto attacks happen simultaneously, flurry charges get consumed in pairs. When you only have one stack of flurry, you get an extra for free. However, this should take a back seat to stats and weapon dps, those are the main contributors on your offhand.

Woah man, but arms sucks I read a guide called "how to be a virgin fwar" and in it they said arms does 0 dmg. It's a meme spec like ret paladin.

In reality: it's actually fine lol, and doesn't really drop in viability in group till midish phase 3

16 debuff slots. There are easily 16 debuffs that are better than MS. Tell that to the mages when your mortal strike pushes off Nightfall or Ignite.

With 12 hours day of Classic WoW you will never get a level 60 character!
---
How come?
---
WoW’s still not dead, Blizz continues to make obscene amounts of money from the base game. MMOs in the style of WoW just aren’t that popular in the mainstream anymore.
---
I may be wrong here but resto druid hots don't stack, so if you're one of the weaker druids in the raid, your hots are going to be met with a lot of "a more powerful spell is already active" or get overridden. So you end up casting a lot of healing touch which isn't as good as other classes cast duration heals.
---
Remember too resto druids don't have a normal rez, just a battle rez. Not an issue in raids but running groups as a solo healer without a class with a standard rez, deaths really make groups lag as you wait for them to corpse run.
---
Not trying to dissuade you but resto druids do have quality of life issues at 60. Your innervate and battle rez are the utility you're brought for, but your raid slots can be limited.
---
It does affect me and many others, we want people to share the Vanilla experience and aesthetic, my game would be significantly ruined if other people in my community are having a different experience. Just like if I found out people on Retail had Elder Scrolls models, it’d be upsetting to me. 
---
You seem pretty upset so I’ll give you a pass, it’s easy to let our emotions cloud our judgment.
---
But there are numerous arguments against giving Blizzard an inch to change the game, because they’ll run the mile as they almost (and thanks to backlash) did with loot trading.
---
No cutting corners, no pleasing retail tourists concern trolls like you, just Vanilla WoW. That’s all we want, period. I’ve signed the original petition like I’m sure thousands have here and never would I have imagined that it would be hijacked by concern trolls who want Blizzard to cater to their every whims and act like they’re persecuted.
---
They were.
---
Wanna know how I know that?
---
Because I wrote addons for my guild back then.
---
My ex played on private servers with me. I seriously wish I had someone like that this time around. Unfortunately the current gf is really the gaming type. She is alright with me spending hours to myself, but usually not as much on workdays because I've already been gone all day. It's so hard to no life with a life.
---
I hate to say it, but raid tanks probably out dps enhance shaman.
---
Space combat was also unbelievably disappointing since it was strictly an on-rails shooter, at least on launch.
---
Just helping you confront reality, it’s BFA or Vanilla, not the best of both worlds.
---
Yeah thats an odd list, doesent make anysens at all to me. Whoever did this list,  is not a teamplayer.   
---
Say you play paladin and join AB, whisper a warrior tell him " - I will be pocket healing you peel and look out for me". And you are very useful and important, to the guy you are pocket healing you will be the most important player in the raid.  
---
Not only that but you will carry a Warrior so much that he will start to become a killing machine. You might even win the BG because of it. This is the strength of healers in BG.
---
Well tough shit for them because some people are going to be playing on minimum texture quality with all effects disabled
---
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
---
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
---
Oh yeah.
---
You say no but that won't stop a large community of doing just that.
---
My point was that the "hunter weapon" meme and idea that hunters are going to take every single weapon that someone wants is overblown. I've seen animosity towards adding hunters to 5 man groups as if hunters are going to mindlessly need on "chance on hit" proc swords (as an example). I don't see that being the case. This was an issue back during actual vanilla because the playerbase had tons of idiot 10 year olds who didn't understand the mechanics. I don't see the same happening during classic.
---
Pretty sure the updated texture toggle we're getting wasn't in vanilla either
---
&gt; They can do that, too. That's the beauty of allowing players choices. Players can have more fun doing things they want to do.
---
Beauty also comes from simplicity.  The beauty of artificially increasing content difficulty by attempting it shorthanded or removing gear is that these mechanics already exist in the game for other reasons.  This is [emergent gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_gameplay).  One happy side effect of the former is that loot acquisition is faster, and one happy side effect of the latter is that everyone gets naked.
---
Adding number sliders to increase difficulty adds unnecessary complexity and breaks immersion.  The game already provides ways for players to increase difficulty by modifying *themselves*, rather than modifying their *environment*.  The former makes sense in-universe; the latter doesn't.  The latter converts Ragnaros, the Elemental Lord of Fire, into a collection of math formulas, timers, and sound/texture files.  It forces us to peek behind the curtain and acknowledge that this isn't the World of Warcraft, it's just a bunch of pixels on a screen.
---
I don't think you've fully considered these implications.  Obfuscating its nature by saying it isn't "a single difficulty increase" doesn't help a random player who joins an MC group in progress and can't figure out why his Frostbolts are only hitting for 450 instead of 500, or why his Polymorph keeps breaking even though no one's hitting it, or why his fire resistance gear no longer seems to work.  Blizzard refused to divorce PVP and PVE mechanics for a very long time.  They wanted players to be able to step into AV and have their abilities work just like they do in MC, and for very good reason.

**Emergent gameplay**
---
Emergent gameplay refers to complex situations in video games, board games, or table top role-playing games that emerge from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics.Designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing tools to players such as placing web browsers within the game engine (such as in Eve Online, The Matrix Online), providing XML integration tools and programming languages (Second Life), fixing exchange rates (Entropia Universe), and allowing a player to spawn any object they desire to solve a puzzle (Scribblenauts).
---
It does suck bc it pushes off debuffs it just doesnt matter much cause MC is easy. It helps ypur warriors rank up get OP gear then switch to fury for the hard content. In AQ, mortal strike pushing off ignite or nightfall is a huge dps loss for all your mages.
---
You can’t have the best of both worlds, Blizz has established in consent with the Vanilla community that this is a time capsule.
---
I’m one of the lucky ones. My SO is getting excited to start playing for the first time!
---
I agree i love the social aspects of vanilla. no sharding, getting to know people on your server and a sense of character progression, not outdated looked.  But i want my tauren to not look like painted box heads at the same time.  Give us a toggle.
---
only 20 gallons?
---
thems is rookie numbers.
---
True, this line got me confused lol
---
&gt; people that dont like it can play retail.
---
See you clearly don't know how debuff works. Unless there are 8 nightfalls/ignites. (Which nightfall is the instant cast shadow bolt buff for warlock which I don't think is what you mean. Maybe you are talking about corruption). But it has an insanely low priority. With 16 debuffs warriors are going to be allowed to go impale which means that deep wounds is going to kick off MS before Ms kicks off anything of value.
---
If your guild is not allowing impale then you're actively gimping your highest dps class and losing more dps than you gain for 1 corruption lol
---
The last one should be Ion Haztakenwowinabaddirction
---
Seriously. That game was fun as fuck, but I'm not sure I could articulate what exactly made me stop playing it. Everyone just started to jump ship after capping.
---
Warriors that want other classes BiS items as priority when it isn't BiS for them aren't welcome
---
Your being highly dishonest.
---
1) No it doesn’t effect you since if you want people to look at your old model they can toggle it off. This just screams of being self centered.
---
2) Don’t try and discredit me by claiming I’m upset. I’m not, and I’m not the one attacking people for their opinions.
---
Wrong warrior 2H PVP vanilla bis is Bonereaver's Edge untill R14 or AQ Opens.
---
I actually have Risk of Rain 2! That, Slay the Spire, and Rocket League all have spots on my Steam Library. 
---
I suppose my post made it seem like I'm portraying a "woe is me" attitude, I'm just sick of the bland shit people are putting out nowadays and hoping Classic will be the game I've been waiting for all these years.
---
EAT A BAGEL!
---
Gearing in that game is whack.
---
Enhancement is a fun PvP spec but other than that, no.
---
Its either wow for 12/hrs a day or masturbating until my nuts shrivel into raisins.... i pick wow
---
Considering they are not using the 1.12 client, and we already know there are some adjustments, not really? We'll only truly know once it's out.
---
Except you can. Blizzard has already upped the graphics they can easily make it an optional toggle.
---
The new models look great, except for maybe humans, but i don't play filthy alliance anyway. Let players choose what they want.
---
Hi, /u/MC_GD
---
WHOOOOOOO GIVES A FUCK!!! (You shouldn't)
---
Rift was pretty fun. I miss the crazy trees and customization. I probably spent hours making builds when I couldn't play. Playing *that server with wildcards* right now and it scratches that same itch.
---
 I love vanilla trees too but they're pretty solved at this point, need a really good reason to deviate from the best each class. The best thing though is its important for your character to feel yours and somewhat unique to you. Vanilla does that in a ton of ways whereas in retail even different classes feel the same.
---
It is a physical debuff that sits at the bottom of the debuff stack. It gets removed by deep wounds. If you aren't allowing your warriors to go impale you gimp your highest dps class and I don't think that's a better solution
---
It's not bis for hunters. Mh hakkar blade and dagger off hakkar are bis.
---
Druid are a waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better class from TBC onwards. If you currently play one, you'll feel gimped as hell playing one in classic IMO, since you'll be mostly downranking healinh touches.
---
On the other hand, vanilla rogues are awesome.
---
you can play old models on a private server, you fuck off.
---
It had a lot of interesting ideas. I think if it had went factionless guild PvP it could have been wicked imo.
---
Yup, I have 2k hours on Rocket League. Great game, but they're killing it on the Steam store by the end of the year. Epic swallowed up Psyonix
---
props to you brotha, living the best of lives right there
---
We shold just start calling the largest pserver Voldemort
---
Yeah graphic fidelity is not at all what I’m looking forward to. It’s gameplay and community.
---
Also having 90 percent of warlock powers back.
---
Really high damage? They don't fall off until naxx. Lol the sword isn't helping his healing. It is only remotely useful in PvE on a hunter
---
Resto Shamans provide basically the same buffs and don't take up a good dps slot
---
Shit like that is pointless. 
---
People meme about how shit shamans are...yet you’d take 8 of them in your raid if you could get the numbers in guild. 
---
Every class is viable in every aspect of the endgame. Play the class/faction/race combo that is aesthetically pleasing to you.
---
If you’re a mom maxer, you’d know the answer and wouldn’t be debating it. 
---
People who talk about how certain vanilla classes are garbage are the sort of folks who have driven a Ford for 30 years, cause that’s what dad drove, and hate Chevy, cause that’s what dad hated.
---
Well yes they're different, but just pointing out not to expect it to be like Retail WoW in terms of specs being sub-classes, nor in the sense of Retail Disc's playstyle. If they're looking for Retail Disc, they're not going to find it. If they look at Vanilla Disc vs Holy and like one more than another then sure, go for it. But just trying to make sure expectations are correct.
---
Whatever will generation snowflake say?
---
&gt;  they were also way more forgiving.
---
mythic KJ would like a word with you.
---
Nothing better than when I healed in battlegrounds on my dwarf priest and if you were lucky enough to have a decent warrior or paladin who would return the favour by looking after you.
---
Mages for sure.
---
Not that Warlocks are bad or anything... they are awesome.
---
But vanilla mages are... well, vanilla mages.
---
Yeah.  I really liked the souls and builds part of it
---
Yeah I saw that as well, except they havent said what they are going to do with the steam version once the epic one gets released. I dont even see why this matters, is it that big of a deal to launch from a different client?!? Everyone on the RL subreddit are crying so much and I dont understand.
---
I am more worried about the wi-fi internet.
---
Psh. 1 monitor and bidet made in America? Back to the drawing board! Our fast food encrusted bowels require us to wipe. No water stream is made fierce enough to remove the filthy that McTacoWay leaves behind.
---
Mortal Strike can push off Ignite. Not 100 % sure on Nightfall. It doesnt sit at bottom of prio. Quick google shows this on private server forums, not the most reliable link Ill look for better.
---
Any of those can shit on allys. It's more a matter of how you'd like to shit on them :D
---
Lok'tar Ogar brothers!
---
Yup this is known as opportunity cost.
---
pickpocket farming
---
I played a Priest on a Pserver for a while and I fell in love with this build as an offensive healer:
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsbiZbZVMGdcdR](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsbiZbZVMGdcdR) 
---
I had a silence which is absolutely fcking deadly gamechanger, better fear and nice off-heal with Vampiric Embrace. Spamming MF on a target would heal my teammates a LOT and I could still cast holy spells. Just don´t go crazy with your damaging offensive spells cause your main role as a healer is just that. To heal. If you are standing in the middle of the BG and there is a 5v5 fight and both teams have a healer, the team whose healer goes OOM first looses. But I was using this build for runs with my friends, capturing AB spots or helping with a flag. I could still heal nicely, more mana costly and slow, but I had more control. The Silence is the best thing no doubt. Having an ability to lock anyone from casting anything for 5 seconds can help more than casting 2 heals. Vampiric Embrace is also great when there is a little bit of AoE going around you. You can pull some nice passive heals with it. Another pro of this form is that you don´t have to step in and out of Shadow Form which is rather mana costly. Sure you deal less Shadow damage but you are a healer after all. And you can do both + having a chance to Stun a target with your SW:P or MF is awesome. Overall, my best priest PvP offensive healer spec that I have tried.
---
The other one is:
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsbiZbxtccbV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsbiZbxtccbV) 
---
This gives you more consistent healing power but you can only cast Smite and Holy Fire as an offensive spell. I think that this build gives you LESS utility and less value than the one above. Basically, you just improved 2 offensive spells and gained just a little bit of healing out of Spiritual Guidance, which is extremely overhyped talent. At level 60, you have around 200-250 spirit BIS. That gives you a total of 50-62 bonus damage or healing. 
---
I choose utility in classic anytime. Combine that with Engineering and you are far more deadly.
---
Warhammer Online, Aion, Age of Conan, Rift, Darkfall, SWTOR, Tera, GW2, The Secret World, Wildstar, FFXIV, LOTRO, ESO, ... the list for supposed “WoW killers” goes on an on. Most of these games are shut down or in some sort of F2P rebranding. It’s really amazing to me how it seemed to be the same crowd of people who jumped game to game saying “no this one is gonna be it, trust me!”
---
We don’t have access to subscriber numbers anymore, but in terms of revenue and mainstream popularity I think WoW still reigns supreme as the most successful MMO ever created. If Classic manages to surpass or rival retail’s numbers, ultimately it’s still the same MMO and same company being the most successful.
---
Pretty amazing what Blizzard accomplished when you think about it. Also pretty amazing that so many companies attempted to dethrone Blizzard for so long.
---
TBC made druids great.
---
They were the worst class in vanilla.
---
wedonotsow.shivtr.com/forum_threads/2647521
---
Lists like that are useless
---
It can only if there are 15 other debuffs of higher priority. Or ignite was the first one of lowest prior and you put 15 above it. You won't have this many debuffs being used most of the time
---
As a hunter, this is why I'm joining a dkp guild xD
---
It will 99.99% not be possible. With how many times they’ve stated things will be in their 1.12 state I don’t see why this would be any different. Especially if they’re trying to keep GMs to a minimum, all it does is lead to server resets.
---
But you never know.
---
\#NoChangesConfirmed
---
I’ve given you plenty of arguments you’ve just resorted to calling me a dick across multiple comments and keep saying nobodies given you arguments as some sort of shield and vindication that you’re right. I gave you probably 3-4 arguments in total.
---
Yeah it's medium prior, I assume that's what that says. But if you need all 16 debuff slots in bwl that's funny
---
MS is higher prio than both ignite and Deep Wounds. Prio order : MS &gt; Ignite &gt; Deep Wounds.
---
Progression as in that is the top raid? Progression can mean two things. I'm referring to content progression, whereas you seem to have misunderstood me for dungeon progression. Even if you have BWL on farm, it is progression content until ZG and AQ drop. It's the best gear available
---
Yeah I already replied correcting my mistake.
---
&gt; You NEVER shield a warrior under any circumstance (it murders their rage generation).
---
You absolutely shield a warrior instead of letting him die ! Shield is your oh shit button.
---
Warriors don't like to be shielded before the fight because less rage, that's it. Rage is especially important at the beginning of a fight because you don't have much and you need to establish a lot of threat so that your rabid DPS don't steal agro.
---
If the guy has 5% HP left and the next hit will kill him, you shield then you heal.
---
And if the guy says anything about the shield he is an idiot that don't watch his life bar.
---
I played warrior and priest in Vanilla.
---
can always go engineering and hope your jumper cables work

Please share lap desk info.
---
Asking for a friend
---
Goddamn FTL bring it to my phone pls
---
You dont need them but if your whole raid is arms its quite bad right? So why reward the arms warrior as per my original post? The other ones are actually putting in the effort to spec right.
---
"I know nothing about this issue so I just over simplify and ignore things so I can sound sassy".
---
No one says the Diablo fiasco is the only reason for the hate, it was the tipping point. People had already had enough, but had hopes that BlizzCon would show that they still got it. Instead they showed us just about the most hated thing for the PC community, a mobile game. And Blizzard have always been a PC game company, so their entire community are basically PC gamers.
---
And it's not just that they released the mobile game, it also shows how little they understand and / or care for their community. And no, hating mobile games is not just without reason, it is harmful to the PC gaming industry, so seeing one of the big PC gaming companies turn to mobile games is a big hit.
---
This, *on top* of all that was been going on with WoW and OW is why Blizzard has gone to shit.
---
But sure, if you just manipulate the truth enough I guess you can make anything sound unreasonable.
---
Sounds cool. I really hope they don't add the new models so you're forced to play a game you seemingly don't enjoy. Maybe you'll quit then?
---
For mmo's wifi is usually more than fast enough even for really serious raid or pvp moments.
---
ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED
---
Dude they're hot pockets. They never go bad.
---
Does MS have unique debuffs or does it only create 1 debuff that's refreshed?
---
I enjoy the gameplay, dumbass.
---
I can easily name 16 debuffs you could use.
---
Idk I've only seen progression refer to the first time you are clearing said content. My misunderstanding
---
Get rid of the flip flops and put in a foot controller. After all, you have 2 limbs not doing anything.
---
As for the foot controller, I've had an idea and am rather surprised that it's not actually out there. Imagine a controller that you rest your foot on. This controller allows you to pivot your foot around your heel clockwise or counter-clockwise. It also allows you to slide the foot forward and backward. And finally, allows for sliding left and right. Of course, all three of these possible movements are spring loaded to return to neutral. Now imagine mapping these motions to 
---
Slide left/right - Strafe left/right
---
Slide forward/backward - Move forward/backward
---
Pivot clockwise/counter-clockwise - Turn right/left
---
And of course, you could use any combination of those 3 axis of movement simultaneously.
---
This does put a smile on my face.

What is the dps gain of the worst debuff im your list.

---
This will be deleted, pserver discussions are against the rules.
---
yes there was a texture detail toggle
---
Druids are good healers and way more interesting to heal with than paladins. 
---
Druid wpvp is fun, not surprise ur ded like a rogue, but you can wear down other players and if you're good, you can beat ANY class, including those that take shits on rogues. In organized pvp, druids are so completely OP as flag runners that any serious WSG team must have one. Rogues are the weakest class for organized pvp. 
---
Rogue PvE dps is great. Rogue wpvp is still very fun and they have strong matchups against certain classes, but for more classes than not, a skilled player can beat a rogue. Engineering is basically requried for pvp with any class, but a rogue without engi is completely gimped against good players.
---
That MTN dew is gonna go flat :(
---
You just argued against yourself. ”The game is MMO, not singleplayer”.
---
As it is an MMO, you will find peoplethat arent focused on minmaxing. Not only that, but you will find guilds that wish to enjoy the game casually. Once you find a guild like that, you are set. Likeminded people, who you can group with and do whatever you want to, pve or pvp.
---
What, no FFXIV?
---
Hey guys, Hobbs here
---
You are forgetting that by 2024 we will be the fairways through wrath and approaching cataclysm
---
To be fair, in very picky when it comes to games, and if I'm not fully sold on the genre or gameplay, I won't touch it.
---
After following dialo 3 since its initial prototype in 2007 before it evolved into what we have today, I went from overly hyped to totally turned off. Fortunately I discovered say PoE during that time and never looked back.
---
Many games have rough launches, its an unfortunate fact of life. But hardly do I waste my now limited adult free time with garbage like Anthem (or hell even destiny) to be aware of the worst of the worst.
---
Having said that, if you are comparing or even leveraging the industry's sinking standard to polish a turd, why bother. Just because everything sucks doesnt make a bad launch good by comparison.
---
If it's 1 debuff that's refreshed then it doesn't matter, if it is separate then it matters a lot.
---
Interesting. I thought hit procs are normalized to go a certain number of times per minute though. Aren't you losing out by wasting 40 rage the 80% of time it isn't proccing? Fury is more white damage focused but I always understood 2H to be more yellow damage focused. But I don't have the benefit of windfury experience so fair enough.
---
Imagine, some people are color blind and won't see you as you expected!
---
As for movies and streamers, feel fre to boycott any content taht hurt your vision of the game ;)
---
I'll definitely play with old graphics, this is how I played the game 15 years ago, this is how I played it on some private servers but I won't blame people preferring newer graphics, it's their tastes
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply. I've just become so accustomed to always being in full plate armor in the expansions that I couldn't quite wrap my head around wearing other forms of armor. 
---
Do you think that being able to mix and match armor types is generally seen as an advantage? It seems much better than being stuck with just cloth, like the priest.
---
I prefer mage for world pvp since I saw 2 mages killing 5 ppl on the way down to brd (all 60) insanely heavy cc(especially in vanilla!), big dps in both pvp/pve and also able to solo farm dm north for tons of gold (we all know pvp player are the poorest guys) and don’t get mad of ppl farming ur mobs
---
Some people introduce their family to it and play with them. Others just schedule the time and try to work an agreement with the family to have the time set aside.
---
Same song as OP, but it reminds me of Heroic Spirit Kings progression in MoP for some reason. I think it was played in a kill video.
---
Any early 2000s techno music immediately reminds me of WoW, because I feel like my exposure to the genre was exclusively through boss kill videos.
---
For the textures they created only a couple years ago?
---
And your future happens because you didn't make any friends with people you did not know before to play with them
---
Vanguard...RIP in Peace. It was supposed to to be the legit WoW killer. I don't exactly remember what or why it ended up failing though. I did play it for a while, though. 
---
I actually liked AoC..the PvP was really fun especially since it was All-vs-All. I think the end-game content was pretty lackluster though.
---
Yes, I have too but this post might get removed by mods btw. The communities on these servers is usually great, and very friendly. But a bunch of people who come on this sub have never played on one and will demonize you for it lol.
---
That's kind of the whole point of this thread.  
---
It doesn't matter what you had and what worked in vanilla.  
---
The mindset and knowledge of the playerbase is vastly different than what it was in vanilla, and because of that you can't assume that every guild will recruit 15 shadow priests to their raid group.  
---
Granted I do agree with you that 90% of guilds won't enforce strict class/spec limitations on their raid group. It's foolish to think that just because it was common practice in vanilla it'll be the same in classic.
---
Vanguard !
---
The only arguements you have given me I had previously addressed.
---
I'm a private server no lifer too mate lol

Pantheon \\o/ (soon TM)
---
I've been trying to beat the first map on They Are Billions at 100% for months now. I want to blame an endless stream of bad maps and bad luck but the truth is I'm probably just terrible at the game.
---
I watch streamers play and they start out with a giant open area with friendly cliffs and choke points and then I get finger shaped mountains with ore along one side and a bunch of lakes.
---
This fits a full sized laptop with a number pad and room to use my gaming mouse. This is what I've been using for a mouse. It's even better for healers imo but also works well for hunters and melee dps. Putting different heal ranks or traps and shots on different mouse number rows really free'ed up my bars

20 minutes??
---
That’s way too much time , I could be Knee deep in Chunks of Boar Meat in that time span
---
More than MS I can tell you that much.
---
Melees survive somehow, don't they. Essentially the melee-weaving acts as a melee player. Therefore I don't see why it wouldn't be possible in almost all of the cases, even on Ragnaros.
---
a lot of little things but the constant prompts for controller buttons when I'm on KB+M and no option to turn it off or switch it was enough. out of the 40 minutes I did play, I probably spent more then half that looking up the keybinds then pressing random buttons to figure out which key was the back button since I never saw it listed.  
---
I did do a google search about it, and did see that someone in the community did build a mod but if I have to mod a game at the tutorial I'm just going to take my money elsewhere.
---
...lol, wow.
---
The Classic crowd wants a game where (among other things) the leveling experience matters, you actually have to be social to find groups, guilds really matter, theres more RPG elements, no daily bullshit grinds, etc.  Thats why people dont want to play BFA.
---
Telling people they have to deal with not having any of that just to have the model they prefer (that is only seen on THEIR screen) is just asinine.
---
all of the american idiot singles.  used to leave much music on in the background and green day dominated the charts in late 2004 and 2005.  don't even like green day but the association will always be there.
---
This is one of those aspects about Vanilla, and pre-social media gaming in general that I don’t think can ever be recaptured. It is sad to lose that huge sense of wonder in a new game.
---
Wow thanks for not answering the question.
---
don't kink shame me, boomer
---
👀
---
no but for real.
---
You know that MS and Deep Wounds isn't the same thing right?
---
Go jump on a rusty lance dude.
---
&gt;For your offhand you should look for good stats and high dps. Weapon speed can be a tiebreaker if you're considering two different options.
---
True.  But that's the exact case we are talking about right now. Minimal differences in stats and dps is the exact 3 examples given.
---
&gt;There is a small difference when it comes to BT and WW though. Flurry procced from those abilities' crits is independent of the auto swings; WW and BT crit the at the same rate, no matter what speed your weapons are. So you will lose a tiny bit of flurry uptime with a fast offhand because of instant attacks.
---
Yes exactly. And having those flurry ticks on the mainhand is important for DPS.
---
You could always send the kids to Saturday or Sunday school , just a thought
---
I figure to play 2-4 hours a night during the week and 5-8 a day on weekends
---
It doesn't affect character looks almost at all compared to new models. That's why most people there wouldn't mind a reasonable increase in the texture resolution.
---
Imagine how fast you'll be able to Bejeweled addon.
---
Sounds like you already did.
---
It's going to be hard as hell to 'kill' a game with so many players. Even in the darkest days of WoD the game still had millions of subs.
---
Speaking for myself here:
---
I think the reason I could never get into any other MMO was because I was chasing that "high" I got from the first time playing vanilla wow. It was my first MMO.
---
I don't think that feeling will ever come back with any MMO. I'm hyped for classic, but I'll never get that feeling again even for that.
---
Became friends with a guild mate during Ulduar patch and we both had similar tastes in music. I remember when B.o.B. released his first album, we were doing Heroic ToC and my guild mate and I decided to leave the raid just to listen to it.
---
The most notable song on the album was "Airplanes"
---
I dont have time to work out the answer to that right now.
---
Blizzard is the real WoW killer, please. They have the fucking responsibility. Activision is just a consequence.
---
What no way since when
---
Okay, I can see that. I forget how differently the factions play in Vanilla since the differences got partially phased in tBC and completely phased out by wrath. I've never seen a 2H warrior on alliance even get close to a dual wielder
---
Yes. I tested it ahead of time for you.
---
To each his own. If I had to play on M/KB I probably wouldn’t play it either. It’s been a controller game from DS1.
---
Hmm, this makes more sense indeed...
---
But don't you think Classic and Retail are somehow two versions of the same game and the need to reduce maintenance to one single graphics stack exists already?
---
Learn the mechanics before you theory craft.

"All melee and close support need to be on the inner ring engaging Ragnaros while he is up. Note that placing any class with a mana bar in melee range will mean that those in melee range will be at risk of being knocked back by his targeted knockback ability."
---
the biggest advantage to a feral tank/dps is your Druid tank can be geared concurrent with warriors.
---
Gearing 3 warriors and a Druid is easier and quicker than 4 warriors.
---
When your OTs are not tanking they swing Nightfall or annhilator. When your druid tank isnt tanking he is giving  a melee group 3% crit.
---
Then maybe you should take it out of your ass and start acting like a decent human being instead of gigantic asshole.
---
Fuck financial reports I'm long past that : I'm analyzing black goats entrails !
---
If every warrior gained 3-5 dps from switching to Ms and Ms didn't overlap. You could gain 20-40dps from having MS and most debuffs under 10 (cause you getting to like corruption and weaker shit) is not going to give you that dps.
---
I remember back in the day me and my buddies would sit outside org and drink the beer in game and offer anyone who passed a drink it got to the point one day that we had 5 or 6 people sitting in a circle talking it was fun
---
I'm 37 and still single. No kids, no relationships that lasted longer than a year. I'd love to change that some day, I'd love to be a dad, and have a partner to share hobbies with. But at the same time, I can't really deny that having my time be MY time, without having to schedule or compromise to work other people's desires into it, is a nice perk of the situation.
---
Many games on your list dod some aspects better but Wow still has the „best“ overall package.
---
Buddy, this is a sub about a 14 year old mmo videya. No one here cares about your anti american political tyrade.
---
I'm actually shocked your post is still up and not flagged. Read the sub rules
---
But no warrior gains dps by switching to MS. 2H fury is more dps.
---
You don't need to buy every spellbook for each demon actually.
---
Just upgrade your voidwalker taunt/sacrifice frequently and ignore your other demons. Once you hit 60, just buy every max level book : you don't need to purchase the previous ranks.
---
Oh damn, Nineteen I just heard all this on Countdown to Classic Podcast where you were interviewed. Super interesting hearing the stories from back then. 
---
Anyone reading this I would highly suggest giving it a listen
---
I could have also been more specific. No worries
---
I play after work with my mates, on the last pserver I played I was though, not everyone is like that on the servers man
---
Many games on your list did some aspects better but Wow still has the „best“ overall package.
---

So your logic is that when people see a universal symbol in a video game they figure that is the literal purpose of the symbol in the real world and not just fiction in a video game and that there is no training of soldiers prior to war to not shoot at soldiers bearing the cross.
---
Somehow, by your logic you see a symbol being used wrong in a fictional video game with magic, spells, teleportation, transmutation, non existent races, in a non existent universe on a non existent planet immoral.
---
It's a good thing he isn't talking about PvE then.
---
I love boomeys and as a warrior tank main, i will always take one any chance I can get. It's an excellent way to see which caster DPS players aren't pulling their weight.
---
Im so pumped for this game.  I played EQ for the first time a few years ago during one of the TLE servers.  It was the shit.
---
!remindme 5 years
---
2h fury is not more dps before certain ap thresholds.
---
A class with stealth is the best for WPVP no doubt. You won't kill everyone in a 1v1 situation but being able to sneak by, ambush them when they are low and eat their corpse is much better than anything else. I will be playing Druid because I can´t decide what to play.  
---
This way I can tank my 5men, be in every serious BG group because everyone needs a good FC, heal raids, off-tank raids, play WPVP where you as a druid are one of the best 1v1 classes + having stealth and heals is just amazing. Other than that, I love mobility and classic is VERY SLOW. You can´t compare it to retail not even slightest. Every class has some super-duper run 300% movement speed buffs.   
---
But for you, if you want to play rogue, play one. You can be great in BGs if you will do what you have to do and not camp lowbies and chasing EZ kills. If you can take out an enemy healer or FC by sneaking up on them, you will be more useful than half of the BG. People really underestimate Rogues in BGs. If you want to play one, play one. Follow the objectives and the game will tick into your favor. 
---
Remember the latest Game of Thrones episode? \*SPOILER AHEAD\*  
---
Arya Stark won the whole battle by sneaking by and ambushing the right target at the right time. Not any warrior nor mage. Not a giant. Not a fcking dragon. Same applies to WoW.
---
Interesting.
---
I was a Troll
---
Something I haven't seen someone mention about this is the bag/bank space taken up by trying to hold onto the white items that will be useful for you in cooking, rather than selling them right away. Bag space is at a real premium throughout the leveling experience, and every spot taken up by raw cooking materials could mean throwing away stuff that's worth currency, or spending more time running to vendors to make more bag space.
---
Depends on what armor value bosses and if all the armor debuffing stacks, if so theres better weapons for bosses than BRE, but BRE would be supreme for trash
---
It's a forced downgrade, the steam client is years ahead of epics.
---
How exactly is this damaging anything again? This is the same logic used by the people who said video game violence promotes real world violence.
---
Melee don't typically dps on shazz unless progressed. Because he does tons of dmg around him. You will be slowed on Garr so you wont be able to weave right. Baron melee go in and out when inferno goes off so you can weave when inferno is off if your timing lines up possibly. But not reliably.
---
Not exactly. When developing botnets, or simulated load, it implies that you're coding around known behaviors. **Real** people provide an invaluable asset in testing...that is, players behaving unexpectedly. There's only so much simulation you can do. The real bugs come up when someone or something behaves in an unknown way on your servers in an area you least expect. 
---
Furthermore, simulating load with or without botnets does not give you the insight into one of the most important pieces of the puzzle. Quality. Assurance. What does this look like to them? You don't get that with a botnet.
---
If anything, it will be moreso.
---
The demographic of Classic is a small minority of hardcore PServer nerds, and a VAST majority of old, settled players, who want to recreate their childhood and teenage memories.
---
People like me don't go for full minmax optimization. We play games for fun. And I know you don't wanna hear that, but: We outnumber you. Alot. :-)
---
Yeah... The casino rng gear system was the prime reason I quit the game. Loved the fishing system though, had a good time for a month or so.
---
No. I quite like it where it is. Thank you.
---
I mained a Blood Elf, and that model update was so weird. The run animation was awkward and they changed the casting animations for some abilities. For example, BE single target instant cast animation  was holding your hand forward. It turned into throwing both hands above your head for abilities like Holy Shock. It still bothers me.
---
No. not at all. He is perfectly allowed to like System A over system B.
---
His argument as to why was about how System A is less cumbersome than system B. That simply just isnt true. 
---
Thats like saying you prefer Apple pie because its tastes like Cherries.
---
Yes he is.

---
&gt;Blizzard is a multi billion $ company, they always have backups of everything. Since you can buy their stocks I'm pretty sure they are legally obligated so save everything.
---
Not really. They can go ahead and delete the old version of the game if they so desire as long as it does not have any impact on the current version. Now that they have announced Classic, obviously they can not just delete it anymore, since *that* would skydive their stocks, thus screwing their shareholders.
---
Also it's not that unbelievable that a company does not backup every version of a game that has been constantly evolving 15 years. Especially not in the start where everything was a mess. Just look at the things they did show of how the code worked and what we know from their workflow back then, I'd actually almost say it's more believable that they didn't bother keeping track of things as they do now.
---
&gt;what a surprise we just found the old database right at the time of a very big petition and the Nost debacle
---
Well, how is that weird? If they didn't look for it but then decided to, isn't it quite obvious that that is the time they would find it, if it was findable? Seems like you just try to make it sound shady.
---
Not saying you are necessarily wrong, just saying you are not necessarily right either.
---
Proof?
---
18 hour days for the first few weeks or bust! Living like it's 2005 all over again!
---
&gt; they are already basement-dwelling neckbeards
---
      
---
I guess I failed to notice that. What a sad, depressing place this has become. Hiding behind "muh freedoms" while destroying themselves and ignoring there's life beyond a fucking video game. There's none so blind as those who refuse to see.
---
Feel bad for ya, Ad_terra. Poor fella.
---
While I hope you're right because I'm taking classic with a casual approach and don't intend on min/maxing anything, I'm not counting on it.
---
slight correction, hunter dips after BWL because there are not many upgrades in AQ40, but they are good dpers early
---
Uhh according to what guild? Because fury pulls away in Molten Core. BWL doesn't drop until phase 3, so every serious warrior will have had the time completely gear themself. Even with the T1 options, Arms is obviously subpar. You will see a raid kick if you mortal strike a boss, which limits your already worse damage. You can 2H fury on horde, I guess, but that's just with windfury. Alliance it is never worth unless you have absolute shit 1 handers and a pretty strong 2H is dropped. If you are at Nef in any serious guild, you don't need this as a warrior (again, alliance. I have nothing to state firmly about horde and their magic attack twice logs)
---
I used to hide behind some hills in orgrimmar as a lvl 51 pally and wait for duels to finish, to which I'll swing my hammer of wrath and then run away/bubble hearth
---
Basshunter taught me that
---
As someone who served for a decade, carried the GC card, whose brother's, father, uncle's, and grandfather all also served..... Get over yourself. It's a game. It's a red cross. It's harmless. It's in no way trying to relate or compare itself to a Geneva convention protected symbol.
---
BfA has to be darker times than WoD I’d think
---
Agreed. People think I'm actually going to look at their characters. I'm don't care what your wearing or how you customized your characters face. I like classic gameplay. The graphics can use an update tho.
---
It's not a waste of time or unhealthy if I actually enjoy it and don't regret it though 🤔
---
Are you asleep on CD-Projekt-Red or what?
---
There's a market for these games, I'm just not part of it.
---
You speak like IRL has something better to offer.
---
How crazy is it that we actually have decently convincing VR this time around
---
Yup, is a good one.
---
It's extremely strong in pve if tou auto attack weave during your rotation (which is situational and hard to do).
---
Come to the horde, we have cookies, better trinkets and scarier rogues !
---
New models look like fucking aids man. Its like Blizzard fucked Disney, cartoony and bouncy.
---
green crosses 420 blaze it
---
So you just crapped on your own argument.
---
Also if I remember correct, Onyxia buff is only melee attackpower as well, just like dire maul tribute buff
---
That is good to know. Wouldn't have figured that it's based on the mana (thinking melee shamans) but if that's what it is then it is indeed impossible on rag.
---
Quick google found this :
---
Curse of Shadow
---
Curse of Elements
---
Curse of Recklessness/Weakness
---
Winter’s Chill
---
Sunder Armor
---
Nightfall
---
Faerie Fire
---
Improved Shadow Bolt
---
These are the best 8 for just straight raid damage.
---
From here you cycle in mitigation debuffs;
---
Thunder Clap
---
Demoralizing Shout
---
And from here you add the juicy things;
---
Ignite/Scorch depending on Mage count and raiding tier.
---
Hunter’s Mark / Tier armor reduction.
---
Annihilator Proc (for melee heavy raids)
---
Shadow Priest utilization for 1 or 2 debuffs.
---
Gift of Arthas
---
Arcanite Dragonling (quicker fights with Fire Mage heavy groups)
---
Judgment of Wisdom/Light/Crusader (crusader generally only for meme run or on Noth where the bulk of your Paladins will roll Ret to burst adds, utilizing Priest healing to compensate for multi-tank damage)
---
And there is consideration for taunts as well, which will overlap.
---
Edit; notice there are more than 16. Adjust to your raid / favorite flavor palate.
---
Then most will go a Barbarous Blade from dm n king but the actual bis would be dalrend set from ubrs all with 15 agi. The problem is that getting them on a hunter is more trouble than it's worth
---
I plan to make an alt and just mail mats as I go.
---
Unnecessary complexity? It's opt-in. It's only as complex as you want it to be.
---
Immersion? It's opt-in. If you're playing for immersion, simply don't opt-in.
---
&gt; The game already provides ways for players to increase difficulty by modifying themselves, rather than modifying their environment.
---
Yeah, because people don't like modding games to provide unique experiences, eh? You seem to be completely ignoring how prevalent modding is in Blizzard communities.. WC3, D2, WoW all have massive, million-player modding teams to change the environment to provide something Blizzard could not. When players have the tools to make something extra they always create something really great.
---
&gt; Obfuscating its nature by saying it isn't "a single difficulty increase" doesn't help a random player who joins an MC group in progress and can't figure out why his Frostbolts are only hitting for 450 instead of 500
---
Who said anything about obfuscating its nature? Make it blatantly obvious you've joined an MC run that has different adjustable values that change gameplay elements. Stop trying to pretend they (or I) would purposefully attempt to mislead players.
---
Hell you could even make it a separate server, like a private server or their arena servers. Have a bunch of vendors where people outfit themselves they see fit, apply the desired settings to instances, and run through them without loot and a simple timer.
---
If there are no rewards, it doesn't affect you. It's like being pissed private servers exist because they offer something else that doesn't affect you. Your defense pretty much amounts to assuming they'd purposefully create a flawed system with easily solved issues.
---
If you don't like add ons don't use, Whoa it's almost like a solution already exists to your problem.
---
But you said " it's not something that I want to see devalued", how would you think a fictional video game utilizing this icon would somehow devalue the icon?
---
I thought it had a ton of promising features but in the end it was lacking in too many areas. I really liked the public quests for example. Those were really neat.
---
&gt; its only even MORE laughable that anyone would think private servers are accurate representations of how vanilla played, and how Classic will play.
---
It is common knowledge that pservers are not accurate. Not only are they buggy in all sorts of ways, most numbers are guessed and even some mechanics are guesswork or changed because they can't make it work as it should. Everyone knows this.
---
And yes yes, I know - *some* people think pservers are accurate, but that is a minority. Some people also believe their dead dog talks to them, let's not use those individuals as any measure of what people generally think.
---
Right people in vanilla always invited boomkins and elemental shamans for raids.
---
I'm gonna minmax my first character to get ahead of the curve. Then chill out on my alt. And I'm gonna have fun playing both.
---
Wait, they will get mad and quit because they didn’t get an off spec item that is main spec BiS for another class?
---
So by this line of thought, healers will quit when they can’t roll on spellpower gear for their off spec?
---
Help me understand good sir.
---
is instancing confirmed for classic?
---
Do the math? 160+wpn vs .45%ap. For your main attack. Sword spec will keep up in dmg vs flurry, sweeping strikes gives insane cleave.
---
Goibon uden lo!
---
Don’t forget Slay the Spire. I think Path of Exile counts too.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
This past Tuesday we had an entire seasonal cycle in one day. Woke up to sunny and warm, around noon a storm rolled in and it started raining. By 2 o'clock there was about half an inch of snow on the ground, and by six it was sunny and warm out again.
---
I love our schizophrenic state.
---
And that effects the game in what way?
---
They can strategically ninja flags and defend points. They don't suck, but then again, this may not be considered "fun" for most players, instead of going pewpew on the opposite team.
---
I find it funny as hell tho, but people are different :p
---
20 hours a week will be playing way more than neccesary to never cap out on rested even if you are questing. Thus questing is better.
---
I'm also interested in the answer to this question
---
I want to play Old AV.
---
We're all getting "Vanilla WoW modified", it just may not be to everyone's taste.
---
&gt;I, take you, to be my wife. I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in no times during WoW Classic Summer release, and in sickness and in health. I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
---
Those were the marriage vows right? Perhaps you just need to remind her.
---
Sounds like my worst nightmare
---
Awesome! Hope you enjoy it.
---
Use your professions for gold as a healer. Either herb/alc or enchanting. Plus cooking and fishing if you're so inclined.
---
Running dungeons can be profitable as well. Get a tank and run live side Strat for orbs or the like. There's no real need to farm gold from trash, especially if you want to min/max your talents for raiding. Respeccing twice a week adds up fast.
---
Sorry I totally miss read your tone 💙
---
Apparently they that change yesterday also.
---
References naxx boss when discussing phase 1-3. Nice slip in. But most of the latter ones are good utility but not necessary just as Ms isnt necessary but losing out seal of crusader. I think the raid will be okay
---
Well if you arent world class, by definition you arent finishing the game as fast as possible.
---
At what point is it not speed running? Intentionally going slowly?   
---
Ive played the game a lot, I know the maps the quests, the zones and gear. Do i need to MIB style wipe my memory for it to not be a speed run? 
---
Unless youre trying to beat (or approach) the WR...its not a speed run.
---
Lol BMI standards 😂😂😂
---
I wish it was the minority. I get heavily down voted here whenever I try to explain this.
---
How will that work when queueing for multiple BGs at once?  You'd have to wait in Ironforge/Orgrimmar for 45 minutes just to queue for all three BGs.
---
Not "expected" per se, but why not be optimal at your stuff?
---
Pretty sure you'll be noted by your raid leaders if you are exceptional with your class and will be rewarded accordingly.
---
It's ok, if GF/Wife looks at her phone for any reason state how If she doesnt want to spend time with you that can be arranged and storm out, gaslight and project your way to 10 minutes family time!
---
Watch the video lol
---
For this picture to accurately depicter a Rank 14 there would have to be at least two people in it.
---
Watch the video mate, it's not about rolling ignite but a bug with rolling ignite dropping despite the boss being crit by fire spells.
---
"Sword spec will keep up in dmg vs flurry".
---
You sure? What about factoring in procs like untamed blade or consumes like shadow oil? You don't have death wish which is 20% damage for 30 seconds, longer than some boss fights. 
---
Depending on your weapon, you may run improved slam as well.
---
Also pretty sure a prebis geared warrior with consumes and world buff passes that threshold easily anyways.
---
Eh, I'm not sure it's amazing so much as it is a "We thought of it first!" thing. WoW was the first MMORPG to show that there was a not-hardcore audience of people, and apply something resembling a streamlined experience rather than stuff like EQ where you had to go to remote and weird places just to camp 1-3 mob spawns for hours. And unlike EQ2, it didn't need an Alienware computer to run.
---
After that, it was just trend-following because other publishers wanted a piece of that pie, but they didn't really understand the long-term commitment and constant updating that goes with them.
---
Companies still mindlessly follow trends to this day, like the survival fad which DayZ and Minecraft sparked, and now Battle Royale.
---
&gt; The red cross is a symbol denoting medical aid.
---
It's literally from the International Red Cross and Crescent from 1854, *they* started the association to it, not the other way around. Having it spammed all over games where players murder each other is a way of protecting the meaning and significance of the symbol. 
---
How fucking dense are you?
---
Good game
---
I need a few more hours to really give a detailed review 
---
*745 hours played*
---
You can farm lower lvls(like elemental earth) in grp (elite like ungoro Dino’s)or sneak in dungeons (like tribute run with a Druid) or do professions(mining herbalism skinning for easy gold since enchanting is rly expensive to raise, even 1like herb and alchemy worth’s)
---
Man  you didn't even watch the video or what? That's not what the bug is about... It's about the ignite dropping when it shouldn't.
---
y tho
---
They drop. Unfortunately. You will see plenty of Lightforge and Elements if you farm your class set for the sake of upgrading them.
---
Well, FFXIV was actually successful and the last numbers I heard made it sound like the only real competition to WoW.
---
It just appeals to a different audience so it might be why people don't call it a "WoW-killer". Other than the fact that its a cringy expression.
---
You do see tons of "wow refugee" guides to FFXIV pop up tho. But those refugees rarely stay active for long.
---
Try wc3 and run the campaign again. Its what Im doing. I also try some battlenet games but oh god i suck. Nice tho
---
This is a post about not having loot boxes. Lol. 
---
Although, you can 100% play without opening them as they are only cosmetics. 
---
The game is a lot of fun, and has good skill gaps with a lot of learning curves.
---
&gt; 99% of players wouldn't do it because there's no loot. 
---
Ah yes, let's have them waste time making content for 1% of players. Great idea!
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up for a beta. They using an already working client. They know their sharding system works. They probably have a way to simulate all this stuff in house. Theyre not introducing anything new like they would in an expansion.
---
Go tailoring and enchanting. They go super good together and well with your class. And if you are lucky to get some of the good limited enchants early you'll make bank off all the hardcore raiders.
---
&gt;  I'm going to make a solo account I can play on while he is busy. 
---
I hope you just mean an alt lol, no need to pay anther sub
---
Wifi is just inconsistent, that's all.
---
Depending on what you intend to do (PVP, High end raiding, etc.) there may be a "right" way to play. That had been a thing since the early days of WoW. What I mean by that is, if you were in a progression raid guild, certain Class/Spec/Race combos were either A) frowned upon, or B) just straight up not allowed or viable. In the days of Vanilla WoW (and to a lesser extent even in BC) the game was not really built around the idea that all specs or class/race combos were truly viable for serious play.
---
A perfect example of this would be Warriors and raiding. If you played a Warrior and intended to raid on any kind of serious level with a mind toward actually clearing content, you were going to play a Protection Warrior. There was no question about that. Even more than that, I don't know of any truly dedicated/focused progression guilds that used any other class to MT than Progression Warriors.
---
Likewise, raiding as a Druid or Paladin meant you basically served no other purpose than as a Buff-bot.
---
This may not seem fun to you, but it's the way the game was built back then.
---
Now, does this mean that's how things will be when WoW-Classic goes live? Who knows at this point. But if Blizz is trying to truly recapture that Vanilla feel, that's what's most likely to be the end result.
---
how exactly lol
---
Divinity Original Sin 1 &amp; 2. Great turn based RPG.
---
I'll be rolling 3 on launch.
---
1. Get the names.
---
2. Level a bit.
---
3. Swap.
---
4. Go to step 2.
---
They should just do a massive stress test... Have an OPEN beta for the weekend. :)
---
I know I can, I just don't like the idea of leveling in a vacuum because when classic servers aunch you will be able to sell things. Albeit not for very much initially but anything is better than nothing. Mostly I would like to get used to alliance side quests/towns n such because I didn't try to faction until WotLK and then only briefly because I was on Illidan \*shudder\*.
---
Getting downvoted is not even close to being evidence that it is a majority. It is common knowledge that pservers are not accurate.
---
Can't agree with this. My Guild will not be a PVP focused guild but I'd still like to do occasional premades for fun.
---
Why should that be limited to just 5 people? That means even if one more person joins they have to play by themself because of a lazy fix.
---
Dips, but it doesn't tank. In BWL gear they are doing very good damage. You're right that they don't scale amazingly after BWL, but ZG gives them nice upgrades. It's naxx that they become a tranq shot bot though. They aren't losing to paladins until maybe naxx. Like a full AQ geared paladin abusing undead damage mechanics, with every buff. That paladin still isn't using this sword. Again, no one gets much PvE use from this weapon, but hunters are the only ones it helps at all (alliance side. so only side)
---
I'd actually join that group, I hate druids
---
Of the final release client?
---
Same. Like the economy aspect of that game is pretty nifty, and even the combat has some value, but the casino is just brutal. My friends told me if you just suck it up it's great, but like why even stick to it to begin with.
---
Announcement tomorrow
---
I've never been on a PvP server. I plan to "goof off" by executing alliance scum on sight.
---
For the Horde!
---
That was literally a copy pasta barely even read it....   
---
Still, being MS is a dps loss for you as a warrior and for your raid in lost debuffs. Period. You can choose to accept that if you want to.
---
They are removing the loot boxes and replacing with a "rocket pass" which gets you cosmetic skins the more you play. Game is now free and you can choose to pay for that pass. 
---
I dont think people have issues with paying for cosmetic skins? I believe its more the pay to win things like Darth Vader.
---
I assume this means you are starting in Durotar and she is starting in teldrassil. Excellent choice
---
Esos growing wow is slowly dying. Lol so still possible
---
Hi, /u/Speedy_Bread
---
Doesn't matter, still means other people see your character differently than you
---
Well, you can´t change someone by simply saying "don´t do this". If you want to change something, create a community, be a leader, take more interest in things that people around you do and try to be a better person. If you go down to a lion´s den and say to him don´t be a lion well guess what´s going to happen. He will eat you. But by feeding a lion regularly and giving him more care, and activity than he currently has, he will be a better lion and less aggressive one for sure. He won´t eat you when you go down to his den.   
---
You can´t take something from someone by force and tell them that it´s bad for their well-being and expect them to realize and even agree with you or thank you. If you want to take something from someone, you start by giving them something else slowly and more regularly until they will not want the original thing at all.
---
Thanks! I got a G602 mouse cause I wanted wireless. Will look hard into one of these tables though. Seems like just what I need.
---
Right I don't actually enjoy WoW pvp but there are no populated PvE servers that I'm aware of. I tried leveling through the 20's in every zone that has quests at that level and the only place I didn't get frequently murdered was wetlands which isn't the densest hub in the game.
---
I thought the server was like 60A/40H but it really didn't feel that way unless I was in elwynn or something similar and low level.
---
Yea I ment alt. If only I had a PC powerful enough to dual box.
---
Your argument against alternate character models is that they were not in Vanilla, and in the next breath you say they are allowing textures that weren't in Vanilla as an option.  It invalidates your argument's reason.
---
FAPs are bad, but it's really when ZG comes out and LAP is available that it gets impossible.
---
That’s actually funny
---
Yep, another reason not to be a ret.
---
They have already implemented the rocket pass, I think it’s on season 3. The loot boxes are only disabled in certain European countries... they are still in the game. Just got some last week!
---
Not exactly reminding me of my own in-game experiences, but every time I hear Here Without You by 3 Doors Down, [I can’t help thinking of this.](https://youtu.be/Fb5LIo6HE6Y)
---
what is the original from
---
If threat is atk spd normalized, having the proc giving you an extra swing that can crit giving you oodles amount of rage it will. The value isn't just in flat dps it's in the rage gain giving more dps that compounds on itself.
---
Dude, stop being annoying. You are either doing it intentionally or out of lack of Intellect stat.
---
Haha yes sadly PVE didn’t provide the same adrenaline rush as the clutch flag click return that wins the 45 minute 2-2 slugfest.
---
Damn, people on the internet love to argue about EVERYTHING. This is hilarious.
---
Idk I kinda liked the old models better, also new models wearing old armor might look goofy lol
---
Okay. So show a parse of an arms warrior beating a fury warrior. Single target. Otherwise you are just talking.
---
Life uh... finds a way.
---
Starcraft 2
---
As a vanilla holy paladin, this list has some issues if it's ranking pallys that low. 
---
Let me make sure I get this across right away. As a paladin in general, you have little to no offensive capabilities. Any 1v1 you engage in is gonna take you a long time for one of you to win. I remember having fights that just ended with both of us stopping and moving on just because we couldn't kill each other.
---
That being said, you are possibly the greatest PvP healer. You healing output is very strong; comparable to a priest I would argue. Your spells are very Mana efficient so you can spam your max rank heal without any real worry. On top of that, you have so many defensive abilities and talents, that you become Essentially a tank who heals. Being such a sturdy healer, you're great for playing objectives in any bg. You're a perfectly fine flag carrier, and you can contest a capture point until you get your team to assist you or you get severely outnumbered. If you get a warrior to duo with, you can become a pain train by freedom spamming him and watching him mow people down while you support him.
---
Or you could be a priest. I can't really speak for them but there is a lot more skill required since your squishy, have to down rank heals to conserve Mana. You do get more offensive abilities like mind control, aoe fears, and Mana burn.
---
I raided as Horde on Bronzebeard server with Thorns of the Black Rose.
---
TLDR: Going 100% ranged is legit as fuck, going 100% melee is flat out impossible.
---
First of all going with melee when you're gearing up in heroics is like shooting yourself in both knee caps. Apart from rogue they lack CC and are susceptible to every fucking mechanic, in addition to having way lower DPS than ranged. 
---
Melee is objectively trash tier on every single boss in T4 and T5, simply because there's nothing they can do that ranged can't do better. On some bosses, like Leo, Al'Ar, Vashj (due to DPS req), Gruul, they just suck. Like every other Kara boss they are fucked over due to movement, a mechanic or aoe that ranged handles a million times better. 
---
Rogues and enhancement have OK DPS on paper but are fucked over by mechanics and limited movement. 
---
The sad part is that only Sunwell is really relevant as a raid since T6 is so fucking easy, so by the time they get gear and fights allow for them it's only really one raid left.
---
As far as I understand it doesn't have a seamless open world like WoW. I think that may be a dealbreaker for me if there's loading screens between all zones. But I like the old-school approach.
---
Blackrock Depths as a rogue is the largest solo-content playground. So between farming dark iron ore and the dark coffer keepers.
---
Hey Frost, I perfectly understand you. Every day I go to work and in the evening, I sit before my computer and mostly wait for the day to end without having relaxed or "filled my batteries".
---
But: the waiting will end. Quite soon considering how long we are already waiting. Keep up the good work, I really like your videos!
---
Lmao, so a bunch of nerd gamers got disappointed who gives a fuck. Companies should be attacked for exploiting their workers not cuz some spoiled weirdos didnt get the game they wanted.
---
I remember getting Manslayer of the Qiraji back in vanilla as a hunter. How, I do not remember. Everyone asked why in the hell do I have that. I said because it has agi on it, duh. I lived up to the huntard name.
---
Damn, yeah that's the wall I'm running into.
---
I've got spotty hours through the week, so while I'll have enough availability to gear up/run raids, I won't really have the time to sit down and grind dungeons. I'll just have an hour or two here and there, so I was hoping to find a good solo build where I'm not dependent on a group.
---
Second problem is my guild requires engineering on all mains, which really limits my profession choices. I guess there's still fishing/cooking... but I might just complain about how healers shouldn't have to take engi, so I can pick up some money making profs.
---
It has been in development for 7 years and has over 15 mil in funding. Not sure what some of the previous failures have been, but it is coming. You can dabble in it when you get some time once it is out.  I am 100% with you on the apprehension though. Not good games out in the past 10+ years. It's been a rough road for mmo players.
---
Good bot.
---
I have to disagree with this idea that P2 will just be full of gankers.
---
You can get away with ganking on private servers because there is a (relatively) low pop for the timezone.
---
When your entire server pop plays in the same region it won't be possible to just sit at a flight path and camp. There will be so much active traffic that you'll find yourself overwhelmed quite easily.
---
Even a pre-made group will end up running into difficulty as other Guild groups form up to counter.
---
In addition to this, the gear differential will probably be quite minor. At the start of P2 I expect there'll be plenty of people that are blue geared with a smatteirng or purples. So it's not like there'll be a situation when a max geared T2/2.5 dude can outgear new 60s either.
---
Ganking will definitely exist, but not in the way that folk envision.
---
Gotta love the feeling of catching a mage right after their Blink with a charge or well placed grenade. So satisfying.
---
Yeah, I saw that as well. I just can't figure out where they are going to advertise, or IF they are going to.
---
Probably because it's the only MMORPG that is actually good. It is a marvel of good design. Better than WoW Retail in my opinion.
---
It is a modern MMORPG though, so does not have the old school charm of WoW Classic.
---
Quoting from wikipedia:
---
&gt; A speedrun is a play-through (or a recording thereof) of a video game performed with the intention of completing it as fast as possible.
---
As fast as possible is of course depending on who is playing the game. If me and my grandfather both try to finish Mario 64 as fast as possible, I'm going to have a vastly better time than him. That doesn't mean he is not speed running. Speed running is just trying to finish a game at any% or 100% as fast as that particular player is able to.
---
for years indeed.... live wow has been awful for a long time
---
No new models in Classic, the differences in graphics are minor changes to lighting, different shadows, water and foliage.
---
Hardly anything is confirmed, but if they are planning to field the mass of people that I imagine are coming, I would imagine they would either have instancing within servers, or just spring up a zillion servers. Not sure honestly.
---
2 gifts per week from the Loved category, 1 conversation per day. It'll work out
---
If they were wanting to put them in would they not want to test it first?  Don’t be silly dude
---
They really are rookie numbers lmao
---
As said that’s why I won’t get to play a lot. Once the kids are all tucked up in bed, I plan to play on a good gaming laptop so I am still sociable and sitting on the sofa with the wife. Weekends, it’s kids stuff during the day and again will play after kids are sleeping. 
---
WoW is a fun game, but I was a hard core raider back in vanilla, this time I plan to play when I can and have fun doing it.
---
So you are just ignoring the existence of razorgore, Nef, twin emps, cthun, 4h, sapph and kt. So yeah on the easy bosses a moon may not oom, but for all of the harder bosses they are terrible.
---
Quit lying to people.
---
Guy here who works out a lot. Nope, that's a NO for me! You won't soften up. A week off to deload is actually recommended after 4 - 6 weeks of weight training. It helps a lot with recovery and you build faster.
---
Or a net while they just sit there and take it. Hunters too.
---
I gotta use this Life Hack
---
Just picked up ESO again and enjoying it so far.
---
Warlock for 1click raider and good gold farmer(hunter sucks with aq and u will find nearly no raid slot) rogue for have open world fun and at least a rota warrior if you want to tank (can also do decent dps but hard leveling till 30 only heroic strike sucks so hard!) or shaman for healing just cause
---
Probably ends up worth it. It's a little sad that even that is kinda expensive in the beginning. Mailing one thing at a time that many times could cost enough silver to delay buying a new spell.
---
&gt;to justify your opinion 
---
It's illegal to use the symbol.  I apologize for not being more clear in stating that it's a violation of law.
---
Don't agree with what Ion is helping to do to the game these days.  That said,  he is a real down to earth, eloquent, fucker and I can't help but respect him.  Seems like a cool guy to have a beer with.
---
A good LPT here.
---
Summoning people at the bottom of lakes/oceans as a warlock.
---
&gt;you say they are allowing textures that weren't in Vanilla  
---
never said that. I said there was a texture detail toggle in 1.12
---
Yeah I hear you mate, I love PvP but there's something about being part of a raid gives me that tingling feeling even now, I've raided alot in wow as well, not so much since 2012 though.
---
Is Songflower also not a world buff? Warchief's Blessing? Not sure when Darkmoon Faire comes out.
---
....so you're saying there's a chance.
---
Lol, something that scales off an rng mechanic is more reliable than something that scales off rng. I had my parses on realmplayers back when that was a thing but it has since died and lost the old parses. At least I can not find mine. With bre I was topping, human warr.
---
Come classic when we have data to stay ill hit you with a pm showing you parses from minmax 2h arms.
---
In small BGs or WPVP just find someone and stick to them.  Once they figure out they have a pocket healer, they'll help keep you alive.
---
AV is great fun as a healer.
---
How tall are you?
---
I think it was the difficulty curve poor itemization and the dearth of content.
---
There were 4 adventures, basically scripted dungeons, which almost anyone could face roll.  The only items that were upgrades were a handful of epics that were crazy rare drops, and they we minor upgrades at best.
---
There were 4 dungeons, which were basically traditional mmo dungeon crawl dungeons.  These were crazy fucking hard.  You needed a perfectly balanced group, and a gear level that meant that no one was going to use any drops (apart from ridiculously rare drops).  The only reason to do dungeons was that, if you completed them on "hard" mode (think WotLK hard mode raid boss win conditions), it dropped 1 skill point.  You could get one from each dungeon, but only one dropped for the whole group.  If anyone made any mistake, at all, at any time, you got nothing.
---
There were two raids.  A 20 man raid that was ludicrously hard.  It required everyone to be able to heal/tank/dps while moving, while watching the whole screen for telegraphs, and watching their debuffs.  A single mistake, by anyone, meant that you wiped.  Immediately.  There were no "controlled wipes" where you practiced the mechanics.
---
The second raid, was 40 man, which meant guilds had to get both an "a" team and "b" team through the 20 man raid.  Almost no one even saw this raid before the game was already effectively dead.  It was also laughably, ludicrously hard.
---
This difficulty wasn't a bad thing, necessarily, but the difficulty level catered to only the top \~10% of MMO players skill-wise.  If you weren't in that tiny subset, you basically had a single player story campaign, with four adventures, and a bunch of pointless dailies.  It's good for an MMO to have \*some\* content that's only available to the cream of the crop, without it, there's no impetus to improve your gameplay, but in Wildstar, the lion's share of the content was basically limited to the best-of-the-best but the nature of the mechanics meant that you were only as strong as your weakest link, since you couldn't absorb any mistakes in raids/dungeons.
---
I misunderstood then.  My bad.
---
Hordechiefs blessing? Alliance player sorry.
---
I'm hoping for a strong outlook from Activision. I'm down about $50 been bag holding since November. My 1 year chart looks like a picture of the grand canyon.
---
Just a bit over 6'5 (or 197 cm).
---
Ah, yeah, I didn't wanna be the asshole going "wElL mAyBe YoU sHoUlD pLaY oN a PvE sErVeR!!one!", but I was starting to suspect PVP at all was the issue, moreso than just nonstop campage :D.
---
I don't know of a populated PvE server tbh.  You could just download a repack and spin up your OWN private server.  I haven't screwed with it yet, but I've done some reading on it.  It doesn't look not very complicated, and I believe there's even a repack of the server we're discussing available now.
---
You have way more crit than you do sword spec chance. Like 25% crit vs 5%. Yes, more reliable.
---
"Come classic when we have data to stay ill hit you with a pm showing you parses from minmax 2h arms."
---
And you better back it up with a parse from minmax 2h fury of equal gear. to compare. Then we can also figure out how much dps was lost from the debuff slot you took!
---
LOK'TAR OGAR
---
That's not bad then. Good on ya and hope you hit your goal!
---
Subnautica
---
För vi sitter här i venten :D
---
I really don’t think people understand how fucking boring ret is. If people are able to level as ret(also painfully boring) and stick it out and try to endgame as ret, props 99% of people that plan on playing ret will quit/commit suicide.
---
I played EQ for 4 years prior to playing WoW and I got my PVE fix with 100+ person raids being one of the first few guilds game wide to kill things. Plus there were no instances so you had to race other guilds for content and there was always steep competition after server resets. 
---
I do look forward to places like BWL and AQ that I’ve never stepped foot in. But damn was MC more like Molten Bore or Molten Chore.
---
They confirmed sharding for starting zones
---
it's ok
---
Sketch comedy show called I Think You Should Leave
---
So what your saying is we need to wildly speculate and whip ourselves into a hype frenzy?
---
At the end, Classic is all about dedication.
---
A night elf priest who shows up is going to get the spot over a dwarf who doesn’t every time.
---
Well if the raid isn't minmaxing all 16 slots etc there is no loss. But I can respec from 2h fury and arms to see training dummy dmg.
---
that's ten times faster than mine was
---
Mind control fam. If we are talking min max.
---
22 hours was the longest session I ever had. I got up to take a piss and I realized the sun was up. It was 8am.
---
Blazing! I remember calling my buddy and saying "dude, I'm at almost 2mb/s! I'll be able to play when I get home from school tomorrow!"
---
Having played multiple MMOs since Vanilla (and I never really put much time into BC and was so far behind at WotLK that I never actually made it to Northrend), the problem most WoW players don't realize is that FFXIV has far more appeal than most think it has, which is one of the reasons why it keeps growing as WoW has forgotten what it's customers really want.  This view also comes from playing FFXIV through the last two expansion (was still leveling/catching towards the end of the re-release), and I have the next expansion on pre-order.
---
Seeing FFXIV v Classic is going to be interesting, though as I expect most of the western MMO industry is going to realize that the catering to the casual market is complete stupidity and (hopefully) we can see an MMO renaissance once the MMO devs pull their heads out of their asses.
---
Why you heff to be mad?
---
&gt;How fucking dense are you?
---
So you don#t even respect the basic rules of the subreddit, but you expect people to take you seriously? Welcome on block. You lost.
---
Yeah there definitely was. I didnt want to spend DKP on an item that was a small upgrade when I could have a chance to get my BiS. I didnt really feel like i was min/maxing as much as saving and spending my DKP wisely.
---
I do hope it delivers for sure. It's really telling of the current state of MMOs that arguably the biggest thing to happen for MMORPGs in a while is the release of a Classic version of WoW from roughly 13 years ago. I really hope a new MMO comes along that breathes new life into the genre and goes back to the original design philosophies that made the genre so big in the first place.
---
And in vanilla that literally meant BWL and beyond, what's your point?
---
So if you don't even know the boss mechanics of rag, why on earth do you feel qualified to talk about this?
---
Dude's actually giving us the true classic experience.
---
&gt;  or do you want me to get the crayon box?
---
What exactly do you think is going to be missing from his loot table?
---
Well, there are plenty more shitposts lately, gotta admit that.
---
Perfect. Also do it with full debuffs on the boss, full armor reduction etc. Best to use a real boss not training dummy.
---
Collusion with the horde is punishable by death.
---
Hell no, I was horde from Vanilla to BfA :D
---
It's time for a change.
---
But yeah, you are correct, she's gonna be a treehugger .P
---
Almost makes me want to play alliance.
---
Many people gave you the reasons. Honestly seems like you’re trying to pick an argument.
---
I guess, out of many possible reasons, the ones that stands out the most are : diminishing the achievement of doing a raid in “normal” mode, it makes the world way less immersive and changes the core concept of a World as a Game to a game with a bunch of instances mini-games.
---
To explain my last point: I think, personally, World of Warcraft started as a true world. To kill other players, you would venture into the world to kill other players. Simple. They then added a bunch of instances content, like battle grounds, which make the world less and less relevant, and the mini-games (instances) more and more prevalent.
---
I think, if any changes would ever come to WoW Classic, they should strive for the opposite: World Bosses, non-instanced pvp objectives, etc.
---
If you are learning both disciplines then I'd recommend Goblin second so you don't have to buy them. Gnomish Engineerings useful items are reusable trinkets so you only have to make them once. It's really up to whether or not you want access to free bombs or casings.
---
I mean, I'd do a few entire raid as one spec then a few as the other. Maybe alternate specs every week or two. So the raid members and debuffs would be consistent.
---
Is this true? I hope this is true. The new models are horrendous and I haven’t been able to actually play retail since they came out.
---
Exactly. Being bad at something is the first step to being good at something.
---
Jumping circles around the tree in Stormwind
---
They would have to be a splinter faction away from blackfathom, darkscale, coilfang etc. Some kind of redemption story some where that lets them be best buds with the night elves, or some kind of factionless start that lets them side with night elves or horde some how. 
---
Not sure how you would go about leg and feet armour though. 
---
Permanent underwater breathing, 100% swim speed, they are a water based species and the majority of vanilla is land based, not sure how useful they would be in that regard.
---
Mythic uunat and Jaina are two fights I’ve seen and been bummed I quit raiding. I hope they don’t nerf uunat. 
---
His gear is funky. Maybe most mythic guilds can’t kill him without lock stacking till they get some of next tiers loot? As someone posting on /r/classicwow I’d say what’s wrong with that? But I can see the retail mind set not liking that. 
---
That said, I haven’t raided the top end since 25 man’s, is 3 healing the standard now? I would’ve thought the game would be balanced around 4.
---
Jesus christ you're so smug that I'm actually excited to watch you get crushed when you find out the reality.
---
Which of course will be you being in a trash guild bitching constantly about how this wasn't how things used to be back then and all these p servers kids ruining the game. Oooooh boy this was something I didn't even know I was looking forward to. Thank you for this.
---
Ironically you get your karma back from the discussions inside the post haha
---
one monitor lmao
---
pleb
---
Idk about horde, but I can't see why Arms would ever better than 2H fury in pve. It is so clearly a pvp based spec. You can't use mortal strike and your damage is just straight worse. Alliance, no 2H sword has a use in pve unless it is worn by a hunter.
---
Learn to accept and love your pets names :)
---
Well looking at the threat a toggle would not make everyone happy
---
My personal opinion, underestimates and misrepresents the importance of the symbol.
---
Opinions like mine aren't the reason the color was changed to green though, it's against the law to misuse the Geneva Conventions symbol.  Someone just persoally attacked me in a pervious comment for not clarifying.
---
Ideally you wanna give it to a warrior who pvps a lot or is ranking that way they can represent your guild in BGs by crushing people with raid gear.  If it's not going to a warrior for pvp then it can go to an offspec or hunter no one really cares it's not a pve item so people are indifferent.
---
Living action potions are great when we get them, but FAP's can get you out of the flag room at least if you know someone is there. Many times you will get jumped by a rogue and stunlocked hard. Once you are midfield as well, unless you are alliance with BoF, it can be a life saver to get to your team.
---
Fucking hell. He even looks like me, too!
---
Sure dude. But like you said, "just do the math". Fury is pretty clearly better single target.
---
Whenever I hear a flaming lips song, I get memories of wow because I'd often put on one of their albums while I was farming herbs/ore.
---
Bre and untamed are the 2h weapons of choice. And mc is a cleave fest, pretty much any 2her beats 1hers on cleave fights
---
Do not try and eat the carrot. That’s impossible... only try to realize the truth.
---
What truth?
---
There is no carrot.
---
There is no carrot?
---
Then you’ll see, that it is not the carrot that gets eaten, it is only yourself.
---
No, I'm not.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it take ~15 catches per skill up when you get to 250 or so?
---
That sucks, but this time around we don't have to worry about BC :)
---
yeah, the ones who worship the "things" really gave me a lovecraftian vibe.
---
How about the ZG poison bug that killed millions? The CDC actually used the event to build models lol
---
I've never argued single target. I've argued sweeping is better cleave and arms is competitive damage early on.
---
I have to say that this MMRGLGGMLLGLL'd my day.
---
The only exception is the final Water spell, which always makes 10. (though it won't be available until Phase 2).
---
Kind of unfair for you to assume I know nothing about the issue?
---
&gt; No one says the Diablo fiasco is the only reason for the hate, it was the tipping point. People had already had enough,
---
Okay well, in regards to what? Don’t you think you need some examples here instead of just speaking vaguely?
---
&gt;  Instead they showed us just about the most hated thing for the PC community, a mobile game. And Blizzard have always been a PC game company, so their entire community are basically PC gamers.
---
Well except for Hearthstone and all the console ports Blizzard has done, Starcraft, Diablo, Diablo 3, Overwatch. Not to mention the early years of the company were focused almost entirely on console games. But primarily they were/are a PC gaming company I agree with that. It’s not like they just abandoned PC games entirely to cash in on a basically unrelated market.
---
I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy the last Blizzcon, but it still seems like you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. Did you expect them not to announce a game related to their IP at Blizzcon? Their other big PC projects simply aren’t ready to announce at this time, but *they are in progress.* Isn’t that exactly what people love about Blizzard? Taking their time to release good games? What does it matter if a totally unrelated studio is making a mobile game under the Diablo name? Diablo 4 is still coming out at some point.
---
We’re getting WoW Classic and WC3 Remastered this year, these have been hugely demanded by fans and in spite of this people are still complaining about the company. Even though it’s obvious how dedicated the team is to recreating Classic and pleasing one of the most hard to please crowds in all of gaming. Btw, if Blizzard was only concerned with the highest cash flow possible they wouldn’t be working on either of these projects.
---
&gt; This, on top of all that was been going on with WoW and OW is why Blizzard has gone to shit.
---
I don’t play retail, so I don’t know much about the state of the game other than fans seem to be looking forward to the latest patch changes. Not sure what you mean by Overwatch since I play that pretty actively and Jeff &amp; team seems to do a pretty good job listening to the player base. Do you think it’s in Blizzard’s interest to upset fans and consumers? How would that make any sense?
---
Signed
---
Lets see... overpopulated servers that will have queue times. Relentless hordes of fanboys who will be toxic if you offend their streamer in anyway. If for whatever reason you are in a dungeon/raid with one, good luck if they need the same loot as you. If they quit the server could entirely die. Server first things like “Scarab Lord” will be harder, World Bosses will be harder, popular grinding spots will be harder (Devilsaur).
---
Gonna be a hard no from me.
---
My best friend from High School is gonna be visiting me for the first week of launch and we probably are gonna do like 24hrs straight. My body will hate me but it'll be worth remembering the good ol days
---
That's actually a good tip, thanks!
---
That Windows XP UI brings back all the feelz.
---
It was the first change that led wow down the path to what retail is now.
---
For my part I sure have forgotten many quests in these 13 years. Will be fun to be surprised when lvling :)
---
https://youtu.be/CdUJW9p9y1s
---
I know right!
---
Even that fast it took forever
---
Unless you're 40 and above you count as a millennial.
---
I wanted to go hard on classic. I'm hyped, i played pservers, i love the game. 
---
But i can't do this anymore. I'm 25 years old, im single and i won't sit in my basement this summer. 
---
I will play casually a few hours a week, and i will enjoy it.
---
Raiding for locks is really easy.
---
Minus all the prep they might require, you basically just spam shadowbolt over and over
---
It’s mostly the same people regurgitating the same two arguments that are extremely bad arguments and attacking people.
---
Like every arguments has been either “I don’t like new models so you should be forced to use the old ones so you have to look at my characters old model”
---
Or literally a slippery slope fallacy.
---
You realize that millennials were the ones playing vanilla, right?  So are you trying to describe Gen Z?
---
No, any warrior on both sides would use asscandy in mc on cleave fights over 1hers. That alone would be better than a hunter.
---
I understand what you mean. To me it's tied to a very formative time in my life. I was 12 or 13 when I first started playing. I'm not that young and impressionable anymore. I can't devote myself to WoW like that, nor would I want to in all honesty.
---
Send me a link, and I'll check it out.
---
Yes sociopathic behaviors ftw!
---
I made a lot of money selling fire protection potions and showing people how to use the attunement shortcut (which involved a decent amount of lava)
---
In my practice people still die, you can't heal a DD that accidentally aggros a huge pack, someone lagging, and such. 
---
Yeah it feels like taking shaman or priest with us is good, but that makes me feel like a really restricted healer. Maybe I should consider shammy again... But druids so kick ass dude
---
"Useless lightning shield" that scales extremely well with spellpower, has no cooldown and procs blackout stuns on the melee who are hitting you. Definitely not useless.
---
The hero we need
---
Om du ändrar dig så är du alltid välkommen :D
---
for sure, lots of other bonuses too  
---
1 of my fav's is a stormwind(im sure theres a horde version) solo teleport. 4 hour cd but can save a lot of time with your hearth set elsewhere or if its on cooldown.
---
Why didnt she just take the kids computer away?
---
Just vote with your wallet and keep reaping the joys of Steam.
---
I sure did, no FO76, Destiny or other assorted crap for me.
---
Almost all of my game hours for the last 2 years have gone into PuBG, Golf-It, Vermintide2, Risk of Rain, DOOM, a little bit of Apex and some Starcraft: Remastered.
---
Serious though, check out Vermintide. It might scratch your fantasy itch just enough to make it to Classic (plus there's a huge expansion coming out this year!)
---
Dude over half the mc bosses are cleave fights, unless you have 9 bre and untamed then asscandy to wars is better.
---
Orks, Mr. President.
---
It's BIS for horde too, sadly rune of the guard captain is not available in phase 1.
---
That's 2.22MB/s. Which is at least 17.76Mb/s. ;)
---
I think it’s less to do with the playercount and more to do with the amount of content. People jump from game to game all the time, Call of Duty 3 was once the most popular FPS, DayZ was once the most popular survival/zombie game. WoW is basically a game that never stopped development since 2001 (I think that’s when it started) any other MMO simply doesn’t have the resources to compete at that level, unless they are hugely mixing up the gameplay formula. The problem with many failed WoW killers was a lack of end-game content or compellingly unique features.
---
Well, it's not a surprise every subreddit always comes with his memes associated. I understand if you don't like them or find them cringe but well I think it's bearable and not that big of an issue
---
It’s funny, I can’t bear to play Retail for more than an hour or two but I’m actually looking forward to playing Classic for hours at a time.
---
Lol you clearly don't know how it works if you think he's talking about warlock nightfall! 
---
He's talking about nightfall the axe that puts a debuff on the boss for 15% increased spell damage.
---
SO is paladin basically a tanky healer where as Priest is a more squishy healer?
---
Easily the dumbest thread that gets regularly posted here
---
You are correct and i get that argument haha.
---
blegh, aion. That game let me down hard and cemented my distaste for all Asian MMOs.

oMg THosE dARn MilLEnNiALs
---
Engineering on a priest is a little silly. Is this for PvE or PvP?
---
Sunshine, other than you, I cleared content in Vanilla.
---
I was there when the realm first Thunderfury was completed (Rogue in partner guild). I was there when our very own scarab lord opened the gate. I was the first guy on the realm to wear the Hakkar trinket. I missed Server first Nefarian by only a day.
---
I kicked ass, took names, and had a blast doing it. I have nothing to prove, and will be happy chilling it out in the new Classic.
---
So excuse me if I am not impressed if you hyper-minmax content that I had already done before you knew this game existed ;-)
---
I mean I pretty much said that you go for imp ambush and remorseless... That's the core of the build.  Fast stealth movement and chaining ambushes between mobs to level.  
---
And 53-60 is still a good chunk of leveling.
---
Okay but the fights that matter are mostly single target. The ones you struggle to progress through. If you do a bit more on aoe trash its not really a great argument.
---
Im a min maxer to a certain level im playing alliance only so.. ;p
---
Dont forget the dwarve joke :)
---
The amount of farming you have to do to put up the best numbers in the raid.
---
Lol my duo partner for 15 years being a warlock making me look stupid. And yeah what patch is nightfall added?
---
&gt; to try and force me to use the old models
---
Nobody is forcing you, because it's not an option. You're playing classic.
---
wow thanks for the write-up.
---
One detail I forgot to mention because I entirely forgot about it the class separation in classic...Has to be on the Horde side. If Ally, I'd most definitely go Druid.
---
At the beginning, I'll likely be vendoring or not looting for that reason. Certain mats in the early levels aren't valuable enough to sacrifice time for.
---
I'll probably have to brush up on when and how to get bags asap as well on a related note. I'm looking forward to actually having to do inventory management.
---
But what you don't get in this case, Ashkandi is really a good hunter weapon unlike say Thunderfury.
---
They are trying to. Like did you even read the thread? People are demanding that there’s no toggle. And for all we know IT IS an option.
---
Or below 20
---
Underrated comment
---
There is almost nothing left to talk about.
---
It's a 15 year old game.
---
That hasn't been re-released.
---
Memes kill time as we wait.
---
True
---
People here are making me like Paladin alot more haha i like how it seems like a tanky healer which i like. 
---
I suppose the only way i can correctly judge if i have old man reaction timings is to really try.
---
Your post literally states that Min/Maxers will ruin the game, which is itself "Gatekeeping", in that you are stating it is wrong to be a min/maxer because as you say if you are one it will destroy the game, so your unstated point is to not be one. Thus you are telling people how to play, by saying it's wrong of them to play as a Min/Maxer
---
Ehh if you aren't wiping to easy content trash clear time is the longest part of the raid. Early on at least
---
I know you're kidding, but for those wondering about the resemblance, yes the red cross is honoring the Swiss flag because that's where the first Geneva convention was held.
---
It's true there's a lot of anti-consumer bullshit in the modern games industry, but it's not universal. You just have to pick and choose your developers. It's depressing that most of the game companies I used to admire have gone to shit, but you just have to look elsewhere. 
---
AAA games cost more and more money to make as graphics improve, but the purchase price has remained the same. It's a lot easier and faster to create a tree with 5 polygons than a photorealistic one. So game companies have to reach a much larger audience than before to make their money back, leading to watered-down stuff that's designed to appeal to the largest possible group of people. It's either that, microtransactions, or a higher purchase price (never happens because it's probably marketing suicide). 
---
Or, like people said, indie/smaller developers can take bigger risks on more creative game concepts.
---
&gt;They are trying to
---
Gimme a source.
---
&gt;Like did you even read the thread?
---
Did you? Blizzard hasn't mentioned it at all. What half the players want doesn't mean anything.
---
Yeah dude, good times
---
Jesus christ Reddit.
---
Never change.
---
Well I understand the slippery slope argument, since looking at retail it spiraled way out of controll with LFD LFR etc.
---
I hope they dont add the models to have the most classic game.
---
I too hope that after some years they will go the OSRS route and maybe we can vote on the new models then.
---
That looks like my current internet I pay 70/month for in Cali
---
&gt; and then said it’s a warning
---
Meaning if they continued they'd get banned.
---
It was pretty easy with a little gear. Then again I was a play. So I had bubble.
---
Holy shit dude you have no clue. He would replace it with untamed or bre, not a dark edge lolololol. Oh and that asscandy would be used on cleave fights in mc.
---
I love this meme so damn much
---
So you didn’t read the thread at all, because they very first person I responded to was against the option. And every personal attack against me in this thread has been by anti-choice people.

But troll priest has the best racials...
---
He's the one being pissed and angry while calling others so. Just leave him be bitter for no reason.
---
You're saying a raid needs tanks, healers, and DPS? Stop minmaxing my fun away I'm just going to show up to the raid with whoever is near the portal entrance and have a great time. STOP TELLING ME HOW TO PLAY ELITISTS!
---
The world first kts and r14s I can get behind, you soloing hogger is total bs mate.
---
No it really doesn't. You go 2h fury, not arms. 2h fury is very viable horde side, ally side just in mc for cleave fights
---
could mean something also
---
Please be satire
---
I don’t see why an optional toggle is a bad thing. We’re already getting post Vanilla graphics as it is. And I realllly do not like vanilla graphics, Diablo 2 looks better IMO.
---
Private server so I will know what class I want to be when Classic drops.
---
Stuck between Druid or Rogue because I love leatherworking.
---
&gt; Don’t try and discredit me by claiming I’m upset. I’m not, and I’m not the one attacking people for their opinions.
---
Yet you downvote civil replies instantly. You're clearly upset.
---
How much trash do you actually AoE in MC/ BWL though? Most is 1 or 2 target max.
---
Are you sure about that ? I followed the game for afar, I never heard of that.
---
A or F if you can master. Decent all round spec with best interrupt which is very important and is also a charge. Druid mostly will be flag carrier
---
Nobody reported it before.
---
Not sure 1.4 1.5? It'll he there for 1.12 for sure.
---
Long story short debuffs will be heavily managed by good guilds this includes not having useless debuffs like mortal strike
---
Fuck ActiBlizz!!!1! Giving us WoW Classic and going as far as implementing spell batching to please fans and recreate the original experience. Also the same company that released Diablo 3 and changed the game for the better throughout its life cycle and based on player feedback. Also the same company releasing Warcraft 3 remastered this year. Also the same company that was willing to cancel Project Titan after several years of work and millions of dollars wasted, simply because it wasn’t a fun experience.
---
Enjoy giving them $15/mo when Classic launches!
---
No politics here. Of any kind. For any reason. Thanks.
---
It's as if you didn't read why it would affect him. He wants the experience that is shared on twitch, YouTube and wherever else to remain as close to the original vanilla as possible. A toggle would erase this fidelity.
---
I'm not arguing about whether that's a valid concern or not, but to go around calling people dicks when you don't even read the arguments. That is, in turn, being a dick.
---
So I know there's a lot of hype around 2077, however that game doesnt appeal to me personally. 
---
I haven't tried Witcher 3, however I have heard it is fantastic, maybe I'll get around to playing that. Do you have any other recommendations by them?
---
No problem, Sir 😍
---
No I don’t, I downvoted people making false arguements, downvote me and make personal attacks. Nor have I ever downvoted anyone instantly. I downvoted him after he started making claims I never said And after he instantly downvoted me. But sure, make things up you have no proof about.
---
You however I will downvote right now since your trying to write me off to discredit me with stupid tactics like that AND since it’s off topic.
---
5 years ? I see you're not one of those delusional that think the game will be released at the end of the year.
---
Where will we be in 5 years ? Will the game be released or still "soon TM" :D
---
Old models was one of the first things confirmed, and it was so during the blizzcon beta.
---
Source?
---
&gt; You however I will downvote right now
---
Oh no i'm so scared
---
Pretty sure experienced developers chose what projects they work on at Blizz
---
&gt; I don't want to see their trauma trivialized by allowing the "okay" emote to exist in [Overwatch League](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/04/05/report-blizzard-forbids-okay-symbol-in-overwatch-league-arena-claims-its-a-white-power-symbol/). It's just a meaningless symbol that can be replaced.
---
Laughable.  And yet they talk of “white fragility”
---
I did read. And I don’t Agree. He literally wants other people to be forced to see exactly what he sees. He doesn’t like new modes so I shouldn’t be allowed to use them. That is what I have issue with.
---
Your acting like a child.
---
I feel you man. Yeah I have skipped out on about 90% of the AAA titles for the past few years, I'm typically the person who waits about 3 months before buying any of the hyped up games just to see what the game actually has to offer before buying it, and after seeing reviews of about 90% of the titles I'm originally interested in, it's more than likely a no-buy from me. 
---
I'll have to check out Vermintide, I haven't heard of it before you said anything on it so I'll do some research. Thanks!
---
I’m pretty sure vanguard had zero hype in the mainstream. It’s about the only MMO I never heard come up in general chat on wow, only learned of it after meeting my friend that was a former EQ junkie.
---
MS takes up a debuff slot, that's why Arms sucks.
---
Because they have no way appearenlty to tell the difference between making mining nodes as big as a mountain and making your Draenei a big titty horse cock futa.

So they were 5 when it all began? I doubt it.

Your entire first paragraph was an opinion.
---
We'll see where they draw the lines. Probably wise to let others beta test it first if you value your account.
---
You missed 2 very good builds:
---
19/11/21 for solo play and 8/11/32 for group healing and flag carry.
---
Charge is a must for pvp.
---
They were pretty useless. I didn't take PI and I also didn't take Lightwell or Spirit of Redemption. With 1.12 talents 21/30/0 or 26/25/0 are easily the best healing specs with the last 5 points being either spiritual healing or mental strength. Divine Spirit as a 21 point talent is way more valuable than Lightwell as a 31 point talent.
---
no i think its more, priest is an offensive healer, paladin is an defensive healer
---
For sure. It sucks that the major gaming companies can pump out lackluster product and get away with it because it fits algorithms, it's almost like the Hallmark movie situation where they don't push the boundaries because they're afraid of a big flop. We all saw how FO76 did so hopefully it changes things. 
---
Yeah, I have bought a few games from smaller developers like RoR2, Rocket League, Warframe, etc but nothing really grabs me by the balls and immerses me quite like older WoW and vast adventure games. If you have any recommendations I'm all ears.
---
No personal attacks.
---
Of course, but at the same time I feel like saying they care about the big titty mods then they wouldn’t have let them exist since Vanilla.
---
I made a killing selling 60s with Glider but they eventually got me and I have followed the rules since then. It sucked losing my account, wasn't worth it.

He and others have been personally attacking me the entire time.

Subnautica is a beautiful game. Too bad I have thalassaphobia and I have a fear of deep water lmao. Saw my first reaper, quit on the spot. Jesus that game terrifies me but I love it.
---
I just want to go out deep in the woods and fish
---
I was able to get that feeling a bit again when SWTOR first came out, for like 4-5 months I’d say I enjoyed it nearly as much as vanilla’s heyday. The thing that held it back was its weak BGs.
---
Oddly enough I actually SUUUUPER enjoyed the DBZ mmo too. But it was annoying having to play on an Asian server and using a crappy language mod that only translated like 40% of text, and I was playing solo.
---
No one knows.
---
Fishing!
---
You also get a warning for personal attacks. Don't do that shit.
---
I honestly don't know.  It depends what level water you're fishing in compared to your fishing level.  In the end all that matters is if you have enough fishing level to catch nightfin or squid with fishing pole and lure.  Once you can catch those, it doesn't matter anymore and you will eventually be 300 fishing just from farming them to cook and make money from raid food.
---
If you're Horde, you will get the +25 fishing pole from Hinterlands quest to kill snapjaws outside the village.
---
Otherwise you can farm the crawdad traps in Desolace until you get the Big Iron Fishing Pole, which is +20 fishing.
---
Let's say you had the Big Iron Fishing Pole and some +100 lures...you could catch anything that requires a skill of 300 even if you were only 180 in fishing.
---
With fishing poles and lures, maxing out fishing isn't even required.  It will just eventually happen anyway though.
---
Do you think millennials describes people born in the year 2000?
---
What bis
---
Yeah i watched that when it came out, guess I was just interpreting if wrong. Nice to hear an experienced person talk about it. Thanks for clearing the air, zug zug.
---
I imagine the pservers are accurate in that regard, I don't see them writing custom code to add that kind of feature, but it's possible I suppose. I don't remember how it worked back then either.
---
Normalized procs really only mattered for your autos.  If it had been normalized, the constant hamstringing would have increased its proc rate.  
---
DPS warriors actually didn't have much else to spend rage on.  You had Heroic Strike, which added damage to a regular attack and doesn't generate rage, or bloodthirst (which is still used in 2h fury).   There was also slam which reset your swing timer.  
---
So when you're looking at it, 50 rage for a single bonus auto (Which had +390 attack power or more if the Shaman had the talent) or 15 rage + no rage generation on hit for +157 damage via heroic strike.  The lack of rage generation on the heroic strike really hurts 2h more than 1h also because you don't get as much rage from autos.  Keep in mind, for example, Ashkandi is an average hit of 280 base damage.
---
Making ppl dance after I got my piccolo flute
---
I'd love to see it in action with logs
---
I'm interested in  a Horde cooking guide without Fishing for sure.
---
I remeber it was 5 times as well.
---
And they most likely weren't going to out level you in a few hours time. I still occasionally will make a friend while questing, however say I don't log in for a couple of days. BAM. That friend is now 30 or 40 levels higher and doing different content. The zone scaling has helped this a bit, but I do miss the much slower pacing from Classic.
---
That glitch where you can jump on the torch under the bridge in stormwind then mount on top of it and jump under the map.
---
Yeah I've been considering this. I'm honestly super indecisive, but I do love the role of tanking over the role of DPS.
---
Hi, /u/830audio
---
Really curious if the old IF will be there considering they use the bfa client as base. Same applies to hyjal
---
Balance of course.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gd_iuLuyz8
---
Oh did they revert this change? Last I heard it was going to be a toggleable feature like it was in live, which made sense to me since its only seen by the people who toggle it
---
Imagine upvoting this euphoric fedora drivel.
---
I’m just going to play on whatever it defaults to. Unless it defaults to a pve server, then I’ll pick the first pvp server on the list. But they really haven’t said how the servers will work to my knowledge, so it could be only 1 server per type.
---
Hasn't Camelot Unchained been in beta for over a year?
---
If they release servers that are named the same as they where back in vanilla I’ll be back on my home server from when I started my journey on the horde side.
---
You’re being verbose.  waste time getting hung up on choosing/learning a specific class when you’d be better off just picking one at random.  Many aspects of the game that make a great player are independent of class.  Also you want to learn how to learn to play any class. Know how  to play one class you’re good, but learn them all, and your great.
---
You should probably start looking for a guild. You don't have to by any means, but it will make leveling more enjoyable more than likely give you a home to go to right off the bat. 
---
If you're just going solo and looking for a server, I personally would go to a high population server. There are going to be zergs at launch that will fade away a bit after a while. Those high population servers may go from high to medium really quick. If you're already on a low pop realm you may go from Low pop to dead pop. 
---
There's really know way to tell what servers going to actually be a good server to be on until after launch and after the zerg fades. If you're on a PVP server you're going to want to have a balanced realm of horde / alliance, so possibly finding a server with streamers on it. 1 big Horde streamer and 1 big Alliance streamer that way you know people will always flock to that server. 
---
Just my opinion.
---
Lmao bragging about bwl accomplishments in vanilla, my guild died in naxx homie. If you want to play like trash, do so. When everyone laughs at you, you'll know why.
---
Hit her with a cleanse.
---
Us.
---
You go in the realm list and click a realm.
---
Divine spirit doesn't scale with the number of people who spec it.  Lightwell does.  Lightwell's great in plenty of naxx fights.  Wait let me rephrase that. Since this is 1.12 and you get lightwell for every raid, it's great for plenty of fights period.
---
Everyone look at this cherry picked article!  Any organization that isn’t perfect is outright evil!
---
God knows and the devil has some hints. :)
---
I posted this exact thing like 2 weeks ago lol. Correlation between my f5 key breaking and blue posts. Work has shitty keyboards, I've been through 2 of them in th last 6 months.
---
Go herbalism/engineering. Doesn't take long to do an orb run or a scholomance for some dark runes and other stuff. Just make sure you've got a somewhat decent group. Make pals with a tank, especially paladin tank and those runs will go really quick. 
---
Also you don't really spend that much gold on consumes anyways, it's mainly mana potions and you don't need to use the big ones until like AQ and Naxx. 
---
But for solo farming stuff I would recommend going disc instead of holy. I mean you should be disc anyways because PI is much better and more fun than 10% healing.
---
Yeah I don't mind simpler rotations and more looking/reacting at what happens in the raid. And in most cases the "react to a proc" gameplay doesn't feel very rewarding, except Nightfall ofc ;)
---
They had addons back then in Vanilla...
---
Thanks, that's the kind of info I needed. I'll try to get a list of streamers. I am in no rush so I will probably wait a few days before choosing a high pop realm.
---
I don't think you understand how much of a joke the tuning on this boss is. There is two, maybe 3 guilds in the whole world that might be able to kill it without a nerf. And yes, they 3 heals and stack locks just because the dps check is stupid high. I mean, they use two shaman ankh per pull. The thing that is wrong with waiting for next tower's loot, is why the fuck would you release an unkillable boss? C'thun was fixed in vanilla.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMGsZfhtIcbVZx

Something like that.

Is it wrong that before I even chuckled the word “functional” came to mind?
---
So are you just going to keep reposting this video until it get upvoted?
---
Where did I ever say someone was angry?

Cause the closes has been me saying people have been doing personal attacks at me.
---
Warlock MASTER RACE
---
I miss the old way corporate webpages were done for people who can read and not some big pictures/graphics/no real info websites for monkeys. :)
---
I guess we're evolving...
---
&gt;Okay well, in regards to what? Don’t you think you need some examples here instead of just speaking vaguely?
---
No, I don't really think I need examples, as it is widely know to anyone that follows Blizzard games and the community around them. I assume you do as well since you are even discussing this. People are fed up with how they butcher WoW and don't even realize what it is they need to fix. Then OW started great but quickly turned into a game balanced for Esports, thus breaking it for the majority. Starcraft isn't fucked, but that is a game from when they were held in high regard. It is still great, though - but you can hardly blame people for not counting it towards recent success. And that leaves Diablo as the last of their main franchises - where they went and shat on the Diablo community.
---
So to sum up, 3 out of 4 of their main franchises, which have all been beloved and had a fierce fanbase, have been turned for the worse.
---
&gt; Isn’t that exactly what people love about Blizzard? Taking their time to release good games? 
---
Yes, it is - the important thing being "release good games". It's not like we care about them taking long time, that is something we tolerate in order to get something worthwhile. The problem here is people have no faith in the games being good, even if they take time. It is not something new, this is something they have shown over years now. If they make something amazing, then great - but most people don't have faith in that.
---
&gt;What does it matter if a totally unrelated studio is making a mobile game under the Diablo name? Diablo 4 is still coming out at some point.
---
To me it matters because the whole thing showed what I already knew from WoW, but hoped was not totally true - they don't understand their community as they used to. To me a bad game once in a while doesn't really matter, as long as the company understand the community I will have faith in that company. This is why I'm a fan of CDPR, it honestly seems like they *get* their fans. 
---
&gt;I don’t play retail, so I don’t know much about the state of the game other than fans seem to be looking forward to the latest patch changes.
---
No, they don't. It's actually funny if you follow more closely what happens to WoW atm, people are actually not as ragey as they usually are, but that does not mean they are happy about it. BellularGaming have done quite some good videos on it, and it seems from some analysis of the community that people simply does not *care* anymore. People being angry about the game is obviously not ideal, but it shows people still care. Once the players stop caring about the game then you have a real problem.
---
As for OW, I love the game and I wholeheartedly love how Jeff communicate, but I can see why many people have problems with it. This actually goes for all I'm saying, I'm explaining why people have a problem with Blizzard - personally I do have some problems with them as well, but far from how much many other people have. The thing is, I can still understand why people feel like they do and honestly I think it is justified.
---
&gt;Do you think it’s in Blizzard’s interest to upset fans and consumers? How would that make any sense?
---
Never have I said that, actually what I'm saying is the opposite. Wanting to upset the fans would require them to understand the fans and their likes and dislikes - my point is it seems like Blizzard no longer understand this.
---
I can see you just judge me as yet another Blizzard hater. I really do not hate them as much as many do, but it really is understandable why people say Blizzard is shit compared to what it used to be. Personally I just look forward to Classic, WCIII reforged and casual OW, but to be completely honest that is only because I'm done being angry at WoW and Diablo being ruined - I have simply accepted that those games are over for me. Still, the fact that I have to  accepting that some of the big francises that I used to love are not worth it anymore could probably quite reasonably be summed up as "Blizzard have gone to shit".
---
If you'd watch the whole panel you'd see that it's true.
---
Imagine writing paragraphs getting rapidly upset about a help organization not wanting their symbol associated with violent games.  Wow those evil suits!
---
using potential world first raid compositions as arguments against retail wew lad
---
but its the first decision you make
---
For anyone who doesnt know what he is looking at: This is Methods lineup in the current raid progression. Their lineup consists of   
---
12 warlocks   
---
2 priests (2x heal)   
---
2 monks (2x tank)   
---
1 druid   
---
1 mage   
---
1 demon hunter   
---
1 shaman
---
We can always talk about adding new content post Naxx!
---
Or class balance!
---
I can give you an in depth guide to doing it while leveling if you are alliance, but based on your flair I'm guessing that'd be useless to you. :P
---
The plot thickens...
---
That would make it easy if that's the case but I expect that many people will want to try so with only one server, it is going to be problematic.
---
Core-hound Gloves from MC and Cthuns dagger are the two off the top of my head. Had to use them on my NE warrior lol
---
Paladin is probably the easiest healer in PvP. Just keep freedom up on the warrior and keep him alive. Use engineering to get away from the enemy team, blessing of sacrifice on another target to keep you out of sheep. Your heals are short and effective. Very easy to learn. When you've learnt that then you can start pushing the hybrid shockadin/healing paladins that are scary as fuck for the Horde. You need some T2 and a few special weapons and items but it's extremely fun to play. 
---
And if in doubt, bubble hearthstone out ;)
---
There are so many threads on this already.  Search the reddit
---
Hmm... Now you've got me thinking...
---
Did you also know this is for world first? Can't balance the classes around what world first mythic raiders use for **ONE** boss in a raid.
---
Well put op, my toughts excactly
---
Are you suggesting that a tightly run raiding guild must accept your lackadaisical style and invite you to raids and hand you gear or else it's because the elitists are ruining the game? Or are you suggesting that there will be no guilds for you that match your play style and speed? Because based on your post it has to be one of those two.
---
It’s what I find if I google the subject. I can’t personally verify if it is like that in the game.
---
Is that what they are still trying?  I thought they moved on from that comp
---
yup. OPs reasoning is the equivalent of "all movies nowadays are cookie cutter builds, so I stop watching movies". Completely ignoring the fact that this is mainly true for blockbusters and there are tons of creative and original movies out there - more than ever. And the same is true for the gaming market. Just ignore all those COD, Assassins Creed, Fifa, etc games.
---
Also the dispensers have different times for when they need refueling. Maybe there's some subscription service on mountain dew , hot pockets and insulin from the manufacturer.
---
Propably more expensive then going to the store though, the leeches.

Yeah! That's what I'm talking about. That's some quality Goof-off right there. Just relaxing, shooting the shit, and making the world seem that much more alive!
---
Standard Vanilla/Classic ones and toggeble to the recent one i think.
---
This was one of my favorite things to do in Stormwind. That and getting up on top of the Goldshire Inn with painfully precise jumping
---
Oh good, so I can look pretty but tell people I'm using old graphics so they dont get mad at me :3
---
You will be fine, and if you do find a fun Warrior to play with and you start useing voiceip. Then he will call for  dispells, freedoms and sac and cooldowns he wants. Just if you where to do 2v2.  
---
Find a fun person to play with, that helps you grow, and is good at keeping and eye on you. And pvp healing will be easy and fun.
---
if you dont stand up the dvt clots wont dislodge. just sit still and the legs will drop off eventually
---
&gt; Other than a few Bioware games from almost a decade ago and the Witcher series I've seldom felt much satisfaction from AAA-production level games since WoW was released.
---
Nintendo is still making amazing games. Can recommend.
---
My thoughts, exactly. I wish I had the time now, that I did then, when I was 20. I'm excited for the release, but I fear that it'll slowly drop off due to lack of time.
---
I can wait and fish all day!
---
Why on earth would they demand engineering on all mains? 
---
I mean, there’s overkill and just being stupid, this sounds like a guild populated with the latter.
---
Sad but true
---
These are the people ruining retail :(
---
A quality sarcasm post always makes me do a double take to see if the person was actually trying to be serious.  :)
---
But is it really min-max to raid as the correct spec? If I turn up as a shadowpriest with 100 +heal and claim I can heal an AQ40 raid they will laugh in my face. If I say I'm PvPing as a shockadin/healing paladin but I have +500 heal and a brain then I'll most likely get into an MC raid, hell even BWL and AQ40. 
---
You have to view min-maxing with some perspective. Usually the better the guild is, the more meme-specs are allowed in the raid because being attentive and good at playing your class vastly outweighs having the correct spec. Notable exceptions being speedruns of course.
---
You want to raptor strike so it doesn’t glance, and if horde use a wing clip to try and proc Windfury (if applicable).
---
Thanks man I really appreciate it look forward to playing with this build for classic
---
What are you even talking about, animate, bug fix? Those models and animations have been made 15 years ago.
---
Your guild died in naxx.
---
My guild cleared Naxx.
---
I don't know what they tought you in primary school, but I would revisit those lessons about reading comprehension again if I were you. I repeat the first sentence of my last post:
---
**Sunshine, other than you, I cleared content in Vanilla.**
---
Clearing content means: MC, ZG, BWL, AQ20, AQ40, Naxx. All of it. In Vanilla, not some shitty private server with made up numbers.
---
And now go away, I'm getting bored.
---
My point stands, slow hard hitting weapon, seems good.
---
talk about uniformed
---
Orc Female Rogue
---
Same as I did in Vanilla. High pop, low latency, PVP server.
---
Yeah, I prefer not be useless like you.
---
Female Human Warrior
---
Tbh they really should shut down their servers.. god riddance
---
nope, I made the screenshot just before posting it here
---
This! I was a kid when classic was released so the game should be possible for unexperienced pc players. 
---
Also classic was a lot about story and not only about gameplay.
---
Did questie exist during vanilla? I always thought it was created by team private server.
---
Of course.
---
You're a dick and I'm glad to have given you your 69th upvote
---
This would be a decent strategy if they want to reduce that initial launch day hammer.
---
At the same time, if you do this you can't cause a hype train of people getting other people excited and interested in playing.
---
Guilds competing for world firsts generally have most of their core raiders having multiple alts they can play well so they can stack classes based on needs on bosses. This doesn't really reflect what a normal class setup would look like.
---
Private servers are harder than vanilla was 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Now I know you're fucking with me lmao
---
My current thoughts are:
---
If the ppl im gonna play with decide to play Alliance i'm gonna play:
---
Main - Gnome female Mage with herb/alc
---
PVP-fool around - Male dwarf shadowpriest with tailoring/enchanting
---
Moneymaker/gatherer - Human male rogue with mining/skinning (not so sure about this...any suggestions on other classes for this?)
---
if horde then undead mage/priest and Orc rogue.
---
They're a small, albeit loud, subset of people.  Dont worry about it.
---
World First race comp does not equal current balance correctness.  
---
Method does everything possible to get world first; cleverly avoiding mechanics by class stacking is only one of them. Before this they were trying 6 Warlocks and 6 Shamans. It didn’t work.
---
I think that nobody can tell you which server will end up being low or high pop. Also, if You're from EU region there is a possibility to end up on a server that is a Non-English Speaking Community Realm.
---
Human male Warlock
---
Oh I might have been thinking of quest helper
---
No one cares btw
---
yeah, I know that.   
---
yes, I am aware of that.   
---
You can read this post in 2 ways:   
---
1) Just take it at a mild joke   
---
2) Interpret it as a jab towards people who complain about class balance, because classes will never be truly balanced until they take away literally everything that makes them unique in any way. But yeah, I prefer 1).
---
There is no Boom in Oom!
---
Hopefully they add a whole new world. Outlands seems like a good place. Maybe an increased level cap to 70 or so.
---
i find this very precise not only for WoW but every aspect of e-gaming. they just don’t get it
---
If something's self-centered it's the demand to have a button that makes other people's characters unrecognizable. It's like cosmetic phasing.
---
I know I want to play hunter, but I'm having trouble deciding between tauren or orc. Maybe orc since I'm planning on making a tauren druid later. IDK
---
feral cat 
---
\- the feet slot shows the  "Sandstalker Ankleguards" (bracers) - should show  "Swiftwalker Boots"
---
\- weapon enchants -  "Superior Striking" will probably not work in cat/bear?
---
general
---
boot enchant are all "Minor Speed" - sure, nice, but better than Greater Stamina/Greater Agility?
---
Yea well your "joke" is trash.
---
What lol? Wanting an option so that you can choose to use old models or new ones is self centered?
---
Sure...
---
What textures they created a couple years ago are going to be in classic?
---
I have a custom-built rig with a 50" 4k screen and a 1080 GTX. I unironically play vanilla on this thing at 1024x768, capped at 40fps. It just doesn't feel the same running it with modern specs.
---
Orc warrior main and undead rogue alt, yeah, I'm a cliche, fight me.
---
What about bone slicing hatchets? Or will those not be in, yet?
---
Why do you care about how other people spend their time?
---
A lot of this is literally people joking, yeah there will be some people who will go balls to the wall and shit....but why do you care if they do?
---
Chill.
---
aye
---
Well, humor is subjective. So is being polite, apparently.
---
Idk why you care.  These are reddit posts and they're getting you in a tizzy?
---
Thing is, I'm really not telling anyone what to do, I'm just providing common sense and advice on why you shouldn't fuck your life up over a video game, despite it being the best.      
---
However the general reaction of the sub was that of an immature 16 year old who talks back to his parents when they tell him he needs to go outside after having spent the month of vacations without seeing sunlight. Vitamin D is good, sitting around all day will kill you, these are absolute truths no one can deny, except in this echo chamber.
---
My take from this is that really none of these people ever grew or became adults, they're just man children who can't wait to get back to their favorite thing, even if it kills then, which it might very well may. I'm an adult and I still love video games more than any other form of entertainment, but should I stopped working out, start neglecting my family and responsabilites I sure as shit would love for someone to sit me down and tell em exactly what I've stated above.
---
I want old animations with new textures/models
---

Please delete this monstrosity of a comment

Yes it's very true and not uncommon at all the world first mythic raiders class stack for certain fights.
---
You can also just watch a video of timecop doing it
---
Gnome Warrior.
---
Heck, I remember doing 10-man Shadowfang Keep because it was way too difficult at lv 18-20.
---
We zerged that place down twice and everyone was happy.
---
If it's not out in 5 years I will have already given up hope lol.
---
I think we are in agreement on the technicality, but I'm trying to argue stats and weapon dps matter much more than speed. As a general rule fast weapons are fine as an offhand, provided they have good stats.
---
I was under the impression you were arguing that you shouldn't use a fast offhand at all.
---
Oh my god, thanks for that memory lol.
---
A slightly more streamlined version of this is:
---
* 60:   Charred Wolf Meat and Spiced Wolf Meat , Boar Meat alternatives (Recipe is off trainer)
---
Meat of Wolfs in Mulgore and Boars in Durotar.
---
* 90:   Strider Stew (Recipe in XR, west outside inn)
---
Meat off Striders in Barrens 
---
* 100: Boiled Clams, Crab Cake (Recipes off trainer)
---
Meats off mobs at Zoram Strand
---
* 110: Crispy Lizard Tails (Recipe in XR, west outside inn )
---
Thunder Lizards in Southern Barrens and Stonetalon
---
* 125: Big Bear Steak (Recipe from quest in Hillsbrad)
---
Bears of all levels in Hillsbrad Foothills
---
* 150: Hot Lion Chopss (Recipe in XR, Butcher)
---
Lions in Hillsbrad Foothills
---
* 175: Goblin Deviled Clams (Recipe off trainer)
---
Naga in Hillsbrad, and other things near water
---
* 225: Soothing Turtle Bisque (Cooking Quest in Tarren Mill)
---
Turtles next to Tarren Mill, Turtles at Shimmering Flats
---
* 275: Tender Wolf Steak (Butcher NPC in Tanaris)
---
Journeyman - Trainer
---
Expert - Vendor at Shadowprey Village, Desolace
---
Artisan - See [Zamja](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=3399) at 225 cooking
---
The quest chain (it's only a quest to talk to the dude in gadgetzan then the main quest) for Artisan requires:
---
12 x Giant Egg (Off Owlkins in the Hinterlands and others)
---
10 x Zesty Clam meat (Turtles in Tanaris drop the clams)
---
20 x Alterac Swiss (Quite a few Innkeepers sell this in zones higher than level 30 or so)
---
This guide should require VERY little going out of your way. It should also require fairly little grinding you wont be doing anyway.
---
Male Undead rogue.
---
Imagine you had an hour to play.  
---
Imagine person ‘A’ picks a random class and plays for 1 hour.  
---
Person ‘B’ spends 30 minutes deliberating on what class to play, then plays for 30 minutes.  All things being equal I’d say person ‘A’ is likely a better player than person ‘B’
---
Cheers look forward to the info
---
Luckily I have a phone!!
---
I guess I'd like to see the community grow mature, but the neckbeard roots are strong.
---
the biggest tragedy was when he was removed in the redux.... for why?
---
Yup, same advice I was going to give.  Only issue I see is with how many people you are trying to keep together, you won’t all be able to group to do quests (if I remember correctly), because most quests will be disable in a raid group
---
Time to resurrect (pun intended) my old Forsaken Shadow priest!

It technically is.  But maybe a half dozen hunters in the game. Be able to take advantage of it.

In WoW Classic, you’ll have the following character limits per WoW account:
---
* A maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm
---
* A maximum of 50 characters across all of the WoW Classic realms in your region
---
* Only one faction per realm on PvP realms
---
* No overlap or regard with the character limits in Battle for Azeroth
---
You’ll be able to have up to 50 Battle for Azeroth characters and up to 50 WoW Classic characters at the same time.
---
 In WoW Classic, you’ll have the following character limits per WoW account:
---
Male Undead Priest
---
They are all shit in comparison to Barb.
---
Barb: 145 AP + 1.37% crit
---
For a warrior especially, get those quests done for xp! Especially for weapon and armor rewards. Maybe look at quest plus grind on rested, and slot in dungeons for gear.
---
Not the Blue post that I wanted but thanks anyways Blizz.
---
Good news to hear but hopefully not the only news we will hear for the week.
---
Official quote and image of the blue post
---
First
---
Any news is better than no news I guess, sort of a weird update though. Was there ever a lot of doubt about character limits? I guess I don't know how it works on retail anymore.
---
Yeah, this ones pretty underwhelming, but at least it's something?
---
Real shit, if they ever want to add "updated" models. They will need to make new updated models as the current "updated" models and animations are dog (you allready know)
---
Guild leader &gt; guild leader's gf &gt; guild leader's irl friends &gt; officers &gt; plebs
---
Main: Undead warlock
---
alt: Tauren druid
---
In short: Exactly as it was in vanilla :-)
---
Good job Blizzard!
---
Blizzard is just cock teasing us now... CHARACTER LIMITS!? Give us a release date! This information is minimal!
---
I'm quite the masterbaiter myself!
---
Yay, one faction per realm, dope.
---
My man!
---
Human Paladin. I love to torture myself.
---
Female Troll Priest
---
Sounds good to me.
---
It's news I guess. Hopefully just getting us to pay attention for tomorrow's sticky post.
---
Not disagreeing with you but I think a lot of that can be said of retail and r/wow.  The community is always going to favor the perceived “best” spec/class/comp etc.  Never gonna be fair and it’s not always a representation of whats truly best but it’s only natural for that attitude to dominate.  Doesn’t mean you can’t make sub-optimal specs work, you just gotta accept that you’re going to have a handicap in the eyes of many
---
#YES! 
---
I was stressing a bit of who I'd delete to make room for Classic characters.  This is fantastic news.
---
Honestly I'm just happy they're putting in the effort to put out weekly blue posts, even if it is just confirming something most of us assumed they weren't going to screw up.
---
Knowing that you can't have characters from different factions on the same PvP server is good news though.
---
Saw it on youtube
---
 Only one faction per realm on PvP realms. Finally we get this again, for many years now i have really disliked how pservers do it.
---
Yeah It's probably not coming out for two more years, realistically.
---
#YES!
---
This is fantastic news for Altoholics.  I was stressing a bit over who I'd have to delete to make room for Classic characters.
---
It's a funny story. I was on the run doing LBRS, dropped to sleep, and the group went on with a PUG rogue. They did UBRS, and the striker dropped. He got it, and then later joined the guild. In the end we got a good rogue out of the deal, but needless to say everybody who was on the run would constantly link me felstriker.
---
I would go with something similar to C.
---
There is no healer item in the game that provides a power spike like Ashkandi does for warriors in PvP so I don't see how you could make that comparison. I can't help you understand if you are not a PvP'er good sir.
---
Let's see how all the streamers are going to make a 10+ minute video out of this.
---
Yes I know, but are the new models going to even be an option?
---
ITT  nobody watching the video
---
Has our "weekly" news ever came in the form of a reply and not a standalone post? I NEED MORE!!!!!!
---
try again
---
H
---
Ok. Good luck finding warriors for your guild that would let that slide.
---
I've seen so many "I'm thinking about rolling warlock or ___" lately and with the recent surveys I think we're going to have a flood of warlocks upon release.
---
They haven't said anything about that. Probably more concerned with bug fixes and getting everything right.
---
So does that mean 5 realms per region?
---
Don't insult his gods, puny mortal!
---
LOL yeah, but thats why I said "LFR", Mythic is much much harder than Classic was, and significantly less forgiving
---
&gt;Some people introduce their family to it and play with them. Others just schedule the time and try to work an agreement with the family to have the time set aside.
---
My partner plays wow, but our kid is too young - its a fun activity to do together but i wouldnt say its quality time and me playing that late would mean she always has to go to bed alone. I agree with the time set aside - but atleast for me, 25 hours would be an unreasonable tamount of time to set aside.   
---
Like i said im just curious how people would fit that much playtime into family life, i'd be impressed if i got to play for 25 hours in a month let alone a week.
---
i.e. 5 raid squads at hogger.
---
not sure how I missed that and I'm not sure how to edit a title... even worse, I don't play huntards &gt;.&lt;
---
My best recent recommendations for a WoW fan would be Subnautica and Divinity Original Sin 2. They're very different games but I think they tick some of the same boxes as WoW. Subnautica especially sucked me in more than any game in the last 5 years, and I'm not even that big on survival games.
---
Thanks I'll check it out
---
Literally every fight where DPS matters.
---
Im glad we get updated once in a while... I am so hyped for release date!
---
Lightwell healing breaks on receiving damage, doesn't benefit from + healing and has 10 charges which can accidentally be spam clicked through.
---
Lightwell isn't good in fights where there is residual damage because the effect breaks and it isn't good in fights where there isn't residual damage because DPS doesn't need healing.
---
Loatheb is basically the only fight where Lightwell has a legitimate niche.
---
Been havin a lot of fun with Elder Scrolls Online
---
Man, I’m so hooked on this stuff that even this little bit feeds the fire and gets me excited.
---
Am I raiding Onyxia? Cause it sure looks like I’m chasing the dragon.
---
Perfect.Henry Canvill was an avid WoW player back in the day
---
mediumsized game studios are also awesome. Divinity Original Sin 2 is an awesome CRPG!
---
Probably a dumb place to grind, but I AOE grinded SM GY for ages once I hit 60 to fund my epic mount. The time flew by though, I don't remember it taking that many runs.
---
That the red cross symbol was being devalued?
---
"should the activities undermine respect for the emblem or the ICRC logo or detract from the prestige which is attached to them" - International  Committee of the Red Cross
---
Devalue and detract are synonyms if you were unaware, and the use was deemed unlawful.  Try to be a little more kind to people who share their life experiences and your community members.
---
I can understand why PServers did it, if there is only 1 PvP megaserver it would suck if you had to delete your character to roll on the other faction. It did hurt the community and make cross faction collusion easier but I did understand it. That being said on Classic because of B-Net integration and people having multiple accounts, cross faction shenanigans will occur this just makes it a little harder.
---
Holy cow, this community is so melodramatic.
---
Close, it was actually Moki though. It's talked about in this ancient thread:

Well, that’s something anyways.
---
A little rude and over-the-top for a reply to a non-aggressive explanation.
---
Me and some friends are still debating on which faction we join but if we go alliance ill make a gnome warlock if we go horde ill make an undead mage.
---
Thanks man!
---
Right on dude, looks like you're on the right track.
---
Vermintide2 is basically a dark-fantasy Left for Dead spinoff at its core, but also incorporates Diablo-style RPG and loot elements + various achievements, hardmodes, etc. This game works on a lot of different levels, it can be a relaxing/fun/enegetic romp with friends or a completely insane, fast and furious all out holy-shit-fest (also fun btw). 
---
In addition, VT2 has the most satisfying Melee combat of any game I've ever played; This is made all the more impressive by the fact that it's a first-person hack and slash. I usually find first-person melee experiences (ala The Elder Scrolls) to be quite underwhelming, but Vermintide's Dodge + Parry + Block system flows so smooth and the feedback is just incredible, hacking hordes of rats to bits has never been so satisfying. Plus the Warhammer Fantasy setting is pretty bomb.
---
VT2 is amazing, but the first game was kinda mediocre, wouldn't bother with #1.
---
Cheers dude.
---
They'll shard, because they don't want to have a zillion dead servers after all the tourists are gone.
---
Not really. I play indie games as well. Rocket League, Risk of Rain 2, Slay the Spire, Warframe, Subnautica, etc. Nothing just has just caught my attention and kept it there.
---
Jesus, I still get 2-3 mbps.
---
That horse is mighty high for someone so condescending! Hooray internets!!!! It's a game dude.... REEELAX
---
He means the corrupted blood incident
---
Dwarf priest or pally, still haven’t decided.
---
Remember: This is not "news". This is an answer to a question in a regular forum post.
---
With the proper macros and spell selections, you will do very well as resto.  Obviously you won't be able to keep up with the best priests, but I was able to get top healing on some fights where I was healing the MT.  Plus when there are only 1 or 2 druids in your raid, the gear comes quickly.
---
Everyone saying "Look at indie games" is missing the point. There will never again be a game of WoW's scope and budget that won't have microtransactions out the wazoo and that won't be dumbed down for the lowest common denominator. Maybe there won't be one even with these things period, I'm not aware of any huge open world MMOs in development right now. All the money lies in mobile games now, pandering to people with a penchant for gambling and generally dumb people who are easily parted with their money and no investor is going to approve a costly MMORPG with a limited target audience.
---
Nothing surprising here.  
---
My question is could there be some information they are getting ready to share, where this particular drop of info will matter?  Realm size maybe?
---
no
---
Call it how I see it brother also don't really care, i used the word trash get over it.
---
Yeah agreed - I mained a shaman all the way up to 4horsemen in Naxx, the debuff cleansing and need for constant (downranked) heal spam doesn't leave much mana or GCD to totem twist. just pick a layout for each fight, watch your timers, and keep them centrally located, pretty simple.
---
I understood that reference.
---
I thought natures swiftness was a must for pvp
---
Dude I love Subnautica. But the thing is that I have thalassaphobia, which is a fear of deep water. I love the game, but I can't play it for more than 15 minutes lmao. I got to the island somehow, scanned everything possibly there, and I quit because something in the back of my head said I was going to die when I got back in the water lol. Great game, just can't play it like others can. 
---
Divinity Original Sin 2 is something I've never actually read up on, so I'll give that a try. Thanks for the recommendations!
---
You have invulnerability potions on horde as well as alliance.
---
We need to hear about realm population caps.
---
FYI this blue post was a reply to someone’s question - it is not likely to be our only weekly update
---
thats just a meme and some amusement for patchwerk fights. no good hunter is actually serious about it
---
This was a reply to someone’s question. Hopefully we get a new post tomo!
---
Every time there is a regular AoE that will cause you to drain the healers mana even more, causing early OOMs and a wipe.
---
These 2 specs are better than all the ones listed in op.       
---
There's really only 2 effective styles of play for a druid in vanilla pvp.   
---
1. Kite the shit out of everything. Lots of heal spells, some dmg spells.    
---
2. Kite the shit out of everything. Mix of damage and heals spells.  
---
With that in mind, deep feral doesn't make the cut. With 11 points you get brutal impact and charge. The only other thing maybe worth building around is HotW but it just isn't a strong enough talent in PvP considering what you give up sinking so many points in feral. HotW specs are nice for people that want to mix it up with mainly PvE tanking/healing and some PvP on the side, but they are not good actual pvp specs.    
---
With that out of the way, you options are basically having good healing (ie swiftmend/imp regrowth), or getting some burst damage (vengeance/nature's grace).  
---
The problem with going the damage route is now you really want to get +dmg gear, and the only options are epic pvp set or aq 2.5 and dmg trinkets. If that gear is a possibility than the spec can work. It won't be as strong in 1v1 compared to a healing spec, but you are more useful in most many group pvp situations. Wearing cloth just for damage is a meme for pvp videos. Fun for sure, but you explode the second a warrior/rogue/hunter targets you in actual pvp.  
---
Healing (Shapeshifter/Charge/Swiftmend) is the more meta and easy to gear for spec. It's the best 1v1 spec for sure. The problem is in group pvp you now have very little to offer offensively. Your burst healing is good, but efficiency is very poor and without any magic dispel offensive or defensive you're a poor pure support class.
---
I hope there is more, but theres only 1 business day left so I'm not trying to have high expectations.
---
If you pick up Holy Nova you have a few good farming options such as the lashers in DM east.
---
I think of down ranking as just having more spells.

---
That's why I made it 🤣
---
&gt; if you are good enough.
---
Which 90+% of players wont be. Remember, its just us tryhards who hang around on the forums.
---
Warrior. Not sure on race yet. Dwarf or Tauren, Alliance vs Horde as a whole is the biggest question for me.
---
I've been at the limit for ages.  I was worried about having to go back and delete old characters to play on Classic.  This is fantastic news for me.
---
The problem is that I can't think of a single melee weapon made with hunters specifically in mind until AQ, and even then, it was \*one\* one hander.  (Lok'delar doesn't count).
---
I wouldn't say that Asscandy is BiS outside of PvP, but hunters are going to get a load of shit for any melee weapon they take if it's an upgrade for a melee class, even if it's a marginal upgrade for them and BiS at that phase for a hunter.
---
Just like back in the day.  
---
&gt;Only one faction per realm on PvP realms  
---
This is especially reassuring .
---
Which is funny because my backup personal keyboard is a dell generic one from early 2000 you can’t kill that thing.
---
Not game breaking nor is it a bug.
---
The high fidelity option that was available during the demo
---
Didn't some guilds run 8 tanks on Four Horseman?

Let's see all the redditors rushing to make a comment about the youtubers rushing to make a 10 minute video about this

I would kill you and the other alliance dude.

Lok'tar Ogar
---
&gt; Let's all hope WoW:Classic is a colossal success so Blizzard will release The Burning Crusade in the future
---
You had me up until that last bit there. I had a blast with TBC at the time, but in hindsight it sowed the seeds of most of the changes that ultimately made the game what it is today.
---
I'd much rather Blizzard go the OSRS route with Classic. Take the good bits of TBC and Wrath (class/spec design from the former, all the delicious lore from the latter) and leave the rest (basically everything else).
---
May I ask why? I mean, if a priest needs a druids innervate to stay relevant who's the real oomer? I know that an innervate on a priest will have more value. However.... It feels kind of wrong.
---
And that's why i play feral, i don't have the improved mark of the wild from talent so i don't have to buff anyone **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**
---
What are the key differences between mage or warlock that would make you want to play warlock?
---
I often see people toting that mage is best, most played class, I also played mage, but why would one want to play warlock over mage? (as a cloth-wearer who doesn't want to be a priest).
---
The guy is looking for a spec that does multiple things at once without needing to respec. Did what I could
---
And here I am, in 2019, downloading at 250 kbps...
---
only 50? Psssh. Unsubbed.
---
Really hope you don’t have kids lol
---
Red equals dead. You're on a PVP server, you join the fight.
---
Pros:  it's more fun, it's harder to be ganked, you can potentially do elite quests as you get them.
---
Cons:  it's sort of slower (depending on classes).  One of you will end up having to wait sometimes.  Can be annoying to handle class quests if one of you has them.
---
Quest look will be handled as it was in vanilla I think.
---
That’s actually crazy fast!  I remember my computer having something 50kbs or something.  Downloading patches would sometimes take a full day.
---
This...is garbage. Release date or bust!!!!
---
For some people this might be trivial news, but for those who have a lot of retail characters this is a really important confirmation.
---
I mean I'm not going back to retail anyway, but having to delete characters in advance is nice to know. Thanks blue guy!
---
Party questing takes forever.
---
Haha I believe it was "HUNTAR WEAPON" they spammed in /2

---
Coolio!
---
It seems you're under the impression I sued Blizzard personally and had the colors changed.  You should direct your projection to the ICRC because they probably stay off Reddit like you mentioned.
---
Expect green colors because you're wrong.  Sorry.
---
Let them duke it out. If ally loses, kill the opposite faction then Rez ally.
---
Does cloth turn-in work in this patch? Since jewelcrafting is post vanilla
---
yeah you can have both in pve, I remember from TBC it was the same.
---
If my teammate looks like they have it under control I'm not going to ruin their 1v1. Unless I'm ranking, then you better believe I'm stealing that honor.
---
Yeah one of the few totally great features in modern WoW
---
Surviv.io
---
I know the BR genre is getting milked dry at this point, but I fucking love this game.  It's super simple, and stupid fun.  This is what will be holding me over until classic launches, and even then I'll probably be squeezing in rounds while on flight paths.
---
Yeah because we are all sitting here dreaming we could go back to cata/mop 😐
---
You'll probably make more than enough money on your main if you're a mage with Herb
---
The bidet is made in Japan or Malaysia, but specially designed for the American market - hence the weight rating.
---
On a pvp server you always help. Otherwise is unacceptable.

Youre 16 minutes too late with ur comment.

You got us there, lol

&gt;Art assets are stored in the client, which was always available even to public.
---
Art assets are stored in the client, but not necessarily in the format necessary for actual development.
---
Internal stress tests can be used effectively for some things, but not for everything. It's incredibly difficult and often not worthwhile to configure tests of 1 million+ people pounding different parts of the system at all times.

5 charges.

I guess you mean periodic damage.  Saph is really the only fight where periodic damage precludes use of lightwell.  It's even good on patch for locks. And I don't know how you're not getting this, but only one dude needs divine spirit.

Oh, didn't know you and Talona were dating! Ha, I bet you two have a lot of drama filled memories. Relationships and WoW were always a shitshow. Remember the Lovelychobo Miyavi "spectacle?" Yeah, I'm sure you two would have fit right into to Drama as they were big into loyalty and had almost a family atmosphere. DnT was a bit more strict but it was pretty late in the game by the time I was recruited by them so I can't really speak to them. Funny enough, I actually left like 5 RL friends behind in Drama when I joined DnT. I regret nothing :), hahaha.

blood elf demon hunter
---
Still much rather take something useful that deals damage than mortal strike which doesn't have any effect on bosses.
---
Man, I want to like Nintendo. I really do. They're doing just about everything right from a game design/play standpoint.
---
The problem is virtually everything they make has absolutely zero appeal for me.
---
Breath of the Wild looks awesome. I'm sure I'd have a blast playing it. But that's literally the only Nintendo title I give a crap about and I'm not going to buy a Switch for one game.
---
Which isn't to say I think they're doing anything wrong, quite the opposite; I just hate that I'm obviously not part of their target market and they clearly have no interest in changing that.
---
Likes others said the limit used to be 5, but yeah

No worries, it's a fun image either way.

Yeah man I’m watching it right now. 
---
That said why wouldn’t you? People complain about how easy WoW is all the time. Blizzard has made getting max level characters easy and getting them geared a joke. Class stacking, as much as I don’t like it, isn’t an excuse for lack of progression at the highest level anymore. 
---
I heard merhod has had a 2% wipe, so with stacking he is killable in current gear. And haven’t the best guilds in the world only had 12 weeks of farm in DazarAlor, so they aren’t BiS are they? (I know they fucked with how gear works 1-2 expansions ago, is bis even possible?)
---
Also if we assume uunat mythic is for those who’ve cleared mythic jaina, that’s only just over 500 guilds. She was made to be hard af for those guilds, considering she came out now and not 6 weeks from now with 6 more full mythic clears and over 1000 guilds prepared to take her on.
---
&lt;Completion&gt; Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore
---
Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild called &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community.  Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.
---
Who are we?
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2006, and our leaders have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.
---
Who are we looking for?
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40 man roster. We expect our raiders to have extensive knowledge of their class and their role. Prior boss knowledge and research is preferred but not required if you're playing at the appropriate level. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community. 
---
What will we be doing?
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use an all or nothing DKP system for loot.  We will likely add an additional optional weekend day during BWL and onwards. We will offer spots to all specs so long as the dedication to play is there, though non meta spec spots will be very competitive. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process.  Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.
---
Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.
---
They should be in and are a viable alternative as well as the Doom's Edge from bwl trash but not bis. These are better for alliance though as they are agi and scale with kings
---
Yeah he's got a few points allocated pretty badly, and I think it's insane to not invest in spiritual healing when it's a flat 10% boost. What would you think about this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVbhsZbttcc0VxxM
---
It hits the key talents of spiritual healing, inner focus, inspiration, and healing focus; the only big thing I'm not getting vs. the standard holy build is divine spirit and unbreakable will, but leaves me with spirit tap, imp. shadow word pain, imp power word shield, wand spec, and holy nova for solo grinding.
---
Put some cat ears on it and now its Japanese
---
Something not mentioned here yet is that in classic raiding there is a 16-slot debuff limit per target.  So that has to be managed by the raid in a way that raid dps is at its peak.
---
I mean it outputs most dps classes, lock, hunter. The only things that straight beat it are rogue/fwar and that's much later in the phases.
---
I can't remember exactly if this was Classic or TBC but actually able to Misdirect + Volley off the tank onto people I don't like :) lol
---
haha i get it, he plays the game a lot
---
Slipknot - entire Vol. 3 album. I played it over and over while leveling my first toon.
---
Does the friendly have it under control? If so, /salute and move on your way, possibly heal him up after the fact.
---
Does it look like joining in would swing it in your faction's favour? If so, join and help secure a win for your faction.
---
Does it look like joining in would just get you killed as well? If so, take advantage of the distraction to run away, and post a warning about gankers in your area in general chat.
---
Con: having to share loot drops.
---
Sounds fun which secondary specs should i go for Paladin?
---
Blizz stop teasing us with these weekly non-news minor updates, you’re killing us.
---
Alright, alright, alright.
---
Your cake day today? Happy cake day mate!  
---
Hope you get a classic release announcement as a gift!
---
What secondary specs for pally?
---
So roll on an RP server..
---
I mean the damage you gain from the debuff slot being wasted by mortal strike and it's damage itself doesn't make up for the fact that you can go 2H fury for very similar, if not better DPS, while still benefitting from said debuff slot.
---
PvE, it's for the battle chicken/arcanite dragonling spam with bombs to fast clear stages and insta kill adds.
---
It's a high requirement, but you can cheese through some really hard spots you'd normally be pretty undergeared for. I agree it's a little overkill for healers though, leave it to the DPS and tanks.
---
for some reason, this one made me exhale more air from my nose than usual...well done
---
Human Male Warrior
---
BONUS: on a RP server
---
HOW FAR WILL THE FAR SIDE TAKE ME, HOW FAR CAN I GO CAN I GO???
---
We used to tank LBRS for Ony attunements with a voidwalker. Took some prep on each pull, but it was doable.
---
Don't let people tell you taht warlocks aren't tanks.
---
&gt; No, I don't really think I need examples, as it is widely know to anyone that follows Blizzard games and the community around them.
---
Seems like you just had a hard time coming up with negative examples in the face of all the positive ones.
---
The only real big things I can think of is laying off staff and people being angry at BFA (though people have complained about every single wow patch and expansion since day 1). They fired non-developers and esports cast that were largely part of a dying game (Heroes of the Storm). This happens in business and isn’t unique to ActiBlizz. I’m sorry those people lost their jobs, but this would only be majorly concerning for me if Blizzard devs or higher ups were getting axed.
---
&gt; People are fed up with how they butcher WoW and don't even realize what it is they need to fix. 
---
Well what do they need to fix that they aren’t already addressing?
---
&gt;Then OW started great but quickly turned into a game balanced for Esports
---
God forbid a game is balanced. I think the majority of people who started playing OW still think it’s an enjoyable title. Most of the people who left moved onto Battle Royale type games.
---
&gt; So to sum up, 3 out of 4 of their main franchises, which have all been beloved and had a fierce fanbase, have been turned for the worse.
---
You’re conveniently leaving out a lot of information here. First of all, Blizzard is working on new titles for **all of their IPs** right now as I type this comment. They are also working on new IPs as well. How has Warcraft been “turned to the worst” when we are getting both Classic and WC3 remastered this year? Is Diablo 4 now automatically considered shit since a mobile game is coming out? 
---
&gt;  The problem here is people have no faith in the games being good, even if they take time. It is not something new, this is something they have shown over years now. If they make something amazing, then great - but most people don't have faith in that.
---
People like this have a limited attention span and like to complain. The evil “Acti-Blizzard” is the same company who cancelled Project Titan after probably hundreds of millions of dollars, years of development time, and attempting to restart the project. All because “it simply wasn’t fun.” They’re also the same company that went as far as implementing spell batching into Classic, listening to players about PvP and how phases will work. 
---
I still don’t think it’s fair to say “Blizz has gone to shit” based on them outsourcing a mobile title, certain parts of the last WoW expansion and how Overwatch is balanced. Seems pretty ridiculous when looking at Blizzard’s overall track record. The fact that they’re releasing Classic at all *proves* they do “get their fans.”
---
Biggest news from the post, glad to see they made it this way.
---
A ton of Ragnaros loot was added in patch 1.4 which from all blizzard posts should mean it wouldn't be in before phase 2 
---
"Raid Itemization
---
Onyxia, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and all Molten Core boss creatures have all received some new items on their loot tables."
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0
---
I don't have the full list but by there being less drops meant bre had a higher droprate.
---
I need MOAR INFO.. MOARRRR.
---
ignore them generally. i'm busy trying to hit 60, i don't need to waste my time getting caught up in that. I also don't know who started the fight and that matters to me.  
---
I will only join in is if i see the opposing faction start the attack  where i'm trying to quest. In this case, i'll help my faction ally get out of a situation they didnt put themselves in.  
---
If they started it, they're on their own.  
---
That was their own choice to waste time.
---
I think leveling with a friend or a party makes the game exponentially more fun, but it will also take much longer to level. Gathering quests and quests which require you to kill a monster and gather it's parts take forever because you need double of EVERYTHING.  
---
It's the price you pay for a more relaxed leveling experience, but I think it's well worth it. It is an MMO after all.
---
WoW has extremely low internet requirements, should be alright
---
No, it was definitely Burning Blade.
---
I played horde on gummies 1st server and just couldn’t handle not automatically knowing where everything is. Do not like layout of UC or even org really, TB is cancer
---
Underrated comment.
---
This is a response to a forum question not a typed out news post. It’s enough information to answer the question asked.
---
I use my high end rig to collect steam games then never play them... :(
---
Sure they want it to succeed... but you are talking about putting a community driven pet project in the same breath as Destiny, Diablo, Overwatch, BFA. They've had calls like this since the classic announcement, and they don't mention classic. It's not considered a flagship title.
---
This was an answer to the question on the forums rather than an update though.
---
Still its mostly 1 target. Cleave on the multi dogs, lava packs, giants and firelords thats about it. 
---
About 50 percent single target 45 percent 2 target cleave 5 percent more than 2 target I reckon. Fpr trash. 
---
Even less cleave in BWL.
---
You likely won't have perfect debuff slots for 16. Very few top end guilds will but this will by and far not be the normal experience. And if you ever believe you need perfect 16 slots to clear anything in the first 3 phases ima laugh
---
Guild leaders GF is always the mediocre healer in the group who doesn’t know their class and has Bis gear due to favouritism.
---
Amateur
---
Alexa, order domino’s.
---
Not exactly the best build, but I always loved feral druid during TBC. I loved swapping between cat and bear. I usually played either solo, or with two other people, so I specced for survivability. There was this point in Felwood where more and more bears kept jumping me, and by the end, I'm sitting on the corpses of ten billion bears, no MP left, like 6 HP left, soaking in my own blood, and I loved every second of it.
---
Tauren male Druid!
---
Next time there's news I will rush to make this comment.
---
Yas daddi make me take it 😩
---
yeah, so its vanilla wow.
---
Divorce, have you lost your mind Arthas!?
---
Replaying those run in my head make is sound really shady.  "Well, you *could* run the dungeon normally, but I can show you a faster way for the low, low price of X gold!"
---
...later... "Oh, you died in the lava?  Well I just *happen* to have this greater fire protection potion..."
---
I think he means it's not a "blue post".
---
If I were Blizz I’d do this kinda stuff all the time just to mess with the community
---
i was thinking the same thing :) I hope they do
---
Its 50 of each. Only limit is max 10 per Classic realm. So 10x5 realms. Doesnt interfear with BFA if what they state is what they mean.
---
It was an answer to a question, not an actual announcement.
---
If fights are easy, why do you need potions and world buffs? Honest question.
---
While this stuff is funny,
---
For reals, please do some exercises during down time at the very least.
---
🦀🦀blizzard powerless against PTO schedules🦀🦀
---
This better not be the only post this week :\
---
Not even sure if the fraction lock will be in.
---
But even if its is dont you think someone of a 10/15 man group , that has players in it that are so hardcore to committed 16h/d + in the game wouldn't buy just 1 account ?
---
It would be kinda foolish to believe that would not be the case, i mean if you do it you become the most effektive premade group on the server, if the other dont do it too.
---
Maybe the extreme casual servers dont do it then, but they wouldnt que dodge in the first place.
---
We called it that as a joke at the internet cafe I worked at, we all played on Burning Blade.
---
You never expect a warrior to smash that much math. Much appreciated, my understanding of vanilla horde is broadened. I thought heroic strike scaled with max weapon damage and that's why you wanted slower ones. So I was thinking it made less sense. When you mention the rage generation it all clicked. Weird, but understandable. I would like to ad an asterisk to every comment that I was talking about Alliance only lol.
---
Cant wait for Whitemane and her champion!
---
😡👎
---
I'm 30 years old and have been a gamer for as long as I can remember all the way back to NES Mario when I was barely old enough to hold a controller, and yet I'm not nearly as cynical as some of you.
---
I'm not saying that everything is sunshine and flowers, but nothing is nearly as grim as some of you seem to think.
---
Shit, just the fact that classic is happening should be proof of that.
---
But it is a post that is blue.
---
If you min max play a warrior. If the only thing that’s important to you is being the best class for your role, warrior wins in all 3 of its roles. Melee DPS, tank, PvP assist train (ie blast thecfucker who just got Ms’d)
---
Mage if you’re interested in ranged dps. And a priest if you only care about healing. 
---
If any aspect of the game interests you other than 36min bwl clears—every class/race/faction combo is viable.
---
I ran tons of add-ons in vanilla. Yes, they should be and will be allowed.
---
A limit of 50 characters... For WoW Classic mobile
---
Yeah I saw, that makes much more sense then. Still hoping for some meatier updates though :(
---
Spoilers: Still miles behind melee dps.
---
I get it, now. My bad... Long day at work.
---
The problem is that major publishers outsourced the risk to indie developers by letting them take the risk on new IP, then buying the dev, monetizing the hell out of the existing game, gutting the studio, and whoring the IP out to a bunch of in house studios, mostly located in places like eastern europe where labor is super cheap.
---
Indie developers, in turn, have gotten just as bad because they're outsourcing the cost of development to gamers through early access and crowd funding.  The brass ring for them is to finance the game with other people's money, then sell the studio to EA/Acti/T2/Sony/Microsoft and walk away with an 8+ figure payday for the founder.   Of the seven games I've purchased in early access.  Two are in development hell, three were released unfinished either so they could start selling DLC or so the devs could get out from under the project and move on, and the only ones that actually got out of alpha/beta sold out their playerbase by selling the IP to major publishers who monetized the hell out of them.
---
There hasn't been a nost-tier TBC server to rally behind (rip felmyst).
---
I know you're memeing but please take care of your family...
---
Only one faction on PvP servers! YES!
---
The worst thing to happen was the changed run/walk animations. They are all horrendous.
---
Practice like crazy but dont do the most common mistake most people do imo.... play to get better, dont keep doing the same thing over and over.
---
Ah ah, well played! :D
---
That Mountain Dew is gonna get warm without refrigeration :(
---
There wasn't anything actually hard about leveling in vanilla.
---
It was just slow and tedious
---
Wtf, 2MB/s was insane at that time where i live.  When i started in 09 i think i was still on 128k DSL.
---
I think a friend had 3 meg around 04 or 05 and it was crazy expensive.
---
I have, especially early server.  BRE and OEB are very strong .
---
Anyone who would stand idly by and watch as a friend falls to an enemy is a coward and a traitor. Typical Alliance traits.
---
Lok Narash. Lok'tar ogar.
---
It's 10. It's always been 10 since it was added in 1.3. ALWAYS.
---
I was talking about mechanical difficulty, should've mentioned that I guess 
---
Boss fights can be long, healer mana becomes a problem and so on. 
---
But compared to recent xpacs, there are no real heavily taxing fights 
---
They are at best overturned numberwise
---
Whats the matter?
---
The other posts seem to have the right idea.   Pro = fun, power.  Con = limited resources, slow.
---
One thing you should definitely do is make sure everyone is on the same page.
---
How much do you all expect to play?  Are you always going to play together?  Will you take breaks to level professions or will those be strictly "off the clock"?  If someone falls behind, do you wait for them or expect them to catch up?  If someone can't help but play more, what is the farthest ahead they should be allowed to get?
---
You may have a pretty chill group, but all of those questions are worth asking and answering ahead of time.
---
Good luck!
---
They're still there if you just click a checkbox in your graphics options, too.
---
As opposed to what though? Every moment you play a game is progress towards completing it. The only way you don’t complete a game as is fast as you can is when you choose to not play it. 
---
I mean no one boots up Mario intending to take as long as possible. Every tap on the dpad or press of A or B is intended to assist in beating the game.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath
---
Sitting on a toilet all day is too uncomfortable, better to just have a laptop in the bathroom

Farming at 60 can be tough, if you get a bit of gear you can holy nova farm some DM. 
---
I played back in the day and got through most of AQ before quitting. I never downranked my heals and I was toward the top of healing meters according to my friends, since I didn’t run meters. I was a young dork who thought healers who worry about maxing meters are probably burning mana faster than they should be.
---
Anyway, you can get away with ignoring it unless you’re in a progression guild.
---
I love my priest. I don’t play much BfA, but he is max level in full t2 with benediction. I had a blast with priest in Vanilla. I’d say go for it.
---
2 mb/s is still quick?
---
2H fury is just more dps than arms plain and simple. Never mind debuff issues. Also note the weap speed on OEB. Not a great MS weapon.
---
It's a pretty small dev team who are doing it, and it'll give Blizz a bunch of good will and bring back older players. What's to lose, but there isn't a ton to gain.
---
It likely won't revive WoW.
---
Gib more!
---
If you can only have 10 characters per realm, and 50 characters per classic region, that means there will be atleast 5 classic servers per region
---
When I started my wow journey I would lose my shit if I got up to 6 kB/s lmao. A year in at least I upgraded to about 150 kB/s but it would be a few years before I got out on my own and moved to civilization to get a 10mb or so connection
---
Yes it is possible, my guild did it with 6 typically, which was risky but we had tanks (ab)using the ZG spell hit trinket after hitting a wall for a month with taunts missing and us getting wiped out.
---
Was good times.
---
Oh look, another idiot complaining about [Savage Gladiator chain](http://itemization.info/item/11726) in a progressive itemization whine.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Or it could be that they saw a question and got the okay to give the answer with no ulterior motives for upcoming info.
---
Definitely incorrect.
---
&gt; just pick a layout for each fight, watch your timers, and keep them centrally located, pretty simple.
---
Yeah our shamans most of the time got *TOLD* what totems they would be using (and when they would drop mana tide)
---
Ok here if you are just trying to heal raids and AoE farm do this, although there won’t be much to AoE farm except like SM
---
I think they missed a word
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusIVqo0vt0c
---
Might of Menithil horde side for 2h fury warrior is pretty much godmode PvE. What can you dual wield to meaningfully beat it? (Honest question, not trying to be snarky)
---
Do you not have a phone?
---
O, it tanks. In AQ, your tanks even start out dpsing the hunters.
---
Solid concepts with both builds, I have them up in a separate tab now so that I can dive in and actually see what you did. I'm a fan of utility as well.
---
My concept with the smite priest is to be more of a damage dealer with an off healing capability; so gearing more like a shadowpriest than a true disc priest. I enjoy Shadow, I'm just enjoying the "off season" with some conceptual fun. Lets me hear other's perspectives and look at things through a different light to hopefully reveal something I may have missed before.
---
I'lllllllll take it.
---
It's definitely scary. I had to take frequent breaks, and if I encountered something that Really freaked me out, I was willing to look it up on the wiki to learn its behavior so I could avoid it better.
---
Yeah BWL is not very cleave happy, hence why i said mostly phase1/2
---
Dwarf Hunter
---
My current girlfriend was probably a bigger wow nerd than me, and I can't wait for classic to roll around, since we didn't play together back when we were young teens.
---
Either you respect the 1v1
---
Help your buddie
---
Or ignore because you are a busy with your own shit.
---
All of them are completely acceptable and its your own choice.
---
What’s mana tide? 🤪 I raided as either ele or enhance 95% of the time, rarely ever specced full restoration. 
---
Totem wise tho, for the most part the totems pick themselves based on the group you’re in, and don’t let rogues tell you that grace of air is better than wind fury because it’s not.
---
Yes that was what I meant.
---
Not talking about OEB. Also its not more dps plain and simple. Its a lot closer than you/most people believe.
---
Valid point with the timezone, but it works under alot of assumptions.
---
Blizzard did not say what the Server limit will be, but even if you assume alot more players, it dos not change the fact that for the Honor farmers the most effective way to gain honor will be to not fight ppl that fight back.
---
And most ppl that "help" are not dedicated to follow these honor farmers around, because there is no gain in it.
---
So these players will just switch places if they have to if its means they say ahead of other honor farmers, and fighting/risking death and therefore time loss is almost never worth it.
---
So the guy/guys that avoid fights and gank leveling players will be the one that rank. 
---
Or are so grossly good at group pvp that they even wipe/gank the "resistance" in seconds without risking killing a civilian.
---
You can make of it what you want thats how the pvp system works.

I still remember the first time I got destroyed by one of the Sons of Arugal in Silverpine.  I loved having difficult mobs you had to keep an eye out for.  The others that come to mind are devilsaurs in Un'goro, and the troll village in the Hinterlands.  I miss content that, while levelling, was too challenging to take on alone.
---
I said this right as I clicked the post
---
We've known this since it was announced.
---
True mezlow, anything that required a group can be skipped with no detriment to reaching 60
---
We've known since it was announced at BlizzCon that they were doing this, not biggest at all.
---
because it's the only profession that actually adds something of value to the class. All the rest can be dropped once you have their BoP you wanted, but engineering items that are worth using all require engineering.
---
Being able for all 40 people to work bombs into their rotation can majorly speed up encounters or allow classes that normally can't CC to improve pulls or adds pick ups.

2MB/s? All we had was like 400KB/s :(

I'm expecting a bigger realm than the 2500 player caps of 2005. Like maybe a 4k player cap. I'm wondering how big they will go. I think this'll be something they announce soon.
---
What a shocker that they would allow more than 12,500 people to play at once. 
---
This subreddit alone suggests we need multiple dozens if blizzard rolls servers out like they did in 04/05 at 2500 max concurrent. 
---
The question is more or less servers than retail launch for particular regions.
---
Man, I thought Hero Classes were going to be awesome evolutions of vase classes. Always pictured a warrior either morphing into a paladin or DK. And then other stuff for other classes that I can’t think up.
---
He gave solid advice for like 3 out of the last 4 of his posts.

Sources, receipts

This is exactly what I'm looking for.  Sign me up!
---
I'll poke around some communities and if I ever find one I'll throw you a PM.
---
This whole argument started from you talking about arms warriors in BWL getting askandi. I said from start arms in MC hardly matters cause MC is ez.
---
You have been wrong and shifted your argument many times. Dont know what Nightfall is. Dont know how debuff prio works. Dont know what world buffs exist. Dont kmow what debuffs exist. Dont consider death wish or imp slam when talking specs. Talk about AP thresholds while missing its irrelevant since you will be over threshold by prebis. But you still argue on and on. Whatever man. 
---
Anyways, look forward to your parses.
---
I asked for sources,  not opinions.
---
In vanilla, there was nothing better than questing for a while in a zone and then "taking a break" by going back to a major city and just chill for a moment, watching ppl coming and go, checking out the auction house for some new gear etc.
---
You can do this in Retail but its just not the same.
---
Also i look forward to farm my dungeon set again.
---
then? i get 3 right now lmao
---
Let's see who makes this post on literally every single blue post every single time.
---
Hi, /u/Sasha_a22
---
Too many questions for a client that we don’t fully understand ( also non released samples )
---
You heal your guy and kill the horde scum, obvs
---
Somebody said tomorrow will be another post, I hope this is true so badly. :/
---
I sure do hate those videos I don't watch! 😡
---
Same.
---
I think partying with 1 more person makes life 100 times easier. It keeps you interested as you'll be less inclined to afk, you'll be targeted less to be ganked, you'll have better survive-ability (walks are long af), and its way more fun to try and kill 3/4 mobs will 2 people than 2 mobs with 1 person.
---
The circlejerk on reddit is that the epic games launcher is actually just malware. No one wants to have to install malware on their computer to play a game that they could play malware-free yesterday.
---
Make sure the length of the video is at least 10 minutes.
---
Wooo! Only 38 more people to go!
---
Same doe. Might roll female for those cast animations tho, best in game
---
Mostly from a PvP perspective:
---
Mage playstyle is limited. It has a lot of variety, but all Mages play the same: cooldown focused, emphasis on burst, lots of kiting.
---
Warlock is more varied in its playstyles. It can play like a turret with Destro: weak mobility, but burst comparable to Shamans. It can play like a tank-caster, where you outlast your opponent and whittle them with DoTs (1v1 spec). Or like SM/Ruin which is a combo of both. This is on top of pets that can change the whole strategy of your play instantly based on what you summoned.
---
I've played both to 60, and they're both fun, but I like Lock more for its variety.
---
Also: I like the nuance of microing pets and I'm kind of tired of how resource intensive Vanilla is for casters, where Warlocks (and Paladins) are probably the best at rarely drinking.
---
My father :(
---
There aren't studies on the viability of classic wow, that's not how reality works. 
---
It's an old product coming back to a game that's generally been losing subs. And I really doubt classic can revive the game.
---
Like you may point to old school runescape, but that's not nearly the same. They've continued to add more to the base, and change the game a bunch since it's release.
---
Read this thread. Read how many ppl think this is a hunter weapon. Its not overblown.
---
Getting endgame groups because the tank will want the DPS drops you want
---
Haha yeah, to prevent drama, usually the raid leader told the shamans what they they were dropping. If you had a problem with the totems, you got put in the "SPECIAL GROUP" - the group with no totems, usually the group of druids as we were so damn mana efficient we didn't really need mana spring, other than our single HoT druid (since this was before hot stacking was a thing, only 1 druid was allowed to drop hots)
---
I played a mage from beta and beyond vanilla and I remember it being 4 per cast.
---
You couldn't buy your own alts' auctions though, so need the help of a friend to launder money cross-faction.
---
Why are you ignoring dal rends? It’s not too hard to farm, and is significantly better than the alternatives pre-raid (ignoring low drop rate epics like ironfoe) even as non human
---
It would be the least burdensome on launch experience. 
---
Sure we can’t no life for a long weekend, but I’ll bet if they just randomly dropped it during the night in W Europe, E North America, they wouldn’t even need sharding. 
---
That said, I’m hoping to take Thursday/Friday or Friday/Monday off the week it comes out. So some forwarding would be nice.
---
As opposed to not finishing it as fast as possible? Take Mario for example. Speed runners run through it with a much more risky approach, while others may play it a bit more safe. If Wow is an example, some people enjoy doing some pvp and dungeons, while others solely focus on getting the /played as low as possible.
---
Saying you're not speedrunning if you're not among the world's best is like saying you're not sprinting if your 100m dash time isn't below 10 seconds.
---
Shaman is great, but Enhance is lacking.
---
What is dead may never die. For the forsaken!
---
Taunt is based off spell hit not melee hit, and if you missed a taunt you were facing a critical situation, so 8 tanks was "safer" route, if one taunt missed the next tank jumped in the rotation to grab it and do the dance, and you had 4 tanks in limbo in the middle of the room.
---
Was good safe strat, did make the fight take like 15 minutes, but popping mana pots on CD didn't make it much of an issue.
---
Yeah I mean cdc using it as a model for infectious disease transmission
---
Lol, I referenced the wrong nightfall since there are two things named it. Hot damn, got me. I guessed a 50/50 wrong fuck me. Rekt. I dont know world buff? I stated a joke about the horde-only world buff, so thats not really not knowing but again clearly you are right. Imp slam if it doesn't reset the auto doesn't matter, as both 2h fury and arms uses slam, so yeah no shit i dont include it. I corrected my statement about debuff priority.  
---
Changing an argument isnt the same thing as correcting when presented that you are wrong. I was shown that i mis-remembered how debuff prior work, and i corrected? What is your point of posting if not to get someone with a different view to correct themselves?  
---
Also not once you have proven that threshold is hit by preraid bis, because I know it doesnt, unless you get mind controlled and buffed by a horde world buff, and I still don't think you even have enough AP then. Especially without DM buffs. Death wish is really good, yes never said it wasnt.
---
It makes some assumptions, but ones based off my experiences from years and years ago on a live server.
---
Honor farmers may move but that takes time for them as well, and wherever they move on to will not necessarily be any less difficult. Particularly given many lvl55-60 zones have crossover endgame content or are located near to where 60s may be hanging out generally. (Though I say this from an Alliance perspective, maybe it's slightly different for Horde)
---
Blizzard haven't set the populations, but you can be assured that the majority of players will be around level cap in phase 2 (or near enough) and that peak times will always be peak times. This is really the difference when comparing ganking to pservers where population spikes differ through various timezones.
---
I think there's a danger either side of saying "pvp servers will be gank free" or "pvp servers will be heavily ganked." Both statements are incorrect and discourage people from rolling a fun experience. It isn't for everyone but rumours of lvl50s demise has been grossly overstated.
---
That's my fear, I expect AT LEAST 4k. I think they're proud of their servers, they even hinted at that during Blizzcon. I just hope people realise the implications of that, I feel like people stopped talking about it.
---
I don’t think so
---
The sooner you get it the better it is. So ideally, you get it by 21-22. Which mean you wanna make like 3-4 pally friends and do it all to completion together.
---
Excellent work, bot!
---
That's correct.
---
Makes you wonder why, right?
---
Wonder why, indeed.
---
This better not be the blue post of the week ffs
---
The thing about healing efficiency is that it really depends on your +healing. Renew is by far the absolute most inefficient healing spell we have with little to no +healing. Once you starting getting a fair amount of +healing renew eventually becomes one of your most efficient heals. I actually made a google sheets tool that spits out how efficient heals are for each healing class based on talents and +healing because it's going to change as you accumulate better gear. You'd have to save a copy to your desktop in order to change values.
---

---
then you remember wrong.
---
It's been 10 since it came out.
---
Retail. Im craving classic wow so bad Im willing ti play retail. Dont wanna pserver since I want that fresh experience
---
So far, they have talked about Classic being a major content release as a celebration of 15 years of World of Warcraft and announced it would be in “the back half of the year” and not listed as one of its Q2 releases. Not earth-shattering or surprising, but that means a June release is off the table
---
There will likely be significantly more than 5 servers. With the 2500 player cap that vanilla had for each server, 5 servers would only let 12.5k players on at once in each region. There's no way that would cover NA and EU players.
---
Prove it
---
Youtube Priest Lasher farm. Mindless easy farm.
---
10:01 ftfy
---
What are you talking about. Calling a release of a game a side project that the parent company doesn’t really care about requires a source, until then it’s just an opinion
---
I'm not buying AAA games, they are not made for gamers but for a large crowd that includes a lot of non gamers. The devs actively target this crowd and don't make games that are fun and great to play but make games that is very accessible. This often means a game is easy and usually on top of this incorporates shady practices because a lot of the average non gamers fall for them. It's similar in other industries of entertainment though. It feels like modern tv shows get made for people who legitimately are very dumb. There's nothing interesting on television except a bunch of talkshows of very low intellectual level (more just sensation with some politics thrown in) and a few news channels.
---
Yeah, i'm still worried they will vastly underestimate the amount of people interested and not provide anywhere near enough servers for everyone
---
Yeah, I remember... all part of the epic run haha
---
12 weeks of farm means they are definitely bis or so close it doesn't make a difference, thanks to mythic +. So this boss is definitely overtuned.
---
Why is that a problem? Well, guilds aren't even trying to down Uu'lnath at the moment, except for the top 10. There's no incentive. If it takes someone like method that many tries in BiS gear, it means 4 months of banging your head on the same wall for a normal 10/10M guild with a (classic) 10h/week raiding schedule. Or waiting for next patch's gear to make it absolutely trivial because the ilvl jump between tiers is ridiculously high (thanks to 4 difficulty levels.) Or wait for a nerf, that will happen as soon as method downs it. 
---
For the lock stacking, sure. But well, affli are actually almost the best class for dps at the moment, and the best when there is movement. There damage is particularly high, even if the teleport is a nice help too.
---
Edit: you have to admit it is fun to see all the felhounds running to the boss in the beginning.
---
I’d still rather have DP and WoTF for PVP.
---
Either Troll Shaman or Chad Night elf priest
---
I doubt many streamers will play PvP, just because it opens them up to too much griefing. Most will roll PvE so that leveling isn't a constant grind of multi-person ganks forcing them to try and group level.

Ok cool that was it then. I was Norcross Male paladin was getting into bwl but never finished or at least I didn't.
---
Classic was specifically mentioned and discussed several times during the call. It has a direct effect on Monthly Active Users which is a metric used to measure prospective revenue. Of course it isn’t a flagship title but it is still a key title in increasing revenue, and important to investors
---
Anyone who played Vanilla seriously would know I was talking about the axe bud. Its not a guessing game.  
---
Lol ofc imp slam matters. 
---
I guarantee that threshold is hit by full consume fury warrior.
---
So are my balls.
---
Dwarf Priest, because I don't like nelf animations
---
never heard anyone say that
---
how do you even qualify "better" in this case
---
Pro: you always have somebody to talk to.  
---
Con: you need to collect twice as many zhevra hooves.
---
Priest
---
I did not know that, so news to me!
---
This is based off TBC data?
---
&gt;not having 2 accounts 
---
plebs
---
That’s absolutely insane.
---
Just play as Paladin ;)
---
&gt; I hear bad things about druids other than resto is meh and in TBC I played a rogue.
---
FUUUUUCK NO.
---
Feral is a blast to play even in classic. In PvE not the strongest  DPS spec and is a struggle many times because you have to powershift (shift out of cat and back into cat to generate extra energy), and even with the best gear in the game, you're not going to really compete. But you bring a lot of utility with you.
---
And boomkin is... meme status.
---
If you enjoy the playstyle of druid, play a god damn druid.
---
In 1v1s you will be using all your forms to outlast your opponent typically. Whereas a rogue is very much a control and burst fight.
---
In 1vX you are doing the same as a 1v1, but you are using roots to control someone else, if they are melee, while trying to put the hurt on one person quickly, using heals, and travel form to gain distance and space to re-stealth and re-engage.
---
Druids are complex in classic, due to so much shifting of forms, using the utility from each to the max.
---
nope, TBC doesn't come out for another year.
---
And even on the thottbot logs as early as 1.3.1 within a month of the patch coming out. they confirm it's 10 bottles.
---
Seems like the real unpopular opinion around here is anything that involves anything changing. Personally the new animations/models are a mixed bag but overall I prefer them.
---
Would you consider the microing of pets a necessity? I'm genuinely wanting to play lock, but I cannot be bothered at this point in my life to micro a pet.  
---
If it's just a matter of binding an ability or two then fine, but AFAIK classic didn't change skills dynamically, so I'd either have to have a ton of extra binds available for each demon type, or develop some sort of macro that would use i.e. "Pet CC" and then list all the relevant CC abilities on any given pet and hope that if I mashed it enough it would cycle through until it found the one for the pet I had out.
---
That's just the ability use portion as well, I'm not sure how relevant pet positioning is either since I don't think classic had the changes to aoe damage avoidance etc...on pets.
---
I'm going to try to get my son into it. He seems interested so far.
---
Wow you spoiled I only had ~500kbs
---
1 and 2 are the same thing?
---
They are
---
I would rather like to know how big the realms are going to be.
---
My math says that with Ice Barbed Spead, you need 873.33 AP for BT to outdo it in the best case when you get max weapon damage. On low end of weapon damage its 700 AP.  On average I guess the middle so 786 ish. I have more unbuffed AP in tank gear right now. UNBUFFED. Full world buffed BWL geared warriors get to over 2k AP I know that much. I can throw on some prebis when I get home and count it up.
---
This kills my goal of having 51 max level characters in classic!
---
Great now I can have 100 max level wow characters
---
You'll get a much better reception if you remove as much detail as possible from Gilneas, Uldum, Ghostlands, Quel'Thelas, Quel'Danas, etc.
---
edit: not that they aren't gorgeous!  Just to appease the "no changes" fanatics around here.
---
Even if June release, the financial impact would be minor as no upfront cost (although June is obviously unlikely for other reasons).
---
&gt; I may be wrong here but resto druid hots don't stack, so if you're one of the weaker druids in the raid, your hots are going to be met with a lot of "a more powerful spell is already active" or get overridden.
---
Depends on the patch, I can't remember what "era" I think it was AQ era that hot stacking came about, I would like to confirm with blizzard if it will be on launch.
---
And yes, raids usually have 1 token druid to drop hots on people, with the highest spell power, all other druids are sworn away from doing so.
---
Even with that, druids are very interesting still, with 2 different dispels (poison/curses which are PLENTIFUL), you are constantly bouncing around doing things.
---
Furthermore I would like to know if we will have decursive back again. Dispeling a 40 man raid on chromaggus was a nightmare even WITH the addon. They broke it sometime later when there was much less dispel heavy fights.
---
Thank you for the info. It sounds like the disc i know and love just isnt even an option. Its just priest healer. Which i guess is fine, but i love later iterations of disc. Guess im gonna start to explore my options.
---
Not sure. But I have it narrowed down to hunter, rogue, Druid, warrior, or paladin. Human or Nelf respectively based on class. That’s assuming ally though for horde it will be orc or Tauren.
---
I would help the alliance dude.
---
It's called "World of **WAR**craft", not world of _"Hello good chap, I see you're having a spar over there. I do say 'ol sport you are doing a marvelous job. Tally Ho and carry on you two rascals!"_
---
And if said alliance player is seriously pissed that I helped a fellow ally on a PvP server, he may have an honored spot in my collection of stupid people, aka. the ignore list.
---
Enhance is usually a nightfall bot (sadly) for serious raids.
---
It can be fun in pvp, VERY high burst with windfury. You are wielding 2h's (no dual wield), so hitting hard is fun!
---
Additionally a good feral offtank will be able to change gear and be an extra decurser or offer additional healing if needed. Due to low numbers of druids in my raids our offtank got a lot of tier pieces and had a lot of healing gear. The extra b-Rez is very useful too.
---
HAHAHAHA LOOOL SO FUNNY
---
Awesome!
---
And THEN throw him into the lava!
---
how annoying of him. Now all the times I see people shit on him I'll be a little more understanding.
---
Please please please don’t let this be our “news” for the week.
---
What realistic outcome do you expect from this post?
---
I mean really realistic.
---
If you’re answer is “nothing” then why bother?
---
Heal him up whilst spamming /~~sorry~~lol on the horde
---
fixed that typo for you.
---
Mixing and matching is an advantage, from a druid PoV my best in slot for a long time for chest, is a god damn cloth dress. (Though it really shows off my hooves well....)
---
Not being locked into only one armor type gives you flexibility, as well as access to pieces that are that much stronger. There will be some itemization problems, with some pieces having spirit which aren't very useful as a stat? Some paladin correct me on this one.
---
Mor'Ladim in Darkshire...
---
I highly doubt they will allow name change, or even server transfers
---
Cons: Less gained XP, more time needed, play hours need to sync, less gold gain 30-40.  
---
Pros: Easier to get instance groups, fun playing with friends, better wpvp, easier elite quests.
---
They did the math...
---
It's the update we deserve, but not the one we need right now...
---
What a retard
---
North American Alliance player looking for a guild when Classic hits.
---
Potentially either just myself or along with 2 friends as well, we are looking for a casual progression guild that also wants to RP on larger scales. They are currently more active than I am because of my work schedule but it looks like I myself will be available 
---
Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays - All day AND all night (I work nights so that's easy)
---
All we want to do is hang out with cool people, RP with a decently large group, and then progress through Raid content at a relaxed pace where we are more focused on theory crafting and hanging out within the game we all love.
---
In only preraid? Can you actually provide proof of this or are you just stating? Cause ive seen full consume fwar preraid hitting around 900.
---
And I've played vanilla for 6 years now, in a variety of hardcore/casual guilds on many different servers. Nightfall procs for warlocks is common discussion of a debuff slot.
---
We know everything is made in China or the US but we also know that player will be an EU tryhard.
---
I didn't watch his stream, but it's pretty obvious he didn't actually call in and was just making a joke.
---
This is a pathetic excuse for a blue post. This was all assumed. Honestly about to not even play wow classic when it comes out bc the way the are handling not giving a release date. At least acknowledge that are not able to give one yet and when you may be able to announce the date. Terrible
---
Why would you use ice barbed spear? Are you trying to slant the numbers in your favor as hard as you can? Lol hey man I know you are specifically talking about Sword spec warrior, but this polearm that you can get at level 52 yeah thats totally the numbers im going to use.
---
Actually, the option was removed with BfA
---
Mining works pretty good with engineering and you can do jump runs in DM for shards and rich thorium veins. 
---
Herbalism is always a solid moneymaker too.
---
I pay that and DL at 500kb/s if I'm lucky
---
Druids are quite viable in Classic, bring b-rez to the table that nobody else can do. No out of combat rez means you aren't rezzing 40 people after a wipe (thankfully).
---
You CAN level as balance, but it's painful. You don't get much to amplify your spell damage for a long time, and your mana pool is limited.
---
Best bet level feral which is very VERY fast in comparison to most of the classes, and then switch to resto endgame when you feel like it. Done it many times in classic, and on private servers recently. You can buy BOE greens to build up a healing set endgame, or just heal in feral gear for a while until you replace the feral gear.
---
Druids are rare, so gear comes quickly to druids and are always welcome in a raid. (My naxx guild had 5-6 ACTIVE raiding druids at all times, was good times haha)
---
Technically you’re right... but it was HARD if you didn’t try to take it slow. What if you pull two-three mobs at once, that can definitely be hard!
---
Maybe, I don't actually know. Will be interesting to see exactly how addons will be implemented in Classic.
---
A toggle for the models and animations would be great, it lets people experience Classic however they want without affecting other people's experience. If the #nochanges cultists can not live with that, they can choke on conjured cinnamon rolls.
---
Really glad that kept this in.
---
Sure you can still cross faction, but you're gonna have to pay for 2 subs so there's a disincentive for most people.
---
No not in preraid. But theres your answer right? you yourself saying you have seen 900. That's enough. Not even counting deathwish or flurry.
---
Warlock nightfall isn't a debuff lol. Its a buff the lock gets when it procs. Come on man do better.
---
I personally would rather play holy/disc myself and lose a few fights here and there. Getting some extra SP from spirit via talents is nice, unless you’re in PvP gear which has MP5, and 10% extra heal with talents and 21 in disc for spirit buff.  Sucks to die to geared melee so fast but meh, worst part is having to drink every stam buff TBH lol
---
Rogue - make sure you roll undead, with a mohawk and missing bottom jaw for ultimate meme status.
---
Shaman - FROSTSHOCK!
---
Warlock - 5K SHADOWBOLT CRIT MAKES STEALTH WORTHLESS! (5 points if anyone gets this reference)
---
Hunter - AFK autoshot.
---
Druid - I am biased, but what happens in moonglade stays in moonglade.
---
Warrior - Me warrior me smash.
---
What are you after in a class? Doing PVE, PVP, Both, what type of PVP (competitive BG's, WPvP just messing around)
---
You still can't
---
Man the good ol days.
---
healing isn't really that hard. Just read a guide and learn how to write mouseover macros
---
Orc Hunter with the same name and everything as my original 2004 character
---
I look forward to my horde druid being in catform and NEVER BEING ABLE TO CLOSE MY GOD DAMN MOUTH
---
Also your math is wrong, Ice barbed spear you would need 1,142 AP for BT to do equivalent damage as it.  
---
\[(Top+Bottom)/2+160\]/.31=AP needed for equivalent damage. (Since MS has a 14% cooefficient on AP, and BT has a .45% the difference is .31)  
---
This is the proper way to do the math. But thanks for proving you don't know how the fuck to calculate damage done by abilities...
---
Female human holy Pala I think
---
Yes but nightfall PROCS PROCS PROCS comes from a debuff? Corruption, as i fucking said in my original post. YOU USE A DEBUFF to get a PROC to gain nightfall. I never said the debuff was nightfall, I asked if you were originally meaning corruption. I never said it was a debuff...  
---
Also 900ap, is 200ap shy of even making ice barbed spear do equivalent damage with blood thirst... With 900ap, BT is going to do 405dmg, and icebarbed MS will do 480. Thats 75 damage boost every 6 seconds. Thats a 12 dps increase if you MS/BT off cooldown, which you should.
---
Thats why you save family time for when ypu need to fly from.auberdine to tanaris, or southshore to STV.
---
No I just picked a random prebis weap. Thought I was slanting in your direction since IBS wont even be available. Pick a diff weapon if ye want.
---
Fantastic, thanks for the spreadsheet. Back in the day we really didn't have any fancy math beyond random calculations done by people and discussing it among themselves.
---
Interesting to hear about renew getting to be so mana efficient, for druid hots they are decently mana efficient (as druid is the hot class after all), but usually the only one dropping them is your druid with highest healing power. (never was the one /cry was too busy being hybrid)
---
Saving this for later!
---
Facts! Lol
---
Sweet 49 more slots than I need.  If only my starting bag-space was such.
---
Bro I did some quick math dont flame me when you dont even know what nightfall does or how debuff works lol
---
You can't say random prebis, IBS is never prebis for any class, what the fuck crack are you smoking.  
---
With ashkandi which is the weapon of discussion you need 1,440 AP to do equivalent damage with BT, over MS.
---
Ok, Melisandre.
---
Sure, but he was talking about progression guilds here.
---
They can do stress testing for sure in house, but I think they might do a short beta like a PTR type thing, just to make sure everything is actually working as well as can be.
---
Don't want everything to fall apart in the end
---
Clearly a ret pala weapon
---
August 20
---
Psh 10 minutes... rookie numbers... gotta pump those numbers up
---
Stop playing dumbass games then dumbass
---
I'm sorry you chose Blizzard as your last hope for PC gaming. RIP
---
You don't think people do 2h fury in progression? Have you played vanilla?
---
Not sure if it will be available for Classic, but for normal WoW you can access the AH data using the web API.
---
End of August
---
I think you underestimate them. They're gonna be no lifing this to. They'll be ahead of most people leveling and the people that are ahead of them wont care to gank much. They'll probably be safe with their escort of 600 people following them around
---
2Mb/s is my current download speed if I'm lucky
---
Some of the most accurate analysis I've seen on these Druid build threads.
---
Of course players should adjust builds to fit their play styles and some times there are outliers but this is a great summary.
---
Some outliers are full 31 point Boomkin is surprisingly strong against Hunters and HOTW spec generally beats resto and balance specs in Druid mirror match ups.  So you can optimize a usually mediocre spec to perform very well under very specific circumstances at the trade off of underperforming at everything else.
---
Tips Out said it in here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg)   
---
Note: I'm not necessarily saying he's an authority, just that he's someone who said it. By the way he's talking about it there, I guess it's in terms of numbers on healing meters. 
---
I've seen it a few times on this subreddit as well.
---
But I'm happy and honestly a bit relieved if the above is erroneous. I just didn't know.
---
I just hope I can use the AUX ah addon and oQue for group finder that we have on private servers
---
What prebis weapon do you want to use ? Arcanite Reaper? Blackblade?
---
To give you more weapons.  
---
IBS = 1142 AP  
---
Arcanite Reaper = 1176 AP  
---
Barbareous Blade = 1073 AP  
---
Warblade of Caer Darrow = 1127 AP  
---
BRE = 1348 AP  
---
Ashkandi = 1440 AP
---
If how it works is how I think it works, you would probably have a better time using a discord bot for something like this
---
In WoW Classic, you’ll have the following character limits per WoW account:  
---
A maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm.  
---
A maximum of 50 characters across all of the WoW Classic realms in your region.  
---
Only one faction per realm on PvP realms.  
---
No overlap or regard with the character limits in Battle for Azeroth.  
---
I see post-cata zones. How is this pre-cata?
---
I mean, you flaming me like i dont know what it is, when i immediately go oh yeah, duh. I did a quick read walking to my class and didn't remember instantly oh fuck me silly.
---
Genius
---
🦀🦀 Blizzard still doesn't share beta release date 🦀🦀
---
I hope we can use the underminejournal for classic.
---
For sure this was a thing and it was really REALLY painful for some classes. Which is why when people ask if SPriests were brought to raid, the answer is usually no, same with arms warriors, ferals, moonkin druids, etc etc. There are many buffs that HAVE to be there: sunder armor, curse of elements, Improved Shadow Bolt, Nightfall, etc. These buffs would get overwritten by a new debuff being put on.
---
Apparently we are getting **less** realms then they launched the game with. WoW hit a milestone of 100m accounts in 2014. The original WoW launch in 2004 saw over 200,000+ users, across 40 servers (5k+ per server, btw). Even if just 1% of the 100m people to have ever made an account try out classic, and even if they had the same amount of servers as the original launch, that would be 25,000+ per server. I'm expecting a lot more than 1% to try Classic WoW, and we are apparently getting a lot less servers than it originally launched with.. Uh..
---
Whatever your ally says is made irrelevant by your own ideology. Your question brings up the exact issue. How is one to know which approach is correct? You can't know for sure.
---
Do what you think is right. In the end all you can do is explain yourself.
---
As someonone who is thinking of playing a priest who tries to do right by as many people as possible, I will tell you to not worry too much about such things. In the end, it's just like real life. in similar situations, ideology is everything. If after such an event your ally thanks you, you /bow. If they chastise you, you apologize. What else are you to do?
---
Do what you think is helpful. In the end, those you have attempted to aid *will* be aided. Wether they appreciate it or not is a different question. Helping others should not, in my opinion, be a quest for gratitude.
---
Most people didn’t try to go hard because that wasn’t common in other mmos like UO or eq1
---
We know.
---
You'll be fine. Unless you're retarded, you can get good at PVP as you level. Especially if you supplement with some PVP videos, and actually seek out ways to improve
---
Did you apply weap dmg normalization
---
Jesus... can the man not just answer a direct question in the forum without nerdrage? I prefer they communicate, even if they don't have anything newsworthy.
---
You're just not grinding hard enough.
---
I'll make tons of friends along the way, I'm just going to waste assloads of time on stupid shit and I'm going to love it all the way.
---
Literally unplayable
---
..well, there you have it. *I'm away for one expansion and look what they do!*
---
Honestly how many servers have survived  for a year + of naxx progression without getting shutdown? As far as I know there is only 1 and it's just hitting a year. Since it's the server to be on its surviving with 5k people online at all times but that's not how classic will do servers so I really could see servers just dying after a year or 2 of just naxx
---
Can a man not answer a question without getting nerd rage.
---
....
---
NO!!!!
---
I keep hearing Locks in PVE Raiding is spamming SB for the most part but then in other situations people say its requires high skill. What is the high skill part of Warlock PVE raiding?
---
pre-cataclysm maps but includes twilight highlands n stuff? O_o
---
World PvP and PvP is probably what I want to do the most. 
---
I also want to do a bit of raiding. 
---
But mostly enjoy the classic experience with community and helping people. Just helping my people and killing the others.

Undead rogue
---
Just another vote for these two specs, I've really enjoyed both for the time I've spent practicing PvP on various less official servers. 
---
The prior, as mentioned is great for world Ohio and duels where you pay the same easy as always, but actually deal a bit of damage. The second makes you support hard to kill, and is the go to flag carrier specc. 
---
Some of the specs your suggest could be fun, and could probably work decently if you have great gear. But as mentioned your spend a lot of talents that only come in handy in a few match ups. 
---
If you wanna do various pve activities as well, and wanna have just a single specc, they might make more sense too
---
Just because you chose to make things harder on yourself doesn't make the game hard.
---
*crit crit cit* OH SHIT AGGRO RUN TO THE BOSS AND DIE!
---
Well as 1h does better, I don't see your point.
---
we use the sheet and discord, we have a channel where officers post the guild bank inventory once a day and another channel where people post their requests and deposits so we can keep track
---
I like tanking and also kind of want to do the hunter epic quest because I never got to do it. I also like kiting. 
---
Will 1.12 have kiting bosses and elites into stormwind again? Or will there be leashes?
---
 I’d rather have this than nothing tho!
---
Be sure to go out and get a 2080ti for all this hardcore classic gaming graphics
---
I refuse to believe you kept up an accent for 2 years, wtf
---
Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime was obese by BMI standards.
---
Is the aura really not worth bringing one boomkin with the raid, like some people do with shadow priests?
---
I will quickly add the sentiment that the best DPS are the ones that show up.
---
Awesome!  That's 48 more slots than I'll need.
---
As far as I'm aware yes. I imagine we'll have all sorts of addons if there's a beta (I'd be surprised if there wasn't one) to test them out with.
---
ok.
---
release date?
---
Reverse the situation. If you were getting your ass handed to you by a rogue and a pally walks by would you want him to help or wait his turn and kill the rogue after he kills you?
---
Vermintide 2 man, that game us fantastic, I may love it equally with vanilla.  It is basically a better version of left 4 dead.  
---
It goes on sale often enough, grab it on the cheap, you wont regret it.  Fat shark has issues like any developer but they work hard to make a game many now love.
---
Vermintide as a series has flown under the radar but everyone owes it to themselves to check it out.
---
Because you have like 10+ melee all needing 2 1 hand weaps. If OEB or BRE drops in a early MC run, someone will use that for a while. BRE is very good and much better than prebis 1 handers, especially early on when you dont have much hit.
---
The idea that a 2hand cant be an upgrade for a dps warr is ludicrous.
---
Just seems it'd be easier to make a bot that lets you do   
---
`!add Copper Ore 20` to add something to the gbank  
---
and    
---
`!gbank` to display whats currently in the gbank    
---
or    
---
`!remove Copper Ore 10` to remove something from the gbank    
---
   
---
Obviously would need to be kept up to date similar to your google docs idea, just think it'd be more accessible to everyone were you wanting to continue with it.
---
Bro we have fucking cyberpunk 2077 right around the corner what are you talking about.
---
Yup, the fact that this guy even has to ask is why he's an alliance carebear.
---
Talking about flaming. 
---
This is how you started this conversation:
---
"With 16 debuff slots and proper knowledge of how debuff slots work you would realize your statement is just silly"
---
Who had the proper knowledge? Who's statement was silly?
---
I think I'll have a good enough time being a male stripper in Goldshire. 
---
Yeah, you have your laughs. For one reason or another that shit was a profitable enough business. I can't blame my night elf sisters for what they do. Then again, I was a human back then. Don't know if it'll work quite the same as a dwarf.
---
If'n I can make a few silvers that way again I'll be happy.
---
(This and various other activities since Classic allows for so many different playstyles making that one of the reasons I love it.)
---
Gnome lock or human pally. Lock will probably be main. I might want to try healing for a first time so pally alt later.
---
That’s what the internet is for after all
---
&gt; So gearing up the entire guild takes ages and how you distribute the little loot that drops is way bigger subject than retail.
---
YEP! Fortunately for those who plan ahead and have a decent officer core, should never really be an issue.
---
Tanks are priority, after that DPS.
---
Between caster gear and healer's gear is where you have most of the drama. Since many healers can use a lot of the caster pieces (when +damage counted for +healing as well)
---
When I got my Bullwinkle helmet as a druid back in classic, I was so happy, wasn't replacing that until Naxx basically, so I happily put my head enchant on it and enjoyed it for literally MONTHS following.
---
Sure it was
---
They'd be dumb as fuck to make 1 server per type.
---
How do you manage to hit level 10 in 19 minutes when it takes everyone else about 5x that time? 54 mins to level 20? ROTFLMAO! What alternate dimension do you come from? or I'm missing the part where it says that time PER level and not total time.
---
Is it official that the new ones won’t be an option, or is it just speculations?
---
I’m fine with either, just want to know if it’s official
---
Yea if they want to change vanilla they can play retail or some private server
---
Why couldn't you just use the Booty Bay AH? (serious question)
---
ok dad
---
I'm sure it has many names but I call it "riding the lightning", basically you pay super close attention to the threat meter and you learn to predict the TPS output of your tank so you can do more damage. Threat is by far the biggest issue for warlocks, combined with really hard-hitting shadowbolts (from 4k up to even 8k if the stars align) makes your threat very spiky and dangerous. Basically you have to get 30% more threat than the tank to pull aggro. The decent locks hover at around 95% threat, but the good locks hover at around 115-125% threat. 
---
Without this you will likely have to stand around waiting for the tank to gain a lead. It's not the same for the other dps classes because they all have some kind of threat reduction. Except warrior which is even harder because they only need 110% threat to pull aggro. But their damage is less spikey. 
---
So that's one thing which really shows if a warlock is good. Another thing is snapshotting, it's not always possible but when it is you'll stand out leaps and bounds above the rest. Multidotting is also a thing on many bosses and you'll have to decide when to pull your trinket.
---
Hi, /u/Mister-Medic
---
Depends on if we get a beta and if any of the addon creators gets to play it. If there is no beta or some sort of possibility to test api we will be starting without addons
---
With WPvP in mind and PvP in general, helping others I would recommend going the route of shaman and druid. I say that because you are such a huge help in pvp, where healers can turn a fight with a few spells.
---
Alternative to that, Warlock stands strong in WPvP with high amounts of control, Rogue is the king of 1v1 fights with being able to control their fights from start to finish so well. (A good druid will give a good rogue a run for their money) Hunter is the king of kiting, and warrior is always useful when they have gear....and a healer in pvp.
---
Aux is the fucking BiS addon. But as a warlock the addon I can't raid without is KTM Threat Meter. I can't even imagine playing without it.
---
Male troll warrior.
---
Because you couldn't buy your own alt's auctions
---
And 1h only does better with optimal gear. For a good portion of your progression in MC /BWL you will likely see a 2h warrior topping meters. Well, probably rogues, then 2h warrior.
---
This actually makes me want to roll Horde :/
---
Lock or Rogue
---
I've played paladin since wrath but want to try something new for Classic, especially with paladins being weak. I want to say I'll play both high end pvp and pve but realistically I'll be lucky to do one of the two. Ive never played classic (besides up to level 23 on a warlock on private server), I started in wrath. I've been leaning lock for a long time but rogue is tempting. Which levels better? Which is better in pvp? I've heard rogues beat locks until locks get really solid gear then locks over rogues (pvp wise). I've heard rogues are better pve dps until later tiers. Basically locks become gods when fully geared out, but rogues win otherwise. Any thoughts?
---
Yes. Some people don't like to raid all day and night so they just pay a guild to get item X from raid X. It's seemed more prevalent later on during AQ and Naxx.
---
Well, your expectations are silly.
---
But they have to make them larger. Server pop will grow differently than in Classic. There will be a huge influx of player right after release and then a huge drop off. Ideally you end up with about 2500 players after a few months.
---
I know that feeling too well :)
---
It was a thing, but not super common and tended to be limited to MC and maybe BWL
---
Agreed
---
Yes it was
---
You really think expecting more than **1%** (of the number in **2014**) to come check it out is 'silly'?
---
Okay so I looked at this list and it is instantly wrong. Feral druids when played properly can tank through molten core, the 20 mans, and aq40 as well as most bosses in naxx. Obvious exceptions being patchwerk and four horsemen. It isn't that they can't tank those it is just optimal to tank as warrior for them. 
---
It all comes down to player preference and ability to play. 
---
Paladins are the best single target healers in the game, their utility buffs are irreplaceable, you will bring at least 4 for buffs alone.
---
Shaman healers are the best horde healers hands down due to chain heal, water totems, and the buffs they bring to melee dps and the mana regeneration they bring to casters. 
---
Druid healers make excellent healers for fights with aoe hits, dropping rejuvenation and regrowths on everyone. 
---
For pvp it is really your choice, but if you want to dominate as alliance or horde you'll be a paladin or shaman. You can do just as well with priest and druid, druid mobility and priest shielding and aoe heals.
---
19 minutes is the time spent at that level.
---
My relatively small US server (Malygos) did not have a lot of raid/gear-selling going on IIRC. Definitely nothing beyond MC and occasionally BWL, though I guess some ZG/AQ20 runs may have also been sold.
---
It eroded server identity. Playing with people from your server builds friendships and rivalries. Playing with random people from another server takes away from that.
---
Ah, makes sense. Feel free to delete my subsequent comment on that chain as well.
---
Nobody has time to listen to that nonsense on classic wow.
---
mbps? Because this is 8 times that
---
Seems like engineering is a must on most classes haha ;p
---
Bro play something else and forget about it for now. Like holy shit lol
---
It could be possible depending on how many players they expect to play long term. Since they are using sharding for the launch load it is totally possible.
---
While there hasn't been a 100% confirmation on either of those specific topics, they did mention that an authentic recreation is their goal. 
---
[During the Classic panel at last year’s Blizzcon](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM) (especially during Brian Birminghams part at around 14:30) they talked – among other things - about how they are working on getting the look right. [They said that they can't promise a pixel perfect recreation, but they'll try their best to get as close as possible](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1547). Take that as you will.

Might want to upgrade to the lowest level of DSL.
---
Ill do Paladin i like how you basically just focus one person and stay back a bit more.
---
For Secondary specs engineering and what?
---
great stuff.
---
unfortunately, this old thread from 2005 has consumed most of my workday.
---
no one knew anything about MC back then and I wish i could go back to being that naive
---
ITT: many people who have no idea what the difference between MB/s and Mb/s is
---
I apologize, I also did my math wildly wrong.
---
After reconsulting formulas doing this what I think is now correct following [this](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Normalization) here is the new value for each weapon.
---
IBS = 1652 AP
---
Arcanite Reaper = 1701 AP
---
Barbarous Blade = 1552 AP
---
Warblade = 1631 AP
---
BRE = 1951 AP
---
Ashk = 2084 AP
---
I do apologize for giving you the wrong numbers, originally. Check this math though, cause I maybe messed up something.
---
Edit: Minor text fixes
---
(and some who do)
---
I think you messed up the links, Twilight Highlands and Uldum are definitely post-cataclysm.
---
It was done, yeah, but there wasn't a large amount of incentive since gear was extremely limited and there weren't any achievements or what not to show off. and you could pay for a run and get nothing for weeks because of the large drop tables and low loot amounts.
---
And lower end stuff was so easy to get pugs for they usually didn't bother for those. It was basically BWL and AQ I think I remember seeing some offers to sell spots on. And that was pretty much after a lot of guilds had given up on progression due to TBC looming on the horizon and were just trying to build up funds for when TBC dropped.
---
Though because of the massive rosters, it was actually pretty rare to actually be willing to sell loot since you'd still be gearing your down raid people for months potentially.
---
Keep in mind, TBC halved the raid size but doubled the amount of regular loot dropped. It showers you in gear compared to what vanilla does. And made it easier to gear up your whole raid team quickly, especially if you got good luck on drops.
---
Keep this in perspective. Karazhan drops Vanilla 40 man amounts of loot, but with a roster 1/4 the size.
---
It was 4, they changed it in 1.9 to make 10 per cast.

Until then its corehound tooth and dooms edge +15agi

I mean, I was wrong there. But stating I didn't know what nightfall is, is also wrong and silly lol.
---
Human Paladin 100% until earlier this week...when I remembered that I've always wanted to have Benediction/Anathema. Now I'm not sure. I don't plan on having any alts for quite some time, so what I choose feels like a big deal. AoE farming vs Shadow PvP, Benediction vs Judgement Armor, Mind Control vs Bubble...ugh help.
---
Link your provided includes TBC data
---
Show me, because I conjured a lot of water at 4 per cast for 2 years. A LOT of water
---
Edit: welp we're both wrong and we're both right
---
I would happily bet you thousands of dollars that 90% of those people don't even know that classic is a thing that is going to happen.
---
Jumping back and forth across the gap in IF between AH and bank. Bonus points for spins and the extra challenge on a 60% mount.
---
Lmao wow in VR? Surely you'll get such of it in a couple hours
---
Where are you getting a 14% coefficient on AP for MS?
---
Cover 'em in thick storm clouds or something so they aren't visible :3
---
how much "easier" would you say it is as an Alliance lock when it comes to threat management? (due to pallys) Also what is "snapshotting"?
---
i started lock end of BC and raided relatively hardcore in WOTLK so limited knowledge about lock in vanilla outside of the basics 
---
thanks for the helpful insight
---
Our receptors are just fine but there is a balance to find, makes total sense that inconsequential rewards can't bring fulfillment.
---
I'm in a similar situation. What is your reasoning for choosing Priest?
---
and I'll happily bet you thousands there will be more than 1m people who play Classic.
---
They can't be sharding servers *that* much. Even if they figured 20% of retail tries WoW Classic, they'll need WAY more than 3 servers, with extensive sharding. And it will be much, much bigger than that
---
Corehound tooth is unique you can’t use 2.
---
[I need my fix](https://i.imgur.com/QERF6jT.jpg)
---
its 
---
Dal rends with +6 elemental slayer until DM
---
Barbarous Blade until BWL
---
Corehound Tooth and Dooms Edge until ZG
---
Fang of the Faceless + Warblade of the Hakkari until AQ
---
double Pugio until Naxx (good luck getting Armaments especially on Hordeside, the Pugios are only a tiny bit better you actually dont really need the hit so ZG weapons are more than fine)
---
The Eye of Nerub as ultimate endgame
---
Nice, you're the second person that's recommended me that game, I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!
---
I dunno why i said 14% coefficient, its 14 ap = 1dps on weapons. I just mispoke there which is why I had to correct my math in my most recent comment.
---
0 characters per RP-PVP realm. QQ
---
Engineering and enchanting will be profitable and give you utility, making your own enchants from farming etc.
---
See, this is exactly where I'm thinking that the majority of people having these discussions are a total bunch of arrogant assholes. A single forgotten mechanic doesn't nullify or disqualify the ability for anyone to join a discussion. 
---
I certainly was wrong and people are right to point it out. But asking a question like this is just utterly uncalled for and simply classifies you as nothing but an asshole. 
---
In general I feel qualified enough due to my knowledge of classic as I've played it more than most people have (regular vanilla, not private servers, that is). And while the meta nowadays is certainly much different nowadays than it was back in the days, GENERAL knowledge to most fights still apply.
---
Stay ahead of the meta.
---
You underestimate the amount of people trying wow for a couple months/weeks. The peak subscriber count (12 mil) would be a much better number to go off of.
---
Which is a totally different discussion. Bringing this argument up would basically mean that half of your raid consists of warriors, right?... Not everyone is an elitist like this. In fact most aren't.
---
Warlock is far easier to level. Pet classes are pretty sick when it comes to leveling, and warlock stands strong because of lifetap, and drain life.
---
As for Rogue, 1v1 kings.
---
In PVE, ranged have a good spot in raid, but if you are looking for engaging rotation..... mashing shadowbolt over and over again, may not be too exciting. (Rogue too, backstab/sinister strike and mash slice and dice when yours is about to fade)
---
As for PvP, warlocks do have a good amount of control with fear and seduce, as well as dots, and curse of tongues utility.
---
For BG's like AV, warlocks are a ton of fun with huge AOE damage everywhere, or sniping healers. Rogues have a bit harder time trying to get in range of the enemy raid.
---
But in smaller scale PvP like WSG, being a rogue allows you to get to key locations and take out a flag carrier, or stunlock a healer.
---
Sorry for the naming snafu, I had lots of generated exports and files. Links are updated
---
Thank you for sharing this. It is good to hear that you had success leveling cooking without slowing your leveling.
---
There are mmos currently that use single mega servers. If blizzard doesn’t expect high long term loads for classic I can’t see them making too many servers. 1 of each type is an extreme example but I do think there will be a small selection total.
---
Sorry for the naming snafu, I had lots of generated exports and files, links are updated
---
You do. The procedure is as follows. We want to transfer 10gp from alliance character Leggylass to horde character Underbite on the same account. Assume that Underbite can reach a neutral AH.
---
Underbite auctions some worthless and distinctive object for 12gp. Note 20% commission.
---
Leggylass can't buy Underbite's auction. She asks her guildie Bubblebobble to look on the neutral AH for the object, and buy it.
---
Underbite gets paid 10gp.
---
Leggylass gives Bubblebobble 12gp.
---
Only holds true during progression. Players today know so much more than players 14 years ago. We now know what to do and what not to do. Therefore about every single fight will be MUCH faster than it was 14 years ago. Meaning: healers usually have more mana. And I would argue that a player that does the melee weaving on a hunter is pretty much aware of how to avoid damage.
---
You can have no talent points selected and raid in vanilla WoW.
---
Please this can NOT be the only post we get this week!
---
&gt; scratch that rogue type itch
---
When I get a rogue type itch, I usually use my claws to relieve it.... usually on a clothie.... from behind. They usually don't like that. I can't help it, their robes make them look like scratching posts!
---
You can wear the gear without being a tailor if you buy it but you don't gain access to the set bonus which is 2% crit which is huge purely for just having tailoring, idk if it's still BiS but it's definitely still a strong set because of the amount of hit you get from it, although I think you could probably find some alternatives if you refuse to be a tailor.
---
There is zero TBC data on that page, because TBC doesn't exist. Anywhere in the files. Even Patch 1.12.1 which classic is, won't exist for another for 9 months after that page.
---
And no you did not. You cast a spell for ~6 months that summoned 4 waters. And for the entire 2nd half of Vanilla summoned 10.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0
---
Good now I can name my character Didsomeonesaythunderfuryblessedbladeofthewindseeke.
---
I don't really know because I haven't raided as Horde ever. From what I've picked up from other warlocks it seems that threat is easier for Alliance in the MC-AQ era, but in Naxx more and more of the tank's threat comes from heroic strikes and auto-attacks where windfury totem supposedly starts to outshine blessing of salvation. I'm not 100% sure on that one though. 
---
Snapshotting means using your cooldowns or specific spells when you would get a big boost from using them. Classic things like improved shadowbolt, Nightfall axe, Nightfall procs, proper trinket use and so on. I believe the term comes from MoP where you could "snap" all your dots out as your 100% crit chance trinket procced. It's definitely a private server invention for vanilla though and might have other names.

This has always been possible through addons, even in vanilla. No reason for it not to work in Classic as well.
---
Thank you for the input!! Can no class beat rogues 1v1? I've heard locks can once they get enough hp
---
Is this really a surprise to anybody? I always expected this to be the case.
---
What's driving the extreme difference in leveling time for shockadin at 56 on your spreadsheet? Their time per level somehow drops while all other specs are increasing symmetrically.
---
Pussy
---
Y’all got crabs
---
Yeah, but even if there's two servers of each type, that could potentially be a million or more people per server at launch. That would be so game changingly different. One of the main things people want from Classic is community. Besides, I think it was during WotLK, when they merged a bunch of servers they made during TBC that were empty. That seems way easier than packing a couple servers to the absolute rim on launch day, to prevent low populations a year or two later
---
Incoming Youtube videos analyzing this for 15 minutes...
---
So every group will have MC on farm from week 1? No. People will wipe all the time because people are idiots. Remember, the people who play on Private Servers and frequent this forum are the true die hards and not repesentative of the average player.
---
I tried to do MC during the 10 year anniversary a few years back and it was somehow a bigger clusterfuck than when my old guild tried to do MC back in the day. That is much more representative of the average player than what we see on pServers.
---
You are missing out on Kingdom Come then :P
---
I feel it was both, the slow and tedious was because the quests required like 30-50 mobs half the time, lots of traveling without a mount and generally lots of food/water between mobs.
---
But it was hard because, 2-3 could be mean death, anything over 3 was guaranteed death and the epic/rare mobs required more than 1 player for most classes. 
---
I just want the difficulty part, without too much of the slow and tedious part.
---
yeah you're probably right
---
The issue is that we are gauging "the community" based on what pops up on your reddit feed.  There are no news - just the endless circlejerk and boredom associated with waiting on a release.  I dont blame anyone for shitposts based on this simple truth.
---
There are also plenty of questions and threads being created all day.  Use the 'new' filter instead of the 'top' filter and itll be a breath of fresh air.  If 'new' doesnt provide anything of interest then it might be worth considering a short break from the sub.
---
Yeah honestly, the pure utility you get from engineering warrants having it on just about every class. Just the rocket helmet and it's 30 second(!!!) stun is worth it alone. You can ninja flowers and veins from other farmers, save yourself from being ganked or cc an someone if you're faced against two players. Flame/ice/shadow deflectors are extremely useful. Discombob is an inventory item with no shared cd that knocks enemy players off their mount and slows them. Sapper charges in raids and of course, having 20 engineers in your raid wipe an entire 40-man raid with sapper charges is glorious! 
---
Still, as a warlock CL I won't force my locks to have it. I don't believe in that kind of min-maxing. I do recommend it though. I'd rather them have engineering than tailoring for the Bloodvine set bonus.
---
This has existed for a while as well, and you can sort by patch/zone: https://newmaps.marlam.in/Azeroth/2/3/-70.688/71.750
---
And I think you underestimate different amount of people that almost 13m peak consisted of. Millions of people quit during Vanilla, TBC, and LK. Millions more never got to play Vanilla and would like to at least come check out the roots of the game they play and see where it came from.
---
I'm going with Warlock on this one,
---
Pretty easy to level, good sustain, useful in dungeons and raids. Shards don't require much management, just make sure you have enough, which you can do anywhere there are mobs.
---
Rotation is spam shadow bolt. Bosses have a select number of debuff slots and they wont be used by dots in raids. 
---
Farming in the only bit that may be harder, warlock will be able to chain kill easy but mage have the slow/kite aoe. So farming is probably easier on a warlock if you just want to turn your brain off while you do it.
---
Hope this is along the line of information you want.
---
Mage
---
Link you provided has rank 8 and 9 water included, which is TBC levels 65 and 70 respectively
---
[Patch 1.9.2](http://web.archive.org/web/20060323023349/http://worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch1p9.html) 
---
Mages
---
Impact - The stun effect's duration no longer diminishes or is diminished by controlled stun abilities and spells (e.g. Cheap Shot, Hammer of Justice, Charge etc.).
---
Netherwind Regalia - The 8-piece set bonus will now proc immediately upon completion of casting the spell, before travel time on the spell. This will allow the proc to affect the next spell cast as intended.
---
Arcane Concentration - Blizzard will now be able to gain a Clearcasting state from this talent.
---
Arcane Missles - Will now be able to trigger procs based on dealing damage.
---
Remove Lesser Curse - Mana cost now based on a percentage of base mana.
---
Blast Wave - Will now show spell data in the talent page.
---
**Conjure Water (Rank 7) - Will now create ten waters instead of four.**
---
Pyroblast - Damage bonus from + spell damage items increased.
---
...per region
---
Both are similar in terms of raid gameplay.  It's mostly just spam your efficient spell.  
---
In terms of world PvP both are on a similar level, though warlock is more succeptible to warriors which will be super popular, because of their fear immunity skills.
---
They both play very different in PvP, and world PvE/farming.
---
Mages are much better at AOE farming.  Frost nova + blizzard + arcane explosion is a really robust kit to farm with.  Warlocks just have rain of fire.  Warlocks are really good at soloing in a different way, with dots and pet damage/tanking.  Though they aren't as efficient at farming as mages.
---
Soul shards are definitely a hassle though.  It can take time to make them, and it takes one of your bag slots up.  People also ask warlocks for healthstones, just not as often as they ask mages for food.
---
Warlocks will be easier to get to 60 quickly, and the free mount means it will be cheaper too.
---
Don't do professions while leveling.
---
Addons existed in Vanilla...
---
If someone is willing to pay you to do it, it is a real job.
---
Depends on where you live, but US internet speed to price ratio is one of the worst out there. I'm paying 60 for 120. In my home town it was the same price for about half the speed. My current speed isn't bad considering I live in the middle of the desert, but Charter is the only ISP you can get those speeds from.
---
ROLL BACK THE PAGE YOU IDIOT.
---
Do you know how to use wikis????
---
That was the whole point that I linked the original page that ONLY has 1.9 data.
---
Is there an official source on any of this or just people saying stuff in a forum?
---
Holy Shock Rank whatever @ level 56. A bit more damage, but more mana.
---
And 50-54 are flagged as undead, so time to kill is low. 56-60 isn't slower than the rest, 50-54 is just noticeably faster @ 4.5 kills a minute ~~cause i fucked up something somewhere~~
---
Edit: plus exorcism was double dipping. Fixed.
---
Calm down lmao
---
You said it was 10 per cast when it was introduced in 1.3. Take your loss gracefully kid
---
Being a Holy or Discipline Priest absolutely kicks ass in large PVP groups.
---
Alterac Valley when you're at the Alliance choke-point bridge, you heal endlessly from afar and rack up honor.
---
That's a huge accomplishment, great job and keep at it!
---
I’m not upset, just think you’re a bit harsh.  Just calling it how I see it too, broseph.
---
Speed running doesn't fit in vanilla but it's going to happen. Dungeons and raids aren't meant to be a race, they're meant to be enjoyed. Why do you think noone talks in mythic dungeons? Cause they're too busy rushing to the end. I'd rather have an hour long UBRS run where people are cracking jokes, interacting, and I have time to enjoy my coffee, then do UBRS in 20 minutes with not a word spoken so a bunch of people can brag to their friends "liek wow I'm so good at this 15 year old game"
---
Hey guys, seems some of ya'll enjoyed the last few semi-sarcastic lore videos I've done in the past, so I'm back with another. The Kingdom of Alterac in game is nothing more than a bunch of ruins at this point, but it used to be a thriving civilization. Part of what makes this area so interesting imo is how ambiguous it all is in-game. There's practically 0 quests in this area outside of killing elite ogres, and much of its history is very casually addressed, if at all. 
---
Given this, I wanted to flesh out the history of the Kingdoms rise &amp; fall, and the treachery they committed that resulted in its ultimate destruction. Makes for a good story, especially considering they were complicit in almost wiping out all of humanity. Kind of a dick move. Hope ya find this entertaining!
---
If you're going to be soloing a lot, my vote is Warlock. Great survivability, take on multiple mobs at once, take on mobs / quests of a higher level. Not complicated, either - send out the Voidwalker (Chardok! I miss you!), toss out some DoT spells, wait.
---
As you get more experience, you can DoT up multiples. And if the playstyle gets boring, you can respec into Destruction for a different experience.
---
This is an oversimplification of the class, but when you learn the basics, you'll start doing crazier crap.
---
They did have their Q1 earnings call today.
---
[https://investor.activision.com/events-presentations](https://investor.activision.com/events-presentations)
---
It should be totally fine. You'll have a little low mana at times I'd guess, though. That's the roughly the spec I was gonna go before I landed firmly on not doing a Pally main
---
Sounds fun ill do pally healer first and then look at those after.
---
This is closer to what I am getting. I think then yes, MS will do more than BT but I think flurry and deathwish are still too strong.
---
Btw, I think Blackblade will be 2h prebis with the 50 stats procs.
---
Angwe had two separate accounts I believe.
---
&gt; No overlap or regard with the character limits in Battle for Azeroth
---
Oh wow, I hadn't even given any thought to this. I'm at my 50 character limit now in live, and don't really have any characters I'd want to delete. This is pretty good news.
---
Statements are summer release and second half of year for wow classic
---
Yeah I don’t know what this dude is smoking, but Ret pallies weren’t wanted in raids back then either.
---
Reading all the comments in this thread.
---
OP is pretty presumptive, and has a definition of healthy that only applies to his/her world view.
---
Seems worse when you read the replies he/she has been making.
---
OP is over-extending/imposing on others rather than coming from a neutral position. 
---
Stop telling people what to do, some people have different life circumstances. Your interpretation of a healthy balance may be different to someone else. Some players didn’t get to ‘no-life’ wow back in the day, and may have the opportunity to do so now, so let them. 
---
Not a good thread overall. Can we please downvote OP into obscurity.
---
Or maybe the planets are in alignment for launch of a Mexican sailboat! This means we can farm oysters without killing murlocs - which is good because I heard peta was getting pretty upset about that. Also carrying around stacks of Murloc eyes is rather gross. I mean, who makes soup out of eyes anyway??? I think I’ll just go steal some of Carla’s apples - she doesn’t seem to mind. Anyone for Hogger group? Plz share quets, I cannot find!
---
...I feel pretty good about my speculation here
---
Mage literally is one of the easiest classes in the game. Easy leveling, just have to drink a lot, easy rotation in raids, you have a spell, press it. Not as much threat problems as warlocks. It's annoying to make water and buff though. Farming is also retardedly easy as you are by far the best gold grinder. PvP is easy, but can also be quite hard. Mages have a fairly high skill ceiling, not even close to warlock/druid/shaman though. 
---
Mage really is the no-brain class and that's one of the reasons why I absolutely hate the class. But if that's what you want, go for it!
---
...careful what you hope for! ;-D
---
new models are complete ass, who’s asking this?
---
Druid or priest
---
Hey all I’m gonna be rolling with some long time friends and vanilla players on a pvp server. Some classes they are gonna play are Warrior, Rogue, Lock/Druid, Mage, Shaman/Paladin, Hunter. 
---
I was wondering what are some pros/cons of Druid and Priest (leveling solo/group, PVP (solo and group, WPVP and BGs) PVE (I dont mind being a healbot or supportive class). What would round out our overall comp the best? I’m the type that likes to be useful and fill in gaps whenever needed to make us the strongest. We would likely push as hard as we can in pvp and PVE given our time commitments.
---
Also what profs do y’all recommend for Druid and Priest? Is Eng best for pvp on all classes? Or should I take more PVE orientated ones? Thanks in advance!
---
Also looks like name-sharing will be a thing. So you can re-use old names again.
---
Much more pleasant than other “steady drips”
---
Do you have a soundbite? I've heard conflicting reports of Q2 and "second half of the fiscal year"
---
If you like FPS. Go play DOOM 2016. Seriously, great multiplayer that feels like a mix between modern FPS and arena FPS from the 90's, and the best singleplayer on an FPS ever.
---
You're missing out Holy Power and that's quite big, especially in early content.
---
It’s August, I was in a stock call during the announcement.
---
If their fiscal year follows calendar year (I think it does) Q2 would be end of June at the latest, which seems way too early.
---
It did exist, but a) was rarely announced in /2, b) did not go any further than MC/ZG/AQ20 c) was nowhere near as prevalent as it is today.
---
reason is simple: Raids didn't give a lot of loot, and there is a guild roster between 50 and 70 people you need to equip...not to mention new recruits. Therefore, even the loot from prior raids is still useful to you, even while you do the next one. During BWL you farm MC, during AQ40 you run BWL (and maybe even MC), during Naxx you farm AQ40 (and possibly still BWL for new recruits).
---
There simply isn't that much loot to sell, simple as that.
---
And besides: Gold is not exactly plentiful in Classic. So there is no "20kg for everyone in the sell-group"...there isn't even 50g (50g * 30 = 1500g...good luck finding someone who has that amount of gold to blow). Unless your guild is absolutely desperate for gold, or gets other compensations, what's the incentive for your raiders to do that?
---
But you never have to pull that many mobs. 
---
And if you do pull that many by accident and die, so what? Dying only slows you down.
---
You never have to actually "git gud" to make it to level 60, just need to have some patience.
---
oh come on, 99% of classic wow doesn't require heavy mechanics. Just because something is slightly harder than frostbolt into frostbolt doesn't make a complicated mechanic. Get an addon with a shottimer and swing timer and this is pretty simple.
---
Should be around 22 minute mark for 2nd half year in video.
---
For warlocks without tailoring it's BiS until maybe 5/5 T2.5, there's some discussion about it. With tailoring you'll have to get T3 chest and boots or Leggings of Polarity to replace bloodvine. 
---
It's not as good for mages though since they get 8% hit from talents and ZG enchants (where warlocks get nothing). I'm not entirely sure when they replace it but probably by AQ when fire spec makes crit much more valuable.
---
That site is amazing but it doesn't have the names of locations\areas and it still has the empty gaps\textures between zones or at zone edges.
---
Made me lol how retarded that was. I'm seeing this phrase way too much
---
I suppose my problem isn't so much the models as the textures. They were fine on old square screens but they are pretty goddamn muddy now.
---
But I still play Minecraft every once in a while so what the hell do I care?
---
Second this if you want retard friendly class in vanilla roll mage 10/10 times
---
Hellfire is better DPS then rain of fire but ok
---
You've always been able to have the same name on different servers.
---
I would go holy/reckoning cuz this is has much more utility for raiding. Something like this: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxhrxZVGbcMux
---
July still seems the most likely for me. I'm just wondering how vague a hint they gave in this conference call, because I cannot listen to it. I'm leaning on the side of vaguest, i.e. second half of the year
---
I had some real experience with the Retail crowd in Vanilla content a few years back when they did the MC anniversary thing.
---
Yes, they are just as bad as you can imagine them to be, and those will be the players that will join the private server tryhards (us, that is) when Classic comes out.
---
Even with relatively simply content, things like "aoe the corehounds" just doesnt get through.
---
Confirmed it doesn't look goofy. I ran new models on a private vanilla server for years and everything still felt like vanilla and looked fine
---
I’d say if not right away within a few days.
---
Rly good comment man don't see that here every day. Ty.
---
As an alliance player from lightnings blade, this drama was still a big deal.  I remember seeing people in the guild &lt;Huntar Weapon&gt; and i heard they were on strike basically
---
I can't view the conference call. Where are you seeing it?
---
&gt;Apparently they also cited Q2 as the release window.
---
So in the next 7 weeks? Great.
---
that would give more credit to the july 16th release date prediciton..
---
Idk to me, the dying part felt like failure, no matter if it was only a time delay.
---
Dying was unacceptable, I must avoid it all costs.
---
I can understand that there was no real punishment to the game, but as someone that always tries to push myself to do everything the best way possible, as quickly as possible, it made the questing far more enjoyable.
---
How does hunter suck with aq? Was considering playing one :(
---
D-;
---
In the conference call around 22 minutes they mention 2nd half year for call of duty, wow classic, and warcraft reformed. Only verbal, no slides.
---
Call is here under Q1, anyone can view it.
---

---
I will also be modding for the new models
---
Undead female rogue or some Druid although I dislike horde Druid options.
---
We all are...
---
Interfere*
---
Huh, that actually is pretty big news. I mean, obviously there’s gonna be more than 2, but we know there’s “at least” 5 per region. I feel like they could easily make rpvp in their then. 2 PVP, 1 PVE, 1 RP, 1 RPVP. Would make a big chunk of the fan base happy. I’ve never played on an rp server, but the idea of an rppvp sounds fun.
---
So if I have 1 battle.net account with 5 wow licenses on that account, am I limited to one faction per pvp realm on the entire account, or is it just restricted based on that individual license?
---
Half your post history is trying to correct people on their grammar, but the OP the presumptive one. This fucking sub.
---
Firts
---
They told you guys it was August?
---
Hope he murders you over and over for calling him a Boi...
---
So you acknowledge it would be an off spec warrior item (PvP)vs main spec hunter item (PvE)situation, thanks for proving the point.
---
It’s not a difficult concept. MS vs OS.
---
I’m sure there are some hunters that prefer 1H, in that case they can pass it to OS warriors.
---
Anyway it will be up to how your guild distributes loot.
---
I played on a medium pop server Alexstrasza back in classic and remember MC gear selling runs being a thing. It'll definitely be a lot more prevalent now.
---
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE!!!!
---
Is there a need to farm a lot though? After I have my professions and mount can I just run SM/ruin and never have to respec? Why else would I need gold? I’ve heard mages have a farming spec, and multiple PvE/PvP specs that don’t really overlap.
---
You da best
---
I played a lot of league and there are plenty of high mechanic moves like Riven combos that were initially impossible for anyone not a pro but as timed progressed even Riven OTPs in plat can reliably do the hardest mechanics.
---
An LFR in a holiday run for the 1st time is very different. If those same people were put into a guild and ran it several months, even most casuals should be able to pick up these mechanics. Yes, they might need a month or 2.
---
to be honest...i wouldn't worry about it too much. Bloodvine won't be avilable for probably a year to a year and half or more. Depending on how long it takes to get to Phase 4.
---
shadow priests are often argued as the best at 1v1
---
But 12k concurrent is probably closer to 60k-100k in total right? And that’s just for one region. So that’s a total of 200k-400k Blizzard is planning for, and I actually think that’s what they expect. They’re gonna have to make new servers fast though.
---
Yeah, but not the easiest sword to get.  
---
And for dmg done I think sword spec and sweeping make up some of the lost ground from those talents which are great. I think the dps isnt drastically different like some people make it out to be between 2h fury and arms. I am not saying arms is better in all scenarios, just that it isn't leaps and bounds behind 2h fury mid-early phases.
---
Those are rookie numbers.
---
Combining 2 different servers down the line would be more harmful to a classic community than sharding in my opinion.
---
Yup PI really shines in aq40/Maxx with fire mages but it's still good before that obviously
---
Interesting to hear! I'm sure back then it was a bit selfishness that made me want my PvE gear to be better. Then now there's the hindsight of talking about things becoming mini games. In the end I don't know what's best, I just know there are problems with most systems, hah. Selfishly, I wouldn't mind the TBC PvP gear system now because there's no way I'll have the time to do more than pick up raids in Classic hah.
---
Ah, thanks. I thought "Company" was a mandatory field.
---
Lets see how many times people post this comment after a blue post
---
You don't know what a lip is?
---
Sounding like the difference comes down to farming. How much of a need for farming is there after you acquire your mount and professions?
---
&gt; good stuff in the Ret tree
---
Cant wait for the 10.01 youtube videos about this..
---
Doesn't everybody have at least two accounts?
---
Summer lasts 3 months and ends 20th of september; can still be a long time...
---
Played with new models on a vanilla server and confirm they look so similar that it was hard to tell. Seeing a character with new models vs old models isn't like them being completely different races or creatures or something.
---
Do mages have to respec all the time? Read warlocks can run SM/ruin for most end game. Will mages require a farming spec, pvp spec, and a PvE spec I need to rotate through?
---
Bubblebobble was my mains name in Wrath
---
The actual quote is 
---
&gt; **We will follow this up in the second half of the year** with our most important release, our new CoD title from Activision. **In addition Blizzard will release World of Warcraft Classic**
---
So no Q2, July at earliest
---
Well, for what is worth tips mentioned they told him the plan was to have it even before summer.
---
&gt;Assume that Underbite can reach a neutral AH.
---
I've done the lvl 1 Night Elf run to Gadgetzan (on a PvP server even!).  Takes a couple of hours or so.  Expect to die a couple of times.
---
It could be somewhere around there for monthly users, hard to say. That would be a pretty small number of subs though. Even in the sorry state retail is in it still has well over a million subs. And then consider that everyone who subs to retail will also be able to use that sub for classic at no extra cost and the potential concurrent users skyrockets.
---
The actual quote is
---
new wow models look super weird, they are not ugly, but just... some how way off... every single one looks like they are on antidepression drugs or smth. praise vanilla models
---
You realize that it’s running off the current client, not the 2004 client. It’s is highly likely that a computer from 2004 will not run classic.
---
Female nelf hunter
---
You leave my warrior's ass candy alone!
---
I’ll be mostly solo but be with my hunter buddy from time to time.
---
Really? I hear they're a gas.
---
what is dead may never fly.
---
No way they will release in June because it would compete with retail patch 8.2
---
Yup, August.
---
Looks like a goddamn Phase 1 Tech Priest. We Dark Age of Technology now, bois.
---
Druid or rogue?
---
I started playing feral in MoP and pvped( I know MoP make fun of me). I loved the playstyle of bleeding, running, and healing back when I played. I fear that in classic I wont be of use in raids playing feral and if I do will be stuck farming gnomergan. I was thinking rogue but am still not sure. Can someone please help? ):
---
me too the new human female and Tauren model are ugly
---
No, you were right.  That’s how he communicates.
---
As are everyone’s at this point!
---
The true classic experience is to wait on queues for the first two weeks as they release new servers almost every day that fill to capacity.
---
So does Sulfuras and Bonereavers Edge. Both better than Ashkandi for warriors.
---
From the perspective of me fighting that other guy, I sure as hell don't want any help. Honor or Death
---

Go for Lawlbringer and let your 8pc sing.
---
One faction per realm. Good.
---
Summoning TipsOut, are we? :p
---
Then I'm sticking with Warlock. Solo, you'll be totally fine, and maybe even get a god complex at a few points. With a hunter, you guys can destroy the world.
---
You might out-aggro your demon occasionally, but you start picking up on how not to do that. (And if there's only one mob, they're still gonna die, even if they get a hit or two in.)
---
What this guy said. I also listened. This means it will most certainly NOT be June.
---
Female orc warrior. Zug zug
---
There is so much if you let yourself enjoy something. I'm super content with a TBC server myself.
---
you are giving horrible advice and don't even know how it would work. News flash, this so called Melee weaving for hunters has never even been used outside of theorycrafting. Feel free to find a hunter parse that actually used it. 
---
Yet here you are making an argument for it, despite the fact you've never done it yourself, and your knowledge of said game is 12 years old.
---
Don't give advice on something you have never done yourself or even looked into. Don't give advice on a game that you haven't touched in over a decade. How hard is that to understand.
---
You people coming on here trying to give advice when you have no clue whatsoever are why we get mad. You are just spewing bs and get mad when called out.
---
**Common Problems**
---
*How do I sign up for WoW Classic Beta?*
---
They are two different things Mr Trashtalk.  This guy just wants a simple ! on a map where quests are which is exactly what Questhelper does.  Frankly I already know what Shagus Addon is filling up my memory with, maybe we could assume this for the other poster as well.
---
For me personally, the new models ruined a part of WoW. I don't feel immersed in my character because they look like a cartoon. Also, when my Human Paladin runs it looks like he has a stick in his ass.
---
Disappointing. I hope I'm still interested by the time they finally release it.
---
Yep, as an Alliance, I'll go to duskwood and clean house+help people with Mor'Ladim every now and then.
---
Super cool!
---
Try Dell. My wife and I got an Inspiron 15 series (the 7000 I think) that has a dedicated GPU (1050ti). Cost was just under $800 USD and had 24 months to pay it off, interest free. Was something like $30 a month.
---
It runs WoW on max settings at 30-40fps and setting preset 7 (of 10) at 60fps. It also runs most other AAA titles decently.
---
That’s a valid point, but the biggest one was shut down by Blizz. Something tells me that even left in it’s Vanilla state, this game will be played for a LONG time. Regardless, you can’t close down the Classic servers and move them to TBC or new content. Like I said before if you do, people will just want the original back. Even if only a handful of Classic servers stay “original” , it needs to be left to avoid this cycle starting again. Gotta keep that original option. Keep in mind, I’m in the more content camp, but for the community, the original must be kept. 
---
It will be very interesting to see how this plays out.
---
Okay? Doesn't mean Ashkandi wont be an upgrade for you when it drops, and a dam good one at that.   
---
There are better weapons for hunters too.
---
rogue has been very pleasant to level.  my shaman has to drink after every pull.
---
F O R T N I T E !
---
This is the one I didn't do in vanilla, but plan to do quite a bit of in Classic.  I got WAY into in WOD.
---
Either that or they'll have to start merging servers early on
---
If you increase the realm population, the purists will rage
---
Yeah due to sweeping strikes. The problem is arms gets blown out on the other half + of fights that are single target. You can't even use mortal strike in 40mans due to debuff limit lol.
---
What happened to thottbot?
---
Andrew W.K. - Party Hard
---
Use to play this song over teamspeak as I led Horde city raids against the Alliance.
---
Entitled to what exactly? His own opinion? Yes, we all are.
---
Would probably make more sense to hit up Booty Bay on the boat from Ratchet.
---
Thanks for the recommendation 
---
I greatly appreciate the info 
---
👍🏽
---
Wait, there's a neutral AH in Booty Bay?
---
Let's get thottbot back
---
Flyleaf - I'm so sick

[wow band musicvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAOoRtPr5Kk)
---
I listened to a couple of these and was a little sad that they never mention Classic’s release. I feel they don’t think it’s going to be a huge deal or maybe aren’t hyping it much which makes sense.
---
This is getting silly, they are giving us "news" that no one gives a crap about. I mean did anyone think you could make chars from both factions per server? No. Give us real news.
---
I really hope it's awful lol
---
well shit, fair play
---
Looks great! Anyone figured how to download a copy of the file?
---
Oof, these classic folk wont even get that, but I appreciate your joke
---
I want to skill similar in classic.
---
Never paid much attention to paladin buffs in vanilla; was it a thing to have one BoSanc buffer in the raid, so I would have a good excuse to skill like that ?
---
I hope you're not just because you felt the need to say this.
---
Not for weavers.
---
I'm trying to get my wife to play. She played RuneScape back in HS so I've basically told her it's like OSRS but 100000000000 times better
---
It's fucking over
---
August release incoming
---
See if I give a fuck after June
---
See if I'm still around Blizzard you fucks
---
would that be against the rules?
---
These are my favorite.
---
Yeah, add-ons were 100% allowed and used in Vanilla. I remember having to download CT Raid(Mod) and Decursive for the first raid I did in Molten Core (probably 1 month after guilds began progression). I think add-ons are definitely fine - but add-ons like Decursive or Healbot should not be allowed. Automation is bull shit and it needs to be curbed.
---
I bet that blows your mind. Yes, there is a neutral AH in Booty Bay!
---
No not possible , launch day will be 24 hours long just like all other days
---
Hype death is a real thing. If you only want to play with hardcore players with blind devotion then the pservers are thataway ----&gt;
---
It's all the way around the bottom level from the boat. But yes, there is one in booty bay. A bank there as well.
---
Same I’m already losing hype playing a pserver. Getting bored
---
How though? If they're sharding as much as your suggesting they should/could, it would be a completely different game, in terms of the social aspect. It would ruin a servers community. The chance of you seeing the same person more than once, and noticing, would become minuscule. But how is combining servers harmful to a community?
---
Just watched the video, love #8, as I remember seeing someone decked out in blues/epics actually being a big deal back in the day. 
---
Keep up the great content (:
---
yikes
---
Sm/Ruin isn’t better than ds/Ruin in PVE.
---
Sm/Ruin isn’t better then conflag or SL in PvP.
---
genuinely did know sorry mate holy cow i feel really bad about this :(
---
It's interesting that they don't think this will be much of a money maker.  I wonder if that is based on market analysis and testing, or some other metrics or what.
---
Deadlifts for Durotar?
---
Players sharded are still a part of the same economy and overall player numbers. If you merged servers, you suddenly have altered AH prices, different top guilds, different top players, and a different ratio of class roles.
---
dammit.. give a better one
---
Warlocks are garbage in early vanilla and don’t get good until AQ and naxx
---
Dang, gonna need two accounts now to dish out crap talk and hear all the complaints to my mass ganks.
---
Basically, one rogue and 9 bank alts. Easy.
---
Any credence to this?
---
I hope it's more common in Classic so I can gear up my alts.
---
Quel serrar forging runs were absolutely a thing, even for my lowly guild.
---
Given the terminal nature of classic progression, it is very likely a lot of Low level epics can be sold off to pugs to fund progression.
---
even Mc has some bis equipment for high end raiders (thunderfury)  so there is incentive for geared players to carry nubs through content.
---
And how many fights are you actually weaving on?  How much dps do you actually gain vs alternatives?
---
Check out Kargo's class guides on youtube, thats how I finally picked Lock as my main. He goes into *extreme* detail about each one, including different specs.
---
People were actually thinking June? You might not even get a release date until June. Some people are so hopeful/desperate that it's just a little pathetic.
---
Jump spamming constantly as a nelf trying to beat my own consecutive somersault records. IIRC my personal record was 6 in a row.
---
The point I don’t get about enhance shaman and ret paladins is why so many people want to raid with the spec. Class fantasy aside, playing a melee class that auto attacks and pushes at most 1-2 buttons every 10 seconds seems downright boring to me. Having to invest the largest sum of consumables (to buff both physical and magical damage) and still only reaching 60-70% of other dps classes potential doesn’t seem engaging or fun.
---
Not sure about faction yet, my friends and I are still undecided. I'm playing female either way, after all, it's an MMORPG (**M**any **M**en **O**nline **R**ole-**P**laying **G**irls)
---
If we end up as Alliance, I will play a Human Warrior
---
If we end up as Horde, I will play either an Undead Priest or a Troll Warrior.
---
They’ll probably launch classic with world boss leashing. Idk what patch they added it but it’s highly unlikely kiting bosses will work. 
---
Same for the ZG plague.
---
Step 1: Always look at post history.
---
Does his post history look like someone who works there? 
---
To me, the answer is a clear and obvious no.
---
Druids are the faster levelers and can of course fill any role in dungeons etc. For pros and cons regarding PvP I recommend this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrVgogA6kU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrVgogA6kU)
---
Hey, if you wanna raid Friday and Saturday at 8pm to 12am PST (11 pm to 3am EST) &lt;Deus Vult&gt; May be the guild for you!
---
We are Horde PvE focus, we have veterans from all expansions and a core of about 30 people so far.  We are an 18+, English-speaking guild.
---
DM me if you wanna chat, we are dedicated, and passionate.  We’re going to destroy classic and have fun doing it!
---
Seeking alpha has call transcripts you can view. Think you just need to make an account.
---
Excuse you, everyone wants improved blessing of might for raid buffs!!!
---
**fewer**
---
And it's even less viable for AOE grinding/farming because of the self damage.
---
"A stock call" doesn't exist, we call them analyst calls or earnings calls. Quit your BS.
---
Summer release is so vague.   Thats a 3 month window.  Wish they would be more precise.
---
Why would you play classic on a pve server?
---
I mean you can, debuff limit with 16 slots is not that constrictive.
---
I mean they're probably the right. The amount of people buying CoD will likely dwarf classic players.
---
I don't think you realize the scope of the type of sharding you're advocating. Let's say 6 million people try WoW Classic - about 6.5 mill played Vanilla, let's assume 2 million come back. The other 4 million are people who currently play retail, or maybe played BC/WotLK and want to try Classic. That seems like a conservative enough number for me.
---
Then, let's say there's two servers per type, so six servers. That means there's a million people per server. That means there would be dozens and dozens of shards for Durotar on launch day, and probably many shards of many zones going forward. You would **never ever** be able to casually recognize your fellow players. The people in Orgrimmar will be different every single time. There would be no community. They might as well make one server and shard the entire thing, which at that point, I would not play WoW Classic. It would be a different game.
---
How is that better than a relative small influx of players and some wonky incongruities for a few weeks?
---
All I'm saying is, you may be right, I don't know, but I simply really really hope you're wrong because it would be the worst thing to happen to WoW Classic
---
Jesus. The drama you people bring is blinding me.
---
Then don't play on a private server?
---
It's not really competing, there are subs that exist that solely want classic as well as all of the subs it will bring in from external sources. This is a win win for them
---
If you synergize right you can severely limit down time making grinding mobs extremely efficient. 
---
For example, a druid and a warlock can dot pull everything, bear tank the mobs, then pop back into caster and heal the warlock while they lifetap. If you do this right you could continuously kill large amounts of mobs with no down time.
---
Warrior + healer, and to a slightly lesser degree rogue + healer.
---
Duo mages can pull off some insane aoe grinding
---
I don't even know what faction I'll pick yet really. It will be whichever community pulls me in, that's more important to me over faction.
---
If I'm Ally, Dwarf Priest (great male casting animations but terrible blocky look, great female look but worse animations.)
---
If I'm Horde...well that's a harder choice. Everyone of course says WoTF, but I'm less 1v1 oriented and won't be Shadow PvP'ing so I don't know if that will be as important a need over defensive Shadowguard blackout procs when some warrior/rogue is wailing on me in a battleground.
---
Man, I just want to heal people.
---
We'll miss you dearly
---
I agree that Vanilla servers, even if new content is made or if they move on with TBC, will have to stay. I think they will have to merge vanilla servers in the future though and possibly do like 4 year cycles where they reset if they move on to new content for other servers.
---
some people dont like pvp? i mean, im rolling pvp all the way, but im sure some peeps just wanna chill without gettin ganked a lot
---
My understanding is that there really isn't a super defined "meta" for paladin buffs. Each guild/raid will be different. It all comes down to communication with the other paladins on who has what (either talented blessings, or improved blessings) and figure out who's doing what. It's likely that at least 1 paladin in a raid will have Sanctuary, but it's no big deal if more than one has it (it's not like you have to sacrifice a different blessing to talent into it). If you talent into it, and you are never the one buffing people with it in the raid, its up to you to either keep it for use in non-raid scenarios, or drop it in favor of something else.
---
I just got a set of law lectures that runs a little over 72 hours.  Then Dethklok.
---
Before, it would have been very hard to get time away. We work for the same company, and had the same schedule. Then out of nowhere, they changed the shifts. I now have 3 days off alone going forward. I plan on not seeing the light of day on my middle of the week weekend.
---
Hammer Smashed Face
---
Warlocks don't farm with rain of fire, you don't know what you're talking about. Stop spreading misinformation to retards.
---
?????? that app wont tell you shit
---
This shouldn't really be very surprising.
---
1. I think most people took "summer" as June, July, or August. July and August are in the second half of the year.
---
2. This doesn't necessarily rule out June. If they're not certain of the release date, which they probably aren't, then they're going to be cautious. They don't want to promise investors WoW Classic cash flows in Q2 if they don't know it will be released in Q2. Surprising investors with good news is always better than surprising them with bad news.
---
I'm not advocating for it, that's just what I think they'll do. But for all we know 10 million could try classic and 50,000 stay. There's no real way to know the numbers for this and I just don't believe blizzard will create as many servers as they do for retail wow and I also don't think they will put themselves in a spot to be forced to merge later. I hope I'm wrong though.
---
You are right about the multiple mage specs. Once you have all your proffesions and mounts, only thing may be rep if you're into that. But I think if you want to make 1 spec work, lock is your pick.
---
Also game is starting on 1.12 (blue post confirmed) so you wont have to deal with crap talents/balance that existed in early vanilla.
---
I quit drinking coffee 2 months ago so that one cup will keep me awake for 2 days
---
Rogue does not get anesthetic poison until TBC
---
'warcraft reformed' :DDDDDDDDDDDD
---
1.12?
---
Yes you need to respec as mage. Their pve spec is atrocious in pvp. 
---
Warlocks take the cake here because their pve spec works incredibly well in pvp. 
---
This could be a deciding factor if you don’t want to respec before every raid.
---
I really wanted to stay away from hunter. I’m torn. I would like to play one again now I know the ropes and I’m not 10 years old. But, the mage has been calling to me as of late. I might do both because I know I’m going to have issues sticking to just one character.
---
The less people like this who play, the better for the rest of us.
---
I miss the old website.
---
Yes you need tailoring at 300 to get the set bonus but you can wear it without. The 2crit is pretty crucial for the set though.
---
Yes alex upload! I LOVE ALEX
---
Camping the chicken escort in tanaris
---
everyone loves alex
---
Man who fucking cares. Why is this an announcement
---
I love the game music. I play in my car.
---
I don't disagree that this is probably the case.  Up until now, we've received relatively "big" pieces of information from them, with this being pretty small on the scale of importance to us.  
---
Certainly they could just be clarifying their position on something that was not a confrontational issue to us, but this is pretty a first for that.
---
Damnit. Only 2 months to get to 70, farm preraid bis and raid all tier 4 and 5 stuff until classic. Grrr not enough time....push it back!
---
Grizzly Hills
---
*pardon?*
---
Holy shock is pretty much complete and utter garbage, *especially* for healing. It has uses for PvP (shockadin), but its not at all worth using for healing in raids. Holy power is pretty good (crits = more hps and more mana) but isn't necessary.
---
Hi, /u/Wowfanperson
---
I had to wagecuck to survive when vanilla originally launched.
---
I got fired at my shitty retail management job for following a shoplifter past the curb. Done it hundreds of times but the prick reported me to corporate and it was pretty much automatic.
---
Luckily I'm a minimalist so I can live in my van for about 8 years before starving out. Should be able to no-life it this go-around. Planning 16 hour days for at least the first month.
---
Linkin Park, White Stripes, early Eminem, The Killers, Good Charlotte, Rob Zombie, Gorillaz, Avenged Sevenfold, Basshunter, Muse, 30 Seconds to Mars, Franz Ferdinand, Green Day. 
---
That's maybe a third of the "'04-'06 Questing Music" playlist I've got going.
---
Youre not getting them so cry all you want you beta
---
There are a few, but not that many. Hand of justice, ironfoe, savage gladiators chest, banthoks belt and the cloth healer pants from the rock dude near the start are the 5 that immediately spring to mind
---
So it is confirmed that it is still a summer release but hear my tin foil hatness out. The individual that was giving the presentation say directly that world of warcraft would be released over the summer. 
---
To me again this means we will be playing it for the better part of the summer. I know you can say over the summer just means sometime this summer, I feel like their choice of words though reflect more towards and earlier summer release rather than later. 
---
Also they mention 8.2 after classic stating that it is already on test realms. 
---
I think we are still on par with a July 16th release
---
You're so fucking dramatic
---
Calling people pathetic makes you bold and manly.
---
Lock or rogue main. enh shaman and prot warr alts
---
It should be obvious. Classic is a recreation of a 15 year old game. The genre, MMORPG, isn’t popular anymore. The pacing and “balance” of the game is unlike anything that’s come out in this decade.
---
As much as we are on a nostalgia trip, we’re definitely a minority. CoD will have more players on any single console at launch than Classic will have at its peak. The marketing and strength of the CoD brand is matched only by Fortnite, Mario, and maybe Halo still (maybe).
---
CoD is John Cena. Fortnite is Hulk Hogan. Mario is Stone Cold Steve Austin. Even non-wrestling fans know how much weight those names carry.
---
WoW Classic is...Jerry Lawler - still active, huge back in its day, and a recognizable name...but definitely a nostalgia act that is limited in what it can really do by today’s standards.
---
Alex as usual being wrong.

  These are remnants, the files are cluttered with them, from old 1.12 files that never got finished like aszhara crater to modern class halls and the not, it's being built on 8.0 client.   
---
  This was already discussed like a month ago.  
---
  He's either being very dumb or ignoring it to squeeze some videos.
---
July 16th is summer.
---
July 16th is second half.
---
July 16th is a Tuesday.
---
Does it matter? It's best in slot for weavers and not for any other class.
---
For us at work what did he find?
---
Making them larger breaks the game, and doesn't result in normal pops after time. The game was built around the 2500 cap, when you increase it things break down FAST.
---
Actually to transfer 10g you would need to make an auction for 12.5g
---
Good ole ass candy
---
&gt;  to squeeze some videos.
---
Do you really thing people on the internet would do a thing like that?
---
yeah you're fucking retarded lol they removed most of it yet kept the shop and token addons in
---
What time approximately is this quote from on the earnings call recording ? I listened and didn't hear this yet
---
He clearly explained it's tinfoil hat!
---
did you even watch the whole video?
---
You mean the most common tactics on youtube coupled with 10+ minute videos to maximize ad profits?  
---
  Yes, of course.
---
I don't care about being bold or manly, I just care about being truthful.
---
In wPvP or a BG? If you throw even a single heal out before dying you've done a great service to your DPS players.
---
Don't sweat.
---
DO NOT TALK DOWN ON ALEX
---
Right around 22 minute mark
---
liar
---
Inconceivable!
---
If you look up anything but enhancement shaman you'll find they're top tier
---
He barely uploads and doesn't give a fuck about that! Go check for yourself you jabroni
---
TL;DW: remnants of the WoW Store and the WoW Token system are still in the files of the beta client.
---
Took him nearly four minutes to get to the point.
---
Is this satire?
---
Guess they're gonna add class halls too then.  
---
  And ashzara crater.  
---
  Oh and raid finder too that was in the files.  
---
  Sensationalized content at its finest.
---
Dude, I don't even know why you'll bother try to play Classic if you suck so much. Like there are people literally a million times better than you, from the day they are born, without even having played the game before. Classic is not something you learn. You're born good or you're born bad. Please don't try to be a healer if you know you're not good. Just go play pokemon instead.
---
Or, you know, just play like you would play and learn any other game and stop asking such questions?
---
Imagine being this guy.  Imagine having no life to live, yet the anger of a thousand neckbeards.
---
Nothing you said makes any sense.
---
Soon we will not have abs though because of classic WoW
---
Summer goes till sept 21
---
September 20.. still summer!
---
August 21st
---
70?
---
Your balls are posts?
---
So... september?
---
This isn't the greatest wow classic music thread this is just a tribute...
---
Instead of music it'll be mostly audiobooks and podcasts for me.
---
But it's not, not only this has already been discussed to death weeks ago but even Ion himself on the classic wow pannel last blizzcon stated these things like raid finder and other stuff are vestiges of the new client and won't make it in.   
---
  It's literally just talking the same thing others discussed a month later and a sensationalized effort to get attention.  
---
  What's worse is how aggressive people get when they're told the truth, what is going on with you guys.
---
Nice strawman ya fucking jabroni
---
What do you mean? They mentioned it several times on this call. It’s not considered a tent pole title like CoD, but it was part of their explanation of why Q1 was quiet for Blizzard and was mentioned right along with retail wow patch 8.2
---
Seriously? You have issue with the broad true statement that going outside the game design breaks the game?
---
I agree with your post, but AAA games like Sekiro give me hope for the industry.
---
holy handles that one though, since you never put BoW and BoM on the same people. ret usually ends up doing Light or maybe kings if he's a ret/prot build.
---
lol thanks, 
---
Honestly i dont have any reason to lie about this, it did happen. I never reported it since it was handy for soloing things. But yea...
---
Maaan, as someone who never raided and won't have much time to play but is set on Warlock for PVP (fav class) this is pretty discouraging
---
THEY TOOK OUT ALL OF THE ADDONS
---
EXCEPT THE CASH SHOP AND WOW TOKEN
---
HURR DURR I CANT READ HURR DURR
---
Any update on this?
---
This is all kind’ve gibberish. 
---
When you test components with simulated input, it’s Unit Testing. 
---
When you bring up systems and test the whole thing (i.e. internal alpha), it’s called Integration Testing. 
---
When you deploy a live client externally (i.e. a Beta), it’s called Deployment Testing. 
---
Stress tests which aim to disrupt a certain piece of the system are called Targeted Tests. 
---
Each thing does something different and aims to find different types of problems and escapes.
---
What's not to get? I straight up said even if I'm skipping spirit I'd rather have the extra point in renew or holy crit.
---
Warlocks are really the only class that benefits from Lightwell and again only on select fights with limited movement and no aoe.
---
So you end up with fights like Patchwork, Gluth, and Loatheb plus maybe Maexxna and Noth. Except one or two Lightwell covers every lock anyway so you don't need more than one or two priests specd into it. And again this is really only relevant to locks (Gluth being an exception).
---
Ofc it does. If a BiS item for you is an insignificant upgrade you only use a fraction of the time, can give to someone else. 
---
Same reason you give DFT to a melee dps over hunter.
---
Hunters always dodge the question when you ask "how much dmg does this actually give you?".
---
Hanging out with all the other degenerates in Goldshire. Stripping, duelling, waiting for the Horde to inevitably come and visit us. 
---
The key to a Goldshire duel, is to request the duel and jump around in circles until the other person accepts.
---
I’ll definitely check it out. Thanks!
---
Starting to lean more towards lock now. Thank you!
---
If so, i again look forward to being a nazjatard
---
Holy, the alex circlejerk is insane.  
---
  As soon as I posted, instantly got 8-10 messages of people vehemently defending content being discussed to death ages ago and being shown again just to put out a video, some very aggressive.    
---
  I guess I know which streamer realm to avoid now, something I wasn't even planning to, that realm is not gonna be a fun classic community.
---
It's very expensive and you need to go to your class trainer for every re-spec. The cost increases each time up to a maximum of 50g per re-spec.
---
But but... Robot man Ion said no😔
---
Now I remember why classic was full of idiots. I would've figured people matured by now.
---
Ashkandi is only BiS for one class.
---
DFT is BiS for multiple.
---
Ill be attending Joe Rogan University instead.
---
/r/betamales
---
This needs to be a thing with how much time and effort it takes to even get to level 40 for some people just to realize they have friends on a different server.
---
Basically just that remnants of the Store and the Token system are as of now still in the files of the beta client.
---
The nuisance is gold. Max respec is 50g every time. Ideally you PVE to get all your gear then break until the next content drop and PVP in the meantime.
---
Or if you can work the AH, a few days off raiding done, Respec, PvP. Next week Respec pve then get raiding done.
---
They are like the opposite of hunters. Hunters start out really strong but don’t scale very well in later raids. Warlocks scale really well in late game and are become really good in PvP. Rogues and warriors are tough for locks and unfortunately, rogues, warriors, and mages will be the top 3 played classes. I suggest orc if you want to pvp as a lock to survive against rogue stuns
---
Geez, it's mind boggling how so many here are apparently stuck at 2004 speeds. Even when I was on DSL, I had in 2008 40/8 Mb/s. And as of 2012 500/500 Mb/s zero datacaps or FUP, while not paying significantly more for the latter over the former. Hell I'm soon getting even unlimited data 4G with 80/25 Mb/s real world speeds for only 20€ a month. Do you guys live in very remote rural places, places with a lot of corruption, or just in poverty stricken areas? If you live in an urban environment in the West, it is basically criminal to suck that much money for a 2004 standard of connectivity. I really hope that Starlink and OneWeb do pan out, breaking monopolies, and will be datacap free.
---
September 23rd this year
---
Very first words of the video discredit the title. Lol
---
Sounds like you just made that up.
---
Mind controlling mother fuckers off of tall shit
---
Absolutely true
---
then look at this and explain:
---
https://github.com/EsreverWoW/BlizzardInterfaceCode/tree/classic/Interface/AddOns
---
 To be fair it should definitely be per license- but fully understand your concerns with the “Per account” part. But I don’t think it’s a thing they have neglected in the process with the integration of battlenet to classic. Fingers crossed. 
---
You should try ask this interesting question on their forum.
---
You are literally the meme in the post. How much more dps will you do w ashkhandi vs zin rokh or zg one handers? Forget the word BiS for a moment.
---
My comment was deleted but just know it was very negative😠
---
A con no one else has mentioned is that if you are a melee you will level weapon/defense skill much slower as it's based on number of hits. Not a terribly huge deal when with a friend or 2 but it makes soloing anything miserable for the first few hours.
---
Thank you. I stopped watching at 45 seconds.
---
I feel you man, shits tough.
---
I wish we could know 4-6 weeks before the release, so I can reserve/get accepted my 4 weeks vacation right on time.
---
They are probably his very own alt accounts.
---
[Welcome to Spelladin](https://youtu.be/Xlg6BqyaTIQ).
---
Gear set 1 and you're respectable damage. Switch gear and you're good healing.
---
This is a bit of an overstatement lol. Locks are average dps until ZG where they get access to Bloodvine (hit rating gear), and trend up heavily. In AQ theyre elite, and dominant in Naxx.
---
I wish
---
I don't even play a hunter. I play a rogue / warrior.
---
You're just completely moronic.
---
At level 40, let’s say, would a player naturally gather enough items to have +Sp and +Hp on them?  In my woefully small experience, that didn’t seem feasible and required at least visiting the AH.  (Which, of course, detracts from getting a mount.)
---
Just curious of yours or anyone’s thoughts about that!  :)
---
Remember that bethesda makes ES6.
---
Do. Not. Preorder.
---
Chances are pretty high that the game they'll put out will be watered down and filled with bugs.
---
yes they are mine
---
They don't play games. That's why. Big hits like these never come as a surprise to the playerbase.
---
What part of "remnants" do you people not understand?  
---
  As I mentioned around 4 times now, this has been discussed to death, it's not new.
---
ty for the clicks
---
6 months of insulin is easily the most expensive
---
I’m saying older ones like Q1-Q4 2018. They mentioned it like once.
---
I haven’t listened to this one yet.
---
Maybe dont talk down to people and they will answer you differently next time.
---
People rarely accepts what someone says as truth after this someone insulted them.
---
Also, comparing mapfiles to ui is like comparing apple and pears.
---
Anyways, we wont know until release and some time after that. Maybe they wont ever have microtransactions, maybe they will have them at launch or maybe they will pull another fast one like they dis with COD and just at them later.
---
&gt;We will follow this up in the second half of the year with our most important release, ~~our new CoD title from Activision. In addition Blizzard will release~~ World of Warcraft Classic
---
Now, I hear an awful lot that women talk more than men. But are we sure that's still true? I mean are we including streamers ? Cuz they sure do love to hear themselves talk.
---
Are they getting paid by the word?
---
This is a good point. Besides resistance potions (Ony and Rag are a lot easier with these) consumes are not at all needed until AQ40. Even then, the guilds in 2006 used very little consumes and they cleared AQ40 and Naxx just fine. 
---
For me personally, the preparation is a lot of fun on its own. I like going to Felwood and farming Whipper Roots and Dark Runes,  going to Winterspring and farming Ekos, having cooking to make buff food and having the gold to buy potions. World buffs (which may be way less frequent on Classic) were another fun part of preparation , having all 40 members of your raid moving across the world in sync to get prepared was pretty epic.  Part of it is wanting to be higher on the DPS charts, for sure, but it's also just fun managing all these buffs.
---
It's funny how people forget that this is the same Blizzard that gave us BFA, Diablo III, and Diablo mobile just because we've been getting some weekly blue text. While this doesn't confirm anything, does anyone else find it suspicious that there has been literally no mention of the WoW token from the dev team? I can totally see this modern actiblizz sneaking it in last minute.
---
Phew, would have  been a toss up between finishing the CFA or taking paid time off to hit 60 ASAP if there had been a pre-June 15th release.
---
Looting pvp items to ppl for pvp is not moronic.
---
&gt; 10gp 12gp
---
Going all the way back to Tibia for the acronyms!
---
Considering Priest again. Right now I'm set on Warrior because I enjoy tanking, but I also like healing. It's just that there is more need for tanks and they are more influential when it comes to success imo. 
---
However I'm thinking that outside organized pve, priests probably feel more fun. Not sure though. Any thoughts on healing vs tanking?
---
My guild organized weekly BWL gear-selling runs during the AQ-Naxx era to fund our own progression raids (flasks, tank repairs etc.). Iirc we had around 10-15 buyers per run with fixed prices for every item with bidding if multiple people wanted something. Items used to sell from a few hundred gold (tier pieces and other shit) up to 1k-1.5k for stuff like Askhandi, DFT etc.
---
August 20th will be the release date.
---
Unbeatable, not really, it comes down to if a class can outlast the stunlock, rogues can either A: stealth and wait and reset or B: try to finish off the opponent. As a druid main, I can usually just outlast the stunlock and land the faerie fire which spells doom for the rogue.
---
It all comes down to, if the lock can keep the rogue from re-stealthing after the stunlock ends (and surviving until that point).
---
Takes me all the way back to one of the earliest Dark Legacy Comics.  Required reading for Classic raiders, IMO!
---
[Threat](http://www.darklegacycomics.com/comics/46.jpg)
---
Waited 10+ years playing private servers and pushing for an Official Classic server but going to walk away having to wait 4 more months.
---
As of now, no.   Just us/eu
---
That guy doesn't classic.
---
soon™
---
What about pvp ? When do they start getting good would you say? Do they become great with the rank 10 gear ?
---
Well shit, I’ll get on board with this.
---
I bought this on iTunes years ago and still play it often. It’s on most of my playlists.
---
Funnily enough, they removed “Spirit” from the game.  (The stat)
---
That’s what you call ironic.

I see cyberpunk2077 like a goodngame so far.
---
&gt; Also, comparing mapfiles to ui is like comparing apple and pears.
---
Again, LITERAL RAID FINDER VESTIGES.  
---
  TRANSMOG VESTIGES   
---
  CLASS HALL VESTIGES  
---
   It's not just map files, it's a completely different client that even by release will still have vestiges, simple as that.   
---
  For the fifth time now, this has been talked to death weeks ago, this team is trying to give us exact mood accuracy at times of day, batching, etc.  
---
  There's no point in "tinfoiling" this because it was already done and was already explained, until there's an actual 100% sure confirmation that this would be used in release whatsoever, this entire video is pointless, nonsensical and sensationalized.
---
I will give you that horde towns are ass. I actually like TB though. It's not as crowded and once all faction hubs got AHs it was pure win. I've had horde quests memorized for 14 years though. I want to play a feral druid (dps) in classic and it's not really possible for extended fights w/o JoW so I've resigned myself to the faction swap.
---
Male Human Warlock.
---
did you even take 10 seconds to take a look at the link? guess not.
---
Clearly playing on a tbc server. It's not like t4 and t5 are in vanilla.
---
I made up the server cap that has been clearly established over the years? You sound like you have no argument.
---
Nice!
---
It sounds like you two now have a bet
---
If 20 minutes of family time weighs the same as 12 hours, you're either saying family time is incredibly rewarding, or that wow is extremely diluted in terms of the happiness it provides
---
Imagine CoD being more important than WoW smh
---
Yeah. Told myself that one night when a fat chick started flirting with me.
---
Wait... I HAVE NO REGRETS!!!!
---
...maybe you’re right...
---
Oceanic servers will launch a year later, just like Vanilla. \#nochanges
---
Crabs but no abs? Delicious. Crabs AND abs? Slut.
---
Human Priest but I'm eyeing Druid....
---
Is it so hard to assume that it won't be until August or September at least? If I were Activision, I'd release it after everyone has had their summer fun and the kids begin to assimilate back to their school routines. I for one hope it releases August 13th or 20th, but I wouldn't be upset if they waited until September to make sure everything is fine tuned and ready to go.
---
It wouldn't give it more credit, it would just confirm it's still a possible release date
---
Of course it isn't. But pvp items go to off spec loot tables. PvE gets priority.
---
Yes, it shows UI elements packaged in the 1.13 IN HOUSE BETA.   
---
  Why, out of all the confirmed vestiges and remnants, THIS ONE has to be the one that is actually totally relevant and possibly happening?   
---
  Because alex made a video about it?    
---
  Again, completely sensionalized video to stir up people with content that was analyzed and discussed a month ago, and it's somehow working.
---
Pro tip: if it's anything by alex, don't even bother clicking
---
&gt;second half of the year as the release window.
---
That doesn't confirm 'summer'
---
A year later? 
---
More like 8 years later. We got them in WoD lmao. 
---
Playing Classic with under 100 ping is an unfathomable dream ☺️. Hehe
---
I personally aim to avoid all streamer realms if possible, everything they touch turns into a toxic wasteland.
---
yeah my charter is like 60 something and its 100 or 200 i honestly don't remember because they upgraded a bunch recently.
---
It costs 50g, which can take around 1-2 hours to farm depending on your class and method of farming.
---
As a warrior it will probably be closer to 2 hours =/
---
You sound like you actually understand why people would want to play the game with features stripped off.
---
Can you imagine the shitstorm if they held off eu servers for a couple months to make sure the experience was authentic.
---
defend this one BlizzDrones, why are they updating the files for the token/shop to match classic https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/397545334554886144/573657527271686144/Picture2.png?width=1055&amp;height=334
---
Priest. Mana burn &gt; a lot of choices in pvp.
---
see you did not look at the link and now you try to weasel your way out of it with overly long sentences
---
From what im reading it seems the best for Paladin are mining/black smithing but i guess that does not take into account pvp.
---
Also between gnome and human not much difference?
---
I hear Retribution is good dps.
---
I don't see how having tokens matters.  At the start, no one will have gold to buy one.  Later one, who will even care?  People would just buy gold from gold farmers if they wanted it.
---
Disc priest
---
I'm thinking they definitely don't consider it a major release; more like just an alternative form of a product that already exists. When they said earlier this year around the time of the mass firings that they're focusing on development, they also said they had nothing releasing this year.  Even though classic wow and the remastered wc3 are both coming out.
---
Shadow and feral both have thier places
---
Edit: maybe not competitive but they are brought to raids for utility
---
For PvP: Shadow priest and ele sham can do well.
---
For PvE: None. Maybe feral if you're willing to farm pummelers, but you'd have an easier time just rolling an alt
---
Right beforehand they were talking about candy crush...sadly thats probably far more important to them too
---
I don't think you know what a github is, explain to me then, what is at the link that proves me wrong.
---
There are a ton of excellent features in retail.  I played BfA for about 6 months for the WoW play time since Cata and had a wonderful time.  The amount of flexibility that I had to group or raid or do dailies or whatever made the game enjoyable whether I had 30 minutes or 10 hours to play.
---
That's not classic.  In classic, if someone no-shows your raid it sucks and often with lockouts (and especially when people have no viable raiding alts...) it's a pain in the butt to cover their spot.  No-show a couple times without a damn good reason and even the best player will find themselves riding the bench.
---
But you know what that also brings?  Social accountability.  You want to be there for your friends and not let them down.  That helps you develop a relationship with some depth.  In classic, if you have to cut early it's a big deal.  Raiding becomes more of an event since they have to be well scheduled and planned.  Honestly, it's very different and much less casual friendly and that's kinda the point!
---
&gt; We got them in WoD lmao.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Frostmourne_US
---
It’s actually not that hard when you stop judging Blizzard (or Acti-Blizz for that matter) as this one big entity. 
---
So far everything that came directly from the folks of the Classic team seemed (at least to me) like they “got it”. 
---
Every bit of enthusiasm they show for the project seem sincere to me and even when they talk about some worrisome stuff like sharding, they appear aware of the communities concerns and anything but tone-deaf about the negative effects it might have.
---
Going by [the whole “fool me once, …” thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxhQXV1-kFA), I can just say that while Blizzard as a whole has lost my trust, the folks that are directly working on the Classic project have not.
---
Many of us have been “burned” before by both Blizzard and various private server admins but while most folks are able to trust one private server provider and distrust another, as soon as the discussion is about Blizzard, hardly anyone differentiates between the Classic and the retail team.
---
Vid is pretty pointless, yeah.
---
My point was just your attitude pretty much.
---
And Im terribly sorry for misunderstanding you about the mapfiles bro. 
---
No need to have them claws out and maybe your posts will be better recieved is all Im saying.
---
Shaman no question. Elemental shaman is op in pvp. Ele and enh and decent in dungeons if your geared. Enh shaman can be fun in pvp too. Shadow priest is also very strong in pvp but not so great in 5 mans. Paladin are kind of screwed because ret is not super effective in dungeons or pvp, except with reckoning memes.
---
So every hunter should get ashkandi before anyone else then? Because of raptor weaving which lets be honest is more of a meme than reality? Ridiculous.
---
Who said anything about a 2004 computer?? I said a new 300 laptop from Walmart will run it.
---
Oh yea for sure. I never preorder anything
---
It doesn't matter what people take Summer as when summer has very specific dates (June 21 - Sept 23 to be exact). They also said second half of the year which excludes June. The mental gymnastics people are trying to do to validate a potential June release is crazy.
---
All that aside, when game development studios give wide ranges like that they typically fall around the end of the range so it's much more likely we'll be seeing Classic at the end of summer, not the beginning
---
