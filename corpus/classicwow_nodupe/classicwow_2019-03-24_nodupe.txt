It's pretty much a PvP weapon for casters. With the spirit it's actually quite decent for priests, at least before they get Benediction. For Warlocks in PvE you will want the dagger from Gandling with the zelda offhand.

Worgen refugees? Knot really.

:V

It was possible back then too if you used Addons, so wouldn't make a difference for anyone who did.

Why didn't you mention wotf when mentioning shadow priests?

I still watch it weekly since the day cranius posted it

Crusader strike was in 2.0.1 the BC pre patch which you could say was BC not vanilla.

I love your videos man. Very informative and I like your calm narration style. Keep it up!!
---
I'm trying to avoid rolling warrior this time but no one else in my group of friends has any tank experience so I may be maining a warrior again. If I play a warrior it will be prot then fury for raids and i will pvp as fury like always. 
---
BWL is going to kill Classic. There's a huuuuge content gap between MC and then ZG for people that can't clear BWL (realistically, most guilds) 
---
But how much caffeine?
---
Warlocks don't rely on pvp gear as raid gear is not just an alternative, but once you reach T2 and above they become 'the' strongest caster threat in PvP when it comes to raw dmg output. The PvP set only benefits soul link 1v1 duel setups more due to the higher HP pool.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Warriors on the other hand have a hard time in the first two raid tiers as their output is abysmal compared to other classes aside from the handful of fights with the respective AoE damage to give them an additional rage source.  
---
Not to mention that they are not really a class for low time commitment. Unless that commitment also involves the gold from china farmers to cash in on all the purple crafts and BoE drops  
---
To be honest. One sentence is enough to sum up shadow priest.
---
Lock creating new chars of specific faction if it's more than 60v40%
---
Hunter is about the best class too play solo. You can even solo some group quests etc. Harder to get into a raid for sure, but one of the best for farming and solo content 
---
r/bigwhoosh
---
Yeah they would and do. Streamers (aka "media") and devs always get first beta invites so they can promote the game, raise hype (and thus sales), and obviously develop Addons. 
---
It's a cool vid, but in all honesty I don't find it much more informative than the "BS guides" he denounces - at least those I saw on YouTube. You can't tell much about classes when you speak less than a minutes about each.
---
He went on to talk about hard/soft counters of classes, and then they do not really appear. In some cases, he mentions side information, and doesn't note the most important (like talking about Druids softcounters, yet not saying that their mega-hard counter are rogues, by far the worse). He hardly talks about different specs either, which is absolutely uncomprehensible, as for most classes the differences between specs gamestyles and capability are gigantic. And then there's scaling, which is also almost not mentionned. For example BM hunters or Fury warriors are really not the same thing at launch and at the end of the expansion.
---
I mean no hate, but if you really want to make a Vanilla PvP class guide, it won't last 10 minutes ; more like 10 minutes per class, to explain all the pros and cons of various specs, hard/soft counters, and situational utility. Nice nevertheless, but not very informative. 
---
LazerKitty/ Cakeslop here
---
I wonder who got Moonguard...
---
Warlocks do the second highest burst damage in the game behind ele shamans. You want 1-3 of them in a premade.
---
Nah, I like a usable UI thanks. They were available in Vanilla and I'll want them this time around too, but you guys can stick to your awful clusterfuck UI's if that makes you happy. 
---
Imagine trying to find a group for *anything* while muted. Being muted is only slightly better than just getting straight up suspended.
---
What do you mean? Vanilla bosses are literal loot pinatas and wipes are impossible.
---
Awesome, thanks for giving me a chance man! 
---
I forgot this existed! I loved this vid!
---
do you have a source that it's coming out july 16th
---
There were a few hints/Easter eggs by blizzard that said July 16. I don’t know how to link them here but I know a lot of reddit threads were made about it
---
for pvp and pve human
---
warlocks don't have escapes, they are built to take it and kill you regardless. escape artist does little for you on that front. While more int and with that a lil bit more spell crit and mana are obviously nice it is health that is your big factor to get the job done.
---
So why human?  
---
human perception + pet's paranoia = +50 on stealth detect
---
Your level for stealth checks = character level + stealth detect/ 5
---
in other words a human can become a lvl 70 player for stealth detect, while rogues can only become lvl 63 with talents for this check - before we talk about consumables or engineering toys.  
---
In a BG or generic pvp situation you can see a rogue in stealth 60+yards in front of you as we will start with 1.12 long after the plentiful stealth nerfs that many private servers seemingly never incorporated properly
---
Old AV didn't require coordination. It only required stamina because it was a pure grind fest that lasted for so long that most people gave up at some point. Hell my little brother even thought that it was just a instanced special zone that you could freely leave and join again. He didn't actually know that it could be *finished* for quite a while.
---
The rush meta is entirely up to the players. If one side decides to play defensively, which often happens, then the game is prolongued because of their decision and influence. "New" AV isn't perfect in any way shape or form, but it definitely beats the boring ass grind that we had before.
---
I saw it mentioned somewhere they were going to provide the option to switch between
---
Great video as always Frost! One question, that bit of video at the very beginning with the Night Elf in the tower and the Tauren replicating the Tauren in the original trailer, where is that from? I've seen them multiple times and have no idea what the source is. 
---
RP realms are Normal status with focus on RP. Which means any member of the opposite faction have to flag them self with PvP to even have world PvP at all. Events can be created of course until blizzard stops it because of server instability.
---
Having an RP-PvP realm IS an RP realm. It just has the same rules for PvP as a PvP realm instead of a normal realm.
---
It's not a "I can RP or PvP". It is an RP realm, with PvP ruleset. Which gives the whole classic experience with world PvP and all. The danger, the war between the factions etc.
---
Resources were available to do what we have now, obviously with less info than today. Either you were just ignorant of them, or are posing as an original Vanilla player. Regardless, your comment is silly. 
---
Not sure what you’re talking about. 
---
If you want to heal then Paladin is a good choice.
---
Wrong!
---
I wont change...  i havent changed... help.
---
I sent you a Private msg 
---
[Thunderbrew’s Boot Flask](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=744/thunderbrews-boot-flask), if I end up playing Alliance at all.
---
Your story brought a smile to my face, man I miss the good ol days not a care in the world just playing WoW all night with my friends.
---
The proper counter-question to that is;
---
How does it not matter? 
---
/s
---
If he goes SM Ruin his farm will be fine. He can even go and pull off the old hunter maraudon farms. True without skipping that much trash, but it's not like the earth elementals in there have no value as they drop elemental earth and that turns into pure gold when AQ40 comes around
---
You should have purchased a krol blade off the auction house like I did...
---
No Ret or Enhance information.
---
The first is so much better
---
min-maxers ruin AV   
---
In their language, "Turtle" means "Anyone who actually wants to play PvP"    
---
  
---
AV will just be everyone rushing to the end boss and you'll get raged at and called a "fuckin retard" if you try to actually have fun in the game
---
Sounds like you guys made some good memories hate you lost contact but still sounds like a fun time. 
---
And now you're right where I want you. You see, I knew you would think that you knew I had thought you had thought I had been bamboozled, but I anticipated your plan all along. You see, in this complex game of chess: I am but 2 steps ahead of you.
---
I recognized your reddit name and remembered your awesome WSG and AB guide! :)
---
I've never known about class lineups in battlegrounds, I hope I can be part of a good PVP group in classic.
---
Your family and life must come first obviously. Maybe not everyone on this thread is thinking about it but of course you are.
---
That said, if you can grind rank 7-9 you can raid MC once a week. On a class like druid that will quickly get you lots of tier gear and good healing shit. I also think Druid is a good fit for your needs, as you seem more interested in versatility and freedom than hardcore minmaxing.
---
Man this brought back soo many fond memories from high school. My best and I’s go to snack combo was Restaurant style Tostitos salsa with scoops and Code Black Mountain Dew.(the second version that actually tasted good)
---
I remember hovering over his shoulder while he aggravatingly looked for Hogger for the first time.   I was hooked, and pretty sure the reason I was hovering was because of said salsa lmao
---
But this is super subjective... I love raiding as a mage but some just see it as conjuring water for 30 minutes and then spamming one button for 3 hours (frostbolt).
---
sharding wants a word with you
---
so sad :(
---
my little brother thought cats were girls and dogs were boys so I'm not sure we should count on the ideas of children 
---
Been following your guide for a bit now and I'm loving it, thanks for all the work you put in. The only thing I'd like to see on top of what you've done is a pre-ranking pvp BiS list. I image many are the same as the pre-raid BiS list however items with no stamina on them would need some new alternatives. 
---
because this/his list is basically only about coordinated premade BG farming with short mentions of what 1v1 or world pvp can or could be.
---
For what it's worth in such setups warlocks are just your strong caster dps while mages drop more and more into the control the battlefield role as gear progresses
---
I pretty much hated on new orgrimmar from the get go. It's weird tho that even with the revamped zones being 9 years old. All the zones feels "new" to me anyway.
---
We're not taking your jobs. We're doing the jobs you don't want to do. Not enough Dwarves are in the medical and engineering fields, so we're doing that. Same with corner shops. Where are you getting your groceries and what not from?
---
Y'all love Mechanostriders, but none of y'all wanna go into engineering. Y'all just wanna go into blacksmithing and expect mechanostrider plates to put themselves together and start running.
---
7/11 chili dogs and soda made me gain a fuck ton of weight playing WoW lol. Once I cut that I dropped like 80lbs. Gotta be more mindful this time around haha.
---
I don't mind some aspects of the new graphics, but I hate how some race models look with them.  Tauren look like Pixar characters, for example. 
---
Yes, 100%.  Turtleing ass a hunter is the best.
---
oh don't be like that. It ain't like there are two guildbreakers as the first and second boss in the raid
---
oh wait - nvm ;)
---
So what about raiding as a mage is more fun than raiding as other dps classes when you have pretty much the simplest rotation plus the monotony of conjuring water? I’d be interested in what aspects/differences you think are pluses. Do you find ranged dps to be more fun in general, where you have a better view of the fight, for example?
---
Like you imagine yourself being you, so basically it's a you in side you.
---
i ate pizza for dinner 22 days in a row during my honor grind.   
---
Yeah it can be removed by WotF as well as some class PvP trinkets. All I meant was that Dispel Magic, Cleanse, and Devour Magic do not remove it because it’s classified as a physical Fear
---
Thanks man that's always awesome to hear :)  
---
I'm not good PvP player enough to tell people what to do or wear so.. I can't really do that, sorry :(
---
Spamming blizzard/rain of fire = pvp
---
No like a little biatch
---
No like a little whiny biatch
---
Well, in 4 months we will know it for sure xD
---
During the demo I was testing the possibility of drain tanking, and improved drain soul is one of the key abilities for this way of leveling.
---
(I played as a warlock since TBC, so I'm familiar with the class archetype.)
---
Sounds like nonconsensual sex, but with myself
---
Bruh  ;(
---
5-10 allies on the bridge has won many AV games in the past. Horde pug zergs often get cold feet and attack one at a time into the ally pack.
---
The same principle goes for the chokepoints in horde base, but that’s more AOE-based. The bridge is king for this shit.
---
New org is too smoggy and industrial. 
---
If you do non consensual sex with yourself, is it really rape? Or is it masturbation?
---
Your accent sounds similar to that of a Goblin. I sense bias.
---
Too much. I'm too hyped for Classic WoW, Halo on pc and Cyberpunk 2077 to even play any games right now, none of them live up to my hype level. Trying to hold out and not play a Vanilla pserver to preserve my enjoyment and not "waste" time progressing on something I'll never touch again come Classic but it's so hard!
---
If you don't like grinds you might be better off sticking with modern WoW. You're right that the meta is up to the players to an extent, but meta always shifts BASED ON game play/balance changes.
---
Zerging to single heal/tank a general with his four buddies with an optional speed bump at the enemy captain simply wasn't possible in the earlier iterations of AV. When you remove the modern rush &gt; collect token &gt; and requeue honor farm you have very different gameplay. You get a version of Alterac Valley where the team has to work together to hold or knock down enemy towers which is the very definition of coordination.
---
Done! Doesn't look like people are as into the idea as I thought they would be lol
---
Hey, I dig it!
---
I should have lathered my praise more. Often we forget how loud a small voice can be! 
---
It was there in the alpha/beta and removed before vanilla went live
---
LETS DO THIS!
---
ah i see
---
I was in 5th and 6th grade then. So the vanilla routine was to get home from school, pour a Mountain Dew into a glass with ice, get a bowl full of cheez its, and play a hunter REALLY badly. 
---
I don’t particularly care for Mountain Dew anymore, and I’ll be 25 when classic launches. I am however going to embrace it with a bowl of cheez it’s and a Diet Pepsi after work. 
---
Hey, where'd all the trees come from? :)
---
You sounded the same, I did not notice that there were two different people. I am tired of catching you for substitutions, compromise and other cheap tricks that are needed to take away. Now you are trying to pretend that I was asking can i be disagree with something? Although in reality and let me highlight it so that it is clearer
---
Question from real world: Expected that customers solve game problems?
---
Question from imaginary world: Сan i disagree with something?
---
Noticed the difference? I did. Even being legitimately challenged with low brain power. And you continue to pretend that I ask the second and argue or how it seems to you to reveal the weaknesses of what does not make sense, because it does not come from me, but from you. 
---
&gt; Finally I didn't say what you quoted in the last bit about asking people who are against sharding what their argument is 
---
imaginary quot:
---
&gt;people who are against sharding what their argument is 
---
real quot:
---
&gt;  what their proposed solution would be 
---
argument-solution, solution-argument. Two different words with two different definitions unfortunately.
---
You'd be fine with a casual guild that isn't picky about who raids. But they'd only let maybe one ret go. Paladin blessings are still the absolute best buffs in the game.
---
this sounds more like a desperate I made a leather BiS list and figured out that hunters are going to roll on leather
---
''
---
*pls huntards don't roll on me leather stuff.*
---
*me throw bone on shoulder see? because there are even better options for me!* 
---
*bad huntards all them shiny weapons are for mah collection if I decide to respec you don't need them they are just buff slots*  
---
*''*
---
not to mention that the devilsaur part only applies to horde as alliance with kings has much better options on those slots 
---
like plague hunter legs
---
It's gonna be a beautiful summer, boys. 
---
Despite becoming a meme, Mankirks story is quite sad too 
---
i have this item on my old mage i started back at the start of wrath, is this no longer obtainable?
---
The feeling of disappointment when I logged in after the shattering and saw the new org.. I'll never forget
---
My favorite quest is still Until Death Do Us Part. That was the one time Wow made me actually feel melancholy. 
---
My feelings are there with you my man. I love playing ret but no one loves playing with them. At this point it's hard to say though, we don't know how the population is going to be for classic and some guilds might just need bodies to fill a roster and low dps is better than no dps so we shall see. Likely you'll see major success in raids as a healer and you might be able to pick up some spare gear for ret but if you want to be cutting edge playing ret is highly unlikely 
---
No serious guild will ever let you raid with them as ret, the only real viable spec for paladins in raids is holy.
---
I'm pretty sure there are calculators with better specs now. 
---
And I'm not even memeing. I'm pretty sure phones have these specs, too. 
---
Uh, the thread was about something specifically for developing addons and beta’s are obviously not put out to help people make better addons.. Also, I’m not sure why you’re telling me stuff that everyone already knows lol
---
i think a lot of aussies inadvertently rolled on east coast servers which increased their ping a lot. if you rolled on any of the west coast servers it was max 250ms and more like 180 if you had a decent connection.
---
Rogues definitely don’t hard counter Druids. Druids can trinket stuns and Faerie Fire makes it basically impossible for a Rogue to even play his class
---
I have not heard this video since it came out back in the day. Still hilarious. Funny to think that 11 year old is now in their mid 20s, possibly getting ready to play Classic WoW 
---
No.
---
I wonder why, just not strong enough or
---
As a guild master I can safely say yes
---
It's very very likely. I think the 330ms thing comes from people playing EU private servers. I will say though that ESO had terrible ping and that was based on Texas I think (lots of checkpoints in the routing for sure!). 
---
yeah that was my feelings on the issue too if worst comes to worst I would have to roll a different class but we'll see what happens when the time comes lol.
---
You would be either using Imp to buff your party, or Demon Sacrifice Succubus for +15% shadow damage.
---
and that was pretty much the exact spec of the dell I started playing wow on with an addon gpu
---
Whether or not im a goblin is irrelevant. Also if you like using zeppelins you better watch ya mouth boi.
---
I just want you to know, that the level of attention and consideration for the "classic community" has brought me new hope for the direction of blizzard and WoW. I've almost unsubscribed from retail at least a half dozen times. The thought of classic being right around the corner and it being on the same subscription is probably the only reason I'm still playing BFA at all. Thank you.
---
I used to be a pretty hardcore Atheist, so my family kept buying me “Jesus Candles” (those long skinny tube candles that are about 1 foot tall and only like 3 inches wide.
---
I had so many Jesus Candles I eventually started to actually use them, so my gaming desk always had a little Jesus shrine on it with burning and flickering candles.
---
I’m going to buy some of those candles again for my desk when the games become released!
---
[removed]
---
You should be able to find a guild that fits your schedule. Weekday evenings and weekend afternoons are common times for most adults to raid.
---
Yes?
---
Sounds like your joke sucks.
---
why do people think that retail av started at 1.12
---
True, I do dislike certain models. Tauren and certain Night Elf faces in particular. 
---
Ah, I understand where you're coming from. The  "MMO from 15 years ago that, upon first glance, has aged extremely poorly..." line was directed at things such as the character models, gameplay and quest designs being a way of masking grinding. I like these things, but some people will look at these aspects and be turned off.
---
Now, I understand why you misunderstood me. It's because as I said that line I put up an image of a shitty, zoomed in human character face model. That visual I provided probably implanted in your head that I was referring to the graphics of the game, and while I believe some things look really ugly, most of the game holds up relatively well by today's standards. 
---
I have this staff on my Druid in retail. Unfortunately the Fiery Blaze enchantment doesn't show up on it presumably because it already looks like it's enchanted with Unholy.
---
I think you can sac succ and then summon Doomguard. Alivetv mentioned it on the tips out warlock deep dive 
---
You do you. There will always be spots in 40 man raids for non hardcore world 1st guilds 
---
&gt;"Wah he's w­hite so he must be ra­cist wah" Sad cu­nts
---
wh­ites are rac­ist­s. you need to calm down your pe­rsec­ution com­plex. 
---
You lose control of them after like 5 minutes I think? Doomguards took 5 people to summon and it randomly killed one of the 5 summoners. It was known as doomguard roulette.
---
Same!
---
Nah no way he vendored it. That shit has a stupid low drop chance and has good raid utility.
---
The twin towers at frostwolf are great foe holding people off.

I am australian and it is right. Summer goes from 1st December until 28/29 February.

---
Man*krik*
---
Josh, love your podcast! Just want to give you a shout out, you've really got a knack for interviewing people. Like professional level.
---
Thanks for entertaining me in my 3 hours of commuting every day!
---
Nope! I don't think there will be much of a problem (I could be wrong). I like the idea of server only PvP. I only say add it in Phase 6 since in the actual iteration of Vanilla they *did* add it at the launch of Naxx. So I literally only want it to be added and added then because it would be more authentic to how it was back in the day. Not because if think it's better or anything - purely to be authentic to the same original experience.
---
I wouldn't be mad if they never added it, but think it makes the most sense if we're already  mimicking the patch cycles (not verbatim, but a replication) via phases, it would make sense to just make cross-server Battlegrounds replicate how they were back in the day: Not a thing, and then became a thing at the end of the game.
---
That’s what happens when you let goblins in 
---
Yeah I set a vacation for it, they wouldn’t have made multiple references to it for no reason
---
I agree with caps below 5k pop (with possible xrea bgs) but 50g respec is bullshit and no it doest help with gold sink.
---
I played on both 10g and 50g servers over past few years, and economy is purely decided by farmers and AH players.
---
Some middle ground of respec cap will defo produce higher quality of play - people not raiding in gimped specs, actual joy of respeccing for pvping, healers being available to farm in their dps spec.
---
Thing is, some classes have it easy and can do everything in one, some dont, its not fair.
---
I just wish I still had the original box. I was a dumb and threw away all my PC game boxes when I was younger. 
---
You stream by chance? Down to follow that too
---
Truth. I finally got into witcher 3 a bit but still hard to not wanna play wow

You mean every class but rogue? Hehe

I don't think they will make  anything new like that for Classic

you actually booked holiday based on reddit tinfoil hat theories? lmao bruhhh you're gonna be working when classic comes out, just wait until they announce actual date
---
Half the guilds on the server will turn you away without any consideration whatsoever.
---
Hardiness ofc, its broken
---
All these comments are making me seriously hungry for pretty much anything you’d find in a 7-11.
---
ret is not good in pve, if you don't want to heal in raids you should realistically play something else 
---
if you pick a class that can heal you will be expected to heal 
---
Well, yes and no. I have 6 weeks due to my tenure with my company and I also need to set it rather early.
---
 So I set one for April for yard work, last week of June for relaxing. Last two weeks of July for tinhat. Last week of August for WoW. Last week of September and first week of October. Also for WoW.

---
I remember the day I found out clicking excessively on units would reveal special audio and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.
---
He’s one of the OGs
---
I love how detailed it is, fun read.
---
This is quality content.
---
Wotf is overrated fiteme
---
Something odd that I realised when considering this is there are two specs where I actually didn’t look forward to getting new abilities because I was struggling to do well with what I had. These were Warlock and Hunter, it sounds weird but I didn’t get a buzz from levelling up because it felt like I was falling down a well of complexity. 
---
It's not dumb speculation at all.  
---
Based off all the facts uncovered, it's a perfect Easter egg, imo. 
---
July is self explanatory, Osconty is a level 16 gnome.  
---
Osconty recorded a patchwerk kill July 16th, 2006.  
---
July 16th, 2019 is a Tuesday. (Classic is almost guaranteed to launch on a Tuesday). 
---
Depends on your class.
---
I consistently level on drums of war (1.12) servers between 5/8 days played class depending. 
---
Fastest for me is feral Druid and hunter followed by warlock n priest. Slowest was warrior n rogue. 
---
Will definitely be pounding Monsters and some slices. Might even get a group together at a buddy's house for questing.
---
"You do you". The problem with that comment is that you are part of a team with 39 other players. We are not talking about like 5% less damage but around 70% less damage. It's a pretty big deal. If the other players arw fine with that then sure, "you be you"...
---
Hardiness boi. It’s more than 25% anyway. I thought it was near 30-35%. I do know that it’s broken AF 
---
Imagine playing classic again to ah camp though
---
Same for me...

My ultimate goal is to stream actually, and i do have a twitch:
---
https://m.twitch.tv/smooth0perat0r/profile 
---
Right row though i just dont have the time to stream, work and make videos. Its nearly impossible to grow using just Twitch. So until i can potentially build a community on YT &amp; transfer it over, its basically inactive. Your interest means a lot though man, ty.
---
Never
---
Unlikely. They don’t want you to compete for gear with all the fury warriors who are top dps. 
---
I still don't know the reason why legendary weapons cannot be transmoggable. I have Shadowmourne in my bank aswell and I really hate the fact that demon hunters can transmog warglaives and other classes cant.
---
Shit why was I an undead warlock again?
---
its not confirmed therefore it's speculation
---
Whelp, Cataclysm has been around longer than the time between vanilla and Cataclysm.
---
Is it overrated because there are so few Alliance warlocks, or is it overpowered and hence there are no alliance warlocks?
---
On raid nights I'll likely go back to a bag of fireballs and a gallon of tea but since I'm older and have to work to stay in shape I'm going too avoid all the soda and chips. 
---
I don't think I've ever seen a tidal charm used out in the wild.
---
That or I resisted it and just never noticed.
---
5% base + 25% racial.
---
Orc Warriors with Iron will can get 45%, which at that point makes them essentially immune to stun.
---
I love your work.
---
Do a mage next!
---
Hot Pockets. Especially ham/cheese and meatball ones. Couldn't tell you the last time I had a Hot Pocket, but back when I started playing as an 8th grader I would always eat those when I played. I remember faking sick a couple times and just playing wow in my Pajamas eating Hot Pockets for lunch in the middle of the week. Felt like the literal height of luxury. Impossible to see Hot Pockets and not think of Vanilla/TBC for me.
---
The dinner of champions. 
---
If my friend and I get level 20 the first day I'm going to be happy
---
There has to be a proper orchestral version of his somewhere
---
Bro...do ret the best you can...if you top 10 dps, show up to raid, do your job, help where ever you can, have a great additude, any guild who won't bring you is to try hard or plain retarded. 
---
My pleasure, thanks for the kind words! Happy to help with the commute :)
---
In the demo we had modern Shadows, Water, and Texture Quality. The textures are really not noticeable don't worry, you'd be incredibly hard pressed to notice it. The shadows and water are great in my opinion, however you CAN disable them and go to purely Classic settings. There's even a Classic button that sets all settings to what was max in 1.12, not including resolution
---
What class is Wolverine in WoW? Is he a tank because he can take an incredible beating and he draws some mean aggro? Is he a rogue because he can slice and dice and is a bit emo? Is he a Druid because he can heal over time, slice and dice, and take a beating?
---
Having no idea where on the WC3 reforged timeline we are sitting right now, i am hoping we get it before classic just so i can play through it in the lead up
---

---
Same here. Thought it’d be a reason to play human over gnome for casters. I guess gnomes are still the tier 1 choice in that regard but the rep bonus for humans is another thing to consider. Less rep grind = more time to actually have fun. 
---
Isn't Paladin r10 better than both T1 and T2? Assuming a 21/0/30 spec.
---
OP seems to think we're getting the Reinforcements version of AV.
---
I know its not nice to laugh at the mentally challenged... but.. yikes. 
---
You can sell battle pets on the AH? Jesus
---
It's true they are quite pretty. I honestly find them all really nice, but especially liked the tropical jungle, the swamp, and the alliance main zone (tiragarde sound)
---
Followed. You make very thought out and interesting work so you’re definitely worthy. But yeah I know what you mean bro I work full time and try to balance a lot outside of work aswell. Only so many hours in a day!
---
I think it is fairly easy to raid in Vanilla. Most of the bosses have like one mechanic. The difficulty is getting the 40 man together. I think the fun is getting validation that all your hard work levelling and gearing up was for something. Dunno? 
---
Most changes possible
---
Working together with 39 other people that you enjoy playing with to progress through each raid is unlike any other experience in gaming or in life. It is by far my favorite video game-related activity and simply one of my favorite things to do in general. 
---
Improving your own play and seeing everyone else improve individually and synergistically is just awesome to be part of.
---
Realistically it will discourage everyone from world PVP because even if you only dabble in bgs and technically it isn't a big deal, it's still a punishment that kinda sours the experience. DHKS were a huge mistake. I want old AV and no DHKS. Doubt that's going to happen though.
---
Did somebody say?
---
The fun is paying through the vanilla content. The fun is leveling to 60, getting the attunements, and raiding with your friends and guildes. The fun is experiencing WoW how it was meant to be, before the masses started demanding that Bizz chip away at it until it was “accessible to all”
---
Exactly! I'm struggling rn to keep myself from touching any pservers:(
---
I think there are plenty of people who do world pvp because they want to wreck shit, not because they are grinding out honor
---
I remember doing some quest where the ghost of a Murloc (?) wanted me to help free some other murlocs (?)
---
I felt bad for him and I forced myself to finish the quest line even though I didn't have to.
---
The thing is this seems accessible in a different way. In terms of the time it took to grind? No. But the actual content seems even easier than retail as it's simplistic. Say what you will about retail, but there isn't (to my knowledge) any class that LITERALLY (no exaggeration) only presses a single button throughout a raid.
---
I can see that being good. The first time you clear a dungeon. But when you have it on farm and are doing the motions? Eh...
---
I really wish the itemisation was better and the bosses more complex. And the class playstyle more involved. And before anyone says go to retail, well, obviously retail has a shitload of issues that are even worse.
---
yeah, that may be true to retail, but classic is a time capsule of when Blizz first created WoW. So those "refinements" that made every class viable werent implimented or even thought of yet, so vanilla had a uniqueness to it that is unmatched in other versions of WoW
---
I'd like a remaster. I know the difference in quality from then to now is super minor, but today's cinematics from Blizzard are very very good.  
---
In addition, I wouldn't mind seeing an alternative cinematic that shows roles we didn't see before.  
---
Here's what we saw in vanilla's:  
---
* Dwarf hunter, male
---
* Night elf druid, female
---
* Undead warlock, male
---
* Tauren shaman, male
---
* Orc warrior, male
---
* Human mage, male
---
Maybe we could see some others that we didn't see before. Gnome and troll would be nice to see in there since they don't often get cinematic exposure since they weren't originally planned to be in the game.  
---
I'd like to see:  
---
* Dwarf paladin, male  
---
* Night elf hunter, male  
---
* Undead priest, female  
---
* Tauren warrior, male  
---
* Troll mage, male 
---
* Gnome, rogue, female 
---
Trutling until you summon yo Icelord and Cavalry bitch! Then it's a train ploughing through a herd of cows. 
---
You forgot to mention the most important part though! DHK’s were not in the game until patch 1.5 or something iirc. 
---
So this means that BOTH having DHK’s or not having them in Classic is optional! 
---
Looks so much like Prescott, AZ
---
Warlock
---
&gt;Where is the fun in vanilla raiding?
---
The raiding part.
---
Wasn't Crusader strike in TBC Beta really OP broken?
---
Agreed, just give us the TBC pre-patch and let the rage ensue lol.
---
I mean technically it’s still Vanilla, right?
---
You’re never going to be top 10 dps as ret... literally ever. You won’t even be top 10 in ZG.
---
Wotf so you dont resist my stuns, thanks!
---
Hardiness hands down, especially for rogues when trinkets do become available. Undead would have an advantage until they become available but even then I still think Orc is just better overall. 
---
Non-serious guilds do exist, so you will have a chance, OP
---
Hardiness, or Tauren with appropriate-sized Kodo. 
---
The choice concerning my future shaman haunts me daily. 
---
It's so obnoxious though. It's the only class where you can only do 1 BG, *then* you have to go back to farming. It's not always practical to be killing other players with Drain Soul. It would mean so much to be able to bag 400+ shards at a time so you can actually rep up a certain BG without needing to take these breaks in between each one. 
---
&gt; DHK’s were not in the game until patch 1.5 or something iirc.
---
So what you're telling me is that DHKs were in 70% or so of Vanilla. In other words, the vast majority of people who played Vanilla will remember DHKs as the most authentic form of Vanilla.
---
Mankrik, but everyone read it like Mankirk.
---
Have you ever considered people might like different things to you?
---
My druid wants Mangle!
---
Rogue and priest would be interesting to see what they'd come up with ^_^
---
Maybe a couple of 1v1's
---
5 man vs a dungeon pull/or a well known boss that ties into the lore
---
And fishing ofc 
---
Your complaints are valid. What made raiding fun was the social aspect. Yes, everything sucked, but it sucked with 39 other people.
---
That’s why people encouraged and congratulated each other when gear dropped. Everyone shared in the accomplishment of one Hunter getting his bow upgrade.
---
Giving every player loot (and rerolls) and making grouping easier is what contributed to the downfall of socialization in WoW. 
---
**TLDR:** a lot of good came from the bad.
---
You waste so much time traveling early and doing professions. I know priests are a good bit slower than mages around the same levels, but your level 12 speed is almost double the time from what I did for my Forsaken Mage run, it starts showing at level 20 pretty badly.
---
Tried a gnome mage run as well and it was 1 hour faster to 6 than your Dwarf. I would recommend not doing the early travel and doing the Dwarf zones first before heading to Westfal ;&gt;
---
In the time you got your wand, you could've gained an edge on others and possibly got a drop/buy it from another player by slightly overpaying if needed without time loss. It's your choice in how to play, but it eats in your time badly.
---
Priests are more desirable than Druids. Druids are one of the least played classes and are usually in demand. Night Elves make for great tanks since they have 1% dodge and nature resistance. The only class I'd think twice about rolling as a Night Elf is priest since the more hardcore may or may not discriminate against elf priests
---
Some of us are masochists, ok? Might as well ask where's the fun in no flying mounts? Or where's the fun in not having TBC/wotlk spec viability? etc etc
---
[https://www.wowhead.com/quest=5149/pamelas-doll](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=5149/pamelas-doll) was sad.
---
&gt; What do y'all see in it that I don't?
---
Good times with our friends?
---
I would often do a few levels this way just from PvPing.
---
you will this time around 
---
Yes. But I’d say it does not matter how long it was in Vanilla or not. ANYTHING that was in the lifespan of Vanilla should be up for discussion imo. 
---
Cannibalize/life tap?
---
You may not personally upgrade every raid, but your guild does. I would get genuinely excited when my friend finally got a drop he had been waiting for. That's part of the community aspect classic fostered.  MC is easy and can get repetitive, but the whole time you're farming it your really just having a good time with friends you'll have for years.  
---
I played mage and yes, it's 80% one button. But there is still enough room to get creative and push dps (if that's your goal). You'll see dps meters of two mages in comparable gear consistently doing different dps, it just takes a little more to stand out. 
---
Later on in aq and naxx a lot more mechanics are introduced and are a challenge. Most people didn't raid those so a lot of the "vanilla is too easy" voices didn't get past c'thun. There are interesting fights to be found. Also mc gear for the most part isn't great but there are a few exceptions and will be used forever. Almost all bis gear is from aq or naxx.
---
But in general, having 40 people with you is both the challenge and the reward. 
---
Rainbow Generator from Felwood. It made a rainbow that terrified imps. I presume it was in vanilla, but Blizzard have messed around with it a lot.
---
I am hoping for this date as well, although I think am going to play the 1st 2 days and then skip it for 2 weeks till the masses have settled and the craziness is gone. I don't know how laggy its going to be etc.
---
No, it’s overrated. BS trinket, warriors, and some class trinkets break fear. Stun resist WILL win you fights single-handedly.
---
That photoshop quality do. Almost had me fooled.
---
My favorite area in wow for so many reasons, and this is one of them
---
DID somebody actually say????
---
Are there any other aspects of Vanilla that are pre-1.12 that are being included in Vanilla? A huge battle with AV has just been lost.
---
That's the kind of political greed I really dislike in mmos. Whilst I can see both sides of the loot debate. He might have expected to be using it for months and got lucky. But it sure sucks.
---
Fuck sharding! That system is probably the biggest reason I quit WoW.
---
Solid strategy cotton
---
so. kind of a long one for me. 
---
My girlfriend got me into WoW. She secretly played it, and when i found it on her laptop one day she explained it to me, i got hooked, and the rest was history. My GF moved from her state to my state to get away from a drug addiction. She had been through rehab, and was a new person. I loved her with eveything in me. when she was around, it felt like i had found the perfect glove to my hand.
---
well, not all stories have a happy ending. She started acting weird about 18 months after she moved in with me. I set up a trap. i would go to work one day, like i normally do, but instead of driving to work i would turn around and come back into our apartment and check on her. Sure as shit when i walked into our bedroom she was injecting something inro her arm (i can only assume its heroin as thats what she went to rehab for). She begged me to get over it, to forget it, that it wasnt a problem.
---
I called her family, i urged her to get help, to go back to a treatment facility. She agreed at first, but then pushed me away. then she started doing things to intentionally hurt me, im assuming to try and push me even further away. She tried to sleep with my best friends, she started going out to the bars every night, she was in ful rebellion. I sought a specialist and they gave me advice to either support her, or to break it off due to the damage it was causing me in my professional life... i chose to break it off.
---
well, she started dating someone else, and i thought that she had recovered. maybe it was jsut me hoping, but i realling thought she was getting better. i didnt care that she was with some other dick head. i just wanted her to be healthy. i always assumed we would end up together again.
---
that didnt happen. i was awoken one day to her sister calling me hysterically. she had OD'ed in a hotel room with her new boyfriend and someone else on fentanil. i guess its some sort of patch of opiods but like a million times stronger than heroin.  i was crushed for many years, but i got over it, and now i have a lovely fiance who plays video games with me and cant wait to play classic wow with me. I know Amanda "Molls to the Wall" will never come back and play classic with me, but at least shes at peace, and so am I.
---
Even if you could find a guild that would happily take you as ret, its not even a fun spec to play. You have very few buttons to press and most of the time you just auto attack. 
---
Same here. Only I do it to make sure I don't step in shit and shit.
---
Playing through this again right now!
---
Remember that classes aren’t quite as strict or “rigid” as they became in later expansions. Some guilds also will want to play their hybrids as hybrids, meaning you’ll do multiple roles as needed during raids.
---
You can spec 20/0/31 and carry ret and holy gear into a raid. You can be an extra DPS to speed through trash and a healer for boss fights. For bosses with easy mechanics (where extra heals aren’t required), you can contribute DPS to help end the fight faster.
---
You will struggle to get into a “world/server first” minmax top guild, but there will be 100 other guilds that’ll give you a spot no problem.
---
If your first choice is pally, then play pally. Don’t level a mage for 60 levels just because you think someone will want you more later. There’s always a spot for you somewhere, even if it’s the best pocket healer in PVP.
---
You are talking out of your rear... Sharding will absolutely not be needed. They are rolling out a conservative amount of servers at launch in order to guage initial population level and decide whether or not they need to create additional servers. They are doing this in order to avoid stretching the base too thin. Sharding was only necessary in retail because the populations on many servers dwindled to almost nothing.
---
Sharding ruined WoW, or at least it was the greatest detriment in my eyes. It was the death blow to the community and social interaction as a whole. It makes the game feel ungrounded and kills immersion. It also eliminates the growth of unique culture and camaraderie within specific realms. 
---
If Blizzard introduces sharing into Classic, then I will refuse to play the game because it is just that silly and counter-productive to me.
---
Yup, first computer game I ever played. Great times.
---
This guy is the reason me and my friends played Stormreaver! Except we played horde, and camped &amp; farmed Hobbs every chance we got ☺️
---
I mean, they are literally just "turning back time" so I don't think we even should expect something new. But remastering [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVSJ0AvZe0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVSJ0AvZe0) into their modern day quality cinematic trailers would be freaking crazy.
---
Some people like knowing they will perform well in a setting where they don't need to pay full attention to what's going on. I like to raid as a way to chill and have a good time, not to be super competitive and to do a million inputs. Knowing there are classes that allow you to just spam one ability and still perform as well as you could is a godsend for some. That's the only reason that is making me even consider paladin as a healer, becaus endgame is pretty chill and safe.
---
I never thought old AV was boring. Then again I never played to "win" it. I played it to have awesome large scale battles!
---
2 weeks after new ffxiv expac
---
interesting.
---
Have you ever considered that I'm asking what people find fun about it and instead have only gotten worthless replies like yours?
---
Maybe a very light trailer consisting of just gameplay, like the famous prvate server's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yStjVurkNvs
---
Sharding can burn in the flames of Ragnaros. I will do everything in my power to ensure Classic WoW does not "feature" sharding. It is counter-productive to the social aspect that Vanilla is renowned for.
---
MC in a casual guild before they need to organise themselves for rag? sure
---
ZG? Sure it can work
---
in a guild that breaks on razor or lose the dps race vs vael in bwl, doubtfully
---
in aq40 or naxx when even melee hunters out dps rets? ''look how adorable it tries to deal damage'' ... I meant nope
---
It's just a really good example to showcase how old AV played out for those who didn't see it themselves.
---
Oh you want to level in that Zone?
---
Too bad your quest giver is lvl 14 and kid X Y is bored and kills him/her instantly when he/she spawns
---
Oh you lose out on the honnor grind for being a d-ck? how could they ever implement something like that. It's soooooo frustratig
---
end of sarcasm
---
DHK served a purpose and considering that we will most likely start without any or only bite sized BG releases this system will serve its purpose well.
---
No flying mounts I can understand as it sort of ruins world PVP and stuff with those. Spec viability though, yeah that's another thing I think is objectively bad.
---
So these runs are based on Starting zones being full. Assuming no Sharding. If there is sharding, it can still be competitive tagging mobs and doing certains quests line. So my runs are based on Exploration, picking up Westfall, Redridge, Darkshire, SW, IF Flight paths. 
---
Now question is - during a fresh launch, will your gnome mage at lvl 6, 7 or 8 have a lesser wand? Cause I will at level 7.
---
At level 10 - I skip picking up my spells and level 10 priest quest, I do this at level 12 because a quest requires me to go to IF. Since I am there, I take the tram to SW for my priest quest, pick up my spells, buy/trade-in for a Greater Wand and hearth back to Loch.  
---
&gt; If you don't like grinds you might be better off sticking with modern WoW.
---
I love grinding, because I can start and stop when I want and plan my routes, spots and the materials I want to farm. I'am actually a huge proponent of grinding over questing while leveling as well because it is more self-directed.
---
Raiding is something entirely different. It kind of is a grind but also forseeable.
---
But *not* in PvP. I play PvP to test my skills and to have a fast paced and dynamic match. There is already very little PvP content as is. Also I don't want to be locked into a match that may last for a day. A PvP match should have a start and a finish and an end. Old AV didn't have that. It was just a whole mess that had little to do with "coordinated" or tactical PvP.
---
&gt; You're right that the meta is up to the players to an extent, but meta always shifts BASED ON game play/balance changes.
---
Not really. There are different groups and different types of people who prefer one approach over the other. Some AVs are over in under one hour, some last for up to three and more hours. People who are mostly raiding and are PvE centric will likely rush the other side and try to kill the general fast. Experienced PvPers are more dynamic and have different approaches, usually they love to fight and just a few of them can stall entire groups for a long time, will stagger their respawns, cap in the right places and so on.
---
&gt; Zerging to single heal/tank a general with his four buddies with an optional speed bump at the enemy captain simply wasn't possible in the earlier iterations of AV.
---
So what you are saying is that we have more options in with the newer version? Sounds good to me. By the way a rush like that can be stalled or stopped and the resulting stagger kills give you a huge advantage. People play differently now than they did 12 years ago: 
---
There are players who will singlehandedly pull entire groups apart and slow them down. Others will do tripple charges into your backline, fear everyone away and crit your "single heal" down in seconds. Rogues, druids and anyone who can afford stacks of invisibility potions will be ready to collect respawns. And there are players who turtle the crap out of AV because they won't accept defeat and wait for the right moment to turn it around.
---
Oh by the way the amount of consumables used in PvP has drastically increased over retail vanilla across the board. People don't invest that much into PvP to get their asses kicked by simple strats that have obvious weaknesses. That doesn't include everyone obviously, which is why this is still a common occurence. But not nearly as much as you make it out to be.
---
&gt; Zerging to single heal/tank a general with his four buddies with an optional speed bump at the enemy captain simply wasn't possible in the earlier iterations of AV. When you remove the modern rush &gt; collect token &gt; and requeue honor farm you have very different gameplay. You get a version of Alterac Valley where the team has to work together to hold or knock down enemy towers and grave yards which is the very definition of coordination.
---
That is the case with new AV though. You are just citing a single simplified strat w/o mentioning the obvious counter plays, GY controls etc. which might stem from lack of experience or dishonesty. I give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume you don't like PvP that much.
---
IIRC, nah, ret DPS was still a bit anemic till wrath.
---
Only real Horde advantage is leveling speed, due to Zeppelins mainly. Also Horde has better access to dungeons such as SM.
---
Alliance have far more advantages when it comes to end-game.
---
I get the slippery slope idea but I feel like developers would know the difference between gameplay changes and visuals 
---
Are you going to play on the official classic servers? Would you roll mage again despite the one button thing? The social aspect does sound fun but it's a real shame about the poor itemisation (I'll find it hard to look forward to getting loot when it won't even be an upgrade) and simple mechanics. But maybe naxx and aq will make up for it if I stick it out.
---
High milk yield on female Tauren. Don't try to milk a male Tauren though.
---
aside from things that break fear, WotF helps you against classes that warlocks don't need extra help against (priests, warlocks mainly -- int. shout is too situational).
---
hardiness helps warlocks against their *primary counters*: rogues and warriors.
---
it's an easy decision.
---
the only difficult decision is: do you really want to give up cannibalize, the ultimate tea-bag?
---
Sorry - only doing dwarf priest because this is what I am rolling :D
---
For the most part, what you describe is Burning Crusade.
---
And WoW is an MMO, vast majority of your time is "going through the motions".
---
Are you suggesting the interlaced cowl looks anything other than amazing?  
---
#NoExtremes
---
Step back. Draw some lines. Make an argument.
---
This line you're at has no true bearing. What's your suggestion for pop caps? Overcrowding? Unplayable starting zones?
---
Sharding will need to be present for the game to offer the most Vanilla-like experience at launch.
---
Assuming that:
---
1) Server merges are more disruptive to in-game economies and communities than sharding,  
---
2) ~3k is the ideal server population, and  
---
3) Approximately 70% of players will quit after a month or two
---
We will need to launch with 11-12k players per server in order to avoid eventual merges and not be plagued by a bunch of 500-pop servers after a couple months.  But 11k launches are not what Vanilla was, and a sharded world for the first ~10 hours of play during launch week is not going to have lasting effects on the server community in the long run.
---
If you can think of a better way to avoid eventual server merges, I believe that many of us are all ears.  Obviously in a perfect world we wouldn't need to do it this way, but there's simply no way to organically recreate the launch of this game exactly as it was in 2004.  There is too much interest.
---
That's what open PvP is for though. Organize a city raid event and announce it on the realm forums. There you'll have an epic large scale battle with no obvious win conditions or even ending.
---
People love that kind of stuff and I bet you will find tons of players who will participate on classic release.
---
Almost certainly. Mage is the only other class that could hope to do that, and while I could find videos of people being able to clear SM Cath in one pull on a mage at 70 with TBC talents/spells it was a hell of a job. I would be extremely impressed if anyone could do it at 60 even with Naxx gear and it's probably impossible.
---
Oh, it’s this topic again.....
---
If they do what they say and only implement it in the beginning zones of the launch phase, then I’m personally ok with it it, even if I disagree with sharding in general.
---
I think the majority of us feel this way, and the problem is the amount of trust we have in Blizzard these days is pretty low.
---
Yes.  I played with a friend during vanilla, tbc, wrath, and cata.  Without making this too long, we would play together all the time and mainly focused on pvp.  Our goal was to get gladiator one day queing every single day after school.  He joined the military and I was left playing alone.  Since then I talked to him one or two times and I haven’t heard from him ever again.  I know this sounds dumb because I’m sure they are still alive but after having a real friendship after that many years it does feel really bad.  When I was getting really good at arena I was a hunter and I named my pet after him and I ended up getting glad in the last season of mists and the first in wod. 
---
I took my character to gnomergan where we met and I logged off forever.  I still miss him 
---
Make sure to not hype them up so much the games will never live up to it.
---
Fury warrior with hacked trolls blood potion
---
You like PvP, so you want AV made into a PvE experience? Got it.
---
I’m against sharding but let’s be completely honest, “grouping and making friends” on most private servers is an invite followed by no communication until group members start to leave when they complete their quest. Maybe they say bye. 
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Atleast humans get that 5% spirit tho, and don't look ridiculous lol. The big thing for me is that even with the coolest possible armor... i just cant take em seriously.
---
For a game all about the loot, its too much to overlook for me.
---
And then you found out that with EVEN MORE EXCESSIVE clicking you could blow up the critters and suddenly nothing else was quite as cool ever again.
---
I have often thought about some of my old Cause of Death guidlies on Ner'zhul.  I wonder what they are up to, how their lives have gone, things like that. 
---
My class leader was a few years older and in his mid to late twenties.  A very well spoken person, that was enjoyed and loved in our guild and across the server.  He had a genetic condition, which he admitted on a few occasions he would be extremely lucky to make it to his mid thirties. When the guild began breaking towards the end of Vanilla I began seeing him less and less, till one day neither of us were playing enough to see each other.  I wish I had gotten a more permanent contact method, but a 20 year old me didn't quite think like that.  
---
He has influenced me to great effect, despite it being over 12 years since I've talked to him.  I know he had lots of real life friends and family, but always felt bad that I wasn't able to be in contact with him towards the end.  
---
I can't afford to make generic  top 10 videos if i ever want to take off, thats for sure lol. 
---
I don't even know what your point is. You're speaking nonsense. 
---
Sure, but conversation is a two way street. You gotta be willing to talk to them too :P
---
I stop questing after I get shoulders. That’s when you beat the game IMO
---
I didn't level horde until WOD and really wanted to try it but my wife and rl friends wont play horde. So I'm rolling retadin instead of my normal warrior and trying it that way for a new experience.
---
If you really try and see the story from Cerellean's pov you can feel his heart being sundered in two. Truly heartbreaking. Especially the rp chat  boxes right after you complete the quest. Make sure to read that.
---
The quest to save Crusader Bridenbrad from the plague of undeath was also memorable.
---
Once I got bored of playing dota 2 just to be personally skilled at heroes and mechanics I found fun and even more reward in a plan coming together between multiple players. Especially in a game where if everyone is on the same level you can sometimes coordinate complex strategies with very little speaking. That is rewarding to me, I didn't get to experience very many progression raids, that's the majority of my raiding but it didn't last long enough before TBC came out. I am looking forward to setting goals for 40+ people and seeing it develop over a long period of time and eventually be accomplished.
---
Also rolling with MAH NAGAS through the world and being a badass posse that dispenses vigilante justice will be awesome.
---
Y’know I nearly forgot that! All those poor sheep...
---
I don't think he said he wants to be a warlock, but you pointed out something that too often goes unnoticed. Cannibalize is BiS teabag especially if they release immediately after you use it.
---
The entire point of opinion polls is the create a consensus around subjectivity 
---
Seems a bit fast. Real vanilla took 2 years 2 months originally and felt rushed at the end on naxx. It would be easy to stretch it to 3 years before all content was out and go from there. Especially if they have a classic TBC in the works.
---
Put another way: For any video game, old stuff was designed for the tech at the time.  This often meant actually taking advantage of how it made things look, even if that meant lower quality compared to later.  So yeah, in the context of WoW, it makes sense that when newer and better tech came that made things more defined and higher quality, it removed the softness "tricks" that were used back then.  Better hardware on the user's side can also possibly affect the rendering of old stuff.
---
It’s a game that rewards you for the effort and I’ll enjoy it for that far more than the nostalgia. 
---
Usually people don’t have solutions to the problem, they just don’t like Blizz’s solution.
---
Really 45%? Is that all them added together or with a formula?
---
Hunters are boring that way. New traps, new tracking skills, better rank of Mongoose, Raptor Strike and Wing Clip. So worthless.
---
I also thought the reason we want Vanilla back is a big chunk of nostalgia back when the wall of no was the usual response, until I played on Nost. I started leveling and finally remembered why I loved WoW in the first place. I realized it was just a great game that had its coregameplay watered down with every further major iteration.
---
I've never cringed so hard in my life.  
---
I had an actual physical response in my stomach to the cringe.  
---
It just seems like a super passive aggressive question. Why do you like jazz music? Why do you like chocolate? What’s fun about playing football? These aren’t useful questions. If you don’t like it that’s fine but other people don’t need to explain their preferences.
---
What? How? Even the most basic addons in vanilla were a fucking pain to set up most of the time. ElvUI has a supremely user friendly configuration menu.
---
Actually half a year ago, one of my old guildmates found me on Facebook and asked me to join a discord server that they made. Turns out they were able to reach out to close to 50 core guildmates and we've all caught up on life stories etc. and most are interested in the new Classic WoW. It was amazing to talk to the OG vanilla guys and gals I played so many years with and lost contact.
---
I don't want AV to be "made into" anything. The AV as played in 1.12 is perfectly fine for me because it is more fast paced, more tactical and more PvP oriented.
---
At this point I actually wish Blizzard will bring back the broken versions of AV just to showcase how bad it was. I mean depending on the perspective it may have felt "epic" to some, but there was defintiely no such thing as "coordinated" PvP in there. It was just a massive zergfest with people entering and leaving. Would be kind of funny to see how people react.
---
i am excited for the game, not the "nostalgia" as that time in my life, although awesome that i discovered WoW, was pretty aweful. So i get to appreciate the game for the game, no rose colored glasses here. 
---
Simple. Create additional servers as needed.
---
If sharding is only present at launch, then I am OK with that. But adding a permanent feature that encourages anti-social behavior (no trading, no shared guilds, meeting people you'll never see again) and breaks immersion (random people and mobs appearing/disappearing, realm names attached to player names) simply to put a bandaid on a temporary issue is not a good plan.
---
Two words. Poop Sock.
---
Not even remotely close. pfUI is trash compared to ElvUI.
---
eatin corndogs, blastin happy hardcore for 18 hours/day, and beatin it to hentai
---

---
Worst case-scenario he gets a day off?
---
I thought the Engineer goggles where the first head piece lvl 1
---
I’m in full support of sharding at launch for the starting zones, with a rather limited server amount.
---
I think it’s a really smart move to do it this way, because like you mentioned, they’ll have a gigantic amount of interest at launch, and I want rather full severs *after* people figure out they don’t like it.
---
The old Thottbot comments on Wowhead back up this claim
---
 
---
&gt;From ThottbotBy Ryimae [on 2005/12/25](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13937/headmasters-charge#comments:id=2710509) (Patch 1.8.4)Subject: "Yes and Yes" Yes, it does stack with Arcane Intellect, and yes I've seen it - I have it :) 
---
It worked just fine in Vanilla until the eventual decline prior to TBC. The issue forms when too many realms are created and then their respective populations eventually die out. It is my understanding that Blizzard is launching Classic with a conservative amount of servers with the plan to expand when needed in order to prevent stretching populations too thin.
---
If the problem is inevitable and becomes severe, then simply merge servers if/when needed as they did in retail. There is no need to do so right off the bat. I think we should enjoy the Classic experience at least while we can.
---
I am, and I would. I'm undecided if I will main mage or something else this time, but I've played most classes at 60 in vanilla. The main thing I didn't like about mage raiding is that in most fights the outcome isn't dependant on your performance like a main tank or the primary healer. If shit went sideways I was mostly helpless. But it's a lot of fun in PvP and has great quality of life utility. 
---
Mc is probably 90% frostbolt, bwl 65% frostbolt. But you can throw in CoC, fireblast, aoe now and again to push yourself, engineering adds some flavor too. Positioning may be simple compared to retail but it's important and how you do it matters on more fights than you'd expect.  I enjoy pushing myself to do better each raid and have friendly rivalries with other dps.  After that I really enjoy fire mage and ignite mechanics. 
---
I'm not clear on your concern about getting loot that's not an upgrade though. If it's not an upgrade they won't give it to you, they'll disenchant it for Nexus crystals. MC for mage, sure a lot of t1 isn't helpful and some 5 man or pvp gear will be better. But there is gear there that is better than anything else available at the time. Mana cord is bis waist till c'thun. The neck from rag and mageblade till nefarian or deep into AQ. Bwl has shoulder head and trinket that are bis until naxx or forever. 
---
You for sure won't upgrade your whole set every tier, but that is a good thing when you consider that you do only get a handful of drops off every boss. On average I'd say I got an upgrade about every 5 resets. Which meant there was always a reason for me to be in the raid because about the time when I was running out of upgrade paths the next tier was around the corner. 
---
Mc will be boring just looking at the pve aspect if you're coming from retail but it's the start of the journey and I still like running it. I'll even join mc pugs after I'm done with naxx just for shits and giggles. 
---
I wouldn't have a problem with that as long as it truly only existed in starting areas. I hate sharding with a passion (in case you couldn't tell) and I think its drawbacks are not worth the potential benefits.
---
That WotLK transmog though
---
I just want the Warcraft world back
---
I would be on board for that if it is intended to only be a temporary measure to be later removed once overcrowding in starting zones is no longer an issue.
---
psht you think a casual like me goes anywhere near engineering?
---
Have you been practicing how to pronounce WoW? 
---
at the start of 1.0 patch rouges could keep keep you sapped for over 15min+, lets bring that back also.
---
&gt; then simply merge servers if/when needed as they did in retail. 
---
You're saying this as if it's "just that easy."  As if merging servers isn't 100x more destructive to the in-game economy and communities than simply playing on a shard until level 5-10.  Characters will lose their names and need to pick new ones.  Guilds will be torn apart and merged and smashed every which way.  Servers will stagnate as people realize they are only one of a few hundred people at 60.  Economies will be thrown into flux.  This is so, ***so*** much worse than sacrificing community for a few hours at launch.
---
Planning on merging servers is basically the same thing as playing on a 2-month long shard that lasts from level 1-60.
---
False, moonkin dance is the ultimate tbag.
---
Loch Modan (pre-cata) has always been my favorite zone! Nice write up, thanks for sharing. 
---
Vanilla and Wrath were the peaks of my WoW career 
---
The nostalgic kick will be nice, but more than anything, I'm looking forward to a nice, long, relaxing game to play.  I love kicking back with a beer (or three) and just mindlessly grinding out quests or farming gold.  It never gets old to me.
---
good old times...
---

This guy casuals

Who was first? Me or you? The world may never know
---
Mana pots had a 2 min CD but didn’t lock you out for being in combat. So you could use as many as you wanted. 
---
Lots of other consumables were around at some point. Buffs, 5 sec rule, etc.
---
Id day you won’t have to worry until AQ/Naxx, but you should have figured out some of the nuances by then.
---

---
Lost my brother shortly after TBC, will be using his character name and class in honor of him.
---
Regardless of disagreement I appreciate the thorough response.
---
&gt; I love grinding... 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ...But not in PvP. I play PvP to test my skills and to have a fast paced and dynamic match. There is already very little PvP content as is. Also I don't want to be locked into a match that may last for a day. A PvP match should have a start and a finish. Old AV didn't have that. It was just a whole mess that had little to do with "coordinated" or tactical PvP.
---
Every time you use the word "but" in this manner you might as well erase everything before it. AV always had a start and finish, that's not really up for debate. If you really want a fast match there are other BGs as well as even quicker versions of AV with limited resources and so on.
---
&gt; There are different groups and different types of people who prefer one approach... experienced PvPers are more dynamic and have different approaches, usually they love to fight and just a few of them can stall entire groups for a long time, will stagger their respawns, cap in the right places and so on.
---
No disagreement here. This bit is self-evident.
---
&gt; So what you are saying is that we have more options in with the newer version? Sounds good to me. By the way a rush like that can be stalled or stopped and the resulting stagger kills give you a huge advantage. People play differently now than they did 12 years ago:
---
&gt; ...
---
&gt; Oh by the way the amount of consumables used in PvP has drastically increased over retail vanilla across the board. People don't invest that much into PvP to get their asses kicked by simple strats that have obvious weaknesses. That doesn't include everyone obviously, which is why this is still a common occurence. But not nearly as much as you make it out to be.
---
I acknowledge the meta has changed, but that doesn't mean the number of options are greater. The amount of consumables used is most likely a reflection of how their sourcing and availability has changed, rather than any other factor. Some post vanilla expansions you could get potions through PvPing, a black lotus like barrier doesn't exist to modern flasks, etc.
---
&gt; That is the case with new AV though. You are just citing a single simplified strat w/o mentioning the obvious counter plays, GY controls etc. which might stem from lack of experience or dishonesty. I give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume you don't like PvP that much.
---
For all you know there's a chance you're actually the one with lesser experience, but to avoid a dick measuring contest, let's assume we're equally skilled/experienced for the sake of argument. There was no dishonesty intended though, but rather an attempt to keep things simple as I've yet to see another r/Classicwow thread go this deep or be involved. It's a welcome change though.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
On to the greater point, 1.11(1.12 didn't have any AV changes) marked a patch where the pendulum swing so far in favor of quicker AV games it wasn't meaningfully changed again for a year and a half. It also represents a state that the battleground existed in for the minority of it's time between introduction and the TBC pre-patch. [Source](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Alterac_Valley) Lastly, the changes to the final vanilla version of AV are emblematic of the streamlined trend the game took that lead us to want Classic in the first place. Is it truly worth optimizing your honor farm to sacrifice that here?
---
getting your first real head piece is actually such a great feeling for me every time, idk why but it feels like such a big milestone when leveling to me.
---
Nah, the game is just that good. You won’t need your nostalgia. Trust me boi
---
Blizzard also added flying mounts in tbc. Is every decision they made in TBC a good one?
---
Yes it is confirmed watch the blizzcon video.
---
At the end of the day we’re talking about a video game (a gear one at that).  I’m excited to play with some old pals, but I don’t expect to time warp into 2005 upon logging in.  
---
I just find the vanilla version to be the best MMO out there, and I’m excited to play a great mmo again. 
---
Vanilla had better gameplay/formula and BfA has good graphics, why not combine the two? Either shitty gameplay with bad graphics or maybe better yet... the gameplay of vanilla with graphics of BfA... Yes! 
---
Paid for by players for allowing current graphics on classic( optionally).
---
Well, having phases at all means that it isn't purely 1.12. If they add DHK in a phase that coincides with patch 1.5 then that would be the most "vanilla" thing to do.
---
We are talking years from now... Regardless, sharding won't stop realms from dying out. And sharding certainly won't help the economy of those low pop realms if you have only a handful of people to actually trade with (can't trade with sharded players).
---
Do you have another solution that you could suggest, or do you think sharding is the only suitable solution?
---
Yeah. Hunters are boring AF while leveling but so much fun in raids because of their rotation. At least they level fast in comparison to other classes.
---
BRO! this is what I needed! 
---
Witch hunting is against the blizzard form rules as well as this subreddit. You will get banned for trying to post evidence of ninjas before their name gets seen.
---
I met a friend online. Raided with for years. He fainted and was rushed to hospital shortly after we started raiding only to find out he had a weak heart. He ended up having a pump installed. We called him iron man jokingly because some times his vest / battery would start beeping and he would have to plug in before his mechanical heart stopped. He went through two transplants. Neither took. He would still pop online occasionally as his condition worsened but eventually felt too shitty to play at length. At that point we had become friends on Facebook and that is how I found out he had finally passed after a long fight. 
---
It's not years from now... it is going to take a month or two, tops.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/blizzard-70-percent-of-new-wow-players-dont-get-past-level-10_1
---
&gt; Blizzard has revealed that only 30 per cent of new World of Warcraft players make it past level 10.  That's the tipping point at which people either stay or go, which make's the game's 11.5 million subscriber base all the more impressive.
---
If 70% of people stop at or before level 10, then servers are going to need to launch supporting around 11k people to hit that ~3k sweet spot at 60.
---
One thing I am pretty sure of- they will always keep classic around in it's natural form. If they want to do alternative progression or go to BC then they would do so while allowing vanilla classic to keep going untouched. 
---
That's literally what's going to happen though.
---
A good guild? No.
---
Yes, but you only have to press one button to get into a raid, though.
---
Pretty sure that was added in cataclysm.
---
&gt; I would also say the negatives against enhance/ret you have applies to specs like shadow as well. 
---
Not really. Spriests bring nearly the same utility as Disc (dispel, psychic scream) and they're pretty good at burning druid FC. 
---
I thought they got to roll on it no matter how far away they were. 
---
I considered it years ago and then I started playing on private servers and it's definitely not a nostalgia trip for me. The game is simply good.
---
Not even halfway to immune..
---
I did the Forsaken zone that way during a PS launch and it took about 20 minutes longer to 12, clocked at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I didn't have a wand till one dropped (Fire wand) and just kept going. To my suprise some people were even ahead of that (14-15) but generally I had almost everything to myself once I got a bit ahead of the curve.
---
I did the run till StV was done and took a long break there since I wanted to know how much ahead I could get, so didn't do everything ahead of the curve, but it makes a big difference. Most people were in the Barrens/ST/Ash and there were around 25 people higher levelled/the same level, so everything was pretty much yours at that point.
---
I am not sure if wanding will help you that much with tagging since wanding has a travel time and iirc smite and holy fire don't. It might be easier for you to tag stuff with your melee weapon and cast till your oom and do some traveling to quest points till you have mana for 1 to 2 mobs. A wand is amazing for speed but you sacrifice so much time to get it so early :&lt;
---
Even if it is heavily contested, I personally don't think heavy exploration is worth it unless you do it extremely efficiently and can't get level 3-4 fairly early. Your times aren't bad, but the road blocks will just happen at 5-6 instead of early on and it will take longer to get out of the general populace. It's all about momentum and keeping that in the end :&gt;
---
I think for Classic it depends on how much sharding + how dynamic respawning (if at all) will be implemented. Northshire and Durotar might be the worst ones to start in due to the amount of mobs and general flow of the questing. Mob density is lower in both those zones and Human is insanely populair, same for Orc (which has Trolls as as well). Dwarf and Gnome are about as crowded as Forsaken but more crowded than NE/Tauren. 
---
Elwynn will be more crowded than Dun Morogh and is less cohesive in terms of questing. Elwynn requires a good amount of walking and a good amount of dead space in terms of xp, because Elwynn gets more efficient if you walk from point to point and the mob density near the roads is pretty low while in DunM you generally don't use the roads and can spend your mana more efficiently during your walk from point A to point B. Mana efficiency isn't super important since you regenerate a good bit of mana on lower levels, just as long as you never sit at 100% for an extended period of time.
---
Did they work? Are you a Christian now?  
---
Yep and shoulders and full length cape
---
Very good read, totally forgot about the troll cave in the middle.
---
Is the beta really considered vanilla WoW, though? How far back does "vanilla" go? Can we have the skill system that was in place before talents?
---
Hey, do some research before you make topics, theres a difference between sharding and cross realm zones.  
---
I second that. Otherwise go mage or hunter for mindless solo'ing. 
---
&gt; I would be on board for that if it is intended to only be a temporary measure to be later removed once overcrowding in starting zones is no longer an issue.
---
Cool. Cause that's the plan.
---
The animations are "overdone" the same way the animations in Warcraft III was
---
I love Tauren warriors but hardiness is just so damn good! I agonise about this more often than I should
---
I've been debating using all the info I can find on Vanilla Friends, and making a Server Discord, for anyone that wants to join.  Maybe find some friends of friends that way.
---
True. Considering that the honor system isn't even going to be in Phase 1 anyway, they would make most sense entering the game with WSG and AV, or Phase 3 at the latest.
---
You do it to hang out in voice chat/gchat with 40+ other people facerolling content and goofing off. Then you go pvping after against other guilds that just did the same thing. Then you talk shit on the forums about it and then fight them all week all over azeroth.
---
You dont do it for the content or the gear. You do it because of all the spontaneous shit that you can start with 40 other people who are invested in each other.
---
Agreed
---
Since we're getting things as they were in 1.12, I would expect them to be in the game at launch.  It makes sense for them to flight out level 60 content like DM and raids, but I don't think it's too much of a big deal for leveling content.
---
Blizzcon panel about Classic, should be on youtube. They know it's something we don't want and something they don't want to use. But for things like Launch (and I guess AQ opening) they see it as a neccecary evil.
---
And I agree. AQ opening wasn't epic for shit, because most of what I saw on my screen was "World Server Down".
---
Probably a good idea seeing how many people use the hub and how many elites there are esp in the troll area it would prolly streamline one of the areas in the lvling range where things can slow down if you dont know where to look.
---
The fact that hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed and consistently played private servers proves this isn't just a nostalgia trip, it's actually a very very enjoyable iteration of the game. 
---
I liked the video, it is honest and resonates for the most part.
---
I would personally note a few things I disagree with to give another perspective on some things though.
---
1. The showcased Hunter build uses Trueshot Aura which is skipped in favor of either getting Intimidation or Counterattack in pure PvP builds. Also Entrapment is one of the most impactful talents in the SV tree and should never be skipped. Alot of builds mistakenly suggest improved Wingclip over Entrapment but ever since I played WoW again I cannot stress enough how much of a mistake that is.
---
2. Yes, Hunters are strong against Rogues but even moreso against Warriors even if they have a significant gear disadvantage. I think that should be noted to kind of provide a perspective for the people who call the Warrior the "King's Class".
---
3. The Hunter vs Mage/Warlock/Priest thing is not entirely accurate. Hunters can't easily deal with getting feared by Warlocks and Priests as they don't get Fear removal from their Insignias, they are vulnerable to Mages exploiting the deadzone as mentioned. Hunters should be very wary of cloth wearers and always keep as much distance from them as possible and never commit/chase too hard on them.
---
4. The build that is easily the most effective is SL (demonology), to provide a ridiculous amount of survivability and skirmishing power. I don't think there is any class that is as survivable as a SL lock in PvP. They have a ridiculous amount of sustain and can brush off huge amounts of burst damage on top of that. SM/Ruin is played in PvP and "prefered by good Warlocks" because it is a doubles as a raiding build but it is definitely less powerful than SL in the open world and BGs alike and there is absolutely nothing about the spec that is "faceroll" or less nuanced compared to others. It is just quite simply more potent.
---
5. I agree with the overall Druid assessment but it must be mentioned that they have a ridiculous amount of variability in specs that can be optimal for PvP. PvP is where their true hybrid nature comes to shine. The low healing and low damage output the video mentions is simply because Druids switch back and forth from healing to dealing damage to tanking to CC, engaging/disengaging etc. So none of their healing or damage outputs will top any meters.
---
I loved the Shaman/Horde vs Paladin/Alliance part at the end. It provides a very accurate and balanced overview of the faction dynamics and the two classes.
---
My tailor assured me this napkin is a cape despite the length!
---
I’ve been doing the same thing, but in smaller chunks. Got a Tauren Warrior 1-12 three times including a green 2h hammer from a quest. My best time yet is 4h 14m. 
---
[Feline Mantle] made you feel like a balla.
---
I think that's still in the game... But it got moved into the toy menu at some point during cata (wrath?) and stopped being special.
---
I remember I used to randomly click it all the time when I had it in my bags, but when I played came back in WoD after not playing for several years don't think I even used it once.
---
Red Defias Mask ftw!
---
Well, 14 hours played is a bit much for the first day. 
---
Disagree, you would sacrifice your 2 most important slots for a measly +15 FrR.
---
Wrath as well for me. I get online during these free weekends just to go see the Shadowmourne proc effect.  
---
Then I right click Tabard of the Lightbringer.  
---
Then I log off.  
---
I don't think you're using that word correctly..
---
No changes
---
My wife played both the newer itterations and on one PS Vanilla server. Even though she is by definition very casual, (2-4 hours a week) she seems to enjoy the PS more than everything she played before (she started early cata). She enjoys her hunter and mage and on the modern servers she played balance, so I suppose the only thing she will miss is her viable big fat owlkin.
---
It's all about the pacing I think. Gear drops, dungeons, raids, pvp, levelling, everything had a certain pace to it. The current game might be more complex but it is less specialized since everyone can fill the same niches. 
---
As a casual you might enjoy taking stuff at your pace and still get rewarded for it in the long run.
---
For the more dedicated players it means you will be a powerhouse in comparison, which is a good thing imo. Just imagine doing the same job at a more efficient pace than your co-worker and them working 24 hours a week with you working close to 60, but them getting paid about as much for your month versus their 2 months, would you be satisfied?

---
Great compilation!
---
not all starting zones and races are created equal. 
---
Coldridge has to contend with dwarves and gnomes. wand travel time is still faster than Smiting and the closer im to the target the better. Also allows me to multi tag quickly when im already being hit and can safely secure the next mob as a priest. 
---
the 3 runs I posted are actually runs #4,5,6 which I wrote down the data. 2 of my runs I delayed wand until level 10 and saw a massive difference in time.

2 things - Wand DPS out paces smite+dot dramatically. I can kill faster, thus kill more things while moving to point a to point b. 
---
Nonsense, that gives you 2 hours for food and bathroom and 8 hours for sleep, ezpz. I've done longer days in the Navy, but WoW is actually fun so it will feel faster
---
dont know much about your zone, but for a warrior, matching the same time as a priest, that sounds pretty amazing.
---
Look at new thunder bluff and imagine the graphics of it in vanilla world hmm
---
keep the faith alive op
---
[theorycrafters like /u/Theloras have reason to believe that multiple ranks of Judgement stacked in vanilla](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightshope/comments/9q84am/c2c_interview_with_theloras_aka_me/), meaning ret pallies could buff each other up to +829 holy damage with six ranks of JotC (bear in mind the coefficient isn't 1 though). If this is true they could also stack other Judgements and provide insane utility to the raid by stacking them and swinging Nightfall.
---
It remains to be seen whether this will be the case in Classic, but it could (as /u/Theloras also notes) change the lolret meta.
---
Personally I think you should roll pally and see what turns up. Ret-reckoning at the very least is a fun spec for PVP. And players like /u/EsfandTV demonstrate that a tryhard pally can bring a lot to a PVE raid even among serious raiders.
---
You'll probably have to prove yourself but I don't think it's out of the question. 
---
Way back in 2004, in the free trial stress-test days, I made my first journey to Loch Modan from the snowy mountains of Ironforge. It was obvious to me why they put that ridiculously long tunnel between the two zones -- clearly this was the worst and most ham-fisted attempt at hiding a loading screen I had ever seen. As I hiked down that massive tunnel I kept waiting for that loading screen, or just a small hitch in movement, but it never happened. I actually walked back up the tunnel to make sure I didn't miss it. A few levels and zones later it dawned upon me that there were none (aside from obvious instances). That was mind-blowing to me at the time.
---
Just hearing the name WoWHobbs brings back so many memories I thought I had completely forgotten. I can literally remember his voice now even though I haven’t thought of him in a decade. 
---
Memory is weird.
---
It's shorter than your average cloak or cape but it checks out.
---
Once a Paladin gets geared it’s really tough to run out of mana, but most classes can be efficient and keep mana up if you’re willing to drink pots and runes. 
---
No reason to even think about that until beta or leaks are out. Who knows, hardiness could get a nerf like it did in TBC.
---
But it helps warriors gain weapon skill faster. 
---
Jesus that puts things into perspective. Crazy how time flies. Cata seems like only yesterday, Vanilla feels like a lifetime ago.
---
They are extremely strong duelists/skirmishers. Min-maxers choose troll for horde and dwarf for alliance because of their racial priest abilities.
---
From my experience manaburn, dispell and silence are your most important tools, so always use them over dealing raw damage. Shadowweaving is incredibly powerful because it protects magical effects from defensive dispells by stacking up.
---
I personally played shadowpriest and would recommend the spec to anyone who is starting out on Priest and wants to focus on PvP content or for people who aren't keen on grouping/premades, but for more experienced and/or group oriented players I would jump right into supporting/healing.
---
Listening to even 10 seconds of this is like taking a very powerful nostalgia drug that is to strong to resist
---
I was pretty pissed when they made it all non elites. Took the magic right out of that place. 
---
It just seems like, on this thread, you are so adamantly against sharding that you are willing to compromise for worse changes. Things that have a fundamental effect on static game aspects.
---
I would prefer to have it old school overcrowded and unadulterated, but Blizzard will not do that in 2019 when they have other options. At what point do you give up trying to find a solution that works better than sharding at launch?
---
I'll always remember my partners I got gladiator with. It's one of the only grinds in modern wow that is on par with classic 
---
1hour in and always at goldshire. ACTUAL YIKES lol do you know what goldshire will look like 1hour into the server. It will look like a retail RP server haha.
---
I played a human mage as my first 60. And while I wasn't all that great at being a mage, I put a shit load of style into my attacks.
---
Well, until you have 5/5 Spirit Tap, Warrior’s probably faster. You’ll likely outpace me pretty quickly after 20 having both Spirit Tap and Improved Wands. 
---
Hi, /u/TexAg_18

BOP / Bubble ofc

i don't like chance but hardiness does still seem crazy good

female orc for sure though i don't want to play a sloucher but hey i'm a Paladin so i cant be either =P

Please stop, it hurts.
---
No Changes means keep the gameplay as it was 2004-2006. No QoL from other expansions, no ingame shop bullshit, no class tuning.
---
Because he's from Bizarro world apparently.
---
Yeah, still think loot trading should be gone, but If they really want to keep it this is the best way.
---
Loot trading in raids will allow you to optimize gear drops a lot more, you kill boss 1 and give item to person number 1 who doesn't equip it, this person has a better upgrade on boss number 3 and won't equip the item until he kills that boss, if he gets the item he wants, he trades it to someone else, if not he equips it.
---
People do the same in my guild on retail, not extremely relevant but, yeah.
---
Awesome story! However, a pet peeve of mine. I CANT STAND.... when people say they can’t afford anything but fast food! For the cost of two weeks of fast food eating, you can easily get a month’s worth of more food from winco or any other warehouse style grocery!!! It just looks cheaper when you pay $5 for a meal vs $100 grocery bill, it’s an illusion!!! Anyhow, I never had anyone to play WoW with /: and I was an altaholic 14 year old who never made friends online kuz I always made new chars... :(
---
Bruh... ur sleeping on the almond poppyseed. Best muffin in the world when they are moist
---
That purple frost saber though 
---
IMO more blood elf related content and dungeons should've been in Eastern kingdoms and Kalimdor to make the original continents still relevant
---
As a resto Druid, I love running instances with a ret Paladin. Your blessings and resurrect are always welcome, and you’re a good innervate target if the group allows me to manage my mana.
---
I played with my three best friends and my fiancee/wife
---
I have no friends and am divorced
---
why is everything like less glowy and just bland like damn
---
It definitely does. There's a lot of weird random misinformation here.
---
huh? I am not understand you?
---
No flying, that’s the big one.
---
Do you know what Goldshire will look like when you get there 1hour in? 
---

looks like wand crafting isnt worth it. takes too much time
---
It totally will break CC. Focus on the in depth replies, there is a lot of random misinformation getting thrown around.
---
BC was a natural development on classic; I don't know how they could've made classic still relevant, short of keeping the level cap at 60 but how would raid progression work for MC through to Naxx?
---
BC, for me, added the polish that classic needed for what made a perfect MMORPG
---
Absolutely no flying ever.  EVER.  It's the most god damn OP thing ever introduced.  Even at max we should have to experience some sort of danger in a max zone, even at full gear there needs to be some aspect of danger or there is no point. 
---
that's.... not sharding.
---
Bc isn't the problem.
---
The problem wasn't even with launch WOTLK. It was with LFG. 
---
Once you remove the social aspect from the game, it's dead. 
---
Im honestly fine with this
---
They've announced that we're getting AV in 1.12 version, and they've basically announced that we'll be getting raid content in "phases" which I guess can be called patches. But yeah, I wonder if other later-patch content like added quest hubs and changes made to the world like Fishing Pools would be gated to their original patch releases or will those be already included in at launch? Would really appreciate knowing which form classic Azeroth will launch in ^_^
---
Not getting bought up by activition..
---
Indeed! *Laughs in Rogue*
---
Prescawt?
---
You can apply the same logic to flying though. Death of most of the wpvp that many people love.
---
I was quoting a common attitude you can find here on reddit. I don't think I had directed it at you personally, cheers.
---
No, yes, yes. 
---
I'm looking forward to Classic immensely and decided to try a private server yesterday, to see for myself whether or not it's just the nostalgia itching. The only difference I could feel now compared to when I played in vanilla was the sense of awe to be in Azeroth. That awe will never be the same again, but the fun? Yes, it was fun, even to just kill a random boar was fun, and to be honest I may already be addicted again, that's the power of vanilla. May it have mercy on me :P
---
i leveled alliance on a private server.
---
Dont forget nade are considered stuns evn though they do an incapacitating effect! The brad and butter of engineering resisted by an orc. :(
---
Vanilla was more about the experience and less about reward. The problem with wow now is most only play for the reward, the minute they feel a reward isnt coming they leave  
---
This is really what caster raiding was all about: mana management. Anyone could throw spells around. But experienced raiders had to learn the delicate balance of damage vs. conserving your mana pool. If you ended the fight with 100% mana, you were too careful with your casting and this resulted in less damage. If you were oom halfway through, you had the opposite problem. 
---
Players learned mana management from levels 1-59. &lt;This is why character boosts (people buying max level characters) is such a terrible idea, because they never learned how to properly play their character.&gt;
---
And this is why you should try to treat instances as practices for raids. When in an instance, try to come up with optimal rotations to learn the best way you can manage your mana. This is, in fact, unique to you. Although guides may tell you rotations for your class and spec, your gear changes the formulas and ultimately dictates how you dps/heal.
---
And of course, every fight is different. Some fights are purposely slow (pulling your punches) while waiting for an event or something like that. Others are "balls to the walls" from beginning to end so mana pots and every and all mana conservation strategies are a must the entire time. 
---
Yes, going oom was common, but only really from inexperienced/very undergeared players. Flukes could occur, an unexpected mana drain, a momentary panic where the main tank gets overhealed by all the healers, a misclick on a mana restoring ability or mana pot, but that's what inervates are primarily for (most of the time, inervates will only ever be used on healers since they really are the only thing that matters in raids). 
---
What to do about it: it's way less about gear and far more about LEARNING YOUR CLASS. If you practice beforehand and keep learning in every raid you go too (your rotation should always be getting better), then you'll be fine. 
---
Now that you say that out loud it makes total sense but I couldn't remember if maybe AE was a special case, there are tons of exceptions to almost every rule in wow after all.
---
It makes them "immune" in terms of rogues considering to open up with garrote or at all. Two BWL geared characters, one rogue, one warrior, the rogue will always play on the knife's edge. One resisted stun in the entirety of the duel can mean autohit, swordproc, mortal strike -&gt; dead.
---
Have to be close enough to get credit, whatever that distance is. I think exp/quest credit/loot were all the same range but I could be wrong. If you are standing in the crossroads and someone kills a thunder lizard in southern barrens you aren't getting any exp for example.
---
I like this idea! A dreani equivalent would have also been nice, but trickier. 
---
Yes, the zone design/art is really nice. Probably the one thing blizzard is able to get right.
---
So it makes them better against rogues because of their high chance to resist a stun... still not close to being even essentially immune to stuns tho
---
Not add flying mounts, LFG, and cross-faction sanctuaries 
---
I always used to eat cereals after doing this quest.
---
The worst kind of ninja?? No, let's make something clear. The worst kind of ninja is the @%#$*# who rolls need on all the drops from the final boss in the raid and then disenchants the items in front of everyone. In classic wow, such players will be blacklisted so hard they will likely NEVER find a new guild to join, even on another server (if transfers are allowed).
---
What you are describing is a fluke at best. I bet you that your "buddy" flying overhead saw the roll prompt and just rolled greed by habit or curiosity, not from maliciousness. If he had won, a simple message request explaining the situation would almost certainly result in the item being handed back. If they wanted to keep it however, blizzard already has a way to deal with this: a GM request. These incredibly random occurrences are part of the reason we sometimes need to talk to a human who can help fix this type of issue. 
---
Blizzard should stop acting like parents and just fuck off, focus on the game not on policing their playerbase.
---
Robe that looks so GAYYYYY LOL I shed a tear laughing
---
&gt; If you ended the fight with 100% mana, you were too careful with your  casting and this resulted in less damage. If you were oom halfway  through, you had the opposite problem. 
---
There is a bit of a misconception here that having mana is good, for healers that is true. For dps that is not necessarily true. Since fights end when the dps say so, it is up to them to push their dps to the limit.
---
\-You want to convert mana into damage as quickly as possible
---
\-You can use spells that are not mana efficient if you oom as the fight ends (so basically almost never used until end)
---
\-Some fights impose special rules on you which cause you to have to pool a part of your mana, like for aoe packs.
---
\-The more mana you spent the more damage you do.
---
\-If the fight ends and you are at half mana, that means the fight could have ended sooner if you spent more mana quicker and less efficiently.
---
I know this isn't exactly what you said but I have had players argue that if you oom first you are a worse mage/warlock, not realizing that while we may have the same mana pools, I converted all my mana to damage faster and am now getting "bonus" damage from wanding/100% mana regen rate.
---
I'm highly considering shaman. Ele looks fun in PvP
---
Thought I remembered group members at least rolling on green BOE's from multiple zones away but I could be wrong.
---
A really cheap and cost-efficient way to never go oom in most raid fights is to spam Greater Mana Potions. They don't add a lot, but you can use 2-3 per boss fight and that usually is enough to not go oom. The benefit to them is that they're dirt cheap and you can easily bring many, many stacks for almost no cost.
---
1. There are no established communities 2 weeks or 1 month into a server, most people will be between lvl 20-40 by then unless they game excessively.
---
2. maybe so
---
3. not when they see how cool classic is.
---
The fundamental reality is that it was a crusade and pretty much required that we leave Azeroth. The question is: how could they have better maintained ties with Azeroth? 
---
* Lose Shattrath as a capital. There should not have been a 'home base' on that scale in Outlands because that moves our roots out of Azeroth. It was a drab place to be. It hurt the story a bit because it doesn't make sense that a city could exist and thrive in a wasteland. Trainers and rep vendors should have been in Azeroth. 
---
* No flying. 
---
* Add some sources of TBC drops in Azeroth. Perhaps the mobs in places like Blasted Lands, Deadwind Pass, and Blood Elf areas could have dropped modern loot and materials. 
---
&gt; Every time you use the word "but" in this manner you might as well erase everything before it.
---
Really?..
---
Also are you even arguing in good faith anymore? "sacrifice", "honor farm"? Give me a break.
---
Yes, and I even think DotA 2 has the best report system in any game I've played, simply because you only have a limited amount of reports, and the game encourages muting over reporting. So if you are a dipshit who loves to spam report, you just run out of reports immediately. 
---
So the game encourages the use of mute function, and report is mostly saved for actual people who are griefing. But even then, there is still some room for abuse.
---
In other games like CSGO or LoL, or Overwatch people will just spam report 24/7 all the time for anything they don't like. Its just a horrible system that accomplishes nothing, might as well just censor any "bad" word in base game as it servers literally the same function.
---
Why even have an option to disable the "profanity filter" ?
---
A flyby looter is worse than a humble craftsman harvesting materials to help the general public, sir.
---
You're right. The exact right thing to do is very, very dependent on the fight, your class, your spec, and sometimes whos in your group (manaspring totems ftw). As a raiding mage, I ran out of mana based on my pots, trinkets, gems, all of which were based on my evocate timer. But rarely, a druid was in my group who would slam inervate on me whenever it was up and that was awesome. And, of course, everything is trumped by your threat. Sometimes you did too much damage and were forced to slow down to wait for your tank to get the threat back. 
---
Were you that guys in-game lawyer!!!???
---
"people I don't like shouldn't be able to play the game I like"
---
Why would you want stats on gear? Are you some kind of casual who needs stats to win fights?
---
Get a group of very skilled players together and camp the Horde AV spawn cave. Not. let. one. horde. out.
---
Graduated 2nd in my class at Dalaran Law School.
---
and chance to wipe for hours and piss off the players doubling your dps who you take gear from!
---
And I'm doing this as my profession, probably longer than you have been studying it. So lets just agree that we can't discuss this further due to our fundamentally different experiences in the subject at hand.
---
Don't tell me.... you're a ROGUE!
---
this is why its hard to nail down what classic will be
---
ah yes ret paladins. the best pocket healers in pvp. 
---
Well my trade does require a little bit of ..... SUBTLETY.
---
lol if you’re in a forty man with only one paladin whose ret you’re not gonna have fun. 
---
Only really matters for 1v1 or wpvp. If a rogue is fighting the warrior in a BG while a healer is behind the warrior healing him.. you have more serious problems.
---
No flying mounts. No resilience. No hybridization of classes in pvp.
---
The banter on discord is usually the best thing about raiding. Get some colourful types in your guild and you'll have a blast doing anything in larger numbers basically.
---
He didn't mean only 1 paladin, he meant only one REtardadin.
---
Look for a casual or meme spec friendly guild. They exist. Just don't expect to clear much beyond bwl
---
Man that’s what I loved about vanilla &amp; BC Epics were actually EPIC!!! Gear was so hard to come by and felt so rewarding when you actually came across a rare or epic drop unlike retail wow...
---
damn a real guild master!? 
---
I liked resilience. It made world pvp fun. It was awesome wrecking PVE nerds with full S3 gear while they were in tier 4 
---
My laptop when I started playing wow was so terrible that I used to sit outside my house with the charging lead going through the window during winter, wrapped up in winter clothes freezing my ass off because it would overheat and my frames would drop to about 0.5 per second if I sat indoors. Totally worth it! 
---
Was too young then :(
---
My favorite expansion with mechanics was MOPS.  Then Blizzard had to go and fuck everything about it up.  Ruining class design, coupled with increased emphasis in shitty diablo style rng gearing.  Now I can't be bothered to get back into wow.  I will say I liked the leveling but I just hated the class design and I have no patience to go back and level another character with the way the expansion is designed now.  
---
i mean if having him vs not having him means having or not having pally buffs, he’d be the only one
---
S3 was much superior to t4 anyway like u were sealclubbing
---
You seem to be fixated on raids, because lots of gear IS an upgrade in other parts of the game.
---
Spinal Reaver in MC, Ashkandi in BWL, Zin'Rokh in ZG are primarily twohand PvP weapons and pretty trash in PvE. Lots of warriors may not get a raid DPS upgrade like DFT for another year, but for most of them their joy will be through the roof if they get a good 2hander early in raid progression to take their e-peen into the world.
---
I understand the notion if you come from retail. The game is basically dead outside mystic dungeon crawling Diablo3 style, mythic raids and minigame arenas and you dont even get PvP gear in raids.
---
But the vanilla world is coherent. PvP gear is worn in PvE, raid gear is worn in farming dungeons to equip newcomers in your guild or farming dungeons for gold or for PvP.
---
A new piece of gear can have many applications.
---
To give some examples to my rant:

---
Both shitty raid DPS helms by blown out of the water by lionheart helm, but incredible PvP items. 
---
The problem with resilience is it made healers OP. It was silly how easy it was for a druid to keep HoTs on and never die, just cause he had 300+ resil.
---
TBC was World of Healercraft.
---
Ty
---
Thunderfury, and my trusty frostsabre. What else do you need in life? 
---
Later for aq and nax the difficulty is farming the incredible amount of consumables
---
then also no bladeedge mountains, or rework them a bit to make them non flying friendly
---
OP hasn't even put in the effort to read what Blizzard's solution is. He was just triggered by the word 'sharding'.
---
There is a plethora of games that are "simple" but immensly enjoyable. 
---
Take Gothic2. If you play a twohanded warrior type character who abhorrs magic, you just swing your weapon 99% of the time. In comparison to the witcher the game may seem dull, but it's still very enjoyable.
---
Or take D2 and D3. D3 has arguably a higher skill ceiling, but the Diablo2 gameplay is still very enjoyable in its own right. It may not be for everyone, but I personally do not enjoy having 250APM in an MMO. If I want that, I go play Starcraft 2 to mash buttons. By just being so extremly focused on boss abilities and your own rotation I myself feel that I do not take in the fight anymore. 
---
I wouldnt be able to watch twin emps' epic sword smashing, I'd have to watch the 10th puddle of do-not-stand-in-fire. 
---
Too much button mashing as it is shown in current WoW isn't enjoyable for me.
---
for no lifers
---
Good luck wearing pvp gear in raids
---
That's a much bigger deal and a more interesting thing to know about!
---
You arent wrong
---
I play vanilla for the social aspect. The world seems bigger.
---
MehHuuuurrr! This will surely effect my inheritance! 
---
It's different in organized PvP. If you don't have a near instant gap closer like charge I can guarantee you you'll get CC'd or have your ghost wolf dispelled before you can close the gap.
---
I think spec viability was a work in progress thing for blizzard
---
If vanilla was kept up I think 1.13 1.14 etc would have tweaked more talents naturally
---
*Unless you already have a character from that faction.  It would be really bad if someone couldn’t make a bank alt for their main
---
Other way around imo. Hunters can abuse viper sting to make clothies suffer, especially healers.
---
We lost our guild master back in WotLK to a car accident.  
---
Great, fun loving guy who always made everyone laugh. Didn't log in for a few days. One of the people who knew him IRL broke the news to the rest of us.
---
Especially if the Abyssal Lords are already in game
---
There is a fucktonne of stuns in this game so hardiness
---
What? For warrior R14 melee weapons, pants are among the absolute very best being good contenders with CARNAGE legplates, boots are nearly as good as Chromaggus or AQ40 boots, hands may or may not be worn depending if you are BRE wielder spamming hamstring for procs, shoulders are very good for 2hand fury, because you dont need so much hit from TS.
---
So you sport a solid 4/6 R13 gear and the R14 weps will be worn deep into Naxxramas.
---
Awesome work! 
---
At least you look  cool even if u die more
---
And that johnny bravo /flex
---
In prems any serious PvPer should go alliance anyways to roflstomp horde prems with paladins anyways. :D
---
[What comes to mind](https://pics.me.me/thumb_look-how-they-massacred-my-boy-when-you-get-to-43051752.png)
---
Hunter PvP gear is great in raids
---
One of the dps must be the most boring
---
Healers and tanks have a lot more decision making to do. They cant turn the brain off and just spam the same button looking at tv.
---
U use the imp for hp in a tank party
---
Or sac the succubus for bonus dmg
---
ik but im not fan of that game :P
---
Id be ok with it
---
Tho it may break solo farming for some
---
Neato
---
Myeah one has to consider that making an alt for farming can mean even more than 200h of playing
---
In that time it may be better to farm gold with ur subpar main
---
But if you plan to get value out of that alt for a long long long time and even play it as normal sometimes then go for it
---
You said you "used to be a pretty hardcore Athiest."
---
I'm as curious as u/Sawyermblack, how do you define your religious beliefs (or lack thereof) now? 
---
Great comment/story, and I really don't mean to pry, I'm just genuinely curious. :) Live/Love 
---
Maybe just how I work but yeh it takes a bit but then I can adjust and tweak everything I want. 
---
I wouldn't take any of that into consideration. None. Just the state of the lore as it was when vanilla launched. I'm not interested in Naaru or Void Lords or whatever. 
---
Let the Light be that somewhat mysterious entity. Let the orcs be...well, survivors in this new (for them) planet, etc.  
---
I honestly hope RP'ers will take Classic as it was when Vanilla launched. 
---
In a way they can't but do that. Them moment they use or refer you  "new lore" that would sound right away off. 
---
"How do you know this?!?" type of thing. It's same as "meta knowledge". Wouldn't really fit with Classic and RP. 
---
I missed that part, very true.

No problem, just checking as I am likely picking between Priest and Warlock on alliance. So I thought for a moment there was extra reason to go for the priest (if scream was wotf-proof).
---
Probably some stupid gimmick boss that other bosses can't complete.  Viscidus?
---
I see a lot of leveling guides telling me to put talent points in improved healthstone, is it because you gain more health than mana spent, and therefore is your way of leveling without drinking and eating? Am I really suppose to create healthstone constantly and using them for efficiency?
---
My pc was so bad when i first played in vanilla that whenever i used my hearthstone i would just go afk for like 5 minutes while it loaded

That moment when you replace your shitty half length cloak with a full length one...my life felt complete.

Skinning has value open world farming but also any gathering tbh ( like bats in epl) like may u get crystals or lotus.

Herb works for zg bloodvines farm the first 3 at start, rfd disenchant runs and grave moss, maraudon dis runs and the 5 ghost mushrooms.

Mining in brd pickpocket runs? Not sure if there are nodes on the route. Mining thorium at the end of dme jump runs where 1 of 2 also needs disenchanting. Silithus but there may be much competition.

I recently leveled in Aszuna again. Poor Runas. 
---
If I absolutely had to I'd go assassination first. Sub's entire tree is terrible for PvE, you'll be level 31 before you even get a good talent that can be used in PvE or PvP.
---
I know you don't want to do combat but it's just so significantly better for levelling, improved SS and 5% hit rating will speed you up a lot.
---
You can get through most of BEM without a flying mount. It's not that bad a leveling zone honestly. 
---
I think LFG and LFR were the biggest mistakes. I understand why they implemented it but it just completely destroyed the social aspect of finding groups and talk to people.
---
The WoW Mountain Dews remind me of Ulduar and Wrath. Good memories!
---
Combat is a lot faster for leveling, but if your main focus is pvp while leveling then you want to get Hemo first because having the stealth talents is the most important factor for pvp. 
---
Alliance has salvation. Horde has better aoe healing.

Alliance has strong pve races but so do horde.

Horde has better pvp races cuz hardiness broken af.

I used to be pretty adamant that religion was just a byproduct of evolution. Humans formed it (or found themselves in it) as a way to stick together and unite to fend off predators and keep social circles tighter to further the progress of the village. I still do believe that to an extent.

The older I get (I’m 29), the less I care about religion, so I’d identify myself as agnostic. “I don’t know if there is a god or not, and I don’t really care. Whatever happens happens, you do you, I’ll do me. I don’t care who or what you support and I done really have a dog in the fight.” 
---
I feel like my wife doesn’t have a lot of hobbies so I recommended she go to church, because she was involved early in her life. She thought it was a great idea and I told her I’d go on Sundays to support her. Just so she didn’t have to go alone and it would be a nice way to support her beliefs. 
---
I grew up in family where there was no bias for religion. My parents never went to church, but growing up my parents always said that we could go and they would even help us find a church etc. no overly religious people in my circles. Religion hasn’t played a significant role at all in my life lol. Just giving you background. 
---
The name you choose are only compared to the people on the realm you choose to play on. At launch, all realms will be empty so you'll be able to choose whatever name you like. (until it's taken or not within naming guidelines)
---
There isn't a global name database in WoW, names are per server.
---
Classic will have its own servers, separated from retail.
---
There will be a day-one rush to reserve names I think.
---
Agreed with regards to 99% of 'quality of life' and gameplay  changes, but class balance was something that was heavily iterated on and drastically altered throughout the whole of vanilla. There was never an original intention that classes should be as unbalanced for endgame content as they turned out, and we will never know what the devs would have dome with classic had they been given more time, money, and a directive to just improve the game with that original design philosophy instead of working on the Burning Crusade. With the way they're responding now however, I've got my fingers crossed that after we've had a couple of years nostalgia they might create a server or two that showcases a vanilla unchanged save for fairer numbers.             
---
Yup very common for almost every caster. Mana issues is a major reason why specs like Elemental Shaman, Shadow Priest, and Boomkin are simply not viable, because they just go oom so stupidly fast. Warlocks have it good because they have infinite mana. Mages have it alright too with their mana gems and evocation but you still have to bring plenty of mana pots and demonic runes. 
---
We don’t know how great the Wowhead Thotbot is going to be. It’s likely going to have more resources poured into it with factual information about actual Classic and not private server data like Classic DB. As of right now, Classic DB is far better, but that’s because Classic isn’t out yet. We’ll see.
---
Not rogue
---
Not warrior if dps
---
I've been doing some testing the last week, because I thought hemo would be crap to level as but combat seems so boring to me so it's worth a look. From my testing I found hemo is actually a completely fine levelling spec. It's about 15% slower dps than combat but with camo and mod you can use stealth grinding mobs and you take less damage than combat and it feels way more fun than just running up to them and spamming SS. Plus you're stronger in any pvp you come across.    
---
I think I've decided on the talent path I'll take which will be malice and remorseless before going into subtlety. Those two talents are just too good to give up and are a great dps increase from lvl 10 onwards, it literally doubles your crit chance in crappy starter gear. After that in subtlety work towards initiative, ghostly strike before picking up the 3 bread and butter sub hemo dps talents, serrated blades, dirty deeds and hemo. Then ill go down to prep not because it's amazing but because you're so far in the tree you might as well, then go back to the assas tree to get ruthlessness, relentless etc.  
---
I would like to get precision but there's just no way to make it work. Malice for 5 points is an easy investment, but to get precision you need to sink 10 points into combat, so that means 15 points out of tree before working to hemo, which would be lvl 47 before getting hemo. You could get malice and then hemo and then work towards precision to have the +hit for levelling in your 50s but I don't think it'd be better.  
---
I'm interested to see what other people say or if there's a 'standard' build that's known to be most efficient for hemo levelling.
---
Flying was pretty integral to BC. Just make it to where flying mounts couldn’t leave outlands. 
---
Ahh, I didn’t even know wowhead thotbot was a thing. I’ll keep my eye on that one. I’m sure not to long after launch there will be an obvious source. 
---
Ah I see, ok, thanks for the clarification.
---
Why I dont like bc:
---
- arenas (many good duelers stopped playing bg's and they become a more noobish place)
---
- 25 ppl raids (killed social and epics/gearscore/dps started to be more valuable than a player itself)
---
- flying mounts (killed outdoor pvp)
---
- daily quests (boring mandatory hell)
---
- small and fast 5ppl dungeons (people started to maximize runs per evening, instead of just doing it once. It led to many leaves, rage quits in cases of small mistake, dps blaming)
---
- deprecated PVP ranks (killed all motivation to play pvp. Except, good looking pvp gear)
---
OP didn't seem like a super passive aggressive question to me. There nothing wrong asking someone why he likes jazz music, and it can be useful because you might realize something that you didn't. 
---
I'm levelling a rogue as hemo at the moment and when I switch specs to check I find combat does about 8% more dps. At lvl60 my T0 rogue gains 6% dps switching from hemo to combat which maybe an extra second kill time per mob.
---
On a PVP server, levelling as hemo means I survive gank attempts much more reliably thanks to prep/faster vanishes/improved stealth and the increase in movement speed is great. 
---
People will tell you it's a trashy spec for levelling but my personal experience shows me it's a trivial nerf. I'll test dps again at lvl50 on my current pserver run though but I doubt combat will be that more impressive, I'll definitely level as hemo in Classic. 
---
Yeh, same here I absolutely loathe it.
---
Because at the very least they heard our concerns, and instead of doubling down on THEIR decision, they said "Hey, you guys have a valid concern, here's a compromise".
---
Haha yeah, but at least people will have room to be creative :)
---
Wowhead bought out Thotbot a longtime ago. They recently made a Classic version of Wowhead that has a Thotbot skin. Not a complete clone but might tug on the nostalgia strings a little.
---
What do you mean "leave outland"? You could only fly in outland in TBC.
---
They only said they were considering using sharding for the starting areas. They did not confirm it nor did they explain what they consider starting areas.
---
Overall Orc is going to be better over thousands of pvp encounters. But getting a Stomp off and interrupting an important cast, or giving time for a clutch heal feels so damn good.
---
Just a small note from experience - wand tagging sucks dick. Priest tagging sucks in general. The wand takes time to charge up and also has travel time, rank1 smite should be better.
---
If they expand the game beyond naxx or implement a different system, wouldn’t that make the game a brand new MMO?
---
And blizz said they wouldn’t manage two MMOs but they said years ago they won’t make classic... but here we are, so who knows :)
---
Sweet. Thanks for the info man. I’ve been outa the loop for a bit. 
---
The only reason Blizzard wants this in the game is to save on customer support costs and after everything they've done people are fine with them ruining the purity of the game for money. It's literally the same as adding an mtx shop.
---
They talked about a level squish and wants the communities feedback on that and the number Ion kept saying was 60. If that’s the case what would “vanilla” in retail be? 1-30? 30-35 for TBC? And so on till the end of BFA is 60
---
The philosophy in Vanilla was different. You don't raid for gear, you gear up for raiding. You raid for the sake of raiding and discovering new dungeons and bosses with other people, not to loot your tf bis that will allow you to do the same raid but in harder difficulty.
---
As for gameplay this is another story and I'm not sure I'm ready to play vanilla priest over its bfa version. 
---
Yeah unfortunately for you the rest of the world that includes Blizzard doesn't follow the southern hemisphere when talking business plans. 
---
Well the title of the thread says “and later expansions” and you could fly in Azeroth in WotLK. 
---
Obviously limited only engineers and the rogue mask is lvl 15  from westfall bandits
---
Which is what a beta is used for by addon devs. You said they wouldn't, I said they do, because they do. 
---
Because it's a proper solution. Have you raided in vanilla? Do you know what a pain in the ass it was when your ML fucked up and gave an item to another person by mistake? Blizzard, in my opinion, made a very good decision here, and these are words that I haven't said about modern days Blizzard for a looooong time.
---
Sorry, but this is wrong. That's not how it was in real vanilla. /u/justthetipbro22 is correct - it's more of an erratic behavior
---
I think speculating about how BC would have looked if it was a horizontal expansion rather than the vertical expansion it is, is very interesting.
---
This is how I would want BC (constructive criticism is very welcome)
---
Now first, there are some points that definetely need to be rectified:
---
No flying mounts,
---
No resilience gear
---
No Bloodelfs and Draenei as playable races (so no Paladin for Horde, no Shaman for Alliance)
---
Now here is where it gets controversial.
---
Let's look at BC with horizontal progression.
---
No new levels. So 60 is still the max. All of the 60 content still stays relevant.
---
Rather than focusing on Outland as a new continent, the Vanilla idea of Hellfire Peninsula as a level 60 zone is used and HP is a Level 60 Elite Zone with a raid at the end. You basically have to go there with a group because it's just to tough to go alone even if you're very well geared.
---
So no Cross faction capital. There is no capital on outland, players are regularly forced to go back to the EK/Kalimdor.
---
On Azeroth all the empty spots of the map are used to create new zones. 
---
Mount Hyjal 
---
The Zone west of Burning Steppes/ South of Dun Morogh
---
The Zone east of the Wetlands
---
Gilneas
---
Northeron
---
Quel Thalas (But not the way it was done in BC. It should basically be a Level 60 zone similar to Hellfire Peninsula with a ton of endgame content and a post Naxx raid at the end.)
---
Dragon Isles
---
Karazhan
---
Caverns of Time
---
Most of those zones/dungeons should be filled with catch up content to give the lower players a chance to see more of the expansion and the vanilla content.
---
I would add the Bloodelfs to the game, not as a playable race but as a neutral faction that both factions can interact with.
---
You find them in Northeron where they found refuge after they fled from Northrend after Arthas kicked their ass. Here Kael'Thas is not a psychopathic maniac but  the awesome character he was in WC3. The Bloodelf faction should be hostile first (which makes sense from a lore perspective since they hate both the horde and the Alliance) and the player has to gain trust by farming rep for them. If you have enough rep, they will start to give you quests which will eventually lead to the players retaking Quel'Thalas and trying to purify the Sunwell. Dragon Isles and Naxx iare used as a high end raids that have to be cleared to get items that are capable of purifying the Sunwell. Only then can you go to the final raid which is Silvermoon + Isles of Quel Donas where you fight the scourge again)
---
So there would be at least 3 new high end raids (Dragon isles, Silvermoon and at least one on Hellfire Peninsula, + several new World bosses on Hellfire Peninsual and Quel Thalas). They would of course all be 40 man and be on par with Naxx when it comes to difficulty. 
---
It would be intersting to see how horizontal progression would work hypothetically. 99.9% we're never going to see this but speculating is still interesting.
---
If you have any more ideas/improvements pls share them.
---
No, it isn't. Is this bait or are you that slippery with your slopes? Blizzard is listening to the community while protecting their own interests. We could not ask for anything more.
---
Yes, there are very efficient. Only a 2m cd if IIIRC. If you also life tap as soon as your life is 100% and repeat, no need to drink most of the time !
---
Loved TBC...absolutely hated flying.
---
Just to add to this, Greater mana pots are the lesser version of the top tier mana pot “Major mana potion”.  Downgrading is really great if you’re on a budget or the fight isn’t that demanding.
---
Two Gathering Professions (or Enchanting) and sell everything.
---
On 60 get your professions up as you like.
---
Gotta put spikes on everything to make sure no more dragons can land on the roofs, put spikes on the spikes if you have to
---
I miss old org, jumping into the palm tree
---
Gotcha
---
Did pots and runes share CD?
---
Uh... yes?
---
Because even the #nochanges people want changes.... been that way since the announcement. People say one thing until something they want comes up to be changed.
---
This is the stupidest thing I've read on Reddit today, and I sort by "new".
---
Would you mind saying which classes want which rank? I Would prefer a class which uses pve gear
---
not all of az till cata
---
Is that the cloth reward from WC? They look so shit on every race, but are the first easily available shoulders with stats. Makes me sad to equip them 
---
No you couldn't. Azeroth flying was introduced in Cataclysm when they ~~ruined~~ remade the entire game world.
---
So the new continent doesn’t count as Azeroth? 
---
That's not even up for debate. Even shitty phones easily have raw computation power that triples your standard 2004 pc.
---
Fuck, I bet there are dozens of apps that hit harder than classic did back then. Just a a matter of making it work on android
---
Oh God, thank you, I thought I was crazy. I resubbed briefly a few months ago to see the changes and I just couldn't bear the running animation of my tauren. My poor character has his arms flailing around as he runs, while the old animation had, I don't know, more restraint, if that makes sense. It wasn't my own character anymore and it made me sad.
---
This community is fickle. Everything will be alright once the game is released. 
---
Different strokes for different folks. I would never ruin my leveling experience like this.
---
Blizzard was going to have to deal with this issue one way or another. Since they are quite clearly not going to devote tons of resources on GM tickets to deal with mislooting, loot trading was staying in some shape or form.
---
The compromise they reached is probably as good as it's going to get.
---
In dungeons warrior can tank and be the most important one
---
Considering it has no gameplay relation to the original continents, how related are they really?  
---
The only thing that ties Northrend to the rest of Azeroth is the addition of a zeppelin/boat near Orgrimmar and Stormwind. Otherwise it might as well have been Outland or Draenor in function.
---
Knowing blizzard the servers will only be playable for an hour the first day 
---
It’s.. still in Azeroth, though. I don’t see the point in what you’re arguing about. My original point still stands, leave flying mounts in Outland. 
---
I would prefer to get dks removed, more world PvP.
---
Well, yes, I'm definitely switching on 60,   
---
and you are saying that selling gathering would give enough money to cover my gear and have more money surplus, opposed to gearing "for free" and not selling reagents, right?
---
Those are from Shadowfang Keep.
---
I would zoom in and look directly at the floor when in major cities 
---
You completely missed my point because you want to argue technicalities.
---
You're technically right.
---
Warlock first, then Warrior
---
I think you missed my original point and begin a technicality argument for no reason at all lmao
---
Why do orcs have the best racials for locks? It's 25% increased attack power, not 25% increased damage
---
The kingdom of Azeroth was a prosperous one.
---
Yeah, but the gains are so small. Wouldn't improved life drain be better in the long run?
---
You can pretty easily do MC and BWL with ~35 people.
---
Unless Blizzard specifically mentions them as not being in, I think they will be in as they are in by default in 1.12.
---
TFW you want MC and end up with MC instead.
---
This.
---
300% speed land mounts would've been much more interesting.
---
Can do but not casually. Well warriors cant tank casually either.
---
For deadweight bosses u swap gear and pretend ur heals matter xd
---
Lost my brother aswell in 2015, going to use his character name aswell.
---
I hope they scrap retail and make a vanilla philosophy expansion to vanilla. Sort of like an alternate reality tbc. 
---
They overaggro, die, get rez and voila fresh threat meters
---
Its a big brain play 200iq
---
Ive seen a guy dualwield tank anub

Saph would murder viscidus
---
Hi, /u/Boxtel187
---
Last week: EVERYONE STOP BEING SO ANGRY!
---
This week: WHY ISN'T EVERYONE MORE ANGRY!
---
First helmet and first shoulder pads &lt;3 "im a grown man now" :D 
---
One of the only reasons that there is a community and communication in vanilla was because of the fact a lot of the content wasn’t /couldn’t be done alone. It was hard, hell a team of 5 levels 30s couldn’t kill the elemental from the whirlwind level 30 warrior quest. People had to work together. It’s possible that they could do that in retail but it’s also very risky. 
---
VERY thorough answer, thank you!
---
Think this'll be more fun that just going the combat route so this  cements Hemo as my leveling spec for Classic.
---
Getting Remorseless Attacks asap sounds really smart, but is malice worth delaying hemo 5 levels for? I'm not a veteran so 5% crit might be amazing
---
The difficulties of leveling and gearing a warrior are beyond over hyped, it's really not hard. 
---
If you are willing to form your own groups and tank it's even easier. Yes your to 60 time will be 1-2 days / played slower than a lock - which is negligible if you are talking about investing hundreds or thousands of hours into the class over the course of years.
---
Both are extremely strong in PvP, both scale extremely well with gear (admittedly Warrior starts off a bit stronger), both are very desirable in raids, warriors will be over popped, but also more needed for both tanking and dps.
---
It's a wash IMO, play what you think you will enjoy.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if the retail team uses classic as a research platform so they can figure it what ideas would be risky or not as risky. Like adding weapon skills back in with weapon training would probably not work out. But adding class trainers (so we can use the metric oceans of gold on) and spell ranks back might work
---
In my opinion should arrive in the same time as AQ gare opening quest. On a lore perspective, we did not want to go to silithius until à threat as been detected there
---
All of the things you listed are the fun parts 
---
I agree with Shattrath being a capital and the coexistence of the Horde/Alliance was a bit weird in TBC.  However, the resource drops in the old world is pretty much pointless and just a hassle with being required to run around in a place 10 levels below you to get drops.  Basically everyone at the time would have hated it.  I can't think of too many games that require you to go through past underleveled content repeatedly to do relevant level content (not that I have played a comprehensive number of games I am probably fairly limited).  
---
Flying is one of those inbetweens.  At the time I really didn't mind flying at all. You dont get it until you hit max level anyway and despite what people here often say worldPvP got massacred by BGs primarily, not by flying.  How often in vanilla did you see max levels duking it out in the world besides duels near capitals and near raid content?  BGs pretty much evaporated the roaming solo/groups of lvl 60s in max/near max level zones getting into fights.  If you really wanted to bring worldPvP back into focus get rid of all BGs and thats what you will get.  That being said flying did make dodging worldPvP into raids much easier which was possibly the only hold out left for max level world PVP besides ganking.  Most people would just fly and zip into the raid portal which made it hard to kill them before they reached (in which case they would usually just ghost run towards the portal but I guess you get a bit of griefing out of it 1v25).
---
Saph can't shatter viscidus aaaayyyy
---
You have to understand that Dun Morogh and Tirisfal Glades are completely different zones. There are clear disparities between them. And I can say Tirisfal is one of the fastest starters, the quests are easy to follow and chain for it to make sense getting level 12 there is fast as hell.
---
My bank alts are often rogues, and yes, I take them out with a higher level to westfall to get that mask.  You can even get lvl 1 shoulders in vanilla from a seasonal quest
---
Fine, you're helping 34 other people. Or 33 or whatever the cut off is. 
---
By most of the wpvp ... you meant battlegrounds?  Because 90+% of world PvP died the day people decided to sit in their capital city(or entrance queue early on) and wait on BG queues rather than roaming the world looking for PvP.
---
&gt;the alternative is what, a super technologically advanced &amp; genius faction? That'd be broken.
---
The Asura in GW2 were a bit more towards that end of the "genius tinkerer" spectrum
---
Play gnome and it fits better
---
It's a global game. They should talk in global terms. 
---
Yes, life drain is better. Imp stone is not bad but full affli is the way to go I think for leveling
---
Fishing numba one
---
Should do a bracket and straw poll each round. If you add all 20 and 40 man raids plus summoned bosses and azurgos and kazak it comes out to 64 bosses. Too good not to do. 
---
It's lvl 15 , but a lvl 1 rogue can wear it :)
---
It's the perfect compromise. Blizz wants to have 100 instead of 10.000 tickets and we don't want loot trading. Ding, everyone is fine.
---
Apart from the obvious flying mounts, personally I think the whole "x new zones" every expansion was a huge mistake.
---
They have so much content available within Azeroth without creating entirely new continents to travel to (which then become irrelevant as soon as the next expansion hits). Karazhan, Gilneas, Hyjal, Grim Batol, Tel'Abim to name but a few. 
---
I would have liked to have seen horizontal progression instead of vertical; new 60 zones with stuff to do after Naxx content etc (probably with a stat squish instead of a complete wipe of gear).
---
That would still make existing content important in order to progress into the new zones/raids etc.
---
At what stage are you talking about buying or making gear? Pre-60 or post-60?  
---
If pre-60, there's not much gear you need to make. It only makes things slightly easier than normal. It's not worth the effort if you want to be efficient. Take what you get from quests and drops and you'll be good.  
---
If post-60, you'll be making the Devilsaur pieces and that's about all. Do whatever you need to do money-wise to buy the Devilsaur pieces you need and then you're good. You don't even need leatherworking.
---
Thanks for the response! I grew up in the Christian church, my parents were, and still are, very religious. I "fell out of faith" in my late teens. I would probably have been considered an agnostic at that point in my life, but, quite honestly, I didn't care enough to bother defining my beliefs. 
---
I'm 32 now. I have a beautiful wife and two awesome little boys who are, in equal parts, shitheads and the best things to ever happen to me. (Please forgive the humble brag.)
---
I've been attending my childhood church recently, at my wife's insistence, but I've honestly been loving it. My boys have been loving "Children's Church" and I've been enjoying the services. 
---
You seem like a very open minded person, and it's awesome you've been going to church with your wife, even though you don't necessarily believe in God, or a god, or whatever. That's love, and that's what being a good person is all about.
---
Yes I know honor farm is better in bgs but people were still doing wpvp to secure ores, herbs and mob farming spots. Flying made it much safer since you couldn't get hit while travelling.
---
Also there are people like me who kill hordies for the sport alone.
---
Lmao this troll is about to hook so many cheeks.  
---
1. Do you have discord server ? If yes, please give me link :)
---
2. You guys already playing together on retail ?
---
It's almost like people are individuals with different opinions.
---
Nah, Reddit is a hivemind. Everything is a simulation.
---
Im sure some guilds raids friday sat sun nights
---
?
---
Yes.
---
I'm getting there!
---
This sounds like perfect guild.
---
Do you guys play at the moment on retail together ?
---
U prolly have to play on different continent servers
---
The success of private servers proves that for a large population, it's not nostalgia. It's just a good game.  
---
Absolutely. I already have a list of names for each class picked out. First hour of Classic for me will be making all my characters :)

---
Vs rogue you have well-timed insignia-&gt;FD-trap-&gt;reset. And well, you have enough anti-rogue tools (flare, track hidden) to prevent him from getting the jump in most cases. 
---
Vs clothies... it just depends who gets to impose their playstyle. If the hunter can play his way (i.e. keeping long range and kiting or just mana draining) it'll be an easy win. If he gets deadzoned and/or caught by cc (namely fear) it'll be a tough time.  That said, if unfocused they still are a nuisance for them as you point out due to viper in a group setting, but 1v1 might be decided before you drain enough mana from them.  
---
No need for xpacs?
---
Blizz can check to see how many subs play only vanilla
---
Technically people being upset means they are passionate. Of course we can't know how many of them are paid Activision actors to drum up controversy, or Pserver kiddies sad about getting their EZ Rank 14 grind nerfed.
---
Dude, Blizzard is still a company that needs to earn a profit. Do you expect them to release a product while not profiting? The entitlement of this post is outrageous. We’re lucky to get official WoW classic. 
---
Vael could probably kill him through burning adrenaline (-100% Max Health).
---
Twin emps with bugs and intelligent movement of the bugs (so they don't sit in the poison) they could shatter him as well (freeze very slowly with Blizzard [idk if there is a time span to get enough freezes in]).
---
Are you from Eastern yurop?
---
As '1.13' etc, purely on separate progression servers. 1.12 servers need to remain intact.
---
Cheapest epics tend to be &lt;30g on most servers.
---
He's hinting at the fact that 1 hour into the server, everyone and their mother will be questing around goldshire. I trust your leveling choice and decisions, but by traveling to elwynn you are 1) getting behind into the zerg with small hopes of breaking out and getting ahead in the near future and 2) leveling in the most crowded zone on alliance side. Isnt it possible to make your wand at IF as well, or am I missing something?
---
Lol
---
Way ahead of ya.
---
It's fickle because there are almost 60,000 people who subscribe to this subreddit, there are bound to be different opinions.
---
Lol who the fuck will have r13 14 gear

More like:

&gt;Open the gate!

&gt;Open it more!

&gt;More god damnit!
---
This is so accurate it's scary.
---
I was going to make a similar post about why RPPvP servers are a nightmare, but you beat me to it. 
---
It's only 20 hours played. Casual.
---
Let's start.
---
What do you think are my chance to find a guild raiding from 7.30 to 10.30? (CET)
---
I'm scared it would be too early to Brits as it means 6.30 to 9.30 for them... 
---
Great memories man. I have some good memories too, I was only 14 when WoW came out but I remember how real it felt. And I know I will enjoy it once again. See you in Azeroth bro
---
Reaching lvl 20 can be done by around 8 Hours by the fastest (esp. hunters) with well optimised routes. So I would say your Times are Not the worst, But there is def Space to improve. 
---
Like other Said, I would skip the early traveling Part - a good benchmark for lvl 10 would be 2h ish
---
That was more a druid problem than a 'healers' problem and some form of resilience was absolutely required for their idea of trying to make arena an esport (not making a value judgement on that plan, just saying). Druids were just gods in TBC. Far too much of the power of their healing throughput was in instant cast HoTs, compared to the other healers who actually had to open their spell tree and be vulnerable to interrupts to do any kind of real healing. Other healers couldn't fully prehot and go into bear and be unkillable.
---
That said, healers in general were a bit too powerful in non-arena pvp but I think this could have been solved by possibly reducing the effectiveness of resil by 60% (or some other number) when not inside an arena.
---
I don't think Twin Emps could do enough damage to kill Vael before Burning Adrenaline gets them (-100% Max HP eventually).
---
Their immunity is hard to consider in other fights due to how the targeting would work (assuming its threat based), which one of them would do more threat (could they control threat intelligently)? If they can't intelligently control their threat and depending on which one does more their immunity could be worthless (they share a health pool). I also imagine C'thun tentacles could eventually out DPS their heal, while never doing enough DPS themselves to prevent that from happening.
---
I like Twin Emps as well due to them possibly being able to kill Viscidus if they get bugs, but Vael and C'thun seem rough if not impossible.
---
Nope
---
"Hey man I can't wait to play WoW with you!" "Oh, I can't create a character with my friend, I guess I won't be playing." Terrible idea that will never happen.
---
I can see the game going to shit if they keep adding higher numbers in the gear tho
---
That last part can't be real.
---
At launch, is it worth farming say skinning/mining while leveling for the mount at level 40, assuming there won’t be any 60s for at least 2 weeks to buy the mats?
---
Or if it’s worth then I guess I need to stash the mats and wait a little bit? Any suggestions?
---
Myep and Blizz will not cater for the 1% neets
---
When is the release getting announced?!
---
And for the simple question ... yeah what dungeons are actually worth doing while still wanting to go for the firsts? I will have 3 weeks vacation so I plan to "rush" to 60, still I wanna do some dungeons.
---
Death Mines - because thats the shit
---
Stockade - all 6 quests are easily obtainable and besides wetlands next to each other
---
Scarlet Monastery - very strong items
---
Maraudon - very strong items, good tank trinket from quest
---
Zul'Farrak - strong items, easy quests
---
Other than that, everything 50+ (ST or BRD for example) is worth going for I guess?
---
It's not solvable without massively inconveniencing players, the only way to fix it is with free character transfers.
---
People who want to wear PvP gear in raids?
---
You are shifting goal posts here, mate. Point is: PvP gear is being worn in PvE, you implied it isn't, I refuted, you are shifting the goal posts, because people indeed wear PvP rewards in PvE. :O  
---
Besides mages still wear Mindfang, AV OH, 2pc blue PvP set for the awesome 2pc +sp, pants, wrists, rings.
---
Educate yourself about vanilla itemisation, before farming full magisters for your mage. ;)
---
Why do people like you even talk on forums?
---
I thought around 4-6 months pro Phase. 
---
Preferable the first and the last 6 months at least. 
---
I feel like 2 years is like the absolute minimum. Which feels already rushed. 
---
For Skinning for sure just sell it. Thats what many people going to do. The leather give quite some money at vendors.
---
About mining ... if sharding is a thing, it will kinda cause a overload of stuff in the auction house, so I would think you wont get much out of it. Prolly better to keep it or just dont go for it while leveling (the tin-iron phase is annoying to level anyways and would kinda stop you)
---
&gt;I can't think of too many games that require you to go through past underleveled content repeatedly to do relevant level content
---
I think this could be done well with good design. It would require reworking parts of zones. I think they could avoid making it a hassle if the level 70 areas in Azeroth were engaging. Which reminds me of something else: don't have us level to 70. Keep us at level 60 and make the dungeons and raids based more upon something like resistances or some other defensive characteristic instead of expanded damage output. Do that and those old mining/herbing paths would be nearly as interesting as ever, if slightly less dangerous. 
---
&gt;flying
---
I saw people out and about in Vanilla on a mid-size server. Lots of farming and traveling. You could sit by a road in EPL and see enough people ride by on a busy day to call it light traffic. Also, I recently told [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azym51/vanilla_activities_didnt_need_the_heavy_hand_of/) about a little experience in Silithus that would not have happened with flying. 
---
The PvP drawbacks are the obvious thing but it affected other things. It really shrunk the world, both visually and in the scope of possibilities. Much faster travel. Fewer opportunities for organic fun. Then I realized that it was just 260% (or whatever) speed swimming in mid-air in the sitting position. YMMV on how much that bothers you but it only felt like flying to me before that notion took root. 
---
There’s this word in the English language, and that word is, “compromise.” Sometimes it’s what needs to happen.
---
I'm mainly gonna get into the lore of warcraft but here are my thoughts: 
---
1. Stay true to what Warcraft established and don't follow the "rule of cool"(throwing characters away because it would of been a cool fight). I feel that the players should of fought along side and team up with the anti-villians the Illidari. Illidan/Akama would of been the connection for the Alliance and Kael'thas/Vashj would of been the connection for the horde. Both factions could have a portion in the black temple and they had to defend against Kil'jaedan.
---
2. No Naaru**.** Holy, being divine, made it mysterious and a far more interesting source of power. Leave it to our imagination where it would come from, no need to make magical space instruments.
---
3. Draenei shouldn't be so strongly connected to the light it makes them come off as goody 2 shoes and that is just boring for story. They should of been masters on a whole other level of the Arcane and portal magic and that's how they should of reached Azeroth **not** by spaceships.
---
4. Nigh elves and Draenei should of maintained a certain distance from Human,Dwarves and Gnomes and each other. Night elves should butt heads with Draenei and visa versa, Seeing themselves as superior to each other and all the other races. Night elves see Draenei as destructive and Draenei see Night elves as primitive people running from potential. Forsaken and Blood elves should have distance from the Orcs, Tauren and Troll. Don't purify the Sunwell it ruins the Blood elves and kind of just makes them High elves.
---
5. Not bringing back the Sons of Lothar. They made a sacrifice in Warcraft 2 no point in bringing them back only to have them laying around as useless characters. Besides it gives more meaning to the statues in SW knowing they made the ultimate sacrifice. I really dislike how blizzard is more than willing to kill off Horde characters but preserve Alliance characters at all cost. This is coming from mainly an Alliance player. It starts to become where so many heroes are alive they step on each others toes. Leaving no new characters a chance to grow or shine.
---
6. Continue making unique Villains. Vanilla wow brought in Ragnaros, Emperor Thaurissan, Hakkar, Onyxia, Neltharion, C'thun. The expansions just reused characters from the RTS's rarely coming up with a new villains.
---
7.  Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor are probably the greatest land masses for an MMO. They should of found a way to include outland but not render EK and Kali useless. They should of just had Outland be a smaller combination of hellfire peninsula with floating mushroom trees(as originally portrayed in WC2/3), Shadowmoon valley and a hidden area known as Nagrand(that a group of shaman actively keep afloat). Then open up several area in EK and Kali or add new questlines for max level players in the many locations to keep players visiting them. 
---
8. No Flying, it ruined the general feel of the game. World pvp took a heavy hit.
---
9. Items need to be valuable, important and special. Don't hand out epic items for no reason it devalues items. I love hunting down weapons or gear pieces in Vanilla even if higher tiers of raids were out. 
---
10. No Resilience gear. Not every game needs to be competitive Esports. Some games can just have fun imbalanced PvP.
---
11. Well thought out talent trees that require thinking to spec into.
---
I know alot of players don't care about the world and just want gameplay, but it sets the stage for the game. It has an impact on the players no matter how small. I honestly feel what ultimately drove people away from the current game is not only poor class design but also the completely botched story and poorly written direction for the current main characters. I know the way the story was handled in BC completely destroyed my immersion to the game. Gameplay and playing with friends was fine/ok depending on the xpac but i wasn't immersed with Warcraft the way I was with the vanilla iteration.
---
He's not talking about developing Classic further, but what from classic that can be reintroduced to retail.
---
Implying more than 5% of the people on this subreddit even stepped foot in raids
---
Still drops
---
I mean tbh, there’s several (ranged) dps classes that just light up telling you when to use them, I never played Vanilla but I can’t stand that system in retail that I’ve seen on multiple (ranged) dps classes.
---
What makes it useful for huhuran? The fact that the pets don't count towards your threat?
---
Thats not the part thats new
---
Not even hardcore guilds will care about race, they will care about performance.
---
4 strength 4 stam leather belt?
---
Yes
---
There is this exact same thread a few hours earlier in the feed. No reason to remake a currently discussed topic.
---
People were VERY stupid back in the day when it came to loot. The staff of shadowflame from BWL that drops off nefarian is the BIS caster weapon until AQ. If you go to wowhead comments everyone thought this staff was a healer weapon meanwhile the priest specific MC staff is way better and there are a ton of equal or better options for healers. Tier sets were another one and there are lots of different examples.
---
Seeing the same topics get discussed 500 times in a month.
---
First time in r/classicwow ?
---
PM’d you
---
Lmao and he took the staff of shadowflame. One of the best caster weapons in the game. Smh.
---
That is a valid point about mining, didn’t cross my mind.
---
So do you think skinning alone can make the gold for a mount? I know it depends on how many skins I have to sell, because my plan for now is spend an hour farming skins, sell them and then go on questing. I don’t know if this is a good approach.
---
Yea because BWL killed Vanilla back in the day and people massively started to unsubscribe and the game die...wait....wait...wait a minute!
---
I think the opposite is true. In my opinion, it'll give people more of a challenge. Not to forget that a lot of people won't be 60 before ZG hits
---
Old AV- sat near mid waiting for randoms to group up. Half of them are running around actually pvping. I want to die.
---
New AV- both sides rush to the boss shortcut. Only half your group makes it because autism, but the mobs don't hit as hard so atleast you don't need a raid tank to survive the run.
---
Neither of these are fun.
---
This is my currently planned specc for rogue leveling hemo. Progression would also be Assa --&gt; Sub --&gt; Combat
---
Since I am duo leveling with a druid, I do not need ghostly. Dirty Deads might be decent, but I could only think of taking those two points out of Deadliness.
---
I feel like this would also work sufficiently well for late game dungeons.
---
Doesn't mean the same topic within hours should get traction. Are you new to reddit?
---
I used to think what you're thinking back when I started playing on Nostalrius. It was even better than I remembered. Have faith man.
---
What is everyone's opinion about "special letters" in names? Are you concerned at all about seeing names like Đæmøn which weren't possible in Classic iirc?
---
I know you want to fight the good fight soldier, and I commend you for your bravery and ambition, but eventually you do what we all do. Give up.  
---
I'd argue those two races combined have less players than humans or nightelves. Their starting zone is also the fastest 1-10.
---
Been about a year. That count?
---
More of a circle jerk than a hive mind 
---
Working hard with a like-minded group of people to gain prestige and fame on the server AND the feeling of progressing and getting rewarded after putting in the time and effort.
---
There's nothing quite like your first Rag kill. Or Nefarion. Or Onyxia. It's a magical feeling that you never experienced in the other expansions. It was rewarding, sure, but it never felt quite as epic.
---
Is the rock cozy, the one you live under?
---
Before they announced BC nobody knew anything would reset inside wow. As far as we knew, that gear we spent months farming was gonna be relevant forever. This gave players a "security blanket" so to speak. They didn't mind investing time and effort because it wasn't going anywhere.
---
Then we switched to the expansion model. Suddenly every two years you're gonna throw everything you worked hard on out the window. This is stupid and offputting to a portion of people and you actually saw a group who quit in vanilla after BC got announced. Now the content was good and the two year cycle wasn't too bad. You still had a gap of time where the effort you put into your character meant something.
---
Fast forward to wrath and the introduction of multiple raid difficulties. This was the final nail in the coffin. Catch-up gear has always been in the game since vanilla. But it wasn't every major content patch that it got added. When they added ToC they killed ulduar. There was no reason to go in there. It was so bad they had to buff the legendary mace just to get people to still care about running it. This model of having content from one patch murder everything that came before is toxic and non sustainable. How many cycles can one player go through before they no longer care? That's the question and the game blizzard is playing. Something needs to fundamentally change about how blizz treats expansions.
---
I doubt they’ll do progressive questing. 
---
I have a 48 warrior and am leveling a warlock who is now 37. You're really underrating how slow of a slog a warrior is compared to warlock. The warlock can practically ALWAYS take 2-4 mobs his level or perhaps even higher. Warrior can almost never take 2+ mobs, the only times he can is when hes geared good for his level (WW axe right at lvl 30). There's no downtime at all with the warlock. 
---
They were definitely possible in vanilla.
---
Healing as a paladin is easy as you level in any spec you might have a problem early on when you don't have int gear at say deadmine you will only have mana for 6 heals and maybe you can regen mana for 1 or 2 extra heals this will stop being a problem ones you can get a int set. As for early levelling most of your damage comes from white hits so you can level in any spec. But it is a bitt faster/more optimal to level in ret 
---
This post still doesn't beat the "Release Date Info Hub" one. My god, what a f\*\*king dumb idea at this point in time.
---
OOOOOOOOAH, UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH, level 18?
---
 &gt;I would have shaved off approx 1 hr 30 min from my first run and basically that is an extra level staying ahead of the zerg.
---
Appreciate the effort put into this but using this method you won't be ahead of the zerg at any point. Experienced players who know the quests and routes are getting to 10 in 2 - 2.5 h on fresh servers without tryharding too much. You need that lead as early as possible and traveling around so much wastes way too much time. 
---
I'm sorry, I understand that you're a big name in the classic PvP community, but that's simply not true. Rogues are Druids' hard counter in 1v1, any Druid player would agree on that. **FinalFlash** aka **Fainaru Furasshu** himself said it several times under his Druid PvP videos in the comment section ; rogues are the hardest fight for Druids along with SPriests and Locks. He compared fighting rogues as a druid to cancer, if I remember well ...
---
If you're not in Bear form a rogue will kill you in a couple seconds. And if you're in bear form you won't outlast a rogue. Bash is 1 minute CD, and can be dodged, parried, resisted, the Trinket is nice but you can use it only once in 5 minutes, and if you're not feral and starting the fight in Bear form, chances are you won't even have when to use Faerie Fire until long into the fight, because you'll be too busy surviving to waste a global CD on that.
---
This is one of the best Vanilla Druid PvP player to have ever frapsed his gameplay, predating all the tricks you see from FinalFlash/StormX by a couple year (video made in Feenix times) :
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVymmQyFNVc&amp;t=294s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVymmQyFNVc&amp;t=294s)
---
At 14:42 he duels a good rogue. The druid's got R14 gear (got weapons), stacking stam and armor, plays the fight flawlessly and yet literally survives the first burst by pure RNG. By the way, this link was provided by **FinalFlash** under one of his vid to a guy asking him how to fight rogues as a Druid.
---
Druids aren't a known class, but it's good to break some stereotypes about them, even on Reddit.
---
prot war leveling was the shit in wtlk
---
&gt; What if Blizzard didnt “mess up” retail WoW 
---
What if a game was good? I don't know - maybe it would be good.
---
/thread?
---
[Dun Morogh](https://youtu.be/Zuw9DcsCQMY) is probably **the** quickest zone to hit 10.
---
Any class can still excel in PvP with PvE gear. Ranking is far from being a requirement to do well in every day PvP.
---
As far as reasons to rank, I’m not a spreadsheet guy but I’m fairly certain the r14 weapons are PvE BiS for Warriors &amp; Rogues until Naxx, but for PvP Dark Edge of Insanity from C’Thun is actually better than the r14 sword for Warriors.
---
The other classes generally don’t get much benefit from going past r13. A piece here and a piece there from the r12/r13 set are PvE BiS for a while for various classes. But most of the benefit of going r13 for PvP reasons is to be able to achieve similar offensive stats to BWL/AQ gear while having a larger health pool than if you were using purely raid gear.
---
Some of the PvP sets also have good set bonuses such as the reduced Blink cooldown for Mages with 3 piece r13.
---
Euron Greyjoy?

I hate him too! Hope he dies in season 8.

Unfortunately models and textures are not fully related to how cartoonesque animations are. It's more linked to exaggerated movements and facial expressions.
---
Even a real human actor can act in a cartoon-like way. Likewise, some actual cartoon are quite realistic.
---
ok my bad, thought they weren't because of pservers then

I guess not long enough to learn reposts annoy the community.

You may not believe it, but for the last... 3 years? I've always gone to sleep listening to this (and also Warcraft I OST).
---
this is gangsta
---
Well since just grinding mobs is literally the best way to level anyways (obviously part in kill quests), you should be good with your approach.
---
About the mount at 40 ... I gotta say, I never had problems getting my mount at 40 when I played on private servers. Have to take into consideration though, that loot value prolly are different from Blizz Classic as from private servers.
---
As long as you play it correctly, dont buy every spell or items in general and sell most of the stuff you find, you should be able to get mount at 40 or at least pretty shortly after.
---
Well this post sure isn't getting anymore traction because OP deleted it.
---
Could a gnome do it or is it too much physical work? How many gnomes would it take to have say 15 cattle on 10 acres?

which lasted through death? only rally cry?
---
o.O
---
They've said they're using 1.12 as a base, so altering the zones to what they were like in patch 1.5 would require more work, which I can't see them doing, as it's creating work to essentially make a zone worse, only for them to then change it down the line back to how they have it in the 1.12 code
---
I quit at the end of TBC but just right there, a big issue IMO was resilience. I was okay with PvP gear being good, but having PvE gear be unusable for the most part in PvP basically broke the game into 2 pieces. I played in guilds in vanilla that did PvE for the purpose of PvP (and both were decent guilds. First one was server/faction first level raiding, second one had a US first and world first before I joined and a few top 10s after). TBC comes out and that justification was just gone. I'm sure it contributed to the lack of motivation that slowed us down and eventually lead to us breaking up.
---
I have this bookmarked. Great job.
---
One thing I suggest is that you add the stats of the item to a mouseover window, like [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1622864778) page does. It's really nice and saves you having to click on everything.
---
Remember looking like a complete scrub until level 30?
---
Remember looking like a complete scrub with shitty shoulder pads and a helmet until you raided?
---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
true, and priest has no insta.. our first insta is a dot and that doesnt tag it immediately until the dmg kick its :(
---
for me personally, I feel my wand has won me more times vs casting a spell.
---
grande ita :)
---
Uh, yes? Your premise is tautological. "If a game is good, would you play it?" Well, yes. That's how we pick which games we want to play.
---
You should have constructed your post differently. Maybe: "If Blizzard never released an expansion and we would have had been playing Classic for 15 years, would you still play it today?"
---
Awesome content man. Your video on vanCleef is also great.
---
Hobbs is what made me want to roll a paladin. God those were good days

I see, well I am not questing in Goldshire at all. I do have 2 hidden grind spots that is away from most traffic in goldshire/abbey.

1 hour in, most people will still be fighting inside the abbey and 3-5man groups are probably in the mines or killing gnolls, bears, defias, wolves and murlocs.

Fill me in.  
---
When BC was in full swing I worked in a kitchen at night where my guild raided 30 minutes after my restaurant closed.
---
"We're gonna fuckin get outta here quick tonight, right boys?", I'd always say, handing someone a broom.
---
"TK or SSC tonight?", always a question from my coworkers.  They were always in the loop.
---
Fuck I miss that shit.
---
Thanks for elaborating! Would you say stam gear in ret spec will suffice as tanking as well till level 32+?
---
Lol, I hope I don't end up playing with someone of that attitude.
---
If anything if you wanna be good at both in same rais you spec 5/5 in hotw and get NS in resto, sacrificing feral buff.
---
Never had gold problems so it disgusts me to see how cheap can people go. If you wanna raid you farm your shit to raid properly, not just "wing it" every time.
---
Hi there, just wondering if the troll racial "berserking" which increases casting speed will affect channeled spells such as arcane missiles? thanks.
---
I really want Classic already as we all do hence being on this sub lmao, so much to the point where I'm considering private servers again. Should I start another character on a different server or will it burn me out for the actual classic release? Obviously understand people could have different views on this so I'd love to hear people's opinions
---
But that is not my question. Blizzard could release expansions and still keep the gameplay more like it was in vanilla. For example if they didnt add LFR and Group Finder, retail wow would have a much better community which is one of the big reasons people want to go back to vanilla. If that community would still be the same in BFA right now as it was in vanilla, a lot of people would maybe not want Classic so badly
---
The 25% stun resist.
---
Stuns are one of their biggest weakness in pvp and that racial helps a ton with it
---
Well in that case your question is downright dumb.
---
"What if Blizzard didn't iterate on their game and just kept it the same?" Then no one would buy it. You're really not making a lick of sense right now.
---
Gluth spawns zombies, zombies aggro C'thun and puppy pile.
---
C'thun casts Eye Beam.
---
RIP Doggo.
---
Yeah, I saw that Perplexity vid, and well ... it pretty much confirms my point. Perplexity fights an AQ geared full deep Feral Druid  (which is very rare in PvP, and is literally the best spec to fight against a rogue) with engineering who still almost died and went down to 5% HP when Perplexity caught him on a Kidney outside of Bear Form the first time. Then Perplexity caught him a second time and killed him under the Kidney.
---
And that's a fight in which the Druid landed his Bash and a lucky grenade, whithout which he would have gotten stomped way faster. And the Druid was Feral, geared, and skilled, while Perplexity didn't seem to overdo it. That's a lot of conditions. 
---
The druid still lost while having all chances on his side, but in normal settings, most of the time, a Druid would get massacred well faster than that by a rogue.
---
tell me master mage
---
is there a way to fit a build for both pve, aoe farm (dme lasher in particular) and pvp? basically a pvp build with shatter permachill and impblizzard
---
Yeah I dunno mate I just wouldn’t call it anything close to a hard counter. 9/10 times the Druids objective is to escape from the Rogue, not kill him, and that’s very doable even without consumes.
---
it won't burn you out, if anything you'll end up feeling like it's a pointless waste of time since it's coming out so soon.
---
I started playing a pserver in november, havent really touched it in a month or two lost interest due to how close we're getting to launch said meh
---
You're abosultely right. But I just precised that because we were talking about hard counters in 1v1. True that in WPvP and BG a Druid can simply run away. Cheers.
---
If you start it, make sure you pick a vanilla server, some people are rolling multiple chars to like level 40 on wotlk, but its not the same!
---
Just don't burn yourself out, accept that you wont play there anymore when classic is out and take it casually 
---
And if you still didnt decide class, some PS even have good PTR where you can test it all out.
---
Urgh that’s dreamy. So it’s a 6 round knockout?
---
But the only reason we don't have loot trading in 5mans and 4 content phases instead of 6 is because people complained.
---
Saying things will be alright skips the part where the community complains about things they don't like and Blizzard makes the game better so we have the best possible game in 6 months.
---
Is that...
---
They said they wont make any balance changes.
---
Dungeons are fine, it's raids that are the issue.
---
Yes, plenty can be done to a potential TBC to preserve Vanilla game design philosophy.
---
First one, no flying.
---
Second one, no lvl cap increase.
---
Third one (linked to second one) gear power creep much, much smaller.
---
And fourth one, raid size. Keep it to 40 and 20. It is better for the community.
---
These are the BIG ones.The problem is that even "smaller" things added in TBC are against Vanilla game design philosophy. Like DAILY quests. Like Resilience. Like a NEUTRAL city for both factions. Like sockets. Like new professions.
---
And lastly, but not the last...removal of Arena is crucial. Arena does not belong in a game where the community is extremely important. Arena does nothing good for the community. Arena PvPers (most of them) are simply refusing to interact in other activities, simply because they don't need to.
---
Thing is, people who played mainly in TBC and after, cannot understand that TBC was way bellow Vanilla, in game quality, class identity, faction identity, dungeon design and even raid design. Basically, because they did not played Vanilla, or if they did, they started way to late, and barely scratched the surface, they think that TBC is a "better" Vanilla.
---
It is not. It is worse.
---
Main reason I do not want a #nochange TBC after Classic.
---
depends on your class dude.
---
if you're a caster you're going to maybe want SFK but I never cared to do it but you really want to do BFD since it's guaranteed quest item is a wand which is the best dps in the game at that level and the best wand for 10+ levels.
---
If you're a warrior you wanna do deadmines for the axe or the hammer if you dont get the axe. Also if you're a warr you only want SM arm for the gear there. the rest of them are pretty meh 
---
idk I played undead rogue for most of vanilla.  The forsaken don't have emotions.
---
I just hope classic blows the current retail dev teams minds.
---
Ion has a big problem with thinking his ideas are -the best-, his way or the highway. 
---
Then again, I am just jaded. I am having more fun with my level 10 orc warrior in Trisfal Glades than I ever had on current retail.
---
#oldguyventing
---
And people are still complaining about the minor amount of loot trading we will get. They don’t see how blizzard listened and compromised without costing their company more money. 
---
Everybody will have something to complain about. Let’s just be happy the game is almost here. 
---
Awesome, thankyou! Keep up the great work mate!
---
&gt; Warriors on the other hand have a hard time in the first two raid tiers as their output is abysmal compared to other classes
---
Warriors are by far the highest dps class in MC and BWL, with rogues being a close second
---
Dont increase the max level.
---
Extremely easy, all EU guilds start their raids between 7 and 8 CET. Only thing that most doesnt finish before 11 so you might wanna add 30mins there.
---
Tfw when?
---
You dont understand what im saying. They could have released expansions without keeping it the same couldnt they? Or do you think that LFR and Group Finder HAD to be implemented into the game? Thats just an example. I think if they did not add LFR and Group Finder to the game the community would be much better in retail wow and a lot of people who quit the game right now would still be playing. That doesnt mean you can not release expansions
---
I mean if you look at current gaming trends gamers want harder games (dark souls, breath of the wild, sekiro) so reintroducing a game that is quite hard may actually bring in quite a lot of players to classic and that bump in difficulty might be brought to retail. So yeah it’ll probably shock the devs that we want a hard game that’s not a roller coaster you get on. I want greys to be relevant again damn it
---
You seem to miss his point completely 
---
Read his posts again 
---
Here's my simple question.
---
I'm playing an undead rogue Hemorrhage Subtlety app the way so do I want to aim for Weaponsmith for Phantom Blade again or should I go for Alchemy or Engineering. 
---
I really really liked having the Phantom Blade but I remember on that char there wasn't much else after that. Still preventing others from stealthing was a lot of fun.
---
And once the game is out, people will threaten to cancel their subscription while complaining, as is ancient tradition.
---
I don't have much experience playing Rogue, but I can tell you from personal experience on private PvP servers that PvP spec is almost always preferable.
---
You might kill mobs slightly faster with a PvE spec, but those gains are completely erased if you die a lot to other players.
---
Good point. The rank 12/13 armor set is made for Enhancement not Ele/Resto.
---
If they are going to cancel, they’ll cancel. Threats are just people stomping their feet and throwing tantrums. They’ll play the game or they won’t. 
---
/shrug. 
---
As is tradition.
---
BRING BACK PEGGLE ADDON!
---
There’s a ret in my guild. He has pretty great gear (much better than my fury warr), brings all his consumes and buffs, never complains or causes drama, always keeps his blessings up, rarely dies, not until the end of a wipe - everyone likes him. He’s good.
---
His DPS is crap, mind you, (I’ve easily doubled it on the suboptimally geared fury) but as long as the GM is cool with him being there, there’s no problem, and bosses die. A lot of classes never break top 5-10 dps anyway. A half-afk hunter can do shit damage, half of a fury’s, all night but no one says anything. This guy is often hovering around their level in DPS. If you’re bringing 1 more priest instead of a pally healer it’s really not bad to bring a ret to keep blessings up. 
---
Yes, I get a little annoyed when he wins a roll on something good for me (I remember being salty over flameguard gauntlets but I kept it to myself) but honestly loot is so scarce that I always get annoyed at losing a roll. 
---
It’s the GM’s decision at the end of the day, and if players want to bitch and whine because someone else is allowed to play their class in the raid, then they’re being immature. The bosses (at least up til AQ40, I haven’t done Naxx yet) don’t require 2019 theorycrafted levels of dps. If you have 30 people focused on mechanics you’ll succeed within 2 minutes either way. If anything, bringing all fury warriors for melee with optimal dps would just break the game. You just shit out too much damage.
---
Bruh I’ve been 60 for a month and still don’t have a full length cape
---
And music
---
Blizzard should have never significantly changed class mechanics.  Doing so eventually led to homogenization and the feeling that you are no longer playing the same character.  Revamping the mechanics each expansion is also responsible for the hamster wheel ride we have now with artifact power and then aserit or whatever.
---
Hemo first, that's how I leveled.  You'll do fine.
---
My older cousin was the one who got me into WoW he leveled with me   pvp'd with me farmed with me everything, we were a combo deal. he was far better at the game than me and would basically tell me what to attack, we would sit in the same room so we could plan things out instantly like having me sap something while he is charging up a heal so when I break stealth I don't instantly die, from the minute we logged in till the minute we logged off we had a plan and a goal, even if that goal was something crazy like lets sneak into org and look for that hunter from the other day we would somehow get it done through sheer stubbornness. 
---
We went on like that through BC, we were a genuine menace in arenas with me having mace spec and him having cyclone it was a great time it really was, we got in so much trouble for the amount of noise we produced between the hype and salt. unfortunately a few months before the release of wraith he got into an altercation that went very wrong, a few days later I logged onto an alt explained to the guild in a few sentences and uninstalled the game. 
---
I came back for BFA after avoiding WoW for so long, it was fun leveling again and I figured I would be ok then once I got tired of waiting on classic I decided to test the waters, rolled a nelf rogue lasted till I got to the top of the tree and found myself waiting for something. so rogue is a no go and I'm sure by the time I get to STV I am going to be a real mess but I'm looking forward too it. this time I'm gonna be the man with plan helping out all the noobs. 
---
420% dank speed mounts even more interestinger
---
If I could roll the time back...work at blockbuster with my friends...share a $600 rent payment with four people and play wow all night while eating junk food. I would be a very happy guy. 
---
Back in vanilla we knwe flasks were good, we just couldn't afford them regularly !
---
 Diplomacy is the key. So many big rep grinds in vanilla. In some cases diplomacy will save you doing a whole ZG or AQ20 run
---
&gt; Do we just want Classic because the majority of people think wow “sucks” atm?
---
&gt; Or is it really all about the nostalgia?
---
Is those the only 2 options?
---
How about we we want ro play Vanilla because Vanilla is one if the best and most fun games ever?
---
The nicest zone in all the land! + Sharpbeak!
---
True, great point. Though WotF isn't a bad pick either?
---
no sharding at endgame, u cray.
---
Enchanting is the biggest money sink in the game, I'd stay away from that.
---
Or level 1 now with heirlooms. All the excitement gone.
---
Druids push rank 13 for one major reason: Rank 13 armor lets you keep the 3 piece set bonus while using rocket boots. Without the rank 13 set you lose the speed bonus while wearing rocket boots which is big for flag runner. Rank 14 isn't pointless but the upgrades are small and the grind is soul crushing.
---
Warriors and Rogues typically want rank 14 for weapons.
---
Hunters can stop at 13. There are better weapons available from PvE.
---
Paladins and Shamans might as well stop at 11 unless they plan on PvPing as melee.
---
Warlock, Priest and Mage tend to stop at 13. You can always push 14 if you like but the weapons are basically minor upgrades or sidegrades depending on class.
---
Can agree, had characters with these. That was the reason why I learned the codes of those characters. 
---
Sfk. Get that and the robe for max caster glee.
---
If classic launches July 16th, I don’t want phase 1 to end until at least December. Phase 1 and 6 should be the longest imo. Give everyone time to get up to speed and get their shit sorted out at the start and at the end.
---
It's like a game of higher or lower. What will Blizz do next?
---
It is the easiest and best way to money as long as you dont train it...
---
You can disenchant everything from lvl 1 and the mats sell good
---
Also the first 2 wands are always in high demand.
---
Mats sell better than most greens the first 2 months and you are not competing against nodes.
---
I agree that you shouldnt train it further and only use it to disenchant.
---
ikr? its a trap
---
with a minor exception if u are in a tryhard guild and very lucky so u get the epic formula before anyone elses
---
Pre 60 it's not possible if you don't have a main that will supply you enough gold to buy your mats or you will need to farm way too much for it to be viable.
---
They designed the game so that the gear you can craft at your lvl is something like 10 lvl  lower than your lvl. I think the goal was to help the economy : you craft for lower lvl and you buy from higher lvl.
---
Unless you need some BOP crafting items or enjoy it, crafting is a loss of time.
---
The only info that people base this on are Plage( aka private) servers with a rage generation of 2.0.1 or similar that's way too high.
---
Just to remind you of the feedback for the demo during the last blizcon. 'that's way too much rage generation' and this statement confused the flip out of plague server players
---
Though honor where honor is due in MC they have fights with a good performance level, such are fights with a lot of raid damage in them, which in turn feed their rage starved early raid game  
---
It still BAD but its a reasonable compromise.
---
It's better than nothing, but only 3 classes can fear(one of them being a 3 min CD), while there are like 6-7 classes that can stun
---
yep
---
people that can solo bosses in ie maraudon, dmn, dme duos, rfd for gold can disenchant the items.
---
lv1 enchanting is very underrated
---
it also ha purpose if u  expect to do many 5/10man. ie as a tank then u offer ur services and in return any greedable bop is urs.
---
I disagree with no level cap increase. You would just have no levelling in a new expansion? That was so extremely fun to do though. Going through the dark portal the first time and into Hellfire was so great, and I can't wait to do it again.
---
Also I think Karazhan is one of the best, if not the best raid ever. I agree there should have been some 40 man raids, but one of the best design decisions in TBC was having Karazhan be a 10man raid to get new guilds into raiding and let everyone try it.
---
It seems like you just want to remove basically everything new and just have Vanilla 2.0. What's the point? No Outland? No JC? No sockets? Do you think anything was good at all?
---
Jewelcrafting was a great profession, sockets too. Did nothing to harm the game. Outland was a great place. Every zone in Outland was so well made.
---
Are you alliance? PvE server?
---
Many guilds now still require 18+, nothing has changed, it's mostly just a rule to keep the attitude of the guild as "mature" even if there are many 17 year olds and younger that can act far more mature than actual 30+ year olds.
---
* The absurdly timeconsuming mats grinding is only for naxx
---
* Loot felt a lot more meaningful. You also know what you get ( no bad random stats ) and where to get it.
---
* Only the Tier sets are poorly optimized and only in the very first raid and only for half the classes. If your class is one of them just roll for the non tier sets/weapons/rings/neck/trinket...
---
* Yes. Raids get a little more complex later on. The difficult part was managing 40 people.
---
* Mages used Frostbolt, Blizzard, Decurse, Arcane Power, Polymorph, Teleport, Evocation,... If your question was if they have a fancy dps rotation then no they dont.
---
What we saw was the ultimate social "second life" you can imagine.
---
Raiding is not the focal point of the game, its a bonus.
---
I probably spent a lot more time in Ironforge beside the bridge just using the game as a chat then in a dungeon.
---
Later on I played Age of Conan where the only Tier upgrade you can get for months or years was a different color pants and 2 more buttons on your chest piece.
---
Does sound horrible but it was amazing because of my guild.
---
Retail does not allow you to have these social Servers that feel like a neighborhood with sharding, connected servers, lfg tools etc.
---
As Kungen said in his video, in Vanilla we knew every single max level player on your server. By the first addon he interacted with the 25 people he raided with.
---
Tldr: Raiding in Vanilla is a fun social gathering event you do with your guild.
---
If you want to experience more complex boss mechanics/dps rotations with mostly strangers, then retail is for you.
---
are the craftable u need bop? if boe then u dont need crafting.
---
pay a guildie or whoever to craft
---
Everything is pointless without a baseline of casuals to admire, and be shit on in PvP, by the hardcore players
---
Yeah, I really loved the wod music. Especially shadowmoon valley.
---
Depends on what you want to do.  
---
* If you want to get to 60 in the most eficient way.  
---
Go Combat. The people running dps tests on target dummies are hilarious. They have no idea how hit rating works against targets at different levels, because apparantly you only fight targets at your level while you're leveling. Furthermore there's 0 hitrating on gear early on so the 5% you get from Combat is priceless.  
---
On top of that going Combat doesn't mean that you're useless in pvp. You're quite strong with imp sprint, endurance and the dps talents. Sure, your stealth sucks and you cant prep, so if you're caught without CDs you'll probably die, however thats going to be a rare occurance and the time you'll spend corpse running wont come close to the time you'll save while questing.  
---
* If you want to stay ot lower levels just to pvp.  
---
Go hemo.
---
How hard of a grind is 11? What is the previous stop for rouges before 14? Is it 13? 11?
---
So, I am a huge Alterac Valley fan and if I want to casually PvP on Weekends, this would be my go to BG. 
---
I was heavily focusing on playing Druid, but it seems like they much more excel in 1vs1 WPvP.
---
Feels like right now the Shaman and the Priest would be the better "Healers" for me, if I want to play exclusively AV.
---
Did I get that correct? 
---
One element I liked about what TBC added to Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor were the additional quests scattered about throughout the leveling zones, mostly by draenei or blood elf questgivers if I recall.
---
Maybe we should have gotten some max level questlines that took part in EK and Kalimdor as well.
---
Engi is only prof that actually stands out in vanilla, most hc guilds will require it from raiders, and its awesome in pvp.
---
BS is a nice 2nd option if you dont want gathering prof since number of BS on server will prolly be low. 
---
You will probably have guild alchemist that will be handed all rare recipes aswell.
---
This post is awesome!
---
I was in High School during retail vanilla and I remember every Friday or Saturday grabbing a couple bucks in change and riding my bike to the closest gas station. 
---
I would buy a Full Throttle energy drink along with some swedish fish if I could and I’d use that fuel to run dungeons to the wee hours of the morning with my best buddy Matt. Who I haven’t talked to in years, hope you are doing well bud. 
---
It depends on faction balance, how competitive the servers is and how many active PvPers there are but it's safe to assume that you can grind rank 11 solo. Premading is always more efficient so if you premaded for ranks you'd progress faster.
---
Rank 11 ought to be about 8 hours a day for 2 months, if you solo queue. The same grind takes about 5-6 weeks if premading.
---
The rewards for Rogues are great all the way up. You can stop at 11, but both the gear from 12 and 13 is great for PvP. No other gear has as much stamina as PvP gear does.
---
18+ almost certainly, it’s still a common requirement on retail, but I don’t see why it would go any further than that.
---
It’s also not hard to just lie about your age, unless your balls ain’t dropped yet nobody is going to know.
---
Considering that the world record is just barely under 5 days, it's a bit exaggerated to say 4-5 for hardcore players, more like 4,5-5 for world record challengers, and 5-8 for hardcore players (depending on class).
---
Ret will suffice tanking all the way to 60, same with healing.
---
You should check out the Barrens.chat speed leveling thread, they have about 7 pages of content from people that enjoy this kind of data!
---
The draenei shouldn't even be in the game
---
Tanking in Wrath was so dull compared to vanilla and tbc though, especially for warriors. Suddenly every tank is an aoe ability spammer and none of the finesse that was needed before was gone - this also goes hand-in-hand with how five-mans got easier in general. Was the beginning of the end mechanic-wise imo
---
But you were playing an entire mmo in like 6 zones not 50
---
I was a level 52 druid when pvp patch came out... It was horrible to get farmed by all bored 60 at the time before BG ,etc. So , pvp patch without BG and no DHK is quite tough , and was the actual pure vanilla experience but it was not fun at all if you were not the ganker. So depending on which side of the fence you were at that time , you'll have a different opinion on the matter. (Prey or Hunter)
---
Oh poor Wyrmthalak, doesn’t know what he got himself into.
---
Can we get an f for our Overlord
---
&gt; A huge amount of grinding in terms of attunement, grinding mats, resist gear, etc
---
This is fun
---
&gt;Only 2 pieces of gear drop per boss (?) meaning that you're lucky to get 1 'upgrade' (more on this next) per boss
---
That's fun and feels rewarding
---
&gt; The gear that dropped wasn't even good, with most of it being poorly optimised... so all that effort grinding for gear that isn't even going to be an upgrade?
---
This is fun. It makes the rare really good loot ao much more fun to get.
---
&gt; The mechanics of encounters were quite simplistic, especially in MC
---
The hard part is really to create a community with 40-50 players to raid together. Thats fun.
---
&gt; Some classes (e.g. mage) literally only spam a single spell (frostbolt) for the entire raid
---
Not evdrything was perfect in Vanilla. No question about that. The rotation of a class in a raid that only last 2-3h/week is such a tiny tiny part of the overall excperience in Vanilla.
---
Drink Mtn Dew until the type 2 diabetes sets in
---
This is just theorizing about the expansion quality and failing into account that WoW was just becoming [i]an old game[/i]. Of course eventually quitting players are not replaced anymore by fresh blood. Why would 'fresh blood' starting playing a game with 2005 graphics and gameplay in 2013? 
---
Also, returning players came back, saw the game isn't what they were used to and left again. Has nothing to do with quality, just with the gameplay they were used to. 
---
Your last paragraph I agree with: multiple factors to blame here. However, I think that the natural flow of an mmorpg is by far the biggest reason: People quitting and not being replaced. Even when MoP would have been the greatest expansion ever, you would have seen the same effect.
---
This is pretty much exactly what I think they should've done. Although I would allow Blood Elves to be playable once you're exalted and completed the raid and got the final boss drop that let's you roll Blood Elf. So like Eye of C'thun or KT's Phylactery. They can't be paladins or shamans though
---
- Remove flying mounts
---
- No LFG
---
- No daily quests*
---
- Keep the rarity of epic items
---
- Don't release Panda
---
- Remove a lot of ease of access mechanics**
---
- Sharding, shared servers, shared auction house, server battlegrounds***
---
* No daily quests. No weekly quests. Nothing of that. Those became a chore instead of a goal. In vanilla, there were either huge ass chain quests in order to achieve your goal, or one specific hard quest, or grinding reputation with a faction. I never had the feeling of doing chores when playing vanilla
---
**Ease of access mechanics include city portals everywhere, looking for group dungeon tool, removal of items like poison ingredients for rogues, arrows for hunters, ankh stones for shaman, etc. Anything that makes your life "easier" ruined the game
---
*** One server. One auction house. One battleground. Having shared server mechanics meant that there were no community being formed. I loved recognizing other players, friends or foes, and always having a memorable interaction with him. Like meeting an opposing faction member, that instead of ganking you, helped you. Also lets not forget the infamous 'Kill on Sight' macros
---
So you mean Bloodelves for both factions?
---
Fuck loot sharing
---
Every phase - 1 year:\]
---
I want fun play for few years and every phase will be coll in some way. I know this is impossible and phases will be shorter (majority of players thinks like 6 month is too long) but this is only my opinion.
---
I don't think arena itself was the problem. Balancing PvP around small scale arena battle was. It should've just been a fun, free for all thing with no attempt to balance around it.
---
&gt; Many guilds now still require 18+, nothing has changed
---
but, neither on private servers, not on retail, I wasn't seeing that constant "18+" spam. Maybe one or two guilds, but not like entire server. Or maybe it was just the server I played on during vanilla?
---
&gt; it's mostly just a rule to keep the attitude of the guild as "mature" even if there are many 17 year olds and younger
---
I know, I have always known that. But, the thing was that "how old are you" was the first question, and if I said anything below 18, they were generally rejecting without any further questions. One guild put me into some special trial group, and said that 18+ skip that trial and join as full members.
---
Still, there was one guy I knew, he was 16 years old, and said his guild is quite good and I should join. When I messaged the leader, he said I cannot join because the guild is 18+.
---
My way of thinking was that they were 18+ guilds lead by a fresh 18 with 12 mentality. Just like ilevel 950+ groups with ilevel 920 leader that wants to be carried.
---
Another thing worthy of mentioning, all groups in the server were for hyjal and gruul, and if I tried to join any, I couldn't because I was too undergeared, and got recommended to gear up on heroics. But, after several months of always watching the chat, and joining any group for heroics, I managed to get... 2 items from loot, and 2 for badges. I was still undergeared for hyjal, and only WotLK release saved me.
---
But, my gametime expired on 3.0.9, and when I returned on 3.3.5, there was again 2.4k+ gs required for heroic ICC, and 2.2k+ for normal. And I had like 1.2k. Got to 1.8k with battlegrounds, then got lucky to join some older raids, and got to 2k, then I found out that attack power increases GearScore for warlocks - and started to cheat with AP enchants, which were a lot cheaper. That's how I gained bad reputation on entire server, and was forced to reroll on RP server on patch 4.0.1.
---
College dorm. Blazing down hash. Blue slushies and tacos. 
---
Yea. Both faction can prove themselves and win the trust. It's not like everyone and his dog is gonna kill KJ (or whoever the final boss is) and get the drop. So it would be a rare thing anyway
---
We pay we gay!
---
I'd say it's more about mental age or maturity levels, i've raided with 12-year-olds that were more mature than some 30-year-olds who was throwing a tantrum over loot he "deserved" but didn't get.          
---
Not that many guild are actually gonna care if you're younger or older than 18, as long as you act like a mature normal person.       
---
18 is just the globally expected "no longer a whiny child"-age.
---
Did you also have chronic diarrhea? 
---
I think the only way to make it really relevant is to make it available on release which I personally would be fine for me.
---
&gt; 30-year-olds who was throwing a tantrum over loot he "deserved" but didn't get
---
I remember some 30-year-old making stupid humor about viagra and semen and anal [Disconnected from server], and when I said "guess I'm the oldest here", they said I'm the youngest, and that I'm probably gay if I don't watch porno 24/7

---
Might be worth considering that you maby won’t be able to buy/trade for a wand if you start right when the servers go live and are at the front of the pack. Leveling time to 10-12 could very well be so quick that easy accessible wands wont be there.
---
How are you getting the wand? I’m assuming you’re going skinning and LW based on what you wrote, with the intention of getting Tailoring for bags soon.
---
There's plenty of valid reasons why you would want more mature people in your guild.
---
What if, while they are giving us classic, they are also working on vanilla 2.0, with a whole new world, instances, tweaked classes and new quests - basically out with the old, in with the new.
---
Except, they do it on the same principles that made classic great.
---
Expansions could, hear me out, EXPAND on the game, instead of simply obsoleting all prior content
---
Yes... but no...  
---
If you have imp life tap they're better, you get even more return, and making them between mob / quests is rlly not that much of a hardship. Plus then you always have one for the inevitable gank.  
---
 Personlly i make then whenever my mana pool allows,  so on easy fights make one / between quests make one. Then when things as are more intense you can pop it for insta hp / mana. I find i rlly dont need them on cd
---
I got a ring in Der last night!
---
In some ways I agree its more fitting alongside the release of the world dragons and ZG.  Raiders are getting plenty of new content here, PVP will likely be already under way and this would not only give something for the more solo and casual players to work on.  
---
The addition of ZG has FAR more impact on raid progression than the tier 0.5 items.  There are a few odd pieces that would be on a par with some MC loot and not far behind some ZG items so this literally 3-4 pieces across all classes. 
---
You need to also think that in terms of time/reward  they are a LARGE time investment, and a large gold sink.  There will be comparable pvp gear available for a similar time investment and keeps the 5/10 man dungeon crawl scene lively for longer.
---
Thats just my personal opinion based on playing retail and private realms.  Having it available too early would be a mistake, but having it in phase 5 I think is possibly a bit late in terms of other progression and content.
---
Lost one of best friends, 12 years ago now, the guy who got me into WoW... Had an aneurism out of nowhere, and then he was gone. Still tough, he was a tauren sham named Jhreak on Natherziem server (in vanilla) 
---
Server list. So I can gather all my 50+ friends and coordinate which server we should all play on (faction does not matter)
---
&gt; more mature
---
idk, in my country there is a special institution that gives people "maturity certificates". And, it has nothing to do with age, it just requires a certain level of education, and passing an exam.
---
I agree with this. Though some sets were extremely OP
---
Fentanyl is fucking horrible man... I've lost a really good friend to that stupid shit too
---
Is Wailing Caverns worth doing as an Alliance. The run to the dungeon seems too long and I don't have an idea if the quests and loot are going to compensate for the long run.
---
I'm on some of the biggest RP-PVP groups on discord and the consensus is that a RP-PVP realms don't exist, the guilds will all band together and join the same PVP server and make it an unofficial RP-PVP server.
---
But that's still not really a fix to the issue. 
---
because your memory is better than mine ? or what? give proof please. ( not saying I couldn't be wrong but i'd love to be proven wrong with facts instead of opinions).
---
Its not these sets themselves that are the problem (maybe the rogue 4 piece is the exception) but rather the summonable bosses that become available with this update. The loot from these bosses can rival AQ40 and Naxx gear and that is the major problem.
---
proof?
---
Or have flying mounts be slower than ground, so you have the potential for air content and such, but people will use ground mounts for the most part to get around.
---
The amount of stories like this amaze me, and make me happy. While I don't have a "ritual" per se, the fact that (like myself) so many people have this almost inexplicable connection to this game is awesome to see. My wife thinks I am weird for my connection to the game, but clearly there are thousands of us. 
---
&gt; Speculating at this point doesn’t make any sense
---
People need to submit their vacation time requests very soon, so it's reasonable to speculate to have the highest chance of not having to work during release week.

---
I joined a guild that was 18+ once. They still let kids in, just as long as they proved they were mature enough and had the right mindset.
---
And how many zones were you playing in at 60 during classic? 
---
I never denied that betas are used to develop addons m80. I’m well aware of how addon development has worked in the live game. It’s obviously in blizz’s best interest to have people’s addons up to date with every update as it would just be annoying to have to wait for updates. My point was: Do they have any incentive to help people have new addons ready for their game? Addons that will likely undermine much of what people like about vanilla? No, they don’t.
---
But I’m sure you’ll misread my reply and start telling me stuff I already know again lol

Don't bring loot reserving to classic keep that shit to private servers.
---
Don't want someone rolling on your gear? then bring only clothies.
---
Want that Flask pattern ? Do it with the guild group and split the coin or do it with the sole intention of getting it to help the guild.
---
I love the old Orgrimmar drumming with the wolves howling. It's really tribal and Orcish. I guess I associate it with Thrall these days.
---
Which discord group is that? Would love to join. :) 
---
There is no bragging. It is to show that there are other options.  Lark asked to see my list, so I gave another option. 
---
Yeah, partially for maturity's sake, but also just because of adult/minor dynamics and laws around the world. Now, I think that the majority of those guilds back when I played didn't really care as long as you didn't sound like a kid, acted mature and generally didn't make things awkward for the guild.
---
Easy reasons why people might not want minors around - lewd/adult humour, drinking games, socialising around adult life (e.g. work, family, politics) and, especially in the current day, avoiding generational culture gaps (meme culture, primarily). RP guilds frequently also have a good reason to exclude minors.
---
Nope. Flying is still godmode regardless of speed.
---
On the last 30% she'll start bombing the dirty 15 a lot more and the odds are that one of them will die. Using the whistle or peasant caller means more targets can be hit by the poison nova and they can soak some of the damage. If everyone of the 15 melee soakers has the trinkets, the targets suddenly grows from 15 to 45 or 60 with the peasant caller. So it's quite useful for the last phase if your gear isn't that great. 
---
I think its a combination of nostalgia and the game play. I know it is for me, anyway. In terms of inside the game, I quit retail a few months ago and I dont miss it. I dont feel connected to the world anymore. I dont know why, exactly. But like Kul Tiras, I have been wating forever to finally get to that place! And when I actually set foot on it, it was one of the best looking areas I'd ever seen ingame. And after a hours in the zone, maxing out at 120, it hit me that I didnt care. I didnt care about the zone, or the quests, and I could only remember a handful of them anyway. Flash back to Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath...I can rattle of tons of quests from those expansions. I'm just not sure if its me thats changed, or the game. Considering how pumped I am for Classic though, it seems like its the game at least to some degree.
---
you go combat/assa at first, and at lvl30 you respec to hemo.  (early repecs are cheap don't worry aobut that)
---
going sub tree straight up is quite pointless, and weakens you early levels. 
---
also you able to perform kidney shot only from lvl30 aswell. 
---
so thats from where you can actually start stunlocking. so hemo is better cos its a cheaper combo point generator. and all the sub talent start to play out more. before 30 you cant reach hemo in the tree and don't have kidney so just go pick strongest talents in first tiers of combat and assassination, that boost you right now, knowing you'll respec later.
---
Adding space-cows really ruined the immersion for me. They were a bit too wacky.
---
&gt; didn't really care as long as you didn't sound like a kid, acted mature and generally didn't make things awkward for the guild
---
is lying about age considered "mature"?
---
Today it's maybe different, but back then it was a strict requirement, and the first question was "how old are you" - if below 18, they wouldn't even let me to the interview. There was only one guild that would let for "trial period".
---
I actually jumped on a private server for the 1st time last year. Just to verify if I was wearing those glasses and didn’t know what I really wanted or if my memory of the game in that era was correct. 
---
I found my memory very real and had a blast just trying to kill stuff to reach the next level. The slower pace and relaxing atmosphere just hit me full on and I loved every minute of it.
---
Haven’t played again as I’m really looking forward to that time again when this launches.
---
I remember I once joined a guild that was not 18+, and then turned 18+ while I wasn't still 18.
---
But I left it because one guy was a well-known ninjalooter, and nobody wanted to kick him, because that was the GM's brother or something.
---
Because it's a valid argument. Activision is renowned for focusing max profits over customer satisfaction and game design quality. 
---
Adds 4 armor gotta wear that bag...

Gosh I cannot wait for Classic !!

---
If you're trying to level quickly then I would say no. If you're taking a more chill approach to levelling then it's probably worth a trip out there just for the wacky hijinks you might get into. Might have trouble finding a group for it although there is so good leather in there.
---
"Cartoonesque"
---
"Cartoon-like"
---
These are all pretty damn subjective.
---
Yeah no one is caring about your education in wow. 
---
And the end of the day all guilds want is someone reliable, not at the whims of their parents, at the right skill level, and will fit in socially with everyone. I lot of language will be mature which no one really wants to subject kids to.
---
I'm generalizing obviously. Heaps of kids rock and heaps of adults suck.
---
I am arguing in good faith, and the use of "but" renders your enjoyment of grinding irrelevant since it doesn't apply to our topic, PvP. However, if you're done, you're done.
---
Time will tell the version of AV we get for Classic one way or another.
---
Nature potion and gear if I do recall!
---
That's the spirit!
---
This guide is truly excellent, good work man it's going to be a lot of help, I keep sharing it with friends and people interested in Classic and they are equally as impressed. 
---
Personally, literally all of them, because I felt inclined to explore all the different zones due to the immersion. Even if I was higher level.
---
After flying mounts that immersion was gone.
---
Yes! I like my greys. It makes that first +1 stam mail piece mean something. 
---
You do you, man. This is just to demonstrate that there are other options. 
---
Paladin
---
The sets would have made more sense to add *before* ZG. 
---
100% agree. Plus if I ever saw someone in a BG that had impressive gear, I would know that they were an avid adventurer who attain their gear from fighting some epic dragon somewhere.
---
*laughs in rogue*
---
Ya, the shitty ones
---
Old AV was made of an old player base that has either died or evolved with retail. I don't want the old AV exactly as it was either. I'd rather not have to deal with those enhancement shamans who would just rush in and instantly die every 30 seconds. I'm fine not knowing why there always were so many of them, I'm very fine with this memory remaining a mystery actually...
---
As a GM I don't really care or ask about the age, I find it very weird to do that. If people are going to be retarded, they're going to get kicked either way. From my perspective, there's really no difference between someone saying "I have to go, my mom wants me in bed" and "I need to go, my wife wants me in bed", or saying "afk 20 minutes, gotta do dishes" instead of "afk 20 minutes, gotta change diapers". I don't think being more "mature" necessarily means you're going to be more active, more polite, and so forth. 
---
"Tied to the above point: continue to require players to farm old mats. Dreamfoil, Black Lotus, etc. should still have been required in recipes and the old metals and cloths for crafting. All of this at a reduced quantity so that Outlands stuff is primary but they should have asked for some old mats. Maybe a new faction is curious to try some of those old-world foods. This reminds players where the true roots are."
---
This. I have always thought that the way to keep the old world alive is by making a good reason to go back to it. Crafting mats is a great way to do that. While it could increase competition and raise prices, it could also provide an early good stream for lowbies who spend more time in the zones, and should see more nodes.
---
Arms/fury. I'll focus on pvp if I can't snag a dps spot in a raiding guild, but if I do find a dedicated slot I'll focus on that.
---
Because all that matters is how you parse, eh?
---
I don't mind the current release schedule in regards to t0.5. As you said, the mats and gold required is a huge endeavour, in addition to getting your full t0 set to begin with. Those two combined are enough for me to last a long time, being the casual that I am.
---
&gt; Ouland should NOT EVEN EXIST. There is plenty of space in Azeroth for an expansion.
---
This this this this.
---
I'm in the same boat, I genuinely dont know if my excitement is for the game or nostalgia. I think its a combo of both. I always felt very connected to old Azeroth because it felt like I was part of it, not just passing through, and I am hoping that that feeling comes back!
---

I wanted to know, so I googled and found this. The first fears he runs away, but at 1:55 he runs towards the warlock. Not directly through, but next to him, meaning he's not running away from the warlock.
---
I know that this was a BC video, but there are no sources of it changing. Will keep looking for a vanilla video though.
---
Could you give some examples please? I remember some GOOD items they dropped like this staff, but nothing exceeding BWL power levels.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22335/lord-valthalaks-staff-of-command#comments
---
do you happen to know of a place the drops from the bosses themselves can be found? 
---
I couldn't wait anymore, so I started playing on a 1.12.1 pserver yesterday and the first thing I did was figure out which addons I'll want to run, like DPSMate or X-Perl. I also picked a nelf hunter to relive my first days again, as I know I'll be a human priest when the official classic launches. Amazing experience, am lvl 12 right now after 7 hours played and if anything this excites me even more for summer.
---
raptor strike does good dmg, so in fights where you have to melee, switch to HOJ(im thinking more of 5mans then raid).
---
a nightfall hunter in raid can also use HOJ. 
---
if you are a friendly dps to your tank and healer(help out group quest, because you will lvl faster than me). gets you in my friends list and we can farm everything you want at 60.
---
No changes people are as idiotic as the “wall of no” posters.  They flip out about perceived changes like the warlock pets, but then roll back their hash tag when it comes to AV.  
---
Horde pvp (rp-pvp if possible) 
---
The Naxx patch was definitely pretty late to release the T.5 sets, given their power level.
---
The main obstacle here is if Blizzard is willing to change progressive itemization ordering from what it was in vanilla for this they might open up a can of worms.
---
There are quite a few, but this is probably the best starting point:
---
https://discord.gg/uEWEdyX
---
Try out a private server for yourself and see if you still feel that way. Yes, it is a brutally harsh experience depending on what and where, but that is part of what makes it such an engaging experience. I finally did the very thing myself and am currently level 14 on a warrior. In 2 days of playing vanilla on the private server, i have had more player interaction than months and months of retail. People randomly help you when you pull to many mobs, buff and heal you up, trade you items (in the first kobold mine below goldshire, some1 traded me a +5 dmg mace white item. Nothing by retail standards, but it made a noticeable difference in vanilla). I got invited to a guild of other lowbies when doing a quest, and one of them send me a chest piece from their blacksmithing. A random person was giving out free enchants in westfall, on and on it goes - not to mention that people actually act like people, knowing that bad behavior will only get you a negative rep, which really mattered back then. 
---
For a long time i thought a lot of my vanilla enjoyment was nostalgia, but i honestly find i enjoy this private server more than the last 3-4+ expansions combined. An actual world, with an engaging community and a genuine RPG experience - one where a player is an adventurer, not the 'Champion!', and part of a dynamic experience. That's what we should want from classic. 
---
11 is a bit late for me as I wake up early and my dumb brain needs to sleep.
---
But thanks. I'm a bit reassured. 
---
You will melt faces as a Shadow Priest in PvP.
---
They should have added a vanilla server right then, and kept one going for posterity, the idea being to preserve content because MMOs have a history of changing themselves to the point of being unrecognizable.  
---
You can also do the quest to save money and just buy a normal mount afterwards right? Since the expensive part is the training you would still end up saving money? (Im a cheap-ass if it wasnt obvious)
---
It's hard for people who never played it to fully comprehend how significant this game was in many people's lives for a whole variety of reasons. Especially those who played it during their later school years with friends when we all had an abundance of time off. And the fact that it's a 'game' carries almost negative connotations. But we all know it's more than that, but trying to explain it is a different matter.
---
These sets are awesome, as well as the quest chains. For them not to be irrelevant, I would argue they definitely have to be released sooner than it is planned now.
---
Before/at the same time as ZG would be ideal.
---
Yup, and there's nothing you can do about it, racists can get fucked :D
---
DM isn't in release, and the post says DM was part of the quests for it, so it would at least need to be the same time or later than DM.
---
I dont understand how people could hate flying this much. Now, 12 years later yeah flying leaves a bad taste to the game. But back then it was a new exciting feature and gave you very goos locked content ontop and u felt special going to places like arcatraz when u first got your mount. And epic flying was probably the most satisfying goal in wow history. There was still enough open pvp because the continent was way smaller, u had to gather at tp which lead to pvp action and halaa was an amazing open world battleground. I your server was shit then yeah, battlegrounds are your only option. It gets way too much hate nowadays.
---
WHAT IF CLASSIC CAME OUT NOW SO WE ALL COULD STFU AND PLAY
---
I replied earlier with a post from BC, but I found a vanilla video with fear running through the warlock now and I'm not sure my edit gives a notification so I'm replying to this post as well (sorry for spamming):  
---
[https://youtu.be/NZIg4OZlA-4?t=442](https://youtu.be/NZIg4OZlA-4?t=442)
---
Those sets aren't coming till phase 5? That is very late, i thought they'd be 1-2. That is perhaps one change i would not mind.
---
Still waiting for the source please
---
I think they could come out at the same time as ZG 
---
I didn't say we couldn't afford anything but food I said that because we were 4 waying cheap rent we COULD afford to eat fast food constantly :b
---
You are right...except the PvE part.
---
It was removed very early in Vanilla.
---
And it will not exist in Classic.
---
I didn't have a ritual per se, but me and a bunch of friends in secondary school (yeah, UK here) all played it religiously. Since we were all mid teens and had so much holiday time we'd be on it constantly. I know during the holidays I'd be on it from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to sleep, and would even pull a few sickies to get out of class to get back to play it. Which was bad in hindsight, but whatever. Sometimes we'd organise LAN parties and order Chinese and Pizza and queue up for BG's together and wreck it all night. Good times.
---
Like maybe on a separet map, maybe even on a new planet! And they can finally let us use flying mounts!
---
If you’re going kitty feral then agi/stam. Google Taladrils list of druid gear.
---
I came along as a fill for a raid when I was high school, got along well with people, invited to the guild, didn't find out it was 18+ until I saw the Guild Master advertising a few weeks later. Asked about it, the response I got was "if you're mature enough that everyone assumed you were an adult, that's good enough for me."
---
This is exactly it. TBC began a routine of erasing all old content and playing a new game on an entirely new location. Having a crusade to Outlands is cool, but the mistake was erasing all ties to Azeroth. Adding new mats is cool, but it should have been to supplement old ones. The new city was a big mistake though.
---
I miss the slower combat, where white dmg was your main source of damage. Also, larger aggro radius and harder hitting mobs.
---
WoW was never a difficult game per se, but it was a lot harder at one point. You feared pulling more than 2 mobs (because you were almost certainly dead if you did*), and it made you a better player. You had to group with people in the same area to take down elites. Sometimes, you did it to finish the quests faster or because mine density was a bit whacky.
---
*Unless you were a certain class/spec, or not a bad player like I was at the time
---
For me it’s not really nostalgia. I bought WoW, enjoyed that game, and they took it away piece by piece until Cata sealed in its destruction. My favorite areas were in the original Azeroth, I was the type to just keep leveling new characters. I didn’t really care about raiding, didn’t care much for PVP but did have fun with it here and there, I just liked going through the zones leveling, meeting random people, finding out about rare items and eventually obtaining them, things like that.
---
Basically I’m just waiting to get the game I purchased back. 
---
I'm fine with it being later and closer to when it actually came out.
---
Not having them will make early raids more challenging, but it will be like it was when people originally had to clear them, we are already going to have so many advantages over players in 2004, I don't think we need what is essentially catch up gear.
---
&gt;free weekends
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
God damnit, I hope this NEVER happens to my future guild. Gathering world buff, consumables, and then being slaughtered like that must be so frustrating :(
---
You want enchanting to 265 for the trinket, Smoking Heart of the Mountain. Once you craft that you are good to go, and can drop enchanting for something else. But that trinket is like bis forever if you're gonna be using bear form.
---
I was confused when you said that, then I checked. Wow. Didn't this sub hit 10k like two months ago? Time flies.
---
It can't come out on release if the quests require DM.
---
I personally would not want them to change the quests just to speed these pieces coming out. However, I'd be happy with it getting released as early as the quests allow.
---
I skipped it last time since I was already geared past there, I fully expect to be geared past there again, but maybe do it for entertainment.
---
Well all my guilds started between 7:30 and 8, with duration of 3.5h
---
Bear in mind in early game (pre aq40) most guilds will end raids earlier since content isnt hard.
---
Maybe you can find guild that does bwl on one day and mc+ony on other to make sure its less than 3h every time (rather than clearing all 3 in same evening).
---
You say all that as a criticism, but to me its a strength. A BG that doesn't have a fast or simple end is an amazing thing imo, unique and fresh.
---
As 3rd wheel says, if your playing to win - which is the dominant mentality to be sure, especially these days - then yes i understand your criticism, but i honestly equate it to people who want simple good vs bad stories and those who want something more nuanced.
---
Nothing wrong with a BG that don't follow the same formula as the 20 others.
---
maybe... though lore wise they make sense since the eredar have been there since the sundering and they were in warcraft 3.. but you only saw them as a race of evil demons but upon doing their back story you learn they are essentially a highly advanced technical race but same fate as the orcs.. some went crazy evil (the ones in wc3 like archemond) and the good ones who wanted to stay behind and didn't drink the blood.. only more genecide and having to flee for their lives and live in hiding.
---
though in a world with man-cows and undead.. it's not really too far fetched. 
---
Winterspring Frostsaber
---
I'm just glad that this time, I won't have my T0 disenchanted or sold by the time T0.5 comes. I always wanted to complete it because it's just an awesome thing to do, but it's not worth it getting eight items again *and* do that quest chain.
---
Couldn't care less about the stats though. This is just for fun and flavour.
---
And since I raided, I was on that other side. It felt like I was rewarded for the time and effort I put into the game. I'd get whispers, people clearly just standing around inspecting gear. When I got the first Sulfuras for Horde on my server people gathered around to see it because it was cool.
---
I was always 100% for having decent gear available for people who couldn't play 20-40 hours a week to do all of the raids who still wanted to PvP, but when the PvE gear became actively bad in PvP I think that was just so damaging to the whole world feel of the game. (My opinion is that they should have made PvP gear and PvE gear both good for PvP. I also think it would have been cool if the clear best item for some slots was from raids, and it would also be cool if the clear best item for a raid for some slots came from PvP. Splitting them off was the dumb part).
---
That's a bit early because the UK player base will only just be getting back from work at that time. 30mins later and it's more realistic.
---
the roguecraft guy is wearing t0 not 0.5
---
&gt; But not in PvP. I play PvP to test my skills and to have a fast paced and dynamic match.
---
This is not what your gonna get in classic, especially not from BGs. Retail has its scaling system so that gear is practically a none factor (i simply Q into arenas when i ding and go straight to 1800+ as i gear up). 
---
In Vanilla, that is not the case. Gear will easily be as determining factor as skill, depending on class. It is not a competitive game, its an actual MMORPG - a dynamic world with actual RPG elements. Do not go into it expecting an even playing field anywhere.
---
I think they could have introduced thinks like the goblin gliders from engineering.. and more alternate modes of transportation other than flying.  or the barfing buffs from leatherworking to not be dazed while mounted. etc.  or spurs from blacksmith to make mounting faster. things they have now but aren't even needed could have been game changing back then. 
---
AV precisely is a mix of both. The NPCs, both the static ones and the summoned ones, are part of it. Its not retail arena where your meant to show off l33t skillz, its a far more unique beast. I love competitive game, am 2500 rating xp and masters 1 on sc2, but this is not what i expect nor want from vanilla wow.
---
That's not at all what it means. One less paladin in the group is one less paladin buff. One paladin can't do all of the buffs.
---
I agree with shat not being what it was.  I think the vendors would have been fine.. rep and such.. the picking of the shat faction.. I get that the faction of blood elves have been there for awhile because of Illidan campaign there in wc3.  but they seemed to be excessive.
---
I don't understand why they would have the contents of my bank on an older world. that should have been left in the old world. 
---
Not going to lie but I found some vanilla buddies that were still on my Myspace account. Otherwise I would have never found them.
---
well LFG of today was nothing like the LFG systems of earlier expansions.  I think being to post your group on a "job board" for others to sign up and you can invite that way would have been nice.  in case you're out in the world and want to group. you don't have to be in a particular zone to see if a group is forming.  but don't auto teleport or auto join let people see who it is signing up, their class / role and such. 
---
Wow thats amazing work. Thanks. 
---
Dident you get the memo? All hobbies are now addictive deathtraps. As are all game. And GTA makes you kill people. 
---
This is just the next in a long line of parents looking for some scapegoat for their bad job parenting. 
---
World of Warcraft is addictive I will agree. However not so much that people lose social lives.
---
just so you know ppl hit lvl 10 at [1:40 ish](https://i.imgur.com/fuc6GCz.jpg), and its not like a record times even. not to mock or set you down or anything. just so you know. and priest is not a slow class at early levels actually. 
---
and if we are speaking about launch, with no sharding. you won't be able to do 1-8 quests. th best thing to do just go grind lvl 5-8 mobs in groups. 
---
for wands as alliance optimal thing to do is to go do darkshore quest at lvl10-11 and get your wand (Bashal'Aran quest very easy to do)(you'll need this fp either way, so you have to do this travel anyways). 
---
at 20ish you do bfd for that [op wand](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=7001). which will last you for a long ass time. super op wand and worth doing bfd for. plus couple other quest there aswell.
---
doing profession at low level at launch you setting yourself back gianourmously, its completely not worth it. 
---
leveling at launch is all about getting ahead and staying ahead of the pack. not to stay behind the curve doing profession, so then later in perspective you get a decent wand. it doesnt work like that. everything is very snowbally.
---
not to mention you most likely won't be able just sit and grind mobs, as ppl will be killing them and place be grounded, even with sharding.
---
if you were guided by that kargoz's wands guide its just a guide for a guide, just a cool gimmick, its not worth doing at all. if we are talking about any kind of efficiency.
---
I think we're getting an option to toggle between old and new graphics atm but I can't see dungeon finder ever making it into classic.
---
How did that end up happening in osrs?
---
03:58 lmao
---
Thinking of going with tailor/ench for profs as a priest. My question(s) - after I make the Truefaith vestment, is it worth keeping tailoring?  or will I not be able to wear it should I unlearn it?
---
If rogue diaries are available from SM boxes then I think pickpocket is definitely worth it, they sell for 50 silver each. You should also find a decent amount of rare quality daggers in the boxes, they don’t sell well on the AH so I kept one and censored most of them. On my pserver there was also always a chest in the first garden in Arm, I guess that was a bug, it made some extra gold but also forced more runs to the vendor which is kinda long so not sure it’s really a lose if you can’t spam it, means you’ll do more runs before going to sell.
---
You need to respec to sub to do this ofcourse. You need enough lockpicking skills for the door/boxes, and big enough bags to make it worth.
---
Rogue diaries should be available so I think it’s gonna be a fun way for rogues to farm their first mount. Also you’ll need prep so you’ll be in waiting in pvp spec in the hall between resets and you can get a lot of kills, which can help with your rank 3 which gives a 10% discount on mount. Pvp, pickpocketing and lockpicking, that’s a nice little break in your leveling and funnier than farming jaguars or gorillas in combat spec. 
---
ownedcore was mmowned in vanilla/tbc so you probably look for it. 
---
&gt; I find it very weird to do that. If people are going to be retarded, they're going to get kicked either way.
---
I also find it weird, and not because of that, but because of asking for private details. You could as well be asked for race and religion.
---
&gt; But before you even reached him, the point where many people stumbled on was the Stratholme portion of the quest, which required you to complete a timed run of the dungeon, killing the end boss 45 minutes after entering.
---
one could pay raid geared people to boost you
---
Save gold for when .5 drops, and run the 5mans to get your other bis. Go nuts with professions. Complete all the quests. Help your guildies with their gear. Play a twink. Grind the reps.
---
There's plenty to do in the game to fill space between launch and .5, and a lot of it is pretty time consuming.
---
This is the experience that I had. I was also a member of several organizations on campus, president of a fraternity chapter, and held an internship on top of trying to get an engineering degree. WoW permeated all of those roles to an extent that I’d schedule them as far apart as I could do I could play. 
---
To this day I won’t schedule events or leave the house unscheduled on Saturday and Sunday. I used to truly disappear from society to catch up on WoW &amp; math classes. Can’t wait to do it again lol.
---
Also - For those who don’t remember these times, watch the video again and look at how thick those laptops were back in the day! Crazy to think a 5lbs laptop was “light” lol. Also: not a bucket chair to be found.
---
&gt; And the end of the day all guilds want is someone reliable, not at the whims of their parents
---
so identity card silences parents, or what?
---
Engineering goggles were one of the reasons all my toons pre boa had engineering. I hate having empty gear slots! The shoulders is going to bother the hell out of me like always.
---
Yeah I felt so proud to get my random white quality leather shoulders as a hunter

They do, financial quarters are global.

I believe youre thinking BC defense rating cap whereas Im talking about being uncrittable  by dungeon bosses.
---
Yes that works aswell ofc. But you got to wait till p2 and the quest also isn't a freebie it has quit a bit of a cost in mats and time. Cheaper than the normal epic mount still however.
---
I've not misread your reply, you've missed what the point of such things are for. If blizzard let's people dev Addons during betas or earlier, they can see any loopholes and ideas players are having and limit the API where needed before it goes live.

I'm farming lightforge just to do this chain when it comes out!

for hemo. u should start with combat and at lvl 30 you respecc hemo.
---
damn you're right, mmowned was my first guess but i just thought that was prob runescape related
---
thank s

Highly unlikely I’m afraid. Changing the 1.12 data specifically for Lupos broken tooth etc. is a long shot. They’d need to change 1.12 Lupos back to when he had shadow dmg and then later, change him back again to where he is now, being no shadow damage. 
---
That one’s a relic for the Vanilla history books. 😢
---
Not sure what you mean
---
&gt; but also forced more runs to the vendor which is kinda long so not sure it’s really a lose if you can’t spam it, means you’ll do more runs before going to sell.
---
forgot about this
---
makes it lame for allies
---
Haha, I did corn dogs.  Could walk away from the computer for a minute to throw some in the oven, which had a timer, so I could set the time and walk away and even if I didn't come back for an hour I'd still have (semi) warm corn dogs.
---
I'd slather them in BBQ and mustard and hot sauce and be in heaven, plus I could eat them in like 3 seconds so I could get back to GRINDING.
---
In the countdown to classic podcast someone was talking about how they would use that underwater as a mage, sheep people, and watch them drown.
---
Sheeping people causes the character to automatically swim downward because sheeps are dumb.
---
Fair point but if you were farming you could be in Silithus, Winterspring, EPL, WPL, Azshara, Arathi, Burning Steppes, Un'goro, Duskwood. ie A lot of different places of differing levels all around the world. That made it feel more alive and more like a world rather than 6 interconnected zones, totally separated from anyone below 58.
---
I personally didn't mind flying mounts. When you got somewhere in Vanilla and you could see over a zone boundary at the nothingness it was just sad.
---
When you flew around in outlands and everything had been worked on it was nice.
---
All the removal of socializing ruined it for me. First when they cut us down from 40 to 25 people in a raid.
---
Then they added Dungeon finder so you didn't have to find anything yourself.
---
Then they started teleporting you straight to dungeons, so you didn't even chat to each other on the way there. It just turned into an impatient mess of "WE ARE HERE INSTANTLY! GO GO GO!"
---
Pretty sure Jimmy is a powerful Litch and can't die. Lel
---
Yeah we would always talk about what we were gonna do on WoW at work.
---
The other cool part was we never all 4 worked on the same day, but our supervisor knew we were all roommates, so he sorta referred to us as a group when doing the schedule and would let us take each other's shifts without needing to notify him as long as none of us went into overtime.
---
So basically it wasn't "you work this day, you work that day" it was just "the roomies cover these shifts and these shifts" and we sorta decided among ourselves who would come in.
---
It wasn't like that at first, but he grew to trust us enough that he let it happen and we never really screwed it up so we got to work that way for years.
---
Instead of playing Warcraft you should be training harder to engage in gainful labor in our economy. How dare you do something you enjoy instead of increasing GDP. 
---
I still get hot dogs from 711 once in a blue moon.  Two big bites for 2 bucks each and then the condiments are free so I will throw on a heaping pile of jalapenos and then slather it in chili and nacho cheese.  Its a mess and I usually end up eating it out of the container with a fork, but its satisfying.
---
Its a pretty big meal for 4 bucks.  
---
So maybe I'm in the minority but I don't mind this being released super late.  Tier 0.5 is one of my end goals for classic and I plan on taking things nice and slow.  If I hit 60 on my lock and priest before it comes out I'll just start trying to get the full tier 0 set to be ready.
---
I don't plan on raiding much and I'm not a huge min-maxer so I don't care if the gear isn't optimal I just really want to finish the set because I never could back in vanilla.
---
The item is only BoP so once you make it you could drop tailoring if you wanted.
---
Yeah, we didn't really have enough room in our rooms for our computer setups so all of our computers were in the living room.  We had a giant as TV (for the mid 2000's) that we pooled our money together to get and we had free rentals since we worked at Blockbuster.
---
So basically, for *years*, everyday was a lan party where we had new movies and cartoons and shit playing on the TV and we were all just on our comps doing dungeons, bgs, and raiding together.
---
You can not program that.
---
&gt;Old talents
---
Sounds good. But being lvl 120 would mean that you'd probably have everything unlocked by now which would make it a bit ridiculous to be honest.
---
&gt;Better professions
---
Not necessarily needed because the profession by themselves are good. The issue I am seeing is, that as a crafting profession you can't help a guildmate out with the sweet 415 stuff. You can craft that once and that's it. For leatherworkers and tailors it's basically "make me the cheapest stuff you can do like 500 times and I throw it right in the dumpster for a chance of getting expulsom.". Enchanting, alchemy, etc is "mate do you have a flask/enchant etc?" - " sure here you go bro!" - "awesome thanks!"
---
&gt;No flying
---
Lol no. I like the solution with the pathfinder achievement. No need to remove flying. If people want to ride their horses or whatever they are free to do so.
---
&gt;Gear being more meaningful
---
Well... Gear is meaningful. There still are BiS gear pieces. What's weird to me is that you can get to 380 without ever going to a heroic raid. That's ridiculous. I think it would be good if the wf/tf system is at least changed. +15 iLvL is insane. If it's +5 ilvl most people wouldn't bitch that often about it I guess.
---
&gt;Regarding your comment including the removal of a group browser
---
Hell no. Literally every game has some sort of group browser by now. I understand the issues of a queue and I'm not talking about that. But removing the browser would be a very bad change in retail. Hell I even think that classic would be okay with a browser. Being forced to stay in the city and do nothing but spamming a macro in 2 or 1 was okay. But from a today's perspective... Nah. Wouldn't want that.
---
For raiding on basically all mana classes
---
a) it drinks a major mana potion every 2 minutes or it gets the hose again
---
b) try hard go with demonic /dark runes (deal dmg generate mana) dragon's breath /lasher root (farmable + health and mana)  on another 2 min cd
---
c) learn to downrank
---
d) learn not to overheal mindlessly (waste of mana)
---
e) learn to conserve mana when possible (aka let hots do their jobs on random raid damage if the fight allows for it)
---
\-
---
bad examples
---
oom casters going full 'wand' because they have no potions / burned too fast through their mana pool in general
---
warlocks draining healer mana with no moderation - ending up risking the entire raid/group for it
---
hunters sitting and drinking
---
if u have to go on pservers go on a instant 60 fun server with vendors etc
---
just to test shit and mess around
---
in ways for sure, but at least if it was slower than groundmounts then people would choose to still be on the ground most of the time rather than flying everywhere, unreachable by everything basically.
---
because most of the people in this subreddit base their opinions of classic off of their experience on private servers 
---
if u got lw u could make the skins into nightsomething 40ish items
---
and vendor those for profit
---
u may even be able to find cheap skin in AH to use
---
Because whiny jockstraps whine loudly.
---
I don't know about that.  I found pre-nerf cata heroics to be a ton of fun.  They were really dull after the nerf though.
---
So to get geared for ele PvP, I'd have to raid?

I played the demo but I forget if mining/herbalism were in it. My question is if anyone knows if we will be able to track nodes for each simultaneously? I know you couldn't in vanilla but just wondering because they are changing the way mailing works. I know you can write a macro ro toggle it back and forth but that's not what I'm asking.
---
Good point. I guess you would go to Chillwind? Crossing WPL as a sub rogue is okay (you want all the stealth talents to farm Arm at 40 anyway) but it's still longer than a trip to the tent near UC for Horde. 
---
That being said I did not invest in bigger bags before doing this, that's how you would compensate as an ally. Bigger bags and less treasure spawn and you could farm for much longer than me before having to sell. I got carried by a few green or grey 2 handers in the chest but iircs rogue diaries stack in 5 and can pile up pretty quickly so it's good to have enough slots for them. Maybe farming Stockades could be an option, pickpocketing or maybe bursting bosses with AR, or Evasion/ghostly strike/prep. No idea if it's possible at this level or if it's worth the time.
---
I'm not even sure pickpocketing will be the best gold/hour at this level even for Horde, but as a lvl40 rogue you should have at least 2 good weapons so going sub and doing some pvp/pickpocketing is a nice break, suddenly having hemo, prep, dirty deeds on top of improved gouge makes you feel much more dangerous in pvp. Still, it's probably more efficient to grind mobs that drop good grey because you keep getting xp as you do so. 
---
I think you hit the nail on the head, my friend. If you didnt play it, you dont get it. Not fully, anyway. I'm just glad I am not the only one to have these feelings! LOL Some of the places in game have so many memories that the locations sit in your brain like as if they are real world places. I did this here, I met my friend there, I remember getting ganked here...whatever it may be, and when you go to those places there is a link, and they are almost always positive recollections (even if at the time, they sucked!). I cant wait to go back, and I cant wait to be surrounded by like minded individuals who share the same affinity for Azeroth, and the game as a whole. A bunch of us really need to coordinate and make a guild. Would make for an amazing time.
---
I was really bummed when I got it. My best friend was a warlock, and he decided to just randomly not come. So when it dropped, he cried in his head a bit. When we joined up later, I clicked it on him and he was happy, then put on my real weapons, and it went away. He was so disappointed. Argh. Bad memories. I will never go into that dungeon without a pure caster ever again!
---
That wasn't back in classic but on private servers.
---
Putting them close to ZG in the release order makes most sense. At this point they will not replace too many items but they won't be useless yet either.
---
However, the summonable bosses would add items that are kind of part of the dungeon drops rework. This poses a problem.  
---
Back in the day both the Dungeon 2 set quest chain and the improved dungeon gear drops were implemented by Blizzard as an afterthought in reply to widespread complaints by non-raiders about not having any possible gear progression. Because of this afterthought nature all of this way released way too late into vanilla to have as much of an impact as it could have made. At least on my server back then not many people did the quest line and only few people reran dungeons for new items.  
---
The original patch kind of missed its target for us back then. There has to be a better time in the progression to release it.
---
depends on the setups and tactics. heigan, gothic and c'thun come to mind whereby a fap or lap can save your butt to get a slow off you if the worst comes to the worst. 
---
titans can be in the calculation for loatheb raid health, along with the overall additional HP helping you out in resistance heavy fights as most resistance gear for nature especially are generic stat less greens or lower level items in general
---
IIRC you could only track one at a time.
---
Good lord dude, to this day, that music still gives me chills and instantly teleports me back in time. Especially the bit that starts at 1:16 of the vid. Should a 41 year old man be sitting here with goosebumps after listening to some elf music? Probably not, but I wouldnt change it for the world! LOL

Did you read all I wrote there? "For all WE know" - We don't know if they have data before 1.12, we don't even know if they have ANY data before 1.12.

Thank you for the answer.  Kinda hate the thought of not having the best gear i can for pvp. Which classes would you say have the easiest time getting their pvp bis gear? I saw the list higher up (shaman/paladin was  lowest rank needed) but is there any class whos bis pvp gear comes from raids? How
---
Much worse is bloodfang set and cts compared to rank 14 for rogues?
---
I'll do it for fun, and for showing off the outfit in town -neither the release stage or power level of the gear really matter to me. Especially looking forward to 45min Baron runs - that was always intense!

---
Why is it that GTA5 is such a beloved game, yet its also relatively new. Sure there are those who love GTA3 and Vice City, but few will claim that those were *better" than GTA5. Why is it, that this argument of "nostalgia" does not apply there?
---
Why is it that Tekken 7 was seen as a great entry to the series, and a sort of comeback. Yet people hate Tekken 4, which came out around the time WoW released. Where is the nostalgia for Tekken 4? Or Tekken 1?
---
Why is nobody asking for Warcraft 1? If nostalgia is what makes people like stuff, then Warcraft 1 should have the most nostalgia of all Blizzard games?
---
Why is it that comic book movies are so beloved today? Why is nobody clamoring for the nostalgia of the great comic book hero movies of the 90s? Such as Batman and Robin and Batman Forever? Where is the nostalgia for those?
---
Why do people love so many modern TV shows like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad etc? Where is the nostalgia for TV shows of the 90s, like Hercules and Xena Warrior Princess?
---
I can keep on, but "nostalgia" is a fucking shitty argument. It should be mocked when anyone uses that word. Its simply damage control invented by drooling idiots at MMO champ forums and r/wow in attempt to mask the sheer failure of Retail WoW.
---
The Great Pyramids were made hundreds of years ago, they are marvelous works of architectural design. But according to r/wow, that is just nonsense, and its just "nostalgia dude"

Actually the closest vendor for Alliance would be Argent Quartermaster Hasana at the Bulwark, she's neutral and you should be able to sell her your stuffs without reputation, but she is surrounded by some Horde NPC, not sure if it's doable as a rogue.

I will be playing a caster so I think to only go with gathering professions, but thanks for the tip!
---
Yes pretty much.  
---
Rank 11 gear is very good for Ele PvP but once you obtain it your upgrades come from PvE.  
---
Especially weapons. [Lok'amir Il Romathis](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19360) is essentially your BiS until the next expansion, at least for damage. [Midnight Haze](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22803) is *slightly* better
---
There are better healing maces from C'thun and Kel'thuzad but those are often given to Priests. Shamans are usually first in line for Lok'amir Il Romathis because of its shelf life.
---
They're already releasing it differently than it was back in vanilla times. 
---
If they changed the items, that would be opening can of worms. But playing with the correct timing of the release schedule and phases is not only ok, but necessary.
---
Shared the petition on various Discords, here's hoping it works and Blizzard will listen! :-)
---
Love it.
---
Its not even out yet but I want to know if after a while if they will re-release BC also. 
---
Can’t help you there.
---
I mean if master looter exists that room for abuse is still the exact same. Exactly as it was in Classic.
---
Same! Can’t beat the occasional Bahama Mama or loading up a ton of cheap wings and a few Arizona’s
---
As for levelling: you go feral and keep side pieces to heal.
---
I really like this PVP guide. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh_6Cxf6ehU
---
Final professions should be engineering if PVP. Don't need anything specific for PVE.
---
For PVP if you want to be the best you can be, there's a number of engineering and utility items you want to get, like skull of impending doom.
---
You'll need a separate set of gear for each thing you want to do.
---
Post yesterday was saying we will have a release date the 28, in 4 days. Will see. 
---
No shit, S3 was equivalent to tier 6 in progression lol
---
Definitely go Hemo &gt; Cold Blood if you absolutely detest combat. If you're interested in PvP there are a some talents you can switch up that can make the PvP experience more enjoyable. Riposte, Imp Gouge, Imp Kick, Imp Sprint/Endurance all make combat a lot more enjoyable if you want to PvP. Riposte lets you easily deal with warriors and other rogues. Imp sprint and Imp kick are godly versus mages and locks which are can be a nuisance for a rogue to fight. Hemo on the other hand lets you engage more and be more threatening with Prep. You can stun lock easier with initiative, dirty deeds and hemo or burst people down with imp ambush. They're all fun though.
---
My recommendation would be to level to 30 as Combat picking up all of the fun talents I've mentioned and try some low level bgs and WPvP. If you hate it, respec hemo and see how you like that. Always keep a dagger for ambush if you're going to play Hemo. Level cooking to at least 100 and herbalism to at least 75 so you can pick swiftthisle and cook Thistle tea. Leveling herbalism higher to pick fadeleaf isn't a bad idea either. 
---
Pm me too please! Thanks
---
Dewy is the nectar of the gods. Just replace the pizza rolls with r/tendies because sauce is vegetal. You'll have a healthy frame in no time m'goodboy. 
---
Even if it was released quite late in vanilla, I think they should release tier 0.5 earlier than phase 5. If you look at item level of MC set it is 66 while tier 0.5 is 55-66 depending on pieces. So on average its lower than tier 1 which is available at launch. Also, like explained by OP, it is not simply a drop, you need to go through long questchains, invest lot of ressources and also have the tier 0 item to upgrade it. Even then, some pieces from Dire Maul are simply better in slot than tier 0.5 and it is easier to obtain them.
---
So instead of phase 5, I think they should add tier 0.5 in phase 2, at the same time as Dire Maul, before ZG.
---
This is my favorite. I’ve been listening to original WoW music on pandora. Teldrassil is my absolute favorite.
---
Spot on.
---
The better player argument would be about staying true to vanilla game play. The Blizzard argument might be avoiding a commitment of time/resources to reitemizing Classic.
---
I'd still want Classic just because even if retail WoW improved with all those things, I'd still want to be able to quest in say, Auberdine or the Shimmering Flats, areas that simply don't exist anymore, alongside with class mechanics that don't exist anymore, and won't come back (Hunters having focus now is a huge sorespot for me)
---
kinda stupid to have a neutral guy there if u gonna be attacked by npc right next to it
---
Yes it should be released earlier. Like around bwl earlier.
---

I know that the color of the shamans and paladins in classic was the same. I have given the color dark blue to the overview of the shamans.

Funfact: There wasn't a single illegal race-class combination in the survey.
---
Me too. I love Teldrassil the best.
---
Working nights in a restaurant can be ideal for raiding. If you work 4 - 11 and have a late night raiding guild, you can stay up all night and be a hardcore raider vs a regular 9 - 5.
---
On a side note does anyone know if Rhok'Delar will be available on Launch through the MC quest drop?
---
Back when WoW had rpg elements.
---
I loved this set when it came in. Due to job stuff, I couldn’t really raid, and tbh as a warrior I wasn’t fond of choosing between being a porcupine or a new Megaman bad guy, Axe-Man. Loved the warrior set. 
---
I never did quite complete it. Missing the last couple of pieces. Since my job and now family life still won’t allow for raiding, this will likely be my end goal once again.
---
The thing about raiding is that there's no tier tokens until AQ40. Depending on how well your guild is run and loot RNG you may obtain full Bloodfang within a 6 month period or in the worst case scenario you'll be waiting until the next raid tier before you obtain full 8 piece.
---
CTS also comes down to luck and the type of loot system your guild uses. These days on private servers the most experienced GMs maintain their own loot log that the entire guild can view, and the GMs also plan out and distribute loot very precisely to ensure that there's no waste. For example if they know that two Rogues have their 2-set bonus while a third Rogue is waiting for their 4-set bonus, even though all 3 Rogues want the item the guy who gets the set bonus gets prioritized because that minimizes waste.  
---
Regarding how difficult it is to obtain CTS you might get lucky and see three drops in three weeks. Or you might get unlucky and see no CTS for months. It's all down to luck when it comes to 40 man raiding because the loot tables are gigantic relative to the amount of bosses.
---
Most of the rank 13 armor pieces are PvP BiS for Rogues even after Naxxramas. Rank 14 weapons are essentially BiS unless you obtain KT weapons.
---
The classes that have the easiest time getting PvP BiS are Paladin and Shaman. Hunter has a fairly easy time of gearing in general because T1 and T2 happen to be very solid PvP sets. Their *BiS* PvP set is the rank 13 armor set though.  
---
Hunters also need a bit of luck because their BiS weapons are all sourced from PvE. It can take a long while before you're the lucky person to obtain Ashjre'thul due to it being a boss-specific drop and fairly average drop rate as well. The second best alternative Rhok'delar is passed around like bubble gum though and you'll have it for a long time.
---
How big is the diffrence for rogues with tier 2/2.5/3 with pve bis wep compared to rank 14?
---
   Blizzard being concerned with trivializing content/gear should move tier 0.5 to stage 3 or 4 at the latest.

TLDR: T0.5 is a great concept for decent catch up gear. However patch 5 is too late and the gear isn’t worth it. T0.5 is geared as a catch up for BWL/Hakkar and takes a considerable amount of dungeon runs, time and gold. It would take a patch worth of time to acquire it so a phase 3 release wouldn’t be bad. T0.5 gear is also great for PVPers and Alts and creates content for many different types of players to share. If blizzard doesn’t want to trivialize this gear again and wants to have players running original dungeons (not DM) and have a decent gold sink built into the game it should be released phase 3 or 4 at the latest. 
---
Thoughts:
---
   T0.5 was trivialized in vanilla. It came out to late and cost to much time and gold when compared to other gear of greater value being readily available. At the point of release ZG and AQ20 were easy to get into and MC was on farm where alts and newer players could find their way in pretty easily. Upgraded dungeon loot was also added which was better than T0.5. Blue PVP gear would also be an easier farm for similar gear for most classes, albeit not as many set pieces.
---
   The concept of T0.5 is great but will completely be overlooked if in phase 5 like it was in vanilla. Many classes pass on their T0 gear as it is sub optimal compared to off set dungeon blues going into MC. This will give more incentive to run dungeons early to pick up and hang on to T0. It also gives incentive to not run DM over and over. 
---
   T0 is fine for entry into MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20. T0 is sub optimal for BWL and later ZG/AQ20 bosses. It’s purpose should be to help non progressive players/guilds push into entering BWL and down Hakkar as well as give &gt;rank 10 pvp players gear to fill out more gear slots. Progressive players will have already been geared from MC and able to push into BWL on launch. They will be also be well equipped to clear ZG on launch. And let’s be real, rank 10+ pvp players will not invest the required time/gold for T0.5. 
---
   IMHO the most interactive phase would be phase 3. Progressive players will move into BWL. Players just getting into MC or guilds not clearing MC will not be ready for BWL. This will give an entire community incentive to continue running content available to them (5 man dungeons) for an entire phase as it takes time acquire these items. This beats raid logging for MC or losing interest in dungeons (mainly repeating DM) with no real upgrades. 
---
   
---
   The best part about T0.5 is that you have to have the piece of T0 armor before you can upgrade it. This is a great catch up mechanic as it doesn’t allow fresh to 60 players the ability to easily get these items. They have to farm 5 mans for the original gear and have to farm gold and mats to upgrade them. It isn’t a simple drop from 5 mans like some of the later added catch-up blues are. They can run MC and acquire T0.5 simultaneously to “catch up”.  
---
   T0.5 also makes a great avenue for alts to gear up as active players will have better access to gold and mats helping to keep alts relevant and geared enough to bring to raids beyond MC. 
---
   One “issue” with vanilla is that main characters become a huge focus for players because alts get left so far behind so fast. Blizzards original intent for WoW was for this to not be the case (see player handbook). This will also add to community interaction where you have alts of highly active players sharing content and playing with players that are more casual or newer to the game. 
---
   If in phase 5 I wouldn’t really consider acquiring T0.5 gear at all. I may grab an item or 2 if in phase 4. I would definitely pursue my dungeon set 1 from launch and actively upgrade them if in phase 3. 
---
Pet attack speed wasn’t normalized until TBC. 
---
Other pet stats kept through the taming process (movement speed, resistances, Lupos dojng Shadow Damage) were normalized during the scope of Vanilla. 
---
Not unless someone is twinking their alt
---
I always had the TV on while I was playing and to this day I associate episodes of shows with whatever zone I was in while it was on.
---
Dwarf rogue it is then!
---
Chips and salsa is one of my go-tos to this day!
---
Just a bit of feedback, it'd probably be interesting to a lot of people to see the breakdown of each class for the faction without haveing to calculate it by hand
---
Good point. The phase changes, particularly regarding Dire Maul have a similar effect in the opposite direction. Releasing T.5 earlier would be changing quests and dungeon bosses rather than changing whole dungeon availability.
---
It's an interesting idea.
---
Never be ashamed of your healthy frame m'goodboy
---
Yalls diets make me literally sick to my stomach im sorry 😂.  I’ve had my fair share of binging but I don’t see how you guys eat pizza or gas station food weeks in a row... 
---
I had thought that I would play a dwarf priest, but seem to want to make several.
---
I tried this skinning method to 40 and had a mount by 42. whenever I had to grind XP I would only grind skinnable mobs and would skin things I killed, other people left, etc along the way
---
Jimmy run for your life, Overlord Wyrmthalak has come for you! oh my god l, he cannot hear us, he has airpods in his ears!
---
As a horde player, can i accept a quest from an alliance npc? Im thought there were faction specific quests for raids and world bosses.
---
Also, what profession fetches the most gold? I was a mining/smith last time i played (about 6mo before tbc release), and i dont remember it being very lucrative.
---
Same here.  That actually got me kind of excited looking over at the numbers.
---
Thank you.
---
I wasn't sure whether it was percent or absolute.
---
I thought that rule applied to people encouraging harassment. I'm not sure that informing the community of names to blacklist would fall under that category 
---
That's my recollection too
---
Just a side note, the markdown on Reddit for *italics* is to border with each side with a *
---
Use two for bold.
---
I guess you talk about pre-raid?
---
After you get prebis its instant invite to MC/ZG and there is the ”free epics”.
---
I was just about to google search for something like this, and it instantly popped up on my feed. Thank you. Appreciate your synchronicity. 
---
Jimmy is the true Anduin. The one in throne room is only a body double.
---
Im gonna use the updated graphics, but i promise i wont make vanilla shit for yall, deal?
---
Well thank you.
---
I did the same thing, but unfortunately there was only a rough distribution.
---
Nope.  Neutral NPCs can give quests to both sides but alliance NPCs will be hostile to you and not give any quests.
---
That's not Vanilla-like, though
---
To each their own!
---
I'd honestly still eat this way if it wasn't for my blood pressure and waistline.  Both get harder to maintain the older I get, so now I only let myself have one or two "greasy food" days a week.  :P
---
Genuine curiosity: why pick a Nelf Hunter over Dwarf? 
---
Yes it is
---
No one has forgotten about the amazing Tier 0.5 sets
---
What happened to OSRS?
---
maybe he means the stuff they were talking about is pretty tame for an 11 yo nowadays
---
It's pretty fun with some good gear for the level.  If you're on kalimdor it might be worth the run south to give it a go.  If you're across the sea it will be by no means optimal but still not out of the question.  Never a bad time to grab the ratchet flight path while you're there either.
---
any of those blades look like an X on your back?
---
Because you want to play a Night Elf?
---
Slightly higher base agility due to being nelf and shadowmeld is noobfriendlier than stoneskin in PvP since you can charge aimed while stealthed.
---
Radeon 9250 pci (!) ?  
---
What was the ! for? Do you mean it was AGP rather than PCI?
---
Anal [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
DKs were not removed until the TBC patch. They were part of Vanilla during about 85-90% of the time the Honor system was in place.
---
They also added Karazhan.
---
Is Classic WoW a buffet now, where we pick and choose which TBC features we want in the game?
---
Yes, implemented in patch 1.5, which means up until patch 1.5, they didn’t exist. 
---
Because you just finished watching LOTR for the first time and want to be Legolas
---
Some people think nelf females look good, and dont like the way dwarves look. 
---
Some people choose to play hunter because they like animals and want a pet. Night elves are generally a lot more animal-friendly lorewise than the dwarves are. 
---
I'm sure there are still some people who want to be Legolas as well, trying to play the stereotypical elf archer. 
---
Blizzard added T0.5 as well as adding several new gear upgrades to dungeons during the final third of vanilla's lifespan to help players catch up to progression raiders. Don't forget that the game was growing and new players were hitting 60 for the first time ever every day.
---
Blizzard didn't want to make new players progress through the game in a strictly linear fashion because they were afraid that players who were behind the curve would be in an ever shrinking minority and eventually be unable to find raid groups.
---
Catch-up gear was always a part of WoW and T0.5 was definitely meant as catch-up gear. It wasn't until TBC that Blizzard came up with a system to distribute catch-up gear that was external to the core gameplay loop, i.e: kill boss, obtain loot.
---
I personally think that the T0.5 implementation was better than the currency based catch-up mechanics of later versions, even though it hurt the game when they also added blue gear to dungeons that was better than what you found in Molten Core and Onyxia's Lair.
---
Well and more importantly, it would give all non-raiders an alternative end-game loot more logically placed (in the middle phase - in the middle of classic life-span) than putting it near the end (phase 5 out of 6), where it is really mostly irrelevant. People who don't want/can't raid would have something to do in launch/phase one, then nothing to do the whole time, then again something only at the end (phase five), when it's already useless compared to every other content released in similar time (phase four to six).
---
Is it known for sure yet if, along with the subscription fee, we will have to drop $50 or $60 in order to access the classic servers? 
---
that would be freakin sweet.
---
to be honest im really hoping once this new classic gets thru all its content patches, theres some sorta of new content announcement. like maybe they finish off zones they never did. or add some new zones to play in.
---
or a whole new wow 2.0 with the classic gameplay would be killer.
---
&gt;I think I'd just go herb+skin ( farming beasts for mount money at 40) and at 60 drop skin for ench and then do the dungeon soloing. Or idk even a few sm stealth runs should be good you only need to farm for like 80-90g. so its like what 10-20 runs?
---
Leveling enchanting is a gold sink, if you're 60 and your skinning is at 60 definitely give a try to devilsaur leather farming if you're not afraid of competition. But honestly enchanting sounds like a bad idea for a rogue, solo'ing dungeons isn't something you really do. I guess maybe herbing + desenchant RFD items? At 60 you can just pickpocket farm BRD as well. Herb+skin at 40 is good enough honestly, you just farm jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows in your late 30's or gorillas near BB when you get to 40 and you'll get gold + xp. But if you want to take a break from spamming SS and getting jumped by hunters in your pve spec, and that Hasana is available to Alliance, SM farming can do it. 
---
IIRC one SM Arm run would take in average 10 minutes? If a mob resists your pickpocket you have to vanish, if vanish and prep are on cd you need to wait or risk a corpse run. Then depending on how many boxes you get and what's inside it, you can make some decent gold (again, rogue diaries sell for 50s and were not very rare, this is what will make your gold slowly climb even if you don't loot chest or blue daggers, so it depends on whether the diaries will be available on release and if they drop in SM/how much they drop). 
---
Yea, but people "over complaining" doesnt mean no one should complain. 
---
100% FREE weekends to people with ambiguous sexualities 
---
not even 30% of those warriors will pull through till 60 :D
---
also. that's a lot of rogues crying about their piss poor gear, never seeing a dungeon from the inside
---
WoW was released in Nov 2004.
---
5 months later, PVP Honor was introduced wiht Patch 1.4.
---
2 months later, DKs were introduced with Patch 1.5
---
18 months later, DKs were removed with the TBC patch 2.0.1
---
So Honor with no DHK existed for only 8% of Vanilla, and only 10% of the time that the Honor system was in place.
---
Let me guess. Private servers have no DHKs for 100% of the time. Am I right?
---
That’s not the point, the point is that you are claiming it’s not vanilla like, which it is, DKs both existed, and did not exist in vanilla. Both are legitimate options.
---
Should be
---
"Ill buy that 50g" "okay ill tell master looter" *trades gold* "okay give him the loot" "cool pleasure doing buisness"
---
Ya I remember seeing guys win a roll and it went to someone else anyway by accident. 
---
Or someone announcing they'll pay money to whoever wins the roll for it. If you ML is willing to do any of this then they're name is just as bad as a ninja looter and probably won't make it in anymore pug raids following anyways
---
Nooo I hated that flute.  
---
Every time I started drinking a mage in my guild started playing it.  
---
Ok I might not hate it but the interruption of my drinking was not nice.  
---
Blizzard has confirmed that you will not have to pay any flat expansion fee to play classic WoW. No need to buy the latest expansion either. Just pay the subscription fee.
---
OMG. I know this image is old but it is so fucking funny. 
---
My wife is planning on "Naaaaaaaiill."
---
You could do that anyway. Nothing is stopping ML from accepting bribes in Vanilla. The only difference is now you can make sure the briber gets it if you misclick, instead of only one chance. Literally nothing changes on "can ML be bribed" front.
---
The problem with 5 mans is in a need before greed scenario. A mail item drops. Both I (Sham) and the Hunter can use it.
---
My roll: 80.  
---
Hunter: 70
---
Ok its my piece. But wait! The other 3 (a warrior and a priest/mage) also roll need. These people have no need for int mail wtf?
---
Warrior roll: 90.  
---
Grats, now the Hunter gets the mail I would have won, if loot trading wasnt present. 
---
The problem that loot trade would create wont exist, because LT wont be usable where that problem can occur. Nothing about ML changes, you could bribe people in Vanilla.
---
Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
---
Go the extra mile, be a female dwarf. Literally 3 or 4 on the whole server.
---
Me too. I try to go back to Horde but after Cata and shit changed it just wasn’t the same. In classic will be Horde again, can’t wait. 
---
I didnt know undead were so popular. Also surprised to see rogue isnt the most popular undead. 
---
Fun to see, thanks. 
---
Cool,  could've sworn there was something to it guess I must've forgotten how it worked before it got changed, cheers for this btw.
---
Depends on if they implement modern tracking or try to stay true to classic. I’m classic it was only tracking one or the other never both at the same time. Which is why a lot of dual gathering setups use skinning. 
---
This might have convinced me to roll alliance 
---
Dang. I hope they fix that bit at least. :\*( Thanks for the reply.
---
Such an Epic feeling, getting your first grey or white headpiece!  
---
Similarly, shoulders!
---
Only if your trying to make a lvl19 twink. Your better off doing quest. 
---
"Matt has played a total of 47 days within wow"  
---
\- pfft, noob.
---
basically there is only 1 bow (the quest bow) and aside from that hunters are all about xbows.
---
But I would only toss the following two addendums to your list:  a more human-esque design usually appeals more to a general audience who isn't deep into lore or fantasy behind a specific race. 
---
stone skin is super niche and basically doesn't do anything for the hunter that the class desperately needs.
---
Feels like home 
---
The irony that children in wow can't die. Beautiful XD  
---
Wait.  
---
My god they'd make amazing shields and armor.
---
Honor with no DHKs is as Vanilla-like as Reckoning Bombs and CC with no diminishing returns.
---
Blizzard says 1.12 is the best form of Vanilla. That includes DHKs.
---
What did we get when they removed DHKs? High-level elite guards patrolling lowbie towns. That's far worse.
---
You're equipped todo most all of it with 0 talent points. My best advice is to make consecration your first priority.
---
I too was a Defias Brotherhood player from Vanilla to WOD. From Pandaria onwards it got taken over by WPVP guilds and many of the RPers moved to AD...AD really became the only EU RP server, hence the high pop.
---
I'm undecided on whether or not there's a huge need for RP-PVP servers personally. If there is one, I'll happily play it, but I'd be happy rolling with other RPers on a PVP server. 
---
Oh god no, there is a really funny part where the 11 year old is shit talking and won't shut up then someone just says "SHUT UP YOU LITTLE NIGGER!" which as I put it in text may seem really bad but it obviously isn't meant in a racist way, it is someone making a joke and being over the top to get the kid's attention, but today you would imagine that guy who said it would be kicked out or seen as a racist.
---
It is a very funny video/audio but some real like over the top stuff but nothing mean spirited or anything, stuff involving rape, people pretending to be gay to weird out the kid etc
---
Honestly worth a listen if you haven't already.
---
It's funny how inaccurate this is compared to how it's going to be. Lot of contrarians here. Druid more popular than Rogue and Mage, lol.
---
It was always my dream to play a class that could get the hand of Rag in vanilla -I played a mage back in the day- and I plan on going Ret as well. 
---
Look at it this way: according to this subreddit and a billion like it, supposedly no matter what retadins can’t hope for anything more than “meh” dps. I’m fine with that, I’ll still show up with as many consumables I can afford each Raid. 
---
I want to be the benchmark on the dps meter for the rest of the guild, in that if you can’t keep up with me, stop phoning it in and get to work! I plan on (playfully) mocking anyone who can’t beat me on the meter to get to work, learn their rotations etc. This won’t matter to all the hardcore guilds, but might serve as a wake up call to players that can’t keep up with me that they need more gear from loot council, better rotations, more consumables, etc. Swing the Light baby!
---
Yeah exactly! Similar to classic, but new! The idea about using unfininished zones is an excellent idea! Mount Hyjal for example
---
I'm not sure how I feel about this bit. I see your point, but someone  could make a point about more casual gearing through BGs and ZG(a very puggable raid once AQ hits).
---
Your argument did hit similar notes to something Ion said recently about the many varied modern gear progression paths though, which is something I think we should avoid emulating too closely.
---
Lol what the hell
---
One of my characters in vanilla was a dwarf rogue. My guild had MC and Ony on farm and we ran BWL every week. My rogue was ALWAYS invited so, for those who believe that you HAVE TO play "the best" race for your class, it's rubbish. Just be good and most importantly, be reliable, and you'll get a raid invite. 
---
I'm looking forward to 1.12 AV
---
People talk about videos like world of roguecraft as proof that rogues will be super op, even though it's my understanding that that video came from a patch that was totally different from how classic will play.
---
My question: what other "such and such is op" memes that get repeated here and on other classic forums refer to items/specs that were nerfed before 1.12?  I specifically want to know if SL lock, shadow priest, and ele shaman, all of which people talk about being just crazy op in some way, were actually as powerful as people are saying in the patch we will be getting.
---
I think phase 5 is fine. I highly doubt many people will care about this set.  Raiders won't bother, and people who don't raid or PvP won't give a shit about content cycles. Very few people will "run out" of content that don't have enough time or interest in Raiding or PvPing 
---
Did you get XP the first time exploring the BGs? 
---
I wasn't thinking about mobs cause there aren't any until AV, which was out of twink consideration, but those definitely do give xp. 
---
Isn't that worse having to mouseover every item to see their stats though? By having the stats written inside the lists you can take a look at everything instantly which I think is much better, unless you're talking about something else?
---
&gt; a more human-esque design usually appeals more to a general audience who isn't deep into lore or fantasy behind a specific race.
---
But dwarves are pretty clearly the more "human" of the two races, no?
---
Oh wow thanks a lot to you and your friends!
---
which engineering items help out in dungeons and raids in classic? in retail I pretty much only use engineering for nitro boosts and goblin glider, which I think were added in wotlk and cata 
---
It's objectively harder to abuse now.
---
Pally and druid more popular than rogue and mage? What?
---
All around me are familiar faces
---
Worn out places, worn out faces.
---
Maaaaaad woooorld.
---
Hey if you go back to any game, normally it’s because you enjoy that game.  Nostalgia is an over used word in this sub. I hope you have a good time x
---
Good points /u/Nickrass /u/Kurthos 
---
The relic is a pretty damn good example of how vanilla itemization went, huh? : )
---
It still amazes my how horde/alliance almost always naturally splits close to 50/50.
---
I raided with a troll hunter and the bow animation is what made me decide to play as a troll. Sadly I hated the crossbow and gun animation. It looks awkward and weird. In conjunction with moving it looks even stranger to run, stop, shoot, run. I dislike it personally, and that is why I am playing as an orc when classic releases.
---
The fact there is no "dungeon" alternative is the reason classic was good. You want good gear? You go out and earn it, not have it handed to you. Giving people catch up gear would be ok if the server had an end date (like tbc launching) but why let people rush to content even if they are behind some hardcore folk. No need to give them catch up gear when there will be nothing to do after they clear naxx. Let people take their time.
---
Need to know what the class call would be for other bosses when they are fighting Nef
---
Man that's awesome.
---
Have the "lets make changes" crowd started up again? This is a no from me.  
---
Personally I think it's fine as is. These sets did what they were supposed to then and they will again: Give non raiders and casual players an extra layer of progression and content. That's it. Nothing more.  
---
I mean you can say what you think would've been better, and you could easily be right. But at the end of the day I'm still all for them making "no changes". This should be a history piece, and needs to be as close as it was to the original Vanilla in 2004.  
---
Some things we have to let go for various reasons. I'm fine with some (loot swapping in raids) and not with others (1.12 AV), but that doesn't mean we should start re-designing the progressive loot system and changing whatever we think didn't work. If we do that we'll end up with some bastard child of Vanilla that no one likes.  
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again. I don't care if it's easily the most awful game design element ever. It should be as it was 2004.
---
Are you trying to bamboozle yourself?
---
Sapper charges in raids, grenades are handy in dungeons (well mostly for tanks) and pvp
---
When I level I usually sell mats only. So mining and skinning, or mining and herbalism. Or enchanting (for disenchant mats) and something.  Fetches a decent amount. 
---
Otherwise I spend too much time leveling a trade that doesn't pay off till I'm later in levels anyways. 
---
I shall be one of those 3 or 4 female dwarves and you will all bow down to us, the superior race of WoW 
---
You can’t cast aimed shot while melded, it was removed really early on
---
Hint : Classic population =/= pserver population.
---
Tbc was great probably would've been better than vanilla if you took out flying. Classes seemed to be better polished, raids were better (imo).
---
Only thing I didnt like in tbc was daily quests but some people enjoy that kind of thing. 
---
Just wish they made more use out of the world pvp areas and encouraged people to go there after leveling.
---
No it was pci since the mobo didn't even have agp despite being the standard for years prior to the purchase. 
---
Real impressive setup. I look forward to seeing what it's like when Classic releases so I can drive my gnomie to the top.
---
LOL.
---
There will be way more hunters and rogues than this.... and mages and warlocks.
---
I wish Warriors were the most played class lol 
---
I hope this gets read, because me and my two friends did something similar and I miss it too.
---
We were all in 8th grade, so we would have sleep overs at my house since they both had laptops and I had a pc. We’d ride our bikes to Rick’s gas station, which was located about 1.5~ miles from my house. I’d always buy a Dr Pepper (I’m a TX boy), a Hostess Apple pie, and either Sun chips or Slim Jims. We’d then take our snacks and ride across the street to the local park and set up at one of the picnic tables and plan out our WoW evenings (dungeons we’d want to run, or go killing hordies, or just general WoW fun discussion).
---
I always loved this, and so did they I’m sure. It really got me in the mood to play WoW then we’d be up all night having a damn good time. Miss those times!
---
LUL I forgot the town was called "Shatt"
---
Thats not what this is showing. This charts shows that druids in total (because there's only one race available to them), are more popular then \*gnome\* mages, and \*human\* mages. But its pretty clear that if you combines both races of mages, they far out numbers druids. The same can be said for rogues. 
---
It shouldn't before phase 2 because majordomo didn't have loot tables until 1.5
---
Can you use skinning in the Druid feral forms?
---
I bet you are happy with the Loot Trading news. :)
---
Thats because it is, my friend!
---
I have no idea what you are talking about. I just did a quick analysis of the raw data and Overall Druid is below both, mage and rogue:
---
* Druid: 9.0 %
---
* Mage: 13.5 %
---
* Rogue 11.3 %
---
It just looks weird on the graph because there are only two races for druids to choose from, thus they are rather large compared to others.
---
Yeah. You bump into Chen in the wc3 frozen throne orc campaign while you're helping build durotar up
---
This has been my biggest issue with modern WoW, why invalidate all of your raid content just to get people to the end sooner (and bored sooner).
---
I've also been a long time rp-pvp player and this decision seems really odd to me. My first ever char was on a pure RP server (this was before there were pvp-rp servers) and logging in for the free weekend I can see that server is still at low pop. The two pvp-rp realms I used are both on high. I'm sure Bliz have the stats though, so I guess the servers I use are outliers.
---
I remember a lot of talk before they first introduced pvp-rp that you needed pvp to be able to really rp which I think still makes sense.
---
It goes back to the release version, which was 1.1.
---
How is it valid if it's false? Activision does not own or have bought Blizzard, it's the other way around. Also, Activision has nothing to do with Blizzards game development and choices in their games.
---
I mean I argue against sharding and was there for the biggest pserver launch as well. I loved it and had a ton of fun in the chaos. 
---
Yeah, but it's the only one that would function at all ^^ So, no balance at all.
---
im worried about the amount of mentaliy unstabble people that want to play Paladin
---
Shadowmeld is really fun to use in PvP as a hunter. Here's just one example.
---
Mage: Frost nova's hunter and starts casting frostbolt in deadzone.
---
NE Hunter: Feign deaths right at the end to cancel the cast.
---
Mage: Haha ok you got me, let's try that again.
---
NE Hunter: Sorry m8 you didn't put me in combat, cancels the frostbolt cast with shadowmeld. Now take your pick of waiting 2 seconds to see me or casting arcane explosion and potentially breaking the nova, the choice is yours.
---
Mage: Motherfucker...
---
What? The game play and rpg elements is what I longed for. I love the graphics of WoW, if it keeps the style of classic but has the option for updated performance within that style im about that. 
---
Removing 40 man raids, changing how objectives in Bags are captured, introduction of resilience and pvp only gear, battlegroups, 
---
The combo of garlic bread, frozen pizzas and peach ice tea makes me think of a simpler time, a time when I slept for 6 hours a day and played WoW for the remaining hours. I was fresh out of national service, it was summer and my studies didn't start until August, my girlfriend was working almost all the time. The perfect time to jump into another world... of warcraft. Especially the garlic bread/ice tea combo is impossible for me to have without feeling immense nostalgia. If I do dive into Classic when it releases, I'm gonna have to find that same store brand ice tea and stock the fridge with it.

Scarshield legion EU represent
---
Druid (9%) is not more popular than rogue (11.3%) and mage (13.5), it just looks that way because of the limit on races (two rather large bars compared to many smaller ones).
---
The number of paladins (and shamans) is rather high though. They are the second most picked in their respective factions. Maybe that is because they are unique to the factions.
---
TBC was just as good as vanilla, IMHO. 
---
WotLK was far inferior to both and I started to lose faith.
---
Cata made me quit the game and lose all hope. 
---
If you want to watch someone do the questline, madseasonshow did a 2 part series on this set too!
---
https://youtu.be/MnzeAk7Urgg
---
Yeah, totally agree. This is the point OP is making in the OP. These sets are not handed to players just that easily, they're gated behind pretty hard content and yes, this what you mention is why they should *not* be released at launch for example. But at the same time as ZG, you still have superior gear from raid, but still hit the sweet spot of finishing these epic D2 quests yield you not optimal, but not totally useless gear (as it will be during phase 5).
---
That’s what I’m talking about!
---
The problem is that compared to any other game, Classsic WoW will have enormous amounts of players who are going in with pre-established friends and guilds. Servers need to be able to have room for people, it would be really bad if tons of players got told "sorry, your guild's server filled up, play on another one." It's kind of a unique situation because nothing like this has been done in a game of this scope. When a whole new game launches, almost nobody has a strong reason to care which server they end up on. With Classic WoW, I estimate that at least a quarter and maybe even half of the initial playerbase already knows who they're going to play with.
---
I'm going stereotypical nelf huntard for Shadowmeld, but if race changes will ever be a thing, I'm sure I'll end up as a dwarf eventually for aesthetic reasons. 
---
Druid can only be one race.  I think you're just not reading the chart correctly.  You should be adding all the races together.
---
Keep in mind those warriors all want to be the same guy and he is not a tank. So we will still need tanks. 
---
I like to play paladin. They are good in tanking dungeon. Retri is a challenge and looks cool with T2. And as healer they are also very good to use.
---
I have a closer look at the data:
---
57(10,90%) - Tank
---
345(65.97%) - Healer
---
121(23.14%)- DPS
---
Holy crap is this ever overblown.
---
OSRS has attracted more people, JaGEx has only recently confirmed that they are actively listening to what players have to say (re: JMods won't reply to this memes) and most of the updates they have released are revered as some of the best content available. The Grand Master quests they've released are extremely difficult and the rewards are significantly less than those released in RS3.
---
While I agree that changes should be scrutinized, to say that it is strictly worse becsuse of a single change is not only extremely subjective, but wrong in the eyes of most of its playerbase.
---
Blizzard is following the same trend, with the team openly communicating in a way that shows they are paying attention to our pleas. There's no need to incite this kind of paranoia. It benefits no one.
---
The chart favors Undead over Orc Warlock.  I don't think this chart caters much to optimal min maxers either way.
---
Yeah I'm more interester in class breakdown than class/race breakdown tbh, but this is still interesting data
---
God I spent so much time in Silithus farming rep!
---
Legolas
---
Because DHs were the "loudest" class to complain to Blizzard about their xmog/weapon options. It's the exact same reason that DKs got a Brutal PvP set (season 4 BC) when the class was released in WOTLK - they complained enough and Blizzard just caved. 
---
Because you like Night Elves.
---
Loss?
---
^^^^wait ^^^^wrong ^^^^meme
---
Ye I think you're right.
---
the main difference with classic is that theres no rush because TBC isn't just around the corner. It would make more sense the for longevity of a classic server to make players go through the content in a linear path.
---
One thing I should note as no one has pointed this out from the survey is that the Horde is slated to be overrepresented in PvP. Filter the raw data by PvP servers and the Horde has a 20-30% numbers advantage. 
---
If you care about abundant world pvp and quick queues, Alliance is the faction to go.
---
I used that on My human warrior in westfall
---
Many horde pick warlock for the theme and style of being demonic/corrupt/evil fitting the lore. And then there are people that pick due to wotf
---
The community really has to appreciate that Vanilla WoW spanned 12 content patches over 2 years. Everyone is going to have person favourite features or content that was there only for some of that time. 
---
The developer's job is to make the content and gameplay the best experience it can be, within the confines of what Vanilla WoW was. Personally, I think the ideology they have worked with has been fantastic. I also think that everyone that is upset that they won't get their exact interpretation of what Vanilla WoW *was* will still try it on launch day and realise that their enjoyment of the game was beyond that particular sticking point.
---
Right? Who wouldn't want to play a dwarf hunter after seeing the classic cinematic (reason my main was one).
---
Enchanting to dis items u get soloing bosses
---
Those shards sell well
---
I'm suprised how many dwarf priests there is compared to humans. Vanilla really was something else. I rarely saw dwarf priests since late tbc and forward.
---
&gt;Activision has nothing to do with Blizzards game development and choices in their games.
---
They absolutely have a say in their choices in the game, what are you talking about, lmao. 
---
It's no coincidence that the game became much more "casuallised" and easy to pick up in late WOTLK (when Activision took over) with LFG, then eventually LFR, flex raiding, personal loot, warforge/titanforge, etc. They're trying to appeal to a largest audience possible by making the game as accessible as possible. 
---
They don't necessarily have a say in game design when it comes to things like "Oh I want a fire raid - make a fire raid Blizzard. Make the Warrior tier set red!"; it's more like "Long time subs are quitting the game - release a welcome-back package/mount/microtransaction/etc. to bring people back."
---
Yeah the problem isn't us in specific, it's an community that tries to have constructive discussion or express differing opinions on reddit.  There has to be room to disagree and express yourself and not just get shouted down by those you disagree with for no reason other than aesthetics or preference. 
---
I don't think anybody has ever cared about racials other than tryhards who suck or guilds literally racing for world first.
---
I signed the petition. Because who doesn't want both of the best aspects in the game?
---
That night elf looks horrid
---
You pretty much sold me on Paladin. I don't have a lot of time to learn a challenging class but still want to play a healer. Free mount, not hard to learn if I want to PvP occasionally, etc. sounds perfect.
---
Yeah come join an normal RP server, you probably won’t even be able to tell the difference between a TP server and a RP PvP server because in the cities will be the same sort of roleplay and you’re also be mercilessly ganked repeatedly in the open world with no way to defend yourself. The fact is if you run around a RP server flagged you’ll get into more fights than you would on any sort of PvP server!
---
Didn’t your mother teach you not to answer a question with another question 
---
I remember flying almost everywhere on my 60% speed white gryphon in tbc. It's faster to ignore mobs and the terrain below.
---
Needs more female Dwarf
---
Here, I did a quick analysis of it, since I wanted to know the same thing: https://imgur.com/a/jgPyMKb
---
I'm not sure I'd play either of them, but Nelfs look cooler to me (IE, they're not human/short human/shortest human) and their starting zone seems cooler than Dun Morough. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
Considering children in video games are usually made invincible to prevent morbid behavior your probably right 
---
Yes being able to go in a straight line without monsters made it better than 100% landspeed mount. 
---
What content gap did AQ fill? Is it a mini tier between BWL and Naxx meant to be fully progressed like them, or is it a catch up of some sort? I didn't play back then but realllllly enjoy the aesthetic of AQ and am dreaming of Scarab Lord if I can NEET out
---
Ok lots of weird responses here. The real reason nelfs are bis hunters on ally is because they have higher base agility than dwarves. It's really not a significant difference but none of the dwarf or nelf racial are relevant in raids so the higher base agility is something
---
Yes. You can skin and herb in druid forms. But you can't mine.
---
I'm pretty certain **Instructor Razuvious** from Naxx would win. He's the boss who hits the hardest - BY FAR - in the whole game. He actually also hits harder than any BC boss, and would one shot full T6 Tanks if he critted. Hence why you have to mind control adds to tank him. From a lore point of view, C'thun is the strongest, though.
---
Remember fury (or was it arms) warriors at the end of the xpac, tanking dungeons with a shield but full dps gear (armorpen OP), with revenge hitting 2 or was it 3 mobs, for up to 18k crits.
---
If this is a troll post - lol. If it's not - no it didn't. 
---
1.10 is D2 there's plenty of time to get the items.
---
So many druids? Definitely not a reflection of the private servers.
---
Pre nerf cata heroics were probably the first time we ever had 5mans that had raid-like abilities, oneshot abilities in a cone like area to avoid, objects to kill or adds to nuke, just like a raid. There were 5mans like that before but it got more defined.
---
Highly doubt its 66% healers.
---
AQ40 is a full raid between BWL and Naxx in terms of difficulty and average gear power level.
---
That isn't him moving the goal post he didn't set a new and higher standard for you to pass.
---
All he said was basically "lol wtf who does that".
---
Lol 90% of those druids will rerroll before 60, just watch. And this is coming from someone whos going to main one.
---
How do you know my mother?
---
Your link is broken for me
---
These need to be in phase 1 to be relevant, and phase 5 to be authentic. IMO phase 1 so these sets ever matter.
---
If anyone quickly wants to see the breakdown for classes per faction, I did a quick analysis in excel.
---
https://imgur.com/a/5RdgleN
---
I created a [Word Cloud](https://i.imgur.com/LvnGRlp.jpg) by analyzing comments in this thread. 
---
It's a fun way to see trends and patterns in the comment section that would otherwise be unclear or difficult to see. 
---
Nah, I see a ton of people glad AV will be 1.12. Probably more people wanting 1.12 AV than not. 
---
I doubt most of them would make it past level 30 anyways
---
Paladins are arguably the best healers in the game in both PvP and PvE, why do you doubt that?
---
pm me also
---
Ok apparently auto mood removes links that contain the names of private servers. But warriors are the most played class, and if you look up the server stats for popular private servers you'll see they are
---
You only need to buy the current expansion as it is. everything up to lvl 110 (end of Legion) you can play as long as you have a sub. 
---
Don't think Blizzard has told us how it's going to be handled. Most likely Classic will be included to any sub, just like all other old expansions. But it's possible they will get greedy and require you to buy access, or even make it an entirely separate subscription. That seems like a bad move though considering how many people that would lock out. 
---
It just looks better for a hunter, bows and stuff
---
it'll look a lot different when pve or pvp server is taken into account.
---
Let me fix that:
---
Mage novas hunter
---
Hunter faps
---
Mage dies.
---
I am more worried about the mentally unstable bears playing druid. :V
---
Try again, I reuploded it because I was not happy with the first version. Thus, I had to update the link.
---
Master magi is gonna try to answer everything:    
---
1. The good thing about the Whip Lashers is that you don't need any talent at all to kill them (besides Ice Barrier if you are low-geared).   
---
 The problem with what you asked is that you can't fit everything you want into one build because when it comes to PvE you'll need either a WC build or an Arcane/Frost build that goes deep into Arcane Power which you can't mix with a PvP build, now if you plan on being in a casual guild you can still raid with a PvP spec (which I would recommend you to use) it will still grant you okay DPS in raid and will have the talents you need for PvP.    
---
 You can check out the "Classic PVP" Discord which lists a few PvP builds for each class, this talent build suits what you are asking for: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0Ab0bZZViGhRbtbo 
---
 It comes with a description:
---
&gt; Frost BG spec, once you get enough hit from gear (4%) you switch the points in Elemental precision to improved cone of cold.
---
 There you go, I hope it helped!
---
2. The reason why you don't see anything PvP related in my guide is because I'm not a good enough PvP player to tell people what to do, I'm gonna include the PvP items into the Pre-raid and Raid BiS lists but that's about it, I don't feel comfortable trying to "teach" people things that I don't know much about myself. 
---
 Hence why I suggested you a PvP build I didn't make myself, I had to trust somebody else who is actually good at PvP, his name is Kraun btw.
---
3. I actually considered adding more options but I figured that it wasn't a good idea (besides of course replacing items such as "of frozen wrath" gear which are an exception) and the reason for that is because most of the Pre-raid BiS item drops from a dungeon and you shouldn't try to aim for anything easier to get, getting a dungeon item is already very easy to farm and aiming for anything else would not be worth it, also another exception being the Robe of the Archmage, this item is so good that everyone SHOULD get this item and nothing else (Farming for the Robe of Winter Night would be a massive waste of materials/gold for example). 
---
 TLDR is that I'm trying to push people into getting the best items as long as it doesn't require an insane amount of farming.
---
 I had a hard time trying to word that correctly so I hope you'll understand.
---
4. I think you are asking yourself the wrong question, instead of thinking "how much of X and Y stat should I aim for" you should aim for gathering all the gear listed in the Pre-raid and Raid BiS lists. Kind of a weird question I'm not sure what to say about that. :\
---
5. I don't really know, you'll end up being out of bag space very quickly while farming Maraudon so any extra loot would be wasted, unless you plan on picking up one of the professions you listed and you'll destroy mob's loot to make room for either herbs or skins, so basically if your goal is to make money I think you're better off just killing and looting mobs, if you're only here for the skins or herbs though well sure you can level up your professions that way but I don't think it's gonna be as lucrative as straight up looking the mobs and selling what you get from them.
---
6. The reason why I have Frosbite is because that's a talent you're gonna pick up early in the leveling process, you're not gonna respec for DME as it doesn't require any build in particular to run as I said earlier in the post.
---
 Plus killing the Lashers using the Blizzard method isn't really doable because of the lack of space around you and even if you can you'll kill them slower than you would using the mid-range AoE method as I'm doing in the video. 
---
 I actually talk about Frostbite in the video at 8:20.
---
 When it comes to the tomes I can't really tell people where they are considering the tome's spawn placement aren't Blizzlike, I don't want to give private server data as odds are a lot of it is inaccurate to the original game (only the mob's placement, level and pathing are Blizzlike, the rest isn't).
---
I'm sorry I can't fully answer all your questions, I tried my best though.
---
What’s the point of this video?
---
Portraying an addiction? We’ve all been there.
---
My classmates used to mock me, distancing themselves because I played a game.
---
My IRL friends were not really considering me as a friend. And you know what? That’s fine.
---
Brought a gold swimming medal for my school, nobody cared, I was the nerd. And that’s fine.
---
Now I look back 10 years ago, working as Lead Software Engineer, owning a house, two cars and a holiday home. I know I shouldn’t compare to other people but damn it feels good to see that I am further than any of them and so don’t care. I am the nerd :)
---
Yep, it's all good now
---
Why are troll hunters below orc, dwarf, and nelf hunters? Trolls are by far the bis hunters because of bow spec + berserking.
---
Hunter has to use FAP in advance because it won't remove nova. But yes using FAP wrecks frost mages.
---
:) 
---
Agree completely. It didn't matter at the time that the endgame progression curve was shortened so much because Blizzard were going nuclear and creating a totally blank slate a few months down the road.
---
You made friends in starting zones because there weren't thousands of players crammed into the Valley of Trials or whatever. WoW becomes borderline unplayable under those conditions. I played retail vanilla too and the game launched with a relatively small playerbase, then grew steadily throughout 2005-09. You cannot base your opinion on experiences that bear absolutely no resemblence to the likely situation at the launch of Classic. That's how you get uninformed, incorrect opinions.
---
Druid is not more popular, neither in the game nor in this particular graph. You gotta add all the mages while you probably compare it to a single race.
---
I need to buy BFA?
---
&gt;Besides, I don't think Classic is free with a retail sub. I think a Classic sub includes retail for free. Just like OSRS membership comes with RS3 for free.
---
Uh.. that's the same thing? 
---
If a classic sub includes retail, a retail sub also contains classic. lol. Or are you suggesting they will make a classic sub cost more than just a retail sub?
---
nope. most of the time the useful set for your class isnt the one its meant for. things like 6peice dreadmist for mages, 6pc magisters for warlocks, shadowcraft for ferals/hunters
---
the boe items atleast on private servers are VERY cheap usually 1-2g because of how hard ppl spam dungeons for prebis(especially ubrs)
---
Well because then it would be impossible for anyone that starts later to actually compete in current PvE encounters. And it would only accumulate during the years of WoW life.
---
Imagine everyone having yo go through all traid tiers now to be able to get to the latest one (it's what, 20?). 
---
Of course there is a sweet spot in between though, and I think it has to have these qualities:
---
1) getting the catch-up gear through quality and interesting content
---
2) the catch-up gear has to be not-optimal, not overshadowing the current raid content
---
3) it has to be not easy to get it, it has to be gated behind somewhat hard content, not just handed away for free. Just saving you the ridiculous amounts of time it would take to catch up farming older, obsolete raid tiers
---
The D2 quest-chains have all three I think, so I really think releasing it alongside, or before ZG would be optimal.
---
That's exactly what I meant. There is nothing to be surprised about. Wow Classic is primarily an RPG game, where you choose a race and a class mainly because of its fantasy and what it means to you, and other subjective things like that.
---
Being surprised only means that one thinks that Classic will be similar to pservers, which it will not be the case obviously.
---
I lol'd seeing those Ice Threaded Arrows sticking out of rag...  man i hope they put that bug back in classic
---
Jimmy noooooo!
---
Yeah learning to gem and pot EARLY to get a second one before the fight was over, using arcane missiles on a clearcast if you were ooming too fast.
---
Some mages didn't downrank and summon more mana gems.
---
You only need to buy BfA if you want to play BfA. Everything else is "free" with your subscription. 
---
But we don't know how Classic will be handled. 
---
Wankers like to blueshield and wait until you're low then attack
---
&gt; Was the beginning of the end mechanic-wise imo
---
It's gear that eliminates mechanics.  There's no discussion to be had that pve mechanics have gotten more sophisticated since Vanilla.
---
&gt; solo'ing dungeons isn't something you really do.
---
yea it is

sometimes wanding is a good thing.

Its partially due to them being the most widely requested raid/pvp healers in the game.
---
&gt; No Bloodelfs and Draenei as playable races (so no Paladin for Horde, no Shaman for Alliance)
---
While I agree in principle, Horde Paladins and Alliance Shamans were almost inevitable. For every single encounter, dungeon and raid in the game, the designers had to take into account how it would work with and without those classes. What do you do if a Paladin or Shaman ability make an encounter significantly easier? Do you tune the encounter differently for each faction?
---
And this problem arises again with each change to either class, or to any encounter. It's always a problem, and there are only two solutions. Give up on the exclusivity, or don't design any encounters where Shamans or Paladins are relevant. The latter is worse in my opinion.
---
&gt; All of the 60 content still stays relevant.
---
There are two problems with that. One, you are spreading out the players over more content. Two, *how* is that supposed to work? If you have three raids on Naxx difficulty, what about the 95% who don't raid or haven't cleared AQ40 (or even BWL)?
---
There has to be some jump in item quality. I think the problem was that it was *too big*. I was heartbroken to replace an epic with a green item in Hellfire Peninsula at level 62 or whereabouts. I never was at Naxx, but I still feel the game made my gear obsolete too quickly.
---
With that and the catch-up items, Molten Core will become irrelevant with a cap of 60 or 70.
---
One last thing: with no level ups, how do you give people new spells and things like that to try out? Even more ability drops? They were *okay*, but if we have a lot of them, and better equipment, it's just a less fixed levelling system in practice. And then, I honestly prefer to see a level 65 and know that I can go with him to the haunted dungeon of villainy, instead of having to ask a level 60 how far into TBC content he is.
---
Is there anyway one of you could make a community in form of a form as well as discord? I think it's way easier for Blizzard to see all the members and such that way. If not, send me a PM and I'll see what I can do :)
---
So 30.000 warriors left on the lc 19 bracket 
---
What trends or patterns do you see from a word cloud?
---
That's how it works on retail. Just fyi. 
---
There are limited benefits to having access to rank 14 weapons. But very limited.  Ashjre'thul ftw
---
Fucking madlad taking a screenshot before clicking that flag. 
---
I’m going that route. Was 1st ever Character I made and stopped at level 40 and rolled a Warlock. This time I’m going to play it through
---
For me a big loss over the years was the old talent trees. Maybe I'm an outlier here, but I just like spending points in trees and tweaking and tinkering to get a build I'd personally find enjoyable. Talent points would also be a small reward every time you leveled up, whereas with the current system you get that reward every 10 or 15 levels.
---
From what I remember one of the reasons they wanted to get rid of the old talent trees was that Blizzard didn't seem to like cookie cutter builds. Those still exist with the current system though, it's entirely possible to spec in a way that is quite suboptimal, and in some cases a talent simply dominates the tier and becomes the default choice 99% of the time. They never really fixed the cookie cutter problem (I don't really consider it a problem though), but the attempt did remove that aspect of character customisation / individuality from the game I really enjoyed.
---
In Cataclysm they reduced the number of talent points by half, so you'd get one every other level, which I can kind of understand if you get 100+ points to spend, but that was about as much compromise as I was able to appreciate in the talent department. I think they also made it so you couldn't go into a second tree until you reached the top talent in one tree, which also removed some individuality from the talent system. 
---
tl;dr Old talent system should've been tweaked rather than nuked.
---
Most paladins will either stop or reroll once they realize  dumb raids will take them
---
I still remember he whole LOLRET that lasted all the way to 3.0
---
It's all about the racical. Fear Ward was so good
---
Troll mage pom pyroing a fool and an undead in bloodfang stalking a gnome priest (the last of his kind), now that would be sick.
---
so cool. thank you for taking the time to post here, your grace. 
---
&gt; for those who believe that you HAVE TO play "the best" race for your class, it's rubbish
---
but you WERE playing the best race for your class!
---
This is a non issue. Keep scrolling.
---
\&gt;&gt;NEW&lt;&lt;
---
Looks
---
Better base agility, better synergy with pets and nature lore-wise, better fit for shooting a bow (only handful of guns in the game), aesthetics and shadowmeld (combo with cat with stealth + shadowmeld)
---
The only druid looks like it is high on the list is because there is only 1 race per faction. Still the lowest represented class.
---
Vanilla priests were mostly human, with night elf and dwarves being fairly rare. IMO, dwarves were probably the rarest type of priests. 
---
It’s the min-maxiness of current day that makes the dwarf priest population skyrocket. Although, I’d be interested to see how many people think they’re going dwarf and then deciding otherwise. 
---
I have tasted this meme and can confirm that is authentic WoW trolling.
---
Oh it does, we are gunna see this turn nasty pretty much the first time someone tries to do it.
---
The sort answers is because all the Role Players are on Argent Dawn/Moonguard/Whryne Rest Accord.
---
Class they’re playing? No. Role they’re playing in the group yes. 
---
Spec you’re grouped as &gt; off spec &gt; greed
---
For example, If you’re a Druid healer and need roll on my rogue gear I’m gonna be pissed. If you’re there as a cat DPS or bear tank its fair game. 
---
So is 7 mil players the magic number we're trying to hit?  Bring on the William Shatner commercials!
---
Over 7 million online?
---
Not anymore.
---
For the Alliance!
---
They were really great though.  Its really too bad Blizzard caved into whatever it was that pressured them into going a different direction.  I really, really enjoyed the on release cata heroics.  I got through them all pre-nerf and I was having a blast! 
---
Because a bunch of those are probably Retri Paladins, Ench Shaman, Feral Druids, and Shadow Priests. Just look at the data, Undead Rogue isn't the ideal choice for PvE, it's a PvP choice. Troll and Orc would both be much better. It's also why Orc Warrior is higher than Tauren (though Human is probably ideal choice for tank and DPS on alliance).
---
What so explosions taste like?  
---
No flying, no level increase, keep the world small, no power creep, no overbalancing.
---
The last two are easy to say but hard to do.  Maybe if they focused more on class identity rather than homogeneity.
---
Power creep is hard to avoid because people want to move forward and feel stronger for their time invested.  Flushing out alternative items and sets could have helped delay the creep.
---
But don't you need to somehow encourage harassment to a user? How would you link the in game character name to be blacklisted to a reddit user for that harassment to take place? I think that rule is there to discourage harassment towards reddit users and not blacklisting wow characters. But hey, I could be wrong.

kinda like this but swapping 2 impconeofcold into the mana reduction talent
---
Paladin for life. We dont play for fun, we play to purge the unclean.
---
No, it's just that everyone that picked druid can only choose one race, night elf. So all druid picks are centered on that. Warrior for example is top, but there's also 4 other warrior races.
---
[Druid is actually the least picked of all classes.](https://imgur.com/a/5RdgleN)
---
The sound of all those Shadowmelds was a spine tingler.
---
Ya, routinely used normal forum formatting :D
---
thanks!
---
Oooh right, yeah that makes sense.
---
Ugh that intro, shortly into it you always hear MILORD cause you gotta put them peasants to work. I'm really looking forward to it coming out on GOG whenever the hell that happens.
---
Two guys I knew and played with died, one was the guild master of one of the best guilds on the server from Vanilla through to wrath, always competing for server first (and getting some), I wasn't in his guild but I played arena with him, sometime into wrath he committed suicide, his guild wasn't the same after that (understandably) and eventually crumbled and died, he was a real character and infamous on the server, people had mixed opinions about him because he was a very strict leader, if you made a mistake playing with him you would know about it, but he had a lot of respect on the server and was a pure winner, amazing guy and a real shame he was obviously living a life of depression, his death actually hit me pretty hard which was surprising to me, I only played with him occasionally and didn't know him on a real personal level, I think it was because he was asking me to play a few days before it happened and I kept saying I wasn't up for it.
---
The other was a few years later, another guild master, this time of the guild I was in from the start of tbc to late wotlk when I stopped playing until late cata, not an amazingly competitive guild, but a very social casual guild in which we were all pretty close and he was the main man, everyone looked up to the guy as sort of a father figure (he was much older than us, in his 40's), he died of heart attack in his sleep out of the blue on night after we'd stopped playing. It did bring all the members back together on a group chat that still goes on to this day though. 
---
I don't know, last private server I raided on had 6 Fury Warriors and 3 Prot Warriors in my guild.
---
It's pretty much just like Trial of the Crusader
---
I quite liked 1.12 AV. I didn't have all day to play, and it was nice to get a game done in 20-30 minutes.
---
Oh yeah yeah
---
I have to disagree. Gear makes things easier but it can't make up for player ability and matchup knowledge. You are right that some classes are more gear dependand than others in PvP though.
---
Also I didn't say anything about competitive fairness. I don't know how PvP plays out in retail, but vanilla PvP was never about fairness and competitiveness. Still, BGs provide a fast paced PvP centric experience and that is what I like about them.
---
This is not my experience on private server.
---
A lot of the new content will be catch up content so naxx level content will get more accesible.
---
I don't think MC will become totally obsolete. There just will be more options for gearing up. 
---
I don't actually think there should be a lot of new abilities. This will just overload classes. Some new abilities should drop, yes, but that's it. Vanilla had the right amount of spells imo.
---
Well we were talking about leveling, pretty much everything you listed here requires T1/T2 gear or not killing anything at all. Even BRD 2 boss (I assume it's Loregrain and barman) need some gear to kill reliably. By "solo'ing dungeons" I meant killing the bosses to get the blues to desenchant so maybe that wasn't clear. 
---
I'd definitely take enchant as a hunter solo'ing tribute but for a rogue at 60 I know I want engineering and I'd rather have herbing or mining instead of enchanting, but then again it depends on what you do at 60, what you want and whether you have profession alts. 
---
I just think it's stupid that you can be excited about rolling a troll or a night elf and people will come in and be like "Why the fuck would you ever do that if you could roll Orc/Dwarf instead?" as if you're an idiot for making the character you want to play. I think there's a decent amount of casual animosity towards hardcore players (esp min/maxers), but I see far more judgement coming from the other direction.
---
That isn’t balanced out by the dwarf +gun ability?
---
Are you responding to the right comment?
---
Wonder why Horde Warlock is so high.
---
Troll hunters look badass doh. 
---
There is only 2 other BGs. AV already is exactly what you describe, but instead of being a zergfest that can last for a day it will last for an hour or a couple of hours.
---
Feet
---
Theres no raid drop/high tier guns in the game unfortunately. Maybe if wow goes to 1.13 or something dwarf racial will be op but for now everything is either a bow or xbow. Similar for story for orcs because all the top tier melee weapons happen to be swords
---
Reminds me of one of [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_2sJ0hmU2s) own great moments
---
Elfless Horde, take me home
---
Nostalgia is great but it’s literally the best game ever made and it’s fun and rewarding so I’m SO glad we are getting this, and will be excited to play a living version of it with other people who are just as excited!
---
I always loved the [Moist Towelette](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5951/moist-towelette).
---
Cleans with the power of lemon!
---
Probably because undead is horde and undead warlock is, just from a fantasy perspective, the dream combo.
---
The data backs that up, too.
---
There’s no good guns at 60. It’s crossbows (and Rhok’Delar) all the way, unless you get unlucky and don’t get Ashjre’Thul by the time you get to Ouro. 
---
Oh my god. I want to play WSG again! I wanted to play classic as much as another guy but I have seem to forgot how epic WSG was.
---
But why would I choose to go to MC, just to gear up for BWL and AQ40, instead of using the catch-up mechanics in the first place? Sounds a lot easier.
---
Vanilla had enough spells, I agree. But in the end, how long can you pad those spells? How many raids and dungeons do you want to play without changes in how the classes work?
---
I think it could work for one expansion, but at some point people want new content. I don't think it's possible to keep everything relevant. Classic is already a huge game. If you add to it, at some point, something will have to become obsolete – or some things have to be exchangeable, which leads to the scaling nightmare we see in BfA.
---
Short capes are still too short on gnomes. =\
---
No flying no lfg no xrealm 
---
We all know about the debuff limit, but what I'm trying to remember is if there was a Player Buff Limit. Was it also 8/16? I seem to remember buffs being active even if not showing on your bar, but I"m not clear on what that total was. 
---
Jimmy yes!
---
Not to mention they had continent-spanning empires.
---
Not by far, and orcs are broken in PVP. Berserking isn’t as big of a DPS increase. 
---
blacklisting is "targeted harassment campaigns via denial of service" It has the same exact pitfalls as say, showing a video of someone speedhacking. The potential for you to alter the evidence so that they appear to be ninjas is there so it has the same problem.
---
No flying, no LFD, no LFR, make Outland much smaller (maybe only couple of zones for highest levels), definitely without a "main city", expand more zones in old continent + then Northrend as it was during WotLK. No cash-shop, no boosting, keep old talent system, keep old RPG elements.
---
There, fixed.
---
Ah, makes sense. Sucks there aren’t high end guns, though. I played dwarf hunter in Vanilla and basically refused to use bows because they didn’t pew pew enough for me. 
---
In very certain situations, yes. I'm no expert, but here's how I'm looking at it
---
Elemental shaman are a beast in PvP, but their problem is their low mana pool and high mana cost spells. They have several instant cast spells that could deal a lot of damage, and utility like grounding totem and tremor totem. But they don't have any stuns, disorientation or any viable escape. It's also very hard to get good gear on elemental shaman early on without sacrificing mail for cloth.
---
Rogues are ... balanced. If you were to play a rogue with preparation, you have the ability to refresh all your cooldowns and could solo anyone 100% with little to no gear. This means double vanish, double blind, double sprint, double evasion and double cold blood. The down side? They lack in everything else. They do the least amount of damage out of all the rogue specs, and if they don't have preparation up, they're not that useful or special. Extremely good solo potential, but that's it.
---
I could go on about SL lock and shadow priest, but not rogues, elemental shaman or any other class or talent spec are particularly overpowered in a sense. They're all very situational.
---
WSG with pugs - you enter and then find a spot to hide which you can't find because that premade will come on the roof too. So cool... if they don't do anything about rank12-13 premades on classic, it will be the same shit all over again like on private servers...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/
---
The faction ratio is entirely dependant on the server. The big one atm has more Alliance but its previous iteration had more Horde. 
---
I thought BC was pretty good, and think Wrath only had minor problems (didn't play wrath myself though). 
---
But overall, up to this day, here are some of my thoughts:
---
The automatic LFG tools are bad, and removes the requirement for any social interaction to a large portion of the game. On the other hand I have almost only positive things to say about the modern LFG "board" thing, where you apply to groups manually. 
---
Cross realm stuff, especially sharding, is incredibly bad for the server communities. You no longer feel any ties to your server outside of rankings on raider.io or whatever. 
---
Making much of the early-game content extremely trivial did a similar thing as the lfg-system did. It removed the need for really playing during large portions of the game. It's not until you go into what is currently mythic dungeons or heroic raids that you actually have to know how to play the game at all. 
---
At the same time, level scaling like they are currently doing on retail removes any sense of progression, which is not ideal either, despite making the game "harder" as you can no longer outlevel things. 
---
Needing to invest less time into the game to accomplish things made it less rewarding when you actually accomplish stuff. 
---
I strongly disagree with what some people in here are saying about tying expansions into the old world. I think making each expansion function almost entirely separate from the previous ones would preserve much more of that "vanilla" feeling. Having to go do old content just for the sake of it doesn't sound very rewarding to me. There's a reason I'm not hunting down transmog or mounts or whatever on retail. 
---
Well, catch up means it healps you catching up. There is good gear there, but in the new dungeons/raids is also good gear. You can run them alll to gear up faster and "catch up"
---
You could design raids and dungeons in a way that players were forced to use other spells than usual.
---
I agree, this wouldn't work for one expansion. But it would be very interesting to see how a expansion with a horizontal design philosophy would turn out in practice.
---
&gt;Also, what profession fetches the most gold? I was a mining/smith last time i played (about 6mo before tbc release), and i dont remember it being very lucrative.
---
Herbalism is the gathering proff that fetches the most gold. From there it's a matter of opinion, if you're very lazy then skinning, if you're not lazy but don't want to invest a fortune to start making money then alchemy, and last there's enchanting, where if you're SUPER invested you can make a lot of money, but for 95% of players it's not going to be worth it.
---
In short, for gold the average player should go herb/skinning until 60 and then drop skinning for alch.
---
That depends entirely on the server. 
---
I honestly don’t get the thought behind playing ret. Is it just stubbornness? You aren’t useful in the raid aside from buffing which you could do as any other spec. You aren’t even good at PvP. Why do you even take the gear? If you were holy you could actually be useful in PvP and PvE, if you were prot you could at least farm solo content or run 5-mans. But being ret you’re just gimping yourself and the team to be special. If it’s an RP thing I guess? 
---
You said it yourself “everyone likes him” that sounds like it’s being used as a justification to let him do whatever he wants and soak up loot. You said yourself you resented him for taking your gear at times. I bet the whole raid resents this guy silently because apparently your GM has a vice grip on all your balls to keep you all from voicing any concerns about his buddy. 
---
Your comparison of a ret pally to a half-afk hunter isn’t that compelling either. Just swap him out for a hunter who’s actually paying attention. 
---
And you can talk about “breaking the game” as if bringing more fury warriors is cheating once you have naxx on farm.  Maybe there’s a reason you aren’t progressing that far with a raid full of dead weight taking gear from those who could use it to make the raid better. 
---
That only says Race and class i only want the class
---
Hahaha, it was unnerving.
---
Now multiply this by every person that whispers this to the loot master and now he has to run an auction house for every item off every boss taking 15 minutes just to loot bosses. Versus, let the guy who won the item handle it while the rest of the raid moves along.
---
Cool.
---
WHAT? Where do they say this? You mean I don't need to BUY the game, I could just start a subscription and I'm good to go?
---
also itemized so poorly that mages would use the bracers and nothing else through all or some patches. I always thought of it as a cosmetic set, even my 60 friend told me while leveling that it wasn't worth it but he was raiding MC and BWL was out.
---
Very thorough answer. Thank you a LOT dude! Warrior/lock/paladin/rogue/mage/hunter are out of the picture by now. Leaning towards a shaman.  How is priest, shadow priest and druid gearing? 
---
Lmao, dat stun.
---
You didn't include warlock :(
---
oh sry
---
Undead are pretty much popular because they're the least monstrous of the Horde races in terms of proportions and how gear fits on them. Going from Vanilla to TBC Private Servers their population tends to fall a lot with the introduction of Blood Elves, at least from my experience.
---
I'm just being fecetious and posting my distaste for the direction retail wow is going, is all. 
---
I don't get the attitude. I'm just giving him my piece as someone who has accepted ret paladins in my raiding guild.
---
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm
---
I agree - but if I'm playing a holy priest looking for shadow/spell-dmg gear, I will tell the group before-hand that I'm rolling need on that, I expect no drama. 
---
What sucks is...there's still drama.  
---
I'm probably going to roll feral and play super casual and expect to have to heal now and then and I will do the same thing. I'm sure every hunter, warrior, and rogue will be pissed about it even with the heads up given beforehand.
---
Well I usually player in a premade so.....yeah. Tough luck :)
---
Smoke a fat joint while logging in, the best ritual 
---
You're arguing literally nothing atm. Everyone who cares knows what blizzard uses. If you don't like that well known and widely used fact, take it up with them. 
---
Every other class thread here is a druid thread, for some reason.
---
Glad you agree. 
---
yeah but alot of people still dont know it dosent take that into account
---
I mean yeah, just ask Joe Rogan.
---
You can't accept quests from a hostile faction NPC. There are however many neutral NPC of every race that are not bound to any faction and therefore can give out quests to both factions. But general thumb, you can't do Alliance quests, and Alliance can't do Horde quests.
---
Mining is good for Arcanite bars, Truesilver, Thorium Bars and Dark Iron. In that order of value. Mining is not that lucrative compared to other gatherer professions, but Smithing is really lucrative if you can get the right plans to craft
---
Of course but this is the global trend. Not to mention in guild recruitment discords, there's generally 2x the amount of Horde guilds recruiting for PvP.
---
A lot of these sound familiar, sweet list definitely gonna keep it on tabs. I was watching Kargoz' hunter guide video he just released, he was saying that the beaststalker set is preraid bis as a complete set o.O its a good hour video, a lot of it I already knew but some things were new to me, like raptor strike can be used over any melee ability, which would make a good macro
---
Are you going to level subtlety to 60? You're going to have a bad time
---
Haha, do you recognize the icons for my melee weapons?   
---
(Middle horizontal bar, left most button, above Rapt. + left most vertical bar, bottom button, below Tranq)  
---
And that's corpse is wearing rank 13 armor :)  
---
Are you taking 3 weeks vacation when it gets released?
---
Why punish the players that made the effort to group up and play together ? 
---
Great Work, would it also be possible to show the numbers on PvP and PvE Servers per Faction? I think this is where we see a lot of differences.
---
Except for paladins which laugh at Viper sting
---
It’s kinda like throwing a coin a huge amount of times, it ends up normalizing and the results will be as close to being 50/50.
---
&gt; Well we were talking about leveling, pretty much everything you listed here requires T1/T2 gear or not killing anything at all. Even BRD 2 boss (I assume it's Loregrain and barman) need some gear to kill reliably. 
---
some are in normal blues
---
&gt;I'd definitely take enchant as a hunter solo'ing tribute but for a rogue at 60 I know I want engineering and I'd rather have herbing or mining instead of enchanting, but then again it depends on what you do at 60, what you want and whether you have profession alts.
---
I wont tryhard in pvp
---
&gt;Also frozen rune stealth farm should be possible in Naxx patch. 
---
yeah  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QximOcF5T8 in all 240p glory
---
They're space-goats you uncultured swine.
---
I'm rolling ally off the fact that IF has the best handout spot and soundtrack.
---
I forgot about that class (I’m Horde)
---
The boat from Auberdine to Stormwind wasnt added until WotLK. Classic immersion RUINED. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
This is true, I played one...but you go OOM very, very, very, very quickly and then you're fucked.  Better have a mage as a best friend because you will sucking down a metric fuckton of water.
---
Personally, I think Warlocks are the most OP
---
Dont confuse tbc mechanics with what retail is now. Apples and oranges. 
---
TBC made many hybrid specs viable and opened up the game to so much more variety. You didnt need to be a mage/warr/rogue/healer to be viable in end game.
---
Even wotlk was fine. It was the shit they did after wotlk that took homogenization way too far. Every class had the same type of cd's and cc, but with a different name.
---
I agree in principle that class mechanics should stay unique. TBC had its warts, like every xpac and vanilla, but let's not pretend for a second it was responsible for homogenizing the classes.
---
Jesus the amount of human warriors and human paladins scare me. 
---
Wpvp is usually a filler when bgs arent popping.
---
What you are looking at would probably be adding queing from anywhere in world, not only from battlemasters.
---
That would raise the wpvp activity the most. (i played on one PS that implemented queing via command and had huge positive reactions)
---
Not this hunter! (....who happens to alt casual feral Druid and completely understands)
---
I wonder how many they actually have now.
---
lol it’s their only optimal spec so yes the non-morons will all go holy. 
---
Weeeelll.... I think you're trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. "Targeted harassment" at who? Reddit users? Users in completely different environments outside of where the rule applies? "Denial of service" to who and which service? It can get very technical and very specific real quick.   
---
What I mean by all this is I can use that description to easily fit my argument as well. I'd rather just stick to the original description on this subreddit which is " Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community."  
---
I'm not sure blacklisting a name falls under that category until a mod says otherwise or I see the consequences. Thanks for the heads up tho.
---
Gotta have a social life to lose it.. *taps head
---
I am honestly shocked by this, While its not a private servers data and the two are completely different but it is interesting to see the trends compared to Private servers normally you would see Human Warrior -&gt; Gnome Mage -&gt; Dwarf Priest as the top three and Paladin and druid always down the bottom as the least played classes.
---
I wonder if this means more people are willing to play these classes from experience on Private servers or if people coming from retail who haven't stepped into private servers want to continue their class fantasy they have been playing the past couple of years.
---
I kind of hope WOW classic turns into an alternate timeline for the game. I’d like to see changes and new expansions in the vain of classic. 
---
Deus Ex... ?
---
But there’s a lot of difference between the two. Including an entire class. It’s not like flipping a coin at all. More like asking people if they want chocolate or vanilla ice cream and somehow ending up with a completely even distribution.
---
In the demo it was the same as Legion with some features deleted IIRC.
---
The UI in Classic WoW uses the same API as the one in Legion so I’m certain they will be recreated. Vanilla UI was horrible and I certainly wouldn’t mind a newer improved UI.
---
So many classes are good in pvp it really depend on so many factors.
---
I personally I think I will play shadow priest too in pvp, mage hunter and warrior are very tempting too.
---
LH is the only server to be Alliance favored to this point, the last two were Horde favored. This doesn't matter anyhow, as private servers aren't indicative of how retail servers will be. For some reason you are bad at understanding what a trend is (as you said, you are clueless) but expect these numbers to be accurate for the majority of servers - pretending I said that it will be the case for every server is a bizarre assumption, rather than speaking about an average. You can view the raw data of the survey and parse it yourself for the same results, it's not hard.
---
Guild recruitment discord: 15 Horde PvP guilds, 8 Alliance PvP. 5 Alliance PvE, 0 Horde PvE. This will scale with release.
---
no it’s not. it’s not random. it’s driven by choice. some races are way more popular. they just happen to be surprisingly well distributed among the factions. 
---
That’s why I said *kinda*. And if you ask that question to a bunch of people the results will also end up normalizing. That is because there are so many individual and subjective factors for each person, that each person considers, it ends up making it irrelevant.
---
Ooooh! “We could afford to eat nothing but fast food and what not” its reads ambiguously. Could mean thats all you could afford or you could afford to eat only that. But STILL!!! I hate when people say that!
---
Right. When I play rogue I really want to try hard wpvp so I even consider pairing engineering with BS for the anti-fear trinket lol. 
---
I guess for making consistent gold at 60 enchant can be a good choice but so is alchemy for example (if you plan to take enchant/herb). Also, I’m not sure but can’t you trade your blues in the “will not be traded” window and get them des? I have a doubt. 
---
As for frozen runes it should be doable but I think it will save you to the ID, and more people will know about it so it could sell for less than it used to. 
---
No no, wowhacks was the forum I think you wanted. Big tauren / classic brown WoW themed website that was just a vbulletin msg board.
---
BGs were in the game since vanilla, same with cross-realm, and there was still tons of Wpvp all the time, so I think you may be blowing that out of proportion.
---
day late dollar short, the other million youtube stars already covered this
---
Yes since it’s that class. However, for rogues shadowcraft isn’t even bis. 
---
we talking about bgs? or 1v1?
---
Recently on a private server I respecced at level 16 and it was 1g not 1s. This was a brand new character as well. 
---
If the honor system only works with world pvp, wouldn’t that be a big enough drive for most players to wpvp? And if specific armour sets to each battlegrounds wasn’t enough to keep the queue popping, maybe make the BGs crossrealm (i do see why a lot of people wouldn’t like that though). Definitely see your point though
---
dwarf rogue so underrated
---
it will looke like 55-45
---
Please tell me yours is going to be "Superkamiguru"
---
warcraft magic
---
You know this is classic right? I maybe saw 1 feral druid in all my time in vanilla. A handful of enhance shamans. Most those classes go healing because it's their only viable raid spec. 
---
Here ya go: https://imgur.com/a/LFn3Jtc
---
Is ambushing some poor sap in STV who’s too busy fighting a tiger considered a 1v1?
---
Shadowmeld
---
average reddit user is hardcore... lol
---
Got the same problem with gnomes
---
need a gnome war mage and rogue wtf
---
Its the forums bias
---
people on forums are more knowledgeable, tryhard
---
the real world numbers will look much different
---
Define pvp...
---
1v1s, premade/solo que BGs, world pvp, twinking?
---
Different classes excel at different types of pvp.
---
Hi, /u/Zoldra0
---
Here you go: https://imgur.com/a/UpyO3fR
---
which is funny cuz thats when they pick up steam
---
The daily "which class will you play" poll...
---
Races are not the only thing a player would consider. I agree it’s driven by choice though, but each individual has such a different choice thought process it may as well be random, it’s just too many factors like which race a friend will play, class, guilds, stuff like that. It may as well be random.
---
That just proves both choices ends up being equally attractive which translates to well rounded balancing overall. As I’ve said before, emphasis on *kinda*.
---
That may have changed at some point but in vanilla you had to be nearby to even see an item dropped.
---
tank arent in much demand for raids cuz the gms officers the guys who run the guild normally play tanks
---
No vanilla and PS experience even remotely compares to the inflated dwarf priest stat. Feels funny, knowing the majority wont reach 60
---
S-Priest is one of the best 1v1 classes. Just be prepared to drink for mana after you kill someone.
---
We’re progressing pretty fast for how recently we started. I only made my toon in January, and the raid team is largely full of fresher 60s in blues and MC gear. This retadin is one of the few dps in purples.
---
The reason we haven’t progressed further has everything to do with the logistics of farming Naxx attunements in a given amount of time etc and nothing to do with Vanilla raid difficulty (lol!) or bringing some sub-optimal specs. Nothing’s *actually* hard enough in this game to warrant minmaxing at the expense of *all else*. You don’t need max DPS, most bosses, even those with enrages, are plenty forgiving DPS-wise. What’s more important on some fights is not DPS, but avoiding overburdening the healer. Players who are wearing gear that makes them squishy (*cough* leather fury with death wish popped) and get hit by mechanics are very taxing on healers.
---
As far as I can tell, the reason people play ret is pretty much RP, yeah. Not everyone sees wow as just a number interaction spreadsheet. Some people have their minds stimulated by class fantasy and their imagination of what their fights actually involve. Some people love ret, and I understand that. It’s basically a Jedi / Arthas / Uther amalgam. 2h weapons and magic is a cool combo, which is why blizzard made it OP as fuck for several expansions after Vanilla. It’s also worth noting that virtually every paladin levels in ret, so it’s TOTALLY understandable from a psychology point of view that they’d want to stick with what they know and are comfortable with.
---
It’s not stubbornness. You’re assuming too much malice and cynicism on the part of other players.
---
Because they don't play, they 2shot people with 5 healers behind for months, raising the honor everyone need to rank up.
---
Thank you.  
---
Of couse I can and I´am already doing so. There are quite more information in the raw data.  
---
1v1
---
relax kid
---
More than that, will of the forsaken is such powerful against démo that if you want to roll one, and that you don’t have any preference in the faction, you’ll choose horde
---
Or....you know people who just want to have fun with the game and go what ever spec they want. 
---
I have a life, I can't just ditch that for wow. I have zero plans or ambitions to raid. So I'm going tank pally for the fun of it. Although I'll probably heal in bg's.
---
You're trying to turn this around to make it sound like there is less PvP in the old map (which forced the players into constant PvP) and more PvP in the PvM zergfest that replaced it... Yes I played old AV, it was a grind and a half and people would often leave and be replaced, your point? You were at least fighting other players, not racing them or constantly getting into fights with your allies over whether or not your going to waste time and turtle. And it is a waste of time when there's a faster option, either constantly get "race matches" done in 20-30 minutes or turtle and risk it going for 2-4 hours, eventually ending in a loss anyways... Occasionally you could turtle and turn a loss into a win, but the basic rule is, if they're beating you in the race, they'll beat you in PvP too.
---
Other than wanting to get in and out of the AV rep grind as fast as possible I can't see much if any reason to prefer 1.12 AV. You've done the race once, you've done it a million times, the fun of PvP is that each match is different. Personally, I much prefer PvP to raiding and AV was always my favorite battleground so I just want it to be as good as possible.
---
because the sentiment was based in fact. ret is a bad spec. 
---
Horde has will of the forsaken racials. Alliance warlocks are at a disadvantage.
---
As a good dueler I fucking hated having to do BGs so Arenas were a godsend. 
---
ask the reddit mods, dont take my word for it.
---
Now, THIS is Epic!
---
Trolls being vastly underrepresented is quite funny. I love trolls and troll players normally seem the nicest/most chill 
---
Doesn't bother me im rolling Troll warrior! 
---
Do you have to do engineering in PvP to compete against others who do have it? 
---
Most humans are between mid 5 ft and early 6 ft. Elves fit more into that then the literal dwarf dwarves.
---
I plan on tanking 5/10 mans and raiding as a dps for 20/40 mans. Fewer tanks by ratio are needed for larger raids.
---
True, that is probably also a very big factor. Although, from a min-maxing standpoint (especially in PvP), Orc should dominate then because their racials are superior.
---
haven’t played since 06 eh
---
Or the people who don't realize racials give very little implications on progress. Yes an Orc/Human warrior will do more dps, but the fact that people are aware and have pre raid BIS lists means progression of the early raids will be trivialized as it is, an extra few percent dps of performance from the raid due to optimal racials isn't going to be the difference between getting a kill or not. Coupled with the fact that you can't (I hope) recustomize your character, I don't think people understand what they're committing to, and what they're really getting out of it. 
---
Realistically, 20 hours to 20 was the average for the non optimized run character... so 14 hours is pretty fast compared to the general population.
---
Also +weaponability for ranged weapons isn't nearly as strong as +weaponskill for melee weapons!
---
Because one steamy night they?
---
People want to play classic to, gasp, have fun. There are going to be far more people not following the meta and just playing a class/spec they find interesting.
---
yikes. work on your reading comprehension before posting. 
---
I am gonna roll a Troll Warrior as well.
---
I even think they are superior to Orcs lategame from a minmaxing perspective.
---
i still have all my physicla copies, to this day i buy my wow as physical copies i actually have the two different classic boxes
---
Wow has free weekends where its 100% free to play now. I think they are trying to get people to come back.
---
True! The lore point is maybe, as you mentioned a huge factor too
---
Not everyone wants to raid. That is what made vanilla great, there were other forms of meaningful progression outside of raiding. 
---
Warrior was the most played class on Nostalrius at least if I remember correctly.
---
if you ambush someone as a hunter in world PVP , you would have to be very creative to lose that fight
---
Yeah, Warrior was definitely the most played class on Nost.
---
Lets look at a real life analogue:
---
Remember when you were a kid, and you and your friends would walk or ride bikes everywhere because none of you had a license. You'd run into other people, stop and say hi, have weird/fun interactions on the journey because you were travelling slowly enough to actually be a part of the area you are in.
---
Remember when you got your license and a car? Now most of the time you travel alone, even if you see someone you know while driving at most you give a passing beep or wave. Sure sometimes something funny happens on the road, but its mostly just about the destination. You're going too fast to really interact with anywhere you're travelling through.
---
Thankyouthankyouthankyou
---
[Jimmy]: Fools...
---
lol what? 
---
I can smell the Ankh
---
Hunter’s pet dps is lol
---
Druids actually are the least picked class according to this data. Paladin is the second most picked class on alliance though, which I do not find too surprising.
---
Also A LOT of classic players have a weird obsession with SOMEHOW making ret pally work. But it never does.
---
I remember Bloodvine garb being worth good money. Would be worth it probably. You'd need herbalism to get the mats or buy them off the AH.
---
Have you seen the ears, eyebrows, skin color, and hair color of elves? 
---
Honestly I think it's more about people being into sexy alien-looking humanoids. Not that they look more like humans. 
---
WOTF, if you're going to play a class that's somewhat countered by a racial, why not play on the side with that racial, effectively eliminating it from things you have to deal with. 
---
Bow spec isn't that good for ranged as it is for melee. Hunters easily hit cap and don't have glancing blows. Orc racial of pet damage and stun resist in pvp is quite good. 
---
The other two races are alliance and also have their pvp racial advantages.
---
Absolutely. Mooncloth is an extremely sought after item that sells for roughly 100g a piece. You can make one every third day (I think). 10 Felcloth = 1 Mooncloth. It won't be super lucrative in the beginning, but once ZG arrives, people are buying every Mooncloth off of the auction house
---
It's bis if the 's' stands for style 😎
---
The clicker is strong in this one. 
---
Duels? Demonology Warlock
---
BG’s? Arms Warrior
---
World PvP? Subtlety Rogue
---
What about not consuming during BGs but do consume in world pvp, pve, and leveling?
---
eVeRyOnE WhO MiNmAxEs iS StUpId
---
Lol I think it's kinda funny this post is sitting at 0 vote-wise despite sparking a conversation about an issue lots of people have opinions on 
---
I guess being force fed healthy shit at a young age paid off. It led to me getting my degree in kinesiology and being pretty conscious about what I put in my body... now don’t get me wrong. Me and my buds have had many of those late night whataburger feasts after raids, but more than a couple days of that I’d need a break
---
Paladins and shamans both bring incredible heals and utility to raids so they are widely sought after.
---
What is your question? Just level with combat, and pay 1g to switch to hemo once you're 60?
---
Shadowcraft is nice looking. Better than those stupid T1 shoulders.
---
PS, soneform pvp trinkets blind because it's a poison.
---
This is actually kind of genius. With how locked down the internet is in China, you can be sure the government has the ability to monitor in-game messaging systems.
---
It's actually 61% Alliance and 39% Horde for PvE servers in this data.
---
On PvP Horde is slightly dominant with 52%
---
My man. Also yeah they are for tanking I think due to berserking, either way I'm rolling it for uniqueness and style 
---
Lore-wise Orc locks beat Undead locks handily... Forsaken didn't even exist yet when the first Orc locks were busy destroying their race
---
It's the sixth question down in the survey, "What class will your character be?".
---
some reasons https://imgur.com/a/QAxwYJS
---
Bow skill is a much, much smaller deal than melee weapon skill (only +hit benefits, as opposed to hit/dodge/parry/glance for melee)
---
Yeah, style is also the most important criteria for me, but I would never admit that ;)
---
RP-PvP or bust. I will genuinely genuinely be sad if they don't include it. 
---
If you are a warrior and you cant atleast tank 5mans you are useless and you should uninstall
---
Why? It's paladin's best role, and both ret and prot are always under fire for being unviable. Good luck getting into Pugs without a stellar reputation on those specs. Holy is the way to go for most players, and I'm honestly surprised it only has 66% of the Paladin population. I would expect 80% personally. Prot has no place in the progression PvE endgame, I'm genuinely surprised 1/10 paladins want to play prot, seeing as it's one of the most dead end specs in the game. 
---
Hello fellow Utahn. 😉
---
Warlock mage and rogue are your top contenders all have a high skill cap. Spriest is very easy to play in classic and are solid 1v1 with the blue PvP gear and anathema. 
---
Ever had a boss survive with sub 1k hp? I did, multiple times. Sometimes that 1% will matter. 
---
cuz troll hunter is a meme
---
I'm really surprised that Troll, dwarf, and gnome rogue are as low as they are. Troll is outright meta, and Dwarf and Gnome are superior PvP choices to Human. 
---
There's not a lot of meta compliance across the board. I see a lot of meta options at the bottom and a lot of suboptimal choices towards the upper middle. Alliance top 5 looks right, but then you immediately follow it up with a disproportionate number of NE hunters, human rogues, human mages, and human warlocks. I guess players care a lot more about aesthetics than they do throughput and utility. 
---
UD rogue, Human rogue, Human mage, Human warlock, Undead warlock, and Night Elf hunter are criminally over-represented. It's all Human, Undead, and Night Elf, so I know for a fact it's the aesthetic that these players are caring about, it's just odd to see it laid out with stats. UD rogue specifically is just not great at DPS compared to Orc or Troll. 
---
I agree but it's gross overkill. I won't get someone in trouble with goverment because he whispers me gold selling site link.
---
Surprised to see druid hunter rogue warlock numbers so similar on alliance
---
Definitely a factor, but OP stated that 66% of paladin respondents were planning to go healer and the rest were a closer split between dps and tank. Also I've seen some pretty convincing footage of Ret pallies in AQ gear doing better than hunters in Nax. Mind you this was straight out of 2006 before WoW had been whittled down to "warrior/rogue are the only melee dps worth taking".
---
What I meant was caring enough to not let someone play the race they wany.
---
Ywah but have you seen their bow shoot animation? Thats why noone is troll hunter.
---
You're getting in your own head if you honestly think players in game are going to be harassing you for your race. No one cares at all outside of a 1%er pserver guild... 
---
Imagine playing a fantasy game, where you could be anything else but the boring human that you are in real life and you still choose to play as one. OMEGALUL
---
hey! I've been lurking in the sub for some times and I often see people mentioning "meme specs" like ele sham or ret pal.
---
How many more meme specs should I be aware of? I wouldn't want to accidentally main one 
---
the people on this forum that gave that data prolly know what will happen
---
Well, that would be forced wpvp. I dont think people would feel very driven to wpvp if it was forced upon them, especially since plenty love bgs and there is something special about them.
---
I agree, it would be awesome to see more wpvp, but i dont see other way of boosting it while minimalising #changes besides adding queue button.
---
(Lets be realistic, lfg ruins vanilla communication and it will be gone for good reason, but lack of bg queue option just makes people who want to pvp stuck at bg NPC, unable to quest or farm while at it, if anything it REMOVES players from open world)
---
You do know this is fake? It doesn't work like that. If that were to be true, the Chinese government had to have direct access to Blizzard's servers - which they most likely don't. You're connection to Blizzard, e.g the game packets being sent are encrypted. Also, the packets sent and the information with it are completely different than packets sent by a different game, e.g Call of Duty.
---
But yeah, not impossible on smaller, less secured games.
---
Will do. Thanks again for the heads up.
---
immune is poor wording on his part. More that it negates the effectiveness so much so, that to a rogue it becomes not worth it to even risk trying to stun an orc warrior. 
---
If there's one thing I'm not gonna miss about WoW Classic, it's the dumbass talent design of Paladins. Especially when the developers seem to be unwilling to make any kind of balance changes to the classic game.
---
Pallies in Vanilla had some of the worst talents that I've ever seen and there are two particular talents that illustrate this well.
---
Redoubt and Reckoning grant the Paladin an additional 30% chance to block and an additional attack if they ever take a critical strike. If anybody here has done even five minutes of research into tank itemization, they will know why talents designed to only trigger on being the victim of a critical strike are a dipshit idea.
---
Back in Vanilla, tanks had to increase their Defense by 140 points in order to become uncrittable, which is mandatory because taking a crit from a raid boss would kill you and wipe the raid. Hence by becoming uncrittable, the 10 points you put into these resspective talents become worthless.
---
For Paladins this was particularly bad, since you need 102.4% combined chance to block, dodge &amp; parry to become uncrushable, and the 30% increased block chance you got from Redoubt was suddenly invalidated by becoming uncrittable.
---
Here is what you are asking for based on that huge survey. 
---
[Overall Class Distribution.](https://i.imgur.com/vQWvbur.jpg)
---
[Breakdown by realm type \(PvE/PvP\).](https://i.imgur.com/xi6tmKo.jpg)
---
So many sad druids at 60 ;_;
---
Tauren Warriors aren't even that good. Orc and Troll both have higher TPS and Undead has a better racial for PvE because of horde's lack of fear ward. 5% HP and a stun aren't as relevant as you might think, they matter, but not as much as weapon skill, a speed boost, or a CC break. 
---
66% holy sounds absolutely correct, and it might not be rated high enough, because neither of the two other specs are very good. I seriously doubt we will see high representation from memespecs. I'll play one, but I'm a tryhard asshole who likes piling on disadvantages I can overcome. The average player probably cant handle the level of adversity playing a memespec brings at endgame. The numbers of hybrid dps are probably overinflated and we might see 10-20% representation from memespecs out of their class. The gap between a meta spec and off meta spec in terms of impact is so huge I think a lot of paladins will end up Holy, even if they want to play Ret. Same goes for Enh and Resto, boomkin or kitty and resto, etc. 
---
maybe if I make it dwarf they will inv me
---
for the exotic effect I bring
---
To be clear, i dont let it phase me. It's just odd that its a thing. I doubt I'll see a word of it in game, but these prelaunch forums are rife with idiots on both ends.
---
I think he means flavor, as that was my reasoning at first. Lore wise you are absolutely correct that Orc should absolutely dominate any other race as a pick for Warlocks. But Orc is the least picked race for warlocks
---
Do you even LOTR bro
---
Bad bot
---
also stealth shenanigans with shadowmeld and cats
---
Shit tons of players roll warrior, and even though many drop the class before it hits powerspikes, many will see it through to 35, get their solid spells, and carry it out to cap. It's the most populated class on most private servers, beating the runner up by a solid 8%. That's a huge number of warriors. It doesn't matter if a huge number of them quit during leveling, because those players make up the 8% population advantage warriors have. 
---
Paladin + Warrior
---
There are no class alone that are overpowered. Some are super good at fighting others in a 1v1 situation, others might handle 1v2 with good gear and experience. But no class are overpowered
---
Wasn't it confirmed a couple of months back or so that BFA had less than 1M? Vaguely remember Asmond reacting to something about it. 
---
If you don't manage to get Ashjre'thul before AQ40, [Larvae of the Great Worm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23557) is an upgrade over Rhok'delar. However, since there are no ranged glancing blows, ranged weapon skill is not nearly as good as melee weapon skill anyway.
---
I'm happy with 1.12 AV
---
I don't see the toxic idiots you're seeing. I see forum discussion, bored people theory crafting, I don't see anyone disparaging someone for choosing suboptimal specs or wanting to play casually. You might read "if you want to play ret, look for a casual guild" and that isn't toxic at all, it's just the way the game works. 
---
Nice TY. Love these graphes.
---
Dwarf Rogue is really good, and much better for PvP than human is, you're not making a mistake. Human Rogue looks really over-represented. The weapon skill is nice, but Stoneform is one of the best racials in the game. 
---
Rogues, Shadowpriest, Warlocks and Mages.
---
&gt;If that were to be true, the Chinese government had to have direct access to Blizzard's servers
---
I wouldn't put it past them to be honest. China might be the most advanced surveillance state.
---
Why so many warriors ?
---
Nice. Very Interesting stuff.
---
So you’re planning to skip Deadmines?
---
I've always liked the idea of turning BG's into real world events. They were actual places on the map that you could enter and end up joining the battle. Be it WSG, Arathi, or Alterac, those could be hotly contested beacons of world-pvp. Maybe you need to go to a specific gate and still talk with whatever "battle master" but they would be ingrained into the real world
---
People wanted flying mounts so much they would have rioted if they didn’t get them.
---
Back when I played, it was filled with hunters and rogues. Lol is it different now?
---
I don't look down on someone because he chooses to play a gnome or dwarf rogue. That's their decision and everbody wants something else out of this game and not everybody even cares about raiding.
---
I still wouldn't want to raid with a dwarf/gnome rogue, because going for server-fastest kills etc. is what makes Wow fun for me.
---
Okay. A raid is 40 people. 2-3 are tanks. You need 8-11 healers (gear depending), the rest are DPS. If you want to go into MC with 24 healers, have fun. 
---
It's even more surprising because Trolls are the optimal choice for most classes from a min-max standpoint as well
---
Most of the most aesthetic combos are highly overrated. Half of warlocks and 40% of mages chose to ignore a 5% int bonus, for example. That can mean losing out on a decent chunk of spell crit and mana at cap. 
---
He wants to pvp while leveling, which combat swords is wildly "meh" for.
---
Oh yeah, I didn't pick up on that. Hemo it is I guess
---
This guy RPs.
---
The comment I originally replied to was about 66% of players choosing healing classes. I said that’s ridiculous. It is. 
---
#NoChanges
---
Are you doing any frontstabbing though?
---
Exactly. It's an MMO. It rewards players who work together. If you don't like getting shit on by pre-mades maybe try joining a premade
---
everyone seems to want to play there favorite streamers class lol get ready to have 30 druid trying to get in your raid group 
---
I never could get that 45 min strat run done. It still haunts me. 
---
but what if flying was the same speed as walking, or like 10/20% speed
---
Seeing how Prot Paladin works on private servers, it'll probably work in Classic aswell.
---
Not saying it WILL work, but probably will. If the values on private servers are off 1%, then it won't be a problem. If you want a raid spot, then you need to work hard.
---
You only want to run dungeons? Add me so we can strat and scholo farm for days, thanks. &lt;3
---
Logging on today was eerie.  Hadn’t touched my characters since the day I quit in early 2010.  So many little things came back, how I had setup my bags, random gear, things I would horde in my bank.  Not gonna lie was pretty emotional.
---
I'm going to get my mom and step dad to come yell at each other in the room behind me. Oh boy, the memories!
---
It was 66% of paladins going heal spec, not all players.
---
I'm not going to complain about strategic play and party makeup. But I will complain about queue dodging. That's where the abuse is. Ideally premades should fight premades most of the time.
---
Get level 60 first, get good gear first, show them that you are capable, and you should be fine. There are multiple tanks in each guild. You just gotta work for it.
---
On the bright side, if you were to reach 60 late, get gear late, you could always just start your own guild. Tanks are usually sought after
---
Warrior pop is high, but a very small portion want to tank. Your odds of tanking are high, especially if you want to. I'm not a tank, but I feel like MT/OTs put in more time than the average raider.
---
Well if a player actively goes online and reads about the game that player is atleast probably more hardcore than the average user. 
---
Haha, being force fed healthy stuff my entire childhood is actually the reason why I was so off the rails right at 18.  I was never allowed to have fast food or pizza and my parents were always cooking quote "health food".  It was so sick of it by the time I turned 18 that its what lead to me eating nothing but pizza and burgers for a half decade :P
---
Hi, /u/Aprai7
---
TBC players were retarded. Ret was viable and you probably wanted one in your raid. The huge raid wide buffs they provided made up for the slightly sub par dps compared to warriors. The TBC trees and spells fixed every problem ret had in classic. 3.0 ret was fucking broken because blizz listened to a community that didn't know a viable class when they saw one.
---
Ret is fine if you put in work and can show you put in work. I think most guilds would be stupid to turn down a player that shows up on time and farms their consumes for every raid, regardless of the class. Bad ret players are going to reroll or go holy, sure, they will do less damage than tanks. 
---
&gt; Also, I’m not sure but can’t you trade your blues in the “will not be traded” window and get them des? I have a doubt. 
---
nope
---
Yeah, it is kinda weird because they are among the best DPS in PvE as well. Maybe it's because most people who choose to play rogue do want to do more worldPvP and thus go to PvP servers. Just a guess though.
---
And thanks, I did it very quickly (because I did the analysis for myself anyways). PowerPoint graphs would have been nicer to look at, though.
---
Horde Warlock is better in PvP than Alliance Warlock due to Will of the Forsaken. Ironically, Alliance warlock is better in PvE by miles due to Gnome's 5% int and Paladin's Sanctuary. 
---
I would like to sign the petition but I realize I have no idea what a Role Playing server is, from the beginning I've only ever played on a PVP server. 
---
So, what happens on an RP server that is different from a PVP or PVE server?
---
shadowcraft is phenomenal for rogue pvp though, the 35 energy set bonus is too good.
---
People that watch world of roguecraft, and decide to play a rogue, are going to have a very bad time. Warlock/Spriest just get better and better with the new phases/content due to gear. They scale insanely well, BWL+.
---
Don’t worry most won’t make it past stockades. Warriors will get angry from slow and grueling leveling, paladins disheartened from auto attacking. I think on the Nost post mortem, it said ~20% of warriors make it to 60, not including the level 1 bank alts. 
---
Yeah, that's going to be hard convincing a group to give up caster loot for the healer, even if your intentions were to go DPS later on.
---
Get friends, have them help you
---
Yeah, I have two jobs so my "end game" is farming t.5 for fun. I will put together a BiS holy set as I go, in case I do pug a raid or something. But for the most part, it's just dungeons and pvp for me. 
---
And yeah, you want to farm strat and scholo? I'm down. Just need the game to launch first.....lol
---
Don't forget that the bosses summoned for the quests also drop some really nice items. So even if the T0,5 set is god awful for some classes (warlock) there are quite a few items you can get from these bosses. 
---
It’s best race for pvp if I’m not mistaken
---
Makes me wonder if he's that rouge that almost got 1 shot by the explosions
---
Yeah but how many of those human warriors are getting past stockades
---
Dumb raids or serious guilds? If you want a viable, but suboptimal spec then go to a casual guild. No one owes you a raid spot.
---
Make sure to pick the angry grandma face. People need to learn how to respect the elderly!
---
I'm not here for Nostalgia. I've been playing on private servers for well over 6 years (though I am still super bad with the game). The game, the leveling, the PvP, everything is more fun and relaxing. Heck, even dungeons I've done over a thousand times are still fun.
---
Are you illiterate?
---
I would assume that there are less hardcore players going into Classic than there are on private servers. To play on a private server, you need to break WoW ToS, download a bootleg client, fuck with its files, make an account on a sketchy site, and then you can play on a potentially buggy server that doesn't have the logevity retail has. For fans that aren't diehard hardcore, I dont think private servers are worthwhile. 
---
There's a higher concentration of informed and skilled players on private servers, and I doubt we will see that same enphasis on metagaming in retail Classic. 
---
I also found it really odd how overrepresented Human, Night Elf, and Undead are. Troll Rogue being the least played makes damn near 0 sense, seeing as it's a meta race for the class.
---
It wasn't players online, it was popularity of WoW as a search term I believe.
---
Alot of "meme" specs while not always optimal are perfectly fine for leveling and tanking on the way to 60. They really start to fall apart during raids but some guilds may take a token one or two but I wouldn't hold my breath on it. Play how you want to 60 and I'd you decide to get hardcore about PVP or PVE then research the appropriate optimal specs. 
---
also, most warriors will end up collecting tank pieces as duplicates drop and we progress toward phase 6 where you will need 8 tanks for the 4 horsemen in Naxx
---
Not as underrated as Troll Rogue, it's meta for PvE dps.
---
Looks. There is no other justification. 
---
I feel the same way. Worst part, I actually don't know why farming and grinding does not feel like a chore in vanilla, but does in other expansions, especially where there are multiple daily quests you have to complete. What's the difference?
---
Wouldn’t we all 😂
---
I reckon they could just follow the original patch timeline - releasing everything approximately the same as however many days it was released into Vanilla.
---
trail to freewind post.. any idea why it even exist?
---
Stoneskin is less niche than 1% dodge and a bad stealth. Dwarf is solidly better in every element of the game. NE is fine, it can clear naxx, but there are situations where a Dwarf Hunter is dramatically better than NE. SF is one of the strongest racials in classic. 
---
Cloth users wear Ironweave until R8. Warlocks and Mages wear R10 or T2 in PvP until R13.
---
Priests wear R10 until R13. That goes for both healer and Shadow.  
---
The only Priest PvE gear that's really suited for PvP is T2.5. Anathema/Benediction get an obligatory mention since if I don't mention it, someone else will.  
---
By the time T2.5 comes out you'll have had more than enough time to reach either R10 or R13 already. If you stopped at rank 10, T2.5 is a small upgrade, and a fairly big downgrade from R13.
---
Druid gearing is different. Their niche is flag running so they're often the focus of attention in PvP meaning they want as much stam as possible. In the beginning they just max out on stam/int since that's the easiest way to ensure that you live through anything. Once you progress through PvE you start to squeeze in some bonus healing wherever it's not detrimental to your survivability. The biggest PvE upgrades for PvP are weapons, jewellery, capes and trinkets.  
---
Healing and stamina are your primary stats followed by int.
---
Druids ideally push all the way to R13 for the full set bonus. As I explained earlier, but it bears repeating, R13 is how Druids are able to get the movement speed set bonus while wearing rocket boots which is especially important for flag running but otherwise useful in PvP.  
---
If you harbor hopes and desires of playing Feral PvP the R10 is very decent for that. T2.5 is not really better than R10 for Druids regardless of spec.  
---
R13 is the definite BiS for resto flag runner and feral. I don't know what Balance Druids are supposed to wear because I've never seen one graduate from farming dungeons.
---
Warriors are the 2nd most played class on that one private server we arent allowed to name (at level 60)
---
[https://imgur.com/wjjwmw7](https://imgur.com/wjjwmw7)
---
Why does it matter though? Nothing being released is cutting edge, it's not like we're going to have people min maxing 2 weeks into the game at 60 somehow clearing through AQ. Content will come out when it's ready, and given how accessible knowledge towards min maxing is through other means now, when that content comes out a 1% wipe will more often than not mean player error opposed to lack of gear / optimization. Yeah nitpicking may give you some breathing room, but this surge in popularity of things like dwarf priests is hilarious. And there's multiple implications you could argue puts certain races /class combos ahead in certain environments. Tauren increased aoe radius, troll increased threat gen, orc axe skill (useless for slam swords). Personally I used to care about min maxing when I raided 35+ hours a week, but in most cases each race has their own niche and I'd rather enjoy looking at the character I'm stuck with than idealizing which niche I fit into.

Thanks guys this really helped alot im alot less stressed about it really do love this community &lt;3

A CONDUIT OF NATURE
---
weaponskill only impacts chance to graze, and ranged attacks cant graze. Troll bow racial doesnt matter, dwarf gun racial doesn't matter. 
---
Not to forget the original cinematic. That decided some of the most classic combos - Dwarf Hunter, Night Elf Druid, Orc Warrior, Human Mage and of course Undead Warlocks.
---
To add to this... When you join a guild before 60, start expressing interest in tanking ***immediately.***  Tank all the instances you can. Not only are you gaining experience, but you are showing your guild-mates that you are capable and responsible. Then, when the guild is ready to start raiding, guess who's on the top of the list?
---
*Of course, if you join a guild at 60, then follow the advice above.... :)*
---
When there are dailies, it's literally a daily chore to complete.  It's the game telling you *"hey bro, do this thing and get your reward."*  Without dailies, farming things to sell on the AH is a choice that **you** make.  It's emergent gameplay at it's finest.
---
Also, when questing you always have some sort of goal in mind.  When farming, you can truly just [chill the hell out and enjoy it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/auc551/does_anyone_else_just_love_farming_as_much_as_i_do/)
---
It's changing either way.
---
The current content release plan is already not how it was in vanilla.
---
We should aim at how it makes most sense/will play the most vanilla-like over 1:1 implementation in such cases.
---
Speaking as a warrior main, hunters should definitely not be allowed to roll on 2handers as long as a warrior, paladin or shaman needs it. They're nothing but stat sticks for them, they should be second in line. Just like it is with ranged weapons for warriors. I'm of the opinion warriors shouldn't roll against a hunter for a ranged weapon, so it would be nice if the hunters would reciprocate and pass on 2handers someone else actually needs.
---
Someone who really uses the weapon &gt; someone who wants it as a stat stick. And don't start with "but hunters can weave in raptor strikes, so a teeny, tiny percentage of their attacks directly profits from the weapon". That's bullshit and in no way supercedes or even equals out to the warriors need.
---
Warriors are the only class that have 2 highly viable (as in needing multiple per raid) roles and they're good at 60 pvp, so they're always overrepresented.
---
I must have missed the part of the poll that was about spec. 
---
Personally, because it was my first character and I want to recreate it. If it wasn't for that reason I'd probably pick a dwarf nowadays. 
---
do u have much time or not
---
It’s a really famous video called World of Roguecraft, he basically tries proving that rogues can be skill-based instead of faceroll in PvP by killing marshals, etc in pvp with just a dagger and trinkets 
---
I have tons of time
---
This comment made me giggle.  Protection paladins were flat shunned except for extreme outliers, and Ret paladins were commonly referred to as Retnoobs, Retnubs, or Retrilols.  Paladin healing was a blast; simplified healing options in comparison to a priest, high forgiveness for aggo pulling due to high armor from plate, wipe recovery, pally buffs, and a horsecock stuffed full of OHSHIT options.  
---
Dont make me bring up PvP Shockadins that could diarrhea your hitpoints with a Consecrate, SoR Judge, Holy Shock, Hammer of Justice, and a /dance
---
People talking about race a lot, really thought we were past this in 2019
---
A rogues nightmare
---
I imagine that even if it works, the person on the other end is just as likely to be a bot as a real person. 
---
I just remember there being a youtube video one of the wow youtubers made about it last year but I cant seem to remember who made it 
---
I have alot of free time
---
I hope he gets his mini child size beaststalker mantle
---
Dude, great explanation. Spot on me feelings. I also enjoyed the post you linked about loving farming, because I really feel the same way.
---
Also one thing I thought why dailies feel like a chore, but grinding does not, is that daily quests are trying to get you online every single day or you're missing out. But farming could be done in your own tempo, heck, you could even skip several days and not really 'miss out' in that sense.
---
Hunter is one of the worst classes, if not the worst class, at endgame. It's a tier 3 dps. It doesn't scale at all, and it's output is the same as Shadow, ret, and enh after you include raid DPS from support abilities. The ideal way to use a hunter in a 40m is having one damn good one in your raid, and only for Nightfall and utility, like pulling and tranq shot. There's no reason to bring more than one. 
---
I'm honestly surprised that the hybrids have more stigma than hunters do at this point. 
---
bow chica wowow
---
Dunno, I don't really see a big correlation between the trailer combinations and the data. But this analysis would take more time because I'd have to factor in how much the races themselves are picked.
---
Yeah, I keep forgetting about that. I've played on many private servers, and I just want to hit level 60 personally as fast as possible. But I should stop saying it out loud, because I want others to enjoy their time leveling, since it's such a great experience.
---
One of my favorite memories was when a Troll Mage ran around all of Hillsbrad handing out hoods for free. Everyone had one.

---
The problem is that the way they're doing it now is a massive buff to melee early game. Most of the marquee melee items from 1.10 were stat changes (Savage Glad bp, Brigham Girdle, Bloodmail Boots) where as the caster items of equal power from 1.10 were new additions, since the early game had poor caster itemization. The net effect of the current plan is that melee will be way overpowered relative to casters thanks to effectively getting their 1.10 itemization early.
---
Someone please photoshop this.
---
Classic will not start at patch 1.12.1 it will be based on 1.12.1 and will be progressive.
---
Everything had a place with different styles. I think what ended it for me was losing the original talent tree.
---
I. Was. Pissed.
---
They just made it so boring and dumbed down for casuals(jeeze I can't believe I said that unironically).
---
Clearly the reason to play a druid is to healbot rogues while capping AV towers behind enemy lines
---
The issue with AV is throughout Vanilla since AV's inception features were constantly being removed, such as nerfing the amount of guards, and their Hp/Dmg.
---
As this was happening and players became smarter about the fastest way to win, AV's went from massive day long Mosh Pit Frag Arenas to "Run past the enemy and don't do any actual PvP"
---
while it still is possible to force an all out brawl lasting hours, you don't get much or any rewards due to all the Rep/Bonus honor came from doing objectives, killing NPC captains and winning.  Since many players are there just for the rep rewards or bonus honor to rank up with, combined with the harsh honor diminishing returns from killing the same few dozen players over and over -- the best rewards came from not actually PvP'ing at all.
---
This doesn't sit well with many players, myself including and the removal of features to help force players to actually fight each other is what removed the charm and fun of playing AV.  Its more fun to be killing players non-stop in a mosh pit for hours on end (even if there is little to no rewards for doing so) than it is to do a PvE race when one side has a major advantage in that race.
---
Fortunately, I myself do not need any actual AV rep rewards for my Ele Shaman, so I will be one of the few "assholes" actually defending and getting as many kills as possible rather than doing the PvE base race which I find absolutely dreadful and unenjoyable.
---
I remember when WoW had over 7,000,000 players.
---
Sorry, I'm removing your post because we have tons of polls like this, and your poll is missing a class anyway. Please see the other comment with a link to data from a 10,000+ player survey.
---
This made me slightly rethink being an Alli lock...
---
Respectfully, couldn’t  disagree more with BGs ruining world pvp. That was simply not the case on my server. I did the rank grind and I did tons of world pvp and helped protect guild mates while I was waiting for BGs to pop, which could take hours for me since I had to queue every match. 
---
Also, the snowball effect was very real on my server. Since there were no cross-server BGs the community was super tight knit. People would whisper players they knew were pvping to help out if players were roaming and ganking on either side, which could create some great world pvp battles. Also, some guilds had mandatory raids on capital cities on my server. Sylvanna’s was a favored target. This will be the type of stuff I prioritize when I hit 60 and get some decent gear tbh. 
---
I would guestimate that 90% of people who talk about LFG are referring to the dungeon finder (akin to LFR).  not the Looking For More group listing section of retail.  They're talking about auto-queueing, teleporting to the dungeon, never saying anything, getting a 15% bonus to damage, healing and health, then getting a reward at the end. and never seeing those people again.
---
while I like the looking for more system and I think that is what wow needs in the end instead of spamming trade / general chat .  It's cross realm on live so you will still never see those people again and 20% of that is advertisements for selling M15+ and mythic raiding runs for gold.  But since this thread is about a "what could they have done instead", I think this would have been the better solution. 
---
I use the "group job board" type analogy though because it could be like the hero call to arms board where you can go to a capital city (or most if not all inns), list your group, then go about your day and people have to go there if you don't want to allow for random group forming in the middle of nowhere -- like the current implementation of the LFM system.
---
If we take a closer look at the numbers in the poll, with some extremely basic arithmetic we can determine that 523 respondents chose paladins. If we look at the numbers above that OP himself provided (in the context of paladin spec choice breakdown), adding them together reaches exactly 523. 
---
So yeah, you probably missed something but thats okay.
---
This is good one, finally. Now It shows how popular shamans and paladins actually are in their own factions.
---
Haha, I was wondering how many people would pick that up. This was taken when I was filming my PvP video looking for big crits so I had been keeping my AV wolf at my side to ensure I got the bonus dmg from Furious Howl.
---
They are mostly PvE players who don't mind RP'ing as a Crusader, while actually being a Medic with armor.
---
Even then, PvP servers alliance still focus more on PvE and raid progression than being "hardcore" pvp'ers.
---
&gt; Country roooooooaaads Takeee meee hooooooooooooome
---
Based on what other people are saying, it seems they are around 1 million. My, how the mighty have fallen. It makes me wonder if they are truly making bad decisions or if the game has finally run its course.
---
i like how the objectively best warlock race is apparently the least popular
---
Or find a new DPS?   It's easier than finding heals most of the time.  That was the benefit of being a healer or a tank.
---
&gt; Whats surprising is the paladins and druids.
---
That's all the people who haven't ever played vanilla before.
---
Call it T2.5
---
But human rogues are better for PvE than gnome &amp; dwarves by a mile and Nelf hunters are also better for PvE than dwarves. I guess just more people care about PvE than PvP.
---
I started during the TBC prepatch so wouldn't consider myself a true vanilla player, also I was 8 years old. Will be playing tons, I do enjoy retail also for what it is, but the RPG aspects of vanilla/TBC to a point were some of my fondest mechanics 
---
Yea, I'm def in the rush to 60 boat, same as you. I'll be duo leveling with a warrior bud most likely though. Trying to find most optimal spec; utilizing backstab/ambush (think frontstab build) or just going with combat swords.
---
A child army? Is this another catholic crusade?
---
Silly humans, you are a weird bunch
---
I only got to play vanilla for a few months before tBC came out. I got my druid up to level 45ish. And then saw the Belf pally mount and re-rolled. So I'm stoked to get another chance at classic. 
---
I've been checking reddit and YouTube daily for new stuff. I've watched every video and guide I can just to get a fix. I've even watched the long 2 or 3 part in depth shammy guide and have zero intention of playing one.
---
It's not useful/worth it precisely because it is (planned to be) released too late.
---
I kinda fit here -- started around November of 2006, so right towards the end of Vanilla's lifespan.  I didn't hit the level cap until after TBC had dropped though.
---
1) I have plenty of questing and class knowledge, due to playing for ~5 years and thoroughly researching things.  I played a Rogue most of that time but this time around am planning on rolling a Warrior with the intent of tanking.  As far as leveling and class mechanics go, I feel 100% up to speed... what will be new to me is all of the level 60 content I never got to experience -- LBRS/UBRS, Dire Maul, Scholo, Strat, and any of the raids I pug my way in to.  I can't wait!
---
2) Doesn't really apply, most of my time playing TBC - WotLK wasn't too horribly different from Vanilla.  That said, I never really got into PvP until capital cities had battlemasters, so finding the portals and the emergent world PvP that will occur is going to be new and fun.
---
3) No negatives from me, just pure excitement!
---
Since this was popular in another thread, I just put the three most requested analysis together in one picture, so everyone can easily see the data.
---
1. Yes
---
2 
---
3a: Negatives:
---
 * The levelling process in vanilla zones (not having enough quests)
---
 * Unbalanced classes
---
 * Boring spell rotations for PVE.
---
 * Bosses without fun mechanics
---
 * No BG and RDF queues.
---
3b: Positives
---
 * Class design is still better than BFA.
---
 * I'll actually be able to play a druid as a legitimate hybrid.
---
 * I'll get to play a more epic version of Alterac Valley
---
 * Classic may eventually progress to BC and Wrath, which are expansions I never got to play during.
---
This is the strongest argument I've seen in favour of a lock.
---
By all accounts, it's not massively difficult to get into MC raids, aka they're not super time consuming and the lock tier 1 does hit the right notes for PvP.
---
Thankfully they don’t fit well enough, he’s saved 
---
Thanks dude, appreciate it!
---
&gt; so I will be one of the few "assholes" actually defending and getting as many kills as possible rather than doing the PvE base race which I find absolutely dreadful and unenjoyable.
---
You and me both, my friend.  There are literally dozens of us!
---
&gt; diarrhea your hitpoints 
---
Jesus I don't know why this tickled my funny bone so hard, but I was laughing IRL for a solid 10 seconds before I could type
---
Hey! I played a Paladin throughout Vanilla and had a great time after finally leveling up.
---
There’s something to be said about being unkillable and the bane of your enemies. 
---
Also PvPing with DEoI + Full T2.5 wasn’t a bad time.
---
Balance druid, arcane mage, survival hunter probably
---
Gnome has not as good escape artist, but good for PvE +5% int.
---
Yeah, paladins are god tier and I can understand them being high, especially as healers.Druids, not so much.
---
While I also believe that to be the case, I do not know what this has to do with my statement. ^^
---
I'm surprised gnome warrior is so low. 
---
Talking about gear dependency in PvP, I recently found out that Warlock tier 1 is not very hard to obtain, as far as epics go. And it doubles up perfectly as PvP gear too.
---
What other classes fall in this category? Where easy to obtain tier gear is also great for PvP?
---
If you are good, knowledgable, reliable and willing to learn, ul get a spot 
---
Oh yes and willing to communicate via voice comms 
---
All these qualities are critical to tanking, if you miss any one of these ul not succeed 
---
That 1% isn’t forever, but the character is. Nobody ever got a boss to 1% and then never killed them. At worst you’re delaying the kill a week.
---
No
---
I'd you can't tell the difference between PvP and normal you haven't played on a PvP realm.
---
Probably less than 1 million but it's not more than that.
---
That Frys price tag. 
---
Yeah, no.
---
I tried a few RP servers before RP-PVP was a thing and nothing, absolutely nothing I saw on them ever matched the glorious RP fueld RP-PVP events, rivalries, and WPVP that I saw on Emerald Dream over the years.
---
Wouldn't trade it for the World (of Warcraft) and if there isn't an RP-PVP realm I might reconsider playing.  :P
---
I like this change because if I want to climb in pvp I want to play av but not the one that can take more then a day.
---
Almost everyone knows how to play av, and there is no way it will take more then a coupe of hours to finish. Remember this has been played before and people have learned new strategies and overall better game knowledge then they had in vanilla.
---
tfw you want to play human warrior but so does everyone else...
---
Isn’t the first helmet a lvl 24 tailoring piece?
---
This is the answer that OP is seeking. It was always a pain to lose mana due to a fury warrior’s execute.
---
Not sure if joking but that isn't TB, that's just some Tauren structures in Thousand Needles.
---
lmao I like how the warior enters the base and you can see he can tell something is fishy, he checks the room to the right, spins around and then is like "alright this seems safe" \*BOOM\*
---
  Whatever class you play I wouldn't tank only out of necessity though.  As long as one of your friends picks warrior you can always teach them what they need to know. You could play a druid so you can tank if needed. 
---
If you want to tank, you'll be able to tank. However, OTing is extremely time consuming, in a lot of ways moreso even than if you're the main tank.
---
Guilds live and die by their MT. You absolutely have to be there rain or shine, and your guild absolutely has to trust you to be there. You don't have to be the best player necessarily, but you have to be 100% reliable. From there, you'll get geared up, and you're the main tank until you quit.
---
If you're an offtank, gear isn't thrown your way, and it can be extremely competitive if you want to do the fun tasks like tanking the skull add or holding boss aggro. If you're not one of the top 2 or 3 offtanks, it can be tough to even get invited to raids or you'll end up as a DPS warrior to keep your spot.
---
Yeah that's not Thunder Bluff, Vanilla didn't have that big of a draw distance.
---
It's weird, like no one on horde likes pallies....
---
Human rogue is a lot better in PvE, I agree, but the result is pretty marginal compared to the stam and immunities Dwarf offers in PvP. If I even toyed with the idea of PvPing, I would play dwarf. 
---
Nelf hunters are marginally better at various breakpoints with a higher agi, but it depends on your gear. It's all breakpoint dependant. When Nelf has 1% crit more than dwarf, it really matters, but when they don't, the gap is straight up irelevant, and dwarf's extra health and immunities make them strictly better. The flat AP gained from agi that night elves get is about 1 dps. 
---
For both, if you are playing all sides of the game, Dwarf is better. Stoneform is one of the best defensive abilities in the game, and it's not assigned to a class. There's a solid argument for weapon skill with humans on rogue, but the PvE gain from weapon skill doesn't match the PvP gain from Dwarf. 
---
I would agree, most people aren't minmaxing for PvP. 
---
should come between BWL and AQ releases, post AQ they are somewhat, not entirely, trivial.
---
&gt;#[There are literally dozens of us!](There are literally dozens of us!)
---
thats a good info, i think you are right blizzlike respec is 1g. guess private server had it otherwise before, and now changed, didn't touch them since the announcement.
---
well then its 1g.
---
That keyboard turning tho lol
---
Henlo my name jeff, I'm actually mentally retarded. I require a special needs audio book version to digest the intricacies of a "blue post" - and just reading in general. Please assist me in this, mighty youtuber.
---
No, according to people testing on the Classic demo we won't be able to so I'm not using it now. Just hemo/sinister strike.
---
my friends wife may try bear tanking to level so she can play resto druid for raids. I just want to make sure the core 4/5 people I play with atleast one of us can tank and aside from her everyone else already has a plan to level as a dps or healer. 
---
Hunter and rogue also have excellent T1 sets that are great for PvP. 
---
&gt; I would guestimate that 90% of people who talk about LFG are referring to the dungeon finder (akin to LFR). not the Looking For More group listing section of retail. 
---
I know. It's just one of the things I really hate hearing classic fans talk about. Many times people haven't really played since like Cata or something, and just assume retail still works exactly the same way. In reality, while the automatic finder is still in game, it only works for lower level content that most people don't do more than a few times at max level. So it's more or less entirely irrelevant when talking about retail end game, where the group listing tool is what is actually used. It's like using BRD or ST as an example of all vanilla end game content. 
---
&gt;It's cross realm on live so you will still never see those people again
---
If you do medium-higher level m+ you still actually meet people again. I know my friends who does like +20 see people they know all the time in queues. But even on my own +15 or whatever I meet people I've played with before some times. 
---
Either way, I definitely don't like cross realm stuff, especially sharding. But I think if Blizzard just removed that one single thing it would almost instantly take BfA fairly close to vanilla community-wise. But it would also basically ruin the game for a sizeable portion of players (the solo/LFR crowd). 
---
Probably.  I don't remember for sure what I was wearing at the time.  They do look like the old.
---
You can't get to a 100engineering on lvl 1 so it's probably at least lvl 10+ or whatever is required to be able to learn the second tier of a profession.
---
I am personaly aiming to be a main tank i have the time and will to always be there 
---
&gt; As for frozen runes it should be doable but I think it will save you to the ID, and more people will know about it so it could sell for less than it used to. 
---
fine with me I prolly wont raid past ZG anyway lol
---
I'm rather surprised at how few dwarf rogues there are. The dwarf racial Stoneform macroed with Vanish is AMAZING. Basically a cheap Cloak of Shadows. 
---
Completely fine with 1.12 AV tbh
---
That's the whole point of this post... Put it somewhere else like zg so that people will care. Why even bother releasing content that is dead out of the gate? 
---
That's the point of this post, you seemed to have missed that. 
---
This awesome funny screenshot turned into a topic about que dodging and premades so fast! Do people just wait for any post vaguely pvp related and just immediately scream and QQ about stuff?
---
No, they should alter the game just to appease me!!! /s
---
male dwarf hunter &gt; male nelf hunter
---
male nelfs bow shoot animation is terrible, reminds me of a gangster shooting a pistol sideways with one hand. nelfs xbow animation is terrible aswell, the feet placement are weird as fuck. 
---
male dwarves shoot bows exactly how a human would, same with xbows.
---
They had a return free this weekend thing but I thought about it and I just couldnt think of anything geniuenly fun to do in the game anymore. Im incredibly excited about Classic but when I think about everything from leveling to how the classes feel to play in Retail I just cant get remotely excited about it. Everytime I've resubbed the past 3 years I've gotten so bored day 2 of my sub. I just dont care that much about cosmetics to stay interested. Also grinding Azerite sucked, like really bad.
---
Hey man, Shadow Priests are viable in PvE. Their debuff gives Warlocks 15% extra damage. Also regarding bad models and textures,  Blizzard could easily use the updated models instead of the old ones. But you know, the community probably wouldn't like it.
---
Also hoping for TBC expansion after vanilla. :)
---
Thanks for answering
---
Because old AV is one of the biggest things that people think when you talk about vanilla, having 1.12 AV is basically retail AV and it's not really what people think of when you talk about recreating vanilla.
---
No. Numbers were likely back up to 7 to 8 million during Legion, probably not lower than 4 or 5 million in BFA.
---
Nope, you have to last hit
---
Dude I'm in the same boat. I've played on private servers for 6 years, still looking at every god damn Youtube video there is about classic - because even though I have played it a lot, there's so much information one has to remember, and I'm so excited for its release.
---
That's true
---
Man my Ardent Custodian was all the rage in WSG 39 tho :P
---
Guns are not a good thing in PvP realms. Imagine playing in the open world. One of the key things in PvP is noticing and identifying that there's another player nearby before that other player notices that you are nearby. Can't tell you the number of times I've been traveling and heard gunfire, stopped, checked surroundings and thereby detected that opposite faction hunter before the hunter detected me. Make a kill or evade decision, then continue on. And given that the dwarf racial gives an advantage to guns, can see lots of dwarf hunters using guns over bows. May be slightly more effect while actually using the gun, but that detected first disadvantage is hard to overcome.
---
Yup, along with shadow priests, druids are most certainly viable in PVE. You wont see as many of either in a raid as you will other specs, but they still had a place.
---
If so then i should not worry as i am willing to put my time in to get there
---
Hah, the difference in number of rogues PvE and PvP is just as hilarious as I would have thought. 
---
What's AV? @
---
Don't worry, I'm sure you're not the method or limit of classic. You won't have that problem. 
---
How can you type so well when you are obviously blind?
---
alliance warlock sucks for pvp
---
oh hey it's the guy from Death and Taxes!
---
Never played WoW, i had 6 years when it launched. But i'm a fan of mmorpgs and i'm really hyped for the classic just because of videos and hearing friends talking about it.
---
You should do what specs people are going to play for each class. Interested in how many warriors will tank and how many paladins will dps haha
---
Perfect, good luck!
---
For me, there is no role as enjoyable, challenging and rewarding as tanking 
---
That's my experience as well. Really, the two main things that raids leaders cared about were:
---
1. Your spec. And that's only if you ran a really, really terrible one.
---
2. And Unequipping your damn fishing rod!
---
I feel confident we will see RP PvP on classic launch day, since it would be too much of a mistake for Blizzard not to have them. And blizzard is smart. 
---
How about warlock? Is their rank 13 way better than pve counterpart? How many different specs to they have to use? (Pvp, pve, world farming). How many gear sets does a shaman need if no enchament? Do shamans need to respec? 
---
&gt;The levelling process in vanilla zones (not having enough quests)
---
Well, I'd say that Normal servers give the opposite impression - you are basically always consumed by quests, without any room to freely roam around. While I like to sometimes think about how to get a level up to continue that zone, etc.
---
I agree hench why i asked what my odds were because i love how rewarding tanking is :)
---
I started in TBC so I feel like I have a decent grasp on how the game is going to function. That being said though I’ve been binging on classic/vanilla YouTube stuff for months now as well as reading forums and guides and what not. Can’t wait for summer. 
---
What's sap? 
---
Playing rogue on a PvE server would be such a waste of time, the entire class is built around non-consensual world pvp.
---
Not TB.  This is Thousand Needles...
---
Which is one of the things that I’m looking forward to seeing again when Classic drops.  
---
I found the Video, it was a Belluar vid where they counted the number of characters that were 111 at BFA launch and they got an estimate of about 1-2 Million players around launch. If the player count was as high as 8 Million why didnt they go public with such a feat? If you ask me 1-2 M seems reasonable considering how secretive they are with the sub numbers nowdays.
---
Why do people say this? Vanilla was easily the most raid orientated end game progression WoW has ever seen. It is literally the only way to get gear outside of pvp grinding (which in nearly every respect takes more work for less result).
---
Oh hey it's the guy from the countdown to classic podcast who was in Death and Taxes.
---
I started in early/mid 2008, a few months before Wrath dropped. So this is going to be a new experience for me, but one that I'm certainly looking forward to. 
---
I don't have any real knowledge of Classic barring some general tips such as questing guides, but I do watch nostalgia videos from WowCrendor and MadSeasonShow. Videos where they recall experiences they had in Classic and why they're excited to return.
---
One thing I noticed when playing the demo last November was the change in pace of combat. I don't know what combat was like at max level, but even lower level characters in BFA fight much more rapidly. It felt slow and sluggish, but for some reason I can't say that was a bad thing.
---
One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to is re-exploring the old world. Cata changed a lot of zones - some for better, others for worse - and I really want to check them out again. The big ones for me are Thousand Needles, Loch Modan, and Western Plaguelands (the last of which I don't have any memories of).
---
As for any negatives, I'm ready for most of the old Classic mechanics, but one thing I think I'll have a hard time with are the old character models. The new ones that came with WoD are just so nice and expressive, it will be hard getting use to the blocky, emotionless models of old. On the other hand, it would be incredibly jarring seeing a newer modeled avatar running around the old world (hell, it's weird today; set a player character next to an old gnoll or lion and the differences are night and day).
---
Honestly if old content had heroic versions that had relevant gear that would've been great. And throw in 1 BiS item to heroic raids of the old world would made it relevant hands down. Everything else I think wouldn't help really rather reduce the population interest in things like crafting due to time constraints.
---
Kind of necessary for some encounters given alliance lack shaman for tremor totem.
---
I know these guys! OSU Alum!
---
Because OSRS has constant development unlike classic will have. The devs made new updates and makes the community poll it. So a lot of things has changed since osrs came out, it's hardly the same game.
---
Sapped girls can't say "No".
---
hunter
---
Aka majority are basic bitches.
---
The problem with these charts is they need a race and class distribution that is independent. Having both just makes a lot of noise and obfuscates class distribution.
---
That's fair.  I still raid in BFA so im aware of the changes. I agree that you can't just auto-queue for a 10+ mythic (my qualms with "mandatory mythics" aside). 
---
That being said I think it's more of a community thing where a lot of people who are casual aren't still out looking for groups and you aren't, say, a healer.. joining a PUG.. finding an amazing tank.. and then inviting him to your guild in the same way you would in vanilla.  There are distinctions and it's really not as bad as people make it out to be I FEEL.  
---
yes! i played from cataclysm-bfa, with a break in between for wod. while i'll still come and play bfa from time to time, classic will be my main game.
---
1) i know some things. i played on a private server recently and my highest was a level 46 hunter. i wanted to go further, but decided to stop while i still could and wait so i would be refreshed for classic. i watch a lot of videos about cool and obscure quests, npcs, items ect in vanilla but i try to abstain from class guides and such because i don't want think about minmaxing too much.
---
2) my first character in cata was a hunter, so when i returned to that class for vanilla, i was really caught off guard to see things like a minimum range and melee weapons, ironically it was like a blast from the past. it was also strange to not have my hand held through basically every step of the leveling process. i felt like i had room to breathe and go off and do my own thing without getting a ton of popups and markers to make sure i was on the right path. 
---
3) the biggest positives for me were... the more open-ended leveling, as mentioned before, the sense of variety and real freedom with classes (my main since mop has been a destro lock. that means you only get fire spells. imagine my shock rolling a vanilla warlock and not having half of my spell set taken away from me based on my spec choice) and the community. oh my god the community. even tho the server i came from on bfa has a really small horde population and that should lead to people knowing each other, it really doesn't, bc you either seek out cross realm content or are automatically pushed into it (lfg, crossrealm battlegrounds, ect) and you have no idea who anybody is. i had more fun social interaction with randoms during a few months of vanilla than i had from 2012 to 2019. how sad is that?
---
i can't really say that there were any negatives for me, personally? the only thing that really bothered me was the lag, but i'm pretty sure that's just due to the server being overseas and won't be a problem in classic, so i can't count it as a true classic flaw. anyways, i'm hyped!
---
Yes, WoW at the time has ruined the job/career prospects for many kids of that generation, which have probably ended up being low educated and as a result now working 400% as hard for 50% of the same income. A silent tragedy and all that.
---
For some it has been a tool to pull through a shitty period in their lives, and not fall into the traps of doing stupid shit like hard drugs or suicide instead. But whatever the rest of the world wants to believe.
---
And while you're mentioning that they don't matter you should probably mention the agi difference is laughably small and makes no difference as well. PvP -&gt; dwarf, aesthetics -&gt; nelf. Case closed.
---
AH
---
True. I would say it’s more likely that we see the quests remain.
---
Would love to receive confirmation prior to the release.
---
it was removed in 1.10 when they reworked all stealth/invis, casting aimed shot from meld breaks it on start of cast instead of completion in 1.12
---
Two gathering profs to make gold (like herbing+skinning) then at 60 drop one of the gathering profs for blacksmith/alchemy/engi?
---
My main was a holy priest. 
---
My alt was a feral tanking Druid. 
---
Feral tanking is viable as your capable of reaching fantastic armor and hp levels.  The downside is you can be critted, and can’t really use healthpots.   The bonus is he can go cat after his mob is dead and deal more dps.  Still it’s an edge case. 
---
Neither of those as a big problem in raids with a good healers. You could drop bigger efficient heals on the Druid.  But as always you can’t replace the warrior MT on many fights.  
---
A single shadow priest is also great at buffing shadow damage from locks  (depending on what version of wow1.x we are talking about as it takes a debuff slot).  
---
We had a open for all mentally on our none progression raids in my guild.  Boomkin js also fun to have in the raid.  
---
But your 100% right that the game was tailored to you running as a specific spec.  
---
A feral cat is 90% of a rouge 
---
A feral tank is 90-95% of a port war
---
A boomkin is 90% of a mage 
---
A shadow priest heal to 95% of a holy priest, but lack Regen abilities in raids as if you spend points in holy you can’t spend them in discipline.  I tried a 31shadow 20 holy build for awhile and as long as we didn’t mess up it worked but as soon as shit hit fan my mana went out the window.  
---
Same as firemage in MC or BWL was not efficient at all.  
---
When your struggling to progress in a content, and you got a choice between a char that’s 90-95% of another, the pick is obvious.  That’s why you didn’t see retribution paladins etc in raids.  
---
You make your own odds.
---
What is the largest sack one can have? I'm trying to figure out the maximum bank space a single person can have. 
---
Back to the roots! Feels so good to see the race list trimmed down.
---
By your own admission that makes them great at two things (running flags + open world solo PvP). I won't debate your other two points because you clearly haven't thought this through.
---
It goes like this,”hey guys, I’m here to get caster loot. Is that cool, or do you want to find another healer? Won’t be offended.”
---
On a ppl don't equip a pvp trinket and use no potions/other consumables scale the typical call will most likely be rogue for the additional element of surprise
---
On a regular basis shadow (with the gear to pull it off) is king of 1v1s
---
mages can be rather nasty too, though they get shut down hard by good warlocks
---
on a ppl are more likely to actually have a pvp trinket on them and potions/consumables ready while they are out in the world
---
since we are going to start with 1.12 rogues aren't that hot anymore, it means stealth and stealth detect work rather different than during the glory days of rogue pvp and the other 8 classes are much more capable to handle them
---
Shadows struggle when consumables allow their targets to outlast them long enough. They are horribly inefficient when it comes to their mana consumption.
---
Mages rely massively on potions just to stay alive. In a world with physical dps scaling on a completely different level the easy kite of the early stages becomes the dreaded deathmatch when pvp gear and T2/AQ40 gear becomes a regular thing among your targets.
---
So what would I call the best for those open world encounters. If they know what they are doing, (and many think they do, but they don't) Then -  hands down - hunters.
---
The few really good ones will never allow you to stay close for long or to get close at all as open world doesn't enforce a duelling area on them. When they get their nasty xbows they brutalize cloth before you know what hits you - quite literally as they can do it through hills and trees and those who have half a brain know how to use track hidden and run around as lvl 66 entity as far as stealth detect goes - and rogues can tell you a story about how brutal stealth detect vs higher lvl entities is.
---
Warriors pre the BC prepatch or massively overgeared (aka naxx) have one really big problem. If people ignore them they lack the rage to be a big threat. While yes this doesn't mean that anyone wants to cuddle with them for too long, but a warrior really needs the rage from being attacked. Otherwise they really struggle to get anything done.
---
After waiting this long, we’re almost back home boys. It feels unreal to me.
---
My experience in this:
---
I leveled a warrior on northdale with the intention of being a DPS, started at launch. 
---
Tanked deadmines a few times, made some friends in different groups, continued leveling, tanking various dungeons, and making friends.
---
By the time I was level 55 I was getting whispers all the god damn time from people I'd grouped with while leveling "can you tank BRD?" "I'll give you 5g to tank ST for us dude!". I think the funniest bit was that sometimes other warriors would whisper me.
---
Before I even hit 60 I had been invited by several guilds to come in as an OT, they offered consumes, repair fees, help getting BiS gear. Now this all took place on a server where warriors outnumbered other classes even more than the polls here are projecting, and I didn't even want to tank, so yeah I'd wager you'll have plenty of luck finding a group to fall in with.
---
Well I was gonna do an Undead Mage but now I’m thinking Troll Rogue. 
---
RP stands for Role Playing. They are servers for people who want to pretend wow is a real world. From my memory the main enforcement from bliz is your characters need reasonable in world names (they don't have to be perfect but not xXDarkAssassinXx or such). The other thing is no talking about the real life in global chat (this was pretty loosely enforced). E.g. don't talk about last night's football match in city chat. Obviously whispers, party chat and guild chats weren't moderated.  From there people can take it as far as they like.  There were mods for writing and sharing a character back story if that was your thing.
---
By default RP realms were PVE, and RP-PVP were the PVP version. 
---
It’ll be beaten by raid gear every time though. 
---
That is not an accurate way to gauge overall players. It cannot account for people who have not had the chance to play BFA content yet like new players or those who are simply on the fence about purchasing the expansion. There is not real way to portray how many people only play on one or multiple characters and he only had a poll of 2800 people to decipher his numbers from in that regard. Warlords and Legion sold over 3 million copies at launch if I'm remembering Blizzard's numbers correctly.
---
The reason they don't "go public" is because they and shareholders probably derived that it negatively impacts them regardless of if it's positive or not. They don't want to break their stance they set a few years back about NOT releasing the numbers.
---
Also, FFXIV has been the second-biggest subscription-based MMO for years and I can tell you right now that it does not eclipse WoW as of current. Close, but not yet. 
---
That settles it. Couldn't decide between UD warlock or Tauren hunter. Definitely going Tauren hunter now.
---
The "not enough quests" isn't really noticeable IMO. Gives you a reason to hop in a dungeon, explore a new zone of the same level (IE westfall/Loch Modan), and if all else fails you can grind, but I never found that to be necessary.
---
Oh I’ve played on Defias Brotherhood EU all the way back in late vanilla/early burning crusade because of a great troll only RP guild called Second Gurubbish Empire. The guild was great but in the end I couldn’t stand the ganking so I left the server. In hindsight sight I reckon I may have been retaliatorly ganked because of the guild tag and how the guild made STV a completely no go area for alliance levelling. 
---
Also: interesting how many people think this spread is unlikely because “end game”. 
---
What percentage of players do you think will be focused on that?
---
If we know that they are starting the game in patch 1.12 then why is it such a big shock that we are getting 1.12 AV. 
---
Because we were hoping that by "authentic experience" it might include iconic experiences. When people reminisce about vanilla AV, it isn't 1.12. It's older versions with all the NPCs and matches that lasted hours or even over a day.
---
I have always enjoyed AV, even the zergfest it was as of WoD (when I quit), it's always been my favorite. I will be happy with 1.12 AV as it isn't quite the modern AV we know, but I'm still just disappointed that they won't at least take elements from older versions to create a more iconic experience.
---
Is there nostalgia? You bet!
---
But in the end, vanilla and retail are 2 completely different games. 
---
In my case its a simple choice.
---
I miss the RPG part of this game, and i miss it ever since the day WotLK launched. I don't think we can put nostalgia as the sole factor of choosing vanilla. 
---
Back then you were an adventurer, now you have your path laid for you. That simple thing is all the difference.
---
Yeah very true. I think the way they look puts people off, not only that I think people roll horde for PvP purposes and trolls are the worst race for that 
---
I plan on getting the set on a private server that I rolled on a few months ago. If I hang around long enough to see it release in actual Classic, then I'll never get it, because I would most likely have the rank 10 PvP set by then.
---
I wouldn't be upset if T0.5 came out a bit earlier than planned. Maybe a couple of months after the PvP system. 
---
&gt; My experience in this:
---
&gt; I leveled a warrior on a fresh private server with the intention of being a DPS, started at launch.
---
&gt; Tanked deadmines a few times, made some friends in different groups. Continued leveling, tanking various dungeons, and making friends.
---
&gt; By the time I was level 55 I was getting whispers all the god damn time from people I'd grouped with while leveling "can you tank BRD?" "I'll give you 5g to tank ST for us dude!". I think the funniest bit was that sometimes other warriors would whisper me.
---
&gt; Before I even hit 60 I had been invited by several guilds to come in as an OT, they offered consumes, repair fees, help getting BiS gear. Now this all took place on a server where warriors outnumbered other classes even more than the polls here are projecting, and I didn't even want to tank, so yeah I'd wager OP and anyone else who wants to will have plenty of luck finding a guild to tank for.
---
Well pvp in vanilla has no rating system, the only reward systems in the game just measure how much you play not how well you do. So asking if something is competitive or viable doesn't really make sense because there's no standard that will qualify the statement.  
---
In pvp like duels and premades with good players in good gear you will definitely be left behind unless you have engineering(mainly grenades and reflectors) and a full set of consumables (invisibility/swiftness/FAP/LAP). 
---
The leaf and black dragon sinew is, I do wonder if blue dragon sinew will drop in winterspring before azuregos release though
---
How long do you reckon until Blizzard give us a formal release date?
---
The metal looks doesn't suit the Orcs indeed. I do find it appealing that new Orgrimmar has got more stuff in it though. It feels like Blizzard spent the least attention to Orgrimmar when compared to UC, SW, IF, Darnassus, and TB (okay, TB is almost on par with Orgrimmar, as it's so small that it can't really be called a capitol).
---
I've heard many stories of people getting distant or losing people around them because of MMOs so I gotta disagree here. It gets worse for some.
---
I’m happy you get to experience the old WoW for the first time instead of playing current WoW
---
What about gnome warriors?
---
But rogue is also among the top DPS in PvE. While I understand that rogue is particularly high on PvP realms, it makes little sense that it is the second lowest on PvE realms.
---
Unless, you’re a friendly neighborhood spider rogue and you help people instead of camping them! 
---
Yeah pretty much. There's agi breakpoints where nelf gets 1% more crit then dwarf, but hunters aren't paragons of DPS, they're a tier 3 DPS at cap, you bring them for utility, not damage. Fuck, optimal hunter use is wing clip spam with nightfall, not actually shooting anything. 
---
Im glad they are listing. I want old AV. Longest match for me was 5 hours. Best time on WoW
---
It's pretty simple imo. Berserking just isn't good enough in PvE to make up for their looks and lack of utility in PvP.
---
Sword skill on the other hand feels more valuable to me in PvE than EA or SF do in PvP.
---
See you get the idea, it’s all about teaching the importance life lesson of not flagging on a PvP server and any your saving them a repair bill because PvP deaths don’t generate a repair cost. 
---
The older you get, the faster time goes.
---
/u/Devel484 did this for paladins:
---
&gt; 57(10,90%) - Tank
---
Yes but they've said it wasn't completed. I know it was in the demo, but they could back it up for Classic.
---
I wish I had my old screenshots.
---
I would rather it was just a one time fee and then free afterwards and not subscription based. But actigreedsion know what they are doing. Long time to level up and play, people will spend lots of time in the game. Sub-based will milk that cash-cow.
---
Antidarkness-antidespair stats [here](https://lightshope.org/stats)
---
18 slots
---
I disagree, I've known many "late night" style guilds over the years. They're less common, but there's surely people in the same boat. 
---
Rogue is half a second from scoring.
---
Ya, no thank you. I would like to able to actually level and play in certain zones. I don't care about the random gank or few people skirmishes or the raid entrance battles on Tuesday. I do not want TM vs SS or STV-nam again. Those things were not fun to non-60s because they were complete dead zones you couldn't play in.
---
I’m surprised at how low hunters seem to be. I remember not being able to escape having a hunter in a group. Hunters were everywhere. Like a plague. And majority were quite bad. 
---
Too much warlock happening here.  
---
If you sort those number for characters 1-30 Warriors make up like 33% of the server population 
---
i was like 9-10 when i first played in late vanilla. i was a gnome warrior named kenny and was obviously terrible at the game. i got to about 51 leveling as god damn prot for some reason when tbc came out (must’ve taken about 3? maybe 4 months?) so i’m ready to actually experience the game as someone with a fully developed brain finally.
---
Tanks and healers are always wanted. Dont stress, lvl and dont worry about it till after you get your mount.
---
Only one race pick for druid per faction, hence the weird data. They are still one of the least popular classes, especially end-game.
---
If you're just concerned with levelling efficiency most alliance dungeons are not worth it, so no, doing dungeons that you get 1 - 2 or no quests for and have to travel 40 mins + to get to are definitely not 'worth' it if you just want to level up.
---
Are the two mutually exclusive? A circle jerk is basically a hive mind with malicious intend (or the sexually monstrous if a literal circle jerk).
---
FYI, scarab lord is a massive guild effort. You either have the support needed to get it or you don’t. It’s a huge time investment for you and a large one for your guildies as well. 
---
Ohh yeah you’re right!
---
As a rogue those numbers make me happy. 
---
That makes me feel better. I just know I will not be able to motivate myself to grind.
---
It made sense, kinda, the problem was the withered and the preestablished lore surronding them. They should have been the alliance race, but the game was growing in popularity so fast I bet they didnt want to make an  'ugly' race playable and retconned the story a bit. 
---
Not many players and guilds get past BWL or even MC where the shortcomings of hunters are apparent.
---
But 1.5 AV lasted for 24 hours. You could start it, log off, and then finish it the next day in the same time play!
---
Cool stats, however for next time I'd recommend keeping the axes the same when comparing PvP and PvE. Makes it easier to judge differences, the way they are now the graphic gives a false view and requires you to read off the axes - which means you might as well just look at the tables to begin with. 
---
It’s called a compromise. I want no changes. I know there will be some changes. Blizzard offered the compromise I’ve been asking for this whole time. Aside from no loot trading of course.
---
They're already time-gating some items that drop from already existing bosses to a later phases, so that wouldn't be a problem.
---
I think they should, then again I plan too farm my classes set along with my pre raid BIS just because I want it. 
---
Nah fam. You’re letting the vocal minority get to you.
---
Scrub gang unite
---
My guess would be that everyone assumes that rogues are dime a dozen, so it will be hard to get a raid spot. Which is generally true.
---
People still roll them on pvp servers because it's fun to grief people, even if it'll be hard to get a raid spot.
---
But since you can't do all the "fun" things with them on pve servers, people chose different classes that will have easier time getting into the raids.
---
I don’t want any changes. I know there will be some no matter what I want. It’s called a compromise. It’s also being rational unlike most of the very vocal fanatics.
---
Or I could play a few games of 1.12 AV, log off, and come back later and have another few games of AV.
---
I expect some merges after the initial launch dies down with free transfers like they used to do. And then leave it at that.
---
Took me 4 months for the wintersaber mount 😂
---
Yeah but a shit ton are levels 1-5 because people make them as bank alts. 
---
I have about 15 people I'm trying to coordinate and I'm hoping and praying for a server list announcement ~1 week prior to launch.  I imagine a lot of people are going to be really disappointed if they don't do it this way.
---
Fair enough, I guess it wouldn't work very well with the current way classic is going but it'd be fun to see in a tweaked version of vanilla. 
---
You make a strong point for adding a "queue from anywhere"-option for BGs, I wouldn't complain if it was added
---
Same idk but I miss it more than lot of other zones
---
Taladril also has a druid gear list. I’m on mobile atm so I can’t link it.
---
ZG persists through death. Ony buff does not. 
---
Fair point
---
As a rogue ill use elixir of the mongoose. 
---
That's what most of my friends say too ^^
---
Gonna choose the one i started with. Arthas
---
Damn, you are absolutely right. That's what happens when the post is rushed.
---
OP is fake, gay, and wrong. 
---
I was planning on rolling tauren hunter regardless but I’m surprised to see that combo be the second lowest overall. 
---
Why did human kids in WoW and Warcraft 3 had [huge feet](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/2/28/Children%27s_week.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20051010225914)?
---
Definitely one of the best for class fantasy. I want to be a holy man, but I want to FIGHT. 
---
Yupp, had a guildie that tanked 5 mans at 60 as a pally, was better than most pug warrs. This was on a couple private servers.
---
Wait one day to start, and then in evening pick based on population. Experience says that most populated tend to stay the longest in other MMOs.
---
The broken\*  (the withered were the mana starved elves from Suramar) I believe should have 100% been the allied race.  The lore does describe them as the same as the draenei but they stayed behind.  so they changed and adapted to their new environment.  Both on outland and argus.  They were those who were too farm removed from the light.. but it seems to be a similar story to the withered about changing from losing your connection to your drug of choice (the light).. except they didn't seem to lose their minds in the process.
---
But yes I agree it should have just been them.
---
I think theres a bunch of factors at play:
---
-the class appeals to a certain type of player, typically those who enjoy stabbing stuff that is unaware that it is about to get stabbed, hostile faction members included.
---
-rogues don't suck to level on pvp servers, getting ganked is only a real possibility if everything you have is on CD. In fact most people your level will avoid ganking you because they don't want to get stabbed at the next inopportune moment.
---
-warriors do more dps and roll/take priority on a lot of the same gear
---
Holy shit hunters have a lot of buttons
---
These are some weird results but I guess Paladin is so high because only one race can play it and it’s not split but it’s still way higher than I expected
---
I'm leveling a Tauren Warrior on Classic. I was thinking of going Herbalism/Alchemy, but recently I've been thinking it'd be better to go Mining/Engineering. I know Engineering is better for end game (AoE tanking with grenades). What do you guys think? (For the record, I'm not planning on being one of the first on my server with 300 Alchemy, so I don't plan on getting a flask recipe or anything.)
---
Guides? We just casted resurrection during encounters.
---
This is my end goal as well, I'm planning on rolling paladin if you want to farm instances together :)
---
You might have sold me.
---
The shitty part is 90% those unique names will stay on level 1 alts forever
---
Live and learn :)
---
baaaaaaaaaaased
---
I do both on pvp servers, sometimes I even kill them after I help them.
---
If they change their mind on RP-PvP servers and I have access to one from Australia (we used to have access to US servers, don't know if that's still the case), I'll take that.
---
Otherwise, coolest PvP server name in Oceanic region.
---
Yeah I had plenty of MC gear in Vanilla and was still doing the T0.5 questline just because it was interesting content.  Unfortunately I was cockblocked by a lack of T0 pants.  But I think it was awesome to have some raid caliber 5-man experiences.  Almost like the precursor to the original TBC heroics.
---
Really hope they don't allow things like umlauts and other ways to bypass name restrictions.
---
hope they aren't
---
There are herbalism/enchanting bags that only hold trade mats that are 28 slots, these are usually best in your bank. There's a 28 slot soul bag for Warlocks. Otherwise, you're likely to get 2x18 slot bags for your inventory (one from Ony and one from AD rep) and the other 3 will be 16 slot. Though it takes a few dungeon runs to get full 16 slot bags at 60.
---
The beam "only" his for 50k while decimate reduces health 95%.  The 50k would take a long time to reduce 1.7 million HP.  
---
I don’t want to play Dwarf Priest but Human sucks. I need to decide if aesthetics &gt; effectiveness. I played Dwarf on a pserver and hated the look the entire time but god damnit I want the racials. Also I hate Horde leveling in vanilla. 
---
Wall walkers UNITE!!!! 
---
deleted?
---
Lol, I don't have a good answer to that.  However, none of the class calls are really damning, so I think he would probably lose most Naxx bosses
---
I'll wait 1 week before I start playing and see how populated the servers are, where the streamers will play etc. I know ill be 1 week behind but imo it's worth it, at least I know I chose the right server when I start playing without worrying 
---
Troll rogue represent. Big spooky invis bois
---
I suppose you should also learn to act like a prime girl in vanilla, couse you have to show 40 people that you are the lady. Tanking is nothing special, just press buttons at the right time if you have a little of a brain and gg.
---
Not sure how accurate this is since every BG they have 6 UD rogues around the flag, 4 UD mages on offense, and then in mid you'll find 20 more UD rogues.
---
That's a fair point. Even during later BWL the lack of scaling shows pretty badly. 
---
I honestly doubt they'll do any server merges since they've never done that before.
---
I would be surprised if more than 30%of any class gets to lv60
---
Unless they're orc girls.
---
Is dwarf warrior not a thing? I don’t see it on there.. I was gonna play that &gt;.&gt;
---
It doesn't work like that, there are many types of PvP and all classes are good in certain situations and bad in other. There is wpvp, group pvp, battlegrounds and duels. It depends on what you want to be good at.

Another SGE ex-member reporting in. Was a member during late Vanilla early TBC.
---
Heelvsbabyface had a video about active characters per server.  I think it came out to roughly 2.5 million active characters.  
---
Note: these are characters not accounts, if the average player has 3 characters that meet the "active" requirements that's less than 1 million players.  But we have no real way to know for sure.
---

made me smile to see orc rogues at like 3% on that poll

Few people are trolling
---
The great thing about RP servers in general was always that there was just less idiots around in general. However, regular RP servers were just slightly more mature PVE servers. The WPVP events that happened on RP PVP were simply legendary in Vanilla-TBC times.
---
Would be a huge disappointment if no RP-PVP servers are offered.
---
That is absolutely a compromise I could deal with. In either case, you can effectively never run out of shards, for if you could stack 400 over perhaps only 20 bag slots - or even more if it were treated like ammo stacks - it’s near the same in a BG.
---
I still like sharing stacking slightly better, since the possibility to run out of shards in a BG *still exists*, however unlikely. Either way works though.
---
I look forward to eating your 2k chain lightning crits and shitting out honor.
---
You mean a giant toe? Bow down to our superiority.
---
Fury can tank 5 mans tho, if theyre willing. 
---
That is my choice for all of my Dwarf queens (yes, plural) 😈 
---
OK, stay wrong son. 
---
Yeah charts from the private servers is way more representative of what the actual demographic will look like. Certain classes are going to burn out big time while leveling.
---
And the AV bridge of death
---
Lupos is not going to change that much even if your wish would be granted. He wasn't dealing hundreds of additional dps. He was just losing no dmg to armor mitigation.  It's not like a shadow dmg Lupos would elevate poorly played and itemized hunters. Pet scaling was still in such a bad state even in 1.12 and it got multiple changes throughout the following xpacs
---
Teach your hunters to down potions instead of lazy feign death's to sit down and idle for 24-30 seconds to drink and get it into their heads that T2 is the pinnacle in terms of armor sets for them. As long as they treat  T2.5 and T3 as their off spec gear for everything outisde of raids they will be fine in AQ and naxx (aside from resistance fights)
---
There is a reason why hunters had to go through the (poorly implemented and therefore brutally exploited with the dreaded vul-exploit) vulnerability system in legion. The inspiration for it came from the old t2 set and the flipping overpowered snowballing that came from it.
---
You guys all remember pvp very differently than I did...
---
As someone who has recently started playing on a private server and starting tanking. It’s a LOT of fun, very engaging compared to retail. I can totally see why a lot of people don’t like it although, you have to be more aware of your healers mana than anything else, you have to knowledge of aggro range of mobs, use a ranged weapon when necessary. It really shows when you’re trying.
---
You must be new to wow, they have done that many many times in the past. 
---
A note in favour off playing non orc/human for warriors and rogues. As most people will be orc or human, playing the off race choice may get you higher loot priority for other weapon types. In my guild every orc warrior wanted deathbringer and Nef’s axe. We had limited drops for a long time, so the undead who took the BWL fist weapon or brutality blade, etc, got geared up far quicker 
---
Top notch video, but all I could picture while watching was a Khajiit doing an impersonation of a Scot.

its just that some classes use both elixirs and flask

Sin strike, 15 sec slice and dice, berserk, adrenaline rush, sin strike sin strike sin strike sin strike sin strike etcetera foeva
---
Exactly! Why do people not understand this... Seriously, Classic will not be 100% 1.12, but merely use 1.12 as a base/foundation! 
---
&gt; 1.12 AV is basically retail AV
---
...and other fun lies you can tell yourself! You go try soloing one of the elite commanders that you all say have been nerfed to uselessness and let me know how that goes.
---
Everyone seems to be conveniently forgetting about 2.3, which _actually_ removed most of the NPCs, and added reinforcements.
---
I think it's because the game starts the moment you make your character.
---
In retail, there's no substance in the 1-120. Only 120 matters.
---
Yeah I guess you’re set gold-wise if you have an alt rogue in naxx patch. Although maybe guilds will create rogue alts to farm the runes and many rogues will want to sell them so the price could drop.
---
Disc is good for both PvP and PvE and raid leaders are fine with having disc in a raid because you bring some utility like Power Infusion which you put on a mage and holy shit...and it works in PvP really well. In fact, it's a hard counter to shadow priest because you can pop PI and mana burn them to the point they are useless.
---
Disc doesn't go after spirit like holy and doesnt' get the extra 10% healing buff holy gives, but they are damn good healers and bring the utility like I said.
---
Most of them can't read, so they didn't participate in the survey.
---
...no? They've never merged servers... Connected Realms =/= merging realms.
---
It’s really the opposite, ret doesn’t have access to any actual gear that’s made for the spec unless you try hard pvp for rank 13. When AQ comes out t2.5 becomes an option and ret finally has a gear set, making them actually scale very well compared to early game.
---
If the realm lists are published in advance, communities (like this subreddit) will coalesce around specific servers in advance. Those in the know will be on those servers, and the tourist/server decline risk will be less.
---
&gt;most guards are completely removed or in such a nerfed state they basically don't exist unless fully upgraded
---
You are describing 2.3 AV, FYI. 1.12 still had the patrolling elite NPCs like commanders and lieutenants, and they will definitely massively fuck your day up.
---
I know this sub doesn't care, but I thought I'd mention it for anyone who isn't just trying to circlejerk.
---
Thanks! I’m surprised it’s more tanking than dps for warriors honestly. 
---
Why do troll rogues get no love?
---
The convention is, if you need it, roll need. If you want it for rp or a collection ask if anyone needs first. If you want to roll on something off spec (you're a priest but want some cloth dps gear for a shadow set) ask the group leader if it's ok before you join or if it's your group let everyone know your plans before you start. But be reasonable if something drops that's an immediate upgrade for someone else or if it's the only thing someone came for.  A good golden rule is, don't be a dick. 
---
Because Classic will only use 1.12 as a base/foundation. Everything from earlier patches are up for discussion! And 1.12 AV is surprising because most thought it was bad cuz of the fast games. 
---
If you read the introduction about AV  from Blizz when they first added it, they y’all about what AV was meant to be - a WAR with mix of PvE and PvP aspects (which 1.12 AV surely does not feel like).
---
Combat is nice for leveling, and honestly not that bad in pvp. You trade prep for ad rush which is a downgrade in pvp overall, but it will pretty much let you guarantee a kill in 1v1. Nice in open world where you can walk away after or lurk for a few minutes until the next set of cool-downs.
---
You know it!
---
Survival Hunter is excellent PvP. 
---
It is interesting to see how people still don't min-max class/race combos nearly as much as as some people say and often choose to pick for flavor.
---
There are basically three min-max options: pure PvE, pure PvP and an optimal hybrid tradeoff between them for people who do both. The majority of people play (almost) pure PvE, there is a good portion that plays both and a minority focusses on PvP.
---
Horde:
---
For Mages there is Troll for PvE and UD for PvP min-maxing. I highly doubt that the high representation of Undead Mages is in line with that.
---
For Warlocks Undead are also slightly overrepresented in terms of min-maxing. The large benefits of Orc Warlocks in PvP should outweigh the small gains of a Undead Warlock in PvE due to having caster stats. But it this one isn't as big.
---
Undead Rogues are *heavily* overrepresented. There is Troll for pure PvE due to having the highest agility and Berserk, Orc for pure PvP and for PvP/PvE hybrid due to having good melee stats and racials including stun resistance which beats out WotF any day.
---
Alliance:
---
Even though Dwarfs have the biggest share of the Priest population there are no reasons to *not* choose them over other races, not even in terms of hybrid tradeoffs, or situational advantages. If people would be min-maxing as much as is told there would be almost no NE and Humand priests.
---
Human Paladins are overrepresented allthough slightly. For PvE there is no big difference but for PvP/both Dwarf trumps over Human.
---
Conclusion:
---
Most or alot of people still choose their race mostly based on flavor.
---
WoW helped me get through some of the hardest times of my life. I played WoW instead of distracting myself through drugs or lashing out in negative ways. I’ll always appreciate the game for that

Good thing noone plays female orcs
---
I'll show you.
---
Sap is not a stun though...
---
I am definitely with you on the first two points. The last one I don't really know, I never made that experience.
---
Hunters attracts more casual players, because they’re so easy to level, which you won’t find on a subreddit for classicwow. Don’t worry, when classic launches we’re probably only like 5%~ish of the playerbase, so these results are quite skewed.
---
Exactly thats why I cant understand why people are still complaining about it... Like if I want to spend my dkp or if I get lucky I should be able to decide what I want to do with my piece of gear.
---
Good stuff! 
---
Reinforcements are useless and yes I know it doesn't remove all the NPC's but it makes AV play like it has been played on all other expansions in retail.
---
Most people in this subreddit probably know that hunters' DPS scales really badly throughout the content and thus are less inclined to play them. I think this data is not really representative of the vast majority.

Spriest is the undisputed king of solo pvp, theres no rock/paper/scissors, they don't have a true counter.

I mean I get that, but it just seems a weird thing to say that 'there were many other forms of meaningful progression outside of raiding' when what you really mean is play an alt.

Druids look numerous on those charts because there's only one race in each faction that can be druids, while all the other class-faction options are split at least 2 ways.  But if you total the number of each class for each faction, druids are the least numerous class in each faction (although their total across both factions is marginally higher than either paladins or shamans).
---
Many people probably factored the demand for tanks into their choice. And tanking was pretty fun in vanilla
---
Well I think t.05 was supposed to be catchup gear for non-raiders. So it's not that they were "too late" as much as they were just not made for people who already had good gear. 
---
I played the 3 trinity roles back in Vanilla. **For me**, tanking was by far the most demanding one, healing was the most relaxing one. DPS depended on the class : mage is easy, but hunter is quite taxing APM wise if you want to be at your best.
---
However I only raided as a warrior, my experience with the other roles were in dungeons.
---
How though? They had no proper debuff to give, and their buff was a mere 3% crit for casters. 
---
There is the bottomless bag too, 18 slot but will cost over 100g each. Maybe 200, depends on the cost of mooncloth. Realistically you'll have 16 slot bags in most spots for a long time. 
---
Rank 13 is BiS for all cloth caster.
---
Warlocks raid with either one of two specs: 30/0/21 SM/Ruin or 7/21/23 DS/Ruin.  
---
SM/R's job is to buff the tank group with Blood Pact and DS/R is the default min/maxed PvE spec. SM/R is the most solo friendly raid spec and DS/R is kind of crappy since you can't have a pet out or you lose 15% damage output. Warlocks are expected to respec every week assuming they're not fulltime PvE spec. Regarding PvP specs there are a bunch of PvP specs and all of the PvP specs range from decent to great for soloing since they're min/maxed for survivability and damage.
---
Shamans really only *need* two sets if they're Ele/Resto as far as I know. One min/maxed PvE healing set and one PvP damage/healing set. That said, people who like to min/max will set up different gear sets for trash or bosses to help speed up clear times. Usually that means swapping a few gear pieces in and out rather than swapping a full set.
---
When it comes to PvE healing as Shaman you can raid in PvP spec *if* raid content is on farm status. Farm status meaning there's no risk of wiping to the current end boss. If you're still progressing you should be fully PvE specced every week until content is on farm. Good news is progression lasts a very short time among experienced raiders. In that sense all healers are lucky because all of the PvP healing specs are fine for PvE even if they're not min/maxed.
---
Been dropping the berserk rotation for a decade, still aint tired of it!
---
I think that they should be released alongside AQ or at a halfway point between BWL and AQ. You don't want them too early for that trivializes some gear from 5 mans and makes early raids easier. 
---
If I were you I’d go for off-tank instead. 
---
This post has convinced me to roll a warlock and not a warrior
---
True fact: Not everyone PVP's or played BG's back in the day.
---
Then become a guild leader. No sane people will play with and equip a MT that might get stolen by a more advanced guild.
---
Depends on your timeframe. You certainly won't make the cut in a tryhard world/realm first guild, but many more casual guilds will probably accept you.
---
I think people wildly underestimate mage/lock/spriest versus hunter. A blink/frost nova basically fucks you as a hunter, a warlocks void sac, death coil, quick summon, void sac, keeps them alive for more than long enough for their dots to chunk a hunter down, and Spriests just have to look at you for 15 seconds and your brain melts. 
---
I feel you. When I started and hit level 52, I bought Bloodrazor on a Warlock - an epic sword for 100g with 0 stats, went around meleeing creeps because I was so proud of my first epic
---
DK was added later into the game and you can argue both cases.
---
But of course they were removed in 2.0.1 because the fucking ranking system was removed rendering them useless.......
---
Because they are objectively pretty bad, if not the worst for rogues.
---
yeah. whether i prefer chocolate or strawberry ice cream is also not driven by choice because of so many factors like how many scoops, cone or cup, might as well be random. completely random and will regress to 50/50 every time. 
---
cringe
---
I can see how one might think so if you've only played AV after TBC and don't remember how it was before, but reinforcements were not useless when added. 
---
Reinforcements force the zerg meta. Why do you think they added reinforcements in the first place? It was because AVs would still go on for many hours and this was simply too long in Blizzard's opinion. They wouldn't have added reinforcements if that wasn't the case...
---
You're actually retarded, they have indeed merged servers at some points, and at other points they have offered free transfers from over populated realms to low population realms. More recently yes they have introduced cross server in retail and eliminated the need for merges, that doesn't change the fact that they have done merges in the past.
---
Once you start raiding it changes a bit, but warriors will roll on tons of BiS leather/1h swords, its quite annoying.
---
Whichever my guild picks.
---
The scale on the PvP and PvE graphs is bad and annoying. Makes it harder to read and will mislead people. 
---
I mean how would they have ascended the rocks with heavy gear like logs and big tents without having a trail first?
---
One last piece of advice... shine in MC.  It needs more tanks than BWL so keep your spot ;)
---
People zerg without reinforcements too, there's literally zero reason not to.

I don’t play on pvp servers except on pservers cuz theres no choice. Less rogues on non pvp servers means more loot for me.
---
I thought they were resistant to all incapacitating effects, sap included.
---
I wont. Ill create my chars with my names on like 5-10 server (depending on total numbers), then let it go for a month. 
---
I never wasted one as a rogue. There’s plenty of consumables you can use but I’d not waste the gold on a flask.
---
To encourage world pvp, but not force it you should simply make world pvp more lucrative honor wise then BG's. As others have mentioned it will be hard to quest as a lowbie, getting mulched constantly. Re-add DKs, and massively increase the amount they remove. If the value of an HK in the world is enough then world pvp will happen. Also adding more of the world pvp objectives to high level zones might help.
---
Somebody already pointed that out, I am sorry for not seeing that before posting. I would fix it, if I could. Only way I see would be to delete this post and make a new one.
---
It is all going to depend on the raiding you want to do. My advice as a main tank player for 12+ years, 2-3 hours a day isn't going to be enough for any serious raiding. However if you can be reliable and are a good player, there is going to be a guild who will let you tank. Playing that little it's going to take you a long time to get to 60, get geared and be a raid ready tank, you're probably talking 3 months at 2 hours a day? Maybe less maybe more. I would encourage you to tank if it's what you like doing. Even if you can't main tank raids the demand for tanks in 5 man's is insane!
---
Well I see it as a sign they are really taking the vanilla experience seriously. See RP server didn’t come to wow until about 3 or so weeks after release and RP PvP server didn’t come until a good 4 months had passed. 
---
He's wrong tbh. Yeah, at top-end gear, warriors scale harder and outdps rogues. But rogues are stronger in PvE dps for most of the game, and a lot of the gear that is BiS for warriors that they can get preraid that make them stronger early won't be in the game at launch.
---
So yeah. TBH, the dps difference between fury warriors and rogues is pretty negligible for a huge chunk of raiding. Comes down to preference. 
---
Seriously, it's kinda crazy to me how overblown it is on here. I never noticed it on any of the four characters I levelled in Vanilla (two to 60, one to 39 one to 30)
---
It won’t stagnate for me. I have 10 character slots. That’s a lot of content.
---
I mean hunters just feel like a pain in the ass to play for me. Ammo, pet happiness, your big cool item is a plant bow... you don't do a lot of raid dps. Your job is to level fast, kite some shit, tranq shot Magmadar, and give the rogues/warriors trueshot aura. 
---
Kek 
---
I'll take 10 of those self discipline bars you're having my man.
---
Innervate, battle res, cleanse poison over time spell that I forget the name of. If you've got a lax group and you can powershift perfectly, feral DPS is alright in most cases. Obviously boomkin isn't gonna happen unless you're doing a drunken raid or all casters or somehting. Overall it's around no more than 3 druids per 40 man, but that's still something.
---
I quit pvp when they got rid of same server. If it’s not same server I just won’t pvp.
---
So you think we had 15 minute battlegrounds and that's why they added reinforcement counter and removed elite NPCs in TBC? You realize how absurd your claim sounds, surely?
---
And people assume there will be an ocean of fury warriors, too. Which, at least on private servers, there are. 
---
I said this sometime a month ago; Play what you want to play, you're the one playing and not the min/maxers.
---
As a prot you might never get to see naxx but seeing how that's not what you're after yourself that dosen't really matter. And all depending on how far the progression is when you wanna pug mc, you might be able to even tank MC as a prot paladin. 
---
The game needs to launch, and we both need to get to 60 lol
---
I'm sorry that you can't handle being wrong, but *they never merged servers*. I'm not talking about cross realm, genius:
---
[**Connected Realms** also allow us to link populations in a way that’s not disruptive to players, and that doesn’t negatively impact players’ sense of identity and character. Other alternatives such as merging realms would require us to force character name changes if there were conflicts, and could lead to confusion for returning players who’d log in to find their realm missing from the realm list. Some players also feel strong ties to their realm’s name or history, and we don’t want to erase that.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/10551009)

Me and my ex-guild (~50 people) are completely devastated by this terrible news.

&gt; When people reminisce about vanilla AV, it isn't 1.12
---
What makes you say that? 1.11 AV was in the game for the last half year of vanilla, longer than any other version, as well as TBC pre-patch. With vanilla's explosive growth and how slow the average person leveled, that is _by far_ the version of AV that the most amount of people experienced.
---
YOU may not be reminiscing about that version, but do not delude yourself into thinking you can speak for everyone on that matter.
---
What happens when two characters with the same name but different realm get merged?
---
do u think rogues get away with spending less for raid days? compared to other classes
---
I wouldn't play Hunter if I don't like pet management.  Imo
---
No, it's still driven by choice - individually. Individually it won't regress to 50/50 every time, since obviously there will be certain things/options that person would prefer over others. But when you gauge a bunch of people then there are so many different things/factors and preferences that overall the result will tend to normalize.
---
Because the base file IS 1.12. It would require a significant amount of work and playtesting to revert those files back to the 1.8 (or earlier 1.5) version. It's not as simple as throwing an old batch version in the files. We're also not even sure that they have those files.
---
The only files they've confirmed to have is the 1.12 server files. It would be asking them to reverse engineer all of those changes and essentially guess about a lot of variables. I love 1.8 AV personally, and think it's the happy medium between 1.5 and 1.12. However, it's not realistic to expect the team to do that when the 1.12 version is the most functional, and also innately already within the game files they're operating with.
---
All meme specs I can think of are only meme for a particular area of the game. Paladins raid holy, but can heal, tank, or dps 5mans and can ret or heal PvP. Shamans raid resto but can PvP or 5 man ele just fine. Druids can raid feral or resto, but other specs are fine everywhere else. 
---
Idc about what you had back when people didn't know how to play the game mate.
---
Orc Warrior babyyyyyt
---
Follow private server players + avoid streamers.  
---
That's the best strategy I can think of.  
---
Healer is stressful as fuck. Seeing the life of the main tank doing the yo-yo is difficult as fuck
---
I would guess the average player doesn't care too much about racials. They want their rogue to look cool in tier sets, or their warrior to be a massive minotaur towering over their enemies, or play Ret because Deus Vult. People do weird stuff for weird reasons. Doesn't matter much in the end, everyone can have fun with the right expectations.
---
Agreed. Hoping these numbers aren’t representative of how it actually falls. 
---
This is one of the reasons they never did realm merges. I linked a reply to this guy with the way they "connected realms" before if you want to read it.
---
for most games... maybe. i still think the average player these days is online following the games they play online. 
---
but we’re talking about a relaunch of a 15 year old game. it’s being brought back because forums asked for it back. the classic player base is online and on forums more than most games. 
---
Gonna have to break some news for all those shaman looking to dps.
---
lol... so your argument is that we should change AV because private server people, who are a tiny minority of very hardcore players, zerged their version of AV?
---
That is equally absurd.
---
u wont be reliable so its gonna suck

you somehow need 4h a raid day x2 a week

I was already planning to play a troll rogue and a tauren hunter, but it's nice to see I can look forward to further satisfying my natural inclination toward being reflexively contrarian in doing so.
---
I had a 60 troll rogue and 60 dwarf rogue in vanilla, interesting to see that no one played those combos.
---
I'm doing the same thing with names. When I've finally picked my server, I'm gonna delete the names I've reserved on the other realms so I'm not a butt.
---
I've not played retail vanilla, started retail in late BC. But have played private server vanilla since 2011 and have hit 60 on 5 different characters, done some raiding and even raid leading. Not sure my experience is similar to others. 
---
Ofc.
---
It's very different from Retail AV.
---
The elite mobs and commanders are still present, troop upgrades, elemental lords, etc. are still available. The reinforcements mechanic hasn't been added yet.
---
Yes, it's different from AV at launch-- but spreading misinformation like this is what causes the mass hysteria on this subreddit and on the Classic forums.
---
It's not that pservers is a small group for very hardcore players. It's good bad normal players and with current meta people will zerg even on pre 1.8.
---
Had another survey at https://barrens.chat, that had priests WAYYYYYYY lower. Interesting. 🤔
---
Thank you a lot for all the help! Shaman it is for me then!
---
For sure at 30 I’d respec rather than use a suboptimal build until you got hemo anyways. 
---
What’s the best class to play if I’m playing with friends who are rolling a priest and paladin? We are looking to do both PvE and PvP, moreso PvP (world and bg). I’ve narrowed it down to rogue, lock, or warrior.
---
Will one of these classes be a better fit or are they all pretty much equal? I’ve read warrior would be pretty devastating but I feel like any class could work equally as well with two pocket healers. 
---
You're absolutely wrong lol.  Connected realms ARE a thing.  They have also merged servers.  My server was merged with 2 other low pop servers. 
---
Definitely need a pet; can't really get around it unless you want to seriously hinder yourself.
---
Never raided as a hunter, but in dungeons there wasn't much pet maintenance.  You can usually just have the pet attack the same target you're attacking with all the same abilities on autocast.  Just make sure to disable growl, and maybe turn on autocast cower if your tank is having threat issues.  This won't be the ideal min-max usage of the class, but it'll get you through without any issues.
---
For solo questing/grinding, if you want you can just have the pet on defensive with growl and other abilities on autocast; won't need to interact with the pet beyond that.  Again, this won't be ideal, but it's definitely workable and won't cause too many issues.
---
This is just pserver experience though, so dunno if/how things'll change in Classic.
---
Because ret and prot are both trash so 34% are going to farm boars in a field at endgame?
---
For sure. I'm just looking at it from a powergaming perspective. 
---
At the end of the day, and class/race combo can clear naxx, so it doesn't really matter.
---
Pve wise it's full fledged progression. No one will\can skip that and go from bwl into naxx. It's called 2.5 mostly because the class gear wasn't a huge upgrade from t2. At least not as much as the leap from t1 to t2. 
---
34% is a lot of morons
---
That's an orc shaman though...
---
Berserking makes them one of the best for pve though.
---
Enchanting seems like a waste since you can just make a level 5 alt to disenchant your stuff. You miss out on the BOPs, but hopefully you run with an enchanter in your group anyways who can split the shards. That frees up a spot for Mining, if you want to take that.
---
Skinning is decent in the early game for a bunch of easy extra vendor fodder, but eventually you'll want to switch off of it. 
---
Rogues will also have pickpocket as a decent gold generator. Keep in mind it was nerfed on private servers.
---
You make a combative post as if to disagree with me by agreeing with me. Interesting.
---
oh did I lol sorry, I'm a pretty confontational person, it happens. 
---
they did it with thunder bluff
---
Also, I logged on today to do the BFA intro, they've merged servers for things like open world and guilds even. Doesn't seem like they'd do that if there weren't population problems.
---
Yep. Best ones to run to Stormwind to be a banker.
---
Brilliant. Can you remember a level 43-53 troll mage who role played (rather badly) as a peasant/farmer/fisherman or whatever that guild rank was? I was never really active on the role playing side, I much prefer to keep to myself and rather experience it by watching other players do the actual role playing. I would often sit for hours at a time with my fishing pole on my back in Grom’gol or wherever else the guild was role playing at the time. 
---
&gt; You miss out on the BOPs, but hopefully you run with an enchanter in your group 
---
you solo most of those runs so there wont be anyone else to disenchant for you
---
That'll do, pig. That'll do.
---
eh, people will play what they feel like playing, and who knows maybe two years from now blizz will start tweaking class balance to keep things fresh.
---
I'm going mining + herb to start. Eventually I'll drop mining after epic mount pre bis etc and use many of the mats from mining to level engineering
---
You gotta be in your zone for it 
---
You sir must be a sadist. 
---
Aren’t those shaman shoulders?
---
Might be just a horribly disfigured human paladin who can't afford dental care.
---
This is true, but what good is a shiny new weapon without someone to surprise with it?
---
While they don't have a true counter, they are incredibly predictable in what they do. SPriest is a one trick pony with little room for variation. A good mage, rogue or warlock can kill an SPriest. 
---
I love the look of trolls but hate reading their speech.
---
Connected Realms *are* Blizzards "merged" servers. [I don't know why this is so hard to understand.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Connected_Realms)
---
Feels good to be Alliance Warlock. So many people scared away just because of some racial.
---
One of the reasons I like druid is the relatively low population and this chart does make them look more popular than they are.  For anyone interested in just classes from OP's data here's what they add up too:
---
Warrior - 17.63%
---
Mage - 14.00 %
---
Paladin - 13.86%
---
Priest - 12.99%
---
Hunter - 10.82%
---
Warlock - 10.44%
---
Rogue - 10.36%
---
Druid - 9.89%
---
Warrior - 18.09%
---
Shaman - 14.61%
---
Warlock - 13.91%
---
Mage - 13.00%
---
Rogue - 12.36%
---
Priest - 12.16%
---
Druid - 8.10%
---
Hunter - 7.77%
---
Weird how Horde hunters are so low, especially relative to Alliance hunters because as far as I know there aren't any huge race advantages making alliance hunters better than horde (like Warlock, where Horde being more popular is understandable because they don't have to pvp vs undead.)
---
Don't break my immersion! &gt;:(
---
As long as you can fit the raid time into that window, you can maintain your consumables/gold in that timeframe easily AFTER you're setup. 
---
Basically, if you go really hard at the start and get set for gold and professions early so you can keep generating more gold, then you can play a lot less and still generate gold/have the money you need to raid. If not, you might find yourself perpetually poor in terms gold if you're only logging a couple hours max per day.
---
Either way, there will definitely be room for you in some guild on whichever server you pick, just have to find it
---
I never said there were no patrolling guards or elite commanders, but according to the patch notes many of them are absent in this version.
---
Either way, it still a trend towards base rush meta for rewards rather than actual PvP, which is fine if that is your thing. But I'm still going to focus more on killing as that is something I enjoy regardless of what version we have to play with.
---
True, but I thought it would be a good method to actually show the number of people who are interested in playing RP PvP. It is great people are talking about it, and please keep doing so, but I thought it would be a good idea to have something to show to Blizzard instead of making a couple of scattered threads and whatnot.
---
Dunno if a petition is the answer, but it never hurts to try/sign right? So be sure to let as many people sign and talk about wanting a RP PvP server at launch.
---
No it’s not. Why don’t you just accept that you’re wrong.
---
If you mean free as in blood, sweat and tears by raiding, then yeah sure
---
alliance
---
eh if you arent a fan of pet/tick tock dps dont warlock then
---
I'm fairly sure I still have a mechanical yeti from like 2006 that I've never used, and am still saving "until the time is right" lol.
---
I have never played Retail, but I was interested for a long time. All the stories about the game dying etc. deterred me from starting. Nearly two years ago a friend of mine invited me to play on a private server (Elysium) and taught me the ropes, after which I have played a lot (and level capped) on various private servers (not just vanilla, but TBC and WotLK as well).
---
The one issue I had as a newbie was the hostility of the players (hopefully not the case in Classic). I just didn't  really know how to go about forming dungeon groups and how dungeons worked in general, and as most of the other low level players were definitely not first characters, I abstained from most group content (including raids altogether).
---
When Classic was announced, I was just as excited as a long-time Vanilla fan. Since then, I have followed most forms of media for updates and guides for Classic, mostly via all the great content creators on YouTube.
---
Also, I'm very keen on completionism, which is why I like the Achievement system introduced in WotLK. Pointless as it is, I enjoy challenges defined by the game more than challenges I set myself. I already know I'll be trying to collect any Recipes for whatever professions I have and completing every quest I can once Classic launches, but I would have enjoyed some arbitrary achievement system as well (although I completely understand why many would not want anything like it). 
---
How about some sources from at least 1 of you trolls, then? What realms were merged?
---
So. many. valor shoulders.
---
Game knowledge sure did improve over the years! :D
---
i’m being sarcastic of course ice cream preference is driven by choice and not randomness. 
---
They have better healbot stats than Lightforge.
---
Can someone give me a rundown on what exactly healing a dungeon/raid is like as a priest and what it involves. I’ve never played a healer and the idea of trying to manage 4 other players health, let alone 39, sounds daunting. I assume there will be addons that will help, but I’d like to hear a hypothetical run from a veteran
---
The short answer is 'yes'! If you wanna tank, get stuck and do it mate! Just be realistic - you're probably not gonna be pushing world firsts or committing to a hardcore guild, but 2-3h a day is more than enough for a casual player. If you continue to play, you're guaranteed to hit 60 and will have no trouble getting into 5man groups. Find yourself a casual guild and you'll have no trouble getting into raids too. Some of the player base will be ahead of you, but far more players will be standing beside you - probably begging you to tank for them ;)
---
Good luck!

---
You have to have a pet in classic, it’s a bulk of your damage 
---
Oh shit I thought it was just thunder bluff way in the distance
---
I totally get this feeling, I never played pet classes but when I played warlock for a long time I kinda liked them. It makes alot of Things easier
---
Nah, opinions don't exist and only what I think is true. The rest is pure bs.
---
Only played Vanilla, Quit early on in TBC.
---
Merging would mean that one of the servers would cease to exist, and that there would be a forced realm transfer, with forced renaming would have to happen.
---
That a warrior so your both wrong. 
---
yeah I agree. 
---
Why? It’s the won’t true support class in the game and an extremely valuable one at that.  
---
Anyone looking too be spamming abilities every second will be disappointed no matter what class they pick in vanilla
---
reasons not to play paladin: nr 5739
---
why not mage?
---
Pay a couple bucks and tranfser down the road if your not happy on your server.
---
good idea
---
Im not sure I wanna deal with the day1 zerg anyway

Bis druid list.
---
Private servers are full of try hards though and Warrior is the ultimate tryhard class
---
Idk of anyone that has a problem with 1.12 AV? What’s wrong with it from someone that doesn’t like it?
---
How dense are you?
---
Probably more than most games, that sounds fair. There'll still probably be a lot of people that will play that aren't on reddit and I assume there are very few players that are on the reddit that won't play. It's an assumption but it's probably still skewed somewhat. 
---
Erm, probably not then
---
😔
---
Thank goodness because I thought I was having a stroke for a second. What you said is exactly why Blizzard hasn't done "merges" and instead do the Connected Realms thing that I've linked twice.
---
Troll rogues represent 
---
I can't understand why anyone rolling an alliance warrior to PvP wouldn't be a gnome. Escape Artist is so huge vs your nemesis.
---
This needs to be higher.
---
As much as I'd love to have t0.5 released around ZG, the loot from the summoned bosses is way too good to be on farm while AQ40 is out. Unless they simply add the gear to the loot tables with Naxx and release t0.5 questlines early.
---
So no harder and better TBC raids, no new talent points or abilities? Questing without levelling is pretty dire. I think this sounds really bad and a million times worse than BC for all it’s faults. 
---
I thought there were some decent low level aoe farming methods for them. They were gods at power leveling in Scarlet Monestary.
---
Yes. This.
---
people say that the players are more elitist now and then you see these stats lmao
---
Yea, there were still the elites, the archers, the GY guards, and a few small patrols. Before that, there were a LOT more non-elite guards. A ton, everywhere. That’s part of what made it feel like a massive war. You couldn’t really go anywhere in enemy territory alone without dying or being in a lot of danger. Especially when they were upgraded. Those upgrades really meant something because they affected so many NPCs. You can skirt around a lot of the NPCs in 1.12. No, you can’t solo the elites, but it’s incredibly different.
---
Honestly, if Blizzard thought they could do it in a way that made sense, I’d kill to have both 1.12 AV as well as the early, NPC filled version. Maybe post Syndicate/similar NPC removal, but pre-guard gutting. Give the people who just want to farm rep an avenue, and then have a fun, massive, perpetual war zone that people won’t be insanely upset if they never see the end to it.
---
Do the happy bear dance, and be a happy 60 druid. :V
---
61 % alliance vs 39 % horde in pve servers?
---
I'm going to be on PvP, but that sounds like a huge problem if that's how it turns out. 
---
Big raids will have several healers
---
Yeah. Playing an Alliance Warlock in PvP (especially as Demo) is so bad. Literally half the enemy is immune to your kit.
---
When people talk about classic and their plans you often hear them mention jazz like it’s a large factor just to make their character. 
---
I think a lot of people who make warriors are very motivated by the dreadnaught set even if they have zero desire to tank and don’t have the time investment to be that hardcore anyway
---
I’m going to be going for a 2h dps build with 5/5 Sword Spec and Death Wish as a Troll. It won’t be ideal dps but it’ll sure be interesting!
---
Seems about right 
---
What? Loads of people knew it would make gear irrelevant hence why so few people bothered to try Naxx 
---
The problem on private servers is that premades dodge each other to fsrm non premades only.
---
I am middle eastern so I can tell you, best served hot and almost always a surprise.
---
Azsuna? Where's that?
---
The wording in the patch notes is unfortunately a bit more dramatic than it deserves to be, but keep in mind the map was made a lot smaller over the course of these patches as well. This naturally has to be accompanied by reducing number of NPCs.
---
&gt;it still a trend towards base rush meta for rewards rather than actual PvP
---
Can't just look at it in a vacuum, the patches didn't just remove/nerf NPCs but actually also added bonus honor for defending towers/captains and improved the bonuses your team gets from turn-ins. In many ways this incentivized pvp, just not through a PvE proxy.
---
In truth, nobody has seen the earlier versions of AV in like 13 years and there's no way of telling how a modern playerbase will adapt and enjoy it. 
---
What we can do is look back on the times Blizzard changed AV during vanilla, and notice that they did so significantly almost every patch. They obviously didn't do that because it was _popular_.
---
Orc also has a racial that increases TPS, but the reduced healing the receive because of it definitely isn’t work it. Troll will definitely be the best tank.
---
I am not a healer, but a tank so I'm familiar enough with healing to give you a part answer. In a raid you will not be in charge of 40 people's health. You will have an assignment, and share the healing with 3 or 4 other people. Some healers get assigned to tanks. Some to the raid in general. Most fights the tanks take the brunt of damage, with the raid taking specific damage spikes or gradual overall damage. But either way, it gets broken down into tasks so you're not alone. I do believe it is still like playing wackamole but I wouldn't view it as being as daunting as you vs 39 healthbars.
---
Seek out the post in the subreddit regarding the AV 1.12 bluepost (fairly recent) and you will find many varying opinions within.
---
If they wore boots properly they would be fine
---
Just because blizzard uses non-inclusive terms doesn't mean everyone else should. 
---
Engineering is one of the cheapest to level if I understand correctly, so in theory you could go Herb/Engineering and sell the herbs and buy bars. 
---
Troll Rogues represent!
---
 [**soon™**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soon%E2%84%A2) 
---
The answer is yes, it should be released earlier.
---
Paladins support hunters a lot better than shamans do. Blessing of wisdom and Judgement of wisdom are so good for living the cheap ass raider life.
---
Also i think the idea that they are the only mail class on alli appeals to some people.
---
It was fun but if you messed up it was a 40 person wipe. Everyone knew too. I quit before tbc so the current state of the game is beyond me. Healing in one of those raids was good fun you didn't have much room for error during.
---
looks like someone wants an owl
---
Problem is you can't track 2 node based professions at once. Lots of people plan to go Gathering Profession/Skinning just to vendor the skins to get some gold while leveling and then drop it for a blacksmith/alch/engi profession. 
---
&gt;  The quest chain about going in the burrow is hell.
---
I did it a while ago on a stupid server with way too high respawn rates and god it was pain even with a full party. Multiple parties around there werent enough.
---
I like to get my bleeds up, slow them, and walk them down. Invuln potions are hilarious against warriors.
---
Tremor Totem is terrible, missing a tick can get your tank feared for almost 5 seconds. Your tanks have to stance dance for fears
---
You got downvoted but you're getting at an important statistical theorem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem
---
I signed it of course but please, go to the official forum, comment on the threads, and tweet at Ion.
---
**Central limit theorem**
---
In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in some situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a "bell curve") even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.  The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.
---
For example, suppose that a sample is obtained containing a large number of observations, each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the arithmetic mean of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the distribution of the average will be closely approximated by a normal distribution.

My first character was a troll rogue, guess that makes me a special snowflake
---
The thing I didn't like about the undead changes was leaning harder into "grumpy mean face".
---
Before the update my main (who used the more skeletal bony-browed face and leather straps) had a very neutral "I'm dead and don't feel strongly about much of anything" look, which is how I imagined him. Now he looks angry, which was a big character shift that I try to ignore. 
---
Free Action Potion is so disgustingly overpowered, lol.  - Salty Mage
---
&gt; If you're an offtank, gear isn't thrown your way
---
I don't know how much I agree with this.  I played on a private server with a very competent guild from MC through AQ.  I never tanked but I remember there were some pieces of gear that the tanks and DPS warriors would both want.  Every single time without debate the priority was MT -&gt; OT -&gt; DPS warriors / backup tanks.  One such example was the Head of Nefarion for the quest [The Lord of Blackrock](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7782).  
---
Our MT and OT were pretty chill dudes so I remember frequently the OT could ask if he could tank a boss that he normally didn't just for the fun of it and they would swap frequently.  Since I was a warlock I don't remember their assignments that well but I do remember they both needed a full set of tank gear and the OT always showed up in protection talents.  In addition to the two tanks, we had multiple DPS warriors we would funnel tanking gear to after the MT/OT had their items.  There were a couple fights were a DPS warrior would need to throw on some tanking gear to pick up adds and what not.  And obviously you needed 8 tanks for the four horsemen but that is a single fight a long ways into vanilla.
---
Already did, except for the tweeting part. Will do that soon!
---
40 health bars on your screen taking up 50% of the visible screen. Looking at nothing else really. I hated raiding as a priest.
---
You'll have to do a lot of farming and bring every possible consumable to raid each week.  So be prepared to grind a lot so you are suited up for each raid.  But you are compensated pretty well.  MT/OT are #1/#2 priority for gear without question.  Usually  you get help on some gear such as the guild bank providing mats / gold to help pay for an piece.  You'll also most likely get a Thunderfury for your trouble if you work hard enough :P.
---
I did raid as a rogue (admittedly on a private server) and never experienced this. Maybe it's because I was part of the guild lead and we just worked with DKP
---
Dark Glare hits for 50k every 45 seconds, sure. But he tosses out a 3k eye beam that gets multiplied in damage for each bounce. Here's the scale for up to 10 mobs.
---
3k
---
6k
---
12k
---
24k
---
48k
---
96k
---
192k
---
384k
---
768k
---
1,536k (1,5 mil)
---
So his zombies can hurt him real bad.
---
For tanks, yes, but for the rest of the raid there is no other option.
---
IMO the word cartoon is attached to exaggeration of movements and expressions. Unrealistic could also mean many other things.
---
But it's true that finding words to describe these things is difficult.
---
I wasn’t talking about the dead guy. I was referring to the rogue you can’t see because op didn’t click the flag to send it back to base. So you’re wrong.
---
Yes, it is really that bad.
---
One question about AV. Since they started in the beginning that they were using 1.12 as a starting point, why did people expect any other patch for AV?
---
I'm confused, did I miss some news where they said they aren't only using 1.12?
---
I played a raiding priest though AQ and it's literally a whack-a-mole minigame. You spend most of your time staring at the health bars or raid frames, and then look up sometimes to make sure you're not standing in fire or something lol.
---
That said, it's actually a lot of fun. Very satisfying to get off that last second save, or gamble on a quick HOT keeping the rogue alive long enough for your greater heal on the tank to hit.
---
And you always, always have a group or raid spot, and people are almost always nice to you.
---
I care about end game raiding. Rogues are high dps. 
---
no, I think he means literally wearing children on you instead of platemail....maybe even over the platemail?
---
I’m rolling a Gnome Rogue as my Ally Class and a Troll Mage as my Horde.
---
Surprised to see no gnome mages
---
Damn, thanks for the realitycheck anyway haha :D
---
I laffed out loud at this.
---
Depends on your guild and what is required. I farmed a lot. I’d farm furlbogs in winterspring for firewater. My alt was an alchemist so I could farm potions on my own. Id sell a lot of pots as well for income. You need to have lots of poisons/flash powder. I think it evens out tbh. You spend the hold or farm it yourself. I’d say mist flasks in raids are provided by the guild so you don’t buy them anyways. You pay for them with attendance, performance, and guild donations.
---
What I meant was it gets better once you start raiding, but when you're doing 5/10 mans there always seems to be a warrior going for truestrike, cadavs, the rend swords, etc. plus they'll also be buying devilsaur gear which drives the price up.
---
I joined in sep 2007 during TBC. I am totally stoked for classic.  Live is a bore fest that I only endure for Classic. In fact I have more than a few friends who quit playing that are coming back just for it.
---
Not really, you need to be low health for berserking to be decent, orc is a better choice, especially with axe specialization. Not to mention stun resist.
---
I'll never tell you the odds
---
I recall a lot of people trying to be melee hunters because they had a pole arm. 
---
I know it was. I used to play a tank back in the day. It was always hard to find a tank back then though if I wanted to DPS or play an alt instead.
---
I only played vanilla. 
---
Paladins, sure, there were always plenty of those around. 
---
Druids? I used to get invites to random raids whilst standing around in Orgrimmar because I was the only 60 druid on. 
---
Orc lock was my original main, and so it shall be once again!
---
As a hunter you should never let a Priest or Lock get get close enough to cast a spell. If you get a jump of them it’s really in the favor of the hunter. Especially against Spriest viper sting and kite.
---
Figures but it's hard to grasp sarcasm through text sometimes.
---
Also, it's not erroneous, read please. Coin flipping and picking a faction are both normal distributions, I didn't said they're completely the same either, literal of use of "kind of" - similar.
---
This was the last boss my guild downed before pre-tbc patch and free HWL gear was everywhere. It was a fun mix of maxing dps and really keeping an eye on threat.
---
TBH I’m afraid of that kid
---
Oh, yeah that makes sense. And that is also what fits my experience.
---
If you are dedicated enough (and have enough time to put in every week) you’ll be fine
---
How about that. I never knew I was a minority. Troll Rogue. Hmm. 
---
I'll be playing a warrior, feel free to heal my ass any day ;) 
---
Yup, I also touched upon what CLT states in my other replies within this thread, but knee-jerk downvoting has been a thing for ages so I don't really give a shit lol.
---
There weren’t any interesting quests in Thousand Needles, IMO, but there was something about riding through it that was magic.  The Cata flooding was a creative idea, but simply destroyed that part of the world for me.  
---
Haven’t heard anyone talk about it yet, but a really well played/geared Druid in a true 1v1 can kite forever and restart the fight. And they fair pretty well against the most popular classes in pvp Mage/Rogue/Warrior.
---
For some of us the journey to 60 is meaningful progression. 
---
And they aren't alts if you don't have a main.
---
based
---
&gt; If you are dedicated enough (and have enough time to put in every week) you’ll be ~~fine~~ doing half the DPS of anyone else putting in less work.
---
FTFY. Sorry, Love paladins, but they don't got it.
---
I'm still not decided between the orc or undead rogue.
---
Yeah, i faintly remember the weird Goblin race track on the salt plains.
---
Get a fucking owl!
---
Yeah warriors better have a healer because won't last long otherwise
---
If the Pala can tank then I would go rogue or lock, since with a healer+tank all you need is DPS. 
---
the only people who watch that shit are underage kids and people who never played classic
---
Don’t worry, it’s Blizzard, they give out instant max level tokens with expansions :P
---
Yeah, the racetrack was a bother jaw-dropper the first time I saw it. 
---
It will probably be different on retail because most people wont be this sweaty, but a lot of the times I would attempt a gank like that on my hunter they would have a swiftness potion or engi boots ready to go. Now there are obvious solutions to this, but it wasn't usually as cut and dry as "this will be an easy fight".
---
While these numbers are "interesting" I don't think it tells quite the full picture, as I think hunters are getting super low numbers because they are being dedicated to "alts" instead of mains, but I've heard a lot of people swear their alt is going to be hunter or rogue, which could bump these numbers up. Also, I can't help but doubt the number of paladins and shamans...not to say that people won't try them, but more that people likely will fall out from those characters and likely move to something else as their main instead part way through (i.e. swap their alt to main?). And then theres the Warriors....I think people got in over their heads from the Beta that bethesda showed people late last year--the amount of health regen made it so that people could move from fight to fight a lot of the times, but if people start seeing the difference the real health regen will be, I think we've got even more dropouts from that as well.

Maleficent
---
Still pretty epic screenshot though , thanks for sharing
---
I once did the same thing on the old tbc feenix server but with 10 rogues. I can recommend it. I would do it again..
---
I was a female dwarf priest with a mechanostrider back in vanilla.
---
1 of a kind on the server
---
They announced Tbc on October 28th 2005 this was months before AQ got released. Vanilla launched November 2004 so about a year apart.
---
Human Warrior /facepalm
---
You have my, err, Frostbolt!

Wait what? Blizzard stated how they were going to handle it when they announced Classic. The only thing required to play will be a subscription to retail, that's it. Same $15 a month will get you access to retail and classic.
---
Did you not play at the time. Tons of people stopped raiding and cba with Naxx, especially when the consumable grind became known .
---
I’m pretty convinced I’m going to be shaman. And yet I had a dream last night I was a warlock. But I got ganked and had to wait out my dots to see if they killed the guy. They did, but it was close.. no thanks. 
---
Geneticisbad sure did a good job!
---
No, that's sharding and CRZ which is Blizzard's pathetic excuse for lowering server capacity and maintenance and to provide low population realms an "out" without giving away free transfers. 
---
This is exactly the kind of feedback I was looking for. Cheers!
---
I suppose the question becomes, given that the items that were given improved stats in 1.10 are going to be in from release, would it be ok to have the 0.5 extra bosses with their loot in the game?
---
I pointed it out another place but another major factor is that people are treating Rogue as an Alt class making them not fit in this list. The same thing is happening to Hunters, which is known for being the easiest class to level in the game....why wouldn't you main a class thats a bit harder to level the first go around, then come back for the easy run the second time around? To do it the other way around would make the harder class feel even harder knowing how easy it could be.
---
This is especially true with the amount of players that are underestimating the grind to 60. I would bet there are a lot of people responding to these polls thinking they'll ret to 60 and then gear up via pug raids/pvp and do well. The game just isn't like that.
---
I think the track is called Enchanted Forest on the official soundtrack.
---
It's my favourite too. I love questing in Ashenvale and listening to this.
---
Yes I had considered rogue until I found out sap breaks you out of stealth unless talented and even then it's not 100%. That made me go "ew no". I mained a rogue in TBC as well and they don't seem too awfully different, but compared to now I'd probably get bored of any DPS class in classic lol
---
I'm not really asking what class I should play. I know what they all offer from a mechanical standpoint. I'm more unsure of whether I want to use Classic as a way to experience vanilla differently by playing Horde and a class I haven't done much with over the years like warlock or warrior or use it to take a trip down memory lane and going something like mage, which I've played since Cata but didn't really play much in vanilla.
---
Every time i get to siphon life, i see CoEx and Shadow Mastery so close and i just go for it.  I already have 8 points in Demo at this point of course.
---
The main problem is that Reddit is pretty much the exactly wrong style of discussion forum for any sort of disagreement. 
---
If you disagree, you get downvoted and your comment gets hidden. 
---
Nobody has said this yet.
---
Repairs repairs repairs.
---
Just wearing plate into a raid will require time farming gold. If you're the tank and getting soulstoned or brezz the costs can almost immediately double. Being in plate in raids requires more the commitment than most other classes.
---
Congrats Alliance for so many of you planning on playing no-skill, face-roll hunters.
---
Yep it definitely was magic I remember getting up early one summer morning I think this was back in 2009 and I was leveling my Hunter just finished laughing my ass off to some Chuck Norris jokes and off to level in 1k needles and I was watching the sun come up for some reason that has always stuck with me as my favorite memories in wow.
---
Why is dwarf rogue last for alli??? Stoneform REMOVES BLIND and bleeds, its pretty much the closest rogues can get to cloak of shadows in vanilla wow.
---
Nice.
---
Why until today? 
---
What am I hearing?! Troll shooting animation is the coolest thing in the game!
---
Today I learned how to pronnounce "Nope!" in Bearspeak.
---
Nice
---
I'm going to randomly pick and tell my friends to roll on that server.
---
Ezpz.
---
Same feel-I actually was just a little kid watching my dad play TBC (he didn't join it early enough for vanilla) and eventually he let me join in as well, but I only saw the last few months of TBC and was moving into Wrath when I hit around 35-40, so I knew the feel of not having dungeon finder lol-going to be interesting doing dungeon runs (not just the dungeon itself)
---
If you wanna do ret, you gotta heal in raids for progression. Though, for farm content most guilds don't care if you go off specs. 
---
Also Classic has it even worse. You've got people who have played on incorrect private servers, people with incorrect memories, people who never played Vanilla, etc...
---
A ton of different groups arguing about over what is best before anybody has even touched the game. It's a shit show. 
---
More human warlocks than priests on alliance side? Wack. This chart is not a good indicator what live servers and specifically end game content will look like. 
---
you forgot the zandalar tribe
---
Its honestly the opposite. For pvp Orc hunter is a lot better than alliance hunters, which is weird that hunter would be less on horde versus alliance. The 25% stun resist and the 5% pet damage are big for orc hunters.
---
Reddit in a nutshell, really.
---
Why is Troll mage so low when it's BiS horde mage race? All those undead mage must make me cringe. Gonna be so many noobs on classic.
---
*Shit where is my frost res and grounding totem....*
---
in like a decade of wow Ive never seen guilds give flasks for free even if u were good
---
Human is God tier race for warrior
---
Lol never thought of that
---
Played a little vanilla at a friends house as a kid and avoiding a PS so I don’t spoil Classic for myself. Most of my WoW career is in TBC &amp; WoTLK.
---
Very concerned since I’m attached to playing Paladins and the only positive thing I see about vanilla paladins is that they’re the best PvP healer. That’s makes it seem like I am locking myself out of a huge portion of content by rolling pally. 
---
And yes, I understand we should play what is fun for us, but how much fun can I have in a massively multiplayer game if the masses don’t want to play with you?
---
Should be fine, especially as an off tank. Typically most guilds will have an established MT. Try to find a guild early on. Once servers are announced, I’m sure this sub will be filled with recruitment — I’ll certainly be looking for people to fill my guild.
---
mage then
---
complete the mage journey in vanilla
---
its quite different than cata
---
Whats funny is that my takeaway from leveling a warrior first on a fresh pserver was that I should have gone with a mage or hunt first to supply my warrior with much needed gold. Having perpetually up to date gear and maxed engineering makes leveling a warrior a lot more pleasant.
---
Never played vanilla, started retail in the end of WOTLK, but played BC in some privates.
---
1. Basic knowledge, I did look up some content yes.
---
2. Didn't get me offguard, but I just prefer the slower and more socially active type of MMO that vanilla seems to be.
---
3. Most negative thing is the atrocious balance between specs as I wanna play what people refer as "meme" spec and it'll negatively affect my ability to experience endgame. Positives are immersion, social aspect, difficulty and lore.
---
"yikes". I see how it was worded but my point remains the same, more nelf druids than ud mages or rogues is very far from reality.
---
Honestly if i cant get main tank i will very gladly take off tank and be just as happy i have been seeing alot of posts to not worry as most warriors will go dps
---
That's what I'm hoping will happen.
---
I'd rather pick a server where I know the people rolling on it are vanilla enthusiasts, and not just retail tourists who'll all quit before they get a lvl40 mount.
---
It’s not free if you are contributing to the guild.
---
I agree with you. These numbers are not really representative of all the people that will be playing classic. Although I could imagine that there will really be a lot of warriors.
---
lolret
---
Lol. 
---
That’s implied in a BG setting. You’d have support from your team.
---
Actually would like to know from OP if the distribution at 60 is similar
---
Yea, this. I’ll be paying close attention to this forum. Granted, we won’t be a large percentage of the population, but if we all go to a few servers, it’ll raise the floor a bit above random ones.
---
Well that's.... *graphic.*
---
Is there a reason there are no Night Elf Druids?
---
Honestly i have to much free time so grinding wont be an issue for me haha i am very much looking forward to classic wow and having a ton of pots and buffs up
---
The reason I would personally roll human is the 10% less rep grind.
---
1 week? I hope its more like a month or two even...while that will cause hype to jump a bit early, I think the extra time to set up guild groups prior to launch would be beneficial.
---
I think it makes sense, tbh. It's a talent designed to help priests solo efficiently.
---
How I wish makes had an equivalent talent in tier 1 Arcane tree. Stacking spirit is already pretty good for efficiency, but drinking all the time is so bleh.
---
Even with regular respawns, it's painfully awful at the appropriate level. Imo, there are about 3 times too many mobs in the area.
---
&gt;  troop upgrades, elemental lords, etc. are still available.
---
&gt; but spreading misinformation like this
---
Ironic, considering retail has those.
---
Why the release thing?
---
That's reasonable. Rep is huge. 
---
I'm so used to playing Horde that I was genuinely confused for a couple seconds.
---
"Well, pick it up and cap!"
---
I guess it all depends on what you mean by "somewhat decent raiding guild." To me, this seems like a pretty low bar, and I think you probably could get into a guild like this. That said, you'll very likely be limited to the bottom raiding guilds of the range.
---
If you want to try to raid with it, you must go human because the weapon skill will make a big difference in your total dps output.
---
You also should be prepared to go hard on consumables, which can be very expensive.
---
Stay tuned.
---
All classes are super useful for different things so don't stress this at all. And if you roll a meme spec you can just redo your talents so this doesn't matter much. Just figure out which class you want to play.
---
That, and already work my way towards Exalted with Darnassus.
---
I still refuse to believe that there's gonna be that many warriors at level 60 on classic servers. Private server players are gonna be the minority.
---
Expect when you reach the raiding stage of the game, and find that tanks are in very low need and most respec DPS
---
It's really not that bad when you get used to it. Hunter levelling goes from painful to laughable once you get a pet. You can run around using a single button for combat and level easy as hell if you keep your ranged weapon updated.
---
Hunter's Mark
---
Autoshot
---
PetAttack
---
Then you just wait 10-20 seconds for the mob to die and move on.
---
Plus 1 for this. I have the same "problem". I can only imagine what will happen here one month or less before the offical release.
---
Great list, just from a quick perusal I can add a few items to the resist gear listings. Elemental Mage Staff is great for fire (+20) and frost (+20) resists. Glowing Brightwood is +15 nature resist. Fangdrip Runners are +20 NR boots from Strat.
---
if youre with someone you truly love, never put them at 2nd place in general
---
It's 5% of base int as a heads up.
---
I'm a different person than the guy you were originally arguing with, but if you had an iq higher than your age you would know this.
---
&gt; I did rank 11 on Nostalrius just afking the whole day for 2 months becouse of premades.
---
Interesting. I think you touch on what /u/KarneEspada said with premades dodging queues ? Sounds like something that should be fixed. 
---
How much worse is just doing world pvp ? If it becomes that much of a problem, couldn't you just tell people to start their own battleground in a random zone outside ? 
---
Hunter is strong and the most people will never see naxx. so no one cares about dps.
---
Yeah, the more time the better.  Just trying to manage my own expectations a bit.
---
Thats the plan at least.
---
Logically you would think it must. They can't have a quest in the game that can't be completed.
---
Things that will not be used still in, but they will all be ignored mark my words.
---
Same. Whenever I feel depressed I just turn the game on. I am just casually on retail waiting on classic. Don´t want to burn my self out from leveling on pservers. I want the real deal.
---
The rest of the raid don't get fear warded so I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make
---
Pally it will be for me, so SFK is kinda out of question^^
---
I completly forgot about BFD though ... is it worth to go there? Its quite far away and I remember the quests to be shattered in ashenvale ...
---
Right? I've rolled a Trogue since 1.5 and was starting to question myself in this lead up to classic (thinking Orc Rogue might be a better, despite looking like a sneaky linebacker).
---
This chart has solidified my decision to keep it classic in classic. 
---
I remember playing until 2-3 in the morning through the last couple years of (home)school. My brother was in the Navy and I would stay up late to play with him, he was stationed in Guam. My mom would get up and use the restroom in the night and see a light on and I would tab out and hide in the closet (family computer was downstairs) hoping she would think someone just left the computer on, haha. This was right around when rhcp ‘Stadium Arcadium’ came out, and even now I think of questing in Tanaris when I hear any song from that album. 
---
Never really had rituals, mainly just playing till my eyes burned. Definitely miss the questing and raiding, used to OT for our guild. They progressed partly into Naxx, but I only ever tanked up to BWL. I think I had a twink in every bracket, but 49 warrior was my personal favorite. Good times. 
---
Plus no monks, demon hunters or death knights
---
something'sfucky.jpeg
---
Best place to read about lore from the very start? 
---
I am very cynical and stuck on my beliefs kind a guy irl so stuff like this (none that really don't matter) cross my mind very often and I usually have strong opinions on such things. That being said, I just find this hilarious. The only time I got why people played humans was the time when human racial was basically a free PvP trinket.
---
I read every single thread that gets posted here.  I can't stay away.
---
Clarifying question here:  On what basis are we voting?
---
* Is this a popularity contest?  
---
* Is this who would win a fight lore-wise?  
---
* Is this who would win a fight mechanics-wise?
---
There’s just no reason to bring a Ret Paladin to your raid unless you find a guild with 8+ holy priests who need to fit in more pallies for the blessings.
---
How I cosplayed as my toon on a low budget
---
It's true there are arguments to be made that they're the worst rogue race. They have the highest base agi of any horde iirc (second to Gnome, NE), and berserk is not great relative to hardiness or WotF.  I'm really not sure about "objectively pretty bad" though. Racials make a pretty insignificant - though present - difference all things considered.
---
So you might be right, but as a Troll rogue - I don't care.
---
I honestly can't wait, more people means more ancient screenshots, memorabilia, nostalgia, and hype. 
---
Truest comment ITT
---
He means he kept it all this time up until today. Most likely will still have tomorrow.
---
Mercy! Please! Nooooo.....
---
Link seems not to work :(
---
"Holy man"? Perfect!  
---
You will be our healer.
---
Let’s not get too rigid, so maybe a combination of mechanics and lore. Whichever makes the most sense for you 
---
If no names will be published in advance, so no coordination can happen whatsoever, then I'll just choose one by its name. 
---
Thanks for your effort. What's the data look like from a horde / alliance ratio for pvp?
---
I have the same problem. There aren’t enough threads.
---
You mean druid??? Holy fuck thats alot of people who lied about what their rolling. Druid is always towards the bottom of all the servers ive played on. Til so many people have no ideawhat classic is going to guve them
---
I made a post seperate post with the data: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4zeur/class_breakdown_classic_wow_according_to_large/
---
I prefer aoe grinding with a mage. I also prefer my tanks to hold agro using taunts not into 4 dps 1 healer dungeons so much
---
"How it looks" 
---
"what it looks like"
---
pick one. none of this mix and match.
---
I *hope* the general populace will be more drawn to hunters. I think a lot of people here know the QoL and end-game scaling of warlock exceeds Hunter. Back in Vanilla no one knew shit about scaling and just played what they wanted.
---
Just play a rogue then. Sorry you can't "Fear" away someone who is 20 levels higher than you.   
---
Your whole contention that this is what lead to no PvP servers is just ridiculous man.
---
Dude!! Is this Shattered Hand!?!?
---
Also, that's a shaman.
---
I didn't play Vanilla, I started toward the end of TBC and I'm looking forward to playing classic when it hits. 
---
I wonder when they changed the color scheme for Shaman? I started Mar 2006 and rolled my Shaman that became my main around May 2006.  I always remember the blue raid color.  Maybe I missed the change?
---
sweet thanks 
---
I wanted to be one SO bad after playing through WC3, but holy fuck was it boring. Couldn't make it past...25? I know I got Verigan's Fist but didn't get to 30. 
---
Yeah. Lost all of my old screenshots. But I found a printed one a few weeks ago and hold it dear since then.
---
I am not saying that it makes a huge difference, but it does make one ... especially on reddit, where people look at these things. And most people who play rogue on horde probably want to do PvP, which both Orc and Undead have great racials for. Additionally Orc has a decent PvE racial.
---
As for Alliance: human has the best PvE racial of all classes (sword spec), dwarf as a pretty dope PvP racial and gnome is decent for PvP too.
---
God I hope so :') 
---
&gt; Everything will be alright once the game is released. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHHHHHHHH
---
When classic comes out, this sub will devolve into a cesspool of people who are very angry about *issue of the week*. The game isn't out yet, so we're very much in the "hype" phase.
---
I'm almost certainly unsubbing when the game launches.
---
As will the majority of the sub, as most of us are only here for the hype to begin with 
---
Why troll rogue that bad?
---
I hope Jimmy likes being the replacement brood mother for the Black Dragonflight.
---
My boy Mor'ladim got this one in the bag. What is a "harvester" to the GOD OF DEATH. He would agrro you halfway across the map, to kill you. He is dead, his entire story revolves around death. Look at him, he's the god of death.
---
The bigger question for than if the guild will take you is do you want to play a spec that will be dead last out of 30 dps every fight? Guilds can clear vanilla with someone afk fine, but what's the point of raiding with a guild if you're not contributing to the group?
---
"Large survey"
---
"Ten thousand data points"
---
Pretty sure more people play WoW than that...
---
Its a shaman - they are wearing shaman warlord armour not warrior stuff which is red coloured. Dont let their misspelled name deceive you...
---
We had enough priests to get fear ward on pretty much all important people.
---
10min duration with 30sec CD and any raid worth their salt will have the full raid fear warded to start the fight. Hard core raids would typically have at least 3 Dwarf priests if not more.
---
Fear warding a whole raid would take a single priest 20 minutes which is not possible due to the 10 minute duration but they could easily do half a raid. With 3 Dwarf priests you'll have a full raid read with fear ward going in to any fight.
---
So, the example most will know is Magmadar, 30yard AoE fear every 30 seconds. If range and healers stay max range and rotate properly they won't need a refresh and they get a single freebie. Tank gets the fear ward primary as a backup for stance dance (or just to ignore it). Realistically the tank shouldn't need a refresh though as there's nothing in the way of dancing it other than losing focus. Then you can rotate it on to the necessary melee for refreshes. Refreshes being able to hit most of the melee on this fight is a huge deal for DPS getting the boss down faster (and reducing the number of fears you experience). Whether you have to run out and back in OR get feared for 8 seconds that's a lot of time off DPS. With enough priests you can easily give most (or even all) of your rogues no need to leave melee unless someone else more important screwed up their rotation.
---
So you help the old lady across the street; just to run her over after? 
---
Traditionally yes, Warrior + Healer is a very powerful duo.  If you really wanted to focus on PvP, having the Paladin Heal and letting the Priest go Shadow could be pretty dirty.  As a Warrior you'd fit right in, and you guys would have a breeze leveling.
---
They are good at PVP ONLY after they get sulfuras, ashkhandi, or dark edge
---
Tauren hunter?
---
^this 100 for pvp. And for pve it's troll due to troll berserking and the +5 to bows. This allows you to hit cap at only 6% with the bow from scholo. Considering the next ranged upgrade is then Rhok, you can sit at 6% hit capped until the end of BWL. This gives you an edge earlier on when trying to get and maintain a raid spot.
---
I guess all I'll have when I roll a troll rogue on launch is my trollish good looks :)
---
Awesome. So attack speed zg bat/ broken tooth Yes. Shadow damage Lupos most likely No. 
---
Can't they just add both? Both versions were available during Vanilla. Could they just have tou talk to an NPC for the original AV?
---
I am the same.  I find news spreads crazy fast here and I'm looking for a release date soon.  It's got to be soon right?
---
Is the old PvP grind to grand master / high warlord planned to be the same as it was in vanilla?   I remember it taking an absurd amount of time.
---
It sounds to me like you *want* to play an Alliance Warrior.  So I'd start there and see where things take you.  Classic isn't going anywhere this time around, so unless you're trying to push server firsts and such you will have all the time in the world to decide and re-roll if needed!
---
And on that day jimmy and Anduin became BEST FRIENDS!
---
Weren't the old models updated before BWL was released.
---
&gt;Posted
---
Once they get that epic bow tho..
---
Yeah I think this horizontal expansion idea is interesting to think about but in reality it wouldn't have worked at all.  The reason WoW became so successful was because even Vanilla was, at the time, by far the most user friendly MMO on the market.  No losing a bunch of XP or items when you die, lots of quests with relatively little grinding compared to other contemporary MMO's, etc.  It was successful precisely because it was playable by people other than the super hardcore.  A horizontal expansion of this sort would probably turn off a lot of those more "casual" players, so you'd be left with a much smaller (and less profitable) pool of hardcore players who never leave but also don't allow Blizzard to rake in huge buckets of cash due to their limited numbers.
---
Blizzard took the path that would appear to most of their playerbase, and while they made some mistakes along the way, from a business perspective it was the only possible choice.
---
That would go down as the greatest plays of all time if the shaman did that.
---
I rolled a tauren hunter first go round and I'll do the same in classic- warstomp is my favorite racial by far!
---
It doesn’t help that the updates have been ramping up over the past month. I think we’ll be seeing more info on the report system, the PvP implementation, the extent and ideas blizzard has for sharding, and also a short beta. Not to mention, we’re about 3 months away from a release, so we should get a (July 16) release date pretty soon. 
---
i out right know that i am not going dwarf, i dont care if im the last picked to every raid ever, im keeping my loyalty to the goddess elune.
---
I thought you were the OP when I read the first sentance 
---
My ideal AV is 6.2 Hydra premade AV where the horde corpse camps the alliance in their tunnel until they win by reinforcements.
---
*lights dim*
---
*heavy metal music begins*
---
*out walks Hogger*
---
Yeah it even has started affecting my work ...
---
Classic WOW is like crack, I thought I got clean 13 years ago, but once a junkie always a junkie !
---
Glad I could help :)
---
Anyway, I personally don't think that good loot from those bosses is a huge deal. This off-hand is probably the only drop with a higher than usual power level, but even that isn't necessarily very un-vanilla. Even before the item stat changes that happened across numerous patches, there were dungeon drops that were more powerful in PvE than the best available raid drops.
---
While I wouldn't mind T0.5 on release, I think there's reasons for why Blizzard most likely won't do it that aren't directly tied to gameplay balancing. From what we know so far, it seems that Blizzard is only changing things from how they were in Vanilla for the sake of meta-gameplay convenience. For instance, there are no progressive itemization changes on the table because they're confusing, somewhat arbitrary and promote a playstyle of hoarding bad gear because it will become good later down the line. Another example are changes to mailboxes and certain chat functions - Blizzard won't be removing features that could've been achieved with addons even back in Vanilla. On the other hand, they don't appear to be introducing changes for the sake of improving actual gameplay.
---
In my opinion, moving the release schedule of T0.5 doesn't seem to fit Blizzard's current design philosophy when it comes to Classic.
---
I got Sulfuric winning the first.  I mean the whole tiny insect line, plus he obviously whooped ass, as he came back to drop mounts!
---
AV sucks. Every version of it.
---
I'm just happy I'll be able to get exalted more quickly then never look back.
---
That was only a sample of 550 people.
---
This is 10k
---
10/10, shaman shoulders but with Paladin banana flavor.
---
humans dont \*Suck\* sub optimal MAYBE, but things like their spirit racial actually make them a pretty nice option, Now if you want to say night elves suck, I wont deny that despite being a really cool race.
---
Don't forget this is a survey, so it isn't representative of an actual server population. On a survey people will most likely just name their "main" character, but many will have a Hunter or Mage alt to farm quickly. I'am not surprised that few people are actually maining this class at this point. Hunters are have more involved PvE rotations and only a few raid spots in comparison to other classes, while in PvP they are difficult to play well.
---
Druid being so low is weird to me though. They are a challenging class, but that should even out. They are incredibly useful for 5mans as they can fill all three roles, play a druid and you get asked every day to join a dungeon. The only reason I could think of them being so unpopular is ironically that their two most viable roles for both PvE and PvP are tanking and healing, which is for some reason underappreciated by a lot of players.
---
Enhancement Shaman got a bigger chance of getting a raidspot but only if they bring along a nightfall and they have imp wf totem but even then, it's better to just have an extra rogue or warrior in most cases. Retri just doesn't make the cut, sad as it is. 
---
&gt; The one issue I had as a newbie was the hostility of the players (hopefully not the case in Classic).
---
I played WoW religiously from launch until shortly after Cataclysm released...  Then off and on since...
---
The one thing that struck me when I went back to Nostalrius was the sense of community that I had forgotten.  Just the basic things like random people buffing you when you pass them on the road, or people tossing you a desperately needed heal when you've accidentally pulled too many mobs...
---
Then you make friends with people who are leveling along side you, and join up to get some quests done.
---
I'm still friends online with people I played with back then, even though we don't play WoW together anymore.
---
It was a completely different experience than today's game.
---
It's like TV: minorities are overrepresented.
---
I'm taking one week off. Hopefully that'll be enough for me to hit 60
---
Pallies can be awesome PvE healers, as well, and we always had some in our raids.
---
Haha, enjoy!  :)
---
The fun thing is that I think Blizzard removed melee talents from Survival because they worried too many people would play melee hunters and there would be too much crunch on melee items. The survival talent trees that are on p-servers and in Classic have only a couple talents that increase melee ability damage. 
---
I would have thought this choice of patch for AV would be in reasonable symbiosis with your playstyle. Form a premade of likeminded souls, get on comms, turtle down and 9 times out of ten you'll be facing a group of randos you can keep fighting until you have to go to bed. 
---
Can confirm, I've seen your name almost too often :c
---
I think hostility should be down at least a little in Classic. For one, only fans of the game willing to pay a sub will be playing with you, so that should weed out some people. Also, population caps should be smaller, so people will be more willing to be friendly, since they’re less anonymous. 
---
I definitely worry that I’ll land on a super elitist server that ostracizes it’s token noobs.
---
You do know how statistics work, right? And in statistics, 10k is a large amount. As long as the data is not biased it is representative. And that would actually be a correct critique of the data, because I believe it is biased, since it is on reddit and all ...
---
Probably won't be main tank but I can see you being an alt if the guild isn't on the hardcore side
---
I mean, how malleable are pservers? can you start a private one, warp to hijal and spawn each for science.
---
It's been so long I don't recall, but freaking probably.
---
&gt; druids aren't viable in PVE.
---
Druids are ABSOLUTELY viable as healers and even tanks in PvE.
---
You'll mostly get pigeonholed as a healer, but one of our main tanks in Molten Core was a druid.  Admittedly, he had to work very hard to get where he was, and convince raid leaders to let him tank Ragnaros, but he did it.
---
The game was much more slowed down, and gear acquisition took a lot longer as well. You were not pushed hitting level cap asap and jumping straight into raiding. Getting gear from professions and from dungeons felt meaningful and rewarding. So while raiding was the only area you could get the best gear in the game, the other areas still felt compelling to do due to the overall pace of progression. 
---
imagining how you look like at your keyboard typing this
---
It doesn’t have new models as far as anyone knows, so calling it “new graphics” is kind of misleading. It’s just increased draw distance, foliage density, different water effects, etc. so even the “updated” settings look very very similar to vanilla except for the water, but that can apparently be toggled.
---
im playing on a private tbc server and the worst thing ive seen is that its too easy to make gold, i got to 70 with 4~4,5k gold on my bag only by doing quests, that means you can just sit on shatt all day without doing nothing because you already have all ur gems, enchants, consums and shit to raidlog
---
Nah they're all just condensed into 1 race per faction, so their bar is inflated.
---
Here’s the truth: in vanilla, in a mid tier raiding guild who managed to kill stuff at mid to late level, you probabaly had a whole third of  the raid not pulling their weight, objectively speaking. 
---
The dps were below their class average, healing output was probably the same for many healers. These guilds did just fine, and that was probably their goal as well. 
---
Would it kill them to bring an off spec dps? Of course not, and to be fair, a ref paladin who brings consumables and knows his rotation probably does more than the average auto attacking hunter anyway. 
---
If you wanna play off spec, you at a bare minimum need to convince people you know your stuff, and you also need to realize that your perfect dps is probably at best the average or below average of a regular dps class. On all accounts you’d be better of committing to healing and rolling on dps/pvp plate warriors don’t need (which there are actually a lot of, good example is how truestrike shoulders last a warrior up until T2.5)
---
I don't think you understand what I meant. Hunters do well enough during t1, but they don't really get much better for higher content. At least not enough to keep up with how much the other classes improve in damage. Iirc hunters are pretty much the lowest dps in Naxx.
---
Hunter is braindead easy while leveling, but pet control makes or breaks hunters in dungeons and raids. Especially raids.
---
If you don't control your pet right, it either dies (huge dps loss) or it pulls extra packs (wipes the group/raid more often than not). The latter can be avoided by dismissing it when you think the pet AI might have weird pathing, but the former is your main issue.
---
While levelling, your pet is practically half of your damage. If you let it die, you're screwed because you just lost half your damage *and* your personal tank for mobs. A dead pet means you're going to have a lot of trouble just staying in ranged to shoot at things, since you can't shoot at mobs that are 8 yards or closer to you. That being said, it's not really an issue unless you try to make it tank an elite, make it pull a bunch of mobs and/or while it's low health. As long as you follow common sense, it's a non-issue while leveling (outside of asspulls).
---
While raiding, you want to use pets since they're 25% of your DPS early on and still 5-10% during Naxxramas. That's where you need to micromanage the shit out of them, since raids are aoefests. You mainly need to watch out for mobs that cleave/stomp and keep your pet out of the Rain of Fires. Even if the pet dies, it's not too big of a deal because you can just resurrect them and send them right back in the next fight.
---
If you don't want to care/micromanage for a pet in raids, just grab a wolf and macro its Furious Howl ability to your Multi-Shot. It's not as much damage as a regular pet, but you'll at least get a small dps increase without risking it dying from cleave/aoe around the boss. There's also some fights with too much raid damage (or too strict positional requirements for the raid) where you won't even use your pet as well.
---
Hunters have one of the best rotations in the game and are tons of fun. You should give it a try at the very least. Worst case scenario, do a few low level dungeons as a hunter and see if the pet is too big of a pain to handle, though be aware that it's nowhere near as demanding as micromanaging pets in raids.
---
Based on my times - Live would have been up for 2 hours and there will be those who are already training tailoring/ench. I've done multiple fresh runs in the pservers to witness this. At the very atleast, all it takes for me is 66 cloths to make my own wand and If I get lucky with greens, I will need less cloths. In the event I can't get one at level 7, I will have picked up skinning and make sure I will have 100 leathers + greens rdy to trade for a greater wand at level 12 - 4 hours in. 
---
We should have a Reddit server 
---
I haven’t had much trouble with that. If it’s a piece I really need, I’ll find a different group that will let me roll, but most of the time people let me roll for other specs as a healer, if I ask about a specific item. People are normally nice about it, so I guess I’ve just been lucky as far as drama goes.
---
Probably a dumb question with no official answer, but will there be a separate channel ("category") on Twitch for WoW Classic when it launches? The precedent is there with separate bins for RuneScape and OSRS. Is this up to Blizzard to ask for, or can the community request that the game get its own category?
---
Hi, /u/tdotfella
---
Idk Starshards seems okay. I think its damage to cost ratio is one of the best Priest spells. Perception is okay in PvP though and that’s what I’m looking to do as Shadow
---
Still, finding a Tank for a dungeon is still more difficult than finding a DPS or even healer. More than half of the Warriors are either unwilling or inexperienced or both. Warriors who play the class well and complete are in high demand.
---
Many Warriors will also spend way too much time and effort to gear up while leveling which slows them down significantly and possibly even burns them out.
---
Same goes for Shamans by the way. Many don't play the class to its full potential and look for exclusively for DPS spots in Dungeons.
---
For Druids it is different because more often than not people are drawn to the class because of its flexibility. I think I only met one single Druid who only wanted to DPS in a *leveling* dungeon, which was almost unbelieveable.
---
Maybe, just maybe there are people who enjoy pvp more than you out there.
---
~~shadowmeld mindcontrol~~ i leveled a pve ne priest in vanilla and i personally love starshards with a passion. Cant deny its shit for raiding as holy tho. 
---
That's funny that the finishing line is what it is and that just a month later classic servers were announced. Nice timing. 
---
I'm surprised to see Undead warriors so low on the list.. looks like I know what I'll be rolling ^_^
---
Have fun raid healing in cloth, lol :P
---
tanking in a dungeon in vanilla? lol, kind of unheard of, tbh.
---
Just playing devil's advocate here but there are countless ways to implement horizontal progression that includes a sense of progression. Games like Guild Wars 2 have pretty succesfully done such progression. Instead of only having one increasing variable that improves your character (levels), you have mastery levels, which basically improve your character in the new area. You can implement new talents and abilities this way too.
---
Activating Berserking at low health is not difficult, as a tank you should be aware of your life at all times no? Even at full hp the 10% attack speed is a great TPS boost. Thunderfury is not an axe. Trolls can use all weapons and not feel guilty for choosing a sword over an axe. Bloodfury reduces healing by 50%. I'm not sure if stun resist matters in PvE very much someone should correct me on that. 
---
I've done multiple fresh the past couple of years and have been ahead of the curve in a un-optimized route. This is not my first rodeo. 
---
It will be very hard to get to 10 in 2 hours. Even with sharding, your sharding will still have a lot of players competing for tags. Waiting for items to spawn and trying to outclick 10-60 players or waiting for named mob to spawn and drop loot once per group and not per player. 
---
The ones who will be ahead are hunters/mages, few organized 5-mans before going solo and those like me, with an established route and players who are gonna put in 18+ hours with 4-6 hour downtime.
---
That's hilarious
---
thank you for the answers :) guess I'll keep it after all!
---
good to know, thanks!
---
makes sense, thanks!
---
If you're surprised by the amount of paladins/shamans, then you never played vanilla.
---
I was a super ultra casual in vanilla (complete shit at the game) so I guess that kind of applies. I really only did a few endgame dungeons at 60, never did any raiding until TBC. 
---
I'm really looking forward to it now that- A: we have infinitely more information readily available to us now, B: I'm not playing on an ancient old computer at 10 fps, C: I know *significantly* more about the game, how to play it, its lore, basic playstyle things (UI, keybinds, addons, etc.) 
---
cheers for the input!
---
I'm the exact frame of mind. Hell, I have very fond memories of doing random ass things in groups. Like 3 hunters doing sfk, or 5 rets doing deadmines, and later 5 Pallys in Scholo. One was prot and another was holy that time though. For me, classic wow has always been about the journey.
---
The gear available at that rank is on par with MC/BWL.
---
It should take that comparable time investments, probably more to hit those ranks when compared to traditional raiding.
---
A lot of people seem to want anachronistic changes as long as they preserve the "feel" of vanilla. Rather than a permanent (but faithful) snapshot of 1.12, they want a sort of compromise which incorporates as much of the memorable parts of vanilla of possible, even if those things occurred pre-1.12.
---
Personally I disagree, but that's the argument for it.
---
Yeah that guy doesn't know anything buddy.
---
You're goddamn right it is.
---
As others have said, you can spec Ret all the way to 60. Just slap on a heal set or a tank set when needed.
---
Oh hey.
---
I'am actually surprised it isn't *more* Dwarfs.
---
Hunter has one of the highest skill ceilings in pvp though.
---
Notice how high the lock % is on horde? it's more than mages ! first time in history, also a class (hunter) being lower % wise than druids .
---
Who knows at this rate getting spots on horde for some classes that used to be deemed " easy to gear/guaranteed raid spot" might be getting a surprise.
---
yeah, I intent to take the week off. Also my sleeping habit will be to my benefit. I normally only sleep for 4-6 hours for the most part. So doing 18 hours is very easy for me to do and I may push myself to go longer.
---
That was a good episode my dude.
---
I won't be doing any dungeons. Quest and Grinding. Hoping to run into a solo mage and duo with them, make their aoe life easier and grind faster.
---
Honestly hadnt even thought about that!
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/community/classic-discussion
---
this is only plausible if you manage to tag all mobs, and do all the quests in the starting zone. Manage to out-click everyone for quest items and not have to wait for named mobs to spawn for a quest. 
---
This will not be the case on launch day.
---
ohhhhh! thanks
---
If that old lady is playing horde she can taste my bumper.
---
I was a Gnome Mage on that server named Visarax! Man, Vanilla instilled so many great memories that I can't wait for Classic :D 15ish years later and I still recognize names from that time... DnT was bonkers, and your pet name reminds me of a guild named Genetic... Enmity was another Horde guild on that server right? Were they the strongest guild on Horde side?
---
One of the few specs worse then ret paladin in raids is prot paladin.
---
I feel like the correct answer is that it totally depends on the guild you find on the server your on. If you find a casual guild of others with time restrictions and responsibilities (y'know like a good chunk of people on this sub) then I'd you could. As far as things like repair costs for wearing plate and such I feel like your fellow guildies would be willing to help you out since you are hypothetically the main tank and the community seems to be pretty helpful.
---
TLDR: There are many types of guilds and I'm sure there will be casual guilds who aren't trying to rush things and do 4 hour sessions that would be willing to have a Main Tank who is on the same page.
---
True, I guess it'd feel different for me if BC was only restricted to one zone but Outland was fairly big and I always felt there was a presence in every zone.
---
Yep- that isn't how the site was (hopefully) designed but it is how people treat it.  I wish folks were more accepting of opposing (or not even opposing, just not 'exactly the same') views but I guess I'm just pissing up a waterfall. 
---
To me, "authentic experience" means *nochanges*. Patch 1.12 would be anachronistic if it had pre-1.12 AV. I'd rather have a faithful snapshot of 1.12, than a combination frankenstein that tries to preserves the "feel" of the entire life cycle of vanilla, because that never actually existed.
---
I hope this doesn't come off as hostile, I can respect wanting all the most memorable parts of vanilla at once, I just don't think it would be "authentic".
---
I haven't been on the WoW forums in years, are they still horrible?
---
There’s a YouTube series with like 200 videos that is the lore in chronological order 
---
Are you on mobile or desktop?
---
they were updated with aq I think, i remember doing bwl with old judgement 
---
Initially my plan is to get atleast 40 cloths and 1-2 greens and will find an enchanter/tailor 2 hrs in for a trade. They can easily make more greens to disench thus more wands to sell. They get the better deal out of this.
---
For my Greater Wand - I pick up Skinning at level 7 and hearthing back to Coldridge Valley. All those dead boars, bears, wolves, Yeti will be un-skinned since those players have yet to run to IF to pick up skinning. I will hit 75 skinning pretty damn fast and have 100 leather in about 10-15 mins worth of my time. 
---
I will then trade in to an enchanter/LW 100 leather + whatever green I may have for a Greater Wand. That's a lot of skill up. All I need is an Ench/LW who has atleast 65 Enchanting to be able to skill up to 75 and make a Greater Wand. 
---
Same here, hype is too high!!!
---
10% is an extra attack every 10 attacks, it lasts 10 seconds so unless you have 1.0 attack speed weapon, youre not getting much extra tps out of it, bloodfury isnt for tanks, its for rogues and fury warriors warriors, and will be a very nice consistent boost to dps. Horde doesnt have great pve racials really. Theres a lot of data out there that goes over what each race can do and backs it up mathematically. Relying on the fact that youre going to get thunderfury is also adorable. Goodluck with that.
---
This feels contradictory to me. If groups can clear Vanilla with AFK raiders, then what’s the problem with having a few ret paladins? Low DPS is objectively better than zero DPS.
---
Lol sick, you got a link by any chance?
---
If you cannot match with a raiding schedule it is hard to play a tank. Especially as a main tank.
---
Luckily for you fury is not only strong DPS, but also a perfectly viable OT.
---
Honestly I've found myself visiting forums more often now (like the old days.) You post a dissenting opinion, it stays where you posted it and everybody sees it and discusses it. In fact the more controversial opinions naturally stay pinned to the top of the forum as long as there is active discussion. Circlejerks just die because you can only agree with eachother for so long before you run out of things to say. 
---
Reddit does pretty much what it is designed to do: be a popular internet/news aggregator. 
---
Human rogue is better if you want a mix of both.
---
I have no intention of doing DGN and if I managed to get ahead of the zerg, most of us won't be doing DGN as it is not a good xp/hr. It will be very hard for me to find a BFD group during launch. 
---
We have no idea how many players will be visible in your shard. I also am not doing all the quests, I am skipping A LOT of quests. If it requires me to kill a named mob - Skipped. To pick up a quest item (chest, box, etc) - SKIP, I am not going to try to outclick 10-40 players.
---
Only kill X mobs and quests that requires me to go to point A to point B. Now - If I see the potential to complete a named mob or click item - I will do them, I will have those quests just in case on me, if I don't have to compete for it. All that is extra XP unaccounted for. 
---
This isnt my first time doing a fresh run and been able to stay ahead of the curve during the past 5-6 refreshes these past few years. 
---
We should have a betting pool for what the next big outrage is
---
Troll Rogue is God-Tier and almost no one knows.
---
I always loved the concept of druids. Changing shape all the time? So badass to 8 year old me looking at the game for the first time, especially compared to the hunter that my mom originally rolled for me on her account. I still love druids to this day. 
---
I discovered SoBe drinks at the same time! Definitely going to grab one for my first day of gaming. 
---
A good friend got me into WoW and we did a lot of 48 hour binges at his place, so any time I smell something that reminds me of that apartment, I always think of WoW. I told him at one point in the last decade that his apartment smelled like WoW to me and he thought the same thing. 
---
Damn, now I'm going to have to call him and try to force him to try Classic with me. 
---
for me honestly. it's the way Trolls move. Soooo lame. They look like space monkeys
---
Human is big dick race confirmed
---
Yes if you manage your expectations. For most of vanilla you'll be 5man and 20man (catchup raids) tanking some Ony/MC maybe BWL after a while. You have to think long term. Instead of grinding T1 raids right of the bat look for a chill casual guild that has a relaxed schedule and maybe fills spots with PUGs etc. Ony is easily done, but MC is a long raid for casual play. Then DM comes out where you and your guildies will find a lot of good gear that catches you up, then ZG and so on. AQ40 and Naxx are hard raids that require everyone to prepare and gear up very well.
---
Don't plan/expect to go deeper than BWL/ZG level basically and find a guild that fits your style.
---
Honestly, I try not to do what you are doing. The more I check here, the longer time feels to go, and the more I crave classic wow. If I don’t think about it, life goes a little bit faster and we get closer to classic release.
---
It doesn’t help that retail WoW is boring as hell now. At least they had a free weekend, so I could come play for a few days and get bored for free, instead of buying a month and quitting again after 3 days.
---
You need your pet for lvling, without a pet it will be nearly impossible to kill mobs without planning a kite route beforehand. 
---
The pet will require a lot of maintenance for the first hours, but when you're best friends you only really feed it after it dies. But if you dislike having to maintain your pet you'll also dislike having to buy arrows all the time.
---
For dungeons you need the pet as it does do a good amount of dmg, but it can also pull so if you don't know the game (which it seems like) you're better off not using it in dungs. 
---
In raids it will dies I pretty fast as healers won't heal it and you won't either as your ranged range is 40 yards which you aim to stay at and your mend pet range it 20 yards (30 with 3 t1 set) and it's a huge dps loss. 
---
But if you dislike having a pet (which is fucking weird to tbh) you should not play a hunter because you won't reach lvl 60 without it and no one will lol I with you outside of dungs if you don't have a pet. Rets and balance druids will look down on you if you don't have a pet.
---
The meme specs are not terribly important unless you plan on end-game raiding. Druids, Paladins, and Shamans are expected to heal in raids most of the time as their other specs are low dps or sub-par tanks. Some have huge mana efficiency issues that make raiding difficult to maintain decent DPS.
---
Some of these specs are okay or even good in PvP and 5-man dungeons. Don't worry about it too much unless you are super into competitive hardcore raiding. Play what you like and try different specs out to see what play style you like most.
---
Wait a sec, pallys dps?!
---
Oh oh...
---
The majority of players who will be committed enough to hit 60 are on these forums anyway, the charts will change with the influx of non forum players but the odds of getting a large amount of people "trying classic" and giving up is high , so it will end up not affecting these charts much.
---
The complaint is that 1.12 AV has NPCs that are significantly weaker than previous iterations, which makes it easier to get one big push &amp; win in hours, rather than the 1.5 or 1.8 iterations that lasted for days. I personally prefer 1.12 AV, but to each their own
---
One of my favorite WoW moments was when Blizz (can't remember the year) released patch notes for a new update as an April Fools joke that said Paladins now had to pay tithe to the church every time they got some gold.
---
Man, look at all those Fury Warriors @_@
---
Same, it's a shame they aren't really the best at anything, only managing to be below average at healing.

---
Yes, they are mutually exclusive. 
---
I would agree if it was any wow expansion, but I feel like vanilla racials can be such a strong factor in some aspects, mostly pvp.
---
But it's also fair to consider things such as WotF in a raid environment can be quite the beneficial racial on several bosses , especially when you don't have a shaman in the group.
---
Hello fellow fellow Utahn
---
I've never played paladin in vanilla, however gearing it should be no problem once your guild has gone onto the next tier of raiding and there are nobody else to gear. Like if you're on aq, then mc should be on farm.
---
DPS? Pallies do several damages per minute!
---
Same.  Luckily we are at the point it’s still manageable. At one point there might be too many posts 
---
Until all the warriors have gotten theirs, so probably a while (unless your guild have some other rules).
---
I mean, you’re gonna need a lot of warriors. If we assume all classes run dungeons for levelling/prebis a similar amount (probably not strictly true but let’s keep this simple) you’ll more or less need a warrior for every 4 or 5 players to facilitate that.
---
Count in how many warriors won’t be DPS specc or just can’t tank dungeons and yeah, even with 18% warriors you’ll have a tank shortage. I’d like that to be filled maybe by bears, but if you play on a PvP server there’s only 7-8% druids... and they’ll mostly be healing. Not the saving grace for 5 man tank shortages.
---
Raids won’t have a shortage though, but hopefully the warrior levelling culls enough of those who attempt it. It took me like 3 warriors on 3 servers before I could be bothered finishing levelling. I bowed out in the 38-48 range the first two times.
---
Yeah, the only person I still know from my early WoW days IRL plays ESO all day and thinks WoW was terrible.  He plays it on Xbox and he made me play it with him for a bit, but I was so bored out of my mind.  He tells me its just nostalgia, I argue with him all the time though.  I tell him there is no community in ESO, that their CAN'T be one in megaserver atmospheres.  
---
He tells me there is and we go round and round about it, but any MMO that uses sharding or megaservers just doesn't have that MMO feel.  Its just "what rando's will I group with today" and "time to play with my friend's list" with the world around you basically meaning nothing.  He thinks its better that way and I think he's whats wrong with modern MMO fans &gt;_&lt;
---
He won't touch Classic.  Makes me sad.
---
&gt; Funfact: There wasn't a single illegal race-class combination in the survey.
---
Holy shit... that means there's likely no liars and no automated bot responses / automated bot crawlers that hit this and it's legitimate data. That's insane.
---
I hope they announce it soon, I really hope they don't shard any of the capital cities, I want to see the chaos on launch day!
---
Here's what you need to understand. Playing a ret paladin requires the most amount of dedication, gold, time, and luck . Luck getting into a guild that will allow you to raid let alone get gear, the patience to get geared last. I want you to succeed, but it's not a joke how difficult it will be for you
---
so if you have 100% uptime on the vulnerability from t2, how much dps should a hunter be able to pull off in naxx fully buffed + on-use trinket rotations? is it worth bringing more than 3 hunters if they all have full t2?
---
Duo leveling guide: If it says "collect 10 bear asses" grind mobs instead until you get 'quest + x mobs' amount of XP, then move on.
---
Only practical difference.

Am I the only one who thinks it would be a pretty bad idea to join this sub’s chosen server?
---
Personal choice, I suppose, but I wouldn’t do it. Maybe it will survive, but I’d expect a slight excess of tryhard behaviour and attitudes. Nothing wrong with minmaxing, but some people are downright *dogmatic* about how to play vanilla.
---
Day one will very likely have sharding, they have pretty much confirmed it. 
---
But I think they also said something about turning it off after a week or two, or they're considering turning it off for higher level zones. Cant remember which, but I'm sure it's one or the other 
---
They could make these mounts BOP to prevent that. Or make it so mounts cost a lot and skill is cheap until they introduce armored mounts. 
---
I'll bet they consider this somehow. 
---
Yeah, that’s the thing about their sharding comments that set my worries off a little. If you’re sharding every starting zone for weeks, surely the major cities will need sharding for even longer, or perhaps the other later zones at launch. 
---
The server capabilities on BFA haven’t always been great as far as how many people it can support before it crashes. 
---
Iirc on my PvE server in Vanilla the Horde:Alliance ratio was more 1:2.
---
For some reason the guy in the other thread posted partial results, this is the full data from the source itself.
---
Good to hear! It was starting to sound like people may have a token pally just for blessings and that’s about that.
---
You plan on keeping it sealed? Someday it might be worth a small fortune.
---
Remember sit doesnt guarantee 100% crits in retail.
---
That was a private server thing.
---
"Statistics" are only considered "large" if they represent a decent amount of the population. 10k is not representative of WoW(classic) population.
---
We don't even know where he sourced these "people" from.
---
Good bor
---
The real benefit of riding a kodo.
---
Perfect. Now my dwarf rouge will be unique.
---
As a lvl60 warrior could I tank 5mans as Arms spec? My plan is to tank for quick groups, be the only plate user, keep all loot for pvp.
---
I probably won't have time for raiding unfortunately..
---
Same. The only shot I have left are the early days of TBC tanking kara on my belf pally. I'm wearing a multicolor rainbow of gear!
---
Ahh the guild killer.
---
Troll Rogue and proud! 
---
Not gonna lie...  Those ARE a pain to maintain in a raid group...
---
Wtf is that hunter wearing 2.5?
---
Rogues have the worst leveling getting ganked during it wont help.
---
Ultimately horizontal expansion wouldn't work because Classic has vertical progression. 
---
You can't preserve Classic and ask for a horziontal game. 
---
Its an interesting question might be "If we were starting from scratch, what would a horizontal WoW look like?", but I don't think you can squeeze in all these expansions, unless there was a plan to redesign things to make it fit.
---
Bad animations probably
---
https://www.wowhead.com/quest=1149/test-of-faith was a pretty unique quest for Vanilla
---
&gt;maybe... though lore wise they make sense since the eredar have been there since the sundering and they were in warcraft 3.
---
right, but you didnt need to make them space cows.  they should have just preserved the dranei that knew from war3
---
Others have said the same but I’ll chip in. If you commit to tanking, you’ll be a tank. Go prot and you’ll win any disagreement over who tanks the 5 or 10 man with a fury warr who wants prebis prot gear. If you don’t level as prot, at least consider getting improved shield block in the protection tree (11 point commitment iirc). It’s important you tank dungeons when levelling so you can learn, become confident, and hit 60 with some tank gear. Don’t go into a dungeon at the minimum or even average level, spam ones you’re slightly overlevelled for so you don’t have trouble; and all your groups think you’re a god. They’ll remember you. 
---
Join a guild as prot after you’ve got some good +defense blues and they’ll be more than happy to start you off offtanking UBRS and MC. In your first few MC raids you’ll pick up some T1 gear and then - you’re the man, man. 
---
It’s quite a direct progression path. If you tank dungeons levelling you’ll learn everything you need to know on the job. Don’t get discouraged by the deadmines, that shit is hard for a tank without tools. 
---
Yeah I’m assuming equal gear/consumables, if you had the same you could boots away or nade. But your point is very valid.  Never know what your opponent has up his sleeve. 
---
People seem to enjoy that clip so here is [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehNQb6hhNjc) gem. Check out that healthbar and hold on to your butts.
---
Nothing wrong with off tank. It’s a lot of fun.
---
So many that didn’t play Vanilla that have no clue what’s coming. There will floods of complaints about the speed of leveling, no mounts and the cost of mounts, how running to a dungeon instance is so tedious and takes too much of their time....so many things it’s funny.....
---
So looking forward to this
---
Very true
---
So do you think I’d just have a much better time playing human warrior? I want to play ret but if I can’t get my gear until the content isn’t even current anymore then I am not so sure about pally
---
One point I wanna squeeze into #3 and 4, I think its REALLY stupid dranei are basically immortal. It kinda takes away what makes the night elves special, especially when dranei are effectively immortal....for no reason? 
---
For point #5, do you mean specifically the 5 heroes from War2? From a narrative perspective, I think you need some survivors from War2's expedition to give Alliance players intrigue and context. 
---
Granted TBC's quests didn't really either of those justice. 
---
Just because you'll never have to apologize for being educated doesn't mean the rest of us should have to.
---
Just correcting a dude, not insulting in anyway. It's a common mistake people are making recently.
---
This made me happy.
---
I just want to play on an East Coast Server this time, instead of a West Coast Server.  I really don't feel like raiding MC/BWL until 2am anymore.  So i really hope they release a list of servers and some way to figure out server times as well.
---
Lmao. Nice try newkid
---
I adore the night elf zones, especially vanilla Darkshore, or even more specifically, Auberdine. Really looking forward to fishing off those docks again, or worrying I'll miss the boat to Menethil and end up in the water with the threshadons.
---
&gt;Before they announced BC nobody knew anything would reset inside wow. As far as we knew, that gear we spent months farming was gonna be relevant forever. 
---
Err isnt that kinda foolish? Isnt that how expansions packs in MMO worked?
---
Yup, Strikers 2.5 set. 
---
Not every guild in the game has a minimum 4h raid time. 
---
If it feels like it’s the same stuff all the time, it’s only because I check every day all day. 
---
Find a guild with a 2-3hr raid window that matches up with your availability and you're good to go.
---
There’s quite a few shitty posts but it’s better than nothing. Also it’s where we get our blue posts on Classic so I guess it’s worth hanging out in. 
---
Even average guilds wont take a Ret
---
Hell average players in modern WoW are the most demanding in terms of requirement, they need the "best" to cover their own deficiencies. 
---
Retail WoW is now in a state where people demand Prot Warriors for 15+ mythic keys, despite it not being that necessary. 
---
We have pug Normal raid runs that require Heroic achievements. Its completely stupid.
---
That same mentality will sadly plague Classic
---
I'll be in the same boat, and am tentatively planning on running a spec like this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSczf9AEATAD8ASg
---
I think it would be sufficient for tanking 5/10 man dungeons, and maybe even off-tanking for pug raids.  And for casual PvP, it's not missing too much... really just Piercing Howl.
---
Its weird that you think this, a human combat rogue with swords can level just fine, and I always level hemo spec with only a marginal drop off in terms of efficiency so that I can pvp as I go.
---
Why do you even want to play ret? All you do is cast judgment and auto attack like 90% of the time.
---
Shamans can use daggers though. There are daggers that look similar to that.
---
It's an amazing quest. Doing it the first time resulted in a guild being made.
---
Don't try this at home.
---
2-3 hours for a raid isnt reliable as a tank. when progressing through content you can be in a raid for a really long time and if you are leaving 2 hours in as a tank that will not be good. 
---
what i would suggest instead is just go dps warrior and off tank when asked. but not be a reliable dedicated tank 
---
I joined late BC, and I used to sit around watching friends play WOW before I finally got it. I stopped a few updates into WotLK because life just got in the way. I have been doing a deep dive into madseason, tipsout, karzog and a few others just to make sure my rose tinted glasses are more accurate to what I should expect. I never made it to max level or got to raid so I am definitely excited about that possibility, although I will be taking my time and enjoying the journey to 60.
---
I still remember my gnome rogue in STV working through the skill trees and seeing the sword specialization, that was when I really started to understand the game more in depth. I look forward to the difficulty of leveling (the return of "Grats" on achieving a level) the struggle of finding groups for dungeons, but also look forward to the comradere of being in a guild/group.
---
I am also really interested to see how the advance in technology will effect vanilla, we have more resources for research, discord for organization/communication, and generally know what to expect. With that said I have limited my research a bit in order to preserve some of the organic exploration of my character, abilities, and the world.
---
Is it good for pvp?
---
Sorry but you will likely be asked to heal by your guild for progression.
---
Just find a casual guild that will let you raid as a ret pally. My friends and I are making a guild which any spec is fine, as long as you actually show up and are a nice guy.
---
Now as ret you gotta have something useful, so spec a bit into the prot tree for blessing of kings, we wouldn’t mind you dpsing every raid. 
---
Now we would only take 1 ret though, let’s not get crazy. We’re also looking for a prot pally offtank just for sanctuary buff
---
Exactly. 
---
Play at launch and have fun with the rush of the crowds. Be engulfed in the nostalgia.. then if the realm you're on dwindles after a few weeks, just pay the few bucks for a transfer. The concern/worry and studying on where famous annoying streamers are and dodging them isn't worth the hassle. And if its low pop realm, buy all the stuff then transfer. Boom. $$$
---
real tryhard nolifes makes proper food in advance to be healthy so more gametime is possible. 
---
I'll be avoiding the popular servers, and find one of the most casual PvE servers to roll on.
---
Dark Lady watch over you...
---
Yes it does but it doesn't proc reckoning/enrage.
---
Pretty interesting. I'd expect the PvE/PvP type balance to be closer to 50/50 (with more folks on PvE -- if I had to guess). So redditers prefer PvP servers more than the average player. Paladin numbers are higher than i'd expect too - likely due to redditers being woke af.
