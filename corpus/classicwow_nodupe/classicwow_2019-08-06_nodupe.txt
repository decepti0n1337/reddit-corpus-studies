While you can raid as PVP frost, it will not be as optimal, since many talents do not carry over.  Example, Frostbite and Shatter don't do much in raids, since bosses can not be frozen.
---
You' be able to raid with your PvP spec. Unless you're like the top guild
---
Exactly this.  
---
  
---
If everyone can get rank 14, then rank 14 is not special.  
---
Is it perfect? Absolutely not. I agree it rewards time over skill. But honestly I'm kind of okay with that?
---
The Darkspear trolls were on some remote island which was invaded by some witch. No night elves.

How-to-start-a-fire-and-make-neckbeards-lose-their-shit-online 101
---
Yeah there are shitheads everywhere. Tanking in classic is different, maybe more challenging. The lvling being slower, you guys should have more time than needed to practice it. Hell, regular pulls in the world can be challenging!
---
Can someone please ask on the wow forums for me (I have no level 10 character) whether you can only create (and delete) characters THAT DAY, or can it be done at any time prior to the 27th?
---
So I downloaded the game today, will it be ready to play release day/time or do I have to download classic as well?
---
I thought ninja referred to rogues wearing cloth. I mean i wasn't totally wrong but...
---
Where did I park my goblin shredder?
---
What are you going to do? Bubble hearth on us?
---
I think I could have everyone beat here.   
---

---
When I first tried playing, I didn't realize that auto-attacks were a toggle. So I kept hitting the button to auto, which essentially made me attack either REALLY SLOWLY or barely at all. I was wondering why I felt so weak. Glad I figured that out...... maybe 5 hours into the game... I hate myself sometimes.
---
They managed to live for a long time without resorting to that because their planet wasn't being destroyed by the Burning Legion.  Gul'dan, having been groomed by Kil'jaeden, was a master at scheming, and the orcs were desperate.
---
Furthermore, the Legion wouldn't have even had the interest they did in the orc homeworld had it not been for the arrival of the draenei, who were being pursued by the Legion when they found their refuge.  And there are plenty of draenei who have been corrupted by the Legion over the ages as well, so it seems hypocritical to suggest this sort of behavior is innate to orc culture but not draenei culture.
---
Ill try and take it so I don't have to see it on my server.  Maybe an AH mule or something.
---
*Toxic* to the other faction is perfectly acceptable
---
I wish I could upvote this twice.
---
IIRC they were going to use focus (like Cata+) but they pulled it before release
---
Oh you mean the Lorderon noble? The same Lorderon that is allied with the horde and not the alliance?
---
The only people I hear hating flying mounts are the people who gank flight path choke points. I play the world's smallest violin for their concerns. Thrallmar was still camped, Nagrand existed for you, and we got BEM and Netherstorm, which were fantastic. Plus I got to do barrel rolls. No, flying mounts in TBC rocked.
---
It's not about what you meant I'm telling you imo if you're going on a scale of "lawful to chaotic" , warlock is most chaotic 
---
Like you said u can't tell you what you mean, but you also seem to think all I want to talk about is you? Lol sorry I like my own opinions too much for that bud , can organize it with shaman and pala on the ends *if* youre lining it up by "lawful to chaotic".
---
It would be like me saying "rate this on a scale from 1-10" but instead of a 1 where the 1 should be, it's a Q and where the 10 is it's a ∆
---
The fact that the high end pvp grind is 100% about time spent and 0% about skills. I dont mind pve being easy but pvp should really focus atleast somewhat on skills.
---
Healing spec to raid. Leave raid and respec to dps spec to farm. Then when raid time came you would need to respec healing. 100g
---
Just filled it out! :) Where does the application go?
---
Majordomo in moltencore drops an item that begins a quest chain to get a epic staff that could transform between a holy form (benediction) and a shadow form (anathema). The chain was only avaible for priests, and thus the weapon is a very iconic priest weapon! 
---
Hunters also had a similar quest chain, which lead to a bow/staff.
---
Just be aware that it can be a double edged sword (no pun intended :)). While weapon upgrades are at times huge and you feel god like for three to four levels, the opposite will also happen where you begin to out-level your weapons and you will feel significantly weaker against mobs. 
---
Obviously do not let this deter you from the class you want to play, just things to keep in mind :)
---
Sorry to break it to you but YOU'RE the shit bag who brought politics into this. His comment was a simple question, you're the one who looks like the asshole here buddy. Regardless of what subreddits they choose to follow. It has nothing to do with not having thick skin. You don't know my wife. She's the toughest greatest human being in existence.  It was said at the start that she was new. No one responded to that. We got through 75-80% of the dungeon with zero issues at all. Towards the end of the last boss there is groups of enemies we all walked past on our mounts and she accidentally triggered one. It was a simple misrakw and the group who at this point said nothing responded in just a way extreme way. You know. Kind of like you.
---
Also worth noting he was from Lorderon and not Stormwind. Last time I checked Lorderon is allied with the Horde.
---
I legit kinda look forward to the assholes as well. Plenty of stories of assholes known server-wide were super amusing.
---
The utility doesn't stack though, you bring 1 to buff locks and then there's no reason to bring any more. And even then there needs to be at least 4 locks in the raid to even consider bringing an SP. 
---
Unless something changes, better guilds wont have raid spots for SPriests most of the time
---
You... you are just dumb.
---
The dragons were there to safe guard the world in general, they are not the old god's jailers. 
---
Titan Constructs and facilities were designed to fulfill that role. Ulduar is a good example of that. 
---
As for Deathwing, it may be retconned now, but the Old Gods corrupted Deathwing because they knew the Legion was out there, and wanted to lure them to Azeroth. They knew that the Legion was going to destroy the planet or otherwise cause enough damage to  set them free), so they helped Deathwing construct the dragonsoul. 
---
The dragonsoul kind of operates like the One Ring in this case. Deathwing is obsessed with it and treats it like a precious item. It is stolen from him and given to the "Bad" Night Elves to summon the Legion into Azeroth via the well of eternity. 
---
https://youtu.be/DF-ALycXVww?t=1239
---
The Old Gods fight him off because they want the Legion to get into Azeroth so that they can either control the Legion itself, or have the planet destroyed / jails destroyed. Deatwhing turns into Gollum, essentially. A useful tool, but nothing more. 
---
This was the story as far as Cataclysm goes.
---
Hey that's rude! No need to call them names. 
---
Now if you were to be so polite, they have orders from onyxia to follow and a couple more literal concentration camps to build while they exile the masons who rebuilt their city and their high elf allies to betray as they fend off the scourge... You know the same ones they let annihilate lorderon b/c they let politics getting in the way of genocide.
---
There's a number of elements in Vanilla/Classic that actively discourage you from playing the game.  Stacking and preserving flasks world buffs is an example—Finish a raid with an hour left on your flasks?  Better log out and not play again until the next raid night.  Respecing for PvE and PvP too, maximizing yourself in PvE often means forgoing competitive PvP unless you want to pay steep respec costs.
---
Also the R14 grind.  I'm absolutely for putting great rewards behind challenging content, but no game should encourage that level of unhealthy play.
---
Im torn between mage and warrior
---
If there are multiple servers how will I find you? Faction? I’d love to join the crew!
---
carebears man, what can we do. 
---
They will die if they go PVP and we can enjoy the forum drama.
---
Thex
---
No Blood Elves in classic.
---
&gt; the abandonment of previous content.
---
You can't prevent that and have levels without turning WoW into Diablo. The timewarped events are actually a nice solution to this.
---
Yup. It's been working just fine for pservers for years already. Don't see why they wouldn't make it work for classic.
---
If you put arms warrior as neutral, I'd put shadow preist as neutral. You **need** a shadow preist or two, you don't need an arms warrior. Playing as an arms warrior is hurting your raid since you could just run fury spec, but you actually do need people specced as shadow for shadow damage increase.
---
Somewhat off-topic while also somewhat on-topic, I was considering going Shaman, watched Unbreakable's PvP video of him just getting windfury crits and it looked basic as hell. Is there more depth to Enhancement spec than that, and the class at large?
---
Most people pick something cutesy for females (Pixie, Trixie, Gabbie, Blinx (perfect for a mage leave me alone)--basically anything that ends in -i, -ie, or -y, like Becki or Sunny, or even something pleasant like Sunshine, Joy, Happy. Penelope is an obvious choice, too (though I just think of Penelope Pitstop for some reason). 
---
Males are a little harder I think; it's pretty easy to veer right into goofy names territory. You could go for names that sound similar to famous inventors; that could be fun, and it might be even more fun if it's an inventor that isn't an everyday household name. But you could go for ie/y/i names too, like Sparky, Richie, etc. 
---
If you're super into RP, you can pick a normal first name and a crazier last name, like Liam Torchpipe or Gillian Gearwrench.
---
Okay.

Icelance, that feel of raw burst just isn't the same without it. Oh, and bloodlust, coolest raid ability ever added to the game.
---
Eh, not much different, instead of staying out of the fire &amp; playing whack-a-mole on raid frames, you are staying out of the fire &amp; playing whack-a-mole on your spell bar watching cool down timers.
---
That's the problem. That's toxic politeness. Should have told op to fuck off and suck a dick.
---
Where is the West Coast??
---
I know. So don't use shield lol
---
This is wrong in a lot of ways. Shadow is amazing for leveling. I think you meant I hope you like spending money on drinks. Also disc is not top tier for pvp. It’s the glue spec between holy and shadow.
---
/r/beetlejuicing
---
How can you compare stiffing the stonemasons guild to DRINKING DEMON BLOOD?
---
what do you mean, now we finally start playing the game
---
Female players.
---
If you're doing more wanding than healing then the tank is clearly too slow/too careful with pulling and should speed things up.
---
Paladin
---
You're wrong and you should feel wrong!
---
I thought Greed would get priority because you were being greedy.
---
I'm on shifts, IL try raid on the weeks I'm on dayshift with my guild and pug the other 2 I guess. I think your best bet is to just find a social friendly guild that wanna process a bit and see if they let you drop in every 2 weeks or so when you are not working.
---
I mean...what if my goal IS to get HK's?
---
Oh oops im retarded. Didn't even realize he was talking about priest shield. Yeah it's annoying for warriors thats for sure. Does the same thing happen for druid tanks? Do they generate rage from being hit?
---
Bolvar is the regent lord of SW during vanilla so he's the one calling the shots until Anduin is of age. No doubt his decisions were influenced by that dragon pussy.
---
They were allowed not too long ago, but it did get very tiresome seeing 10 polls a day about the same thing
---
Nobody will be doing that
---
As someone who had 300+ days on a dwarf priest in vanilla, I lived in those &amp; deviate delights so definitely one of my favorite things in wow
---
Ah, so just made up bullshit then?
---
He was on Arthas. I played Horde there and saw him in pvp/wpvp a fair amount. Was never a fun time when I ran into him :(
---
Pretty much. In this sub especially they use it to mean joke or troll. The actual definition is just "a element of culture or system of behaviour that is shared between people". So it's not terribly far off.
---
You're getting it for free, with purchase of a retail sub.
---
The need/greed system. First dungeon i ever went into was in WoTLK which was the xpac i started with. I was pretty brand new to the game and had no one to show me the ropes. At the end of the dungeon I saw a cool helm i could equip drop and really wanted it so i needed. 
---
The tank then threw a massive tanty because "iT wAs clEaRLy a TaNk iTeM." (note this was level 10) and just kept hurling abuse at me. The rest of the group told him to shut up cos it's not like he wouldn't replace it in a few levels anyway.
---
Now I now how the system works and I just laugh at that. Admittedly I laughed at it then too.
---
I never got past the starter zones as a melee mage, like I did on Diablo 2.
---
Hopefully, the major ones will announce it and we can all plan accordingly.
---
Do a dungeon with them and take 0.2 seconds too long to pull.
---
They will be complaining about Classic.
---
Brutal.
---
People role playing as time travelers aren’t gonna care.
---
NA PVE thats all i need
---
Dang.  Idda though they were just 3D printed.
---
(pretty sure he was joking)
---
Haha I don’t plan on it.
---
Like why the hell did I agree to take the rap, Harvey Dent killed those people, who gives a crap?!
---
Oh? Do people do objs or is it just a really long back and forth?
---
Gnomes have smaller hitboxes on private servers then in classic.
---
Respecs
---
Locks are in super high demand for vanilla. One of the best raid dps and you will want 7ish for MC groups. Also for whatever reason locks were the least played class on private servers in recent years.
---
So given those trends, I think you'll fare well as lock. Plus your pve and pvp specs are pretty much the same :D
---
Having leveled as a Disc Priest in Vanilla, this guy is right. I would take a Warrior grind over Disc Priest leveling all day every day.
---
Leveling a Priest the second time around as Shadow was like night and fucking day, Shadow is the superior leveling spec, hands down.
---
Stealth team capping FP, PST
---
As someone who has played Priest since vanilla beta, I think you did a good job. Like some others said... Holy/disc for pvp. I agree on shadow being mediocre for leveling. Shadow isnt even better than dsic/holy until level 40 then it ramps up on the way to 60. Compared to other classes, it's neutral.
---
Two things:
---
1) Not being on a gear treadmill.  I have a clear, obtainable BiS list and can “finish” a character.
---
2) People being happy when you joined their PUG because reputations existed and mattered.
---
You know you put Priest over Paladin twice? The bigger end of &gt; indicates 'better than'. Unless that was your point.
---
Butt Rockets
---
Not to mention the "experience" they've gained on instant 60 severs with full maxed professions, unlimited Free Action Potions/Living Action Potions, instant full T3 gear, every trinket in the game provided, etc. will be completely different from any real world application in Classic.
---
I’ll probably be playing on a PVP server so hopefully it won’t affect me as much.
---
Dude they had a wand though right? Or maybe it was an off hand? Frost damage what’s upppppp
---
Exactly. The best in slot weapon for a spec shouldn't come out of Gnomeregan. A mele spec swinging nightfall shouldn't be on par with a hunter meleing with nightfall. Slightly boosting those specs in at least pve content wouldn't affect the game in a negative way IMO.
---
"hey you. you're finally awake"
---
 If you see a new player, give their ass some 6 slot bags and hit em with a /wave. That new player needs to understand that this is a world of War**craft**, and they need to be educated about professions and helping your fellow player.
---
If you see a retail player, thank them for giving WoW Classic a try and ask them what they think of it.
---
This is an MMORPG. A real one. And like the real world, it can be brutal out there. Be sure to add to the day with helping them with any elite quests they might be on. You will be forced to communicate with other players, and you just might make a friend. Just remember that you and your friends and your guild are the best and everyone else maybe still be learning. Help them not be trash.
---
Simply, just remember WWTD - What would Thrall Do?
---
Thank you
---
God I've been craving Madseason so this will get me by. Thanks man, would love any more of this kinda stuff.
---
You sure?  I started in TBC and I remember (vaguely) having to change my ranks every time I got the next rank.  Though my memory isn't great lol/
---
Fixed that for ya ;)
---
Bro there’s no way big streamers will be able to hide their server for longer than an hour after servers go up. Everyone of their mob will hunt them down and find them and spread it
---
Wait until you have to collect boar meat
---
Yeah, that was in the press release when they announced Classic: only playable on Macs. You have to use the authenticator only available on the iPhone.
---
Paladins are so insanely powerful in Vanilla and the key Alliance PvP, I'm legit surprised more people aren't choosing Paladin.
---
Shadow is one of the best leveling specs in the game, 5/5 wands then full shadow, you never stop to drink
---
What
---
As all these little bugs pop up I wonder if blizzard is gonna commit to "working as intended" and update the tooltips or fix them all
---
I'm eyeing up 39's myself. Never had a chance to play that bracket
---
Isn't disc the superior raiding spec?
---
I still use Q and E to strafe but A and D for abilities. Tried A and D as strafe for a while and it didn't feel right
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but once Naxx comes around most of the BiS pieces are plate right?
---
I enjoy organic community events and being there as it grows and people make a name for themselves. Joining a server with asmongold will always just be known as asmongold’s server and will just attract a lot of the sweaty kids
---
Any form of a taunt on prot pal
---
And the Joker pulls crimes in such an orderly manner. He must write it down in an evil day planner.
---
Woah! Will have to test that during the stress test. Solid suggestion, thanks
---
You can corpse camp to your hearts content.
---
I hope constructive criticism is allowed, but this reeks of toxicity
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
I mainly did the exalted AV grind for the epic mount. I was poor and hated grinding, had way more fun grinding pvp for my epic than grinding gold. Plus that AV wolf was badass and nobody had it.
---
Paladinsmash is mine
---
In terms of speed leveling your 5 points in discipline for wand damage are first, then 5 points in shadow for spirit tap then you either put more in shadow (save a Respec) or go holy until Respec sometime in 40s. Holy is faster until you get shadow form and you probably don't want to ever lose your wand specialization points.
---
Wands + spirit tap guarantee you never have to drink, so it is kind of hard to put priest in your imagine since all three specs are blended together and are actually really strong for leveling.
---
Still trying to pick a name for my drawf and orc 
---
Main contenders are
---
D: Sigmar, Jan, Karl
---
O: Vargrim, Kor, Korak
---
First respec is 1g.
---
patch 1.3 is responsible for my favorite warlock mechanic; double shadowbolts.
---
Pretty sure you're gay
---
Also a simple scroll of the wheel can register many key presses in rapid succession, much faster and less work than spamming 2 for SS, and from a min max perspective you on average will get your skill off with less lost time between the cast/cooldown and when the key is pressed
---
No group finder/shards is one of the things I'm looking forward to the most. In BGs I understand the need to have battle groups for queue times when a server is imbalanced one way or another. With dungeons, I don't like it at all. Don't like zero people talking in chat either because between queues and quest markers there is nothing to ask about.

**\[Blackrock Candy Co.\]**\[H\]\[UsWest\]\[Pvp\]\[Tues Thurs 6-10pm PST\]
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**Introduction:**
---
Blackrock candy Co. is a mostly casual, semi hard-core raiding guild focused on clearing raid content as efficiently as possible while maintaining a fun raiding atmosphere.   We aspire to build an extraordinary, camaraderie based community that mutually respects our members not just as gamers, but as people.  We want the player, not the class. However, if you want world firsts or to be the top everything, everywhere, at all times, this is probably not the guild for you.  This is more like a Health Department B+ rated restaurant.  You know they don't clean their bathrooms enough, but the graffiti in the stalls is hilarious, and the food is worth the risk.
---
**Expectations:**
---
Come prepared.  Show up early to a raid night with consumables.  Know your rotation, curses, buffs etc.  We are looking for eager, active, skilled, friendly players that possess a sense of humor, the ability to not be offended easily, and want to help us grow into a fun, camaraderie based, B+ rated restaurant. New and veteran players alike are welcome to apply.
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We're recruiting a robust roster in order to ensure we are able to accomplish the goals we set for ourselves as a team and community.  Priority will be given to those who commit themselves to gearing and preparing before raids start.
---
**Warrior:  High**
---
**Schedule:**
---
Tuesday and Thursday 6pm to 10pm Pst.
---
**Loot:**
---
Modified Dkp
---
**Discord:**
---
We are going to run everything through discord to keep it super simple for our raiders, so no digging through or signing up for websites and all of that. \[url\][https://discord.gg/AEvrAdr\[/url\]](https://discord.gg/AEvrAdr[/url])
---
**Charter:**

---
Well my point is they won't exist
---
The BFA talent system is one of the worst things I've ever experienced. Classic talent trees were so great and so much better than what other games did at the time or what blizz does now.
---
play the "paradox" card.
---
World PvP twinks are useless since a lvl 60 can just come one shot them
---
And a 999 gold stable ingame, else you can't store your mount. just a special feature for apple users.
---
"Time to go, no pun intended." says Chromie. "Just enter this portal and you'll be back where you belong." You walk through with purpose, and suddenly... darkness.
---
Slowly you start to open your eyes.
---
 "Hey, you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right?"
---
The lack of LFG &amp; LFR, and the fact you have to actually travel to the instance you want to do means that although it takes longer to get to said dungeon, it also means you wont see people raging over a simple mistake and then wanting to kick people very often if at all. In the earlier dungeons you might see it because the retail kiddies will be out and about and not realize. But anything gnomer and beyond? No,that sort of thing will be quite rare. It's more time efficient to just explain how a fight works than to rage kick the offending player, and then go outside to try and find a fill in.
---
You clearly thought this was funny...this isn't funny at all..it's horrifying in a black widow on your leg kind of way.
---
50% chance it become cooked beef.
---
Was on a 7 day trial with lvl 20 limit, human warrior.... went off exploring, wandered into Stonard... Every time I rezzed I was 1-shotted again.... and again.... and again. Almost deleted the game. Though it still would have been a bit of a ghost walk to a different graveyard. To this day I give horde bases a very wide berth.
---
Sorry for you but no :(
---
Off tanks don't spec prot
---
Fuck it, I don't care if he's not human. I am rolling Harry Dresden or some form of it.
---
&gt; if you're going on a scale of "lawful to chaotic" , warlock is most chaotic
---
And I'm telling you if you put Shaman and Paladin at the ends, Shaman and Paladin will be at the ends
---
&gt; you also seem to think all I want to talk about is you?
---
You are currently talking to me...
---
&gt; Just cant organize it with shaman and pala on the ends if youre lining it up by "lawful to chaotic".
---
I can and I did. :)
---
Dont make fun of gay people you trashbag
---
Ha! I love it. Just trying to poke fun at the current top post by "fixing" it here. Your post looked a lot like that one.
---
true
---
offtopc: Everytime someone links to that graph I wonder why people says wotlk is the most popular expansion. The population it had is tbc + pre-expansion boost, and it plateau until the next pre-expansion boost
---
Honor is subjective and varies greatly between cultures and eras. 
---
Best real life example is Japan during ww2.
---
I just want a version with Korrak the Bloodrager in it so I can finish that damn quest on my paladin.
---
And why is Morgan Freeman all pissed at me? He seemed to resign kinda randomly..Its okay to build me an armored tank car. But, oh, tapping phones, that's going too far!!
---
yea too bad i posted about it an hour before this one. but okay cool!

This movie of my life just doesn't hold together

Did you come from the future to warn us about these jokes?

No u

Didn't rogues have to drop poisons on their mainhand to get the WF buff?
---
Be me: Green leader makes a deal with a demon for power. 
---
Whatever, I didn't even vote for the guy. 
---
Ever since green leader drank from the weird chalice I'm now angry all the time. Weird. 
---
Doesn't matter though, I guess I'll go through the portal. Could be fun.
---
Killing people, still mad. Don't really know why.
---
Anger has gone away, the small pink people say I'm a slave now. Easy come easy go.
---
The pink people are making me fight my enslaved brothers to the death in an arena. I don't think I like these small pink people.
---
Green Jesus just broke me out of slavery and now we're leaving the pink people kingdom. 
---
Guess we're going to cross the ocean now. 
---
Chilled for a few years in the new land across the ocean. Bunch of pink people showed up and are super mad for some reason. Fuck'um, I miss my brother who died in the slave arena. 
---
I take up my old brother's name and swear to fight off the pink menace. I am Thex!
---
Lvl 60s aren't hanging around the lower level zones
---
At least beats the crap out of, Batman Forever. I enjoy car chases, explosions and suspense. Is it too much to ask that it all makes sense?
---
I suck lol
---
Depends on whether you're speed running content or need the extra healing from farther down the holy tree i think.
---
Consumable stacking is a thing. It matters a lot if you want to min/max, and will require you to spend a lot of time out-of-raid farming either the consumables or gold to buy them.
---
Starting in TBC they limited how many consumables you could have going at once. Something like 1 Flask (or 1 Battle and 1 Guardian Elixir) and 1 Food. This drastically reduced the amount of time you would need to spend getting ready for your weekly raids.
---
In Classic, you can literally stack over a couple dozen different potions/elixirs/etc all at once. If you truly want to min-max, you'll need stacks of all of the relevant ones for your class for each raid.
---
Why not ditch the crit and go for mortal strike instead
---
And a waste of your own time as well.
---
I've leveled both dude, mages are trash at single target efficiency. Priest kill speed is still faster than mage kill speed + drinking.
---
Who would even think they mean per realm...
---
Some objectives are gone for, some aren't. I'm not sure of the current meta and what objectives are time wastes. There tends to be a lot of fighting in mid and I even recently saw one of the summonable bosses.
---
Any Alliance druid mains wanna join my raiding guild? Pm me.
---
Y’all smell that?
---
Obviously they are happy with it, otherwise the meta wouldn't have developed into that?
---
&gt; All the positive druid posting here is setting folks up for failure
---
10/10 good bait

So if you talk to your doctor it should only be about them? 
---
&gt;You are currently talking to me...
---
200IQ
---
Layering is okay since you'll just be seeing a smaller portion of the same people. When it goes away you'll be seeing the people you leveled around just altogether. It'll be over before we know it.
---
Make them hate you so much that they'l want to progress faster just to kick your ass
---
Maybe you should stop dying if you are worried about a rez.
---
The Lone Idiots, that would be a good guild name if I wasn't worried about bans
---
You are criminally fucking stupid. Like it doesn't affect me whatsoever but I just can't understand what kind of stupid shit goes on in your head to make you type those words.
---
THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE OP WAS THAT TBC WOULD OPERATE **ENTIRELY** AT LEVEL 60 INSTEAD. 
---
"*but da wata from da vendorz requierz lvl 68 wat da hek i cant drink da wata"*
---
Please read... kthanks.
---
/spit
---
Yeah you could do it, but if you're concerned about Orgrimmar and Darkspear rep you might want to stick to Durotar.
---
damn, I was too slow
---
Put me on your blacklist and return when you are stronger!
---
&gt; So if you talk to your doctor it should only be about them? 
---
If I make that the topic, I probably wouldn't turn around and snark at the doctor for talking about himself.
---
Thanks bud, not sure why the nerds downvoted me though lol
---
90% of this is available on retail
---
Well imagine seeing your whole kingdom being destroyed by undead just to face one that tells you "hey we are undead aswell. we also destroyed it with them but now we are nice people."
---
Those poor minutemen truly were good men to forgive and side with them for the good. A shame that it was no difference between the forsaken and the scourge.
---
If they were racist they would not have their back stabbed by the forsaken dont they?
---
The only racist human was the commander that treated the bloodelves like shit and im not even sure if he was part of the kirin tor or the lordaeron kingdom but yeah, fuck that one.
---
I'm sick of all of these developers making their games for Mac and waving off the PC crowd
---
Back to retail with you!  There are no gnome priests in Classic.
---
Yes but you are Neutral with them, so you can not take the quests in starting area at Orcs
---
Learn /say their language.
---
Make a second account only for that purpose.
---
I'm out of options right now.
---
I'm pretty sure the dark iron dwarves summoned ragnaros to help kick the black rock orcs out of their mountain.
---
hur dur retail classes are all the same
---
upvotes to the left
---
&gt;snark
---
 Lel you got some thin skin my duder, maybe you haven't been on Reddit (or the internet?) too long.
---
But , you're the same guy who thinks when someone is talking to them the convo is immediately about them lol.
---
Finally. I was waiting for the Realm-Names to commit to a Guild.
---
Who's top deeps? ALL THAT MATER BRO!
---
59 sounds fun. Was it actually popular?
---
yes, do it on a pserver takes only 10 mins or less
---
I have many a good memory of mind controlling people off the cliff near Razorfen Downs..
---
Hello,
---
What is your preferred way to be contacted to talk about the guild?
---
It is other way around. T3 paladin is hands down the best tank healer.
---
Do not drive home. Tell yer customer how important this is.
---
no private server has the 1.5 AV map so don't lie
---
Thex transcends race.
---
You'll be fine unless you're in a tippy top tier raid guild.
---
Druids are still the least popular class according to that huge poll that was posted here, but I expect there will still be quite a few who end up disappointed that the class at 60 isn't what they expected. Hopefully they'll persevere and realize where its strengths lie and how awesome a class it really is. 
---
As a Vanilla druid main, I am prepared and I couldn't be more excited.
---
 HAM (Humans Against Monsters) \[NA\] \[Alliance\] \[PvP\] \[CST\]
---
### INTRODUCTION:
---
Humans Against Monsters is a completely new guild that is preparing for classic. We want to experience and enjoy how things used to be. Our goal is to not only establish a force in WPvP, but also build up a raid team to clear current content. We will be rolling on a PvP realm, as most of our core group comes from a private server background and fell in love with the struggles of STV and the joys of redridge.
---
### GUILD RECRUITMENT
---
We are recruiting members of any class and timezone that is interested in being a part of the guild. We are are CST timezone guild, however people from other timezones that express interest in joining can still join.
---
Any applicant of any class will be considered to be a part of the main roster for the raid team, as we are currently a very newly formed guild and still need to flesh out most of our roster.
---
If you are solely interested in PvP, you can also express interest in joining the pvp roster for BGs and WPvP, and, like our raiding roster, we still need every class.
---
### Expectations
---
We do not expect you to be on with every ounce of your free time that you have available. Real life comes first in every instance, and if you need to take time to do what you need to do, that always comes before the guild. However, we do expect you to be dedicated to the guild, and if you make a commitment then we expect you to follow it.
---
What you can expect from us is a stress-free enviornment where we try to enjoy everything that classic has to offer, from pvp to clearing content and farming gear for the guild. We will be utilizing an **EPGP system** to ensure people get priority for getting pieces that they want.
---
Our goals are coming in fresh on August 26th and actively building up our roster and reaching level cap in a reasonable fashion to be able to clear current content before the next phase is released.
---
### RAID TIMES
---
Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday 8pm CST - 11pm CST
---
**Battletag:** Mage#11834  
---
**Discord ID:** Magedaddy#4559  
---
**Discord Server:** [https://discord.gg/fXmF2Fa](https://discord.gg/fXmF2Fa)
---
Flying was alright, untill they added it to azeroth. Flying still not good for the game overall imo.
---
Rolling druid  - see you in NAXX!
---
What about class?
---
Humans stink. I want fight!
---
Did... did you know TBC was a level 70 expansion, or are there other things you also wanted to take out of the game?  I don’t know because I can’t read minds, willing to learn if you’re teaching.
---
what other kind is there?
---
Wonder who would win this matchup in PvP, assuming both sides had warrior since it's in the middle...
---
All horde starter zones are essentially connected.
---
Its really trivial to get from one to another at level 1.
---
I have the same idea. Hoping some alliance feel the same way
---
As deep Frost your dps will be pretty low and people will notice. It’s best to go Winter’s Chill spec and pick up some pvp talents. Nobody will mind if the Winter’s Chill Mage is doing low dps.
---
Given that earth spins and moves at an astonishing rate through the universe, you may want to add some relativity to your question.  I'll start:  relative to the East Coast, the West Coast is to the west.
---
Maybe it was wrath but I know it did it automatricly after a little bit
---
This is incorrect. There will be PVP, PVE, and RP servers. Just no RP-PVP.
---
"their mmo" i thought retail players were meant to be the entitled ones
---
I guess that’s true but you have no downtime of not pressing buttons and I just spam through cast times anyway for no reason.
---
Polls are fine.
---
Low effort polls are deleted.
---
Awesome. I was wanting to play on an rp server myself.
---
Easiest way to play games on Linux is to just dual boot.
---
Your tutorial is great. But from experience helping people fix issues and fixing my issues with Linux distros for the past couple decades: just dual boot.
---
Hahahahaha this one is the winner for me
---
Horde is a weak faction living in tents and rubble. Even the orcs dont belong here. Such a weak race they lost their home and now are trying to plague new lands.
---
I played actual Classic, Alliance side had a ridiculous population of Druids, a ton of them were resto. They were always. Always. Always. Used in Dungeons.
---
Nobody cares.
---
Corpse runs suck, yes, but if one guy dies it's probably his own fucking fault and he can run. If you all die then it's a corpse run anyway.
---
I swear to god, people.
---
guy top right looks like big dick dps
---
It would legit take you less then 2 hours to do this though. And you’re probably just better off.
---
technically, but why bench players and bring in fresh DPS when you can just maintain the same raid comp and buff your deeps?
---
This is disguised Alliance propaganda. You are making Alliance to be the bad guys... So you get to pick the bad guys and have the pretty character models?! 
---
Nice try Alliance scum!
---
1 enh shaman will be optimal for the horde.
---
Hahahaha when I first started playing I had made a priest after a warrior and mained that for BC, WAND STUFF SUCKED. I miss my priest.
---
&gt;by looking at the sub numbers
---
what sub numbers? nobody has any idea how many subs it has beyond speculation, the last time we got sub numbers was like 4 years ago
---
Completely agree that they're a great class. I'm personally on the fence about rolling one again for the reasons you mentioned, but I feel like a lot of folks have watched a shedo video and now expect feral dps to be competitive.
---
The Horde?? Alliance problem.
---
Other servers with a population imbalance had insane queue times for BGs.
---
Or, you know, just do what AutoMod says to you and message a moderator.
---
Consistent dmg from sinister strike? Without stealth rogues are wet noodles. Does't dispel and silence ruin a palas day enough once the bubble is done? Palas do better in bigger groups imo.
---
rip i used to skip all the time undergrad but when ur an adult paying for it yourself its much harder lol its like $300 per class =(
---
Just bind some of those on the pad to wasd and you don’t need the keyboard at all for wow!
---
What’s wrong with frost in vanilla?
---
People like to downvote any opinions about pvp vs pve but as long as you arent be a baby about being killed in a video game, pvp is half the experience.
---
Sometimes you get ganked. Sure. It makes the zones feel dangerous, but the trade off of the emergent gameplay on pvp servers is well worth it. All that I remember from levelling on private servers is the crazy pvp shit, not the 7000th fetch quest.
---
Sounds awfully similar to people on this sub hating retail with such a passion doesn't it?
---
Solid username
---
Auto quest completion just means you don't have to click through all the dialogues when turning in a quest unless you need to pick a reward. Saves you like half a second per quest.
---
I have questions. What’s your cost of living per month like (estimate is fine)? How do you shower? Where do you work? Is there stigma about the Van situation with coworkers or do they not know?
---
I won't dual boot, Windows has no place in my home anymore.  The only reason I had to keep Windows before was for gaming.  That reason disappeared with Proton, Lutris, etc. 
---
The fact they make you pay for the OS so they can collect your data, then sell it for even more money, while restricting your system control sinks the MS boat for me my friend.
---
I hope this helps others out there.
---
Pretty sure it's wrong. I remember healing in Kara a few months into TBC with like 3 different flash of light's on my bar.
---
you have to compete for longer time periods than world class athletes have to **practice** just to get a shot if your server is populated
---
that's not special, it's unhealthy and ridiculous because its not awarding skill, it's awarding time and unhealthy behaviours
---
I missed it too, don't feel bad.
---
For those curious there were a number of ways to do it....
---
1. Have a priest bubble your demon, then sacrifice it.
---
2. Time a resurrection spell just perfectly after it's sacrificed. The corpse lasts just long enough to pull it off.
---
3. Goblin jumper cables
---
The way demonic sacrifice worked was it didn't actually kill your demon as much as it dealt %100 of it's health in damage to it. So anything you could do to prevent it from taking even 1 up of damage would prevent it from dying and you would still get the DS buff.
---
The official reason it lasted as long as it did was because the wording of demonic sacrifice was basically retain this buff for thirty minutes or until you summon another demon.. Well the reason it was called "a clever use of mechanics" was because you weren't summoning another demon...  You were resurrecting or protecting the one you already had.
---
I'm sure they eventually patched it but I can't recall if it was before or after the patch that added TBC talents or even if it was in TBC proper.
---
All the above I remember clearly. In so far as at least what Tseric had to say about it.
---
I wish we could be intercontinental, got so many friends nowadays that are US
---
Personally I was a vanilla Druid main and was let down at 60 when the class wasn’t what I expected. But in my defense that’s because blizzard totally false advertised the class in the game manual. 
---
That said I did still play druid and have fun raiding ect. I also loved their class armor ect. But when I eventually rolled a priest alt I was constantly shocked by how much easier the game felt.
---
Needed bag space so I deleted my hearthstone because I never used it and it seemed useless. Was lvl 49 questing with a guy when we both dinged 50 and would head back to train and then continue questing when I said I didn't have the full time to run to the fp, fly back, train then fly baxk again. Dude blew my mind when he hearthed in my face
---
Going to be hilarious when people realize dungeon grinding takes longer than questing- good luck with the group / stream though!
---
We are looking into it, an old officer is i BIZZNO
---
I mean that has nothing to with leveling dude. You  should probably know what you are talking about before you make tacky posts like these.
---
Is there another pet that attacks at the same speed as broken tooth? I'm still not clear if he was nerfed entirely. If another cat and broken tooth are the same, then it makes sense to not spawn camp broken tooth for hours.
---
GM ofc, and no funky stats with an TF. god damn druid weapon
---
Lots of german POW's were put in camps. Especially the soviets kept them in camps for years. And the top nazis were put through the Nuremberg trials and lots of them got executed for being complicit in war crimes and genocide.
---
*All* of the adult orcs that survived the second war were complicit in war crimes and genocide. Keeping them in camps was the minimum one could do. Unlike germans, orcs were an entirely different, unknown species that appeared on the planet and immediately started murdering. Nobody knew them before the corruption. There was no reason for humanity to believe that they were even capable of playing nice. And there was also the fact that they were infused with demonblood. Their docileness was actually lethargy coming from the fact that they couldn't murder things. Thrall was a special case who learned his level headedness through personal lessons from humans.
---
And Germany got occupied for the rest of the century. Orcs didn't have a homeland to send back to, or to occupy. Releasing them would mean you would have to give them land. Which, considering how the human race just barely survived a decade of war that left the continent devastated, wasn't an option. Releasing them into human society even less so. And, considering how Warcraft 3 literally starts with orc raids on human settlements, just releasing orcs into the wild wasn't a good idea either.
---
[Here's](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lethargy_of_the_Orcs) a text from vanilla describing the situation back then. There wasn't really a "good" solution for all this.
---
I get paid salary so works for me 😂
---
Being capable of double Shadowbolts is why I loved my warlock so much and was actually dejected because of the changes in Mists of Pandaria. As the caster that did both dots and bolts that separated us from Shadow Priests until we were forced into channeling if you wanted to keep playing the game of spinning plates through Affliction. I genuinely hated Malefic Grasp.  
---
Legion was also questionable in regards to how managing dots was executed. But Drain Soul regained significance! yay! ... kinda. Still channeling with zero room to siege through burst dps.  
---
Shadowbolt, and this new Deathbolt thing, is back in BFA. I won't touch that expansion in a similar fashion to how I avoided Warlords. My only hope is that warlocks don't receive another overhaul before whatever future expansion comes out.
---
*I am a monster..*
---
That's fair, and I learned some stuff there. Touche.
---
Mate just play what you want, I had a friend played Tauren Hunter in Classic and despite Leeway existing back then they had no trouble still kiting fools around. Yes, there's an adjustment period, but that's gonna be the same for anyone coming from retail or pretty much any of the expansions.
---
Learn to play what you want, don't feel pressured to optimise.
---
That intro is riveting
---
Right? Ya can’t waste it! I always make food and water and hand it out right before I log off. It’s fun being useful! 
---
I highly doubt I get server first enchanting but dang that would be amazing!!
---
They'll come if some twink is around killing guys lol
---
Melee cleaves unite!
---
Thanks haha, 3rd time ever even trying to edit a video so its a bit rough
---
I was so useless at professions last go around, so I'm really planning on getting into them this time around. I plan on doing cooking and fishing for sure even though it will slow down my leveling. As for the actual professions, I think I'm going to go tailoring and herbalism while leveling, then switch one of them to engineering when I hit 60 for PVP. It's my understanding that you can't make much gold from engineering, and it's more for personal crafting. I figure, better to pick stuff at the beginning that you can use to build up some gold and then switch over when you're ready.
---
/u/littlesunfish, you don't have Frostadamus on your site.
---
cant wait to create my priest named Thex
---
I posted it above. There may have been a few more methods but those were the easiest.
---
Nah man, I expect my DPS to be 2/3rd of a rogue or warrior's at best, maybe 80% with crowd pummeller and a ton of consumables. I think the reason a lot of people are rolling druid is 3-fold:
---
1. People have found out how much better druids really were than they had a reputation for back in retail vanilla. That doesn't mean they think they will top the meters or whatever metric is being arbitrarily used to determine value, just that the overall package is much stronger than it was ever given credit for.
---
2. As a result of 1. a lot of people never played Druid back in Vanilla. In fact to this day Druid is the only class off the top of my head I've never maxed out during any expansion. This is their opportunity to experience as close to a truly fresh start as they can get.
---
3. Some people like to play the underdog class, if a class is really rare or considered weak it makes the people that do play it and/or can make it work feel special. People like to feel like they're breaking the mold, so why not play the least played class, or make an off-spec work? Even if it's not optimal, it's fun to take on the challenge! Nobody will think twice about a rogue topping meters, but a druid's going to raise some eyebrows if they ever do manage.
---
Im not sure what my end-game spec is going to be yet, as I'll be sticking to a grinding spec for a while to get my gold, reputations, recipes, materials etc. at 60. But if I end up being the raid's meme-spec mascot that the raid leader uses to threaten slackers into contributing, that's fine by me! "If you do less dps than the druid, that's a 50 dkp minus!" xD
---
Depends on what group you're in. If you're in a melee group you'll likely want to cycle windfury totem and agility totem every 7 seconds, because you can maintain both buffs at the same time. 
---
It's really easy once you get used to it.
---
I thought that when you chose the spec as a mage that you could only use fire spells if you were specced into fire. Quickly discovered that it was not the case tho
---
I'm just hoping to get rank 9/10 gear, which seems super daunting
---
When burning crusade came out and I was like... Well all that time I spent getting gear was a waste.
---
At least do some research first cmon man
---
Aww come on, we exist
---
"I go for Teens, I'm just like Blizzzard and the ESRB"
---
Without going into a big argument, why such hate? I don't like Nestle but giving the choice I won't drink toilet water. Just buy a hacked key if you don't want to give them your support. Why makes thing hard on yourself?
---
You all have fun starting on the 27th like a casual scrub, while the rest of us are playing on the 26th.
---
I played orc hunter in vanilla, and there was for sure more tauren and troll hunters by far.  I picked orc because I liked the style... I suggest you do that too.
---
Guess we won't see you in classic then? Have fun in BFA :)
---
So you're saying Shaman is basically a big brain class? I could probably deal with learning and understanding how they work... as long as it doesn't become overly annoying.
---
You are right. The gold reward from quests wasn't that high until you get to level 70. I remember doing all Netherstorm quests gave me about 1k gold and that took a long time
---
The song in the video is from a muppet musical called Avenue Q. It's a pretty hilarious show and I would highly recommend it, especially if your partner enjoys musicals and has a dirty sense of humor.
---
If you want to play tauren, play tauren, but orcs are better yes.
---
Lmfao
---
Respec costs. 
---
I don’t mind needing to respec but the maximum cost is a huge bummer imo. There are certain classes that can get away with doing PvE and PvP in the same spec but others are essentially forced to change if they want to be viable in both.
---
Needing to pay 50g every time you want to swap between raids/dungeons and PvP is obnoxious and can quickly bankrupt your character. If you’re not routinely farming gold you’re absolutely fucked and will not be able to swap between specs. I want there to be a cost, but 50g gets expensive real quick.
---
I really wish there was a system, but not dual spec, to lower the cost of a respec. Either just a flat drop in max price or a system where completing a raid or multiple BGs gives you a discounted respec for “X minutes”.
---
Yeah, numbers are smaller so you can see. 
---
And more items like trinkets have on use, which makes it very interesting for you when to use it.
---
Its literally the opposite of paladins.
---
Instead of waiting around for auto attack procs and your seal, you are constantly moving around, using your GCD's of all sorts of bs.  Tons of fun.
---
Layering my friend.
---
I didn't think about dps ;-)
---
r/iamreallybadass
---
Play what you want. You'll also have war stomp, stomp, clip, run.
---
If Garrosh bombing Theramore is the Horde's fault despite most of the Horde opposing it, then Arthas nearly enslaving the entire world to the Scourge should be considered the Alliance's fault. Don't @ me.
---
Even if they're a level ?? on a mount made of molten gold, you have to pick a fight anyways like the angry PvP chihuahua that you are. It shows them to fear you when they're trying to chat with their guild.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I was always bad at managing dots.  I much preferred just spamming shadowbolts.
---
Feline swiftness and travel form is enough to make player stick around and keep them from rerolling.
---
As for dungeons, bear and healers will have the same response for a group looking for more. "good enough"
---
...because of the massive decline, obviously
---
Why she look like she just farted
---
You can try that earthbind kiting stuff, but imo it's way more work than it's worth.   That's assuming it even woks worth a shit in classic.
---
Don't underestimate stoneskin, especially if you are using a shield.
---
totem management is a bit of a pain.  I didn't bind most of them.  Just not worth it imo.  I mostly only bound reactive totems that I used in pvp.  Grounding totem, searing totem, earthbind, etc..
---
Then that means by proxy...
---
LEGION DID IT!
---
That does seem fun and interactive... kinda the opposite of what I've heard about resto Shamans.
---
Leeroy was a big fat phony!
---
Attacking players above your level is also encouraged. Just no grays. Bonus points if you actually kill them.
---
Basically they want you to pay for a subscription just to reserve your name so you"ll only get 2 weeks playing time out of that sub. Pretty lame if you ask me but the hype is too real to even give a shit
---
I agree. If you put it as green, then people could assume hunter = priest shadow leveling
---
Orcs pretending they aren't literal invaders into these lands :rage:
---
Try out DaVinci Resolve. A youtuber friend recommended it to me and I'm never going back to Vegas again. Just avoid the beta version and get the stable one, I think it's version 15.
---
If you're not sure about learning a new editing software, Resolve has a sort of out-of-the-box setup for each of the major editing softwares so it can copy the hotkey setup from Vegas or Premiere to make the transition easier.
---
I mean... do you *know* this?
---
Find a classic guild of like minded people now and save the headache.
---
I think ppl like alot of half assed things, for various reasons.. It shows in games, movies and music - shit, I'm getting old aren't I?
---
If someone has to use a 60 min CD to best you in a duel, you won.
---
Say what you will about the ratings but these are undeniably adorable
---
This is why I'm rolling nelf
---
Channeling spells get SCREWED when mobs are hitting you.  Since their main spell is a channel, boy howdy does it get really terrible quite often. Combine with no AOE and fear being the worst CC ever when it pulls extra mobs (and you're actually scared of extra mobs) and let me tell you leveling a shadow priest is not fun.  
---
It's worse than Hunter, Mage, and Warlock because OBVIOUSLY.  It's also worse than druids, shaman, or rogues.  It's indisputably better than Warriors, because fuck leveling warrior.  That just leaves Paladin, and boy it's a question between potential kill rate (winner, shadow priest) and ease and ability to deal with bad situations (paladin, you can never die and never kill)
---
The problem with making Classic content come launch, is at that point most players will be PLAYING and not WATCHING. The only streamers/content creators who will excel after release have already built strong communities.
---
But if you’re doing this solely for fun, power to you.
---
Canada is the Europe of North America.
---
Choosing Alliance for pvp is like going to Germany to speak French.
---
Mouse is a better investment than keyboard,  coming from someone who’s had both. Buy a Naga, it’s worth it.
---
Racial have a very low impact on the actual gameplay. Specially PvP. 
---
World PvP is all about attack of opportunity. Who attack first. BGs are about the team your with and who got their  cooldown ready.
---
Get a character you can stand looking at their but for the next two years.
---
yeah they can line up with all the ret/prot pallies and enh/ele shamans eh... 
---
what a shit post, report and move on ppl
---
Super necessary.
---
why is the vid so long.....
---
these fucking noobs gonna get destroyed
---
Cost of living: Food: 80-120. Shower at the gym or gf's place. No job. Former job was retail manager. Reason for termination: Followed a shoplifter to their car and wrote down their license plate. Shoplifter called corporate on me. Corporate acted accordingly. Wasn't homeless during employment. Plenty that worked in retail are homeless living in whatever. Rent is too high to sit 1-2 years on playing WoW with no income.
---
Maybe a dumb question but is there any way to do this not on a computer? I was only able to take a couple days off work for launch completely forgetting about character creation
---
This is missing servers. THere's no Bleeding Hollow or Mug'Thol.
---
Except it's not fucking fun. It was way more enjoyable in tbc where you could raid as elemental or feral.
---
First Aid for all! #Thrall 2019
---
100% you're just jealous
---
Never thought of that!
---
Thats fuckin beautiful
---
Nah you got it bro, 3*5 =~60
---
I’ll sure be watching streamers on my second or third monitor. I just spam frostbolts anyways.
---
Is deep frost really that big of a dps difference from pve frost in MC/BWL?
---
Data centers (Chicago or LA) matter more than time zones
---
I hate mixing politics with my vidja but this was the 1st thing I thought of.
---
Well, most of AQ40 is considered indoors so it makes sense that the scarab mounts wouldn't have that flag. The question is if that carries over to other indoor areas as well.
---
I just wrote this for a similar question 2 second ago.
---
"Racials have a very low impact on the actual gameplay. Specially PvP. 
---
Get a character you can stand looking at their butt for the next two years."

I have been looking for this video for a good while now thanks!!

It is simple. Choose Paladin or Warlock on the Character Selection screen. Enjoy your free mount at 40.
---
What about disk format?  
---
I'm hesitant to move my WoW files to ext volume, is there a performance hit by leaving it on ntfs?
---
That was only when they added achievements. What matters most in classic is getting the rare patterns early. And judging by your disposition you will have no problem!
---
That Angwe chat compilation...I forgot how aggressive the young playerbase was with homophobic language back in vanilla.
---
You're absolutely correct about that. It's part of what makes Druids SO damn fun to level. And shamans too for that matter.
---
That is just perfect. Like a chess match, or, in my head, I imagine like a really good, drawn out ping pong match haha. Really excited to practice like you said. Weird feeling for me. Thanks for this!

I too am a former retail manager, I lost my job because a stray expired can of baby food was on my shelf, (pretty sure my assistant store manager put it there). Regardless, hope you enjoy classic, and land on your feet. 
---
Retail is a bitch but gives us some unique skills and experiences to excel in other industries as well. Good luck out there!

Region:  NA
---
Server:  PvP
---
Faction:  Horde
---
Class:  warlock, resto sham or prot warrior, open to maining any of those 3 for raiding.
---
Raid availability:  930 PM pdt earliest I can start but good to go until 5 AM pdt every day.  Wednesday and thursday my days off normally so earlier on those days work.  My son is in college and currently single so I have nothing but time outside of my work schedule and sleep will be shortened many days also im sure... gotta grind those consumables.  Hardcore oriented gonna be plenty of /played.
---
Looking for:  generally hardcore but not worried about server first downs or anything just not casual.  Late night raiders, I'm located central time zone if that makes any difference just converted my times available to pdt.
---
Experience:  vanilla-wotlk... vanilla only leveled and took a break before bc.  Main resto shammy progressed through sunwell up to muru in bc.  Raided on a mage also but not up to sunwell.  Wotlk played a lot of alts... did raiding on resto sham and mage still and also a dk tank but nowhere near as serious as in bc.  Pvp fun then quit.  Making it to muru at the time was an accomplishment on my server or most servers if I remember right and I held one of the top healing spots, also healed with a friend for za speed runs for the amarni? Warbear mount and were able to get some people their bear...I didn't win a roll for one unfortunately.  Those are a few highlights that stands out in my memory at least.  I'll get good with any class I play... If you have a guild that puts in work later than the average raid time... give me a shout.
---
This is what it’s all about; I know this has been said a million times over for who knows how long, but it merits being said again. We got 8 of us getting back into it, and we couldn’t be more excited!

Are they adding a park to the Outlands?  I don't know where you're getting that from, I was not thinking about parks.
---
Honestly, I have no information in that regard.  My instinct tells me that due to EXT4 being native to windows tells me its likely faster.  But in that regard your talking about load times mostly.  It probably would not create tangible benefits moving from one to the other.  
---
Fortunately, the Gamemode program will function regardless of this when running in Linux.  The best part is it will do this not just for wow, but any game using the tricks listed above.
---
Thanks for letting me know, will keep this in mind!
---
The grind was acceptable because the reward was attainable.
---
It's not hard, just less conviennent. You can't argue that you have less choice of software and compatibility with Linux. I never had a problem finding an open-source alternative in Windows. A Windows key cost 5$ on Amazon. Don't ask me where it comes from but my computer is activated.
---
My question is why the hate. It might be a personal choice but dual booting were always the way to go.
---
This is why I am leveling a rogue on a pvp server.
---
As a Hunter, you don't need to worry about buying a mount at 40. You get Aspect of the Cheetah at 20 which gives 30% speed, and assuming you level as BM you can talent it to 36% by level 21.
---
You're only 4% slower than a regular mount, and changing aspects is instant cast so you don't waste any time mounting up. Sure, the mount is more efficient if you're traveling long distances, but the aspect is sufficient enough that you can wait on the mount.
---
It is better to push to higher levels first (50+) so you can farm the higher level zones for more profit. Frostadamus on Youtube has a good collection of videos for good gold farming spots. Most of these spots give 30-50 gold per hour (more if you can sell some stuff on the AH). So you can easily grind out your entire mount in just 2-3 hours as long as you're high enough level for these spots.
---

Natur enemy castbar. Not sure if it's updated but that's what we used to use.
---
epic mount, pre raid bis gear, find a guild, get your attunements, max out crafts
---
That's a month after hitting max level
---
Played on US Bloodscalp in classic. Most of my time was spent in &lt;The Gang&gt;, &lt;Paradigm Core&gt;, then briefly with &lt;DPS&gt; during Naxx
---
A lot of work but not as bad as it used to be before we knew about farm spots. I farmed yetis for epic drop for 100s of hours and then got a trash epic that sold for 500g.
---
Who are these? Members of some early 2005 guild?
---
I am not even interested in RP-PVP myself but I really am hoping they just have it at launch. I just feel like opening one down the road is asking for communities to split, both from unofficial RP-PVP servers and also those who just decide to settle on a normal RP server.
---
Yes. Getting a new frostbolt rank or a better +sp piece and seeing those higher crits as a mage, deleting mobs, soooo good. I hope I am as lucky with +frost sp pieces while leveling this time around.
---
Totally not surprised to see that. Streamers want to experience that Vanilla feeling again just like most of us. (For some, the game was literally their job and social life.) Getting mobbed by an entourage literally everywhere you go isn't that experience. In fact that is a pretty shitty experience in general.
---
Princess HueHueran
---
A month? No.
---
Meh not rolling horde.  Just not how I remembered it
---
If they disagree with you, they're retail. That's all the reason you need to make them cry. Make sure to tell them you know they're crying.
---
2 days\*
---
Gahh, US sadly, but thanks for the offer! 
---
Guitar hero you say?
---
I level priest all the time on vanilla servers and I tend to view it as almost directly in the middle of leveling speed/efficiency.
---
It's no mage/druid/warlock/hunter but it's also no warrior/rogue. It's pretty close to Shaman, maybe a little better. But Shaman gets ghost wolf.
---
we sell these at my job and i'm tempted to take advantage of my employee discount now.
---
My memory of hitting 60 in vanilla was that not much about the game changed immediately hitting 60. I'd already done UBRS once at 58 (yay being a healer in 2005 that knew how to downrank). It was more of a "one grind down, now to focus on the gear and rep grinds I've already started". It's not as jarring a change as it is on retail.
---
I only commented because I've seen many posts of people talking about doing so.
---
The rogue will wait until you pull a mob to gank you, no matter what racial you have you'll be dead. Running to a dungeon alone and meeting a full group at the door no matter your racial you'll be dead.
---
Having a hunter vs a proper flag runner you'll lose your AV, no matter what racial he chooses.
---
Racial have zero impact on your actual gameplay.

any hybrid not named warrior will not do competitive dps if predictions are correct, they'll be viable but very sub optimal without enough utility to use them in top tier environments
---
Don't be an asshole. We're in a thread about classic's flaws, and the biggest one is how badly balanced it is and as a result how many useless specs there are. You think everyone in this thread isn't interested in classic?

I remember my guild, fractured, and yours battling it out all the way through vanilla to wotlk, until we merged in cata I think it was?

Rag was the dwarves, but still alliance. Hakkar was the trolls tho.
---
Just start spamming 5 mans basically. You'll get tons of upgrades just from anything you run. After a week of 5 mans and most of your gear is decent blues you can think about doing some other misc stuff. Trying to do stuff like bgs or farming gold is going to be way easier once you get out of crappy levelling greens.
---
Straight to pre-raid BiS farming with the other people in my guild who have dinged. Consumable/gold farming, basically just getting ready for raiding.
---
Yeah anything pre-40 shadow does almost nothing different from disc/holy. I'd say Holy is better than Shadow until Sform because Mind Flay isn't even higher DPS than wanding until Shadowform and Darkness. 
---
Shadow gets PvP bonuses that Holy doesn't get but otherwise Holy gets 0.5s off Holy Fire and some mediocre bonuses that are slightly better than Shadows reduced fear timer and useless filler.
---
Yeah this is problem why I am unsure about playing Classic. As someone who has been playing specs like Feral/SV/Enhance/Ele for the last two expansions, the idea of going back to those specs being literally useless for PvE content does not sound enjoyable. I just made a post about this. The terrible class balance is not what made vanilla WoW good. To me there is no harm in making these under represented specs actually viable for PvE/PvP content. If anything it will make the experience that much better because i guarantee there will be a lot of players that don't play or quit because of how awful class balance was.
---
If Blizz came out and said that they wanted to do a balance pass on some of the lesser played specs I would be back in the classic train in a heartbeat. 
---
Classic was great because of the community and sense of progression with your character. I don't believe having more viable specs will take anything from that experience.
---
I had the slightly newer Orange G15.  
---
My password was macroed on the G6 key.
---
Did not know this, thanks for the info.
---
Rogues makes sure to camp escort NPCs.  Only kill 5 seconds before quest completion.
---
And why should you go unpunished for consistently spouting racism in a match? 
---
“Special snowflakes who think that anyone who is mean to them is a bad person are exactly that,  special.”
---
Sounds like you were consistently harassing people, being racist, personally attacking .etc and got muted/banned. Sorry but people should be punished for consistently being a shitty person.
---
Frost Mage, BM hunter, Feral Druid, Aff/Demo lock. Seems accurate to me, haha. The rest can go in neutral and then shitty(tank specs, healer specs)
---
Of some sure, more like envious. The vast majority? No, not even a little bit. I'm a grown man doing my own thing running my own businesses and it's going well. Do I wish I had ninja or asmongold money? Hell ya, but the majority live basic lifes for a bunch of likes and views. No thanks.
---
Personally im on the classic + wagon. I was just being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole.
---
Kinda useless without factoring hit and crit rating.
---
They won't say a goddamn word to anyone
---
and quests arent locked to race right? i can take a tauren warrior to deathknell and pick up warrior quests?
---
Should try FFXIV with her! Community is extremely welcoming and awesome. =)

I NEED MOAR, NHAO!
---
**Pending Guild Name** (really, we're still voting on the name) is a **NA-PVE-Horde** guild preparing to raid in Classic WoW. Our leadership is comprised of veterans who have been raiding since vanilla. We currently plan to raid on Sun/Mon, 8:30 PM - 12:30 EST.
---
We plan on distributing loot either via a hybrid DKP system, or loot council. Regardless of this, main tank loot priority and legendaries will be distributed via loot council. 
---
We are seeking dedicated players who have the drive to clear content on a two raid night schedule. If you wish to apply, please stop by our discord: https://discord.gg/6CYa4At

Maybe 15 years ago it was considered “nerdy” but I think with video games more mainstream nowadays, there’s nothing to worry about. In game I never had any problems either, but was taught early to be respectful in game chat and never lied about my age if someone asked. People were generally nice to me too if that’s a concern as well.
---
Lock ples.
---
It is. For years afterwards I would caution people about how their character would get deleted if they didnt complete the quest or get the debuff cleansed. I made a pally alt as a result so I could purify other so they wouldn't lose their character. Like I said, it took an embarrassingly long amount of time to know better.
---
Yes, love this. Vanilla was always a bit of both that aggression and community. My most memorable experience were definitely those where I chilled with the opposing faction for a bit. Sure if they attack me I might give them a good corpse camping, and sometimes you can't resist finishing off the low-health gnome who is about to die from a mob, but tossing a friendly but cautious /wave at a random alliance as we're both questing in the same spot in Ashenvale knowing a fight could break out at any moment was always a big part of the experience to me.
---
Yeah that sounds about right. Thank you, friend :D
---
It doesn't really make much difference if you're fighting a mob or not. Most classes can grind mobs fine never dipping below 80% hp if they think they might get ganked. Yes sometimes you'll just get way outnumbered or out-levelled, but most of levelling pvp is between solo players of similar level range (because that's how the majority of players level). And in those cases, yes it makes a huge difference what race you are (for some classes at least).
---
holy and disc leveling aren't shit?
---
It creates a great feeling of community when a group allows a member to take a piece of loot which will be greatly beneficial to them.
---
The reasons why this ideal situation may not transpire are widely acknowledged;
---
Finding a valuable world epic is just like winning a  random prize draw with 5 people paying for the ticket. Let’s say you win a new car. Now you can either trade the car for money and split it 5 ways or you give it to the person who doesn’t own a car.
---
In the real world, if you are all friends, you might indeed give the car to your buddy who doesn’t have a car. If the people are strangers you might certainly opt to take the cash.
---
For instance if a member said ‘I don’t have a car I could really use this’ and everyone if everyone agrees. How disturbing would it be to find out they were lying or even if they weren’t but decided to sell the car anyways. It’s a mix of situations like this as well as the difficulty of selling and splitting the gold accountably that gives rise to players preferring a group wide need roll.
---
I think it’s a much better idea to need roll and if you win it and want to be a great community member you can always trade it to the person anyways.
---
yes of course blizzard forgot the game was meant for nerds but now it's just money money money and wankers who would sell their ballhair if it would bring them profits, can help blizzard get more money. so they get special privileges.
---
No, I do belive if they asked blizzard to reserve their names, they would.
---
Why can't you just make that up otherwise in 1-60?
---
We weree still are a guild on EU Bloodscalp, we are making an classic guild. Westarted on 28th of feb 2005 like 5 days in to a guild drama after classic
---
(Mages can’t Make tables until BC) The thing here is its what makes you unique in Vanilla. On retail anyone can hearth every 15 min and port anywhere they need to, along with other teles they have on different CD. Druid forms are all replicated. Summoning stones can summon people. In Vanilla these things mades a class unique

About Us
---
We are a semi-hardcore guild that will be forming in Classic on a North American PvP server! We have a core group that have experience in Vanilla, Organized PvP and Raids.

Goals
---
Our goals include getting everyone who is serious about being apart of our guild geared up with BiS Pre-Raid gear and pushing that raid content constantly progressing

from PvP harassment. We are here to help each other in being the best we can be. The Horde will Revere us and the Alliance will Fear us! Play the way you want to!
---
Raid Schedule
---
Our raid times will be  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday nights. 9pm EST. Tentatively.

---
Loot
---
Our loot will be loot council/dkp. DKP is gained on Raid Boss Kills/ WPvP event attendance and those willing to help with Pre-Raid prep work. Council to ensure

Dude. I really hope some Blizz employes make sure you get the name you called for.
---
Kek
---
Yes i just accounted for the base stats. Might want to include stats like crit, hit, mp5 etc.
---
Good info on the resto shaman, if you find more prios that are off, im happy to hear what needs to be changed.
---
This last one will only be 24 hours.
---
nope. red is dead.
---
Its almost tame compared to what happens on private servers these days. I'm convinced there are some serious mental disabilities going on with some of those people and I hope Blizzard's moderation team can keep a handle on it.
---
HELLO FRACTURED! I remember it like I'm new to this game
---
Druid!
---
Surv should be neutral; hunters don't need talents to level tbh.
---
If we're getting technical, Elves are just mutant Trolls.🤔
---
It is being used as a metric for them to know the number of players interested in playing.
---
Without a physical product to buy they need a way to plan server infrastructure.
---
If there wasn't a cost involved people would be more inclined to reserve names with multiple accounts and skew the numbers.
---
If they don’t reference 04-07 you can assume they’re a retail baby.
---
A mere fortnight and a half
---
That will only be 2hrs of play time on 8th?
---
Honestly....does it really matter?
---
I mean, so what if asmongold/esfand/soda/cdew/etc get their name on reserved on a few servers?
---
Will it impact you or me playing the name? all it will do is prevent them from getting about 5 mins of content as they rage as all their names are "taken".  
---
They provide free (on blizzards end) advertisement for their game. I honestly don't care if blizzard allows the bigger content creators to pre-reserve their names.
---
She is going NE Hunter. I'm not too worried about the min/maxing or perfect synergy ibetween the classes. I am leaning toward Shadow Priest as I had one back in the day and loved it very much and have missed that spec as it used to be. 
---
I think in order am am currently thinking SPriest&gt;CombatRogue&gt;Pally/Mage.

---
Yeah that shit didn’t exist nor was an issue. You wouldn’t say it if they were Chinese, in a Chinese only speaking guild. Gtfo
---
Thanks for the feedback. I might consider adding the secondary stats like hit, crit, mp5 etc. If you find more prios that are off, im happy to hear your thoughts on what needs to be changed. The goal would be to have a complete overview of the stat priorities.
---
Wow, a whole guild of normal looking, not neckbeards, with some of them actually looking fit! 
---
Haha jokes aside it's awesome that you kept in touch for all this time! I personally haven't kept in touch with my vanilla guild, but the guild I joined in TBC is still keeping in touch through discord and other games. Hoping a few join me in classic wow.
---
that's right, and we will go on strike too
---
I finished the game, so I quit I guess.
---
They shouldn't for alt character names, but if they get preferred preference of some sort for their main streamer name that's fine by me.
---
you forgot /violin
---
&gt;Shadow is going to be a lot faster than enhancement 40+. 
---
Damn it, with the first sentence I thought you actually had good advice for once, but you need to qualify this heavily. Soloing in the 50s is hard on enhancement mana, but the 40s enhancement is straight up godly.
---
Yes! This was my first WoW vid experience too!
---
Well only 1/10 people need the key and typically the person making the group has a key so it really wasn't uncommon to just never bother getting it.
---
Include that saving spirit gear and swapping it to save money on food/drinks is beneficial for all classes.
---
its one of those tricks to save gold.
---
I use this monstrosity: https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse.html
---
12 side buttons easily accessible with your thumb. 2 more buttons below the mouse wheel. The mouse wheel itself can hand 3 binds (scroll up, scroll down, click). There's also a 3rd mouse button on the far right side.
---
In total, that's 18 binds on just the mouse alone. Which you can triple to 54 by using SHIFT and ALT. And again, this is just for the mouse, you can have even more binds on your keyboard.
---
I first bought one of these things back in 2012. Been using one ever since. In fact, I just ordered my 4th one a few days ago, since my current one is starting to fail (they do tend to crap out after 2-3 years of hard use). Luckily I found a deal on Amazon for $24. Last time I bought one it was $60 lol.
---
Idk if it's even in retail anymore but that priest ability that lets you put feathers on the ground for a movement speed boost.
---
They'll probably log in quicker than most - that's where streamers get their benefits - on launch night they'll be leveling while most try to connect.
---
It lacks some important stats (hit cap / defense cap / spell power / crit...)
---
On the other hand, you did include a few stats that are borderline useless. For instance, spirit for warlocks is pretty much insignificant (I'd rather have +4spellpower than +40spirit). It feels like you forced yourself to include 3 stats for every single class, which is not necessarily pertinent.
---
They are already reserved for them. Probably under a non disclosure agreement about it.
---
No AOE loot.
---
Because most guilds don't really have the choice of taking out a fully optimized raid of 40 people?  You get 6 locks and 2 shadow priests and make that shit work.
---
when did this 10 man ubrs stuff start?  we 5 manned it after the change back in vanilla.
---
So was I.
---
&gt; So essentially the gap between your melee range and your bow range is much smaller than other hunter classes, effectively shrinking your deadzone
---
Nah this has been proven false on the Beta, the deadzone is the same size but just in a different location (melee range is indeed longer but max shooting range is longer by the same number).
---
I have always felt WotLK started the implementation of systems that ended up destroying server identity and community along with the beginning of aoe spam 5 mans. 
---
Cata started to hurt class uniqueness and the general shift from classes to specs along with changing the world and questing for the worse. 
---
*Of course this is only my opinion as a player subbed for most of the time since 2005.
---
This guy is a future star of r/gatekeeping
---
Shit, I feel this every time I do any type of dungeon. Private server OR retail.
---
Okay, thanks for the feedback i will change it accordingly.
---
I am legitimately curious what elements of having streamers on the server you find most intolerable. I will endeavor to avoid escalating any such issues myself, so everybody can have a better experience.

---
Yeah sure, blizzard allows them to connect with their servers before anyone else and flags their account as priority so they can skip queue times.
---
Can't have their advertisers sitting in a line.
---
The survey shows locks being the most popular choice for horde and lower end for alliance. I found that odd. The flip side is that 90% of those will suck.

MMO-champion is a shadow of its former glory,  and its mostly just trolls lingering around out of habit. the # of message posts there is a small % of what used to happen. 8.2 patch reveals get maybe 50 comments...used to be threads would start over after 1000+ posts.

Exiled [H] | NA (EST) - PVP | Wed/Fri/Sun 6-9:30 | Semi-hardcore | Loot council EPGP hybrid w/ decay + minimum
---
ABOUT US:
---
We are a mature group of men and women. Many of our members are returning seasoned WoW veterans, some experienced through AQ40 + Naxx in original vanilla, some through raids of the latter expansions, others were high rated RBG + arena junkies. Some people are new. Our top 45-50 players will be our core progression group. We will then start building our second 40 man raid. At the moment, we have 60 confirmed members (not all of these players wish to raid with the core progression group - we still have room). Though we are a semi-hardcore guild, we aim to be one of the best on our server, keeping up with guilds that consider themselves "hardcore" and maintaining an active world presence. People will know exactly who we are.
---
We are a Raid first, PVP second guild, though have a very strong emphasis on PVP. We WILL be leading BG premades and world PVP raids on Alliance towns. We will create, join, or support our server's honor-cartel for those that are interested in PVP-only, once the honor system is introduced. You will find us dueling outside of Orgrimmar. We are looking for challengers. Bring your A-game :)
---
LOOT:
---
We will be using an EPGP/Loot Council hybrid with a minimum point requirement to obtain loot, along with a point-decay. Loot Council gets final say over gear distribution, though EPGP scores are heavily weighted. A random raid member will join Loot Council for the night by /rolling 1-40 at the start of every raid for that night only. 
---

I would say you ate better off going to the Warrior discord than this subreddit for min/max premade pvp questions. This sub tends to always give the advise of do what your heart tells you. Butterflies and rainbows and the like.

This post makes me think of this song https://youtu.be/UBM70-JxLOY
---
There was wow-heroes back during BC, maybe it existed during Vanilla, I can't remember
---
I used the hate PVP but my friend played it so I joined with him. Nothing like the rush of getting ganked or getting stronger so you can gank. It's a lovely high!
---
&gt; (yay being a healer in 2005 that knew how to downrank)
---
downrank only works when you have +healing gear.  In early vanilla that was quite rare.
---
This is amazing, thank you
---
I was actually planning on doing this since announcement, but early this year when info finally started to come out I caved.
---
cause i got lazy and wanted to move on. Might change the icon next time :P (just the first iteration)
---
What? Are you okay?
---
\&gt;max shooting range is longer by the same number
---
Seems like this makes Tauren a great choice for group PvP where you have more peels from other people and can shoot from further.
---
yeah, because there's no attempt to understand the situation, that's the whole point of it
---
the humans also enslaved the Orcs, they had their own powerful leaders corrupted and endangered themselves twice, but can't see past the Orcs corruption
---
the whole history of war craft is a mess and the Orcs have been enslaved by at least 3 factions, the ogres, the demons and the humans

Well, if my recollection of lore is correct....the centaurs were the offspring of Azeroth’s own centerfold babe-Princess Theradras and Cenarius’ first born....a somewhat illicit affair as I recall. As an alliance player, I do not feel obliged to make defense of the centaurs and their actions.
---
What are you guys thinking about a small website where people could get some basic information about each class at a glance (in the style of this picture but a bit advanced). Maybe some tricks and items that are useful for a particular class/specc. Would that be cool or is there already something similiar i don't know about?
---
&gt; up there with mage hunter or warlock.
---
mage isn't "with" hunter or warlock, it is far behind, at least on a fresh server which is what we're dealing with here.
---
I love these. But as a priest main I've gotta say shadow for leveling here. But please don't take that as a slight. This is so good
---
I feel like it was 15 man at some point and got changed to a 10 man after the first year.
---
Lot of people point out I’m crazy, but I remember 15 man UBRS.
---
&gt; 60 Mount quest you go to the back of an extremely deep cave in Felwood I didn’t even know existed and speak with a Dread Lord

Totally forgot about that. Been intending on going Warrior this whole time but I loved my Warlock in Vanilla. I just can't stand casters in games nowadays; I blame Dark Souls.

---
That's really cool. When did blizzard announce this streamer initiative? I'd love to see the official announcement.
---
Not directly. Monthly active users (MAUs) are a measure of someone who logs onto a blizzard game on a device per month. For example, I play WoW and Hearthstone. I play Hearthstone both on my PC and my phone (I have downtime at work sometimes). So I would count as 3 users, 1 for WoW, 1 for HS on PC bad 1 for HS on mobile. 
---
Now, as of right now, blizzard has NO major releases lined up for Aug/Sep other than Classic. As far as I’m aware WC 3 reforged hasn’t been given a release date, wows next patch cycle likely won’t come around until near October, nothing is coming out. So, Blizzards MAUs shouldn’t see any major change except for NEW people coming into playing classic wow. 
---
Therefore you could attribute any major gain of MAUs as people returning to play classic as opposed to another blizzard game. There would be no way to tell the people that were previously playing retail and switched so solely classic, but you would be able to see the estimated number of new people coming back for classic.
---
Ahh, Okey maybe I got that wrong then, well dosent matter too much I guess..
---
it was.  strat and scholo were 10 mans iirc, and then there was a patch that lowered them to 10 for ubrs, and 5 for strat and scholo.
---
IMJUSTFINEWHYDOYOUASK
---
It's way more if you use ESDF to move.
---
What will his/her name be?
---
😂 upvote sir
---
Jesus you could have just deleted your post if you felt foolish friend, idk what the fuck this is.
---
Same deal. I’m going to wait until 23rd or 24th and keep an eye out for streamer realms. Names don’t really matter. In vanilla/tbc I’d spam the random name button until something sounded cool anyways.
---
😂😂😂
---
Mage
---
Math checks out!
---
These are amazing, they’re by far my favorite kinda of posts on this sub
---
Man I couldn’t make it more than 2 minutes. I dunno if it’s because I’m on mobile in bed, but the zooming/panning was way way too much. Otherwise I’d have really loved to finish the video.
---
Gues you are US, hope your not. Othwerwise come and join
---
I just find it cringey and self important in the first place.  Like what kind of narcissist thinks somebody wants to watch them kill boars in WoW?  
---
But that aside, getting buttmad over stream sniping (chose a pvp server at your own risk), annoying followers who harass anyone that interacts with the streamers, and popular ones can really wreck a servers economy and culturally by massively increasing the population followed by a dip when they leave just to name a few issues.
---
But like I said mostly I just plain don't like streamers. Oldman Dr_thrill shakes his cane at you streamers!
---
WHOOSH
---
I have great news for you!  No one asked you to join... you will not have to experience it.  :)
---
There are quite a few good grinding spots in pure alliance territory. There are also places like Dustwallow marsh which, due to the presence of an alliance continental boat, tend to have a lot of alliance players in them.
---
It's ok to level outside of Redridge mountains.
---
The open world :)
---
oh yeah we killed them all off that was great.  It really prevented anything evil from occurring in that area.  Nothing there exists anymore not even a dungeon with 2 parts.
---
I believe you have to make a joke first to whoosh someone
---
Guess you are US, hope you are EU and can join(or have weird US hours at work)
---
Wow man, bad day?
---
So what you're saying is "PAUSE You need to give me some signal you're not serious, or this starts to count as bullying"?
---
This is amazing! Glad you have friends that stayed together for so long!
---
&gt; LK is when WOW outgrew itself and started pandering to the “it’s to hard” people.
---
Heroics weren't heroic in LK, I'll give you that. But LK was the first expansion they introduced hard modes, which I think were especially well executed in Sartharion and Ulduar, but also in the ways you had to change up fights for the Shadowmourne quest, or for achievements, which were also new in LK.
---
LK certainly lowered the barrier to entry, but it's irresponsible to ignore the fact that it also pushed the upper bounds just as much, if not more. 
---
WoW is so much more than just "is this 5 man dungeon difficult?".
---
Think it's more the theme (armored knight wielding magic and smacking shit in the face). Gameplay wise I've seen alot of videos but ofcourse you can make any class/spec look fun with enough footage and editing
---
Someone got mad at me because I opened on them when they were in stealth in a duel. Apparently stealthies are granted the opener, ALWAYS.
---
Yeah no I just checked your comment history. Lots of attacks. It’s no wonder you got a punishment in league and are so salty toward Lyte and anyone who agrees to him.
---
If I were so desperate for more buttons I'd just use one of the those ['mmo mouse'](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Scimitar-Optical-Programmable-Buttons/dp/B01MU3DZYN) that have the 1-12 numpad buttons on the thumb grip. 
---
Taking hand off the keyboard to hit lightboard of unlabeled keys just looks like more work than necessary.
---
Yup.  I mained a Druid in original vanilla.  Loved it.  But every basement dwelling tryhard with a Youtube is rolling dps/OT Druid.  You can see it in guild rosters already, druids are out numbering warriors 2 to 1!
---
So I'm rolling Hunter and Mage.  They are definitely the tarnished pennies in this circus.

I especially like Fuktig
---
Yeah thats my primary concern. I have some friends who are playing but not enough to let me run something sub optimal just because I like the style of the spec over something else lol
---
anyone using world buff stacking should just stay on the pirated realms.
---
*laughs in undead rogue*
---
&gt;Yeah I'm with you on this one. I liked the Diablo 2 system where your character WAS your spec. It wouldn't work in WoW where it takes 250 hours to level up a new character, but I think the pricey respecs in Vanilla were a good compromise already.
---
Finally someone understands the purpose of specializations.

---
Sure bud.  1-800-835-2362
---
There's a spec that let you heal and still be very strong dps.
---
You people scare me.
---
PI spec is a thing
---
the frostwolf clan didn't do it
---
Dude Spoilers
---
Rogue
---
ZG Bats and BT are the only 1.0 AS pets.
---
This has got to be a troll right?  Please be toxic and camp??
---
Even one is surprising. I always just assumed the husband and wife duos were just one really talented dude with a voice changer who could tank and heal on dual screens.
---
Disc is fine, Power Infusion offers a lot of power to a DPS Caster of your choosing, and you don't really give up a lot of Holy Talents for it. I imagine it'll be a lot more popular on Classic than it was back in the day.
---
It's also extremely good for PvP, especially if you have a caster buddy.
---
they should also not be greedy and play with magical Wells and grab the legions attention
---
Shatt is the past tense version of shitt.  Checks out.
---
Seriously call the number
---
I hope your guild will consider joining the rest of us in 2019 and implement some effective diversity and inclusion policies as part of your recruitment process.
---
they are literally reseduced the second the shadow bolt hits they can't hit the succubus in that time.  You just recast seduce while the shadowbolt is about to land..
---
Warlock, please.
---
I do enjoy the BFA healing totem. It would be broken in Classic, but it felt more effective.
---
Yes, this is exactly the reason. One of the old creators confirmed this in a Q&amp;A on here in the past.
---
&gt; You can't prevent that 
---
FFXI says hi.  At least before they started trying to mimic WoW.
---
This video should have been shared months ago (it's possible I've missed it).  It's filled with examples of spell batching and melee leeway.
---
Watch anime while leveling.
---
That's exactly what they do and that's exactly why so many people hate them.
---
I'm honored to be in the presence of such greatness.  The internet can barely contain the magnitude of your awesomeness. If you actually flexed it might just explode.
---
Ofcourse, if you are tanking like a snail when the DPS and healers are doing great and the run is going to take double the amount of time it needs to, you'll have pushy players
---
the darkspear were attacked by humans before Thrall saved them from said humans
---
I'd argue that there is more interested in RP-PvP than regular RP.
---
Orc warrior! Same name and all
---
You might be right. I tried to make the bass line the drum line, since there is a large bass drum in the background. That being said, I am still learning how this works. I hope to get better with time.
---
Using Freezing Trap in combat
---
Also fire warlock rotation from TBC
---
I believe there is a talent that buffs the priest spirit buff but it is far enough down that you cant go 31 holy and still reach it. The extra spirit can be very valuable if you have enough casters.
---
Ok I'll bite. What'd FFXI do?
---
Achievements gave people a reason to see the old content. There was even a Leeroy event where you had to kill something like 40 UBRS whelps in a certain amount of time. I proudly had that achievement.
---
they were attacked by humans, kul tirans that were chasing Orcs
---
SERIOUSLY WHOOSH
---
Shadow w/ spirit tap and wand spec and bis wand is one of the easiest and while it's debatable I'll say the easiest to level with the pw: shield and healing, and all sorts of outs.
---
Mobility isn't the greatest but you can grind non stop without ever resting often taking 2 mobs on again without resting, ding 40 and immediately get a mount if done right.
---
I've leveled locks and mages fwiw.
---
Also in raids, if you are the one shadow priest your guild allows for, you're essentially an entirely different class, not a sub spec. You get pvp all you want and you're in the raid and can pop an additional heal if needed. 
---
One of the most efficient and versatile classes. You wont top DPS meters but you're buffing the locks and melting faces in wpvp and BGs in between raid nights and always have a spot in 5 mans b/c you can heal or dps.
---
Oh man, I forgot about that. I agree with you, I think the signature ability at level 10 was a great idea, but it could have been pulled off without completely re-structuring entire classes.
---
Priests like mage water. PI is a good way to make mage friends. 
---
I probably won’t switch to holy til tier 2.
---
was a good laugh for sure
---
You sound like a really fun person xD Honestly! I wish I was on EU too so I could join the guild and come to this barbecue and maybe get a guided tour :D
---
Prepaid bis farming.    Then epic mount Farm.   The  raid log status achieved,  roll alt.
---
I’m sorry but, you’re entirely off base here. Classic it takes a load of effort to form a group. It takes effort to clear. Mobs aren’t a given, and generally if you aggro another group well shit happens. I can tell you didn’t play during vanilla, which is fine, but dungeons were 1-3 hour affairs back then, and nobody wanted to disband because of one wipe.
---
You are very welcome to join, I'd love to have people from completely other time zones to join. We are very European based but I'm forcing everyone to speak English. If it makes your raid times (eventually, we have not decided on days and times everyone needs to get 60 first is main objective :p ) I'm much more than happy to have you with me. We will BBQ next summer and come by Scandinavia by then if you wanna. 
---
Sincerly, 
---
Maedsigil
---
Agility is slightly better than STR for Tanking on Warrior.
---
Okay man.  But honestly I do hope you’re doing okay.  If you have any more problems just seek someone.  Don’t worry I’ll let you have the last word after this post go ahead.
---
You gain some places and lose others. The main difference is if you want a spec that goes down the tree or one that doesn't. Holy has a very bad final talent and while PI is a little situational, it's still more useful than lightwell.
---
Aww tits, you're right, dunno if US based players will be able to join.
---
Thanks man! I'll join and hopefully I can join yall
---
your post is more pathetic than the mythical people that you speak of
---
O o g a G a n g Z h I t
---
Not common.  Would you be doing this to pvp and pve on the same class?
---
Druid next!!
---
So....just that we’re all clear.....in your example “Mexicans” are the equivalent to the orcish race—  the orcish race that laid siege and genocide to a world in which they literally didn’t exist previously that is apart from the one on which they originally inhabite.... world in which they would be literal warmongering space aliens???!😂....Bold move sir. bold move indeed! 
---
Also, yeah, I think.... we.....agree...?????? that it was uncool for the nazi’s to barge into Poland and levy any complaint against Polish life and problems. You’re making my point dude. Sit down and think before you mindlessly invoke “nazi” correlations that don’t exist. It’s just....lazy
---
it saves you 12 seconds every time baby.
---
well with one major difference. the crusade gets deceived while the horde follows knowing- and willingly
---
Is this for leveling, or max level? I assume PvE?  
---
Anyway it doesn't make a ton of sense to choose your gear based on the base stats it has since since hit, crit, spell damage, spell crit, spell hit, mp5 or bonus healing depending on class are usually much more important.
---
&gt;If you see a retail player, thank them for buying all the mounts and toys and shit off the cash shop to fund Classic. 
---
LMAO
---
if you have a better class to put in their place sure, but dead weight depends on your goals.
---
I am also very interested in this. Could they be on YouTube or SoundCloud?
---
Let me tell you the story of Faide. He had an really heavy accent from really northern part of Sweden, everyone just assumed he was scrawny and malnourished and lived in the cold. He was a big guy like 180 pounds and like 5"5' adopted from Peru. That put a gear into our minds. Surreal experience but it he was as chill as a winter night and I still love him today.
---
The rest of the world works a little bit different about diversity.
---
We will only consider your Night Elf females...ONLY THE FEMALES!  You can't fool us, twice!
---
First thing I do is make a bind for /spit, /slap and /laugh. Universal language.
---
name a dungeon where a taunt miss results in real problems if the group is average, I can't think of one.
---
The pvp server is at 192.168.0.1
---
There’s an etcetera. So no I literally didn’t. As I said it was a pick your choice. Which you keep getting hung up over and avoiding the actual argument. Also it’s not really an assumption when I find about 10 personal attacks by you against people in like 10 seconds of looking at your post history. I could undoubtably find more if I kept looking.
---
Okay. So we demonized people who treat other people like shit consistently, say racist or homophobic shit and think it’s okay.
---
So what? If your gonna act like a twat don’t be surprised when people call you out on your attitude.
---
Druids have such a variety of abilities to fit so many situations. I feel I couldn't even tell someone how to play a druid, you just kind of feel it out with all your forms.
---
because the orcs didn't dip right back into demon blood when they got the chance. Oh wait that's the story of the orc campaign in WCIII
---
isn't there a mistake between pal heal and pal tank?
---
I'll be blunt: Angwe is not even a close match for our effervescent majesty sir Gordo.
---
Headline December 2019 (wherever this photo is taken): Divorce rate skyrockets, leaves community baffled.
---
Yes they are *fun*. Not saying they're the most difficult class out there, but they're not the easiest class to play either. It takes a lot of skill and practice to figure out how to utilize your forms.
---
Technically those were the Highborn. The Night Elves were a splinter culture of the Highborn that formed after the sundering and repelled the Burning Legion the first time. (Bonus points, the Highborn are part of the Horde now, but who really cares about BFA lore).
---
Most definitely used down ranks as an ele sham in TBC.
---
Angwe....such a great story. That is definitely where i would roll.
---
Well met.
---
We dont have diversity like a country that have lived on immigrants for 400 years. If someone looked at Finland and told me about diversity. Awakening
---
100% chance he's an undead rogue.

Fucking nerds... I love it :)
---
Yeah true, my b.
---
That "Ugh!" right when they get launched...there's a feeling for that.
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER
---
Yeah it's basically 3 hours 2 days a week for most people, other than that you can be a balance druid or an elemental shaman all you want.
---
Koality post right here
---
It's a terrible fucking idea.
---
It would just say "seal of command + right click"
---
Not classic - was collectors and I belive October
---
Dishonorable kills.
---
I was thinking it said more about WoW than anything lol 
---
I don't really know anything about the demographic of Sweden through. Here is be like damn, look at all the white people! You usually don't see a room filled one way or another. Just the way it is, which makes it interesting.
---
Great clip =D

Wasn’t it 30k a few days ago?
---
you give up like 100 damage/healing for it.
---
How many rp/rp-pvp servers there is on retail.
---
soulstones didnt make me feel special, just over encumbered.  
---
Other than that nice post!
---

---
What did the gnomes ever do that was wrong?!
---
Holy has some talents that are better early on.  The problem is those talents don’t scale well.  Spiritual healing is an increased 10% to your base spells and doesn’t scale with gear so it quickly loses value.  Spiritual guidance gives you damage and healing based off of your spirit which is ok early on but again quickly loses value as your stacking plus healing gear.  
---
Another factor is that the vanilla content isn’t particularly difficult and having your priests dropping PI on your caster dps just helps clear things faster.
---
Two ridiculous things early on. I was grouped with someone for some early quest, and could not figure it how to leave group for the life of me when he logged off without leaving the group. I tried all of the /partyquit commands I could think of. I ended up deleting the character because of it.
---
Slightly later, I had no idea what stats really were, or that they had use only for particular classes. A friend told me "green is better than white, blue is better than green, purple is best". So when blues dropped in WC I needed on an agility cloak and a dagger for my warlock. Luckily everyone else was so noob too that I guess they didn't really know either because I won the cloak and they congratulated me.
---
I was also extremely confused why a hyena in barrens dropped a weapon. Made absolutely no sense.
---
Marked for Death. It was always really fun to play sub rogue as this ultra explosive damage burst from target to target.
---
I do, all of those infinitely entertaining than watching some douchebag play video games.
---
At that point the deep holy talents are worth even less due to how they scale.
---
Just make an NA account and sub there
---
? Not classic what do you mean?
---
My best friend found a GF for 8 years through our guild. Small talks for some motnhs and they were GF/BF and moved 800km and were together for 7 years
---
Eh you might need a second one for all the totems
---
Reading MMO Champion threads about Classic makes me angry and sad. They are just a bunch of bitter shitheads who absolutely hate Classic for no good reason, it's really pathetic.
---
are druids really that much better than rogues? Doesn't first aid make up most of the difference?
---
I would say recommend Bitwarden over Lastpass. It is open source and just a better product IMO.

Leave it to classicwow to downvote a well written guide intended to help somebody. I'd never heard about gamemode before, never seen it mention before so thanks for this, your post helped me at least.

Where’s yours? Mines riot and personal experience of me an my friends. But you hand wave away riot and talk out of your own ass.
---
Also nothing of substance lol.
---
How about you answer the damn question.
---
Why should people who consistently act like Shitty human beings towards others not be punished?
---
My husband and I met in the MoP expansion (married 3 years now, dated 6 years now). We both played since vanilla, so we're excited to experience it together!
---
Do rogues dominate mages in vanilla? I was newb 50 tauren when BC came out so idk.
---
I mean, I don't mind if you cast lay on hands, so long as you rematch me right away.
---
Everyone has already said, but for pretty much all classes and specs, the other stats are more important.
---
Spell Power, Mp5, Crit (both spell and physical), and especially Hit
---
I like the idea though, you just need a second version ;)
---
I will definitely gank them and /spit and /lol
---
Don't forget some fiber.
---
Basically begin gathering pre-raid bis in dungeons+gold farming for epic mount
---
I know of one that I’m in.  It’s called Traffic, they built a website for it, trafficguild.us
---
No 15 agility listed for phase 1, so the wpn enchant is just something for a nice cheap glow.  
---
This is a different style of hunter build where you don't use aimed shot.  Instead you are spamming AS and MS.  You rely mostly on aspect of the hawk and autoshot dmg, which you increase via berserking, rapid fire.
---
To all hunters:

---
These are great! Very helpful too.
---
Elemental can outplay any caster by miles.
---
Cross realm BGs
---
I might be in the minority here but it was always more fun to build rivalries with people on your own server via the BGs. I would gladly accept longer queues for it.
---
I spent most of my gold on E-whores in the Goldshire Inn.
---
Ye sry about being a little bit on point but since my nickname for the last 20 years have been Trolle(long time since trolling came in general), I've gotten a lot of flack. Dunno about MMO culture, I feel it's been quite diverse.
---
I loved casting it on mages right before they finished casting pyroblast and forcing them to pull agro
---
Yeah, but a hunter won't get server first 60 Druid.
---
&gt; Same applies to other US time zones
---
Not Arizona time!
---
Also druids can moonfire and then travel form away back to the start of the escort, or kill him. It's incredibly hard to prevent this from happening
---
Well the Horde was deceived at first.
---
Omnibar.  I'm pretty sure they got a classic version.
---
Comparing classic grind to live is like comparing reading lord of the rings for doing your tax managements.
---
Orc 100000%
---
My favourite place to do this is to the horde just south of ratchet to the elf guy they have to escort through the pirates. You gank him seconds before he enters ratchet.
---
You become a /spit and /applaud magnet haha.
---
Bonus points if they attack you and you get the goblin guards to kill them.
---
So, not a lot then.
---
thanks i see one realm name already called Linksys. the others do not appear to be up yet.
---
My cousin introduced WoW to his gf  then they both joined a new guild and lets say about 9 month laters she was moving across the state to move in with the guild leader. lmfao
---
Hey man sounds great to me.  I'm planning on running a dwarf priest and I've been looking for a guild that runs a couple raids nights during the week starting around 8pm.  I'm an old vanilla vet (used to MT everything up to Nef in BWL) but I want to try healing this time around.  I don't have the time to no life it but I definitely can raid a few times a week and progress through content.
---
Unless it's your *thing* - like ganking everyone in a low level zone - nah man, just leave them be.
---
mage invis
---
I'd love to see either Rogue or Mage
---
I mean Azeroth wouldn't have had any of these problems in the first place if the Orcs didn't decide to listen or obey to the guy who looked like satan and told them to drink the blood that looked like glowstick fluid.
---
&gt;	and your group isn’t filled with idiots.
---
Uh oh
---
Vanilla warrior here.
---
I wouldn't miss a thing.

---
I think myself and our group of players might be interested in this. Keeps us posted
---
Disc is the best for PVP healing.  It offers a lot of tools to help keep you cloth ass alive.
---
I think it's more distorted of 13 years of saving and saving that image ;(
---
What was the original post?
---
Even after all the talk about spell batching, every raid is going to be filled with the sound of rogues clicking 50 times per ability
---
They report overall MAUs. They don’t report wow sub numbers anymore. If that’s what you mean, you are correct.
---
Ds/ruin for raiding.
---
Your neckbeard is showing.
---
I never said I hated streamers though
---
Yeah, forget the big streamers and their perks.  Now those small streamers... give them all the perks.  No bias at all =P
---
Gotcha.  I didn't know they reported anything so that's news to me.
---
I recently played warrior on a private server and had this experience: 
---
Mages generally drink between each fight or every other fight while the group continues on a few paces to the next pack. By the time the warrior has threat built up, they have enough mana to attack. Usually this means you never have to account for the mage. Locks are sort of the same if a mage gave them water, and they also have life tap, which relies on the healer's mana essentially.
---
It's the mages and warlocks job to have mana till the healer needs mana because they have abilities to facilitate this. (free water, lifetap, evocation, mana crystal(the last two are oh shit buttons but still))  
---
One last point I can make is that locks don't really do the best dps in an instance anyways, so slowing down for them is just wasting time.(They're more than likely last or second to last dps on the meters(in instances anyways)) They'll catch up to the party when they can.
---
Terrible, your all terrible. But I love you
---
Yeah, you'll find spots.
---
Yeah, you need to do twice the work for 60% of the damage. 
---
Yeah, full DPS classes and heal specs of your class will usually be invited first.
---
Temporarily. Anyway you can expect at least -50% player count after 3 months for sure.
---
I'm gonna raid as shadow priest (and maybe balance hybrid druid if classic lasts long enough) and you can't stop me
---
Idk, more stories deserve more grey area, especially with a Titan who used to be good. His reasoning at first was grey but I think he ultimately was corrupting into just destroying all planets. Idk I liked Chronicles, they were bland but tied everything together decently.
---
This post is cancer. I love it
---
Don’t forget the /rude
---
pve or go home
---
Would anyone in EST guilds like to choose a server together in hopes of making it high pop?
---
SwD ( shadow word death ) and vampiric touch :(
---
Reasons why I love classic. A class dedicated to a real support role at the sacrifice of other areas of gameplay. Back when MMOs weren't afraid to throw classes into class specific roles.
---
When tons of people talk about druid population and raiding feral or boomkin, or even resto its good to point out the realities of each of these. Same with hunters, 2-3 per raid (more room in mc and bwl. 
---
The narrative of if you are a priest there is room is spread widely but for HORDE priests will be in oversupply.  
---
By the numbers that is 6 priests per raid, Horde do not want even 5 let alone 4 Priests. I mean maybe they will take them, maybe you'll have 4 boomkins in your raid. But on what YOU want there is double the priest population as ideal demand. 
---
Sure some raids will take a priest instead of a shaman, but after some time you'll find them also just taking Enh Shamans instead.
---
Druid has two taunts single and aoe.. smothered that
---
In the latest Countdown to Classic podcast they had a section on how to convince your significant other to play WoW classic with you. It might be an interesting listen for you.
---
I played a hunter as my first character. I would spam all my abilities on cool down to kill things so I thought “wow I need more mana to use more abilities to kill things faster!”   .... so I stacked myself with stamina/intel greens because I didn’t even know what agility did. I think I had more mana than health at some point. Obviously I did no damage because I had no agility which is why it took so much mana to kill things..... it was a vicious and monumentally stupid cycle. I somehow leveled to 40 like this before some gracious soul saved me.
---
They just announced the specs the other day. Check the official forum or scroll down a couple of days here in Reddit
---
Healer's mana is the gas gauge, that's all tanks need to know.
---
Low mana? don't pull
---
High mana consistently? pull more
---
Drinking for mana but above 50%? pull. by the time you're low they'll be near 100% .
---
yeah this sucks tbh
---
If you can't / don't deal with corpse camping, are you even playing wow?
---
drakedog 7 still one of my fav's
---
I'd ideally like to keep this thread alive until server names are released and we can all make the choice together
---
You can try.
---
Disc is the best pve spec unless your guild struggles. Priests excel at leveling with wands. Shadow leveling is exceptionally good. Maybe not hunter or warlock tier but pretty close.
---
I made a thread but I didn't know if someone was already leading this
---
The class it would help the most is Hunter, that 8 set t2 piece bonus is usually not allowed in more serious raiding environments and serpent sting provides a decent amount of bonus dps. I think there was another ability they had that took up another debuff slot but I can't recall what it is. Bringing 1 spriest might be considered more often as well.
---
Holy shit mate ... Check out stormzy druid on youtube. I think that will answer your question
---
Are you upset that asmongold is gonna take your name?
---
Yup, I miss this. Friends find a new game, I ask “Can I be healer?” Response is “yeah! Everyone has a heal” or “yeah! but you deal damage most of the time”. I miss supporting the team with buffs or debuffs.
---
I use clique for all heals , 1-6 e,q + ctrl/alt/shift for the rest. Shaman doesn’t downrank that much. You’ll use rank 1 chain heal and rank 4 wave most of the time.
---
It is an every mans genre, because everyone can actually(as long as you have the device) get into subgroups of a guild. Nowadays its gonna be "The MEMER (hothead), The oldie or kid, or you gonna be the fucking talented elitist and all. I love it. But when it comes to demographics in a computer game. I dunno. We have had black people sitting and doing their shit, and white people doing their shit buyt in Sweden it's not as diverse.
---
Man I had forgotten this wasn’t always a thing. So fun to let another one fly after your bolt ends cast and the GCD is also done.
---
Hahahaha love this.
---
 [https://www.toxicgaming.us/](https://www.toxicgaming.us/)   like this?
---
You have no data on that. You're pulling that opinion out of your ass.
---
Go home, carebear.
---
Hahahaha
---
Only sociopaths could get any level of enjoyment from killing someone in an unfair manner.
---
That's a good point. Then it's DS/Ruin I guess.
---
&gt; A change to the newly added Soul Link Talent. I guess someone could dispel it off either the warlock or the pet, but the buff would stay on the other and continue to provide benefit. A good change.
---
Patch 1.8 - Soul Link was dispellable if the pet was the target of the dispell. This dispelled Soul Link all together.
---
Patch 1.9 - The wording means that Soul Link was no longer partially dispellable because that is what it was in patch 1.8. It could be dispelled through the pet but not the warlock (partial dispell). In Patch 1.9 it become completely immune to dispell regardless of warlock or pet target.
---
In all seriousness some of my fondest memories were when I had to resort to hiding behind the big jungle trees in STV from spooky high level alliance players after they had killed my ass multiple times. It was hair wrenching, tilting, and a pain in the ass, but god I loved it.
---
30 day reservation only works on toons above level 10, I recently gave a friend a name I had held on a 1, but had to wait 30 days when I transfered a toon to another account
---
I'm not into mages. Hopefully, you convince a lot of people to get off Warlock and your class can be even more overpopulated :)
---
Fo Da Horde!
---
&gt; This is the first I've seen a date and time
---
You mean this is the first you’ve even thought to look, because the dates and times were posted and discussed repeatedly across every platform.
---
Even if it DID come out the 27th, why take off work that day without even checking what time the game came out? For all you knew it was 11:30PM.
---
Yeah, you're right. It's almost equal in PVE damage too, though DS edges it out I think by a small margin.
---
Haha this is a new goal
---
Mages and Warlocks don't always do less damage than Rogues. During phases 1-3 yes, Rogues will be ahead. But once ZG comes out in phase 4 then Warlocks and Mages will catch up. And with AQ/Naxx gear in phases 5-6 they'll easily pull ahead of Rogues, and can even beat out warriors on DPS depending on the fight.
---
In PvE, Mages and Warlocks are about the same. Stand still and spam 1 button. You just have to choose which is the least annoying: farming soul shards and summoning the whole raid, or showing up half an hour early to spam conjure food for the whole raid.
---
In PvP, Mages are the mobile, squishy caster that's really good against melee, but struggles against casters. Lots of great utility but has a very high skill ceiling.
---
Warlocks are the tanky duelists that auto-win vs any caster while still having an even matchup against melee. They are fairly easy to play with fast leveling too. They're better on the Horde side though since you won't face any Undead with Will of the Forsaken.
---
Because leveling a paladin is the worst WoW experience one can have?
---
I’m going to be toxic :)
---
And priests like both
---
Tauren Hunter is actually the best class/race combo because no other proves your dominance so clearly and immediately
---
Crossroads
---
wonder if theyre gonna crack down on gambling again
---
Exactly. I thought it was a joke.
---
How big is big enough to get perks?
---
I'm pretty sure I could get 2 or 3 followers.
---
I haven't been able to find the full mixes anywhere. I've even gone as far as looking through archived pages but as you can imagine all those download links were long dead.
---
Look, everyone will find a raid group if they want. The quality of the raid group is in question if you're allowed in as a Main Tank Protection Paladin.
---
40 people is indeed a lot of people, and plenty of raid groups will be willing to take whatever warm bodies they can get to fill a raid, but these raid groups will not necessarily go far.
---
That would be great, thank you.
---
Your movement keys are either WASD or, if you're weird like me, QWES.
---
I then use:
---
123456
---
---RTY
---
A-DFGH
---
ZXCVBN
---
for a total of 20 keys.
---
Then you can use a modifier, I use shift, for another 20 keys.
---
~ is used for push to talk.
---
I also have 1 or 2 bars that are click only for things like buffs and professions.
---
why is life so difficult
---
I would put Paladin as #1 and Priest as #2, both holy spell healers,  Shaman as #9 and Druid as #8, both nature spell healers.  You want your healers in the back lines, right?  Put Mage as #3 and Warlock as #7, as they are both opposites, and should be opposite to each other on the wallpaper.  Jaina is a Mage, therefore Alliance, and the vanilla cinematic had an Undead Warlock, therefore Horde. I think Hunter should be #4, and Rogue #6.  Rogues fit better as the bad guys/misfits and so I think they fit better on the Horde side.  Remember all the Undead Rogues?  Plus Hunter in the opening cinematic is Dwarf, and therefore Alliance.  Last is #5, which I agree with being the Warrior.  Right in the middle of all the action, front of the line.
---
I’ll rip your head off and shit down your neck!
---
It's one of the best warrior talents period.
---
I'm curious how many rp-pvp servers are on retail compared to rp or pvp servers.
---
I thought about doing that but I would of had to buy the game again and all the expansions (it was when cata was released) so unfortunately it was a bit too expensive. 
---
I do miss Germany a lot! And would love to see Stockholm!
---
Source? I believe this is made up.
---
Love it, what a wholesome reply
---
I took a week off of work for the release date. I played vanilla when I was 13 and now I'm 27.. I joke about throwing my life away on the 28th.. not sure if I'm joking or not yet. I'm a server and usually only work 25 hours a week.. its gonna get bad haha, in so excited.

**Region**: NA
---
**Server**: PvE
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Class**: Druid Heals / Bear OT (backup tank).
---
Considering priest if someone can convince me that nature isn't lit
---
**Raid availability**: literally any day, any time. currently enjoying NEET life.
---
**Looking for**: semi-hardcore / hardcore but not insane
---
If possible, a plus-one exception so my friend can join the guild with me. He has similar experience.
---
**Experience**: semi-hardcore Tank &amp; raid lead through WotlK, hardcore druid heals, cata through WoD. 
---
Have raided in both vanilla and TBC as druid heals, have comprehensive knowledge of my class during 1.12.
---
Legitimately have non-family character references if desired.
---
**Notes**: ive played wow since the ulduar patch in WotlK and became a tank during icc, quickly moving up to main tank then raid lead after helping guild officials push content. I do my best to be as reliable as possible
---
I'm extremely passionate about my class and my performance and will do everything in my power to min-max, however I'm not a judgemental dick who harasses people about their own gear.
---
I am always punctual to guild events, barring IRL interference in which case I will always alert a guild official
---
Im decently quiet because I have *social anxiety*! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧ so no need to worry about me being disruptive! - in seriousness im very well trained in raid etiquette and know when to not lean in the push to talk button.
---
I *believe* I get along well with others, so far no one has told me I'm a dick or anything so either im not a horrible person or everyone is just too polite to tell me to stick it up my ass, so there's that.
---
Message me either on here, @wasabisaucie on Twitter or wasabisauce#8561 on discord. I'm available for interview basically anytime.

It's fake news because in Vanilla Cleanse does not remove Curses.
---
Pretty sure the burning legion tried to invade azeroth 10,000 years before orcs ever got there.
---
If you *really* think about it, the entire game is based around acts of extreme violence to innocent animals and strangers. So maybe the 'honor' part is in doing your own fair share of dying to corpse camping gankers?
---
I’ve got what you need. 
---
Oh wait, no Goblins in Classic.
---
Could take a month with lower yield or RNG farms and lower play time.
---
Shouldn't take a month, though.
---
Hi Grip. I’m also Grip:
---
Let me rephrase: retail players havent experienced it on any level close to what the classic player has. I originally meant the players who would prefer bfa over classic, but we can extend the inclusion to people who want mop etc over classic
---
That's why you keep moving and don't just camp. It's not hard to avoid someone
---
I mean, that's not entirely true. Draenor was being destroyed by the Burning Legion, while Kil'Jaeden manipulated Ner'Zhul and used Gul'dan to poison every aspect of orcish culture against them until many of them felt they had no choice.
---
I forgot people actually had guild meetings in real life. I love this &lt;3
---
Thanks
---
Like people need honor to kill the other faction for the lols. Remember SS vs TM was before the honor system
---
wait so you don't have to blame an entire species /s
---
This would be the top dps in the raid.
---
Doesn't matter, the wpn is too fast for it to be worthwhile.

---
Well, retail had war-mode now, so the only 2 server types there are are normal and RP.
---
Cause you are selling it=greed
---
I mean RP isn't laid out before you.
---
It's kinda what you make of it..
---
It's actually pretty hard... So many names are taken - and I'd imagine they want new unique names.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Realms_list
---
So names like Thrall/Bronzebeard/Ragnaros/Onyxia/C'Thun are all taken.
---
Some old-world zone names are still available, though.

My guesses:
---
* Darkshore
---
* Winterspring
---
* Malding
---
* Felwood
---
* Blackadder
---
* Pepsi

Play classic wow on launch week and see if you like it, it only costs 1 month sub
---
What is the exploit?
---
Did you order the wrong thing the new collectors edition box is not classic. It will be easy to resell at a profit though if you do not want it.
---
first character was a druid I leveled to about 6 or so (and this probably took me hooours).
---
Then I got disconnected and tried logging back in and got the error "A character with this name already exists." 
---
So I did the logical thing and deleted that character and rerolled another druid.
---
Then at about level 10 I switched to a hunter which I eventually got to 60.
---
Roll gnome.
---
Get corpse camped for days.
---
*Cries in demon hunter.

"Unfair"?

Holy to 40 if you really want max efficiency but I just go Shadow 1-60, 5 in wand spec

Give it a go. What class do you think you'd play? Or what role do you prefer?

Oh I gotcha I didn't catch that it's all compared to other classes. My mistake!

The original lich king was an orc, and the black portal would never have existed if Gul'dan didn't join the burning legion, which he did of his own free will Medivh at least was born with the corruption and had no choice.

I fully intend to multibox rogues and just gank/spawncamp lowbies and I cant wait to ruin their day

dont worry i play a lot of dead by daylight, im a professional

Something like that happened during WoD in my guild. A woman cheated on and then left her husband for another guildie. Pretty sure another cheated on her husband as well later on, but I wasn't playing by then so my timeline might be off.

Just fucking great times.

yes, pvp battles should be fair.  not ganking people farming, not corpse camping, not killing lowbies.  That's sick...

None of that is an exploit though. I still don’t follow you.
---
Are you mad that they existed in the game in classic and people used them, just like they’re going to do now? Do you just not want to have to bother grabbing a world buff or something? Did you even play classic?
---
You don't think some people find it entertaining to be a healer?
---
People feel personally attacked (In some way.) because you excluded them for having a long commute.
---
That's an omega guess. People feel attacked just for someone else saying something is bad about a game they play, this isn't much of a stretch comparatively.

I would encourage Blizzard to allow them naming acess early in return they let us know what setvers they went to.

If your guild is struggling to find 40 people to fill a raid you are just selfish for intentionally playing a bad spec and making it harder on them.

Well, let's be fair; it IS *also* rewarding skill.

The more you win, the less time it takes.

Will be listening to trance while playing for sure! But 09/10 mixes? Hopefully not a bunch of trouse lol!! Thanks for this I'll check it out!

Realtalk: learn how to cook at some point. Every adult who is capable of it needs to know how.
---
Actual answer: Pasta + salad is a good and easy classic. Get any premade sauce, mushrooms and/or meat, dried pasta, a salad mix, and a dressing (plus any addins you like). You can just make the salad in the bowl you eat it out of, make sure to be careful with the dressing if you do that though, it gets too much real easy

All it had that was related to classic is a rag statue and 30 days of game time, and Rag isn't even exclusive to classic/vanilla.

I serious doubt you are a woman, but if you are, then you are suffering from internalized misogyny.  Calling pve players carebears is a far less accurate descriptor than calling the pirated server pvp players sociopaths.
---
I'm going to gank you while you're trying to quest. Then burn down your race's major city. I hope its Children's Week when I do it too. The blood of the innocent is sooooo sweet. I'll post their heads on spikes outside of Org. A worthy offering to the Warchief.

lol. This is fucking World of Warcraft - the real MMO version. Good luck. It's dog eat dog out there. If you fucking cry because you got ganked go back to your safe space (BFA)
---
Or assholes. Everybody has an asshole! 😏😏😏

They don't have to announce it for it to be a thing. If you watched them during BFA launch, they were able to log in and out without having to wait while normal players had 1k player queues.

The Disc bubble used to lower aggro. Can't remember if they changed that before or after 1.12. More of a group healer than what you want focused on the tank.

Because I'm also not comparing stiffing the stonemason's guild to the severing of the orcs' connection to the elements, natural upheavals, and plague that ultimately led them to drinking the blood before *Medivh* helped bring them to Azeroth.

Ohhhhhh, honey. You are adorable.
---
I really don't care if you believe I'm a woman or not (though flouncing through my history should safely prove it), also not suffering from some deep seated misogyny cause I called you a bad name, does calling you a dick for lumping thousands of people under a real bad metal illness sound better? Don't be so ableist.
---
Carebear comes from the fact that you enjoy dealing with, well the environment of the game versus the player, not really an insult unless you wanna take it as one. Sociopath on the other hand... Yeah.
---
Warrior has been my main for a couple expansions and I'm interested to see how they play in vanilla. I hear they're terrible until cap but become unstoppable gods after. I love the class fantasy anyway and they're extremely viable for endgame content so that's my choice. Plus I'm intending on leading a guild time time around so that's yet another reason haha. 
---
As for you, I'd say just watch some videos and see what looks interesting. The vanilla classes have a lot of flavor. Find out what classes and specializations work well for the content that looks fun to you.
---
All else fails just start making characters until one feels right! Sometimes you won't know if you like the class until you've played around with it some. The nice thing is that you can always restart, you'll always have people to run with since everyone has a different pace.

Thanks for looking. If you're interested and you'd like to give them a listen, I've uploaded both the episodes I have.

Sorry, Tumblr is that way.
---
Basically every expansion's story has only existed as a backdrop/set piece for the game to take place in. Vanilla and WotLK did this the least imo, as vanilla zones were essentially just daily life in the Warcraft universe, made to make you feel like you were in a new world. Lich King, with the exception of Ulduar, felt like a direct sequel to WC3.
---
Don't forget about /golfclap though, that is one of the most passive aggressive emotes I know of :D
---
I would honestly go with lean proteins and complex carbs but you're likely just going to eat junk which in turn may just cause you to crash
---
I agree, I'm just saying I could easily be right as well - note the careful "one could argue" statement. It makes sense to me, because it matches my journey with the game as well as being the story I've heard the most from all over..
---
As someone who played on a PvP server for several years: if you're on a PvP server it's just part of the game and I can't say I miss it one little bit.  That said though I think they made a mistake getting rid of PvP servers in retail, war mode as a substitute sucks IMO.

As a tank I often take mana breaks as a moment to talk to the teammates, instead of rushing to the next pack. Also,  theres no reason to pull more than 2-3 if your dps isnt capable of proper aoe dps. Youre just taking hit from extra mobs while no one is hitting them.
---
Healers mana is a good gauge, but certainly not the only one.
---
when do you guys plan to do druids?
---
Van Cleef or whatever the boss name is. They didn't say DM for Deadminesas that was the abbreviation for Dire Maul.

Yeah! That human folly! Nothing at all like Orc folly! No Orc would ever do something that "looks right at the time, but in hindsight leads to worldwide genocide and the culling of your own people!"

Yep. Friends rolling alliance, my mains were alliance. I'm going horde warrior this round though. I want a new experience, but also for pvp reasons. My friends will be alliance and so, should be good fun. Cant wait to stomp some gnomes!

"Players with an active subscription or game time on their World of Warcraft account..."

Does this mean that, for example, a player who played until WOTLK (who has currently no subscription) can also participate in the name reservation?

Additionally, is there any list of 'forbidden names' in WoW?
---
Ive skipped that quest for years now. Youre the reason why. Well done my man

From what I understand, you'll be spamming "\_\_\_\_ heal" on your allies, as opposed to "\_\_\_\_ bolt" on your enemies.
---
&gt; the only person that believed in the Forsaken being good allies was ~~Thrall~~ the guy who wanted undead to be playable and on the horde for some reason, despite having nothing in common besides being metal af.
---
But doesn't it require a respec? Won't it get expensive? I'm thinking of going priest but I'm afraid of not being able to just go out in the world and farm at level 60 as a heal spec

They're both fun classes, warriors are slightly harder to level in my experience

Oh yeah I just mean like RL friends. I still play but am by far the last of us. A few are coming back but no matter what we would never be as big as your clique. That’s what I miss ...knowing people and all that. It’s going to be great

I know you said you can't cook, but spaghetti is very easy to make. Try to find spaghetti made from whole grain, then grab a bag of salad and an already-cooked chicken (such as a rotisserie chicken) and bam, you've got yourself an easy and healthy lunch and/or dinner... or breakfast.

Personally, as an Undead, I enjoy the oddity of begin sort of a faction within a faction lore wise.
---
Are you even allowed to corpse camp people nowadays? I thought that was a hate crime / virtual rape
---
it def. was 15 man
---
LBRS was usually done with 10 people as it was considered easy, UBRS was 15
---
If mob hits you 2-3 times before you hit it 2 times (lets make it even 1:1 due simplicity). If you have a 3.2-3.8s 2-h weapon, most mobs attack on about 1.5s range.
---
So, normally, standing still when you hit it twice, the mob hits you for 4x on 3.0s weapon and almost 5 on slower ones. If you can decrease that to 2-3 from 4-5 hit, whats the better and faster tactic ? Facetanking everything and eating/bandages +50% ?
---
Doesnt really matter tho, you want to do the instance grind on warriors for sure.
---
To calm down my hype (I couldn't concentrate on work and was only thinking about which race/class combination to play) I started on a p-server. I did the Tanaris chicken quest and was super happy to find out they sped up the chicken. Was as fast as myself when normal running.
---
I arrive at the end with my chicken in tow, the chicken despawns, and...MY QUEST DID NOT GET THE FUCKING COMPLETION!!!!
---
Boy, was I angry. Stuff like this reminded me fully well why I don't play on p-servers, and am looking forward to classic.
---
Both are good against different classes. 
---
Orc can help you out but sometimes it won’t do anything. Undead and will always be helpful every 2 or 3 minutes (I forget will of forsaken cooldown) 
---
I’d 100 percent go undead just cause I think orcs look silly in robes. Undead are some sick casters though
---
Warrior. Take advantage of that free food and tank some dungeons for gear
---
Didn't know that, love little extra steps like this in mmos
---
Right? I can only imagine how much fun that would be in a PvP setting. "Poly dat one, i'll sap dis one, and we esplode one in middle!". HNNNNGGGG ANALYSIS PARALYSIS
---
I wonder would alchemy be good choice? You can make potions and thus saving money for not buying too much food and in end game you can make money with it.
---
Unless a mage has aoe pulls (which at launch it will not) priest beat them. Druids are the class that could be above priests but its arguable. 
---
Mages could be #1 if all aoe camps are open and work like they do on pservers but they don't full respawn they trickle respawn. 
---
More than like they they will be 6th in leveling speed after both priests and druids (in general).
---
PVE it is, I guess...
---
No you idiot. Boy, girl, non-binary, what have you, if you don't want to play on pvp server then don't fucking play on one. But don't go around lumping an entire group of people under the sadistic monster label because 1 out of 100 people like to play in unfair pvp fights.
---
You say that like these rules arnt posted at the beginning of the run. Get a brain please or classic isn't for you.
---
Rogues are my biggest weakness. My question is just to what extent am I shooting myself in the foot for choosing aesthetics over superior abilities.
---
I wonder if alchemy would be good? You can make health potions which will be great help and in end game you can make money with it.
---
This is the right answer. Anybody loading up on carby and sugary foods is not in for a good time
---
Shadowstep/cloak of shadows.
---
Do you mean Qp?
---
&gt;Prolly cuz blizz released ~~a new shit addon~~ WoD
---
Grey = Dead
---
i think it was added in the pre-WOTLK patch or at launch. i swear i just saw a mad season vid talking about this
---
True, get this holding hands bullshit outta here. Can't wait for the salty threads about ninjas, gankers, drama, gatekeeping etc
---
San Diego and I got a week and a half off lol!
---
&gt;Yes
---
Then you are mistaken. I will blame you as much, or even more, than the hunter. He made a mistake, yes. Maybe he doesn't care, maybe he's just not a good player. But if you refuse to taunt, despite the fact that you could, you made a mistake **on purpose!**
---
&gt;Why would you blame someone else for the hunter wiping or attempting to wipe your group.
---
Because Blame falls on the shoulders of EVERYONE who contributed to the wipe. Yes, the hunter could have dpsed the right target. And you could have taunted the de-aggroed mob, negating his mistakes effects.
---
&gt;crying wolf won't give a good tank a bad reputation
---
No, but wiping your group will. If I see you doing such a thing in a dungeon, I will play the dungeon to its end (or until the group disbands otherwise), and then never invite you again or join a group you're in. Word spreads quickly in a closed serve environment, and if you believe that you are above criticism because you're "the tank", you are mistaken. Because while tanks are rare, bad tanks and people who think they are in their right to "punish" others, are among the two biggest problem guilds can curse themselves with.
---
And so did some others in my guild but a lot got to raid as shadow, ret, moonkin (lolwut) etc and they took turns. The guild took half of Naxx before TBC patch, with these kind of specs and only 1 (sometimes 2) raids per week.
---
I’ll take your word for it and expect to play right after work 🤞 (2hours after launch)
---
The smell of roast gnome brings me back to my childhood

They'll be chasing you down 6 months later screaming "I'm gonna wear you like a fucking sock" in their full BiS that they hate-farmed.

You ever been camped by an army? I have. Sodapoppin's army is relentless. I ran into him one day, got camped for 10 minutes, decided to spirit rez, got camped at the spirit rezzer and had to log out for an hour until he finally left the area. It was the most entertaining and horrible experience I've had in wow aside from a priest needing on my cruel barb because he needed attack power in case he ran out of mana.
---
Ain't nobody got time to log out of classic for an hour or have a priest need on their cruel barb.
---
I have a Roccat Nyth... so already accomplished :)
---
Keep your fake warriors, we beat them with a single totem peasant.
---
I decided to become a NPC. Please make sure to rescue my poor wife from these ferocious Gnolls! To hell with these raids and dangerous ways of life. I shall be resting at the inn waiting to be helped.
---
Nice! A quick google search of “Montreal meal delivery” has a few good looking hits. Microwave and plastic forks are all you’ll need. 
---
It’s so incredibly nice not having to shop/cook/clean/throw food away because you didn’t cook or eat it in time.
---
It’s also cheaper than eating out at like a chick-Fil-a or chipotle for me. 
---
I’m definitely getting off topic now but if you’re into fitness also counting macros is not an effort at all with the carbs/fat/protein on them as well.
---
Dynamic ip addresses does not mitigate ddos. If the servers are available to outside connections they may be ddosed. This does not neccesarily make it harder even, since they are probably behind a hostname or address within a shared domain. The ip address for a server can be resolved easily regardless
---
That's a good point. The food + leveling together with a Mage will make leveling faster because of less downtime, and also being able to tank dungeons will net gear + exp for us
---
Tried it out sometimes but didn´t liked it so much.
---
I remember they were always hybrids to a degree so they could still heal, but you're totally right. Power infusion and dipping into weavings probably way better
---
The real trick is to /golfclap when they gank you then /lol /pity when you kill them.
---
lmao you got it
---
I love disc, but missing penance and pain supression :(
---
They are 3rd or 4th. After locks and hunters. With priests being very close. I believe the MAX speed of leveling a druid is 3rd but for 95% of people priest level faster. So i would typically put them above druids, but with a note that druids can be faster.
---
Mages are fast with their aoe pulling/grinding that you cannot really do on release and classic repsawns work totally different than pservers which will nerf the shit out of this method. Basically, Where pservers respawn mobs from the time of death/loot + 30s or w/e it is. Classic respawns a mob instantly one when empty a camp, then trickle respawns mobs in over time. This means its far harder to come back to full camps of mobs.
---
Technically the Lich King was an orc
---
No you are using it to Respec, buy consumes, give to friends, etc. not the same as rolling need. Don't quote the deep magic to me witch I was there when it was written. 
---
Not everyone used to think like you and it was a better time in vanilla. I do not blame you for your opinion but only pity you for not knowing the feeling of true nirvana of loot courtesy
---
I'm foodtarded, what are commplex carbs?
---
No, I'm saying I'd rather not play with fucking lunatics. Race/Gender/Religion/ etc. doesn't matter to me. Just dont be a total headcase. So, you wouldn't be welcome. You know, because you're a fucking lunatic.
---
All besides the CTRL modifier i find rather uncomfortable to use. Too twisty.
---
100% 5th is the best it could do (and i have seen some people argue 6th.) Also with the way camps respawn in classic this nerfs their aoe grinding more.

 **🔷🔷 &lt;ASCENDANCE&gt;🔷🔷** **EU | Alliance | PvP** 
---
**Region**: Europe
---
**Server Type**: PvP
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
**About us:**
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
**Raid Roster needs:**
---
* Druids: 1 RESTO
---
* Hunters: Exceptional players only
---
* Mages: Exceptional players only
---
* Paladins: Exceptional players only
---
* Priest:  Exceptional player only
---
* Rogues: Exceptional players only
---
* Warlocks: 1 DPS
---
* Warriors:  Exceptional players only
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM).
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.

Like I said different strokes, have your fun.
---
Sure we can, we just send over males in animal forms.
---
nope.  we knew about the songflower exploit, but we didnd't use it, because it was cheating.
---
The ability to stealth past unwanted battles is nice. Check. I'm mulling it over because time is of the essence
---
Sorc can you tp baal?
---
I can try.
---
Then that line.
---
People in town: Esc. Save &amp; exit.
---
I've played on the pirated servers.  Everyone that kills you takes up position over your corpse.
---
[What about people who go by the same name and aren't impersonating anybody?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKT9OOkqDTs)
---
I think that’s a bad plan. I shouldn’t have to wait for retail for my games content. It’s two different teams anyways. My guess is it’s two different projects and ones content will not effect the other.
---
Great stuff friend, thanks a lot! I like the way you think, and agree with the reasoning. I guess this is the issue with mainly reading guides and not looking at the trees in themselves.
---
I’m not saying they will make you wait, you don’t want alll the content released in a year.
---
That would be dumb.
---
Fuckin' dum dums. 
---
"More work?"
---
Did you try not sucking at the game?
---
you might want to play on the pve servers then, because the pirated pvp servers seems to attract the absolute worst ppl.
---
Yeah its under druids (#3) at #4 for leveling but even then for most players priest are faster than druids even.
---
I dunno how much time you have to play, but you could just make both? Have the Alliance for hanging with friends, have the Horde for when friends aren't around.
---
Lol I’ll be on at launch. I figure the later it gets the people who actually have work and school will start to log. Either way the next morning is gonna be nice because those people won’t be home playing.
---
Just because people "know the fights" doesn't mean they aren't still BAD.
---
Source: 1 hours playing BFA tonight, wiping 3 times in SFK. The dickheads who did fuck-all DPS and got us all killed dropped group. Saving Grace of Dungeon Finder: 3 new DPS who had refrained from cranial-anal merger disorder arrived.
---
EU player here, I would LOVE to join you guys! What faction are you going to be on?
---
Both are situational, but which is more? Will of the forsaken is only good against 3 classes. Orc stun resistance is good vs rogues, druids, warriors and paladins, but occasionally there is also: mage impact, sp blackout, hunter intimidation + concussive proc, (did warlock inferno summon stun?)
---
Will of the forsaken is good because you have the control of when it happens. Orc stun resistance might be better for frontliners, or when in position/class that is focused. Or if you want to be pita for rogues
---
Mark Kern is on record saying he believes Classic will have 2 million concurrent players.
---
What is this? Is this for lvl 60 pve gearing? Leveling? If it's for leveling, it's wrong pretty much everywhere, if it's for lvl60, why only talk about base stats when secondary stats are more important to a lot of classes? Why even make a base stat prio guide when there's bis lists for every tier of content out already, that's way more informative. Or at least a prio that includes secondary stats as it could then be used as a way for new players to understand why bis pieces are bis. 
---
I don't mean to sound like a dick but please don't make "guides" when you have no idea what you're doing and there's already a million guides out there that do it better.
---
&gt;We can't cook for shit
---
You are mistaken, comrade! Here, let the power of the squat show you the way:
---

---
&gt;	Simply, just remember WWTD - What would Thrall Do?
---
Run away and sulk for a few years?
---
What multitude of ways are priests outperforming pally healers? 
---
Pallies offer far more utility without that big a drop off in healing ability from priests. You could easily run a successful raid with 1 priest 1 Druid and the rest pallies.
---
I respect that you didn't use '/s'. Being downvoted by people who missed the joke is a badge of honor.
---
Kings honor, friend!
---
Problem with faps is you can't activate them while in a stun and when you do decide to use them the other player can reset and wait it out.
---
I don’t want people who think hand of rag is badass. That tells me they don’t really know anything about what’s good.
---
Regular mount's speed is 60% .is not it ?
---
Man I can't wait to get out there and absolutely slaughter every little helpless noob I can find, just because of this post. It's like when the mom of a kid that's getting bullied comes to the school and tells everyone to be nice to their little boy...
---
Got em.
---
So none of those warrs had their trinkets ready? Not even FAP?
---
We sulked 15 years now we're going home

---
People who actually understand that WoW is an actual game and not a chat-hub in bars on lvl 1s just play the game as anyone else and just roleplay in /s /y /p (or even discord) etc.
---
A vast minority just hangs out in goldshire.
---
Play shaman, it’s good to try new things. Especially early on when the game is still new, no one will care as much as you have been told
---
I'm the GM of [&lt;ZANCOR&gt;](https://discord.gg/73nsMgh) and we're interested in participating with this community. It sounds like a great way to build a long lasting healthy server throughout all phases. Count us in, we're horde side btw.
---
im planning my warlock to be an asshole and my paladin to condemn such actions.
---
Their reaction will determine if I'm toxic to them.
---
If you're new and you refuse to listen..... well....
---
You can also kick imp sor for divine int. imp sor only improves the base dmg, so it'S basically 5 talent points for ~ 7dps.
---
And you should have a good amount of int on gear. Spelldmg is your paramount threat stat and gear with that usually comes with int too. Gearing a prot paladin is quite hard, because you need to find the right balance between threat stats and defensive stats and will end up worse than a prot warrior in both regards. In my endgame builds I generally aim for 400-450 spelldmg with ~25% block and ~20% full avoidance.
---
A vast minority?
---
Cant believe i havent seen Mass Rez yet. I love rezzing random corpses on the road... but I HATE rezzing more than 2 or 3 people cuz that means drinking my entire mana bar each time
---
I mean, only Arcane shot is. Could just be special ammo.
---
I think this may have been a thing in vanilla, but I'm not 100% sure. One of the comments below mentions waiting for mobs to evade and reset, which is ridiculous.
---
Yeah, yeah. What are jokes anyway? God forbid we read flairs of posts or read a post twice to understand the implied context. (**Which in this case,is humour.**)
---
***Anyone who responds to a reddit post in a knee-jerk fashion is a toxic sperg, imho.***
---
Classic won’t kill Retail. Classic is for a niche audience. You just sound bitter. Everyone can have their own taste.
---
Personally I'd go with the shaman. I wouldn't worry too much about getting raged at either. You're going to have plenty of time while leveling to figure out your class
---
9 days straight for me.
---
No real need to mention the first 7-9 points because they are picked up anyway. Mind Flay is literally not worth interrupting wanding or even picking up until level 36 so your Shadow Weaving shouldn't be breaking 6%. That being said, it adds 6% wand damage if you manage to keep a Shadow wand at all times which is okay I guess.
---
I never use VE while leveling unless I was pulling 2-3 mobs at a time. It just slowed down my 5s rule mana regen every time.
---
I just absolutely do not see how it could possibly be better(for questing/grinding solo). It's not a matter of preference or opinion. The tree is straight up damageless minus 6% from Shadow Weaving(assuming you always have a Shadow Wand)
---
You can throw away 5 points just to get Searing Light in Holy around 40 and it will still give you more damage per point than all of Shadow. Obviously I won't include Darkness because you don't get it until 40 when you respec into Shadowform from Wand Spec for 5 levels.
---
I'm not suggesting you spam smite or holy fire while leveling but using holy spells as filler instead of wanding(which actually are higher damage than Mind Flay spam) when you have excess mana has at least a little bit of benefit.
---
You can learn how to cook until Classic launches.
---
The entire reason I want to play classic is permanence. I don't like DLC coming out and completely invalidating everything you've done.
---
The same as I don't really like getting a great item, and then it being invalidated by levelling. 60 is where the game starts for me.
---
 **&lt;Hope Rises&gt; | Casual-friendly “mediumcore” | Raids once per week | Horde PvP**  
---
Founded back in 2014 on the principles of positivity, loyalty, and freedom, &lt;HR&gt; will be getting a rez for Classic.  
---
• Though some of us will be putting hardcore hours into Classic, we will “officially” raid just once per week on Tuesdays (+50 wife points)! 
---
• 8 or 9pm Central start time for raids on Tuesdays, but [unfortunately our Tuesday raid slots are mostly filled up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_7zCyD74nEueXlbdWDsF3tvoJM0vEUAMB-15rmF9dt0/edit?usp=sharing). If you want to join us casually or for optional Saturday raids at around the same times, then that may be the better option!
---
• High pop PvP server free of major streamers.  
---
• A calm but steady leveling pace (though pure speculation, I envision most of us being raid-ready approximately 3-4 months after launch, which averages out to about 2-2.5 hours played per day).  
---
• Large, active guild with numerous casual members so there should always be guildies to level with at your own pace.  
---
Many of us have raided for years at a competitive Mythic level in retail WoW. Though we are a competent group looking forward to crushing PvP and raiding through Naxx, enjoyment of each other’s company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame is our top priority. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a “world-first” (lol), cutting-edge, every-world-buff-is-mandatory hardcore raiding experience, then our guild is not for you. 
---
If, however, you jive with our vision of Classic and would like to join the family, or would simply like more information, feel free to comment here or DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355).  
---
Thanks, everybody! Hope to see y’all in Azeroth! \~ Oleon

Been there, done that. My problem was that my former GF unknowningly made me wonder if it was me who should "grow up". I actually quit gaming for a while and tried to engage in her very small array of hobbies. She was also very clingy, meaning that I often felt bad when I was out having fun with friends and she was just sitting at home. Needless to say, I am actually glad I had that experience, because it made me set my own happiness as the most important factor in my next relationship. Now I am married and I am very happy. Even though my wife has the same tendencies with no hobbies, she almost never complains when I'm out golfing or doing other things. She is not looking forward to classic, and she laughed when she heard I took the day off for launch, but she does not make me feel bad about it, and that is key for me.
---
My advice is clearly to don't cave in because you feel lonely. You will find someone, and make sure to make compromises if you find someone special (that often happens naturally). Life is fun, if you do the things you think is fun.
---
Warstomp is off gcd so you can aa&gt;ms&gt;warstomp in 1 gcd.
---
Yawn.
---
I don’t think it will be in one year. I don’t think they should consider waiting or not because retail is about to release content. If its time for a new classic phase and retail is releasing content so be it.
---
My friend was teaching me random stuff about wow just before I was due to start (mid-vanilla) and one of the main things that stuck with me was that "holy damage is the only damage type that can't be resisted".
---
So what did I do? I proceeded to quest and level as a Holy Paladin for the next 5 months. I mean, the mobs can't resist my damage. It's literally THE most logical choice, right? Right.
---
Except they did that *un-ironically*. Where as this would be a *joke*, serving to give them a taste of their medicine. You know? Commonly known as banter.

---
*Ad hominem* is short for *argumentum ad hominem*, or "argument to the person." It would be ad hominem if I was attempting to defeat your argument *by way of* insulting you. I'm not disputing the argument at all, therefore I am not resorting to ad hominem. I'm just letting you know you sound like an narcissistic prick.
---
LoL? Are there no zeppelins in classic or just no zepp from TB to Orgri?
---
Zeppelin from TB to Orgri was added around Cata IIRC.
---
The sad truth is that everyone bitches about their current instance of gameplay being awful when they get griefed and they bitch the loudest but fail to understand that freedom (which brings along griefing) is a fundamental of a good MMO. I can't even think how shit classic would have been without the villains on my server.
---
Hes a very chill streamer to watch.  Good to listen too while playing games.
---
Do undead... And make your bank alt orc
---
BFA is more grindy than Classic. In assic you only need to grind gold and if you play properly you can make plenty without no lifing.
---
In BFA to be a top raider you spend thousands of hundreds of gold in consumes, not to mention the grind for benthic, m+, world quests, Artifact power
---
So many people seem hung up on this, as if every server was the server. Different servers, different rules.
---
Server culture will eventually dictate how things are done. My servers always greeded on BoEs, but needing on them is clearly the better way to do it. As the tank I'll be stating it at the start of the run.
---
I would just roll Undead. You aren't even guaranteed to resist the stun. Will of the Forsaken has its uses, it's a bit of a toss-up in my mind
---
Maybe one of them developed a thing for pandas.
---
I wonder how you managed to squeeze 3 years of breaks, leveling 3 characters (with 20 days played on at least one) and clearing up to Naxx just in time for TBC release.
---
No, but before people knew how things worked they would throw out theories as fact.

I disagree with this for the following reasons
---
what do you think of when you see the name Kungen? I picture a Tauren tank. The same can be said for vurtne, Bebep, Pat, drakedog. Although I think rogues are just rogues tho, I dont remember any famous rogues because of their spec, might be because i dont know the specs well enough tho.
---
In classic there is no limit to your grind. You can grind to your hearts content. I can get thorium brotherhood rep done in a day if I want.
---
Alrighty then. Shadow wand doesn't benefit at all from shadow weaving at all btw.
---
pacing in PvE and PvP.
---
the game is fast paced, but on the other hand you almost always have enough time to react to something.   
---
its easy to follow what is going on right now. even in larger scale battles.
---
:hat tip: M'GIRAFFE
---
Maybe the server ip's don't change.  I think I remember in retail wow that if you changed shards you would connect to another server with another ip.
---
You don't have to make everyone happy, you don't have to impress anyone, you don't have to keep the peace. Sometimes you fuck up, no matter how good you are at something, no one is perfect at anything. Accept responsibility for it, but if anyone has a rage fit over a video game, they probably need to go outside for a while. So choose based on what makes you happy, not what makes some hypothetical 13 year old in a dungeon run a month from now happy. There's no pleasing that guy anyway tbh, he's just looking for someone to blame so that no one, including himself, will examine his own play too closely.
---
King's honor, friend.
---
:)
---
Druids and hunters generally compete for server first 60. Though hunters are generally faster.
---
Make burritos my man
---
If rogues are your biggest weakness then it would be beneficial to play as an Orc. If you would like to sacrifice that benefit for a less helpful one + some looks that is your decision. This question has been asked hundreds of times.
---
Female orc warlock looks pretty badass imo
---
Ehem..  you can brake blind with poison cleansing totem plus fear and charm with tremor totem. That’s three CC you can brake. 
---
Ontopic. Play the hybrid spec for pvp. It’s great.
---
What about trying to decide for a warrior? PVP in mind.
---
It took that long for your ears to heal I'm assuming.
---
Build the wall of nope?
---
I never forgot the time I was very clever and travelled half Kalimdor as a wisp with 30 % increased run speed so I could complete a delivery quest and pick up a flight point. When I was reading nearby a was returned to the spirit healer close to my corpse. 
---
Good times.
---
Just think about what you will actually be doing endgame and weigh the pros and cons in reality. 
---
I really love Warlock PVP but I can't stand the PVE. I know even if PVP is my main gold I will spend a significant amount of my time raiding and such. Vise versa playing Resto Shaman love the PVE hate the PVP.
---
I weighed my situation in reality and chose a class that is my favorite at neither but is fun for me overall.
---
Also you can hop on an instant 60 server and just mess around get a feel for each class if you aren't familiar with them at max level.
---
Good luck pal :)
---
There is no Zeppelin from TB to Orgrimmar. From what I read it was added during WoTLK.
---
Community - raiding - epics mattering
---
Shadow with wand spec is one of the best leveling specs in the game my guy. Your kill speed isn't as high as some classes but you have infinite sustain which overall gives you great leveling speed. Between Spirit Tap and wanding, you just Mind Blast/SW:P and wand them to death to keep high on mana to use on healing yourself. Any excess mana can go into DPSing if you know you're going to be done killing soon and can afford to dump it all.
---
if you can fil up your 40 man roster, sure there is space fore 3 to 5 meme specs.  
---
But no more. the rest is carrying you.  
---
Maybe if you have certain raids on farm, you can farm gear for your meme players, but dont forget, meme spec is called meme for a reason.
---
No, that´s the nice part. You can disenchant even max level epics with ench 1/75 at level 5
---
misssing to pick herbs...
---

Don't forget smug, which you're totally demonstrating to be false.
---
Ppl seem to forget that the gaming industry these days are build on hype. And if there’s one game that will have the most hype then any other game in the last years, its Classic WoW.
---
I believe 10 million is about right, but it will fall fast cause of not having instant satisfaction, like most games do have these days.
---
Launch is going to be a pain

Both are very good in PVP

actually it has been pointed out it is not the most accurate representation but thanks

&gt;I'm no game dev but I'm sure you can make a system 5x more interesting and fair.

Well they did end up making Arena in TBC and later RBG so they kinda did already do it, nothing for the solo player, but then again not much is available to a solo player in the game.

Get a bag of chips, and then when you're eating them and one falls onto your shoulder, just brush it off onto the floor.
---
Depends on the number of pvp servers. The PvE servers will be a lot more stable since picking PvE is an "active choice" and the vast majority of BfA tourists will pick a PvP server, so if anything there will be more layering, population fluctuation and potential problems on the PvP servers.
---
Looking for group as a rogue. :)
---
I personally like to go with the /ruffle to ruffle their hair like you would a cute child. It really seems to drive people mad whereas /spit is a little overused and lacks the finesse needed for some true BM.

OH MY FUCKING GODD SJAAKAMAZKCKCDYGW

That is a realistic scenario though...

Any dungeon. The healer having to drink after a pull when they otherwise shouldn't have had to is problematic.

Thanks for your input, I appreciate it. I'm mulling it over as I type this. In fact, I'm going to sleep on it and see how I feel about it in the morning.
---
Oh yeah, no doubt, I love Kargoz. I'm just pointing out that he isn't one of the top top end streamers when it comes to popularity.
---
Orc. Between zerk rage &amp; death wish you aren’t going to get feared as a warrior.
---
Is anyone else just sleeping, getting up for work, sitting there on off days, all while being “asleep” mentally?  I feel like I won’t be alive or “activated” until these fucking servers go live
---
Can confirm a wife husband duo broke up when the guild met up in our Vanilla guild too (the break up was during BC).
---
I was only a teen so I didn’t attend the meetup, just had to watch the guild disintegrate afterwards though.
---
If I can knock them out of stealth, why wouldn’t I?

I'm not really seeing Smite Priests being viable in PvP but maybe I am missing something.

If this was a joke it wasn't a very good one.

What do you mean?

Then you can finally play the game.

I played some WotLK on a private server some time ago, that server had collapsed and so I came to this new server and started from scratch. And while leveling in Redridge Mountains I struggled because I was a bit underleveled.  
---
After a lot of dying to mobs I could finally hand my quests in... Or so I thought. When I came back to the village an undead deathknight and his friends had massacred all the NPCs and now they were coming after me. They probably killed me at least 10 times.  
---
I was furious and I came back to him one last time to see his name clearly and I put him on my list, I swore I would grow strong and destroy him... Unfortunately I gave up on the game not long after and his name is still in that notepad file... Untouched.  
---
Funnily enough that was the first and last time I ever put someone on a list like that, it was an amazing feeling, imagining how I would get back at him!
---
Balance, in all things as we druids say. Dont forget healthy fats too. Some avocado, chickpeas or coconut oil are needed for balance
---
It's much too complicated for me, too many buttons to press. I much prefer my 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 rotation.
---
I played vanilla 5-7. A lot of us had parents who played, I got my own account for my 7th birthday.
---
and in 20 years we'll have all the money we need
---
It's a completely different game.
---
I played vanilla back then like 24/7.
---
Quit in WotlK, visited a few expansions but quit in a few days again.
---
Then I heared about private servers and played 24/7 again for a year and a half. Even while pservers are not 100% vanilla they are very close and it reminded me that I would play either vanilla or no wow at all.
---
Classic all day long.
---
Was my original Vanilla character :D I always ended up tanking for my group of friends. I just can't decide whether to go with it again or try hunter/druid/mage. I played Hunter and Druid a little in vanilla at 60, and both were fun. I did enjoy the warrior though.
---
If someone is about to die in pve you’re doing them a favour by killing them first. Dying in pvp means you don’t suffer durability loss.
---
You = everyone im vanilla.
---
Its not though. Any buff stayed on if you logged out, its part of the game mechanics.
---
Play, don't look up anything beyond character creation screen. Discovering things on your own is half the fun of Classic, unless you are a minmaxer.

Then long on a opposing faction character whisper them and continue to tell them how shit they are
---
I would definitely give it a try. For starters you can look on YouTube for introduction videos on the different classes and their job in group play. Class diversity is a big thing in classic compared to retail, and for me it's on of the biggest pros. Tips Out and Kargoz have some videos i can recommend on that topic.

I was waking up at 3 am to tame broken tooth. I m sure there WILL be people on
---
Druid has boomkin, moonglow, full resto, full feral, HOTW 30/21, pvp HOTW  1/29/21, and flag runner specs. 
---
Warrior has arms, fury, deep prot, fury prot, and impale prot. 
---
You're a little short on the math.
---
We called it VC in 2004 also, namely because that was the objective of the quest.  Now, if you were Horde you might have only heard it called DM, because there was no quest to specifically kill Vancleef.  Therefore, it wouldn't have even made sense to say it like that.  That's where the disconnect lies between people calling it one thing or another, and being adamant about either hearing it or not.
---
Hell, I even have some old stress-test screenshots where folks are LFG VC in chat.
---
Eh I mean some take it as unhelpful criticism and I'd never want to do that to an artist.

check it out. it describe about which race is better for warlock between orc and undead. 
---
from warlock discord.
---
This my hamstring, this my charge 
---
Both are shit for mages at large
---
I think it's exactly what newcommers from retail are gonna be like for their first 5 dungeons
---
/u/littlesunfish .. He's not our hero.. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector..
---
While that is good advice for the game experience. However, I would suggest and encourage that the veteran players are nice toward, help and appreciate all the "noobs/beginners" as they certainly are essential for the longevity of the game.
---
Yes, you could.  
---
But then you are going to have a LOT of spells on your bars. Especially as a healer. You are usually looking at 2-3 spell ranks of most healing spells.
---
Combining them to a single macro frees up a lot of space.
---
If you are not going to use things like VuhDu or what the name is.
---
I'm all for corpse camping, this is warcraft, but I don't feel any accomplishment from it. What I do feel accomplishment from is finding a corpse camper and camp him until he logs off. That I like.
---
sp and wl? Yeahh.....
---
80% I doubt it but oke. For me and alot of others it's more then nostalgia, it's a game we actually wanne play because its a true MMORPG.
---
If you get unstealthed and Vanish and wait minutes you re bad manners.
---
I loved getting the skeleton form with the undead casting animations.
---
Noggenfogger is the reason I'm rolling an undead mage this go 'round. :)
---
I know the name was really familiar, but i wasn't sure about the server.
---
Really like this! The art of the priest honestly looks quite cute.
---
MONSTER KHAOS
---
We had a slight demon problem but everything's fine now, we're all fine now, situation normal. How are you?
---
Shadowstep
---
Queue the Doctor Who theme song.
---
There is no "Need" for BoEs. Everyone should sell them.
---
Considering that totems only affect the 4 people in a party with you, and not the whole raid, shamans are great to have around for buffs like mana spring and windfury.
---
Haven't they been saying that August 27th is the release date??? I'm confused.
---
Heya :)
---
1. Growl, armor and stamina you learn at the trainer
---
Claw and screech you learn from taming beasts, the greater fleshripper in westfall gives you first screech rank
---
2. Weapons, train staves and two handed swords and also train guns in iron forge. When you get to Duskwood you can kite and kill mor’ladim to get a nice sword and a quest in STV later on will give you a fun upgrade.
---
Leeroy
---
I think totem use comes naturaly as you encounter different situations. Even if you make a mistake, if you take your time you will figure out what you could have done better and you won't make the same mistake again. After all, improving is a fun part of the game :)
---
Well now I'm killing a dwarf hunter named Grip.
---
You cant cast aimed shot and stay stealthed
---
Expansions used to be called addons.
---
One of the problems with rolling a warrior, is that you already think of what alt you gonna roll. Cause of all the downsides a warrior has.
---
I suggest rolling your alt as main, cause its gonna be a looooong run. 😂
---
Im playing warrior and my alt will be a mage. Im not listining to my own advise btw
---
But thankfully no changes
---
Thanks, I'll join you later after work :)
---
Very clean website.
---
Haha upvote for honesty.  For the OP though, it depends when you ding 60.  On a fresh server if you are ahead of the pack you can gain access to some farming spots that will be contested later.  I might suggest hitting those up first thing while people are still grinding up to 60.  Grouping will be harder to the bulk of people hit 60.  If you are in the bulk or behind... just get your BiS.
---
When me and a friend started playing, the first time we hit an in and saw the zzz at our character names we thought it needed a rest. So we naturally let it /sleep on the floor for 10 minutes.(after finding out how that worked) After coming back from a drink we noticed it was still tired, figured it needed to sleep in a bed. Tried again for 10 minutes. We got upset and just thought: just let the weakling die of fatigue and continued questing.
---
Don't bash them in the face jump through them facing backwards and spam bash so you hit their back if they don't turn.
---
Logging to conserve buffs, not being able to play your character is straight up bullshit. Even worse when you make money with professions.
---
DM is my favorite instance but that buff is one of my most hated things in the game.
---
And arrows!
---
You will never be an unstoppable power, unless you have good gear and a pocket healer. Thats pvp wise ofcourse. As a warrior, you are half a class.
---
Still you need the gear and alot of prep to be unstoppable in pve.
---
retail feels like a drug. Its all designed to get you to click queues and redo world quests. I don't like that at all. In vanilla you were free to play how you wanted to.
---
Like all of us.
---
Strength makes no sense for a tank paladin. Strength only improves white physical dmg and adds a tiny amount of block value. Your threat mostly comes from spelldmg. Agility would be better, due to dodge.
---
Going for the 5 basic stats makes little sense to begin with. Even if you were to go with jsut primary stats, oyu should at least add spelldmg. But then again without the secondaries, the usefulness is questionable.
---
Toxic the shit out this game, just like in the good old days!
---
When you say skill expression are you talking skill curve to play?  Its early here and I'm fick
---
Save yourself some trouble and just finish the through till 10 or 11 and then head to the Barrens with them.
---
I would say the overall ramping of gear. Like yourself, I started in TBC and I was in almost entirely the same setup through to Black Temple. In later expansions, gear became so dependent that you were given "catch up" equipment every patch because there was no hope without it. I hear in Vanilla there were people raiding with lv 40+ blues
---
I must be on the wrong end of this, I guess. I would much rather have some asshole tank call me a retard for accidentally pulling an extra pack and wiping the group than get corpse camped for 3 hours.
---
* Runners shouldn't be a problem because you should have pulled the mob/pack back so that it isn't possible for it to run for allies.
---
* Someone shouldn't be pulling an extra mob, because as a tank, it's your job to make the dungeon stupid-proof. 
---
*By more than 2, I assume you mean because the next mob isn't skulled fast enough or not at all. Far too many tanks don't keybind skull so that during stressful situations, they can smoothly organize the next kill by skulling. This prevents people getting too high of threat on a mob that isn't the party's target(or worse, everyone's attacking something different so the tank has no chance of getting the aggro back on everything.) 
---
&gt;Hard to do that when you're mages or other mana dependent dps are behind drinking and consistently running at half mana.
---
Like I said, this isn't a problem as far as I've experienced and I just recently leveled a warrior to 60 tanking every dungeon multiple times. They sustain on half mana &amp; drinking between every other pull until the healers runs out, then there's a full reset. Of course it's all situational and it's not always going to work out like that. But in general, your normal rate of clear can be determined by the healer's mana.
---
I know, but it’s hard thing to do vs good rogues
---
I don’t understand why people insist on making ‘guide’ content that can be summed up in a short list of links to wowhead quests
---
It's going to be so much worse on classic. Good luck out there. The entire endeavor is going to be people trying to show how much more they know about the game than everyone around them.
---
I see no problem hunters sitting on their flare. Spamming aoe spells for 2min trying to find rogue from stealth is also bad manners. Just wasting everyones time, could of done 3 duels by that time.
---
Well at least 3 will play.
---
That's what really blew me back because I myself haven't ran dungeons in a while but have played since 2006 so I know what people are capable of but have yet to myself see a group so divided and short tempered and unforgiving. At least not in a long while. I know not every dungeon or pug is like that. Was just not a good first impression on her. Thanks for the kind words!
---
Yellow = let it mellow
---
You can't even eat people, you get scared,  and you need air.  Orcs are 2/10.
---
sorry, I just want to watch the world burn.
---
Do you never use cat form in 1v1 as Druid? Sorry if it’s a dumb question
---
If you're rolling on a PVP server I'd use this. Despite bgs not being out until p3, having a pet while you're out in the world + still being viable in pve &gt; any PVP without a pet. The damage loss isn't going to matter in MC.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z
---
I live in your future.
---
Old gods: "Am I a joke to you?"
---
Talents and training skills every 2 levels, saving for mount at 40. Vanilla has a more progressive curve while leveling.
---
Yeah but it's still faster to pull and let them drink during half the fight if it's easy trash. The melee will dps meanwhile and it will go faster. If it's a harder pull then Yeah wait.
---
I'm saying as a rogue or mage you have to control your opponent.  Where as a SP is a bit face roll.
---
Not a dumb question at all! You use cat vs. casters and for the openers basically.
---
But in vanilla rogues and warriors do too much damage and will oneshot you in catform :/
---
It is definitely designed to trigger your dopamine receptors thats for sure. *Cough* activision *Cough* Bobby Kotick *Cough*
---
Do you know what a normal distribution is? It definitely doesn’t mean equal representation in each category
---
100% of the time any mechanic that involves a percentage is confusing. There are so many different ways that it can be implemented and it is never specified.
---
I’d say Spriest because too many people play rogues and mages.
---
Fur feels the same with the lights off.
---
Why stop if the healer has full mana? The dps can drink while you fight and join in when they have enough mana, if they have a brain.
---
Wow this bring back so much memories... Big respect guys for being the only serious non hungarian guild on Bloodscalp!   
---
I have some memories about how we fought over Emeriss  
---
GL bois!
---
That's what I was thinking but don't they lack escapes and utility?
---
Mage or Rogue you can see more clear cut plays and outplays and will more engaging to watch. Spriests can be powerful yes but they kind of have a rep of having a bland playstyle. It will be harder to be dynamic on the spriest.
---
Loved the TBC skill set, so most there.
---
As priest:
---
Penance, Pain supression, Vampiric touch, Sw: Death.
---
As druid:
---
Cyclone, Lifebloom
---
Sharing ganking stories?  
---
Anyone remember WoWHobbs? "Hey guys, Hobbs here"   
---
I was leveling in Eastern Plaguelands, level 55 priest when I saw Hobbs there, level 80 (WOTLK days) and I  /wave'd him and he /wave'd back. As I eventually got to level 80 and was doing mine morning mining route through Icecrown I came across Hobbs, mining as well. Of course he didn't remember me but I felt like we came full circle there and I ganked him.
---
On some private servers there's been an abundance of tanks because too many thought this way, remembering how rare tanks were, and wanting to be that rare tank.
---
Actually i think You are remembering things wrong. DK were really tough to kill both in pvp and pve. It did make a difference in wotlk as well, and my DK was definitely more durable than my warlock who was squishy as fuck. 
---
And yeh every class got tougher with pvp gear but there is a reason melee always went for clothies in pvp. Also dk had the best defensives against magic.
---
That’s awesome man hope you get some great videos going 👍
---
I’ll be streaming the stress test and launch on twitch.
---
Holy early on while you have low bonus healing. Generally until you have a majority of the upgrades available during p2, maybe some BWL gear for good measure. PI is better in BWL and on.
---
If the rogue is bad and gets unstealthed it's on him.
---
Bloodlust and Metamorphosis. 
---
Bloodlust is just an iconic shaman spell.  And who wouldn’t want to turn into a winged demon with Metamorphosis.
---
Knew there would be one.
---
I was in middle school and could play only 1 hour a day because my parents had computer time limit. I would spend most of my time running to and from the inn because I wanted rested XP. I got to level 25, and quit.
---
Idk how can ganking horde be boring. You just need to play with right people.
---
Yes, been saying this for months. Either have one on launch or don't have any at all. If they release a RpPvP server later on they will just damage the populations of the unofficial RpPvP realm.
---
OP forgot about Priest Levitate, the skill that worked so good with engineering and wallwalking it gave me plenty of fun times.
---
Stew is a really good and easy option. It's all I eat already.
---
Yeah, I got my spit and laugh macro ready. Also I'm mentally preparing for summoning Infernals in Goldshire.
---
If you think that, then there is also not enough player base for Rp. The polls show that RpPvP is about 3 times as popular than Rp, yet it seems we're only getting Rp and not RpPvP.

&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 8-9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.
---
This is a sarcastic post btw not sure how u can't see that.
---
you with your stupid sword... i got this [[Battle Staff]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2527) how would you tank without it?
---
1-6, Q, E, R, V, G, F, Z, X
---
Then add Ctrl and Shift modifiers for those, should be more than enough.
---
F1-F4 for target party members.
---
Will you guys announce somewhere on which server you will play? Wouldn't mind ending up on the same realm as you.
---
&gt; Where as a SP is a bit face ~~roll~~**melt**.
---
Thanks for the vid, short and to the point, I like it. I noticed you stopped displaying the spells the bosses use on later bosses. Lost some value for the vid there. Hope it helps :)
---
I use an orbweaver. I couldn’t go back to a keyboard now! Best benefits are palm rest, more support for your hand, space bar for thumb. Macro anything you want 👍
---
Whats he even talking about? All of these bosses are awesome and drop sweet loot.
---
There are only a few minor disturbances in Azeroth, and they are either green, blue or dead.
---
So, go to South Korea, live in one of those nifty Internet Cafe's for a while and continue your travels! WoW won't run off on you, though the time (and funds probably) for your travels will :)
---
I haven’t done much pvp at AQ/naxx stage, but I would assume that the hots rolling on yourself in full T3 would be quite good. Also, druids get gimped by the limited duelling space. In the open world they can kite a gressil rogue ad infinitum
---
Yeah, clearly I never did it in Vanilla or anything.
---
The circle jerk of idiots in this subreddit is hilarious.
---
I wont go so far as to say that he doesn't know what he's talking about but its just not true that Spriests have less skill expression. Skill expression is essentially the same thing as skill ceiling. It's how much your skill as a player can be shown by the class. Spriests have an incredibly high skill ceiling, especially in BG's so it's a great class to main for PvP specifically.
---
KEEP YER FEET ONNAE GROUN!
---
Back then we didnt use the Term "Toxic" i would gang the same faction if i saw this word used unironicly by someone.
---
There are so many of you who can't admit classic had some really shitty systems. There are so many people defending stuff that is just obviously shit game design.
---
Shaman you say? That calls for an obligatory Thex comment!
---
Jesus, 14.3% as priest and 12.2% as warlock? Both of the classes that are usually the lesser picked and the ones I was going to roll this round. :(
---
Never had any problems with random rogues. What expansion are you talking about?
---
Paladins definitely outheal priests in BWL at least.
---
And here you are getting hyped to play the most alt unfriendly version of the game. (:
---
That’s an odd compression
---
Death will rise, from the tide! I AM MURLOC
---
Squishy? VW sac, high hp pool, drain life, health stones...thats playing destro too. Locks are great at surviving.
---
That sucks man sorry, just get her playing classic don't even bother with retail. I've only had a little try of private server to get a taste of classic a few months ago, In that time levelling from 1-30 on my mage I had more social interactions than I've had in years in retail. At level 5 I was grouping up to do quests in the cold tooth mine and having a laugh with the people I grouped with. I spend over 2 hours in a 5 man group doing the elite quests in redridge mountains, it was so much fun we formed a guild together after that group. This was just on a private server that was not even very active. In retail classic I think in general the atmosphere will be amazing, any few negative people will be drowned and outnumbered. Anyone who behaves like the people in your group either won't last 5 minutes in classic or they will find they love it so much that their attitude changes. Blizzard have socially engineered this behaviour over the years with easier and easier content but classic will un do all of that.
---
stop
---
Except it's a hunter.
---
Solid choice
---
They lack escapes but not utility. And like every class they have trade offs to make up for the lack of mobility.
---
Also get yourselves in a guild and try to do a guild dungeon with people you've already got to know in the guild, to make sure this doesn't happen the next time you try one.
---
Even better choice is to selling all your shit and get another token and then uninstall
---
Respecs, will end up being,100g a week. Consumables and engineering mats.
---
It's the case in retail now tho
---
Yeah I totally get you, was stressing a little on what class to main but I realised I'm only really gonna play the game fairly casually so there's no rush. Gonna start with a lock and if he's not fun I'll try a rogue or whatever else takes my fancy.
---
You Sir, are breathtaking
---
I won't say it's better, but it is faster to just blow pull. I think most rogue do that.
---
Followed by sounds best enjoyed on my tinny cell phone speaker, no doubt.
---
people who don't play retail wow, and instead play private servers or classic
---
Make sure to leave a piece of food in every chest also so that new players can experience real disappointment. Bonus points for Kolkar Booty chests.
---
&gt; some mediocre bonuses that are slightly better than Shadows reduced fear timer and useless filler
---
Agreed - you get 5% crit, .5s on your Smite, 10% damage on both Holy Fire and Smite - it's actually fairly nice.
---
The only thing that stopped me deleting my characters was the amount of time I put into them but I certainly won't be going back to that POS version of wow. Good choice in deleting.
---
You'd probably need a server specific one
---
I don't get why you'll ever need this 
---
I always had standard keyboard and 2 side button mouse and never ran out of binds
---
For me it's the opposite. I haven't played retail in eight years. Might as well give it a whirl, if I resub for classic anyway.
---
I have my talent tree sorted, i mean the tips about sleep patterns and caffeine tolerance levels.
---
Welcome to gaming.
---
Servers are not out yet to my knowledge which throws a spanner in the works!
---
squishy? PFFFFFFFF
---
Oh yes! This is the worst system ever. I love pvp and will play a lot of it - but will never have time to get above rank 10 for sure. If 10 even gonna be possible. I don't mind only a few people can get to top rank - but the way it happened was super unhealthy and only shared accounts had a chance. The way people was running honor group was nothing to do with PvP... When top ranks actually started to arena they were often shit pvp'ers.
---
I think it will be 11 million.
---
That's the spirit.  So many people are so set on rushing their way to "pre-bis" and all that stuff, it's crazy.    Hope you enjoy it!
---
That's when you let him tank, and tell the healer to let him feel the pain.
---
No need to be rude , he can play how he wants.
---
sickening.  i feel really bad for the people who have no idea whats going on and are unlucky enough to end up on a big streamer server
---
Sodapoppins name was taken on the beta and he had to name his Druid chance.
---
Just tell them that 12 million ppl played it at one time, combine all MMORPG of that time and you won't even come near, so if they want to live without playing the best MMORPG of all time....
---
I can‘t decide between shaman und priest either. Right now I tend towards shaman because I never played on back in the day. I like the supportive style of the class and I think they will be in demand
---
I, um, leveled as a Prot Warrior in Vanilla. I dumped all my talent points into the Prot tree. I couldn't figure out why it would take me so much longer to kill everything.  Eventually, I gave up and never hit 60 in Vanilla.  
---

I remember an add-on that simply parsed the chat logs for lfm/off messages and output them into a separate window which made it easier to not miss it in a fast moving chat.

Do mages rly need spirit? For what?
---
Watch Payo’s cooking streams
---
Your time sense is really off. If you started at release and needed 20 days played to max level, then quit for two years. TBC would have already been out, when you leveled your gnome mage.
---
If Naxx was already out, when you leveled your mage and you then took a year break, TBC would have been out for 8-9 months, when you returned.
---
More likely, you are looking at around a year break after the hunter and 3-4 months break after the mage.
---
All three has potential for 1v2. From the three only Mage is really good in larger scale fights. I’d go Mage.
---
Level cap was pegged at 75 and stayed there for years and years (through several expansions), so automatically the issue of forced obsolescence was greatly diminished.  Expansions mostly brought horizontal progression (IE, items weren't necessarily stat upgrades, but provided other unusual or interesting effects that you couldn't get anywhere else), with _just enough_ vertical progression to scratch that itch without completely invalidating legacy gear.
---
I don't think many of XI's paradigms would slot into WoW as it exists today very well.  That said, it's a shining example of how you can _build_ on a world in an MMO (and it is a _true_ MMO-- one of the greatest of all time; it's not an ARPG like Diablo) rather than invalidating content every patch.  I was distressed to see FFXIV follow WoW's example.  XIV is a successful MMO (or, at least, the re-released version of it is-- we don't talk about the 2010 version), but I think that has more to do with the fact that Japan never really got WoW.  This is their first exposure to something like that, so they're still in the honeymoon phase with it.
---
Because you dont have enough talent points to do that.
---
I'll be at work. RIP my preferred names.
---
The geography of both chokepoints to each side's base is vastly different. Alliance was designed with tough choke points and great LOS for their archers in the towers while Horde has... none of that. Horde has to win by turtling near their initial spawn to stop the initial base race, and slowly pushing forward during that respawn advantage and take the bases methodically (how the BG was designed to be played) but this results in less honor (and more effort/coordination) than simply bending over, doing a few objectives, and letting Alliance win it quickly. Since most players only care about Honor per Hour and not actual honor of winning the BG... this is what you get.
---
Hehe, I don't actually know what any of these mean tbh.
---
Don't forget that the nightelfs caused the first burning legion invasion!
---
You  probably take 4-5times longer to kill stuff than a regular dps.  But doing that first time playing meant that I suffered the worst levelling spec without knowing and I'm a more resilient person for it. Follow your dreams
---
I could pretty much deal with everything about Vanilla, *except* no summoning stones. 
---
I can get more than the dungeon's worth of xp by grinding mobs for the exact amount of time it would take me just to run to something like BFD or SM.
---
I'd love to run dungeons, group with folks and make friends, but there's literally no point to it. At least if you're a hunter.
---

I'm sure

Let's say classic gets 5M players on launch, a low estimate compared to how many players come back for each expansion, 80% of 5M is still 1 million players. Even if only 3M players tried classic, 80% of 3M is still 600K more than enough players to keep 5+ realms populated. Even worst case only 1.5 million try classic, that's still 300k active players left over. Nostalrius had less than this and was always populated at all times of the day.
---
Happy Cake Day!! And I agree - no Need for that. Servers will be so filled you'll find a dungeon Group in 30mins no Problem. Also you still have to fly to the dungeon which takes some times in itself... Not much time to safe with LFG and just not Classic...
---
shadow is not the best leveling spec and i have no idea what research you did. disc is by far the most effective with spirit tap and wand
---
One I remember to this day. I was grinding Silver in Eastern Plaguelands in an area I thought would be vacant (who but a Paladin would be grinding the Undead in the far Northeastern part of the map)
---
Lo and behold in the middle of me grinding, a level 58 Tauren Warrior named Pitfighter wearing Lightforged Pauldrons charges me while I have a mob on me. Being a level 60 in mostly Blues but with a decent Stratholme weapon I finish off the mob and then grind down the Warrior who cant damage me enough to kill me through all of my self healing.
---
I kill him, he rezzes somewhere I don't notice and does it again. Over and over, just TRYING to get the jump on me to kill me. After a while of this, I finally realize the constant fighting is ruining the reason for my being out there in the first place so I just leave.

Months and months later, after I've spent time raiding, and in the Honor Grind I am now more than familiar with this Warrior who has earned a reputation as a ganker and high level PvPer who prefers to dual wield.  I'm out in Silithus with my guild mates grinding the repeatable quests out there for rep.
---
We run into his group killing some other Alliance in the area. Our two groups meet and square off, he and I exchange some /taunts /waves and /rudes but not actually engaging in combat unless someone from the opposing faction walks by.
---
I can only assume that he must have remembered me from our evening out in EPL because he never bothered to gank my group but DID attack any other Alliance in the area, even if they were as geared as we were.
---
What are the chances we're all on at exactly 1 minute to, with name in hand, ready to reserve it with that male warrior instant click, then we notice it's like the stress test where we get endless loading and character create lag, and then someone has already taken my beloved but unique choice of "legolas"
---
Thought I could see some Norrlandsguld in there :)
---
I'm probably going to re-start as well after having quit during when Cata was launched, looking forward to some nostalgia. Unfortunately I have 0 contact with my old guildies.
---
Excuse me, my personal hero is Broxigar the Red.
---
Top 3 Classic macros that will make you C R I N G E
---
Thanks!
---
And yeah, one of the big things wanted for classic, was the enforced human contact, putting a bit of mm, back into mmorpg
---
If you have time before your time off you could take some time to make some meals that are good to eat cold such as pasta dishes,sandwiches and even stuff that can be warmed up in the microwave like soups, burgers and hot dogs and get some noodle's that you can cook with kettle water other than that just make sure you eat a variety and take some form of breaks while playing otherwise you will just feel worse and worse as time goes on.
---
Who the fuck would need that? You notice all the keys on that keyboard? Use them.
---
If you want to 1vX reliably, I'd take mage, they can also 1v2 when you're totally outgeared which gives them better potential for phases 5+6. It feels that rogues struggle more when outgeared since with bad gear you'll need to rely more on blind in 1v1 rather than having a second target blinded. Spriest cannot 1v2 when outgeared unless they have no pvp trinket/fear breaker and you can nuke one target while the other is feared.
---
If you're going to be clearing Naxx, take any of those three classes.
---
Well it's not mine, but our future guild leader rogue stacked spirit for better energy regen.
---
Is it comfortable to have to use two keyboard and not be able to use wasd when you use your second keyboard? Lol, please.
---
And half of the priest will run a shadow build.
---
I thought the game could use a group finder tool when Vanilla was fresh. I was always surprised and baffled it didn't. Even older games like DAoC had one.
---
As long as it doesn't auto group I don't see the harm in it, especially if one was put in game. But say that on this sub and the turbo nerds come marching with their torches and down votes.
---
Ice Lance 
---
It just fits right into the frost mage kit
---
Elves are just mutated trolls. Everything wrong with the world (of Warcraft) can be blamed on trolls.
---
True, but mages never outperform melees. One mages always does due to the ignite dote but the pack is behind the warriors!
---
Except you have to buy the game also for like 60$
---
&gt; They just gotta stop trying so hard to make it suck.
---
They aren't trying to make it suck it's just that it's the best 2019 Blizzard can do.
---
Nope, they will just sell the leather to a vendor to make gold for the lvl 40 mount.
---
Unfortunately, it is all the dwarves fault as their bickering was the sole cause for Ragnaros coming to Azeroth. 
---

---
The sheer, unmitigated might of ruthlessly slaughtering every single solitary Horde in your path.
---
yeah, it's not that video. I remember the video OP talks about. It's a vanilla video and it was quite well made for the time.
---
Off and on. I get in moods where nothing seems like fun while I wait for the game to release but then I get into something and enjoy it for a few days. I feel less excited and more just ready to get the grind to 60 over so I can start having the real fun.
---
Fruit smoothies, sandwiches, and wraps are a good bet. If you are going to be eating while playing, don't eat any food that needs to stay hot/cold in order to be edible. Also avoid stuff that will be messy.
---
It's kind of you to work backwards from his conclusion trying to make best sense of it, but it's too generous. Minkelz is so crap at theorycrafting, I gave them an RES tag just to remind myself not to waste too much time on their posts.
---
Hi, I like the sound of your guild!
---
However, your discord invite link seems to be broken?
---
It starts at midnight for me so I imagine i'll probably get into the game by 2 am maybe and then get a couple quests done before sleeping.
---
30/0/21 ? Or 31.
---
Just another reason to stay anonymous on wow....
---
Baby don't hurt me
---
any other streamers to avoid in Europe (maybe even Germany if you know some there)?
---
Lol, no you want Stam and Int.
---
Fear might be nerfed but I still remembers Snutz's fear never ever breaking during the lv30-&gt;40 beta, strongest PvP CC in the game past poly.
---
I rushed to my phone to tell my story soon as I read this thread on my work computer haha! 
---
So I started at TBC launch really, I made a blood elf paladin because all my friends said play horde paladin because they are OP. I realise now the total novelty of horde paladin in TBC. 
---
So I was questing away, auto attacking as you do as a paladin, I was around level 22/23ish and I began to moan to my friends levelling was really slow, they said it generally is etc etc so I sigh and get on with it ... come level 27ish I am still moaning about just how annoying levelling is, they begin to question what I am doing. They ask if I am using judgement for damage. I tell them it requires seals and I've no idea where to buy them, I had asked in chat and no1 helped me. 
---
That's right. I thought seals where spells you had to BUY each time. I didn't even consider clicking the spell to see what it would do, I just assumed it was a picture and a description of what the seal "item" done..... I was auto attacking mobs till around level 27 with nothing other than my trusty mace and healing spells. 
---
I fucking LOVE world of Warcraft 😂
---
Demolia and 33 dwarves
---
Since when did druids have a koala form?
---
Fair enough! Only other class I'm really considering is rogue, just to give back to all the gankers back in the day. Should I go down this dark path, I wonder..
---
Ah yea, I had a brain fart, derp. Edited my post to fix it.
---
My point still stands though, as a Hunter I plan to not worry about mount money and just focus on leveling. Once I hit 48 I'm gonna start grinding at various spots I know are good for gold.
---
I do enjoy a good grind, it's something I can sit back, relax, and do for hours at a time. I'll probably end up simply grinding my way from 48-60. It'll slow my leveling speed down some, but I'll be rich as fk by the time I hit 60.
---
remembver you can do /e emotes to really rub the salt in
---
Don't feed the trolls
---
Main complaint about TBC compared to Vanilla is that instances starts to feel like a coridor with a boss at each corner instead than an actual city, manor, whatever that happens to have bosses inside.
---
take that back!
---
Same here, I've never been so bored of CS:GO
---
It would also help if a certain Guardian of Tirisfal didn't try to snort demonic cocaine and do some summoning.
---
Red=dead. If you see the opposite faction you attack. Doesn't matter if they are grey. This is war
---
Not a dwarf?  
---
You better reroll or we /gkick you, and make sure to hide his teeth even if its covered by a beard, that's just disgusting!
---
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time of a time when I tried so hard &amp; got so far
---
What the actual fuck? Druid is the only hybrid class that can actually get away with fulfilling every role in raids. Paladins? You just heal. Priests? You just heal or spam rank 1 spells to proc SW. Shamans? You just heal. Druid?
---
...You heal, off-tank and DPS. Stop being a baby.
---
Live to win, 'til you die

'Til the light dies in your eyes

Live to win, take it all

Just keep fighting, 'til you fall

LIVE TOO WIIEIN!

That's fine, healer ain't spending mana on you if you're not getting hit.
---
guys who play classic are to bad for retail
---
&gt;100% of the time
---
wait how much of the time I'm confused
---
Paying my wife to take the kids and fuck off all day on the 31st since I have that day off work. Gotta do what you gotta do 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
My man. I wish i could roll tauren, but all my friends and i are rolling alliance this time. Gnome it is then.
---
Ofc Horde have honor, that's why I'll grind them over and over in Phase 2!
---
I'm on vacation when classic launches, but return on thursday evening.
---
My girlfriend will be gone on saturday and sunday. I will play SO MUCH! (And hopefully miss the starting zone overpopulation. Not looking forward to killing Sarkoth, when 300 other people attempt the same thing.
---
There's literally a post right above this one about how you shouldn't be toxic.
---
Fuck you people and your negative opinions, clearly OP doesn't give a shit that they can just use their keyboard, and neither does the rest of the world - stop being so unnecessarily elitist, if OP likes playing the game with this setup, more power to them.
---
You're right. And I'd say that it'll be a majority of these guilds that are the most hardcore, if that's what you're looking for in classic. Being 60 in the first week would put you ahead of a lot of people socially.
---
Orcs are also better suited for lock melee spec.. just saying.
---
WOTF is still a solid pvp talent which will give you an edge up on ally locks and spriest. Theres also cannabilism which is probably my favorite of all racials(actually can get some use from it if you are in a group or win the 1v1, but mostly its just cool).
---
Ehm no.. +Healing just changes what you downrank to..
---
Check out leeway comments from beta testers. Tauren leeway is so strong.
---
Feeling something similar, was messing around on private servers but since I’ve quit to build up hype it’s hard to pass the time.
---
Started up a new play through of morrowind so hopefully a different flavor of nostalgia will help
---
Well I did it too in original vanilla.  I had 5 druids.  19,29,39,49,60. I got the bright idea to go ahead and level the 49 to 60 solely for use in 60 PvP.  So it became 19,29,39,60,60... It was great actually, you get really good at one class playing like that. I'll definitely do it again since Classic is a static game, and there should be plenty of time.  This time with Paladin I think.
---
Rest of the guild avoided a bullet, lol
---
If you are a tank in Vanilla, you won't be raged at. It was always hard to find tanks and healers in Vanilla. People would put up with a lot / go out of their way to keep you in the group til the end. 
---
And also, in general its harder to replace group members in dungeons. No LFG to just auto pop someone in.
---
Your info is outdated.
---
They nerfed leveling speed to a boring slog to sell character boosts.
---
Everyone usually just leave me alene when leveling.. I Hope to see some action on the classic servers. :) i always start shit up. Stv is my playground
---
It was possible but people have decided to complain about FotM arena teams and Blizzard ended up gutting every single class in chase of balance. People like to blame casuals for homogenization but casuals don't care if their class does 15% less burst damage. It's "hardcore" players who want everything equally balanced and when every single spec performs roughly the same they still want every single spec to be equal in utility.
---
Hey OP, thanks for sharing, reminds me of the good old time...
---
Can you tell us What’s the gear level of the rogue? It seems that you have at least T2+ r13, so quite a decent gear, but from my experience it was really difficult to survive if the rogue was out gearing you. (Was mainly in t1/t2 at the time and AQ rogue were slaying me hard

**Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders !**
---
~ Open for (almost) all classes ~
---
​
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, we are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy in both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, those raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 80% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Intended raid/play times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to raid on Mon, Wed and Sun, from 19:00 (CET Timezone). Each raiding session will last around 3-4 hours.
---
**Aditional info:**
---
While the guild will be very active on the PvP scene, &lt;Hate&gt; will remain a raiding guild at it’s core;
---
Regarding the loot system, we intend to implement our own DKP system, however Loot Council is still not off the table yet (it depends if we can finish in time our custom DKP addon).
---
**Bottom line:**
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/ ​ or check our Discord here https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
​P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

Could you elaborate? Do you place the Worldmap folder containing all the other zone folders in the Interface folder, or do you put all the the zone folders in the Interface folder?
---
If one summons a demon, the fault for summoning a demon falls 100% on the summoner. It's not 50/50 demon's fault for being summoned. Same situation here.

This guy on youtube tests things like this. Seems like its running ok.

---
Spirit isn't as great on rogues as it is on warriors, if you are wondering. So, not genius.
---
Close to Burning steps. And contested Alliance zone.
---
For a warrior, in both pve and pvp, id suggest Engineering and mining. Engineering is a great damage boost for AoE tanking, the grenades is a most in pvp and also adds damage for AoE pulls in 40 mans. Mining to supply and possibly make a few bucks :) 
---
But thats just my two cents
---
Ironic that the turbo nerds prefer the more social way to get a group together.
---
Sanity restored; bless you
---
I think druid has the potential to be the best 1v1 class in classic. Druids have the tools to handle almost anything with proper gear/prep like batman.I see too many bad druids that don't utilize their full kit and lose fights they should have won or at least got away from.
---
Pretty sure all of us were the bad guys in TBC.
---
Priest is extremely important in pvp for both factions, even if it's not as durable as a paladin for the alliance, and doesn't have as much burst potential as a shaman.
---
Priest has the only magic dispel in the horde, and the only purge in the alliance. Also some of the best utility spells and decent buffs.
---
It's by far the most versatile healer I'd say.
---
your name is UBIisLazy. stfu kid
---
You're conveniently forgetting that all Orcs are interstellar invaders
---
Sell the acc with the modern trash blizz games and you can pay for a lot of subs!
---
No one wants to be a part of some dude's power fantasy and have to deal with all his orbiters hungry for 1 minute of e-fame.
---
What they need to do is make pvp entirely separate. They had the right idea in Legion imo: talents specific to pvp, gear isn’t important. That way you can have competitive pvp (by having an even playing field) without diluting the rest of the game. Wpvp should not be touched.
---
I think it will be a small impact, and classic will mostly draw in the old school players that will play it casually. i also think the classic will drop in numbers quickly until it steady out, as a lot of returning players will have very fond memories of classic but be disappointed.
---
They actually joined the Horde to escape the sea witch and her army of murlocs.
---
Not if you asign shift and control to your side mouse buttons (thumb). Except if auto-run is more important :)
---
there is no true holy/disc optimal builds there are 2 popular builds both are hybrids. If anything disc is more often used for more full effect(spirit buff and power infusion) where as using spirit healer and lightell seems to invite nothing but criticism(even though with a well trained group lightwell is about 10x more efficient than other spells). a major difference for more modern versions of the game is that PWS is likely if used inappropriately or in the presence of the uneducated to cause quite a bit of criticism(its also not very efficient for frequent use).
---
Haha a friend of mine is getting married on the 30th. Told him that he should cancel the wedding.
---
Is there any global companies that dont do this?...
---
When can we download and install the classic client?
---
That's why I can't play anything but a tank.
---
The fact that you said “Tauren tank” and you didn’t mention a single spec’s name in your entire paragraph is proving my point.
---
its not that i dont appreciate the work the mods do for the community but this was a genuine question which could, in my opinion, reduce the amount of 'Did name reservation start yet?'-threads and thus reduce the amount of work they have to do.
---
Some people use reddit as their own google army, why not shove the information straight in their face? :x
---
Mostly ex-players imho. There will be people who realise what they were missing out on too of course, but I wouldn't expect it to suddenly kill retail or anything.
---
DLC used to be called expansions.
---
It just adds to how cool this is. Imagine the rollercoaster!
---
You are correct that I’m wearing T2 and three pieces of rank 12/13 gear for the speed bonus. However, the rogue is wearing full R14 gear, so his damage is pretty wild. Gotta stay on point with shapeshifting against geared rogues like that.
---
Yeah we talking the same thing I think.  Thx for clarifying
---
People are downvoting because of the sheer number of times a week this same topic is posted by people. It's not that people don't love you, they just don't want to see these in the top upvoted posts any more because for many its just the same thing repeated.
---
I was going to main a priest originally, but not being rewarded for healing in BGs was kind of a dealbreaker for me it turns out. I think I will just have an alt Priest instead and see if I can pug my way up to Tier 2 and benediction on off-days. I've always enjoyed rogues and never mained one in retail so decided to take the opportunity for a fresh start this time round. I know theyre not the best in PvP but they are more fun than any other class to just mess around with out in the world. I'd still love to be a prot warrior. I'd still love to play a mage like I did back in the day. Sooner or later you just gotta decide though.
---
I agree with you 100%. I will try to upload duels against every class so people can see the potential of druids.
---
Its only going to boost retail. They get a ton of extra subscriptions that's really good for them.
---
That's nice and all but when it comes to common loot don't expect priority or even a fair go if you inisit on being a meme spec.
---
Unfortunately, I think Discord is going to irradiate the need for them.
---
Ah right, ty.
---
I assume its possible to create a character as quickly as possible to reserve the name and then delete later during launch to properly customise class / appearance?
---
Depends what purpose you want arenas to have. An everything goes format that simply serves as another way to pvp? Or a competitive esport? If the first you’re certainly right, but a competitive esport requires an even playing field. They could succeed with that too imo if they just keep it entirely separate: pvp specific talents that only activate in pvp and all gear scaled to be equal (fun trinkets etc can be allowed to work in regular bgs but not in rated).
---
&gt;Hurricane
---
Are you high?
---
Sm ruinnnnnnn
---
My friend asked me, in a serious tone the other day, "which day was it again?". I can confirm that he is no longer my friend.
---
True. And before that, expansions were commonly called addons. At least where I'm from.
---
Modified Retail client lmaooooo. This is so funny holy shit. It's like you guys can non stop spewing bullshit. Blizz themselves said they even changed how the game process ingame data so they able to lower the 5gb (true 1.12) to the 3gb.
---
Don’t stoop down to their level
---
Dang.

I was reading this and go so mad, because i got banned for 48 hours for not returning someones leather ball lol.

For so many years every time a new MMORPG came out people were wondering if it's going to be the "WoW-killer".
---
Who could actually imagine that it's going to be wow that kills wow :P.
---
59 Mana/swing is insanely good. Depending on how much spirit you have, that's between 50% and 100% faster mana-regeneration. Imagine it is actually planned for you to do that and not just as an emergency.
---
With the "taking-turns"-approach rather than cast'n'cancel the shared manapool of all healers is like 2-3 times as big and trumps all savings made by downranking while not requiring to compromise the HPS of higher ranks. And it only gets better the longer the fight takes.
---
y'all are so dramatic damn lol

Dude you're actually fucking retarded. Just read my statement above. I don't need to technically explain to you how the IDX files inside the Classic folder is literally the same as .DLLs in the original Vanilla 1.12. Blizz themselves modified it to change how the client process ingame data. Next time learn how to code or use Google.
---
Gambling is only against the EULA if it is in a public channel like /s or /2, within guilds or parties it is allowed.
---
It musn't have been, because I did arena to get the offhand.
---
10% of 100% of the time
---
Same here! Been creating some characters to get set on what I'll main in classic. Done with that now so trying to stay away as well.
---
If you're still playing retail nothing is gonna stop you now.
---
you should put this in every new post at the end!
---
13GB for a 1.12 is pure bullshit. Just read tge Stress Test post from Blizz it's only fucking 3GB holyshit, why am I arguing with idiots who can't use their computers. I literally downloaded the Client yesterday for 3gb with no Retail. That's why I am asking for a bet so you retards learn how to shut the fuck up.
---
Nice! Played through it with my big brother a couple of months ago. No challenge really but was a fun co-op experience. :)

Thanks for the tips, but I doubt that my laptop can handle either. :(
---
This machine was built for classic.
---
Yeah the changed it in part by porting it to the current version of the game engine e that bad uses. It's a remake of 1.12 in the current engine. They began development by porting it to legion and have continued to update it alongside bfa. They even talked about how they had to port 1.12 data to the current engine at Blizzcon last year.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22646759/restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel-recap
---
It really depends on the encounter. If the throughput of 4-5 healers isn't enough, then of course the others won't just keep wanding.
---
But as I said elsewhere, if healers have to, and they don't have to conserve their mana, because that's part of the plan, as there's someone available to take over, they can usually increase their throughput to over 1k HPS.
---
Nice to hear from someone alike! I understood what you just said a few months ago, playing Overwatch with a couple I have met in a Match. They've been nice and weebs and everything was really fun. Then we played together and when I saw pictures I was like.. what? No way! I would have NEVER assumed they'd be weebs when seeing them on the street f.e.. This made me realize how naive I was always thinking I could understand people by their looks.
---
Currently trying to stabilize in life and then look for someone who accepts, but also likes who I am.
---
He's still right. They are based on the same client.
---
You should learn some social skills and take a communications class if you think anyone takes you seriously, when you write like that.
---
Something that hasn't existed in retail since dungeon finder was added.

I used to demand Bo3 if they used a huge cooldown. (lay on hands is the only one I remember)

Player looking for NA-Alliance or Horde guild on a PvP server.

Hi all, 
---
Original wow classic player looking for a guild to relive the excitement of classic. I'm a laid back mature young professional looking for a like minded group.
---
I work the night shift so my play times are majority in the afternoon 12 noon to 6pm. So with that I'd like to join a guild that plays around that time. 
---
I am open to both pvp and raiding.
---
Will be playing either holy priest or healing pally/shaman
---
Thanks 
---
MP
---
Or take his laptop and have some macros ready
---
I don’t agree for dungeons and Shadow 
---
If I got CC covered then  a shadow priest is top notch dps for solo mobs.  And there is very little AoE in dungeons.   And slow affects most dungeon mobs. 
---
We used to run Sholo/Strat with two shadow priest if  possible and letting VE heal.  The utility with 2MC 2Shackle is so extreme.  As long as they got a macro to drop form and toss a heal on MT if he gets low it’s fantastic.   
---
The rest is pretty correct tho.  Holy priest have a tendency to die fast in BG as they are picked on.  
---
For leveling yes it’s wanding but you also is extremely mana efficient you come out of a fight with high mana/hp all the time meaning you can chain mobs faster.   (Shadow 5pts) not as Good as hunters /locks but certainly faster then warriors.
---
A hunter raiding as his pet.
---
Maybe they should not stream then^^

Sorry to hear you lost your job.

Congrats to hear you have found some time to grind WoW Classic.

You are really asking the wrong community. Everyone here will respond with a resounding "Yes".
---
Probably Teamfight Tactics :) Keep up with the trend!
---
+healing is always going to be good. Int and spirit are both good for opposite things. Int gives you extra mana to use in an encounter and spirit let's you regen mana faster while not casting. Both help you heal but it can change which you need depending on what your doing.
---
Sorry I can't really decide. 40 man Raids + Server Community - not new randoms in every activity

Intro: The foundation of AP is a group of friends that love video games, raunchy banter, and cannot wait for Classic’s release! Welcoming everyone – from the most experienced to ‘I’ve never played WoW before’. While we will be progressive in PvE content, it will be at our pace (we all have lives: careers, families, school, etc.). Will also have scheduled WPvP &amp; BGs events - because who doesn’t enjoy killing gnomes.  
---
 Expectations: For any member it is to have fun and enjoy the game! Aimed at those that wish to raid, the expectation is to meet the raid schedule, come prepared with BiS/pots, and know the fights (or at least do some research beforehand).

I am super into Destiny 2 at the moment, I'm extremely greatful for this as I'd be climbing the walls if i didn't. I'm super pumped for the next big content expansion coming out on the first of October too.
---
But Classic will be out by then, I have never been able to half play a game, I'm an all or nothing kind of guy. So, I'm extremely conflicted at the moment.
---
I'm with you dude, been trying to play other games but nothing is doing it for me. Warcraft 3 has been helping some though. Plus refreshing me on all the lore.
---
Yeah, missing bash against a geared rogue is almost a death sentence. Luckily taurens get war stomp, which can be a life saver. 
---
Being NE and have a rogue dodging your bash is the worst feeling, hehe.
---
I'm thinking Thex (please don't steal my name though)
---
Those pictures are really heartwarming.
---
All of my guildmates have got on with their life. Wife, kids, long hours at work, they don't have any more time to play the game, even casually.
---
I recently tried contacting them one by one, but so far it seems that no one is willing to start again. I'm the only one who'll get back to play, even casually, like 2-3 hours a week just to enjoy the quests and lore again, get through dungeons and helping people out.
---
Anyway, see you on Azeroth, whoever you are!
---
I honestly think quite a big chunk of players will be dropped from retail. Especially because the most popular WoW streamers are going to play classic, and so attract even more people. I think the population of retail is going to drop by a big amount nobody excepts.
---
Played in german when I started in TBC. Agility in german is Beweglichkeit which not only means agility, but mobility as well.
---
So at the start i tried to stack as much agility as possible because I thought I would run faster.
---
Thanks! Will try when I get home.

---
&gt; Activision Blizzard formed when Activision merged with Blizzard from Vivendi Games in 2009.
---
Didn't Activion merge with Vivendi and not with Blizzard? I thought the story here was that Vivendi owned Blizzard and because the Blizzard brand was much more recognizable than Vivendi they decided the new company would have a subsidiary name in it.
---
OP sounds like a real asshole. I’ll make sure to gank you when I see you, f-face.
---
***&lt;Trouble&gt; [EU-Horde-PvP]*** is a community-driven, progression-focused, English-speaking raiding guild. We've been playing online games together for upwards of 15 years, and we've picked up a whole bunch of great players and good friends along the way. We have a wide array of players from all across Europe, and beyond, with varying different levels of experience. 
---
We have players who have reached high heights in both PvE and PvP across various expansions, but also others that have never even played vanilla WoW before. With this in mind, we are creating an inclusive guild where everyone is welcome, as long as they're enthusiastic and willing to play with us to the best of their ability.
---
***Leveling*** - 
---
There will be no rush to level 60. We will begin raids as soon as we have the force to do so, but if it takes you a couple of weeks longer than other people, nobody cares. You will probably be able to join the early birds once you get there. Take your time; enjoy the experience. 
---
***Raiding*** - 
---
We will be raiding two nights a week (all times are in **Server Time (CET)**):
---
**Sunday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
**Tuesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
Come Phase 3 (BWL), an additional raid night will be added to revisit older raid tiers:
---
**Wednesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
All participants are expected to bring their own consumables. You don't have to be doing top tier DPS/HPS, but you do need to respect the rest of the guild enough to bring what you need to be functional in a raid.
---
**Loot System** - 
---
Our loot system will be a very simple, closed bid DKP system with partial decay to help deter hoarding. Name a more iconic duo than loot council and drama.
---
When the third raid day is introduced in Phase 3 (BWL), it is worth noting that it will NOT use the DKP system, and all items will be rolled (main-spec priority, as usual) between raiders who want them. The reason for this is that a lot of people in the guild can only raid two days a week, tops, and they should not feel like they have to come to this raid in order to keep up on DKP for the main tier raids.
---
**Classes** - 
---
Like any other guild, we would prefer the dominant classes with meta specs. However, we do believe that the player comes above the class and spec in a lot of circumstances. If you're dedicated, positive and willing to listen, those things go an exceptionally long way.
---
With that in mind, we are willing to give most people a shot, with the caveat that those classes and specs with a generally weak performance may find it harder to earn a permanent raid spot. If you are very confident in your ability to play an off-meta spec that isn’t listed below to an acceptable level, feel free to contact us:
---
**Druid** - **OPEN (Restoration) / CLOSED (Feral (Tank))** //
---
**Hunter** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Mage** - **OPEN (Frostbolt spam)** //
---
**Priest** - **CLOSED)** //
---
**Rogue** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Shaman** - **OPEN (Restoration) / CLOSED (Elemental, Enhancement)** //
---
**Warlock** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Warrior** - **OPEN (Fury) / CLOSED (Protection)**
---
**Classes that are closed are still welcome to join, but you probably won’t be able to raid wiht us unless/until we have a huge turnover of people.**
---
***Contact*** - 
---
We’d love to answer any questions you may have. The best way to contact us is by joining our Discord:
---
https://discord.gg/Wj2fMHP
---
You can also talk to an officer directly on Discord:
---

---
god damnit i agreed to start a business with my friend so now i have way less time to play &gt;:(
---
casserole - takes like 5 minutes to make, rest is oven time
---
Anything fruity/vegetables to snack nearby (you really won't get hungry if you just eat them nearby)
---
Anything you can make a ton of. Salad is limited by bowl size, any Stew, Pasta. And if you want to be a little creative till launch - make some Burgers until release. Self made Burgers even taste fantastic after hours. Based on this you could also make Tacos or buy Kebab.
---
The biggest con is that you’ll waste months farming a mount and you’ll miss out on phase 1 and most of phase 2.
---
Well thats like just your opinion man.
---
I think every class being able to do everything just waters down class identity.
---
Are you saying that WoW can self terminate?
---
It's amazing how a troll thread gets so many responses
---
Love you too dawg
---
That makes complete sense now thanks for taking the time! Really appreciate it
---
Don't worry I'll be tanking 5 mans and UBRS like fucking crazy for the first few month or so. Do you know how much gear a wannabe dps war / offtank needs to farm pre-raid to get a spot? a Fuck ton. You'll find me spamming LF DPS constantly.
---
I'm going to be streaming the whole time cause I enjoy it. I'm a very small streamer though. It'll actually give me a bit more of a nostolgia feeling since I spend most of my time in vanilla talking to people with ventrillo on and getting lots of messages on msn. This time I'll be talking with a chat watching me instead, but it still adds back that experience of communicating with others while playing.
---
" Players with an active subscription or game time on their World of Warcraft account"
---
Does this mean that even if I don't have an active subscription, but I've subscribed in the past, I'll be able to reserve my name? :O
---
Its not impersonating them if you just take the name and never play on it
---
Drawings are cute tho.
---
This clip is pure gold holy shit, the first time I saw it I almost pissed myself laughing
---
If it turns out to be a major success they will tell the numbers. Big if ofc
---
I did the same a couple of days ago
---
Almost 2 years of waiting and that didnt feel too hard.. but as it get closer the waiting gets 10x harder.. Feels so long. I just want to fkin play.

You definately should play WoW instead of visiting that friend. It's not like WoW will be around forever.
---
+healing is for sure the most important. If you are good at downranking and willing to put gold into consumables, mana shouldn't be too much of an issue. 
---
Now paladin is looking for all the crit it can get. This allows you to basically have infinite mana because when you crit you get your mana back for that spell. Problem is crit gear is pretty sparse until later raids. Spirit is fairly useless on paladin as you don't have any mana return will casting so you are looking for mana per 5 seconds for the first few raid tiers. 
---
Shaman is similar to paladin, but doesn't scale with crit. Look for +healing and mp5.
---
Druid being selfish with innervate will be fine on mana. Especially if you grab a decent spirit weapon that you can equip in combat during innervate. If you need to give your innervate away, you may want to invest in a little more spirit and mp5.
---
Its a different kind of grind. In Retail, the Daily grind limit can easily be reached by most players, so it turns into a chore that needs to be done every day. In Classic, you can grind ar your own pace and never "miss a day", as very few things are time gated.
---
As someone who hates healing with a passion and misses **not** having to heal, I greatly appreciate you guys for existing.
---
I like the old /fart /smell
---
If youre leveling a Shaman, no matter what spec you want Int/stam first as well. 
---
That said, cool graphic dude, nice work on the colors and the class icons
---
I loved this spell when leveling my paladin in cataclysm. I went full prot all the way to 80.
---
How can you say that shadow is neutral? It’s one of the quickest classes to level... 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
I did it on my NE rogue back in the day. I watched my guild head to Outlands while I ran the same quests over and over and over and over and so on and so forth. I didn't do Outlands quests until I had my mount. It took months and took me from level 58 to 60.  
---
The ice giants were elites. I don't remember getting rich from it. In fact, I spent a small fortune in gold on potions and elixirs and spent a lot of time with rez sickness.  
---
I was thrilled when I hit exalted. I was also the only one in my guild with the Winterspring Frostsaber mount. I rode it proudly until the quests got nerfed and everyone had one.

---
To be fair it’s getting rereleased and plenty of it is not common knowledge
---
For their first and only dungeon you mean!
---
Jk, to be fair I've converted some retail people and they seem to switch their mentality rather fast so far.
---
They seemed rather satisfied even when it took us more than 1 hour to complete deadmines in the last Yarr Harr server we played.
---
That’s pretty cool my dude.
---
There's also financial impact, though. If retail does dunk out 90% of their players, Blizzard is going to stop developing that game and focus on Classic instead. You might not feel immediate impact apart from losing guildmates, but the long lasting impact may be much more severe. 
---
Hard to say at this point though, largely depends on how post-naxx Classic will work (TBC, 60+, etc?).
---
Google does this now too, attached to your Google account, so across multiple devices.
---
I mean, he IS still corrupted, but his goal is different.
---
?  Pretty sure we are just going off of talent trees like the OPs infographic?
---
Utility is more important than mix maxing buddy, especially in pvp
---
The hardest one was starting as a Tauren, Mulgore and the Barrens were a pain on the ass to run through.
---
Wow, how could blizzard fuck retail up that badly?
---
I left after tbc precisely because it felt to casual and too streamlined. But apparently, it got even way way worse. And still people are playing? Just wow!
---
People are delusional on the impact of classic.
---
Classic will overtake retail in terms of popularity and active players, just like OSRS did to Runescape.
---
The pvp meta is also going to be different in each battleground level bracket.  It’s a nice way to make a complete character to just pvp on.
---
That number didnt really mean anything though.
---
i am going to have an action bar in the middle of my screen and clicking the totems to match the end of casts ...
---
That is why I have already spend hours preparing the look of my characters, so I can speed through the creation.
---
Everyone optimizing their level pathing, when they should have optimized the character creation for their nicknames.
---
You can, there are some locked quests but most are available to all races.  
---
However, I'd suggest you don't go from less populated zones (Dun Morogh/Teldrassil to Elwynn, Mulgore to Durotar/Tirisfal)
---
Beginning of legion and bfa are a lot worse than classic for alts lol.
---
Then bfa came out and it was so bad they split
---
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Q, E, R, T, F, G, X, C, V, H, Y, mousewheel button + shift, alt, Ctrl depending on what is comfortable (for example, shift + 1 is not comfortable for me, but alt + 1 is). In addition, I recommend you switch action bars with shift + mousewheel so that you can "reuse" many of your keybinds. Maybe for totems you don't often use or for spells you don't need that much in a hurry.
---
I thought it was 11am gmt
---
Really, though? Really? 
---
Cause the Source goals and Sylvanas' goals seem pretty close to each other.
---
It's an ability the rogues have, [Distract](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=1725/distract), it makes your character turn in the direction where the rogues cast it.
---
Pretty sure it didn't auto-update the ranks in WotLK, since I clearly remember wondering why my buddy couldn't keep me up in arenas on his Priest only to realize he was not using max-rank spells.
---
I was trying to boost him to 1800 for the weapons and after struggling for ages we got there in a few hours after he actually started using proper ranks for his spells :P
---
I love classic, but classic will die long before retail does. The playerbase on private servers always decline heavily around when BWL is released and vanilla will completely crumble once/if TBC is launched.
---
Speaking from experience i really think people are overestimating the staying power of classic. The servers i play on always start out with 10-20k active players and then goes down to around 2-3k after about a year.
---
I was doing not too badly waiting for Classic to come up, until I joined this sub-reddit. Now, coming to this sub multiple times a day makes the wait seem so much longer; just so much more aware of the wait and so emphasized now. :'( But, at least it's a way to engage with the game before it comes out... Sigh, 20+ days is a long time still...! But at least everyday, it gets a little bit better...!! :D :D
---
I personally strongly agree. I look forward to the debate about expanding on 'new' Classic content
---
what attunement needed you tot alk to some statue while dead in the ubrs mountain ? MC ?
---
Can you really get to another starting zone without leveling from to lvl 2 with exploring xp?
---
(asking the real question!)
---
Every day is longer than the preceding one.
---
Thanks I hate you
---
It really wasn't Medivh's fault that he got possessed. Sargeras possessed him when he was still in Aegwynn's womb.
---
I always /spit people on store mounts if that counts.
---
So all in all u didn't get past 60?
---
With skinning i think the profit will greatly increase, and if  i remember correct the giants are not worth the time, unless u want the recipes for frost protection potion.
---
Furbolg will grant u winterspring fire water that will sell and a bunch on runecloth aswell.
---
Get a slow cooker / crock pot. You don't need to be able to cook to make good food in one of those, and it's about 15 mins prep one morning or evening then days of healthy eating.
---
Chilli (beans and/or meat) is one of the easiest options, so is a casserole, or a hearty soup.
---
Basic crock pot recipe:
---
* Peel and chop 2 large onions, 3 cloves garlic
---
* Fry them a little in a tablespoon of oil then throw into the pot
---
* Add whatever vegetables you want into the pot, rough chopped
---
Then:
---
* **Chilli** Add canned tomatoes, chilli, cumin, peppers, dark beans, beef or soy mince
---
* **Casserole/Stew** Add stock, meat, few bay leaves, a little thyme
---
* **Soup** Add canned tomatoes, stock, dried pasta broken up, oregano, bay leaves, maybe some white beans
---
Boom. Three easy complete meals.
---
Yes its possible, you just walk your tauren to durotar, a lot of people does this :)
---
For mage, remember that spirit doesn't "activate" before 5 seconds since your last cast. For PvE it's good since it reduces downtime, for PvP you might want to substitute it with stamina. Also, +hit and crit are missing.
---
&gt; Life is short.
---
"He's right. I shouldn't prioritize a game over a good friendship!"  
---
&gt; You can always visit another time. Wow classic launch is a rare thing.  
---
"Oh, right. okay."
---
The implication of "does all content" will be taken to mean this:
---
&gt;It will be a casual guild who still clears Naxx.
---
As someone who plays both, he is entirely correct. Yes their spells are both just called bolt, and retail has the more complicated rotations, but in terms of aesthetics and unique abilities, things that actually set them apart, warlock and mage (and most classes) are the same in retail, especially compared to how diverse they are in vanilla.
---
troll shaman may be better for cast times and stuff from berzerking rage... though tauren will be better for the high lvl alchemy (tauren gets to 315 right? and the epic bwl crafts need 310?)
---
Every shaman (regardless of skill) get yelled at for totems time to time, its a rite of passage or what happens with everyone, so to speak. So take it philosophically. Thats a part of being a shaman. Shamans rather joke about it.
---
there are 18 totems, and you only frequently use a few, for every party. In the raid aswell. usually you just need to drop a windfury totem and strength of earth, and thats it. and you drop them on every new location(pull) through out a dungeon, thats all, two buttons. its not something omega compicated really.
---
k
---
How can I change your mind, when your opinion is bullet proof.
---
Death to all elves!
---
I really love this artwork
---
You okey ?
---
It really doesn't make any difference.
---
It's 2005?
---
He's just refering to the party size since the totem only affects party members, it'll only benefit 4 other melees at most.
---
Your head count for the actual meme was correct.
---
Some people just throw numbers around without thinking
---
If being part of the Horde is wrong, then I don't want to be right.
---
Currently replaying Last of Us on my brand new OLED tv. It scratches the itch for now :D
---
my favourite classes being shit at grinding  
---
also no multi specs so cant be a healer and then a dps without doing a 50g respec
---
I don't remember getting past 60; perhaps I did. It was a long time ago. Could have been 62. Either way, I was behind the guild when I finally got to Outlands, but happy...   
---
I had herbing and alchemy on the rogue, so was able to make some of the stuff I needed if I stopped to herb along the way.  
---
I greatly enhanced my AH selling skills during that time to help fund the run.
---
The retail players might as well be a whole other species at this point, seeing them defend that hot dumpster fire is like watching a vegan defend tofu
---
Because being able to SEE what to do is 100x better than reading about it, especially in a confusing place like BRS.
---
Similar to another bug where you gain a debuff called 'blinded' whenever you get a rogue's health low.
---
+Healing is about as valuable as Spirit but it is cheaper in terms of stat-budget on items so if you find an item with it, usually trumps everything else on that level, meaning for sheer healing, often a green +heal-item can be better than a blue with several other stats.
---
While leveling you'll want to keep both though. +Heal is prettymuch useless for questing while stamina is prettymuch usless in dungeons. When you are alone or do PvP it's way different.
---
Int is worth maybe half of what spirit is worth. It's nice if present but you shouldn't give up spirit or +heal for it.
---
MP5 is a great stat but also very expensive in terms of item-budget. I think 1 MP5 is worth about 5 spirit for paladin/shaman, 4 for druid and 3 for a priest with the talent that turns spirit into spellpower.
---
For questing spirit is even more valuable to the priest due to spirit-tap.
---
Also when you are really good at exploiting the 5-second-rule spirit for the same item-budget will usually trump MP5.
---
So +Heal/Spirt&gt;MP5&gt;Int ... Stamina is almost useless in Dungeons but about as valuable as Spirit when Questing and even more valuable when PvPing.
---
It's meant for those with the attention span beyond 5 minutes and some appreciation of humor.
---
I think both are excellent choices but Shaman is the poster boy of the Horde and brings lot of awesome stuff to group content. Priests heals may be a bit better but Shamans bring an undeniable DPS increase with Windfury totem that will make people actively seek you out for dungeons and raids.
---
Renegade Legion were better ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Sweden represents! My old crew is also getting together. The hard part is getting everyone i to the same server and faction..
---
If they roll one commercial, it’s subs galore, I guarantee
---
They won't lose 90% of their players and they won't drop retail. My guess is they even increase the pace of the content releases. And retail is still very profitable, because it's not a bad mmo itself
---
shaman, warrior, priest...   
---
probably shaman for raiding, warrior for high lvl farming (maybe a rogue for the stun locks?) and priest for the pvp (disc obviously)
---
I just canceled a business trip so I could play on release.
---
Probably. It's not 100% drop on pservers.
---
It'll be pricy for Asmonds bathwater since he so rarely bathes!
---
Guildmates for over a decade, leveled together from 1-60.
---
You log on to see that he/she has bought the newest mount off the cash shop.
---
Secretly level his/her most hated opposite faction class (probably rogue or lock) to 60.
---
Gank him/her while they're out gathering/questing.
---
Talk to them in discord while you're corpse camping them for ultimate satisfaction and deception.
---
Ye i'm good. It's just when I read "Life is short" I thought you were about to tell him to prioritize his irl friends over a game. Guess not lol.
---
No, Activision and Blizzard were both under the umbrella of Vivendi if I'm remember correctly and made Activision-Blizzard as another level on the hierarchy to better manage the two.
---
Then in 2014(?) Activision-Blizzard bought themselves out from under Vivendi and became their own entity, with both Activision and Blizzard underneath.
---
This right here. Moreover, the "PvE Frost spec" is more arcane than anything else.
---
Horde rogue this time around!
---
I started reading about angwe, bro theres so much shit.  Thats a book almost
---
I know, but that's the number used in the post above. Hard to say what would be realistic.
---
I’ve never hated a community of people more than retail
---
how was mana regen back then ... wouldnt spirit be the best stat for all healers?
---
Get an MMO mouse with the 12 buttons on the side, life saver trust me.
---
%t not $target pls fix
---
I think they're just more vocal.
---
I would also be, if I had huge cows and green dudes in my faction instead of gnomes who lost their city to gnolls, and a king who's just a kid.
---
Also "for the alliance" doesn't sound as cool.
---
It's not a leak and it's not a beta it is the final stress test that was delayed and is capped at level 15.
---
&gt; I said dead middle of real leveling specs, I didn't say dead middle when considering shit like disc priest and holy paladin and prot warrior.
---
People REALLY level in those specs.  Every spec is a real leveling spec.  Hate to break it to you. 
---
the talent that make your spells less resistant?  Mind flay? The one that increases your swp damage?  The one that increases your shadow damage flat?  Lol and you can’t just throw away shadow weaving because it starts kicking in late that’s fucking dumb my friend.  
---
I’m not even sure I need to touch on anything else you just said, you made it pretty abundantly clear you don’t know what you’re talking about, I’ll save my time for discussion with someone who does.  Have a good one.

The core of the guild is mostly made up of Norwegians and Swedes who came to play together on several private servers. The guild itself has been in development since early 2017. We are a light-hearted bunch who have our fun min-maxing the game and testing the limits of WoW’s mechanics and gameplay. We are ready for one final round of vanilla (yeah right...) where we will go all-out!
---
Most Hubris members played retail vanilla way back; now many of us are now pushing past 30. With age comes responsibilities in the shape of families and careers. We want to spend our days in our underwear, farming dungeons, raids and crushing the alliance. 
---
We are looking for people that shares our same state of mind. If you answer yes to any of these questions you might be Hubris material!
---
* Are you able to read through this rather long recruitment post?
---
* Are you using vacation days to play classic at launch?
---
* Do you want to rank past 12?
---
* Want to top individual logs for your class?
---
* Are you able to wake up in the middle of the night for a 10 min world boss kill, then resume your sleep?
---
* Mind clearing all 40 man raids up until phase 5 in a single raid night?
---
* Would you enjoy a drunken Zul'Gurub raid on friday nights?
---
# 💠 **Hardcore Gameplay:** 💠
---
Previous experience within Hubris include:
---
* Members being part of world 5th retail Kel’thuzad kill (in guild [Forte](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Boulderfist_Europe/Forte))
---
* Members being part of Aphorism, top 10 EU high-end guild in TBC &amp; WOTLK
---
* [Killing Hakkar in mere seconds with 52k+ ignite stack](https://youtu.be/11M--EYik_s?t=2849)
---
* Many DPS world records in RealmPlayers (private server logs) including:
---
   * Hakkar 5100 DPS
---
   * Gahz’ranka 3500 DPS
---
   * Golemagg 3400 DPS
---
* Speed-running: MC (&lt;30mins), BWL (&lt;60mins), AQ40 (&lt;60mins), Naxx (&lt;90mins)
---
* Many ex-Rank 14 PvPers, both from Retail and Private Servers
---
* 6 months of World Boss Monopoly at one of the largest private server and its successor.
---
* Ragnaros defeat within 13 days of a new PS release (which is a goal we aim to improve. This time within the first reset of retail vanilla)
---
We put a high emphasis on improving boss tactics, theorycrafting and finding the optimal raid setup. Hubris has a subsidization policy, which involve the guild bank providing members with a part of the cost. For instance members can trade a flask for the mats except the \[Black Lotus\].
---
To keep raiding from getting stale (outside of the world #1 kill races) we usually try to spice it up with speedruns, speed kills, and going for top ranks on individual DPS logs. This is a great way to keep content exciting and fun while waiting for the next patch update.
---
# 💠 **World bosses:** 💠
---
One of the most exhilarating and rewarding events of vanilla is by far contesting World Bosses. Ginormous PvP battles, mixed with great boss fights and top-notch loot and gear.
---
The GM of Hubris was one of the raid leaders and a founding member of the world boss alliance at a private server that starts with N and another that starts with A. Where we at one point in time had a monopoly on all the world bosses and their loot for close to 6 consecutive months.
---
There is a great competition killing the world bosses, and it’s hard to act alone as a guild. This is why we have made strategic alliances with other guilds for a higher chance of defeating our good friends Kazzak, Azuregos, Taerar, Ysondre, Lethon &amp; Emeriss.
---
# 💠 **PvP:** 💠
---
Most of our members aim to achieve R10 or higher, without being a part of the Ranking PvP Squad. At the moment our Ranking PvP Squad counts 18 people who will be going for R12 or higher, where 8 of them will be going all the way to R14.  
---
In **Phase 2** we will be organizing honor farming groups every day to ensure our PvP Squad’s honor farm and control of the brackets.  
---
In **Phase 3** we plan on becoming the strongest horde premade on the server, and by doing that: gaining control of the servers brackets. We do believe this is highly achievable based on our previous PvP experience and skill, in combination with having the best gear from PvE content.
---
# 💠 **Additional Information:** 💠
---
Vanilla is finally back, and we’re hardly able to keep it in our pants. We hopefully piqued your interest in some way and are looking forward to seeing you join the ranks of Hubris.
---
You really don’t need to be a hardcore player to be a vital part of the guild. You are just as welcome to join us as a social member; rake in the benefits of being in a great guild, without any of the pressure.
---
Hubris will run weekly PUG raids where socials and alts will have priority spots, they will aim to consistently clear all content in progressing phases.
---
The raids will be organized by Hubris officer Yonomori, through his [discord](https://discord.gg/SZUk4gH). You can find more information about the PUG:s and its requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNQ0lJpXeAnIeCllsBY8rt4ItKF8IvFDCQ_O1VnZlhs/edit?usp=sharing).
---
We are currently looking for one additional member of the following classes for our Hard Core Raiding Squad:
---
* 2 Mages (Troll race)
---
* 2 Rogues
---
* 1 Priest (PI or Holy spec)
---
* 2 Shamans (Resto for PvE, Ele for PvP Ranking)
---
Even if we are full on a certain class/spec ***all exceptional applications will be considered.*** 
---
We're also recruiting exceptional players for our PvP Ranking Squad!
---
Thank you for reading. It’s important for us to find the right people that fit within our group. Some would say we are setting the bar too high, but you got to have a little hubris to achieve your goals.

---
Just pivot your business into a guild
---
Fourty thieves lmfao
---
Lol
---
No, you will reach lvl 60 months before you're close to the mount
---
Retail usually refers to the current Live version of the game.
---
Lock summon
---
It was to unlock certain doors in BRD. Shadowforge Key I think it was called?
---
His friend will be there to visit later on. Prioritize friends ofc, but 27th is a special day...  tell him/her the truth at least. Don’t lie...
---
How bout the mag'har?
---
No. You usually make RP events or do walk up Rp in cities and stuff. But when you’re actually doing content, you’re most likely out of character. 
---
I never knew so many people didnt know what goes on in rp servers/how it happens.
---
Not in terms of reputation
---
I remember think WotLK was the start of the downward slide as well. While levelling it was just AoE tanking through dungeons as opposed to needing any crowd control and it started feeling rather cheesy.
---
Features you get from a guild in vanilla:
---
- a seperate chat-channel to communicate with your members
---
- a guild tag under each member's name
---
- you can design a guild-tabard and every member who buys it has the same design on it
---
That's it!
---
You won't get it in the timeframe you're looking for. I actually got the mount in Classic (so trust me, I know). Set your hearth to Everlook if you need to and come back to it in your spare time (e.g. after raiding is done for the week).
---
You are delusional, people will be pugging raids
---
ive been fapping 10 times a day due to boredom
---
Hi! I added you on discord! I wanted to send you a message but I can't.

---
No, im not really ever looking forward for people to be dissapointed, whats wrong with you
---
Just save the interface and wtf folders
---
Don't think of them as distinctly different specs. Unless you are playing some Shadow Weaving spec you will always be playing some combination of the two. Typically, early on you will play some holy focused spec (like a 21/30 variant) switch to a PI spec when you get better gear (like 30/21) and then possibly switch back to a holy spec in AQ40 or Naxx.  Holy has a bit more raw throughput while disc has a bit more mana, PI (which you can throw on a mage for big damage) and (potentially) a tiny bit more survivability.
---
Step one buy WoW cook book....
---
I have a feeling it will go a little faster for those who played a lot of WoW o think the general skill level and base knowledge will speed up the leveling. Cant wait to see the newer records.
---
I don't expect to like it either. But I might as well set up this transmog stuff, so my character can look nice, instead of wearing that T11 set I last locked out with. Then run a a dungeon or level a bit. Maybe collect the welfare ashbringer (if that is even possible, considering that it's an outdated weapon now).
---
Cost of respec too high
---
I can play it repeatedly if I keep being 4th or below. But once I finished 3rd or higher I am satisfied for the day.
---
Same, I asked someone why they were whispering once when they said that
---
I get how it might have sounded overly confident or something of that sort.
---
But who's to say we won't? I 'm staying positive :D.
---
Brown = flush it down
---
kek
---
those are the best dungeon healers. "can u res pls"? - "didnt do res quest"
---
I remember getting really frustrated because my pet's growl never seemed to work on other players. Ugh!
---
" warlock dots are pretty feelsbadman without it :("  
---
Lol, how about Faerie Fire :D
---
Easiest way to tell if a player is from retail: They'll chain-pull a load of mobs, die and rage-quit.
---
I second this, no fucking way
---
&gt; if you look at the talent tree pre-40 literally anything in Holy &gt; Shadow after STap/Wand spec and maybe hit talents.
---
&gt;No real need to mention the first 7-9 points because they are picked up anyway
---
Can you just admit you don't know wtf you're talking about?  LOL

Both Phase 1. Both better then Huricane. And both easier to obtain.
---
i am looking forward for Classic but till release playing on free servers and i am ok
---
You want to do this if opening on your target would pull nearby mobs, it’s safer to pull one or two mobs at a time.
---
Dude just use an orbweaver if you don't like using wasd...
---
Its more usefull for the mobility than just saving from death, in Vanilla you dont jump at all.
---
Others have answered already but if you're actually considering taking a Tauren to the Orc zone, just don't, Orc zone will have 2.5x the population. You're already at an advantage

Please go back to /r/wowservers and play on your shit pservers. Nobody wants you here on Classic WoW.
---
Is it true that even rogues thought twice before engaging a good shadow priest? Because you know, rogues are basically gods with all CDs up.
---
And then you have geared warriors. The ultimate boss monster in classic pvp.
---
R60.org was the place mate ;)
---
They are top tier in PVP and youll have a blast for sure
---
I do say. A Casual guild can't progress further then mid AQ40. Depends on what is your definition of casual ofcause. Mine is a maximum of 10 hours playtime a week.
---
Do you need a guild for classic OP? Because you would fit in great with mine!
---
It was the source of a lot of drama.
---
It's not too bad to be honest. It gets super grindy after rank 10 though
---
No, we are many that has pointed this out. He makes these like its facts, when they are not. And I love arrogant i-kids (whatever that is) that probably started playing in MoP and have no clue what they are talking about, just as op.
---
This is just false perception. Outlands is incredibly big and easily as big as Kalimdor or the Eastern Kingdoms. The reason it felt so much smaller was because of flying mounts. Also remember that TBC also added a bunch of new zones to Azeroth aswell, including two new major cities on top of a neutral city. TBC was easily the biggest expansion. WotlK was also huge, but as it came with a lot of convenience changes that further shrinked the world (and introduced a lot of modernized systems that the classic community hates) its achievements will forever be tainted with the stigma of the wrathbaby.
---
Love this shit!!!!!!!!!!! back when a /spit meant something
---
I dont have a dog in this race but I will say, my personal experience from 13 years on PvP servers is that ganking lowbies is a major aspect of PvP servers. Hillsbrad, STV, Redridge, Thousand Needles, Stonetalon, Ashenvale. You will be ganked a fuck ton, especially if you’re on the lower pop side. Its even worse in private servers. You literally cannot level in the places mentioned above.
---
It is! Don't let these people deter you from enjoying retail. 8.2 was a massive step in the right direction. I am having more fun in WoW than I have had for all of bfa. It's not perfect and has a ways to go, but 9.0 looks to be quite promising. Also people are allowed to enjoy retail and classic at the same time but this sub doesn't seem to agree. I personally will keep raiding on retail and enjoy casually leveling on classic.
---
None of the points are right lol.
---
Being able to play for hours while listening to podcasts/music and smoking weed. Very relaxing. 
---
Classic is a game where you could be as casual or as serious as you wanted to be at any given time and not experience any diminished enjoyment. A very rare quality to have in a game.
---
It's cringe regardless or the time period. I suppose you could say it was "groundbreaking" in the sense that someone tried to use a video game as a medium to tell a story, but the story itself is peak cringe. 
---
I also don't really think it counts as groundbreaking since instead of paving the way for more (and better) of those types of videos, they were only a thing for a very short time. It's not like it was the beginning of a new thriving genre.
---
Doesn't mean shitty videos can't be appreciated for their nostagic value, but this is objectively a really shit video. Nothing about it is good, whether it's the cliché, overdone, cheesy "storyline", or even the technical aspects of it (which we can forgive, giving the age). Good storytelling was a thing before wow, so no excuse on that front.
---
Please don't be deceived.  By my current situation.
---
hahaha. Yes indeed.
---
You've already decided it seems but I'd just like to further try to cement your choice in the Tauren shaman by saying that you should NEVER decide what to play from what others play, say or do. 
---
Don't think about handling it well, by the time you're 60 you will have gotten used to it and if you really want to improve there will definitely be guides on how to do it. But you should play to have fun, if you think you'll have most fun playing a shaman (and Tauren on top of that) you really should. It's as simple as that. It doesn't matter how viable a class is or how well you perform with the class if you aren't having fun playing it.
---
You cannot possibly buy a computer that wont run classic
---
Everybody see the points bidden on the item by  everyone else.   
---
So basically everybody "talking" amongst each other what to bid high and what to bid low.

You could extend the system by having a minimum DKP

---
A priest can outheal paladins if they want (topping healing meters), but they should not as it would not be the the best way of playing. If the raid plays correctly a paladin should top healing done.
---
Or will he? After all, life is short.
---
I can’t play until October so if I can do it, you can do it!
---
Ran a ZG last week with two disc priests who gave me PI. So much fun as a mage!
---
So angsty :D.
---
As long as they keep the same formula that makes the game so great as-is, they can turn it into hello-kitty island adventure for all I care.
---
Unfortunately, you can't remove flying in TBC without drastically changing the zones aswell, because the world was designed with flying in mind.
---
This is the correct answer
---
I recommend trying video games that never would of thought of to pass the time. 
---
Example if you want massive fantasy battles I recommend ,totalwar Warhammer
---
My first character I had no idea about stats on gear and correct items, so I thought the better gear was what had the highest armour on it. Because the first greys/whites items only had armour, had this going till about lvl 30. Must have looked like the biggest fool to anyone who looked at/inspected me.
---
Thankfully I had no idea about dungeons either so no one had to deal with me either.
---
HEJ SHMABIT. I Wrote to you on youtube. God damnit, MAedsigil here. 
---
So far we are Ulath, Xsi, Parabellum, Odlan, Crow, Hajen, Donkaa, Mardrøm,  Tyraell, Umbra, Nurf, Notte, Doss, Fern, Ginga, Clerc, Pyta, Raging, Sitron,  Tuck, Madjack, Sumerian, Robin,  are onboard so far. I'd take you in a heartbeat ;)
---
What's your character name going to be? I need to know who to not play with at launch.
---
Good ol' Agi Heal
---
They have been oddly quiet about it. I'm interested to see how many join when the game is out, but I still can't see it being more than half the size of retail when it stabilises
---
Damn that's a good idea. I imagine nothing triggers horde more than being owned, killed, corpse camped and lolled at by a teeny tiny gnome female with pink ponytail.
---
You can buy CoD with tokens...?!

No. But he makes entertaining streams. What's your problem?

I think druids is a class a lot of people sleep on. It has a high skill ceiling and requires a certain play style and mind set to really excel at so it is understandable that most people probably wont or don't see the potential ,or are just not interested in playing a druid that way. 
---
That is why I'am going to main a pally! I just don't have it in me lol. 
---
I'll be sure to check out some your next duels.
---
Druid is extremly fun and very strong in PVP, even as feral. Druid is especially fun in Open world PVP when you can use the world to your adventage by using travel form to kite, or kite people through lakes with aquatic form etc :D Druids are really annoying to deal with in PVP.
---
Nihilum used it to get the world first Kel'Thuzad kill. Are they cheaters? Does their kill not count?
---
Fucking winner
---
I was constantly making new characters because I could never decide what I want to play. At one point I made a mage and having already leveled in elwynn a few times by this point, for some reason I couldn't find all the quests. I didn't even know if I was missing any quest, nor which I had possibly missed. I got to that conclusion because my other characters were usually level 11 or even 12 by the time I was finished in elwynn; this time around with the mage I got only to 10 or so. 
---
So I thought for myself that the only reasonable explanation is that there are less quests available for the mage class, because how incredibly strong they are (a single fireball could sometimes bring down mobs health by 50%!) comparing to other classes such as warrior or rogue. It was a letdown, obviously; I liked doing quests but also liked playing mage. But since mages are so powerful levelingwise in comparison with other classes, less quests are available for the class in order to balance the leveling between classes. 
---
And I actually convinced a friend of mine that so was the case.
---
There it is.
---
I know we are supposed to hate flying mounts now years later but I really don’t remember having a problem with them during tbc at all.
---
I hope by saying exactly like it was in Classic, means you can't do it from the LFG screen, and you have to go to the AV representative because that's how it  was in Classic
---
They weren't, they're exactly what achievements should be. It's not an "achievement" to run around the world for an hour and pet a bunch of critters or whatever. 
---
I wish they had a more minimalist approach to achievements in wow. Only make them for things that are actually meaningful and not just senseless, idiotic grinds that serve no other purpose than to get the achievement. Someone who plays at the highest level PvE and PvP should by default have all the achievements kinda deal.
---
Maybe throw in a couple that you need to go out of your way to accomplish, but present an actual challenge, like the "do proving grounds in the wrong spec" thing which is fun and gives you a challenge.
---
I remember tanking Wailing Caverns as a shaman. Shield = tank haha.

what
---
Your flair is commitment, may god have mercy on your soul.
---
I'm gonna do you one better and Gnomish Mind Control Cap + Eyes of the Beast you into lava.
---
I work in a school.... my summer holidays of 6 weeks end the week before release...
---
Pro of having Seal - Can open the doors for pugs and make some nice money doing it.
---
Cons of having Seal - Chances are you did it in a guild group and they probably want to grind the tits out of UBRS... Guess who has to be on to open the door? ;)
---
I get the feeling lots of things amaze you.
---
They want to dps dungeon as a warrior,
---
Basically what I did this expansion. Played for 2 weeks making about a mil after I found out the expansion was shit. Now I have a few months for classic at least.
---
The grind is so much more fulfilling when you expect to have an advantage over players that dont do it. Great example is CH rep when aq drops, you can get exaulted in a few aq 40 runs or you can grind it before aq drops and sell the NR craftables for big profits.
---
A good warlock can absolutely take over wpvp. I have find memories of being able to fight 2 to 3 people at a time.
---
If you play a Warlock or possibly Mage you can kill 💀 level Warriors. 
---
Probably one of my most memorable experiences leveling pre-tbc was killing a ??? night elf warrior on my level 40 something warlock over in that one zone no one goes to.
---
Good job man, please ignore all the rude comments. People will give you crap no matter how you rank the classes.
---
Ahhh that was a while ago :D Too bad yall not raiding from 20 CET then I would join and carry, played a bunch with many of your members on pservers.
---
On Holiday aswell. But Laptop is prepared and will do my best. Got good internet and a surface to work with. Should be doable.
---
I really don't think it's as bad as everyone is saying. It's very casual friendly sure, which works great for me b/c I have far less time to play now than I did years ago. It's still fun and I have a small group of friends I play with that make it enjoyable to push content at our own pace. If I didn't have them I probably wouldn't be playing this solo. As a solo style game it gets old quick.
---
If PvP is your priority, priest is better healer.
---
As if people are willing to play with you
---
Layered? I like that one, i think we’ll go with that instead.
---
Someone who can tank, someone who can heal and someone who's a hybrid (who can do both).
---
***
---
Your options are much more limited if you cannot chain run dungeons, or tackle each/every group quest easily (and I highly doubt you want to run double hunter + healer). If the 3 of you can form the core of a 5 man group at any time (as opposed to being 3 dps looking for healer and tank) you're always going to get the best experience possible.
---
My friends and I are looking for a horde EU guild, dya mind if we join you ? I think theres roughly 8 of us ?
---
I would go shaman they are more fun to level and totems will help your friend. At end game they are excellent healers any raid wants 8 of them. You are possible the best healer 1v1 in pvp whit the option to go elemental for extra nuke. Mail and shield will save you time and time again. Only drawbacks are the skill sealing and floor are high compared to most classes.
---
Wow, I did not know this is a thing, thanks mate for sharing this
---
If you enjoy priest on retail take it into classic and experience what it use to be like.
---
Also they don’t understand the concept of threat and think that tank can just aggro all mobs he pulled with one AoE ability.
---
I was testing it in retail with some great success.  I will be extensively testing it soon in the next stress test as well.  As I play at 144hz the extra fps for me is important, the difference in retail was quite welcome.
---
The mobs don't going to continue attacking an 'immune' target. It's not so much that it's a 'threat' drop, it's that NPC's will only attack stuff they can potentially kill. The same deal applies when you use blessing of protection (and other similar items).
---
Alliance:
---
Druid, Paladin, Mage.
---
Your druid can tank and off-heal + buff
---
Paladin has moar buffs and good heals, can swing a sword while bored.
---
Mage, nuff said.
---
-
---
Horde:
---
Warrior, Shaman, Mage.
---
Warrior needs to pay more attention to their gear than a druid to tank effectively, but synergizes better with shaman.
---
Mage again, cause they fit in every reasonable party comp, you won't be random pugging as melee cleave.
---
yeah thats a thing indeed. also work seems even shittier than usual.
---
started warhammer: mechanicus because i grabbed it cheap and actually is some fun.
---
still cant wait for classic tho.
---
If I remember correctly they added Crusader strike and Divine Storm for TBC. 
---
Overall it's pretty similar but as Ret you will be autoattacking everything.
---
Short answer: not doable.
---
You will spend months grinding turn ins to get exalted.
---
Humans make up around 40% of the Alliance, with Dwarves and Gnomes together being around 30%.
---
But classic wow release tho
---
Cause its way overtuned in Private Servers
---
As the other guy already said, yeah. When you buy a token with gold you have the option of either game time or to add balance to your battle.net account, £10 for the UK. You can use the balance to buy call of duty or whatever game you want sold on the Blizzard Launcher.
---
It's a blog post.
---
Ret in 2.4.3 is strong. Even tank leveling is strong on this patch. It’s a huge difference to classic. It’s almost only auto hitting and heal up after fight. And the fight can take some time if you don’t have a blue weapon in your level range.
---
So impossible until the first demonist of the server get lvl42 and rush back to starting area to summon you!
---
I'm waiting for the threads a week in "I didn't realize how shitty leveling is in classic"
---
I once tried to play WoW last year, and made the mistake of saying hello to some high level players, who proceeded to somehow kill me by making super high level monsters spawn around me
---
Warrior tank, Priest healer, Mage dps.  
---
They are the 3 most sought after classes for dungeon runs throughout the entire game, and you will be able to just fill the last 2 spots with whatever.
---
Isn't it normal for companies and businessmen to avoid taxes? It is financial education. You invest your time to gain knowledge and you use it. Why hate anyone for it?There are many exploits in the world, I am sure you use many of them too, wherever it is being able to be at work checking internet, or having a good job that does not require much effort, or you are running a business, there are many "life hacks", this one is just big
---
I would leave in shame before seeing that lol
---
Thank you. The one only playing during our LAN just told me he likes warlock.  
---
So warrior - priest/shaman - warlocker might happen
---
Presume 3 days is too much for you?
---
Friendships are more important than waiting in a server que to attempt to enter a game where you either can't get any quests done due to the sheer amount of players in the area, or layering is on hard enough to not feel like a big event. 
---
Also, friendships are more important than video games.
---
Pretty much the same. Only differences are
---
* you don't get Crusader Strike on Level 50
---
* you lose a few dmg % modifiers, but in return can get the hit chance talent earlier
---
* consecration is not baseline, but the 11 pt holy talent
---
omg speedy gonzalez is racist smh
---
Above the law. Like many corporations, unfortunately.

divine storm is wrath.
---
I can tell you when servers are released but we are EU based FYI.
---
Beta population watch showed different numbers (only looking at max. lvls). The difference was only about 1%, but it was there.
---
yes we are forming the core for dungeons with a tank, dps and dedicated healer (me). My concern is the questing with 3 people and the lower xp and so on. I have not yet made experiences in classic with 3 man leveling.
---
Disagree, be an asshole, just like the real world.
---
Well, if you don't play anything else; and you're eagerly waiting for Classic you're going to expand all your energy on it. You'll probably devote a lot of time and energy towards it, and after keeping that consistency for over a month, you'll probably just get sick of it.
---
I did that too, when I played my first vanilla private server, that was before Classic was even a glimmer in Blizzard's eye.
---
Murdering every person in STV because you can never forget what you experienced in there and need to repress it with revenge.
---
TBH, I couldnt care less about Rets aesthetic or its performance. Im just sad Prot sucks so much in Vanilla, truly has the best fantasy theme. Holy too, but holy is such a high performer, it trumps the fact that it makes no sense fantasy wise that your heavily armored holy knight is 40 yards away healing.
---
I started before BC launched. Didn't get there in time. Possibly it had been nerfed a bit by then, but it was still a hard run.
---
Then play on a PvE server. This is exactly how I remember WoW, bloodthirsty assholes saying asshole things.
---
and sell for rl money?
---
Divine storm was the final wrath talent, and crusader the final BC talent. So, you did have CS in BC, but leveling 1-50 would be mostly the same, with some helpful tweaks.
---
Ho okay, I understand, so what is your advice? 
---
Leveling in fury, and slap a shield for tanking dungeon?
---
Past lvl 40? You’re nuts. You can do max level dungeons as Prot.
---
Plus for "Dungeons" you can heal pretty much everything as shadow, so I take these guides with a grain of salt...
---
Until 50, wasn’t this largely the same?
---
Im going on a 16 day honeymoon on tje 24th
---
and that was where they hybrid problem came in...
---
"I'm Kitty, the subpar feral druid"
---
"I'm Divine, the subpar retro paladin" 
---
"I'm Sage, the subpar enhancement pally"
---
It was so nice finding my old videos that you uploaded 👍
---
/Parabellum
---
Rep grinds , attunements , farmable mats , mount  + riding , professions,  enchants and consumables for raiding will keep you busy for a long while before you make another alt.
---
You don’t need one. You only need 20 points in Shadow to max our shadow weaving. It’s far more efficient to have (only) one of your healing priests spend 20 points on that, and just bring another mage or lock instead of a shadow priest. When your priest has 20 points and shadow and 31 elsewhere, and is mostly healing, I don’t think it counts as a shadow priest anymore.
---
Hmm you will defenitely do a lot of farming be it herbalism, mining, fishing or whatever butters your bread. 
---
While farming you will have some world pvp (if you are on a pvp Server) which might cause you to join a Group to kill a couple of 60's. That will consume some time too.
---
You can try collect gear for your 2nd spec (if you have a viable one :D)
---
Also Raiding, Dungeons and PVP + Farming is already very very time consuming! Do your pre quests, farm rep, Level your professions, make Gold. 
---
Beyond that you can try to get all the buffs ready for raiding.
---
Otherwise yeah - you should make an alt. Or put your stuff up on the AH.
---
But at some Point you will be far enough to have time to make an alt for sure. 
---
It won't be very quick though - it will take time to get into that position
---
Where do I place a bet on someone ditching the group?
---
In the end of the day, you'll still just be a Night Elf on a saber. Get the real bragging rights by being a race that had to farm for Darnassus AND Wintersaber Trainers. 
---
Like a dwarf.
---
Interesting, I hate pretty much all the new character models. They look even more cartoonish and silly than the old ones.
---
You will need money to pay for consumables. Consumables are a pretty big deal in classic so farming mats or just making gold to buy it all will be needed
---
I am in the same boat.... I am at the beach on release week.
---
Hey, I can just comfort you playing something new.  
---
Play your favourite as you said, tauren.  
---
There is absolutely no neccessary to have played something in retail.  
---
It doesn't matter what you played in BFA, there is nothing to compare at all.  
---
And that totem management is marginal.  
---
See this guide for all the available totems in 1.12:  
---
[https://youtu.be/ZkO9EOezu8o](https://youtu.be/ZkO9EOezu8o)
---
With the NS/HS spec you linked, am I likely to be able to pull my weight/go unnoticed in raids as a healer? Is there a way to take Nature's Grasp?
---
Haha similar experience for me. Only 2 levels or so (like levels 2-4) but I remember as a warlock walking around typing "what happened to purple" to everyone. RIP shadowbolt
---
Yeah I don’t use it either. I just use shift and alt. More than enough for me though
---
My 60 rogue will be seeing your level 20 ass in dark shire haha
---
If you’re talking about BFA’s storyline I have no clue about that. That expansion is trash and I abandoned it before the second raid ever came out. 
---
If this is a joke - I don’t get it. : (
---
Well see you in phase 3 with that mount
---
It was a joke.. frost all the way noob
---
I'd go Tauren. I think (I only read These Information, have no source because who the f. writes that down :D)
---
They have a stun and a bigger melee range (leeway) whatever it is called. 
---
Given you are a melee class that will come very Handy. Also tauren Looks better. 
---
You might want to search for info on Tauren larger melee range (leeway - whatever it is) if it is actually true - but if it is it might be a nice Advantage.
---
You get combat regen anyways from disc. talents.
---
Yup, it's all coming back to me. Been a long time.
---
Ah wires crossed, I meant during phase 1 since why wait to gear if you already outlevelled most people. Just by virtue of being at the front you have more advantage in phase 1 than you'd have being geared in phase 2. No rewards though, just fun lol
---
could be an option, but you are horde !? :)
---
Yup. Its the thing that turns me off most about Paladin, I want to heal but I dont want to wear cloth dresses until Naxx, I doubt Ill ever get that far.
---
Holy fack, been feeling like this for 2 months now. Finished all old pokemon games and even play the online version. Everything completed. Also built about 3 big cities in 3 weeks in cities skyline. Everything is boring. Can't even enjoy playing a private server. 
---
I'm just spamming in a WhatsApp group with 10 others what we are going to play.
---
Yeah I've not been able to get into anything really until this week. 
---
I've been playing Diablo 1 as I found my CD while having a clear out. That inspired me to try to get the recent browser version to work on my phone but it seems like my phone disagrees :( 
---
Anyways, Classic's almost upon us now. I've never been as enthusiastic to set up addons &amp; macros.
---
I think most of that happened
---
That’s like the main appeal m8. You underestimate my power if you think some Npcs will save ya
---
A sarcastic version of lol
---
On the real though good to see you guys back, Hopefully we can get back as friendly rivals :p
---
Nowhere in there did I say every spec being able to do anything. TBC had way more viable raiding specs and classes were more unique than they were in vanilla - spriests being mana batteries for instance.
---
Have they made any statements on when this is available for Europe?  Is it just the same time converted to our time zones?
---
Subsisting off of pasta is super unhealthy though.
---
I would look into simple meals that are higher in protein and lower in carbs. 
---
Chili? Tacos? Hamburgers? Stirfry chicken? All easy to make and healthier than pasta.
---
Honestly Healing, I feel like healing in Vanilla is a lot more about ultility and positioning and preplanning rather than just having a high HPS
---
Don't worry the peer pressure is hard.
---
But classic wow tho
---
Ctrl+shift+q
---
my friends and I still reference this to each other pretty regularly lol

Are you going to join the "Nordic" realm? [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjytnj/nordic\_server\_project/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjytnj/nordic_server_project/)
---
yes
---
love it! thank you
---
Just change the location to Teldrassil or Thunder Bluff.
---
So I red it all ;) my conclusion (as Mage who wants Herbin/Alchi) would be:
---
Take Herbing for sure.
---
Take Skinning only if you keep it until lvl 60 for the value of "good" leather
---
otherwise maybe take Tailoring for bags and BiS Robe.
---
swap Tailoring to Alchi. --&gt; question: is it woth to have tailoring that long only for the Archmage Robe?
---
Since i have a Tailor friend who can also craft my bags.

It seems like you want to play a  rogue but you feel like warrior is the “right” choice. Try them both during the stress test and see which one seems like more fun to play. You’re going to invest some time playing the thing so you may as well go with the one you enjoy. 
---
But so as to not cop out, rogue has more synergy with a mage but a warrior tank can join or start any group and bring a friend.
---
I think there were a lot of people who though that since a class could equip a bow/gun, then they could be played as a ranged class the majority of the time.  I've remember seeing warriors living the gun life in the barrens.
---
Oh, no worries, ill surely rage and be toxic to ppl who cancel my blind with dots put beforehand
---
I totally agree, playing it for the third time (first go on survival), and I'm still having a blast. I also wanted something short and self-contained, so I can finish it till aug 27th :D
---
Keep doing the Lord's work!
---
walking into Ironforge or Orgrimmar. Those two Cities really did have a truly epic feel about them when you 1st made it to there, with the huge gates.
---
WoW launch is such a good opportunity to make friends... don't miss it.  
---
Wait.
---
For me it's moral. Why should I as a citizen pay much more tax and have problem getting everything around, when Big Business together makes trillion of dollars. Especially when banks are BAILED with TAX MONEY when they cheated, abused and failed. Would be great if a citizen got that help when they cheated and ruined millions of lives. No, they can barely call for an ambulance when they need it.
---
If you French fry when you’re supposed to pizza you’re gonna have a bad  a bad time
---
I think it'll be more like that vegan joke.
---
How can you tell someone's a retail player?
---
Don't worry, they'll tell you. 
---
(Or remind you of their golden dragon mount)
---
I'm doing a bunch of mixcloud mixes for my guild according to zone. All ambient or wordless tracks that vibe to the zone
---
So far I have 2 hour mixes for:
---
    
---
   
---
Central kalimdor (barrens, 1k, barrens, mulgore, etc...).  
---
The scourge of lordaeran (forsaken zones).  
---
Winter peaks (all cold zones).  
---
Enchanted forests (ashenvale, feralas, etc...).  
---
Eastern forests (elwynn, human starter zones).  
---
Jungle troll (stv, jungle zones).   
---
Seplunking (caves/deep dungeons).  
---
Lava &amp; brimstone (fire dungeons, blackrock).  
---
And I'll have some casual mix and a dnb mix for more fast pace. Most of the tracks will be non-vocal, so it won't distract from the game.
---
My friend gets married on this weekend.. We are kinda both sad we are not able to play :-D haha
---
But the marriage + party will also be fun i guess. At least we have holidays from the releasedate on! Better be a smooth launch, blizzard!!!1
---
Remember that SS vs TM involved a lot of level 60s..  Nobody is thinking their first character, and if they're trying to they're gonna have a bad and pointless time.
---
I never had a problem with people ganking me, but corpse camping  should have some type of countermeasure.......Then again I usually just moved to a different spot and it wasn't a problem.
---
The main points for leveling BS while leveling would be Mithril Spurs, easy money. Just advertise in general, whatever zone you’re currently leveling in. Next, I believe there are a few quests you can do as blacksmith for XP. Lastly, you’ll be known early on as BS which is good for making money off a crafting profession in the long run. Just research what specialty you want.
---
Remember there are no DK's (dishonorable kills) in phase 1. Celebrate hitting 60 with your pals by camping popular enemy faction quest hubs and killing the quest givers until the lowbies call for help, then enjoy 60 vs 60 wpvp. Repeat this every now and then and you and your friends won't soon be forgot.
---
Make food the week before and freeze it...
---
You can't beat being able to tank for friends IMO. It feels good to be needed! Will you have time for an alt?
---
lol same here! My friend gets married but we both wanne play hard as classic releases xD we have 3 days at least! and then a major break from that weekend on.. \*sad beep\*
---
If you left TBC because you thought it was too casual you would probably throw up at what WoW has become... I'm agreeing with you that it is an absolute joke.
---
Honestly, all of those would work really well with a hunter, but I think priest and pally could pull ahead in terms of Fun, just because you've got the ability to toss a heal out if needed and the two of you will probably never die. :') I hope whatever you choose you have a blast with it!
---
But that's one of the major points that made vanilla **good**. Every class wasnt equal in every role.
---
The class homogenization of later expansions has made WoW boring af.
---
If you play retail at a top level (mainly pve raiding) the grind is actually never ending and is way worse then classic. Ever since they added in Artifact Power in legion there has always been a permanent grind for those that want it. Even if it is a small bit of power to your character it is there to gain and even when you do reach the cap..you end up having a month or less till the new tier comes out and you have to do it all over again..
---
If you take the same type of player in retail and put them in vanilla the grind may seem long to most players because there is a lot to do but they will have finished all the main things in a month or two and will be raid logging / farming consumes and gold / casual pvp until the honour grind comes out.
---
Dragging kids away from all the other games as they went to go play fortnite is actually one of the best points i've ever seen made. bravo haha
---
Bruh
---
Go ally main. In your off time level a ud rogue twink and park him somewhere like red ridge. Raise hell tormenting leveling ally’s when your bored. Eventually bg’s will be a thing and you’ll get even more value out of that twink. Kinda rude, but then this is the reason rogues exist.
---
Irony
---
Yer I honestly think they were far far far too over powered and influenced the whole game.
---
I think this is massively skewed by the fact that pvp is the preferred server of almost everyone that is vocal online about it. I suspect blizzard has hard data showing rp-pve is more popular.
---
Unconciously? Certainly intentionally
---
My very first character ever was a night elf.  This time I'm going to be a night elf hunter.  The sights and sounds of that area were my favorite of the game.
---
Can’t be toxic with right click reporting
---
I heard that its gone. Dont have any links handy tho. My bad
---
I mean, a lot of players have just combined need and greed these days. Which means greed is prioritized in a way :p
---
Good mages are constantly aware of whether the party needs something sheeped and would never use this macro because it encourages split dps.
---
An opportunity like this only comes around once every 15 years, apparently.
---
I guess what is the biggest difference and what make it bearable (or enjoyable) in classic is that your are not forced to grind every day. You can just grind 5 hours the week end if you want to and not at all during week day and you will be at the same point than someone grinding 1hours a day every week day.
---
In retail you HAVE to log every day just to do your chores because if you don't you fall behind the progression. For a casual like me, it's no big deal, I will get what I want anyway one day.
---
But sometimes I'm like "today I feel lke grinding" but the game don't let me grind for 5 hours. When you have finished all your dailies and WQ, it's pertty much done. You can't do anything more to progress your "grinding" goal.
---
So I would say thats one of the biggest difference. It discourage people with not much time to play during week day and forbid them to close the gap during week ends so they are more and more behind each day. And if you fall behind in retail, you are pretty much screwed for interesting raiding, and MM+ key with this stupid keystone score.
---
The other big factor is the rewarding feeling. As other said, you will replace in no time the gear you farmed in retail, not so fast in classic.
---
But is it really him or his money making persona?
---
Yes we do.
---
Read my comment again
---
Same. I've taken more time off streaming because I'm just not motivated to play current games. Luckily my community understands and is hyped for classic
---
Reflect spell
---
We didn't have general knowledge either.
---
You want to truly experience it, and immerse yourself? Play the game, learn as you go. No guides are needed.
---
When WoW was good
---
I have to disagree if your first point. In retail WoW you can be anywhere in an instant. There's portals everywhere and flying mounts.  It totally ruins the immersion of the game. It makes the game feel more like a lobby game and an actual living world.
---
Also a problem with no maps is my brain now has some new dungeon configurations to forget, so you may THINK you know the way, but you don’t
---
You don't have to reset your caffeine levels if you've prepared some cocaine for launch.
---
For PVP as Horde if your class can roll Orc, go Orc.
---
I actually agree wholeheartedly with what you've been saying. It was a selfish stance for him to take, saying he doesn't want more tourists on launch?
---
Damn, isn't launch like the biggest event of classic wow? Isn't that what people always refer to.
---
Tourists are what makes a game, if you can't stand queues for a few days or a week then you probably need to take some kind of calming medication.
---
&gt;  for the love of God get Smite's Hammer off of DM.
---
Why? Do the level 20 paladin class quest and you get a much better weapon than smites Hammer.
---
Then its trolling/harassment. Thats against the TOS too.
---
3 newbie hunters in a dungeon party, have fun. Nothing is more fun than that. It's like 6 people pulling everything.
---
Unless he’s 3+ levels higher than you. Classic!
---
Blue thread yesterday said later this week. Character creation is Monday 5:00central standard time.
---
Opening a chest as a Hunter in ZG. The mind control happened rather late, and I dropped a frost trap and used all my CDs and melee'd half of the party to death. That was wild.
---
Less significant on horde side since shaman are the superior aoe healers.
---
This is going into my notes :-)
---
All these people acting like they are going to face roll their way to nax have another thing coming. There is only so many people who are not mindless, you have to get 40 of em to face roll that shit. In Nost only a few guilds could do this and everyone wanted in because they couldn’t clear content. I had to hop guilds because the same 10 people wiped the raids over and over.  The next guild ran much smoother but I had to do an application longer than a job one.
---
My main gripe - Nothing you do pre-max level matters. There is no gear you get while leveling and want to hold on to. No reason to worry about gold. 
---
I enjoy the rated PvP on retail. Worth the sub for me.
---
Agree. I am going mining to collect mats for engineering for when I hit 60 and switch.
---
Hoard DKP and don't ever try to win an item.
---
Once Eye of Sulfuras drops:
---
1) dump all your saved DKP on it and watch the hilarity ensue
---
2) force your guild to let you go ret
---
You have now won the game.
---
I mean.. 8400 kills doesn't take months honestly. I would agree on people saying wait till 60 however. Get your pre-bis and then work on farming between raids. You can do the entire grind in 2-3 weeks.
---
Queues.. jk I didn't play Classic and barely any TBC.
---
I want to see what caught peoples attention back then. I remember my first MMORPG was so difficult to understand and sadly many choices to individualize/specialize were not redoable, so you had to make new characters. P2W progression and many bugs/abuses.
---
Look, I wouldn't base your class decisions on what you will all level the best as.
---
Just play what you guys want, because to be honest, if you are even asking this questions; being competitive should be the least of your concerns.
---
Just pick the classes you want to play and have a blast.
---
I'm playing diablo 1.
---
See? Common core totally works.
---
Everyone gets geared up eventually. You just have to stick around long enough.
---
I have no problem with buying, but would prefer a proffession to craft low level arrows and bows.
---
I do what I want
---
God I remember when WOTLK first came out divine storm literally would almost one shot you. It was craziness.
---
The game used to run decently well, but it also had a lot of quirks back then with wine, especially the audio if I remember correctly.  Things have changed a lot with the evolution of wine and comparability layers in DXVK.  For me, this makes WoW and other games run just as well as in Windows.  There are even a few games that now run faster in Linux than in Windows, such as Stellaris.
---
My current project is overcoming the anti-cheat softwares, such as EAC in The Division 2.  These are really the last remaining stronghold of Windows to Linux gaming.  Most cheat software has a big problem with you running the client outside of Windows, despite legit operation.
---
Since DX12 is starting to approach EOL and games move to Vulkan, it's only going to get better from here.  Ports will be able to be achieved with minimal effort, resulting in games native to Linux.  I would say with the advancements being made and a little optimism, 2-3 years max and gaming will be synonymous between Windows and Linux.  Time will tell.
---
I used to play a Warrior. At the time I love to do battlegrounds and I'd consitently end-up in 2v2's with a random healing class. Now there was common occurrence where I'd be on like sub 20% life and wondering why the Shaman near me wouldn't heal me. I'd msg them after-wards saying "You know I'm a warrior, one heal and I could probably kill both of them." But every time they'd say to me "Why don't you just roll a healer" I never really understood.
---
It took me 15 years to realise that actually Shamans, Priests, Paladins and Druids can't actually heal. It turns out that despite the guides saying they can, they actually can't. I feel so stupid.
---
&gt; I thought about making a druid since item competition is less, but the lack of a real rez for 5man healing is making me think twice.
---
If you are up to it, you could go as a tank and have someone else heal and rez.
---
Change games with "Finishing college" or "getting a job" then you'll see the true damage WoW has caused us.
---
And still causes us. Judgement free zone.
---
Tauren is nice because you can get a chain lightning off in a warstomp. But still Orc is superior just because of the stun resist.
---
No problem, the more we all help people game in Linux, the more mainstream it becomes.
---
Your character is just as much of a God in vanilla when you AoE grind correctly you wont get damaged and can grind instances people 5 man at the same level because of it - is anyone doing that in retail?
---
Thank you for this wholesome thread 💕

Stick it out in the intro area, try to do my quests, but also just tag and kill any mob I can. Once you get to 5 and especially level 10 it'll improve dramatically.
---
Excellent thread
---
I’m personally sticking with the comedies I’ve seen, like Scrubs or 30 Rock. Keep light and happy while I trudge through some of the more sloggish leveling spans.
---
There is no bad choice for shaman races.
---
All three offer *something* that greatly benefits you.
---
oh for sure. we are lurking on this subreddit ;p meant no disrespect.
---
Even though I didn't play Classic itself it'll be a little of Nostalgia with me. As I play with a group (family+friends) I'll not watch anything nearby - but my Playlists will be there. It's probably going to be my Nostalgia Playlist from 2005-2010 House Music that I listened to with my best friend back in the day (we still do occasionally). But all my Playlists are great, so when I need that Warrior Rage it's going to be Rock&amp;Metal, when it's rather calm my chilled Playlist and otherwise I do have "Allround" for when I want to sing along and annoy everyone around me.
---
The office us, enya &amp; yt videos of black box recordings.
---
I hope you come back soon and try again.  Things are far better than before.  Take a look at Steam Proton and Lutris.  It's still early but the future is bright.
---
Paladin is probably not the best example tbh.
---
Lots of them complained because they used to have pretty much all useful holy talents in the first rows. Lots of paladins used hybrid builds pre-update and were angry to be forced to "choose".
---
Also, prot paladin was different. Judgment of fury put a debuff that added flat threat to any holy damage to that mob. It was somewhere around 330 threat per proc iirc. Huge single target threat.
---
Their aoe threat sucked, but they did have massive single target threat that they could achieve with rank 1 spells, making pre-update tankadin much, much easier to itemize. No more mana issues, no need for strange stamina spellpower plate gear. They could easily just go full mitigation.
---
I feel like this version would have a spot in raids at least. AOE tanking is pretty much irrelevant in 40mans when you can just stack warriors, or make your warrior use fire oil, sappers, or engi shield, for 150% threat.
---
Wow neat project :) make sure you post!
---
Correct.
---
You can use a Limited Invulnerability Potion and AoE taunt on Pservers, which effectively makes you a damage immune tank, providing the mobs are tauntable. Not sure if this worked during beta. Although Paladins don't have a taunt, so not much help for you.
---
Im about to do the same, my gf just started playing wow in retail and she likes it so much i wont let her alone there, but certainly will be casually leveling in classic
---
Why not? queue times?
---
Then you talk about it not being selfish? The more hype this game gets the more and more recognition not only the game gets but those complaining for the game for YEARS get.
---
The entire industry might shift and that'll be thanks in part to Blizz adverts and their dev team aswell as the players. 
---
Queue times literally mean fek all and they're only a temporary problem so it shouldn't be used against positive additions
---
I've been messing around, too. Decided to pop onto an instant-60 server so I could look at what to expect at level 60 for various classes I may make alts for, as I never hit 60 in Vanilla myself.
---
My hype is reaching critical levels. Last thing I was this hyped for was the Nintendo Switch and I've used the damn thing nearly every day since launch! So I think I'll *finally* be back into WoW. After 3 expansions of disappointment, I'll finally enjoy the game again.
---
Learn to cook kids. It’s not fucking hard 
---
Sheet pan, oil, vegetables, salt/pepper into ice 
---
Another pan, more oil, chicken/pork/whatever into over
---
Holy shit it’s dinner how did that happen
---
The Alliance has one other problem you failed to mention, the horde. The orcs are invaders to Azeroth and just another problem that needs a permanent solution. Onyxia and Nefarion are, of course, Alliance problems because they were problems before the dark portal was opened. If the portal never opened, Ony, Nef, Rag would still remain and be our problem. The horde only added to our issues.
---
Well are you familiar with Oglaf definition of honor?
---
I vividly remember listening to Stadium Arcadium by Red Hot Chili Peppers on heavy rotation during vanilla and I still can’t hear that album without thinking of WoW. I plan on recreating that experience.
---
I actually just started EVE online.  All i am really doing is afk mining while i chat and watch twitch.
---
I did TFT for awhile, started a new skyrim save, played a few games of civ 6.l, reinstalled Age of Empires (because i watched the movie braveheart), reinstalled Diablo 1 and 2.  I have been chaining games for the last month and nothing keeps my attention for more than a week.  Thankfully just 3 more games until Classic release.
---
If we make our plans public, you will copy it. Nonononono, I won't fall for your trickery dear sir, I am no Thex!
---
I only have free time in the evening after the little one is in bed and asleep, so odds are by the time I try to get in any serious game time most of the people will hopefully be moved on to other zones.
---
For the most part though I might give it a day or two before trying to level, just to increase this likelihood. I still plan on logging in on Monday and reserving my name in advance, but I won't be too heart broken about waiting a bit to play. I'm not going for any world firsts :P
---
Probably. Best you can do is report them for inactivity and hope they get suspended. /sigh
---
The Office is getting taken off Netflix so I have to watch it at least twice through again
---
Same, nothing is fun. I have been playing Diablo 3, grinding through the season on my 3rd character now that is almost completed and also playing Star Wars Battlefront: 2 (By the way it is pretty damn good now, they put a ton of stuff in.. but the Hero vs. Villans is by far the most BA mode)
---
So, I feel ya - might play some HoTS tonight, duno, just doesn't seem fun :-P
---
both are very good options, hard to claim one is without doubt better than the other. without warstomp you can't really use your fire nova combo, but on the other hand hardiness is pretty op.
---
personally I'd lean slightly tauren.
---
Here's the gear [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1zjkdtmqVbpj4szX6mxCOLYyHgH52vO_to7MtizAQs/edit?usp=sharing) I made for my 49 holy paladin. For the most part the best gear is "of the Eagle" plate gear with the highest rolled stats. Also your timing is really good, I just got motivated to talk more about the 49 bracket and help organize the community. Created a [49 PvP Discord](https://discord.gg/Zn8Scvm) to share knowledge and you're welcome to join. Also just created a post about the [49 bracket.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cmqc57/4049_the_best_pvp_bracket_for_nonraiders/)
---
A "rare drop"? It's one of three items in a bosses loot table, and Verigan's is only a slight upgrade. One you need to waste time running your ass to BFD **and** SFK for. 
---
If you've never done the quest, and you're taking your leveling slow, then sure- go ahead and do it. But it's nowhere near as worth the effort to get it done. You'll have plenty of opportunities to get Smite's Hammer though.
---
Not having lifebloom makes up 100% of my decision to not run resto druid in classic.
---
such a waste of time, much better to be fishing instead :D
---
So you like the pvp where everyone lasts forever and ever? It feels so weird to me. I’m looking forward to classic pvp again where it gets figured out a lot faster.
---
Both is really fun for me aswell. I'm not sure about all the Casts of Priests.. but I think they felt better before the "newer" Addons.
---
Yano you've succeeded in life when you're lurking the wow subreddit and leaving your house in your PJs
---
So i was in the same place as you, but I figured I’d re-up my BFA subscription since the stress test and character reservation were coming up soon. BFA is pretty fun right now and I’ve roped a couple friends to come back with me. 
---
Plus, it’s completely different than classic so you won’t burn yourself out early!
---
Heroic Nythendra I was playing SPriest and something went wrong so we started wiping.  I used Shadowmend and had dots rolling to stay alive just long enough that my dots killed the boss the same time I died and we got the clear for it.
---
Legacy of Void was a major help on this one allowing me to stay in Voidform just long enough.
---
This will 100% happen. «No, you can’t level further because Joe is lazy and hasn’t been on for 3 days»
---
I like this idea, rather than trying to stay the whole level the whole time "Hey guys, lets try to get into RFC on Wednesday after launch" or "Let's all get to mid-30's and spam SM/RFK all day Sunday"
---
I plan to play with a buddy of mine (he's a priest, ill be a druid), but that doesn't mean I expect him to never play without me. Especially as the time commitment gets bigger its going to be tough to stay on the same quests and whatever, but level range will always be close enough to instance together.
---
That would help a ton! Thanks!
---
IMO AV in Vanilla is anything but fun. Herbs encourage people to queue, herb and leave. Shared honor from towers no matter what you’ve done encourages AFK lose mentality, the quests are extremely random and are really only plausible to do in early Vanilla when others need them too, and if you get a group to go do them your group hates you, etc. 
---
From my understanding, PServer AV was MASSIVELY overtuned (Streamers easily beat it at 58 in horrible gear), so maybe I just hate it because the NPCs were so overtuned on the servers I played
---
Daily reminder that The Horde is objectively better than the alliance:
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7jc89/_/esfstr3/?context=1
---
I tried that, hit thousand needles with my mage was very impressed and started to get immersed in the story, so i stopped.  Going to save that for release.
---
Always will have dickheads who leech be it lazy dps in raids or people piggy backing in BG's aslong as we report them promptly they will get the punishments they deserve.
---
I played 49 bracket back in the day, it really is fantastic.
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
I love getting mind controlled during frist aq40 boss then smashing your own raid down if someone screwed up sheeping. So satisfying!
---
I prefer 39 due to run speed superiority.  But I play Druid and Shaman, so I'm biased obviously.
---
Damage Numbers are fairly not-identical though ;) It's much slower in Classic.
---
Tauren FNT+WS+CL is deadly but I would pick orc stun resist any day.
---
Do you guys think that classic will follow the “normal” evolution of wow?
---
Unrealistic expectations bro
---
Anywhere but Winterspring
---
Yeah on the PServer Druids were extremely good tanks compared to warriors in lower levels. The AOE threat from pre-Hotting was amazing and allowed your healer to DPS instead of heal most pulls. Problem is I’m leveling with another Druid and that part would definitely hinder the group unless we rotated healing and bear to minimize downtime. A 2nd Druid is definitely not optimal though
---
Offshore accounts are tax evasion, not tax avoidance. Hence why Blizz already had to pay $345M to the US and is being pressed for $1.1B from the EU.
---
Lol usually they run in there without any caution like they do in retail and wipe the group
---
In theory very similar but in reality quite a big shift. 
---
Just to boil it down to the central point and assuming you mean leveling as in "playing Ret":
---
As Ret you are entirely reliant on RNG from Seal of Command (SoC). This means that you are probably the most gear dependant spec in the game as your only extra damage comes from this one mechanic and it must hit, and hit hard!
---
So while gearing by stacking as much STR as you can in order to boost SoC (yes it's boosted by AP as it's based on your white hit dmg) you simply just wait and hope that Seal of Casino triggers and that it crits. 
---
Without Crusader Strike at higher levels this makes the experience even slower as mobs hit harder and you have no instant attacks to push your damage between procs. Judgements do help but they don't scale as well.
---
Mage/lock has pretty great synergy. Pros: Mage brings food, arcane intellect, poly cc and slows. Warlock brings health stones, a tank in voidvalker for leveling, stam buff i dungeons from imp, fear cc and can summon for gathering groups. Plus you save some coin on warlock mount if you share gold. Cons: You share pretty much all gear with the exception of shadow/fire/frost increases. Everything with spell hit will be the hottest item. One of you could level tailoring, while leveling to help with gear, since both uses cloth.
---
Just duo level with ur buddy then, gonna be faster
---
&gt;[GAMING KILLS PEOPLE]
---
What the fuck!?
---
Imagine using TFT for anything but The Frozen Throne.. /puke
---
You should switch disc and holy for raiding.... New meta is power infusion for all non-weaving specced priests for 40mans, because deep holy talents are unnecessary
---
I managed to not get hyped until the last stress test, now I’m ruined for other games...
---
26th can’t get here soon enough
---
I will let you feel good about yourself for now.
---
Yeah probably. We will have to scope out how slow questing is when we’re leveling. We’re worried about the mass population slowing questing down too much
---
The part about loot-Quests is not as bad - because if there would be 4 other people on that quest anyways, it'd be the same scenario. This way you still get the partial EXP + every other quest is much faster and as already mentioned: Dungeons. So I'd always go with 5 than alone, but if you don't want to do many Dungeons 2-3 man parties are probably more effective.
---
Well first of all your main spell isnt a channel. He is right that it is not fun, but it is quite efficient to level as a priest. It's way better than shaman, rogues, warriors and paladins because of its efficiency, not because of the killing speed. Played right, you'll rarely drink unless you overpull. Blow your load (smite/holy fire/flay + mb depending on your level and ranks of the spells) before the mob reaches you, dot and then wand.
---
This was me a few weeks ago on pserver. Didn't realize there was a difference until I saw my first red mob. I promise I've learned a lot since then...
---
Looking forward to playing WoW for the first time!
---
i caught some shit in a wailing caverns run during beta for not sheeping.  we were moving at a steady pace, AoEing mob groups, and no one died the whole run...
---
dungeons are tougher in classic than retail no doubt, but always cc'ing is not the hard rule some people think it is.
---
Please share :)
---
Impending doom is a magic debuff. Priests and pallies have to remove it .
---
But they are correct to make people use a resto pot for fights with an aoe debuff
---
before that, they were attacked by the kul tirans chasing the Orcs
---
On infinite loop... https://youtu.be/z13qnzUQwuI
---
Personally I think it's still fine. From the perspective of any mortal, you would be like, "Um, fuck no sargeras."
---
Literally no one would be like, "Um, okay, I guess that's best for the universe. Go ahead and eradicate me, daddy." 
---
For that reason sargeras is still unequivocally a villain. Especially since we're gonna find some other way to beat the void lords which would prove Sargeras wrong.
---
Haha I had something similar , I didn't understand the difference between need and greed but figured out quickly that need wins from greed.. ninja'd many items this way..and I wasn't even a hunter!
---
The thing I loved the most in wow that the player base was split, and there was an actual war between those.
---
Huh?
---
When it's ready I'll post on reddit
---
Just an FYI, a subscription includes all expansion (except the last one).
---
Honestly, it's good experience and if you're healing dungeons, poison/disease cleansing totem and mana spring are handy to have.
---
Classic Deadmines was a right of passage. It was the first dungeon you did as Alliance and it was probably the only dungeon before the max level dungeons that EVERYONE encountered, regardless of skill. Due to that unique status, you saw people of every skill level go through DM and it was a really a gut punch in dungeon mechanics for the uninitiated.
---
Does it stack?
---
If you are going for hardcore pvp, and your class has the option of choosing orc, you always choose orc.
---
Class videos: Platinum WoW Vanilla Flavors series
---
Professions: Frostadamus or madseason
---
I don't think you need any other in depth videos but these are good to plan out your character!
---
No one needs to know you spec’d spirit tap to farm in between raids ;)
---
I played a resto druid in vanilla,  I never had an issue healing 5 mans. 
---
Everyone in this sub pretends classic is the hardest game ever. As long as you're careful and your tank knows how to pull, the dungeons are all pretty easy. High end M+ is significantly harder.
---
This is only necessary if you run out of bars. I f.e. use Elvui and really have to work on filling all Action Bars without Toys.
---
Tauren. Warstomp combos can be either deadly or allow for a clutch heal. Not to mention that it's another interrupt and your only CC.
---
Engineering
---
Have you played Vanilla/TBC so you know what we are comparing with?
---
I can agree that BfA is a good game, as a game. But it's a sad version of World of Warcraft.
---
Just get ahead of the zerg, play 24 hrs and when you wake up the next day ure still gonna be ahead. Do named quests and object collect quests and grins the rest if it's overpopulated, ull do fine
---
Is your name really that unoriginal? Server caps aren't going to be as large as retail servers, are the odds really that high that someone will pick the same server as you and the same name. AND be a person who is so into Classic that they are reserving their name. 
---
I just don't understand why everyone is concerned with making their character and reserving their names within seconds of it being available. I get wanting to have your character made and ready for the actual launch so you can login right away. But unless your name is something unoriginal or from pop culture or something I don't see the concern.
---
"can we evolve past that?". 
---
Sounds like you are the one who has to evolve past that buddy.
---
I still remember the first time I walked up to Ironforge all those years ago!
---
Warriors can break fear in other ways.  Engineering is much more important than that trinket.  
---
You can reflect the warlock fear and throw grenades at them when they are casting
---
pre-mades against pugs, pre-mades try to avoid pre-mades at all times and push through 10+ hours a day just farming honor

we didn't touch gear, consumes and raiding yet

---
Undead isn't a spec

**Region:** EU
---
**Server:** PVP

**Class:** Warlock (maybe shaman, but probably Warlock)
---
I'm looking for a social/semi-hardcore, relaxed guild that's looking to be social with one another and group up for dungeons/questing while leveling up and generally helping each other out. I'm happy to raid any day of the week as long as it's not before 20:00 UK time, (21:00 EU time) for about 4 hours. 
---
I'm also hoping you'd be up for a lot of grouping up for World PvP and doing some BG's together outside of raiding as PvP was what I enjoyed most during Vanilla.
---
I've been playing WoW on and off for about 14 years and did a lot of hardcore play in Vanilla, now that I'm older I still want to experience the fun and nostalgia of classic by PvP'ing a lot in groups and clearing all raid content, but I'm not looking for world/server firsts. 
---
Give me a shout if you have any questions, looking forward to playing with you all in Classic!
---
IMO it’s Dwarf that wins the 1v1. Removing blind is too big. He who is able to blind can even reset the fight after getting opened since you won’t break his blind (Assuming you’re not a Dwarf)
---
"holy outheals disc" theoretically yes, in reality it doesn't play out like this, PI spec is perfectly fine for all phases of 40man content
---
Holy is good for healers in casual guilds where you have to carry a lot harder
---
I know it's a joke, but yeah, no.
---
No, just things that are uncommon. Thanks for being a dick though?
---
Where do you get that idea from? You don't get magical dmg increases out of nowhere. The abilities are the same, the items are the same, the stats are the same.
---
The only dmg increase you get is from the talents, which amounts to 3% more crit chance, 2% more dmg (5% vs humanoids, demons, undead and elementals) and 15% crit chance on judgements. That helps, but it doesn't amount to "much slower"
---
That is why Blizzard should follow the #nochanges crowd because in Vanilla, class balance was constantly tweaked and Blizz should continue doing that. patch 1.12.1 should see buffed retri pallies and scaling AP for hunters. Patch 1.12.2  should see boomkin overhaul and nerfing fury dps etc etc. Every month a new Class of the Month. THAT is the true Vanilla flavor.
---
I honestly loved the OG deadlines. The drops the fights the quest that gets you extra in there. Everything about it was wonderful
---
Paladin leveling is alright, but it's slow. Seal / Judgement is all you do which has a cool down, and you also don' want to do it all the time because of mana. It's mostly just right click. I'd still do it again if I was going Alliance, though. They're the most fun to heal as end game.
---
I'd say Human, Orc, or Dwarf depending on if you can get the jump on them with perception and/or how lucky your stun resist procs are.
---
If you see a retail player, they may have been playing since Vanilla.  They are most likely here for the experiences they miss because of how WoW has evolved, just like you.
---
Alt+F4 is boss Key. Very quick
---
I'm insulted you'd think a human or a dwarf would go to level in Darkshore and Ashenvale, when they have Loch Modan but I remember that's what the old Alliance leveling guides recommended. 
---
More power to you then boyo.
---
Warriors want stamina, then armor, then defense, then avoidance for tanking.
---
When I was 13, I played around on a private server for a bit. You could buy tier sets from vendors. I remember buying the T2 pally judgment set (pally) for my warrior. Because : the more badass you look the stronger you are. I also remember raging alot getting my ass kicked in pvp with my warrior judgement set...
---
Omg that last sentence cracked me up. Loved it
---
glorious my lord
---
My favorite aspect is that the game puts 2 opposing factions together in a real and alive open world. 
---
Then let’s them run into each other naturally in the world creating countless dynamic interactions and pvp. 
---
Many other games completely miss this key game element and split the game in half pve on one end pvp on another. Making everything very repetitive and boring. 
---
The fear/excitement that you have while questing in somewhere like hillbrad foothills on the look out that someone might come attack you at any minute! Is something every other game I’ve ever played has failed to recreate. And it’s hilariously sad 😞
---
My gf is going away for a bachelorette party that weekend. I’m ecstatic.
---
the Orcs were legit abused for ages even before the conflict with azeroth, the burning legion found out about azeroth due to the elves
---
if we're gonna use the old Horde to criticise the Thrall lead Horde we have to look at medivh, at arthas, at the elves, at the human slavers, the night elves hunting trolls, cenarius attacking because nature while the dwarfs are just chilling eating up the earth and the gnomes polluting like hell much like the Orcs
---
the frostwolf clan and thrall are quite different, I'm sure you'd agree
---
in the end everything about those invasions have really nothing to do with the new Horde except its name, much like arthas and his army, or gilneas and their selfishness against their own have to do with the Alliance
---
You lie. That could never happen
---
I usually alternate between:
---
Oven baked Salmon/Chicken wings with a side of veggies and Boiled potatoes/rice.
---
Make sure at least half of your food is meat or you won't get the well fed buff.
---
Usually I don't cringe much.. but this is the end boss of an expansion size of cringe.
---
?
---
Even if that is true, it means the developers messed up because hybrids do like 60-70% dps). If only they did 90%.
---
My group of four is doing mage, warrior, priest, and shaman. Something along those lines work well for dungeon running.
---
That would be rad.
---
We are most likely going to be using EPGP.
---
This really was my favorite part of the game and what I'm looking forward to the most. Needing all the mats for ammo, poisons, vanishing powder, etc. Made the game so incredibly immersive.
---
Easy there Satan
---
&gt; How do you normally beat other rogues?
---
Maintain rupture on them so they can't vanish.  If you know you're fighting a rogue, apply deadly poisons as well.  Be aware of what spec they are and manage your cooldowns to try to burst them down in a stun.
---
&gt; Is orc rogue the best anti rogue?
---
Depends.  Orc gets the stun resist, which stops a lot of the lock down you'd get.  But I feel a Dwarf rogue has a large upper hand when you get blinded by another rogue, you just stoneform it off and finish them off.  A rogue will blind you to get a reset, but you counter that with stoneform.  
---
Same goes the other way, you want to get away and have bleeds and poisons on you?  Pop Stoneform and vanish and you're golden.
---
&gt; What builds are recommended?
---
Pure PvP, you want a prep/hemo build, pop ghostly strikes and evade and let their attacks feed you combo points.  Ideally, Sinister Strike/Hemo is going to be your most ideal because no requirements to be behind the target.  You can get a seal fate sinister strike build with reposte as well and that's strong anti-rogue, gives you cold blood.  Assassination daggers is more for caster killing where you can jump them with big crits to burst them down.
---
&gt; Any items or consumables that help?
---
Engineering and grenades/items/trinkets.  Consumables, stock up on thistle tea.
---
&gt; Is rogue vs rogue only a matter of who gets the jump first?
---
Not really, because in phase 2 with your PvP trinket, you can get out of that first stun.
---
Humans?  Come last
---
yup same. I've been trying so much to keep my mind occupied but i just don't enjoy it as much. I've been playing dungeon defenders with some friends and that's about it for games i'm enjoying right now. I used to play dota, overwatch, DBD and none of them have the same appeal anymore. 
---
I want to build towards something long term. I want to go home.
---
tauren get + herbalism, not alch
---
I've been playing on a starter account and to be honest it's about what I remember. Sure, lots of shit is tacked on that I don't understand. The talent changes are... weird. Basically telling you where to go for quests kind of ruins it too. 
---
What has surprised me though is how glitchy the game is. Has anyone started a new character and noticed animations not going off or quest logs being empty? Sometimes I can't turn in a quest either until I close the window and reopen it.
---
Rogue warrior shaman is a lot of fun. Wind fury procs for days. And nobody has to play the boring healer role, the shaman can just start building a healing set for dungeons

30+% stun resist Is not rng heavy. You can expect to resist some stun pretty much every 1on1
---
Silly that the site has paging because 1 streamer couldn't fit the list :)
---
Fair enough. That was mainly based around the assumption that the human would get the jump from stealth 90%~ of the time with prep. Maybe I'm overvaluing that.
---
I was sad that this wasnt Darude Sandstorm
---
You forgot  /sit during their 3rd death while the respawn timer forces you to look at a fat orcs ass zooming in and out before it allows you to click on release corpse/revive here
---
I'd recommend staying away from as many escort quests as you can.
---
They're usually slow, tedious, barely worth it - and on a fresh server there's so much competition that you need a full group spamming a talk/accept quest macro to have a chance.
---
But somehow 20/40 have girl characters haha
---
I felt it at first, but I'm enjoying a lot of other games now. My hype has settled into just a nice excitement. Only a bit more to go :)
---
If you cant play games then I really advice watching a few anime all about mmorpg or world building in an MMORPG world.
---
Examples:
---
World building/Massive amounts of npc/players involved
---
* log horizon - everyone logged into a major MMORPG  for the launch of a new expac are transported directly into it. Also because it was a new expac launch even the max players cannot tell whats going on and what awaits them (no details on new raids..etc). The anime goes into true world building and how the universe would change and a lot about player interactions on a whole realm based server.
---
* Re-animated as a slime - Guy dies IRL and gets re-animated as a slime in a gaming world. He can absorb new abilities. He goes into building a large alliance.
---
* Gate - not so much MMORPG. A gate opens in tokyo commercial district and hundreds of fantasy creatures pour out and attack civilians. the army defeats them and then enters the gate. You get to see tanks/planes fighting dragons on the other end. **However in my opinion US will not allow Japan to enter and enter themselves and other countries will all try to get access to the gate. Once major countries are aware of what valuable minerals are on the other side WW3 will break out.**
---
Only one/few player transported
---
* Overlord - probably one of the best. GM playing as a necro/warlock gets transported into a world whereby all enemies are roughly half his level. All the guild Npcs got transported with him.
---
* The rising of Shield hero - This is probably for tank players. A guy who doesnt game gets transported as a shield class to a world. He finds out that 3 other people were teleported in from alternative dimensions. They are all dps classes.
---
Thats d i r t y but mandatory
---
agree 40-49 is fun, but no BGs until 6 months after release...just make a 49 alt later.
---
Play Alliance
---
Isn't there one special crossbow with firey arrows?
---
This
---
Or the report button... but dont say that too loudly round here
---
I like to start off slower and be more subtle. If put a song like this more in the climax. I will definitely add it tho. I need to get started on a desert mix

If I can, I will always help the opposite faction or try to get them to help me. If ganked, I never fight back and try to stand still and die as quickly as I can if I know I'll be unable to get away. I will only gank if I see someone on my faction being ganked and I know that we could win together. If not, then I don't get involved.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
All in the name of efficiency and maximizing play time. So many times I've been ganked and didn't fight back while /bow to my ganker. Run back to corpse and they /wave at me and sometimes even help me out.
---
Just pick the one that’s more appealing to you, no one can pick for you.
---
Ya, but hybrid roles became a bit of obsolete since raid optimization and speed runs have settled (in pservers). In the old days, hybrids were welcome since raids were hectic and chaotic. But nowadays, it's all streamlined af. Everybody knows what to do. There's hardly any need to heal in a pinch anymore.
---
Old Sfk! Will love to go back there! My first instance I played back in Vanilla.
---
&gt; bear in mind 
---
Why are you thinking of druids?
---
Depending on how many warlocks you have, you want at least 1 shadow priest. Free mana free shadow vulnerability
---
What's the name of your guild?
---
I really enjoyed 40-49 back in the day, although 20-29 can be great as well
---
Haha, meme specs.
---
We actually haven't settled on a name. I'm hoping the newest members will help weigh in on that. Right now the tentative name is &lt;Undecided&gt;
---
Inspiring. I like it
---
Well I do agree with that, but hybrid respec discount doesn't change that. As I said, it would still fit hybridness: You can do it all, and switch your roles cheaper, but you won't do it as good as pures.
---
Earthbind kiting is super easy. You’ll get used to it in no time
---
LOL yep.  caster druid twink at 39 is literally unfair.
---
My bro did the same as he was heading for Gladiator, **don't backpedal** was all I'd hear when he was over my shoulder. I get it, it just feels weird!
---
"Oh no she's cute"
---
Druid best class in everything
---
Disc is for PvP Healing. If you want to 1v1 go shadow.
---
You can easily use 10 characters per server if you use bank alts. They give a lot of extra space to store some crap. I personally separate alts of different item categories, such as: herbs, ore, leather, enchanting goods, etc.
---
I grind apex ranked, then sometimes i ask myself why so much tryhard from my part when i doubt ill get into diamond before classic releases, then i lose interest and just yolo a few games and lose points, then im thinking, actually if i tryhard enough i might get it and start to play serious again, and its going for few days now. Im on and off with it.
---
I am in Germany and on Netflix, most of the anime doesn't have English subtitles :(
---
I say that all the time yet I keep going back :/
---
My friend and I did that all Wrath expansion.  We hung out in Hellfire Peninsula for the first month of the game, welcoming all the brand new Death Knights who just hit 58 and that was basically the first place for them to go to level.  They had no idea what they were doing, it was fun abusing them until they stopped logging in.  Sure thing, *Death Grip* the Rogue who has been tormenting and abusing you.  Bring me right next to you so I can kill you while saving my Shadowstep CD for killing you a 5th time after you release and try and heal up.
---
Lmgd did 1-10 as a mage in something like 1:30, but he was a gnome, not sure how that compares to doing it in Durotar.
---
Shedo style feral druid
---
I really, really wanna play MCC PC, but goodness knows when that’s coming out. This, on the other hand, will definitely hold me over.
---
**Region**: EU
---
**Server**: PvE/PvP (anything is fine)
---
**Faction**: Alliance / Horde.
---
**Class**: Hunter / Priest / Warrior (other if required)
---
**Raid availability**: Monday - Friday (and some weekends, can't promisse all), 09:00 - 21:00 ST. Basically I work at night and can't keep going after 21 ST.
---
**Looking for**: Semi-hardcore raiding guild. Right now what is important for me is the raiding times. I find many NA guilds where I could apply, yet, none in the EU. I've started playing on classic with a hunter, did raids until AQ-40 (first few bosses) and then BC came out. Right now, on Retail, playing warrior and shaman.  Might also get 2 more friends to join up with me.
---
If you have any question, feel free to contact me. Lets hope I get lucky on this quest :)
---
**Experience**: In classic, everything except Naxx.
---
"/me has flagged you AFK. You will be kicked out of the battlegrounds in 5 minutes. To remove the flag, type /AFK off"
---
xxLegolasxx has left the battleground.
---
You don't need to buy or play the current content, your subscription for Classic pays for both, and once they have Classic launched and patched and bugs fixed, they don't need to dump development money into it until they decide to do a TBC redux or post Naxx Classic content.
---
All that money saved from Classic raking in sub money but not needing to go towards Classic development means it can go towards retail development and push more content faster.
---
Mining/skinning and drop skinning later for BS if that's the way you wanna go.
---
You'll earn far more gold this way and then can just powerlevel BS later, with said extra money.
---
&gt; Slightly later, I had no idea what stats really were, or that they had use only for particular classes.
---
Same here. When I completed that 5-man quest in Ghostlands (I started in TBC) instead of int staff I picked agi sword for my mage thinking that my character needs some defenses. 
---
Later on some low level complemented me on the sword (*Nice sword* or something in that fashion). I will never know if he was serious or making fun of me.
---
Lol. Im never taking a balance druid to any raid.
---
A regression guild called "The Meme Team". No metas will be allowed.... We're gonna suck.
---
Couple of friends and I started a new Minecraft server, that's keeping us plenty occupied until Classic drops. Doubt I'll spend another minute on there after the 27th, though.
---
Yes
---
Thanks all for the responses!!
---
Not sure you understand how rng works. You can’t expect but you can hope.
---
The lack of Vanilla is what makes me boot it up, I know as soon as Classic is out I will never touch the game again haha
---
The full response: Paladin have insane self sustain. They arent the most spectacular levelers, its kinda slow and mostly auto attacks, and its true that in raids they generally heal, never tank, rarely dps, but raids arent the whole game and theres a crap load of dungeons, world elite areas, quests, and all the pvp stuff too. Paladin are crazy good in pvp settings when no one can kill you easily.
---
Seeing stitches walking down the path and running like hell from this giant monster.  The first time I saw him leveling my warlock I was in awe.
---
I really enjoyed the 40-49 bracket in Classic, would recommend. I had a Priest in that bracket and had heaps of fun - saw lots of familiar faces in games and found nice people to queue with etc. Will absolutely be leveling an alt to dedicate to it again!
---
That attack speed and low damage makes it a joke for raiding dps.
---
Pally dps is actually decent if you farm 20 Manual Crowd Pummelers for every raid and stack spell damage
---
There will be so many other lonely people playing at launch. All you have to do is ask in general chat, and you'll find yourself buddies in no time.
---
Should probably remove the "humor" tag.
---
The game comes out Monday the 26th. You can take the weekdays off work and visit your friend on the weekend.  
---
It's not rocket science.
---
I don't want to avoid the zerg. Being in the thick of it is my reason to get on from launch.
---
Are you the man! For the Horde!
---
Hey there, feel free to check my post history for a longer description of the guild, but we'd be more than happy to have you come along.
---
Thanks for sharing that story, it was a great laugh
---
As stated, offshore accounts are not legal and that's why companies like Blizzard and Amazon are being fined billions. Also, as stated, legality does not represent morality in any way and it is incredibly ignorant to argue that lawful=acceptable and reasonable.
---
It's not a great overall spec for PvP, but I always beat other Rogues in duels as Combat. Riposte is absolutely broken unless they're using a weapon chain. As for items, I always tried to keep a Barov Peasant Caller around - it summons 3 NPCs to attack the target, and with vanish as buggy as it was, it would usually instantly break their stealth. Good rogues will be able to vanish while dotted to get a Cheap Shot out if needed. That trinket was also great for dueling Hunters because it would soak their freezing traps.
---

Can I ask you why you need a list like this?
---
You... still have it :))
---
KEK A N A L DOGG
---
Yeah 2vs2 doesn't last for 4 hours now. Rest is basically the same. War of attrition.
---

---
some decent wpvp
---
No, you just cannot fathom anything different.   You are a drone that cannot think outside of the box he has been given.
---
I got invited to someone’s 50th anniversary party that weekend. Hahahahaha.....no
---
Oh yeah, it's definitly been a while since I played my rogue in Vanilla/TBC and forgot the rogue's was specific to charm/fear/poly only.  As for deadly poison, yes, terrible damange, but if you're looking to add poisons to keep people out of stealth, it's an option.  Did I do it?  Not really.
---
I'm on the same boat, I only play games that did not require time investment, like overwatch just a few rounds of brainless actions. But I can't commit to a serious single player game or mmorpg that requires too much hours because my thought process is like "I won't sink hours on this, I must do all the productive and social stuff I can while Classic is not released"
---
Any chance your name was Thex?
---
Oh shit. He listed things that were gone hm? Never thought they would remove slowfall or iceblock from mages. :S my bad!
---
Laughs in Naga
---
I raided up until ICC or so with someone who didn't realise he never got skills at level 80. He always was a bit shit at DPS before that. It improved when he got max rank offensive spells.
---
If you want a TRUE classic experience 10 people on your team will be jumping bots.
---
I member when you could type anything in /emote and the opposing faction could see it.  Gave quite a few horde the ol Cleveland steamer.
---
you mean fishing in alterac?
---
Yeah. I just gave one suggestion...
---
&gt; What I’m saying is that you oversimplifying the structure the game. 
---
Wow its almost like the OP was supposed to be a quick and easy infographic, and not a dissertation length, in depth analysis of the nuance of every single class.

Retail bad Classic good. Real Insightful post
---
Doing a DEXA scan &amp; Xrays on a patient while daydreaming about how my first experience will be when logging into wow classic after work. 
---
Never played Vanilla WoW, started in BFA and was dissatisfied with how it was. I want a true mmo experience!
---
Hey, I'm in Montréal as well! Have you decided what faction/class you guys are rolling? Also, definitely get yourselves a crockpot/slow cooker. Take the weekend before release to dump some frozen veggies with some meat and spices in there and bam, healthy supper that's super easy to freeze. Either eat by itself or with pasta or rice.
---
To determine GP costs of items (we will be using EPGP). I don't think the standard GP formula is good for Classic.
---
After? there is something comming after classic?
---
You won't be spamming PoH. You'll be using mostly single target heals and PoH a bit less. Even when you do need it, you have Inner Focus on a 3 min CD that can be used with it.
---
PI mana burn is insane
---
I was part of Sentinels. And yeah I have a strong candidate. hit me up in PM if you are interested.
---
Even if their damage isnt high, paladin utility is so good that your better off with a ret paladin or 2 over no paladin at all, ideally you want around 4 paladins, so if one or 2 is ret it's no big deal, those blessings and auras make everyone better to make up for the drop in dps
---
Downvoted because of the edit. Learn to stick to your guns next time.
---
Dwarf is best race vs rogue. If the other player is just better or more prepared going dwarf is unlikely to win you a match but it certainly won’t hold you back.
---
Damn that sucks, Netflix got a few good ones too. =/
---
The nice thing about classic dungeons is that if you fuck around too much you will actually die.
---
Should have made it an ugly dorf. Thats false advertisement lol. Priest is all filthy beards and twirly hair in vanilla
---
Neither is reading, bud.
---
Awesome, thanks man.
---
Engineering has some benefits for tanks, and a bunch of general benefits for anyone. Most of it is convenience outside of dungeons/raids, though.
---
I think the shield you can make with it is very good.
---
Csgo will always have a place and drag you back in 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I played Retails for all of 20 minutes to try and get my fix. Didnt work at all. Currently on Return of Reckoning mixed with lots of HOI4.
---
it me. I figured fuck it, if they're trying to copy this game it must be worth its salt
---
Troll is the optimal choice. But if you are dead set against it I think I would lean toward Tauren. Having an on demand stun profits you more than a chance to resist stun.
---
Congrats.  It’s probably gonna be an amazing time, but I’ll gank you for your lack of commitment
---
Spiderman is been the only game I've managed to play without feeling like I'm wasting my time or simply can't get into. Probably because it's got a finite story coupled with the fact it is actually an amazing game to play. It fit's perfectly into the scenario we're all in which is to play something that's decent but is completable before Classic comes out.
---
No, this means you have an active subscription or you cancelled after the last billing but it hasn't been a month yet.
---
While we're on the topic of AV, can remind me which side the map favors in 1.12?  Is the Alliance bridge still the best chokepoint?
---
I beg to differ, I've not enjoyed playing it in months, couldn't be more pleased to see the back of it
---
WATCH YER BACK
---
For Sulfuras? Good fucking luck m8.
---
Some people will give you crap.  Ignore them.
---
The vast majority of people will not, and should not, care as long as you are respectful of the server's classification.  Don't intentionally disrupt RP events and you should be just fine.
---
Thanks for the help man, I'll go check those blue posts - it was good to know.
---
Thanks man!
---
As a horde player, I can confirm that it works. Nothing sucks more than getting ganked by a goofy looking gnome and seeing that stupid dance on top of your corpse
---
Comparing 25% upgrade with 0,1% upgrade is just blowing my mind. Keep out of my server.

Wow xpac nr 54 . Highcommander warlod gramps, slayer of kelthuzad, lormaster of 30 continets.
---
I've also found myself doing this, very low commitment as I know I can hop back on to it any point before the next retail expansion comes out and I want to be DH when that happens.
---
If you played WC3 youd know that they simply ask the trees nicely and magic lumber appears
---
You’re not going to make much money with either until end game. I’d consider leveling with mining and skinning then changing once you’re 50+ to mining engi
---
You can pretty much grind SM from 30-38. Having a mage would be best. Not a lot of good quests for SM but high densisty of mobs.
---
I am away until the 30th so I will miss the initial rush.
---
I am planning on filling out my roster of characters/alts/bank-mules, all of which I will get to level five so I can unlock professions for them.
---
Then I plan to switch back to my main and begin playing the game; questing, harvesting, fishing, cooking etc. while periodically sending mats to my alts to level their professions and make stuff for me.
---
I lost all my old data to failing harddisks and I didn't do enough to keep that data around.  This time I wish to keep recordings and screenshots with hopes I can see it in the future.
---
Yeah, NPC related stuff in Vanilla AV was more an annoyance or something to slow someone down as opposed to outright defeating them... besides some major ones that had more direct consequences or rewards.
---
We’re talking about pre-40 dude. Imp SW:P is picked up as Holy and it does not increase your SW:P damage. Hit chance for Shadow can be picked up as Holy as well. Please read the thread if you want to jump in the middle of the discussion. Also no need to be an asshole. Mind Flay isn’t useful pre-36 as I said twice already.
---
I do think they'll get priority, but I don't really mind if the name isn't common. If they claim names like 'Asmongold' or 'Sodapoppin' it's totally fine by me, but if they reserve names that are not directly linked to them and others might want, like 'Asmon' or 'Chance', or just some other generic word, it does become a problem for me.
---
I have a toon on a RP server on retail, it is completely dead. I can login and goto SW and be the only one there. They are a waste of resources.
---
People won't have problems if you don't fuck up, but keybinds are more efficient for obvious reasons.
---
But I will have to mail all my ores to bank alts due to lack of back space, so is it really profitable to level skinning, which in fact also fills up your bags quickly, when you have to send so many mails to alts?
---
&gt;Basing by the wording in this post, it seems that we are only getting the realm list after the stress test on Friday
---
What makes you believe that?
---
you could use them when everything else is on cooldown, but even then i guess healing stats would be more beneficial. maybe except when ure facing melees only.
---
i never used them in pvp
---
I can’t wait for this game to come out so this can stop being the worst sub on reddit.
---
Every one of your questions can be answered by using the search bar.
---
Jocys is good enough I think, I just hoped there'd be some other addon which did not have the robotic voice.
---
Funny to think that that picture doesnt even encompass an entire classic/vanilla raid group (35 or 36 if you include the photographer)
---
Translation?
---
It does. A 33% increase.
---
In other MMOs back then it was the same.
---
I think it would be really cool if they followed a different expansion path.. Maybe developing areas that were "secret mysteries" from Vanilla, like what's behind the door Bael'Gar is guarding in BRD? Things like that.
---
That epic mount is 1k gold.  That’s like 500k in BFA dollars.  Grind out the money.  You’re going to need epic riding if you do AV.
---
Thanks bro, yea please do link one since I did try.  Most of the information is old.
---
You can be on par with a priest for main tank healing, but because of HoT overwrites you won't be able to shine raid healing. Healing wise in dungeons the only problem they have is the cool down on the rez, but that usually isn't a problem (VERY infrequently though a group might fall apart because of it). You can bring a dps priest, paladin, or shaman and mitigate this completely. 
---
Leveling up I'd actually recommend you try to tank instead of heal. Feral is your fastest leveling spec and druids are great tanks. You can even continue to tank dungeons at 60 and get many of your healing pieces, especially if you bring a priest. 
---
That being said I'm planning on playing and played priest, so my memory for druids may be a little off.
---
Friendship ended with "my friend".
---
Now ClassicWoW is my bestfriend.
---
Congrats on your new job!
---
I believe guilds will dictate their own prices of loot through loot master/loot councils.
---
You're not. Perception has a huge range. It wasn't a huge deal in vanilla, but it was quite game breaking in arenas.
---
Warlock!
---
The skins you just vendor. Yes it will be profitable, even if you buy bags
---
mining and herbalism is not good together in classic since you can only track one at a time. unless you want to mine the region and then collect herbs after.
---
Kinda depends on how you want to level.
---
* if you want to be rather quick and save up gold for mounts, then go with two gathering professions
---
* if you want to take your time with levelling and keep up with BS while you level, it might be worthwhile.
---
Imo, it really depends on what you want out of the game and what you think will be fun for you.
---
But.. Then I ain't following you. :/ I know that shit is old at least.
---
Reading this paragraph long sentence was painful my friend.
---
I still can hear peons screaming - who put tha bootarang on my skin for that netherdrake grind
---
Read the WoW Chronicles! 3 volumes and its well written. Definitly worth the money AND it builds the hype!
---
passive that procs 30% of the time is literally the definition of RNG
---
Are you part of GRAMMARPOLICE?
---
playing private servers and civ 6 on Epic length until at least the stress test to satiate me.
---
You remind me of ghey
---
Will depend on raid times, not a deal breaker. 3 times a week has some upsides too.
---
Play what you like, its your own character. 
---
Maybe come with an excuse that a trainee mage accidently polymorphed you into a girl and now youre stuck like that.
---
details
---
We raided into AQ40 with between 4-6 women. Though tbf it was one of them that chose to play the politics sub game and completely gut our guild, making it impossible to reach Naxx.
---
Honest question: Why is the 50-59 bracket not an option? You definitely have all class mechanics there and essentially specifically exclude raid gear.
---
Good point, thanks.

#1-1a. You download the WoW Classic client via the blizzard launcher. You should find wow classic in your region drop down similar to where a PTR realm would be. 
---
#2- server list will be out later this week by what blizzard said yesterday regarding name reservation. I would suspect this will come out Friday after they close the stress test... If they keep this stress test up for 24 hours or more that is.
---
What are game tokens?
---
Care to explain why?
---
Just another bfa bad classic good post.
---
Its been 15 years. The game has changed because it had to. Imagine if it played the same way every expansion, no one would want that because it would be boring af.
---
Game philosophy is different now, its all about mechanics now and less about class. 
---
When leveling through all the expansions and 120 levels no one wants to waste time "exploring" old content they've seen a million times.
---
Truth is that you are looking at bfa with vanilla eyes and thats really stupid. The game now is completely different than it was. If you are judging a game based on 15 year old standards you are doing it wrong.
---
Nope, you're wrong. I levelled to 60 as alliance on 2 different servers back in 2005 and the deadmines was almost always referred to as VC. If a lvl 19 was running around saying "LFG DM" they were more often than not very publicly corrected and told that DM was Dire Maul
---
I'd like to respond to this, and the OP's comment, with my personal experiences.
---
I have never played Classic, but did play WoW from BC through Cata.  I came back two months ago due to all the Classic hype.  Watching Twitch streamers play WoW gave me the itch again, and I resubbed.
---
The game has certainly changed from the BC-Cata era, and probably even more so from the vanilla era.  However, I like it.  I'm older now and can't play 15 hours a day anymore.  I like the casual action fantasy retail WoW offers now.  I can log in, get my fix of fantasy fun, progress a bit in the storyline of whatever zone I'm in, and log out.
---
It's important that we remember that retail and Classic are essentially different games now.  Is retail better or worse than Classic?  Of course not - they're just different.  Some people like the casual fun of retail.  Some people like the no-hand-holding Classic experience.  Some people like CS:GO, and some people like Candy Crush.
---
No game is the best way to play - all that matters is that we all find the game that makes us happy.  I'm not going to play Classic (simply because I can't risk getting sucked in deep to the Classic experience), but I enjoy lurking here and seeing other people excited.

I use keybindings and have a 12+ button mouse, however despite this I still have to click some abilities/consumables as and when required. As long as you know what you are doing you should be fine. It's unlikely that you will play to the level of Esport champions, but 95% of the gaming population wont either.
---
Why would every druid spec be balanced to be in line with only the strongest specs of other classes? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I don't see you crying about sub rogues not being viable in PvE though.
---
The fact of the matter is that compared to other hybrids, druids have slightly worse healing capabilities in exchange for viable offspecs. The class is crap when played by a noob, but it's really powerful in the hands of an experienced player.

Orc to look like thrall. Kodos&lt;wolves
---
I'm in the same boat.
---
I fired up my sub and have just been farming gold for tokens to pass the time. It kills the time and that way I don't have to pay $$ for classic.
---
Grinding pigs
---
Just the stuff i said, got removed. The rest exists.
---
If you manage lfr/normal raiding clicking, you'll be fine in classic doing the same.
---
If you bring it up you'll probably be laughed at because it's a pain to click and a lot easier to fuck up.
---
Depending on class, there are a few macros you'll want, but you can still click them if you want.
---
Honestly you're just inconveniencing yourself, so just make sure you don't inconvenience anyone else.
---
All I can say to you is he demonstrated on his stream that hamstring kiting is a lot lot less effective than it is on private servers.
---
same problem here, solved it with warcraft3, replaying the kampagne feels good
---
Awesome thanks.  From what I read, some people see the classic download and some dont.  As I have not yet subbed, I was wondering.  I think I should just sub now and see if I can get the classic installed before the masses starts trying do exactly the same.
---
No I mean fishing in AV in either of the lakes close to the entrances. They used to contain fish before it was removed in a later patch. I think you could even catch the fish you needed for armor potions, was too long ago tho not 100% sure.
---
Yeah, I really can't thibk of anything...probably the asshole streamers and their horde of moronic followers
---
This will 100% fail. All it takes is one lazy bastard to not log on for a few days and then someone who wants to get to 60 this millennia will continue leveling.
---
For the most part I'm the same, although I got this game called Mount and Blade Warband that's been keeping me VERY entertained for the most part. Recently got the diplomacy mod and have been having a lot of fun with it. 
---
Highly suggest if you anyone's into RTS war games with RPG elements.
---
10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60
---
Originally it was 11-20, 21-30 and so on, but people complained about level 51s in their bgs at 60, so it was adjsuted.
---
Warsong is available from 10 on, Arathi requires 20, AV requires 50.
---
Already quit my job in preparation
---
Shh no tears
---
Clicking removes focus from your character with surroundings and its slower than keybindings. But its doable.
---
I agree, but also your class identity shouldn't be non-existent.  Vanilla is what it is, but BC did it better.
---
Most excited about server communities.
---
Least excited about vanilla rotations and class balance.
---
Try Teamfight Tactics. It totally made me forget about classic for now :)
---
Thanks so much for the great respsone. I was thinking about leveling dream state is that a terrible idea?
---
I think this is a think that has been overlooked. Streaming wasn't a thing then and all the big WoW streamers are going to be going to do Classic and drag a lot of people over too
---
49 was my favorite bracket by far. I played an unhealthy amount of 49 with a fire mage outfitted in 90% green +fire dmg gear. No health, poor mana, and hit like a freight train. Great fun.
---
Even the MC drops, like fiery cores??!?!?
---
How is Troll optimal for Elemental in PvP ?
---
Love it.
---
The main people that will notice are the members of the opposite faction kicking your ass for it, not your party members.
---
Even back then (I was 24 at the time) clicking was definitely not the norm.
---
For my part, I did this weird thing where I used WASD for my movement and then used the keypad on the right side of my keyboard for all my abilities. I played a warrior, so thankfully changing stances got my all my abilities without needing a million keys. I used the / * and - for my stances and then the 0-9 and the + and Enter for my abilities. Worked well enough.
---
Thankfully nowadays I have a Tartarus game pad and Naga Hex (7 button) that pretty much renders my keyboard completely useless aside from chatting, and the odd keybind for things I never use.
---
Sure, but what about the cost of mailing all those ores and minerals? It adds up.
---
Our first battleguard sartura pull.
---
I never saw a raid die so fast.
---
I remembered thinking "how the fuck are we going to do this".  Bitch was dead like an hour later.
---
Was all about the pull.
---
Ive always RP'd as the non-RP player. Its effortless and all around great. People tell me im a natural
---
This is probably the way forward, just explain that a spell was cast on you and your actually a dude. Most people will be fine with this (maybe a bit shocked xD).
---
troll
---
No, lol Jesus Christ.  YOU brought up pre-40.  The basis of all these comments started as what was considered ‘good’ leveling specs.  YOU were the one who stated that shadow was basically worthless pre-40, no one else.  And swp talent increases the duration, which increases the overall damage on one SWP.  So yes, it increases the damage one single swp does.  Period. 
---
And you specifically said that the shadow tree is pointless outside of hit talents, but then now you’re saying you pick that talent up as a holy priest anyway.  That’s you spending points into shadow specifically for damage output, that’s literally a contradiction to what you just said.  Not to mention mindflay isn’t useless before then by a long long long shot, especially on a pvp server/dungeons/elites.  
---
I honestly don’t know if you’re actually trying to argue these things and are saying incorrect information on purpose in order to really defend something you misspoke on, or if you actually just don’t know a thing about priests.  
---
I’m being an asshole because you’re saying grossly incorrect statements and are pushing them as fact when this information has been out for how long now?  And you should know these things by now, and if you truly don’t then you shouldn’t be arguing with people about what you think is correct.

Are you Swedish? The background looks Swedish

My shamans name was Po, on the Akama server. Our server was small and sad but we tried hard.

You can't farm in 1.12 AV. They removed most of the PvE aspect during some Patches. In early AV you could grind in the Caves and farm Clothes and Level.
---
if you're playing with good players you won't really need many consumables in MC.
---
ice lance. really brings the frost mage shatter combo together
---
Let me know how that works out for you
---
that won't matter, everyone's going to race to 60 and then after launch there won't be sharding anymore. everyone's acting like the entire server's life is going to take place in 2 weeks.
---
Not really. With the new lore, there's nothing that could've corrupted him. 
---
In fact, many lore enthusiasts speculate that the Pantheon is actually the ultimate evil and Sargeras, even though fucking crazy, was the good guy after all.
---
But mailing costs copper and it is difficult to keep track of all the stuff you have, when it is on another character.
---
yeah, honorary member
---
AV is 51-60.
---
If the consequences of the report function are automated it *WILL* be subject to player abuse.
---
ShangTsung: Your soul is MINE
---
Yes retail and Classic are different games and one of them is superior in every single way. I think everybody knows which one (starts with C)
---
That's no excuse.
---
Imagine being this much of a virgin. Your baby kid reaction to it only makes it funnier. You are on a video game forum, if you don’t like having a ton of kids around maybe you’re in the wrong hobby. You’re also pretty retarded if you think it isn’t mostly adults making these jokes.
---
I never watched Wow streamers on Twitch until the Classic hype, and the streamers having beta access.  A guy name Asmongold was always at the top of the viewer counts.
---
Is he... is he legit retarded?  Or is it an act?  I mean, he makes money hand over fist, so good for him, but I can't tell if he's actually a mean-spirited asshole manbaby, or if that's just what his viewers want to see.
---
No problem hope you like it.

I decided to book my honeymoon at the end of summer to make sure the the rest of you would not have to wait until fall
---
If you level mining and skinning, Just vendor your leather. You won’t make any money from it in the AH at the beginning of a server’s timeline. And that gold is better spent during that time than sitting on it til later. Half the population will have skinning, and the smart ones will be vendoring those leathers every time they get to a vendor.
---
This is a true story. I only have a couple good tales from my Vanilla career because it was my first MMO and both my ability and computer were trash tier, but this really happened.
---
I was so bad that I didn’t even realize I had talent points until level 42 and I didn’t get my first mount until 47.
---
But my BRM battle was the sole happening that lit the fire of my addiction to this game.
---
None. Just tell them paladins, druids and shamans for the most end up being healers.
---
No. You gain experience through questing and killing NPCs to gain levels. It’s the same for all classes through each expansion.

Just be thankful it is not Comic Sans. This is the 00s we are talking about.

couldnt you do it with remedy?
---
You have mandatory prep courses for being parent? Not saying those courses are bad, but mandatory?
---
Lol this is exactly me with league of legends. I’m trying to get diamond before classic hits but then I think why bother when I’m just gonna stop playing league seriously and devote that time to classic instead so it almost feels like a waste. Use up all that mental and try hard energy for 3 weeks just to not care anymore. O well it’ll be nice to brag about it randomly to friends I suppose
---
I took the week off, I'll have 9 days to get to 60, then it's gonna be casual city working 50-60 hour weeks and not having nearly as much time as I used to.  I want the leveling process out of the way so my weekend playtime can be all about dungeons and raids.
---
RP as a trans woman
---
18 male nerds in discord combined with ingame music and ambiance.
---
Any 3 classes you like. Helps if you are different armor users.
---
Remember that pvp isn't about beating the character, it is beating the human behind the character.
---
The only honorable kills are the ones that cause them to switch characters or servers or games.
---
Or do a little of both and drop skinning after you get your 40 mount.
---
What do you mean? Break poison with a consumable? Consumables can’t be used while CCd
---
Yeah obviously gotta be smart about it.  I got up to one bub from leveling on my guys then gave up =P
---
But guys, don't think that every decent player will trinket the Tauren Warstomp against Elemental in order to dodge the combos ? Since there is nothing else to trinket against elemental shaman ?
---
If you don’t want to get ganked - play smarter
---
It does, but itll pay off in the end. Its really not bad, 1s20c every 4 posts. You might have to farm a little more for your mount, but probably not.
---
Excessive layering.
---
Ah k, thanks guys very informative.
---
Paleowolf and some of the Cryo Chamber stuff. In first place the game music I guess.
---
This is my calling
---
The problem is RP and RP-PVP servers were fine until the world grew so big that you hardly bump into anyone anymore. Flying especially screwed the RP community because the majority of players were 500ft in the sky, so bumping into someone for a random engagement/event was significantly less likely. It's not that RP is a waste of resources, it's that the game developed in a way that punished certain playstyles.
---
I don’t know, does being part of the faction with less time in the foreground get old?
---
AMEN. Outside of arena in TBC, this was the most consistently fun I've ever had in pvp.
---
It's going to increase retail numbers.
---
I'll explain.
---
More people went on to play world of warcraft after classic than during. This means that out of the millions of people to ever play WoW, most of them never played classic to begin with.
---
Gaming has changed significantly since classic. WoW became a much better game during TBC-WOTLK, and even now has many quality of life improvements that gamers want. Though retail isn't perfect, it's is by far the better game if you consider all aspects of game design.
---
There are two groups of people who want to play classic. The ones who never got a chance to and the ones who did. The ones who never got a chance are in general not going to like classic. It has nothing that modern games offer, and there are many better games out there worth investing their time in. Classic is tedious. Players are rarely rewarded for their effort spent in the game. You can raid for weeks without anything.
---
Players returning for nostalgia sake will probably enjoy it and stick around for a bit. People coming back just for classic without ever having played wow, will likely try retail because it's required to play classic, and find out they prefer retail much more. It has more addicting qualities when it comes to handing out gear, and ease of play.
---
If classic wow was released today without it being a pop culture phenom, nobody would play it at all because it would be considered an unpolished game, with little to no reward for playing.
---
Mobs will attack another target if their highest threat target is immune to attacks or spells. However,  bubble is not threat drop. The mob will switch back to you when the bubble wears off and you still have the highest threat.
---
Wow, a bet you didn’t know list.  What an original format for a video.  I certainly haven’t seen those posted before, and they certainly aren’t low effort clickbait.
---
What do you mean official? Addons aren't official.
---
It’s absolutely clear cut. Grenades and tidal charm are better ccs and easily replace warstomp nothing can replace hardiness even slightly
---
By that standard, Paladins have Crusader Strike in vanilla.
---
So yeah.
---
Haha I thought the same thing. Took a couple accusations of ninja looting to set me straight.
---
Don't be too bothered by XP. You're playing the game with two friends. You'll have fun. While you'll most likely need a bit more time than the average solo player you'll have joyful company all the way. Therefore you're doing things "the right way"!
---
The sad truth
---
I would not base your class selection around one specific type of wPvP encounter.
---
yeah thats what i was referring to
---
That's part of the appeal of Classic to me, class identity.
---
You're right now Prot Pally and Veng DH are basically the same. So are all tanks. And all casters.
---
Every class has every ability, it's all a mash-up of homogenization and I (and a lot of others) don't like it.
---
those damn elves are racist towards undocumented immigrants just trying to make a better life for themselves in Kalimdor lol
---
It's not. It is for pve though; Elemental scales really well with haste and if mana isn't an issue you can actually outdps bad mages.
---
Pretty sure Sodapoppin said he skips it during leveling and comes back for it later.
---
Thank you.
---
Berserking is bis for pvp and pve shaman. Potential for 43% haste increase can be pretty huge.
---
TFT is pretty great
---
Please check if you got a seizure.
---
After that quote me where I said a percentage chance is not rng. Thankx
---
There is virtually no competition for this since you can just group with whoever is present and very few people care to attempt the grind in the first place. If you grind it solo, then you can get about 6 turn ins per hour while you can get closer to 10 in a group. That turns the grind into an 80-120 hour grind.
---
While it is a major grind, it is less than the grind to 60 and countless people are going to hit that in weeks.
---
Ya'll never played games before WoW and it shows...I'm sure I've had some moments like these but I can't remember any of them.
---
For some people the starting days are some of the best memories they have. Just my opinion of course but I personally think any form of tech that prevents you from seeing someone standing next to you defeats the point of an MMO. Ive seen it happen in other games like early Wildstar and Tera and wasnt a fan.
---
I've got Insurgency, Forza, and Mordhau keeping me preoccupied but all I can think about is ganking lower levels in STV :'(
---
Completely forgot where I was. Guess I need to work on my reading abilities. 
---
I'll message you later but I'm definitely interested. Thanks for the reply.
---
Lots of guild drama too on the realm forums. Great popcorn entertainment.
---
Won't happen right away, but taking a screenshot on the throne after a successful BRD run. Did my first successful dungeon run as a healer. It was new years eve/day on Doomhammer, met some great people. One of my fav vanilla memories.

---
You can totally clear early content with a raid consisting mostly/entirely of subpar specs. It will be slower and you'll wipe more because there's less leeway for people to screw up, but in the end the content just isn't tuned that tightly. At least one group killed Onyxia with a raid consisting entirely of priests, with a shadow priest tanking: https://youtu.be/yAmXZPuS7L0
---
Whether it's worth putting together a dedicated guild for this kind of tomfoolery largely depends on what you intend to get out of it, I think.
---
A good feral cat can beat hunters, feral bears have outstanding TPS even without the pummeler. Seeing that you do actually care about PvP strength, it's worth noting that balance is a strong wPvP and dueling spec.
---
Paladin is comparable to priest in PvE. If we're talking PvP, paladins singlehandedly make Alliance the stronger faction in organized PvP. Holy reck and holy ret are both viable PvP specs.
---
Did you all just assume some genders in here ? Kappa
---
Is exploration farming not effective for you?
---
Gnomes are like tapas. So satisfying, but they leave you empty so you just order (kill) more and more and more.
---
SoC is actually called Seal of Casino, wanted to correct you on that.
---
Do you mean Cataclysm? I was not really fond of that one tbh
---
clicking is bad.
---
most people in classic were clickers,
---
hence why everyone thought raiding was so difficult.
---
personally, I don't want to play with bad players, they waste your time.
---
do you want to waste other peoples time because you want a more challenging game?
---
Handbanana
---
You are missing the biggest launch event in wow history. Have fun on vacation lol, ill be sitting at home in front of my computer and partaking in gaming history.
---
That is my gameplan but Im not a true expert. I have read that tanking the leveling dungeons in Fury is no problem, just be sure to switch to defensive stance and keep a shield in your bag.
---
Uh yea but only the dead elves do that. So i mean without the orcs there killing elves, making wisps, how are they gonna ask the trees nicely?
---
God I hate that fucking trinket, lol.
---
"Squeal like a boar!"
---
That's the beauty of it! You can play solo just fine and you'll encounter some good peeps in no time.
---
undead
---
Honestly, pugging is probably not very viable in retail. That should go away as soon as you join a raiding guild though.
---
lol. What game we talking about. What damage intense fights?
---
Cool but seems really unnecessary and awkward to use.
---
I’ll never forget that bitch female rogue Yamingtons on Frostmourne
---
A Shaman with a Pendulum of Doom was practically unbeatable at 39.
---
Yeah, I'll give you that. That's the one thing PI is really good at.
---
for some people, constantly crashing servers from being under load aren't enjoyable.
---
Hyped for classice
---
Also like the fact that my wife is less clingy now, and won't ride my ass for playing as much...
---
I moved my hand from the keypad to the mouse, and back and forth. I really only used the mouse for large camera adjustments and relied on the keyboard keys to make the minute adjustments.
---
Thankfully I've since learned to move/turn with the mouse and now only use strafe left, backwards, and strafe right as my movement keys.
---
14 isn't the minimum level, it is 10.
---
ohh man, you are a hardass.    I heard that HOR was BIS for enhancement shaman for quite a long time.   Would you not help the enh shaman in the guild?  He uses it for pve.
---
Hey guess what asshole some of us have lives and plans ahead we can't all neet at home and play video games
---
If anything it'll likely be higher. Botting in vanilla was waay easier than it will be today.
---
I started playing retail with my wife teaching her the ropes before classic. Hoping it's not a mistake lol
---
ha thanks! Yeah for the try hards that can afford to stay ahead yeah they gotta stay disciplined and keep pushing. 
---
Burning out before raiding can be a real thing for the uninitiated who may be reading this
---
I think that's their dream outcome.
---
&gt; no changes" but
---
Literally "no changes but"
---
If there was a bingo card a year ago, this would have been center square.
---
Make lvl 35 alt after main is 60 for professions finish leveling it later for thinking.
---
I’m sure people in Westfall thought you were doing Dire maul all the time. A level 19 zone trying to do end game content seems reasonable. I played vanilla and it was always DM. I played prior to diremauls release and after and it was the same shit
---
It'll be interesting for some people who have only really ever did BGs. \~99% of my PvP play time in WoW has likly been in BGs and Arenas, I am excited to be "forced" to WPvP and subsequently play an aspect of the game to a higher extent. We have all had the occasional random wPvP encounter, killed people over nodes, outside dungeons/raids, but I am looking forward to going out into the world with the mindset to WPvP.
---
They want you to create a blizzard account and then contact them to link your old wow account to it.
---
TM/Southshore back and forth zerg fests.
---
an item (or stack of items) cost 30 copper to mail. dont think of that as a factor.
---
is there any chance i could get the druid icon with a transparent background?
---
good work, 10/10 i really like these icons
---
No shit there’s a stress test in 2 days
---
Time to get roasted.
---
Mine hates "gaming" as it's very immature. I can't even roll my eyes that much to express how I feel
---
I wouldn't base my class choice on what your group of friends choose. You wont ve playing with them nearly as much as you think.
---
Yeah, you have to create a Battle.NET account under the same name and then contact support to have the old WoW account recovered and added to your new Battle.NET account.
---
Unless your old WoW account had the Collector's Edition items, there's no reason to have it for Classic.
---
I'd almost argue waiting till 45 to respec from holy to shadow since you will lose damage from your wands in the disc tree.
---
INVITE TO ASMON LAYER PLEEEEEEEAAASE!
---
This time around though, there is no known bot for Classic.  Everyone is afraid of being sued now that there is precedent.  If anyone is botting, it's because they wrote their own and most likely won't be sharing the code.  So I doubt there will be a lot of bots.  Just chinese/venezuela human farmers.
---
I eventually made a bank alt in Cata.  At that level, mailing fees were negligible (although you make a good point for low level classic).  And the way I used my bank alt was to send all crafting mats and AH items to them.  Wasnt too tricky to keep track of.
---
Play what you want and have fun at it.  Other than that, things that I wish I knew first time around:
---
Dungeon/Raid Attunements and Keys
---
Which spells/skills to NOT buy so that I can afford my horse
---
Between all the games and other entertainment services out there vying for our attention, trying to convince anyone to try something new will be hard.  Especially if they are having to pay $15/month on top of that.
---
It might be easier to try and find new *'friends'* in game to hang with.  The benefit is they if they are already playing then the hard work *(convincing them to play)* is already done.
---
Alliance side visc, sapph are the only god tier. Also fights like week 1 golemagg, domo, vael, firemaw, huhu. Renew/shield precast abuse let's priests outperform paladins heavily on these fights
---
Yeah. Classic is just full of friends for the taking. Everyone is such a friendo in classic. Klesik is full of frends. Don't need to be interesting just need to need a friend. Everyone will want to be your friend in classic.
---
I will be grinding out to prime Thanatos retro synth wave.
---
That shit is the tits for playing WoW
---
I'm the same. I've tried to finish the latest tomb raider &amp; assassin's creed but I just can't stick to them, not to say they aren't fun because they are but when it comes to the next day I just can't be bothered, lol.
---
To top it off, I still have no idea what class I want to actually play come classic.
---
Started playing on a private server, made some friends, got my epic mount and four epic drops from ZG and AQ20 in one day after hitting 60 with 500g to spare, and when my guild asked me in caps lock unison how I managed this, I realised that when I'm the only one farming fade leaf by just leveling herb along with my character, then it's sensible that they sell for 30g a stack and finance my everything on day one. 
---
Zero fulfilment.
---
I need the competition. I need the failing to hit my timings on milestones. I need the struggle. I need the help from others. I need the wiping in raids. 
---
I need pain to make the rewards valuable.
---
Eh.. it varies from person to person for sure, but this post is about being unable to enjoy their free time. School/work/familial time are completely different mindsets and a gaming addiction is only harmful when it starts impeding on those aspects of your life. I would put social in there as well, but for many of us that need is met in WoW.
---
it is not only the blind, stoneform is a ultra luffa that removes bleeds aswell, giving you a guaranteed vanish against other rogues
---
You spelled 29 wrong
---
Gold price will be the same as in BFA when you adjust for ingame inflation.
---
They can just put "no right click" javascript!
---
No one will know until you pop shadow form, I mean until they notice the stormstrike debuff on the boss.
---
No. Assuming this is in a BG they're going to save it for something else. Also keep in mind this in vanilla and not every class PvP trink breaks stun. Lock trinket for example only breaks charm/fear/poly
---
Super cringe
---
Sounds fine as long as you're okay with doing all your quests, dungeons, and raids as a druid.
---
I think this may have been the push I needed to roll Gnome.
---
That's not toxic behaviour to me at all.
---
 Toxic behavior is ninja looting, constantly talking about politics/society/economy/religion in chats etc.  Shit like that.
---
People who use the word "toxic" to describe anything other than chemical compounds are douches, and probably overly sensitive millenials. I remember back in the day when people had a sense of humor and weren't offended by everything someone said in a game. If you didn't like something, you ignored it. 
---
 I think this is the main reason why the WOW, even classic, communities will never be like they used to be. These days everyone participates in the victim and "I'm offended" Olympics.
---
Great site, is there one for retail?
---
Oh agreed, i was talking in terms of gear - which has always been the main issue of wow pvp in every expansion, ever since they tried the whole competitive arena rating format.
---
So sad you make it seem like your only life is in a game
---
I feel like this is some of the worst advise the classic community advocates. I get the logic but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that waiting for nodes to spawn will waste time
---
Same with hunter. New bow makes a difference.
---
You do get half the xp but for some quests you need to kill twice the mobs since quest drops aren't always shared (usually not) so in a way that can make up for part of it.. Or more if you are truly unlucky
---
We do. Why they don't just sell them on the vanilla AH? I don't really know. Probably because people would freak. This way the #NOCHANGE crowd feels they aren't in vanilla, but blizzard still gets the money from selling tokens.
---
That's funny. I was on Blackwater Raiders in vanilla and it was packed.
---
I'm most excited to see where classic goes six months to a year from now.
---
I'm least excited about the people who have been stuck on Vanilla for 15 years and see this as finally being their time to shine.
---
Hue hue hue
---
Most excited to play Classic WoW for the first time
---
Least excited about ganking assholes so I'll start on a PvE server until i figure out WTF to do
---
As has already been pointed out a number of class homogenization did start in wotlk, like rogues and sp getting aoe. No1 is saying it was a ton - certainly not compared to cata - or even necessarily bad, but it did start then.
---
Uhhh I'm pretty sure it was Cairne's arch-druid buddy, or 2nd in command i forget....one of the top cows in Thunder Bluff.... that persuaded the Horde's leadership into allowing the Forsaken to join.
---
most excited: playing against good players in an environment that requires dedication and skill. 
---
least excited: people/guilds demanding retail achievements
---
I’ll be sure to body camp those who do this. Someone great once said, "_Those who break rules are trash, but those who abandon their comrades are worse than trash!_”
---
Wow. Almost made me cry. I leveled a prot warrior in vanilla till the start of BC and I soloed most of it. It was absolutely grueling. I was thinking of doing a paladin for classic but this makes a strong argument for going back to to my roots.
---
This is exactly what is happening to me. I’m trying to use this as motivation and I’m building my own google doc for leveling custom to me. This is helping me prepare correctly and spend the time working on something helpful.
---
Servers are gonna be slammed during launch. I don't even have plans but I'm holding off for at least a week until things are stable.
---
How would a streamer free server work?
---
Bish please, a horse? Druid flying mount
---
Uhh no. Only some of the classes trinkets even remove stuns and that's rough to use a 5 min cd on a 2 second stun
---
No such thing as toxicity toward the other faction.  You're supposed to hate then.
---
its being released at 11pm GMT so im just assuming its not going to be too busy and do an all nighter to get ahead
---
Thus why I'm probably going hunter, it just sounds fun and most likely gonna be an alt. I've just had the idea in my head for months now. And it would apply to all world pvp and pve as well. People expecting to die are very grateful for timely heals if you show up in time.
---
Yeah i hate that this happened, in general and to you guys. See you for better times in classic!
---
Anyone else turned on?
---
&gt;Except for Paladins that go down the Holy tree?!!!    LOL
---
I was planning on using octopus, but id love to see your script aswell mate. 
---
Anything helps!:D
---
Until you get a weapon from MC it will.
---
Awesome I'll take a look at it, thanks for the help!
---
It's not effective for anyone.
---
Judging by that comment, you’re probably gonna have a mental breakdown if you roll on a PvP server. Just a heads up.
---
I feel ya mate. Get me back to Australia so I can relive a simpler time!
---
Fuck what the
---
All things being equal, healers are always in higher demand than dps.
---
I remember specifically one of the rare-cases where everything was set up for a symmetric combat on a PvP-Server:
---
I was fighting some scorpid in Tanaris on my Lvl 45 NE-Priest. Then I see a Lvl 45 UD-Warlock coming towards me.
---
I was like: "Now that will be really interesting!"
---
She /wave ed and then she put Curse of Agony on the mob I was fighting.
---
Yes, it may be hard to find. Open any web browser and type, “Vanilla Rogue Guide” or “Classic Rogue Guide”. 
---
If instructions are unclear, unplug computer and throw it from window because the internet is too difficult.
---
I'd love to join this server with my group if we can keep the faction somewhat balanced. My guess is that this forum is mostly Horde (my group is) and PVP servers tend to draw Horde players too. 
---
Hopefully that's a problem that we can overcome.
---
Some packs can act as a dmg check as well as require additional abilities to be used.
---
As in let the mage sheep one, the rogue may sap one enemy as well as the lock banish a demon etc.
---
Some packs will wreck you if you dont do it.
---
It applies shadow weaving.
---
Tried both, found respecing at 40 to be better - both versions work, though. Latest I'd personally respec is 44, which is when you get a new rank of mindflay.
---
We are all Thex:)
---
This way sound like a stupid question but you go into a bit of detail on what makes druid less efficient? And what are some things I can do to be as effective as possible.
---
And that's when you...
---
"Honey. I love you. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't go clubbing. I don't go out to bars to watch sports. I don't go out at night and engage in questionable activities. I stay home. Where it's safe. And secure. And calm. And I play a video game that costs less than 20 bucks a month. So. Not only am I NOT spending money, but I'm being responsible about my free time. What would you prefer me to do?"
---
Immature, my ass. Just saying.
---
I get what you're saying but it's not illegal simply because politicians and lobbyists also use these laws too their benefit. We understand it's not illegal. I'm saying that it should be.
---
Fair enough &lt;3
---
Because every single point I made mentioned in this thread had an implied respec to Shadow at 40 and you disputed it despite me making it extremely clear. When half of your leveling is better in Holy spec than Shadow spec, yet you want to put Shadow as GOD-TIER and Holy as SHIT-TIER then yeah obviously it needs to be clarified that you only meant level 45-60 when Shadow is actually a solid mid-tier leveler. How can you say one is a good leveler when it literally is not a good leveler until X level? That's like saying "Well no, Disc Priest is a top tier leveler once you get Power Infusion and 14 points in Holy"
---
It only increases damage of SWP if it lasts the entire duration, so you can't just chalk it up to more damage. The only reason I clarified that is because you made it abundantly clear you haven't read the talent tree in 15 years.
---
Yeah exactly. I would pick those up with a majority Holy spec because they are tier 2 talents. Just like picking up Imp PW:S at 60 for Shadow doesn't automatically make you a Disc priest. The hit could be debated but I don't want you getting your panties in a twist talking about Shadow Word: Pain miss chance.
---
No, Mind Flay does less damage than wanding before level 36. Pretty much no matter what wand you have. The slow is okay but you aren't casting a hard-cast shit damage slow on melees in PvP lol. I already keep saying I go Shadow while leveling because Silence and Blackout are nice in PvP, but if I go on a PvE server then it's definitely Holy til 40.
---
You're spreading information as shadow being good because that is the assumed spec since day 1. Nobody looks at the god damn talent trees. JUST READ THE TALENTS. Holy shit dude look at how many unused talents there are to get to Shadow Weaving, then take into account that the only benefit you get from Shadow Weaving pre-40 is a 3% damage increase to SW:P at 2 solid points. 
---
Either way it doesn't matter because you need 10 talent points to level a Priest to 40. I just don't see why you would willingly gimp yourself into Shadow. You're essentially throwing in 20 levels of talent points to get Shadow Weaving for a 3% SW:P damage increase if you're questing/leveling.
---
It's fantastic to play games with friends + bots and just 1v1, 2v2 etc.  The bots are pretty much fodder though occasionally they will pull off ridiculous headshots. 
---
Pubg just made this change as well but only on the 'test server'- you can now do custom games with whatever group size you want.  Previously you needed a minimum of like 8-10 or something, but now you can just get your normal squad or a few friends and all agree to drop in one location, or do war mode or whatever
---
You know a druid kinda unifies the advantages of both?
---
Especially rogues.
---
except druid FC's will be OP as fuck with travel form and no one else has mounts.
---
I wanna scratch that itch but I'm gonna willingly wait around a week or so before I start up due to how crowded it'll be
---
Might also depend on the wand you have at the time.
---
Ya thats good advice, ultimately I'm gonna play what I want.
---
Just a heads up I've been on a PvP server for the past 13 years without problem, and been with Warmode on for the past year. Some people just like to talk outta their ass, though.
---
I’ve been playing diablo 2 to get my mind right. It’s what I was doing before I got vanilla wow for my birthday
---
Pretty sure that poster is being sarcastic, implying they want all the nodes to themselves.
---
You won't be sitting around waiting for nodes, just grabbing them as you quest will max the skill and get you some nice cash.
---
I don't know how accurate the polls are since I imagine the population taking them skews heavily towards most excited to play
---
Nice RetroWoW gameplay video !
---
hey, no problem, entitled lazy shit.
---
I cannot suggest shaman more. It's a fun af class to play. 
---
Cons:
---
-kinda slow levelling unless you know how to optimize (firebrand dagger/sheid)
---
-totem management (not as bad with an addon)
---
-your professions will be a hard thing to choose (but also a lot of freedom)
---
Pros:
---
AOE heal
---
Every raid wants you cuz buffs
---
Early wolf form at level 20
---
Tanky healer in PVP because mail armor/shield
---
Ele/Resto in PVP is a really strong healer/burst DPS spec
---
Enh Shaman has meme spec 1 shot fun
---
You *are* the spellblade of the horde. You wield magic buffed melee weapons and also lots of magic
---
Totems provide some hench benefits like Windfury
---
The sooner you cap put gathering profs, the sooner you will make a metric shit-ton of gold. Especially fresh 60 with no competition.
---
https://i.imgur.com/h8r0F.jpg
---
Imo getting feline swiftness and heart of the wild as fast as possible while leveling will serve you best. Then you can go into resto. Even if you plan on healing every dungeon and not tanking, I'd still recommend this.
---
I took the week after off for this exact reason.
---
People crying because there's sharding (or whatever they're calling it) - but it is so needed at launch, and because of backlash they might not use enough.
---
Lol if you're waiting for nodes, you're doing it wrong.
---
Corporations effectively deal with double taxation already. There are taxes the business pays, but then profits taken out of businesses personally are taxed in the same way you are.
---
Lol who takes professions whole leveling?
---
If you're a casual player who isn't trying to rush raiding, then I wouldn't be looking for a guild pre-launch unless you want to be really prepared. If you're casual you won't ding 60 until November so right now you're trying to prepare yourself for something that isn't very important to you, 3 months in advance.
---
Just put yourself in a like-minded guild during the leveling process and go from there.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5G6bWFzCtE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5G6bWFzCtE)
---
You'll totally get raged at.  
---
Tanking is very hard, so you **will** fuck up every once in a while, and it's also very important, so your fuck-ups **will** be felt by the rest of the party.  They will rage.
---
Depends on the guild, but generally they will have people ready in the guild ready to backup already, and your chances of getting any loot are very slim because I'm not familiar with anyone except pick up grounds that actually rolls on raid loot.
---
WoW Classic is ALL ABOUT COMMUNITY. And hating people, /spit ing and /slap ing, is all part of community.
---
Dude I actually shed a tear. This was great! My fantasy levels were up high and my thoughts basically switched from movies, to actual war and of course WoW. Great piece.
---
Troll of course
---
There is only one race in the game that has a proper mohawk.
---
If you're on a PvP server, Rogue is really clutch.  You choose your battles and if there are lots of ganking in a particular zone, you can at least avoid some of it by sneaking around it.  You can also solo a lot of quests by sneaking past guys and going straight to the target and popping all CDs.  I've only ever played Rogue and I love it.  You'll have lots of competition in terms of DPS but learn the class well and supplement in all possible ways (e.g., fishing, lockpicking) and you'll be in demand for just being a generally good player.
---
Kid? I fucking wish! lol
---
Riiiiiiight. Was going to say this.
---
Least excited for general and trade chat just turning into twitch chat :( ... hopefully it doesnt happen
---
Min-maxing is not mutually exclusive with casual. To the contrary I would expect casual players to be more min-maxed in order to be more efficient with their time.
---
Yup. you got me. :D
---
Thanks for all the insight, very helpful! The PvP portion of Rogues is definitely one of the higher points I am looking forward to. And if I did go Priest it would be heals but thanks for the info on the Shadow Priest!
---
I was playing WC3 Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne SP, just to get into the lore again
---
Hype just got worse
---
There is some truth to this though. More casual guilds might have longer raids with more scheduled per week. Hardcore guilds can do all the content in two raid nights at 2 hours each.
---
WITHOUT ENGLISH CLIENT ON RUSSIAN SERVERS IT'S BAD
---
Late answer, but yes I found the second song, it was from Naruto
---
second movie: Naruto The Movie 2 OST - Ding! Dong! Dang!
---
Ah cool yeh that exploit would have been fun in tbc in those older
---
vanilla zones since they never added trees and such in places u could not visit otherwise!
---
I do remember a bug in TBC I forgot how exacly  you did it, but you could fly in the air without a mount, so it looked like u were swimming, that was quite crazy and probably could get u banned.
---
Nice thanks for the heads up!
---
Tarren Mill is going to be a total war zone and I'm here for it.
---
It's just not tenable. That money is supposed to work its way to state coffers so it can be used to improve infrastructure and whatnot. Going through hoops in order to avoid being a responsible company is about as smart as cheating on your exam. 
---
Them using it to shower their shareholders with money and consolidate their business position is not helpful. Not to the society that allowed them to reach this position, nor to the innovation of the gaming industry.  I mean, what has Blizz done in the last decade? Released a bunch of cyclical expansions, a TF2 clone and now they're re-issuing a 15 year old game.
---
Ye I figured shortly after I could scroll down in the flair section. I'm a Warrior, I'm slow.
---
Oh yeah, I totally get that. I usually have Bars at the bottom and WeakAuras in the middle.
---
I'll be completely honest, if you're rolling on a pvp server, you should expect asshole-ness.  If you don't want to be corpse camped, roll on a pve server.
---
Think Blizzard will announce which servers are east coast and which are west coast?
---
It was a response to OP mentioning nodes and many seem to forget small things from Classic.

# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
**Who are we?**
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
Right now, we still have a few slots open for **Mages** and **Warriors** especially, but we will consider all applications. You can always find our up-to-date recruitment status on our guild website (linked at the bottom of this post).
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefish/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids: Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to raid from 8:30 to 11:30 CET. Earlier starting times may be considered for weekends, depending on players' turn-up.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to apply on our site:  [https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/](https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/)
---
I see no problem with botters, they always helped me kill my mobs. Just gotta be quick with the tagging :)
---
Hey, I'm Bristol based.   Will be playing very casually but would be cool to hang out with locals!   Can you send me a link?   Cheers
---
I’m gonna be the guy who Power Fortitudes everybody I see and gives away greens and bags in Goldshire. I won’t have to worry about getting ganked as I will be on PvE server. Hoping once I hit 15+ I’ll be available to heal any dungeon and help with any quests for guildies. 
---
I can’t wait for Classic 😭
---
spamming attack button in morrowind, i remember doing that. also, why is my green bar always empty, why cant i hit anything, and when i do hit why dont i do much damage
---
nowadays /world is barrens
---
&gt;"Xshamanx, drop mana tide"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"...Xshamanx, we need your mana tide"  
---
&gt;"..."
---
If you can make up a good excuse for this situation, you're probably good to go.
---
There was a post almost identical to this 2 days ago. I come here for classic WoW content, not weirdos complaining about a game they don't like
---
I believe that was Wrath. My Pally hit 70 around 3 months before Wrath hit, so my memory may be skewed, but I’m fairly certain that Wrath was where seals and judgements really changed.
---
Engineering perhaps. Or if you want to make gold then Mining is a solid option.
---
Thank god, for once im glad to be in Massachusetts. Streamers can be good, but the biggest ones always seem to have egos for some reason
---
If you’re practicing for “best case” in every duel you’re not going to get better. Of course a hunter or warlock or mage can range a warrior for an entire duel and win. You’re not good because you started off at max range and ended at max range. Learning to balance your utility CDs take the pressure, kite well, and win the duel is the entire point of dueling. I’m not suggesting you let a charge and face tank the entire duel, but to not let the warrior charge is the same as not letting a rogue open imo.
---
King RP levels here. Keep it up mate (and your first aid skill too)
---
I know about 10 people rolling horde hoping for streamer free server.
---
Shadow is not shit for raiding, every raid needs 1 shadow priest for Shadow Weaving.
---
Undead have some restrictions on Tauren Mulgore/TB quests....
---
Like the main Wells quests... and later Compendium of the Fallen SM quest...
---
I was going to make a joke about inventing things to worry about that can't be controlled and are a year away, but then I realized that's pretty much what we do here.
---
And how large % of the entire pvp population do you think will have farmed a rare spawn for a single item?
---
While Tidal Charm is good, it wont exactly be common.
---
I'm sure there's plenty of dissonance like this out there, but honestly some of this translates well to a good casual guild.
---
That timetable is an obvious no, but presenting your timetable up front is a must if that's going to be the main factor for people.
---
A good loot system is also important if casual, the odds of people dropping off is way higher and you don't want to lose a lot of loot to that. Focus on the long-haulers as much as is reasonable.
---
As for missing raid nights, if you sign up show up. If the guild has less active players replacing you on the spot is going to be a bigger deal, and running late will be more impactful on people with a schedule to keep.
---
There's a distinction between the people who call anything but no-lifing casual, and the people who want to do casual play in a organized and effective way. Just felt the need to clear that up a bit.
---
If anyone ever tells you that you need a retail Achievement tell them to lick your bear form asshole and they are trash
---
/r/cripplingwowcoholism
---
To each their own. People get a little over zealous in dungeons and runners become a real issue when your mage isn't there to sheep. Ultimately, it sounds like you've run with some decent group but if it's pre level 40 and I'm running a PUG. I'm taking my time. I'd rather take the extra time in between fights waiting for everyone to drink instead of running back to the instance because of a wipe and then having to possibly deal with respawn if its the second or third wipe.
---
&gt;Truth is that you are looking at bfa with vanilla eyes and thats really stupid. The game now is completely different than it was. If you are judging a game based on 15 year old standards you are doing it wrong.
---
That may be true.
---
Alternatively, I may be looking at it (retail) with MMORPG eyes and I fail to see any MMO or RPG in it. Game feels like a single player game and looks like an action combo fighter game.
---
Azeroth doesn’t deserve the cow race
---
Classic reddit
---
Levelling up and farming mats. I'm gonna sit on a stockpile of herbs and ores until level 60.
---
It's not that bad, especially not in the first phase.
---
Less so once you have your pvp trinket but yeah, warlocks and shadow priests could be nasty though an undead rogue is more equipped to deal with them than others.
---
Personally I had a love/hate relationship with playing against warriors.  If you can deadzone them so they can't charge you but can't attack you either you feel like a god but it's a tough matchup and if they get their hands on you they can fuck you up.
---
Because it doesn’t make you a better player.
---
I honestly do the same thing. I have all my &gt;15 min CDs on a giant ass bartender bar to click them, same with potions and other on demand consumes. 
---
But my standard tanking/dps rotation, all bound to my mouse with Ctrl and shift modifiers.
---
I'm not disagreeing because retail reps are definitely time gated - but which one(s) only have 3 WQ a day?
---
you may have made this in jest but this is the wow community now and this will happen and its not funny

The amount of people planning on playing rogue this time round seems astronomical. I noticed there were loads in the beta, but at the moment especially, the amount of people saying they will be  playing rogue has exploded.
---
It's not a joke, Sylvanas has - since the start of WoW - been all about creating a new plague and using it to turn the living to her side.
---
Same as the Scourge.
---
Is it bad that I have no idea what you're even talking about?  Always played Horde and never really bothered with doing deadmines.
---
My PvP playstyle of priest is made up wholly of Mind Control with some healing sprinkled in..... It is very situational, but fun AF....  Just sayin  =]
---
What's war-mode
---
True! TY

In what country do you live? i know of no country where this is true.

Companies are taxed on their profit only, that is why transferpricing "works", because there is no profit, technically.

I know of no country where a companies pay salaries from their taxed profit.

On pserver I tested this with an Orc which I walked to Deathknell.  Got there level 1 and was able to access the first quest no issues.  Will test on the stress test because someone said that in the beta they were not able to access their class quests in a different starting zone (that is, at level 10 you get a class quest and if you're not in your natural starting hub it was not available, so I would like to check that since I do plan on taking my Orc Rogue to Tirisfal to get UC rep early).
---
Drop Enamored Water Spirit and hope they don't notice.
---
druid has 1 button. healing touch
---
This was not a message from a reporting system it's a troll thing people would type to trick people into typing /afk and leaving the BG.
---
guess ive to roll horde to not end on the short stick
---
Opinion: Casual guild /= looking to clear MC within the first month. - Discuss.
---
Like demographic when they actually existed.
---
Who needs family when you have Azeroth?
---
Most excited about the world/playing with my friends.
---
Least excited about elitist assholes that tells everyone how bad others are cause they don't level with THE optimal build etc.
---
EdgeLord was in WotLK
---
Thanks, that makes sense. I guess I'll be suitable as an emergency healer if the guild doesn't have any other healers online, which suits me fine.
---
Not going through puberty.
---
The issue is that the companies write the tax laws, give them to lobbyists that then give them to the lawmakers to make law. It's not about being smart, it's about using wealth to create laws that make you even wealthier. It's not smart, it's corruption.
---
i spotted the healers ;)
---
Look in the classic wow guild discord, https://discord.gg/EyGndJ
---
It should go to the most dedicated player who can equip it.
---
That's a good question, I'm going to reactivate my sub tomorrow for the Stresstest and take a look.
---
Most excited: PvP be a clusterfuck of people 2-3 shotting each other
---
Least excited: the lack of transmog, if I don't wear my full tier set I'm going to look like I'm getting dressed up for a PRIDE event
---
As a woman who was repeatedly told I don't come across feminine enough to roleplay as a woman, and I should just stick to men... You will never roleplay in a way that pleases everyone, so just don't be a dick and you will be fine.
---
I second engineering
---
Cheers thanks!
---
She is a dragon
---
No way dude that's dumb lit 💯
---
Yeah still not how it works. You start out by downgrading to rank 3 and as You get more + healing rank 4 becomes the most optimal.
---
Hi Doge, thanks for your message. Yes, attendance is expected for all 3 raid nights if we have content to clear.
---
It’s been forever since I played retail so maybe they changed it. I know in legion seemingly the only way to get rep was world quests. I still haven’t unlocked any allied races. The game doesn’t keep my attention when I can do the quests I need in an hour then I have to wait fir the next day to get the quests I want done.
---
Honestly, I kind of disagree with some initial parts. Back then, Blizzard officially supported Linux via WINE and gave tech support + made sure builds ran.
---
Your audio problems were probably due to configuration or compatibility. I don’t remember “lots of quirks” in 2005. In the years after Blizzard dropped support and that is when you needed a lot of extra configuration in the form of quirks to run WoW optimally.
---
“Yeah I got a mana totem”
---
*drops a mana spring totem and stands on top of it hoping no one will notice”
---
doesnt matter. even if there was no replacement for warstomp at all it would still not be remotely a contest. 
---
we are talking about 30+% of resisting the by far far far most common cc in the game. 
---
lets not even talk about the fact that warstomp range is actually a huge problem considering the huge leeway that will essentially allow moving melee enemys to attack you from outside warstomp range.
---
to try and make a contest out of warstomp vs hardiness is laughable at best.
---
Play the game as it suits you. That’s the wonderful capability of Classic WoW. I think you should look for a causal guild to level alongside with and build that sense of community. As you finally hit the 60, your guild might evolve along with you or thereafter you can start looking for a raiding guild that fits your availability. Unless you don’t plan on PvE and would rather PvP, then look for a causal/PvP guild.
---
Whatever you decide, remember, have fun.
---
If something is worth worrying about, it's best to shine some light on it so it can get on blizzards radar, they have fixed some issues that have been brought up on this subreddit.
---
But you never countered the Dwarf. You just used sleeping dust. The dwarf can do the same thing to you but you couldn’t break the blind
---
Franklins
---
They take meme builds and are casuals. Obviously they need to raid 15 hours a week.
---
I'll min max and do it in 2 hours cos I have a job and a life thanks.

It don't think it really matters because no one uses 2h melee weapons in raids.
---
Whoever wants to use their DKP on a novelty item can be my guest.
---
Bank alt helps with bag clutter but introduces a whole new way to spend time.
---
These days NTFS is at least stable but there is definitely some overhead. You probably won’t notice a difference if you have an SSD.
---
Aquiring enough stuff from the low-level raids is enough for any PvPer. So the gear difference argument only holds true in theory. In practice you’d just do some MC runs once a week like everyone else. 
---
Unless you are a solo queue’er who doesn’t collaborate with others in-game.
---
&gt; In Vanilla, dungeons aren't a race. 
---
I'm not sure if people are going to have to go complete old school with marking up every pack and CCing every mob and going by kill order but I think people who didn't play vanilla/bc will be in for a shock at how much different dungeons were. There's definitely no rushing Scholomance or Strat if you're still gearing out of it for example.
---
Can you turn off XP gain? Or was this a thingfrom a later expansion  when you would gain XP from pvp?
---
(Or am I completely wrong?)
---
Wow
---
that's a thing
---
solid
---
I'm pretty certain they will, or maybe they'll keep true to their roots and the old servers will fit the timezones by name?
---
Imagine a game that a class is exactly a gm to avoid people abusing, afking,  pking lowbies, doing ninja loot, beeing toxic, disloyal faction actions, dishonorable actions, toxicity talk, trash talk. Etc
---
Main porpuse of these classes would be ban the player taking the character to a court or some prison for relieving the penal actions.
---
Imagine! :0
---
Jokes on you pleb, I already camp, kill on site and /spit people for no reason in world pvp on private vanilla servers and will continue on Classic. I also will make it a point to crap on retail players for supporting the destruction of this game.
---
I think vanilla did it fine. The problem was we didn’t know that till we were 60. You didn’t know which classes were more utility. We do this time. So it’s annoying when someone knowingly plays that class and cries because they can’t tank or do solid dps.
---
Under which scenario?   It's his for enhancement for quite awhile.  Also, what defines most dedicated, and how much does the guild help?
---
Shaman should not get priority, it doesn’t make sense. It’s better in the hands of a warrior.
---
Warriors can, 2h fury is a thing
---
Needs a Rob Zombie cover...
---
You’ll be just in time for all the other chatting, helpful and relaxed players that are there for the leveling experience as all the min/max figet spinners will be at 60 asking when is TBC out.  :)     
---
     
---
More importantly, enjoy your damn holiday, we got years to play classic now!
---
The first person who makes the hammer.
---
Retribution paladins were often made fun of and not taken as a serious DPS role in endgame classic PVE. I had sulfuras and other top tier gear yet my guild would almost never let me DPS during progression raids. 
---
However, if you really gear the hell out of yourself and play well, you can stay towards the top of the DPS charts.
---
For PVP, a geared ret pally can 1 or 2-shot people if luck is on their side. Although it can be kinda awkward sometimes when you're basically just auto-attacking, missing, and not getting a single seal of command proc and you end up dying to someone who sucks. 
---
Holy pallies will likely be in very high demand.
---
I can't speak to protection, never played it. 
---
source: was azjol-nerub's top geared pally in classic for awhile.
---
everyone with better gear is a no-life looser virgin and everyone with worse gear is a piece of human trash noobshit
---
I wish people would stop posting this.  Not everyone has been reading this sub religiously, multiple times per day for months.  There are a lot of new guys here, who are welcomed by the way.  
---
Sure they can search, but they are also just posting and chatting, which is great for the community.  
---
If you dont want to respond, then dont say anything.  But taking the time to type out a response like this contributes nothing to anyone.  It's a lose lose.  Imagine "where do I find Hogger?".  Response: "Try Google"................
---
Com'on folks, we're better than this.  Let's goooooo for Classic.
---
I heard that marriage is a coffin of which children are the nails.
---
You need to add in getting the rest of the group for the instance. There is no standard World Chat in Classic, that is a pserver feature, so you're limited to spamming in trade if you want to reach people in Kalimdor, and nobody is going to be in Darnassus.
---
Personally I just don't duel specifically to avoid any idiotic made up rules.  I don't feel the need to lose a random duel to some over pompous idiot who blasts every CD, whines if he gets kited or doesn't get a perfect opener or whatever other made up nonsense.
---
I got my rank 12 in Vanilla, multiple Gladiators across multiple expansions and my Battlemaster and Arena Master titles back in Wrath, I feel pretty good about my ability in PvP without having to duel anyone to feel better about myself.
---
I'd literally rather just AFK between BG queues than sit outside Org dueling.
---
There were threads on the forums about the evils of clicking in vanilla in pvp. I’m not sure it makes a huge difference for every class in pve though. I’m left handed and use a standard mouse, and all my spells are bound. As a right handed person you have every advantage and even a normal mouse should cause you no trouble, it’s quicker and easier. But w/e do what you like. I think it may simplify things for you though.
---
I clicked the shit out of raiding and pvp, mainly during tbc though.  I was a shadow priest, and it honestly didn’t seem like a problem at all. I can understand it’s not optimal, but the rotations as a spriest is easy.
---
I bought a 12 button mouse, but not sure I’ll even bother with it.
---
Free action potions replace hardiness.
---
😎
---
I guess, but it seems pretty rare to start with, and seems like they prefer non-mace weapons, anyways.
---
Horde warriors want BRE.
---
Yes i can find simple guides. I asked specifically for anyone content creators like ebbnflow for rogues. Please read the question next time, instead of being a total dick
---
Look into how charities use that money and you'll quickly find out how wrong you are. The vast majority of charitable organizations spend their money on salaries and advertisement, often with less than 10% of the donated amounts going to the actual cause. On the other hand, taxes cover the much needed social programs, roads, education, and (in most 1st world nations) healthcare. Only the US tries to demonize gov't taxation.
---
have streamers announced servers yet? we're coming up on the date to reserve names
---
Warriors have much better options, so it's really not better for a warrior.
---
As somebody who played priest quite extensively, it's actually the opposite. 
---
Early on most of your gear is int and spirit gear. Getting the extra mana from mental strength is more beneficial than the extra healing power from holy at that point. A good early build focused around healing (not PI) looks something like this. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0551001305051-20505003032014
---
Once you get a decent amount of healing power from your pre-raid BiS gear you transition out of disc and into a holy build. You will naturally have less int and a lower mana pool, which means you get less value from mental strength. 
---
A good transition point is at around 300-400 healing power when you can start getting some real value from down-ranking. Holy build will look something like this.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0551001305001-205050030320145
---
For pure healing purposes, PI is never a good way to go. For fun / farm content sure it's good, but progression certainly not. Main problem is that PI is essentially a 6 point talent that gives a mage a moderate damage boost during his cooldowns while giving you 0 healing benefit. The sacrifice you have to make from the holy tree to get those points is pretty detrimental.
---
See some people enjoy spending hours trying to complete quests while getting ganked.
---
But I’ll be over on the PvE server actually questing and dungeoning and having fun my way. I can run a WSG or AB if I want some PvP
---
You do NOT need to sub to install the Classic client. It should be there in the drop down version list for everyone.
---
90% of the behavior of the most popular streamers is an act. I don't really get why people enjoy that kind of thing but it's not unique to Twitch streamers. Think about how shit most TV shows are, it's the same idea. For some reason a lot of people love that kind of stuff.
---
It's largely a vanity item, give it to the most dedicated player with gold to burn.
---
If someone has recipe, crafting w/o tip is common for guilds but people often tip anyways.
---
For something that doesn't return dividends to the guild, any material help is pure generosity and not expected by reasonable people.
---
This is different from things like Nightfall, which are typically guild-funded entirely.
---
Clearly this is wrong. Your character does stuff when you click, so if you click more you make more attacks.
---
It's simple math.
---
How can he dispell sleeping dust or even cast it at this point?, Sleeping dust is a cast time, he won't have time to cast it, cannot remove stun/poison/sleep. Ofc it's a counter
---
Thanks, that makes sense. I guess I'll be suitable as an emergency healer if the guild doesn't have any other healers online, which suits me fine. 
---
My one last question would be what to sacrifice from NS feral to be able to take 5/5 Imp MotW? Without ever having played the class (I've only healed as disc/holy) I'm thinking 0/3 in Imp Rejuvenation and 1/3 in Reflection?
---
I watch most you tube videos on at least 1.25 and most at 1.5
---
kind of wonder if they could put a flag in there that creates a score based on   
---
distance traveled + damage done + abilities used + healing done + damage taken or some shit, i mean it should be pretty obvious if you add together the right things.
---
Trying not to nut, I have been thinking about classic plans.
---
Running a dungeon once for a quest run is fine. Repeated farming is not recommended in general. You have to clear extremely quickly to make it worthwhile.
---
Is this really for this sub? I’m here for classic not retail talk
---
Or just downvote and move on.  “This person complaining is old but please listen to my complaining.”
---
They are also evading taxes in countries you don't live in and we actually want payment for the use of our infrastructure when it is used to make millions of dollars.
---
Yes... at some point you're like "i dont have time for 2-3 raidnights in a full clearing wiping guild", "i better go hardcore, prepare a bit and clear everything in 3 hours on wednesday"
---
My friends and I made NPC characters and set up scenes for our characters personal story lines. We got kinda retarded with it.
---
The REAL Thrall.
---
What about resto 🥺
---
I have to imagine Hand of Rag is more dps, it's slower with already higher DPS.
---
I enjoy watching the videos to satisfy my hype. But I agree, I like to just pull up a text guide for everything so I can scan it for what I want.
---
Hahaha good one
---
But it has nothing to do with him being a dwarf. He could have done the exact same thing to you but his blind would at least work too
---
&gt; Why is the 50-59 bracket not an option?
---
Because there is no "50-59 bracket"
---
it's 51-60
---
There is a lot of pservers guides and beta feedback. You can also check Kargoz mage guide. Without actual access to Classic it will be hard to do any better. Fell warned/challenged.
---
Why would they want a sword over a mace unless they're a human?
---
***Everyone in the raid drops manatide***
---
you just posted cringe to the party chat you will loose loot
---
Again, I’m not familiar with some of the more recent lore but her initial plague was to fight the scourge with - not turn the living. Although this may have changed in the more recent expansions. 
---
Either way - I was just making a joke about picking a faction that was neither horde nor alliance. And even though they may now have similar motives or whatever assuming you’re correct - they are different factions.
---
pretty much: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXasCjUTNpE just with classic
---
Ah yes, guilt tripping the OP about something that hasn't happened yet
---
Yeah good luck convincing these guys. This reddit is full of “elitists!” and “toxic!” and all the other buzzwords to satisfy their insecurity. The most casual guild should 100% be trying to play optimal. The point of casual is less time. But in Reddit’s eyes, casual means wiping on Garr for three weeks because herp derp I have wife an kids now
---
While I see you're point, it definitely didn't need to be this way. Millions of players would gladly pay the sub for Classic separately.
---
Player effort being equal I would give it to the enhancement shaman.  I assume it will go to warriors though.
---
Troll
---
That's funny :-D
---
Sorry but I literally see zero scenarios in which retail achievements would be relevant. If someone were to ask you for it though, they have serious issues.
---
that doesn't sound like a good idea. somebody will start slacking and then everyone will resent them because they can't play now.
---
Rogue yes please
---
Because sword spec &gt; mace for PvE
---
I guess that's probably true since DME isn't even released until P2. However with layers you never know, if its too crowded there will only be Maura available for easy AOE.
---
Just make a guide, noone is gonna stop you jez.
---
I honestly hated them in vanilla and had a personal mission of getting several of them banned. Of course they will be in Classic, but the security measures of classic are significantly better now, so hopefully their impact on the quality of the game will be less.
---
Wrong lol
---
1 button healing is FAR more true of paladins than it is of druids.
---
You’d imagine wrong. Sword spec is much better, especially with windfury, and the proc on BRE is amazing.
---
There's no sword or mace spec unless you're arms.
---
That's bad.
---
Most excited about the RPG feel and the lack of transmog
---
Least excited about world buffs.
---
Again, how is dedication defined?  The biggest brown noser?  The GMs buddy?
---
By profits I mean profits for the actual people who own the company, not salaries. (Including even small fish investors receiving dividends from their few shares of stock).
---
So after corporate taxes, when people withdraw profits, they are taxed as individuals in the same way as other people. 
---
I’m just saying the corporate tax is another tax on top of what people think of traditionally.
---
Like when someone gets mad at the corporate tax rate being too low, and they are comparing it to their tax rate in their minds, it’s a flawed perspective, because it’s a separate thing on top of what individuals have to pay, not instead of it.
---
I live in the US.
---
But by that reasoning the Burning Legion only exists because of a need to exterminate everything beforr the Void Lords could get their grubby little ~hands~ psuedopods on them. Everything is because of them.
---
Better get that pally to level 12 ASAP so you can rez!
---
Completely useless, unless recorded on the beta server, which is no longer an option.
---
The stress test being capped at 15 doesn't exactly help either.
---
Truth is, aoe farming on launch will be a mix of not viable due to ganks/competition and not efficient due to changes observed on the beta client (mobs having more abilities, the potential of ranged/caster mobs to spasn instead of a melee in a camp, and the 5-7 minute respawn variance to name a few). If you want to know more about the differences, JokerD made a video about it that summed it up nicely.
---
It's not impossible, mind you, but it won't be viable for 99,9% of the mage population on launch.
---
herb if you want gold, engineering if you want to be a competitive PvP/PvE-er
---
By this argument same for shamans.
---
I think people are just using it to signify that they're the ones making the group. Not completely senseless.
---
Best RP happens on RP servers. Argent Dawn is the server with more players and day 1 guilds/players still hangin around.
---
RPPvP means half the playerbase rolled there to ruin RPers experience
---
&gt; I'm strongly considering rolling on an RP server
---
...
---
&gt; ...I don't have any interest in RP...
---
Ah I wonder if you're thinking of the Argus ones. I don't remember for sure either despite having done it back then.
---
I think it will naturally die out because twitch emotes make people sound like an idiots as text and chat doesn't scroll as fast - so people can actually read a full thought. I can see how it makes sense for Twitch when chat is buzzing by and the emotes are converted to images.  
---
Not that you won't see POGGERS in big city trade chat. Constantly.
---
That’s the best way to play! You’re pretty much free from this part then.
---
Interesting.  Do you still feel this way about classes that have issues questing alone like Warriors?
---
Not a problem for me, partially anyway. I bought a 1-month sub for another game and I'm playing it currently, and it'll end about a week before classic's launch. Within that week, I'll take that time to prepare :p
---
Yeah pretty sure that's [Desolace](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j4BmRnUEr2s/XCQpgLxMLFI/AAAAAAAAATk/QKqO1om_DAsUjUEocpj5i6eLFhYvg0_sgCEwYBhgL/s1600/desolace.jpg). It's a hideous zone that's like one giant elephant graveyard
---
Nope.
---
This is exactly why I'm sorely tempted to get 60 as soon as my schedule will allow. I had a blast in AB back in the day, but really only dueled outside of that, and even then just while I waited on queues. I'm hoping to get some quality wpvp in before BGs release... although idk if I'll manage it.
---
azuresong mageblade is a holy paladin weapon
---
Orc. Resisting a stunlock might be the only chance you have to survive a single rogue
---
But won't bosses effectively have 0 armor anyway with things like sunder and expose armor?
---
I usually only Duel with guild mates and friends because some people don’t seem to understand the concept of dueling to improve your skill... PvP ranking is honestly just a grind. You can be a complete baddy and have rank 12 as long as you play enough. It’s honestly not hard. What I’m saying here isn’t even uncommon; universally in the arena community Rogues and Druids (unless dueling rogue) get stealth opener. It’s courteous to allow Warrior charge in Classic (because they can’t charge in combat in classic like they can in retail). They aren’t “made up rules” this is “dueling etiquette” sure you don’t have to but you’ll look like a 10 yr old who’s mother smoked with you in the womb while you run away concussive shotting a War whom you never even let charge in the first place. 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Honestly, it's been long enough that I really do not remember the exact issues from that era.  I would have to, for posterity, say your likely correct on the compatibility aspect.   Either way, we are here in the now.
---
There is going to be peer pressure(I think). And if you reach a milestone, you can go level proffs, alts, etc. That's the idea.
---
Besides getting attuned to everything like people have said all I really ever did at 60 was just see what I could do solo(when not raiding or farming consumables). Something about going through dungeons and sneaking by mobs or seeing how many mobs I could take on was always fun to me, especially as I was getting better gear/skilled with the class. 
---
I was also obsessed with obtaining dumb items such as  [https://www.wowhead.com/item=12185/bloodsail-admirals-hat#reward-from-q](https://www.wowhead.com/item=12185/bloodsail-admirals-hat#reward-from-q)  which if I recall correctly I became hated by booty bay and all other areas like it but I was able to dress like a pirate with a sweet parrot... worth it.
---
I distinctly remember queueing for WSG, dinging 60, putting on all my BG exalted rep gear and using that last talent point then accepting the queue and wrecking the battleground for a game.
---
Same here. Its funny looking at loading screen maps and different lore inaccuracies through it.
---
Like Brill is south of Dalaran.
---
Or how Jaina sailed to Kalimdor with the Gilnean and Strahnbrad forces.
---
Of how Tyrande did things and was a capable warrior.
---
Just so silly
---
You can crash weddings, but don't crash funerals
---
You just know if something says "Not clickbait" that you should just walk away
---
Attendance, contributions (consumables, crafting, etc.), participation (class leaders/ anyone who helps others learn/gear, etc.).
---
Honestly though, having the personal gold is probably the deciding factor.
---
Based on 
---
&gt;Again, how is dedication defined? The biggest brown noser? The GMs buddy?
---
I don't think you need to worry about it.
---
Just tell them the truth "WoW Classic launch is a once in a lifetime event", you understand, right?
---
Thank you! Drop me a PM about the 3d unit frame so we can discuss it. I am not 100% sure that I know what you are looking for, but if we can get on the same page it may find it’s way in.
---
That first week of server problems, login server problems, servers before they had feature to prioritize reconnecting clients... you get a random crash or DC and you got put in the back off the Queue, sucked.... so I am looking forward to a productive first couple of months.
---
Shows up to all the raids, leveled their fishing, cooking, first aid and is donating consumes for raid, is part of the DM clear group for world buffs
---
You clearly don't live near a big city. It can take 20 minutes just to get from one side of a neighborhood to another inside the same neighborhood in a city. Getting outside the city takes time depending on your method of travel - outside of rush hour, you can drive in a reasonable amount of time (but again, definitely longer than 20 minutes). For a train it will take a mere few minutes to leave the city but from there it depends how far the train is going, and how far from the train your house is. You can live down the street from a train station and it still may take 10 minutes to get home, and that's close.
---
I don't know if you live in Podunk, USA but in any highly populated city and it's surrounding suburbs, stuff takes time, even without traffic.
---
Definitely. Hell, Gnomer is a wipe fest if the group isn't familiar and stuff isn't getting marked. Especially once you get to the dark dwarves part. There are just so many dungeons that have humanoid runners and pats that will wipe a group at full health and mana, let alone a group where the tank is running ahead to pull and leaving the group splintered.
---
I was looking at a tailoring guide last night and I have 0 intention of having a tailor in my first 3 level 60s.
---
Playing other games doesn't seem viable anymore.
---
auto-run IS more important
---
I get back from holiday on the 26th to reserve character names, and I'm between jobs from the 30th to the 9th... HELL YEAH for fortunate timing.
---
&lt;Scialytic&gt;   [A] NA-PvE | Raid Times Tues/Thrs/Sunday 8:30-10:30 PM Subject to change| Server TBD | DKP | EST
---
Thanks for taking the time to read about &lt;Scialytic&gt;!  You can find a more in-depth open letter on the website if you’re interested in more information
---
Guild Philosophy: Scialytic prioritizes its experience on each member getting the most they can out of it. There will be no loot council. No Elitism. We are for the people as a whole. We will not be min maxing our composition and are open to having different specs such as boomkins or ret paladins. We are WoW veterans and we will clear all of the content without having to worry about having an "optimal" composition. The game is about having fun and if you're a rogue and want to not be combat spec, you can be. It will not hinder our overall progression. What matters is competent leaders and players and this guild will live up that!
---
Requirements: There will be an age restriction for needing to be 21 years or older in this guild. If you resonate with our guild and our philosophy and might be younger than our policy and wish to speak to myself or an officer directly about it, we will not shut you away and will hear you out. But this is the standard policy we will follow. There will also be a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. However, feel free to be yourself and share your humor as there are no restrictions on swearing or who you are and have a drink or two with us when we play! 
---
Extra Info: There are also opportunities for people to apply for officer roles such as a class lead or raid leader for example. All of that information is available to the members on the full website when activated after membership.

Just to be clear, I’m not saying all charities are efficient. But you can purposefully choose a good one, or create your own nonprofit, or invest in a business that will create a product the world needs.
---
We clearly have very different ideas on the efficiency of government though. I’m not sure there’s a point in discussing it further here though lol.
---
Hand of Rag is a Shaman’s birthright.
---
Its up to blizzard. Twitch wouldn’t split the RuneScape directory into 2 until jagex told them to. And that took like 2 years because jagex wanted players to see both content to remind them that it’s there. I could see blizzard doing the same thing since they very much want players to also play retail because that’s where they make money from the cash shop
---
honestly if your guild members are that dysfunctional you need a new guild. guilds used to be all about helping each other not getting your stuff first then jumping to another guild or going solo. as long as you don't have a bunch of spergs it will all work out.
---
If you’re looking to be a healer, the a/d strafe is, imo, bad advice. As a healer, your mouse is occupied because you need to move your cursor around to heal people. You can’t mouse-turn *and* mouse-heal at the same time. This is less of an issue if you’re tank healing, since you won’t need your mouse to mouseover/click heal as much as say, a raid healer. But sometimes as a healer you need to turn and you need to heal, so you have to use a or d to turn.
---
lol downvoted without a reply because your monitor suxxx OP's crts dick off
---
With tailoring, I sometimes like skinning. Some tailoring crafts will require leathers, and then you also have a stockpile to sell for some extra gold.
---
If you need a good group of people to play with hit me up!
---
I don't believe so, but could be wrong.
---
I also don't remember if you can bring their armor into the negative to effectively boost damage even higher.
---
I will be playing Classic with approximately 10 IRL friends.  At some point we'll remake our old guild.  Friendly players we encounter while leveling will be welcome to join us.  There are no requirements other than not being an asshat.
---
Once we hit 60 -- ~1 month for the fastest of us, ~5 months for the slowest -- we will have fun doing 5/10 man content.  Maybe we'll do some MC/Ony pugs.  Maybe if we're feeling really ambitious, we'll host our own pugs, unless we're busy leveling alts or PvPing or something.
---
I expect there to be a lot of guilds like this.
---
I just hope summoning the gods can still be a thing every once in a while
---
yeah i guess it does sound like it would make sense, but I don't think that people want to give out their freedom to do whatever they want. but who knows, i hope everything works out for you guys :)
---
I'm playing a priest, so here is my plan:
---
Roll tailoring and enchanting first.  
---
Drop enchanting after crafting greater magic wand because that shit is OP until you get Gravestone Scepter around level 19.
---
Pick up mining until I've farmed enough materials to max engineering.  
---
Drop mining and tailoring for engineering and skinning.  Need engineering late-game, and skinning is good for gold farming.  I prefer it to herb/mining since you can basically level skinning while doing good gold farms.
---
I remember that I got serpent and arcane shot mixed up on my hunter for about the first 20 levels
---
There are a lot of things that go into making a raid happen that takes time and effort and gold. If you not only participate actively but go above and beyond and pick up the slack for others, you're dedicated.
---
Loads of people 😂
---
True, it’s still better regardless. The proc is better than the damage difference. Look at any bis 2h list, it’s gonna last you foreve.
---
Scholomance was home to the wierd tanks dungeon loot. The bloodmail and deathbone (?) sets were for paladin and shaman tanks, respectively. Bloodmail boots are actually passable warrior prebis.
---
Which says more about the quality of warrior boot options than the bloodmail set, but yeah.
---
It should go to whoever can afford to craft it on their own or just sold to to whoever is willing to pay for it.
---
Guilds should not be waisting their resources on vanity items and either put them towards Thunderfury or consumes for the raid.
---
Yeah and that extra step comes with huge risks
---
This. The Alt key is super easy to snag with the thumb. Don’t forget if you have a mouse with at least two extra buttons, you can use those plus alt/shift/ctrl and those mouse buttons. Adds 8 keybinds. I personally don’t like cntrl
---
Makes them be better players (IE not get knocked out of stealth).
---
Play Skyrim, but first go through an extensive modding process like the phoenix flavour. [https://thephoenixflavour.com/getting-started/](https://thephoenixflavour.com/getting-started/)
---
This will distract you to the point of possibly no-lifing it.
---
No warrior worth their salt would take HOR over bonereavers edge or Ashkandi.
---
good, so everyone just uses forum gold, or SOJ to trade items instead.  Maybe if there was some way to exchange goods at an even rate with with another.
---
We'll give the winner the 8 Sulfuras Ingots for free (and one to a dedicated Blacksmith after banking at least 8). In the event that we have absolutely no use for 10 Fiery Core and 10 Lava Core beyond selling them on the Auction House, they'll be for sale to raid team members at half price, but that won't happen until at least Phase 5. 
---
The 20 Dark Iron Bar, 50 Arcanite Bar, 10 Blood of the Mountain, and 25 Essence of Fire? Yeah, that's on the winner to come up with. And priority on the Eye of Sulfuras will go to those on the raid team with the rest of the items or the required money already in hand.
---
What will BRE even do? Don't bosses have effectively 0 armor with sunder and expose armor?
---
Spot chain heal and twist totems properly for warriors/rogues and you'll have a raid spot as an enhance shaman.
---
It doesn’t say if it will work with Classic.
---
You can just set up a macro to switch between the two on a regularly pressed button like jump.
---
Problem solved
---
I think av will be the last version, which nerfed the 48 hour turtle av games
---
AV is dead anyway since they use the wrong version
---
Does it work with classic?
---
Does anyone know if they are posting server times with the server lists?
---
ROTATION:
---
Pull targets &gt; Blizzard if possible &gt; Nova &gt; strafe/blink for max distance Blizzard (strafe preferred for mana) &gt; Blizzard &gt; CoC &gt; strafe with Arcane Explosion for the last part of their hp.
---
STAT PRIO:
---
Gear for intellect/stamina for mana and hp. You would usually gear for SP when going single target, but SP doesn’t help Blizzard. 
---
Ignore Frostbite, spend on Imp Blizzard.
---
Basic notes for AOE grinding. Check out Kargoz for a better explanation.
---
19:00-23:00
---
You can only mail to characters on the same faction and realm as you.
---
It’s extremely expensive to make and the only benefit to the guild is having some guy in your guild running around with a shiny hammer. 
---
Any minuscule amount of dps the raid gains from having someone with sulfuras is probably lost from that sulfuras taking up a debuff slot anyways. 
---
Aka, if someone wants it they ought to pay for it themselves.
---
Just spec pi and weaving and heal in between reapplying stacks
---
Is there data to back that up?
---
Given the 5-6 earth shock cd and your only other threat ability being rockbiter, idk how you'd tank more than one or two mobs at a time.
---
Thats how you fish reddit gold :)
---
Are you serious?  That's how most people define dedication, if we are being honest.  That's how everything typically works.   You promote the guy you like, not the one you don't know or dislike.  
---
Contributions  = brown noser
---
Class lead = someone you like and promoted
---
u can choose from other cool things like
---
"kings honor friend" 
---
"HUHH!"
---
my name is Jack and anybody taking my nickname should get banned
---
I'm not following since I don't play retail. What is the scheme here?
---
Making a judgment way to early, wand spec will make you strong. 2 mobs at once becomes trivial with fear
---
That's a little scary to be honest.
---
You sound like a shaman that really wants sulfuras lol
---
Do you mean the rogue ability expose armor? Because it doesn’t stack with sunder. There’s a reason annihilator is as good as it is.
---
Crow was a warlock wasn’t he?
---
The real reason imo: Many people check out their class in pvp then, as that is when your full kit starts coming to play - so if you twink that bracket, you can use gear to shit on others and feel validated, all the while even feeling like you're playing a complete class at max level. I'm not trying to take anything away from it, by all means do it and have fun, i might myself, but thats my opinion of the main reason 49s a good twink bracket.
---
This is what i was planning on doing as well. Have a warlock friend duo lvl me to 21 and then aoe grind to 30 in one sitting. Should put me far enough ahead to not have competition until 60. If there happens to be another mage or two in my layer doing the same thing its not that hard to switch layers (unfortunately).
---
Nightfall is bis foor enh for the entire lifespan of classic in raids right?
---
Well AFAIK Blizzard doesn’t support classic &lt;-&gt; retail gold conversion so it’s probably done at your own risk by trading manually with other people. Easy to get scammed.
---
Well either way, there is someway to get a boss' armor to 0, at that point, BRE doesn't add anything.
---
I agree, that's why I was looking for a guild prior to launch, so we could set a group of people to do some dungeons or level together. 
---
But there's no amount of min-maxing that that is going to get me in pre-BiS in one month while working 48 hours per week with an hour drive to work. My problem is not with min-maxing or optimal raid setups. I'm on lunch break browsing reddit because I have my build, gear progression, grinding spots and etc ready for months. 
---
 It's "catfishing" casual players because advertising your guild as mature is cool for some reason.
---
Sounds like you just don’t like or want to RP. 
---
Simple solution: you do what you want, let others do what they want.
---
You just transfer gold from classic to BFA to buy tokens. There's people suggesting guild be the third party, so the risk he's talking about will go away.
---
Indeed
---
Found the 15 year old fortnite player
---
If memory serves, that cloak was a spirit cloak with a little agi on it.
---
Which is still bad for a warlock, but hey.
---
Thank you friend. I’ll keep pushing lol
---
Honestly, probably the worse thing about rogue is the competition against other classes and namely, your own class. Your always bottom of the priority list and this is reflected in guild/raid admittance. Even if you don't want to raid, it's an overpopulated class.
---
You on October 1st: https://images.app.goo.gl/DKq46mxGTss53JDF7
---
Will it be the same sort of Holy Fire + Smite rotation we have now as new priests in retail?
---
You will be wanding. So, so, so much wanding.
---
You can still heal 5 mans all the way to 60 as shadow.
---
My pc won’t even boot properly anymore (and only 20 days from classic) I’m so sad :(
---
I hate that screen
---
Obviously. When it is payed out it becomes *income*. If this wasn't the case everyone would set up 1-man companies and be hired in as independant contractors to pay the coorporate taxrate instead.
---
Owners of coorporations are NOT taxed unfairly in the US. The absolute worst case for them is that they would have to pay the same as everyone else on their income.
---
Yeah but why type /me when you can shave off a letter.
---
Why do people expect other people to donate consumables to the raid?  
---
The guild should be swimming in gold.  What are you guys doing with it?
---
Kinda, usually by the time you have a few to most pieces of T1 is when your gear offsets the output loss from switching.
---
Even though they are one if the worst classes for the debuff uptime, having them world nightfall is one of the only reasons to even bring an enhancement.
---
Thats a juicy one
---
Least: The private server players (despite inaccuracies in p servers they will have the upper hand) 
---
Most: The shared experience, back in 2004/5 social media wasn't what it is now.
---
Honestly this. The niche group of pure "min/max" guys kinda come off as elitists. Not all, but some.
---
Wouldn't you be the horse and not the person pulling it?
---
1/10 meme
---
this shits hard
---
Indeed, i might hit 60 before 2020 lol
---
Is MC the only raid that's ever going to be available in classic?
---
I'd be interested in this. My guild is up to about 40, rolling alliance on NA-PvP, and we're mostly east coast. 
---
Who is going to manage this coordination?
---
The only way to fix the issue is to have GMs pop in to examine the player being accused via reporting. This is too costly, so it's not an option. Therefore getting rid of click reporting is the correct choice.
---
Blue screen of death :(. Good luck. Sometimes it’s an easy fix.
---
Say I want BFA gold (game time). I need to find somebody who wants to buy vanilla gold. They can buy a token and sell it for BFA gold. Then they trade me the BFA gold (game time) for vanilla gold. 
---
The trade could look as innocuous as somebody giving somebody a righteous orb in vanilla, and somebody trading gold(or whatever is valuable) in BfA.
---
Yup. When it was an inevitable loss, I went fishing.
---
But this has nothing to do with countering a dwarf. You’re saying you counter a dwarf by CCing the dwarf after they leave your blind. Well great but that didn’t counter the dwarf. If he did that to you he could fully blind you and full sleep you
---
Now Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt?

I think hunters rolling on Dal'rend's created the most drama I've seen, personally.
---
Mejor, asi los entiendo
---
I have an entire folder of screenshots of glitches and bugs from my trial play-through. My favourite was calling in the Gnomish airstrikes against the troll village in Dun Morough. The gyrocopters didn't load so it was just T-posed gnomes flying around shooting missiles out of their junk. The trolls didn't seem bothered by it. I think the huts were supposed to be lit on fire by the missiles, but mostly the huts caught fire or extinguished themselves randomly. Of course, it's not like the fire actually did anything anyway.
---
Got what you deserved.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
I forgot how hard mana burn hit at 60. I bet improved inner fire and mana burn are huge in PvP!
---
But you get your choice of topping.
---
Eh, they’ll get at least rag and ony down but bwl and AQ will break guilds like this
---
Picking Ashenvale as your location of choice was probably the downfall there, it's basically a ghost town compared to certain other zones. Bodyguarding Horde in Stranglethorn Vale, especially around Nessingwary's Camp, would've probably been much more active.
---
There will be no world buffs allowed in my raids.  
---
How am I refusing to contribute?
---
Feral isn't s meme spec either?  
---
Wtf r u rambling about?
---
Love these! Do rogue next!
---
I just hope casual guilds wont have dkp system and more like roll on need
---
that wasn't me, but you assumed correctly. think i was around 30 when i figured it out. i'd spend a lot of time going out of my way to avoid em too. trying to stick to walking paths and such.
---
&gt; If anything, we learn that a homogeneous White Nation should best stay that way.
---
&gt; [Jews] are White for subversive purposes like promoting open borders, multiculturalism &amp; race mixing (for Whites), White priviledge and deconstructing White identity overall, then shapeshift back when it benefits them.
---
They weren't kicked out of 109 countries without reason
---
Your post history makes me quite happy to disagree with you.
---
Yes, you're proving my point. If you work in a city and live in the suburbs, you don't live close to work. If you work in a city and live a couple blocks away, you live close to work.
---
Roleplay is a niche playstyle. The purpose of the RP tag is so all those people who enjoy that playstyle know where to find other people who enjoy that playstyle. That way the RP community are together rather than spread across many servers so have a larger pool of player with the same interest to interact with.
---
Cant wait to yell 101 101 L t A A F at Alliance
---
Everyone's going to be rolling on that ring, even Rogues and Warriors.
---
It's crazy to me how many people on this sub have lives. Where are the real gamers working shit jobs and no responsibilities?
---
A Shaman without Nightfall is utterly useless. Even if you did get HoR you should never use in raids. HoR is just for pvp and solo play.
---
Yeah.  One of shaman's biggest weaknesses is that they have no root, stun, or CC.  War stomp is huge on shamans.
---
Orcs hardiness is good, but war stomp is amazing for shaman.
---
&gt; priviledge
---
Check your privilege.
---
^^^BEEP ^^^BOOP ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^to ^^^contact ^^^my ^^^author.
---
Windows Problem. Never happens on Linux.
---
What should it be in your eyes then? What is an enh shaman doing to prove dedication? They’re not doing the most dps, their utility is pretty good but why should they get it over a warrior if they’re just showing up
---
Glad to know i'm not alone, even after all this time :)
---
Yea its all about missexecution as you say rather than a flawed system.
---
If you quested as DPS you'd find your HP mattering a bit more. If you saw any other DPS leveling you probably saw them killing things faster. That's the trade off when you level as a tank. It's super hard to die, but if you're not doing quests where you can mass pull you're going slower than DPS. Although there are some optional group quests that you can solo as a tank that DPS can't do without a group. I've never leveled as a healer so I don't really know where that fits in these days.
---
You're definitely spot on that nothing really matters until end game. Even at end game capability of a particular class really only matters if you're pushing content above your gear level, like world first races or +20 mythic plusses. It's actually a thing I like about BFA. Since I never raid higher than heroic, I can play whatever class I want. In classic if I ever want to see the inside of Naxx there are some specs that I just am not allowed to play.
---
Any bracket will be awesome. Low level battlegrounds don't even exist on the private servers I played.
---
have you considered the actual poor use of tax money by various governments throughout history? such as the USA's big bank bailouts, the $400m broadband internet scandal, etc?
---
how does that make someone who legally minimizes their taxes a con-man?
---
&gt; Of course the fraudulent charity is an attempt to use deceit to take what doesn’t belong to you, and you could argue avoiding taxes is defending yourself against things being taken from you
---
We could also argue that since you are avoiding paying taxes which supports the society that means you should be barred of using infrastructure. Also being outside the society means you are an outlaw and people are free to take your possessions by force and if want to go further, kill you with no repercussions.
---
just the timbre of your question, like you need to have such elaborate loot rules in place, leads me to believe there is a need for such rules, which leads me to believe they can't be trusted with pointy objects. it's a sort of logic not uncommon among sentient beings.
---
In my personal experience, run as a DPS until level 90-100-ish and then switch to healer, learn your heals and then do RDF
---
Can confirm. Built a Hackintosh that works ^almost flawlessly.
---
This is incredibly ignorant and insular. I guarantee you plenty of people want regular rp servers.
---
Personally I plan to roll on an rp non pvp server. I work a full time job and losing my two hours of daily playtime to getting camped would just kill my day.
---
¿Qué es mejor?
---
But in that case are we talking about 40 naxx geared priests?
---
You don't need world buffs and min-maxing to kill raggy. Any group of jokers wielding vendor maces can defeat him. You won't be given a legendary weapon if you slack though.
---
That's how I remember it. If someone of the group really wanted it, they would whisper you during the run and you can make a fair price. Sometimes I even gave it away for free, because.. why not?
---
War Stomp is fun, but stun resist is more practical due to number of paladins and rogues. 
---
Stun resist is OP in classic.
---
If you want to level as resto/balance to be able to heal dungeons you can do it, just overall questing would be slower.  Feral druids are great tanks while leveling, and unlike other hybrids, don't need to spend mana for dps and can save it just for healing.  This gives ferals a smooth leveling experience and also the potential to solo really tough elite mobs.  As for healing, even as feral spec I would heal 5 man dungeons back in vanilla with my resto gear equipped and do just fine.  As was mentioned bringing in another hybrid into the group for their rez can be nice.
---
google on the error code, and you will find a windowpage with the fix for it.
---
Idk, I'm 25, never played fortnite, and this was pretty cringe
---
Idk I have a lot of fun playing ESO.
---
Dropped it earlier! Yell: COME ON DRUID, THROW THAT INNERVATE IN! Pfff have to do everything alone here...
---
Imagine that not everyone wants or enjoys world pvp, or rather just on his/her own terms by flagging for pvp.
---
Clearly you don't do rogue vs rogue duels. It's okay maybe you can practice when classic rolls around
---
Sperd runs
---
It always is lol
---
Ill support venezuela man, atleast for a couple hundred golds lol
---
You're right, and a PvP server is my first choice, however, I must compromise a bit in order to make my better half happy.
---
Being able to go into a major city without my computer lagging and crashing.
---
The hand of rag should go to whoever has the sulfron hammer in the bag already.
---
Are you an RP server player? Maybe I'm wrong but in my experience, a lot of players (if not most) joined an RP server because of no stupid names or friends and not to find an RP community.
---
interesting... rogue's less than warlock.
---
Wrong.  GoA is another reason they're there.  An enhancement shaman in a group with the mt could raise the threat ceiling for a lot of players.
---
Ohh and stop with the hunter nightfall Bullshit.  That will never happen.  No hunter will ever willing do that, and no guild should ask them to.
---
What the fuck
---
Priests are faster levelers and also have the only magic dispel on horde. Between that and the over population of shaman, guilds will fight to have you.
---
I can't believe this is so low...
---
I look over this article and see the threads and all that comes to mind is "You think you do but you don't". I'm glad we're proving him and all the people that thought this is just nostalgia wrong. Can't wait for this to come out.
---
Nah, Hunters rolling on Hand of Justice will trigger almost anyone, but most people know by now that the Dal'Rend's set is good for Hunters.
---
Its worse than that! Average time to 60 is 10 days played. If you play 20 hours a week it will take you three months. That's about three hours a day.
---
Looking forward to being a popstar on the server because I'm one of the few good healpallies. Like if this poll is representative it's gonna be so easy to find spots and gear.
---
Fair game for the pally. Especially if the pally healed.
---
Love the Shadow icon.
---
When I hit 60, i'll probably be swapping between arms / prot for PvP and dungeons and or raiding accordingly, thanks for your input
---
No you don't if your casting a spell you can turn as your cast bar goes, if your moving and casting instant casts just strafe cast spell and the turn during gcd.  There is never a reason to a or d turn there is plenty of time to turn during gcd and go back to healing which will be faster then a or d turning.
---
Why would the horde care if you ganked some alliance streamer? Fuck; there will be entire guilds and communities whose only purpose would be to kill these guys.
---
&gt;Between the DH (tank) and the Prot Paladin, I barely noticed any difference (bear in mind this is lvl 100-102): Both have interrupts, both have aoe buffs, both have movement abilities, both have defensive CDs. I'm sure at end-game the game play varies a lot between the two but - aside from one using a shield and other not - everything looks and feels the same.
---
I don't really even know how to respond to this. Yes both have interrupts like most classes in classic also had interrupts. Yes the *tank specs both had defensive CDs*, but outside of that extremely high-level view, they act completely differently.
---
Especially when the gpu dies.
---
Nah it's going to go smooth, we're going to have sharding and layering.
---
No, but by then you will have even more money.
---
Yeah honor gain isn't great at lower levels and PvP rank is capped based on your current level too. The highest rank achievable at 49 is R9, that's the hard cap. Honor from completing PvP objectives is 75% higher at 60 than at 49. Huge difference. And honor from HKs is lower at 49 too since the amount is based on the PvP rank of the player killed and reduced if you kill them multiple times per day. Which is more likely in the 49 bracket since it will be much smaller than at 60. Though with cross realm BGs there's no doubt it will have a healthy population for a long time.
---
There is plenty of rp on rp servers but it is usually confined within rp guilds or among people they have role played in the past with.If you failed to notice RP you were likely not seeking it out. You do not have to roll on a RP server but there are plenty of people who do .
---
Why?? Cause fuckem thats why...
---
Play 6 hours saturday, sunday. That only leaves an hour a day for the rest of the week to get 2,5h/day for a week. Weekends are mostly hobby days anyway, so im sure it could be called casual to play 12 hours per weekend. Or maybe my brains been scrambled by playing wow too long
---
Cwrath of the Lich King
---
Priests are super at leveling , see no reason why its not selected
---
Unless you are a tank and pushing content consumables are not needed. With the current knowledge and optimization we use now Vanilla raids are a joke.
---
PC is not what you call windows, or else WoW would have native Linux/FreeBSD support
---
Hey! Even though it's not popular I leveled as a healing priest to 60 in classic wow. I found disc for Mana regen and buffing to be the best way to be a good healing while still being able to solo on occasion.  The good part about preferring healer is it's rarely hard to find a group
---
If you want to raid then maybe your alt should be a dedicated healer. So when you inevitably get shittalked for not healing you can say "brb" and hop on your resto druid.
---
Yeah the guy who comes to the raid with extra consumables to carry the slackers who never bring their own is a very dedicated raider and imo worthy of a status symbol like Sulfuras or a ZG mount. 
---
Sulfuras in particular is very nice for enhancement PvP with the windfury procs and all. It is replaced in Naxx though but still good. I'd give it to any shaman/paladin who actually deserves it and will use it in PvP. Also that person needs to be able to even get the sulfuron hammer in the first place.
---
*graps popcorn*
---
Except it's not, it's a reboot. It could and might happen again in some way, and regardless of that, it's wrong to put a game above a real life friend. 
---
It would be different if this was about choosing between participating in an event with longtime in-game friends versus participating in something with irl friends, because it's a choice of people and then the medium by which you interact is a lot less relevant. But a few days of a game you can go back to later is not worth dismissing and likely to some extent hurting a person. They probably set time aside for you too, so you're not just gambling with your own time.
---
You do you. If you want to play a certain way just do it.
---
Enchanting so you can disenchant greens?
---
goes to phase 2/3
---
Or since we re all big bois now, dish out 100bucks for da gold
---
I couldn't even get my edgemasters to sell in vanilla. I'm pretty sure I vendored it or disenchanted it.
---
Ackshually shadow can be very strong raid spec. 
---
Granted gearing is harder as you're fighting Mages and Warlocks for non-set dps gear and you will need to learn to keep and eye on your mana between pulls, but it is absolutely a viable raid spec given a bit of practice.
---
Keep in mind that there is a chance that those people will
---
1. Stop playing their Shaman if they don't like it.
---
2. Might be mostly focusing on PVP with Enh/Ele.
---
3. Change their minds once the Game actually comes out.
---
There was always a demand for Shamans on P-servers so I don't see why it won't be the case here.
---
The news completely killed my OSRS progression. I'm just playing small, less investing games until the end of this month.
---
Found a fellow dude who will buy gold
---
Don't give the Horde any sort of respect. For the Alliance!
---
You can right click report people as AFK from the BG map in classic.
---
The most dps proves dedication?  Rofl. Maybe in a game that was half balanced, you could make this argument.   Vanilla wows balance is a clusterfuck though.  
---
Its shit for warriors.  Any warrior wanting hit is an idiot.
---
I was looking for this link. Great job.
---
Right my point I guess is that a large chunk of RP servers don't RP already.. So it's already not that much of a difference from RP guilds on regular servers.  
---
I guess not enough of a difference in my mind to justify seperate servers and have the population problems others here have voiced.
---
&gt; newest retail expansion
---
Aw piss really? So I can't have Legion with a subscription and play Classic?
---
I’m not, I’m just able to acknowledge that some people want to play the game differently than I do and have been asking for RP servers since Classic was announced.
---
Link plz cuz that’s retarded
---
Aye, which is a shame. :)
---
UK nerd here, feel free to shoot me a link, will be enjoying Horde PvP!
---
Shoes.
---
Right? Not sure what OP was expecting when contacting people who are getting their guild set a month ahead of time for the game that has been out for 15 years.
---
Lol..
---
Yes but the main Legion zone factions definitely have more than 3 WQs a day just the emissary box requires you do 3 or 4 from a given faction. Argus factions I think has a smaller pool of quests, but more than 3 if you have everything opened. Anyway yes they've definitely gone all out with time gating basically everything in retail is gated like that and I too would like some old fashioned faction grinds at whatever pace I choose. Good thing Classic comes out soon!
---
Humans and Orcs are the main villains. Each with their own unique way how to fuck everything and everyone over.
---
Night Elves are the arrogant, self-absorbed dipshits.
---
Gnomes are just children who are one lab mishap from ending themselves and probably everyone else.
---
Fucking Undead are literally conscious dead people stalking the living.
---
Dwarfs kill all of their firing neurons with alcohol.
---
Trolls are bunch weirdos, I don't know.
---
The *only* race than can be thought of as sort of good are Tauren. Everyone else is to a some degree an asshole.
---
Twitch has pulldown menu to choose retail or classic.
---
my rule is everyone rolls on that thing, its better than what 99% of folks will be using at that point no matter the class
---
Idk if I've ever seen a guild that didn't have legendary weapons on loot council rules.
---
"not clickbait" dropped
---
Well, shamans should swing nightfall if they're swinging anything at all. Their dps is shite anyhow
---
Idk, some friends would love that
---
It exists in retail too, everybody parroting that there is no class identity in retail just hasn't played. I've played every tank, a lot of DPS, and a few healing specs at max level and they all play differently. If you're pushing top end content or run into some snobs you'll also get ostracized for playing a "bad class" just like in classic. If you're doing some particular types of content they'll be looking for specific classes for abilities that only they have. It's all there, the only real homogenization is around things like having interupts, or doing similar amounts of DPS so that you're a viable class for a mid-tier raid.
---
Yeah, in pve dual wielding is better. Sulfuras should be a pvp weapon for a shaman or paladin as well. Giving it to a shaman adds what, 50-100 dps at the cost of a debuff slot? I don’t see the benefit to the guild there either.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Omg, I don't know how I'll survive.
---
It will be so much better. It takes a little more time to get going because you have to fill up a group/raid with others (as opposed to pressing the queue button and having blizzard do it for you), but once you get going it's a blast.
---
Then you have no strength of spirit. 
---
Begone from this place, milk drinker.
---
It's more important for Orcs because their PvP trinket doesn't break stuns.
---
R u kidding?  You would have to be an idiot to craft that hammer on the off chance the eye dropped.
---
So it's balanced in classic and I can raid in your server first guild as moonkin? Sweet, thanks for the invite.
---
Engineering is the best profession out there because it literally adds like 3-4 key abilities to you. Also as a warlock you need to tank the twins and using shadow deflectors is very nice there.
---
 I agree, its great for every class.
---
I'm a Brazilian guy and felt that I needed to say this, Alanzoka is a nice guy and one of the few streamers/youtubers in Brazil that ~~don't~~ doesn't make scandals and isn't polemic~~, his~~. His fanbase is really toxic though. That being said, if he plays at ~~the~~ launch or near it, AVOID the server he's playing, not because of him, but because almost everyone who follows him will stop playing after he leaves, and he'll eventually leave, that's for sure.
---
Your last sentence is a run on sentence, I'm not 100% how to fix it, but I made some edits above. That's what sounds right to me at least? I'm not that great at grammar to be honest, heh.
---
Thanks for the info on Alanzoka! I have him on the list currently. I know he has a large following and a large population shift is sure to follow.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yep, mostly quest ones
---
Crusade of the Burning
---
For me family guy is perfect background. I’ve seen most the episodes, they aren’t complicated so you don’t need to pay attention, and each episode follows its own story.
---
Your username and your profile description both suggest you just like disagreeing with people. It’s called devils advocate. So you win, Dwarves can be countered by being opened first, using extra items on them, then hoping they have no break, and if they do have a break that they are too slow to blind you after they use it. Yes that counters a dwarf. I need to go practice my dwarf skills against a rogue I guess
---
If it's an upgrade over what you have, roll. 
---
It's a 45% drop which will be replaced soon anyway.
---
This is Awesome! I'm looking forward to Classic, I Never got really deep into it back in the day but now I'm eager for WoW to get back to it's roots, I began playing back in BC.
---
I like the Burning Blade quests, because they lead you to the top of that one mountain in the barrens which is also the location of one druid class quest.
---
i will play shadow priest, my opinion and the maths is its not worth to create a farm char or twink. even respec make more sense intead of twinking. 
---
i beginn with skinning and later i look which epic receipe i can get and choose second profession.
---
We had such high hopes for Aion, Rift, Guild Wars 2, and expecially Age of Conan! God what a fucking disappointment that game turned out to be. So much potential squandered.
---
After those, idk what happened because I quit at the beginning of Wrath to go to college.
---
?? he lost his job. didn’t get a new one yet.
---
Yup.
---
Dude, you know this is already happening on retail right?  There's literally no difference between the two situations.  It's going to be totally fine.
---
Ok, so lets waste it something useless?
---
Also...
---
-Enchats can be expensive
---
-Boosting reps for crafters is expensive 
---
-Thunderfury is expensive
---
But hey, lets dump our resources into HoR, so the guy playing meme spec can stroke his ego...
---
Yikes you're such a toxic elitist that you're shitting in people for not being casual the right way
---
I'm not sure why anyone's surprised by this and/or thinks anythings going to be done about it.
---
Going from 15% to 30% nets the same amount of mp5 as going from 0% to 15%.
---
Your comments somehow makes it sound like as long as you have the talent or 3/3 T2 it does not matter if you have both.
---
Her name is “Mom” actually.
---
It should only go to someone that has the capability of finishing it. Meaning either they have the gold supply or the means to farm the mats/gold required to create it. We had an eye drop and none of the warriors wanted and none of the paladins wanted it, because its so expensive. But I had the gold and means to create it, as a druid. 
---
Tldr; it went to the GMs best friend who was a holy paladin(which sat at the bottom of the meters also) and it never got created. Give it to someone that will make it.
---
I coulda been out there memeing in WSG as a druid wielding HoR!
---
Wow you even give zg mounts to ass kissers?
---
You can joke, but your point is still wrong
---
Everyone brings up how retail is more enjoyable for casuals. Since you fall into the category, could you explain it for me?
---
From my point of view, retail would be absolutely terrible for casual enjoyment. It encourages frequent, if not daily, logins that wouldn't be the schedule of most people described as casual, and the more engaging parts of the game are more difficult to get into or time consuming, like mythic+ or raids. 
---
On the other hand, Classic can be typically progressed at one's own pace, as leveling and gold gathering are significant components of progress. At later levels, gear earned from each step up the ladder stays relevant, as patches do not add much in the way of catchups that negate slow progress. As the game wasn't mostly designed around getting to max level and doing some grinds before anything else, engaging content can be found at most points in the journey.
---
You could argue that, lol.
---
To be clear, I’m not an anarcho-capitalist lol.
---
But when far left socialists are arguing for ridiculously high taxes for political agendas someone finds repulsive, or to redistribute wealth, etc., and someone wanted to try to evade taxes where they could because they didn’t think they should have to be compromising on paying for good health care or educations for their children or even a luxury like a vacation once a year, I don’t think that is equatable to someone purposefully setting up a deceitful “charity” to steal funds meant for kids with cancer or something, lol.
---
You can think avoiding taxes is wrong, but come on, those 2 transgressions are not equatable.
---
We're a hardcore guild and our schedule isn't even that strict! Well except the MC clear in one month but it really is much easier than you may think.
---
So the tooltip is a lie?!
---
Nobody does this outside of the most tryhard of tryhards.
---
Yup, my vanilla guild raided 3-4 nights per week 3+ hours per raid and we never got C'thun or past the first 5/6 easier Naxx bosses.
---
Now I will be able to be clear all the content in 3 hours per week, another night for ZG/AQ20 as needed, and thats it.
---
You 2 people get it!
---
HANDLE IT!!
---
Thanks!  I think I will make it a post.
---
this is dope thank you. I can use this as a framework for other macros too.
---
Assuming I was a rogue in that instance, I would probably roll for it because it would be an upgrade, however yes a Pally should roll for it too. (I think most classes would find it an upgrade).
---
15$/month = 2 pizzas. If you have a hard time coming up with 15$/month, you should consider how you plan your economy. Seems way too tight for comfort.
---
Yeah most younger people I know think the graphics look lame and that it's a slow game. I don't imagine the fortnite kids are excited for wow classic.
---
Great question. Depending on professions you have, you can make some but most are bought from other players or in some cases consumables are dropped off of specific mobs.
---
Guild was working on learning Rag. I was playing a hunter and we were already several wipes in. I had him targeted waiting for everyone to get ready and in position. When to get up from my desk and foot got caught causing me to hit some keys on my keyboard unintentionally starting the encounter and falling into the lava. At the time it sucked but now I find it quite funny.
---
Nice. I had a similar 39 fire mage back in retail vanilla/BC/LK. Casters can really go full glass cannon with the pure +dmg gear. I tweaked my spell damage so that my scorch would have a good chance of critting for 666 which always amused me.
---
Lol how righteous of you. So would you agree that RP servers could have population issues a month or two after launch?
---
Where are you from if I might ask? :)
---
What point?
---
Ooo I like this, yea desert theme will be the hardest yet. I'll have to fit a gerudo valley cover in there
---
You would be kinda jerk to roll on that as rogue/warrior with intellect user in your group
---
...and swing nightfall/annihilator. 
---
That'll be my angle in classic.
---
Nah dude I twink at max level
---
Oh I must have been levelling a pala alt in wrath through Outland and forgot
---
Come get the woodo - troll berserking to manaburns then healyourself
---
Enchants and consumables should largely be farmed by the individual raiders.
---
Talk to the spains in the classic wow guild discord and figure out what server they're gonna roll on. Most people from Spain are probably raiding on similar raid times.
---
Why would it go to a shaman whose bis is nightfall?
---
No, I don’t agree. Based on demand I think a server would be able to have a decent sustained population
---
For a class that (in theory) can play all 3 roles it's pretty low.
---
So an intellect user would be kind of a jerk to roll on it with an agility user in the group?
---
At that level, there are no better choices. It would get used by every single class.
---
Gotta go to a lake house all weekend...
---
Sad leveling noises
---
Oh ya that thing that happens to everyone commonly
---
Yeah it is possible to be both. I'll min-max my own character but I don't expect everyone in the guild to do the same and I have no qualms with that. You won't get the same amount of loot but they don't expect that either so it's fine.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
I don’t know where you are getting these numbers from, because if you are basing it off private servers priests and pallies are very close in Healing. 
---
And even if priests are better in any length fight the extras pallies bring are the most important alliance mechanic. Therefore they are the better choice for EVERY situation. I’d take a raid with 1 priest 1 Druid and the rest pallies any day.
---
There will be a lot more abilities lol
---
Those dastardly Venezuelans are gonna be camping gromsblood and dreamfoil and silversage node spawns and they will control the herb market so they can eat shredded wheat for breakfast but it will be fun to compete with.
---
Of course I know that people want a regular RP server.  And ideally, we'd have both options.
---
Way to insult me even though I agree with you.
---
Dude, if you're in a guild with so much disposable income that it can afford to craft useless items worth thousands of gold, then you can give it to a hunter for all I care.
---
But most guilds will be trying to put it's resources towards helping their members progress through raids.
---
HoR doesn't help with raid progress.
---
Interesting take. Not sure I agree but thought provoking for sure.
---
And in WSG we'll have premades graveyard campings pugs while sprinting for the finish, ad infinitum.
---
That's the best part about only having world PvP and the worst part about BGs - it used to be about having fun, not PvE-style grinding for the rewards.
---
Two Handers in PvE are great for AoE. In AoE scenarios - which includes most bosses - you don’t have everything at 0 armor.
---
For the most part yes, and especially regarding class abilities, but flying and 25 man raids did plenty to downsize the epic scope of the world and raids. Definitely agree on the whole new continent every expansion not being necessary.
---
RP-PvP is more niche than RP, so it could well be that if it is created there would be population issues. However, that doesn't mean straight RP servers would experience the same.
---
It was exactly like twitch chat back then mate we just called it barrens chat
---
This is not really different in classic.
---
Yes well private servers are a little different. On live no one went around crafting the Sulfuron Hammer hoping they would get the Eye.. that would be insane.
---
idk why you are complaining.
---
I've been looking for a guild that actually puts time in without raiding more than 2 days per week and every guild I find is "We'll get to 60 in the first 3 months". If you can't find a guild that is casual you are just bad at looking.
---
I mean, I think you are mostly correct, but there is nothing forcing you to play for raids. There are literally thousands of people who are signing up for Classic with no intent to do raiding beyond maybe some casual MC here and there.
---
Even at max level nothing matters. You'll still get your 6 consecutive pair of pants from the weekly chest, and some noob who just hit max level will Titanforge gear better than you, and therefore replace you in a raid.
---
Just how far multi-boxing has come.
---
Can easily afk aoe steam roll all 5 mans with 3 locks 2 x priests - this will be source of gold.
---
Hopefully /follow isn't disable in BGs. I'll be 5, potentially 10 manning elemental shaman turrets in AV.
---
They don't have to be bad, plenty of good players can no doubt see the appeal in it, but it does attract the less serious pvpers for the above reasons aye.
---
It's the best choke point. It'll be interesting to see if they fix the backdoor in av
---
No need to question my sanity! Casuals ("semi-hc") usually dump a lot more time into farming because of wipes so going the HC route usually saves time in the long run. Also if I went the casual route a lot more would be asked of me, I would rather be a foot solider for a well oiled machine especially after 3 years of the casual 'i have to try hard to keep everyone alive' mode
---
The original definition of casual was "inconsistent login pattern". So even your proposed schedule is definitely hardcore for the overall context of gaming.
---
Dragon's Ring of the Zodiac. They are vastly different in Diablo 1 though. In Diablo 1, maxing out your resistance to 75% was extremely important. The best way to do that was with two "Obsidian ring of the Zodiac". Obsidian was part of the tri-elemental resistance prefix set, and the highest rank that could be gotten on a ring or amulet. Each one gave 31-40% resist to all elements. With two that had at least 38 resist, you could cap your characters resistance. The "Zodiac" suffix was +16-20 to all stats. Definitely the most useful suffix for a ring or amulet slot. "Dragons" meant +51-60 mana - a nice bonus for any character, as all classes used magic to some extent end game (warriors even used it to teleport next to enemies that would constantly flee and attack them with melee to "stunlock" them to death). I was really into legit play and dueling on Diablo 1. It took months of grinding at the top tier to get an OROTZ or DROTZ. If you're ever interested, there's an amazing guide / compendium of knowledge created by a Diablo 1 player named "Jarulf" who extracted a lot of the data from the game (data mining before data mining was a commonly known thing) and wrote an extremely well formatted and extensive guide. That can be found here: http://www.lurkerlounge.com/diablo/jarulf/jarulf162.pdf
---
If there's one thing a bunch of people stoked for a 15 year old game can do, it's keep up with trends.
---
Those are all things that resto shamans do. If your enh shaman is there to provide buffs he’d have nightfall
---
I had no idea it was 2004 and that we weren’t about to play with a shirt on of Uber geeks, tyvm for informing me about the time portal 😂
---
When people say BiS it usually means there is no upgrade. You are competing with ignite in later tiers.
---
Lots of people have been playing private servers and know the game inside and out. Getting the endgame raid gear is what makes them hoarney I suppose
---
Part of the experience, i wouldn't want to miss the launch even if i knew for a certainty that there would be issues.
---
He is not retarded (you can check his IRL channel to have better perspective).
---
He is passionated about wow (he even explains on a deeper level why, spoilers it has to deal with equality of opportunity). He plays (albeit with some connection to his reality) the neckbeard elitist.   
---
He also makes a lot of events which his fans seem to adore. (like mog competitions and shit). He is a good entertainer that is all.
---
Bet those chicks had a fun time ;}
---
well game time prolly would cost like 1k+ gold in vanilla currency... how would you not just get scammed....
---
The problem is that the game has gone largely from "you do the right thing or you die" to "you do the right thing or you're less efficient." 
---
If you mess up kiting and the mob gets to you as a mage or hunter, you're in trouble.  If you don't play right as a warrior, you're in trouble.  If you don't keep that mob sheeped, or waste your stun, you're in trouble.
---
But in retail, all that happens is you kill something slower.
---
fOr StrEamErs oNly! Lol
---
Wow so mean he criticized someone mog xDD
---
August 27th is release data, yes. The Blue Post is talking about the ability to create up to 3 characters (but not login) in order to "reserve" your desired character name(s) on the 12th/13th (3pm PDT on the 12th).
---
Literally google or search this sub to find dozens of answers.
---
You download the blizzard client, activate a sub, download classic WoW. It releases on the 27th.
---
And writing your own bot for personal use is financially insane anyhow.
---
I envisioned this after the first blue posts regarding TBC... eviscerate the uniqueness of both factions (paladin/shaman), increase level caps and obsolete end game raid loot... flying mounts. It was way worse and way quicker than I thought.
---
I kill bears in the wilderness of ashenvale and hillsbrad where no man goes. Unlimited mobs all for me
---
Use moonfire to try and tag mobs for my leveling group.
---
 Best way is going to be doing a lot of instances to make use of your healing capability. Also since you are not going shadow a good wand will be even more important for you when you are solo leveling.
---
 So I would check out all available wands [https://classicdb.ch/?items=2.19#0+2+1](https://classicdb.ch/?items=2.19#0+2+1) and plan out your leveling with upgrading your wand as number one priority. If you are mainly grinding instances though it will of course be less crucial.
---
 One advantage you have as a healer is that you can run instances that are way above your level. So for example it's possible for you to get this  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=7001](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7001) at level 18. Getting that wand at level 18 will make you incredibly powerful when soloing all the way up to level 30 even if not shadow.
---
This is where a third party guild could come in. Also people don't seem to scam people that often. How many times do people just take your enchanting mats and run off? It would depend on what blizzard says about these transaction, and whether or not you can report them, without reporting urself.
---
What. You don't, im just curious.
---
Your alma mater? Is that some sort of sports club saying?
---
I decided to sub again as well, except I do have BFA (which admittedly I had played quite a bit at launch and through the first raid tier). I played some of 8.2, then got bored. I then decided to level an old DK I had sitting there that I hadn't touched since cata. Got him to 100 today through only doing bonus quests, legion invastions, and dungeon grinding (blood dk so I could tank). There were times where I didn't mind the leveling, but the biggest thing that bothers me is that once I get to 120 I know exactly what it's going to be like.
---
**&lt;DPRA&gt; Alliance | NA PvP | EST | Casual**
---
**Intro**:
---
Welcome to the DPRA! We praise our Beloved Leaders and fight for the the Party above all!
---
We are a new guild created for Classic with simple goals. The guild founders have full time jobs and lives outside of the game so we structure things around that lifestyle, but all are welcome. We want to foster a community of chill people, and we want to help all our members achieve their goals within the game.
---
We are accepting pre-release members who want to raid, PvP, or just have a community to level / run dungeons with. We expect to do most recruitment after release.
---
**Raiding**:
---
Thursday, Sunday starting 8:30pm EST
---
We have somewhat casual raiding requirements, but a focused approach. We **accept raiders of any spec**, and we **do not require consumables farming or world buffs** for raids. We will begin raiding ~2 months after release so our members can have a more relaxed leveling experience.
---
Despite our non-hardcore requirements, we want to clear all content and be able to eventually farm the earlier raids. Prior raiding experience is not required, but adaptability and teamwork are key. We will be a tight knit team and feel the rewards of overcoming challenges!
---
For loot we use a custom SK+LC system.
---
**PvP**:
---
For us full time employed peoples, the grind towards R14 is probably out of the question. However, we still plan to have a dedicated PvP team. This group will strive to become a notorious pre-made BG team on the server with a solid win rate.
---
*If you think yourself a skilled PvPer, want a regular PvP group, yet don't have the time to go for high rank grinds, then this is the place for you!*
---
**Party Benefits**:
---
- Daily bread!
---
- Youth Development Program!
---
- Free Speech Commune!
---
*If you have dissenting opinions then our People's Counsel officers want to hear from YOU!*
---
**To Join**:
---
Please check out our Discord (https://discord.gg/5Ckj2DB) for more info! **Glory to the DPRA!**
---
-----
---
**not an RP guild; just having fun with our theme* :wink:
---
We will see what happens when they announce.  I think a few people misunderstood me here I honestly would love to play on RPPvP and am echoing the concerns I've heard on this sub on population.
---
I'm still hoping we'll be surprised and get an rppvp server. RP adds an interesting layer to the game just as much as pvp does. I want the full experience.
---
Private server players are the tryest of the hards bro. They will make up like 2% of classic wow's playerbase. Maybe.
---
Fine you want to make this simple?  Lets blow up your one single argument.  You think leveling as holy pre 40 is the best and shadow pre 40 is terrible.
---
But, you already stated that holy priests already take the hit talents and the SWP talents while they are leveling.
---
So lets do this...
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZZxMx
---
Here is what you said the holy priest takes up to level 26.  Now tell me talent point for talent point, how putting the remaining 14 talents in holy makes it a quicker leveling experience than shadow.
---
GO!
---
Don't kink shame me!
---
good point from both of you. Recently rolled a druid on a pserver and open world/equally geared opponents were extremely easy to kill while I was a non twink. The second I start playing in bgs I get destroyed. It's so gear dependent and people have dropped a thousand gold on a twink...
---
This is why I believe wPvP will be extremely fun. It all comes down to skill as you are most likely both similarly geared.
---
Everything is known, you can do a lot more early planning.
---
The only cringeworthy part to me is people actually taking it seriously enough to think it is cringy.
---
It's more frustrating than fun, same reason I avoid going to huge movies opening weekend. The theater is packed and I can barely hear the movie over people laughing/cheering/gasping
---
Probably over heated, pour some water on it.
---
RPG carrying a level 30 green in your bags because of the rare on use effect that's useful even at 60
---
Agreed, PvE was and should be more than raids, even more than dungeons. It's like they're already fixated on possibly more raids or more expansions after Naxx.
---
They could instead choose to move more towards open world dungeons and stuff like that. Nothing forces them to once again choose the raid road, but it's that they don't see any other option even though all options are available. 
---
In OldSchool RuneScape a similar thing happened. They could have moved from 2007 towards 2001, to become more classic-like, but instead they chose the predictable move from 2007 towards 2010 for the OSRS. In WoW they could move from 2006 era towards 2004, but now once again they fixated on the one path... the one we already took...
---
&gt;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
---
&gt;And sorry I could not travel both  
---
&gt;And be one traveler, long I stood  
---
&gt;And looked down one as far as I could  
---
&gt;To where it bent in the undergrowth;  
---
&gt;Then took the other, as just as fair,  
---
&gt;And having perhaps the better claim,  
---
&gt;Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
---
&gt;Though as for that the passing there  
---
&gt;Had worn them really about the same,  
---
&gt;And both that morning equally lay  
---
&gt;In leaves no step had trodden black.  
---
&gt;Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
---
&gt;Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
---
&gt;I doubted if I should ever come back.  
---
&gt;I shall be telling this with a sigh  
---
&gt;Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
---
&gt;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—  
---
&gt;I took the one less traveled by,  
---
&gt;And that has made all the difference.
---
I haven't found a gerudo valley cover that I thought really fit my playlist :\
---
You might like this one too though - it's a little faster and is on my 'desert+night' list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz29ToCtd1U
---
I really prefer weeknight raids with 1 weekend night at most if that.
---
Thank you though.
---
Pretty much. Sulfuras is trash. If a guildie wants to blow 3-5k of their OWN gold on it, I could care less. But we're not supplying mats.
---
I agree. I think Classic might possibly even have a higher sub count than retail.
---
Please note that most people replying here are discussing RP servers, which have been confirmed, rather than RP-PvP servers.
---
Why are you painting this as an unpopular opinion? 95% of this sub is talking about how launch week craziness is the best time to play.
---
Yeah you get em to 35 for profs then twink them later
---
An alt can be useful for a cool down profession, just hit 35 and do it on CD.
---
I'll be doing an alch probably on a hunter for arcanite
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t there no level requirement for profs in classic? Enchanting alts to de would be the way to go, if i for that right!
---
You're mistaken. Curses can only be removed by mages and druids. Impending Doom is not a curse, it's a magic effect which can only be removed by priests and paladins.
---
If you decide not to go with weekend nights let me know.
---
Cheers
---
Side note: do you think going on an RP server will help with avoiding streamers?
---
Just say that you're roleplaying as a shaman will Mana Tide PTSD.
---
No. They were in vanilla, they will be in classic.
---
I can see that. I treat it more as a giant game lobby that I can queue for whatever I want to do. Or if I'm feeling nostalgic, I'll just run some old bc or wotlk raids for the hell of it.

There's no excuse, because none of needed.

There's a reason, and that reason is maybe they want to explore the game, and not just rush it.

Anyway it shouldn't be a problem for you, you're an elitist little shit, and you'll be ahead of the curve alongside the other no-lifers. Don't worry so much, and at least *try* to have fun.

---
ABOUT US
---
Looking for a casual raiding guild that'll still progress, are adults, aren't up their own asses and just want to make new memories in classic with you? 
---
We're a casual oriented friend/family guild that will be rolling on an alliance PVE realm. We're a raiding guild first and foremost but still plan to dabble in PvP for sure. The guild was made with adults in mind. So those that have jobs, families and a life outside of wow yet know how to bring it during the weekend and raid nights is exactly the type of person I made this guild for. Casual yet competent.
---
GOALS
---
We're NOT in a rush to hit max level. Of course raiding is in our sights and I expect us to get going around Dec / Jan or so. However, I want you to take your time. Smell the roses etc. Once we’re all hitting max level and have some early dungeon gear we WILL be raiding and taking it fairly seriously.
---
RAID SCHEDULE (Central Standard Time) 
---
We're thinking weekends in the evening once MC gets underway. 2 nights a week (Fri Sat or Sat Sun) with a much more casual mid week raid night that’ll be ZG / AQ 20 etc. 
---
LOOT
---
DKP and Loot Council with a stronger emphasis on DKP. There’s rare exceptions we might allow someone to get an advance on their DKP (tanks healers) for the sake of progression. For the most part things are going to be as fair as possible. This is a promise to anyone that joins. 
---
EXPECTATIONS
---
Please check out the guild website for expectations / rules and policies etc.
---
For more info please checkout our website https://guild.competentcasuals.com
---
Link to Discord can be found on the site. Please look over the rules first.
---

Most: Upgrades. I have a good PC, large High spec monitor, better sound etc etc. The perks of not being a broke teenager.
---
Least: Not having as much time.

Great bracket for sure. Personally was a bigger fan of 39 but I will certainly end up in one of these brackets 100%

You’re being quite presumptuous lol.
---
When people speak of the “highest contributor”, it’s usually in reference to the guild. If someone comes overly prepared to help everyone else, they aren’t being ass kissers. They are helping toward the success of the guild.
---
Otherwise you get into a slippery slope of calling anyone that isn’t outright selfish an ass kisser.
---
“You helped a a guildmate finish their warlock mount quests? Fucking brown noser”
---
Makes no sense.
---
That's their fault for expecting something that's been explicitly stated won't be in the game for 6 months.
---
No. They made wow the best pve mmorpg thats ever been. Couldn't ve more wrong
---
 It's hard to say. I have tried leveling up herbalism on a fresh private server and was a mistake. Because of the crazy amount of players packed together it was super hard to keep herbalism up to date. Outleveled areas and had herbalism lagging behind, had to stay behind and do herb runs. Was horrible. 
---
 Because of layering though what to expect from fresh classic is anyones guess. I mean if the add tons of layers I could see it not being that hard. I'm going to try it and If it seems impossible like on private I will just skip it. 
---
 Can add that another problem with gathering professions on a fresh server is bag space. Be prepared to delete items. Going to take a long while before you have gotten a decently sized inventory.
---
There is no reliable data for this. In retail PvP doesn exist anymore and even before BfA the difference didn't really matter. During original Vanilla, RpPvP was only released a year into the game, so naturally there would be more players on RpPvE servers.
---
Honest question, how does stuff pre-60 ultimately matter in classic? I truly think you're letting nostalgia blind you on this aspect.
---
I'm pumped for classic but let's not pretend 1-59 truly matter.
---
He’s name isn’t shithead, he *is* a shithead.
---
You honestly think you’d be better off with an enhancement shaman totem twisting over a resto shaman because mana?? The enhancement shaman wears agi/strength while the resto shaman stacks mp/5 and int. 
---
Your argument just doesn’t make sense. A resto shaman is way better at totem twisting and doesn’t immediately go oom. The only difference is that an enh shaman auto attacks the boss while the resto shaman actually provides significant amounts of healing.
---
If the shaman is just standing there auto attacking the boss for damage he’s might as well be using nightfall. There would only be a ~20 dps difference since he can’t actually use any abilities to deal damage.
---
Yes, it will always be a 3rd party hack/addon/macro to get WoW working in VR. Blizzard has no reason to even look into it.
---
Ok, but "because we said so" isn't a good *reason* to do something.
---
Great Idea - Create a discord possibly?

---
Yeah. Until I know how likely I am to get found out I'm not doing that though.
---
It might be legal to trade wow gold for classic gold, like in OSRS, in which case I can shell out for wow tokens.
---
Farming 10 different consumables fun?
---
People who want RPPVP outnumber those who just want RP. /u/rhayadergoestotown was trying to explain that IF the only reason why we don't have RPPVP is GM resources, then Blizzard should just cut the RP realm. He's not saying we shouldn't have both.
---
It wouldnt be too difficult to make basic bot. Its not gonna be doing overly complex shit, but with a little effort could easily make a mara bot that does princess runs.
---
That's what happens when classes get homogenized to this degree.
---
When everyone can do everything, nobody is special anymore and every class feels the same.
---
It’s all contextual.
---
If you are in a big guild they might already have backups; you could be one of those. Most casual guilds will have a difficult time filling a 40-man raid initially, though.
---
As for loot if you are the only druid in the raid and 4 T1 pieces drop you are one lucky SOB since most guilds can/will accept negative DKP for these situations.
---
At the same time some might flat out refuse to give you 4 epics if you’re new and disenchant some of them. It really depends what the leadership has in mind and how well you’re rooted in the guild.
---
Vanilla is centered around the community. If you find a cool one and do your best to be nice, everything is possible.
---
Except balance druid.
---
Corrupted ashbringer should be a good start
---
Ah, pay the Chinese to work for you, brilliant.
---
&gt; My main gripe - Nothing you do pre-max level matters.
---
This is actually astonishingly good point! I started to wonder that instead of static sliders for repuration etc. it would be better to include effects through time spent ingame. I mean instead of reputation it should be calculated that character did things abc, so in the week's end he/she receives certain static changes to his character. I'm thinking like having an actual character with history instead of excel spreadsheet with stats I'm improving through grinding.
---
Least excited about: having a life outside of WoW. Back in the day I could dedicate a lot of time to it and it showed, I was able to practice, gear up, play around on alts and the game became a part of me. I still plan to play as much as I can but it'll be a fraction of what I used to be able to, and I feel my game play is going to reflect that. Granted, this is not inherently a bad thing, I love my life outside of video games, the people I hang out with and the things I do, but in relation to WoW it's a bit of a weird relationship. 
---
Most excited about: meeting a group of 40+ other people who I can hang out with every night and shoot the breeze and become part of my life. My favorite part of WoW back in the day wasn't pvping or dungeons or the game itself, but rather raiding with a bunch of people I developed a genuine connection with, cracking jokes and goofing off in general, that's what I'm most excited about.
---
I’ll look into that, thanks!  Yes I’m all horde and always have been and always will.
---
It is going to be fine, because bliz took the precaution of reserving the names for these people.
---
Can't freeze ur exp in vanilla
---
You're not alone.  Pushing the entire PvE endgame into raids is a mistake imo.  I'd like dungeons  and elite world areas to remain relevant regardless of what they do with raid itemization - which definitely gets too much power creep / stat optimization the farther along you get in vanilla.  Many of the problems we see in later expansions have already started by 1.12.
---
Spoke to my boss about me having a week off. He approved. Pic related
---
No one wanted it, the guilds not paying for it to be made, because that would be a huge waste of time and money better spent elsewhere. Not a single paladin or warrior wanted it. Druid can equip it, and had more than enough funds to craft it, so why not give it to someone that will complete it? Otherwise it's wasted like in the above example. Better to go to a druid that will use it, for w.e purpose, than to some paladin that did bare minimums and will never complete it.
---
This shouldn't even be an issue of contention.
---
And to think, this is the weekend my guild foolishly decided to do our first ever meetup ha ha
---
Classic doesn't have EXP freezing nor do BGs give you EXP.
---
Well said, upvoted. While I'm not an active roleplayer, I'll definitely roll on a RP-PVP server if one is available, because it seems like the best bet to spend my time playing with motivated, mature individuals who want to enjoy the game, as opposed to griefer kids and streamers.
---
And a side note, u don't receive exp in battleground either.
---
I’m curious, would a PI priest be able to significantly increase ignites dps by PI’ing the mage when they hit with their fire spell? 
---
Imagine that could add up to a lot of damage throughout a fight.
---
You can only send BOE items to your low level alts for disenchanting. So if you really set on going with enchanting and possibly want to make the most of it, you'd need it on you main character, because you'll get a lot of BOP green and blue items from questing and doing dungeons that you won't be able to mail to your enchanting alt.
---
But luckily for twinks, bg’s don’t provide any xp
---
Drink more water for the next while. You will want to stay well hydrated during the marathon, but a drastic change will be bad. Build it up now.
---
If you are going with coffee or some other energy drink you will get dehydrated, and sleep worse. Bad sleep will slow you down more than more bios. You can piss on flights, you cant nap during them.
---
Stay away from bad foods, have very easy to digest food. Grilled chicken or Turkey is great, also vegetable medleys. Easy to prepare and eat as you go. If its like a bunch of brocolli corn and peas in a tuberware container and munch as you quest or travel. 
---
Get a water bottle for cold water. 1L would be a good size, and keep it ready. Often times thirst can be confused with hunger by our body, and over eating can further dehydrate you. It will make ya groggy and slow you down more. 
---
Keep an eye on other people you have seen regularly. If you are racing for first great be above them. If you are just trying to be top like 5% it will be easier for leveling purposes to know your bracket and communicate. Not only are they good guild prospects but when and if you choose a dungeon to run you will waste less time waiting for one.
---
This. So much. Play the game man! It makes the game that much more exciting. Especially when you find stuff you've never seen before and learn the abilities! Read your abilities, learn how to use them with one another, figure out the quests....ENJOY THE CONTENT!!! :D
---
You might want to post location, I assume the US?
---
What're you hating on the oomkin for?
---
I am in the minority here, yes. I don't think I would be the minority of players though.
---
Not like the servers will be even alive on the first weekend
---
u/jefframclassic
---
Omar Gonzalez: There's some differences and similarities. We will likely set up a war room - like NASA Mission Control - where we have all hands on deck. On one hand, it's a little bit simpler, because what players will be doing is more known. But on the other hand, it's much more complicated because we've built out, effectively, a whole new infrastructure. That's something we typically don't do for an expansion. An expansion launch is much more of a software upgrade. Our Classic [launch] will include hardware deploys in all of the various regions - something we haven't done in almost 15 years.
---
And what would your abysmally awful solution actually *fix*? Why would Blizzard bother doing something like this?
---
Or are you just shitposting because you're bored?
---
i would do it like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxMTscMdLxxfoso) 
---
has the downside of not having furor, which is basically a pvp talent anyways. you just need it to switch bear and feral charge or bash immediately. you should be careful with using enrage tho since it lowers your armor.
---
If I played a paladin and that dropped I would need if I were the healer, greed otherwise.
---
&gt;I have not the capability, nor the inclination, to hide. I cannot strike from stealth with devastating blows, then fade into the darkness.
---
I am the night elf warrior. For real, I'm looking forward to shadowmeld-&gt;charge.
---
Be human, use perception, use sprint to ensure you get the opener... proceed to win since you now have the upper hand. It feels wrong its so cheap.
---
I bet you could do that in retail, if you can do it in vanilla its almost guaranteed you can do it in retail.
---
All you have to know about retail vs vanilla with ease of lvling is that in retail you legit dont even need to look at your mana bar... its not even close to comparable man
---
If no location is specified it's the US, rule 42 of the internet
---
Idk, I remember when back in tbc my brother gave his arena 2000 rated team to someone so he can inv and that guy instead kicked him and stole it... Guess what GM said... That he should pick his friends and who to trust better... I think that's their official stance towards scammers and ninjas...
---
They ask where to buy their mount at level 20.
---
I had a sulfron hammer in vanilla and never got an eye. (On my paladin) so you know I was a trash player and 18.
---
A lot of people who played classic never even got to do a lot of the raiding or certain world events, I was busy doing pve/pvp and hanging out with buddies to even think about worrying about raiding. 
---
This time around it's a bunch of content I (and others) want to experience so they are setting it as their goal.
---
I've been playing around on making some characters on a friends server.  I still do not have an active sub so i am limited to L20 and i can't grab any of the good hierloom items from my other characters to add them to my collections.  
---
I tried out a panda monk to see what the starting area was like and experience the the lore.  It was okay, but i didn't ever feel like i was in danger and the hand holding was insane.  He's currently level 17 with 2 dungeon finder runs done.  I've died 0 times and i still havent plugged in my mouse on my laptop.
---
It's 100% cringe. Reminds me of those pictures of some special forces dude with some lame ass quote on top of it. Like so: https://imgflip.com/i/1o9r4e
---
Please DM me on Discord! Zizek#1575
---
gonna be a race to get Thex on every server.  Who will the lucky winners be?
---
Fair enough when im wrong im wrong.
---
You can keybind trinket slots
---
&gt;Fourth, its more vanilla like.
---
Wait what?
---
Its weird because if rushing to raid was what you really wanted to do I  classic why not just do that in BFA? Even though I raided a lot in vanilla it was never really about raiding. It was about ha ginger with your guildies,grinding, exploring places and so on. Being a rogue and sneaking into ironforge killing low level people who were pvp flagged. Climbing on top of iron forge, Just going out and getting Into world pvp scuffles. People worries about what classes are good at raiding and so on. This subreddit is going to be super toxic after release in my opinion. Everyone rushing to raiding. BFA is there if that's what you want. Raiding mechanics in classic arnt that crazy interesting. People are going go burn out super quick if they dont do what they did before Pick and class that looks fun to you and take your time to enjoy the game.
---
Not me.  I'm playing Hunt: Showdown, but to be fair... I was playing Hunt prior to being dedicated to play Classic.
---
Go back to retail mate, leave classic the way it is
---
I’m ok with those people sitting out a week or so. Leaves more boars for me to grind.
---
If you don’t think so you can play another game
---
Least excited about how poorly a few specs and classes perform.
---
Fungi Tunic is sorta a weird Shaman name, but hey, I don't know Troll culture!
---
Uhh okay? this was for OP not my personal beliefs into what I enjoy at 60.
---
&gt; People who want RPPVP outnumber those who just want RP.
---
source?
---
How about we just make this one better?
---
this.
---
playing a game 2.5 hours every day is not casual lol, casual is playing a few times a week for a couple hours here and there. playing a game every day is literally the definition of not casual
---
Bgs comes in phase 3 i think? Dw ull be 60 way before that :)
---
I don’t think the simple fact a server is PvE makes a difference like you describe, although RP is hardly a split-second server choice.  I do think it’s important to point out that streamers are unlikely to pick PvE and so you avoid that possible temporary crowd.
---
We can conjecture further when we have the realm list later this week.
---
"VaNiLLa WaS Ez MoDe" - retail idiots think the whole game revolves around raiding. And even then anything outside Mythic raiding is literally baby hold hands faceroll ez mode...so they're proud like 95% of their game doesn't require a shred of thought but 5% (mythic raiding) does. Amazing game experience.
---
Exactly! I think both classicwow and retail offer different things.. many people are upset and frustrated at retail because it has changed so much it isn’t even what it once was. 
---
Now that we have the option for both.. my stance on retail has softened. We will have our old dungeon crawler mmorpg back.. and if I want to blow off some steam by going Rambo on some turtles I have that too.
---
Nope. We don’t even get holidays off, they just pay us 2.5 our rate. The only reason I have Tuesdays off is because we hired another person so we can rotate off days
---
Assuming everything will be like it was in Vanilla isn't really fair either.
---
Yikes. Triggered.
---
Well, WoW in general is easy mode
---
Addendum to hot take: retail WoW has the kernel of an awesome multiplayer ARPG hidden deep down in layers and layers of shit still pretending to be an MMO. If they cut off the vestigial tail of what the game used to be it might actually be accessible to new players who aren't willing to deal with the sad pathetic experience that is playing from level 1 to (max level -1 ).
---
I assumed it was satire
---
I agree, and I never said otherwise. OP specifically mentioned not knowing the fights would get you yelled at, and at this point there’s no reason not to know them is my point.
---
Sorry about your SFK run though. They had to have been some of the worst DPS in existence. I don’t even remember the last time I wiped there, that’s brutal. :(
---
If you are not doong anything then yes , its worthless
---
and most importantly: grenades. As soon as I saw it working on the classic client any desire to go tauren went out the window
---
proof of the scam i talked about earlier... It was rampant... My experiance is totally diffrent to yours... You say that "Scamming isn't even that rampant on private servers. For some reason there seems to be a respect for trades." and I wholeheartedly disagree...
---
No true. Oom too quick. Bring one for warlock buff
---
Also add then to friends list so it will auto complete the name.
---
Laughs in mage
---
Just remember your wand is your best friend when leveling as a shadow priest and take the 5 points from the disc tree in wand specialization.
---
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT RAIDS.
---
LOL
---
You'll still have to fly back to wherever you were :P
---
Tell me you did read all wuests and never googled anything
---
It's one thing to change the game, it's another thing to totally hop genres, which is basically what they did. Pretty much every other MMO has mangled to evolve without totally pissing off their original audience in the way that WoW has done.
---
^ yep.
---
A personal use bot can be as basic as possible to accomplish its function. In the case of the mara bot im thinking of, the answer is no. I doubt blizzard would actually detect the bot. This sub isnt the place for me to share how i would do it. So im gonna leave it at that.
---
Compared to older MMOs, correct. I'm comparing retail to Vanilla however. Vanilla is one of those games on the surface it looks and feels simple to the casual player, but those who keep digging in will realize it has plenty of depth.
---
Anathema staff
---
I agree its not! They definetly have their place in raids, Its labled poor becaues you only take one or two and the dps is still low. These guides were made with noobs in mind as the priority, imagine rolling shadow just to find out that its almost impossible to find that slot and your damage is low!
---
Did a pretty good amount of twinking back in the day. 19 was my main bracket, 29 another one, but had 1 49 twink which I played a lot - paladin. It was pretty fun to have the option to be a healadin or a ret/reckbomb and have the sustain that was offered there. We actually had one crazy 49 shaman on the other faction who got to rank 11 (with some willing coordination from the warlord group to get him into the top bracket the last few weeks), so he was running around with a 100% mount, needless to say he always capped blacksmith or lumber mill before we could even get there, it was crazy haha.
---
Pally's can tank fine in 5 mans.
---
It's good and bad, depending on who you ask. A lack of catch-up mechanics forces people to progress at a more linear pace and definitely keeps content relevant much longer. The side effect of this though translates in to some problems that there are simply no way of getting around.
---
1. Most people won't see anything past MC/Ony/ZG. Good or bad, this is the truth. Your average raider will not complete BWL, AQ, or Naxx. They are simply too much effort/work to pull off. At some point, casual players will reach their potential BiS. I'm sure this is why catch-up mechanics were introduced, as it kept the casual playerbase in the game with stuff to do.
---
2. Lack up catch-up mechanics encourages guild poaching. Many guilds died due to this as good players in a guild stuck on content often get snatched up by the better guilds and then funneled gear. This forces the weaker guild to recruit and start the gearing process over for some people as well as losing their strongest players. Eventually, if this continues, the weaker guild just dies. With no means of getting better gear, there's nothing you can do.
---
I don't say either of these things to imply I dislike how Vanilla/TBC were run. I prefer them, if I'm being honest. But I do understand why the game evolved the way it did and why catch-up mechanics were introduced. From a financial standpoint it made the most sense and kept the majority of the playerbase happy.
---
Go play retail.
---
I was always bothered by classes that grade you based on attendance unless being there in person was important for an assignment. If I misses a lecture that didn't require participation then missing that chance to learn should be enough of a penalty.
---
Especially when you end up acing tests and assignments anyways :/
---
Did you know if you type your password Blizzard only shows it as asterisks? ******** such a cool feature
---
Don’t buy from AH, especially gear. Only sell. Get a gaming mouse with buttons on it. Find friends to level with, the whole point of the game is making friends.
---
This is a flaw with in the game it self, this is why a new expansion can never save WoW because in MoP is where it all got turned to shit where heirlooms were prime, game became really easy, everyone could do everything and etc. It would be so much better if we went back even to just early Wrath and went a different way with the game.
---
Selling gold will be incredibly tough because it's so easy to detect. (Blizz has logs of every single action every player makes)
---
Private servers only had a handful of GMs working in their free time and still managed to ban thousands of people buying gold; Blizz should have a much easier time doing so.
---
Yep! If you get to level 5 on the bank alt, you can pick up professions as well. Grabbing enchanting isn't all that bad of an idea after the first rush of low level mats clear the market.
---
You *will* need to send some money to this bank alt though. Posting things to the AH and sending mail does cost (low amounts of) money.
---
In PVE there are some abilities which are used infrequently and for which you don't need quick reaction time to click; those need not be keybound.
---
For example, in PVE a mage need not keybind portals, summoning spells for food/water/gems, AI, or mage armor. Priests need not keybind resurrection. You don't need to keybind consumes you only apply out of combat.
---
Anything that you use in combat has a keybind ideally, but you can get away with only having the abilities you spam keybound. Mages really should have frostbolt, fireblast, and AE keybound but you could get away with not having fireward, AP, or trinket keybound and it wouldn't have much impact on your DPS.
---
This threads retarded and emerald dream was a big rp-pvp realm with a population at "high" on retail.
---
Or you accidentally pull ONE extra mob and boom, you're literally the worst player of all time. Anyone whose a dick on wow is probably a massive prick in real life. Fuck em.
---
I never said it was impossible to scam people. I'll say it again. If scamming is a problem, which I doubt, then people will use third party guilds. Scamming alone won't stop gold to gold trades.
---
GODS IT WAS A CLASSIC NED
---
keep a healthy stack of water in your inventory. Level up first aid to save your mana for dps. Think about going alchemy/herbalism for health/mana pots.
---
Now that you mention it, why didn't they release WC3 Reforged already?  It would have been great to replay the campaigns leading up to Classic release.  I feel like Blizzard kinda missed a good opportunity.
---
That's good
---
If it hasn’t been said already, I tend to use help/harm macros on pallys and druids. So when you target a friendly you cast flash of light, and when you target a hostile you cast judgment. It’s my go-to and condenses a lot.
---
Lmao I was just playing on a pserver with the wife. She was playing by herself and took the tooltip that said the roads are generally safe to heart. 
---
Left her character afk to grab a drink, came back to find herself dead and a giant ass abomination slowly walking over her corpse.
---
Don't be afraid to hop to different zones while leveling and try to stay higher lvl then the NPC's you are killing for your quests. If your quest log is full of orange and red quests, it's time to move to another zone to do the entry quests there and come back to the first zone later when you are of adequate lvl.
---
I mean I would say that’s casual. In reality that’s the same as two games of league a day.
---
No worries, concidering that no one has actually played vanilla wow for over a decade, alot of these are open to an element of opinion! I just try to get it as accurate as possible, and I love all the feedback, good and bad :)
---
Playing with friends :)
---
 There are endless things that can be said. Off the top of my head one advice for questing which I could give, which helps everyone, is to invite and accept invites when doing "kill x number of a certain mob". Nothing worse than a lot of players standing around waiting for mob respawns and no one is grouping up. It makes it take longer for everyone. 
---
 People want to solo to get maximum amount of exp but in a situation with limited mobs available you should group up. Don't have to write any message before doing it. If there are a bunch of players in a mob area, just click invite. It should be understood why you are inviting.
---
I'm going to create my own guild from scratch with no one else I know.  That'll be something that needs to be done while mass recruiting while leveling, developing relationships with core, social members, and then trimming off the people that fell off during leveling and the ones that never communicate.
---
I should wind up with a good group of people after that by the time I, and others, get to 60.
---
Your reading comprehension is atrocious. From the comment I directly replied to:
---
“And good luck raiding if you plan to and don't know all of the fights.”
---
RAIDING is literally the fourth word in that sentence. So please, tell me again how no one was talking about raiding.
---
oh my god, I have the exact same memory. I was level 41 in Tanaris just outside gadgetzan on my rogue and I was a VERY confident PvPer. A Destruction Warlock at about the same level casually came up to me and deleted me in about three seconds. I had zero options. I had no choices. I simply existed in order to die to the warlock. It was incredible painful. After about 1 minute of staring at the death screen I realized I had rolled the wrong class. Logged off (didn't even log off at an inn) and made a warlock. Didn't hit 60 but that single engagement inspired me to get to about level 58, then burning crusade hit and I rerolled again.
---
This time around I'm going warlock.
---
respectable choice, dwarf is the chillest alliance race tho
---
Well I feel sorry for guys who will actually farm their gold... Majority of people who would do it will just buy it off the Chinese farmers and won't care if they lose some to a scam....
---
Everyone has time
---
no one has gold
---
Oh this is a good idea! I was worried about the weekend rush of everyone fighting for a boar lol
---
&gt; The trade could look as innocuous as somebody giving somebody a righteous orb in vanilla
---
Except we're talking about trading 1k+ gold here; NOBODY will just casually hand out 1k gold for free to another player unless they're quitting the game or something.
---
Not sure if Blizzard will do this, but the way it worked on pservers is that any gold transfer through mail/trade higher than a certain amount would set off a red flag on the GM's side for inspection.
---
Why do mages need to learn this? I plan on rolling mage in classic
---
Rp PvP server’s would have huge alliance/horde raids like every other day lol
---
PvP High pop with no cyrillic alphabet.
---
Also rip xXxIlllidanzxXx XxXArthasssXxX xxxLegolazxxx and Thex
---
Determine if it's PvP or Normal then agree on one. For extra fun, try writing the names on little slips of paper and pulling one out of a hat.
---
There are several items in MC that are BIS forever. Same with BWL and AQ. 
---
There is ALOT to do in the open world. But it makes sense that the hardest thing to do yields the best gear. The thing is though, to do MC you need gear from the dungeons and then advancing you need gear from each progressive raid tier. 
---
To address your imbalance claim, yes, some specs aren't good for raiding and that is just how it is. 
---
To your third point, there are many ways to play and enjoy the game and your distaste for one way doesn't make it less valid.
---
A rebuttal, if I may. 
---
*Ahem*
---
No.
---
I may just do a Tauren Warrior and start there this time... or an Orc Hunter and just take a small trip over. Not a fan of the Orc/Troll starting area.
---
are wow tokens tradeable? becouse you could just sell tokens for Classic gold on trade chanel
---
Do I buy the game and activate a sub. And what's gametime?
---
Holy fire, SWP, smite, wand till dead and recover most mana with spirit tap, repeat.
---
In my mind this fits to both a desert and a jungle. Nice song!
---
Thank the gods for that!
---
Im not gonna really play at launch because classes are starting. So im gonna start studying a week or two before my classes start so my gpa wont tank, then that weekend me and my girlfriend are gonna no life like a butch before classes get hard.
---
damn, that sucks. sorry you have it that way.
---
Classic is not that bad of a grind, getting to 60 and getting pre bis isn't as bad as leveling that neck or weapon, only for your efforts to be worthless because there will eventually be a catch up lol
---
ahh okay, sorry i couldnt be of further help
---
Im going to play from my hotel room in Italy while my girlfriend read :D
---
What a stupid question.. What the fuck is a Mage going to do with Agility?
---
This is exactly why I said they would trade righteous orbs. If you are paranoid about it just whisper the guy "hey thanks for the run, you didn't grab your orb"
---
That makes perfect sense tbh. would you say you are in the extreme end, since you are going out of your way to watch it. or is that what most do?
---
Same here, I have a switch and ps4 with loads of great games waiting to be played.
---
All I want to play is classic.
---
Currently planning my pc build to play it on a nice new rig.
---
The druid PvP sets are insanely well itemized for druid PvP. It's actually a really strong set, where other classes PvP sets aren't nearly as good. Like if you get the druid honor set, you're good to go for feral dpsing, tanking, pvping, and keeping yourself alive with heals. Those items are like bis for a loooong time, even into Naxx/AQ. 
---
You'll hit exalted lng the way with wsg and ab and av, which also give you some INSANELY good gear as a druid.
---
I will enjoy the game... by engaging in the trial of racing to 60.
---
Civ is doing well for me for a few more weeks
---
No one knows what is 100% correct silly! no one has played true classic wow for over a decade beside early beta leveling, so there is an element of opinion, considering that private servers have such a...varied element to them. 
---
Besides, these are quick look guides, primarily designed for noobs, to help narrow down their choices, so depth must be sacrificed for simplicity, and I'd hope that once these guides help narrow peoples choices down they would go find a far more in depth guide to properly learn the class :)
---
Mage!
---
Me neither, I’m not a big fan of the way Durotar is set up and I really dislike the coastal sections of the area. I don’t mind the Undead area either but Mulgore is by far my favorite. Teldrassil is easily second but idk when I’m gonna roll an Alliance if at all.
---
I'd always take a screenshot of the people doing that and black list them.
---
All I can do.  I mean... if you're going to just AFK, you should do it the smart way and find some corner of the map to AFK in.  That at least shows some effort on your part.
---
RPPvP, or the realm designated by the RPPvP crowd as the NA RPPvP realm. I have a feeling we’ll be getting a realm to call our own though.
---
I’m okay with that
---
When I accidentally hit my blink keybind (it was my middle mouse button) and blinked into Vael after our first wipe and wiped us again shortly after. Good times. 
---
Wasn't embarrassing at all being a Mage officer and all.
---
You don't have to buy anything beyond the subscription fee of $15/mo. Game time is just a way of talking about how much time is left on your subscription. "Having active gametime" is synonymous with "having an active subscription."
---
Your target levels consistently 1-4 levels too high for the dungeons to really be interesting to play through.
---
No problem. Happy hunting!
---
I like consumable farming. I like how it makes the AH more dynamic, changing the value of goods as new content gets released. I like that resource nodes gives me something to PVP over. I like having reasons to play on non-raid days that support raiding and require individual initiative to pursue.
---
I don't *enjoy* world buffs per se; I don't enjoy repetitively taking the time to receive them (too much standing around) and I don't like the feeling of dying and losing them early in the raid. But I support them because they're authentic and many other players enjoy them.
---
Yes pvp servers will probably pull the tourists in for awhile. Therefore your logic is valid.
---
most mmos have lost their initial numbers, just like wow. but i agree, i prefer classic over bfa by a large amount.i just find these dumb posts to be baseless and done by people who dont even understand what the game is now.
---
There's items you get from 40-59 in dungeons/quests that are pre-bis, and in some cases even BiS trinkets etc
---
Also you won't replace your gear when you ding 60 instantly, it's a process that takes weeks/months
---
4-6 is not enough. 7-9 is key.
---
So true
---
Don't read thread and move on?
---
Yes TBC certainly helped and wrath improved class balance further.
---
And while I think some changes could be introduced, ie changing certain coefficients for example changing bear form from a static +HP to a +% bonus instead, a lot of changes were the result of new talents and spells added.
---
Oh wow... I was also on Gul'dan in vanilla and I remember the name Bigstackstwo. Small world... of warcraft...
---
No, you can only sell them on the AH or use them on the account that is holding it.
---
Ganking stv with a 60
---
Classic can be progressed at one's own pace, certainly, but what is that progress?
---
In retail if I can only play for 30 minutes a night I can do a few quest clusters to progress the overall storyline.
---
In Classic if I have only 30 minutes a night to play I can run to a dungeon and then logout next to the summoning stone, I guess?  In preparation for the next night's playing?
---
That demographic also *loves* the game for what it is, IMO most people who would consider buying gold in Classic would be people that retail is more focused on. I think it's easier for them to just play a blizz game where you can actually pay to play vs risking your account or what have you.
---
&gt;No changes means no changes.
---
Which is silly because they're already making *some* changes, removing bugs, updating graphics, QoL stuff.
---
I personally cannot wait to invade Alliance territory in some of the prettier areas, and just chill enjoying the view/nature being a total pacifist to alliance noobies. &lt;3
---
Most people forget casuals just pug ZG/MC/Ony. Clearing 90% of the raids are super easy

I'll be farming harpies.

  &lt;DREAM&gt; \[NA-HORDE\] PROGRESSION RAIDING \[EST\]
---
**-Introduction-**  
---
\-Dream is a progression oriented east-coast raiding guild with a focus on forming meaningful in-game relationships while gearing up and aiming for the top content in the game.  
---
\-We plan to raid 2 to 4 times a week depending on interest and the phase available.  
---
\-I don’t like to use terms like “Hardcore” and “Semi-Hardcore”, because these words mean slightly different things to everyone, but I tend to think this is a hardcore guild with distinct progression goals.  
---
\-Our objective is to gear the core raid team and get them to be as powerful as they possibly can be, all the while creating friendships and bonds tempered by the heat of battle.  
---
\-From phase 2 onwards, it is our mission to have the faction-first clear of every raid tier, from Nefarian to Kel’thuzad.
---
**-Background-**  
---
From the time I was a tiny tyke I have been in love with this game. I grew up watching my parents raid MC, BWL, ZG, and AQ and I loved it. My mom was the top healer on her server (Shadowmoon) in the guild Eternals. Since then she has begun pursuing her career and left WoW behind, but I’m hoping to follow in her footsteps and lead the best guild my faction has to offer to massive successes and server firsts.
---
**-Mission Statement-**  
---
Our guild motto is “Teamwork makes the dream work”. It’s my dream to be the best damn guild our server has ever seen, and we can only do that if everyone gives 100% and works towards victory together. That’s why I think forming friendships in-game is so rewarding. Not only can you make these lasting bonds with awesome people, but honestly, I think you fight better when you’re fighting with your friends.
---
**-Positions-**  
---
We are excited to accept any and all sons of the Horde but specifically we are looking for officers, especially class officers. If you have extensive experience or knowledge with your class and are willing to lead and guide those members of the raid, that would be awesome, and it would go a long way to getting us to the top.  
---
Additionally, if anyone is particularly stoked about raid leading or recruiting, officer positions are open for them as well.
---
**-Details-**  
---
\-We will be distributing loot via loot council. The thought process of the council will always be made clear to guildees so everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.
---
\-Raid times currently are not set in stone because everyone’s input is important, but currently it’s looking like we are leaning towards Friday or Saturday night, Sunday night, and one weekday night (probably Wednesday).
---
\-Our discord server is not yet up, but should be in a couple weeks. Really excited to get that off the ground.
---
\-We need all sorts of players willing to put in their all to be the best on our server and I’m looking forward to meeting all of you. My mom met some of her closest friends in the world through WoW and I’m excited to do the same.
---
**-Schedule-**  
---
The first month and a half or so will be allotted to leveling and enjoying the game. Questing, the nostalgia. After that we will evaluate motivation as well as manpower and elect to move forward with raiding assuming everyone is on top of their attunements.  
---
From that point on (probably some point in early November) we will begin raiding consistently and gearing up our squad.
---
**-Conclusion-**  
---
I hope to hear from you guys soon enough. We’ve got a lot of positions to fill and I’m excited to meet you.  
---
My battletag is Hermarine#1245 - send me a tell and I’d love to hear your story and why you think you’d be a good fit for the guild.
---
And yeah, forgot to add that it will be a PvP server
---
What is the method for fishing? That sounds neat.
---
I’m 90% it was wrath as well, my dad Maine’s pally around then and I remember him noting it
---
Classic was always time gated tho with lockouts being a thing
---
This is for a bit later on, but learn the raid reset schedules! ZG is on a 3 day timer and Onyxia on a 5 day timer. Most will do ZG around the reset or maybe day 2, so buy as many cheap coins and bijous as you can and sell them on the last day. Easy money. 
---
Also find out what special potions are used in every new phase. AQ needs nature protection potions, Naxx needs frost and shadow protection potions. Buy them when they are cheap and sell (or use) them during the relevant phases.
---
It was added just after the naxx patch, so we dont know yet. It is apart of the 1.12 world ? or a part of 1.11 patch(IE Phase 6) ?
---
Classic will launch with the 1.12 class balance. Blizzard has not made any statement saying they will work on class balancing. As far as we know right now, the class balance at launch is what we get.
---
Piggybacking off this, you can usually pick up cheap wands at levels 5 and 13 from the auction house.  This is because enchanters make them to level their skill, and then try to recoup their investment.  Sometimes these go for dirt cheap.  The level 13 one in particular will last an especially long time until you find an upgrade.
---
I’m rolling a rouge simply to be toxic. And there’s no /s here. 
---
I’ve always been the nice guy. Always /wave to the opposite faction as to prevent confrontation. 
---
Not anymore.
---
consumables are frowned upon in duels imo
---
Create the free trial account for World of Warcraft and then activate a subscription.  
---
When you are subbed to WoW you gain access to Classic as part of that subscription.
---
Sadly that wasn't how it felt back in vanilla for me at least.
---
The amount of feedback we gave Blizzard throughout vanilla on totems and shamans in general only for Blizz to take a big dump on all of it with the shaman "revamp" in 1.11 still makes me mad to this day.
---
In TBC playing as a ele shaman I did feel far more as s support class. I would out DPS low geared players and people that were just bad no matter the class. But with equal gear/skill they would generally best, but I buffed them greatly.
---
I never mentioned raiding since I'm not interested in it. For a casual player like me there's nothing time gated
---
Any before and after numbers?
---
This was a big one for me too. Probably had a day of played time when my older brother revealed this to me
---
My husband doesn’t play mmos but I’m making his ass play with me.
---
Iam a casual player as well, have the same goals as you guys send me pm please i would like to join
---
It's cute that you think Blizzard doesn't have logs of everything you do and won't just take a 2-second glance into them to see that you didn't just run a strat live.
---
I’ll play a “conflicted” paladin who would attack the horde on sight but sometimes would cheer as they ganked alliance. He’s like a quarter orc and one 8th troll. He was abused by he church so secretly resents humans.
---
PvP
---
The experience of getting ganked and being a part of (on either side) mini raids on Quest hubs and stuff is something really great that adds a lot to the world and feel of the game. 
---
It's a huge contributor to Faction identity and loyalty. When that undead or night elf rogue camps you until you have to log off or go to a different area you'll know you picked the right faction
---
Class balance will be in the state that is was during 1.12, the final patch of vanilla wow. This is one of the most balanced iterations of the original game, but it is still not perfect. 
---
No manual tweaking of class balance will be done, what you see at level 1 will be what you get at 60. As far as what is OP and what is weak, it is a long, nuanced conversation. But Warriors and Mages are probably the top dogs by most conventional measurements.
---
But then you should make it clear from the beginning that you are farming for a certain BiS BoE item. You could pay them if it drops, for example.
---
Step 1 reroll warrior
---
is there a 15% tariff? for example if you post and the price ATM is 100k u get only 85k?
---
I didn't even think about false reporting. I would hope they have a way to tell false reporting spam. That's actually really lame and I'd hate to be on the receiving end of that horde mentality. Especially anyone who is new to the game.
---
underrated comment
---
Vanilla does not have the ability to freeze exp
---
You can do BWL the without full MC gear.
---
Alliance does have some really nice early zones. I personally love Loch Modan and Ashenvale. I know Horde have towns in Ashenvale as well and it’s a contested zone but I prefer leveling through 1K Needles as Horde. I’m so excited to have 1K Needles back from the Cataclysm!
---
* On first glance it appears that Juju's were added later in Vanilla. However, after a bit more diligence, you can see they were in the game much earlier... but as a horde only quests. The questgiver was later moved from orgrimmar to Winterspring in patch 1.7 and the quest also made available to alliance in patch 1.9.
---
* https://web.archive.org/web/20050224141526/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=4802 Showing juju's available on December 23rd, 2004. So before patch 1.3 (March 7th, 2005)
---
* https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=975/deprecated-cache-of-mauari#comments
---
Wowhead
---
The 2nd link has comments on Juju's as earlier as 1.3.
---
Based on that... I would say Juju's would be in from the start.
---
Hard to remember for sure but any time I raided it was on my summer break from school so it was at least a year break. 
---
If I remember correctly I probably rolled my Mage in the summer of 2006 and hit 60 in a few weeks because it was probably level 20 or so already and I was playing like 16 hours a day. Then quit around September and leveled my Priest to 60 on my Christmas break just before BC.
---
A rogue
---
Yea i was very torn on if i should put excels on disc for pve. Priest specs were verry hybridy and disc/holy were extremely similar to say the least, so i got a lot of conflicting feedback when researching these.
---
&gt;Blizzard has not made any statement saying they will work on class balancing.   
---
Yes they have. They have explicitly stated they will **not** be touching balance in anyway.
---
What a nice coincidence. Playing Hollow Knight atm too. Dont get overhyped. Enjoy every moment be it a nice little singleplayer game or some time consuming, almost second life kinda game.
---
No changes
---
“I played content from the previous xpac and it didn’t feel meaningful, can’t wait for classic” this sub sometimes man..
---
For me personally I plan on hitting 60 in 2-3 months. During that time I plan on experiencing most of the dungeons and enjoying myself. I'd say most people that play consistently will hit 60 in about a few months while not feeling rushed. After that you are left with end game content, which is primarily raids. It only makes sense that people will talk more about raids that will last for years than pre 60 things that for a lot of people on this sub will last a few months (unless leveling alts of course).
---
/world chat, your realm's Discord, and the ClassicLFG addon will be enough.
---
I love 40-man raids and quit (for the first time) in TBC in frustration with the the smaller raid sizes. 40-mans enable tanks and raid leads to serve so many more healers and DPS than e.g. 25-man raids, and that enables more people to participate in raiding overall.
---
Oh my god they’re fucked. Good news is after they file bankruptcy, Disney can save money on buying them.
---
If you work for 8 hours and sleep for 8, what do you do with the other 8? If 2.5 hours a day isn't casual, what do you think it is? Hardcore? Lol.
---
only one thing really, same rule as applies in the real world, don't be a douchebag. play the game, have fun, meet new people, don't feed the trolls.
---
But be careful! If the quest is to "collect X things" from drops ie boart hearts or centaur heads, you may shoot yourself in the foot because in most cases only one will drop for the whole party so people can loot ur rewards if ur partied up.
---
Horde always horde.
---
WotF and the Orc stun resist chance make a real difference when it comes to the chaotic mess of casual pvp.
---
Take warlocks for example. Rogues are their worst match up and WotF makes it even more rogue favored. Orc warlocks and their stun resist helps a lot here and since the undead are on their team no WotF to deal with.
---
I mean, there's only two to choose from: Rogue and Fury-spec Warrior.
---
Ya, no single right choice is why I like retail too. Particularly when it comes to things like if you want to raid as a druid, shaman, or paladin. Or what drops from a raid you want to use. Or what class I can play if I want to be a tank.
---
Definitely not going to happen.
---
If your battle.net account has an active Warcraft sub you can play classic, you don’t need to buy anything else. Just 1 active sub.
---
I was looking for an original name for my ne hunter, thanks.
---
Oh! I didn't know that.  Thanks
---
Actual casual guild:  “Maybe 7-8 of us will try to put together a ZG run this weekend.  Or maybe we won’t.”
---
Azeroth’s soundtrack is all I’ll ever need 😎
---
It’s only dried fruit tho
---
Most people agree that BWL is the best point for pvp before power-creep
---
Those professions were 🔑
---
I wonder what will happen after Naxx. I don't think Blizz will create new content for classic, but maybe some balance fine tuning could happen if that community isn't against it.
---
I must be crazy but for some reason I remember using two wands.
---
Whatever my guild picks out. PvP, obviously.
---
Hard to say, but I think the RP server (assuming only one per region) will have the most stable population. PvE/PvP players could start re-rolling if they feel they are on a "dead" sever.
---
Its about who is willing to spend more time and gold on consumables and buffs and toys. 
---
My advice? Incorporate gnomish death ray into your finishing combo. Gouge -&gt;channel ray-&gt;eviscerate. 
---
Don't fight other rogues unless you have ray available so you can wombo them if they are below 3000 health.
---
I put a BfA token up for more than the standard market price.
---
Whoever is buying buys it, and once I have my classic gold he gets his bfa gold back. That'd work. Obviously it requires them to have BfA gold, but should be fairly safe. If nothing else, If I get scammed I should be alble to use my new BfA gold to buy another wow token off the AH and try again.
---
When they added snowballs to the game, they had a knockback. If you went through the portal in bgs it would remove you from the bg.  So my friends and I would knock afk people out of AV with the snowballs, was the best.
---
 Now that it's only a few weeks away, and I just finished the second Witcher game I am in the same boat.  
---
I obviously can't start the third Witcher only 3 weeks from Classic cause I don't want to dump it without finishing and then only play WoW for god knows how long.  
---
Tried Team Fight Tactics for the first time last weekend though (played league since S2 but quit playing regularly years back and quick all together about 2 years ago) and have played non-stop since then. So for me it will be a good really addicting game where I just endlessly re-que until Classic... and doing other stuff besides games for a couple weeks I guess lol.
---
I'm only taking Thursday/Friday off, and it is a long weekend. I will; however, be making some healthy food to snack on so I don't find myself ordering Pizza (maybe one night-one meal only).
---
I also set a commitment to myself to go to the gym or run at least once a day when I'm off, and maybe gym in the morning/run later on.
---
After these initial days, I'll return to a semi casual, so I am trying to get as close to 60 as possible.
---
I've heard of a six tank strategy. I'd love to hear your rendition of it. 
---
My point though was that you don't need 8 fully geared protection warriors, even if you're using the 8 tank square rotation. You need 8 tanks for that strat. Those tanks can be BWL geared dps warriors acting as tanks for this one fight.
---
I really hope they are..
---
How is only taking 1 max for a buff that isn't worth it anyway while doing bad dps/running oom not bottom tier?
---
When I said fast forward two years I meant two years from when I started playing, not two years from when I hit 60 for the first time. 
---
I’m also writing this off the top of my head 13 years after the fact at 1am after a couple beers and an 11 hour work day. 
---
None of that matters, the point was that I loved the game then and I’m excited to play it again!
---
play the game your way and don't worry about what other people do. there will be people who take months to level to 40 and spend half their time socializing, there will be people who bash to 60 in a week and start raiding MC. they both win because they are goth playing the way they want to play.
---
At this point we're getting 1.12 class balance, all they've given is a very loose we'll see in the future.
---
I could see dual spec being added at some point over balance changes.
---
&gt;PVP is more popular than PVE across the board.
---
tells you how reliable polls are then
---
in vanilla there were more Normal servers, and Normal servers downed every boss first, opened AQ first.
---
&gt;I'm thinking that the vast majority of the people that will only play Classic for a while are going to pick standard PvP servers. Picking a RP or a PvE server is an "active choice"   
---
Not sure what you're talking about here, considering they are called "Normal", "PvP", and "RP". I'd imagine auto suggest (what most people will go with for server) will have Normal as the default check, and people just wanting to check things out won't manually select PvP.
---
During leveling back in the day, I'd sprinkle in battlegrounds constantly. 40 49 was my favorite bracket. Though, I'm curious why you don't mention 50 59, as there would be even less twinks there. The one drawback there is obviously more required playtime to get there.
---
Something I am a bit curious about - you said you can avoid seeing premades mow down people like they do in 60s, but it kinda sounds like you're going to be running a 49 premade yourself.
---

---
Since this ones gettin lots of constructive feedback (and some rather agressive ones for a quick look guide!), I'll be going back through and modifying some of these ratings for the final imgur album according to the really upvoted opinions! 
---
Remember folks, I'll do my best the first time around but I certainly didnt personally play every single class personally in vanilla, so please continue to point out if I'm off on some of these!
---
20-01/02
---
As some would say - don't yuck someones yum, unless of your its criminal then you can.
---
Last time, I checked it's not criminal to want to have roleplay and pvp on a dedicated server type which existed back during the games release period.
---
The last update was after the Ion interview. Where the dev's (Omar was there and another dev) said that they were now being considered and discussed. This has generated a significant grey area.
---
RP-PvP servers will be make by their community. The RP-PvP guilds that did exist prior to Ion's statement mostly twisted between RP or PvP or collapsed all together and very few now publicly recruit as a RP-PvP server.
---
We need the grey area to be clarified.
---
Grim Dawn has been keeping my attention pretty good. Of course it has its moments but never the less it’s something.
---
False play a rogue and tell everyone that you didn’t level lock picking, after everyone hearths go loot all the chests.
---
On the flip side we've seen first hand from private servers dominate guilds killing and camping other factions players can kill the population on a server.
---
I'm interested in joining, do you have a different discord link? This one is expired
---
Blizzard will begin notifying players about server imbalances during the two weeks prior to launch when people can select their servers.
---
Joining a guild now can be a significant advantage if you end up staying with them longterm. I think most people who really cared about that (me included) did that after Blizzard first announced Classic by finding a pserver guild to play with for the last year that will move to Classic.
---
ty
---
Well, u would miss out if it wasnt a pvp realm. Me personally would like to be on  a rppvp, but they said thats not happening. As to which realm, you could choose by name coolness factor, or wait and see what are server pops after few days
---
You still have time to delete this bro
---
There should be no problem finding groups at launch even for minor quest.
---
Keep fighting the good fight, man. Having my security and freedom respected is worth any level of frustration I have to deal with. 
---
The saddest part is people blaming GNU/Linux systems for the complications when the real issue is due to software (and game) companies just choosing to not support one of the most widely used systems out there. Most distributions are just as easy as using any other operating system otherwise.
---
Probably the same as it was in Vanilla.
---
They were in the game since at least patch 1.3:

What I meant is you need to buy the newest retail expansion **to experience retail**. Sorry for the confusing way I phrased it. You only need an active sub to play Classic AND Retail up to the latest expansion afaik.
---
cap put? Are you saying skip profs?
---
Agreed. I will be playing Classic on a casual schedule. (Once in a blue moon I'm sure I'll binge a late evening into the wee hours, but that will be the exception.) No raiding for the foreseeable future, if ever. Some late level dungeon runs, but my life doesn't allow for being engaged in a raid on a regular schedule for hours at a time.
---
In the wait for release, I've often visited the recruitment subs, looking to see if I could find a guild that stuck out to me as a place to find some folks in a similar situation, but most guilds advertised as "casual" look to be anything but when it comes down to it. Casual by the hardest of hard-core standards, no doubt. Casual in terms of "a good place to find sociable folk to share the leveling experience and general awesomeness that is WoW" not so much.
---
At this point, I am committed to finding a guild organically, in-game when I run into a good bunch of folks to do a dungeon or doing a group quest.
---
Look at all these *idiots*...
---
most: playing and progressing a character, meaningful grind.
---
least: 15 years older and way more responsibilities which leaves not a lot of free time to play.
---
No one has as many friends as the man with many cheeses.
---
I feel like going into MC and only getting XP from bosses would require a BIT of coordination... Kind of defeats the purpose of this discussion, which is to have a PVP bracket for non raiders.
---
No? Maybe I can farm gold more efficiently than all the mats. I prefer being self sustained tho, but sometimes time ez monee
---
probably the dungeons TBH.. also class mechanics, everything felt better and every class was unique.
---
A good rule of thumb is if you need to collect exactly one item, the whole party can probably loot the same drop. But if you need a bunch of something (like boar livers) then its a 1drop to a player setup. This still isn't always accurate, but it mostly is.
---
Orc fury warrior is top dps until naxx, i think, due to the amazing 1h axes you get.
---
Pure insanity, still tell them they are whack
---
Well.. orcs stop grenade stuns as well as stuns like intimidation and warrior charges.
---
Wasn't shockadin crap before TBC?
---
Why are you even asking anyone? I just read this entire thread and nearly everyone told you the exact same thing. Yet all you've done is debate and stubbornly reject all of their advice.
---
It's obvious you already know what you want to do so just fucking do it. You're not going to convince anyone you're right and I seriously doubt anyone here cares enough about your guild to seriously show you why you're wrong.
---
Do what you want, give it to who you want. You were given opinions and you rejected them. There's your answer, go in with your day.
---
We've got a whole crew of like 10 people at this point. I personally have the first 9 days off. We are going pvp horde NA if you want to join.
---
You likely will make your most money in the first few weeks but after that ita likely to no longer to do it by hand.

---
Dual spec will never come to classic, I can pretty much promise you. Balance tweaks? Maybe post Naxx. Dual spec? Never.
---
Buying And selling gold is strictly against blizzards ToS.
---
In all honesty if I saw you advertising in trade chat I would report you same as I report all gold sellers.
---
Dude I'm working for a gaming magazine as an editor/reviewer, you have no idea how hard it is to put 20 hours into something just to put up a review, when all I'm thinking about is Classic.
---
Attempting to manage the same issue. Drowning myself in TFT, Minecraft and cs:go.
---
Quit my private server in June, nothing wow related until Classic. It always feels better after a break
---
Back in the day clicking was the norm. Now it’s not and you’ll be at a disadvantage if you do.
---
Depends on your personal bio.
---
Yup this, they have stated this in multiple interviews and posts.
---
“This time around I have a busy life, so I’ll be playing very casually and only playing 50-100 hours per week”
---
I like flying mounts in every xpac but vanilla. This was the only content where they designed the continents with no intention of flying.
---
I disagree, dual spec is less impactful on actual game play than actual balance changes.  It's basically a bandage to hide bad balance.
---
These three weeks cannot pass quick enough! So excited!
---
Check out Michigan's stadium for college football. He is in the norm.
---
Fair enough! My wife and I can modify these to fix any issues for a final imgur album of them, and the thread definetly seems to agree that shadow should be higher rated so let it be so!
---
That said, i still think as far as a solo, noobie player is concerned, warrior leveling definetly deserves the very poor rating. 
---
And as far as disc goes, ill just shift that to negative if it was really potentially as painful as warrior!
---
Only problem is he also mentioned PvP and dual wield in PvP as a fury warrior is laughable unless you’re R14 making a PVP video killing people in blues and greens.
---
I mean you can, but it sounds like this dude is going to raid pretty casually. That group probably will need most of the gear to complete a tier.
---
Most people don't play on private servers let alone min max in them
---
Since this is general advice let’s go with what the majority of studies on the subject has shown. 7-9 hours.
---
For starting a dungeon, it's ideal to be about the same level as the final boss, but realistically you can get away with being 2-3 levels below or above with no issue - I wouldn't stop the faster players from leveling above your milestones. I would just target everyone to be in a range since you can comfortably get good experience out of the instance inside these ranges (3 levels below being unhelpful, and 3 levels above with mobs starting to go green).
---
RFC 15-16
---
WC 20-24
---
SFK 24-28
---
BFD 26-30
---
RFK 31-35
---
SMG 32-36
---
SML 35-39 (I would just combine these in to a single milestone; 35-36 to save yourselves a trip)
---
SMA 38-42 SMC 40-44 (I would combine these as well; 40-42 for both instances)
---
RFD 39-43
---
ULD - this is a weird one. uldaman was really meant to be done in two trips - the first trip at a lower level to unlock the back entrance, then a trip from the back entrance to the end. The level range in this instance was HUGE. The first boss through the obsidian sentinel were 40-42, but later bosses were 45 and archaedas was level 47. Recommended 40-44 for the obsidian sentinel, then come back at 45-49 for the second half.
---
ZF 46-50
---
MARA 49-53
---
ST 53-57
---
BRD 52+ - this one is like uldaman. You're meant to come in at a low level, kill fineous (level 54) for his hammer and get your key for skipping to the higher-level zones. You then come back at a higher level and work your way up to emporer thaurisan (level 59). You could come around ~56 and do it all in one shot if you have an entire day... or you can make two trips. 
---
Anything LBRS and above (including dire maul) involves a 60+ level boss - you can bring people below 60 here, but you're better off just letting everyone hit 60 at their own pace beyond your first BRD run. since there's no point holding them back.
---
This is a well established practice in OSRS &lt;-&gt; RS3.
---
if dual spec comes to classic it's no longer classic just some shitshow
---
There's Casual, Semi-Hardcore, and Hardcore  
---
Semi-Hardcore is a Hardcore guild except they only have like 20 people who can actually no life the game so they advertise themselves as semi-hardcorde while they try to fill out their no life core roster while using their MC and BWL progress to attract more serious people who will inevitably replace the coasters.
---
Dual spec is one of the most reviled features in the classic community. Right up there with flying mounts and random dungeon finder. It simply won't happen.
---
people were using neltharion's tear and rejuvenating gem at 70 in TBC
---
Eh not really. It will have better sustained dps on non plate, he will get smashed by warriors though. Bloodthirst is a fantastic alternative to mortal strike, deathwish, more fury, attack speed on crits. They'll smack peoples faces off.
---
Seriously? Why do we need the daily countdown posts
---
Or we could not generalize everyone and acknowledge that folks are different.
---
Also if you’re playing 16 hours a day with no job or responsibilities 20 days played could take a few weeks...
---
ofc i will, but they will still not invite me.
---
infact that is the main reason im rolling on an english server: my countrymen are known for their tedious meta- and achievement culture
---
isn't this entire thread real world politics?
---
I don't know about you but I will be playing in 2 days.
---
But that doesn't change my point. Just because there are SOME BiS items before 60 doesn't magically make the content relevant. You get that item and you're done.
---
Also, even on retail, up until legion, there were many BiS items from previous raid tiers. 
---
I just get annoyed when the mentality is always "Vanilla good, Retail bad" especially when the "fact" being stated is wrong.
---
Once you hit 60 the vast majority of 1-59 content becomes mostly irrelevant. That's just how the game is.
---
Defending Redridge from the horde.
---
Inevitable, but I think they'll leave at least some of the servers up permanently as classic and just let us clone our characters over to BC realms.
---
Same? My whole family is going to play and some friends. You’re more than welcomed to join us if you will be on US pve server.
---
I can relate to the post of your reply. I played classic and every expansion. Currently with my three young children I cannot sit down for long periods of time - I gotta take breaks change diapers and interact with my family (when I played classic I had a lot more free time to use as I saw fit) Content in retail is pretty to feel accomplishment, unless your running mythic dungeons for the first time which is ok it’s end game content and designed to put down and pick back up. Classic is designed the same way but doing wailing caverns for 1-2hrs and no interaction with family for me is bad. Not to mention brd and the such. 
---
You know the answers- retail allows for a more casual style of play right. Can classic? Sure level slowly etc., but I mean if you wanna clear a raid you have to highly involved in a guild so you can get a drop/invest a lot of time. 
---
I loved vanilla wow it’s what I started on and the first true mmo that sucked me in. My hope is that they blend classic into retail while still keeping what makes retail good. Sorry I’ll explain deeper and converse more 
---
But I’m at work haha cheers.
---
Right, couldn't remember the name, ty
---
I'd guess 100g for $5-10 USD?
---
Hard to say, it will likely be more early on
---
Being as it's an MMO without an actual benchmark there will be some variance, but for me logging in and out of Orgrimmar with and without is a difference of about 30FPS with everyone running around.  It went from right at 70fps up to 95-100fps.      It also removed any stutter from my gameplay in Org making it very fluid.  Keep in mind, everyone will have different results from this with different hardware.   I will be testing it more in the next stress test and also writing an additional guide to include WoW installation, as well as other tweaks I'm working on.  I will think about a way to present this with some form of methodical benchmark.  Maybe using flight paths or something?

East Coast.  This sounds awesome.  Still don't know what faction I am going but at least I do know what class depending on the faction that I eventually will choose.
---
I've always played tanks.  While the actual abilities/rotations/gear priorities/icon colors may all be different, there isn't much that makes their roles unique anymore.  They are completely interchangeable.  And while in some ways that sounds great, it's also quite boring.
---
They play the exact same way.  Lets run in, let me do whatever AE threat builder I have (is it the green one or red one on this class, I forget) and lets AE the crap down.  Rinse/repeat.  Don't forget that your defensive CD is the dark blue icon on this class, not the light orange one.
---
At no point in this expansion, have I seen another tank doing something that made me think 'oh damn, I wish I could do that'.   No, it's just 'oh, that's a cool yellow glowy move you did there, check out my red glowy move that does the same thing!'

Jagex monetized just about everything on Rs3 after OSRS became more popular. I can see more mtx coming to retail tbh
---
I think they should just announce their servers beforehand so players who want to avoid them can do so, and people who want to be on their server.  Avoid any headaches regarding "OMG I rolled on asmon server" or any little sperglings who are salty they have to wait until the server is known so they know where to make their characters to play with their heroes.
---
The streamers are going to have to deal with being followed, spammed, trolled, camped, etc, so hiding their server does nothing except delay the insanity for 30 minutes.  It's just better for the vast majority of players that big name streamers be transparent, I care less about the experience of a big streamer who has brought all this attention on themselves than the experience for thousands of "normal" players who want to avoid them, and for the players who want to be on their servers.
---
The Difference between Prot and Vengeance DH is that One is viable and the other isn't.

Saying that will never happen is way too premature. If anything, I think most MMOs in the 2030s will be strictly VR.
---
We're about 8-10 years away from AAA VRMMOs, but they will come especially as social VR gets more use in general as that will attract more interest in MMOs.
---
I’ve looked at holys talents though and all I see is some minor throughput added (like 10% additional to heals) and additional mana efficiency. What is being given to you in the holy tree that’s really making it that much greater for PvP healing? I’m asking as an honest question in case I’m missing something.
---
Yeah the server I played on in vanilla was one that someone who started before us got auto recommended too, it was even Arizona specific (no daylight savings time change). We got auto recommended to a different one, which I'm guessing may have also been AZ specific, then changed over to the one he said and rolled up there.

Wildstar failed

E'ko buffs were never faction exclusive.

You WILL keep your weapon skill up to par as you level no matter what. You underestimate the slow leveling in vanilla. In fact, you will hit your level skill before fulfilling your first bar. Taking this item from any caster is pure ignorance and should be considered as ninja looting
---
Bingo.  Casual players are going to see a news article that it is finally released and are like I may try it out on the weekend.  :)
---
Do you happen to know what the function is? Or have a source I can investigate? I have failed at googling this.
---
The best and efficient Nightfall usage is for the offtanks. They can spam hamstring to maximize uptime and be useful when they arent tanking. No wasted spots while having maximum nightfall uptime.
---
London player with a housemate who will play. We would like to join your disc please!

And here we have two valid ways of playing. Enjoy!
---
Well.... that was not the ending I expected.
---
A guide would be most appreciated
---
Crit will be worth like 20-30 attack power until you reach the soft cap of 35% due to flurry uptime. My number may not be 100% correct but it's a good benchmark. The warrior discord will be a better place to find the real break points.

Community development, progression is slow and steady.

I plan on rolling shaman and don't really like healing.  But dual spec makes choices matter less, it would comepletey change the game experience.   I was actually playing wotl when dual spec was first introduced.  Suddenly every dk and warrior became both tank and dps, it really made everything a little less challenging.
---
Germany. Depends on hte course, but you can usually choose between 1-2 hours per day for 1-2 weeks, or a weekend course. Contents are relaxing techniques for the women, massage techniques for women and child, breathing techniques, how to handle your baby etc etc. Its pretty good, but the timing is super unfortunate.
---
Private servers dont have to worry about PR so they can ban who they want with whatever evidence they have. Blizzard doesn't have that luxury.
---
So the "attunement" is just a key, meaning you only need 1 group member to be attuned? Or do you need to be attuned AND have a key?
---
It really is. 
---
I'm on my second play through right now and I have a decent understanding of the mechanics, but the diplomacy mod has a few things I'm not to familiar with yet which is making the game that much more interesting.

It'll be a good single player game to play when I can't play WoW for w/e reason.

Too many people on this subreddit deny that a population drop will occur because they themselves won't drop. Such a widespread absence of empathy is concerning

You arent forced by law to take them, but every gynaecologist will insist that at least the women should take these. The cost are covered by health insurance, so its a no-brainer. See my answer to u/brewingendurance for some other details.

Yeah, this isn't one of those "don't generalize!" cases. No one functions better on 4 hours of sleep. Some may have a better tolerance and ability to function on that amount of sleep than others, but no one is optimal on that amount of sleep.
---
Could you expand on what sort of greifing issues you think you might encounter while playing on a server with a big name streamer?
---
The stuff matters because it impacts your progression tremendously and for much longer because leveling is an actual enjoyable rewarding part of the game.  You get an upgrade and you may use it for 10-20 levels and it actually makes you stronger and better while that aspect is gone in retail
---
I’ll give you this.
---
&gt;I really love 5 mans
---
&gt;just gonna play for an hour or two
---
Good luck with that.
---
Luckily for me im addicted to osrs but I imagine I will swap a great chunck of my free time once wow classic hits. It is my prefered game after all :)
---
2 agility? You wont notice any difference. Yes you can argue that it has agility and take it. But I would honestly feel bad doing so.

Fake news.

What do they do?
---
My casual vanilla raiding guild raided 3 times a week for 3 hours at one point.  But each raid was something separate like MC, BWL, Ony.
---
Raid attendance wasn't mandatory and only about 25% of the guild raided on a consistent basis.  Progress was slow, but fun.
---
Any guild that schedules more than 3 to 4 hours of raid time when MC and ony is the only available raid content is gonna be bad
---
Not required but it is probably the most efficient way to make gold in classic. Also if you can get ahead of the curve its one of the faster ways to level (second to maybe hunter).
---
The stress test is on 8-8-19 @11am PST. It is world wide at this time so check your local time zone for this conversion. 11am-1pm is the most important time for the stress test as that's when they want the biggest flux they can possibly get to monitor it. 
---
Name reservation will start on August 12th @ 3pm PST and will be worldwide again so let it rip at that time .
---
That's literally the dumbest line of thinking.... Like people have been selling achievements forever. One of the reasons why the pvp community is dog shit. A bunch of ass players flexing on other ass players with shit achievements.

I'm taking my family to California from the 26th - 6th...I should be excited but I'm secretly upset I'll be missing the first 10 or so days of classic :(

Dwarf to dispel blind and other poisons and even bleeds
---
Hes just trying to have a conversation with you lol.
---
Most: Experiencing something I missed out on because I thought only nerds played MMO's
---
Least: Being a responsible family man and business owner I cant sink the time into the game I want to. As an example, our busiest week of the year starts Monday Aug 26th so I will only be able to play a few hours each day the week the game releases.

I would for sure be open to changes as long as it is to low power classes/specs only, and only if the changes are done incrementally to nudge up the power scale. Nothing grinds my gears when game designers "balance" things by buffing 80% of the kit and then that thing they buffed is grossly OP for a long time.
---
No it‘s just a key (a ring) and you only need one member with it in the group to open the door to UBRS. Once open anyone can enter through the door.
---
I agree 100% my friend.
---
same. but my friends are playing together and taken time off work so by the time I arrive they'll probz be mid 40's + lol
---
Yes. The skins are worth far more than the materials you need to mail.
---
worthless. Only the top 0.1% will be able to aoe farm on launch, and those that are top 0.1% won't need a guide. AOE farming on classic is also far harder than on private servers.
---
Anyone who needs a guide or hasn't AOE farmed extensively already shouldn't even attempt it on launch.
---
Mailing costs next to nothing.
---
If any one here is defo not going horde, I have a group of 20+ people doing a casual Alliance guild (Raid once per week) on a pvp server with UK leadership, PM me if interested. I’ll join your UK discord if you’re planning to make it more general than just your guild.
---
It's 10c to pick up herbalism. If it works out, great. If not, no big loss. I'm certainly not pouring money into a crafting profession at launch.
---
Just use an NA account. Ping won’t be that terrible
---
They haven't made any statement saying they will. Am I wrong?
---
Quit raiding on pservers when release date was announced. Picked up new PoE league a few weeks later but burned out on that now after going hard on that. Doing things around the house for now with spats of Witcher 3 side quests here and there.
---
Kind of. If you stuck to say just 2h swords. But when you go staff -&gt; sword-&gt; axe -&gt; staff -&gt; axe then this is far from the truth
---
Doesn't work if your work blocks the connection lol
---
I gotta do it from my phone ha
---
I also agree as a warrior. The only time I’d need on it is if every int user in the group already has it.
---
Same with the ember stone staff. I’d hold out for smites hammer.
---
Exactly. You don't know how solid someone is until you play with them. Add them to the guild and give them a trial run. If things work out, great! If they don't, part ways. Just because you cleared content in vanilla, tbc, etc doesn't mean you are  good player.  Lot's of shitters get/got carried.
---
The app is pretty good.
---
You can tell you're gonna play enhancement shaman
---
Yes because
---
Classic wow is old enough that it will feel new to people who haven't played on PS.
---
Once that freshness wears off for most players within 5 years the tBC advocates will gain support. 
---
While I personally disdain the MoP expansion, I acknowledge that it has enough fans that in the distant future blizzard will be economically compelled to create MoP servers
---
It’s all good, it’s self inflicted lol. It won’t last forever
---
&gt;only be able to play a few hours each day
---
That's more than most people play!
---
You too pal. See you in Azeroth.
---
I'm playing other games so my fingers learn all the buttons on my new mouse, but I'm not burned out on wow before I start.
---
6 intellect? You won't notice any difference. Yes you can argue that is has intellect and take it. But I would honestly feel bad doing so.
---
Remember of thex is taken there is backup option - orc shaman thexar
---
Let me guess. You play a Khajiit?
---
That's why I said see if it works as is...
---
Having an overkill PC for the wow classic requirements, instead of a potato inside a shoe box.
---
I think someone was saying that pservers have flags set for trades more then 200g
---
considering they havent mentioned it I do think they will be added. If they were stuck on not having them they wouldve said so loud and clear. theyre atleast considering it imo
---
They do fine on boss logs, on overalls it's very clear they are getting carried
---
Thats also because solo leveling a hunter is by far the easiest and their accounts would be constantly banned so they needed to level quickly.
---
No it isn't. 6 Intellect is 60 mana and not even a tenth of a percentage of crit at that level, that's it. 2 agility is armor, AP, and quite a bit of dodge and crit at that level.
---
If anything, the ring should ONLY go to hunters, paladins, druids, and shaman.
---
Just invite the bf over to rail your wife while you play
---
I am not seeing it yet, but their is a version of bartender 2 that works for the private vanilla servers. Id imagine if not by release within a few days of release someone will update that for whatever changes it needs to work with classic.
---
thank god!
---
It's back up to full price but I kicked myself because like 3 weeks after I bought it Steam put it on sale for $2 or something ridiculous. 
---
OH well, even full price it's worth every penny IMO.
---
If you want to be the wealthiest, playing the AH is going to be your best bet. Just like real life, the people that make the most money aren't the ones producing anything. They just move numbers around to make bigger numbers.
---
My man!!
---
How naive you must be to think even a single gold buyer will be banned. A single Faldo positive would be a PR nightmare
---
Im gonna more than likely tank as a war or druid. Im gonna have to stock up on monsters and pizza monday night.
---
Wow, not only you are toxic and misinformed, but also lacking basic foresight regarding how long enhancement shaman with enhancement gear will last with single totem twisting cycle costing ~500 mana VS totem twisting resto with Mana tide.
---
Bf as in best fruend???
---
The average time to 60 is like 6-9 days. So even super fast 6 days since you'll pick up some rested is 144 hours. You're weekly average play time is 9 hours so you'll be looking at 16 weeks/4 months. You will be out leveled. But I think there will be plenty of people in a similar time crunch so I wouldn't worry too much.
---
4 % Crit in total. The improved part is giving you a whopping 12 agi or half a crit. Meanwhile a resto can twist it and give you 77 agi without being a completely shit dpser.
---
We know how totem twisting works in the discord. And we know enhancement isnt worth it at all.

It really wasn't hard to gather enough lower end purples for your second role, though for 5man and even 10 man you could fill out your slots with some cheap crafted blues in a pinch.  There were enough pug vault and obsidian sanctum raids that I basically already had a set of tank armor on my dps dk when it hit.
---
I'm not sure exaclty how this would work, seeing as you can't raid/dungeon with people on other realms. The closest you'll get is a Realm Discord/Forum that has a LFG section to help coordinate meetups.
---
Auction house pvp is where the real money is.
---
im planning on hitting 49 in about 6 months lol
---
That's just ignorant, you can't farm lvl 60 and get all pre-raid BiS in a month for 40 people.  My guild is fairly hardcore and insists on min/maxing and my guild leader laughed when I asked if I had to have pre-raid BiS before MC.  The bottom line is MC is not that hard, you don't need the BiS to do it.

My gf always comes over when my wife goes to see her bf. She doesn't let me play WoW either :(

Lot's of people argue that hunters are. Leeway seems to be impacting mages ability to AoE farm, and hunters are able to solo farm very profitable dungeon runs in Mara (Princess runs) and Tribute runs. These are done in the closed ecosystem of an instance. Still many people argue mage as well! Much more choice in what you are AoE farming, you have dire maul options as well as plenty of open world stuff. We don't know if blizzard will tweak any of these either.
---
The most important skill to be the wealthiest player on your server will be the ability to play the auction house - that's where the real money is made. Also consider leveling many many characters to 35 so you have 300 professions. Generating arcanite bars, mooncloth, and some refined deeprock salt every few days on 5-20 characters will yield increasing automated profits the earlier you can start multiple of them going.
---
It’s a meme
---
Undead?
---
Well classes you named should have highest priority since they benefit from all the stats
---
Domino's the real MVP.
---
Give AP, haste, frost resistance and more, depending on which kind you farm. 
---
Here's an useful link: https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=juju#items

Basically this.

There's lots of ways to make gold in classic. I would argue that mining is the best way to make gold. I doubt AOE grinding will be the best way with the lower mob density and respawn rate.   
---
Rogue with stealth run and gank to get the devilsaur/black lotus first.  
---
A crazy way to get gold is farm the quest items needed for the Whirlwind Axe while your doing the quest if you wait at 40. Specially at release, all the warriors will want the axe because of the guides and hype.  
---
The ultimate way to make gold is controlling a part of the auction house market. There's website and add-ons that can help you with that.
---
With the upcoming stress test I thought I would upload one of my better 1-10 runs on better as a dwarf priest. Utilizes lots of death/unstuck skips.
---
The real benefit of Moonfire is the huge column of light that comes down to point out to everyone on the battlefield where the target is.
---
Your guild is at least 40 people and probably more, all of whom will have opinions about the best way to distribute loot. That's not a sign of dysfunction, it's just a fact. Your options are to clarify the rules in advance or wait and discuss it when it comes up. What do you gain by waiting and discussing each item on a case-by-case basis?
---
If you think the rule should just be "Everyone who wants it rolls" or something else very simple, the problem is that your guild is large enough that it almost certainly contains people who think that's not a good way to distribute loot, so you still have to discuss loot rules to come to some kind of compromise that keeps everyone more or less happy.
---
It will be $60-$80 for enough to get an epic mount. A fair price IMO
---
This is why I've been self-employed my whole life.  Fuck that shit man.
---
&gt;bad DPS
---
Spriest can at least be competitive with hunters.
---
&gt;running oom
---
If you're an idiot who doesn't prepare properly with potions/runes, yes. Believe it or not, Spriest actually DOESN'T run oom very fast when you don't have to cast SWP, since SWP is your most mana-intensive spell. Mind Flay is pretty cheap, and Mind Blast you only cast every 6-7 seconds. With Major Mana potions and Dark Runes, you can easily go like 2-3 minutes without OOMing, and that's without downranking.
---
I too just started hollow knight. I feel old with how much I'm struggling on some parts. Tough game but fun none the less
---
You can easily farm 130k in about 5 hours of play time on retail, don’t sell old items, re sub once, cancel the recurring payment, farm for 5 hours a month on retail and play for free.
---
  "My sole companion is my weapon. I must care for it better than any hunter has ever cared for his beast. I must master it more than any warlock has ever mastered his demon. Without me, it is useless. Without it, I am nothing. "
---
As soon as i read this part - i immediately pictured the bathroom scene from full metal jacket.
---
thanks for sharing!
---
Definitely makes sense. Either way I'll be there. May the hype be with you.
---
Wait what? I heard around 240h played or 10 days is normal and alot of ppl Will take even longer? Unless ur super efficient 6 days is not possible. Isnt that like close to world record? ;p
---
Afaik the good druids use both regrowth, rejuv and healing touch with different ranks as well. It's very different to just spamming Flash of Light. 
---
They are quite slow and gear dependent though so you might not be that great in the earlier phases. All out druids are going for flag carrier PvP spec until phase 3 (BWL) but I'm not sure how common that is.
---
You give it to a resto shaman that likes to respec for pvp over the enhance memer that barely contributes.
---
If anyone wasn't aware you can play D1 for free in a browser now

My dad New Hampshire’s a Warrior and he said the same
---
Yep on first reset in current season people were demanding mechagon archievment to get in it
---
Not decided really, we will go with what feels best once we hit 60
---
they were almost exclusively rogues on my server(arthas)

---
So much of a priest's damage when leveling is from wands, so it doesn't really matter much one way or the other.
---
And yet, the elemental shaman still puts the warrior to shame in PvP.
---
Why? It's a common phrase to utter frustration.
---
It was such an easy gen ed class. I don't even remember what it was, but I do remember the one day I actually showed up, we were watching the Leonardo dicaprio romeo and juliet remake. English maybe? Thing is, I read hundreds of books. Started reading YA and even adult novels like Stephen King when I was 12-13, because my mom was a big reader. So English was always my easiest class, and that didn't change in college.
---
But you would also have to level to cap right?
---
Nobody really knows because probate servers are inaccurate. However, based on them:
---
 - Early phase (before dire maul) rogues pickpocketing dungeons is the highest gold/h.
---
- Once dire maul comes out a rhokdelar hunter soloing dm is the highest gold/h.
---
- When ZG is out a mage AOE farming certain ZG mobs is the highest gold/h in the game.
---
Generally though hunters, mages, rogues, druids and warlocks can farm at very high gold/h.
---
That’s bad.
---
Since the client is based around wotlk, I think wall jumping won't be in it
---
But why hold on to the old items?
---
Other than sentimentality, they serve no other purpose than to be sold, becoming useful after all of these years in pixel purgatory.
---
You do have a point though, and I was probably going to create a retail character to farm the gold as I'll have a bit of time every week to do so and thus save money.
---
So they could hide from the devs?
---
Wr is like 4 days
---
seconded!
---
&gt; There’s no way to detect gold sellers or buyers without a huge number of false positives.
---
Hence why they are checked manually. What, you think these things just auto-ban anyone who trades a certain amount of gold?
---
&gt;here’s nothing against the rules with listing a single copper ore for 5,000g. If someone buys it then yay to me. And if I buy a copper ore for 5,000 gold off the AH then I’m just an idiot or I misread the price
---
Ah yes, of course, you just happened to post some worthless item for 5000g and someone else just happened to accidentally buy it. Of course. No RMT here, just a simple mishap of two idiots being careless with their gold. :\^)
---
Well the games nickname used to be world of warcrack* so it makes sense honestly.
---
+1 to zero tolerance policy. I hope more guilds follow suit.
---
Jesus thats fast :p still 6 days is pretty insane for a casual
---
Dope.  Thanks.
---
It’s up to you, there only going to become more expensive, it’s like selling a bitcoin when it hit 1k
---
Bis for enhance? It deals fire dmg making it shit in MC and takes a debuff slot, knocking off powerful debuffs like Nightfall and Ignite. Its not BiS, it shouldnt even be used in raids. Nightfalls your BiS and you get a pvp weapon when you get it based on contribution to raid.
---
I saw the same thing. 
---
The alliance ones were almost exclusively night elf females, also.
---
Doesn’t the emberstone only drop after smite’s hammer?
---
I would assume so and was going to mention that in my other comment, but I can't imagine it taking very long at all to get to the cap, I did it with very casual play in Legion thru the dungeon finder. It was actually quite fun, I made a Worgen DK and tanked.
---
Isn't 6 intellect 90 mana?
---
wotlk was prob my favorite time in wow in the most ways, but it was what it was.
---
The storytelling. Like how the Onyxia chain has bread crumbs going all the way back to your very first quests in Elwynn Forest, or how you gradually begin to find out why those undead gnolls in Tirisfal are casting a spell on you called "Curse of Thule" only to eventually confront the dude who created it zones later.
---
I just love it. You miss out on so much of the game experience by not paying attention to quest text.
---
I could spend five hours, or I could just spend $15.
---
Am leaving on a 2 week holiday abroad on the 31st, swamped in work the week before that. This means I get to taste classic for a few hours, then I need to leave it for 2 weeks. Luckily I've booked an extra week off to go all out after. 
---
Guildies have been making memes about it. Damn them!
---
r/classicplus
---
I am doing absolutely nothing in preparation for the launch other than taking a couple days off to present for the madness that is minute 1 of live. I'll play until I want to take a break. Eat whatever I happen to have. Sleep when I'm done playing.
---
It's all going to come from simulations.  If you have less crit, crit will be more valued, but the more crit you have the less valued it will be.
---
Im playing retail.
---
Crucify me.
---
I just wanna feel the "vibes" until Classic starts. Im levelling a lot of alts since lvl 1 and casually exploring the world and quests.
---
do you know the disc name to the 1400 one?
---
Joana has The world record as a Hunter with 4 days 20h played. Gl getting close to that unless ur playing a Hunter/warlock as good as Joana is
---
Some people don't find that fun though. For me, finding my little niche on the AH is great.
---
That sounds good to me, I've been thinking of going Horde PvP!
---
A resto can easily twist GoA in a tank group, especially for initial threat. 
---
I have seen many hunters willing to Nightfall. It lets you take more hunters to raid and there tends to be too many in a guild.
---
Yes.
---
People here cling to this delusion that blizzard cares enough about RMT to go through the trouble of manually looking when recent history proves they couldn’t care less
---
Can we stop whining about a company laying off people? We understand you have an infantile view of the world but shut the fuck up already. 
---
Do you sleuth through every news publication and earning report for every company in the world to find any staffing reductions? Upon finding one you to peel your fat smelly cheeto dust covered ass out of your $98 Walmart fake leather chair, encrusted with hot pocket drippings and a jizz/sweat mixture seeping out of your fat rolls - You get onto your mobility scooter because you've already lost 3 toes from the 3 cases of Dr. Pepper you drink a day. 
---
You get outside to find your noble white steed awating you (geo metro with waifu stickers) - Armed with your boost mobile android phone and reddit app in one hand, and a 5lb gummy worm in the other you ride off to save the recently laid off by regurgitating bullshit on a internet forum for a number in a database and a sense of camaraderie and inclusion that you don't find anywhere else. 
---
All of those whom were laid off across the world are eternally in your debt.
---
Very unpopular opinion here but retail is still the same game with similar abilities. It's easier and faster leveling but harder raids. Try the level 20 free trial it will give you a good idea of what the game is about.
---
Leeds based, would be very interested in this!
---
https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority
---
The point is that there are milestones along the way during your 1-60 journey that feel like they impact the endgame experience, or are actually progressing your account. Sure you can do them at 60, but they're also worth doing while leveling and will remain useful at max level. Off the top of my head - plenty of Mara/BRD/LBRS/Sunken Temple gear reasonably obtainable at level 45-58, Hinterlands trinket, numerous good Plaguelands quest gear pieces, numerous BoE's like Devilsaur or "of X" greens. You can also do your attunements while leveling. Things like rep, profession quests/recipes, and gold matter in Retail too, but they're also in Classic, and having all of those, on top of the gear, matter more as major progression factors while leveling makes it feel like your leveling journey is actually connected to the goal. At least PERSONALLY on retail, it feels like I'm just zoned out questing until I hit max level, and then I start to work on replacing all of my gear.
---
It's pretty common to see level 58 Rogues with like half or more of their pre-raid BiS rocking a Thrash Blade and HoJ on private servers, because grinding the dungeons from 55-60 is (and was, and will be) a viable leveling strategy.
---
Used to be free trials up to lvl 10 back in the day
---
Prot warriors are almost required for 1.12 Alterac Valley, if you don't have one and the enemy team does it's game over for you. If neither team does, it's a turtle. And even for other latches of AV those NPC's hit so hard if you want to take Graveyards without a small raid of players you need a prot Warrior.
---
Other classes can try to tank, but those Warmasters do not mess around and I remember/have played on Retro WoW recently and was reminded how necessary a Tank is for Alterac Valley. 
---
This comparison is as valid as Druid being useful for Flag Carrier to be honest, and often forgotten.
---
Which is a bit of a shame. It's hard to decide on a server if you don't know which will have the most promising casual guilds
---
Youthinkyoudobutyoudont
---
That's a weird way to write 19.
---
Not all, I just expect it will be the focus. MMOs are stagnating in general. It needs a serious change-up.
---
In 10+ years, VR will be at a Ready Player One level which will enable it to be incredibly compelling for MMOs.
---
Free accounts can't trade or use map chat afaik.
---
BS4! 😂
---
Not all heroes wear capes they sometimes wear domino printed hats/shirts.
---
Probably both.  That's awesome.  I would reward them with my patronage on this alone but in the wrong part of the US.
---
btw you're using commas for periods.
---
Variety steamer, that definitely plans on streaming classic exclusively for the foreseeable future at launch. If you're interested check out my previous streams at twitch.tv/slitterbox
---
If you think everyone should roll on it simply because they have an empty ring slot then you’re just an awful player. This is a 90 mana difference for casters, this is hugely impactful because it’s likely two more spell casts before OOM. For healers this could save a wipe. And for mages it makes aoe farming variable earlier. In the early 20’s it’s likely you won’t have the mana pool for the last blizzard or arcane explosion to finish a mob pack, when solo farming this ring could be the difference.  So sure 2 agi on a warrior is technically an upgrade over an empty ring slot but don’t act like it’s justified.
---
Looking for a NA guild that will raid between 11-5pm EST.
---
A Tauren Shaman named Moothex.
---
It's mostly a method to weed-out those that feel under-qualified themselves. I've gotten jobs where compared to their asks I was way under qualified.
---
They are basically looking for competent people who are confident in themselves. The higher requirements scare away a lot of people they aren't interested either way.  
---
If you are job hunting, it's always a good idea to apply to those positions even if you aren't perfectly qualified on paper.
---
All theese comments saying AH is the best are probably right, but the best character to use for AH farming is going to be mage anyway because of portals and food/water tips.
---
- There's three times as much intellect on it than agility.
---
- Agility does far more for mana users that still melee than intellect does for non-mana users.
---
If we're approaching this from the perspective that you should need if it has any benefit what so ever, no matter how infinitesimal, like 2+2 equals 4 so yes, sure whatever. But I don't see how any decent human being could justify that to themselves. Complete lack of common courtesy.
---
Well, im aware of that, the question is can i play on best settings at high fps on it in all scenarios.
---
Yeah if you stick with specialty pizzas you get a real excellent deal but if you’re just buying one or two toppings often other deals will be just as good
---
Depends on location for sure!
---
I joined the discord of a "semi-hardcore" guild that wanted a full breakdown of all my raid experience for xpac by xpac as well as my average latency and FPS. They also questioned the fact that I said it would realistically take 21 days to hit 60. This was all **AFTER** I had filled out their silly application and talked to an officer of the guild.
---
 I'm afraid if I had hung around any longer they be asking my blood type and need a urine sample.
---
 I just wanna clear raids with cool people, man. World first bleeding edge progression on a 15 year old raid means nothing to me.
---
Lets be honest. Most guilds are going to clear MC/Ony in 1 day after a few raid days so no one will be raiding 3 days a a week for long.
---
Sure, in Phase 2, Barbarous Blade is just as good, if not better. But then in Phase 3 and the rest of the game, Dal'Rend's is better again.
---
Maybe you didn't have the experience as me, cause shockadin at 50+ was a great leveling experience for me.
---
And yes ret was slow it got better with seal of command but it was still slow.
---
And as for Prot i just never found it viable during vanilla, but maybe that's just me
---
Since I first tried a nostromo I could never play a game again without one. Keyboards are for typing, and that's almost been entirely replaced by voice.
---
Remember how different DK tanks were back when they first came out? Yeah that was different. Do we need a DK tank here for the magic mitigation, or will Warrior be better for block chance?
---
That isn't a thing anymore.
---
An upgrade is an upgrade, mellow it's not 60 gear, hell it's not even 20 gear lol
---
That's why blood elves were added to the game.
---
Well, i guess it sucks then.
---
I hate playing wow on low fps, especially pvp
---
Thanks man.
---
I have a team of about 15 that are going to make a guild on an EST server. Horde side. Really looking forward to seeing he names!
---
I loved playing unusual specs in 49.  Definitely my favorite bracket.  Will have to see if I have time to make a twink now that life obligations are very different.
---
Even if you shave 2 days off the nost average that's 10d played haha. Also OP is a troll
---
I'm also an RS2/OSRS immigrant and I'm really looking forward to WoW Classic. I tried out modern WoW but it was too hand-holdy and flashy, not to mention there were so many expansions and microtransactions that turned me off. I haven't played vanilla WoW, but I've watched a lot of "differences between modern and classic" videos and liked everything that I heard.
---
Everquest
---
why do you need a dedicated server?  cant you just organise your own RP guilds and events via something like discord?  i cant imagine there's gonna be THAT many RP-dedicated players
---
No thanks
---
What is this hearthstone thing and why is it taking my bag space? Must be from a lvl one quest or something. Let's delete it.
---
I started playing ffxiv and completely lost my drive for classic.... it scratches the juiciest rpg itch, and gameplay is gorgeous. I’m now nervous I won’t even get into classic much
---
That sounds great and I wish I had the discipline to do this, but if I had that level of discipline I wouldn't have given into playing :(
---
Just curious, what is the "flavor of the month" class for the patch wow classic is gonna use?
---
This is really nice, thank you!
---
Countdown to classic has a great community and there is a pretty cool podcast that constantly has people from the discord come on.
---
The biggest thing I noticed doing that was that while a ton of iconic vanilla abilities are still in the game, the simple understandable way they worked has been replaced by excessively-workshopped nonesense. 
---
Vanilla warrior’s overpower: if something dodged your attack, use overpower! It will probably crit and make them wish they didn’t dodge. 
---
BFA overpower: nothing about dodges. 1.444444% chance per point of rage used, to reset the cooldown of overpower and buff something else for 10%........
---
Vanilla execute: take your entire rage bar, and stuff it up your target’s ass. 
---
BFA execute: do damage costing 20 rage, but if you have more rage up to 20 more adds to the damage.....
---
Shit they had to nerf the scarab broach from aq40 because people were still theorycrafting with it at level 80.
---
"Most I met don't, some I met do" ...??
---
Ah yeah druids are realllly bad at healing in PvP.
---
It’s similar performance to a GT 950/1030. Check videos on YouTube to make a more informed decision.
---
Give me a group of 40 pugs with high quality dungeon gear who want to listen and clear BWL and I'll have Nefarian dead in about 4 hours.
---
BWL is not hard if your raid leader knows what's up and your group actually gives a shit.
---
&gt;But then in Phase 3 and the rest of the game, Dal'Rend's is better again.
---
What's missing phase 2 to make Barbarous better?
---
Yes. OSRS has more in common with RS3 than Classic does to retail WoW. Join the hype train.
---
Doing anything for 650 hours a year, not including the fact that you probably do more on the weekends, is definitely more than just a casual interest. It's not just hardcore or casual, there are levels in between.
---
Despite your unpopular opinion I will try to explain you objectively why you are wrong. I tried both vanilla and free 20 trial. With all the honesty, I was bored to death leveling on retail. Everything was given to me, the path how to level was already made and  lets face it - you rollface all the enemies with any sign of danger. This takes away the very interesting part of mmo - make your own way out of this dangerous world. This is what vanilla leveling offers.
---
&gt;So an intellect user would also be kind of a jerk to roll on it with an agility user in the group?
---
greens of that level give +2 agi
---
well rogues are still nr2 for health ticks from spirit
---
warriors get 80% and rogues 50%
---
meanwhile casters get 7-11%
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Health\_regeneration](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Health_regeneration)
---
Start reading it as "one three" and "one twelve", rather than e.g. "one point one two"... 
---
1.12 in a patch context is not a decimal number, but rather two distinct numbers, separated by a "."
---
It hadn't occurred to me that -other people- that will play classic won't be hyped and all log on the instance the servers go live.
---
Nope, it was 20.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
Report and move on is all
---
&gt; it just punished hybrids more than pure classes
---
No it just made them have to choose a single role/spec, just like any other class. As opposed to being able to toggle to a totally different one whenever the fuck they felt like it, free of charge
---
Just lower the settings lol
---
Thank you;)
---
Will do
---
Clearly people are forgetting this is a level 17 ring. This is an upgrade for everyone at this point and as such I would expect the whole party to roll without too much fuss. 
---
The drop rate is almost 50% off the 2nd boss in the dungeon (not including rare spawn). If they really feel entitled to that ring they can run the dang place again, or they can grow a pair and realize that it's a level 17 ring that will be replaced while leveling. 
---

---
I upvoted you because your thinking is so bizarre
---
I don't see how it's better? The tiny bit of str, armor and defense aren't really a good justification for a pure DPS ranged class that gets no ranged DPS from str. BB has 10 more AP which will contribute to their ranged DPS over the set bonus of Dal'Rends and the crit is the same. Am I missing something?
---
Also if I'm hunter I prefer 2hs anyway because it works better with raptor striking and dipping back out of melee.
---
I consider my guild casual (one night a week raiding, not starting for 3 months or so), but yes we have preplanning going on for professions and loot style etc. We may not be hardcore but when you want to raid casually efficiency still matters. The prerecruiting is just to try and get as many likeminded players on the same server as possible.
---
That said, the amount of “semi hardcore” guilds is hilarious in recruitment threads. 
---
Shameless plug...dm for details &lt;3
---
Nah it's an accessory to sell you into paying your monthly fee. Zero reason to give it for free to any point.
---
Even after you hit 60 as a feral druid you will have to farm ST and BRD for some items. 
---
As a druid in raid content you can still form a group with 58s and run BRD.
---
Just an example of how the world you level in doesn't feel pointless as soon as you hit level cap.
---
Lol I'm dumb ty will delete
---
Yeah, it really is. Which is why it's a good idea to at least do 2x what you need that week, and maybe just spend a bit of time getting started on next week's consumes. If nothing else it¨'ll let you not look like a jackass if something important come up and you have to raidlog a couple weeks down the line.
---
Damn thought it was 10 for sure, thanks for the correction
---
So wrong
---
Oh ya there a plenty of bis and twink items that are going to be worth 500g to 1k. I think you under estamate the flood of gold that will be coming in.
---
Wolk cinematic got me interested, b/c there was actual lore and not just random battle scenes. Also, watch make love not warcraft - by far one of the best South Park episodes.
---
Give this man gold
---
It was a 10 day free trial, that's what I was thinking of
---
It's an oldschool player sharing his experience after coming back to the game, and explaining why it made him more excited for Classic.
---
Goodluck with your report doing anything lmao.
---
I'm most excited about the newer and more modern technology that's widely available. From Blizzard's perspective, the servers should be more stable and easier to log on to (fingers crossed). From a player's perspective, the days of constant crashes, disconnects and shitty graphics are a thing of the past.
---
You all sound perfect for my guild! We've been recruiting a little online and through forums, but are mostly composed of IRL Friends. Our numbers right now are in the 15 - low 20s. We'd love to have you guys join, grow with us, and become a part of our core! Please check my post history for a more detailed description of the guild. I hope to hear from yall soon, and please feel free to message me with any questions or concerns yall may have.
---
I remember leading pugs to OS25 in WotLK, the amount of people who claim to give a shit and actually don't is endless.
---
What do you mean "Dodge the lava waves, that hurts my dps!"
---
You’re definitely on to something. There are a lot of other factors that feed into this and a lot of spin off effects, but you summarized the main thrust very well.
---
Except they did.  We were stacking Onyxia buffs and consumables in MC when we wanted to do sub 1 hour clears for giggles.  Also really started stacking Onyxia/BWL and ZG buffs when we could do both together in AQ.  Naxx was a whole other level of using consumables and that bleed over to where all TBC raids were done with consumables.
---
Shaman don't totem twist lil boy
---
Yes, as a casual player im actually advertising irl because i want my irl friends/coworkers/etc to play on the same server/faction. Otherwise we’ll figure it out as we play.
---
Using an offline db like keepass is going to be more secure than using Google's password manager. So it is different.
---
It was there in Vanilla, and it is a good way for people to try the game. It's especially good for getting more players later on when there isn't an influx, so I'd definitely like it if it was in.
---
Most negative responses here clearly don't realize it was in the game, and don't understand what trial accounts could and couldn't do.
---
I reinstalled starcraft 2 and started playing custom maps, its the only thing that is currently bringing me joy in the gaming world.

You can do the raids without world buffs and consumables.  Just because other guilds are doing it has nothing that impacts your guild's progress.
---
bad mod
---
Oh ok. Yeah I figured it'd be something obvious like that.
---
Still I'd yield them to other people until they're unneeded otherwise because of the slim margin we're talking about and how easy barbarous blade is to get.
---
Lol that’s cute
---
I know it is a personal preference but I love world quests. That is the main reason I play. I love big long story lines that string me along. I love seeing new environments and looting all the monsters I kill!
---
And that's great. I'm not refuting that.
---
It doesn't change the fact that once you're level 60, 1-59 content pretty much becomes irrelevant minus a few exceptions.
---
Maybe if you use a level boost and full heirlooms while being rushed in Island Expeditions.
---
You're the man! Thanks for taking the time out of your day  and writing all that out. I'm gonna screen shot this. So I wanna level with tailoring and herb for the pre raid bis, but do I need to max tailoring for those pieces ?
---
You're going to need the dps spreadsheet or a simulator to get a real answer because there are too many variables to take into consideration. I'd ballpark it somewhere in the range of 25-35 AP per crit depending on buffs and gear options, but that's not very helpful in practice.
---
You mean classic wow is getting same requirements as bfa?
---
They aren't going to do all this stuff. Just look at gold selling and buying. It still exists. It's still a thing and is rampant on private servers. So that GM volunteering his time is failing spectacularly. You would need to set up such a ridiculous surveillance system to monitor all transaction, it ain't worth it. They aren't doing all the stuff you're saying they are. Plus they have a financial incentive to let it happen.
---
As sad as it is, there will 100% be "boosts" for gold (and not only), gold selling, exchanging gold between retail and classic (which is not against the TOS and people will safely buy gold like this), and this shit will be all over /2 and /4
---
&gt; A Shaman with a Pendulum of Doom was ~~practically unbeatable~~**FUCKING AWESOME** at 39.
---
yea tbh I’m just leveling now and keep getting into new jobs so haven’t even reached endgame yet. I’m sure il get bored as fuck at some point but for now I’m just shocked at how fun it is.
---
Wheres the 1 black friend you guys all have?
---
I’ll be joining Thexx-PvP
---
Adding on this, players usually use the mail system as a stash. Send items to your alt and simply let it sit on the mailbox for like a month (idk how many days but there is a limit).
---
Classic is releasing, wives are going to be upset all around lol
---
Asmongold is announcing his server.  I'm sure his server will be the "streamer server" so if you want to play with them, or troll them, better roll there.  Esfand is going to be on Asmon's server but not in the same guild.  
---
I'm sure plenty of streamers will want to be on the "streamer server" but others will want to spread out and pick their own.  I feel avoiding a streamer might be difficult.  Let's say there are 20 North American Servers, there are 20+ high profile people that could pick a server and you're screwed either way.
---
Redridge
---
I bet if we went back in time, we wouldn't repeat the same mistake twice.
---
I'll be twinking too, incredibly easy to farm my BiS with multiboxxing :)
---
Stick to your retail game, snowflake.
---
AV is 51-60, which is the only thing I care about.
---
Yeah, no. Please do not make major changes to a game that I have not yet even had the chance to experience.
---
It won’t be
---
There'll probably be a wipe or two in the suppression rooms, then a wipe or two on Flamegor while the tanks figure out the swapping, a wipe on Chromagg, and 2-3 wipes on Nef.
---
It's possible the pug would have to disband and reform the next day to finish off Nef.  That fight is a bit complicated.
---
I didn't expect such weak arguments honestly.
---
Nice, PM me for the link
---
I never said it makes it worse. How did you get "worse" from what I said? I said it changes the core game.
---
And there is no way they are going to change the core of the game 20 days from launch, and even if it was 6 months out they probably wouldn't make any changes, because that's not what anyone asked for.
---
STV
---
Everything in this game is the fault of the (((elves))).
---
Fucking knife-ears used too much magic, and brought the demons upon us.
---
That's what the root of the problem is.  
---
Around elves, watch yerselves
---
Some people want to make it a race. For everyone else, even if you clear a raid week one it's highly unlikely you'll have everyone geared by the time the next raid comes out. So in that regard clearing as soon as possible becomes important.
---
Whoever gets the name on that server is basically revered as a god and given Scarab Lord
---
lol, yes I'm a gold seller who pays rent in California by farming gold. 
---
I take it critical thinking isn't your strong suit. Gold sellers are generally not going to be speaking perfect English.
---
And, yeah, it is "pretty common" to LIST items for hundreds of gold. Will someone buy them all? Maybe one item every few months, and that makes it worthwhile for the seller.
---
&gt; So that GM volunteering his time is failing spectacularly
---
So just because the volunteer-free-time GM is not stopping 100% of gold selling, he is "failing spectacularly"
---
lol
---
Another gold seller to add to my block list :)
---
Just buy a new laptop with a 1660ti and you'll be set.
---
The Barrens
---
That happening once is at fluke, twice or more means they are selling/trading gold.
---
I mean, you basically just said, "Give me 40 decently geared and skilled players and I'll down raid content."
---
Well.. duh! The fact is, you're not going to magically find 39 other people that fit that criteria unless you take the time to vet and appraise them. At that point you're basically forming a raid guild. Simply out, your average raider isn't that good. Nor do they care that much. So you're not going to get these 39 other players as easily as you claim.
---
Any content is easy if you actually listen and do the mechanics. It's like saying, "The boss will die if it's HP hits zero!"
---
I feel like the streamer server should be The Barrens
---
Every guild in recruitment:
---
"We are a family-style guild looking to raid once we hit 60"
---
I quit ESO years ago after I became Dro'Mathra Destroyer. It's a fun game though.
---
tom cruise hates SPs
---
So funny actually, when vanilla was coming, i was at the age of 11, now im 26, have wife and kiddo.
---
World just became so different.
---
And here comes classic, bringing so many good memories
---
Barbarous Blade is impossible to get until Phase 2 drops.
---
Getting a full Bloodfang set and destroying everyone in BGs.
---
Also nice for convincing a friend who is on the fence about subbing. I would be fine with a Classic trial of some sort with the appropriate restrictions of course.
---
Thank you for sharing this...
---
I am not the person you were talking to.
---
I will for sure!
---
As a Marylanding Mage, I concur
---
And I am sure u r updated every toe ppl help do shit, right?
---
OP says he wants to be the richest on his server, this wont happen by farming
---
Wubbalubbadubdub
---
To me world quests just feel like a job, you log in knock out the 15 or 20 you've done a million times already finish them then that's all the content available for the day
---
Rejuvenating Gem for healers is BiS until TBC, some may change it for the trinkets of Naxx, but that trinket could be THE trinket for the rest of the game.
---
Wasn't aware Shaman needed 500 keys
---
I'm not buying that that many people are playing healer. Even in Aion where the healers were blatantly overpowered and could kill anyone there were not that many healers.
---
Guess we'll see; I'm pretty excited.
---
&gt;also fucking lol @ claiming Blizzard has "no financial incentive" to stop gold sellers...oh yeah they're just going to let a bunch of chinese make hundreds of thousands of dollars off of their game, yep that's totally gonna happen
---
What? Blizzard is selling the tokens. They are making money off of them themselves. That's what I'm talking about.
---
Chinese gold farmers won't use the token system. There's too much AH cut.
---
You work at Dominos and you're promoting them? Man, when I worked at Pizza Hut I actively promoted our competitors.
---
Still, Papa Johns is where it's at.
---
I'm not debating any of that my dude. I'm only refuting the claim that 1-59 content, as a whole, stays relevant at 60. Sure, for a FRESH 60, you'll be using gear you obtained in the 40s. But a MC/BWL raiding Rogue isn't going to be using 1-59 gear. It becomes irrelevant. 
---
That's all I'm trying to say. Classic WoW isn't some magical paradise where everything you did before 60 "matters". Was it fun? Was it enjoyable? Those are the things that matters. But in 90% of the cases, every piece of gear you obtain will be replaced in level 60 content. It's just how the game works.
---
It won't get you there.  Just do cloth turn ins later on.
---
1660 to would be nice, yes.
---
But saying mine is old is not correct, its pretty fresh i think.
---
It just was designed for different purposes other than gaming
---
So is everyone else and the benefit is infinitesimal unless you're a mana user.
---
Hopefully you're not one of those people that spend several gold on microscopic upgrades from the AH when leveling, because that's just about as retarded. But if you wouldn't do that because the gold is more valuable in that case, you shouldn't take microscopic upgrades from people where the item is a lot better for them because that's a conniving, piss ant thing to do.
---
Again, common courtesy.
---
Me too!
---
I was 16, between sports, school, and friends I had little time to play, now I'm 31 no wife no kids, job with flexible hours.... Live to win!
---
You don’t need to avoid 20 people, just 2. I wish the best of luck to anyone who genuinely believes him if he does announce a server.
---
&gt;Hey guys I’m totally going to X (tehehehe) server
---
I’ll buy their pizza again only if the billing back the classic pan pizza they had. None of this artisanal shit. Best memories of college was getting some dominoes. That’s all I can remember of college....
---
Using your example as a Pre-Bis setup. 
---
After hitting your 9% hit i would primarily focus on crit over str. Especially at that gear level i feel that rage is alot more important then passive damage increase. 
---
Crit chance = Rage chance to some degree. Considering how easy it is to stack AP at that lvl tho, itll be up to you what you think is worth it. 
---
My primary advice would be to focus mainly on crit chance post 9% hit.
---
Yes, everyone else must be wrong, not you. That's clearly how things work.
---
No worries, I remember how long it took me to find all this out. Having to shadow other druids etc. Happy to help. 
---
Yes you need to max tailoring out, which is why you level with it.  You’ll come across the cloth naturally from questing/ mobs. Be sure to have a bank alt to send it to.  Also as long as you create an alt to send all the herbs you collect when leveling too, it should be a breeze once you have the armor pieces made to power level Alchemy.
---
Yeah check the other comment, this is 100% incorrect. Retail and Classic WoW are similar in name only, absolutely nothing else.
---
Retail WoW might as well be a mobile game, Classic is a true hand-crafted MMORPG.
---
Ahh my mistake, didn't realize you were an outside party chiming in.
---
I've spend a hour for more deeper investigation, added support of my keysets to Engine 2 and now may answering you more precisely.
---
1. Device support depends on a code of a particular Device. That's a code, I've described "how to take it from" by Fiddler in my post. For the same device from different region exist be different codes. That's a reason, why it is working for you "out of the box" and for me not, but I've changed it.
---
2. There is an extremely limited amount of configurations: like Standart Keyset, Gaming keyset ( one with the red direction buttons ,) Medal of Honor, Starcraft 2, 4 keysets for WoW (including Cataclysm, which isn't exist in Z-Engine) and some MMO-keyset (no idea what is it). And... that's all. Owners of Fang, Merc etc products may even not trying - wonder won't happen.
---
3. They've sufficiently changed structure of data - from number sequences as a keys (like in Z-Engine) to binary data.
---
4. Fact from article above totally prohibited for me any advance change of data. I'm not able edit configuration as I want, so my custom profile for BC-keyset is not possible to repeat for Engine 2, doesn't matter from UI or other way.
---
So, conclusion: It's not a magic pill or lifehack, but it's interesting fact and may works for a very limited Ideazon owners. Think, at least for keyboard owners from US.
---
For me it's also means - I should support few variants for the same keyset, which I didn't know before it. Need to think about it...
---
Sure
---
Felwood
---
Dwarves cant ride horses!
---
A pony perhaps
---
The 6 intellect is also infinitesimal. If the ring is for my guildmates or friends, of course I'll pass. But if it's just a PUG, I'll be rolling.
---
I’ve played both for too long, and the only thing I think OSRS beats Classic at, hands down, are the quests. The vast majority of Classic quests are kill lists, gather resource item, escort... yada yada. There are a few that feel epic and you can lose yourself in for a while, but only a few.
---
So if I happen to catch ony buff in storm wind before the raid by chance, are you going to mame me click off the buff before raid? Why? How very un-vanilla. 
---
Lets be honest, this is just a thread for you to shill enhance sgamans and hate on world buffs. You already made 2  posts about world buffs and how much you hate them. Noone cared then a d noone does now.
---
Good idea, thank you
---
Agreed.  Those people who actually care about killing bosses will already be in decent guilds and will not join my theoretical pug because they'll be saving their lockout for their guild run.
---
But if they have an alt, or if most guilds aren't raiding that week because it's Christmas or something, I'll be able to clear BWL with them for sure.
---
And yeah, the key to a successful pug is a strict gear check.  This will show you that the player gives a shit to gear out their character properly and likely has some raid experience or at least understands how to play.
---
Honestly, I've been kind of reliving my gaming days from back then without really realizing it. I was playing a lot of Counterstrike and for the past week or so I've been playing Runescape for the first time since 2003/2004.
---
oh its the same retard who made the shaman hand of ragnaros post
---
Yeah qol changes are great, but that's what's awesome about having an active sub - if you want qol... you can play retail.
---
If you want to play a fun game, you can play classic!
---
One of the reasons I'm excited for classic wow is to see thecontent before the Cataclysm revamp which unfortunately replaced - or worse - removed a lot of the amazing quests in the game.
---
So I'm going on Vacation from the 1st to the 7th lol
---
quit playing, prepare for classic
---
Guarantee that happens far less than you're all imagining. It comes off excruciatingly cringe and whenever it's said it's usually awkwardly ignored.
---
As soon as he said "a single battle and a single defense" I thought this is how we ended up with retail.
---
&gt; they should just replace the planned RP servers by RP-PvP ones
---
The guy he replied to specifically stated he wants RP-PvE servers replaced by RP-PvP servers.
---
Haha this guy remembers women shouldn't vote productions
---
You don't understand how healing works...
---
How many hours do you work and sleep?  The 8/8/8 split is pretty standard if you ask me.  If you don't have a kid and only have one job, you basically get to choose what you want to do with just under 56 hours per week.
---
Newcastle here, will be joining the dark side for a change! Will join a PvP server (for World PvP) but will be focusing more on PvE.
---
there are even more ways to get gear than raids. you can get bwl-level gear from quests, grinds and pvp in later stages of the game
---
My mom hasn't cooked for me in 20 years. I cook for myself and my wife in my own house. Something tells me you're still living at home in your 30s though.
---
35 to max it out, that was added later because there were a ton of level 5 alts disenchanting things
---
Nice, PM for link
---
i remember watching this back in the day. i didnt fully understand how much of a joke balance was at the time.
---
the freaking turtle rep.
---
not only are they limited to explorer type minigames - forcing players who have no interest in that type of content to participate in it, they also only show up with 2 or 3 WQ per day (at least they used to)
---
Resto Shaman are great healers. As a healer, you will be desire for both PvP &amp; raiding.
---
Elemental Shaman are great burst DPS in PvP. They have very bad mana sustain issues, though, and aren't desired for DPS in raids. 
---
Enhancement Shaman is very hit or miss in PvP. You can occasionally one shot some one with a nasty triple WF crit, but half the time you'll be staring at ~400 damage white non-crits and waiting on a very long swing timer. And/or having your tits kited off. And you're also not really desired for DPS in raids.
---
Damn you might be right.
---
How about we keep it the way it was?
---
I truly hate Cataclysm and what it did.  Booooooo
---
Go outside and get a tan. That way as you stay indoors for the next 3 months your skin color will return to normal levels come winter time.
---
The other 8? Dunno, probably shower, cook, eat, clean, commute? There's at least 4 hours right there
---
&gt; groups would rather find a real tank
---
and people in hell want ice water.
---
&gt; They had to have been some of the worst DPS in existence.
---
Pull a group, fight it to 50%, run ahead and pull the next one. Meanwhile the tank is doing his best to shepherd entire rooms of mobs, and these DPS pull the *next* group. 
---
I learned that it is, in fact, possible to run out of mana as a priest in a BFA 5-man even while wearing decent blues from the Dungeon Finder loot shower.
---
I thought everyone read it that way.
---
Fortunately the max rank at 49 is rank 9 so getting an epic mount won't be possible. At least in the patch of vanilla we'll be getting. No clue when they put the level based rank caps in place.
---
Post evidence. Bosses will likely hit like wet noodles in Vanilla as private servers use overtuned versions. You also have better prebis than private with 1.12 items. We dont know for sure, but evidence indicates healing will use even less mana in Classic.
---
I just got the new Spider-Man game, but haven't had the chance to play it yet. Likely tonight. Hoping I can play it and get enough satisfaction out of it before launch.
---
no but agil/spirit is by far the best PvE leveling gear.
---
agil/stam if you PvP, all the way :).
---
A retail player LUL poor lad
---
&gt;Not sure what you're talking about here, considering they are called "Normal", "PvP", and "RP".
---
I understand the point you're trying to make, but this is you being pedantic.
---
Warrior if you want to tank/dps
---
Shaman if you want to heal/meme
---
If it was changed during vanilla then i'd expect they would keep it changed where both factions can do the quests.
---
Main healer &gt; dps &gt; off spec healer &gt; off spec dps
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Yep, and EU servers could have just organized their own cultural guilds and events via something like discord right
---
I only played Vanilla BC and Pservers but subbed for beta. Those downvotes are the reason layering exist. The hype is so insane, when people actually try, they will be dissapointed. I love this game but I'm sad that servers will die out after only a couple weeks. Let's be real there's a huge lack of content beside the grind. This sub has so many threads about how Vanilla is the best game that was ever designed and how they will get to 60 in two weeks. It's 150-200 hours. It's 3 battlegrounds. It's raids about gear check and resist farming. I like to grind and relax at my age. I also liked the new game, how it's different in some way and my guess it's designed to please the new generation. It's also basically the same game, if you like to play a class in the new game you will like the same class in Vanilla.
---
Thank you, this was straight to the point and confirms my suspicions
---
Teldrassil or Ashenvale
---
Hand Banana

Most high end raiding guilds are going to require you to have them for raids. The one that does int does not stack with mage int though. The strength one doesn't stack with elixir of giants etc. If one consume has the same stats as another they most likely don't stack. Taladril's list of consumeables outlines that pretty well.
---
There really is no "priority" on dungeon loot. If you want it and can use it, you deserve to roll.
---
The answer lies in the simplicity of the human nature and the motivation in relation to the reward structure
---
or you could also call it 'the carrot on the stick'
---
Classic has you slowly grinding. A) At your own pace - so if you have a free weekend/evening - you can go ham for hours on end. And B) you know exactly what you are working towards with a 100% guaranteed reward that (in case of items/enchants/rep) is going to be relevant for the actual power level of your character for months to come due the sparsity of powerful loot.
---
BFA grinding is a A) time gated for you to log in once per day for a short time period. While it tries to keep you entertained by scattering random slot machine rewards along the way the goal is struggling to maintain its charm due to the seasonal / phase based content structure. In case of rep rewards the time gated progression often results in them being inferior or doomed to be outdated within a couple of weeks (if not days with the m+ reward system) after you've finally earned them (if the rewards aren't already dated by the time you can reach your goal - MoP rep rewards were a prime example for that. Grind the rep for months and get items that were average at best -  2 months ago - by the time you finish)

How would you rate the classes from chillest to least chill?

Most deff, you can always hit me up if you have questions.

thank you too! :)

Lol, implying that those hunters were doing it on purpose and weren't just noobs.
---
I would also like to know the server and join a guild. I'm ready!
---
For the Horde!
---
luckily I do not like the quests in osrs
---
It's enough for a level 20 frostbolt with mana left over. That could be the difference between living and dying. It's a big deal.
---
Yeah the question is if they decide to leave it where both can do it or not. I'd imagine they'd leave it where both can. Why move a NPC and quest line so late in the game?
---
this is some savant tier autism min/maxing
---
upvoted
---
Advertising your guild as "mature" is like advertising your burgers as "100% beef".  Well I should hope so considering it's a hamburger, and I should hope so considering we know 85% of this game's pop is going to be 30 year olds coming back after 13 years.  I wouldn't want to be in an immature guild with 60 adults.  That sounds awful.
---
this is the correct answer
---
World of Warcraft is a 15 year study in degrading game design. The team has lost its core gameplay design leaders and it’s heartbreaking because the artists are phenomenal. It’s the prettiest turd.
---
Yes, It's running the same client.
---
Never forget: People back in Vanilla wore full tier sets and beat content, completely unaware of how bad tier sets mostly are.
---
Would love to see the data - 30-40 with bis geared 30s don't really provide great data from 10-60.
---
&gt;Stick to your retail game, snowflake.
---
knee jerk reaction baseless assumption insults are the best (also no, i don't play "retail")
---
Haha bro I challenge you to watch all of one piece  by release. That'll keep you occupied ;)
---
The thing that bothered me was I gave BFA a chance about a month ago, and because of the way gearing is set up, I'm left playing catch up with other people's alts the whole time. 
---
Coming in late to the expansion there's almost no way to max out as they release new ilevel caps so fast. The only way is to pay for a carry or stay stuck with alts doing nazjatar/mechagon BS and lower tier mythics. 
---
It's even to the point where a majority of mythic groups require you to have an ilevel higher than the gear that even drops there
---
Sigh...it's not "cringe", it's called "communication" in a group example where the hunter keeps breaking CC. You know, when you actually talk to your party if you don't have voice comms.
---
I guess that's something only 80's kids will remember.
---
Corporate America has more trust in classic's success than blizzard does.
---
As someone who works at a Dominos, it's actually targeted as a back-to-school special and is for the beginning of football season. But it's a nice thought :3
---
Yessss there is. Just because you're playing with someone more often than others doesn't mean you can just treat them like a fucking NPC. They're doing the fun instance with you, mutually gaining XP with you, and most people assume others won't needlessly jack loot that they can't even arguably use just for the vendor money, meaning they're also facilitating you getting possible loot that they won't roll on using their own time and energy. There absolutely fucking is a demand for courtesy.
---
&gt;6 intellect isn't even one level 18 Fireball.
---
kek you mentioned one of the classes that can't use the agility, even though I named out the four that can, and has particularly high mana costs. 6 intellect is more than enough for a spell for most classes at that level. It'll also give a tiny ass amount of crit like that agil will for a warrior.
---
I'm gonna have to cut this one off, that's just too much conniving bullshit for one conversation.
---
No bitterness, but it's the truth all the same. I'm going to let them do their thing while I do mine.
---
Shaman is awesome at 60. Resto is the highest demanded healer (For totems, not output), Ele is a monster in PvP, and there’s just tons of class flavor. Obviously the biggest downside being that only one spec is really accepted in raids unless you want to be an auto attacking, totem dropping Nightfall machine. 
---
Their Burst in Ele is some of the highest in the game, and in enhance Windfury can be hilarious (But inconsistent. And they’re pretty interesting in PvP too since you’re generally healing on top of bursting, dropping totems, etc.
---
I will say their leveling is extremely boring for most of the way. They’re really good from 4-10, and then you’re basically just auto attacking to be conservative with mana. Optimal setup is typical Dagger with flametongue and a shield, unless an exceptionally better weapon of any type drops. Windfury is fun but not great for leveling considering the potential overkill is considered a waste
---
In general you’re considered the worst dungeon healer while leveling due to huge mana issues, but it’s usually still acceptable. You could Enhance tank until the 50s if your healer wanted to put up with it, but they’re horrible with mana as a tank so the groups are generally rather slow
---
I wish I could compare them to warriors better, but I know more about shaman than warrior. I will say IMO Warriors are terrible while leveling, and even in dungeons. They’re so gear dependent, and they bring little to the table compared to other classes. It might just be my bias opinion but I think Druid tanks are MUCH better until mid 40s when Warriors are in mainly plate and have some more fleshed our talents, and id still prefer a Druid tank due to higher threat / can pre-hot pulls to put a lot less stress on their healer and increase their own threat at the same time. 
---
The warrior part take with a grain of salt, I could have just grouped with bad warriors, but the Shaman advice I have a better idea about in general
---
Blasted Lands
---
You mean like claiming multiboxers are "complete losers" and people that twink are "pathetic".
---
You dumb dumbs can't even see your fallacies.
---
I mean, yeah, I fully agree this is World of WARcraft, and we aren't supposed to be friendly with the opposing faction, but that isn't being toxic. That isn't even remotely being toxic. Killing them and spitting on them is the game of the game. That's how it's played.
---
If there was a pvp server named STV, STV would be a war zone 24/7.

The rest of  us Left thatt shit behind...

There is the link to the icon https://worldofwarcraft.akamaized.net/static/components/GameIcon/GameIcon-class-druid-vector.png but you will have to resize it

Where are you guys finding all of this guild recruitment? I would love to have a guild before the game launches, but IDK where to look.

I've leveled a handful of hunters to 60 on vanilla servers, but when I finally logged back into my first hunter on a Blizzard server, I just about died of a broken heart.
---
Still might be a good tool even if it's just realm only. Easy way to manage the interest and invites.
---
I am putting together a small Discord for that specific thing. I have a small audience on YouTube and will be streaming Classic, so the Discord will be there for viewer dungeon runs and group leveling. It’s not up yet as I am not home from this deployment, but when I do get home it’s something I want to have up and running.
---
49 has always been the twink bracket for me. It's as close as you can get to 60 without the constant gear grind. Once I finish my 49 twink, he's done. And no matter what new dungeons are released he'll always be sitting there, ready to PVP even if I take a few weeks off from the game. 
---
It does take longer to level and gear a 49 than say a 19 or 29, but the higher skill cap, wider range of viable specs, and interesting game play make it worth it to me.
---
I can't wait for classic phase 3.
---
I didn’t think about that! I need to bring this up with my group! Thanks!
---
No there isn't. Besides, anyone that gets this upset over a level 17 ring deserves no courtesy at all.

It is a shady practice and if you don’t think so you may be brainwashed by capitalism. That money shouldn’t be there. I shouldn’t pay more in taxes than billionaires percentage wise and shit. This is infuriating and trying to say it’s normal cuz it’s a standard practice is why the poor will stay poor .
---
&gt;I'm still saying it's basically the same game with easier leveling but harder and end-game. I don't like the hype and the retail bashing because I have a feeling players will abandon once they realize Vanilla is about grinding. I want my server to be active.
---
I'm on this forum because I can't wait for the game. I just want the hype to be real for new players so most won't be dissapointed. OP said he'd like to know what WoW is about. Retail is still basically the same game when I logged. I genuinely believed this forum until I tried. I was surprised how they kept most of the abilities, dungeons, mechanics etc...   
---
Someone want to try biking for the first time, the little wheels on the back still gives you an idea of what biking is about.
---
Dont go! WoW needs you
---
Like I said, you deserve no courtesy at all. I'd roll on the ring even if I owned it just to spite you.
---
Sure, but the difference between 80% and 50% is massive. On a warrior I'd actually prioritize spirit over strength, if the armor class is appropriate, but on a rogue i'd take agi.
---
I remember that. Could tweet a pizza emoji and get pizza delivered too. 
---
/pizza in Everquest was for Pizza Hut
---
Kay, bud. Not everything has to do with the norm.
---
Just because it's a minority, doesn't disclude their existance.

That happened even when I played raided with a guild in WoD. Ever after 10 (now 15) years, people still dont know not to stand in the fire.
---
&gt; Also, watch make love not warcraft
---
yeah you're single aren't you
---
Druid life!
---
Just know I plan an alt... probably need to be a bit more meta xD
---
Esfand is a much higher quality person imo if you like watching WoW Classic.
---
Feral Druid existed too, you’re killing yourself out here my dude.
---
Yeah, it always bothered me too. I graduated from college in 2006 and now the university is using clickers for students to check in on the roll electronically. It's bullshit. You're an adult. If you want to waste your money, it's your business. Now, it *kind* of sort of makes sense if you're on scholarship or are receiving federal aid, but still.
---
Nice pic but terrible font.
---
From private servers, I know to stay far away from Redridge Mtns
---
That's the point OP was making.
---
We can't.  The pirated server community has no integrity.
---
Thank you this is super helpful! Do you think the quests from 40-60 would make much of an impact on Stormwind?
---
I will definitely check out your route. At least it will get me somewhat closer to Exalted.

My usual sleeping schedule is somewhere between 6-8 hours. I'm used to pushingdeadlines at work, which sometimes leads to 4-6 hours of sleep. Nothing new for me, but I totally agree with you that one should aim for \~8 hours daily.
---
That was only a thing in one single expansion and not even the whole expansion as by the time patch 3.3 came out blizzard was clearly buffing blood tank to push it on its way to being the tank spec
---
I am so pretty sure this changed in a later expansion (maybe TBC). I remember leveling up in BGs by killing players that gave me honor points (and XP obviously)
---
Couldn't hurt I suppose!
---
WoW is what made me quit rs back in the day.
---
Play a rogue, tell everyone you haven’t leveled lock picking, after the dungeons over and every one hearthstone out, loot all the chests.
---
Would genuinely be curious to know the rationale behind the people who downvoted me, Tauren leeway aside.
---
This has nothing to do with protecting IP and 100% blizzard seeing a market thry can profit from.
---
Rather see Esfand LOL
---
"Too hand-holdy and flashy" is what everyones problem with WoW has been for 10 bloody years.
---
Now is definitely the best time to play, you'll love it. Even if you play solo you'll quickly find other players you have to help and keep in touch with.

Welcome to the world... ^^^of ^^^warcraft

Blood dk??? Literally no tank can do what blood dk does when the spec has even average tuning compared to other tanks
---
when's he going to jail?
---
Least excited for the graphics, models, the ones in retail are beautiful and would not take away from the classic experience for me, not sure why people are excited to have the immersive 2004 minecraft feel, but to each their own. Most excited for the unique flavor of each class, I kind of like that when your a mage only you can zip around the world while every other class has to suffer, or that warriors on horde are literally the only plate wearers, etc. Either way I am excited just to fart around in my old sandbox, take the good with the bad and actually talk to people again in game.
---
Don't post this trash here
---
Retail bad
---
All of the bugs that influenced larger gameplay in Vanilla are being purposefully kept in in Classic.
---
But again, I'm not denying any of that. 
---
Regardless, people act like in Retail there's nothing to do either. Even if it's not your cup of tea, there's still plenty of content to do in the old world. Pets, Mounts, Tmog farming, exotic toys/consumables. People act like none of that exists for whatever reason. Content is still content, regardless of if you like it or not.
---
Questing in vanilla was far more satisfying than raiding at level 60 and hunting down each bis. Classic will be much the same.
---
 20 ap = 1% crit  /  15 ap = 1% hit /  20 agi = %1 crit  /  10 str = 1% crit
---
Hope this helps.
---
I had engineered a fantastic solution back in the day. I had a fan with a pen cello taped to the side of it that used to hit my space bar on every rotation. It was glorious.

---
I work in offshore finance/banking. I've seen clients with as little.as 100k total revenue do their taxes offshore.
---
At this point, in a global economy, anybody not doing it is massively behind and will not be able to compete.
---
Also, almost every bank all over the globe trades offshore and is constantly moving their assets offshore and redistributing on a daily basis. The very money you bank into your account from your pay cheque is making money right now in an offshore, untaxable trust.
---
Now we're looping back around to my original post.
---
Blizzard making all those changes got us to where Retail is currently. Every class does roughly the same dps, has the same skills, and can it only matters if you're a healer/ranged/caster/melee/tank.
---
I miss classes being important.
---
How so?
---
Im sorry but I still have to disagree. Leveling on retail feels just way too different compared to vanilla. But we all have different opinions so im not taking away yours. If you want the hype to be real for new players, you should probably send them to pserver. Leveling there is way closer to classic than retail

LOL What?!

Trying to ruin hunter reputation right off the bat I see.
---
Can i get link, confirming it?
---
Since ive only seen info that requirements are gonna be around same as for vanilla

&gt;were less important than twitch reflexes.
---
no raid mechanic in wow requires fast reflexes
---
The answer to gold selling sites.
---
ya I’m sick of this minmaxers ruining my rp pizza chill
---
Me neither. But that is because my desktop crashed a few days ago.
---
well it was about dat time.
---
I'm not even clicking the link. He's a garbage player who thinks he's amazing.
---
lel thanks for letting me know that you're mad af for being wrong and terrible at arguing.
---
Fuckin mage fireballs, get out of here with that weak ass shit.
---
Any mana user should be rolling on it, other than Hunter. It's a really good ring for a lot of classes.
---
Oh lol
---
I mean, maybe for you. While I enjoy the 1-60 process and will again, I'm playing this game to raid. That's where my enjoyment comes.
---
too bad then because you would have liked it since its a cringe clip
---
You mean do something other than grind rank 14? Fucking disgraceful
---
So if I am a PUG healer. 1 of 8 healers in the raid.
---
A healing piece drops and I am the only PUG in the raid, I get a 1/40 chance of getting that loot? or a 1/20 if there's a second PUG (lets say a rogue) with me?
---
I remember that, it had something to do with being sheeped off flying mount 🤣
---
I'm excited to see people play and enjoy the game without ever hitting max level.
---
I'm taking a few days off and living mostly like I already do because I take decent care of myself and don't intend to play 16+ hours a day.
---
I'll be happy to have a level 60 within the first month and I'm playing with a group of four friends who I don't want to completely out-level. 
---
Not trying to be a 1-2 weeker like some people.
---
Your current system will play classic 30-60fps, but you said that's not good enough for you.  You want no compromises.  So, in respect for gaming, it's old and out dated.
---
I have an i3 8th gen, integrated 620 UHD graphics, it will play classic around 60fps and I'm fine with that.  I'll take dips as long as it's above 30, which means dropping settings to keep frames up.
---
Because it's been 15 years. Like how half-life was the best FPS or Warcraft 1 was the best RTS. The best MMO was everquest.  
---
I'll be honest I don't know enough about the new game to give you a definitive awnser but one thing I'm sure of, the game was extremely similar when I tried it. Player still make guilds. Dungeons are still 5 players, you still need a tank and a healer. I still had a frostbolt and it still slowed the mob. Skyrim online is a different game.
---
Duel area. Duels are not helpful to a class that kites. Hunters are much better when they are in the open world or in BGs. Also, they have a very high skill ceiling compared to most other classes.
---
Yeah but that's why it feels different. In Vanilla, you can go back to do a quest get a unique item that could actually be useful in PvP at max level. In Retail, you're going back for a cosmetic/pet/luxury item, because items below level cap aren't allowed to be useful anymore. It's the same if you're intentionally viewing it at a surface level (going back to do old content), but the way it actually affects the game is totally different. Even if these are minor things and they can totally be ignored while leveling, they add a certain cohesive charm to the game that is very hard to capture in a post-expansion pack state. And it's not that that change is necessarily even bad, it's just that it's different, because I get why the cohesiveness factor becomes a way bigger beast when you're juggling multiple expansion packs.
---
Press escape and click on the button that says keybinds.
---
Beta dual was not even level 60. You are missing ranks and spells.
---
As nice as it would be, not going to happen.  Raid buffs were in vanilla and were used.  If people want a "challenge" then don't do raids with world buffs.  The rest of the people are going to min/max the shit out of the game to defeat the content, which means world buffs and consumables.
---
I guess it really depends on how much work you intend to put in to this guild and how much experience you have in coordinating raids and PvP.
---
Personally? Being entirely on your own? I'd say it's not ideal. Having friends to help you makes all the difference but doing it on your own from scratch means you start from ground zero with no support.
---
If I were you, I'd just be looking to join an established group or find a group as I was leveling. But, at the end of the day, if leading a guild is what you want to do, go for it.
---
None of this was at max level, and the characters were geared out of their mind for level 30 and 40. I wouldn’t base your choices off of those tournaments.
---
I’d love it if someone could find a source backing this up. Tbh I don’t even know where the 6 month figure came from for BGs.
---
So hunters are not good in duels then?
---
I had to do all of my business in freaking DARNASSUS
---
Hunters were insane in wpvp and wsg in beta. However they had some pretty big bugs, which should be fixed, that were associated with traps and pets. It's also not a good indicator for how things will actually be. People (including me) farmed some really nutty gear on beta once they capped. And iirc hunters didn't have as many insane items to get at 30 and 40 compared to others.
---
So you already pretty much force warriors and priests to go in their defensive specs and then also bitch about that they roll on the dps gear? If i was in a party as a priest then I roll on everything from healing gear to dps gear, don't like then find someone else who gonna heal.  
---
Playing as a tank or healer is already a pain in classic because it cost us a fortune to spec each time so don't come with that bullshit, if I can equip it and it is an upgrade for main of farm spec I roll.
---
Yes but hunters are supposed to be the best leveling class and really high power before gear, so it even makes sense for hunter to win, but the opposite happened.
---
Ya, thats why there isnt one. But its a must, right?
---
For me, Saturday and Sunday 1000-1400

He stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from California taxpayers by submitting invoices for work he never did, tried to steal almost a million more, got called out and banned by the county government, tried to sue them for being racist, got told to STFU by the judge, and is now millions of dollars in debt.

No, that's why they lost.

---
Everything is hard when people don't know what they are doing.
---
Oh my word that sounds AWFUL. I guess you should just wait 6 months before playing then, if you're just gonna be a humongous crybaby about it.
---
I really think you need to be prepared to "no life" in order to lead a successful guild. Guilds are like small babies,  they require constant supervision to keep them alive and stop them from doing dumb Shit.
---
Is this reflective of the beta, which I believe runs on the legion (I think the real servers will run on bfa) client. I know the old school client was very easy on different systems. I am just learning about different systems and requirements so i'm not sure the difference in processing it takes to run the different clients.
---
I have Team Classic+ since day 1 ;)
---
Thats where we'll find all the stoners! :D
---
During leveling dps loot is MS for everyone. Good luck getting tanks and healers if you won't let them roll on gear they need (keyword here) for leveling.
---
Ironically I read this comment sitting a California court house for jury duty. 
---
Was unaware of this, thanks for letting me know. What a scumbag.
---
Seems like all those sites went away with LFR sadly. Might take a crack at remaking one this weekend.
---
SS vs TM started because it's a natural BG with towns and gys nearly evenly spaced and from lvl 60s being called in to deal with all of the low level ganking. It will be a hotspot for twinks

You're not cheating using what the game makes available.  And as much as you would think, that won't kill the game.  You doing BWL with MC gear, is that cheating too?  Should you just do content naked?  
---
I was in the top vanilla raiding guild on my server, we were doing consumes and raid buffs, but the server wasn't dead.  Far from it.  Had a bunch of guilds still trying out all the rest of the content and they were partial clearing Naxx while we were full clearing it.
---
I get where people also want a "vanilla" raid with no buffs.  I had the same thing when I was raiding vanilla where someone would pad the DPS charts all hopped up on consumables while I was not using consumables.  But that's a direct comparison in a raid, but still apples and oranges.  Now, if you beat a guy consumed up in DPS while you weren't, now you can flex.  But if you lose to someone on consumes, just blame consumes and you still don't feel bad.
---
He had two accounts one one of the opposite faction he used as a spy and to troll if I remember correctly.
---
This but unironically.
---
Yeah, it sure is nice that it is a package deal. Im not sure I will play retail as i enjoy the grind and the long runs to instances and the things that the QoL improvements "fixed". But still nice to have the options.
---
I'm familiar with the list it gives but it's jargon to me (ugh). If I want Mind Blast on F, how would I do that? Do I put mind blast in my 9 slot and bind 9 and F together? Or is there another way to where Only F will cast MB and I can have something else as 9? Ya feel?
---
Please f2p games count everyone that has ever made an account.    Its free.  People make multiple, and sometimes dozens of accounts.  You also have the Asians there.
---
6 months we will be lucky to have 50k in na and 50k in Europe.
---
Well, you want to be looking ahead. The hunter will keep that dagger for months, while the rogue can replace it every MC. The total dps gain over the weeks will probably be higher if the hunter gets it, attendance etc being equal.
---
You know nothing Jon Sn... OHHH!
---
They most likely won't.
---
Gnome.
---
&gt; First off, it helps the meme specs and hunters that don't scale as well. 
---
Also wanted to comment.  Raid buffs help make these guys relevant.  If they don't consume, they miss out on a lot of bonuses that synergize with their builds.  Ret all of a sudden isn't going to be on par with the melee in a non-consume and non-raid buff enviornment.  They're still going to be worse and for them to get on par... surprise... they need to consume and world buff.
---
you seem to be confusing pvp and PVE
---
of course they are the best lvling class but thats got nothing to do with pvp lol
---
Eh, I don't think so. The Orcs don't shy away from battle, sure, but these Orcs didn't have the same mindset as the ones we saw in WCI and II. 
---
The orcs are traditionally shamanistic and have close ties to nature and the elements and the NElves are the same way, common ground could have most definitely been met there had the NElves not jumped the gun, but that's just IMO.
---
But then you'd have to eat cardboard tasting pizza? Gross. Good deal if you can't make your own better tasting pizza I guess though.
---
Please don't listen to OP, he has no idea what he's talking about..
---
This isn't true at 29. Mage FC is better than druid at this bracket.
---
As a warrior that is really only interested in tanking, this is an interesting thought. I leveled a holy priest alt this way back in late vanilla/BC. It was not fast. But that was an alt, played occasionally. Applied to a main, tanking so that role would always be filled, I wonder what kind of pace it would give.
---
Two of the largest RP servers, Wyrmrest Accord and... well... Moon Guard, were RP-PvE servers.
---
Okay so when are hunters good in duels then?
---
Yeah, for sure I recognize I need to find a trusted right hand man as soon as I can. I'll have plenty of free time for the first 5 or 6 months when classic releases so I have time for that. When I say I'm not willing to no life I'm literally just referring to the daily 16+ hour grinds for 3 weeks straight that high warlord would entail.
---
Shaman are incredible healers in raids and they’re incredible in PvP. No matter what you choose you’ll do well and have fun.
---
I’m thinking about starting up an old PS1 or PS2 rpg for some good gameplay and story, maybe xenogears, suikoden or one of the final fantasy games of that era.  If we are gonna have classic, let us do some classic beforehand too.
---
Most players are going to level up in a DPS spec. The expectation that your healer/tank needs gear for leveling should be understood by most. On the other hand, players filling the role of DPS during the dungeon shouldn't be rolling against the players actually tanking/healing the dungeon.
---
How am I forcing warriors and priests to tank / heal?  You totally don't have to do that, and if you play a DPS role with these classes then you have the "common social expectation to roll" on DPS gear like I talk about.
---
If you're a tank / healer, you totally can roll on offspec items, that's exactly what I'm saying.  The difference is that you have no etiquette, and that's what this post is all about.  I recommend you read it a couple more times and you'd learn something!
---
It's pretty trivial if you understand 'people-management'.
---
Given what we can glimpse about your mindset from your post though I (personally) would find it very unlikely that you would manage to succeed in forming a guild on your own. If you formed a PvP focused guild where 'gearing in raids' was simply a means to an end, and people understood that (so raiding was a pseudo/substitute R14 grind with a bit more certainty and none of the demanding hours/competition) you'd normally get a lot of hopeful recruits. The problem is the indifference to the honor-mechanics (dishonorable kills in particular), even if you could grab a bunch of like minded PvP-fanatics you'd also need a subset who wouldn't feel screwed if you managed to tag them into a dishonorable kill (and that's an extremely small subset of players).
---
I'm sorry but did you even try looking? You can google say shaman classic wow discord and it will come up.
---
You can assign different keys to specific bars, so yeah if you have mind blast on the main bar at 9 then you can edit it to be f that activates it instead and then have 9 on your keyboard assigned to another bar.
---
It for sure has its perks. I just cannot see me sinking days of /played  into it, which is what i would expect with playing WoW. WoW should be, in my eyes, a hobby that i can play continuously for years to come, if i chose to. BFA just doesn't seem to have the structure to keep me engaged in it enough to do so.
---
Expensive at lvl 10, but chump change at level 50.
---
Playstyle wise I'd probably say paladin is the chillest but flavour wise druid is the most chill. Tauren druid is mega chill
---
yea but duels are just duels, Hunters exel where the real pvp is, wpvp and premades.
---
Don't be a bigot! They're refugees fleeing a wartorn world and trying to build a life for themselves. There should be exactly zero vetting as they enter.
---
And don't you DARE bring up the crime statistics!
---
Yeah I just don't care anymore and throw in an application anyway. They can then evaluate whether I fit for the role or not.
---
It only states that it’s opening to reserve your name before release. No mention of end date, so it’s not really too clear if it’s limited time or not. We can only assume lack of a timeframe means until launch.
---
Eh, if dueling is his priority that's up to him
---
YES HOLY SHIT ORDERING PIZZA EVERY DAYYYY
---
oh ok
---
imagine writing an entire comment when you could just think to yourself "whatever" and move on with your life.
---
The Chronicles (all three volumes currently published) are the ultimate source for WoW lore. You can find pdfs easily enough online.
---
RP in world of warcraft is never more than flexing by slowly walking around, sometimes with a squad. yawn.
---
Unpopular opinion here, but I think one of the biggest problems throughout the life of WoW is that there are just too many guilds, so the population gets diluted among the high number of likely-to-fail guilds.
---
It really depends.  A warrior tank in a dungeon that is currently using a shield but has a shitty offhand for leveling might roll against a rogue for instance.  The rogue needs that offhand for any situation, they don't have a dungeon set and a leveling set, so IMO they have 100% fair claim to need rolling for the item.  The tank does not have such a clear claim.  If they specifically wanted the offhand drop from a dungeon, then they should make that clear to the group before entering, or participate as a DPS with their shitty offhand from the start. 
---
Reserving / even anticipating item drops is a lot to ask from most players, so it really boils down to this:  "am I going to piss off that rogue if I roll need on it too?"  That is the question that doesn't have a black and white answer, and exactly what I try to explain in the first scenario.  IMO, there is a time and place for that warrior to roll, but it's important to have good justification if you don't want negative backlash from other players (something that *is* important in classic that a lot of people have apparently forgotten).
---
I definitely think level and significance of the upgrade play the biggest role here.
---
Warrior is gonna be a tank or dps and be hard to level up. They are very, very tedious levelers. Nobody (except maybe Paladins) are slower.
---
Shaman will be a healer no matter what you do, but the leveling process is much nicer.
---
Knowing Blizzards humor, STV would be a pve server just to troll people.
---
Go for it then man. Nothing stopping you!
---
Fuck em. Businesses, and corporate entities in particular benefit disproportionately from the infrastructure and laws designed for the preservation of property rights that taxation brings.
---
They should pay a disproportionately large chunk of the tax--especially as they profit. The only thing I sell for a profit is my labor, and that has payroll tax.
---
If the laws are such that squirreling away taxable income is incentivized...they should be changed.
---
Yes, why not. But that ring was always kinda weird. Basically anyone rolls on it because its a Ring at Lowlevel.
---
Toxic as in promoting being offensive and seeking offensive people. 
---
Looking through your comment history though...
---
&gt; Players with an active subscription or game time on their World of Warcraft account will be able to create up to three characters per WoW account and have the name(s) reserved before WoW Classic releases worldwide on Monday, August 26 at 3:00 p.m. PDT.
---
It would be very stupid to assume name reservation will close before launch given this language.
---
Here you have some Audiobooks from Youtube;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIWfljtHESM&amp;list=PLVruLAFtQW3xIFmLGHJ3lWvmxEQ7hsC-x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIWfljtHESM&amp;list=PLVruLAFtQW3xIFmLGHJ3lWvmxEQ7hsC-x)

Ahhh unfortunately I will be a priest.

At launch it's just one server called "do you not have phones" and it just never connects. The cruelest prank in the world and it explains the lack of marketing dollars.

Human all day, pop perception to get the jump on the other rogue

Shaman not close

Is it just off of the pizza or the entire order? Like can I get some cinnasticks half off?!!?

It depends on how much of each you have, the more crit you have the more ap is worth the more ap you have the more crit is worth.

Don't get me wrong. I'm really open to any kind of meme, but they should meet some level of quality and the thex meme was always really really shitty.
---
No, that’s why they lost.
---
Just so everyone knows, this guy is a massive TipsOut fan. He never stops talking about him and defends everything he does, including the fraud he was convicted of. I certainly wouldn't want to be in a guild with someone like that.
---
In 1v1 fights, they're really good. In a declared duel which forces players into a smaller arena, they're not nearly as strong as they are in the open world.

Don't remember where exactly. It might have been on classicast, but it was Kevin Jordan who said this.

That's soooo raycis. We don't need this MAGA (Make Azeroth Great Again) rhetoric!

When those orcs butcher an entire village it'll be on YOUR HEAD! FOR SAYING THINGS!
---
well yeah they are if they dont listen to the group and stop doing dumb shit. then its on purpose. either by being a noob or a troll. doesnt matter. recall pet or get kicked.
---
I was assuming BiS wands. It might just be personal preference. Don‘t think you‘ll lose too much time either way.

Hunters are incredible at PvP. Duels are a small subset of it.

Oh I agree
---
I understand all of what you're saying; I played Vanilla back in the day and loved every minute of it. 
---
The original comment merely stated that in Vanilla, leveling content (1-59) stayed relevant after hitting 60. In terms of gearing up, that's completely false. If we're talking fun and quirky little things, well, Retail still has the same.
---
What *is* different is that leveling in Vanilla is a journey. You learn the ins and outs of your character and experience a lot of stuff. You can rush or take your time, neither is right or wrong. All you said is a part of the leveling *experience* and I fully agree that it's an amazing one.
---
Buuuuuut, 60 is the true end-game and 90% of the gear you earn will be replaced. The fun stuff is still there to get and the world will still be full of players though. :)
---
You'd have a 1/8 chance.
---
You, 3 healers (Guild A), 4 healers (Guild B).  
---
/roll 1-8  
---
1: You get it.  
---
2-4: Guild A  
---
5-8: Guild B

Sure it's fine for leveling, you're gonna replace it soon anyway.

This is weird. I had a friend of mine who were a member of your guild and he also went to one of your famous BBQ gatherings. Small world.

I know that it's not going to be vanilla *exactly* (just as OSRS isn't RS2), but how will it be *nothing* like vanilla? That doesn't make any sense.
---
Before weapon normalization for hunters.  Both the xbow of smiting, and its almost equivalent, level 32 green with 3.4 attack speed.  Brutal times for everyone in AV.

lol, you make it seem like i posted something super cruel wtf.
---
You can put mind blast in the 9 slot, then go to the keybinds menu, and change the binding for that ActionBarSlot from 9 to F. The spell you have placed in that actionbar slot [Mind Blast] will work by pressing [F] now. Keybindings can have up to 2 buttons. For example to run forward you can Press either W or the Up arrowkey. You could set it up so both [9] and [F] cast [Mind Blast] or you could make it so [F] replaces [9] and you could assign [9] to another actionbarslot.  
---
You can change any ActionBarSlot to any Keybinding you want. You can also use modifiers and have 1-6, shift+1-6, ctrl+1-6, alt+1-6, qerfzxcvt, shift+qerfzxcvt, ctrl+qerfzxcvt, alt+qerfzxcvt, for example

&gt; In retail you can ding from 1 to max lvl in 10 hours.

Is this current information based on your actual play experience?

Or are you repeating something you heard?

Its also a life hack to murder your wife--if you dont get caught. Its also totally legal--if you can afford a defense team to spin the truth to such a degree the jury cant convict. 
---
Does that make it right? No.
---
Is it true that entities and avoid taxes by offshoring money? Absolutely. Given that it exists and isnt illegal, should profit motivated entities pursue this? Absolutely. Should every civic minded individual and lobbying entity work to correct these loopholes that serve to weaken the bedrock of democratic industrialized capitalism known as taxation?
---
That is quite apparent just from reading his posts, but thank you for the reassurance.
---
It's like reading a job application - they're speaking in another language that requires a bit of translation to get to the truth. I think some of these guilds are more casual than they let on with such schedules. Some for example have a number of raid nights per month you can miss no problem, and have extra members on the roster to fill in for people who can't make it. Some also have modified their loot systems to work for their guild so people do get loot. Some allow more casual players to raid on a lesser schedule when possible, or are going to start letting casuals raid with the guild after the main roster reaches a certain point, etc.
---
I would say if there's a guild you like, then reach out and ask questions. Because the guild advertisements are often incomplete or misleading - and I think some do it intentionally to ensure they get players who are serious about sticking with Classic and sticking with the guild and weed out others that would be a waste of time to recruit.

"Strength and whatever I deem justifiable on a whim at the time without any code, rhyme, or reason."

Cringe. It's so obvious he was showing that picture on purpose. I can't figure out why do since he's not ripped.

Great idea actually! I've already finished the game 4 times haha, but it never gets old. So pumped for Part 2!
---
Is there a particular race or faction you're interested to know the history of?

10-4
---
It's also important to keep in mind that people following and participating in this sub are higher than average information players, and _likely_ represent a small fraction of the total player base come launch. 
---
And yeah, I made my fortune in retail off of lazy people. There are always opportunities.

What??? Haha. That’s insane.

That’s a sign that HR doesn’t talk to the people actually doing the work or the hiring manager is a moron.

Hunter's suck in duels

About $20 should get you both on bnet. If you remember the basic plot of wc2 you'll have all the intro you need to understand/enjoy wc3 and WC3 will let you understand where all the factions stand and the state of the world at the beginning of WoW. Obviously you can get more indepth with books/internet reading if you want.

Trying to form a guild before launch is going to be a trainwreck 90% of the time.  Roll with friends on a server and see how guild dynamics play out.
---
Dude, I can speak spanish at least this time and communicate.
---
We had a chinese gold farmer that raided MC with us.  I had to try and tell him what to do.  That shit was hard.  Got full GS though.
---
Yeah I know just the value of that is just not justifiable, imo. It's not even guaranteed to do anything considering what weapon they're using and if they end up replacing it any time soon after.
---
Here's a raid log from some random player than ran Naxx today on the Lightbringer private server. 56% of his damage from was auto attacks. I think rogues in vanilla work by mainly maintaining slice and dice during boss fights so they get an unusually high amount of melee auto attack damage but they still have to actively be doing things to get there. The top damage warrior in that raid was at 43% auto attack damage, for comparison.

Nothing an intermediary wouldn't solve. The ability to trade gold for game time exists. Now we're talking about thousand year old problems with trading that have multitudes of solutions.
---
I originally played Runescape when it first came out in 2001, then I swapped to WoW in 2005.
---
I would not put to much stock in the performance of Classes in the beta duel tournaments.
---
Hunters are the best PVPers in Vanilla and also have the highest skill cap. (Think Gengi in OW) The only thing them losing shows is the large amount of casuals that are playing this time around.
---
loot council, aka suck the GM dick
---
It’s definitely a much larger portion because you can’t spam abilities like you can in retail. 
---
I’m not 100% certain, but I want to say rogues had auto attacks accounting for about 45-60% of their damage. It depends on hit and gear obviously. That may be a little high on the high range but I want to say it was in that ball park. This is for combat swords as that’s all I ever ran when raiding on rogue. Dagger rogues maybe less. 
---
Slice and dice + sword spec + blade flurry is just a massive amount of auto attacks coming out. 
---
Retail I want to say white damage for rogues is like maybe 10%. Maybe not even that.

I disagree on that, mobility is a huge issue for priest. Any noobie (who these guides are aimed at) is likely not going to have the gold for a mount at 40, which will slow them significantly compared to a shaman who has ghostwolf

Lol nice. Actually it’s from Skyrim and is just another word for wimp.
---
Haha I'm single and have no pets, so no worries there! I love my job and it's the best distraction ever, but it's weather dependent and said weather has been absolutely shit lately..
---
The word "nuance" is pretty important here, and you seem to want to ignore it completely.
---
Tanks and healers *will* be rolling for their perceived and/or actual OS, and it can be as legitimate (or more) as other upgrades for other people.  It's rare, and would require a lot of things to go a certain way, but it will happen and isn't an objectively wrong thing.
---
what server were you on? I hit rank 11 at level 59 and there was a horde shaman named celestial who hit rank 14 at 59. this was on khaz modan.
---
In classic while jumping is pretty important. Like making certain jumps in warsong gulch to get after the flag room. And also out in world PVP when you're messing around you want to have a fine tuning with your jumps. The best way to fine-tune where you're standing, is to have a back-pedal key. Unbinding your only way to walk slowly is a fucking terrible idea. I know you can hit / to toggle walking. Who wants to toggle on on toggle walking when I need to do something with precision. When you're trying to getting perfect position where you want to stand you can tap forward or strafe all you want but those are big chunks of movement maybe you need to just move a tiny bit? Don't unbind backpedal just don't use it like an idiot.
---
Posts like this where the OP feels inclined to argue on every reply is awesome. You can downvote so much more times.

You're the only snowflake here kid, how about you don't spend your free time thinking of creative ways to control how other people play.

So the OP *"finally convinced my GF to play WoW with me"* and requests *"video's for extreme noobs to play this game"*

and you want to show her the South Park episode

Not really highlighting our most positive aspects, ya know?
---
-Not paying your workers who then went home to their families without money.
---
-Invading another planet (Azeroth), massacring men, women, and children, setting entire regions aflame and taking over their homes for your Demon Masters after you *willingly* drank their LSD Cocaine Blood cocktail and your reasoning for drinking said blood int he first place is become someone told you that you would "Be Conquerers" and then you went on to conquer and massacre nations.
---
Hmm, seems like one of these is *significantly* worse than the other.
---
As long as you can not leave the computer for 3-4 hours dungeon grinding will beat out questing.  The grinding in dungeons is bad on normal encounters, since you have to replace party members and get them to walk to the dungeon.  Also, when the world servers go down from overloaded players, the instance server players will still be collecting xp.
---
You're a priest with most talents in shadow for leveling but you're currently healing the dungeon group. What is your main spec?  What do you expect other people to think is your main spec?
---
I see. Don't think that'll be an issue though. I've started on private servers many times over the years since retail has always bored me quite quickly (except for cata, had a great time doing some 10man raids with friends there).
---
If you don't like the way a guild is ran, go find another one. There will be thousands to choose from across all servers. Pick your preferred poison.

No need to hate on no life casual guilds! /s

Infra has a VERY detailed mage spreadsheet guide that goes into aoe farming as well as all the aspects of mage. Kargoz also has a very detailed video on everything mage as well, where he covers aoe farming

When it was an MMO it got up to 12 mil subscribers. Whatever it is now nets less than 2 mil concurrent subscribers. Yes it was better and retail is not as good.
---
They aren't making money from it, what incentive do they have? Do you really think they care if some people get caught in a drag net ban? 
---
Look at any other game servers (like fps games), admins will ban for basically anything.
---
Why are you playing right now if you're not enjoying it? There's nothing wrong with taking a break for awhile.
---
Hunters struggle in duels. Because they need max range for kiting. They are beast in all other forms of PvP.
---
3k is SO MUCH gold for 15-20$ shit if it's that cheap I know a LOT of people that will just buy gold for all their shit at 60.
---
I did 49 and 59 as a Arms Warrior. Amazing times with Kang and Arcanite Reaper! You could literally one-shot mages in those brackets with &lt;1000 hp. Amazing.
---
pretty sure ambush/backstab rogue is the only melee spec that can do more yellow than white at endgame and still top dps
---
Lol can't wait to see world servers go down.
---
But hey if it works out for you guys, congrats! I still don't believe it will be faster than questing, especially on top of the fact that layering exists :)
---
because dueling is one of my fav parts of wow, especially dueling friends.
---
I really hope you are downvote farming
---
I would imagine you should still get a 1/8 chance for the loot. That makes it more complicated for the loot distributor, but still doable. Just need to make it clear in chat what's going on so you can avoid drama when someone doesn't understand the process.
---
"8 healers in raid, rolling 1-8 (Pughealer = 1, GuildA = 2-5 because they have 4 healers, GuildB = 6-8 because they have 3 healers)."
---
Any mmorpg that does have pve raids I instantly write off.
---
Raids are what wow does best. It’s what made it the most popular mmorpg the world has ever seen.

It’s not without issue, but there literally no perfect way and this way is the best way there is.

Honestly orc looks pretty nice in their epic lock sets. I personally used to think dwarfs were ugly as shit and then rolled a dwarf shaman because I thought Draenei looked even worse. Eventually dwarf grew on me and became one of my favorite alliance races. Same might happen to you with orcs.

Also I forget, can the fel hound dispel fear, charm, and sleep from the lock?

Im not gonna change your mind.

You have every right to think what you want even thought its complete crap

Least: Not getting to experience the actual content/gear patch progression, takes away from the overall experience but I understand why.

Yal are the best! Thank you so much. Obvs very helpful.

True but it’s satire. That episode actually brought a lot of people to the game
---
The only difference here is that the Orcs literally invaded and murdered thousands including men women and children.
---
Mexico literally got rekt by the United States and pushed out of their own territory and then had their entire society disrupted by American drug trade and colonialism which has only increased the refugee problem forcing those people to come seek asylum in America to avoid death and starvation.
---
The Orcs invaded Azeroth intent on killing, murdering, burning, and *conquering* the planet.
---
Donald Trump would like you to think that Mexicans are actually invading and murdering people like the *Orcs actually did*.

Like I said you can ask, but most of the time people are gonna say no, and you shouldn't contest it.

Open world pvp is different than duels...

This is completely wrong. Classic is a separate download (around 4-5 GB as a stand-alone install), lower poly character models, and far less particle effects. This all adds up to a huge impact to performance.
---
Minimum PC specs are also completely different:
---
* CPU
---
 * Retail: Intel Core i5-760 (9 years old)
---
 * Classic: Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 (13 years old)
---
* GPU:
---
 * Retail: NVIDIA GTX 560 (8 years old)
---
 * Classic: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT (12 years old)
---
* RAM:
---
 * Retail: 4GB
---
 * Classic: 2GB
---
The difference between these specs equates to Classic needing about a third of the processing power (according to minimum specs) that Retail needs.
---
Dominoes is disgusting.  But I'll get it with some Code Red Mountain Dew purely for nostalgia.
---
Yes this exactly. It isnt even confined to just guilds  but also raiding.
---
We have all been invited to that raid where it takes 3 or 4 wipes to realize the raid leader doesnt know what they are doing.
---
To OPs point, if you dont have heavy vanilla raiding experience you will be completely trampled by trying to coordinate 40 people. The way my old guild succeeded in doing this was having 8 people running the raid. Guild leader tanked and pushed everyone forward. Two officers handled loot distribution. Two officers handled DPS and healer management. Two officers handled DE, skinning, mining, and herbalism. Last, one person (a hunter in our case)  handled pulling for the tank (i.e. aimed shot + multi shot + feign death). 
---
Doing all this on your own is fuxxing suicidal.
---
Solution to a dungeon finder: A friends list. Group with someone, like how it went? Friend list them. Get an addon that lets you take notes in your friends list and bam! Next time you're forming a group just browse and whisper. 
---
Flying? Flying makes the world less dangerous, smaller and less immersive. Flying allows you to bypass the world. It also removes the goldsink that is flight points. You no longer run by a lower level player, you no longer run by an enemy that might pursue you.  I would infact argue that they should remove flying from BC and all other versions of the game.
---
Let's assume I know nothing about you (and have no insights into your mindset based on your post).
---
As a 'guild'(group) of people who raid you need to manage expectations and devise a mechanism for loot distribution that
---
+ Doesn't make any of the (+)40 members feel their being screwed over
---
+ Is rewarding enough for the time/effort/expectations you impose
---
Even if you don't have 40 members and you (later) focus on things like ZG (20man, with a bunch of amazing PvP loot) the same deal applies. You're asking many people to make contributions (of their time, effort, etc.) over an extended period of time. Something like a ZG trinket takes weeks of commitment and it's not like you can equip-out everyone at once.
---
If you can't offer the 'people' something they cannot find else-where, they'll just leave in their droves. If what you demand of them is too 'high-a-price', they'll just bail on you. There are people that just may outright be unfaithful and guild hop once you've taken you for all their loot. In a way it's an extreme way of dating, except that you're trying to manage a harem 
---
Just finding a bunch of people who raid to PvP is trivial (plenty of people will be after things like Ashkandi). Keeping them around for more than 1 raid and even after they've gotten loot will be your hard part. You don't need a team of dedicated officers and stuff to pull that off.
---
In 'Vanilla' it was quite possible to pug/clear your way through all raids up-to-and-including most of AQ40 without needing flasks/consumables/special gear. That's the baseline threshold you'd have to be competing against (any and all loot up to there is puggable, given enough time). The resource savings alone on things like consumables (assuming you demanded people pot, use flasks) could simply be 'banked' by an otherwise raider and have them just 'buy loot' from a hardcore PvE guild in the future.
---
The problem is you need to compete for 'people resources' against everyone, if you're offering loot (as much as you can offer loot given the RNG nature of loot) and someone else is doing the same, but a at a better entry price you're not going to be able to retain numbers week-on-week.
---

The strategy and foresight was unbelievable. Utilizing the total toolkit druids have to offer with such finesse.  Everything his opponent did was perfectly responded to.  Makes me want to roll a Druid but I don’t think I have enough time to reach the skill ceiling.
---
The tokens are anonymous aren't they? You could still have to trade gold for gold. Still I don't see the system not working if scamming is the only deterrent.
---
Holy shit you just gave me flash backs of people running into walls for 30+ seconds in the halls of IF going from the AH to the FP.
---
At one point it was, but it's become the norm among decent hunters on PS as information got out over the years.
---
There's a weekly thread that gets stickied on this sub for recruitment.
---
Or you can just be honest. Most of what Im looking for in a guild has to do with their raid schedule, that's what I would say.
---
Thus LFR was born.
---
Out of the loop. What do you mean by switching layers?
---
It's a simple employment type question that gauges you have some level of interest/success in the guild, rather than simply using them as a medium for loot. The point of this question isn't the answer, but to show that you've put some thought into it, in context of the guild as a whole.
---
If something this trivial is what stumps you, I wouldn't (assuming I had a screening process) want you either. Given two candidates (for a job) that were seemingly otherwise identical you'd always take the one who actually gave a damn.
---
Honestly, I'm kind of looking forward to it. I've never experienced WoW without BGs and even though I like them it'll be interesting to see the game without them. It's not like there's nothing to do aside from BGs either, so I can wait a few months.
---
Everyone upvote this and confuse the hell out of everyone else.
---
They don't need to do any such thing. That isn't the game we want if that's the game you want then keep playing retail.
---
At the beginning, yes. In a year, no chance.
---
As someone who just resubbed after quitting CATA.
---
I agree, mostly.
---
Retail is just so.... it just doesn't seem like WOW anymore at all.
---
One thing I do like though is the graphics. Playing through the Demon Hunter opening stuff was a blast! I felt like such a bad-ass but also kind of missed that enemies actually were threatening and not just big clumps of easy kills.
---
... you can say it was random... especially if they have recruitment posts.
---
I'll change your mind... Elves don't deserve that much credit.  You're acting like they are this end all- be all power that has the ability to do all this dumb stuff... and while they can do dumb stuff... it might as well be reasoned that chaos did it.
---
Considering the government has the legitimacy and authority to levy taxes, an individual choosing to not pay them because he disagrees with the policies those taxes would support, is an individual who fundamentally disagrees with Democracy. 
---
Personally, I find hypocrites worse than liars. I see making a fake charity as a lie--especially if its funded by your own money vs donations (if 3rd party donations get involved, now its theft). Living in a democratic state and not paying taxes the aggregate society has voted for either directly or through the election or their representatives is Hypocritical and anti democratic to boot.
---
Fight for your position in the marketplace of ideas, but once your argument loses, you dont just get to go stick up your middle finger and tell everyone else to go fuck themselves...then demand we tow the line on the next reactionary contrived wedge issue.

&gt;The 8/8/8 split is pretty standard if you ask me.
---
Nobody with a full time job “works” for exactly 8 hours. It’s usually 8 hours of actual in-the-office work, sure. But then 30-60 mins for lunch, and twice that for your commute if you’re lucky. Now you’re pushing 10-11 hours just for “work”. 
---
The average person does not get an 8/8/8 split on workdays, and you’re kidding yourself if you think that’s realistic.
---

Any warrior leveling as dualwield deserves to permanently lose their offhand.
---
Agree about removing flying from BC. I only put Vanilla above BC because of flying, it made WoW significantly worse.
---
Same, if only people would hear me out and just read the ENTIRE thing so they can totally understand what I mean
---
Pvp PvE? Dungeon group? Just a guild of 5 people?
---
I get it. I even like the episode. I'm just saying, for a gf who needed convincing, it's like saying "this is what normal people think you are doing when you play WoW".
---
Your main spec for purposes of running that dungeon is to heal (which if you’re in there with mainly DPS talents you’re only doing it for the quick group find). If you are with ransoms, you Greed on DPS gear and Need on healing upgrades.
---
IDK why you're making the same argument that I already made in great detail above.  Just read the post
---
Well dueling at level 40 gives a pretty warped perspective on it, things will generally be vastly different at level 60. If you like hunter then go with it. The problem with duels is that you generally end up starting off fairly close to each other which is why duels against melee characters can be rough, duels against casters go much better for them.
---
Rogue autos account for 45-55% of ur dmg, so keep snd up at all times
---
Trolls are getting lazy lately.
---
No one really wants Hand of Rag tbh, it's a large time/money investment for a weapon that's honestly not even that good. I wouldn't be surprised if it just went to shamans every time for the novelty.
---
what kills me is the 'hardcore' guilds who want to 'dominate pvp' and then you check their raid times and they are RIGHT IN THE FUCKING MIDDLE OF BG WEEKENDS
---
Like /u/erikja421 said, you should use 1-6 (and ~), Q, E-T, A-G and Z-V along with expanding upon all of these binds by using modifier keys. For whisper replies, which is bound to r by default, just open slash chat by tapping forward slash instead of enter (/) and then R (/r), you want to have R open for a spell bind. For C, which is bound to your character sheet, I recommend rebinding that to H. That'll unbind your honor panel, but that can be accessed by opening your character sheet and then clicking the honor tab at the bottom.. sure, you can't open your honor panel with a keybind, but there's no real need to do so anyway.

Also, Q and E are going to be bound to strafe. You'll want to rebind those to A and D and just abandon standard turning with keyboard inputs entirely because you can turn more quickly and accurately using mouse movements by holding right click. This will free up Q and E for ability binds. Additionally, I'd recommend binding alt-W or something-W to auto run and learn to use that just all the time so that you can more often avoid holding W when advancing. Also, if you're auto running, you can swing your camera around by click-dragging with left click in order to observe your surroundings better without stopping.
---
Another thing I would recommend you try to learn to do is palming your ctrl key. Most people press ctrl with this pinky, I believe, but it's possible to simply bring the leftmost corner of your palm down on it because it's the very bottom left key on the board so you can catch the key by its bottom left corner without the use of a finger. Once you get the muscle memory of it down, it becomes the easiest to use modifier and it won't even use a finger up so that greatly expands your possible keybind choices. If you don't quite understand what I mean by palming it, I can take a picture once I get home in about an hour.
---
It’s a helpful question. For the last several expansions I was in leadership for a guild that was for people interested in pushing mythic content on a 2 day / 6 hour a week schedule. We also built a reputation around having a great community within our guild and raiders.
---
Knowing why people want to join your YOUR guild vs A guild is important, whether it be the schedule or the reputation or skill level. Especially in vanilla where reputations are important within a server and you will likely know a good bit about a guild, or have even played with some of them, before applying.
---
I read what he said, I still downvote.
---
I feel like there is a dirty Joke somewhere in your last sentence but cant find it
---
I wonder how much can 2 agility help at level 20, but couldnt find any information on internet sadly
---
I did that back in vanilla , but probably wont in classic
---
If you dont find value or accomplishment in classic as it is, that's not blizzards problem.
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
You’re in the wrong sub buddy.
---
Thanks! Been watching the old videos on YouTube recently had no idea what the schedule is
---
That language just says you can create and reserve before the worldwide release, not **until** the worldwide release.
---
One could interpret that as it’s available up to the release, but it doesn’t say that. So Blizzard can change the creation timeframe whenever the please, which they might. We just don’t know.
---
&gt; which if you’re in there with mainly DPS talents you’re only doing it for the quick group find
---
That's completely false.  Nearly every tanking and healing spec is biased into DPS trees because only people chain running dungeons full-spec for it.  Nearly all tanks/healers have a leveling spec that has *enough* talents to get the job done, and the rest are for solo play / questing.
---
&gt; you Greed on DPS gear and Need on healing upgrades.
---
Unless you encounter any of the nuanced situations in which that doesn't make sense, which I've explained in great detail for you above.
---
We’ll be playing on a PvP realm. The group is for leveling at a steady pace together. So far no one is interested in starting a guild, but we’ve decided to all join the same one. The exception would be if our 5th player is interested in being a guild leader.
---
Fuck pvp
---
Eh, yeah, not the best example but I think the point is fairly clear.
---
Same lol - think they had a schedule but beta ruined them so I'm sure they'll knock out a couple more leading up to launch.
---
3 times a week 4 hours a night is extremely hardcore for vanilla wow. That’s like 6 alt splits of mc.
---
If you want a retail experience, just play retail?
---
Holy Smite/Wand leveling is perfectly fine while downtime from dungeons.  I level all my priests as Holy all the way to 60.
---
Don't do it, it's bad.
---
And if you DO do it, don't tell anyone you do, or you'll get laughed at. ESPECIALLY don't tell your guild, or you'll never raid.
---
Just tell 'em what they want to hear.
---
I don't disagree with you one bit. However, this is exactly why we need tax reform in the united states, to hold these companies to the fire over this stuff. Good luck passing any of that in today's political climate though.
---
!remindme 22 days
---
Thanks, but given the other answers in this thread, I don't really trust it tbh :D
---
Wait what
---
Tell me, what makes Prot Warrior not viable in two out of three BG's?
---
Druids are primarily flag carriers and are subpar at just about every other role. The same could be said for Warrior? Correct? Prot warriors can do damage, especially when they stance dance a 2H weapon. 
---
My point is that Prot Warriors are just as viable as Feral/Resto-Feral. There is nothing a FC Druid has over Prot warriors in AB which is the only BG they both share weaknesses. Prot warriors can hold nodes with healers extremely well, there all sorts of reasons why you're being biased towards Druids and neglecting the positives of Warrior.
---
Same thing must have happened with Kargoz after he got married. I only caught 1-2 episodes of Good morning Azeroth live and it doesn’t look like they’ve done any in a few weeks

Idk if u can tell, but I miss my exgf. The wound is still raw.
---
Because classic is going to be more fun bro. I’m probably going to play as a troll
---
That’s okay, you can run the simulations on live to verify.
---
While in college I played a while from Glasgow on U.S. servers. Ping really isnt that bad, but the time difference can be really, really brutal. That was much more of a problem than ping was.
---
&gt;We all have busy lives now.
---
No we "all" don't. I've freed up every aspect of my life to be able to play Classic. LFD/LFR and flying = I won't bother playing. It's what killed the game for me.
---
I gotcha. Very well explained. Palming it probably would be slightly quicker once you get used to it. Very nice!

I don't know. I thought they were just like other things you could list at AH, I don't actually play bfa.

But I could just tell them at what exact value im putting the token up for.

This is very enlightening. Time to do more research. Thanks!

i didnt read it and i downvoted

Troll sounds appropriate

 Exactly what you said. This kind of questions are there to "weed-out" the people who wouldn't really want to join their guilds.

You also farm the noobs for epeen.

Are you the same guy that asked yesterday?

When truth is offensive, I'm thrilled to oppose you.
---
Ooh, you had to comment history stalk me. *Awesome.*
---
Alchemy is by far the best profession you can have as a warrior if you're looking to level solo. The health pots alone will save you so much time. Whether or not you stick with it long term or not is up to you, but there's no other profession that's going to give you the same boost to leveling efficiency.

Gnancy

So what you are saying is to lie and write some Bullshit....  lol. I already covered that.

Just read my entire post and you’ll understand where I’m coming from

Looked through a few. Seemed to be 45-60% for rogues.

please do :) thanks

It’s way less grind than osrs. Difficulty level similar. Requires other players to do endgame unlike osrs.

Why not just join a guild and be the PvP leader? Perhaps my guild if you are going Alliance on a PvP server EST time ;).

This isn't "the early days of WoW" anymore, everyone runs an auction addon, nobody is going to """""""""accidentally""""""""""" buy some worthless item for a massive amount of gold.

August 25 or 26

Never figured out the mechanic on fleeing mobs. As a warrior i keept chasing that mob in to more mobs. Everyfucking time.
---
Makes sense to me
---
Something is the most popular so it's objectively the best?
---
Did you know the fifth highest-selling book in the UK is "Fifty Shades of Grey"?  It's good to know that this book is objectively better than, say, anything by Ernest Hemmingway.
---
you should resub on Thursday August the 8th so that you can play the stress test. That’s what I’m doing at least
---
Doubt it.
---
I'm not excited to say anything. I'm not *trying* to offend anyone. Where's your evidence of that? Seriously,  what is your problem? 
---
Lol, there you go with the "everyone". As if everyone believes the same thing. As if everyone SHOULD believe the same thing. Collectivist bullshit. And of course it's not true. Everyone doesn't believe the same thing. Everything doesn't think something is offensive. But you want to push that narrative. It's an attempt to manipulate people into agreeing with you, that *you're right*, that *everyone agrees with you*. But that's objectively false. Everyone doesn't. So you're a liar.
---
The end goal is THE TRUTH. Regardless of what "offends you".
---
When free speech is a problem, *that's* a problem. If words offend you, YOU are the problem.
---
How do you xfer BFA gold to classic gold with your method?
---
You do know, you’re in a sub for a *Role-Playing Game*, right?
---
Don't forget the majority of the player-base is now in their late 20s and will not hesitate to buy gold, instead of grinding for hours.
---
What's with OP posting so many dumb threads today?
---
Sorry did you expect to have your dick intellectually stroked by posting that word vomit that boils down to:
---
&gt; I like the game that this subreddit is about, and dislike the game that practically everyone here dislikes. 
---
What a stunning and brave viewpoint to post on this sub!
---
I don't see the point in name reservation. Until you know which realms are "high / max" population there's no point to roll anywhere.
---
You're missing your horde flare
---
Please go to the classic+ reddit. There you find people who will discuss this.
---
You should know what you get here with these kind of questions.
---
Take my downvote.

I think the Paladin won.  He got to the mountain top first, and you died twice.

I’m going horde. We are the &lt;Communist Party&gt; and organizing the liberate the alliance from the oppression of capitalist rule.

was gonna link to that site. seems to be comprehensive.

Puntme

Yeah after thinking about it for Shamans Orc is clearly better in PvP. And be Rogue+Warrior that hitbox is a huge negative
---
Fishing lvls?
---
Pinnaple and Ham, Chicken Bacon Ranch, and Spinach Alfredo are viable specs in raids if you just bring 1 of each and they work harder than the pepperoni specs
---
Well that is a good question, because it might be you like the raiding times, a friend is playing there. Whatever reason you put in there, is help for the guildmanagers to see why people wants to join.
---
Flying no
---
Dungeon queue no
---
Maybe someone to summon party to dungeon more easily but again, it remove the purpose of the warlock summoning and remove the adventure to go to the dungeon portal
---
Maybe a dungeon billboard where you can sign your name for a dungeon without spamming LFG chat and people can consult it and whisper you would be enough

Im enjoying the end of the classic wow Private server community.
---
I found out about them way to late in their life span, maybe in 15 years time I can look forward to this happening all again.
---
well I will need to 10 slots on my server for sure
---
well... yeah this actually did happen in vanilla with German and Spanish players if i remember right.  but the number of people speaking EU languages and playing from Europe is vastly higher and more significant compared to RP players
---
You're kidding. We are the DPRA and seek to further our Party Mission above all.
---
Mentally I don't need to be there.  I could find a rotation, but I might as well just spam multishot.  It's the difference between being 6x overpowered and 8x overpowered.
---
My toon was 61 when I re-subbed and didn't have a flying mount.  After finishing Hellfire off (without needing help) after a 12 year break I had enough gold for a flying mount.
---
I tried leveling in Azshara since my toon had never been there, and all the sudden I'm a robot spamming the one damage spell that robots have.  When asking to kill invading elves I got full credit for pinging any elves that the guards would finish off for me.  They didn't need me there, my character didn't need me there, so I left.
---
There where summoning stones.

We should roll on the same server. Rival guilds

I played Rogue as an alt in WOTLK and remember there being a bit more than just keeping up SnD. You had a couple finishers and a couple combo builders, as well as using Tricks and cooldowns and such.

Tell me a little more about the history of your group! Might be able to join us
---
Hey that one's mine!
---
Interesting, where is this data available?
---
&gt;  If you want to be ez go herb + skin
---
Would it be worth it to go skin till like level 30ish for the mount and then swap to alchemy when leveling starts getting tougher?
---
&gt;Why do you want to join our guild, instead of others?
---
&gt;How the yuck am I supposed to know? The truth is you chose them rather randomly, and your schedules align.
---
That's an easy question then.
---
"You raid when I am able to raid"
---
Imagine thinking you’re right about literally everything, especially if it’s offensive, and then additionally thinking that it is your duty to spread that around. 
---
For normal people, they realize that they most likely have views which are not correct, and may hurt others. Usually, this comes in the form of having a new experience and saying “huh, I was wrong about that, I wonder what else I’m wrong about.” 
---
After that, most people keep things they know are offensive to themselves because if they say something that hurts someone else, it might be wrong and it doesn’t help anyone. 
---
It has nothing to do with free speech. It’s about the culture surrounding the speech that is used and encouraged. Have a good day.
---
I got you !
---
The point is meme specs are still meme specs. Not running buffs hurts their attendance.
---
When you're buffed, the rest of the buffed raid can pick up the slack of the lack of DPS by the meme. This it doesn't matter. Where if you don't huff, you need to min/max classes which pretty much means stacking rogues.
---
&lt;Pretentious&gt; is a semi-casual guild looking to clear raids while maintaining a fun and supportive atmosphere. We aspire to build an extraordinary, camaraderie-based community that mutually respects our members not just as gamers, but as people. 
---
Many of us have played Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath together; most of us haven't touched WoW since then. We're all so excited to play again, and are hoping to get a committed team together to raid within the first three months. We want the player, not the class. If you want world firsts or to top everything, everywhere, all the time, this might not be the guild for you. Think of us as the Other Guys, the jokers who get shit done. We put camaraderie over everything else.
---
Raids are Tuesday and Thursday, from 8-11 EST.
---
High priority loot will be distributed by Loot Council, but most set pieces and non-tank things will be more freeform, likely a /roll. We're not too sweaty about this sort of thing.

30-60min per day

maybe a bit more on weekend

so 8-10hours would be great but I doubt I will be able to keep this

Really.  How do you tell the people giving you genuine feedback from the people kissing your ass to get into the guild?

Well yeah there's more to it, but DMG breakdown wise you were still like 45% white DMG

Nah. Fuck your opinion.

Lol that is brutal
---
Does it scratch the same itch as wow does at all? I'm on the fence about trying that game, but there seems to be a ton of hype around it.
---
Three words.
---
Frayed. Abomination. Stitching.
---
No, they are shit in retail and they would be shit in classic, i don't need to change your mind because they will not be added.
---
People just need to accept that retail and classic are very different games and almost different genres at this point.  I don't think classic is "better" than retail, I just think I will enjoy it more because I want to feel more immersed into the world.  If I was looking more for an action/rpg type experience retail would be better.
---
Moving goalposts.
---
On the higher end of things Guilds are essentially teams. Everyone must be a team player and must be socially approachable.  This is why guilds take themselves very seriously. It will be interesting to see these modern WoW legion babies be forced to maintain social circles instead of insta-queing for everything and getting carried.  You must have deep social iterations  in this version of the game to find success in either PVE or PVP. That's why these questions will be everywhere on the guild apps.
---
I'm not your friend tho.

You mean like once every couple hours because the first time you spam it you'll get so many whispers you won't know what to do with them all.

LF Healer more like it.

---
? Why what reason?
---
If you go half deep in all 3 your losing out on the strengths of each spec as you can only achieve 11pts spell *3 instead of a 21pt spell or a 31pts spell.  
---
You could potentially be a healer with darkness that buffs warlock but your stomping your self.
---
Was EST on a PST Server, raids were at mostly at 9pm, sometimes 8-8:30pm up to midnight or 1 am for some rare occasion
---
Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday. Sometimes Sunday was bonus day and raiders had to attend at least 2 raid nights without being penalized on loot
---
Where have I said I'm "right about everything"? 
---
Just about everything you say is complete nonsense.
---
**Do you have an argument**? Do you even know how to make a simple argument? By all means, do so.
---
Like my Dad always said "You gotta be willing to suck at something if you want to be good at it.
---
Crusader is good for leveling wpn skill and judging dungeon bosses though.
---
Frostease.
---
Nobbel on youtube. He has so many good videos check out his playlists.  I think he even has one talking about when classic takes place
---
12am-4am on Mondays
---
"See you at 60"
---
If you really want to play with them, meet them at 60.
---
Not worth the headache while leveling. Meet strangers when you do dungeons for quests.
---
I mean you take most of the good talents either way. A lot of it just comes down to PI vs SoR. PI is more flashy for sure, but has a medium cd, is very easily dispelled and needs a pretty specific setup. It's just a very situational spell that often gets wasted. SoR on the other hand gives you 10 seconds completely uninterruptible freecast healing every fight basically. It's a very big deterrent to killing a priest first, and you basically always want to kill the priest first. It will regularly save and turn fights. It's very rare PI will give a fight a different outcome.
---
I’m most excited for summoning the original, super awesome version of doomguard
---
The countdown to Classic podcast has lore episodes, focusing on each instance/Dungeon and in that process sheds light on the history of Azeroth as a whole.
---
Have you tried talking to them?
---
Absolutely, I've always felt the same way. I prefer WoW overall but most of the WoW quests are pretty underwhelming. Runescape has many more meaningful and memorable quests.
---
You have to know there's another Rogue coming, which makes Perception garbage in most situations.
---
Yeah all my friends are going alliance, been back at retail playing horde, im prob gunna say fuck it go horde for classic and make new friends
---
Vanilla raid bosses.
---
Naa instead he subtweeted them on reddit
---
Specifically cause they are controlling
---
It does not bother me as much, but im in a diffrent situation thou. I will be tanking, so its me holding the "reins".   
---
But in the end i let people play what they want to play, because i know that i will meet new people along the way, its not like my friends will be the only ones im playing with. its not like retail where you have a small group and you stick to them.
---
Holy Priest (me) - Wrath Baby, have played a healing Priest (started Disc, switched to Holy in Legion) as a main since then. I have run the gauntlet of casual raiding, running a pretty decent heroic (before mythic), and mythic guild, to being a CE raider. In game I am a farmer. Pets, mounts, reps, you name it, I want it. My most looked forward to goal in Classic is getting exalted with Zandalari because my retail Priest ended with like one turn in away from Exalted and it hurts me. That's a little more than history, whoops. (:
---
Tank (Warrior/Druid) - Has played since Classic, started tanking pretty much full time since TBC, and has main tanked every expansion from TBC til a little into BFA. IMO is an excellent tank. Ran guild with me during MOP-BFA. Known them since Wrath. Has a vast well of Classic knowledge and is intending to tank about a million 5mans for the guild to get pre-raid BIS / class quests.
---
Mage - Known them since MOP, has played a Warlock primarily. Has fluctuated between casual and hardcore raiding mostly depending on what I have done. Solid player attendance and mechanics wise (at least when he doesn't have to move for Chaos Bolt).
---
Warrior - Also known since MOP, plays and levels about every class 3 times over, but has settled on Warrior for Classic. I've watched him blossom from a terrible player we carried through SoO to someone I trusted to help me run a guild in Legion. Very adaptable person and will probably be the first person to volunteer if you ever need a reroll for something. Intending to DPS, but is open to tanking should it be needed.
---
Warlock - Warrior's cousin, I've only known since Legion, but in that time he was a dependable player who was always excellent at his class choices  (Mage and Rogue are what I saw). Pretty quiet and I didn't notice him doing much outside of raiding. That said from what I've been told he's leveled multiple 60's on private servers.
---
As a whole the group has been together for a long time and we're pretty close knit (not saying we're clichey), we enjoy helping others and are intending at the very least to be self sufficient with raid consumables. We are pretty laid back, we aren't offended easily and love to joke around and are not afraid to sling some controversial jokes with the best of them.
---
Any vids of this, for simple folk like me
---
Just be open with how you intend on approaching the game. 
---
Let them know you’re playing for a fun experience and not to min/max, dungeon grind, or develop the perfect raid set up.
---
Communicate. Worst that could happen is your friend isn’t about that life and plays with another group.
---
It it's 10 or more of you some are bound to play same class. Just keep quiet and play what YOU intended. More likely than not, half of them is not going to stick around. 
---
Make sure you enjoy your classic experience and if it comes to worst, you will make good new friends to enjoy game with.
---
I just do whatever dumb shit my friends are gonna do with them. When theyre not on, yeah I might get past them and just keep going my own way. But they are my friends ill play with them no matter what dumb way they wanna play is

Area 51 - All will join this Server for the Memes

I'm not saying you're wrong. I think many of these people intend to save the mats for later auctions, or simply use to craft.

Stfu n1ggre3
---
Yeah of course I talk to them. They mostly are just so sucked up into the hype they are unwilling to see that min-maxing a group of average players is going to cause drama. For example, guys in our group are already complaining they dont want to play what they have been "assigned to play."
---
No matter how many people are already playing something, it won't matter during the end-game. Just ignore them and play what you love.
---
If you roll on Lavishly Jeweled Ring as a Warrior, please don't let this post fool you, you're still a piece of shit

I want to watch two streams:

\- The guild which will raid with only meme-specs.

If you're goal is to set up addons to be ready to go on launch, you'll need to be in the stress test on the 8th, which requires an active sub.
---
I'm still (casually) playing Retail, so many alt's to max out, so many acheivements to get, 2/3 of the way thru LoreMaster, so many mounts to get, so many rare pets to tame etc etc.
---
I agree with the endgame comment, can get new 120's geared up crazy easy.
---

---
I agree entirely. Sounds exactly like the shit closeted crazies (extremists, racists, etc) would say.
---
You can download them now and put them into the classic folder.
---
just add shift+what whatever you're used to. doubles the amount of bindings and everyones got a pinky on standby to hit shift
---
my first big mistake was to roll on a server 3 time zones away.  wasted all that time leveling to 60 only to realize ill never get to raid due to time conflicts.
---
I think France won, they got to France first, they ran away and didn’t die, and left with a baguette.
---
When a 'corporation pays taxes', who do you think loses out on money?  A recent study by Hassett and Mathur found that for a 1% increase in tax rates, wages went down by .5%.
---
So, Blizzard being made to fork over more may have contributed to the layoffs.
---
To be fair, compared to 20-25 hour raid weeks on live, which is the upper end before you start taking PTO on raid release, 12 hour raid week—while excessive until AQ—is comparably casual.
---
Honestly the least casual “ask” from the guild is level 60 and prebis within 1 month. I’ve leveled 6 or some characters to 60. I’m giving myself 2 months to hit 60. I last did the level 60 grind a few years ago. Working the same 50-60 hour weeks I am now, it took me ~2 months.
---
Just create whatever character you want to play and play the game however you want to play. The best part about vanilla is you can find a ton of people who play the game in the same way you want to play it, regardless if it’s grinding mobs, dungeons, questing, exploring, ect. My advice is fuck what anyone else wants from you especially out of a game. Do you bro!
---
Of too many ppl are in the same zone, blizzard and most modern games will create instances of that zone with fewer players in it. 
---
This reduces player lag, and competitive over the same mobs
---
Had just 1-12 bound on my old account and moved with the mouse, which ended me up clicking a lot of actions.  Got myself one of those g600.  Now bound 1-12 and f1-12 (gbutton).   Just working currently on training my hand to use some of those buttons.
---
Griefing is a a must. It forces Alliance to level in zones other than STV LOL
---
Slows are CC mate!
---
Hey bud I'm in the same boat in terms of wanting some lore before classic drops! Personally I love the Warcraft movie, although I know some people would disagree! As for books - it seems like the consensus is that the books written by Christie Golden are very good. I'm halfway through my first one and I love it so far. "Beyond the Dark Portal" is the one I'm reading. Also apparently "The Last Guardian" by Grubb is really good, but I haven't read it myself! Good luck
---
If fifty shades of grey sold 10 million more units than the next iteration of shades than yeah the original was probably a fuck ton better.
---
Buy a MMO mouse and use shift/caps/ctrl/alt as modifers and you have 50 keybinds from that alone that you can press without hindering your WAD/jump performance at all. Then I have some non mouse related keybinds like Q E R Z X  and such that I only use for PvE since in PvE having full control of your character is usually not needed as you are just standing still.
---
Naturally
---
Absolutely this
---
Then maybe its just a guild that dont have much experiance in recruiting, and what is need to know basis, and what you can talk about casually in voicechat.  
---
Ive seen some stupid questions aswell. You can always judge a guild based of the questions they are asking you when you apply. And choose to not apply to them.
---
50% off peizzae
---
&gt; So at which level does it become easier?
---
When you re-roll to another class
---
You will be playing on hard mode my friend especially if you lvl alone, keep first aid updated and might even grab cooking to help with downtime or ask a mage if possible for food.
---
World Pvp at low level just sucks as warrior ham string and run if you can.
---
But once you get to lvl 60 it's smooth sailing (mostly).
---
I lol’d
---
Also, I'll say this here so you can see. It might be a good idea to make a Discord server now for us all to hop on, can always rename it to the server name after the fact.
---
Least excited that I know it all. Most excited that I have more control over my schedule now. 
---
Learning back in the day was great, having the time to tackle the content I want to this time around is even better.
---
This is nothing but rumors but I've heard that Blizz has already started working on both TBC and WotLK to finish up their "classic trilogy" pack. Could be fake, but tbh this'd make perfect sense to me. I think the subs would cover more than just the server maintenance, and possibly switching between 4 versions of the game with just one sub would keep people busy for a good while. Even if they split subs between retail and classic trilogy, I think it'd be well worth it.
---
In case people wanted non-memey balance druid PvP, [Stormling] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q) is amazing.
---
Twinks are for people who can't compete at 60.
---
Fair enough, if you want to stomp people while they are handicapped if you think that is fun.
---
Idk I've joined lots of top end guilds and most of them had such questions. I just wrote my honest reasoning and was invited.
---
Hamstring, Whirlwind, Execute, Mortal strike are generally very helpful abilities that will ease leveling once you get them. You generally have 6 other zones to level in at 30-45 range and that is Desolace, Swamp of Sorrows, Arathi Highlands, Hillsbrad Foothills, Alterac Mountain, Badlands. You will miss lots of fun and memories by skipping stv
---
No, I mean look at his actual history. It's 95% threads with 0 effort.
---
I'm mostly looking for how to communicate to a group that their expectations are blown out of proportion without isolating myself. Hard facts hasnt convinced anyone yet.
---
Offtopic btw
---
Oh gotch, my b. Yeah I see your point
---
Alright, man, have a good day.
---
I realized that when I first looked at a recruitment thread looking for a casual guild. I’ll join one when I create a character and am actually playing. That’s how I’ll find a guild rather than this crazy recruitment before the game even starts.
---
Hands on is more useful. Get her on a private server to learn basics.
---
That's great! I played it when it released, absolutely amazing game for sure. Be sure to check out the dlc as well!
---
Other than the myriad of complaints and examples of such use but OK
---
Just because we don't have hard data doesn't make the issue irrelevent
---
The majority of the player base in 04 was in their late 20s too. Not that that fact materially detracts from your point: gold buying was rampant in vanilla too.
---
Oh so now "popularity = quality" only works within individual series.
---
Some people on this forum are so triggered at the idea that their opinions aren't the same thing as objective quality.
---
What a coincidence!!  The best game is the one you like the most!!!
---
Hold the fuck up. You aint stealing my name boi
---
QWER,ASDF,ZXC 1234, and the 1-12 thumb buttons on my mouse.
---
The funny thing is most of these guilds that are advertising this early will just end up being casual guilds anyways. Everyone talks big before they actually have to put in the work.
---
&lt;**Weekend Warriors&gt;** \[NA\] \[Alliance\] \[PvE\]
---
Weekend Warriors is a guild created to fill major gap in the classic community. Weekend Warriors is a group of dedicated WoW players who wish to experience all of the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, but who for whatever reason find themselves constrained on time. The Weekend Warriors is a progression raiding guild. This means that we are serious about clearing content and are constantly challenging ourselves to be the best our class can be. An ideal raider is someone who has the ability and dedication to read ahead on boss mechanics and theory behind playing their class optimally.  Since we are a team of busy people who all have a verity of commitments in our everyday lives we expect our core raiders to be self-sufficient, self-motivated, and team oriented. Since we strive for excellence in our everyday lives we are goal oriented people who recognize that putting in time and consistent effort is the best way to achieve what we set out to do. Our busy lives also lead us to be compassionate and understanding.
---
Farming flasks for every progression fight and raiding 5 nights a week is simply not feasible for people with a full time job, children or other hobbies (sports teams, volunteer commitments.) Nor do we feel that it is necessary to such extreme lengths to have a productive raid team. The fact that our raiders have busy lives means that they come to raid focused and ready to go. It also means that we understand the struggles that come with trying to balance a career, social. family or any combination of those things with progression raiding in WoW. All members of Weekend Warriors are expected to be supportive, inclusive and understanding. This helps our team be more effective and makes it fun to log-in. Weekend Warriors members are expected to showcase this level of professionalism in and out of the guild, extend the same level of courtesy to people you meet in the world as you would a guild member. We look forward to being an admirable part of the realm community, classic is a social experience and we want to make it the best it can possibly be for everyone.

   * We are a raiding guild for and foremost.

   * We have a link to an application on the guild website. In addition there is a contact form on the website if you have questions. Thank you for reading this far!
---
I switch WASD over one key to ESDF. That frees up a column of buttons to the left. My primary abilities are usually bound to the mouse with scroll up, down, click, mouse 4 and mouse 5. Aside from that what everyone else mentioned by using modifiers you greatly increase your binding capacity.
---
For healing I usually use clique or whatever your favorite click casting method is allowing me to reuse the mouse bindings. Technically that's probably doable with macros but seems too much work tbh.
---
People making Bronze Tubes are gonna make a killing on Alliance in the first few days. Nobody is going to wait for the nesrby vendor to restock :p
---
&gt; I can't think of one fight in vanilla where an entire class is rendered useless.
---
I remember being basically useless as a rogue against Shazzrah since the entire raid would stick entirely to ranged. Also Nefarian's class callouts really screw some classes...shaman and hunter in particular, I think? I remember spending most of that fight dead because the MT wouldn't bother turning Nefarian away during the rogue callout. Also Viscidus possibly? I didn't really do naxx so I can't speak for that one.
---
Aug 8 (final stress test)or aug 13(name reservation)

You can see the different audiences of the subreddit from the variance in responses' to e
---
Bold move to use a twitch emote on this subreddit, Cotton. We'll see how it works out...
---
Your name was literally me for 13 years. ;_;
---
On google podcast there is morally grey 2 friends that play wow one is super into the lore other never was and he's explaining the whole history and lore of warcraft and lots of shit talking as well.
---
Its more than doable especially for the intro raids like MC
---
While some tryhards will put a lot of store into it, they will be a very small minority. As an officer of a Guild on an EU realm I just wanted to know that they could communicate in English and could take ten minutes to write a bit. I didn't want to spend seven hours a week raiding with somebody too lazy to communicate why they wanted to join. If that's just because our raid times suited them fine, at least I could expect them to show up.
---
Tell them they’re too old to behave like that and if someone needs to conform they can do it. 
---
Dungeon leveling is boring and slow anyways, only do each one 1-2 times with all quests ready if it’s about speed. 
---
Tbh all dps should be hunters if they want to min max, it’s the best deeps until level 55 😂
---
But that's PvE. They aren't going to drop a phase in months prior just because people want BGs.
---
What they probably meant was "We'll keep monitoring player raid progression and once enough people are geared we move on".
---
Yeah *heavy breathing*
---
Strangers like me
---
hey man, want some of my "melon juice"?
---
It isn’t general advice. He specifically said it’s his plans. He can get 6 and be fine.
---
I only play this game because it allows me to gank.
---
&gt; Region: NA.
---
&gt; Server: PvP.
---
&gt; Faction: Horde
---
&gt; Class: Mage
---
&gt; Raid availability: M-F 1pm-6pm Central
---
&gt; Looking for: Semi hardcore/casual raiding and a group to pvp with. I know this is a long shot when it comes to raid timings but I have an odd schedule currently. 
---
&gt; Experience: Leveled most classes on alliance to 30-50 on a private server but that's it. Pretty decent game knowledge and a quick study though. I know the ins and outs of tanking/dpsing dungeons which I would imagine should transfer over into endgame but definitely lf a guild with some endgame vanilla exp!
---
Duels aren't PvP. Duels are a rock paper scissors.
---
I'm in the same boat as OP, can someone let me know a good class to roll? I like PVE content more than PVP.
---
I don't know if it will be so easy :P. I'm back from a Vacation on the 30th and into a long weekend so I'm also trying to be hopeful haha.
---
I was referring explicitly to guaranteed slots.. No guild can retain you as a guaranteed spot if you only show up 40% of the time and under perform due to a lack of consumables
---
This guy only enjoys things ironically I can tell, very hip
---
Why take the time to attempt to convince you of anything when we can downvote you into oblivion?
---
&gt; Why do you want to join our guild, instead of others?                
---
                  
---
Because out of all the other random non existent guilds that are advertising for the game that has yet to release I really admire your balls, you have the biggest fucking balls I've ever seen on another man. I know with a fully filled scrotum like that our victories are assured in both BGs and Raids, Ive seen so many other mens coin purses and none of them match your size and healthy color. I honestly dont know if i'm qualified or even competent enough to bask in the light of such testicular grandness but I promise one thing, if allowed to join I will comfort and support with dry self assured hands no matter how far you go.
---
if there are any issues at launch it will be stable within a few hours max. a week is excessive af and i dont get it.
---
yeah its up to you obviously. I know people with difficult majors(engineering, comp sci) who would still play plenty of video games on their free time like league of legends and still graduated and have great jobs.
---
If you want to level as fast as possible then yeah it's a time sink.
---
Otherwise it's alright.
---
Your opinion is by far the minority. Blizz has stated themselves that they want as authentic as possible, down to every last detail, and most of the players agree
---
I think you are misusing the word hypocrite in the post, for starters.  
---
I do think democracy has its flaws and can allow people to impose their will on others, so I would not blindly follow the law no matter what. I'm not the one that first started the dialogue of differentiating between morality and legality. Once I argue the other direction on something people subjectively disagree with, regarding morality, suddenly departing from legality is inherently morally flawed? If we lived in a democracy (that I was born into) and people voted for slavery to be ok, and I tried to free slaves, I would inherently be a hypocrite for disobeying the democracy? (I am not comparing the severity of that to anything we are discussing, so don't act like I am).  
---
I also thought it was inferred we were talking about stealing via a charity.  
---
Are you arguing stealing via a charity pretending to help kids with cancer so you can live in extravagance is actually less immoral than trying to cheat a little bit on taxes when you donate more than the amount you are cheating from the government?  
---
All I'm even questioning here is the equating of these things, we aren't going to convince each other of our very different worldviews.
---
Off specs can are more rare and so when the occasional person makes it work, they shine through.  
---
The first time you'll run in to a spell damage built shockadin, it's really pretty awesome.  
---
Shockadin basically doesn't exist after vanilla,...for shame.
---
About 20g
---
They’re both.
---
Also been addicted to opiates. Classic is a great substitute.
---
&gt;I am totally kidding and trolling, but will continue this troll shit post because some people may have skipped over this last part of the paragraph to comment their disagreements. I don’t blame them, because I would too. But this is something players need to advocate for if they really care about enjoying the vanilla experience, in terms of group finding.
---
Bitch, everyone knew you were trolling from the title alone. Dosen't make the response wrong.
---
Prob till launch ?
---
u can't play raid wow classic and be casual.
---
And play retail.
---
There wont be bgs on release not even Warsong?
---
**Region**: EU   
---
**Language**: English or German   
---
**Server**: Any   
---
**Faction**: Horde   
---
**Class**: Tauren Warrior Tank, probably various alts over the time   
---
**Raid availability**: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Sunday, 19:00-24:00 CEST/CET 
---
**Looking for**: Semi Hardcore (if 2 Raid Days) or Hardcore (if 3-4 Days) Guild. Not that interested in PvP, but sometimes I did a few Battlegrounds for fun. 
---
I am willing to make the commitment for availability that is necesarry for a Tank, meaning being there pretty much every raid day during progress, real life emergencys not withstanding, but in return I also expect that my time will not be wasted (example: wiping on a Boss for weeks on end with no real progress, not because it is too hard, but because people are too stupid and make the same mistakes over and over again) 
---
If TBC also gets rereleased I am 100% on board with that, can take or leave WotLK 
---
I would prefer Loot-Council, but pretty much everything is okay, as long as it is organized and fair.   
---
**Experience**:  
---
Casual in Classic (Started 2 months after release, hit 59 the day before TBC released) (Mage)  
---
TBC\* Hardcore (Kara-Sunwell, 5 days a week on progress) (Healer / Tank)  
---
WotlK\* Semi Hardcore (2-3 days a week, everything except Yogg0 and LK Hc) (Healer / Tank /DPS)  
---
Cata Casual – Semi Hardcore (a few Hc Bosses in each Raid, 2 days a week) (Tank /DPS)  
---
MoP – Semi Hardcore (a few Hc Bosses in each Raid, 2 days a week) (Tank /DPS)  
---
WoD\* – Casual Raiding (a few Mythic Bosses in each Raid, 2 days a week) (Tank /DPS)  
---
Legion\* – Casual Raiding (a few Mythic Bosses in each Raid, 2 days a week) (Tank /DPS)  
---
BfA – managed to the to 115 before quitting  
---
\*amongst the raid leaders during this time
---
I use - 1 Q E R F G C V 2 3 4 5 and then the same again but also with Cntrl. So Cntrl-1, Cntrl-Q etc etc and then the same again but with shift instead of cntrl. Shift-1, Shift-Q etc etc.
---
I have some rules though.
---
1 is always a proc ability, or some kind of instant damaging ability. 
---
Q and E are always my spammables. 
---
C and V are always AoE abilities, extended to 3 and 4 if needed. 
---
Cntrl-2 is ALWAYS my interrupt ability. 
---
Shift-Q is always mobility... 
---
The list goes on but it's strange how I place abilities on my bars. It just 'feels' right when an ability is on a good bind.
---
Hunters are usually top pvp class from 10-60 easily. Dont worry about a tournament in an unfinished form of the game. You will laugh our way out as winner in most encounters
---
When does it supposedly get hard?
---
Aoe everything was less a function of “hey new spells” and more a function of simplified threat mechanics and absurd resilience from tanks. 
---
If you gave me the dankest aoe skills, but I had a real threat of pulling Agro and dying...then I may cc and single target where appropriate. 
---
It doesn’t help than aoe skills became essentially resource free abilities—aoe should sap your mana. But iirc, I could spam dots on 3+ targets and do whatever that aoe mind flag is (it’s been a few years) and never go oom.
---
Ooo that would be tough. I don’t have anything until sept 1st. One day break and then go ham on Labor Day holiday.
---
Both. Hired someone recently to help in my dept. HR put up a post on the website that was nothing but high-falutin’ nonsense. I called them out in it (lit major) and made them change it. We were looking for someone friendly and trainable for entry level pay. Sadly the person we hired is struggling (rip) but most 15 year olds could do this job so I have hope they can get it. (It’s baby accounting/data entry, more or less.) HR was a bigger pain than help with the process though, and the other departments are having the same issue. If you’re trying to hire a truck driver, call them that! I s2g they call them “material placement specialists” and it’s cringey af for everyone...
---
Nice!
---
Obligatory "three fidy".
---
Gotta do what works for you. Who knows if all these people will be able to find a similar schedule for endgame stuff at 60. Join their server if you want, but I wouldn't commit to anything more than that. Play it by ear.
---
Reminds me of this ~ [WoW: 2030](https://i.redd.it/sl6oxto1gpc01.jpg)
---
As opposed to the orcs who found out about Gul'dan and the Burning Legion getting away scot free?
---
Cancel it!
---
sure hope someone will make some sort of version. I need those swaps for boots/helm/offhand etc.
---
Correct blizzard is flat damage from what i can tell.

“Look, I am just, if not more excited than you guys are that Classic is coming out and that we are all planning on playing together when it releases. It will be fun to experience it again and for some of you to experience it for the first time and go through content together. I know the conversations have been pretty focused on min maxing and even using dungeons to level up, and that some folks are already losing some excitement about the class they have been assigned to play. Personally I would rather you play a class you like and are excited about even if it isn’t optimal for the group. I also would rather you have the choice to explore the world and level by questing if you’d prefer not to do dungeons.
---
Regardless of if you want to min max or pace yourself, I’m excited about playing with you all and am happy to use my experience to help if you ask for it. But I felt obligated to say it’s going to ruin our experience if everyone is stuck doing something they aren’t excited about right from the beginning. If you’d rather approach it from a more laid back playstyle you should do that and we will all meet up at 60 anyway, so enjoy it how you want to.”
---
I’d send something like that in a group chat.

This is hilarious.

Is the 30th when classic releases ?
---
Pretty sure have the same answer for 2 questions isn't the end of the world either.  Why do you want to join?  My friends is in your guild.  Do you know any of our guild members?  Yes, Thex.  How hard is that?
---
How many of these posts do we need?
---
I was thinking about this
---
Sounds to me the best course of action is no action, let them be fucking delusional and when they are constantly wiping on shit, try to offer real solutions that rectify the problem.         
---
             
---
You can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink, if your friends are hell bent on being unrealistic with their long term and short term goals theres nothing you can do in the mean time. Just bite your tounge and wait for reality to kick in but if your going Boomkin, reality might kick in for you.
---
Essentially, yes.  I'm still playing some alts on Live here and there.  I have lapsed accounts right now for EQ1+2, GW2, FF, ESO, et al and I'm playing a bit of Neverwinter, but I'm honestly have little investment in anything else I'm playing at the moment.  
---
I may be one of the few people playing less for the nostalgia and more for the old-skool MMO feel.  It feels like a completely different game.  While I do have some nostalgia for early WoW, I played EQ for years before WoW, so I wasn't as blown away by the early game.  
---
Regardless, I'm looking very forward to the slower pace of play, CC in dungeons, more meaningful overland travel, increased social interaction and the very enticing feeling of "new but familiar".
---
i'm excited about hitting on crazy dudes
---
where did you see me say anything about decemeber

And the cow is backpedaling

High octane gameplay

Don't want Classic appearing as a mishmash of vanilla WoW and retail in media.  If I see a video of Classic somewhere, I want to be able to definitively identify it as such by sight alone.
---
Just don't make the mistake I
---
made - gf and I played together for a bit on pserver and I "bossed her around" aka she took forever to do everything and wanted to do every pointless side quest and talk to every single NPC and I wanted to stick to levelling. Didn't end well and she quit WoW lol so my advice, just let her do what she wants and help when she asks but that's it!
---
Perhaps I’m just thinking inside of the box here, but as a member of the software engineering community with extensive guild/raid management experience, I find this hard to believe. Tech is one of the most out-of-the-mainstream-friendly industries that I can think of, and even in tech, a recruiter would laugh in your face when you attempted to explain that bullet on your resume. To the average business deg. graduate, WoW is a game 100% devoid of valuable real world experiences. Sure, perhaps a silver-tongued individual could pull this off with an excellent pitch, but even then, I feel like he/she would run into cultural barriers that would make including such a bullet point on their CV a non-starter.
---
thats the date you posted?
---
He’s reading your date wrong. In some places the month comes second
---
its no crying peon. even the begging to stay was better back then
---
Gear aside, you have magic dust, the murloc net, tidal charm trinket, the pouches off the kurzan camp that remove diseases/poisons, etc. There is also a point in farming tons of low level things for gold. Tons of the content and areas stay relevant even for a lvl 60. Sure if you don't do PVP it's all useless but I do.
---
Hah! I remember my first walk into stormwind... It literally took me 15 mins to get to the bank and back, bc I was getting like 0.5 fps
---
Weird off-pieces of gear being incredibly useful in niche scenarios.
---
I always feel like there’s a goal in mind, always a way to progress further and improve my character.
---
Whilst this may rustle some jimmies I notice a considerable amount of people using casual to describe themselves as a get out of jail free card for failing to live up to their goals and/or hype.
---
These days you see guilds clearing most if not all of Mythic raids and saying they are casual or semi casual. It's a pretty convenient descriptor when you get stuck on a boss and fail to clear a raid. Same goes for semi hardcore, plus wtf does that even mean? You will try really hard but only sometimes?
---
I've also realised that every Mythic guild I've been in just describes themselves as that and the more chilled ones just say things like they want to have fun but focus during raids.
---
Sure you could start a whole semantics debate, no interest in that whatsoever but I have noticed trends in how people twist the definitions of words.
---
oh, understandable, I mean August 8, 2019.
---
Interesting read on Maximizers and Satisticers in there!
---
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
---
Change my mind: You won't make it past BWL/ AQ20.
---
I mean, to be fair, League has always been a mess
---
Have a transparent loot policy. The number one way to disband a guild is hoarding epics for key members without being upfront about it.
---
Yes?
---
Domino sucks
---
You having a stroke?
---
do you remember what the post was titled?
---
I want classic wow just like it was when my young dumb ass was playing it in 2006 I want to farm forever, and I want to earn my stuff.
---
Absolutely. All these other games are fun at times for sure. But they don't build to anything bigger. And climbing a ranking ladder doesn't scratch that itch for me
---
I liked zxcv
---
1 and 2 yes but 3 is ridiculous, I've never done that with a guild.
---
Couple good reasons to go to NE zones include getting a leg up on darnassus rep, and also less competition while leveling when compared to the inevitably crowded elwynn and dun morogh

---
oh he used freedom metrics
---
My favorite part of RP PVP servers, is there’s less likely for popular streamers and elitist jerks to join. It was like this in DAOC and WOW for me. I hope they add one.
---
In most places the month comes second
---
Classic is for people who can't compete at 70.  
---
Try it out :)
---
If you want the best experience, why are you asking about playing on your shit laptop? You know its shit. So whats the point of this thread?
---
Go watch the movie...
---
Lol, yeah
---
it’s not at all though?
---
Literally nobody that cares about their leveling efficiency takes 5/5 in Shadow Focus pre-60(not even the dope ass youtube guides) and it's not even completely useful to get 3 in it, the only reason people do is because it opens up the next tier of Shadow and for some reason people think you need to kill mobs 4-5 levels higher than you to level. 2 points is enough for 2 levels above, as you always are missing 1% chance to hit no matter how much hit you have.
---
The DPME of Mind Blast and Holy Fire are almost identical all the way up, but Holy Fire/Smite get  a 5% increased chance to crit so you could justify not getting any in Shadow Focus and just using Holy Fire/Smite. But if you do want it for when you have excess mana and want to Mind Blast more then you can get 2 points in it at your discretion for mobs 1-2 levels higher than you.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZ0Ex00bZxMb
---
I don't think Shadow pre-40 is terrible, I said it's worse than Holy until Shadowform and I don't think Priest is a top tier leveler like you do, but they are a "solid" leveler. I would never put them in the top leveling bracket though. They don't do enough damage and if you want to kill shit fast(only possible 40+) then you have as much downtime as a mage without the AoE capabilities or utility of portals/food. Wanding is strong from 51-60 if AV is available because of the AV quest wand and after BFD wand from 18-30 you have a shit load of wand damage.
---
The thing is, 80% of the time you'll be wanding so all we're comparing is the 20% of the time you have full mana and want to burn through some of it to not be wasting potential damage. In those few cases you have the extra crit and reduced cast time of the stronger abilities.
---
what if everyone are twinks and there is no gear advantage?
---
As a Druid? Unlikely. It’s a fantastic leveling experience past 10.
---
Yeah what the other replying here said, go for it! Where there's a will there's a way! What is there to lose, really?
---
That wasn't exactly my experience when the TBC patch for wow came out way back when. Everything seemed to be doing more damage, not just crusader strike. My experience is purely anecdotal
---
Never
---
Hopefully zones and is items and spells instead.
---
Lots of great starter vids on lemonparty.org.
---
If you’re willing to put in the work and have good verbal and written communication skills then you absolutely can.  I started a guild from absolute scratch on a private server and had it running like a well oiled machine by the time we got to raiding.  Be prepared to put a ton of effort into recruiting (forum posts, Discord posts, in game advertising, etc.) and be ready for the game to become a full time job if your guild is going to raid.  I lasted about 6 months before stepping back and realizing that I dreaded having to login to the game and deal with guild admin tasks more than I dreaded having to go to work every day.  It’s not something I’ll ever do again, but it did give me a whole new level of respect for guild leaders which has turned me into a better member due to my new found perspective for sure.
---
if my pally is healing you through a dungeon on the way up to 60, you bet your ass I’m needing on the 2 hander I’ll need when I’m out in the world.
---
Yea idk I played vanilla for a bit less than 2 years and I either got ganked once or camped for hours at a time.
---
3 months\* :P
---
This - I personally think you have to run a DKP system but have it all on a public document so everyone can scrutinize it.
---
With a loot council it just becomes far too difficult to tell who deserves loot. And the pauses between each drop is so utterly insane that there has to be some player control.
---
Oh, so the loot trading will only be in raids? Awesome.
---
I hope they don't count UBRS.
---
*Blacksmithing intensifies*
---
I knew it was common, wasn’t sure specifically all where it’s written that way
---
&gt;Also wow vanilla doesn’t have toxicity; it has “drama”. Lots and lots of drama...
---
I think a lot of you are in for a rude awakening.
---
10/10 Good tutorial would recommend.
---
But what are YOU going to play?
---
Now imagine your surprise when you realize that balance is actually quite a strong PvP spec.
---
If you had a lot of gold you'd use it to...  
---
Get an epic mount before others  
---
Buy rep for another races mounts.  
---
Buy an epic mount off of the AH like krol blade or that dank frost mage ring  
---
Invest the gold in to ways which you think might make you more gold
---
In tech in the US it's also done to create openings for H1B visa employees that conveniently don't need paying the going rate.
---
'Every person and their mother thinks they can run a guild'... until the first drama shitfest occurs because they don't actually have a clue how to manage people.
---
Won't you have like zero reputation if you just level in dungeons?
---
So you may want to inform yourself before throwing shit around. In response:
---
Twinks play against other twinks. You clearly ARE a retail player since you don't seem to realise the thriving twink community that has existed throughout WoW. Stop injecting your own motives ("beat on randoms") into an argument. All it does it show you mindset and what you would use multiboxing for. 
---
And for the second PvP point. Yes, it is fair if I turret in AV. I can do the same with four friends and have done so on servers that don't allow multi-boxing. Again, this just shows you're mindset, that you're unable to make friends and party up!
---
This is also showing your retail baby mentality. You will be one shot by a single well geared PoM Pyro mage in vanilla. You will be ganked by a skilled rogue and not be able to fight back, one on one. 
---
Vanilla isn't fair, stop imposing your own "ethics" into a video game, snowflake.
---
It seems my post wasn't clear enough judging from the replies. I am not saying that PvP is boring and will make people stop playing. I am talking about of the group of people that will test Classic and will stop playing within three months. I am talking about the bias in selecting a type of servers this group of "Classic tourists" is expected to have.
---
This sounds like a very good way of paying for subs, thanks for the suggestion!
---
So... Is the game over or what? The Burning Legion was the only real threat, ever, right? Old Gods, maybe? Although we did clap a couple already.
---
Apparently you can't even set the price of tokens. You can't see the player either.
---
Im excited that im older now and at a point where i can still no life it :D
---
Not every discussion consists of points and counterpoints, I'm simply expressing my thoughts about the topic too. You're probably only interested in winning internet arguments like everyone else; with political views set in stone. Hope you have good day man.
---
I'm pretty sure reading your post just gave me herpies.
---
I planned to play SP in my current guild, but then I realized "Oh, if I don't make the requirements to get to 60 after 30 days I'll be guildless"
---
And that just made me say no, if you don't lock your spot in BEFORE the guild gets up and running I don't see how you'd realistically find a guild as strictly shadow.
---
Because the spot is wanted by so bleeding many, once a spot opens up in a serious guild the chances are a holy priest has half a bis set because he's wanted to play shadow for so long.
---
Even if you are the best shadowpriest you can be, you can't really be one if you don't get invited to dungeons and raids. So you'd have to scramble in pugs, roll healer and raid fairly casually to be able to get into a guild.
---
... I would imagine, because I'm not entirely sure. But because most high-end guilds want 1 SP for each warlock group, you'd likely only want 1 or 2 per raid (with the higher chance of being 1)
---
And, well... You don't do damage in raids, you keep shadow weaving up while eating up more consumables than anyone else. You wont use SW:P, you'll use mind flay and mind blast and chug mana potions and demonic runes till kingdom come.
---
You have to ask yourself "Why do I wanna play shadow priest", and if the answer fits into the role a SP has in classic, then you should go for it.
---
No. Yes overall you will get more money but I'd rather have the gold early when you need it. And the longer you wait the more leather will be on the market. I'll probably save heavy leather and maybe hides and special scales and stuff.
---
That's unfortunate imo
---
Sounds cool, I can see things like Winterspring rep raid working well too.
---
how old are you? serious question
---
I literally want to start a guild called The Weak now for anyone who has read this far that thinks this guy is pandering to the “Alpha male” veiled Internet bullying for angry and unfulfilled young white boys.
---
I usually don't  kill greys (except gnomes) but boi, if you gank me when i'm lvling i'm going to fucking remember your name,class,lvl,race and your stupid fucking face and at some point in the game we will inevitably meet again and i'll use every fkning cd i have for you. Might seem like toxic behavior to someone who never played classic but that's one of the strongest features classic has to offer. Not only do you meet new friends and nice people but you'll run into some jackass and you're gonna hate him so much that you're going to drop whatever you were doing and try to kill that fucker even if that means getting clobbered to death by some ugly goblins.
---
Just a  beautiful cycle of hatred.
---
If you want to participate in the stress test, then by 2pm EST on August 8th, if not but want to reserve your 3 names, then by 6pm EST August 12th, if not then by 6pm EST August 26th when the game launches.
---
Casters get Armor/Dodge/Crit from Agility as well. 6 intellect (90 mana) on a low level caster who relies on base values and not spell damage, is much better than the AP/Crit a melee class get from 2 AP.
---
nice assumption, how about those 10 v 10 twinks premades? Cant wait to corpse farm nabs like you &lt;3 peace and love
---
I hope  you will not be the one "less geared" on 60s vs cryin about getting rekt by "60 twinks premades" on spawn, take care and enjoy the game.
---
You are clearly passionate. However, you need to realise how bad RP-PVP sounds from a business perspective:
---
&gt;Hello Blizzard.
---
&gt;* Look at this poll with a pretty pie chart that shows 1415 players want RP-PVP.
---
&gt;* Look at this RP-PVP forum thread that got a lot of likes. Certainly NO sympathy Likes. Pressing a Like button means you want to play RP-PVP, NOT that you just wouldn't mind if someone else got a RP-PVP server. Oh, and a whopping 483 people responded to the thread.
---
&gt;These two facts, plus some random vague other factors I can't be bothered to document: It's now proven beyond doubt that the demand for RP-PVP is high.
---
If you were a company and received a message like that, where someone links random polls (that are actually kind of an own goal when you think about it) and equates flimsy Likes to Purchases 1:1... How would you react?
---
What?! Fuck him! First day abandoned us and then he sold us out to the alliance! Garage and Silvana have been far better Warchiefs than that pansy!
---
I probably won't either for everything but will need to actually read for the details on what to do.
---
Yes. Play the stress test on the 8th.
---
wiping is part of vanilla, and wiping is the result of someone fucking up. take responsibility for your actions. apologize
---
be punctual
---
When in doubt... Mongoose Juice...
---
**Yours Truly**
---
*Every Hunter Ever*
---
If you're a New Player, don't bother Mix/Maxing.
---
Just show up and enjoy the game. You can roll your face on the keyboard for most of the content with 40 players unbuffed.
---
Such triggering post. You know that one can play smart and play little and still clear all content, right?
---
You can clear BWL+MC in 3 hours and AQ40 in 3 hours. You don't need more than 1/2 raid days for most part of classic.
---
Casual guilds are ones progressing 3 days a week 4 hours each raid because they get stuck because no one in raid gives a shit about anything. You DO NOT want to be in those guilds.
---
Shaman?!
---
Well if I had your worldview I would also be depressed, you seem like a sad person.
---
It is obvious you are not a lawyer or you would understand how the US Supreme Court views the juxtaposition of Free Speech to Offensive Speech.
---
Here is are some cases to reference: Matal v. Tam (2017) / Terminiello v. Chicago (1949) / Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) / National Socialist Party v. Skokie (1977) / R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992) / Virginia v. Black (2003)
---
In each of these cases the court upheld that Free speech &gt; You being offended.
---
I say again for the third time... no one sought you out or made comments to you... You chose to comment on my post. You sought "confrontation on the internet".  No one confronted you.  You were confronted in your own mind because you can not handle the idea of someone who does not think like you or agree with you.
---
NOW BUZZ OFF
---
Bitch you tryna die like Judy Garland?
---
PLOT TWIST: all the big streamers join the RP-PvP server.
---
OP made a thread wondering if guilds would give him loot priority for Sulfuras, then proceeded to petulantly declare that he would create his own raiding guild dedicated to the purpose of giving him the first Sulfuras. 
---
I guess this thread is his low key way of admitting that was a stupid ass venture.
---
I'd argue that it's just a less-extreme version of someone who's hardcore/dedicated. An actual casual will on average have maybe 2 hours a night, sometimes on a free night 3 to play. That's if they get to be on the computer at all; I know lots of the original game's base are now in their late 20's/30's, which often means kids, spouses, pets, jobs, school, obligations.   
---
4 hours would be casual if you're on that NEET life.
---
To be added later, but resto can copy Druid for the most part.
---
You don't think a poll about a game that isn't even out yet might be slightly biased towards the most devoted and hyped players (the very type of people who are most likely to roll on pvp servers)?
---
they dont only in 20 and 40 raids
---
RIGHT!! 😂😂😂
---
What does honor have to do with anything? If I can stabs, i stabs.
---
I leave sept 10 to a once in a life time trip to Scotland
---
Yep.  I played a bit after Legion had been out for awhile, and felt all this.  Got a few toons up to cap, and lost interest.  The graphics are good, the animations wonderful.   The story was kickass, and quest were really interesting and varied.  But it all meant jack because I never died, or was under any threat of dying.  I never made a tough gear choice, because there weren't any to make.  I never tried a different spell rotation, because it was obvious which one I was supposed to use.  In short, it felt like a neat story that I was watching rather than playing.    
---
Blizzard certainly put some polish and got really good at story telling.  It's just too bad that they forgot how to make the game fun as well.
---
Hi, /u/Kryme-

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cmx9pg/what_will_actually_happen_on_august_27/). 
---
how is any of that even remotely close to dying? :S
---
This is valuable advice, you can do all of MC and ZG like this. Most of BWL too. AQ and Naxx take a bit of finesse.
---
Imagine being this American
---
hah, nice try. i dont go to parties
---
*bleed
---
THANK YOU for this.
---
I'm a semi-casual player.  I'll play for a few hours every single day, several hours a few days a week.  I am excited as hell for WoW Classic.  All that being said...
---
With exception of Naxx, I've raided all this content before.  I've played these classes, finished these questlines and attacked these battlegrounds.  I'm coming back to Classic to just experience it again after 12 years away, so I can take it all back in.  I'm not trying to world-first some shit that was world-firsted back in 2005, but it seems way too many people are.
---
I'd like to find a semi-serious guild, but not be held to some of these weird *'plan on being raid ready by ___'* schedules I've seen posted by so many 'casual' guilds.  I'm going to take my time and finish my favorite zones and work on my professions and just kinda play at my own pace.  I'd *like* to be able to do that without joining up with whatever server's version of &lt;Bloodbath &amp; Beyond&gt; trash guild that every server is full of, but I haven't seen much of that being advertised.
---
Maybe there will be more of that happening organically when the game is finally out.  Maybe we can find enough players from this post that we can all start something ourselves, who knows.
---
It was 14 years ago, hell if I remember the reason
---
As hesitant as I am about it, I agree with the DKP system to an extent; like you said, it rewards players coming back to raid with you, and keeping a rotation of alts in the guild to assist in other raids as well. It's like being a part of a membership program with loyalty points, and ensures that eventually you'll get an item, even if you have trash luck.
---
I see your /gquit and raise you forcing a twink ding.
---
I think you're starting to catch onto the reason guild applications exist.
---
Really? Is it that much? I didn't realize it was that good.
---
No meme specs.
---
What's the song I'm fully using that to gank in the bgs
---
Shit in one hand and guarantee in the other, poll which pile is bigger at the end of the day.
---
If we're only talking endgame:
---
Mage does slightly more damage and offers utility to the group with very little personal effort (food/water conjuration). Mages are common due to being useful, relatively easy to gear (not that the warlock is different on that point) for a popular class, and good in pvp.
---
Warlock does slightly less damage. It does however offer utility to the group at the expense of personal farming done outside raids in the form of summons and soulstone consumables. Soulstones also eat away 1-2 bags worth of space, so you're losing QoL on that as well.
---
Both are viable ranged DPS and shouldn't have trouble getting raid spots in any non-hardcore guild. In hardcore/super picky guilds warlocks will be in high demand until they have the handful they need for the utility and then they'll prefer mages. When I was sifting through recruitment posts, both had demand although usually a guild wouldn't be missing both.
---
Mostly flavour, but would you like slightly more damage + less out of raid work, or more team utility (if your guild isn't overfilled on warlocks) with QoL cost and added effort required.
---
This actually isn't a bad idea. You're getting downvoted to hell because people see "change" and they freak out. In reality we're gonna be using 1.12 talents, skills and gear in 1.1 content making it e z p z. Far easier than it actually was. 
---
Look at druids skills and talents from 1.1 and tell me they were just as good as 1.12. bear have half the armour and hurricane/innervate were their 31 point talents. 
---
Something like this would be a tiny step on the right direction to make the game less of a complete roll feat for the first 4-5 phases.
---
A bit, but rested xp only effects kills, not quests, and it takes 6 days of not playing to get a level of rested.
---
Yeah 1-40
---
You should always play to your outs, sometimes it doesn't work out and you might have a rogue who enters AQ with a 40 dps dagger, but that doesn't mean it's not the right move.
---
Live to win.
---
Hunters and Warriors are  OP in both PVE/ PVP situations when mastered.  For faceroll OP with less skill cap please see Rouge and Mage.
---
Haha I'm so pumped for stv!! Gonna roll hunter again, can't wait for pitiful rogues to try their best at ganking me
---
Still no argument, huh?
---
It's not about what we need, it's about what we deserve
---
Exact same but reversed, lol.
---
I think some peoples goals for classic are admirable, but honestly I see way more people getting burnt out on the game after 1 or 2 months rather than playing for vanilla for years the way it was intended.
---
Bro I can't see you!
---
I'm right next to the vendor! Are you blind?
---
People join guilds for more reasons than raiding aspirations.
---
Part of my experience in vanilla, and the most standout memories I carried with me from then were the guild.  We never got our shit together and raided, we just all hung out, played WoW and had fun.  That's all a lot of people are looking for.  When I see 'casual guild', that's what I think of.  It's not unreasonable to find a group of like-minded people before the game launches to have a good time leveling up with.
---
I think you need special help.
---
Debatable.
---
If there were arenas in vanilla, sure
---
What is this "we" thing?
---
What an awful human being you are.  Glad that guild dodged you with a simple question.  Weeding out the sociopaths is exactly the point, mission accomplished I'd say.
---
We will watch his career with great interest.
---
Even if someone is afk in there, not going to be much of an impact, the game is going to be a zerg again.
---
Hey guys. 
---
Always nice to see people from the old Bloodscalp crew. 
---
I played Koshy the dwarf warrior. We met in some BG-s with our pvp team. Was always nice going against you guys. 
---
Stay strong SWE crew, good to hear you added Cass, Cruni and Brevi as well.
---
Anyone from the old Nightwatchers guys maybe? They were from the nordics as well.
---
That's not a kids-specific thing. Most adults watch utter crap too and it's adults giving so much money to streamers.
---
Now you will see the true power of the dark side!
---
I just hope the name Thax isn't taken
---
Haha I totally feel you! I'm like 90% set on hunter, that's what I played at original launch. Would be fun to try something new of course but the nostalgia is strong..
---
That's awesome I'm going to have to go skinning now. How much would you make from 40 to 60 then?
---
This comment here.
---
For anyone reading, this comment guarantees classic will be a success and the subreddit will be 1 giant meme.
---
not really- its the core of the game for me, i love it and cant wait to get into mc/bwl
---
How is that not an MMO, "buddy"?
---
I'm not saying classic should be changed, it is how it is. However I don't see the benefit of forcing people to PvE if they only want to PvP.
---
The same as I shouldn't be forced to PvP to get a good offhand for my Rogue when I only want to PvE.
---
Buddy.
---
Sure that works for some peeps. But for me personally it’s no fun if there’s no fighting back. It’s just sad at that point haha
---
just say "stop micromanaging let me/them play how and what we want" 
---
if you can't do that to your friends without drama, friends might not be the right definition
---
Found the guy who doesn't actually have a point and only wants to insult people.
---
FyreDinklage
---
Oh shit. I completely forgot about that. Alabama plays Duke that day.
---
If you've ever played private servers this is how everyone thinks.
---
I was the same way until I picked up Stardew Valley again, but this time on the switch for work travel. I can't put it down.
---
They said not at launch but considering a later release if there's interest in it.
---
Asmongold is in Texas which is EST
---
Wait, how does one do that?
---
I think I've seriously considered every single class.
---
Tell him we are gathering the troops.
---
Ulath, Xsi, Parabellum, Odlan, Crow, Hajen, Donkaa, Mardrøm, Tyraell, Umbra, Nurf, Notte, Doss, Fern, Ginga, Clerc, Pyta, Raging, Sitron, Tuck, Madjack, Sumerian, Robin,
---
Come with him, there gonna be one amazing bbq next year
---
It's in.
---
Haha same for me! Temporary distraction but ended up just being more psyched. Both good and bad, I guess.
---
Mage, or hunter are pretty easy to pick up I'd say (hard to master though)
---
Already been confirmed.
---
Was vanilla the funniest era of wow videos? Im starting to think so.
---
LOL was waiting for someone to post this.
---
Sent you a private message
---
If you love OSRS you already have the taste for long excruciating grinds, you will feel at home in classic Wow
---
I'd say "Calm your tits, guys" and that's about it. Nobody knows if the others will keep playing the   game or who plays how serious or who rerolls
---
Considering we’ve known the date for name reservations for... how long now? Weeks? Months? I’d say at some point, that’s no longer Blizzards fault.
---
But I moreso believe that the intent is to leave it open, but they didn’t commit to it in the post *in case something happens and they have to close it*. Those posts are generally crafted in a way that’ll give them an out if necessary. When they lock in the information with a promise or certainty, they’d get a lot of flak for backing out.
---
My guild choice will be based on that one dude that I party with and knock out a few quests with at low level. Yeah man, now you're my g, I'll join your guild and we'll rock it
---
This is why you make a guild for your and your friends to shit around in. Others are absolutely welcome. No raiding planned. Just casual PCP, casual questions and grouping for dungeons and shit. But no set raid schedule or schedule of any kind. 
---
Inevitably half of your members will leave for more organized, endgame guilds but in that case you wish them well and continue enjoying the game your way and dink around all day while they sink the hundreds of hours a week they want to sink. There is room for both guilds.
---
Depends on your serves AH, you only vendor up to Thick Leather
---
you are so full of shit lol- i played vanilla and my guild hauled ass to get into raiding and went hard all through to naxx, then rerolled when oceanic servers came out and did the same. there were many guilds like us. Plenty of people have always enjoyed competitive end game content pushing ever since day 1.
---
you are talking about your own journey.
---
It will most likely be slightly horde dominated overall due to pvp racials.
---
The list from the guy posting about an hour ago wasn't good enough for you?
---
They have plenty of ways to fight back. Learn how to slip away from a camp. Ask for help in general. Bribe someone to help. Call in your entire guild to destroy this person's life until they bring in their own guild. Large battle and ensues. Or just take it out on their spouse.
---
Wasn't there another thread asking this exact same question a few hours ago?
---
Alliance had it easier in earlier phases because of pallies. But once Horde had the location advantage of Warchiefs + AQ it started to sway to horde in later phases. Being completed by the BE getting pallies. 
---
I think for the most part it will play out similar, as enough time has lapsed where the newer WoW players will fall in the same Alliance trap us retailers fell in all those years ago. 
---
TLDR: Yes.
---
That sounds nice tbh. I do hope to be 60 well before January though.
---
thats boomers for ya
---
i can’t wait for youtube drama videos and guildies crying in discord recordings
---
Yeah I remember pushing so hard late into the night at the Alliance brigde but never make it through. Wake up a couple of hours later and the same game was still on! Don't remember when this was, I can't remember any Honor?
---
Getting levels doesn't really make it easier, though of course sweeping strikes/dear wish are big power spikes for leveling.
---
What makes it easier is equipment.  Getting blue weapons at or above your level makes the diff.
---
I've been planning and advertising my guild for the last three months. We are casual and don't expect to raid in the first 3-6 months. It's the lack of interest that's proving difficult, as Discord, reddit and forums are full of no-lifers wanting to go hardcore.
---
Honestly, even bad pizza is good pizza. I’ve never met a pizza I don’t like.
---
honestly unless you want to run a twink no reason for gold
---
Changing these things for the people who "didn't have time" is how we got to BfA.
---
Nope, no LFG. Don't care how busy your life is. Set aside the time when you can to form that group.
---
You sound like you and your friend would fit in with our group very well. how do you feel about Saturday and Sunday 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. raid hours? only catch other than that is that we are on PVP servers.
---
I actually have a good guild now vs playing solo.
---
&gt;Debatable
---
Usually, people would follow this up with an actual rebuttal.
---
I’ve said it twice already, and I’m over the semantic wars aren’t funny anymore. I wish you the best, buddy.
---
wtf is up with this question every day, piss off use a random name generator or something if you are braindead.
---
AoE grinding was a thing in Vanilla despite the melee range. It just required a higher skill cap. Which is a good thing IMO
---
&gt;mandatory
---
Yeah, nah
---
Warriors are very gear dependant and would likely be unsatisfying to someone who can't put in the time to really max them out and play in their glory stage.
---
Sounds to me like you'd probably enjoy druid more. Feral druids have a reputation of being uncompetitive without the gnomeragon consumable, but you can always go full resto focus if you struggle tanking in the hybrid build. Resto druids don't seem to get a lot of flak, and it's a simple respect to move to that if your feral plans get too frustrating.
---
the majority of texas is central time
---
You sound like you would fit in pretty well with our outfit. How do you feel about Saturday Sunday 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. raid times? If you think that's makeable we should chat.
---
It's working as intended for at least PvP. It's the same way it has been or private servers.
---
When lh got new realm me with my friend leveled duo warrior/pala, it was extremely fun we killed alot horde, even two 60 mages that ganking around tanaris when we was on level 45 or something. 
---
But when i played alone it was soo boring and frustrated, low dmg while solo or bad tanks in dungeons. 
---
Duh. 
---
I mainly played on a mage i enjoyed, so i think i will go mage in classic as main character. 
---
Not the best synergy, but mage fit me more. 
---
Btw I raided on all classes in bwl/mc content, not all fun for me, but other people enjoy them alot. 
---
Soooo try what fit ideally for you.
---
I'm using Oveatha
---
There ain't exactly a lot of competition among pve dagger rogues, swords are the main spec for a reason.
---
Any reasonable guild would prioritize a dagger upgrade to a dagger rogue over a sword rogue.
---
My Dominos guy would get a bigger tip if he was wearing a cape. Just saying.
---
To be fair, people on the internet are usually trying to correct you so easy mistake to make lol
---
Cannibal: the Musical?
---
Sure you can ask for help but there’s no fight initially and that’s not fun to me. That’s what I was trying to get across.
---
Poggers? Maybe I'm just too old
---
I see a lot of people asking for resto druids in guild recruitment, mind you that's hardcore guilds.
---
I think it's just the tanking side that gets the hate.
---
Is this a troll?  
---
Warrior trinket doesn't break seduce.. and FAP only works on stuns roots and slows..
---
foot pedals for shift/ctrl/alt modifiers !
---
Oh yes, so much yes.  If addiction is what you seek, wow classic will be a conduit to months of obsession and pursuit of 1s and 0s.  It is fantastic
---
I'm not sure I follow, could you rephrase that? English is not my native language.
---
Isnt the take-away from all this that you have to run circles around AOE packs rather than kiting them in a straight line?
---
It's working as intended and mages can still aoe farm.
---
I leveled my rogue alt 51-60 grinding harpies in the cave.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7862
---
is it though?
---
You can bind some spells to a key that’s on a bar you’ve hidden. That way you can’t click them but HAVE to hit the binding. Slowly add more skills to this bar until you’ve a plethora of abilities bound and can comfortably handle.
---
Remember, you don’t need everything bound. You don’t need a keybinding for every form of portal and teleport on a mage. Many abilities that are rarely used or have really long cooldowns can just be clicked.
---
&lt;3 yusssss
---
I just did this. I had never understood why World of Warcraft was the way it is leading into Vanilla, but after playing these it makes a bunch of sense. And the game was surprisingly challenging on a few missions even on the normal difficulty. I second this suggestion!
---
It's probably not.  Look at the guy's post history that he's replying to.  All the dude does is shit talk people for anything.  He's a garbage shit talker.
---
If it helps, i started playing WoW in 2006 after years of RuneScape which was my big game other than console stuff. Suffice it to say i think you really will enjoy WoW Classic. I remember watching this video way back in the day: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sug4QLrwk-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sug4QLrwk-Y) ...definitely sold me on it for sure! Other videos like Leeroy Jenkins, or the South Park episode...the game is amazing, man.

Blizzard is literally drowning in money. There's no way they have 12 million subs, but they definitely have more than 2 million. There is a really good reason why the WoW team is so massive and its because it generates a metric fuck ton of cash every single month. Classic WoW will just make it way better for them than how great they were doing already. I'd bet that the sub numbers are between 2-4 million.
---
Like someone said about horde, leveling as a paladin hordeside in tbc was fantastic, the new quests for quel thalas were really well done compared to the scatter shot made of standard classic questing. Also the new talents were game changing. Overall things were much much easier, especially once you hit ~55
---
&gt;should I try WoW Classic when it comes out?
---
&gt;Is wow going to make me rekindle my love for eating doritos and red bull
---
&gt;s it a waste of time?
---
1 week? I haven't logged in since 2009. Hype is on.
---
Modern WoW is the chick who is absolutely aesthetically gorgeous but has the blandest personality possible. And is a socialist.
---
Says you.
---
So people are downvoting the comments giving this person compliments, and saying it’s cringe... do these people not realize how “cringe” they themselves are being. That word needs to die along with the negativity.
---
Classic is almost here and I’m hyped af! Ain’t got time to hate. Nerd out! Rock out with your cock out! We’re going back fuckers!
---
&gt;Gear is literally thrown at you
---
This was one of the things that led me to quit. I believe it was in the last xpac where they had that island with epic gear literally on the ground for you to pick up.
---
I really don't think you have anything to worry about until we hit Phase 2. As you said, most people reaching 60 quickly will have done so with the intention of getting ahead of the gear and economy curve or because they love speed leveling and will quickly quit, not because they wanted to spend a week on 4 hours of sleep to kill lowbies in Redridge.
---
That said, when Phase 2 begins I could see it getting fairly toxic with level 50s giving honor and being essentially forced to funnel into kill zones in the Plaguelands etc.
---
Pretend you're a real life girl. Get free stuff. Worked in vanilla. One of my guildmates got their epic mount like that. Then got found out. But they already had their mount. Scary funny, honestly.
---
Pizza is a lot like sex....
---
you have good sex and bad sex. But still, bad sex is still sex

&gt;I'm sure at end-game the game play varies a lot between the two

I have bad news for you...
---
That’s it haha.

Yes and no?

I love how community involvement is so high. Such success!

Big difference is the gear progression system.  In classic, it's much more structured and slow - when you are raiding 40 mans.. well the gear is being split 40 ways.  That's basically your "60 only" cutoff, as the dungeons are all 50-60, as far as blue usable gear goes.  It will take a loooong time to fully gear a character will all raid gear, especially seeing as phase 1 will last some months.  Compare to retail, and even at BFA launch you could gear up a character will full 340 (mythic dungeon, pre raid BIS) with just running warfronts, and finish gearing in a day.  It felt terrible, because it invalidated even max level content (why bother running heroics if you already are far beyond the rewards?)  Sure, eventually a great number of people will be 60+ geared out in retail, especially with PVP gear, but it will last exponentially longer than the current retail state.  Not to mention gearing more than 1 character, the leveling portion remains relevant for anyone looking to play multiple alts for a long time.
---
Clearly Blizzard wants to make Classic as much like Vanilla as possible so that they can start off on a good footing with the #nochanges crowd, but they said "everything is on the table" going forward so we'll likely see changes made to lag compensation mechanics and such (maybe in a few months at first though).
---
They have homogenised classes a lot. It's sad fact but if you want to keep every class and spec actually viable then this is what you have to do. Or at least it is the easiest way to do it. Their philosophy is now more that they want players to play class/spec they really like. I am totally looking forward to get into classic in many reasons but it's just fact that class/spec balance is just absolutely horrible in Classic. It's not perfect now but at least every class and spec is playable on high end content.
---
For me retail and classic are two completely different games and both do have their advantages. With retail I have huge amount of content I can do with multiple characters. Retail currently is more straightforward game than it's massive online world. Of course I miss old days and that's why I am happy we are getting classic. I think both games can co exists and it's up to player's preference if they want to play classic, retail or both. I am personally going to enjoy both games.

Huh...TIL
---
It still worked in cata tbf, I stopped using the AH after that because gold cap was dead easy in WoD and Legion, I also doubt more than 1/5 use an auction add-on even today. 
---
I'm not defending gold selling either, just stating items with a high trade volume do trade substantially over their value at points making legitimate flagging harder. If a grey item rarely traded goes for 1k you can safely assume RWT but in the case of high volume trade goods human error is a factor and selling a bunch of linen at 10x it's value isn't proof enough.
---
I know!! I never seems to work when I’m an orc Lol
---
It seems like a lot of that has been dying down in the past few years. Companies are realizing that there’s a lot of corruption and false certificates coming out of the countries they’ve been trying to outsource to. You can end up with a “certified engineer” who can barely turn on a computer.
---
Wouldn't bother me. Most people who try it get bored after 2-3 kills anyway. It takes a truly depraved person to legitimately enjoy it and fortunately they're pretty rare.
---
avoidstreamers.com , it even lists approximate influence they will have.
---
I mean there is a middle ground. You can not worry so much that every single member is the right race/spec and has full consumables, while still expecting people to pay the fuck attention. You can not worry so much about people being on five nights a week but still expect people to know what they’re doing when they’re in there. Or to at least be able to pay attention to a brief explanation and grasp it. 
---
I remember in Wrath our guild fell into a category we liked to call “casually hardcore”. We knew our class, we were gemmed/enchanted, we knew the fights and we showed up on time. But we only raided once or twice a week and had no requirements of how often you had to be online otherwise. We had no requirements that you had to be a specific spec, or whatever else. 
---
Ultimately I think most “casuals” intend to be in this middle ground but everyone’s just talking past each other.

Because trying to do organized RPPVP on a regular pvp server between factions will just lead to regular pvp players ruining and disrupting the rp for honor kills and just griefing.

I could not agree more with you suspicious_lemons !

I could not have written a more direct and explicit example of "what we are looking for in a player" and "what we seek to avoid" than to have had this debate with you publicly!
---
Thank you again for taking the time to attempt to publicly shame me for seeking free thinking and free speech loving individuals.  Together we have made my points in a far stronger fashion than I was able to do on my own.

Good Luck !

What does that do?

The timing was just too good with release...
---
If you never played it: Waste of time. Period. IT can't live up to modern gaming. IT has so many fundemental flaws that the only way you really enjoy it is.
---
1. Nostalgia.
---
2. You're an outlier. Something like 1-5% of new players.
---
So did I! I cant wait.
---
Hit me up if you want a chill Alliance guild. It's easier to make new friends than try to change old ones.

&gt;retail baby
---
cmon, using meme fotm insults doesn't look good on your part. despite what you have convinced yourself, i do not play "retail"
---
&gt;And for the second PvP point. Yes, it is fair if I turret in AV. I can do the same with four friends and have done so on servers that don't allow multi-boxing. Again, this just shows you're mindset, that you're unable to make friends and party up!
---
except that would require 5 people controlling 5 characters, which is fine ofc. also your defense doesn't hold up in world pvp. 
---
i already have a group of friends i'm playing with...which is irrelevant to whether or not i would find a problem with it since my reasons are not grounded in personal bias.  also just more baseless insult and assumptions on your part, which you seem to love.
---
&gt;Twinks play against other twinks.
---
not exclusively. and no good pvp players play twinks for a reason.
---
&gt;This is also showing your retail baby mentality. You will be one shot by a single well geared PoM Pyro mage in vanilla. You will be ganked by a skilled rogue and not be able to fight back, one on one.
---
yeah...and that is 100% fine and the whole point of an mmo. they aren't abusing multiple characters and using a 3pp to gain an advantage through means outside of the game itself. i don't really care about twinks really since i'm not going to step foot in a bh outside of lvl 60 so that doesn't matter, i just think it is pointless and stupid.
---
&gt;snowflake.
---
stop with the snowflake, i feel embarrassed for you. 
---
&gt;Vanilla isn't fair, stop imposing your own "ethics" into a video game, snowflake.
---
reducing the point to "fair vs not fair" is a suitable way for you to defend anything, pretty much
---
so would botting be ok because "vanilla is not fair"? well no, that doesn't seem to hold up to well anymore
---
would using 3pp to gain an advantage over another player be fair? well no, wait...
---
That would mean 1/3 of leveling content would be free. Since leveling is much slower it could be weeks before you reach the “trial” cap. 
---
No, I don’t think there will be a free trial at all.
---
There is an exploit, I'm not sure if it still works and its only offered sometimes. Basically if you do the "2 medium 2 toppings for 5.99 each" deal, sometimes they will offer to let you "upgrade" one of those 2-toppings to a "specialty" pizza for $2 more. If you accept the deal, you can select any specialty pizza, and adjust the toppings however you want without increasing the price above $7.99. 
---
I did it once, I ended up with like 8 toppings (extra everything), double extra cheese, and alfredo sauce. Shit would have costed like $22. It was incredibly disgusting and I would never do it again, but I was amazed that it worked.
---
Diseases are fucking stupid in general if you aren't a class who can cleanse them.
---
The one you catch from the stealthed wolves in Hinterlands that puts a very slow ticking dot on you. 
---
The one that lasts THIRTY FUCKING MINUTES that you catch off of the owl beasts in Winterspring. I think it takes a huge chunk of your primary stat off.
---
The one from the plagued ghouls in EPL that was a similar effect to the one above.

This is why I never join guilds with applications. I’d much rather join through the game organically. People take shit too seriously sometimes

---
Diseases should last until dispelled.
---
When the curse in SFK removes you weapon skill and no one can dispell it
---
He basically rotates through all these debuffs:
---
Brood Affliction: Red (Disease) - 50 Fire damage/3s. Heals Chromaggus on death.
---
Brood Affliction: Green (Poison) - Healing reduced by 50%, 250 Nature damage every 5 seconds.
---
Brood Affliction: Blue (Magic) - Movement slowed by 70%. Casting speed reduced by 50%. 50 mana and 1 health drained per second.
---
Brood Affliction: Black (Curse) - Fire Damage increased by 100%.
---
Brood Affliction: Bronze - 4 second stun at random intervals for 10 minutes. Can only be removed with Hourglass Sand.
---
The only fight that will have your Ranged DPS and Healers get into a straight up argument about despelling LOL
---
I’d join durotar, for the horde until the end!
---
I'm the same way. Cant even sit on discord with my friends cause I'm so hell bent on classic wow that I cant even think about another game. Been trying to find a good single player game to abide my time. So far its wolfenstein 2. On a side note I am ashamed of how many classic wow videos I've watched. My YouTube history for the past few weeks is nothing other than constant wow classic videos. (Shout out to madseason, hirumardx, and punkrat!)
---
Sorry my friend, can you please show me on this doll where i touched you? Because it clearly seems that i hit a sensitive point with my post. 
---
I might not become the best pvp'r out there, but at least i will be trying and not be a coward who hides behind twinking denying the reality. 
---
I bet in other games you have a dozen smurfs to play at lower mmr than you deserve, claiming that "it's just for fun" and ignoring the fact that you're denying the opponents a fair chance, etc etc. 
---
Get bent my friend.
---
Ahhhh so by "allowed"... YOU meant people would *automatically agree with you*. Right.... of course!
---
The truth is, cupcake...spineless man, who no men or children look up to. Who no woman would ever truly want to be with (if they are a quality woman, with options)... no one silenced you. No one even advocated for you to be silenced. 
---
Yes. Not everyone gets along. Not everyone clicks. *Finally* you've said something that's actually true!
---
Good job, thanks for finally saying something that isn't pure BS.
---
Or better yet, play however you want.
---
If someone wants to go hard from the start, ain't nothing wrong with that.
---
Much of the lore you'll find is retconned garbage. Some of it is good but it can be hard to separate the good from the bad and much of it was added/changed long after it actually happens in game. Feel free to familiarize yourself with it if you still want to, but my suggestion is to just play Warcraft 3 as another user mentions and read the quests in game while ignoring most lore from later expansions or outside sources. Each race's intro cinematic also gives a nice summary of what's going on with them now.
---
Coming in here and asking this is like a Crack addict wandering into a heroin den and asking the local heroin junkies "How's that heroin stuff? any good?"
---
Racism will be a reportable offense, so hopefully not.
---
Well as you can see the debuffs are all different types. This means only certain classes can despell certain debuffs. This gets exceptionally more annoying on alliance as we don't have Shamens. The issue is more about finding a balance between dps and healers who can debuff the corresponding debuff without sacrificing the heals needed to finish the fight.  Unless the guild has done the fight in the past and everyone is assigned, there is usually in-fighting between attempts.
---
U sure?
---
If that's their attitude, play elsewhere. Hell, roll on a different server even.
---
If you're worried about being a snob, well, you're not one of the people with no experience trying to tell everyone else how it is. I personally have been "friends" with too many no-nothing know-it-all control freaks in the past to have much patience for this sort of thing nowadays.
---
Yeah, hit 'em with the useless, snarky one-word response. That was definitely worth it
---
Horde Raids ideally want double shamans (5-7) over priest (2-4) in raid and 1-2 druid healers. This changes if 1-2 of those shamans are Enh spec made for twisting and white damage (the number of shamans you want is always the same, but this opens more room fort druid and priest healing.) Honestly, on horde its hard to fit in more than 1 druid healer. You always want at least 1 for buffs/hots, but enchantment shamans can allow for 2 more non shaman healers. 9-11 healers is ideal but 12 and even 13 is possible, even more so for horde as Resto shamans can Twist (at the cost of much of their healing, but if you have extra healers this is a good option). 
---
The reason is without shamans casting groups don't have tranquil air or mana (20% less threat, for ranged its 25% increased threat cap; which is up to 25% more dps they can do before pulling aggro/or slowing dps). Mana totems are nice even for locks. Mana totems for healers (which means you need a less healers). WF (~10% damage per fury warrior), Grace of air (5.2%+damage per fury warrior or increased threat limit for entire raid when in MT group), Tranquil Air again (for up to 20% more dps before slowing dps due to threat per fury warrior). Finally, the resists and other utility totems for all which are much more useful than many people realize. 
---
In short the best, most needed, class on all of Horde is Shaman by a lot. You can raid without a ton of fury warriors and have similar dps even with rogues or mages. However, without shamans you are going to lose a significant raid wide dps.
---
Alliance is totally different with 4-5 paladins being ideal this leaves room for 2-3 additional other healers and balances their proportions.
---
It is very cool RPing whilst XxLegolasxX wastes his time bothering your group.
---
5-6 hours sleep is not healthy. You can do it short term, but you need  between 7 to 9 hours of sleep.
---
Nope. If you don't think that you are equal to all others and who uphold your right to say whatever you want. That no one is superior to you, and gets to control you... then almost no one will respect you. Nor should they. And you and the other weaklings surround yourselves in your little bubbles of "safe spaces". And the weak only associate with the weak. 
---
Which is more than fine with me. At least we all know who you are now. Thanks for that.
---
Dream of peameal flying directly to my plate.
---
I didn't do any of those. I'm picking warrior because I like playing warrior.
---
I can imagine that RPing on a non-RP server will cause the immersion to be broken too frequently.
---
&gt;Stop playing their Shaman if they don't like it.
---
I see this happening to a lot of people. I feel like shaman leveling feels bad. For most players it will be slower than rogues, as to make it efficient really is a pain in the butt.
---
I'll do it. That's the same schedule I was planning to play. I'd like to take a ten minute break every four hours for cardio and bio. Also wanted to play rp-pvp if there is one. Rolling human warrior.
---
Faction imbalance is fun!
---
i dont see how ill convince them in real life when i show up though.
---
They’re the best leveling class because they have little to no downtime a big fucking tiger soaking up all the bullshit for them.
---
The Void is the next big enemy. 
---
The retcon established that the Burning Legion was seeking war against the plans of the void creatures. 
---
In the Legion expansion, there's an old orc on the broken shores that you can talk to.
---
He basically tells you that you shouldn't be fighting the Legion and should instead look at the bigger picture (the Void). 
---
BfA is going to be the bridge to that story, but Blizzard did it in the worst way possible. They forced a "war" between factions on dubious grounds and that's BfA. 
---
You'll find that Horde and Alliance are going to "work together" to fight against the Void for the tail end of the expansion, and then we'll all be fighting together to fight the Void proper next expansion.
---
Yea its fantastic in the 49 bracket. If you mostly play the game to pvp, and just dont see yourself dedicating the time to the never ending raid grind , its the bracket to play in. A lot of people are asking why not 50-59's , well imo its a not a bad idea if you just want to farm pvp ranks AND THEN level up to 60 with a good chunk of the pvp farming already done. 
---
One of my favorite things about twinking 49's is unlike the other brackets, Rogues and Hunters arent completely shitting on everyone all game long because they simply arent as broken in 49's. 
---
Gearing 49's is also interesting because you need to plan it out at least 10 levels in advance, carefully pick the quest lines that you need finished for your desired gear. And start grinding any dungeon drops as early as you can. Or for almost all the classes a full set of level 49 greens (minus a weapon) can get you fairly close to 49 Bis sets.
---
Also i know its not great for the community at level 60, but in the lower brackets, the shared BG battlegroups actually are a wonderful thing. From experience i can tell you that YOU WILL get to know all the heavy hitters from whichever servers you are linked to. You will develop rivalries cross server, believe me.
---
I didn’t read all the replies but op seems to be taking heat. I understand his question but feel he missed a few details in his travels. 
---
OP, I tried a few rp servers too and the level of server immersion really varies quite a bit, and this is even more true zone to zone. It’s hard to get a real sense of those places and the behaviors as a “tourist”. 
---
A lot of the stuff happens on the guild level and often not in open air chat simply because of tourists.
---
Sounds like /r/wow, where raid finder is the pinnacle of success and pvp is too complicated for 95% of people.
---
Stop discouraging people from trying.
---
If you are all contributing to completing the dungeon, anyone that can use the gear for leveling/dungeons/pvp they can roll on it. This isn't a guild run where you compare who can use it more, it's random people. If I'm running a dungeon as a tank to get a 2H weapon, I expect to be able to roll for it. I also expect the Pally to want to roll on it as well. If you're going to use it, there is no reason you shouldn't be able to compete for the item. If you want to do reserved runs, that's cool too.
---
Try Mordhau.
---
Its so different from any other game I've played it is actually fun and distracting. Hours just fly by.
---
I like your attitude 😂
---
The Classicless debuff.
---
Makes you hit F5 more than what's healthy. Undispellable and pretty long.
---
The dude is talking about his rolls getting crusty and comparing gaming to going to the gym. I’m pretty sure this is satire.
---
ayyyy MA
---
Oh, so never.
---
That's extremely casual. You work for 8-10 hours. Sleep 6-8. Anything that's only a couple hours is casual.
---
I don't think so.  If they did something really serious like RP a funeral there's no way anyone would disrupt that.
---
&gt;  So who cares about having it officially?
---
People that don't hang out on forums 20 hours a day?
---
Don't be a dick.
---
Gurabashi arena!
---
My default answer when I don’t like to get into past guilds is: “they had too many X” 
---
X = Class/ Spec/ Role
---
How do I get this bis prepaid? Take my money!
---
I want it in my veins.
---
Why are you even on this subreddit if you hate the game ?
---
I'd argue alliance have it good since cleanse removes 1 magic, 1 disease and 1 poison per global. Poison cleansing and cleansing is a nice convenience but not nearly useful as an all in one dispel. Couple that with priests being hordes only magic dispel and it's definitely an alliance favored fight. 
---
Grant i don't think it's a big problem as each faction has advantages over the other in certain boss fights. If Chromaggus only used poisons or diseases than shaman would rock this fight as a group wide dispel over multiple seconds for 1 global.
---
Every race but undead offers a good trick in pvp.  Gnome is generally poor in rogue v rogue because an extra snare-free isn't that amazing, given that you can have like six snare-frees if you really need, but it's by no means bad.  
---
The things you can't get anywhere else:  
---
Dwarf can wipe serious debuffs, including blind.  Versus a rogue, this also wipes their snare.  This is a top tier choice for rogue versus rogue.  In non-duel combat, you also don't have to worry about any of the metastealth guys, because horde doesn't have that.  
---
Orc stun resist will be a thing that you can't count on, but laugh when it procs.  When it procs, you are well on your way to winning that encounter.  Orc is very good.  
---
Humans have extra stealth detection, which is the best metastealth if you know the enemy rogue is near.  It is useless when on cooldown, but... does your enemy *know* it's on cooldown?  
---
Night elves have the best metastealth without cooldowns.  If you stack up your stealth and stealth detect, you will be passively the best at stealth, and this can absolutely make a difference in rogue v. rogue.  
---
Trolls merely have berserking, which is poor in rogue v rogue pvp, but it is more than the undead have, which is nothing.  
---
I think your choices here are Dwarf, Orc, Human, and Night Elf.  But please remember that your character will be in way more situations than just rogue v rogue, and all the races have stuff that they are legit good at.

Rolling Dwarf Priest so this is cool to see, was actually going to use the stress test on the 8th to try and work on my 1-10 route before heading over to meet up with my Human leveling buddy.  Thanks for the post!

god damn i was about to post it

Spoken like a true fellow Vanilla Raider. You get all the upvotes imo 🙏🏻
---
I don’t think that anyone is superior or inferior to me, I just don’t want to hurt other people, and stopping myself from saying something offensive (which is rare, and not something I am constantly worrying about) is worth it if it means the people I care about are happy.
---
It’s not some life altering philosophy or a hard skill to work on or anything, it’s just being considerate of others.
---
A lot of people underestimate how hard it will be to organize 40 people
---
"I just don't like gnomes."
---
Never really understood this.  I'd think in a given BG having pallies and fear ward would be more of an advantage than the racials.

 **&lt;Saga of Lucimia&gt; - US - Alliance - PvE/RP - CST**
---
We are a group of adventurers ready to dive into Classic World of Warcraft. The guild is made up of a mix of fans and developers working on an MMORPG called Saga of Lucima. We enjoy playing games together as a community and generally hanging out, and World of Warcraft Classic is our next venture together! We hope you will join us if your plans for Classic are similar to ours!  
---
We have [forums](https://sagaoflucimia.com/forums/index.php?forums/world-of-warcraft-classic.86/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/t9ZHWNr) for planning and VoIP. There are also a number of members who will be streaming at launch if you're interested in joining in with that!  
---
**Leveling**  
---
There are a number of static leveling groups with various play schedules that will be playing at launch, but there is also a good section of the guild who are more casual and play at their own pace outside of static groups. We welcome all leveling/playstyles, so if you are interested in joining us, let us know! And, if you'd like to be placed in one of the static groups, let us know your race/class and schedule, and we'll get you slotted!  
---
**Raiding**  
---
We aim to be a progression guild and to raid a couple of nights a week, with the core of our grouping sessions set around a Tues/Thurs/Sat schedule from **8 p.m. Central until 11 p.m.** For the first month or two, our focus will be on leveling up and preparing everyone for raiding, but once we have enough people to start we'll be kicking things up a notch and moving into the raid content. We will be using DKP with a few twists. (Nostalgia!) More information can be found over on our forums.  
---
**Crafting**  
---
We have a number of crafters already ready to help the guild and members with their wares, but we always have room for full-time crafters. We will be hosting harvesting nights weekly to support our crafter division, with guildmates earning DKP just like they would on a raid while participating in getting out there and farming mats to keep the guild in full supply of pots and gear!  
---
**Community**  
---
More than anything else, we are a community of gamers who are passionate about MMORPGs. We have been playing together for more than four years now through various games, such as EverQuest (progression servers and Project 1999 on different occasions), EverQuest 2 (live and progression servers), The Elder Scrolls Online, Lord of the Rings Online, and beyond.  
---
While we aren't hardcore, we are all adults with busy schedules who enjoy progression and community without poopsocking our way through things. If you prioritize community ahead of having the best gear in the game, then we're likely a home that you could enjoy.
---
Stoneform is but a brief respite from Viper Sting's torment.
---
Once I got criticism of not pursuing a doctorate degree... In a non academic field where it has no impact on my pay. It's like when they expect you to overachieve but overachieving has no impact on your pay only a high risk of you burning out and hating your field.
---
According to Rammstein everyone lives in America, and we have world championship titles w/o any outside competitors.
---
Why would a location ever need to be specified?
---
Just don't pick a streamer realm. GL, mate.
---
Completely serious.
---
In fact, you shouldn't know another persons name unless they've introduced themselves or you find out through some other way.
---
Yeah man, everyone uses add-ons, reads reddit, the general forums and clears naxx blind folded 
---
everyone, because i said so
---
Is this fantasy?
---
First off, there ARE people trying to do that. 
---
Secondly, why are you opposed to it?
---
There are OP classes in both brackets but many more classes, and specs, are viable at 49.
---
1-7, mouse4, mouse5, QERTYFGHJZXCVBN
---
Shift and Control versions of the above
---
I've been trying for 10 years to also use as Alt modifier but can't get my fingers to fit. Might rebind Caps Lock to Alt and try that, given the high amount of stuff to keybind in vanilla.
---
It works on regular NPC's on the beta so I'd pressume it works in raids too
---
Create a tank, healer, and dps. Try to join groups as much as possible and stick with the role that ends up being the most needed.
---
Really?  I thought the opposite when I hopped on a Pserver earlier this year (which isn't even as nice looking as classic in a few aspects) and I was pleasantly surprised.  Sure, it's an old game, but I feel like it holds up quite well for being 15+ years old.
---
Yeah, it's an elf fortress and all kalimdor coast is held by darnassus but sure there's some cow over here so it's 50/50 horde alliance
---
Except that's entirely different........... those people dont actively seek to disrupt your group........
---
8 hours wow, 8 hours work, 2 hours travel/misc, 6 hours sleep, is not very casual my friend.
---
Yep! I've got a discord with a bunch of my RL friends that are planning to raid eventually, but we're not going to bother recruiting until closer to 60 when we know more what our roster is looking like and people are settling into the game.
---
I cant tell if its mockery or a call for help.
---
Paladins can cleanse diseases.
---
Not necessarily true; our guild is relatively casual, 2-night, 6-hour guild with a goal of clearing content in each phase.  We've recruited heavily to that end and been successful at it.
---
Okay after watching that video it still felt like a skilled player was playing a meme spec against worse enemies.

Avoid 30-40 by spamming dungeons in a premade group of 5. Or do a combination of Desolace, Hillsbrad, Alterac, and Arathi Highlands. You'll probably still want to do *some* quests in STV though, as they are really efficient.
---
Whats wrong with felstriker for fury?
---
lee-way isn't dead tho...
---
Step 1) personal space
---
Roll on a different server and peace out.  The great thing about classic is the community.  You can find the right one.
---
I use esfd as my move keys.  Moving over one from wads gives me another row of keys for abilities and is way more comfortable.  It was a bit hard to make the transition back in the day, but is 100% worth it...could never go back.
---
I also use ctr (could use alt instead, whichever is harder to reach for you) on one of my mouse buttons.  So then you can use say (r) for your down ranked heal and (ctr+r) for your big heal...just by hitting the mouse button.  So for me it doubles every key without needing to change my left hand action at all...almost giving a built in "bar change" with the press of the thumb button, so instead of gaining 1 button from the mouse I gain like ten of them.  Took less time to get used to, but again super worth it to me.  If I could just find a resonably priced foot button or two I'd never stretch for a number key again!  :D
---
At first I didn't realise this was a satire thread
---
Ok dude. Guess i was hallucinating when i did it from lvl 22 or 23 to 25 to test it.
---
I could have swore even in vanilla the mages where all kiting in circles instead of a straight line anyway.
---
They have been very clear and said many times that they want gameplay to feel just like it did in Vanilla.
---
We've got a troll, I see.
---
The naming rules alone is a big deal. It's an initial confirmation that every player acknowledges at least a marginal commitment to the RP concept of the server. 
---
Adding an RP-PVP server later is also a hit on the player base. It will drain the unofficial server, force players to re-roll and remove them from the shared time line of launch servers (and any chance of sharing in the world 1st race).
---
You could also do this in the original EverQuest.
---
He's probably more arguing that those classss get shoehorned into tank/dps during dungeons, but are actually dps, so their role for the group is indeed that but the group wouldn't exist if they hadn't gone those roles and they only want the dps gear.
---
A very common occurance as a warrior dps come 60, as all the tanks get geared and stop doing dungeons, whereas dps warrs bis till p3 is 90% dungeon blues, so they are stuck there for some time and to lower the grind time and to have groups forming after most tanks stop going, they tank as dps, but it should be fully expected they roll on dps gear imo.
---
It’s not satire, that’s what I’m starting.
---
I think you all sound like a great group of people! First, let me send you our guild information to see if you're still interested!
---
Welcome to &lt;Participation Totems&gt;! 
---
Everyone is a winner and everyone deserves &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
Mission
---
&lt;Participation Totems&gt; exists to clear content at competitive speeds while enjoying Classic World of Warcraft. Logging on will never feel like a chore if there is a strong community that enjoys spending time with each other and playing the game at a high level. 
---
We use a loot council based system, where the leadership is responsible for handing out loot. Attendance, performance, preparations, and overall benefit to the raid team will be the main factors when deciding loot handout. If you have questions about it, please talk to the leadership! We are always happy to help out and explain! All performance, attendance, preparations and loot handouts will be tracked in spreadsheets which will be the basis for loot handout during the raid. Not every item will be handed to a specific person, sometimes there will be rolls between 2 or more people for an item, this again is up to the leadership.
---
General Rules 
---
-Racism and sexism will not be tolerated. 
---
-Treat other as you want to be treated, be friendly and respectful.
---
-Do not troll or start arguments in world chat.
---
-Use your in game name for discord as well as the raid sign up.
---
-We have 2 main raids days, Monday and Tuesday with Sunday as a reserve.
---
-The raid times are 8 PM to 11 PM EST
---
-Sundays will only be used when we need 3 days of raiding in one week. This will be when new content is released.
---
-We aim for biweekly raids. The goal of each raid is to complete all content the day before and the day after reset with 2 weeks in-between the consecutive raid days. 
---
Example: 
---
Monday: Full clear MC with the reset that night. Tuesday: Full clear MC. Wait till the following Monday before reset to raid again. 
---
Raider Requirements
---
- Raiders do not expect to get carried.
---
- Raiders are expected to know the tactics of the fights for the raid you are attending
---
- Raiders are expected to have pre-BiS gear
---
- Raiders are expected to bring consumables for 3 hours of raiding
---
- All raiders are required to get DM:T buffs before raid. Plan to get your buff an hour ahead of raid. If you cannot make it before raid then get them the night before. We will not hold up a raid for buffs.
---
- Raiders are expected to be logged out in front of ORG with fresh DM:T buffs, 30 minutes prior to raid time. 
---
- If you cannot make raid times, you need to post into #sick-call channel at least 24 hours before raid.
---
Trial Raider Period
---
-Trials will be evaluated after 4 weeks to determine their eligibility as a raider.
---
-Promotion to raider will be based on performance and attitude on and off raid times.
---
-Trials should not expect to receive loot over a raider.
---
-Trails will be expected to show up with full buffs and consumes, the same as a raider.
---
IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF THE TACTICS USED ON A FIGHT, ASK!!!
---
The officers and class leaders will be a resource available to help you learn. Never feel that you will be judged for not knowing the tactics used on a certain fight. You will never be judged for asking before the raid starts or if you need a quick refresher before the pull. 
---
You WILL be judged if you wipe us because you did not know the tactics and did not ask.
---
Controls and combat in modern wow is still relatively the same as in Classic. The flow is different and rotations and APM are different, but still WASD with keybound abilities same line of site mechanics etc.
---
RS3 combat is so different from OSRS that it doesn't even feel like the same game at all. OSRS combat is all based around twitch click reflex and working prayers around the server tick system. RS3 is all about ability rotations and cooldown management.
---
RS3 and Retail are similar in that their core values both shifted in the same way towards casual players and mtx.
---
I change turn left and right to strafe left and right
---
Sounds like you belong on retail and not classic.
---
Not opposing it. I would like one but if blizzard doesn't give us one then we'll have to make due?
---
It’s not always 100% true, but I can speak from experience on both sides of the hiring system that most employers aren’t looking for someone who matches all of their qualifications perfectly.  
---
Interview skills play a much larger role in getting hired as long as you have the basic qualifications down and don’t have any skeletons in a background check or anything like that.
---
Yep, there's one really annoying Disease for melee classes, from those Tar Lurkers in Un'Goro. [Black Sludge](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=7279) - "Increases the time between the attacks of nearby enemies by 54% and slows their movement speed by 30% for 2 min."
---
The absolute worst ones are the ones that impact your regen rate while also putting a tiny dot on you.
---
Still going in a circle between Warrior, Rogue, and Paladin. I want to tank, but I also want to dps, but I also want to be a hipster meme.
---
I love when people make these “inconsequential” arguments. If it’s so “inconsequential” and you’re not “taking the game too seriously” then as a warrior just pass the ring to the casters who don’t think 6 int is “inconsequential.”
---
That’s how windfury always worked.
---
Don't act like the mentality wasn't created by the sub starting with "unless you're a dwarf priest you won't get invited."
---
This sub started pro hardcore but got so ridiculous all the other types of players started piping up.
---
My favorite moment was on my enhancement shaman back when WF was broken. 
---
At around level 55 a level 60 hunter (with some tier gear) and some friends of his wanted to start some trouble. 
---
He charged up a flight of stairs to get to where we were and my group and I charged down to fight him. 
---
WF double proc'd on him and his health pool got obliterated.
---
This is essentially [how it felt for me.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8689071/My5Z2DO.gif)
---
 all combinations have shift and alt variants
---
wheel up and down - main attacks(shift strong attacks/finishers or heroic/overpower type of attacks - alt (aoe or focus)
---
middle  click - movement abilities (warrior mid is charge/battlestance,with  shift its zerk stance/intercept with alt its focus intercept)
---
\` - autorun
---
w - forward
---
ad - strafe
---
q - defensive cooldowns (same with shift and alt)
---
e - offensive cooldowns
---
r - trinkets ( +shift 2nd trinket +alt are helmets )
---
f - interrupts (as war f is normal interrupt shift+f is fear alt+f is nade)
---
s - unique abilities like stealth / racials sometimes ranged weapon like wanding/shooting depends on class
---
c/v - self healing abilities potions food(bandages/potion/toobers/food)
---
z/x - generators - rage pots thistle tees bloodthirst stuff like that
---
1234/shift - usefull things / long cooldwons - alt 1 is mount 234 are macro gear swap for helms or gear sets
---
alt zxcv - utility for w/e might be needed
---
zoom in zoom out remapped to ctrl+wheel
---
bar switching unmapped
---
f1-f5 - marking targets skull/x/square/moon/star
---
shift+f1-f5 - targeting those marks
---
and 2 side mouse buttons that are easy to use with shift/alt for useful things
---
Your group doesn't even need to acknowledge that they are there.
---
Wasn't the data done for 12-40 in beta vs speedlevellers 12-40 in beta?
---
I regularly get 5.5-6.5 hours of sleep,  can confirm shit sucks.
---
No SO and no kids. I work long hours but instead of dividing my spare time up among several different things, its going to be 100% WoW for the next couple years. Hoping to find a pretty hardcore guild that raids or holds group activities 4 nights/week for around 3 hours each. Defining and communicating your expectations early on is the key to happiness.
---
I seriously considered every class except druid, hunter and shaman. I had decided on warrior, then warlock. But ended up with mage. Id be a warlock if not for shard farming for pvp which ill do a lot of.
---
Assigning strafe to A and D opens up Q and E. You can also unbind keys like C and G.
---
Some people shift their movement keys over to ESDF to open up more keys on the left.
---
Hot take: If you're not rolling a class because of melee lee-way you're a cuck and a half
---
Brood Affliction: Bronze with no sand for the raid.
---
I'm totally imagining a random cafe customer jumping on the game table and doing the Nelf dance while another drills you on what you could possibly get out of pretending you are a half elf druid and if perhaps Satan has compelled you play such a godless game as D&amp;D.
---
I didn't realize that was windfury because in Vanilla they all happened in "one" animation rather than 3 swings. So windfury's animation is incorrect. Your weapon didn't visually swing 3 times.
---
But even then the first hit's range that proc'd windfury seemed significantly far.
---
This leeway was put in place back in the day because everyone had poor internet. It has to be adjusted to today's standards imo.
---
Block their chat if they are spamming and ignore their characters actions. Move on and continue to have fun?
---
Same here.

It looks exactly like it did back in the day in virtually every video you displayed.

Educate yourself man!

The sad thing is most of these upvotes are from legit assholes thinking you were serious, sigh.

Roll PvE if you want a greater chance at avoiding assholes guys.

Hey, welcome back to Personal Space. I'm your host, Phillip Jacobs, and let me tell you, I care about my personal space.
---
I think you over estimate how much resources blizzard wants to spend on GM for classic, from their recent interviews, it seems they only really care about bot detection...
---
" **Brian Birmingham:** As long as a human is at the keyboard and they're actually running around, doing things... Farming materials for your raids - farming gold, farming herbs - were activities that were OK, they were normal gameplay. Really, where we get concerned, is when someone has got some kind of automation program doing the gameplay for them. That's against our terms of service and we have better detection algorithms and techniques today than we had before, so we hope that will be sufficient to keep it under control."  
---
Blizzard clearly doesn't want to use too many resources on Classic, you can see that with the item trading as 1 example.. they recently fired a bunch of GMs in their 700 staff cleanse, they have a new patch on the PTR that will release after classic for retail, you think they have the numbers or the care factor to scour through gold trades/auction house trades to see if they are legit or not?  I think people will get snagged here and there but most will get through
---
Orc by a loooooong shot. The wardroom that tauren get is a super short stun, practically useless when trying to get off a GHW. You “might” be able to juke in a LHW in the stint timer, but it’s not worth it. Also, for those arguing about the extra “stun to silence” or “interrupt ability”, the earth shock CD is 5 seconds when species.. if a shaman needs an extra interior with in that 5 second window, they are going to lose the fight as is with no way around it. There’s almost no situation where a shaman would need a double interior with in a 5 second window unless it’s a 1v2 fight and even then, the 5 second window is so short that a vast majority of players can’t play inside that window.    
---
Aesthetically though.. tauren all the way.
---
There are many guilds that wouldnt want that type of attitude in their community.  Dont hate on people for the way they want to play.  Just find the people that want to play like you do.  Those people are out there.
---
It feels right to me. It's a PvE game with pvp tacked on. Me avoiding imbalanced pvp in a pve game feels right. 
---
If pvp in a pve game feels right to you, thats fine.
---
Well some of those titles are legit
---
If you unmap ⬇️ you are bad at PVP.  You might as well just go raid or something.  The same goes for unmapping X.
---
The psychological damage you can do by being a backpedaling boomchicken and teabagging someone you've just killed is amazing.
---
No one would possibly crash a RP funeral would they? Nah...
---
Why do you need your own server classification to roll play at the gold shire inn? Just go do it on a pvp server..
---
No, you can't have it both ways. You can't say something is falling up, and falling down at the exact same time.
---
If you're saying some people get to control others' speech, then *there must be* something about The Controller/s that gives them that authority, that power. So they must be superior in some way. 
---
So in your case, you're either inferior because you think people should be controlled. Or you're The Tyrant, who is the one who gets to be in control. And neither of these is a *moral* position, if you believe in actual Equality.
---
Were you considerate of others, when you called people "toxic"? You're the one who started all this. And you didn't even say what was "toxic", in your opinion. You couldn't even come up with a lucid argument. You just resorted to name-calling, like a child. 
---
And you expect anyone to respect you, for acting like a child?
---
9. Ignore everything preventing you from playing. Even if listed in previous points
---
Yeah I can agree with that. OSRS is doing that pretty well. Another raid would be pretty cool.
---
When i got my old account back i found out old me made boatloads of low level chars and saved starter gear for whatever reason, i can assue you it does sell for a decent sum, with certain class gear being worth alot more, i suggest using websites on nearly all the gear to pricecheck as if it was removed the price can go up to insane amounts.

I did a macro...can't remember exactly what it was.  Basically roll forward to bear form and back to cat.  When in bear forward became charge and back to caster form.  When in cat back to stealth and forward to caster.  Ctr (mousebutton)+a trav form.  That way most of my shifting was done with the mouse hand, and keyboard for abilities.  Kind of a strange system but it worked well for me.

Just tell them paladins are the latest pserver meta and to get with the times.  You'll be fine.
---
fuck no changes
---
I bet its live to win.
---
*click*
---
Thereeee we go
---
Yes, and if the people who stick around after the honeymoon period is over start demanding that certain mechanics be changed, I'm sure Blizzard would consider it.
---
No memespecs unless we lack spots in raid.

Being annoying, not using push to talk or muting mic when not speaking is not allowed.
---
Being harsh on people who are time wasters.

Haha, as I was typing the reply, I had the same thought. But the difference is they are doing meaningful dps, while the nightfall bitch is just buffing others, which is great, but it feels different.

1. BoP loot trading will be possible only in 20/40 man raids for 2 hours.
---
2. Unknown.

3. Layering is like a shard that covers an entire continent so you generally won't see characters popping in and out of existence. Joining another players group will place them in the same layer. At the end of beta they had already added an internal cooldown for changing layers to make it less exploitable. The main reason for having this setup is so a smaller number of servers with many layers each can accommodate a large number of players at launch, many of whom will be checking out classic for a bit and going back to retail or quitting after basking in the nostalgia.  Blizzard hopes to remove layering after a few weeks, but it may be in place for all of phase 1. Blizzard has stated it will definitely be turned off before phase 2 since that introduces world bosses.

lmao y'all who don't have a girlfriend/SO/wife who does all of this.
---
Kidding aside, thanks for this. Stocking up as we speech.
---
How to never get healers (or tanks) for levelling dungeons in one easy step.
---
Everyone needs dps gear to level. You can't heal or tank mobs to death. Unless you are in a dungeon grinding group, expect them to roll Need if something fits their levelling setup.
---
The theme of these comments is that, although its good for them, its 'better' for another class. Emberstone staff for example, Really high damage 2h... but its a caster staff, would piss off a lot of casters but the weapon is still viable for warriors.
---
God, same. Nothing with depth anyway. Still have 3 weeks, which is plenty of time, but my dumb brain is telling me to save my brainpower for wow, or something. It's nonsensical, but I relate.
---
I have NCMF &amp; then Basscenter the weekend following.  
---
What a terrible weekend for Nectar to plan this all on.
---
\&gt;  opinion; but true nonetheless.   
---
What a good start. Ok, let me read the rest now.
---
Are there any cheap ones out there?  Would improve my life by at least 10%!
---
If they use spells then I'm playing on Detect Traps for those swirly ball memes
---
Bring back swirly ball!
---
What the visual?

This is a video from actual Vanilla. See how windfury proc'd 3 swings under "one swing's" visual? Your weapon never swung 3 times.
---
In terms of the leeway distance:

If it was actually this far in actual Vanilla back in the day then I truly think it should be adjusted. This is ridiculous. It made sense back in the day because everyone had significantly higher latency than they do today. It ensured smooth gameplay, back then. To ensure smooth gameplay today, it has to be adjusted imo.

These 30 Minute Diseases that lower your HP-Regen by 50%.
---
&gt; Good deal if you can't make your own better tasting pizza I guess though.
---
I *can*, but it takes a lot more precious WoW time than ordering delivery.
---
No, that's *your* idea of an MMO. I don't care about PvP any more, if I wanted to PvP I'd play a game where it was purely my skill versus their skill. Without anything obstificating that competition.
---
However considering they added the honor system that gives you *gear*...
---
I'm sure you will dig your way out of this hole someday.
---
I understand, it just seems that many people seem to think there are other rules that are enforced. Blizzard did have a roleplaying policy in place when WoW launched but it was removed many years ago.
---
There should be a rule about people that attempt to subvert the rules which of course they would attempt to subvert.
---
I mean my language was supposed to be sarcastic but the guy really is being an elitist about being a casual which I found ironic

# Lonely Goblin Brigade Tree-house

A very casual LGBT friendly guild, no serious plans so far other than to enjoy the road to 60. Long term will be looking to raid, but not in any competitive manner.

All are welcome, as long as you're respectful and mature.

You’re right about the swing visual. But I actually do think prior to patch 1.3 it had multiple swings. 
---
But yea the leeway looks exactly the same. I also don’t know what that mage kiting gnoll video even was. Mages kited circularly in vanilla instead of whatever that straight zig zag line bullshit was because of melee hitting and dazing them from bumblefuck.

Earth shock has a 5 second cooldown.. if a shaman needs an extra interupt in that 5 second window, they are going to be dead anyway come the next window due to lack of warstomp, making it a useless ability for elemental. Even if the warstomp was to stun, you can get a MAXIMUM of 12 yards with in that window, which is easily closable by warriors with intercept/HS, and easily closable by rogues since the ele has to cast in order to do damage, even with a frost shock, the rogue will vanish and be back on your ass.   
---
Making orc hardiness the superior choice. Has been proven mathematically and it won’t change.
