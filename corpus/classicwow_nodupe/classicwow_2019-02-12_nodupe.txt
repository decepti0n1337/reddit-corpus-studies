The race, every server that opens is a new race, new leveling experience, maybe a new roll, new ranking, etc

Good video.

I’ve never had my mats ninja’d. Not in Vanilla, not in BC, not in Wrath. Especially for enchanting, imagine how much work and gold it took to get to 300 with all the desirable recipes. Why would they throw that all away for 80g worth of mats? Word might spread and they would lose out on a lot of easy gold.
---
You make it sound worse than it actually is in practise, for example nova is on a 25 sec cd EA will turn the fight in your favour if you can't vanish out of it, same for roots a well timed EA will give you the chance to kick a druid on their next cast. being able to stick on a target as a rogue is HUGE and EA helps with doing so, gnomes are superior in bgs unless the dwarf is popping fap pots constantly. dwarfs are better in wpvp + against other rogues. T. played both races extensively in premades
---
Any good LC is going to try and give you the gear you ask for, that's how you keep your players happy. They just won't give you gear you shouldn't have. Like a rouge or hunter taking a TF before the tanks. Frankly any good DKP system is going to have the same restrictions and will probably end up DE'ing more upgrades because people want to horde points.
---
That change is in no way positive. You pay the hybrid tax so that your class is capable of multiple roles. That’s invalidated if you can switch on a whim.
---
This guy just said ANAL
---
I wish they don’t implement this in Classic. I’m not as hardline “no changes type” as others, but the last thing I want is the community trying to advance the game in any way. 
---
Wouldn't it have taken you less time to just try mailing the mount instead of posting this garbage on the Classic WoW subreddit?
---
&gt;  If you're willing to flask for MC every week in order to improve clear times, you're willing to roll a human.  
---
That's definitely not true, and I remember that from vanilla.  
---
Also, pointing out that weapon skill is desirable is fair, but eventually everyone has that- the ultimate difference between human and dwarf comes down to, both have the same weapon skill, but human has some other stat that gives him a (smaller) edge.  
---
There are places where the race roll matters a lot- priests come to mind- but otherwise it is a small matter compared in the melee universe.  Still, it's within your power to run it- I would never lose a good player based on something so small, something that is ultimately just a fraction of a gear piece.  
---
One final piece:  rogues use more than just swords.  When a sword drops, you'll have rogues that can use it, and warriors that can use it.  When a dagger drops, you can get way more mileage out of that on a rogue.  Much of the time, the human weapon specialization won't matter, is my point- it's not like a raw 1% damage increase.
---
If they got that it should cost them Bubble. I agree for DPS they could use a boost. That being said Pally was already OP. They don't need to suddenly get a giant buff.
---
Smashing people in pvp with superior gear is fun.
---
For the time succubus was an ok choice, but now with 15 years of theorycrafting and private servers you just don't ever see her in use.
---
ythisens is herding the sheep to the slaughter house lol
---
It's so obviously true that it's worth saying, I think, I haven't really heard this point much if at all on this sub.
---
If you say so. I would never play a Troll so I can't remember the exact number. I was just making the point. It is a massive buff even in pvp. White Damage is life in classic. 
---
I'm on my phone. My computer is off. And I don't have a character with level high enough for it to matter yet. I'm asking you so I can know whether I should keep the mount in my bag, or just throw it away, but I'll try it out myself if noob questions aren't welcome here.
---
You don't invite an enhancement shaman to carry, you invite to make for others to do so
---
I could see smaller cosmetics like the newer hairstyles slipping through the cracks.
---
An addon that can target from the minimap like in vanilla
---
Just ignore that guy, he's toxic. As for your question, no unfortunately I don't believe you can :( 
---
Rogue + Rogue + Rogue
---
Do I need to even explain this?
---
Except they're complete dead weight because resto shamans can give totems and/or twist while offtanks can swing Nightfall and have much better uptime.
---
&gt;  (unless usage of ZG pot)  
---
If you are forced to living action, you can't free action, which is a pretty big disadvantage, as living action has such a short duration.  
---
Consistently being at the bottom of the healing/damage charts tends to get you replaced if you're in a decent guild. Nobody in such a guild would bring a spec that's going to be stuck at the bottom of the meters.

---
&gt; EA suffers from how spammable are some slows and roots. You can avoid one? Next is applied immediately.   
---
Slows are spammable, roots are not.  Roots are also subject to DR.  One use of EA is when you use improve sprint to break a thing, and are immediately put in a new thing, so you use EA and your sprint is back to full speed.

I think mounts are BoP. Even if you could mail them you would still need the riding skill to use it.
---
NE zones are pretty good. Teldrassil to Darkshore to Ashenvale is a pretty optimal and seamless leveling route.

You’ll be raiding barely 8 hours a week. The top guilds only raid 4-5 hours a week. 
---
Pally power, at least in more recent versions, already does this. When you hover over a buff it pulls out individual characters and then you scroll the mouse wheel to adjust it for just that character.
---
I’m afraid that it won’t be nerfed and Classic economy will be a mess. 
---
I’m going wherever the private server community goes. Because I already know that this server will be the most active and all the world first kills will happen there. If I roll on a server with too many retail players then there’s a good chance that the server will die off once retail players burnout. 
---
Hmm, that's actually a pretty good idea, and it's also within the spirit of the game. :) Maybe I'll try to do that one day.
---
My retail guild's trial which I was talking about earlier, also tested recruits on current progress be it BWL/AQ or Naxx. That is why I said 1-2 weeks, stuff like ZG and farmed raids was attended by officers to see if recruits could do basics well like apply buffs, heal, etc
---
Wherever the big streamers (and their armies of nut-swingers) aren’t.
---
Nobody gets carried in AQ you moron. 
---
You don’t replace a nightfall shaman you clueless moron. 
---
I think Questie does that.
---
Yeah, the Wrath era hairstyles I could see making it in. I don't think they will do that, but they certainly could.
---
There’s actually an instant 60 private server that replicates this scenario. The strongest pvp classes on there are Elly Shamans in t2.5, Warlocks in T3, Warriors in T2.5 with Might of Menethil, and Shadow Priests in full R14 gear. 
---
The general consensus on that server is that you’re ether playing or getting ownd by those 4 classes. 
---
I always recruited a full group and a half.
---
That way you almost always had whatever you needed... And could usually do 3 seperate 20 man runs on the weekend once alts were leveled. 
---
I'm going to bet against it. I know you covered yourself by saying "might get lucky", but I don't think we've gotten a single piece of information regarding Classic from an earnings call. 
---
Yeah and I heard that the sky was falling too!
---
Two-drake pulls and fully-powered Hakkar sound interesting, but I don't think individual-end challenges like "no hotkeys" will work, or be very fun. You're not going to keep track of 40 people to make sure they're handicapping themselves properly.
---
DM on release is just one of the reasons why Classic raiding will be a complete joke. 
---
Private servers delay DM release, disable all world buffs, and overtune the heck out of the bosses, and still the content is easy and cleared within weeks of server release.
---
Classic will not take any of these measures. So you can imagine what kind of shitshow Classic raiding will be. 
---
I think Pservers invite a lot more competitive people.  Those kinds of people are likely gonna be diluted with more casual, normal folks (such as myself) and won't be as common.  IMO.
---
&lt;RTK&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore
---
With the right group of people, a guild can progress competitively while putting in less time than we did back when we were young. We are actively searching for Raiders to fill out our ranks as we prepare for the launch of Classic servers. Not all of our members have played Vanilla before, but we do have Officers with experience up through Naxx. Unlike 14 years ago, most of us now have additional obligations that weren't present previously. We completely understand that real life comes first, but we do have expectations for all raiders. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you’re applying to us, you’re looking to be an active member in our community. You understand your importance in a raid and will commit to being prepared and reliable. You may not necessarily have previous Vanilla raid experience, but you’ve ideally raided during BC or WotLK if you don’t have Vanilla raid experience. You’re a competitive person who plays the game for fun, but your idea of fun is excelling in all facets of the game.

Discord: [http://discord.gg/b9mwYBr](http://discord.gg/b9mwYBr) 
---
Raid Times: 7-11pm Eastern. Tuesday, Wednesday, Sunday 
---
That was pretty normal in vanilla. Those shards were valuable.
---
Methods of gold income for healers:
---
*Farm herbs/ore. Healers can gather about as fast as dps.
---
*Pair up with a tank and reserve loot with pugs. Reserve the BOE recipe drops, BOE mats (crusader orb), etc. (Don't do this with guildies obviously.)
---
*Alchemy on the AH. Buy mats low, sell pots/elixirs high.
---
*Pair up with warrior/lock to farm in silithus if that is what you want. Healers can reduce their downtime and damage exponentially and keep them healthy for surprise pvp.
---
*Make an alt
---
:(
---
To be honest though, playing as a enhancement shaman though was great. Out of all the classes i played i had never gotten so many raid compliments and PMs.
---
It's very much like being the popular kid everyone wants to have at the party because hes rich and brings all the booze and weed, but once the party is over no more sexualizing your totems from raid members. 
---
T1 was never hard. People were just bad back in the day. T1 content can and will be cleared in green geared players. 
---
Sometimes I unplug my monitor and see if I can walk from the AH to the mailbox
---
If I joined a raiding guild I wouldn't want to be expected to be available for every raid every time. Multiple options to fill the spot sounds like an ideal way to fulfill everyone's needs 
---
Maybe they’ll announce burning crusade
---
fingers crossed
---
i'm not as concerned about the game itself as with the subscription cost, since that kinda stuff is out of place in 2019. therefore i hope blizz keeps offering trial accounts up until lv 20. that's 2 or even 3 horde dungeons and deadmines for alliance. if they're not hooked then they wouldn't play further anyway
---
I think the speed runs themselves are good hard modes. Or at least challenges a guild can take on. No tank death vael, tech pack skips, aoe garr, or split runs are fun
---

I downvoted without even getting to the second half. 
---
Have you been hanging out in /r/politics? 
---
A 10 MINUTE VIDEO on the idea that their might be potential news from a stock call.   
---
YOU SCRAPE THAT BARREL TIP, SCRAPE IT UNTIL YOU HIT THE EARTHS CORE!   
---
For bonus points make it break apart the messages so they can be filtered by dungeon and roles. E.g. a tank could filter it so that they only see LFM messages that contain the word tank. Or if you're only interested in running certain instances you can filter out messages relating to others.
---
Right, you just don't bring one in the first place.
---
Whoever is at the bottom is usually the people that lost their buffs early in the night or the warriors that are on offtank duty, as well as the locks early on/hunters later on because of scaling. There's no point in bringing a spec that is consistently going to be at the bottom.
---
You can stutterstep with a wand, just like hunters autoshot.
---
No you won't  
---
These "advantages" are like single digit percentages at most. WoW min/maxing has always been overblown by hypernerds
---
You can literally run with hunters auto shot and only pause for  the animation for your  shot. Are you sure you can do the same with a wand? 
---
That sounds goooood! 
---
Yes.
---
&gt; fight over those improved totems
---
A whopping 12 more strength on STR totem (which restos can also grab) and a whopping overall 19 AP increase from the WF totem talent. If people are fighting for that then they have no clue what they are fighting for.
---
Agreed I have friends playing that haven't touched wow since we were in middle school. Friends that I haven't talked to in years hitting me up saying that they all want to play. I think people are going to be incredibly surprised by the amount of players.
---
There is a point sometimes. 16 debuffs, if you have geared high-performing warlocks, bring a spriest. 
---
restos can't really twist much though, well not like an enha can at least. Way too mana costly and GCD intensive for them to do it the whole time
---
Played Vanilla and I got out of a lot of tanks with my hunter. Everyone is saying druid but my hunter was crazy hard to gank while leveling. You are always full life and feign deaths fucks with a rogues rotation. Rogues were really the only threat and I would kill them most of the time if they tried me.
---
Hmm,  was under the impression running actually canceled the auto shoot, much like spell casting is interrupted. Confirmed on pserver?
---
&gt;sharding
---
what is sharding?
---
Forgive my ignorance, but is there a program like we currently have (Twitch) to install/update our addons easily? I seem to remember you just had to find them and extract them to your interface\addons directory. If there isn't, I would like that haha
---
How would you go about spreading it? Talk to your guild? Spam trade chat and hopefully it doesn't turn in to just his word vs yours?
---
To be fair I was being hasty, my mistake for making a judgment on one episode really(early days too i suppose). I'll have a listen to the later episodes.
---
Regardless of my opinion.... thanks for putting the content out there. At the time, it was podcasts like yours that added another layer to the game/community
---
This is so true. Literally the hardest pull in the dungeon, partially because the group hasn’t always gotten its bearings yet.
---
My use probably had a lot to do with the gear differential lol.  But I do remember just seduce/shadowbolt and repeat for warriors or rogues to be pretty damn effective at killing them while they have 0 chance.  I would take off all my items except my trinkets, rings, cloak, and weapon so I'd look naked and kill the most geared warriors on our server that way.
---
To me it seems more worth spending the time allowing you to give any ability to any object at the start and then moving forward. Sounds like the worst programming practice.
---
Hahahahaha
---
&gt; spriest
---
This whole comment chain was about enhancement shamans.
---
Spriests are slightly behind the curve instead of being miles behind like enhancements, and massively boost the group's damage. You are realistically not bringing one until AQ/Naxx though, since that's when locks (and spriest also) truly come online.
---
Meanwhile, in Shadowfang Keep
---
It’s all good, you make fair points. But I definitely recommend checking out one of episodes #90, 88, 85, 84 or 82 to get a feel for what the show is like now - it’s come a very long way since that first episode where it was just me talking into a mic for 90 minutes by myself. Heck, I’ll even take a call from you for the show if you want to give some feedback, I’m always down to talk to people. Thanks for the reply and the kind words.
---
Only way we’re really gonna know where everyone is going ahead of time is if they release a list of realms 
---
Agreed. Still, you said "a spec" and I'm arguing there is a time. I am certain many guilds will try a spriest in MC, and to decent effect
---
Well, it is "cancelled", you can still shoot, move, reactivate (repeat) without losing dps.
---
Granted, because of weapon speeds the benefit is much smaller than with autoshot, especially when latency is considered.
---
Right, ok I knew it was canceled. Unfortunately it does impact a pretty delay from what I recall. Most wands actual animation is a good portion of the "cast" so you aren't going to get any real benefit running around dpsing with the wand. Pretty exclusive to hunters. If you have DoTs and wanna kite some sure, but standing idle with wand is the top dps method, and it's boring AF
---
But but it says improved totems, it must be huge!
---
I doubt they would. It will likely make them some good money (even if only it was only for a couple monthes). Plus it would be a pretty terrible PR move. "Hey we as a company promised you this a year and a half ago and just recently told you we're getting close to being done and showed all our progress - but we decided to quit shortly before release." The classic team is relatively small (I think like 15 people?) so I can't imagine many if any of the layoffs were related to that team directly.
---
Also, no it is not supposed to come out in 5 months. They said summer which could be 4-8 months from now (first day of summer is June 21st, last day of summer is September 23rd). I would expect end of August or early September which would be 8 months.
---
&gt;in Cata, where they started getting cast as more solidly villainous
---
They were always solidly villainous. Reading all the quests in my recent vanilla playthrough confirms this, SO MANY literally state their intentions to genocide the living, how they dont give a fuck about the horde or anybody else. Hell, like 1/8 of them are directly about developing the chemical weapons deployed in Wrath/Cata.
---
There will always be something to complain about, won’t there?
---
Nice math.
---
Tbh there is plenty of room. 200 dps difference isn't gonna do anything on cthun, hell even 2k dps difference from being lots of meme specs isn't gonna make a difference if you guild knows what they are doing.
---
The problem with meme specs isn't that you can't clear raids with them, it's that all the good players rather want to be in a guild that clears fast, than a guild that "allows all specs". You'll have a hard time finding actual good rogues warriors etc. in a guild that also allows good enhancement, spiest, boomkin etc. 
---
Yeah, I don't see the point in bubble hearthing unless you were about to log or something. I would rather just take the death.
---
you spilled the salt bro
---
Which they very rarely do.
---
I was thinking about doing mining and skinning on my warlock...bad idea? Maybe I just go for the mining and engineering like planned?
---
Like +70 warriors that's a good amount lol
---
Yea.
---
Considering that nostalrius had 10-13k pop, huge variance in the community (global server so we had china eu NA), and all that.. I never got scammed, and I don't even remember anyone getting scammed(and I'd hear if they did). Reputation is just huge in vanilla people won't risk ruining their rep for 100g of mats, especially when they have an enchant that well.. requires 100g of mats, those are rare.
---
10 mins to get the cash tho 
---
I hope Asmongold announces where he's playing in advance so I can avoid accidentally joining it.
---
Popular streamers don't interact with chat mate LUL
---
If I were strategizing the marketing campaign I'd do it pretty much like this. Their CM recently stated that things are progressing and I think that's all they should be doing right now.
---
The Tesla Model 3 was announced/hyped/details revealed a year before it was available and people got in line and waited. Tesla knew that satisfaction could only be had by waiting for the date and buying the thing once. They had every reason to want people hyped for a date.
---
If Blizzard drummed up hype right now, though, they'd be hyping a.) a subscription product with b.) a limited life that c.) may be eight months from release that is d.) available to play right now on private servers. And e.) hyping it right now might just frustrate people who don't want to wait anymore. 
---
It's probably best to stay mostly silent and start feeding big details 3 months out. Do a media blitz 1-2 months prior to the release date. That's all they need to spread the word.
---
 I they won’t cancel classic lmao
---
I am thinking the same but then again would be nice to play with new vanilla players instead of the same guys from those last 4 servers.
---
Claw is basically being forced to use sinister strike with a green dagger. It's really bad.
---
How important is engineering to hunters?  I'd rather roll a night elf and use bows for visual appeal.
---
True, Blizzard acting so weird lately i don’t know why ! Maybe some problems going on on there department since the amount of job losses and all that stuff. 
---
Enhancement can bring improved STR/AGI/WF totems that no other spec will have access too. Any melee group would be glad to have you along, especially with all the other great things any other shaman will bring. Like anything, seasoned players will recognize the utility you will bring. Especially if you're a dedicated, prepared player, I guarantee you'll be contributing more than the standard halfasser. Autists who see the world only in clear times and DPS charts might not pick you but let's be honest: they're secretly doing you a favor. 
---
it's not really a sky is falling post, I'm just trying to be real
---
I want classic as much as anyone
---
Just wanted to pop in here to defend the arms warriors.  That was the top dps spec.  Fury was trash for almost all of vanilla.  Offtanks were usually arms as a 31/5/15 variety as well.  I topped meters fairly consistently from MC thru to aq40 then fury started to be good.  Considering most people didn't get through aq40 or into naxx, arms was still the predominant spec.
---
&gt; T1 was never hard. People were just bad back in the day.
---
I think it's a bold move to profess certainty that it was just because "people were bad", and not because they had pre-1.12 talents, threat mattered, they were using 2004 internet connections and computers, Ragnaros was coded properly and so on. A *lot* of important things are different between the 2017 pirate server experience and the 2004 real server experience.
---
&gt; T1 content can and will be cleared by green geared players.
---
Did you even see Ragnaros in vanilla?
---
Perhaps a better descriptor would be "one dimensional", then.  The best villains are those that you can sometimes empathize with and who show humanity along with the evil. 
---
Probably Rogue and Paladin. On many of my characters I don't even bother fucking with Pallies due to how hard they can be to crap. Full HP, in plate, ok got him down to 25%...bubble, heal, full hp. Ok back down again to 15%...Lay on Hands. If you're on a class without heals they can wear you down easily. Rogues? Can be pretty easy to mulch if you get the drop on one. But there's a decent chance they'll escape (Vanish, Blind, Improved Sprint), and now you'd made an enemy who will possibly be lurker beside you for 45 mins camping. Paranoia? Maybe. But when I was a Rogue that's exactly what I did.
---
No, Pedantic\_Asshole, I have not. Have I been missing out?
---
Very scary thought of Activision controlling Classic server structure. Those fucking cheap-dicks released the latest Call of Duty on the shittiest of all shittiest servers possible. 10hz &amp; 20hz refresh rates. They would have perpetuated this until people complained non-stop. That shit is game breaking. The company is so fucking stupid that they would ruin their games to save monthly server fees. Pisses me off. I want them to cease existing. Fuck em.
---
kinda funny to know he coulda just turned and blinked at the last second
---
My fav part about TBC launch WRT Naxx gear was that it was a 50/50 on whether or not the dungeon sets and even lots of T4 were better than your Naxx stuff.
---
I don't know if this is a private server thing, but I'm told that improved gouge can get you out of combat long enough to restealth. Sounds amazing if true.
---
Scamming at 300 tradeskill just doesn't make any sense in vanilla. You'll get a bad reputation on your server forum and in trade. A reputable guild would probably kick you, and you'll have a harder time selling legit enchants. It's worth it not to scam for the best long term profits.
---
Honestly, I would just stick to someone in your guild. Same for alchemy and stuff.
---
Yes warriors keep going. From the graveyard to its corpse. Again and again. I play a warrior rn on pservers.  I’m only lvl 43 but I love the class. Absolutely love it. I’m very undergeared though and I get killed by every type of caster that is 5 levels below me.  You really feel it when you don’t have the gear. My bro is leveling up his priest rn so we can world PvP together. It is fun when you have a healer, that’s for sure. 
---
was just referring to the total loss of bag space.  But I'll be going herbalism/tailoring for mine.  Maybe skinning to shuffle off pelts to an alt, but herbalism will make more gold long term and lets you find ghost mushrooms later on.
---
Only if you are interested in knowing all the different parts of the sky that are falling. 
---
Like other people have said you can pretty much ignore the pserver dickwipes that insist you only go Resto.
---
Of all the "meme" specs Enh probably brings the most to the table and generally people (primarily the melee groups) will be happy to have you on. Vanilla is 12 year old content balanced around 15 year old players on 20 year old hardware. Anyone taking themselves so seriously they won't accept anything but the best classes for that tier in BiS probably aren't even making it to 60.
---
Private server thing, wont happen in retail. A guy spams you? He will lose 15$ and get banned instantly because of the report system. So don't worry :)
---
You and your bro will be competing for same gear and weapons while leveling though... he should play a priest. More OP in world PvP 
---
i read the first half and saw it was upvoted and was super confused the whole time

Great story man.

There is one, it’s called CalltoArms
---
I expect the first week of launch to be a complete shit show.
---
Oh nice.
---
Last time I used pally power while levelling I couldn't even get the UI to appear.
---
I just assumed you had to train the greater blessings first in order for it to load.

Could drop a bag!
---
It's not so much that it's impossible or even bad, since enh shamans can be useful in melee groups (not that useful though, they can easily be replaced by a resto shaman who specs a bit in the enh tree). 
---
But the main problem is that you will be competing with a shitton of other hybrid dps players since a raidspot will be an oddity rather a rule. People can, and will, be able to play without you. (As an enh, your contribution to the raid willl be very likely lesser than that of another rogue or fury warrior. And both -especially rogues- are not exactly difficult to find for a guild.)
---
So, it's not impossible to play enhancement in PvE (Enhancement shaman are also a lot better in pve than ret pallies IMHO), but prepare yourself to have to game the social system in order to get a stable position in the raid. 
---
I clearly do not advise you to do so if you're not the people-person type and want to be able to enjoy raid content without too much hassle.
---
If you're a social player although, it should be possible to befriend the right persons in a guild. 
---
race doesnt matter for hunter pve wise really. bow skill isnt huge because ranged hits cant glance and hunters get hit capped easily anyway
---
if you want to be serious about pvp / pve then engineering is basically a required profession. engineering is also useful for doing solo tribute runs
---
the cookie cutter 20/31 raiding spec CAN pvp, but it's definitely not "great", you lose out on a lot of good talents.
---
But going tru all the houses to see whats there feels amasing.
---
- Race choice won't overly influence you raid participation unless you plan to mix max and raid at a very high level.
---
- Devilsaur is good money. But its usually farmed quite often and camped so its not regular gold making unless you have a lot of free time. Herb alch will probably make you more gold long term with recipes and transmutes.
---
- Level as a BM hunter to make your life easier. MM is usually the spec of choice for raiding and pvp.
---
Hope this helps. Im not hugely knowledgeable on hunters.
---
Healing is the single most engaging role in raiding, it is never dull. Its only slightly in 5mans when you completely outgear the place but at that stage youre prob only running dmt mainly
---
Not to mention, if I’m leveling as feral (and why wouldn’t I) I generally spec for the bear talents rather than kitty. So I miss out on things like extra combo points, energy returns, just a few things that rogues get from assassination or combat. 
---
I remember people killing certain cats/gorillas for drops to sell in Vanilla. Probably lots of other stuff too that I probably didn't notice. In general gold farmers don't bug me as much unless they're selling. I remember getting whispers all the time from Chinese gold sellers. However if someone saw an obvious botter or whatever we would do everything in our power to disrupt them/report them.
---

---
If you're a social player though, it should be possible to befriend the right persons in a guild and as such there should be no major problems. Classic is a social game, foremost.
---
PS : However, it should be noted that Enhancement Shamans are not that good in PvP. They're very easily countered and the "big WF procs" aren't nearly as impressive as you'd think at first.
---
Shamans are great because you have tools such as purge, chain heal (if you are going Resto), totems, ghost wolf form, and reincarnate. So if you choose shaman it really is not a bad choice. For PvE you would want to go Resto and for PvP you probably would have more fun as Enhamcement.
---
Personally I am leaning towards warlock or shadow priest.
---
&gt; I was told by my guild leader after that raid that I was to go holy to heal, as they couldn't afford to have a tank that couldn't do his job due to boss mechanics. If trash had that immunity, what's to say a boss couldn't have a phase like that?
---
Your GL was a massive toolbag and fucked your guild. Kara is much easier with a prot paladin tank.
---
Honestly some of that is going to be a hard call to make, reimplementing bugs intentionally has got to be a dev nightmare.
---
Druids and pallies will only be shown love as a very last resort. It's hard to fight it after years of stigma.
---
They didn't say that as far as I can tell. The RL *could* have been the MT, but for all we know they were the MT and the RL was the hunter.
---
In all honesty I'm not even against it, I thought I would be but after leveling a few characters on very populated pservers I realized how much of a turnoff that will be for new players. For people who already know where the quests are etc it might not be such a big deal, but for new players its going to be a nightmare without some form of sharding
---
Your best moment in PvP will be paired up with a well geared Arms Warrior, as you are healing him as Resto, purging Priests and Paladins in BGs. You are guaranteed a raid spot as Shamans are not a popular class, as totems are wanted in practically all groups. Note again: Resto mostly.
---
And leveling one, is pretty fun, compared to say, Warrior, Paladin or Mage, which are in my opinion snooze fests.
---
But the issue here is that tables turn at 60, and those classes all excel at one or even two things, while you excel at really nothing. Your best ability is that of AoE healing in raids, while the Mage is top range DPS by Naxx and a force in PvP. The Warrior is the best tank and best DPSer in MC and BWL. Paladins are the best PvE and PvP healer.
---
Shamans simply do not have a "best", even Druids can claim they are the best flag carriers in the game, its a niche role, but its at least *something*.
---
By all means play what you enjoy, but be careful not to fall for the "this is fun at level 41!" meme. Because the end game is quite different. 
---
My memory of Shaman class in Vanilla, was that it was the class you rolled if you were too late for the content patch and needed a raid spot. Roll a Resto Shaman and guilds will be offering you the red carpet to join. But there was a reason for this: Few wanted that role, hence the demand.
---
I don't know if there's a popular term for it, but they seem like sort of the opposite of speedrunners. Speedrunners complete games as fast as possible, often with very weak stats. The pirate server raider community seems to want to crush the content as hard as possible and time is not a consideration - if it takes them weeks to get BiS everything and hours to get every possible world buff just so they can clear MC ten minutes faster they seem to be okay with that.
---
I have no clue where you're pulling that 70 AP from. 12 strength from the improved Strength of the Earth totem equals 24 AP.
---
This means that you'd give ~44 AP more than a resto shaman would, and that's being generous since WF isn't a 19-20AP increase and doesn't proc off OH swings.
---
That 44 AP increases goes down to 20 if you have a resto shaman running the buffed STR totem. Yeah, not worth it.
---
1) proper elemental shamans are unironically a better healer in pvp than "deep" resto shamans
---
2) shamans are the ultimate middle finger to everything in vanilla. they can ruin everything 1v1 with diligence because of how absolutely stubborn a class they are. not to mention if you sync up a lightning bolt, chain lightning, and shock combo or LB -&gt; NS/CL -&gt; shock you can straight up yeet someone to the graveyard if you see a crit or two in there
---
but as you say, you doubt their viability in 1 v &gt;1 situations. mages and rogues are realistically your only options if thats what youre really looking to do. however, mage kind of shines in the sense that it can react to danger like no other class. on the other hand, if the shaman can see the 1 v &gt;1 coming and has critical placement on the map and has totems down, its sort of like approaching a guard tower as a rioting prisoner. theres a lot of distance you have to traverse, youll be shot by the time you get there, and so on
---
if youre truly looking for trying to 1 v &gt;1 as a shaman, youre going to need a rocket helmet and some magic dust. that being said, most world pvp is just 1v1 ganking unless youre sitting at tethis or youre hanging out in the yolomance castle waiting for some people to get stuck at the door
---
Druids are perfectly fine for any non raid dungeon.
---
Pallies only have issues because they can't taunt and most DPS are retards that can't manage threat.
---
I'm still annoyed they made that and the paladin one baseline
---
**&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore**
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don’t be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like. We have chosen to run with the suicide kings loot distribution method as well.
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel that is fresh, still getting everyone invited to it. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.
---
Bnet: Feral#11785 Discord: Feral#0846
---
Nobody is really going to bother with any of that since there are no rewards for doing it.
---
youve misread my question, but yes, almost everybdoy who makes a warrior wants to be a dps hero. i cant say i blame them since r14 warriors trainwreck people and naxx warriors reside on the top of the charts, but still: do you think there will be enough prot warriors to sustain the population, or do you think blizzard will do something to improve druids/paladins to try to increase the number of tanks available?
---
That’s a mile...
---
Stealing items is against the TOS and Blizz will take action against the player and get the mats back. It was this way in Vanilla so hopefully they have GMs to assist.
---
I second this, I was in Rooster Teeth guild for a bit (around 1.10ish patch), only 500 displayed on the list, but the guild easily broke that number from what I remember.
---
cant spell succubus without SUCC
---
but can you really blame warlocks who do that? charm into 10 billion soul fire crits isnt NOT hilarious when it happens
---
Tanks levels, get geared, and stop doing certain content. Once a tank gets 'x' loot from 'y' dungeon - they probably don't want to run it anymore (as they have nothing to gain). The cycle of loot.
---
There will be times on every server where there is a prot warrior shortage. *(There won't be a warrior shortage, though ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )*
---
If a group can adapt to a prot pal or bear - then sure. They're viable under certain circumstances in 5mans. But the group *does* have to adapt. Give the pal time to drink between pulls - and time to get a few conc ticks. Give the bear a few swipes &amp; time for CDs. 
---
Asking some folks to adapt is a big ask, though. If you want to play a non-standard tank or dps (ret pal, bear tank, etc) -- join a guild of folks who want to adapt and defeat, instead of just steamrolling. 
---
Absolutely not.
---
There will be a massive tank shortage, perhaps the biggest WoW has ever seen, even bigger than it was in Vanilla. 
---
There is a tank shortage in retail WoW, and tanks more or less play like melee DPS with aggro. Imagine telling players they have to stance dance, spam Sunder all day, mark targets, focus on Armor and Stamina as Druids etc? I dont foresee modern 2019 gaming audience being into that. They are not even into dual wielding Demon Hunters jumping around or 2H Death Knight tanking, and those classes are the definition of "edgy" and "cool".
---
I dont think private servers are any indication of what is to come. Because those servers are usually populated with strictly hardcore players, who are comfortable with the role. Classic live will be a very different situation.
---
I dont see any issues for you finding groups, you will be able to find a group within 5 seconds if you so desired as a Druid. Same with Paladins.
---
End game raiding will still mostly be Warriors, with a few Druids maybe here and there. No Paladins, never.
---
&gt; This falls under the category of "Class uniqueness and variety" why change it? Why dilute it?
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; In 5 mans, why not take a shadow priest or a ret to fill the non combat res hole in the group? 
---
I think you answered your own question.
---
If you take a druid healer in a 5-toon run that means you also need a DPS shaman, DPS paladin or DPS priest and all of those options are kind of mediocre compared to a mainspec DPS.
---
And like you said, it doesn't matter in a raid. It doesn't matter in world content. It's just a pain in the butt for 5-toon instances which adds no meaningful gameplay, because druids were never the favoured 5-toon healers in the first place. Let the druids rez people in 5-toon, it will be fine.
---
It's also hard to fight it when they're crushable etc and aren't really viable in many raid encounters.
---
There's no real stigma outside of raids.
---
They'll be scarce for all the dungeon groups, but likely slightly overpopulated for raids. Druids will tank dungeons (and they need 0 changes to do it).
---
&gt;I want to see people doing more than just speed run raids in Classic.
---
Then... then don't speed run raids?
---
&gt;Instead I'd love to see people doing some of the self-made hardmodes.
---
So do self-made hardmodes.
---
For horde, all things considered, I'd rank the races as Orc &gt; Troll &gt; Tauren. Your race should never affect your ability to get a raid spot. Guild Leaders and Raid Leaders generally look for attendance, willingness (to learn and get better) and preparedness (are you in the right spec, do you have your consumables). Once BWL is released, every Hunter will go after the crossbow off Chromaggus, because it's the best ranged weapon in the game at that point, and from that point to the end of the game (PvE wise) you will only ever use Crossbows, so the +WS racial to bows from Trolls becomes useless.
---
Even during the early raiding tiers, the difference as a Troll (assuming equal skill, gear, latency) isn't enough to offset the 25% chance to resist stuns and extra pet damage as an Orc. Berserking is nice, but it may actually make things worse for you if you can't stand absolutely still. Many trash mobs have stuns, you'll resist 25% of them, not to mention the obvious benefits in PvP. 
---
Of course...none of those things matter if you prefer the aesthetics of a certain race. Play whatever you think looks the coolest.
---
Assuming Blizzard doesn't patch it, as a Hunter you'll be able to solo farm Dire Maul North tribute runs, which will require that you be Engineering (because you need to craft charges to blow open doors, the charges are only useable if you're an Engineer). It's probably best to just take Mining as your other profession so you can be self sufficient. You can achieve 3 runs per hour for roughly 80 raw gold per hour. Plus any books you find at the end of each run can be sold on the AH for gold. It's pretty much the best source of static gold in the game, and only achievable by Hunters (solo).
---
For leveling just stay in BM from 10-40 and go straight for Bestial Wrath. In world PvP you will be very hard to kill and your pet will pretty much destroy anything that moves while you tab out of the game. From 41-60 you'll typically go down Marksmanship to support the 31 points you already have in BM. For early raiding you should/will spec 18 points into Survival for the Surefooted talent, because you'll need hit (aim for 8%) and alot of the early gear won't have any. A 2/31/18 build is a good starting point. As you gain +hit from gear, you'll spec out of the Surv tree and into the cookie cutter 20/31/0 raid spec.
---
For PvP you typically wouldn't spec more than 21 points in Marksmanship (for Scatter Shot).
---
ele shaman damage is actually overwhelming in pvp. if you cast lightning bolt -&gt; chain lightning -&gt; a shock, all 3 spells will hit within a few split seconds of one another and whatever you hit gets yeeted to the graveyard
---
the scaling of ele is quite nice since the gear they get access to (especially the r13/r14 pieces) grant them warrior levels of armor and health. the damage is always there because of how controlled it is. rank 1 shocks, earthbind, tremor totem, and purges dont cost much mana at all they always remain a considerable threat even when out of mana and limping around
---
however, their raid damage is pretty garbage because they have no real mana forgiveness. mages get mana when they crit and they have gems. warlocks have life tap. clearcasting doesnt proc nearly enough to make that much of a difference
---
Yeah. 
---
You have to be pretty gullible to think that right now at ActiBlizz HQ a panicked CFO is thumping printouts on the table and hysterically repeating "This Classic project will bankrupt us! Bankrupt us!" while the CEO stares heroically out the window and says "Never mind the goddamn money... this is *for the fans.*"
---
Classic exists because someone made a business case for it. That line about "It’s a passion project for you folks that have been diehard Classic fans and have been asking us to provide a real Vanilla server for over 10 years" is purest marketing fanservice. They know the buzzwords that get repeated here, and they are mirroring them back.
---
kek!
---
Race doesn't mean anything even for the top 0.01%. Alliance side gets ~5-10 more agility at 60 if they pick nelf, horde side gets ~2-3 more autoshots over a boss fight if they pick trolls. The only time race would matter is for PVP where orcs are the strongest by far, and that obviously doesn't affect your raid spots.
---
If you're serious about raiding, you're going engineering for the extra DPS as well as the numerous tools you get in WPVP (friendly advice, go gnome spec). Even if you're playing casually, engineering makes wpvp a lot more fun and is definitely worth it. Skinning can make you decent gold from devilsaurs (though prices will obviously not be near what they are on pservers) and herbing can make you decent gold from everything. 
---
I doubt alchemy is worth it. Be ready to run endgame dungeons *a lot* to get the alch recipes to drop and hope you reserved them because they'll be going for a couple hundred gold at the minimum on the AH. You could save a lot of gold getting the herbs yourself and getting a friend/guildie to make the pots. You'll rarely need to flask for raids as hunter so that's nice.
---
BM for leveling, MM for raids. No matter what you do you'll always want to dip points in MM for Aimed Shot. 20/31/0 is the cookie cutter raiding spec that you'll use from MC to post-Naxx. You can go MM/Surv for PVP and not miss out on much outside of pet damage.
---
* [20/31/0 raid spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ce0M0xxZViohtht) You can swap the imp res to max out stamina but I wouldn't recommend it
---
* [2/31/18 marks/surv spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cbZxiohthtcfbmoh) You can swap out the first row of MM if you don't want the stun for PVP and you can swap out practically everything in the first 3 rows of surv depending on what you prefer.
---
I dont think TF is the BiS for a main tank.... probably a nice boost but not thé BiS in Vanilla. But definitively not a Hunter’s weapon.
---
ive seen this time and time again on new servers... things go great for the first two weeks, then tanks are totally kitted out with their 5 man gear and they just start to raid log and theres a month where theres a severe shortage and this kind of creates a phenomenon where the popularity of non-guild-raid tanks comes in waves
---
i just wonder if theres going to be an annoyingly chronic lack of prot warriors overall that will end up detracting from the average players experience
---
For 5/10 mans? Maybe a little at first. Most of the pserver crowd on here came from when Nost launched, a lot of them dont remember how the pserver vanilla meta was back in 2011. You dont need to be prot spec to tank a dungeon, everyone whose played WoW knows that, but the Wrathbabies/Catanoobs as they were called back then came in with the assumption that they knew how the game worked. I would say somewhere between half and 2 thirds of the warriors back then couldnt tank "because \[theyre\] fury". I am almost certain were going to end up with that same meta when Classic launches from that same mindset. 
---
This means, yes I think theres going to be a lot of people out there desperate to let Paladins and Druids tank. The current pserver meta has settled to the point where everyone realizes that warriors are 5 man tanks, but it might take a few months for it to take full effect for Classic.
---
For raids? I have no reason to believe there wont be enough tanks based on pserver meta, nor from the vanilla days. Prot Warriors are only really 2 or 3 per guild. The main thing about prot warriors is that theyre often the most committed players going in, which means less turnover and high consistency. This means that they dont have to be as large in number because you arent cycling through different tanks every few weeks.
---
Do it, he will.
---
Can you imagine how amazing it would be coming across a Hunter in WPVP, attacking him in melee...and watching as he pulls out a Thunderfury and some other epic offhand, and he's actually a full survival/BM melee bybrid who proceeds to whip yours ass? I'd watch the hell out of that.
---
this is going to sound ultra stupid, but one of my favorite hardmode events is simple yet brutal. the rules are as follows:
---
1) you go to BRD with gray vendor items
---
2) you are allowed to equip whatever drops along the way, whether it be random mob loot or boss loot
---
3) use your talent points however you want since it kind of gets unrealistic if agree to use none at all or if you choose to spend X points every time you down a boss. however, thats like the heroic mode, so if youre keen...
---
4) victory is determined by the death of emperor
---
it takes forever and the group can strategize a great deal of ways
---
-------------------
---
aside from that, i used to do UBRS races on off nights with my guild. things got a little hectic. it also has the benefit of pulling up flask of the titans recipes for your guilds alchemists or bank if you subsidize tank consumable costs

**&lt;Always East&gt;   |   Semi-Hardcore   |   PvP   |   Server Region: NA, but all are welcome!   |   Faction: Alliance**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"**  Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
\- We are players spanning throughout multiple expansions of Retail WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content.
---
\- We look forward to reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts.
---
\- Everyone earns their spot with us, regardless if you are a Raider, PvPer or Social.
---
\- Above all else, we strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"**
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever!  At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up.  Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but again - as stated above - we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people!  We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics.  Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week, with a floating third when/if needed; **Wednesday and Thursday** (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - **NOT** when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST**.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST**.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be **READY** to raid when the time comes.
---
**Reach out if you have questions!**
---
We can be reached at  Parker#1571 or Tharkun#4460 on discord.  Or drop me a DM via Reddit.

And if they don't deliver than thats a few thousand subscriptions that they lose within a couple months. From a business standpoint they have to get this right, otherwise they could yjave pumped out some other drivel of a cash shop game. The market may just realize that this is what players want. I'm a pessimist but with that being said, Classic could revitilize the gaming industry.

[I think you misspelled orc, my short bearded one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo)
---
I leveled a rogue and a druid recently. 
---
When I leveled the rogue, I was very meticulous about getting the best weapons I could every few levels, and having strong gear. The damage was good and the downtime frequent, but it wasn't terrible.
---
When I leveled the druid, I felt like I was absolutely *demolishing* everything almost instantly. Ravage into Rake into a low combo point Rip and it was dead in a few seconds, and I was already raking / ripping the next mob. It was *insane* the speed at which you kill. Not only was killing much faster than the rogue (if you take into consideration more than 1 mob, as rogue can kill 1 mob decently quick in a vacuum), there is no down time between fights. 
---
Also, the damage isn't low in a group while leveling / dungeons. It is very high. It's not until max level that it slows down (a lot). Shred does a ton of damage.
---
Hi, /u/RealDruidPVP
---
If you have a buddy that is rolling warrior, Shaman+Warrior is the ultimate offensive combo.
---
Even when leveling up, when you get level 32 for windfury totem, his damage will basically double, and you don't have any real down time because he can kill so quick with your heals.
---
is it too outlandish to believe it's both a passion project to the developers who are working on it AND a highly anticipated financial success by the higher ups?
---
also when he mentions the potential bad news about possibly cash shop. I mean... weren't they really clear about these things during the Blizzcon?
---
No.
---
I get you want to make videos but really dude, shits getting old. Make a top 10 video or something fuck.
---
Warriors are almost guaranteed to be the most played class. If there aren't enough tanks, people will go prot.
---
Gnomes, their best friends, make them the best guns  and gadgets to kill filthy greenskin.
---
Dwarves do win.

&gt; And if they don't deliver than thats a few thousand subscriptions that they lose within a couple months. From a business standpoint they have to get this right, otherwise they could have pumped out some other drivel of a cash shop game.
---
Sort of. If Classic is just terrible, they will lose money. I assume.
---
If Classic is exactly like retail vanilla including all the shittiest elements, they will make a certain amount of money.
---
But do they make more money or less money if they fix some of the shittiest elements with judicious, minor changes of the same kind of scope they made in every other patch? The kind of stuff that would have been very welcome in 1.13, if 1.13 had come out in 2007?

Some more-Catholic-than-the-Pope #nochanges shut-ins will rage on the internet and unsubscribe. But other people might well enjoy 1.13 more and stay subscribed longer.
---
If you think they aren't weighing up that issue and figuring out how they can make the best game possible while causing the minimum amount of forum squawking from #nochanges types, I think you are naive.
---
This could well be why they aren't showing us anything - they absolutely do not want to fire up the idiots by revealing any #changes that are not thoroughly tested and polished.
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
It can though. Do you not know what the devilsaur mafia is?
---
Druid rogue pally. 
---
It's true though. It's alot bigger of an inconvenience to head back from your hearth location versus just doing a corpse run. It always made me laugh 
---
It's not outlandish to believe it is both to some extent, but I think it's a bit naive to believe that when the rubber meets the road, when there turns out to be a clash between "passion project" and "financial success", that "financial success" is not going to walk away the winner.
---
I feel like I'd want to do engineering for the pvp. Would mining and herbalism not be a good combo? I can't remember but I don't think you can track both at the same time?
---
40 man raid of level 1 and 2 toons downs him in under 30 minutes after launch on some obscure/low pop server, guaranteed. They'll all bail on the server after the kill.
---
Depends. Keep in mind ironforge is in an amazing continent location. Easy access to pretty much everything. It isn't that bad.
---
Do that yourself then, or find people who feel the same way to do it with.
---
Absolutely they are weighing options. They have to get this right, else they lose money and their possible player base loses faith.
---
I've never seen anybody misspell Troll so many times and so badly.
---
\&gt;asking for 10 years
---
You were always going to make classic. You were just milking your base for revenue.
---
What class are you playing exactly that allows you to run from a Druid?  Only thing I can think of is a warlock fear 
---
I still see hogger murdering them all when his buddies.
---
I do know, what it is, and it's good for the game.
---
you should read [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9evxli/dwarf_race_is_the_best_prosperity_and_wealth/) about dwarf supremacy.
---
First of all this dumb "July release" shit needs to stop. 
---
Second of all, they're not going to cancel a project they announced, hyped up and had a demo for, and are almost done with. What would be the point? This will probably be the second least expensive project they have, only behind remastering Warcraft 3. They have literally no reason to cancel it and they'd barely be saving any money by doing it, and they'd lose out on a lot. 
---
Just sit tight and wait til mid June for the media hype, then it'll get released sometime in August or September. 
---
Big disadvantage? No. It might *maybe* be *barely* noticable, sometimes. 
---
I'm rolling whatever I feel like, personally, and that's coming from someone who loves PvP. I'll take enjoyment over miniscule min/max. 
---
As paladin it is better to just tank 2 hander

Vanilla 101 - How to chose the best race for your class.
---
\- Can it be a Dwarf?
---
\- Pick Dwarf.
---
I’m so amused that you’ve been posting on here for a year begging for changes you aren’t going to get. 
---
Well the biggest issue I find with kitty leveling is you can’t use shred. It might not be the most efficient, but I get a kick out of using gouge and then backstab. It maximizes damage done while minimizes damage taken, and doesn’t hold you back too much in terms of speed. 
---
Meanwhile claw is just so unsatisfying to use. And yeah, I’m at 54 atm, it’s reeally starting to slow down. Around 35-45 is the sweet spot imo but they fall off right as the grind gets really punishing. It’s nice never having to drink but I’d rather 50% effficiency 50% speed over 100% efficiency 0% speed.
---
I agree with you here, but hate it when I'm halfway through the quests in an area, then find one I missed hiding behind the inn or something.
---
But I agree - focusing too much in the minimap takes you out of the world.
---
In the end, I'm going to play without any add-ons for the first while, just to make it seem more vanilla-like.
---
yeah, true. especially because we know a lot of the decisions in bfa must have lead to huge sub drops but apparently not enough for the execs to care. lowkey hoping that the threat of people being ready to go to private servers will make them try harder this time
---
Hey thanks! Though I do remember the occasional whisper from a good seller in vanilla, I think you're spot on here :)
---
^ this
---
&gt; Not across all server no. The hardcore crowd will have pre-made guilds which means they will head in lumps toward certain servers only.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Just stay off those servers.
---
How will I know which ones they go to? Also you'd think if there are enough of these hardcore guilds and have access to the aforementioned information, they would want to spread across all servers so they are the dominant guild?
---
You manage to miss the point entirely.
---
The point is that the dev vision and the corporate reality have been mismatched.
---
Historically on a new server opening, hundreds of players would make nude gnomes and run them to Elwynn to fight higher. You’d lag the shit out of IF and the tram and any zone you went to. 1fps and dc/crashes the whole way.
---
Blackrock US would do this to the RP realms as well whenever we went down. In fact I had a gnome called Brdown for like a decade. 
---
&gt;  I'm not sure where you got the "They better release expansions doe or else it'll fail" part.
---
The apparent majority of this sub wants TBC and WotLK, expansions which invalidate the entirety of Vanilla content, which introduce flying mounts, which introduce LFG. It's mind boggling.
---
Guild Bank. Just a vanilla basic one. So no account bank sharing alts.
---
I really hope they dont take any ideas from diablo and implant them in classic. I would like to see cut content like isle of dragons and a emerald nightmare raid or end game area if they dont go with BC servers
---
Every blue post has to be political sounding smh
---
Yeah I know what you mean. Playing with retail guys will be a more chill and immersive experience instead of the usual extremely fast pace private server rush. 
---
I used to be an enchanter in vanilla. You should find an enchanter you like and use him for your needs. Someone you grouped with that was fun. I was able to make money enchanting by repeated customers
---
I was our better geared tank too. Dropping me from the core cost the guild weeks of progression, and our offtank quit the guild because he didn't like the new mt.
---
Right off the bat, I can tell you the number one reason why they won't have token features on classic.
---
So a big part of MMOs is getting the players to stick around longer. Even though they worked some of the methods for doing this in BFA, it's obviously a priority. Reputation gating, RNG gating, general time gating. They make money off time gating, as long as the players are will to put up with it.
---
What better way to force people to play longer, than to say you have to go back to regular WoW to earn more tokens. That immediately splits playtime, and people will do it too.
---
I had no intention of going back to regular WoW, but if my tokens run out, I might farm some gold in it. It depends on how effective I still am, or I might just pay the sub. Blizzard is fine with either.
---
We always ran level 1 tauren raids on the crazy cat lady outside SW when we were that bored. Damned good times. 
---
Go watch the world first Ragnaros kill on youtube. You see warriors with typhoon, rogues not using SnD, guy with fiery weapon enchant. It’s a complete shitshow compared to even the worst MC pug on private servers.
---
People today are too good for vanilla. The average vanilla player today is far better than any Nihilum or Method player from 2004. To make up for this, private server devs overtune the bosses and disable all world buffs. This will not be the case in Classic and I fear the game is going to be a joke.
---
A lot of guilds didn't realise that TBC made the idea of a unitary "main tank" just a bad idea. You wanted a paladin tank for fights like Magtheridon, a warrior tank for fights like Gruul and I am sure there were fights where a druid tank was optimal.
---
Any decent Kara raid headed up by a tankadin will have a bear or rior OT who can handle the wyrm swarms. Benching your tankadin because of some piddling trash packs is just daft.
---
Also you can *sort of* tank those wyrm packs by spamming cleanse on yourself. It's messy as hell but you do hold some aggro and it's better than nothing.
---
Paladin tanks are rightfully stigmatized. Feral tanks are not. They're a perfectly acceptable replacement to warriors until high tier raid content. 
---
True shot aura is decent ap 
---
&gt; yeah, true. especially because we know a lot of the decisions in bfa must have lead to huge sub drops but apparently not enough for the execs to care.
---
The curse and blessing of WoW is they have to reinvent the whole damn game every xpac or so. It sounds like BFA screwed the pooch in a lot of ways, but I never played it so I have no opinion. I do believe they sincerely try to make a good game each time, but it doesn't always work.
---
&gt; lowkey hoping that the threat of people being ready to go to private servers will make them try harder this time
---
Two things. The fact that the "purists" are likely to walk away makes them less valuable as customers, not more valuable. Also when Blizzard stands to make money by shutting down pirate servers they will be willing to spend a lot more money on lawyers to do so.
---
Oh, derp
---
Improvements to add-ons. Surely they are using modern LUA, even if the front end looks classic. I highly doubt they would require add-ons to be written in a LUA that's over 10 years old. So I suspect add-ons could operate better, plus there's years of experience in the community on building them.
---
Druid tanks are cool, they can accomplish all the content just fine. 
---
Paladin tanks in raids have an unclimbable mountain. However I'd rather take a paladin tank to dungeons because they have amazing AE threat, and do a fuckton of reflect damage.
---
The question if there will be enough tanks, the answer is yes, because if the demand for tanks is high people will see the opportunity and subsequently start tanking. Think of it like a market space if tanking helps someone accomplish their goals faster they will start tanking.
---
Warlock dps spikes in Naxx and pulls ahead of Mage. But Mage dps is way better up until Naxx. During MC/BWL Warlock dps is bottom tier. 
---
Mage is infinitely better in group pvp with their endless cc and survivability. Warlock just doesn’t bring the same utility. 
---
Sharding is dangerous D= is ruining retail since 2011
---
This is the only real struggle in Vanilla that all guilds deal with it. 
---
Good list. Having a 60 Mage alt is very common for healers. 
---
Move up to a more hardcore/competitive guild if you’re that guy. No reason to linger around in a guild where people don’t use consumes. 
---
Hardcore guilds don’t wipe during progression so for them it’s worth it. Casual guilds use world buffs when the content is on farm status. 
---
Yes you can. You can use front shredding. This makes your kill speed 200% faster.
---
I think the private server community will want to stick together because they enjoy the competitiveness and hasty progression. All it takes is 2-3 top private server guilds to roll on the same realm and everyone else will follow because they know that this realm will be the most active and have the best pvpers and all the world first kills will happen there. The risk of playing on a realm with mostly retail players is that the realm might die off once retail players burnout. 
---
no crushing in 5 mans
---
Tsm does exist in vanilla. It just isn’t as advanced at retails.
---
I'm aware of that.
---
Obviously
---
ah dang, those are good points i hadn't considered, that really sucks :( hoping for the best anyhow! we'll never know for sure until classic comes out 
---
As an avid ganker, even ganking lowbies, I have to say druid.
---
Roots, hots, and most of all unmounted mobility all make druids incredibly hard to gank.
---
Weak Auras
---
Classic will feel like OG vanilla, I would say the overwhelming majority will be people who have never played it. You will see so much rage when they wipe in deadmines as they overpull a couple goblins.
---
Isn't all they said there won't be one at launch? And everything they said at Blizzcon is subject to change.
---
&gt; And your reputation is everything in classic wow.
---
Tell that to automated ban happy right click report ActiBlizzard.
---
Speed runs are a result of no extra rewards from doing a "hard mode" if there was insentive then there would be an audience for it. If hakkar dropped double loot from all aspects being up then there is a reason. Bragging rights are not enough. 
---
Speed runs accomplish the goal of clearing the raid in an efficient time frame therefore people want to do that.
---
safe to say, the PVP realms will be nothing but horde
---
Don't trust a nobody. Guildless, or part of a notorious guild (Russian guilds on pservers), then you can get scammed and you have no recourse.
---
If they're in an even semi-known guild, big or medium sized, if you see them often, they're clearly a main, etc, then you're &gt;95% safe.
---
I've had traded to me and traded away enchanting mats, felcloth, arcanite, etc etc and not *once* have I been scammed out of the mats.
---
I've had people COD me stuff without putting an actual gold amount in, and I've done the same, etc. Both in retail Vanilla and in pservers. And not a single time have I witnessed a scam. When people are socially connected they tend to act honorably.
---
That's why people in the isolated pseudo-connected internet age are so depraved of some basic values which were stronger when we knew our neighbors and had small town dynamics - something that Vanilla WoW creates. It's an amazing feeling to know upwards of 100 people to varying degrees of closeness.
---
It's true. 3 points in imp gouge makes it last 5.5 seconds and you drop combat after 5. You can make a spammable macro the puts you into stealth and if you are in stealth saps your target.  Let's you sap bandage so you can save the mats for blind. 
---
I'm guessing an imbalance of 2:1 on PVE servers and maybe 4:1 on PVP
---
Front shred is a pserver glitch and for the purposes of this conversation isn't really relevant. 
---
Well we don’t really know if it will be In classic or not, so it is relevant.
---
Regardless what your opinion of the method is, it exists and can be considered as a way to level quickly.
---
&gt; show true skill
---
Stuff like [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/SpinelessFunnyWaterNinjaGrumpy)?
---
&gt; doing raids without any addons or voice chat
---
&gt; Doing raids while exclusively keyboard turning and clicking.
---
I think you have no idea what "true skill" means. Someone that cuts off their own legs before running a marathon isn't "truly skilled", they're insane and nothing else.
---
I don't because it blows up everyone expectations and pushes certain classes out of dungeons no matter how good you are
---
Linking professions in trade makes sense to prevent scamming, so that seems like something reasonable
---
I’m 99% sure it won’t be in Classic. Considering from stabbing is a bug, and it’s not an element of the modern engine, we won’t be seeing it. I know I *can* frontstab on pservers, but I don’t like to. Feels like cheating when I’m playing for fun, I look stupid juking around a mob like a twitchy spaz, and it’s not going to be in the legitimate game. Which, is more related to the wowclsssic subreddit than my own private server playstyle choices. The point is, *in the game this sub is about*, it will be fixed, so i don’t like to discuss classes pros and cons and mention a private server bug.
---
 I disagree in it being a private server bug. It could of been in the game at vanilla and could be argued that because it was there before. The engine should allow it. I don’t see it as a bug.
---
What are you talking about? 1% increased chance of crit \~ 1% increase in damage and threat for tanks is based around damage, so he is correct (assuming the player isn't crit capped). 
---
Dwarven IQ's are much higher than humans. 
---
Orcs score the lowest, but some attribute this to anti-orcish racism and their poverty status. 
---
None of the bands I played in were above hobby level, and we rarely played in front of an audience. It's just good practice to know what you're gonna do when you do a group activity instead of hoping you can wing it.
---
It’s been done plenty of times in the past during weekly maintenance. Servers wouldn’t all shutdown at the same time so people would flock to the last ones that remained online, create new characters and zerg him before that server inevitably also went offline
---
Why the heck did Servant's comment get downvoted? If he doesn't like the show that's fine, no reason to downvote. I listened to the episode with the fellows who played Everquest and I enjoyed it. I love hearing about the older mmos.
---
What was it about? Is there any archived episodes?
---
Oh my gosh I remember this is how I found TB. Him and all of his cata content. God I miss that cynical gosh darned britt.
---
you forgot
---
0) Instantly ambush crit them 100-0 since the rogue is 60 and the pally is low level.
---
Druids can disengage from battle so it's gotta be them. 
---
Mages can sheep and blink away
---
Rogues can sprint and vanish. Blind reagents aren't cheap man lol. 
---
Paladins are just annoying to kill since they can basically have 2-3 lives between bubble and LoH.
---
A good hunter can get away fairly easy once they get aspect of the pack.   
---
Non raid PvP gear as in items from PvE suited for PvP. Truestrike is not suited for PvP, Valor shoulders are. Devilsaurs are not suited for PvP, Reiver Claws are. See? :)
---
The big reason I am picking Orc over Troll is that I want to play a hard hitting Ambush build and Blood Rage seems great for that. The second big reason? I like the sneaking animation a bit more.
---
"[...] dedicated to trying [...]" :-(
---
Got any proof that this was a thing in vanilla?
---
Got any proof it wasnt?
---
Trolls are 400% the Dwarves of the Horde.
---
'Ey mon. 'ye be stealin' from Azeroth's WOONS
---
Don't forget that everyone and their mother knows about Orc's stun resist. A decent player playing a class with a stun will know not to rely on that stun, and to be prepared when it fails. For example, if I was an Ally rogue (hopefully dwarf) I wouldn't even bother trying Cheap Shot/etc on an orc.
---
&gt;It's also hard to fight it when they're crushable etc and aren't really viable in many raid encounters.
---
I know from first hand experiance that there is like 3 bosses that its stupid to have a feral tank mc-aq but besides that they are 100% **valid** on the rest of them but perhaps not optimal
---
Yea anyone can one shot a lowbie though, including ranged if the pally doesn't see them.  Also a lowbie can't really bubble hearth anyway.
---
Except name and shame is a reportable offense, and anyone can silence you with right-click report for it.
---
&gt;Give the bear a few swipes &amp; time for CDs.
---
Do you mean adapt as in cc more as they take more dmg? 
---
Why would you wait longer on a druid that builds more threat then a warrior? Also what cds are there to wait for as a druid, I know of one and its seldom used because usually its threat &gt; survivability if you are not underleveled in normal dungeons.
---
Player 1 buys a token in retail
---
Player 1 gives the token to player in retail
---
Player 2 gives player 1 good in classic
---
Why are you insisting this is not obvious?
---
what the fucking fuck. What a waste of time/effort/gear.
---
Guilds that bring meme-specs wont be killing Cthun or the last 5-or-so bosses of Naxx.
---
a good DKP system will have exceptions to certain pieces of loot, such as bindings.
---
It is beyond retarded to give binding to anyone but the maintank.
---
I know the feeling. In TBC you would want hunter groups.
---
Even in TBC you had to trade away the mats and simply trust the enchanter. I got scammed out of mongoose mats that way in early TBC.
---
Supply and demand. It will be a self correcting formula. When the warrors notice that they arent getting into groups and raids, some with respec protection to fill that gap. Tanking is not for everyone though but there are alot of players that just want to play the content and what spec they do it in will be of a lesser concern.
---
Nope, and nope.
---
For god sake, like it was cited million times: DM was released before the EU servers came live and before Ragna's first kill. It was not a joke back then, why would it be a joke now?
---
Just please stop whining basing on pserver release schedules.
---
Yes there will be enough prot warriors. You only need 2-3 prot warriors per 40 man raid and dps warriors/feral druids can fill in beyond that.
---
I guess you're mostly referring to 5mans. You don't need a prot warrior for non-raid content so dps warriors will do fine and feral druids are actually a great choice for most 5mans.  
---
If those will actually want to tank (for random people) will depend more on the attitude of tank-capable players and the community''s behaviour (e.g. blame or reckless overaggro) than on the number of theoretically available players.
---
You'll not always find a tank or healer or sometimes even dps but usually there are some around if you befriend them or make it worth their time.
---
It depends on how they handle realm transfers and stuff like that. Back in the day there were small faction imbalances, but when Blizzard opened for free realm transfers and stuff like that the smaller faction transferred en masse. I think that's how most of the one-faction servers were created. 
---
Unless they change the Spawntimers I doubt I will bother. [I will look like that...](https://i.imgur.com/pc3RzFQ.jpg)
---
There's a difference between meme specs and sub-optimal specs, first off. 
---
Second, not all guilds care as much about kicking down the doors of Naxx. It's not that big a deal tbh
---
The problem was less the adds and more the paranoia by our raid lead that a future patch might add a boss that has a phase where paladins couldn't generate threat. They didn't want to gear up a main tank and have it be useless for progression at some point.
---
My roommate (druid) and me (rogue) would do the same thing. We shed the lifeblood of many a 60 ganker at Nesingwary. When we arrived at the scene and it was a lower level we're just creep up beside the lowbie friendly and unstealth and /no when the baddie arrived. Usually they wisely fled.
---
I remember when I played last (during WOD) the Alliance on our server absolutely owned Hellfire Peninsula and just scoured it. Occasionally you'd see some level 66 guy wander into a capital city and beg for max level help, but overall people were pretty apathetic.
---
This doesn't work.  
---
&gt; Player 1 buys a token in retail.  
---
So far, so good.  
---
&gt; Player 1 gives the token to player 2 in retail.  
---
Player 1 cannot do this.  He can only list it on the Auction House for whatever the going price is.  He cannot trade it to someone else, or mail it, or list it for a silver while voice coordinating.  He can do none of these things.  
---
I'll await you turning all those frowns upside down....
---
That is an odd argument; I’m not the one claiming that the thing existed..
---
Because people nowadays are infinitely better than people from 2004. 
---
On my recent pvserver adventures I spent a bit of time using Waterwalking to skate away. Or just using waterbreathing to hide underwater.
---
This is actually really interesting.  I would not have guessed the 2.5 elemental piece in this.  Are they just in there because they can burst down undergears, or can they hold with the others?  Also, do they just grab the T 2.5 3 set bonus and then wear nax cloth?  
---
I guess I'm assuming there's a lot of gear on the server, so people would know.
---
This is amazing news, glad to hear it
---
Yeah but hots was never really very popular and was a joke amongst the moba community.
---
The game is the revenue generator.
---
"How did ActiBlizz fucking DARE raise the drop rate of Zhevra Hooves from 5 to 10%?! I am never playing a Blizzard game again and hope the dev team DIES"
---
Heroes of the storm was a shameless attempt to cash in on losing dota to steam and icefrog.
---
Well, they should definitely keep the word "classic" under it. But I do not understand why they changed the colors.
---
If the fans weren’t vultures they would probably be more easy going with their posts but they know anything they say is going to be torn apart.
---
I'm going to play with addons for my interface. Just nothing for quests. And missing a quest is for bad explorers but I know the feeing.
---
I don't think the raiders are the target demographic for Classic. Most people won't hit 60 in 3 months let alone have MC on farm.
---
They can't be passionate because they get paid?
---
Do you work for free?

I actually heard from my uncle who works at Nintendo that Activision is laying off 1 million people tomorrow.  
---
Classic is honestly screwed.  
---
Agreed
---
Is that so? I though naming and shaming was only "forbidden" on the forums, but fine within your own realm community where the other party can challenge the claims. Also you can't be silenced by "anyone", when we tested it on retail you needed quite a lot of ppl (we had a guild raid of 30-40 ppl reporting one guildie, and it took a while for the guildie to get silenced).

I roll dwarf in every game that allows me. But I must admit dwarf animations are terrible. They look like children. The two handed attack animation has them spin around like a kid swinging something to big for them. The dual wield animation is some awkward little turn around thing like a kid trying to imitate some martial arts stunt in a movie and the casting animation is just throwing their arms up in the air like a kid going “yaaayyy!”
---
“It’s a passion project” but we’re tossing in the loot system from wotlk/cata
---
loot issues / trading are different from trade scams. They still run trade scams trough GM's. Stuff you trade you can't restore through the automated item restoration system, you need to take this up with a GM. 
---
&gt;1% increased chance of crit ~ 1% increase in damage
---
Going from say, 30% crit to 33% crit is an increase of ~2.3% in damage. You aren't doing 100% damage, you're doing 130% (assuming crit = 200% modifier), 133/130 -&gt; 2.3% increase.
---
&gt;threat for tanks is based around damage
---
Not correct, warriors have substantial static base threat on their abilities that is not affected by the damage and/or critting. 
---
It's a little more complicated because critting on white swings generates more rage which lets you use more abilities, however for main tanks this often means more HS, which will replace white swings (and not generate rage regardless of hit/crit). 
---
Classic hasn't released yet and to be fair no one knows if they will ruin the game or not. Judging by blizzard and Activision's track record it's safe to assume they may. We shall see
---
People forget, they don't have to do something for those changes. They have to do a lot of work to remove features from the modern game. Nochanges means many changes in devs side.
---
Replace "Dwarf" with Orcs, Tauren and Trolls and you have a good post!

"Maraudon shouldn't be included at launch!"
---
Record it always.
---
English, Player versus Player -&gt; Suggest Realm -&gt; Accept
---
It's not practical but I had requested if people were willing to make an addon that tracks the NPC/Player that a warlock harvests Soul Shards from. Just as a neat little thing. Maybe preferring to make Healthstones out of Alliance souls and Soulstones out of Elemental souls or whatever. Just a little added flavor of RPG stuff. Maybe send a screenshot of a heated rival in PvP laughing out how you captured their soul.
---
But Maraudon was released in the EU on launch does that count?
---
This is my first time hearing of this addon and I love it.
---
Oh man this rules. It's almost like your character is writing a Journal about the mobs they fight. I really hope this comes out for classic.
---
A lot of people will have the (silly expectation) that since a game is old, everyone should know every encounter inside and out.

Don't forget that any member of a raid or dungeon can cause a wipe regardless of role. You can have a bad tank who's poor at holding aggro. You can have a DPS who overdoes it or pulls a mob. Anyone can stand in fire. Sometimes it's on the healer, sometimes not. Own your mistakes but don't let people make things your fault that aren't.
---
Most importantly if you don't like healing, don't. It CAN be stressful. 
---
Good tips!
---
While it might be really nice for the programmer, having every single object run in the update loop \*in case\* it has any abilities will really make your engine slow and sluggish (Especially if the ability checking etc is heavy). This is why programmers doesn't just allow any object to have an ability.
---
Crusader only dropped from a single mob type in North WPL.  
---
Lol. That’s something a pve ret pally would say. Be relevant and try hard, show you are learning and want to progress. That easy. 
---
A lot of travelling for starting zones, but low difficulty
---
well, actually, that was only so when private servers already had scripted all content, which is a recent thing.  In the first waves of quality pservers, a new raid was launched when it was done, which could be 6-9 months after the previous one.  Players had to suck it up, or take a break, there was no choice. 
---
Why is this downvoted lol 
---
Mages can sheep and afk for like 3 minutes....
---
That's the price you pay for playing on a super high  (overpopulated imho) population server.    In case you didn't know, there are other servers with a more blizzlike population,  in case you did know, you probably chose the high pop one, for some reason, like pvp.  So just accept that some quests are better to be skipped and go do quests that don't drop lvl 60 consumables. 
---
Mained dwarf in vanilla, it was sexy af
---
they are not losers, but smart players.
---
And no, it did not happen at such a grand scale in vanilla, as the population was much lower and players didn't know beforehand what alchemy ingredients they would need for the next raid. 
---
Make sure the agreement is in the game chat log and open a ticket if they scam you.
---
I try not to read into peoples downvotes too much. My guess was because I was basing my comment on just the first episode. Which was my mistake.
---
Having since listened to a few more up to date episodes, I'd say honestly I've changed my tune.
---
I still have a dead gnome on argent dawn that lost her life bravley fighting in orgrimmar during one of our gnome raids.
---
Hold on they're remastering Warcraft 3??
---
4. isnt necessarily true. If you have more mages in your roster and they don’t get invited they might just up and leave for another guild that needs mages.

You misspelled rouge
---
Customers are the new tester team.
---
Isn't that Curse? Or does Curse no longer exists?
---
&gt;  So, no mics, unless you bought one just for this guild.
---
umm no.  Half Life 1 and mods had built in voice chat.
---
I was on Teamspeak with my Star Wars Galaxies guild, then ventrilo for Lineage 2 and WoW
---
Great rogues:
---
\-Improved Sap low level players
---
\-Us Distration to temporarily inconvenience mounted players.
---
\-One-shot level appropriate low HP nightelf, and then hide on a nearby hilltop, laughing, as they spend ten minutes running around flaring, trying to get revenge.
---
I played on the same server as Leeroy Jenkins, after the video the server attracted a lot of fanboys.  One of these fanboys was a warrior called "Leeroysapren" (he couldn't fit in apprentice)
---
My guild took him to MC for a joke - he had terrible gear but by this point MC was on pure farm status.
---
Shadowstrike dropped and naturally this fresh 60 was the only person who wanted it.
---
"Disenchant it"
---
"What?  Leeroysapren needs t"
---
"Disenchant it, he's not a guildie"
---
Vent was stunned into silence, but our enchanter did it anyway.  Now that my friends is real power.
---
&gt; I'd think giving someone gear would make them want to stay with the guild. 
---
Heh, as a guild that was first to kill Lucifron on our server but gradually overtaken and behind by 2-3 guilds at least on AQ - I can tell you WoW was a pretty much constant cycle of losing and poaching players to other guilds.
---
The second someone thinks they can get more loot elsewhere then they are gone.
---
Yes, mostly. It don't catch everything, but it's so more convenient to use... Also does auto lfg for you (in a way you can't spam).
---
Great add-on overall.
---
Hey Ferahgo! Sorry for the late reply. I know Stewball was still around when VC rolled horde on Ner'zhul. During that time or shortly after, a popular player named Trance (previously Panda I think) joined VC and quickly moved to a leadership role for the Horde VC guild.
---
A lot of popular PvPers from BG9 probably knew of Trance, and some may be able to get you in contact with him. And he may be able to get you in contact with Stewball.
---
I also remember Stewball playing with Dezyne (I don't remember how to spell his name, but he was a paladin in VC) in Warhammer and I think Age of Conan. So if you can get in contact with Dezyne, that might be another good lead.
---
Great to hear from you. Sorry I couldn't help more.
---
Ideal is subjective depending on the goal.
---
What makes you think the game will die shortly after Naxx release?
---
:O
---
ofc it is 
---
TIL I haven't actually been playing the game after watching a video. Can you tell Blizzard to give me a refund for the years of sub?
---
Wow that UI is awful :D.
---
If Dwarves could be Mages I would still roll Undead.
---
I think WoW Classic should come with an old PC and a 800x600 resolution monitor, so we can have a TRUE VANILLA EXPERIENCE! /s
---
Can you not just trade the gold back? 
---
Help Joana make his quest add on. That should keep you busy 
---
Jump ahead 5 years, and we'll all be on the race to level 80 in the WotLK reboot. Death Knights will be dominating everything.
---
Explain more about this theivery my lad. 
---
For retail, not too long ago, maybe legion or WoD, was the last time Curse was used. It is *now* twitch app that is retail's current addon manager.
---
Forbearance was a thing in vanilla, they had to choose between bubble/loh during a fight
---
dwarf is the master race in any fantasy setting
---
They didn't rewrite the game engine for different shards. The game engine just renders the game.
---
What you are thinking of is the net code and server infrastructure. Which has been reworked to work over distributed servers and sharding to handle varying player population (increasing and decreasing how many active nodes they have running).
---
This is simply an issue of increasing the cap of each shard, or even simply turning it off completely and run each realm on two nodes like before (one database and one realm) just with a lot better hardware.
---
Untrue
---
Make them invested into character development. Nothing keeps you in the game like feeling of satisfaction when you are rewarded with exceptional character performance for all your hard work you've put into it.
---
And don't forget to bring them to STV around level 30 ;)
---
I wrote a guide on escaping and avoiding ganks recently which you can find here: https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=1056
---
It breaks down different classes ability to escape/avoid ganks.
---
Priest has too little HP and no speedy get out, just leveled and priest and my druid was way better at getting out of ganks.
---
Hey, have a look at my class/race comparison tool: you may find it useful for choosing which race to take for shaman.
---
https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1046
---
obviously you should farm all your elemental earth while you level. a REAL raider wouldn't need to farm at 60 /s
---
Often enchanters with good enchants are well known and their work makes them credible. One one server on the Horde side if you need a good enchant you usually go to Jeffry. There are some other enchanters but one stoods out with the quality and longevity of his top class services ;)  Faction enchanter...
---
What? Lol, a Rogue killing a druid leveling, dude I have killed rogues that attacked me by only using bear form and maul. It's the almost the equivalent of a warrior attacking a frost mage. There is no way in hell a rogue gets me if he doesn't  abuse me just engaging 2 mobs. And cat form leveling kills mobs very fast, just don't be an idiot and do green quests on green mobs like you always should on a PvP server. 
---
Druid is above mages for sure, no downtime makes a world of difference
---
There isn't any class that viable to to 1v2+. If you win a fight versus two other players, that means they're absolute garbage, or you outgear/outconsume/outlevel/outskill them by a *lot*. Numbers advantage is just too strong. You can think about it that way: for each GCD you spend, they can spend two. If you try to CC one of the enemies, the other one can freecast/gapclose with 0 punishment. You need to output 2 health bars worth of damage while they only need to bring down half of yours each. 
---
I've seen this mentioned before on this sub, I don't remember the context, but yeah, don't expect to be a superhero, you'll be disappointed with Classic if you do. 
---
Not sure if your guild experience was the same, but we had plenty of people not raiding reguarly in my old guild. People were doing their own thing, PvPing, chatting in Orgrimmar, grinding rep, leveling, leveling alts.  
---
The guild was a community, not a "pool of raiders".
---
Came here to say this, but gave up when I saw someone say it better than I could. 
---
This reads like someone who just hit lvl 40 on a pserver and is salty because a lvl 60 pushed him out of a farm spot. Get used to it, farm spot competition is a thing. Even on PvE server, there's competition for mob tags. Limited ressources and all that. 
---
Wait till you see the fully restored Dwarven faces.
---
There was no difference. Pretty much only the chinese guild STARS went to the Rnew Raids with full Naxx gear because they didn't want to miss their set bonuses. For raw power the new sets were definitely better though. But if you had to mix the power gain was arguably not high enough to warrant losing a bonus.
---
The 20 slot soul shard bag is usually very cheap. And you will need a lot of shards if you plan to raid. You can't Drain Soul trash in raids due to debuff limit. The second you land it, it will be interupted/knocked off by another debuff.
---
Just from memory, and I may be remembering TBC. But for cc stuff like sheep,fear, and stuns its effective duration is like full, to half to 3/4 to immune with the DR being refreshed on each new cast to 15 sec.
---
I could be wrong and probably am lok
---
This is only based on memory so take this with a grain of salt
---
1. Towards the end of vanilla Diminishing returns were a 15sec wait until the DR reset. Most add ons were based on 18sec to allow for ping and the server tic.
---
Just a nitpick. It should be way cheaper than the Warcraft 3 remaster.
---
The remaster needed a lot of artwork done, Classic just needed a few programmers. 
---
Then someone goes and writes "LFM have tank "
---
We are not talking about socials, this was specifically a dude claiming that "good recruitment policy" is to get 5 mages for 1 spot and "see who sticks along". 
---
With current farming/hoarding of mats, I'd say 2 hours. 
---
Private servers were a little different in that there was only one server and one gate to open. They didn't try to insta open because they wanted to get more than one mount and there is no cross server competition. In classic you may see a couple of severs open the gates right away to try for "world first" but otherwise I'd bet it will last few resets. It's certainly possible for one guild to gather all the mats before aq is released. 
---
I'm all no changes, but damn it would be funny if they switched up the requirements at the last minute. 
---
Will he be PvP tagged in Ironforge for simply being attacked first? 
---
If you want any sort of efficiency as mage you need to push your mana pool and that means you're dead. 
---
I didn't raid on my hunter before BC but from what I remember it's easier to lvl as BM then switch to MM at 60. As far as tradeskills go it's personal preference but I never liked having either herb or mining due to tracking, especially if you're going PvP server. Skinning and leatherworking would be my choice, killing beasts can give free food for pet as a bonus as well as making money &amp; levelling gear.
---
nah both elem and enh are good at 1vx. i did a fair amount of 1v3  as a geared enh shaman. 
---
especially with warstomp for cc. one of the reasons why i prefer taurens, cos one thing shamans lack is cc. warstomp into irone grenade is like 4 seconds aoe stunlock, into firenova totem for aoe burst. burst someone with stormstrike+shock, then set earthbind so melees won't hit you, wait for shock cd, and melees swing and burst the second guy, cast couple of heals to reset and finish last guys, switch to 1h+shield if needed to tank against melees. -works something like that.
---
plus you can use other engineering stuff for more cc. geared shamans are quitу tanky, you can also take -magic damage talents, which gives you time to kill someone and self heal to reset damage.
---
mage and shaman are my two preferable classes for solo pvp.
---
What?
---
Rank 1 frostbolt for the quickest casting time. Rank 1 polymorph. Rank 1 blizzard (rogue vanish or stealth). Rank 1 fireball (quick anti-vanish dot). Rank 1 arcane explosion.
---
I've never seen use of rank 1 CoC because you need it for damage. Maybe if you need to slow a cluster of people chasing flag in WSG, but still, I'd use max rank for that
---
lol, nope. enhs (or elems) can one shot some classes like rogues or mages even, if they are geared. SO if you start a fight one shotting someone, its not unreasonble to be able to 1vx, you can kite some other guy with earth bind, while hitting 3rd, and self heal to reset damage. 
---
with NS build both enh and shaman can insta heal full bar or their hp combined with heal pot.
---
classes which are good at 1vx is who can burst quick and kite/survive for a while. mage and shaman both can do it.
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond. If you're using all your rank 1 spells to save on mana because you only really want the cc effect where does your damage come from? it was my understanding the you used rank 1 frostbolt for the slow and rank 3 for damage.   
---
Are there unironically people who actually like trolls or is it just some edgy meme?
---
Are you really this bored. Fuuuark you need to think about something else.
---
&gt;outgear/outconsume/outlevel/outskill them by a lot.
---
I feel like you didn't read my comment but still replied to it. 
---
Stealth doesn't work when you're level 35 and the ganker is 60. They'll spot you from regular casting range.
---
It can and it probably will, but it's not the end of the world (Just more convenient than buying gold in actual vanilla).  
---
I can almost guarantee that people will trade gold in retail for gold in vanilla. So if say:  
---
A WoW token costs 20 euro and trades for 20.000 gold.  
---
I find someone who will trade 20.000 gold for 200 gold in vanilla.  
---
Then all I have to do is buy 5 WoW tokens, sell them in retail. Trade the money and then get them in vanilla.  
---
This will happen, but just as shady stuff happened in Vanilla. If people can't use WoW tokens to trade, they'll just use something else instead.
---
Exactly 
---
That's not even funny. It's just evil.
---
Yeah in bfa it's a problem. In vanilla it never was. 
---
correct, except it's not refreshed if the target is immune :)
---
Also it's not individual spells, they're grouped. E.g if you charge someone who's being attacked by a rogue you WILL mess up that rogues stun DR.
---
Rogues can go AFK without logging out. Vanish lol Blind lol  
---
Frost mages are super slippery and can get away from 1v2 or 1v3.
---
Everyone else can get invis pots.  
---
Completely agree. Otherwise, like in some pservers, there are people that start hoarding these from day 1
---
Didn't crushing blows happen automatically if you were too far in level below your opponent?
---
Why? He wasn't geared for MC, he wasn't part of our guild.  We took him for the lolz, he got to see MC and kill Rag months before he would have been able to get to that point the normal way
---
 kill two dwarfs in the morning. 
---
I kill two dwarfs at night. 
---
I kill two dwarfs in the afternoon 
---
And 'den I feel all right. 
---
I kill two dwarfs in time of peace and two in time of war. 
---
I kill two dwarfs before I kill two dwarfs. 
---
And 'den I kill two more.
---
I would if that was an actual thing and not some nonsense buzzword laden manifesto.
---
While I do like the hilarious scenario you describe (I wish someone would do a cartoon of it for reference), I don't think this project has a cost magnitude for it to be at the CFO/CEO desk until release and later. Unless the team is way bigger than what have been talked about and disclosed (hirings etc.), the size seem like a Google 20% kinda project or less...
---
I'd be interested to hear what actual Scottish people think of fantasy dwarves all having Scottish accents.
---
Yeah you kill mobs slightly slower but since you have almost no downtime its faster.
---
Fact is that druid is the only class able to really compete with hunter for server first 60
---
If the old requirements remain the same, then the gates will open the same day as the effort starts because the BWL-farming guilds will already have stockpiled the materials (atleast on populated realms). If they choose to go the route of what later private servers has done, then they can simply inflate the requirements by a factor of x2, or x5 or x10 or what ever suits their purpose if the goal is to pro-long it to last weeks or months.
---
Bra insj, har tenkt på det samme i det siste. 
---
Hadde vært kult og dra inn majoriteten av norske spillere til samme server.
---
this is true
---
Well he can't really callout his bosses now, can he?
---
There will be enough warriors willing to tank raids when it gets to endgame I am sure, even if guilds have to persuade 1 or 2 to switch. There won't be so many while levelling up, but druids at least are perfectly fine to tank 5 mans so it won't be an issue.
---
Whether blizzard decide to make class changes or not, I can't see them being pushed into it by a lack of warrior tanks. It's more likely to depend on whether they plan to progress servers to BC eventually or not I'd think.
---
Use rank one for nova (a little extra damage isn't worth the increased mana cost), fireball (rogue disturbing) and polymorph (it only increases duration by rank, but its mana cost as well). 
---
For arcane explosion and blizzard it is better to keep both rank one and the max one by hand. R1 explosion to pop rogues/druids out, but max rank for damage on the move. R1 blizzard to punish vanish but max rank for raid PvP, let it be BG (AV mid big fights come to mind) or just wPvP battles (where a full damage blizzard by few mages can wipe a whole raid in a narrow passage). A similar approach can be used for frostbolt: R1 for the slow and possible frostbite proc, max rank for pure damage. 
---
Anything else is better to use the max rank due to better shielding/buffing or just needing the damage from it (CoC, fireblast even scorch if ice reflector/CSed).
---
Good to know 😊
---
you use rank1 frostbolt if you want kite slow, but use max lvl frostbolt for damage, same as above I wouldnt use CoC lvl1 at all because you want damage, also we're not really using rank1 to save on mana, for instance we use r1 frostbolt because it has really quick casting time, and in terms of nova and polymorph additional levels dont change much in pvp
---
So you brought him on for your own amusement then? Knowing very well that he might want gear pieces that you wouldnt need and that you still wouldnt give them to him but instead disenchant it? Did he know that when joining?
---
Still a shitty thing to do.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=12730
---
no they can be passionate, but the suits can still decide bullshit over their heads
---
Well other than the fact I had a twink rogue and tried it extensively, and the second fact that it wasn't in the demo.
---
If it has been a full-time project for a dozen or more people on coder salaries for a couple of years that means a budget in the low seven figures at least. I don't think this is three people working for free on the weekend.
---
Not really any more than a resto shaman though, improved wf totem kind of sucks
---
The war effort is out since 2weeks on the pserver im playing on (it got blizzlike pop) and the completion is at about 25%
---
or unless the newest xpac has screwed sub numbers and negative reviews in unprecedented levels, there's massive negative outlash from the fans for the next "big" blizz game (Diablo Immortals) and pretty much on every front, Blizz is not bringing the success numbers that the Suits wanna see.... and suddenly, classic becomes a topic for the CEO/CFO, and they start to think about how to milk it for the most amount of money.
---
The dwarf /joke is also by far the best.
---
I'm just a social drinker. Every time somebody says, I'll have a drink. I say, So shall I.
---
I don't have a drinking problem. I drink, I get drunk, I fall down. No problem! 
---
The line between socials and raiders was much more blurred back in my Vanilla days. You got into the guild, took as many as we could to the raid. Rotated people a bit if they were new. Overrecruiting was a valid strategy. But I agree that 5 to 1 ratio seems a bit on the high side.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we9fqQNTNSg
---
be warned though its terribly boring after awhile
---
Lol rank 3 frostbolt. You have no idea what you are talking about. Forget everything you think you know about frost pvp and start from scratch. 
---
look at this racist smh
---
I can be okay with small QoL improvements, like advanced options, tbc style macro, tbc add-on api, tbc style ui, I'm also against vanilla macro api - too much automation you can do with them. 
---
This was exactly the response I was hoping to get thanks!
---
My staff is a good one
---
&gt; Druid tanks are cool, they can accomplish all the content just fine.
---
By "all the content" you mean 5/10 man right?
---
Warrior won't need to be prot spec to tank most of the endgame content, so no.... no love for druids and paladins.
---
I disagree on EA, some of the best pvpers in the world use gnomes for it, being able to escape a frost nova is huge considering how hard the mage vs rogue matchup is already.
---
Great post. I just hope ActiGrinch doesn't pull funding from Classic because of the horrificly low stock prices...
---
max rank CoC is way too expensive if your only goal is to slow people.
---
you should start utilizing r1 CoC.  
---
good mages do that.
---
Not enough strictly Hogger raid guilds. 
---
You sir, are an absolute asshole.
---
Why do you think he's ASKING here for feedback. It's because HE DOESN'T KNOW and wants to accumulate the knowledge from people with more experience.
---
YOU SUCK
---
I think you misspelled Pandaren
---
don't join autism guilds and you should be fine.
---
That's the route I used to go. All 3 are pretty fun and interesting. Ashenvale is one of my favourite zones. Interesting quests, looks nice, decent for pvp, and it also has an instance.
---
This is not my experience. You either joined to raid, or you joined without expecting to raid. There is a difference, even *IF* by some chance the guild happened to need a body. 
---
Overrecruiting will only result in players leaving - you will only accept so many resets without getting a spot. The players that didn't care weren't raiders anyway.
---
I think you misspelled refugees
---
And it'll go slower from here because mostly the easy to farm/hoard stuff was turned in. If it is anything like the previous server''s progression it'll likely complete at slightly more than 1% per day from here on unless they changed the auto completion rate.
---
The thing is, when rolling Priest, especially Dwarf Priest, is that you are a commodity. You can gear up faster, get into raids before you even hit 60 (Can you imagine trying to pull that off in Retail), and overall you are rewarded for your efforts more than a DPS class that is in constant competition to even get into a raid. So, you have to make a decision, are you willing to get shit on for the loot? If so, you are perfect for the position.   
---
lay on hands doesnt give you the debuff
---
No changes, means NO CHANGES!!1!1
---
On beta wow they was (on blink icon is dwarf also), but game designers tough that nobody will pick gnomes and humans so now dorfs can't be mages. 
---
I'm genuinely worried about who recommended you to use rank 3 frostbolt.
---
I remember many times getting jumped by people in STV and I would just escape by jumping in the river and swimming off in aquatic form. Pretty much nobody can get you.
---
As of late wotlk/cata i believe, it did in early wotlk for sure
---
Especially rank1 frostbolt and rank1 blizzard you will use a ton in PvP. Huge part of mage PvP is actually controlling the battlefield and not just pumping out damage and those 2 spells help a ton with CCing the enemy frontline. You probably want to use r1 blizzard more than the maxrank because you'd go oom way too fast. And r1 frostbolt is great for singletarget kiting - you should keep it up while running from a rogue or a warrior.
---
I dont agree. It has a cooldown and is one of the most useful spells for damage. I cant see a scenario where a r1 blizzard or frostbolt cant be used instead
---
September is a summer? 
---
Maybe because they aren’t truthful when it comes to a lot of the things they say. 
---
spinny pigtail female dwarf casting tho
---
10 days
---
I'm hoping that there are.going to be people like me who played vanilla back in the day but don't have time to raid these days and will be just happy to run 5/10 man's. That's my plan anyway
---
Race is mostly a flavor choice since there are no big no-brainers. Troll's racial effect is minimal since there's no endgame bow worth other than Rhok'delar (pre-raid is a xbow and the three other upgrades being hunter-valuable ranged weapons are 2 xbows (Ashjre'thul and Nerub. Slavemaker) and a gun (Larvae, still weaker than the other 2, tho). Berserk is just there for a boost, but your damage will still be average even with it. Orc is just best for PvP (the stun resist is just so great and has some PvE use as well) and tauren are just there being the unfavored ones due to their size (messing melee range and the deadzone because of it) but even warstomp and the health/nature res boosts have a niche.
---
Professions-wise I'd recommend you to just get engineering and leveling with mining to raise it. Later on it's up to you. Engineering helps greatly, since you'll be crafting your own ammo and maybe weapons early on and its gadgets are great for anything, specially PvP. Flask recipes will usually go to the guild's designed alchemist. A similar approach can be used for LW. In my case (yeah, I'll be rolling hunter as well, but we'll see whose blood gets spilled, filthy hordie ;) ) I'll scrap mining at 60 and get herbalism while keeping a bank alt with alchemy (for consumable pots like LIPs FAPs and such, flasks are secondary) and most likely ench for disenchanting stuff. 
---
MM is preferred in PvE. TSA is nice for melee group (more alliance side due to no WF though). Build-wise it's either MM/BM (20/31/00) if hit-capped or MM/Surv (2/31/18) for the 3% hit from surefooted if below cap. At very high gearing levels Surv might get better due to the +15% agi.
---
For PvP it gets trickier. a staple for full PvP builds is 21 MM due to scatter shot. The remaining points are usually used in either BM (pet res, Intimidation and frenzy to annoy casters) or Surv (deterrence, counterattack, entrapment and some crit boost).
---
Leveling, tho, there is nothing that beats a full BM, using last points in MM. It is useful until you're max level with some decent gear since pet's damage doesn't scale but with specific boosts (specific minimal set bonuses and the BM talents you already have).    
---
The most hardcore players will eat all the content you produce in one sitting then complain. That is an eternal truth of MMORPGs.
---
That doesn't mean that pandering to those players maximises revenue in the long term though. The 1% of the most keen players are only 1% of your income stream.
---
You want to spread things out so the more casual players do not feel they are falling too far behind.
---
So in other words expect some cosmetic bullshit.
---
Depends on how long the raid instance has been out for. 
---
Wow, really. I didn't imagine it would take that long. I was figuring 5 days max.
---
They'll have to change the requirements. Otherwise it's a dead event for first time players and will just segregate the population :/
---
Would be amazing if it was totally randomised. I look forward to Classic to get the Vanilla experience and that means discover and adapt like we did in the olden days :)
---
Ok so serious question then: why are you here? If you have no faith that this product is going to be something you will want, why continue to read about it and type negative comments? Do something that naked you happy instead of trying to bring everyone else down.
---
One bubble is 5% of exp for lvl
---
Your earn 1 bubble rested for each 8hrs while in rested area

Maximum is 30 rested bubbles

8*30=240 hrs=10days

If the mats are the same they might as well just scrap the event. 
---
And a 56k modem!
---
The art of the line of site pull. Waiting 2 sunders.  The skill of mouseover sunders.  All these skills have been lost.

If you're good at mage and crowd control then you could solo people who outgear you by miles. Vurtne is a great example of what a mage can do with little gear. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Nr3RpUE0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Nr3RpUE0w)
---
You’re forgetting about the quests with the shit drop rates that aren’t worth doing unless you are just farming that mob. 
---
You forgot to mention this post was made by Wildhammer Gang
---
I think that's a nice and clean UI, except maybe this Vanilla Guide thingy.
---
Superb. Thank you very much for this. It helps a lot.
---
Define Hard.  Its basically skinning if you are skinner and leatherworker.  The problem is that you are likely going to run into a literal mafia operation trying to farm it. 
---
If you don't have time to raid you definitely don't have the time to do end game PvP.
---
You seemed to have misspelled troll. But I forgive you. 
---
I think on most pservers its acutally 5 days because most of the use a TBC core and they never bothered to fix it.
---
That might be were some of my confusion is coming from when looking things up. Appreciate the heads up.
---
I'm very confused about one thing: if Classic is here to stay, then we will get to a point where Naxx will be released for, say, one year and there will be a relatively significant group of people with full Naxx gear. And these people will be dominating in PvP. There's no way to prevent this in the long run, other than to (re-)release TBC.
---
New casual players will at that point (if not sooner) feel like "falling too far behind" and every game needs a stream of new players. So it seems like putting off the inevitable.
---
Or are people really hoping that Classic will bring few years of enjoyable vanilla WoW experience and then it will be gone forever?
---
Yeah I did this in Vanilla back in the day.  That and Tyr's hand killing elites.  Or Diremaul for some variety.  Then in BC Mechanar was the rogues hangout. 
---
Mage isn't as gear dependant as warlock, but to beat geared people you will need consumables, trinkets, Skull of Impending Doom and engineering.
---
Engineering, Thistle tea, damage rotation, willingness to do the jobs that no one else wants.  And most importantly if you are class leader taking care of your stable of rogues.  And put them before yourself for guild cohesiveness.  
---
/gags loudly
---
300 DPS is what I would expect a rogue to do in MC
---
Yea, actually it will be great if they change a bunch of stuff without letting us know. Like when you buy a can of coke but it's actually pepsi. Everyone loves that. :)
---
The war effort was kind of cool originally, but nothing will recreate the same feeling. It's really just a massive farm fest with mostly vanity rewards. It was a method to help combat economic inflation and force people to recycle existing content, buying them time before they finished making the new dungeon. It was innovative, but the war effort itself is not necessarily a high point of the game for everyone.
---
It's likely that the Devilsaur mafia won't be a thing in classic so Skinning/LW will probably be fine, but also if the server population is capped in low thousands with less tryhards worrying about getting full pre-BiS then the set might not even be worth much...
---
In my experience herbalism and alchemy are the safest most consistent sources of income, and you don't have to waste gold buying consumes for raiding.
---
you watched vurtne right? your pick is a mage.
---
Not sure why you think that but okay.
---
How dare you insult the gnome master race?
---
You've got a tonne of great answers below so I'm not going to add anything, but one thing I will say is regarding keybinds. I personally use shift to bind the rank 1 of a spell, so I'll have max rank frost bolt bound to 'Q' and rank 1 frost bolt bound to 'Shift-Q'. Same for blizz, I have this bound to 'F' and rank 1 blizz to 'Shift-F', etc. Makes it easier to use in my opinion so you don't have to remember too many binds. 
---
I never begged people for gold.  Its called preparing for raid that was the whole point of the week.  Getting gold buying pots potions flasks etc.  All farming to go play end game.  Any spare time was used trying to get that elusive piece of gear from someplace in Vanilla that could improve your character.  
---
Important part was also be willing to sit and be a team player.  That was the point of a social guild.  Striving toward a goal as a group. 
---
Because you need 2 months of doing nothing else for rank 14. Not work, not sleep, not family, nothing. Raiding is 2, maybe 3 evenings a week. Not even comparable. OP said he wants to do end game PvP.
---
But sure, downvote just because you disagree. That's why the button was created.
---
I don't think he said he was going to go for r14
---
Wasn't the question though.
---
Paladins with bubble hearth are the most gank resistant. Can't kill me if I'm back in IF
---
Well he says end game PvP so...
---
As a rogue it was a favorite spot.  Pickpocketing was continuous going in circles.  if we pickpocketed everything then just kill a move or two before they respawned lock boxes etc.  
---
God your fucking obnoxious. He obviously didn't mean rank 14. Stop taking him so literally it makes you seem autistic.
---
Lvl1 could kill him more realistically 8-10 is what I would expect actually.  
---
I can see what you mean. I was just thinking he meant max lvl pvp. I guess we won't know unless he clarifys. 
---
And you are irrationality aggressive. Did someone hurt you?
---
I think it will be awesome.  I never raided seriously till the end of Vanilla only doing MC and scratching myself on BWL.   Since then did serious raiding in BC Wrath and MOP.  I can't stand the current playstyles and looking forward again to how class dynamics worked in the past.  
---
Your right. I should of said it like that. Sorry i dont speak good
---
If you cant stop moving its useful
---
I'd kinda recommend binding aoe spells to side buttons on the mouse, makes them much easier to aim and use. 
---
&gt; for instance we use r1 frostbolt because it has really quick casting time
---
GCD was 1.5 seconds, rank 1 cast time was 1.5 before talents so after it would be 1 second.
---
Rank 3 was used by most mages so you're optimising dps and gcd 
---
I'd agree. Max rank CoC did a decent amount of damage to frozen targets.
---
'Irrationality aggressive' doesn't even make sense.
---
And the hypocrisy in calling someone irrational when you assumed someone who claimed to lack the time for raiding DEFINITELY meant rank 14 by 'pvp at end game' is fucking absurd. Have some awareness.
---
Getting yelled at is par for the course in Vanilla as well as Tanking.  Difference is that you can leave and get a group in 20 seconds.  While the dumbass dps will wait 15 minutes + to find another healer or tank.
---
People who know about the GCD and the talents that reduce frostbolts cast time?
---
Why? Ally is better in pvp for most mediocre players anyway
---
I'd stack a few more fury warriors, just my opinion though.
---
Pretty common in Vanilla when you were feared.  
---
Thats fine.  As long as they don't put tokens on classic ah. 
---
It makes perfect sense. It means you are being aggressive without rationale. Which means without reason. I was not aggressive to you. I didn't call you names, You went from downvoting to calling me autistic and hypocrite in within two posts.
---
What happened here is I took OP's words in face value, while you assumed he meant "not end game" by saying "end game". It could be that OP does not know that end game PvP requires huge commitment. 
---
He didn't only say end game PvP by the way, he also said he wants to gear with PvP. Even rank 10 set requires commitment.
---
Once more, is there a reason you are being so aggressive?
---
HUMANS: Picked by people who only cares about how armor looks on your character, lore freaks.
---
DWARF: Picked by people who want to try hard PvP on Alliance, also think they are special.
---
NIGHT ELF: Picked by people who are stupid teenagers, may also be picked by old weebs.
---
GNOME: Picked by people who think a stupid looking character is funny, sometimes creepy old people play female.
---
ORC: Picked by people who want to look tough and have big shoulders, comes with hardiness so they can't help it.
---
Undead: Picked by people who want to tryhard PvP more than anyone else, many of them are trash IRL aswell.
---
Tauren: Picked by people who dont care about what race they actually play, they just wanna look big.
---
Troll: Picked by noobs most of the time, the female ones are usually really good players.
---
Nah the guy above you is right. It might've gotten changed at some point but Tyrs was always bumpin and one of the main draws was crusader. 
---
They are not that great in 1v1 situations compared to most other classes .
---
A geared Elemental is a force to be reckoned with in bgs.
---
Enh is a dead spec outside of dungeons.
---
The go to rule still applies if you dont want to be the healer dont play a hybrid .
---
I cant really see it be a scenario where I cant just use max rank. Can you explain?
---
Classic is probably the safest project at Activision, as they just hired people especially for it, the jobs on the chopping blocks will be support and Q&amp;A, not new development jobs, lol. 
---
Im neither of those things. This post was on my frontpage thats why im here.
---
True, but even those might be worth doing for a group of 5 or something if they need to stop and grind a lot anyway.
---
Something Reddit won't understand is that this is actually quite close to the hypothetical-optimal raid set up. Protection Warrior is probably the biggest miss here. In 2019, good guilds will understand that Protection Warrior is a old and dated spec which lesser guilds use as a crutch. The Prot-Fury could be a possibility, but your Bear will be this raid setups MT due to the TPS opportunity your Fury army will be pushing.
---
Never thought about that. Really good point. I will probably level with regular bags but will transition to soul bag at max
---
Yes but your R1 frostbolt snare casts in 1.0 seconds which is more beneficial.
---
good luck getting that many of your guildies to level warrior😂
---
One thing to note, in Vanilla some "stuns" were on different DRs. For example rogue's cheap shot and kidney shot were on different DRs so you could chain them together for a 10 second stun.
---
Oh, those prot Warriors are actually fury-prot tanks, i just selected prot so people understand those are tanks and the feral for crit aura and some offtanking/brez/decurse/innervate/buffs.
---
On the topic of the Scepter Questline, even after the gates are opened, you can do the questline, you just wont get any special mount at the end. However there are still some REALLY FUCKING GOOD quest rewards along the way. 
---
you're low mana and getting chased by melee, nova on cooldown
---
Unless they're part of B Team anyway...
---
This is the most honest and realistic review. 
---
Enhancement is simply not well designed for raid environment and all the stuff you can do in there other classes can do much better. 
---
Get back to me when it releases.
---
They think all the other races are crap for not having one 
---
YES!!!
---
But people love MMORPGs and as weird as this may sound, but WoW Classic is the most appealing MMORPG coming out in 2019. If you know of a better one let me know.
---
Just answer the damn question, you prick. 
---
Yeah those crowds booing the classic announcements sure were loud, oh wait
---
Lazy shitpost is lazy. Put more effort into is, you can always do better. I believe in you!
---
Problem would be gearing them all up.
---
To add to this, a Paladin with Gnomish Engineering is truely a fearsome sight and can often turn a gank around and counter gank the ganker. You can use the death ray within the safety of your bubble :)
---
Holy balls. 1 bubble for each 8hrs? That's not many bubbles for a day :(
---
This post was bought to you buy dwarf gang 
---
There is some use for an enhancement shaman using Nightfall with windfury to keep the buff up for the raid.
---
I would go for herbalism + mining, or engineer + mining if I get an alt for herbalism + alchemy. Reason is to be able to craft thorium bullets (and likely trade them for arrows) because this adds a lot to your dps and each time you raid you will need a full quiver minimum! If you raid several times a week it can quickly become a money sink!
---
Hunters are rarely top dps but bringing the best ammunitions is a must!
---
AQ/Naxx geared,  spell power/on hit reck paladins pretty much kill anything with anything with a single bomb so thats a thing.
---
Hunters shred thru anything that isnt plate or a SL lock.
---
Mages keep being mages just with more dmg.
---
Warlocks either kill you within a couple of seconds or tank 15k dmg while they wither you down.
---
Resistance gear ,totems auras anything that you can swap between to counter caster dmg is valuable.
---
In a pure non premade bg setting i would put my bet on those as most dominant
---
Loot rules for all those poor fury warriors?
---
For MC? 
---
30 Furies, 8 Shamans, 1 feral druid for Faerie Fire and aura, 1 Warlock for Curse of Recklessness. Optionally replace 1 fury with a rogue for Improved Expose Armor if we're getting more than 3600 Armor on bosses. 
---
Serve this setup cold with "muh class viability" people's tears. 
---
Personally I think Mining/Goblin Engineering would be the best for a hunter. In a party wipe a hunter can feign death and attempt to use jumper cables on a rezzer. This can save so much time from having to corpse run back, not to mention players who run back if not very good, may accidentally pull pathing mobs, which would cost even more time. This is especially true in the large dungeons. They could also become lost and you may be wasting half an hour just from a wipe. This could mean whether or not you actually clear a dungeon or raid with mob respawn. I know the jumper cables are not 100%, but it is still better than nothing. Personally I think having them is ideal for any non rezzing class that has an escape option like Vanish or Feign Death.
---
What a shitty post
---
PreBiS loot is enough to outdps any other dps until AQ
---
Pet aggroing and ninja looting
---
Remind me, you make the thorium bullets through engineering and then you can trade the bullets for thorium arrows at some vendor, is that right? It's been many years.....
---
Humans have always been the race of min maxers. You have to weigh good stats with being completely mundane.
---
Also when a male dwarf has a two handed, their left shoulder caves in through their chest when you see it from behind. I can’t unsee it.
---
Question for everyone. Is there a profession that would directly benefit a hunters pet. For example, Alchemy would enable a hunter to make a potion of petrification, making him invulnerable so the pet continues to deal damage (Although it's mega expensive. In TBC, tailoring could make a net, allowing the pet to keep attacking while the hunter gains some distance....Any other possibilities for Vanilla?
---
Thats only on private servers, in the grand scheme of things my description is more accurate
---
That’s far from true. Are we just going to ignore the massive impact that Every man for himself had in later expansions?
---
&gt; I'm very confused about one thing: if Classic is here to stay, then we will get to a point where Naxx will be released for, say, one year and there will be a relatively significant group of people with full Naxx gear. And these people will be dominating in PvP. There's no way to prevent this in the long run, other than to (re-)release TBC.
---
Sounds plausible. Although there might not be too many of them as a percentage of the population, it's hard to say. Classic might have a lot more casuals than pirate WoW.
---
&gt; New casual players will at that point (if not sooner) feel like "falling too far behind" and every game needs a stream of new players. So it seems like putting off the inevitable.
---
Putting off the inevitable is the whole point. Nobody will be playing Classic in 2100, the goal is to string out the period in which people will be playing it for as long as possible.
---
&gt; Or are people really hoping that Classic will bring few years of enjoyable vanilla WoW experience and then it will be gone forever?
---
I don't really know what you are asking. I imagine plenty of people would *like* it if Classic remained popular forever, but that doesn't mean they have to think it is *likely* it will remain popular for more than a few years.
---
But it only takes a few thousand people to make a viable server, so as long as a few thousand people stay interested it won't be "gone forever". And if not even a few thousand are interested maybe its time has passed.
---
Nothing I'd like more than to see the meta shift towards the melee-oriented game that Vanilla is. Caster's truly have very little if any spot in this games true meta :) Imagine all those 2006 Vanilla plebs crying a river over how minimally useful their Mage and Warlock class is, haha.
---
Please tell us you have screenshots of that first SM run. Also, is this where you celebrate your anniversaries, SM armoury?
---
Druid - if you just wanna get away real fast, not a lot of classes can hold you back alone. There's a reason why they are the most used flag runners in WSG.   
---
If you wanna be real annoying to wear them down with slow ticking dots while running away from them ;) 
---
Stealth and infinite amounts of CC.
---
A band is obviously more of a commitment than a video game dude lol. It's not a comparison. You can't teach a bandmate a song in 5 minutes, but you can teach someone a game mechanic or an entire boss fight in less than 5. 
---
I get it but that’s a really unreliable cc plus druids can trinket fear.  
---
But that is always the case. The artist wants his vision completely realized while the company has shareholders expecting financial results.
---
Why did Hots run into issues ? It made no money. Is that a problem with Classic WoW ? No, and to imply so is incredibly jaded. 
---
Actually, going by your example, we should all be hopeful. They supported the Hots team even while the game made little to no money. They pulled the plug at some point, but it's not like they never let it grow and develop in the first place.
---
I think I'm starting to get it. I just found it confusing that after more than 10 years of pservers people still think that Classic will be uninteresting 3-4 years after being relased.
---
Old School RuneScape was released in Feb 2013 and it's still very popular.
---
I'm only talking about vanilla you blockhead. In case you hadn't noticed, this is the WoW Classic Reddit!
---
Where is that from hahaha
---
Reliable? Yea, damage breaks it, but if you're out in the open, no one will be damaging them and you only need a few seconds to mount.
---
Like I said earlier, trinket does pop it but druids don't have much burst damage, with a prot warrior you can do out last them since shout only has a 90 second cool down.
---
It was a joke trolls said in Classic WoW if you typed /silly. It was removed though due to the original being a reference to weed.
---
Exactly, iirc there is one tauren in Orgrimmar and one dwarf in Iron Forge that trade the thorium arrows.
---
Edit: https://classicdb.ch/?item=18042
---
Haha nice! That's basically what my route was, I'd come in through Grom'grol and head north to nesingwary, and just head back and forth until I saw someone being violated against their will, or someone asked in local chat for help.
---
It was always fun when the corpse camper would play victim and get some 60's over to help him, and it would snowball into a 60 dominated hot spot for pvp over a few hours lol
---
The thing is, it’s not some ancient art lost to history like the collected knowledge of the library at Alexandria or Greek Fire... Yes, people will be rusty or will need to learn how to play their class properly, but people will learn... The process, just like in 2004, will weed out the pros from the posers and we will have top tier Prot tanks, and everyone else...
---
It's a bit difficult to compare to vanilla or private servers.
---
Vanilla: ppl did not stockpile in advance since they did not know what would be needed.
---
Pservers: there is only 1 server people play active on at a time making a race server wise pointless.
---
I think its completely up to the realm itself. If you end up on the same realm as several world first pushing guilds, the gates open day 1.
---
But if you are on a low pop or none pushing realm, the gate will open on auto like in vanilla
---
No matter how great this setup in theory is, it will take forever to gear.
---
&gt;  You can't teach a bandmate a song in 5 minutes
---
That made it bleedingly obvious you dont know much about music, or only played the simplest pop or punk. There's a lost more going on than just the chord progression.
---
And im talking about just playing for an evening, not preparing for a 6 month tour. In either case, you come prepared.
---
Translation: I love loot trading and you will too. 
---
I wonder if they'd be willing to bring it back seeing how weed use is becoming more socially acceptable (at least, in the US). 
---
I like how all the references to booze and the fact your character can get drunk is perfectly ok though (alcohol is legal in the west, so I get it, but still). 
---
Makes a huge difference if you can only play on the weekends... at the higher levels.  At lower level rested xp goes fast.
---
No I don't know a thing about music lol, we're in the classic wow subreddit, lets talk about this please lol. 
---
I don't care how easy or hard playing music is. It's still a very different scenario. If you say it's an activity that you must come prepared to I believe you, but I'm telling you, a damn video game is not one of those things.
---
I care
---
If you are kiting rank 1 is still better for the faster cast time.  Faster cast time, the sooner they are snared, the sooner you can move again.  You will be moving on the left over gcd so it doesn't matter.  For damage you obviously don't need rank 1.
---
I did a little looking into this recently as well as I really enjoyed twinking in TBC and I plan to twink again in classic.
---
What I learned is that in lvl19 bracket hunter really excels. They have excellent kite ability, do fantastic damage, have a tonne of really great gear, they scale well at that level, and the regular hunter stuff like spell knock-back and such.  Plus depending on how they do it there are some op pets that you can get. I think that warlock are a close second in this bracket due to the general strong nature of the class being very mobile and able to do a lot of sustained damage, plus survivability and fear. Expect to see a load of hunters in the lvl19 twink bracket! There might be argument to go as a natural hunter-counter class as I'd expect a good 50% or more of the twinks to be hunters at 19, so you can exploit their weaknesses. 
---
Those types of things bother me a ton too. Also happy cake day!
---
lol sorry care bot. 
---
I read somewhere that only certain abilities share the DR. For example, Cheap Shot and Kidney shot do not share a DR, so if I open with kidney shot, wait for it to wear off, vanish, then cheap shot will have its full duration. 
---
I'm bringing this up because, if that's correct, I'm trying to figure out why Charge would mess up a rogues DR, do they share the same DR cooldown? 
---
You're still here making invalid points?
---
There are the remains of orc catapults in Elwynn Forest, left over from either the First War or the Second War, can’t remember.
---
So dope.
---
Blizzard would, Activision would not.
---
With Morhaime out of the picture, I'm not sure that Blizzard would anymore - a lot of Blizzard people from 15-20 years ago aren't there anymore.
---
Imagine doing a quest where you need 20 of a quest item drop.  They drop on average 10% of the time and only one person in the party gets the drop.  That is going to take so long to do with 5 people even if you can kill every spawn of the mob as it comes up.  You're looking at an average of over 1000 mob kills to get everyone done.  These types of quests are effective to do solo because you are getting plenty of xp for just killing the mobs.
---
Not even close to being true. 
---
Wow classic is a different project. Its dedicated to classic fans. Less work to develop for alot of players thry could potentially catch. They could also use this for an indicator of what people expect from retail. 
---
Whoever is complaining about having ruined their on exitement for classic because playing private servers for forever should serviously shut their fucking mouth. Its your own fault ruining your exitement.
---
It all depends on what your goals are.  I like being able to make equipment for myself as I level up, but with something like engineering, you're going to be heavily reliant on the AH at first since you won't have any alts to feed you mats.  And any rare/uncommon items on there are going to be very expensive.  If all you're concerned about is farming for max level, herb/mining might be best, and even if you can't track both, you can always switch back and forth to see where the nodes are.
---
I of the opinion that things that were bugs in vanilla should not be restored in classic. 
---
I can help but wonder if this kind of player will actually enjoy classic. I just don't see it happening, hmmm.
---
It takes two weeks for a server to have enough 60s to clear MC. Those players are all quite good and dedicated and have done the content a million times, so it’s trivial for them to clear MC in leveling blues and greens.
---
What was wrong with the demo?
---
Probably more like 10-14.
---
7 days would be amazingly fast.
---
for horde mages/priests its 19. no other class can compete with gravestone scepter.
---
But youre missing my entire point. The point is that if you are going to do a group activity, especially with people you dont know, you come prepared. Its just good practice. 
---
Rank 1 the slow is 5 seconds, rank 2/3 it's 6 seconds. 
---
Had a 29 fire mage and loved it
---
Only a tiny minority will stockpile mats, and the war effort requires tens of thousands of each resource. The effect will be negligable. 
---
To what extent of unpreparedness is unacceptable to you? Not knowing how to kill the bosses in WC? Not having keybinds mastered and optimized? Not remembering to bring food/water? 
---
I mean to me those are all such minuscule things that nobody should ever care about in a casual 5 man dungeon setting.
---
and 10kbs download time!
---
The game has been out for 15 years. 
---
If Blizzard can't staff GM's to deal with loot issues, then maybe you're right the next best solution is to just to not intervene in loot issues.
---
Putting the Wotlk/Cata system in Classic will suck. It was abused a lot by guilds/groups of 2-3 friends running dungeons, and it will make Classic dungeon runs crap.
---
39 hpalas are immortal in wotlk
---
Miming and juggeling
---
Can you just buy the arrows or do they have to be traded?
---
Wc is essentially a tutorial dungeon and really doesnt require any knowledge. But for example knowing of Ghaz'Rillas repeating knockback and knowing how to mitigate it with proper positioning is the level i'd expect. 
---
Engineering + herbalism/enchanting 
---
They have good intentions, but the loot system they chose is NOT the answer.
---
No one should ever be able to trade soulbound loot. 
---
Master looters and players have to click twice to fuck up a loot roll. Just be more careful
---
#make soulbound loot soulbound again
---
nah, we developers hate our job man, we literally never work on anything we like. If i go to my manager and say, yo, i wanna do that stuff cause i think I would enjoy it (and it would also be profitable to the company), he tells me I am grounded and I can only write documentation for 3 months, because this is a workplace and my fun is not important.
---
.^^^/s^if it wasn't obvious
---
Imagine going out of your way to complain about a hyped game on its own subreddit.
---
Too hard to say since there are several classes that hit like tanks, overall I would go with hunters in every bracket honestly. Hunters with full twink gear and engineering are just too strong.
---
The only sad thing about being a druid is not being a troll. But it's easily worth being any race just to be druid.
---
Right. Thank you. How long does it take to explain the knockback effect? Are you really going to freak out on me if I show up to the fight and I say I'm not aware of any of Ghaz'Rillas mechanics?
---
Hopefully you're a reasonable person and will say "No problem, it's really easy, Ghaz'Rilla will occassionally do a big knockback, so be sure to have your back facing a wall or safe area at all times"
---
yes. I think it was 4 levels. All 5 mans are fine with paladin/druid...raids...are a little different as both need more hps/better gear than a prot warrior.
---
Or log in to an already established private server and pretend it’s the final product, then this will break the internet 
---
Retail tanking is way harder in anything other than trivial content. Problem is bads who can't do any relevant content think they know fuck all about it.
---
Wotlk/cata system was the worst. I readily admit my friends and I abused it all the time to share loot and players in our lfg had no clue we were even friends. Gonna suck if they put it in Classic
---
Exactly. But people are really obsessed with hating Activision and will never be swayed that Blizzard is anything but a shell of itself.
---
It's not even just the Classic WoW sub, it's the regular WoW sub too. Reddit is honestly kind of a bad community of WoW players.
---
This type of raid make up is for the speedrunners and autist, which does have quite the community at least in the pservers.
---
It's a pretty minor concept from Diablo. Literally just the reset mechanic to increase re-playability, while not getting rid of your progress on your established toons/servers. My example doesn't really contain any changes to the game itself. Yours does.
---
The last 2 pservers I was on both had a druid as first class to 60. If done right they are super fast.
---
Yes for rogue they share different DRs for some reason which is why they were so powerful in vanilla, but most categories of spell share a DR - for example frost nova and entangling roots. There's roots, incapacitates, stuns, disorients, and silence.
---
I've definitely charged/intercepted at a target being attacked by a rogue to get 'immune' so yeah. Private servers aren't perfect tho.
---
Used to have fun with dual wield enh shaman at 49.
---
If it's the difference between getting hamstrung or otherwise snared yourself it's well worth the 1 second.
---
Discursive will be banned by the new API and ToS as it would could as automation i.e botting. 
---
We do know. It was tried and tested by numerous people during the open week.
---
Use trusted enchanters from reputable guilds ( quick whisper to guild officer about their members scamming enchanting mats will probably result in swift kick )
---
Use guild enchanter ( any raiding guild should have one at max skill level for the BoP recipes )
---
Once a person scammed me out of my mats in entirety of classic (player since release). Even though Blizzard's policy at the time stated clearly that they will not revert any trades between players, I made a ticket straight away, explained in painstaking detail: my character name, their character name, time of trade, down to the minute, content of trade, purpose etc. I just wanted them to get in trouble but next day I was greeted with my Large Brilliant Shards in the mailbox, courtesy of GM! 
---
lol you are dead way before 90 seconds my dude.  That's why it's unreliable if you are trying to get away.  It can be trinketed, resisted, broken on random damage, and then you aren't running away.  Prot warriors can't out last them any longer than a regular warrior can they are toast.
---
What's the Pre-BIS you have in mind? Does it include things like Lionheart Helm (supposedly not released until 1.7) and CloudKeepers/Titantic Leggings (not released until 1.10)? Is this in regards to 1.10 loot changes? Savage Gladiator Chain use to give +13 DEF between patch 1.7 - 1.10.   
---
I'm just curious about this, because I see a lot of people claiming what BIS on release are, but I'm not sure if the dungeon loot changes will take place on release of classic, or if they'll be gated like they were originally.  
---
I would genuinely like to see some data on this
---
I used to wreck people with lvl 39 arms warrior
---
Be aware sit/crit won't work in Classic. Private server bug. 
---
Yeah, in BC, dual mangoose shaman 49 were insane.
---
All it would take is an option to enable Greed and Master Loot items to have that timer trade option.
---
Improved Expose would overwrite Sunder Armor 
---
[http://elitistjerks.com/f47/t24301-rogue\_pve\_dps/#Raid-wide\_Buffs\_and\_Boss\_Debuffs](http://elitistjerks.com/f47/t24301-rogue_pve_dps/#Raid-wide_Buffs_and_Boss_Debuffs)
---
"Note that a 5-CP Expose Armor with 2 points in Improved Expose Armor is worth slightly more armor reduction than Sunder Armor (3075 vs. 2600). If your tank is a protection warrior, then Expose Armor will overwrite and prevent the use of Sunder Armor, reducing the warrior's initial threat from Devastating up to a full stack of Sunder Armor, as well as his threat on subsequent Devastates with 5 Sunders."
---
[http://www.wowwiki.com/Sunder\_Armor](http://www.wowwiki.com/Sunder_Armor)
---
"Sunder armor does not stack with the rogue ability, Expose Armor. Since their armor reduction effect is higher, Sunder Armor will not be usable while Expose Armor is on the target, making protection Warriors unable to build threat from sundering. So, be sure to let rogues in your group know not to use Expose Armor."
---
The idea is that engineers craft the premium ammo, which are bullets.  If you’re using the other kind of ranged weapon, bow, then you swap out the bullets for arrows. Hence the trade mechanic. 
---
Gnomish or goblin engineering for hunter?
---
For me if i have to chose only one (in classic):  
---
10-19: **Hunter** (the pet can solo a non-twink).  
---
20-29: **Hunter** (running aspect + pet)  
---
30-39: **Druid** (travel form)  
---
40-49: **Warrior** (with a healbot: feel like a r14 running on a fresh 60 battleground)  
---
Classic loot system was perfectly fine. I never met a single person that ticketted support with loot issues. 
---
They say this is a passion project, but they seriously couldn’t come up with a better solution than parachuting wotlk/cata Loot System into Classic??
---
They got one shot. If they fuck this up everyone will revert to private servers.
---
Not sure why you'd bring autists into the game and associating them badly but there's naturally an audience for about everything you can do in game. And Speedruns certainly are a great thing to try once. But running this stuff every raid night - i simply couldn't imagine this being too much fun...
---
It's unfortunate that mages get Blink and Evocation at lvl 20, which makes them not so good candidates for lvl 19 twinks.
---
Dwarf pally until the day I die 
---
If they fuck up my baby imma be pissed
---
They are just using it as an example issue, basically for optics.
---
They simply do not want to have in game supports at all because they are cutting cost like crazy.
---
The Blizzard you knew and loved is no more. Sadly, i bet some people here are still dumb Blizzard fanboys with no objective thinking. (Truth)
---
Classic is pretty much their only chance to get back old fans.
---
Blizzard will no longer intervene in loot issues != keep classic system
---
But some asshole ninja-looting that drop you needed is part of the Classic experience. (kidding, kinda)

They never said we're getting wotlk/cata loot system.  We're getting the loot system from the legion patch they borrowed the client from.  They specifically said that they are just going to leave the loot system in place that was already in the client instead of changing it for something worse.  That loot system would not let you trade pieces that you hit need on.
---
&gt; Right. Thank you. How long does it take to explain the knockback effect? Are you really going to freak out on me if I show up to the fight and I say I'm not aware of any of Ghaz'rillas mechanics?
---
About a minute. But doing it every single time is tiring. And some people simply refuse to listen and stand in the open, which leads to the group wiping and eventually fall apart.
---
Side-question: what ranks do you use while leveling? Always the max (except Frost Nova, using the lowest rank)?
---
Way better than Dwarves I'll tell you that much.
---
False it's gear&gt;=build&gt;=skill if you don't have the gear it doesn't take skill for you to get one shot, you have to be somewhat skillful to have a good build, but at the end of the day gear means you hit harder. People didn't enjoy pvp because it was balanced they enjoyed it because they felt progression and could one shot lowbies/in gear and levels.
---
I am almost 100% positive that 3 days logged out in rested XP = 1.5 levels of rested XP aka the max. Based on original Vanilla server rest time, not on private server rest time.
---
I'll try to find a source for this later, but I am very confident this is correct.
---
I *only* play Protection Warrior. And usually as an off-race, such as Gnome or Troll. And I'll primarily do nothing but PvP. Tanking instances is just a tool to get better for tanking battlegrounds.
---
I fucking love protection spec in mass fights. There is nothing more annoying in a huge scrimmage than having a warrior in your face shield bashing the fuck out of your abilities. 
---
People simply will not target you until you're the last man standing, and you'll have free reign to cause utter havoc. If they *do* target you, then you're doing your job, and tanking in PvP.
---
We might find out quite a bit from the earnings call today.  I think Tips Out is live streaming it. I dont recomend watching that but a summary afterward she give some hints and give lots of content creators clickbait for a while.
---
&gt; Tanks level, get geared, and stop doing certain content. Once a tank gets 'x' loot from 'y' dungeon - they probably don't want to run it anymore
---
Strat Live runs for Orbs are done constantly, even by Thunderfury tanks.
---
The issue here is the made-up-statistic of .1% of players having loot issues.
---
You minimized the issue and thus the joke stands, but in reality it's clearly a far higher % of the player base to motivate blizzard to take action in the first place.
---
**For Discussion**
---
What would be wrong with a system where you can only loot trade items *won by a greed role*? Items won by Need roles are unable to be traded.
---
This means people who will use (or at least agree to keep...) loot will role need and beat out those rolling Greed in hopes to trade to a friend.
---
It also means in groups when loot drops, you can all blindly roll Greed so it doesn't hit the ground and if no one needed, you can trade it to someone who may want it for another reason.
---
Thoughts?
---
But you can... only people with similar T1 or T2 will be able to beat you with skill fresh/dungeon players will still get annihilated 
---
Im just talkin about a rogue v rogue and you got opened with all cds avaiable, if a rogue can survive the intial combo, the enemy is forced to bleed/blind the other guy, both easy for dwarf :D  
---
Simple answer is to crowdsource trusted player gms who are voted on by the community. Designated volunteers who work short shifts to better the community and in return get free subs for life for their efforts so long as they remain in good standing. 
---
Source? I'd like to read up.
---
Ah I don't know what else to add if interacting with people for 1 min tires you out. I find it fun and rewarding to help people out. If people refuse to listen as you say, that's a whole different case from what I'm talking about. 
---
I'm talking about people who just want to jump in the game and play it and learn as they go. Not this weird person who jumps in a 5 man dungeon and trolls people...
---
But I mean, there are classes that can  kite you to death in vanilla. If you don't have the skill to know when to blind a mage or use the right poisons for certain situations, you're going to die to a mage slowly, but surely.   
---
I personally wouldn't say that Gear is the greatest dependency on your ability to pvp effectively, but I can agree that  gear is equally as important as build. One isn't as effective without the other, and neither of them are effective without the skill to use and know your abilities; Skill &gt; Gear &gt;=Build.
---
wow classic panel at blizzcon 'difficult decisions' slide.
---
maybe in TBC but in classic this is no issue. you can use sunder. there will be no debuff on the target but you get the threat from sunder armor. Btw devastate is a tbc talent and will not be implemented in classic.
---
If you plan to be a solo player in classic you're doing vanilla wrong. Really not hard to make some friends/ join even a casual levelling guild... 
---
tell that to blue warlock with soul link... he can even go naked and will woop your ass
---
The way they describe it in their blog post is identical to the wotlk/cata system, including the ability to trade Needed items. That’s kind of the whole point to it.
---
Any system that allows trading of BoPs to group members you ran the dungeon with can and will be abused in Classic.
---
&gt;If Blizzard ~~can't~~ **won't** staff GM's to deal with loot issues,
---
FTFY. 
---
On a more serious note, Blizzard has the means (money and other resources) to staff the appropriate amount of GM's needed for various issues, they just don't because they'd rather save money cutting corners than providing their customers with a more quality experience. 
---
Share holders &gt; us, never forget that.  
---
Make it soulbound if you equip it. Dude rolls need on an item, let him equip it to show he's not giving it to his friend, if he refuses we can call him out as a ninja. 
---
Except with their new system, ninjas have bigger incentives to ninja
---
Before they just got vendor gold for the item
---
Now they can ninja and attempt to sell it to you. Potentially wayyy more money than vendor loot
---
WotLK/Cata was were everyone could roll need and trade for 2 hours afterwards right? This system is so bad I can't believe they put this in.
---
No matter what they can’t keep the old system because they’ve straight up said they can’t afford the GMs / support staff
---
lionheart should be available at launch, titanic not. No other spec can compete with fury dps when worldbuffs are running. So the slight differences from itemization wont be a big deal when comparing class performance.
---
"can't afford"
---
They can afford it, but classic is just a cash grab to get people to purchase game time, and that is all it will ever be.
---
39 pally with SoC and Pendulum of Doom was the most fun I ever had in WoW. 
---
What good is a cool down if I cant use it every fight? 
---
My twink 49 shaman absolutely dumpstered everyone with one shot windfury's. 
---
I really don't believe another class has the burst of that shaman in any other bracket lol. 
---
Honestly just go with a big name guild/player if you are worried about it. That guy who has been standing on the mailbox /yelling all enchants your mats + tip for three weeks every day and is in a top 5 guild is 99% unlikely to scam you, if he was a scammer you would have heard about it in chat by now. His rep is worth more than any enchant.
---
Source?  The only information I've seen regarding it is that it was the same loot system they took from the borrowed client.  
---
The blog post says 
---
&gt; In the past, if someone accidentally looted something they didn’t mean to in a group, players would have to contact customer support to trade it. In the modern system, players are given a period of time in which they can still exchange loot with others. This is a convenience we felt was worth retaining for Classic rather than making people go through customer support.   
---
Which doesn't contradict what I'm saying (that is borrowed from "The modern system")
---
Don't be kidding. This is a very real fact and it is a part of Classic whether it be good or bad.
---
True. Keeping the treatment of Needed items the same as actual Classic is the biggest issue. Shouldn’t allow that stuff to be traded 
---
This right here is the right answer. Fuck Activision-Blizzard. If they end up screwing up a game they have already released 15 years ago, I'm just going to be done with them. 
---
Handholding is one of the things that made the game worse. I would also prefer a "deal with it" answer. They try to solve problems that are none. 
---
&gt; Dude rolls need on an item, let him equip it to show he's not giving it to his friend
---
In my example, rolling Need on something *does* make it soulbound as I stated it could not be traded from there.
---
&gt; let him equip it to show he's not giving it to his friend, if he refuses we can call him out as a ninja. 
---
That's how vanilla worked and people dont care about being called out as a ninja lol. It's rose tinted glasses at best to pretend there was some kind of social mob justice dealt to those people.
---
In fact, being realistic, your solution is ignoring what led Blizzard to implementing a trading system in the first place, it simply led to an overwhelming of customer support tickets
---
So if we want to be mature about this, we have to address what happened in the past, why, and how to prevent us from repeating history.
---
I'm not? Are you new to this type of meta scene? Lol
---
yeah it was like 13% complete after the first day... so only about 12% since then.  The (alliance) guild i am in did complete farming the 42,000 fragments by the next reset after the quest was released though!
---
You don't rest outside of an inn (or anything that counts as a rest area).
---
Still wouldn't matter since Bear threat is greater than even DW Reck Sit Fury threat.
---
“In the modern system” is talking about what they’re putting in Classic. Not the current retail system.
---
Mage is better without gear. Lock is better with R14 gear. 
---
But remember that would mean the mage needs to be playing perfectly if the guy outgearing the mage tenfold just happens to hit the mage due to a misplay it's dead just because he wouldn't have the hp to survive it kinda thing. But yah skill&gt;everything else, but not when the othet player isn't a total retard and to have gear like that I feel they will somewhat need a brain.
---
I don’t know about a guide. But there are questing addons that pretty much show every quest in the game on your map. 
---
Ah the classic/tbc balance
---
I keep hearing the phrase "passion project" from these speakers. Yet JAB said in that bord of directors conference that "highly anticipated classic" is coming when they talked about revenue streams. Do they know what thy want this game to be? 
---
I always played with two buddies. We were clothies. We would ALWAYS dequip better items and Need everything to share between ourselves, even to just fucking vendor the stuff.
---
People we played with had no clue.
---
It was a dick move, I know. But the system should *never* incentive dick moves like that. Classic system was perfect
---
PvP flags don't fall off instantly upon entering Alliance territory.
---
&gt; If they end up screwing up a game they have already released 15 years ago, I'm just going to be done with them.
---
I think that with Classic they are taking the time and do have the right people on it to make it a successful game, I'm thinking of it more from an after launch stand point. I.e., the possibility of abuse via the right click report, various loot issues (to be frank I was never in situation personally or in a guild where loot was given to a wrong person and had to have a GM correct it, I'm not saying it didn't happen but as someone who never experienced it I can't say 100% that it did either) and even bugs or other coding issues, it makes me a bit nervous about post launch. 
---
I'm being optimistic though. One of the things I've always sad about Vanilla is that it attracts a different type of gamer than any other game, the expansions included, so I hope that the community is going to be able to, for the most part, self regulate, but we'll see. 
---
I absolutely cannot wait for the "you need? Can I have?" whispers spam from retail kids every time I win an item.
---
Back to the auction house?  What's your new sequence of events?
---
I guess you're right. If IB and grenade on CD aswell then it might be useful. I give you that
---
Different people enjoy different playstyles.
---
That's no justification to include a flawed system that can be abused by groups, at the expense of your average solo leveller.
---
Fact 1:  They borrowed the legion client.
---
Fact 2:  They said they didn't want to remove systems from the borrowed client if they thought it would improve the experience anyways.  
---
Fact 3:  The legion system is more modern than wotlk/cata.  
---
Question:  Why would they change the loot system from the more modern system to an earlier version (extra work) when they said they didn't want to change it because it was wasted effort for something that wasn't beneficial and then call it modern?  
---
Question:  Why would you assume that they would make extra work for themselves to change the system from the client they borrowed when the legion system is literally already in place in the client?
---
What the hell is the point in saying “maximize fury warriors”.
---
This is very theoretical for at least two reasons.
---
1) In the long run your raid will underperform due to undergearing. At some point, other classes in full MC/BWL epics will outperform furry warriors in devilsaur and blues. You have now wasted that opportunity by d/e’ing lots of lots of perfectly good rogue/caster loot.
---
2) the sheer impractibility of getting so many warriors in, and telling them sorry no loot, is pretty huge IMO. I don’t see why anyone would be interested in doing this at all. 
---
Yup - Hunters are the best. Rogues are common too, BUT... rogues do not get crippling poison the 20s, so they have no slows in the 19 bracket.
---
IIRC the 49 bracket warriors are killers because they can use the super slow epic Kang the Decapitator and get their 31 pt talents in mortal strike etc
---
While this is true, they just had their asses destroyed in the last few months. ATVI stock price at a multiple year low, Blizzard just had layoffs. 
---
I realize they need to cost cut, but they should do it in a way that doesn't introduce a shit system into Classic. 
---
Then you are thinking wrong.  Thunderfury is bis
---
Safe assumption.  Leading the raid and has a binding.
---
If the RL is a hunter with a binding then you need to GTFO of the guild

---
Described exactly as the wotlk/cata system worked. A terrible system abused by groups. Blizz OK with this because it saves them a few bucks on support staff.
---
The answer is yes. 
---
Its not that they cant staff GM/CSR staff. its that they are THE most expensive part of running an MMO. The goal is to maximize these peoples time. More systems more automated stuff less time things that need to be addressed by less people.
---
With less people playing wow and losing money they are the first groups of people to be cut. Because lol Customer service.
---
In addition to Cheap Shot and Pounce being their own DR category with only those two in it, Chance on Hit stuns like the Mace Specialization talents were also in their own separate DR category.
---
I've done it many a time in vanilla. You need to git gud
---
Is 19 mage best going wand spec over full frost?
---
Lol, no one is getting the legion system dude. It runs on personal loot.
---
Name a server that has had a populated server for 10 years though, people love the "fresh" servers so really trying to guess about 10 years or even 5 is pure conjecture because to my knowledge we haven't had any one server that has survived that long for whatever reason.
---
No, it's 10 days as others have written here.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rest
---
that's how retail works now  
---
Fine, EU servers can have it at launch, that's it.
---
Not the non legion instances.  Run ZF in legion and see how the loot worked.
---
Depends if he was made aware of it before hand.  If someone explicitly said "hey you wanna come see MC but you wont be eligible for any drops that cool?" and he said yes ....
---
Is it possible to get the mount if you are not backup-supported by your guild fully?
---
It's possible i'm just slow at druids, but i just kill so much faster as a mage that the drinking is worth it to me. Plus, i can alt-tab or talk in guild chat while I'm drinking, so it's never wasted time :)
---
If you don't care about the guild and just want items you shouldn't have then a dkp system is good for you.  It's terrible for the guild as a whole but any guild with a system like that is doomed for failure 
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Vanilla was incredibly solo-unfriendly.
---
It's really hard to remember details but it would play 90s and 2000s alternative music. Once or so a day would be a "news" segment. We talked about what's happening on the server, the economy, etc. I dont know if this was done for every server or just mine (Blackwing I think).
---
you can cherry pick examples all you want.
---
At the end of the day, new system gives an additional incentive to ninja: can blackmail sell the item to players.
---
*No matter what*, new system gives more incentives to ninja's than old system, that's bad. 
---
And that doesn't even include all the group/guild issues that fuck over solo players 
---
Theyre great at being worse than trolls.
---
People saying that servers will complete the war effort on the first day are delirious... The only things that will MAYBE be complete on the first day are runecloth bandages, thorium bars, and rugged leather.  These are the things that max level player will have been stockpiling while waiting for the war effort to start.
---
Let's look at some of the other requirements:
---
600,000 Silk Bandages = 30,000 STACKS = Bag/Bank Slots!
---
800,000 Linen Bandages = 40,000 STACKS = Bag/Bank Slots!
---
250,000 Mageweave Bandages = 12,500 STACKS = Bag/Bank Slots!
---
250,000 Silk Bandages = 12,500 STACKS = Bag/Bank Slots!
---
So looking at just the CLOTH requirements, and disregarding runecloth (which is another 800,000 fyi), you have approximately 95,000 stacks of cloth to "stock pile and store in your bags".  Good luck with that.  I'm sure everyone is going to make 5-6 bank alts with full bank bag slots, and all 14-16 slot bags, just to store all their cloth for the war effort.  Not to mention most people are going to be using the majority of their cloth for first aid/crafting while they level.  
---
Idk about you guys, but when I level, I use most of the cloth I loot to level first aid, and make bandages for myself.  I didn't have thousands of extras that I just vendored or sold on the AH.  The same concepts will apply to pretty much all of the materials required for the war effort.
---
Incorrect.  You do get rested exp outside of a rested area just less.
---
&gt; new system gives an additional incentive to ninja: can blackmail sell the item to players.
---
Are you just not reading??
---
**That player who got ninja'd in your example, could roll Need in mine and NOT be blackmailed. It would work exactly as it does now in Vanilla if everyone rolled need**
---
Please digest that and try again.
---
Solution = don't wipe
---
Majority of a raiders time is farming raid content.  The wbuffs make the raids much quicker 
---
But better than Dwarves
---
That is literally the premise of world pvp.
---
Then you were fighting bad druids very bad druids.   I think they need to get good.  If I’m the Druid no warrior is running away from me 1v1.  It’s common sense. 
---
Their entire fucking job is to do work to recreate the old system.
---
Did you even read the blog post? 
---
Everything from rogues to hunters had to be redone to match vanilla
---
And you’re trying to say loot is the ONE area they shouldn’t have to modify 
---
That system would be fine.
---
It’s trading on Need rolls that everyone is concerned with
---
They look very silly with their hunched backs but the racial is OP tho.
---
NO.  I'm not saying that.  Where did I say that.
---
That's what Blizzard has said.  I haven't said anything.  I'm just pointing out to everyone they may have a misconception about what they are reading.
---
What i dont get in my mind how everyone wants to stockpile hundred thousands of mats?
---
Classic will not be private servers where everyone can create infinite amount of accounts and toons.
---
Your suggestion seems the most viable option, IMO, and I don't see the merits of a 'need to equip' system at all.
---
If you need, and it binds immediately, it's a done deal.  For better or worse, if it was a ninja, the deal is done, but at least it's -that person- who is the ninja, and it's not a question of 'giving it to their friends.'
---
If it's a greed roll, and it turns out it gets traded to someone else -- who cares?  Unless there's some lock on who can roll need (which, IMO, I don't really think there should be, personally -- this is vanilla, where hybrids of any armor class roll on cloth), if you needed it, and let the RNG Gods decide your fate against any other rollers, As It Is Written.
---
The sole 'problem' that might need further discussion I can see here is the question of 'who can roll on loot.'  Sure, hybrids wear cloth.  Can cloth roll on plate, then?  Being a plate wearer lets you potentially roll need on any piece of gear, then, potentially denying someone else the gear they wanted.  Would that be a scummy thing to do?  Sure.  Has that ever stopped people before?  I don't see any reason someone couldn't roll a hate-need on the last boss of a dungeon, because they didn't get some piece of gear they really wanted earlier or maybe that's just the kind of person they are, but no system is perfect.  So, what then?
---
I like druid T2, T3 and the dungeon set.
---
Git gud
---
Correct no R14 for me just end game at 60 for PVP.
---
100% agree.
---
If shit is Needed and soulbound, it should stay on whoever gets it, even if you’re sloppy and accidentally master it to someone else.
---
Handholding is everywhere in MMOs these days. It’s boring and not needed in a 15 year old game 
---
I'm not a retail kid but hell I may do that if it's something I really want.
---
Loch Modan, Wetlands, Stranglethorn, Tanaris. I can’t wait to visit these places again! Hurry up Classic!
---
This will be ESPECIALLY bad in vanilla where finding a group to even do an instance is much harder, thus RAISING the incentive to do stuff like this since you might literally be farming the dalrends set for months. I would do the same for my friends too, bring my main warrior but wear lesser weapons and pretend like I am going for dalrends too. I have helped countless people grind those weapons and that will 100% be abused if they use this Loot Trading nonsense lol. Its already being abused via master loot switching and kicking ppl and stuff like that even WIHTOUT the loot trading! A blizzard-endorsed legal way to troll will be so bad lol. The only reason I can think they want to do it is that it will be less work for developers or something like that they arent being upfront about.
---
Gravestone scepter does as much dps than a 30 spell so you might want to support that. It´s almost a cheat item for 10 levels. And then it is still good for another 10. 
---
Meh, I played solo all through vanilla because that's just how I prefer to play, and I still had a lot of fun. Didn't even bother with a guild until I was capped and ready to start gearing.
---
Quit thinking you’re fighting good players when you’re fighting keyboard turners.  
---
He fails to realize that we won't all end up on the same server.  if we only make up a small fraction of the server our knowledge with spread like a virus.
---
We had a situation in my guild where one of our members would buy items from other players that they acquired through the EPGP system. Trinket dropped, mage got it because he had highest priority, boomkin bought it for 25k. Officers just said that it was up to each individual whether they wanted to sell their items or not.
---
Stupid as fuck.
---
I would love to watch that raid do c'thun, please stream!
---
the raid will have a bunch of sub 60s in it (you dont need to be 60 to get into MC)
---
some guild will do it within a couple weeks of the server opening.  much of the raid will have 58-59 and wearing greens.  MC is very easy if you know what to do
---
See you in the arenas kiddo
---
LW is a money pit, and pointless on a hunter. It will get you very minimal gear while leveling, and at max it's literally just to get devilsaur+cured rugged, which is pretty minimal passive income. It's a nice pickup on alts, since it's free money every few days, but on a main it's a little pointless IMO.
---
You're a hunter though. Engineering should 100% be one of your profs, regardless of whether your'e doing PvP or PvE. Arconite dragonling, battle chickens, and ammo are great for raids, while jumper cables and repair bots will help keep your spot when the number of hunters drops; and explosives are critical for PvP.
---
Second prof can be whatever you want, but if you're planning on a lot of mara/trib runs, I'd go enchanting. If not, mining or herb. But don't focus on using your profs for cash, when you're the second best farmer behind mages. Just go farm gold if you need some, and go buy your devilsaur set and whatever else you need.
---
Dwarves are by far my favorite race in fantasy... but I could never get myself to play one in WoW. I love the lore and the aesthetics, but I just hate the running animation. Similarly, I don't care for Nelves that much, but I play one because I feel their running animations are pretty fluid. I love the look of a Nelf male in [Valor](http://www.scrollsoflore.com/gallery/albums/wow_renders/armorset_nightelf-male-warrior-1.jpg). 
---
At the same time, Ironforge has always been a second home for me, and it might be my favorite hub in any game. So many good memories there - man. I just can't wait to be back, honestly. 
---
Honestly, you and other people doing this is the problem. The lootsystem is not the problem, people are. 
---
Its like todays society. Ban a shitload of things just because a minority cant handle it. 
---
I forget the classic loot system - was it rolling with greed/need?
---
Honestly might as well use the personal loot system in that case.
---
They are too drunk to recognize it.
---
We had a system that made an automated /roll for everyone signing up for their slot.  
---
Honestly, why not let an item be able to be traded among a raid group for an hour to solve the issue.  How could that possibly negatively impact the game?
---
There are many non-gameplay related reasons why these servers stop functioning and why they might not have big population. Private info leaks, legal issues, profitability, p2w shops etc. And people who are constantly looking for fresh servers are fools IMO.
---
(Anyway, VG claims to have been founded in 2009, rwow is a 4 years fun server, etc. )
---
One of the reasons I'm looking for Classic is to finally have a stable WoW 1.12 environment without having to fear about my account getting wiped or my private info getting compromised. So for me 5 years is definitely not a conjecture, maybe they'll have to merge some realms after some time, but I believe that if they won't introduce some sort of powercreep, we will see Classic still doing fine.
---
If you make an insane amount of gold you could pay a guild to carry you. You need two drops from bwl that only one person can loot and much of the quest line requires a raid group. Not to mention the dozens of hours 20+ people will need to put in to get enough carapaces for you to get enough rep. 
---
Idk how much it would cost. Maybe 100k? Lol
---
Both are good classes, the mage has a higher skill cap and higher potential for outplaying people and less gear reliant. 
---
However you can still get by with lots of stamina gear on the warlock, and it is a much more forgiving class in terms of having to know mechanics and maneuvering your character in 3d space.
---
If you are new to pvp I would say go Warlock, if you have some experience with Kiting and outplaying people or if that kind of thing interests you then I would suggest Mage for sure.
---
Doesn't change the fact that not intervening still isn't keeping things classic. 
---
Not the person your talking to here, but I want to chime in. 
---
I can't imagine they would put in a greed-only mechanic, when they addressed that the reason for a mechanic being needed is that they don't want to pay for more GMs than necessary. After all, what is the point of that system in a Classic setting? I could see a use in the instance of somebody deciding they want an item after they've rolled greed; with that system, everybody wins. 
---
But that doesn't tie in with GMs very much, when the majority of loot issues are along the lines of a misclick, or the wrong person needing something. 
---
So i guess, i'd be happy with a greed-only option, so long as it means theres no Need-roll system abuse, but I still highly doubt that's what Blizzard means. 
---
There’s no arenas in classic dipshit
---
People who ninja absolutely get a stink. Maybe not forever, but at least a % of people know that person is a ninja. Compare that to a need-trading system where people wouldnt even *know* that a ninja-ing took place.
---
I would prefer this over loot trading in the game. Just ignore all tickets for loot issues between players. 
---
If it's implemented, I will abuse the hell out of it. Pretty certain everyone who makes friends will do the same. Especially in UBRS.
---
Yup definitely, thats why vanilla pvp is so cool and why the spell-pruning stuff they did in later expansions sucked. Since we have the ability to do so, theres no reason not to have it bound even if you have to put it on a weird keybind out of the way like Ctrl + Shift +V  lol
---
I remember being more than a little confused that the Felsteed quest just involved talking to Strahad. All the other Warlock quests up to that point involved a fair bit of travel &amp; work, was honestly a little let down by how easy it was. The Dreadsteed quest chain more than made up for it though.
---
Had my trial and first MC run ever in a guild that was still trying Domos. I went third place in damage with my rogue. Trial ended that raid. 
---
You're wrong.
---
Yeah ofcourse it will happen, but on private servers u get a message every 30 mins on lvl 1 accs. Blizzard already made trial accounts unable to whisper others. I'm not going to say "it wont happen no matter what" but if blizzard is smart about it and just ban every single one the first few weeks most of the big "sites" will see it as a bad strategy to whisper people ingame etc and will stop advertising that way.
---
This is why I’m confused about so many people saying the war effort will be over so quickly lol. 100s of people would need to dedicate all of their character slots to stockpiling, and for what? Getting into a raid earlier than most? I for one have no life and will be busting ass to get scarab lord and would love for it to be more exclusive on my server but I have zero intention of stockpiling anything. 
---
The most expensive? lol, you need to do some research
---
Honestly it was way more solo friendly than retail is now.
---
The [gloves](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15758) are sold by a merchant in Ungoro, and the [pants](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15772) drop off of slimes in Ungoro. It's a very easy set to make too.. 22 Devilsaur leather, 1 Cured Rugged Hide, and 60 Rugged leather is all you need for a single set.. You can even wear it pre 60 (53 for gloves, 55 for pants).
---
A downside is you have to become a tribal leatherworker and get 300 LW to make the set.
---
The hardest part would be getting the legging pattern from the slimes since the drop rate is very low, followed by getting 300 LW without someone else helping you by funneling skins your way.
---
I thought some of them dropped for the whole party.
---
Yes, max ranks outside of FN for me. Depending on what I do, I delay buying higher ranks of some spells like CoC/poly until mount.
---
If he doesn't have the time to raid I don't think He'll have the time to grind R14 but otherwise you're right
---
Lol like you are going to be spamming R1 fb, it's to catch someone running to or away from you.  You are going to be running after you cast it, gcd means nothing.
---
I played an Orc warlock in classic and every time I just stomped an Alliance rogue because their cheap shot went RESIST and they had no idea how to continue from here is something I fondly remember to this day. 
---
&gt; Like when you buy a can of coke but it's actually pepsi. Everyone loves that. :)
---
Spot on analogy.... Let's keep it as is with Blizzlike turnin values and have some servers be done with the War Effort in 24 hours instead then, at least then you know you are drinking Coke. 
---
What more amazes me is the utter lack of empathy. Not in our guild? No loot. Fuck him. Not a single 'hmm, what if I was that person...I'd really die inside a little if I saw that nice loot pass'. 
---
That ruthless internet mentality is what kills a lot of fun in games. People are assholes. Period.
---
honestly the difficulty of regular mobs just doesn't warrant a full group to begin with. If you're a mage, you're lucky to get a single fireball off.
---
This could be the most intellectually dishonest thing I read all week.
---
No. No it was not.
---
Thanks.
---
Great guide, keep up the good work!
---
Reading those replies just make me giggle. "Hey, we are assholes, cater to us damnit!"
---
And George Bush better be president again. Also they better have those shitty horde vs. alliance MT. dew and give me my fucking Zune back.
---
I mean, it's a give and take IMO. 
---
Yes, stock prices are at an all time low, but could that be because they're cutting costs while producing games to help extract profit, but this results in a less than stellar experience for the people who purchase them which then causes stock prices to go down because the people buying their games complain about them? 
---
It's probably more complex than that, I'm sure there's a lot of internal stuff going on there too (by evidence of an article someone posted a few weeks ago about the multiple shakeups going on at ATVI), but I can't help but feel as though the tension is coming from a rift between trying to drive down costs so that more profit can be maximized which tends to cause a terrible experience for everyone inside (the employees) and outside (the gamers) the company. 
---
Shoulders make a race
---
I guess we'll see won't we.  I wish they would comment to clear up the confusion.
---
Yeah but it's easier to find the enchant they want in the list of it's the only one with a 1 next to it.
---
AMS-OG
---
EU-german
---
horde PVP
---
3+ raids per week
---
semi hc raids and ganking
---
https://ams.cool
---
This.  Look at the guys gear, take screen shots.  Just be smart about it and you'll be fine.
---
Switching mats will only lead to furious trading in the neutral AH. Just a little goldsink but nothing time related. 
---
Dude one after another after another. Hyped to watch this after work.  
---
Purely rolling a shaman because of all these videos with you and your brother. the Totem one helped me so much and same with the 2 part leveling video analyzing which is the most efficient spec / enchantment. Catch me out there Tauren Shaman! 1-39 enhance, 40-60 ele, 60 on the pvp field resto/ele spec!!!!!! and healing raids on the side!  
---
Thanks again guys
---
ofc
---
Have you played either retail or classic?!! You can play retail without talking to a single person.  You can get as far as raiding LFG and maybe even further without making a single friend or saying a single word. Good fucking luck even leveling in classic without making friends.
---
Classic has so many group quests/elites and the zones don't have enough quests to level you to the next zone, so you will often have to group up just to finish a quest or to pick up a group to do some dungeons just to get a couple levels and move to the next zone.
---
Source: currently playing a classic private server after getting sick of retail
---
You can preach that all you want, but the reality is: That's how it was, and that's how it would be again if implemented.
---
The make constantly shit decisions.
---
It'll stabilise.
---
This one I don't really mind as much to be honest. At least it stayed in the guild. And the mage *did* have to you all his points to get it.
---
A dps tracker that gives you the option to not record ignite damage.
---
Blizzard won't be doing any core class rebalancing. There will be a scarcity of tanks for dungeons, and plenty for raids.
---
Seems to solve it for me. You can't trade the item to your friend without appearing as a ninja, but you can trade it to someone if it was misslooted.
---
Players will play in whatever bounds are set for them. It doesn’t matter what you judge one player. Judge the system.
---
Allowing Needed loot to be tradeable creates a system that can be abused by ninjas, groups, and guilds, all at the expense of the average player
---
Classics original system didn’t have that problem. 
---
If that doesn’t worry you then I don’t know what to say
---
Cool, I had just been watching some of your shaman-related videos for the first time over the past few days.  Definitely going to watch this one later.
---
ORCS IS MADE FOR FIGHTIN' AND WINNIN'!
---
Orc posture is fine
---
The hunch that trolls have is way over the top imo
---
Not in any way, shape, or form. I don't even understand how you could reach this conclusion.
---
You'll only be yelled at if you let the tanks die.
---
Cause only retail players does that, right?
---
Funny I always ran with friends in dungeons and we never did this. 
---
I remember shamans being op at early levels, especially after getting frost shock. Id see twink teams of 5 or so shamans just steamrolling everything in the 29s.
---
Why goblin? Jumper cables are BoE, so you still can get a goblin eng to craft them for you even if you're gnomish. And this applies to most spec stuff be it gnomish or goblin.
---
Straight up tell players Blizzard won’t change loot.  It would be simple and end of story.
---
Instead, Blizz pulls a typical 2019 head-up-their-ass move and changes Classic loot system to save a few bucks and appease EA overlords.
---
Modern day Blizz really is a fuckin mess. “Don’t you guys have phones”
---
Hi, /u/FetTR
---
So even with a "decent" guild that has full roster, 2 or max 3 people can even dream off a mount? Well I guess it will be resolved for the Gm and the officers for most cases unfortunately.
---
&gt; where finding a group to even do an instance is much harder
---
I really think you're misremembering how difficult it actually was to find groups.  Especially with the new servers, people are going to be running dungeons all the time.  Leveling dungeons or level 60 dungeons are going to be populated.  Yeah, you might have to actually speak up in general chat or lfg and interact with people, but that's the entire point.
---
Tbh this is the biggest mountain out of a molehill I've ever seen.
---
You need new friends 
---
I remember running a ton of premade AB to get PVP rank to buy the PVP epic mount. I was a raiding priest and terrible at gold farming.
---
I was raiding MC in 18 minutes on a pserver back in 2001, when WoW was nothing more than a twinkle in Mike Morhaime’s eye.
---
i'll just ignore any player that starts whispering me for BoP loot. 
---
Thanks! Hope you enjoy this one!
---
Excellent, glad we could help..this video may challenge some assumptions. I hope you enjoy and I'll be on the lookout for ya!
---
&gt; The AH market also slowly turns into a market for rich end gamers and twinkers.
---
This is actually what worries me somewhat. There will be no 'cheap' stuff in the AH. There will be so many people playing the AH that you will always pay the most expensive price you were willing to pay (and feel bad for it because you overpaid so much but you really really wanted the item). 
---
There will be no 'Hey! I found this cheap restaurant with good food and cheap prices'. Every restaurant will be expensive as hell because they found out that the true and absolute boundary of what you're willing to pay for stack of clam meat is &lt;x&gt; gold, so it will be priced exactly that.
---
It's simply because we come from the orcs, we eat with spoons and forks, WE LOVE TO EAT OUR PORK! 
---
The problem with that is if someone rolls need by accident or perhaps doesn't know that the item is bad for him which might very well happen since vanilla itemisation is really weird. So if an item with lots of spirit drops and a mage needs because he think it's good for him, the priest who actually needs the item will get pissed. With loot trading it can be explained to the mage, well at least attempted.. we know how retarded mages can be.. and he can give the item to the priest instead. 
---
You join a 5 man dungeon or pug raid.  There is an item you need.  Same with one other player.  you need, they need...You win the roll loot is yours.  But that other guys has two friends.  They both need as well.  You now lose your roll.  They trade to their buddy.  Has your experience been negatively impacted?
---
Do I think it'll probably go back up again? Yeah, most likely.
---
But I also don't think a Classic WoW sub is your best bet in looking for investment advice. Most people here probably don't know much about it, and you'll probably get responses like this other guy that are just salty and telling you not to invest cause "Activision bad".
---
You walk a thin line there because it is illegal to volunteer for for-profit companies.
---
You have to have GM support for loot issues. These are paying customers, you can’t just leave them out in the cold for something that you can easily make right.
---
Unpopular opinion, but people don’t realize just how expensive GMs are and just how much Blizz will save by putting loot trading in the game. It’s in the tens of millions of $ per year.
---
Moreover, it’s a mechanic that can only be abused very situationally, and is actually a big win for many contexts (e.g. raids on ML).
---
Self-serve customer service is great, loot trading is fine. This community is too riled up about it.
---
It's a fucking 5 man. Loot there is shit anyway. Promotes guild play and friendships.
---
I actually expect raggie to be killed by a PUG consisting of all the early 60s of the various guilds. Big chance those 60s form their own guild pretty fast after that event though ;-)
---
It's what ALWAYS happens on new servers. Guilds form, players rush, find out most of their guild lags behind and they form a new guild with the other rushers who they leveled up together with. And that will be the premier raid guild of the server. 
---
Yeah I’ve been thinking about how they must be undervalued and they’re bound to come back... 
---
but at the same time I just don’t have faith in Activision Blizzard anymore. People are SUPER critical of greedy game companies now and Activision is the definition of that. 
---
Maybe they’ll turn it around in the near future but I have a sneaking suspicion that things are in full melt down mode over at Activision HQ and they’re likely going to try to pull more shady business practices on their fans as a result.. which is exactly what got them in this position in the first place. 
---
That being said, hopefully classic remains pure lols
---
Thank you. Glad you enjoyed it.
---
Well if you're alliance you're also the only healer with an aoe heal.
---
But yeah, I've heard it's very common to just spam PI priests and one full support PI/SW bitch for the warlocks.
---
Still, I've healed as a holy paladin and it was the most boring thing I've done in my life. My gf mains Priest and it looks way more fun.
---
Yeah. IME by the time AQ comes out it's very difficult to find tanking warriors for dungeons. All the warriors who are willing to tank have found raid guild homes and don't need dungeons anymore. All the DPS warriors who are not willing to tank still won't tank a dungeon, or if they do they'll be terrible at it. You bank on finding a diehard feral who can't get a raid spot and so runs dungeons. Basically, the dungeon scene dies around the time AQ opens up. If you don't have pre-BiS by then, you may as well wait on a fresh -- or roll a tank yourself.
---
I did not even know this was possible or a thing. Did not think about it. Why should I? Content was easy even with a twink so why are you doing this crap. 
---
Liar I deleted it 
---
Many of the top guild players have nothing else to do in their lives. They *live* WoW. If they had lives, they wouldn't play WoW 24/7.
---
So if they accomplished everything, there's always the faster run for them to go for. Or create their 12th lvl 60 alt.
---
Heigh ho, heigh ho! Uhhhh second verse, same as the first... 
---
Right. I’m a little worried already that the beta will be too short. A lot of people were hoping for word about one in February, and if we get too short of a beta phase, with too many flaws at launch, ActiBlizzion won’t delay the launch for too long unlike Blizzard of old.
---
I've been actively playing on pservers for a while and have 55days played on one character and 35 on my alt just on lightbringer alone haha so everything is quite fresh actually (RIP those literal months of my life!)
---
You are right about having to use chat, that is the fun part!
---
It is easy to find dungeons that are popular, but some of them fall our of fashion and if you need a prebis piece from LBRS or something it will be harder to get. UBRS runs go all the time of course, but you are usually rolling against literally 5-6 other people since all rogues wars and hunters all want double dalrends+truestrike etc
---
And 20-mans.
---
Isn't the Legion system exactly the same, but with the caveat you can't trade if the item is an ilvl upgrade? 
---
Then my original point still stands. Sword/mace bonus is around 4-5% bonus damage.
---
Yes and you had to click twice to confirm your roll.
---
Now, for Classic, Blizzard is introducing a new system: even after items are Needed and soulbound you can trade them.
---
This system existed in wotlk/cata and was notoriously abused by groups of friends and guilds at the expense of the average player.
---
It’s the single biggest thing they’re changing in Classic (that they’ve revealed so far) and it’s a terrible decision.
---
Druid T3 is my favorite set in the game and a personal goal for classic.
---
Part of the reason I rolled Dwarf in Vanilla was because I was a huge LOTR fan at the time and I loved the Tolkien influence in the Warcraft universe’s dwarves. The accents are always a plus too. Also, as soon as I saw that dwarf hunter in the intro cinematic I was hooked. I just had to choose that class. 
---
I would look at it later today. I think we're going to get bad news today, hence the layoffs. 
---
They have enough cash where they can make a big hit, but I think you'd have to wait until 2020-2021 before they get something out the door. Assuming you have 0 faith in Diablo Immortal which is their only new product for this year.
---
Customer service is extremely expensive, why is it hard to believe that it’s the most expensive part of running an MMO? Servers are cheap, and the game doesn’t need much ongoing development.
---
Hopefully they actually do this instead, its the obvious answer
---
I’m excited to hear that this playstyle is viable. I loved playing protection in PvP during retail. It’s very encouraging to hear that it can be done in classic as well.
---
However, just how a resto shaman can, as you said above, bring totems a healing priest can bring shadow weaving. SPs are just as useless as enhancement shamans.
---
We don't bring any of them if we're min maxing, we bring them cause it's fun and we don't need to min max in vanilla.
---
He requested a scenario.  I gave him one.  I agree, guild play and friendships are vital to classic.  You can (and must imo) have that in classic.  However, even with that, i know i would be pissed if I went to a 5 man for a specific piece of gear and some off class wins the roll for his buddy in the group.  I know build my own group, reserve the item...blah blah. 
---
And when they inevitably fuck it up, they're all going to leave.  I'm playing on a p-serve right now, but plan on re-subbing when classic comes out.  But if they add in all the hand-holding and retail-pandering bullshit, my sub won't last more than a month.
---
&gt; The problem with that is if someone rolls need by accident or perhaps doesn't know that the item is bad for him which might very well happen since vanilla itemisation is really weird
---
In that case we'd simply have the original loot system working as it did by default
---
You're asking for WotLK style loot trading which is what everyone is trying to avoid.
---
My solution is the only one I see being a viable compromise between "no loot trading at all" and full on "loot trading so my friends can roll on an item and give it to me later"
---
I will say you're brave for advocating for the 2nd option on this subreddit lol
---
Yes if you’re just some random bozo in the guild there’s about a 0% chance you’ll get a free ride. 
---
I don’t even know if average raiding guilds will have any sceptre bearers considering it’s very taxing on the entire guild and only one person really gets anything out of it.
---
I agree with what you say, but not with that it's digital crap. Virtual money represents time, which translated back to real life effort/money.
---
50g represents a couple of hours of your real life time. It has value.
---
GNOME MASTER RACE
---
I was being sarcastic.
---
Every class *can* solo hogger at level 12 if you don't get adds. Some easier/faster than others.
---
It also requires another /10 days of play time. That's quite a serious time investment.
---
As far as I know, the modern system does not allow you to trade gear you rolled Need for, only greed and master loot. 
---
AoE taunt and enraged regen are the only ones that come to mind, but even still they are very short.
---
LOL
---
Spoken exactly like someone who never played Classic.
---
5-mans in Classic took sometimes half an hour or an hour *to get a group going*, and some took 2 hours to run. Deadmines is the first ally dungeon and can take two hours to get through with an average team. The loot reward there can last you till the 30s.
---
But you’re comfortable completely downplaying all this because “it’s a fucking 5 man” 
---
Male troll*
---
Females stand up straight.
---
Blizzard has said themselves they can’t afford GMs to handle loot issues like vanilla.
---
So no matter what Classic can’t stay 100% Classic in this regard
---
What’s your suggestion?
---
He’s needs his elemental earth for AQ, don’t mind him.
---
Pvp hearing is far more of a commitment than raiding really
---
Classic was never meant for Solo Players, if you play Solo you're gaming experience gets reduced A LOT. 
---
It’s easy to say that as someone who never played Classic.
---
But when you sink 3 hours into a Classic dungeon and realize you got ninja’d by two buddies abusing this system, then you’ll be looking back going “....fuck”
---
Minimap always in the bottom middle, right where I always look to see my bars &amp; hitpoints :P
---
Ypu can buy/sell those arrows on the AH but people usually buy the bullets and turn them into arrows because the people selling arrows sell them at 2x the price. 
---
Expensive? Sure. Most expensive? No.
---
Aye, if you ever plan on making an alt, ideally you should level one toon to about 40, and then park them in an inn for 2-3 days at a time, while you level your other toon to 40 as well. It's the most efficient way if you don't want to settle in to just 1 class/spec.
---
Appreciated.
---
Then you have not been playing the same game as me. There is plenty of pre-raid gear that lasts well into Bwl. 
---
&gt; It is infinitely easier though to use a LFG system like they had in later expansions which is what I was referring to.
---
Of course it is, and it is one of the driving forces that pushed WoW from being a multi-player game to a single-player game with occasional other play interactions.
---
I'm honestly not worried.  I'm not going to rush to 60; I have a life now.  I'll probably find a semi-laid back guild and through that will be able to run just about anything that I need.
---
My worst fear, honestly, is the game being rushed by people so try-hard for 60 that they either burn out, or discourage others from even trying after they've cornered the markets on high level mats.
---
during launch - noone will be able to solo hogger and hogger will be spawn camped by the time someone even hits level 12. 
---
So I am asking - when do you think hogger will become spawn camped? When a bunch of level 6s arrive? can a 5-man level 6 players kill hogger? or level 7? 8?
---
Yeah that's fair.  
---
Cow master race
---
I understand everyone’s skepticism, however this sub is changing the narrative from, “Yeah! Official Classic WoW servers!” To “Acti-Blizzard is a dumpster fire and they are going to ruin Classic Wow, grab your pitchforks!” 
---
They haven’t told us too much of anything and there are a ton of comments assuming the worst. Can we be more positive and not shit on every 2 sentence response we get from devs and jump to irrational conclusions. I for one am excited for this and the constant shit posting about how they are going to ruin it, will deter players. On top of that we cannot confirm they are going to do any of the changes people are so sure they are going to implement.
---
We also have to remember that a lot has changed for the landscape of WoW. There are some changes that I believe will better optimize the play experience and I know some will disagree but there are certain “QoL” changes that I believe must be done for classic WoW to maintain a healthy player base. We have to remember that they have to appeal to the broader player base, not just us die hards. 
---
My point is that we have to keep the community from turning toxic. The point of the game is to have fun and interact with others, and being pessimistic cry babies doesn’t help anybody. 
---
3 DR category:
---
* Controlled stuns (Cheap Shot, Concussion Blow, Charge)
---
* Non-controlled stuns (Mace stuns, Blackouf from spriests)
---
* Kidney Shot 
---
I was around level 43 on an Alliance rogue, and still didn’t have the money for my mount. 
---
I joined a world PvP raid on the crossroads. The horde surmounted a solid defense, so we had a few fun battles trying to take over the crossroads. At one point a level 60 noticed I was running everywhere, and asked why I didn’t have my mount yet. I said I was still 20g short. Without me asking they opened trade and gave me 20g. I was blown away by their generosity! After the raid I went straight to Elywyn forest to get my first horse :) 
---
Based on what ?
---
If that's the case, it won't matter either way when DM will be released, so what exactly is your point?
---
Similar effect share DRs. For example, Gouge/Sap and both incapacitates and share DRs.
---
For stuns, there’s 3 DR categories:
---
* Kidney Shot
---
Expected shit article but was actually really good.
---
Activision doesn’t understand their consumers.
---
I stop reading at «  can’t afford GM ».... multi millions dollars income for a game in maintenance mode with low cost.... can’t pay some indian buddy to do the GM job ?
---
Maybe they want to recreate the buggy mess that was the initial launch of wow lols
---
Then my original answer still stands. Only on private servers.
---
I'm not talking about 5 man.  I don't support it in instances.  For pug raids it doesn't really matter though, loot is just the luck of the draw in pugs to begin with.
---
The quest to kill him is available at level 6. So, level 6.
---
What other Vanilla is there? Classic is months away and the superiority of humans for melee dps won’t change.
---
You win this thread!
---
took the day off school, did sm several times, dinged 40 grinding raptors? near the ogres in arathi highlands.  can still remember running around elwynn on my horse (the red/brown colour, forgot name)
---
Going enhance shammy tank 1-60.  Fight me!
---
GREEN EZ BEST
---
&gt; If you take a druid healer in a 5-toon run that means you also need a DPS shaman, DPS paladin or DPS priest and all of those options are kind of mediocre compared to a mainspec DPS
---
You don't NEED to.  You can get by without a rezz.  Plus, your solution is to make druids better at the expense of making it *even harder* to get groups for specs that are already very difficult to get groups.
---
&gt; you can use sunder
---
Only on pservers that didn’t bother actually fixing it. 
---
Honestly, the loot system would be the problem if it was added to Classic, since it didn’t exist in Vanilla, and would therefore be a change... Ban the shit from Classic, not because of the issues with society and the fact that the minority can’t handle it, but because the shit doesn’t belong in Classic! 
---
ITT: Blizzard should totes not implement this system, because I was one of the dickbags who went along with the legion of other fucktards who abused these kind of hairbrained systems.
---
A down ranked frostbolt is used for the slow not the damage. Waiting for GCD is fine because you get the slow faster so you can begin moving. 
---
Oh you wanna talk about the future? I didn't know you could predict it, but ok. The min/maxing with human is only for PvE, if you wanna pick a garbage PvP race for 4-5% more damage in a game that is very easy in PvE and has 15 year old PvE content, go ahead!
---
I wouldn't touch ATVI (or any video game company) with a 10 foot pole.  Releasing a popular game is not going to correlate directly with stock prices.  There are so many other components that need to be consider that have little to do with actual product.  Video game stocks are more volatile than other "tech" stocks like the FAANG stocks.  If gou are looking to invest in companies you know, buy FAANG, intel, microsoft.
---
I’m not wasting any more time with this.
---
It has a 3 minute cooldown not 90 seconds. 
---
It shouldn’t take more than 6 days to hit 60 as a Mage. And yes it’s totally worth it because Mages can make 100g an hour farming dme. Nothing tops it. 
---
I thought 2 hour queus followed by a server crash were features :).
---
The original loot system is what they want to change. And just to be clear, I would prefer the original over loot trading as it is now. Even though loot trading will only be a positive thing for me since I never pug anything, but it does happen that someone missloots something and I would like that to be addressed. I understand that solo players are worried.
---
The obvious downside to loot sharing as implemented in WotLK is that people can need for a friend. This will be remedied by making the item soulbound when equipped so the group can check that it was needed for a good reason. I would also add that it should only be shareable inside the instance, so you can't use the "I haven't learned the weapon skill yet". If the player refuses to equip the item regardless, because he wants to trade it to his mate, he will be branded as a ninjalooter. 
---
During vanilla this wasn't always a big deal because people didn't know who was a ninjalooter, but with modern addons it's very easy to completely ostracise a player. An example of this is on private servers where even with populations many times bigger than a vanilla server, people still get cast out for ninjaing and they will have trouble finding a group or raid. I know this because I myself accidentally mislooted an item to someone in a UBRS pug and I couldn't join a pug every again on that server. It was so bad that I had to actually reroll. 
---
Nope, not at all.  I definitely think this is a deep passion project from the developers and serves multiple purposes for the higher ups.  It increases MAUs, they make some money, and it makes fans happy.  People at the upper end often forget how important happy fans can be.  We've seen Blizzard lose a lot of favor while pushing into more predatory business practices.  This is a great way for them to get a lot of fans back by catering to nostalgia rather than putting huge amounts of money into projects that won't be as financially successful.  
---
Well they tell everyone to sell in chat but you still get impatient ppl in mafia putting them on AH. But its not untrue at all
---
They shouldn’t make the already easy raids even easier. Many items from DM are vastly better than tier 1. 
---
Or being able to craft via the trade window.  That's a good one.
---
Because you fucking lost 
---
Shut up, Vice
---
Article is pretty on point.
---
It's fine cause a well kitted engineering 29 mage is OP as hell.
---
I don't
---
I mained a druid back then so I guess with travel form getting a mount just wasn't very special to me
---
True. It's often faster to farm the gold and buy it off the AH, then grind the maths/profs and jump thru all the required hoops to make them yourself.
---
Also just wanted to add, apparently all spells have an inherent 1% chance to miss? IDK if that's for boss targets but it adds to my point about shadow focus if correct
---
agree on level 29 hunter, but going by this, level 29 druid should also be awesome... no travel form, but you already have +30% movespeed from feline swiftness.
---
It depends on the approach. If they were to build (or rent) a building and staff it and adjust the pay to the cost of living for the area I could see it the $$ racking up pretty quickly especially in the long term, but, I still think that development would be more expensive...but seeing how Classic doesn't have any planned development after launch Customer Service would probably be the most expensive thing for it....
---
That said, they could easily mitigate costs but still keep a proper GM staffing. For example, they could have customers work as GM's for a reduction of their subscription, or higher work from home GM's around the country so that they don't have to have a dedicated building to build/rent and could adjust the payment of the GM's to the price of living for the area they're living in.
---
That's of course just me spit balling, Blizzard is a billion dollar company and while customer service isn't the cheapest thing, it's not a make or break for a company, it's just one of the easiest things to cut from the budget and is often one of the first things to go/take a hit when profits are looking to be maximized. 
---
Unfortunately no pictures from that run.  At that time it was just another PUG, ya know.  
---
While we don’t celebrate that day every year (because neither of us knows the day!  Just another PUG!) we did break out a bottle of champagne a couple months ago when we tried a private vanilla server for the first time and ran SM.
---
You might as well drop some money on a Fruity my friend. Investing serious amounts of money as an individual into a company like Activision is a fool's game, you're better off putting your money into safer, smaller, organisations with lower but more consistent returns, or just putting money into an ISA. 
---
Sure, you won't get that amazing effect of investing in such and such company before they hit the big time, but Activision already hit the big time. Unless you invest more money than you like have it's not an effective get rich quick scheme. 
---
had a level 29 hunter, that was awesome.
---
one thing I've never seen mentioned in twink threads is movement speed... wouldn't a trio of level 29 hunter, druid and shaman be ridiculously effective? all of them have at least +30% movement speed in one way or another, and when everybody else is running around in snail's pace, +30-40% speed should be the king.
---
(no idea about the individual class effectiveness, though. I know shamans don't have WF and druid get ravage at 32, so that might put a damper on some things)
---
Who ‘s Docken?
---
&gt; Yes if you’re just some random bozo in the guild there’s about a 0% chance
---
Ah sad face :( Thank you.
---
Hey guys, hope you like this latest episode of my podcast series! You all seemed to like the previous episode with Defcamp &amp; Melderon, so I'm looking forward to getting this series really going strong!  
---
Any suggestions of who to talk to next would be welcome :)
---
If you wanted to implement such a system, I think there are clever ways to handle this with vanilla items.  To start, needed items should be Soulbound, full stop.  So no needing on BOEs to resell.  If you can't use it and want to sell it, you have to greed it.
---
To start you can easily restrict need based on what is equipable.  Clothies can't wear plate for example, so no need to need roll.  Same thing can be done for all the weapon types, if you can't equip, can't need roll.
---
One step further, you can look at the stats of an item to figure out who could possibly ever use it by having a list of stats that are eligible for need.  So if an item with Int/Sta/SpHit drops, Warrior can't roll on it because Warrior can't use Int and Spell Hit (Sta is a gimme for all classes, so nobody "needs" it).  Items with generic stats like +Sta or no-stat items are need-able by anybody who can equip it.
---
The real big edge case is Paladins (they need basically anything), but they're really the exception not the rule.  Everybody else would either have stat restrictions from the system described, and/or armor/weapon class restrictions.
---
Modern tanks dual wield in full fury spec in Vanilla, you know that right? 
---
If your going to be raiding in the survival spec don't take entrapment. In raids you mainly drop frost traps to help the tanks group up mobs and entrapment works against that. It also works like a frost nova where mobs will ignore their threat table and attack anything in melee range which can get people killed. Same with improved wing clip, though though you won't use that in raids much if ever.
---
Completely random? That would be amusing.
---
Now you all need to farm peacebloom, lesser nether essence and manual crowd pummelers.
---
19 hunter
---
29 rogue 
---
39 mage 
---
49 warrior 
---
Just my experience.  
---
Consider that blizzard employ nearly 10k staff. If each member of staff gets 5 keys that is 50k potential closed beta testers. That doesn’t include those that have previously tested for blizzard that could right now be testing but under an NDA. 
---
It is quite possible and very likely that there has been ongoing internal testing for months on various aspects of the game. Some testing can also be automated. 
---
Consider if blizzard has a public beta the actual value to the project is almost nothing. 99% of people on open beta tests want early access to decide if they play later. Only 1% actually do any testing of value to the developer. 
---
These days beta testing is a marketing tool not part of the actual production process. 
---
Honestly I would be happy with or without a beta. Having a public test is probably only useful for configuring the server infrastructure for the demand in the early weeks when the population is at its highest
---
And can outhreat warriors on a good number of 40 man fights.
---
I only twinked a 19 hunter and a 29 rogue in classic, but I did have a 49 twink warrior with Kang’s in BC. Hooooo man was that fun.
---
Cooking.
---
Yes
---
I played on a laptop with a 1920 x 1200 resolution.
---
Great video as always!  
---
Your tests vs theory for low ranks is off because there is a below level 20 penalty.  
---
It's Base(1-((20-LevelLearned)\*0.0375))  
---
LBolt rank 1 would be 43(1-((20-1)\*0.0375) = 12.36%  
---
LBolt rank 2 would be 57(1-((20-8)\*0.0375) = 31.35%
---
And 5x Baron Rivendare's Deathcharger...
---
He's a classic WoW streamer that streams on Youtube. He goes live 6 days a week, I think, but I got in contact with him through the [ClassicWoW.live](https://ClassicWoW.live) project :)
---
&gt; Releasing a popular game is not going to correlate directly with stock prices.
---
Are you sure about that? EA's stock went up considerably after Apex's release. 
---
Isn't it usually known when family and friends is happening? Not that they specifically advertise for it, but that some news escapes from closed doors? 
---
Seriously Big ups here for rested xp! So Nice and flavourful mechanic. Lets you feel like its ok spending some time away from the game while still keeping commited ^^
---
Enchanting is useless for mara runs and herbing is useless for trib, so I'd pick based on if trib is solo'able or not
---
You will get a biased opinion searching for a recommendation on this subreddit, but yes. It is an absolute classic in the gaming industry and there are many tangible reasons as to why it was such a massive success.
---
If you’re not afraid to give up instant gratification while embracing a vast fantasy world, you’ll be greeted with a very dedicated community and long term satisfaction in any area of the game that you set your mind to.
---
The entire Activision narrative is odd. They merged in 2008. Nobody blamed Activision for the problems in Cata, MoP or Wod. It suddenly got popular to offload all the blame to Activision, as if they've just turned greedy. 
---
I think you’re vastly overestimating the number of people who get it. I believe we only had one person on our server get it. It’s a crazy amount of rep to farm, you have to clear MC and BWL and at least one of the drops only drops for a single person, and do several tough world boss 40 man encounters. And there’s only a 10? hour window where people can even get the mount. So unless there was some mass coordination/understanding to not start the event until multiple people were ready, that goes out the window. I mean shit I was asleep/at school during the entire event on my server. 
---
I remember being in my mid 40's, finally making the trip down near Helm's Bed Lake to buy my ram. The anticipation on the way there from Ironforge was palpable.  
---
Idk, if you can find 40 people this dedicated to memes, they’ll have a good time.
---
Level them all at once. Be the scourge of STV!
---
Shamans are such a fun class. Played as my main during vanilla. Yes, sometimes I wished I had rolled a mage or a warrior instead, but being somewhere between the two is very fun. 
---
Biggest thing that will make u feel terrible about your character...
---
1v1s vs warlocks. 
---
It's because there's been turnover in leadership positions. People don't want to believe that Morheim could have moved on solely because, you know, it's been 28 years since he founded the company. They also have trouble with guys like Metzen leaving. In his case he's done interviews with Scott Johnson and has been very candid about the stress of trying to meet players' expectations and the toll it was having on his life which is the reason he moved on.
---
But people want to view this as evidence that Activision is "finally taking over!" over a decade later.
---
Ah ha! Thanks for this!
---
Do it!
---
Tyically it wont.  Perhaps a particularly unexpected surge in sales or an unexpected poor release.  But, we know about games often years before release, they are already calculated into stock prices.
---
If you aren't in a raiding guild that clears bwl? No chance. But if you're just a reliable and active member? Yeah it is possible. 
---
Technically you can do the hardest part (carapace farm) solo if you're the right class or by multi boxing (it'll just take you weeks of 18 hour grinds).  After that a lot of stuff is 5man or happens on the side during raiding. The moonglade/azshara bosses shouldn't be an issue for any guild after that, helping 30 minutes should be the least. Only point of contention would probably be the elementium ore required for the lure.
---
Priests at 19 are insane. Fully twinkled out they are kings of staying alive and a HUGE boon to any team. Gravestone scepter 
---
what about Skinning and mining pre 60 for the mats, then drop skinnning for eng once you reach 60?
---
I'd NEVER do that, they won it, its theirs.
---
If I get a piece I don't need I'll ask if anyone wants it, then you can /w me
---
Cool idea! I always had the soul of Almalexia in a grand soul gem in Morrowind as a trophy.
---
I don't think thats true for ATVI. We don't know anything about their products in 2020 onwards, besides the assumption of the yearly CoDs. 
---
No harm in trying it. Give it a go. If you love it, welcome to the community. If you hate it, at least now you know.
---
Yes but you will need addons, you basically need to have memorized the quests if you actually plan to do them without addons.
---
Definitely second this style of play. Accidentally discovered prot pvp when too broke to respec for the weekend and needed the rep, turns out you scale up pretty well. You're really weak in WSG simply because the raw power of MS for taking down flag carriers and how teams are smaller, but prot in AB and AV is crazy fun. Don't pass on imp shield bash.
---
As an Alliance player, I get really jealous of Shamans everytime I see chain lightning go off in AV.
---
Why would you leak info if you will lose your access and potentially end up in court?  When was the last confirmed leak in a blizzard project?
---
If they don’t already have a testing and QA team in place I would be seriously shocked as even indie developers will have ongoing testing as soon as you have an alpha build in place. 
---
I honk that article hit the nail on the head for me about current WoW.
---
I like the aesthetics and the overall lore and races, I always have. But the actual gameplay is so lacking now.
---
This gentleman has said it perfectly.
---
Agree. It would require huge effort of every person on the server to get it done ahead of time. 
---
Especially now that people know about auto completion most people won't lift a finger (I know I won't). Only some people will push exalted with other cities for mounts.
---
Will there be some servers that happen to have high pop and a disproportinate amount of extremely tryhard guilds that manage to unlock it a week early? Of course.  
---
But not "instantly".
---
However, wasn't there some interview or something where the original wow devs said that aq war effort was too much/bad design?
---
Thanks man, glad you enjoyed it 
---
Thank you. I hope your day goes wonderfully.
---
I will!  But seriously...it's not optimal, and they have to wear leather which sucks, but they do have the talents and at least so far on p-servers it seems to be semi viable, plus questing isn't really a grind either as you can just switch totems for solo'ing.
---
Bit of an exaggeration I think.  Most of the quests can be figured out simply by reading them.  There are definitely some obtuse ones but you can just look them up on classic wow db or ask guildmates if you're lost.
---
Na, that's rubbish. All you have to do is actually read the quests. I don't use questing addons and much prefer it. It's not hard once you get to grips with it.
---
Very weird to see this post as I'm literally in listening to your interview on Countdown to Classic this very moment. Anyway, nice guide and can't wait for launch!
---
You clearly did not play classic 
---
Endgame pvp can be just queuing up for a few games every other day at max level. He said nothing about grinding for rank etc.
---
Your not wrong, but you took what the guy said and applied flawed reasoning
---
Thanks so much! That interview was so much fun!
---
Absolutley. 
---
Kill everything list &gt; Battle pets
---
At 19 Hunters are the best for sure. I believe Warlocks and Priests were beastly as well.
---
This would be wonderful.
---
That's what I'm planning on doing, only even more alt crazy.  Get one to 20, park.  Get second to 20 and second set of professions close to 150, park.  Third, park.  Best part is by your third you'll have the quests streamlined.
---
If you look at the month before and after BFA release, there is very little change.  Im not saying DONT invest in ATVI.  But if your strategy is to invest based on whether a game is well recieved is dangerous.
---
They usually advertise it, though right? For example, [WoDs F&amp;F alpha](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/13645405/warlords-of-draenor-alpha-testing-begins) was advertised, perhaps not the instant it was released, but well before the beta was opened publicly.
---
It's hilarious people think only 0.1% of the population asks for loot to be traded...
---
Try literally thousands of requests per day, or something like 25% of all tickets.
---
Gotta side with Blizzard on this one, they are making the right call.
---
As long as there will be loot sharing - classic will never be vanilla. You will never be able to run dungeons without expecting people to steal your loot. You will never Experience the feeling of community because you always have to watch your back. 
---
This entire game is basically built around what pieces of loot you wear - and how you play your class according to your loot - and you’re telling me loot sharing is nothing to worry about? 
---
Give it a try! Don't research it too much, but try to get a vague idea of what class you want to play, because they all play quite differently. The game really opens up around 18-20, when you start venturing into dungeons in 5-man groups, where the content really starts to challenge you and demand attention. 
---
Actually a decent article wtf
---
And it'll only cost $15 to try for an entire month. Not bad.
---
Haha I love how surprised people are by that fact nowadays :D
---
It costs Blizzard literal millions to staff that many GMs, when they have a feature already programmed into the game that acts identically to the way the GM would have handled the situation.
---
It's not reasonable to ask them to pay millions of dollars to shuffle loot manually.  
---
100% disagree. Get to 60 without addons and you'll be just fine. Read the quests to find out where to go, and when that fails, open up Wowhead or "Thottbott". Theres no shame in looking up where to go, but nothing ruins the atmosphere for a new player like a giant arrow telling you where to go, or your map just shat all over with 3rd party icons.
---
&gt;they can’t afford GMs
---
This seems crazy to me, $15/month for what, 9 million players? 
---
Made me kinda sad, especially given that I am still subbed. 
---
Not sad because of wasting money for sub. 
---
I am simply afraid to break down this relationship because I am not sure I will ever find smth that will give me same emotions and experiences that WoW used to give. 
---
Just a question, why would you spec for the bear talents? 
---
I feel you man it's not easy to let go when youve been playing for so long. Honestly right now I am finding eso to be a lot of fun but I don't think anything beside classic has a chance at bringing back that feel  
---
Never said I was trying to get rich quick or even said I would personally invest.  Just asked a question for a fun thought experiment of "would you" if given the opportunity right now.
---
I agree with this too. I really hope Blizzard checks this sub.
---
I don't mean in the context of a new WoW expansion, I'm saying in the context of a new big product, like an Overwatch, a Skylanders, something like that. 
---
I like the idea of spreading them out more, if you're gonna roll with more alts. That way, if you see a group for Deadmines? Bam, get the warrior in there. Eww, gnomergan, well I want those leggings, ill log over to my rogue. LF1M ZF need healer? May as well hit the priest.
---
That is if you love dungeons anyways. Especially on a 3-4k pop server, there wont be groups looking for what you play *all the time*, so I like to spread it out enough where I can do a dungeon at almost any moment, because I always have a toon in that level bracket.
---
This.  And I'll say something really weird: You Could Actually Abandon A Quest When The Goal Was Out Of Reach Or Unfindable!  (Or just not fun.)   I sometimes get the idea that people play with the mindset that they have to complete 100% of the things they encounter.
---
that, on the other hand, is true. priests are, more or less, made of wet paper... however, on account of the sheer fuckery they can produce and the fact that they're hard to catch unprepared, it's often wiser to leave a leveling priest alone and stick to easier targets.
---
also, it always seemed like that class attracts omnicidal maniacs on both sides, even (especially?) if they're specced as healers, and honestly... fuck that noise.
---
&gt;You need new friends
---
yea you need friends like mine, we went to the store one time and we all stole candy but then we got caught and the manager told my friend to stop picking his nose, we were 6 but still..
---
Wouldn't you need to buy the retail game as well? Or is that free these days  (I quit in 2008) 
---
Everyone thinks their LC is a good LC until the loot drama stats. 
---
If you're DEing items people want, you're not doing the right DKP system. 
---
Yeah I've been there.  Sometimes you just have to cut your losses and move onto another quest or just grind if there's too much competition for the one you're trying to do.
---
Well it's slowing down for everybody else too, immensely. Just remember that ravage / rake / rip are whats doing the damage while leveling.
---
Why would you steal when you can go to jail?
---
I think you are missing the point. No repercussions from blizzard= will always happen.
---
Hence, no to cata loot trade system
---
Maybe some, but not most.  Even dungeon quests that require elite mob kills only drop single quest items.
---
GNOMES are the greatest, but Orcs are the sexiest. 
---
I already bought at 40 ahead the earnings call to play around a little. But there's so much that could go wrong. 
---
ATVI has to prove that Call of Duty kept selling well in December, they need to provide a solid ground for 2019 to ensure investors that they will beat future targets, the global video game market it set to increase by $40+ billion in 2 years and investors needs to be assured that ATVI wants (or can) grab a large portion of that money and by doing that they need to make 2019 a good year, etc etc.

Is this a good spot to buy? If you plan on holding it for long term, sure. A 50% fall from ATH is almost never a bad spot to buy for large companies, but you should always expect that the stock could go down further short term. The only thing I know for sure is that Activision Blizzard has to step it up.
---
Fuck Sida's Bag.
---
That's a well written and actually accurate article
---
Somebody get /u/asmongold to read this
---
It’s what they said.
---
What’s your suggestion? Or did you just come here to criticize 
---
"Why you should let Hunters roll on everything....and why that's a good thing"
---
Yup - that is the entire point of a "game" to some people. There are different types of players out there and many of them find their enjoyment from pushing their gameplay to the boundaries of what is allowed. Same reason they use mob-skips and geometry abuse to jump skip parts of raids and speed run things. There are a lot of sketchy border-line-bannable tactics used in all sorts of different games and that is where the fun is for a lot of people.. pushing that boundary and getting the "most" out of your game within the given ruleset you work in. Same with trying to jump outside the map and stuff like that. 
---
In fact its even the same with any other sport with rules that can be pushed, like in the NFL when they intentionally let the game clock run out by taking a knee and stuff like that to make time run out without actually playing. Its against the spirit of the game, but its pushing the rules to its boundary for maximum benefit, and you cannot fault players for doing that. In fact, you can expect that they WILL do it bc of how large the population is that derives fun this way especially the tryhard pserver community who will be coming in full force doing this for the 10th time haha
---
That’s because the modern system is personal loot
---
Hopefully people will be running them and not just min-max questing to 60.  I love running dungeons because I love the interaction with other players.  Not sure how retailers will respond to that though.
---
I remember being really excited for my class mount as a lvl 40 orc warlock. Seing that fat orc on top of the little horse and it moving around awkwardly made me reroll a gnome lock instead.
---
Sub has replaced the 'battle chest' (all content except for current xpac) - so vanilla through legion content is included in sub price.
---
I want to be that warlock! Fastest gearing up in history (together with the priest and mage)
---
nice joke, though 
---
Overhauling an entire system of Classic in a fundamental way to cater to a small amount of people is not a good solution.
---
25% of tickets, when many people have never submitted a ticket, still works out to a tiny number 
---
That’s fine with a raid group
---
Not fine with 5-man dungeon
---
I remember I was struggling to save up the money because of all the lvl 40 warrior training plus i wanted a shiny new plate set from the AH 
---
I took a loan from a friendly guild member at about lvl 43 and for the next levels up till 60 I was sending him every few gold i could afford up until he said it was enough, it was such a good feeling
---
Just cancelled sub for roughly the reasons outlined above.  Was fun for a month or two but then logged in and found nothing to do.  Now  it’s the new patch and everything being reset I have no desire to do it again.  Doubt have any high hopes for classic tho as I’m sure it will end up being as boring as retail once activision finishes with it.
---
What is, world pvp?
---
It's not a small number, it's absolutely massive when you consider 2M people are playing the game.  There were times when the player base was so much larger than the GM base during vanilla queue times were over 3 days.  When 25% of those issues are long time consuming tickets it has even more of an effect.
---
Don't kid yourself in thinking only a few people ask for this, the reason they came up with this solution is it's painfully obvious they need to provide this service.
---
You have absolutely no idea how many tickets could or will be sent, so don't act like it will be trivial.
---
Be me
---
Be in a PUG DMs group
---
2 hunters, warlock, mage, druid.
---
All lvl 17 or 18
---
"Its ok we'll just use our 3 pets to tank."
---
They were wrong. Oh so wrong.
---
i had randomly been traded over 100g in early vanilla by a guy who was quitting, so i knew i'd afford my mount if i didn't waste the gold. The day i bought it i remember inviting some irl friends i was playing with and telling them to come to me (in dun morogh), i was soo excited about "shocking" them with my new mount. Of course they could see the icon of the mount on my characters party UI, but they were nice enough to pretend they were surprised. I stood on some little hill waiting for them and did the spacebar thing where the ram rises on two feet and does a little roawr. Was so proud. Later when we met up irl they made fun of me for how lame it was.
---
That seems to be the trend for private servers, but it makes sense too. Releasing Naxx reduces the value of earlier content, creates an even bigger rift between casual and hardcore players, and breaks PvP balance significantly. 
---
Of course Naxx needs to come out at some point, but it's not something to release lightly because it significantly changes the feel of the game - keep in mind that a large majority of Vanilla was pre-Naxx. It came out 6 months before TBC, it took months for even hardcore raiders to get much T3 gear. A version of WoW where a significant chunk of the population is running around in T3 never existed in Vanilla.
---
There you go again, wishing that you had more and better stuff than other people with zero grip on the fiscal return of creating a raid. 
---
Raids are one of the most expensive things the WoW team creates. Greg Street helped to usher in LFR and multiple difficulties in an effort to expose more people to one of the expensive aspects of WoW, in creating a raid. In fact, I think that if we did not have LFR and Normal the way they are now, there would be less raiding content overall due to the amount being invested between art, designers, and QA to test the raid stacked against the amount of people actively raiding. 
---
I just can't get over the fact that you think they bastardized dungeons and raiding so that more people could enjoy the most expensive content that Blizzard creates. It just befuddles me that someone would be so selfish as to say their experience is ruined because of accessibility and titanforging. 
---
I met loads. Did it myself once or twice, accidentally pressing need to MLing to the wrong person etc.
---
Shit happens
---
Easy tiger, no need to be so aggressive.
---
I'm looking forward to trying Classic, but agree ninja-looting was a problem. I can see the issues the "current" (still not sure what that means, current from the client they will be using so Legion? Or wrath/cata? Or retail current?) loot system will cause with friends Need'ing on things for others then trading. Or worse offering to sell it to you.
---
I like /u/AndrewCamelton 's suggestion about making Need soulbound, and Greed tradeable for a short time.
---
&gt;  If I'm not mistaken
---
You are not; Back then, not everyone even *knew* where to get the black horse. For most people, it was a "mere" 90 gold though, because most people had honored rep when actually buying their mount.
---
I do remember being woefully short of the required amount, though. Had to grind the ogres in Arathi for *days* on my rogue. Funnily enough, not even a week after finally getting that mount, I decided to reroll a priest, and shelve the rogue. I did get the black stallion on that priest (rogue had been a gnome, so a blue mechanostrider it was for him). I *tried* to get one of the unarmored swift steeds as well, but grinding that amount of gold on a holy priest proved unpossible.
---
I play hunter, I hope you all gonna help me get my blessed blade of the wind seeker first quick when I join the guild :D
---
I made a petition to ban this guy from u/classicwow
---
Flametongue &amp; WF wep rank at different levels ie flametongue in 6's and WF in 10's. Would you suggest rotating those buffs for whatever you leveled most recently?
---
I'm also tempted to give the glib response "How many classic GM's could be hired for $15 Million?"
---
Yeah, that's what I would theoretically do. Good question
---
Isn't "in the modern system" specifically not a reference to LK/cata? it's a reference to the modern/current system, no? Yes, they give a vague description that sounds like LK/cata but I am reading that super differently than you
---
I'm not telling this is the best one, but I remember having a lot of fun with my 49 enh shaman with Kang the Decapitator in WotlK. This bracket was not famous at all for twinks so I was one the only few in each bg. Every wind fury proc was basycally a oneshot. This is also the main reason I'll be maining shaman in classic
---
Removed per rule 1. 
---
&gt;As long as only the people who actually need it roll on it, it's up to them what they do with it.
---
And you have no way of ensuring that this happens with your suggestion.
---
Removed per rule 7. See the extended rules for more information. 
---
This wasn't a one time event though, it started happening frequently when the officers said it was ok. I bought a few items myself this way, both in guild runs and pugs. 
---
Why are you responding to posts that are 4 days old, talk about a maturity issue.
---
Classic might help =)
---
Removed per rule 1 and 7. 
---
??? Raids are master looted.  If someone that doesn't need it is allowed to roll, that's a failure on the part of the raid leader and master looter.
---
That scenario seems pretty likely now that you described it. 
---
Orc or bust. 
---
Sorry, you are just wrong. A new play would quit without addons 90% of the time. I know I did when I was a kid and could barely read the wall of quest texts they give you.
---
it always bugged me how the dwarfs never say "its off to work we go" as a second verse, they just say Heigh ho, heigh ho! like singing the first half of a song and then giving up
---
"We need to talk to your raid leader about accepting more shadow priests"
---
Not sure about vanilla, but for TBC-WoD the DR lasted between 15 and 20 seconds. The server processed it in batches so it didn't get immediately reset after 15s but instead on the next batch tick after 15s had passed. I'm guessing vanilla had the same system. 
---
2) According to the addon DRData-1.0, Charge &amp; Cheap Shot only shares DR with itself. Stuns from procs does not seem to DR (see vanilla 1.9.0 changelogs) Very short stuns (&lt;= 2s, e.g Pounce) usually doesn't DR or only DRs with itself. All other stuns are on the controlled stun category and causes DR. (Be warned that data from DRData is from patch 3.0.1, but they seem to match.)
---
I feel ya dude. I had been playing since Nov 2005 and didn't take a break till sometime in early Cataclysm. That's when I felt the game was truly deviating from what it originally was. Of course, I kept coming back every expansion because of Blizzards promises and hype. I should have quit way back then. But like you said, it's hard to quit something that has given you such emotions, and powerful ones at that. Honestly though, I just can't justify giving $15 a month to a company which is destroying a game I love. I will probably never play Retail again and will stay unsubbed till Classic.
---
in this video Tips goes through data for all dps classes in naxx, and concludes mages are still superior.
---
Oh yeah I saw that video too but I heard that data is a bit misleading because it applies to only 1 mage who have ignite. 
---
If I invest now I'm saying I agree with their shit. Even if I could make money it would make me no better than them. 
---
There is just potential for no open testing and I was trying to demonstrate why.  I cannot comment on blizzards procedural practices, 
---
&gt;It's certainly possible for one guild to gather all the mats before aq is released.
---
no arguing, but is it really? dont you need almost a million of several different items? totalling many many million mats? i remember on the big private server of 1-2 years ago it took quite some time for it to open ,even with some extremely hardcore nolife guilds there
---
I do too but I haven’t heard of them ever responding to something here or acknowledging their presence here :/
---
No. The orbs dropped there which were needed to enchant crusader. The formula itself didnt.
---
A good nameplate add-on.
---
Currently if you "hold" right-click a nameplate, while trying to turn your character, your mouse just slips off, and you won't turn. It's really freaking annoying.
---
I've only seen one add-on kinda solve it, by making nameplates entirely click-through, which means you can't click them at all.
---
You had to click twice to do that
---
Be more careful
---
Ran MC a billion times and our raid leader never had an issue
---
How do you know it won't be a problem in Classic WoW ? Servers do have a cost, and even if this is an 'already finished game', porting it to Bnet also has a cost. 
---
Yeah maybe Classic WoW will make money, but if it doesn't, how can you be so sure that the higher-ups won't decide to either stop it or change it ?
---
What OP is trying to say is that labelling WoW Classic as a "passion project" is utterly irrelevant, as others "passion projects" have already been shut down because they didn't make enough money.
---
Devs have no decision power, and that's not because "activi$$ion" or any other meme, it's just a reality of the business. So it's really cute to come and say that "this is a passion project", but in the end it's a lie because if your passion project doesn't make any profit, it's going to be shut down as any other project...
---
Totems that affect allies only buff you and those in your party. They do not affect other raid members or those not in your party.
---
That said though the most useful totem for savin someone is earthbind so it doesnt matter too much.
---
That's a common fallacy, but not true.
---
Think you're confused there guy. Forsaken are easily the best race.
---
you must of been a pretty dumb kid then
---
Exactly.
---
I’m all for toning down overreaction but this is a legit concern.
---
Their blog post basically says this system is in place for Classic. 
---
Loot sharing will totally fuck the dungeon runs from 1-60
---
Shuffling loot is not my biggest concern if I'm being honest.
---
In reality, my biggest "fear" is the possibility of the right click report abuse. 5 consecutive reports is a really low number (assuming it's correct) to give someone a temp ban; especially in a game like classic where that could make or break something like a rank 14 grind or, for someone who's in a situation like me, limited time to play could literally stop me from playing for an entire evening.
---
I doubt they will 
---
No one from Blizzard has ever posted to this sub
---
They aren’t hearing from the players how we feel about the loot issue 
---
Raised to aq40 on a dwarf hunter on tarren mill but sure.
---
Considering I'm 20, and was literally 6 when Vanilla was released, I think that makes me pretty smart? 
---
None of this changes the fact that most PLAYERS can agree this solution is a bad one and we’re better off being told “Blizzard won’t intervene”
---
&gt; I mean shit I was asleep/at school during the entire event on my server. 
---
That's quite unlucky :/ 
---
&gt;I think you’re vastly overestimating the number of people who get it
---
Maybe I do.
---
I can understand that concern, but there is no way your gaming will be interrupted without an investigation and a reasoning as to why.  They will verify any abuse that gets reported before taking action.  If they didn't there would also be a lot of understandably upset customers and they know this.
---
And 67% of statistics are made up... You can easily quest to 60 as a new player without add-ons. The fact that you quit as a kid because reading quest text was hard isn't a convincing argument.
---
No it's not possible at all for the exact reason you just mentioned but people like to sensationalize everything now a days. 
---
I haven't seen any evidence that it was notoriously abused. 
---
Great article, the explanation of sharding tells exactly why I quit playing, I am alone in a sea of strangers, in a world where its unlikely that I'll ever meet the same person twice.
---
I didn't realize it when I quit, but a big reason was definitely the feeling of not recognizing anyone anymore.
---
Arguably one of the few OBJECTIVE article on why "modern" WoW basically sux.
---
Okay, tell me 1 reason why relying on a 3rd party website like Thottbott to tell you exactly what to do is a more optimal experience for a new player than using an addon that tells you what to do. Pretty sure it's impossible to name 1 without insane bias/rose tinted goggles. 
---
The sky is falling, the sky is falling! 
---
ouch my feels
---
I'm sad now
---
That's nice?
---
Found the guy who doesn't understand how businesses work. 
---
I did exactly this in vanilla and can confirm. Really solid choice.
---
It's not, I don't know what this guy is smoking lol
---
Do you want to be a healthstone vending machine or water vending machine?
---
I am pretty sure activision blizzard can afford to hire a few gm's.
---
How is it an exaggeration if you literally go on to say that you need to use websites, ask strangers, or give up if you get stuck on a quest? Circle jerk on this sub is strong.
---
Never tried it, but I suspect lvl 29 mages can be really good. Most of the essential talents and spells for that class are reachable by lvl 29. 
---
That can of course be negated by other classes being even stronger. But as far as early power-bumps go that's probably it for mages. 
---
10 Holy Paladins, 3 Protection Paladins, 27 Ret Paladins. GG EZ
---
&gt;I still think that development would be more expensive
---
It might be semantics but I think his point was specifically about the cost of RUNNING an mmo, not the entire design/development/release process.
---
New players don't know about add ons and new players don't quit at a 90% rate, so it's pretty obvious that your statistic is bullshit. But you're more interested in bullshit than the facts, aren't you? 
---
A Resto Shaman is a bit more difficult to play in regards to World PvP, unless you're in a rather large group. I would recommend going 30/0/21 at 60 to get a lot of boost to Elemental spells while also getting some decent Restoration coverage and the great stuff like Nature's Swiftness and Lightning Mastery. This spec would allow for good burst DPS or decent heals, making decent solo/group play.
---
As for totems, group members always love a Shaman that knows how to use their totems effectively. When fighting certain classes, totems can bring them to their knees.
---
Warlock, Priest, Warrior - Tremor Totem removes party Fears
---
Enemy caster class - Grounding Totem can absorb a spell, Earth Shock can interrupt
---
Enemy melee class - Earthbind Totem and Frost Shock are great for kiting
---
Rogue/Hunter poisons - Poison Cleansing totem can dispel poisons for the party
---
And friendly melee classes love a good Windfury totem!
---
I literally did in my comment. Having an arrow or your map littered with random shit is really distracting, especially as a new player. Going to thottbott is as non-immersive as having youtube music on in the background, or a podcast. It's 3rd party, as in, not in the game, so the game itself, when youre tabbed into it, is uncluttered and fucked up. Also, as I said, addons in your game are always there, a tab out here and there, or asking general chat, is way less in your face. And if you really don't want to search for where to go? Don't do the quest. 
---
It's cool if you want to play with addons, but I genuinely think it's hilarious you quit because you couldn't read the "wall of text" quests. Also, "optimal"? If your goal is to hit 60 as *optimally* as possible, then have at it, but for most people, optimization isn't as fun, spoonfeeding isn't as fun. 
---
Say you are playing with a friend of same class of you:
---
You have the item already, but you need on it and trade it to your friend. Does anyone suspect? No, none checks if people actually need the gear, as long as the class makes sense, then fair enough
---
I was 7 myself, got to 55 before BC hit in my limited time. That doesn't make me smart and I'd be silly to think that.
---
So you're saying that if you're 6 years old then you need an add on to do quests. But if you don't have toddler level reading skills then it should be fine.
---
Yeah sounds about right. Now my only question is why would you think that op has toddler level reading skills? 
---
I never really twinked. I did have a good experience on my rogue in the 40-49 bracket. I wasn't even maxxed out &amp; was one shotting clothies.
---
I remember something like this for PvP. I believe it was called Book of the Dead but I've not since been able to find anything on it. Maybe I was dreaming. I loved it for PvP. It kept statistics about people who killed you, people you killed, you could arrange by class, race, etc. if I'm remembering right. It was really fun. It made it easy to learn who specifically was your arch enemy. It would also be great to be able to add short notes next to people's names and options to only record certain things so your book isn't massively spammed.
---
I didn't say to use a 3rd party website, and no one is arguing that an add-on wouldn't be optimal. I'm arguing against your point that 90% of new players would quit without using a questing add-on.
---
So I guess the most modern while group loot was still a thing 
---
Me honk too
---
For sure, I'm sure they are working hard on it, and there is a possibility that there is a decent spread of testers already, but I'm just pointing out that I think it's *unlikely* given Blizz's usual practices, taken with a grain of salt, given that im... well, not in Blizzard :(
---
Given that his quest rewards are the level 6 BiS for most classes, any serious raiding guild should prioritize bringing him down asap. My guess is within the first 30 minutes of launch.
---
Damn, I was hoping things like Stoneskin would work. No worries though, thanks for your answer 🙂
---
People like that will need on it anyway to share or vendor it.  That's just ninjaing.  People that were interested in the gear will notice and shame him so that others won't group.  If you're a ninja, you're a ninja.
---
It's like how Guild Wars would tell you: *Hey, I think you should take a break, just letting you know, you've been playing for 2 hours straight.*
---
Instead, early WoW skips the gentle nudge and just boots you out. 
---
I finally uninstalled retail yesterday. It feels good knowing I’m not gonna waste another $15 to be disappointed again 
---
Hey man. What you said about every grind being mandatory in a sense, and that none of them stands out is so true. Back in WoD I didn’t Raid, (work and school got in the way sadly) I didn’t PvP. But what I did was grinding. I grinded Apexis Crystals, I grinded the Garrison and I grinded the Reputations. I logged on, went to Gorgrond and killed every mob I saw for 3 rep each, all day and I eventually hit Exalted. I hit exalted with every single rep in that expac, I solo’ed the Sabrestalkers too. It felt great.
---
Also your WPvP point was spot on. What happened to the likes of Wintergrasp? Or Tol Barad? Those were fun!
---
Good read. 😊
---
The big difference between retail and classic in my eyes is the cross server queuing/grouping. In WoW today you don’t meet people anymore. Those organic situations on a players realm no longer take place. That’s what WoW was. The connection between one another and that’s why I believe the community will make classic feel like it once was.
---
Classic and a few expansion after that, servers had identities.  People met people. Guilds knew other fellow guilds on their server. You remember that one player you played with a week prior and a organic relationship sometimes seem to emerge from it. That was and is the magic of vanilla. I truely believe it was the communities interaction with one another that brought that experience over the top. 
---
The problem now I believe is WoW has a hard time bringing us together but instead focuses on convenience then social interaction. Instead you que and leave. 
---
Again, the community will make classic feel like classic as long as server identity exists. 
---
So your advice for a potential new player is to not use addons? That's pretty fucking dumb sir. Also ty for harping on an obviously over exaggerated statistic, really shows how sharp you are.
---
Back in the day when I was still playing the current version of WoW, I used a program called WoWMatrix. It worked great, and also had a library of new addons you could try, all through the little interface.
---
Based on vanilla wow. What kind of question is that? 
---
The game is very old so we know all of the weapons in that are in the game.
---
Then you won't be affected by this at all. I don't understand what the hang up is here with people being able to correct a loot mistake or how that cheapens Vanilla somehow.
---
Any semi hardcore NA guilds that will be raiding later at night, like 9:00 p.m. PST. Prefer horde but willing to play alliance too if I can find a good community. 
---
I raided as a mage in Vanilla. Cleared MC, BWL, AQ 20/40, ZG, and Naxx, cleared spider, abom, plauge, and 2/3 DK wing. 
---
In TBC I played mage again for the first raid tier, then switched to prot warrior and was OT for my guild through TK, SSC, BT, Hyjal. For Sunwell I switched over to resto druid and killed Mu'ru (fuck this guy) pre 3.0 and KT after. Class switches were at the request of the guild due to our needs not me just class jumping. 
---
Went super casual in WoTLK and just pvp'd/arena'd while pugging around for raids. Quit early into the expansion and also did not play during cataclysm and mists. Came back at the tail end of WoD and cleared up to Mythic Archimonde playing mage. 
---
Played in Legion and raided in a top U.S. 100 guild as a healing priest. Cleared mythic EN and TV. Cleared 9/10 mythic Nighthold. I quit when my daughter was born and my guild killed Gul'dan the week after. 
---
And now I am here, no interest to play retail from everything I have been reading but fully pumped to play Classic. But between work and family time, I can only play late night. I do not know what class I will play, I am tossing around mage for nostalgia but would not mind going priest heals or war tank. 
---
i think you underestimate how expensive CRS is.  3 shifts at around 10-15 bucks an hour everyday all year. The only way to cut it down is to add more technology or lose customers. 
---
Yeah, people tend to leave you alone, also you are an absolute God to have in world PvP groups with dispells, heals and fear. This tends to get you invited often.
---
Ya this is great if you have a soul bag and want to finish kill mobs with drain soul but not fill up more bags, however, if you want to have the soul shard collected to go to a certain bag....well there seems to be no answer.
---
If you have GMs then they can easily fix the loot issue.
---
you said "you basically need to have memorized the quests if you actually plan to do them without addons"
---
that is not true of 90% of quests, so I said you were exaggerating.  yes, there are those weird quests that give you vague directions or none at all, but in those cases I can quickly find an answer within 30 seconds of alt-tabbing to my browser.
---
Wat Do?!
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic
---
you should read this.
---
Engineering and mining is the only option - I don't think any other class is as pigeon holed into those two profs as the Hunter, unless you have someone willing to craft ammo consistently for you.  You will go through a lot of ammo.
---
Crafted ammo is the only way to go, unless you want to buy AV arrows with 1 less DPS for 60s a pop.
---
I am going skinning and tailoring currently. The skinning eats up some room but with vendoring everything adds up to a decent chunk of gold. The tailoring is fairly passive, when you loot linen, turn it into bolts...free levels and open bag space.
---
For a new server plan to vendor a lot of the collected mats, especially at low levels. I found herbs didn't sell for much in comparison to skinning.
---
"there is no way your gaming will be interrupted without an investigation" that is LITERALLY what they are doing on retail.
---
And costumers are upset. But who cares 
---
It's not semantics, it's a fair point. What would be semantics is me arguing that development/design/release process is part of running an MMO....but Classic WoW as of now is not a regular MMO, thus there aren't plans to develop/design/release anything outside of what existed in Vanilla so as it stands, customer service would be the most expensive part of Classic post launch. 
---
I quit right after Draenor launched. Most of the problems i'll describe below started way earlier than that, but i stuck around for some reason. Now it's just a sad, short and dull theme part attraction of a game instead of an rpg.
---
Instead of getting exciting items like that great rare blue or even epic item from an instance, you get +1 items to your two or three stats for free. Remember when your BiS wasn't automatically the one that simply had the highest ilvl? Remember when you carried around some resist gear or extra willpower gear? Remember when you could actually work towards good crafted gear? Blizzard forgot a long time ago and so did players. Just gotta get that +1 from everywhere and don't even think about your gear nowadays.
---
Instead of playing with people you've socialized with for years, you press a button and do everything on autopilot without ever talking to people. Even outside of instances, there's no point due to phasing, cross realm instances and so on.
---
I liked talents and having a fuck ton of skills and skill levels. That progression and choice of the old talent tree + skill progression felt rewarding and fun. I don't care that apparently most used a cookie cutter spec and most of the skills were highly situational or even useless. It was part of that class and i liked it that way.

On that note, it feels like every class can do everything now. Sure, some classes are better at tanking or healing in some situations, but does it matter? I liked it when you had multiple characters that were skilled and geared for one job and actually switching felt like something you had to put thought into. Now you just click a button and a lot of classes can do every role.
---
Nobody expected "it's a passion project" to be a cure for paying bills. I didn't even mention it, actually. I pointed out that Hots died because nobody played it. Classic WoW has a lot of hype behind it and so I see no reason to worry about shutdowns or meddling. 
---
Which loot system did they choose? The one where you can only trade greeded loot or the one where you can traded needed loot as well? 
---
Your writing made me nostalgic all over again. Classic questing was like exploring a world on your own and the changes you listed in modern WoW turned it into going into a theme park where you go exactly where and do exactly what the owner (Blizzard) tells you to go and do. 
---
In other words; you need help in order to quest in WoW
---
My server was a relief server for Blackrock, Illidan, and Warsong. Still stayed low pop despite offered xfers from some of Vanilla's highest pop marquee pvp servers. 
---
Only relevant guilds were transfer guilds. I felt bad for them. They had no clue they had moved to a slum.
---
question is - dwarf male or female?
---
I had a 19 Priest, they are hard to kill and tend to counter hunters/rogues.  
---
Sorry but I disagree and I think you are belittling how badly the issue can be abused. 
---
I'm just speaking anecdotally, but it seems like most of the fans of Classic WoW are okay with no loot support as long as that means there won't be loot trading.
---
I'd love to see a poll.
---
Big if true
---
This might take the award for the most unbelievable thing I've heard on Reddit. Do you have proof of that? I can't imagine a 7 year old spending ~300 hours sitting in front of a desktop playing WoW and not getting bored, getting stuck, or having the skill to quest through the entirety of Vanilla WoW.
---
it's the most active classic WoW forum and the CMs have been known to post here.  
---
There is a huge difference between "once in a while you won't be able to figure out where a quest objective is based on quest text" and "you cannot do quests without addons (unless you have them memorized)".  That's exactly what "exaggerating" is.  
---
It's either going to be 8/13 or 8/20. Putting my chips down.
---
You just said it looks fun, I don't understand why there's a question.
---
Even funnier when you realize they've been saying over and over again that this is new code made to look old.
---
Only us redditors have made that distinction. No one from Blizz has confirmed there will be any different treatment for Needed vs Greeded loot.
---
At this point it appears all loot regardless of need or greed will be tradeable.
---
This system will have a big impact on dungeon runs from 1-60
---
Raids its much less of an issue
---
I call that a successful gank.
---
A lot of well written points there that I also hold
---
&gt;Challenge will never come looking for you; you have to seek it out yourself. Something which is directly in conflict with human nature as we will always take the path of least resistance.
---
This guy really seems to get it.
---
Well, I wasn't nervous (or even aware of, since I don't play retail) about this until someone xposted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard_has_dropped_the_ball_on_the_new_report/) from r/wow. Here's a quote. 
---
&gt;With the new system, it only takes 5 players total to report a player and automatically have them flagged. This will disconnect them, automatically forcing a silence or ban on them without the involvement of a gm. Obviously, this can be abused by those with grudges in the game.
---
Again, according to the retail players it only takes 5 reports before an auto-ban/silence is put into effect. The silence also takes an appeal before it's lifted provided the below quote is still valid. 
---
&gt;It also worked like this last expansion too. I pretty much never talk in public channels on the highest pop realms anymore just as a precaution. If you get silenced, you're essentially guilty until proven innocent, as a review isn't done unless you appeal it, and even then you're playing a bit of GM Roulette as their stances can vary on what constitutes a silence. (Disclaimer: This information is old and policies might have been solidified since Legion). The silence is also account-wide, and for the life of the entire battle.net account, so it'll keep doubling.
---
Seeing how Classic really reinforces you to interact with and make friends with other players this could easily get out of hand as people will just ask their friends in classic to report some for any reason and bam, you have someone hit with a silence or autoban or whatever. 
---
If you think about it classic is exactly like a private server. Every server has its own unique set of bugs. I could name a handful specific to nostalrius for example. Classic will be no different in that respect. However blizzard has paid developers and access to the original game code so obviously all of that will get fixed so it's not really worth mentioning.
---
Personally I think that is wrong, simply because that is not how loot trading is handled in retail today (Greed loot can be traded, Need cannot). The other option seems like it brings so much potential abuse alongside it. But you're right, just speculation. 
---
Aside from loads of players admitting and talking about how terrible it was, both in this sub and on the Blizz forum?
---
Regardless of evidence, it’s simple fact that this new system adds more incentives to ninja loot and gives power to groups of solo players.
---
Never mind the fact that it’s flat out not Classic.
---
It’s just a bad call on Blizz part.
---
I’d love for that distinction. But Blizz hasn’t said a thing other than “soulbound loot will be tradeable”
---
No point worrying about things out of your control - pick a realm and get to it.
---
There are always people who complain they have been banned from whatever for no reason. Usually the organisation who did the ban doesn't answer to the allegations, so many people are willing for some reason to just believe the banned person.
---
In 99 out of 100 cases where they do respond it turns out that the banned person was not as innocent as they proclaimed to be.
---
I really don't see the motive for companies banning players for no reason. Sure, mistakes happen and some bans target way too many people, but no company is interested in banning more costumers than is absolutely necessary. *Especially* in this case with the subscription model.
---
Believe it or not, I've actually played Vanilla WoW again when I was not 6 years old, and realized that the quest text is for the most part very poorly written and that questing is very hard and not enjoyable without the use of external sources. I find it ironic how this sub promotes Joana's guides constantly but finds the use of questing addons to be disgusting. Elitism at its finest. 
---
Why is everyone calling modern Wow retail? Classic wow is also retail. Retail just means it's a sold product, and the term comes from private server communities who would play wow for free. 
---
Pulling the bosses 
---
I mean, 90% is a completely arbitrary number I made up, so I guess you got me. nice work
---
Wait. Don’t we still have to pay a sub to play classic? How can they “not afford” to pay GM’s? I know it’s just a meme but still. 
---
That's cool and all, but I'm trying to give advice to a new player like OP based on when he told us. I'm not giving advice to you, I know nothing about you.
---
I’d put money on it that they will make “community ambassadors” GM’s and cause a whole we level of chaos
---
This article hit all the points. Im only havig fin doing M+ or raiding. I hate how the rest of the game is for the lowest common denominator. 
---
We'll see though. Maybe they will require the most current expansion to have access to Classic.
---
Wow, that sounds like a fucking awful experience.
---
Four hours, and you may not get what you want at all, even in a 5 man. *I wonder why Blizzard changed it?*
---
If you gave up on every dead end you came across while questing you'd be pretty fucked when it comes to leveling. I have to disagree with what you are saying based on the way quest lines and experience gating works in WoW.
---
You guys are absolutely amazing and just feeding my love for Shamans. Loving the fantastic content! 
---
As a side note/question, I can't remember if this was covered in your previous videos, but what race do you choose to roll as a Shaman? I'm still in limbo and looking for some feedback.
---
&gt; \[...\] you question how on earth World of Warcraft is the worlds most popular MMORPG
---
Because of aesthetics. However, I hope Shadowbringers will finally succeed WoW in terms of active subscribers.
---
Also, it is currently the only retail version that exists. Will probably change when classic comes out
---
Anecdotal here, I just started for the first time in a private server, am level 30. No I don't need add-ons, I love questing, get a grip. Just finished the ones in Wetlands and Duskwood, very memorable.
---
Tanking in Vanilla is based on TPS. Suncore is better than TF for that. Have you ever tank in Vanilla ? Or even played wow Vanilla ? 
---
Let me guest, you have start  wow with wotlk ?
---
Thanks, glad you enjoyed it man:-)
---
Nah
---
Thanks man, glad you agree:-)!
---
This article hits the nail right in the head... This is exactly what I think is wrong with the game, the lack of need to group with people to kill a quest boss for example which build me friendships back then and that gave me the sense of having a strong community, the gear progression, the lack of unique and iconic items, everything is on point there.
---
It really comes down to personal preference. However, I believe troll is best for endgame healing due to berserking and orc is best for endgame enhancement PvP because of stun resistance and blood fury while tauren are best for tanking (endurance) and caster/healing PvP because of warstomp which is super nice to get a heal on yourself in a pinch. But again, play what you want! And thank you for your support!!
---
They could hire 36 people for 8 hours a day, for 10 years straight.
---
Anecdotal evidence doesn't mean jack shit so thanks for admitting that you have nothing. 
---
When I said "addons" I meant external help in general, if you leveled to 30 all by yourself, good on you, but I think the majority of new players wouldn't find that fun. 
---
Thanks for proving you have no reading comprehension skills either. 
---
You're technically right in that they're both going to be "retail", but you won't go to a store and see a box with "WoW Classic" discs inside it. The product they will advertise and have on store shelves will always be the latest version of the game. So the retail game will be the newest expansion content, with Classic being the bolt-on you get for free when you subscribe to retail. It's semantics, but I don't see why the terminology has to change. 
---
I was a hunter with full tier 2 and x-bow from chromagus with TF and chromatic tempered sword. Never gonna feel that uniqe anymore 😅.
---
Surv spec is only for MC when you're too lazy to actually get 9% hit and want to grab 3% hit if you're raiding with it. 
---
Frost trap is useful in *maybe* 1 fight per tier too since 99% of raid mobs are immune to slows and the few that aren't are rarely needed to be aoe slowed by a hunter out of all things. 
---
The only mobs you'd want to slow are sons after submerge on Rag (and you shouldn't even get submerge if your DPS is decent), P1 adds on Nef, Spider trash in ZG and the adds that spawn from the 3 AQ40 warrior trash packs, and practically every of these situations you'd have a tank sitting on top of the mob.
---
It's an issue in dungeons more than anything, and even then it's pretty rare to frost trap in dungeons.
---
It's also completely broken in PVP, which is mostly the point of putting points in surv.
---
No one said they are disgusting, just that you are a fucking retard if you can't figure out most quests without it. Thanks for playing though, shit for brains. 
---
Agreed. Part of what made the game wonderful was the sense of community. Your reputation among other players is a big part of that.
---
If someone is a dickbag when it comes to loot, other players on that server learn to not trust that player, they no longer get invites to content, and the problem fixes itself.
---
I'm not well versed on emulation, especially the specifics of WoW private server clients, so bear in mind that I might not be giving the best answer here.
---
Converting the game to run on the modern client means that your computer will treat it pretty much the same as modern games, where the graphics and game logic are all running natively on your computer. 
---
Emulation often uses what's called a compatibility layer, meaning converting incompatible logic and graphics libraries into something your computer can use, all on-the-fly while the game is running.
---
The lightpost "issue" is rooted in how the client treats missing data.
---
In the old days a missing texture like that would just show up as white. Presumable to make it subtle, so you can go with the old "if no one notices, it probably isn't an issue that needs to be fixed and therefore no one noticed the light posts missing a texture.
---
However at a certain point, the color of missing textures was changed to make sure people noticed when they were missing and as such things that hadn't been an issue before became an issue.
---
This is easy, I just won't talk to anyone in game. Not like we're on an adventure or anything right?
---
Not in the beginning but towards the end yes.
---
On-top on this, you can also watch the Blizzcon classic panel where they try to explain the process to the viewers.
---
Awesome, thanks for the input.
---
Hunters are absolutely necessary in raids, and with gear you can compete somewhat with locks and mages.  
---
Hunters are needed to kite bosses, lay frost traps, pull groups of mobs, give aura buffs, and tranquility shot.
---
Also hunters are a great farming class with dire mail north, as well as one of the best if not the best wpvp class.
---
Labour costs are very high, and there's really no way around that.
---
&gt; For example, they could have customers work as GM's for a reduction of their subscription
---
Sure, but how do you train them? How do you make it rewarding? How do you prevent abuse? Who oversees them? And what do you do if they suck at being GM?
---
&gt; [hire]  work from home GM's around the country
---
Working for home isn't usually much cheaper for the company, the disadvantages balance out over the advantages. For training and supervision, it's usually way easier to have people be in the office at least one day of the week.
---
In the end, an hour of costumer support will cost the company some amount of money - let's say $50. That's not what only what the person gets paid, but also all the other associated costs. That means that a customer who interacts with support for more than a quarter of an hour costs as much as the monthly subscription. Even if you halve that $50, it comes out to just seven minutes a week to match the subscription price. 
---
And that's discounting all other costs. The $13 also have to account for development, taxes, servers, managers' yachts and sex parties, advertisement -- and profit.
---
Agreed. This article is concise, not hyperbolic, and hits the major points.
---
Classic=/=vanilla. 
---
Otherwise they'd be calling it that. 
---
A Hunter can do decent DPS at MC/BWL, but it requires a lot of skill learning a fairly complex mechanic compared to say, Rogues who simply need to have Slice n Dice up and dump rest of their combos in Evis.
---
A mediocre Hunter wont even crack the top 15 dps.
---
Later in the game, in AQ40 and Naxx, they simply do not scale well with their gear, and clothies such as Mages and Warlocks and of course Warriors simply top the charts.
---
In BGs Hunters are very good, and have a easy time raking up kills. They are great for making gold by doing certain solo instances. These two roles are what i would say Hunters excel at. Kills in BGs and making gold with little effort.
---
19 - Hunter, Priest
---
29 - Hunter, Rogue
---
39 - Hunter, Warlock
---
49 - Hunter, Warrior
---
I think you just don't understand the context of our conversation, I know it's been an hour or so and you probably have an old man brain so let me break it down for you. OP wants to know if he should play vanilla wow if he's a fan of OSRS, I said that he should, but should consider using a questing addon as I believe that it would be the most enjoyable experience for a new player. Your response was that "New players don't know about addons", which I took to mean "Hey OP is too stupid to use addons, a better solution is to not use addons" (which I still think is very heavily implied in your message) to which I responded "You think new players shouldn't use addons? Hey that's pretty fucking stupid" and now you are saying I have no reading comprehension skills because you were actually arguing a 90% "Statistic" that is clearly pulled out of my ass. We got a genius on our hands.
---
But its a different environment. Sure people needing on shit and giving it to their friends sucks but in classic there won't be dungeon finder. If people do that blast their ass in lfg and make it difficult for them to group up. Either they continue until they get to the point that they can't find a group at all or they stop.
---
Hunters get brought to raids for kiting/pulling/tranq/trueshot. There will usually be 2-3 per raid. Those spots are highly contested, so if you want to raid consistently and be valued as a member you need to be on your game, bringing consumables, having all your enchants, be engineering, know the fights, etc.
---
PvP hunters are strong but not top tier. They are amazing and arguably one of the best at WPvP, and are great in 1v1s. You should be able to wing clip/intimidate as a BM hunter, if you are getting screwed by ganks that aren't a) someone 5+ levels above you b) a twink c) multiple people, you're doing something wrong. Hunters are amazing at getting away with aspect of the cheetah/freeze trap/wing clip/conc shot. Learn to kite, use a fast attack speed pet or a boar with stun, make the first move vs. people who you think are going to gank you, have track humanoids on in contested areas.
---
"Why ninja looting can be a good thing"
---
Which dead server were you playing on with only 2 hour queues?
---
What are your goals? Topping the charts? World pvp? Rank 14? Or just casual play. You'll get a different answer depending on what exactly you want to do with your time. 
---
A good hunter will do amazing dps at the start of MC, then slowly fall off till AQ where they're useful but in the bottom tier of dps. Regardless, there will always be hunter spots in raids so as long as you put in a little bit of research and don't give a shit about being #1 on the charts, you'll have a good time raiding.
---
You can also make a shit ton of gold from soloing dungeons like mara and DM N if you're into solo play. If you hit 60 early enough, you can start selling drops from Princess in Mara (usually 10g for the ring drop, this value might change in classic who knows).
---
They're also great in all forms of pvp (borderline faceroll in any wpvp or pug environment). If someone doesn't know the matchup well you will win most of the time. Also viper sting is annoying as shit for a lot of classes to deal with. 
---
So yeah, hunters are totally viable in pretty much all cases. Just depends what you're looking to accomplish.
---
Grinding gold.
---
I realized Blizz/Acti was shooting for lowest common denominator back when the 3.0 pre-patch for Wotlk dropped. (Noticed it with 2.0 as well but I was more excited about the power creep then than I was with 3.0.) Content that my guild had been struggling with (Last few bosses in BT and last boss of Hyjal) became a complete joke and we steamrolled through both. Other guild members were overjoyed to have their shiny new epics from the big bads but for me the experience had been cheapened and those victories were hollow. I quit a few weeks later partially due to burnout and falling out with irl friends. Re-subbed to WoD for a month until it boiled down to a glorified Facebook game and I've been playing private vanilla servers since. 
---
I'd rather suffer mistakes assigning loot and bugs than have these two awful systems in place.
---
You really couldn't continue to prove my point better if you tried.
---
Thanks again buddy! 
---
Quite well. I don't recall how I got the gold for it, but me and an ingame friend would slow-ride all the way from Darnassus to Stormwind right after I got it. If I recall correctly, we did get it at the same time.
---
&gt; What is the difference between emulation and down porting?
---
All the security measures implemented in the past fifteen years, for starters.
---
Do you have downvote bots following you? I wonder what a pleasant person like you did to deserve them. 
---
Engineering is mandatory at 60 for hunters imo. Then it depends which farming methods are available. You could be a miner or you could solo farm tribute and buy your ore. You could desenchant your tribute loot or farm herbs for gold or consumables. I could recommend BS once you have enough gold if you want to tryhard PvP, geared SP and locks will give you the more troubles so the trinket is nice. 
---
I love when people try to argue anecdotal evidence is useless when it’s literally the only thing that matters here. This is the sub for players of the game, none of us have internal Blizz data. We’re making clear concise arguments that you dismiss with the wave of a hand because there’s not 5 peer reviewed papers in it.
---
All you’re doing is criticizing in a non-constructive way. 
---
Why not add something to the conversation? What’s your suggestion?
---
Dwarf pally says hello
---
Yeah those addons that do all the work for you are hugely against the spirit of vanilla wow. Immersion is completely gone and you remember nothing but following the arrow. 
---
This is too big a topic to give a precise answer in a few short sentences. I'll just note a few things.
---
What Wow server "emulation" does is recreating the *functionality* of the original Blizzard servers. (In this case Vanilla servers.) This recreation must be good enough that the client can function, players can play the game and other server functions can be done (like creating user accounts). This is hard, it took a lot of time and work. Emulated server writing started when WoW was in the alpha state and haven't stopped since. And it wasn't a "small team of individuals" it was a massive effort of a lot of people over the years.
---
Also, that's the server only. The client which people use is the original Blizzard client. The client draws all graphics and animation, plays the music and sounds, handles user input, etc. The server works out where stuff are and what they are doing. (Like where is a monster, how many health it has and if it is moving or attacking or casting a spell.)
---
It's debatable if writing the client or the server is harder. In any case as said private servers only emulate the server, not the client.
---
What Blizzard is doing is taking their own existing client *and* server both their current and the original 1.12 Vanilla and recreating the Vanilla version while keeping those advances which make sense (all the bug fixes, improvements to networking, hack and cheat protection, Battle.net integration, updated graphics options like shadows and water, etc.)
---
People working for Blizzard are not amateurs. They can handle light posts or even 15K people. (15K people is not Vanilla, by the way, it is a shitshow on private servers in more than one way, if they wanted to Blizzard could handle it better than private servers. However that's not their goal.)
---
I don't see the difference between an addon like Questie (I don't know what arrow you are talking about, I have no idea what addon that is) and using thottbott except for elitism. Considering Questie was literally implemented into wow during WoTLK, I think it's pretty clearly in the spirit of WoW, just not the elitist paradise.
---
Online games like WoW have a server component, and a client component. The client is responsible for presenting the state of the game to the user, and for reporting the users actions to the server. Meanwhile the server is responsible for aggregating these reports from the clients, compute the result of the player's actions, and send back information of what happened.
---
So clients are just for user input and graphics, servers are for game logic.
---
Pservers use the old client, and try to make a server to reacts to the data packets it sends. It's mostly just reverse engineering, since the client doesn't know if the packet came from a Blizzard server, just if it's formatted correctly. For Blizzard, they're doing the exact same thing, except that they are making it fit what a newer client expects. Since they own everything, they don't need to reverse engineer this stuff, and can change it if they need to.
---
With regards to server performance, it has a lot to do with the actual game design of Vanilla vs BFA. There's a lot more AOE, faster cast rates, more effects, etc. in BFA, along with a much faster server tick rate. Server load per player is higher in BFA than in Vanilla, so naturally it can handle fewer players.
---
ELI5: Vanilla servers have less to do and more time to do it, so they have room for more players. BFA servers have more to do and less time to do it, so they have room for less players.
---
They wont.
---
Source: Blizzard.
---
&gt;Blizzard has said themselves they can’t afford GMs to handle loot issues like vanilla.
---
I never denied that. 
---
Yet no longer intervening still is not keeping things classic, contrary to what this meme post claims. 
---
This article is so well written!
---
I saw a lot of classic mage vids, vurtune and the like, but none of them one shot people with fireballs like this guy. What gives?
---
In AQ40 Twin Emps and Cthun are pretty tough, by Vanilla stamdards. At least 5 bosses in Naxx would be pretty hard with too many off specs, bad players, under geared or all of the above
---
Thanks man, appreciate it:-)
---
How many developers do you think WoW has? Maybe 50 or 100? Plus another fifty in QA and testing?
---
Now let's look at customer support. With, say, 5 million active subscriptions worldwide, and just one ticket per costumer and month, that's 5 million incidents a month. Let's say a CS rep can handle 15 tickets an hour (just 4 minutes avg. per ticket!). That's 416.000 hours of CS reps needed per month. That's 2,400 CS reps if we pretend they all work 40 hours a week all the time and work at 100% throughout their day.
---
I think my estimations are generous on the dev side and very conservative at the CS side, but even if I'm off by a factor of 10 CS will come out as more expensive than development.
---
Fact, not fallacy. I understand that you never played before it was introduced, but you don't have to make things up.
---
But spirit of wow and spirit of vanilla wow are two vastly different concepts. 
---
Yeah eventually modern wow adopted the quest arrow into the default UI, you don't know what arrow I'm talking about? Before that, there were quest addons that did the same thing.
---
Thank you for the detailed post 
---
I only remember going to Elwynn and purchasing everything after 5-10 minutes deliberating on color of the horse.
---
I think I went with the red-brown one.  I don’t recall, but I’m sure I was happy as a clam to finally have a mount like everyone else.
---
I like your writing style; lots of short, easy to digest paragraphs with relevant examples and images.
---
I remember doing the netherdrake grind...it really did feel like you were working towards something, and in the end it really wasn't something that everybody did.
---
Every well, actually one of the few things I achieved in Vanilla. I ran around Alterac Mountain for three days on my gnome Mage, Mining everything in sight and selling it in Trade chat. For reasons I’m still unsure of, I choose to spam trade over using the auction house, which lead to someone in trade telling me to put my ore on the AH or shove it up my ass, which caught me off guard. I think back on it now and it’s funny, but I really should have just used the AH.
---
I got a blue mechano-strider and still have that character to this day, sitting at 60 with shit green gear of the Eagle and my argent dawn commission trinket. I look forward to doing right by that character this time around.
---
...which you can actually opt out of, thanks to PvE realms.
---
PoM pyroblast
---
this video is dogshit since all the data is invalueable
---
exactly, hardly how it felt to get exalted with bfa reputations:P
---
I’d much prefer loot trading 
---
Exactly. This is the reason people want classic in the first place.
---
No it won’t
---
Just hop on a private server and play the class a bit instead of trying to learn how to play by reading wikis.
---
This gave me butterflies.
---
I never recommended a quest addon to op, I've never used one with an arrow. I just use questie, you can toggle it off and on easily, and it's pretty basic.
---
Yep just wanted to point it out since the post was asking how not to fuck up as a hunter, and healers getting killed by entrapment feels pretty bad. Like you said mainly an issue in 5 mans and 20 mans
---
Anyone else worried by how they seem to be giving super indirect answers when it comes to the 'changes' questions that are still unanswered? like surely they have decided 99% of them by now.
---
Yeah, but if they were smart. Happy gamers mean happy share holders
---
Activision Blizzard did 1.51 Billion dollars last quarter. Saying they can't staff GM's isn't exactly believable...
---
No problem.
---
I'd add that it's a small team working on Classic at Blizzard. Blizzard doesn't want to spend too much money on Classic, which is understandable, even though we might want it otherwise. :)
---
I expect Classic to work nicely, however I also expect that it'll have its own fair share of bugs. Hopefully they'll be fixed in a timely manner. :)
---
As a long time player of runescape and wow, I can say that the level of grind is very similar in both games. Just a much different game in terms of mechanics etc. But if you come from osrs, the long grind will be a very familiar feeling. 
---
While we're at it, I still have my 49 rogue twink on a dusty retail realm  somewhere so I can refer to her for gear, but is there a resource online that discusses BiS gear for each class/bracket? A lot of the old ones I visited once upon a time were shuttered.
---
Damn this is perfect
---
Hi, /u/Hrafnkellhugi
---
Well done article but it's still too soft on BFA and modern WoW. The creative and design leads should he ashamed of themselves. 90% of their efforts were spent on streamlining every bit of fun in order to make their jobs easier. The whole game is formulaic, time gated, and shallow. There is no way to seperate yourself from the crowd. There is NOTHING worth pursuing outside of the repetitive raids except another chance at an uninspired piece of loot that jumbles the same 4 stats around in slightly different ways. There is NO thought at all into assembling a set of gear. It's entirely down to doing one of the 5 things in the game blizzard allows rewards to come from (raids, bgs, scenario thingies once every two weeks, mythics, world quests) and seeing what random piece of gear pops put this time. 
---
There is not a single rep grind even remotely worth it and at every instance where they could offer something fun, they give you a battle per or toy. It's pure laziness, arrogance, and greed. Don't trust a single thing Blizzard says regarding modern WoW. It's either a lie to cover up their lazy design and implementation and testing, or a marketing ploy by someone who doesnt care about gameplay. 
---
I've never ranted about a game before like this and I knew the writing was on the wall since WoD, but jesus Blizzard. Your game is so fucking lazy, tame, and filled with inspired grinds. And you have the arrogance to get people to play your theme park of a game while it is filled with bugs and oversights like never before. Whoever is in charge of WoW now: fire every creative and save the WoW franchise for the long run. You will have a dead IP after your next expansion no exaggeration. 
---
Are forgetting the millions people are paying them monthly? Its more than reasonable to ask for GMs if they are going to collect a subscription cost.
---
DROP HEADMASTERS CHARGE ALREADY, AAAAAAAH
---
You make out your opinions to be facts, and half your facts are wrong, but I guess it fits this subs narrative.
---
Violet raptor I remember well.
---
But trading away my ivory raptor for the "cool new" armored raptor was pretty shitty considering the ivory is gone and the armored ones haven't been updated, nor are they special :(
---
You reminded me that "shaman" is actually the plural of "shaman"
---
In the context of the article  which is an "opinion piece" then the writers opinion is facts, whether or not you agree is the part that is up for debate
---
If it doesn't crash for the first couple of months it isn't vanilla
---
It’s def gonna be in. It’s a pvp-spec with a CD ”PoM” which combined with other CDs like trinkets could give you huge crits. Or your target resists and then u are just a sitting duck...
---
Pew pew’Ing and getting loot 
---
I think Gnomes are the greatest. Gnome warriors are best warriors, gnome mages are best mages, gnome rogues are very solid as well.
---
Gnomish NPCs are at their best in Vanilla. Mekkatorque, Thermaplugg, Shoni the Silent, Oglethorpe, Narain, Dr Weavil, Chromie (sortof)?
---
Gnomeregan is the most unique dungeon imo, with many models you don't see anywhere else. The station in Thousand Needles is iconic of vanilla.
---
Plus all the engineering gadgets look so good on you, all other races look dumb using/wearing them, and mechstriders look and feel way better than rams.
---
&gt; It certainly beats putting the Wotlk/Cata system in Classic. It was abused a lot by guilds/groups of 2-3 friends running dungeons. It will ruin Classic dungeon runs a lot of solo players.
---
Certainly was not my experience, at least for the time I still played (Wotlk). 
---
I don't believe it will ruin dungeons for solo players at all, unless you're assuming the overwhelming majority of the Classic community will be assholes anyway.
---
I know, I just read your original comment saying you *needed* addons to quest. Which in saying that, I assume you mean the one that points you in the direction you have to go. 
---
I don't know questie, maybe I do, but don't remember any addon names. I just remember the one I used a bit in TBC that had an arrow, and the map showed where the quest location is.
---
Everyone is just saying the quests are perfectly doable without an addon, and it's encouraged to do so without one because it takes away from the immersion. The average player will get more fulfillment exploring on their own, or have the excuse to have a positive interaction with the community.
---
None of that happens if you just let an addon do your work for you. It's detached gameplay. Sure its fine if you're in a rush and don't feel like being immersed, especially with the occasional quest that is obtuse, but overall the main draw of the game is exploring and player interactions. 
---
If you don't like the websites people use, then recommend people to have the addon, and only turn it on when they're stuck and no one helps. Fair compromise.
---
Also Arcane Power and any on use trinkets.
---
Priest Power Infusion if you can find a deep disc pvp preist that will give it to you.
---
My suggestion is that it's a trivial overblown issue with no hard evidence that it's even a problem. Whiners gonna whine. 
---
Keep digging that hole, you are really good at it. 
---
Yep but lets not pretend that unfair advantages that stem from having friends is a new thing to WoW, or is going to ruin anything. Half the people on this sub praise said mechanics.
---
What private servers have been getting this right? None of the popular ones for sure.
---
I believe he is coming from a pvp mindset. 
---
Hunters can solo DM North at 60 for one of the best vanilla gold grinds. You will require Engineering (blast charges) or Blacksmithing (keys) to open the last locked door though.
---
Why do you say that, do you need a certain amount of gear before trib is solo’able or is it possible straight off the bat at 60? What would your choices be?
---
So what? 
---
First of all, you still gain XP even if you're not rested. Secondly, the game has a lot more to offer than just filling a purple bar. 
---
So you're just going to troll? Welcome to my block list. Not going to waste further time on low IQ replies.
---
&gt; If Blizzard can't staff GM's to deal with loot issues, then it's not too crazy for them to say they won't intervene in loot issues.
---
It's not crazy even if they *could* staff more GMs.
---
Treat players as adults responsible for their actions and devote GMs to more serious issues like bugs, harassment, gold sellers, etc.
---
Mining + Eng or Skinning + LW (Dragon scale)
---
Well, if you’re going to hell you might as well be happy about it.
---
Pretty damn confident there are no quests that bleak in the game. But even in that case maybe someone needs the quest reward or is a little behind in XP so the group gets the quest done just for that person.
---
yep can’t wait to see the drama from HoJ/ironfoe runs in trade chat lmao
---
Can Hunter need on plate?
---
What makes you think I am trolling? How can you not see that a tool that removed interaction had a negative impact to the community? Are you sure you are not the actual troll?
---
Is exp gain able to turn off in Vanilla?
---
Yeah, that's the fall back point. The advantage of the guides over those is that they know where the chains take you and the level quests become available so you can time new areas/routes well. Saves a surprising amount of time.
---
IDK, comment history? Unless you'd believe I've been spinning an elaborate lie on this subreddit since Classic was announced. Went on to tank in BC heroics/kara when i was 10/11, which is more unbelievable imo. Was into Guild Wars 1 even, before I switched over to WoW sometime in later '05. 
---
Funny thing is, I shared the computer/account with 3 (later 4) other family members who also WoWed, all of them much more than me, so I didn't have a world of time, but still enough to level to 55 and wander around a bit too. 
---
As far as the skill point you mention... I played a hunter, so... thats not really part of the equation haha. I was probably around 8-9 days, which would be around 200 hrs over the year/year and a half I played Vanilla. In ~500 days, thats only around 25 minutes a day on average, though I did play a Warrior to 30 first, which, god, had to have been a handful of days too.
---
"prepare for classic by watching lots of videos, looking at lots of charts, and reading lots of opinions of classes."
---
You are doing it wrong.
---
If its do-able it should be pretty much do-able from pretty much from pre-raid bis on, better gear will speed up the fight and maybe let you squeeze in more resets an hour.
---
The question is if blizz will allow it it to be solo'd or not. Some private servers have added mechanics to make it harder to solo due  to either gold sellers abusing it to farm their gold or because it unfairly rewards hunters depending on who you ask.
---
Personally I've been engi/herbalism because herbs were overvalued on the server I played on. And because hunters make excellent herbers both in the open world and in dungeons. You can train mobs away from herbs with your pet and cheetah around when the spawns are close together.
---
www.classic.db
---
No point for a hunter to pull most of the time, no misdirect in Classic.
---
Our hunters pulled many many bosses into larger rooms for us, it was very hard to get started otherwise. Or at least it felt like that at the time. 
---
Hi, /u/arrogantarrogance
---
I loved the unexpected reunion of blockbuster employees in the comments lol
---
Click on the dungeon you're interested in here: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-dungeons-overview
---
They list all the bosses and what they drop within their descriptions of the dungeons. 
---
It doesn’t work. Doesn’t show loot tables.
---
Maybe there’s a different path to get there?
---
?
---
First time I played I was engrossed in this whole world I didn't know anything about besides from Warcraft RTS games. Made it feel like an adventure not knowing where to go or what was out there.
---
Thank you so much for the help! I'm definitely thinking Orc now.
---
I disagree that it is game breaking. I understand people’s concern but I am more concerned about them preserving the original leveling experience, class quests you had to complete to gain mounts, abilities, skills. I am even more concerned that they don’t prune abilities and spells, fake casting, and really having a sense that you belong to a community on a specific serverA.k.a. sharding. I think these are way more important for sense of community then loot sharing, but that’s just like my opinion….Man.
---
I believe by that point they had already leashed Kazzak to The Blasted Lands, so the Nightmare Dragons were similarly leashed to their grove. I vaguely remember we fought the one in The Hinterands and if you crossed the bridge that led to the grove you could escape him. The elite drakes that were around the tree could be kited, however.
---
classicdb.ch is probably what he was going for. 
---
Good read, you hit most of the things that were on my mind during the ~2 months I played BFA.
---
This is in the patch you could use multiple trinkets at the same time. (ToEP + ZHC).  Do that at the same time as arcane power + zerking rune and you start 1 shotting people.
---
This guy hit the nail on the head ten times in a row. He perfectly summed up all the major problems that are present in modern WoW, from the weak servers to the stilted, boring progression, and a lack of true multiplayer or even rolepaying in this MMORPG.
---
He does need to proofread, though. It detracts somewhat from his otherwise good points.
---
I don't think "invaluable" is the word you were looking for
---
Plugging /r/DwarfFortress
---
Thanks! I've never taken Engineering ever, but it definitely intrigues me for pvp. I think you all have convinced me. So is that a profession that drains gold in the beginning and then multiplies it at the end?
---
Male for shoulder dominance. 
---
It's also where the entrance to WSG is, assuming we will need to physically go there to enter (I would love to see no battlemasters)
---
&gt;Labour costs are very high, and there's really no way around that.
---
It depends. For example, the cost of labour is going to be more expensive in LA than it would be in Ohio (my home state), because the cost of living is significantly lower in Ohio than it is in CA and they offer lower starting pay in Ohio than they could in CA. But, again, it's not just the cost of labour. If they wanted to consolidate this to a single area they'd have to pay to have a building built from the ground up or rent/buy an existing one, then comes the property taxes and things of that nature, it'd be even more expensive than the labour alone. 
---
 &gt;Sure, but how do you train them? 
---
The same as you would any job, particularly any work from home job. A "simple" training and then test to ensure the possible employee is properly trained for the job and is ready to hit the floor  would be more than enough IMO. 
---
&gt;How do you make it rewarding? 
---
Either outright payment or, in the case of hiring players, offer them to do it part time for a reduced cost of the montly/yearly sub. 
---
&gt;How do you prevent abuse? Who oversees them? And what do you do if they suck at being GM?
---
Random audits, this is literally how customer service works today. Source, I work at a call center. 
---
&gt;In the end, an hour of costumer support will cost the company some amount of money - let's say $50. That's not only what the person gets paid, but also all the other associated costs. That means that a customer who interacts with support for more than a quarter of an hour costs as much as the monthly subscription. Even if you halve that $50, it comes out to just seven minutes a week to match the subscription price.
---
Sorry, brain fog, are you assuming that the GM is getting paid $50 an hour? 
---
&gt;And that's discounting all other costs. The $13 also have to account for ~~development, taxes, servers~~, managers' yachts and sex parties, advertisement -- ~~and profit~~.
---
I'm ok with that. 
---
i could be wrong but i’m pretty sure they’d just put you to sleep at some point while kiting and kill you
---
Razorfen Downs and Razorfen Kraul
---
I have only played vanilla. I been raiding weekly for the past 3 years and I was raiding in retail vanilla.
---
Thunderfury is better than the dagger.
---
Why would they call it Vanilla? It’s a nickname given to the original game by the player base... They call it World of Warcraft Classic to differentiate it as the original game, re-released and from modern World of Warcraft. Try as you might to troll the community, you can’t get past the fact that Classic has already been promised to be as close to the original experience as possible... That means Classic = Vanilla with as few changes as possible to make it run on modern systems... No silly QOL updates, no stupid PTW systems... Play retail if you want all that crap!
---
Around this time, I had a PVE geared warlock, slightly less gear but not much worse.  I joined a pvp guild and my task was to nuke individual enemies down as fast as possible  , like the flag carrier or the ones healing him.   As somebody that had been done PVE for a year I was quite bad at tactical 1 vs 1 duels, but this was a job made for me :D 
---
Vanilla was always about the ”play together”-experience, some people might prefer to play alone but that doesn’t change the fact that original wow was designed in a way that made group play highly advantageous or just preferable tbh
---
&gt; The loot reward there can last you till the 30s.
---
Which, just to underscore your point, means you'll most likely be wearing it for *weeks,* not hours like in retail. Leveling was slooooow, and you probably weren't running more than one dungeon a day, depending on your server pop. It took too long. There were no "thanks for showing up" LFD party favor loot bags or XP rewards per run, either. Or +XP heirlooms, or +XP buffs (aside from rested).
---
Dungeon drops and one-time-only dungeon quest rewards were literally how you were able to level. If your gear sucked, leveling took *even longer than normal, and it already took fucking forever.* People actually died a lot while questing, if you retail kids can believe it! And if you're wearing "of the whale" greens for want of better gear, you're going to be dying a lot more. Have fun corpse-running, too, because there was like one graveyard per zone, and by the time you got back to your corpse everything had respawned, so you'd probably just immediately die again. RIP if you died in a fucking cave.
---
In conclusion: Yes, getting dicked out of 5-man loot actually is a big deal in vanilla.
---
Ahhh. So there IS another route to get to what I need. This doesn't however show all the loot in the dungeon. If you use the non-classic wowhead, it DOES show all the loot when selecting a specific dungeon. That's what I'm looking for, but for Classic. Just something to look at while I'm at work );
---
Same for me. I remember having heated flame wars on the official realm forums regarding our world pvp outings and targeting. Nobody knows anyone anymore.
---
A system like overwatch in csgo exists to ban potential cheaters. It’s a service to the community, by the community. Thanks for the downvotes broys. 
---
Ease off the gas sparky.

Orc is the master race

I play progression Everquest, which a large portion of classic WoW was based upon.  The loot system there is you have a group leader who can either manually assign it to someone, or let it roll.
---
Most of the time loot just rolls, and occasionally someone will speak up and say they need it, so it gets assigned to them.  Typically if the value of the item is low, the person who needs will get it, but for high value items it's understood that everyone will roll on it.  On reason being is that some camps are very heavily weighted to certain classes, and and if a camp has a high value item that only clerics can wear, good luck getting anyone other than a cleric to show up.
---
All that background aside, the one thing I have never in all my years seen is a group leader manually assign a high value item to themselves and just leave.  Never.  Not a single time.  You know why? Because there's no server sharding. If you did that your name would be everywhere as a loot stealer and you would never get a group again.
---
TL/DR: Sharding is just as important to dealing with loot as loot mechanics themselves.
---
There is no new sequence of events. 
---
Player 1 is exchanging classic gold for a token.
---
I admit that it’s not streamlined but you’ve agreed that it’s achievable. You’ve also said it would be similar to ‘simply’ buying gold illegally.
---
Well, yes this is the point.
---
The reason why the token is attractive is because it pays for both subscriptions (can be done by changing characters - no third party programs or detail exchange), also not illegal?
---
If you click on the boss name it goes to that bosses page including a loot table within classic wowhead. It just doesn't have drop percentages but it shows all the items. 
---
You truly see no issues with the ability to retrade items to your group members even if they’re needed? It clearly opens up the ability for friends and guildie to collude with each other, and for ninjas to attempt sale of items. None of these issues existed with the Classic system.
---
Wiping raids
---
A top hunter can do "decent" dps.
---
TLDR; Think about if you wanted to make Pokemon Red remastered for the Switch right? 
---
Option 1: You take the source code from the original game, and adapt it to be compatible with the switch. Easy enough, you have the engine and everything to go with it. But now you have some ***meta*** issues. How do you trade pokemon? What about old exploits people used to cheat the system? What if you need to launch a hotfix to patch some weird bug that the dev team didn't catch? Anything funky that comes up is going to take a ton of work to make that old code work on a modern system.
---
Option 2: You take the original code and convert it to the Let's Go Pikachu engine. This is arguably a lot more work. There's going to be some compatibility problems, but now you have developers who understand the current engine, and have modern tools to fix these issues. 
---
This is a very broad metaphor so please don't take it too critically. Basically the modern engine gives devs modern tools to catch bots, integrate with battle.net, release hotfixes, etc.
---
Ah yeah I remember going there to buy gear from the WSG quartermaster too. 
---
It's not the prettiest, but patch notes from 1.4.0 has some information on DR. You can read what abilities are under what category under the class changes. Same goes for all subsequent patches where you can find some changes to how DR works for certain abilities, notably patch 1.9.0

I didn’t know how bad it was with weak servers. Lag with 20 people in the same place? This is the ultimate worry for classic I think. 
---
If Blizzard can’t shell out for actual servers with the ability to host Vanilla WoW (i.e allow for large concurrent populations in the same zone without sharding) the game will not be fun. Worse, the game’s legacy will be tarnished along with Blizzard’s own already dwindling reputation. A whole generation of WoW players excited to step back into to this (and hell I might pick up some other Blizzard games while I’m at it if Classic gives me the nostalgia and overall experience I’m looking for, I’ve been looking at WC3 remastered anyway). But if it turns out to be a massive failure because they can’t figure out hardware or technical issues, that entire generation of nostalgia seekers will be completely alienated and never think of making the mistake of taking a break from their busy lives to buy another Blizzard game. 
---
This is sink or swim in a sense for Activision-Blizzard and they need to get their game released properly on capable servers or the failure will extend beyond just a disappointing re-release of a 15-year old game.
---
Oh, I guess some of the bosses show their loot tables. 
---
You can play vanilla without talking to anyone too. You can probably even raid without saying more than ''inv pls'', anywho thats besides the point.  
---
I dont think many players even in retail play ''pure'' solo, as in.. never ever interacting with anyone at all. You could 100% play like that in Vanilla without problem. Group for dungeon quests, a few of the harder elite chains and everything else solo. Simply joining a few groups just for a couple of quests is not that different from joining LFG groups tbh.  
---
Yes, you can play retail without ever talking to a single person. You can also play Vanilla without talking to anyone if you absolutely want to. Just skip the harder elite quests, cheese them later or grinds a bit more. It can be done, especially as a pet class or frost mage. Hell, most classes have a bunch of tricks to be able to do almost anything if they really, really want to.  
---
Now, I want to ask you. If you only want to play solo, would you choose retail or vanilla? I am not asking where you can access more content, im asking which one you would choose personally for solo play. I know I would pick vanilla 100 times over before considering retail. As I see it the only reason to play retail is to do hardcore pvp (ie arenas, rbgs) or hardcore pve (HC raiding minimum). In Classic there is tons of fun to be had alone, in retail I would never be able to last a month playing solo.
---
They just cant stop fucking something up these days, can they?
---
Doesn't the article explicitly state this is all opinion-based?
---
This is accurate.
---
I rememer doing dungeons with random people and thinking they were good players/people and recognizing them standing on the bank roof in OG.
---
Or just recognize people just standing around in general or out in the world. 
---
Realizing you could get a reputation depending on how you acted around people and how you played.
---
I miss seeing names and guilds I recognize and knowing "Alright these players are good, better not act like a dumbass infront of them" or "I'll stay away from that dude, he always ninja loot"
---
I can assure you I am serious.   
---
In retail the only fun I can think of is raiding and hardcore PvP. Both require playing with friends. I wouldnt even consider retail if I was playing by myself.  
---
Vanilla on the other hand? Hell yeah id play 1-60 one more time by myself! Its super fun, challenging and rewarding.  
---
In terms of content.. sure you can do more in retail by yourself, but its all watered down and bland.  
---
The sub numbers speak for themselves. Casual players loved playing oldschool wow, now all thats left is hardcore fans and players with guilds and friends.  
---
Would you honestly recommend retail to a new player that wants to play a good game by himself? I know I wouldnt, but I would recommend Vanilla.
---
If you like OSRS you will probably like wow aswell.
---
Everything listed is pretty dead-on.
---
&gt;Orange Orc Bad, And Here's why
---
Point 7 and 4 are why I dropped in legion and  bfa. Wow is not an MMORPG anymore , it is a different game , a third person online action game, some people like it but the early fan of the genre don't .It is that simple.
---
I want a world to 'live' in, not a hub to wait to get teleported to do instanced content. I want things to do with people I actually care to interact with. I want to be part of a tribe that we would call guild and do fun stuff that requires some group dedication, and will create long time friendships and memories.
---
The main issue with a Resto shaman in pvp is that a well geared Elemental can support nearly as well and can blow up enemies possibly better than any other on your team.
---
Elemental is just vastly superior in nearly every situation.
---
&gt; Sorry, brain fog, are you assuming that the GM is getting paid $50 an hour? 
---
No, the opposite. I don't know the correct English terms, but there are costs associated to employing people, and they are usually in the range of two to three times the wage, depending on the country. It includes everything from training, hiring, taxes, providing material and office space, accounting and HR, etc.
---
It depends heavily on location, of course, but I heard that a baseline is about twice to three times the hourly wage for a low-paying job that requires little training. Which is why you'll see people billed $120 an hour for one worker even though he earns only $30.
---
I'll always remember running into someone at UK and they remembered me healing their Naxx run with their guild. The fondest memories were definitely the people and the fact that you had a reputation. Too bad...I keep coming back for a month after an expansion due to the hype, but it's never really the same. 
---
something kinda funny about all the wow related articles on top news sites back in the day. everyone was playing!
---
The spec he is using is called the 3 minute mage. It's called that because once every 3 minute you get to do a crazy amount of damage.
---
Coupled with that, almost all the clips has him with Berzerking, a buff in BG's that give extra % damge taken and dealt. 
---
Along with this, he is double trinketing, which is where you use 2 active trinkets that gives spellpower. This was nerfed later in vanilla, and since classic is 1.12, this won't be possible. That hits this spec quite hard. 
---
AP and PI does not stack.
---
You could literally level from 1-60 by yourself too. Completing every dungeon and raid? No, but 1-60 is probably twice as much content in terms of gameplay time than what you just said.  
---
If you were to recommend a game to a new player looking for a good ''singleplayer'' game.. would you honestly recommend retail with all its LFR, LFG and what not.. over the amazing journey from 1-60? I know I wouldnt.   
---
Hell, even levelling from 1-40 by myself is way more of an adventure and fun than anything I could do solo in retail today. Retail is not fun for casual solo players, and it is reflected in the sub numbers. The meat of the game in retail is raiding and arenas/rbg if you want to pvp, neither of which is doable solo.   
---
In Vanilla on the other hand you could make countless characters and go on adventures seemingly forever by yourself.
---
True, so doesnt really matter which weapon enhancement is chosen. In that case may the Windfury gods be with me 1-60 slow 2h WF more procs more fun!!!!!!

Lmao truth down here at the bottom. They forget to dismiss their pet and fuck up the jump in the beginning of mc and subsequently ruin your entire guilds night, wasting hundreds of combined man hours getting worldbuffs and full consumes. That's what hunters get remembered for. Not for breaking top 15 on a range only fight lol.
---
Thx. Will edit to fix.
---
The screenshot of the feral spec kinda bothers me.  It's like a DPS bear spec.
---
And developing a large scale MMO costs hundreds of millions. It takes quite a lot of customer support to be more expensive than that.
---
I agree with most all this except one point -Naxx. For all the things Blizz has done over the years I dont like, I still like that they acknowleged that they were creating content almost all the player base would never use, and that that was silly. 
---
Remember, an actual less than 1% of the player base got through naxx by the time TBC released. Naxx was cool and epic, but it was also a shit load of time and effort that only a few tens of thousands of players got to enjoy. 
---
And making an MMO costs around 250 million dollars. Thats a lot more than what you 'need' for your customer service.
---
If you posted this data on spreadsheets and in a written format, I'd refer back to it often likely.
---
A 1 hour video to tell me what I can read in 5 minutes? I'll leave it for the newer generations who need such a slow learning tool.
---
This would be great if backed by a site showing just the data, charts and spreadsheets though.
---
I can imagine problems arising with it occasionally. But I'm not going to cry that the sky is falling just based on my imagination, I'd like some real evidence. 
---
Every race looks great for its own reasons and I can’t stand the fact I can never decide.  T_T
---
Haha yeah I remember getting my mount as a level 40 UD lock. I was so excited and thought I wouldn't need to pay for flight paths anymore, and figured it was the perfect time for the long, long run to badlands... straight from UC, no flying. I realized I fucked up by time I made it to tarren mill and realized I was like a third of the way there, but by then it was too late, since hammerfell is barely closer.
---
Damn, I didn't realize you wrote it! It's excellent! Although, in the future, it might need a small bit of spelling/grammatical proofreading, the number of proofreading oversights contrasts highly with the excellent writing and the content of the article. Sorry if I sound like a dick, I loved the article.
---
What facts are wrong exactly?
---
tranq shots and making pulls is a thankless job.
---
if you do it right no one notices.  if you mess up then you are hated by 39 other people. 
---
I mean the article literally says that it is a subjective opinion piece. But hey, you keep doing you bro.

The link to the data and slides are in the pinned comment on the video. Also, it will be on classicwow.live when we relaunch it

I'm assuming you are asking which twink bracket each class does best in. So the question being if you want to play for example a warrior what level would you stop at. Here is my list based on my experience playing in the brackets while leveling through vanilla. I've also personally stopped for a good while at 39 as frost mage and 49 as holy paladin so I have more experience with those brackets.
---
In parentheses after each class is the spec I am assuming the player has when deciding which bracket is best. This list is their performance relative to other classes, many classes get very useful tools at later levels than I list but the problem is that other classes get even better tools.
---
Warrior (Arms): 49. Mortal Strike is a big deal. Plate is nice too.
---
Paladin (Holy/Prot): 49. Cleanse is amazing, before 40-49 bracket they can't dispel magic effects. Blessing of Sacrifice also is amazing for breaking out of many CC. Plate is good too.
---
Shaman (Ele): 39. Gets 1 second cast time reduction on lightning bolt and chain lightning which is huge. Has ghost wolf in this bracket and 20-29 which is a big deal without mounts available. Grounding totem, chain lightning, purge removes 2 magic effects instead of 1, Windfury and windfury totem for melee allies. As you can see shaman gets a lot of extra goodies in this bracket.
---
Hunter: 19. Has a far better toolkit at this level than any other class, but is also generally the best DPS class (in isolation, well coordinated premades would want a more balanced comp) in every bracket before 60, the gap between them and other classes just narrows at higher levels.
---
Druid (Resto): 39. Travel form is great before mounts. Honestly though apart from flag carrying, which they are even more god tier at at 39 than at max level, druids are pretty weak in PvP at any level.
---
Rogue: 29. Rogues get eaten alive by hunters in 10-19 so even though rogues are arguably at their strongest compared to most classes in this bracket they will be better off playing in a higher bracket. Crippling poison is the biggest difference since it helps them stay on their target. But cheap shot, vanish, and mind numbing poison all are good additions too.
---
Priest: 19 (Disc/Holy). Dispel Magic, Psychic Scream. Wanding with the OP Gravestone Scepter is great DPS for no mana cost. 70% heal pushback reduction and 100% for 6 seconds when crit, which is often against hunters and rogues. Most good healing gear in the bracket is cloth so higher armor class healers don't get that much advantage. Overall the best healer in 19 bracket.
---
Warlock (Affliction, Horde): 39. A lot of good spell damage gear is available in this bracket. Get felhunter at 30 which is the best pet for a skilled warlock due to the incredible utility of devour magic and spell lock. Paladins don't have cleanse yet and you don't have to deal with undead's will of the forsaken or shaman's tremor totem. Siphon Life is another nice DoT to sling and Curse of Exhaustion lets you kite. Fear duration increases from 10 seconds to 15.
---
Mage (Fire): 29. Scorch and 70% pushback reduction on it. Blink, Counterspell, and Cone of Cold all add a lot of utility. If you want to focus on FCing or supporting the FC you can go Frost instead, but no pushback resistance except when mana shield is up can be tough to live with. Don't have to deal with good warlocks felhunters dispelling polymorph.
---
I stand corrected, you're right. Anyway I guess the main draw was still crusader then, sort of, 
---
I love me some Questie. Mmm-MMM! 
---
Questie literally has an arrow as well, btw. Click your quest text. Boom. Arrow.
---
&gt;It includes everything from training, hiring
---
One time costs (per employee). 
---
&gt; providing material and office space, 
---
Not needed if they hire work from home employees. 
---
&gt;taxes, accounting and HR, etc
---
That would probably where the extra $$ comes into play on top of the additional hourly wage or sub-reduction. 
---
Still, I'm not convinced that this is something Blizzard is incapable of doing nor do I think doing this would jeopardize Blizzards ability to make a profit. 
---
1v1? No hard cc, no get out of jail free cards, and  you have to hard cast everything (ele) or get endlessly rooted and kited (enh). Also, your main damage (ele) and your heals are in the same school.  Very susceptible to lockout. For 1v1 you have to utilize ALL your tools and its different for each class you fight. Get those keybinds ready including things you'll rarely use anywhere else, like frost resist totem. Of course with either spec if you get the jump, you're in amazing shape because both have great front end burst. This means if you're questing in a contested zone, be the aggressor.
---
I'm planning to go elemental because its fun in bgs. For 5 mans you can be 30/0/21 and play dps or heal. You just need to carry a healing set of gear which is not difficult to put together in classic. As for raiding, there's a chance you can get a raid heal spot as ele. I'm going to try at least, and if not, no raiding for me.
---
Thanks and don't worry about it man, appreciate the feedback. Problem is though that English is a second language and the websites budget is not currently big enough to warrant a proper English editor :-)
---
How was it abused?
---
Have you followed Blizzard news lately? Activision is pretty much gutting anything extraneous in order to feed the bottom line. GMs are definitely extraneous by Activision standards. I'd expect Classic servers to get very little attention AND standard servers to start seeing staff and support reductions.
---
&gt; What is the difference between emulation (ie what private servers do) and down porting the game to the 7.3.5 client they are using.
---
Emulators are written by reverse engineering the official client to try to understand what the server should do (only the server is emulated, they work with the official Blizzard clients).
---
Noone knows exactly what a WoW server does because noone outside of Blizzard can see the original code so they analyze the client behavior and write the server based on that.
---
It's a hell of a brain work that required over a decade but results today are quite amazing.
---
Blizzard doesn't need to "guess" anything because they do have the code and also all the data. The problem with Blizzard code is that it's 15 years old so it's lacking 15 years of improvements in security, development best practices and evolution in how infrastructures work (the hardware part).
---
Those are all "behind the scene" things that players don't even know exist.
---
Bringing the original code up to today's standards would require several years of hard work so it's way way easier for Blizzard to take the modern code that already has all 15 years of improvements and modify it so it can use the original vanilla data, that's why they're doing it this way and it's taking them about 2 years.
---
&gt; a small team of individuals can create an emulated server that handled a 15k launch and blizzard seems to be baffled about light posts
---
2 reasons:
---
1 - Many people seem to believe private servers write their own emulators while that's way far from the truth.
---
Emulators are written by passionate communities working for over a decade, they don't usually use the code to run servers.
---
Private servers teams take that code, already done, put it on a server, maybe do a few fix and run it. It's easy enough for them, the hard work is mostly on emulators developers' shoulders.
---
2 - Private servers runs on single dedicated servers that "live" on their own and don't need to be integrated with anything else. It's cheap and works very well in a private environment but noone in any serious big company would run their software their way.
---
The problem with retail is not that Blizzard infrastructure cannot hold huge load, it can technically (even way more than 15k people) but it's configured not to because of supply/demand/cost saving.
---
Retail is mostly a single player game game today so the infrastructure is configured according to that.
---
Classic will be a totally different beast, it will require a different server configuration than retail, technically it's absolutely possible, it's just a matter of will on Blizzard part.
---
If he is like me, he may have tons of time to play overall, but nearly zero ability to meet dedicated raid times. 
---
I play my mmorpg around everything else in life that has greater priority. Raiders place raiding as a priority in life.
---
You mean Activision. EA has zero to do with Blizzard.
---
Be interested to see gravestone scepter twink priest vs hunter twink, be a close fight. 
---
Male for dance moves
---
&gt; DM on release is just one of the reasons why Classic raiding will be a complete joke. 
---
DM was released like 30 days into NA vanilla and EU vanilla launched with it already in the game. How many people do you think actually got into MC and killed bosses within those first 30 days?
---
And why is enchanting useless for Mara runs 
---
No, they can't use it 
---
Shaman will be the most played class with warrior for sure, classic will be filled with shamans
---
&gt;The loot reward there can last you till the 30s.
---
Just reiterating with an example:
---
On my current char, the defias brotherhood vest I'm wearing I got it from DM at level 19 and I'm currently level 39. The buyable green armor from AH only gives me a slight upgrade. I have an almost 6 days /played.
---
A buddy of mine had a 29 rogue and he would just savage every player on the other team with him, even twinks never had a prayer, only fights that were close from what I remember were other rogues. Does a non-dwarf hunter have a chance against a fully geared Rogue with sprint or swiftness up?
---
And the progression systems in the two things that work (M+ and raiding) feel just completely unsatisfying.
---
And proper blue gear is pretty rare as well. I've done 2 scarlet runs with this char, both times did the 3 main wings (basically 3 shorter instances) without any upgrade for me dropping whatsoever.  I only got a minor upgrade from the quest reward. Same with Razorfen Downs.
---
It’s misleading to say you have wars with 2.5 I have a bis war on that server with 3 piece r14 and rest naxx gear. He has 7k hp with flask and is recking  machine
---
Except gnomes and dwarves
---
My first I dont remember, but my first EPIC mount I do. Took me weeks of dedicated grinding as a resto druid to pile up the cash. Riding away from Thunder Bluff to go get my war kodo was a serious sense of accomplishment in gaming. 
---
I know in the very beginning of wow you could perma freeze trap someone with a hunter. I used to duel and could just trap, aimed shot, fd and repeat. 
---
It's rare you'll get leaks from big game companies nowadays. Games are often in development for 4 + years with hundreds of people working on them and nothing leaks. Employees have nothing to gain and everything to lose.
---
I hope so. However, recent surveys place them at the least popular class
---
All the feels. I can't wait.
---
If you can launch a vanilla client (on any pserver)  you can use the addon atlasloot and get an overview of all the loot, and sort by dungeon (raids too)  is one of the default features. 
---
It seems as though every expansion adds a glaring issue, and when the next one releases, they do nothing to address the issue, while adding an entirely new problem. 
---
Take BC, for example. It had the problem of making the original 1-60 content less relevant and emptier. Wrath kept this issue, while adding it's own problem of an emptier community, due to the cross-realm LFG tool. Cata kept those problems, added in LFR. MoP Kept those problems, and added in even *more* difficulty settings and removed old talents, implemented mass sharding. 
---
WoD added mythic dungeons, making 5 man content even more cluttered and confusing, Legion expanded it, made Artifact weapons which exist as an issue in BFA in the form of Azerite gear.
---
In comparison, WoD and Legion arguably didn't add much on that remained in the game. Garrisons for WoD, Artifact Weapons for Legion, and the content wasn't necessarily *bad* in either of those expansions. But, by that point, the previous expansions' flaws just kept compounding and combining, until the remaining game is just a husk of what it was. Perhaps the past few expansions would have been great if they solved the issues instead of doubling down. The content genuinely looks cool, and I'm a little sad I won't ever see the majority of Legion's and BFA's content, as well as whatever comes next.
---
They really have to unwind the line they've been tangling for so long for me to resubscribe. I'm probably not in the minority either, since I started subscribing less and less, just as everybody else did, and the numbers became so low that Blizzard stopped reporting them.
---
Pull to tank, tank hits, use Feign Death. Misdirect just made it simpler. 
---
Well yeah but those percentages are flawed as they are split between two factions, therefore making shamans actually the most popular one after warriors if you double it.
---
Reasons why the Horde and Alliance Don’t get along:
---
Burning some overgrown bush &lt; This.
---
Doesn’t work for Deadmines. I didn’t check any others but i think it’s strange that there is so much data about Vanilla but not a simple, complete overview of dungeon loot. 
---
Ah, i apologize! It never was an issue or anything. Thanks for making the article!
---
was a 42 dwarf rogue finally after many scarlet monestary dungeon runs i was able to afford the white ram,  it was a crazy experience, thought it was so fast lol
---
Looting weapons.
---
Not sure how optimal it was but my spell power based 19 affliction lock was a lot of fun because of the wand. Dot up everyone, run out of mana, wand until you have mana again. I can't recall ever not being in first place for damage done.
---
if i remember correctly, they deaggro on a certain range.
---
This is wrong. Make your warlock. Then delete him and remake a Tauren Shaman. Only with shoulders of that magnitude will you be able to achieve your destiny.
---
Not my experience. The excess warriors go dps. Casual warrior tanks for dungeons have always been more rare than finding a druid or even a tank paladin.
---
In guild, I constantly hear warrior frustration over trying to be a tank. They want to raid ... and the reality of raiding is that only a VERY FEW, very good warriors tanks raid consistently. Once a guild finds their warrior tanks, they stick with them.
---
So warriors without raid tanking spots, get frustrated being spec'd prot and spec dps or a pvp spec and those players typically SUCK ad dungeon tanking and you'd likely be way, way better off with a druid who often ganks as often as they dps and knows how to play.
---
This happened in vanilla retail and on private servers. Warriors are EVERYWHERE ... but you can't find one to tank a dungeon unless you get some raid geared warrior helping pre-BIS their fresh 60s.
---
It might be a thing that sticks, though I generally call retail "modern", since Classic is now going to be retail too. The only problem, is I also call the entire game from Cata onwards "modern", so I really don't know what to specifically call the latest chunk of content. Maybe just by it's name, BFA?
---
I’ll GM for free 
---
You wanna roll a hunter too????
---
I got my first horse at level 60 with my mage. 
---
I am not joking.
---
Btw, love your videos. However, I sadly wont be watching this, as I feel like I want to still feel the joy of discovery and learning in-game, which will not happen quite as strongly if I already know everything about Shamans after watching your educative videos &gt;&lt;. Great job anyway, the previous ones were great!!
---
None of the materials you'd get are in high demand so half the loot loses value when you de it and nothing gains much if any
---
Is this a #nochanges parody or are you serious? 
---
I can't tell anymore
---
I don’t think any video game could ever teach a more real life lesson than logging in to realize you spent months leveling a character but now no one wants to play with you because of your actions.
---
Server transfers wouldn’t come out for several more years either
---
Hunters were also fairly common back in the day. Mostly because its a class that's easy to level and can get a lot of stuff done solo. It was also one of the best classes for farming. 
---
Unfortunately that also lead to a ton of huntards running around. I deal raid comps usually only have 2 hunters, 3 at the most. So good hunters will always have a role in any raid. Bad hunters are disgusting though. 
---
No offense taken. I totally understand that standpoint..and I've actually stated somewhere that despite my data showing that elemental sucks low level. I'm still going to do it when classic comes because class fantasy is that important to me. Thanks for the support
---
(As they don’t have anything to gain)
---
I think you should quote the entire sentence. To avoid being misleading ;)
---
One that knows all the little tricks in dungeons. He can solo the lyceum before you are even done swimming thru lava, he knows how to pull 7 dwarves during a lava run, etc.
---
The vast bulk of my private server play over the last 3 years has been Druid and Hunter. More Druid than hunter too.
---
Each server I leveled one, I went full feral, entered early raids as feral as well (easy on private servers). I could obviously enter any dungeon as dps and often did (and often out damage most others as feral scale nicely early ... but tap out scaling later due to math and huge gear gap issues) but I was asked to tank far more and gladly did it.
---
Get in a guild with that one guy who is dedicated feral, and you will always have the best/easiest/versatile dungeon tank available. Warriors are too unpredictable. Most aren't spec'd Prot unless they are Raid tanks and most will make your dungeon run highly risky unless you know the warrior is good (about 1 in 20 will tank well).
---
I don't know what to say. There is no MMO store where you can by one MMO for 250 mil. Maybe that's the average investment, but it's just a number that doesn't say anything at all.
---
Also, development doesn't really scale with player count. If you double the number of players, you need to double the number of CS reps. You don't need to double your dev team. 
---
Actually, I took a look into AB's report for last year. They put a billion into development, 1.3 billion into marketing, and a billion into things like CS and running servers. All in all, development is expensive, but it only makes up about 20% of their costs.  And WoW is an ongoing project with a mature base.
---
And vanilla WoW doubly so. The dev costs will be negligible. There won't be 200 people working on Classic, or even 50. Running costs will dwarf the costs of the dev team.
---
Say we’re in a dungeon. Something drops that we both want. I hit need and so do my 2 friends (that don’t need it) . One of them win and trade it to me. So I pretty much got 3 rolls for a chance to beat out your one.
---
Yep. Reward wise. I just find the content itself inherently fun.
---
This would be hilarious. You got killed by a hunter 15 levels below you!? HA!
---
Yes, when that occurs yes. When the windfury doesnt proc, enh shaman is just plain kiteable meat.
---
Agreed, it is fun content.  What I miss is the character progression aspect.. like going to a raid to get stronger so I could crush the ants out in the world with the rewards.  Now you get stronger in a raid and guess what.... all the mobs in the world also got stronger.. yay..?  I understand it's a different game, but I can only stay interested in so long playing a platformer with no character identity or progression.
---
I never said development was the most expensive.  
---
\&gt; They put a billion into development, 1.3 billion into marketing, and a billion into things like CS and running servers.   
---
So you agree with me then? CS is clearly not the most expensive according to this, it is marketing.
---
Hunters become one of the least played if only including the dedicated raiding crowed. Hunters swarm the leveling grounds though.
---
If you plan on being a dedicated raider, you will have likely no more of an issue finding a raid slot than other classes and not as bad as some hybrid trying to dps.
---
It's those who dedicate their time to learning how to play and SHOW UP regularly that get raid slots. Showing up on time is almost he biggest restraining factor at times.
---
Be good at what you do ... and don't worry about others because most do nothing to improve themselves once they reach their usual plateau.
---
When you get fucked in the ass by the same person everyday, you kinda expect to get fucked the next day.
---
We are getting fucked by blizzard on every single IP since 1-2 years, so we expect to get fucked on classic as well. It seems perfectly logic to me.
---
Blizzard has lost the trust of their customers because of decisions they made, and you don't understand why everyone is cynical of any decision they make ? It seems pretty clear. I'd rather be a pessimistic cry baby who doesnt get disappointed in the end than an optimistic idiot who ends up getting fucked in the ass. Again. By the same guy. For the third time this week.
---
Exchanging retail gold for classic gold is probably going to be against rules too, but it seems reasonably unenforceable.  
---
This exchange requires someone buying a token for retail gold (or buying retail gold, or earning it fairly in retail), then finding someone who will trade retail gold for classic gold.  The second part is simply not made into more of a problem by the existence of tokens.  Retail gold is ludicrously easy to get.
---
I consider myself a very skilled hunter and definitely plan on being an active raider. The reason I ask is mainly due to the lack of raid spots. Your post gives me a lot of confidence that I will be fine. Thank you for taking the time to answer!
---
Yes, they can vendor/shard it
---
Why does everyone see the bad posture as a bad thing? I feel it works great with the race stereotype. I dont wanna see some stand-straight, proud human-like trolls, I wanna see hunched, ugly and laidback forest trolls
---
I remember being ran in both Vanilla and BC and I'm excited to be able to run lower levels sometime soon myself. Not sure when or if an XP nerf ever happened but completing the quests and the items you can get are such a huge plus either way. 
---
You think so? I don't remember having issues being kited at all. I remember being able to frost shock and ghost wolf myself into most players. As well as earthbinding totem, warstomp...
---
Yeah I dunno lol. I only remember being unstoppable under most scenarios!
---
Training costs are ongoing. Even if you work for McDonald's flipping burgers. Processes change, the software you use change.
---
Hiring costs are ongoing, as you usually have bad job retention in low paying jobs.
---
You need to provide employees working at home with material, often with more material than people working in an office. You don't want people with access to your databases, even low-level access to use their filthy infected home computer to access them. In fact, you will be usually barred from that by law or your insurance company.  So you need to give them a laptop, provide them with software.
---
Sure, Blizzard could do it. But in the end, you can put a price tag on every feature. Especially with Classic, where there is less potential for additional revenue by selling in-game services, they need to keep costs down where they can. 
---
I'm definitely not one of those hunters that will wipe my group (knock on wood). I like to think I have 100% control of my pet :D
---
someone films hours and hours of their pvp and the cuts it down to all to their POM pyroblast combos that crit enough to kill someone.
---
There is no experience for battlegrounds in vanilla. Other than turning in the 3 marks you get for winning (and you can only do that 2-3 times for experience).
---
What is funny about this it that private servers flat out told you they can't restore deleted things or many things Blizzard typically could ... and nearly nobody had an issue with it.
---
Players understood the limitations and still had fun. It's the expectations of the consumer that is the issue. Blizzard only has to say they can do X but not Y and that's it forever ... and players will adapt.
---
It's the crying generations (including all here, but I know you know the most affected) that expects hand holding for everything. And no, I don't expect Blizzard to have the genital size to do it.
---
I didn't know Eyes of the Beast was taken out of the game. According to the Wiki article:
---
&gt; Greg "Ghostcrawler" Street, answering a question at BlizzCon 2013 regarding the hunter ability, said that Eyes of the Beast was actually clipped from the game code. It would be a non-trivial matter to add it back, and would come at the cost of adding some other ability to the game.
---
So many questions. Why take it out in the first place? Why delete the damn code? Who makes this kind of decisions?
---
I'm 99% certain that the xp did get nerfed but I don't know when.
---
lol! thats great
---
Hold keyboard upright securely with both hands. Vigorously apply face to keyboard and roll side to side.
---
Just kidding, great stuff keep up the good work!
---
this is my plan.
---
Especially early in classic, gold will be hard to come by and materials are only worth what you can sell them for to a vendor.
---
Leather is abundant through skinning, much more than other resources, and you can get a solid headstart on your cash compared to other specs just by vendoring the leather.
---
I always play a hunter in vanilla. Now, hunters can have it tough against rogues, because rogues can slow you with poisons. Dwarves don't give a shit about their poison though, because their skin can turn into stone, and you can't poison stone, dummy. Therefore, I alwways play a dwarf, because dwarf is stone, and you can't slow stone with poison, stupid rogue.
---
It will eventually happen to even good players. Back in vanilla most guilds didnt allow Hunter pets out during raids.
---
Thats a great story
---
Go engineering and skinning. Skin is better for the leveling and helps you get your mount asap. Mining and herb slows down your leveling because you need to run for the nodes and need to dedicate extra time to keep it on the same level with your leveling speed.
---
Female, male looks HORRIBLE on the horse mount! Other classes, male.
---
Ah, that makes sense 
---
Sounds more like you're stung by what the writer has to say about retail than their article being factually wrong
---
That would free up a lot of stress for sure. Plus, even without growl, I feel like my pet still manages to pull aggro in 5-10 mans.
---
Mafioso detected
---
I have no experience with building emulators, but I have a lot of experience with this *porting* software.  I work on a project that involves porting a 15-year-old desktop (Java) application to run as a browser-based (JavaScript) application, where behavior must be almost perfectly replicated across platforms, bug for bug.  In the first 18 months or less, we had all of the most-common stuff ported, but there was still a bunch of stuff not ported yet.  We're more than 5 years into the project now, and there still isn't feature parity, and there probably never will be.  You can't just go and take things from one system and shove it into some other very different system and expect it all to work out fine.  Different systems have different things that they make easy or difficult, possible or impossible.
---
The emulator author usually has to do a lot of reverse-engineering and guesswork, while Classic is *mostly* just reimplementing things.  They already have the data, so they don't need to do the reverse-engineering or the iterations of guessing-and-checking.
---
In some ways this is very nice for someone who wants to port software; they can be *certain* that they have the right data.  In other ways, this is a burden, because you're forced to find a way to *exactly* reproduce the old behavior.  It's convenient sometimes to be able to say, "Well, it doesn't matter if this is exactly right.  I'll just implement it the easiest way that I can imagine that's close enough."  This is especially true when you're dealing with some old system that someone you never met wrote a dozen years ago, and you have no idea WTF they were thinking when they wrote 80+ lines of incomprehensible code where you would have just written one or two lines.  Did they do it this complicated way on purpose?  You might assume that they didn't and then write your thing... and then find out later that either they *did* do it on purpose and you just didn't understand their code, or that they didn't do it on purpose, but that not doing it in their strange way leads to other unexpected bugs, because other things were relying on their strange code.
---
All of this is to say that there are trade-offs for doing a clean-house reimplementation or not.  Things can get "lost in translation".  It's actually not *that* hard to provide a "close enough" translation.  However, if you won't accept errors in the translation, then it can be a burden to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of the original.
---
In this regard, the private server people are not constrained by the expectation of near-perfection or the idea that their server needs to be worth everyone paying $15 per month to play there.  They aren't expected to have everything perfectly implemented.  They're not expected to have 100% server uptime.  They're not expected to build something that scales to millions of users.  They're not expected to produce a professional codebase that can continue in maintenance and development for another decade or two.  They can get away with delivering 80 or 90% of WoW with 20% of the work (which is a [Pareto distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution), which comes up in the real world quite often).  And hats off to the pserver folks for it.
---
But Blizzard's playing a different game.  It is a part of their reputation that they release highly-polished games.  Yeah, their games have flaws and bugs, but 90% quality isn't going to cut it for them.  They don't want the Blizzard brand to be known as "the 90% quality guys" (or like Bethesda, who are known more like "the 80% quality guys"); they've built their reputation on being the "98% quality guys".  I don't imagine that they would settle for pserver quality, even though it would be good enough for many of us.
---
&gt; How difficult is it?
---
I imagine that it's more time-consuming for them than it is challenging, but... it depends.  Where it could get very annoying is... something for which I'll use Sentry Totem as an example.  (Everything I'm about to say is very hypothetical, and is probably wrong in reality, but I'm just saying this to make a point about a general sort of problem that I expect them to run into a lot.)
---
Sentry Totem was always an odd totem in how you activated/deactivated it (by clicking on the totem buff), and was almost certainly special-cased in the client's code.  It was removed in Cataclysm.  Now, 10 years later, maybe there's a bunch of cruft that makes it difficult to actually get Sentry Totem working.  So now they now have to go tear up all the old code, re-enable clicking on totems, re-allow totems-as-cameras, and maybe figure out how to some hack detection code to not trigger when Sentry Totem is used.
---
I cannot stress enough that that was all hypothetical, with a harebrained scenario that I thought up in a second or two.  But understand that this game is enormous, there could seriously be thousands of things like this.  Or maybe just dozens.  I obviously can't say for sure.
---
&gt; What is most time consuming?
---
Honestly, I would expect a large portion of the work to be data conversion.  They need to adapt their data from the old format to the format that is expected by the modern client and server.  The old format might look like:
---
```
---
&lt;item id="123456"&gt;
---
  &lt;bonuses&gt;&lt;/bonuses&gt;
---
&lt;/item&gt;
---
while the new format might look like this:
---
{ type: "item", id: 123456, color: "default", bonuses: [] }
---
Both of these things contain the same information.  But the modern client and server only talk in the second form now.  So the data needs to be adapted.  An attempt will be made to automate this, of course, and then they'll find problems in their converter, will stumble for a while before getting it pumping out data that's *close* to right, then they'll find bugs in the conversions, and have to fix up the converter and run it again, or manually tune up the converted data (hopefully not that).  They'll almost certainly go through several iterations of that.
---
For the most part, I would expect that their day-to-day activities would mostly be as follows:
---
  1. Design meetings (many, many days will be lost in planning meetings, defining the scope of the project, which things will be released when, and planning how they're going to execute on it; they will also probably have a lot of discussions about things like, "should we do loot trading, or no?" or even "what version of AV should we use?", so they don't waste extra effort on, say, getting one version of AV working when, in fact, they're going to ship a different one, or on coding themselves into a corner that makes loot trading difficult to add later if that's what they're going to add eventually)
---
  2. Data conversion rigmarole (as mentioned above)
---
  3. Testing (they have a huge game that they need to test, to make sure *everything* is working smoothly; this takes a huge amount of time)
---
  4. Bug fixes (putting in bug fixes for the problems found in testing; the fixes themselves will usually be very quick, but then they need to do another round of testing to make sure that their fixes didn't introduce new bugs)
---
  5. Implementing features (that is, adding things that weren't in Vanilla, like loot trading, or (from my earlier hypothetical example) making Sentry Totem possible again; this is usually time-consuming, and then requires repeating steps 3 and 4)
---
I made a point here about testing being time-consuming.  I can already hear the people saying, "Then they should let us beta test it!  We can take the testing burden off their hands!"  Yes... but... then you'll see all of the bugs (of which there will probably be thousands) and declare that the sky is falling and that Blizzard doesn't know what they're doing, because you don't understand all the effort that goes into giving you all this software that you have that has close to no detectable bugs in it.  Fixing the bugs is usually not very difficult, but a developer (wrongly) looks incompetent when they show something that contains a lot of bugs.  As it turns out, talking to computers in flawless logic is difficult and not something that humans are built for.  But don't expect the general population to understand or accept that.
---
&gt; I just don’t understand how a small team of individuals can create an emulated server that handled a 15k launch and blizzard seems to be baffled about light posts.
---
Okay, first of all... they're not "baffled".  That presentation was to show you one of the types bugs that they ran into, so you would understand what "creating Classic" entails.  I'm sure they fixed that bug quickly and easily.  The claim that they were "baffled" should be referred back to my comment from the last section about how the general population doesn't understand software development and can't handle seeing bugs.
---
These sorts of bugs happen in *every* software project.  If I write code for 30 minutes and don't make any errors, I am amazed with myself and very suspicious that the computer is lying to me and not actually running my latest code.  Software is not trivial, and it's not magic.  And I'm sure there were thousands upon thousands of bugs worse than the lightposts that cropped out and were fixed before the release of any pserver that you've played on.  It's just that you never saw them.  And then there were the bugs that you *did* see, for which you will give the pserver people a pass, but wouldn't give Blizzard one.
---
Again, the pservers are being built with different development constraints than WoW Classic is.  The pserver people have just been implementing the highly visible and easy-enough-to-implement parts of it.  I don't have a problem with that, but comparing the two projects is not fair, in my opinion.
---
Can't argue with that!
---
Great video, I was wondering how/where you got the spell coefficients for flametongue weapon and frostbrand, every place I've looked around says it should be 10% for both rather than the 15% and 25% respectively that you showed
---
That's basically any montage video.  Who shows their loses anyway?
---
What evidence are you looking for? It was a thing, and it can be confirmed by searching key words and phrases. You are just creating what is called an argument from ignorance. It's occurring here because this proposition that a mechanic was abused is assumed to be false because it has not yet been proved true. In your clearly rigid mind, for it to be proven true there needs to be a scientific method employed. IT WAS A THING, why not avoid it being a thing? Seems simple right? 
---
will server transfers be in classic?
---
I get why they have scaling. It all comes down to gear inflation, which is there because there are multiple raid difficulties. They should just make ez and hard mode servers with fewer difficulties per server if they want to be like that.
---
I think I'd base it on the next classic changes update in all honesty. Really a good marker for the future direction of the company, not to mention it should give an idea of the short (ish) term success of classic.
---
If you're talking about very short term it's a harder question and I don't play those games.
---
Which are the best.
---
Gnomish for [Gnomish battle chicken](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10725)
---
No, I just see 4 distinct groups of people that are postiively impacted by it and 0 that are negatively impacted.
---
Uh yeah I'm gonna need to see that something is proven to be true before I start believing it. That's just basic common sense, but I guess it's more fun to imagine that the sky is falling. Isn't that right, Chicken Little? 
---
Said it before and Ill say it again. Just don't do anything. Let it be without loot sorting stuff
---
Nice bait
---
BFA had the potential to be a good game. The leveling zones and stories are great. The cities are unique and cool. The dungeons are varied and have fun mechanics.
---
But the systems they overlay on top of all this just ruins it, and the screw ups they caused made it feel like a private server.
---
Leveling made you weaker rather than stronger. Release of Mythic+ gave everyone a free chest with +10 keys and loot. Weapon drops that were meant to be cosmetic were real weapons, then converted to their intended item, then reverted back. New azerite items got worse as your HoA level went up. Catch up mechanics were introduced way too fast, and only for one faction.
---
I remember having a blast all the way up through M0, and being geared ready to go for mythic+ and raids. Then all the drama went down and catch up mechanics made the 2 weeks I spent grinding feel worthless. Playing the weekly chest rng casino was frustrating when you got a tank trinket in your DPS spec.
---
Final straw was when I joined a guild to do world PvP (warmode, a main selling point of this game), and we couldn't even get half the guild in the same phase.
---
Truly a shame how trashy this game has become. I'm finding it hard to be optimistic for classic knowing what they've done to retail. Shit apple doesn't fall far from a shit tree.
---
Exactly this! exactly this!
---
I haven't decided 100% on my character yet, but I am leaning heavily towards Orc Warlock. And if I do make one, it would definitely be female. I don't like how the males look in cloth gear and they look terrible on the lock mount. Female all the way. 
---
I mean, most of this okay, but really comes across as somebody who wants to be forced into challenges instead of actively seeking them. It's fine to do that, but it's way more accurate to say "there's nothing I want to do" instead of saying "there's nothing to do".
---
&gt; Now I KNOW that beating LFR is hardly beating the game, but when everyone has already seen the last boss of the game, people feel less inclined to do the rest on a higher difficulty.
---
If that were true then nobody would be doing anything beyond LFR. Instead we see more than 5,000 guilds with Mythic raid progress in Dazar'alor, and nearly 14,000 guilds with Heroic progress (based on [Raider.io rankings](https://raider.io/battle-of-dazaralor/rankings/world/mythic). What you really mean to say is, "I won't seek out challenges because \*insert personal reason\*". It's fine to feel that way, but to intentionally avoid challenge then claim it doesn't exist or that nobody will do it is disingenuous at best.
---
&gt; Everything in World of Warcraft today is designed to be easily beatable as a solo player, and it no longer incentivizes people to socialize.
---
I mean, Mythic raids disagree with this. High tier Mythic+ also disagrees with this. **Some** content is beatable as a solo player, but the high tier challenging content requires decent groups. Vanilla wasn't really better in this method either. You could easily PUG your way through everything but raiding, and even then you could PUG your way into raids if a group needed people. The only difference is needing to speak to people (and/or spamming trade chat) vs hitting a button (LFR/LFD)/using group finder (Normal+ raids, Mythic+ dungeons).
---
&gt; World of Warcraft should be playable as a singleplayer game, but it should never be the baseline way to play.
---
Single player has always been the baseline experience for leveling. That's why WoW got as popular as it did, because it was *THE* casual MMO. I feel like a lot of people forget that WoW was always marketed as a casual MMO.
---
&gt; The game had choices in the sense that you had a ton of optional content to do and could choose your own path instead of just one streamlined route that everyone takes.
---
This is just factually incorrect. If anything you've got more choices on what to do now than you ever have. Let's do a couple of comparisons.
---
Leveling (1-60 only):
---
*Vanilla:* Only the zones whose range match your current level, which limits your choices.
---
*BFA:* Any zone in Eastern Kingdoms/Kalimdor, only gated by a starting level, and scaling up to 60.
---
Gearing processes:
---
*Vanilla:* Normal Dungeons (leveling) &gt; "raid" dungeons &gt; raids. Maybe some crafted items or PvP items (if you rank high enough in PvP)
---
*BFA:* Normal Dungeons (leveling) &gt; mix of Heroic Dungeons, World Quests, Warfronts, PvP, LFR &gt; mix of varying levels of Mythic+, World Quests, Warfronts, PvP, Normal raiding &gt; Higher Mythic+ levels, Heroic Raiding, PvP &gt; Mythic Raids
---
Thats a tough one, probably male for the flapping cape while casting and the pony sized warlock mount.
---
If DM Trib solo is in Classic, you'd be crazy not to have a pocket 60 hunter alt. 
---
Minimum 6 hours for two three hour sessions. Max 12 hours for 3 4 hour sessions. 90 of raiding guilds fall in this range 
---
That's the whole company. WoW doesn't cost 3.3 billion a year. They "only" grossed about 9 billion in 14 years.
---
But yeah, marketing gets a huge chunk. But development and marketing costs are very front-loaded. Running an MMO? Well, you got to deal with the running costs, and they quickly add up. As I demonstrated in my calculation above.
---
While I don't like the cata look system, keep in mind here, that's for the whole company. Most of that is probably for the big AAA releases, not WoW Classic. I'm guessing they don't want to devote too many resources until they see how things work long term, so while they might be able to afford it, if the game can't support it then they're losing money. 
---
0.1% will complain? I really doubt it will be even close to that low. It's WoW. Complaining goes hand in hand.
---
As much as I was upset at the time when they recycled Naxx in WoTL, I look back now grateful I was able to experience the full raid.  Back in Vanilla, my guild could only down the first bosses in 2 wings (spider and knights).
---
I agree with you on your point though; but there should be a balance on available content.
---
A group of (mostly) private server Wow players with Youtube channels getting together for a Classic Wow themed show. Worth a watch at times and some decent insider information at times or at least tons of vanilla info if out of the loop since original Classic Wow.
---
The one guy is a well known dedicated Ret paladin who raids. Obviously he has the best gear and instructs people on how to maximize Ret damage. Basically:
---
1. You use every consumable and buff for BOTH melee and magic. This takes a lot of investment and time.
---
2. You use FULL dps rotation on every fight, including trash and mana dump.
---
3. You sit and drink after every fight even if just to tap off your mana because you must have mana to sustain your dps.
---
You do all of this and you will likely out DPS several primary DPS'rs in the raid (because gear and skill disparity exists) and be competent enough on most bosses to maintain your Raid spot as long as you are a primary raiding build member.
---
Also, the entire viability of Ret dps in raids on private server may not reflect how Paladins play in Classic. Private servers may have some math wrong that will alter expectations once Classic goes live. It's one reason why I'm not going Feral as primary like on private servers. I have no clue yet that they will perform exactly the same.
---
I have tons of private server experience, but I am keeping an open mind about the Classic conversion. There absolutely will be some differences and private servers are canon to rules ... we just got overly familiar with their "best guess" effort.
---
Exactly! So we can agree that CS is indeed not the most expensive part of running an MMO then? :) Great!
---
Great article!
---
It's almost unbelieveable how Blizzard could make the design decisions that they have. How the concepts that worked so well in Vanilla and BC just got thrown out the window.
---
I mean just think about the point in the article about levelling up a character or doing a dungeon and NEVER being close to dying/wiping? How can a RPG be designed in that way? It's just baffling to me. When you got a blue item in the past, that was HUGE, because it increased your chance of surviving in pve and pvp with so much. Even seeing an epic item drop was just a pipe dream...
---
I love that you included the Jeff Kaplan video from 2005. That video is a golden "historical" document.
---
This would be my reason.
---
How so? I know warlocks are very strong in PvP, but with grounding totem and tremor totem, wouldn't it be... well... let's say challenging at most? 
---
We're not talking about a new scientific theory that will bring about change to human kind. The kind of rigor that is required to prove such a claim is reserved for such situations. Furthermore, there are no serious implications or benefactors in this situation. Therefore, one can make reasonable deductions from anecdotal data and draw a logical conclusion that this issue likely existed. You always get unreasonable people that want an inquest into issues that do not demand it due to the rigidity in their minds. I'm really appreciative that most people have brains superior to yours, otherwise we'd be stuck running studies proving all kinds of absurd things - a piece of timber is a piece of timber opposed to a composite. Common sense is subjective. 
---
Yes the shoulders are nice
---
Yes the dance moves...I forgot!
---
Right...the males look really bad on mounts
---
Tauren....Shaman....LOLOLOLOLOL
---
They don't understand that less is more for a lot of people. They are afraid of removing features for a certain part of the playerbase, but but didn't hesitate to ruin it for others by adding.
---
It's an oversight of massive proportions. They cant see the forest for the trees.
---
The dungeon xp itself wasn't nerfed in vanilla that I recall. However, if your friend was a significantly higher level than you, you got junk xp but that wasn't limited to dungeons, it was anytime you were grouped.
---
I'm leaning toward female just because the male looks so goofy alot of times.
---
thats a bit hyperbolic. a full clear brd shouldnt take more than 2 hours with no wipes
---
I am most likely going to do the same, or go somewhere between with the hybrid spec you presented before, for leveling.
---
Maybe you missed that me and my friends NEVER did this.
---
Im sure in some regards, they think theyre doing well, though. It's likely theyre making more money with every passing year, but not because of high subscription numbers like a great game would draw in, but because of record Microtransactions and stunts like the 6-month subscription mount.
---
Unbeaten content is not bad, even if it stayed at the 1 %. It wouldn't though, if TBC didn't come as soon as it did.
---
I think any time you play with somebody who would be ?? to you, or perhaps if the mobs are gray to them, then you get virtually 0 XP. It's great if you want to twink out a character and get the best dungeon items, but it's in place so you can't just powerlevel somebody through dungeons, it would be too easy.

Time Zone: GMT+11
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+11 (days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP (Details TBA)
---
Guild name: &lt;Dominatus&gt;
---
Contact: https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX
---
Guild info: Dominatus will be a late-night, semi-hardcore guild with a no-dickhead policy. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+11 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: At this stage anyone can join, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

If you're really 50/50, I suggest female. The model looks better overall in my opinion.

Hi, /u/FacingHardships
---
&gt;In Battle for Azeroth, I can be in Boralus in the same spot, at the same time as another member of my guild, and the likelihood is that we won’t even see each other
---
It's possible this is true on some servers, but I have never seen it on mine. It's true of every other place in the game, though. Just not Boralus (haven't played my horde characters enough this expansion to know if it's true there)

---
I remember regretting not buying the black Nightsaber. A mistake I corrected at 60.
---
This was not directed to you but supporting your case.
---
CS is the most expensive part of running a MMO.
---
I mean in general sure. But when you consider that Naxx was basically the entire patch, it creates a business model issue if you continue that method long term. It added nothing for almost the entire population, because most would never be geared enough to go the way old raid tiering is.
---
Todays system of regularly invalidating everything non current is a different level of bad design. There needs a balance. 
---
&gt;Training costs are ongoing. Even if you work for McDonald's flipping burgers. Processes change, the software you use change.
---
It depends on how often and how dramatically. If a company is constantly changing processes and upgrading their software to a point where new training is needed then I have more concerns than the cost of training TBH. That said, the cost of "training" after the initials is TYPICALLY negligible. In all the places I've worked the training after the initial introduction is typically 30-1 hour segments once or twice a year because 1 minor thing in an existing process has changed. 
---
&gt;You need to provide employees working at home with material, often with more material than people working in an office. You don't want people with access to your databases, even low-level access to use their filthy infected home computer to access them. In fact, you will be usually barred from that by law or your insurance company. So you need to give them a laptop, provide them with software.
---
Hard disagree here. When you have people working in an office you're not just paying for the materials they need to do their job (computer, software, pencils, paper, etc.) you're paying for the building which includes but is not limited to landscaping, utilities (electric and plumbing, etc.) and so, so much more; let alone, if the building has to be evacuated or if there's a fire, you're losing money every second those employees are unproductive. 
---
Now, the cost of laptops and the software (security, I'm assuming) is where it would get a little pricey, assuming that they're providing laptops and this software to their (work at home) employees, but, in this scenario (Blizzard WoW GM) I think it'd be more reasonable to leverage the price of the security software and/or verification to see if the security the potential employee has is on par and let them use their own PC. This is all assuming that the GM's are working out of game and through some Blizzard and/or 3rd party system to service GM tickets, though, not sure why they couldn't work in the game itself. 
---
&gt; they need to keep costs down where they can.
---
To maximize profits, yes, but at the cost of our experience. 
---
I was thinking more along the lines of letting everyone know what 60’s are ganking level 30’s... but that would be nice too
---
Well let's consider Animations. Warlocks use a lot of the "toss your hand out for a spell" animation, and Male orcs toss one hand while female orcs put out both and lean forward. I prefer the female orc casting myself, Male orcs look silly on the horse as someone else said. So personally I'd do female for the casters, Male for melee
---
Most of the times I'm run or I run people through it's to get all the quests done.  That can be a huge help.
---
Dire Wolf, my very first mount (Though it was in TBC). I dinged 30 just days after the patch that lowered it

---
I mean if you wanna be the Shaman it is the best one. Not only will you have shoulders that can bear the burdens of any destiny. You also gain warstomp. Which while not superb on a warrior. Is strong as all hell on a Shaman or Druid. Dew it man seize your destiny. Play Tauren Shaman and frolic through the fields with me.
---
in retail vanilla there was a time when you can use mulitple trinkets at once.  pretty sure PI worked like this as well
---
they soon changed it
---
Plate is a hunter weapon. 
---
Depends on what you wanna do during each bracket. It's not all about trying to one shot someone - and it boring to play the same thing as everyone else.
---
A 19 shaman is great at doing many things and you're able to getting the gear is easy to bis; except timber maw rep grinding. 29 hunters have so much gear available to em, and the skills they get around this time frame makes em great at defending. 39 druid are an obvious option because they can flag carry all day, but warrior at this bracket is awesome as well as they get all that great mail gear from SM and zerker stance. 49 is all about shadow priest and warlocks - you can dot everything you see and the gear options are surpass what other classes are capable of getting at this bracket.
---
If anything as someone who has been part of the twin community for so long I hope people play what's needed vise going for what's OP. Because a 19 bracket game with nothing but rogues and hunters is pretty lame yo.
---
Dude, you seem so damn ignorant.
---
Are you young?
---
Hunters WERE popular in vanilla, but times have changed, min maxing and all that. You’re gonna see a lot of raids stacked with fury/combat swords/frost mages/Sm/Dm ruin warlocks and not much else. Minimum hunters for tranquility. Maximum paladins/shamans/priests and very few of any off specs like shadow priests and elemental shaman/rets because they quite simply do not make up the dps deficit through their utility, and speed is king in vanilla raiding. 
---
Unpopular opinion in this sub, and I agree that I do not want them adding or removing any abilities to the game... 
---
Personally however, I do not have a problem with them doing a little bit of balancing to make druids able to tank raid content. Perhaps they take a hard line on the 1.12 abilities and stats are what they are, but maybe they will tweak the numbers a bit to give us some more tank options. I would prefer some slight tweaks.
---
I consider myself to be a relatively skilled gamer and a vanilla wow vet. I recently rolled a hunter on a private server and was fucking up in 5 man groups loads. There's a reason the class is so sigmatized, it's easy to fuck up with them in group content.
---
Can Mana Burn procc Blackout? It's shadow damage but I heard that it doesn't procc Blackout because it's considered a Disc spell.
---
On the warlock felsteed specifically.
---
One comment, not directed at OP: Some of us have either limited time or shit internet where a video can't be easily watched. Others are  verbal learners rather than visual.
---
Videos are great, but personally, I LOVE written guides.
---
Nice work on this, OP.
---
Basically if you are worried about it. All you have to ask is yourself. Do you have the nerve to kite a mob that if you screw up could wipe the raid? If you feel you can do that. You will be able to be in a top tier raid guild no problem.
---
Keep in mind hunters are common not because they are a good raid class but because they are easy to level. Most hunters are not going to raid and of the few that do. Most wont have the temperament to have the "shit" riding on them. Most people hate being singled out. They just wanna fade into the herd and DPS. 
---
So are you saying that you think Hunters will be obsolete or still occupy 2-3 spots in a raid?
---
They’re never obsolete. In fact my guild took five to naxx in 2006 because they were excellent players and had been around for a long time. They’re a great class and work well as an alt or as a main. 
---
Got 'ta lean to seem dem tittaies, mon.

I heard if you cut off an appendage, it'll grow bahk bigga!

...Don't believe it, mon.

[Lookingforloot.com](https://Lookingforloot.com) used to have the correct values but I haven't checked in some time.   Here's something that was posted recently as well, helpful for each class and spec: [http://web.archive.org/web/20061121051403/http://www.wow-loot.com/index.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20061121051403/http://www.wow-loot.com/index.php)
---
New troll, here.
---
I did the math, and it's about 3 bubbles. More or less.
---
What's the right way?
---
Thanks for explaining why sharding is bad. I've not played since MoP and was struggling to see why people would be against something that, in my eyes, would stop places feeling empty.
---
I usually just got ran through to get better gear so that i could level easier, plus a few gold from looting as my buddy just wanted to run through and not pick anything up. 
---
I did get a few levels from doing it but it was mostly about gear for me.
---
Ya, as I remember running people through dungeons wasn’t very effective. Good way to help gear them but if there is a significant level difference the lower level person will be getting very little XP. 
---
Good to hear and I appreciate your insight. I have immersed myself in the class within the past 6 months on a private server and have studied as much as I can in preparation for Classic. Should be an exciting new adventure given my lack of raiding experience. Really looking forward to the challenge and hope to see you on the other side!
---
A very bad, keyboard turning, back pedaling, mage using a one-shot macro that can kill one target every 3 minutes without requiring any skill. Then you're useless to your team for the remaining 2:58.5 minutes and probably lose the BG, but yay you managed to one-shot three people in a 15 min BG for your YouTube montage! :^)
---
&gt; But that is always the case. 
---
Wrong again. Blizzard was *for gamers, by gamers.* Old Blizzard has made decisions that profit driven large corporations wouldn't dream of doing. The game came first, gameplay came first, the community came first.
---
Now there is the distinct feeling that, not just with ActiBlizz, shareholder value comes first before anything.
---
I just run every class + my main. Get out of rested on the main? Swap to an alt, and run him until I am out of playtime.
---
[Bonus points if you have a consistent naming scheme.](https://imgur.com/gaturfC) (This is before I picked a main.)

Huh, I did not know that BWL was never on the PTR before it was released 
---
'No harm' he says

 /cackle
---
Very good insight, thank you for your dissection. You obviously do this for a living. How did you get started?
---
Hunters are very good in pvp while you level. If you are losing it's because you are bad. I don't say that as an insult. I am a crap hunter 50/50 would be a good record for me. I am just saying you should be winning almost always. That being said. If you wanna take pvp seriously in the long term. I would not recommend hunter. It does not scale very well and falls off more and more as time goes on. Don't get me wrong they aren't bad but they aren't bad ass either.
---
If you are considering mage. I would play mage. No one has a higher quality of life then the mage. They are a top tier pvper while leveling. They are amazing at solo and world pvp. They are amazing at BG pvp and they do well in raids. In my honest opinion. Mage is the master class of classic wow. It's quality of life is just insane.
---
I would have quit long ago if the game hadn't become effectively free
---
Reasons*
---
It's a wonder how we ever got to 60 before questie huh?
---
Thanks for also reducing that into 'basic' terms.
---
Gouge mystery solved. 
---
Yeah, back in the day we used a "2 weeks to max rest" guideline.
---
If there a legitimate reason why loot trading is bad aside from "it's not vanilla"?
---
29 Deep Frost + Engineering mage is a nightmare on the opposing side, and a wet dream on your faction.
---
they make great helpers for the Troll master race, that is for sure.
---
“What class should I play?” thread number 92735
---
By grinding mobs and doing the occasional quest? I never said its impossible to get to 60 in vanilla wow, in fact it's really easy on most classes.
---
&gt;If you gave up on every dead end you came across while questing you'd be pretty fucked when it comes to leveling.
---
Those times when you come to a dead end, that's when you ask guildmates or do a quick online search.  My main point here is just that you do not need a questing mod for 90% of the leveling content in the game.  
---
Let's say that someone who has never played WoW (but has played Runescape, as OP did) takes your advice and uses a questing addon from the start.  They're not going to NEED it most of the time, they can read and understand a quest that says something like "go southeast from Crossroads to the Stagnant Oasis and place these seeds in a fissure in the waters" (just as an example).  But they'll end up breezing through content, and lore and miss out on the flavor of the game's world because they never really have to do any exploring, they're just following a predetermined track like a theme park ride.  It just doesn't make for a rewarding leveling experience imo.
---
I was thinking a bit of what to roll, would like to get into raiding asap. Will be going for healer, thinking of shaman. How were they to level in vanilla (never played shaman during vanilla) and I guess I will have raidspots quite easily
---
This is so on point. Blizzard needs to read this. World of Warcraft is barely an MMORPG anymore and only a shadow of what it used to be. Blizzard needs to get their act together and retrace their steps. They’ll soon reach a point of no return as WoW is becoming a joke among the MMORPG community. It makes me so sad because I love this game. Cannot wait for Classic WoW!
---
At least 10 of them.
---
The only time it makes sense to run lower level people through dungeons is if you're just trying to get them a certain piece of gear (or complete a quest in the dungeon for gear).  The XP is not great.
---
Just the greatest. All hail King Magni Bronzebeard!
---
During a blizzcon interview by tipsout the devs said they're still figuring out what types of services to include that would stay true to the authenticity of classic. Given that realm xfers did come during classic I would assume there will be.
---
Even though I've ran it 100 times and know the instance perfectly. Something about things like this are still entertaining to watch / read. It is small things like this that make vanilla really special. This would never be required on retail version of the game.
---
Blizzard isn't going to run Classic at a loss, nor should they. And the only form of revenue it generates is a shared subscription to live WoW. One could assume a good half or at least 1/3 of Classic subs are going to be people already subbed to WoW, meaning no new revenue. How much live support Classic will have is going to scale with how much live support is needed by the playerbase. It's really as simple as that.  
---
Now, I spent a good half hour searching where this claim that there won't be any GMs in Classic came from or even for a Blizzard quote that said they won't handle issues with loot. I couldn't find any official word from Blizzard about any aspect of GMs. So this all seems like a bunch of drama over the possibly nothing
---
Thanos a Lot man, apprecate it:-)
---
I know it isn't as fun, but can't we just take a more balanced approach and realize that 'Edge Case A for potential abuse A' vs. 'Edge Case B for potential abuse B' on issues like this should be filed under "Meh".
---
Or at the very least can it just be more openly acknowledged that if the attitude "Classic will have a strong social community and punish ninja looter(s)", is the correct argument to why loot trading isn't a big deal, and even allows for people to immediately 'repent' of social infractions instead of being instantly and permanently branded ninjas?
---
the XP is normally piss poor, but you could [do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqoXOQHh1wY) this until the of TBC iirc, which was... ridiculous. it's normally done for the awesome drops and quests.
---
Haha, yeah naming schemes are key.  Makes it easy to know where to send mats and gear.
---
Hi, /u/Naxag
---
Then there will also be groups that try to raid with 40 druids. And casual guilds that will bring rets, spriests, etc. I cannot wait to say goodbye to private servers.
---
Druids! Healers don't rely on consumeables in raids as much and a druid will have to respec as much.
---
&gt; I started out with a mage on ND (really this subreddit censors server names?) because of all of those reasons you listed. I got bored around level 30 since it was just frostbolt spam, and having to drink every other mob. After reading all the responses from the thread though I might just make a mage in classic over a hunter since they can do almost everything a hunter can but better. I might start leveling a rogue to see how they are at higher level since i've never gotten one past 20 in vanilla. I'm still wanting to level my hunter since mine is at 45 but northdale is at AQ now so I missed the wave of being able to find a guild that would want me while the dps was good
---
In 2005?
---
My concern isn't so much about loot as it is the current mechanic being it takes [5 reports to auto-ban/silence a player](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard_has_dropped_the_ball_on_the_new_report/) and  my fear of that feature being abused, particularly in a game like Classic where rank 14 grinds and/or people like myself with limited play time  having a night ruined by some jerks. 
---
But I"m not just talking about Classic WoW, I don't think it's realistic to ask for JUST Classic to have dedicated GM's like the "good ol days", based on the post I shared in this response I think this problem I'm talking about extends to retail too. 
---
Based on their other posts, what you say seems pretty likely.
---
I'm pretty sure I got dungeon powered as recently as BC... might have been with RaF though, can't remember.
---
Haha! Thank you 
---
Hunter or Druid. 
---
Druid if you want fast groups since you can do any role. Hunter for pretty much anything else. They level fast and can farm gold really well. You only need to depend on others when running dungeons. 
---
Your number is way too high. I think it was 5% of players raided and 1% of raiders completed naxx which is under 5000 people.
---
Hunter. End thread.
---
Through replicate testing on my 1.12.1 ptr. So basically hit a bunch (many many times) and take the averages both with and without spell power. This is subject to change in Classic so I'll be testing there again as well
---
However, one thing concerns me. Healing wave, rank 4 gets the full bonus of 86% but it's Learned at 18
---
I actually kind of hope this is one time where they change things up - mix up the mats so when AQ goes to open in Classic, you can't just auto-dump everything in.
---
Warriors, mage and hunter will be most popular I guess. Rogue also high. 
---
I would guess Shaman, Priest and Warnock to be the least popular if you want to play something less common.
---
I walked up to a guy, talked to him, got a quest, walked across the room, handed the quest in and got a mount.  
---
\#Paladins
---
I forget it all the time lol
---
Orc Warlock
---
I enjoy my pet and how easy you level with it.
---
Yeah pretty sure I spit balled that wrong. Think the population was 7-8 million upon TBC release, and Blizz has claimed that something like only roughly 100 raid teams fully cleared naxx. 
---
The article expresses many of the sentiments shared by those who want the Classic experience.
---
It also blatantly ignores the community feedback the developers get constantly from large swaths of the player base.
---
Example: RPG/Grinding = Reward at end of tunnel
---
\- Access to allied races involves completing story elements and reputation grind. Player base loudly complains it is too much work.
---
\-Simultaneously, other players complain that grind isn't long enough to give proper sense of reward.
---
Also a nitpick, the author completely ignores the existence of keystone challenge dungeons/affixes when trying to call the game 'auto win'.
---
Let's get rid of Mount Rushmore.
---
Blah blah blah OMG LOOK THE SKY IS FALLING. You better watch out or it's going to hit you right on your big stupid head. 
---
Now that you mention it, I’ve seen something about some layoffs. Dark times, my friend. 
---
Blizz can easily listen and make it classic-like but it's also means more shit for them. Most annoying people don't accept "deal with it" as an answer.
---
Rivendare is the new thaurissan 
---
The major difference is the code base.  If Blizzard just shipped Classic out the door as is, they have one of a few options they have to pick:  
---
A) Their engineers need to learn an old code base in order to maintain, patch, potentially provide updates 
---
or
---
B) They have to hire on a new set of engineers whose only task is to maintain, patch and update Classic.
---
Ultimately it doesn't gain them anything, but introduces a lot of weirdness into their development schedule.  There are bugs in WoW Classic that were probably fixed later on in retail.  There could be a bug in Classic that wasn't really addressed until Cata or Mysts.  So if they want to apply those fixes, they have to re-do them in the old code base, they can't just pull the fix over from the new one.
---
So by taking the time to port to the new client, they get 10+ years of fixes, optimizations, etc that they wouldn't otherwise.    
---
Dev loping and building an mmo before release has zero CRS cost. Ongoing development cost is smaller overall as all the tools are systems are all created and tested and most of this just assets and adjustemnts as well as adding in minor systems in. The Cost is far lower to do ongoing devlopment vs CRS as it is Hourly 3 shift 365 workers vs a much smaller suite of specialized teams.
---
if youre looking for non-standard brackets or you want to build solely for world pvp, consider these two things:
---
- 20 rogues are monstrous if you stick them in duskwood (and even northern STV)
---
- 24 feral druids are EXTREMELY good because of the improved base movement speed in cat form
---
as for standard, i think a lot of this has already been said, but i do want to stress priests in 19. level 19 priests are almost unstoppable and you actually a choice as to how you want to spec. wand spec/blackout is strong because of how abusive gravestone scepter is. wand spec/imp power word whatever or maelstrom is strong if youre annoyed by hunters, as the pets can proc the immunity. holy makes for great support. going full shadow makes shadow word pain even more annoying PLUS youre given hit cap. nobody else gets hit at that point
---
&gt; You don't NEED to. You can get by without a rezz. 
---
Running back in is fine for WC, not so much for BRD.
---
&gt; Plus, your solution is to make druids better and more homogenous 
---
Druids need to be a bit better, and "homogenous" is some kind of boogyman to pirate server purists which they blow far out of proportion. Nothing bad happens if all the healers can perform a basic healer function. The healing classes remain distinct in lots of other important ways.
---
&gt; at the expense of making it even harder to get groups for specs that are already very difficult to get groups.
---
Somehow I don't think someone who is going out of their way to pit the least well off specs against each other to keep them down is sincerely concerned with the wellbeing of offspec players.
---
If those specs have a problem gimping druids is not the solution.
---
Not just in classic but the whole Warcraft universe actually!
---
"We're going to make you line up at your local game store on midnight to buy a box that has a key and nothing else"
---
I was definitely feeling Druid! Thanks! I just read that they are the weakest? Or is that just hybrid hate 
---
Orc shaman says bye bye.
---
i spent like two days straight killing and vendoring everything from cats in swamp of sorrows and everything on jaguero isle
---
loved it and i still do the same thing every time the time comes
---
Also the addon [Altaholic](https://github.com/Dyaxler/Altoholic_Vanilla)
---
This is way more thought out than I initially thought. Good work. And I agree. I tried leveling a priest the other day but only got to level 21 as i soon got bored because there was no challenge at all. I removed my heirlooms for the sake of enjoying the leveling more but it didn't do much, I still shredded through everything without ever the fear of death. I even solo'd elite mobs with no issues. Because of this I find myself playing guide wars 2..
---
Rerolling
---
&gt; I mean in general sure. But when you consider that Naxx was basically the entire patch, it creates a business model issue if you continue that method long term. It added nothing for almost the entire population, because most would never be geared enough to go the way old raid tiering is.
---
This conclusion only acknowledges value that users experience directly. Naxx added substantial depth to the world for everybody, including people who didn't see it.
---
As a crude example of what I mean, suppose that an average guild would take about 9-12 months to clear Naxx. That means that, at the moment in time when 1.12 was released, _every single player_ instantaneously received 9-12 months of additional content. It is of very minor consequence that most players happened to need to complete a good deal of prerequisites in order to play Naxx. New content players that can _eventually_ enjoy is no less valuable than content players can _immediately_ enjoy -- in fact, the former is actually _better_, as it indicates that content creation is _ahead_ of the progression of the playerbase, which prevents the need for lame catchup tiers like TOC/TOGC in WotLK as well as maintain the illusion that like content is endless.
---
Now, if you want to talk about the release of TBC invalidating Naxx, you may have a point. All that theoretical 9-12 months of fun I just hypothesized about was severely curtailed once the level cap was raised to 70. Although, IIRC 20+ geared 70s were still needed to clear Naxx.
---
Yeah, and when it dropped, it was brutally hard to get to, and once TBC was on the horizon, people stopped caring. The window was very small. Those numbers are not bad, considering.
---
It'd have been widely explored eventually. Sure, non-raiders might not have gone, but eh, raids are not for non-raiders.
---
I've been booted from a pug in Final Fantasy 14 because I asked a toxic player to stop linking damage meters and dps shaming players. This is not raid content mind you and our dps was fine, people were dying to mechanics. You bet your ass mass automated reports are goibg to be abused.
---
Naxxramas was out for far too short a time and in a period where player numbers were still rapidly rising. I mean, half the playerbase didn't even reach 60 before TBC came out, which is only natural given that over a million players joined the game in the 4 months leading up to TBC. Given the influx of players at the time, even AQ40 was incredibly exclusive.
---
I get it they are minimizing risk. It's that exact approach that's ruining their image. They created an amazing game that made them a lot of money. As a result they adopted a model that doesn't have faith in it own products. Hence why they are making two reworks of classic games and a push towards mobile. All the safe plays, with no innovation. 
---
This build is often referred to as the "three minute mage". It can pull off oneshots like this by stacking a bunch of cooldowns on top of each other, but only once every three minutes. So while it can be fun to play and yields a lot of cool footage, it usually isn't as practical as other potential builds. What the video doesn't show is all the downtime.
---
Thats what I was honking aswell
---
Completely valid as I've seen player boots be abused by groups of people. People will abuse this as well as long as there as no repercussions to them.
---
Its up to you. I for myself as male dont like playing as a female charakter in mmorpgs because i tend to 'roleplay' and want to kinda 'identify' myself with the charakter. Couldnt do that with a woman. 
---
Small nitpick, but combat bears no effect on mana regen, the only thing that matters is fsr.
---
Docken is the man... Watched a lot of his Naxx streams before he switched servers.  A dedicated raider and Classic Wow lover if I've ever seen one.
---
Will WoW classic be under the world of warcraft button on Battle.net (like north America, europe) or will it have it's own designated spot in battle.net app?
---
&gt;And Orc offers a MASSIVE, yes massive, advantage in pvp.
---
Only 30% of the time.
---
No, not only 30% of the time.  A 30% chance EVERY time.  Theoretically, you could resist every stun in a fight.  You have a 30% chance to resist every single one.
---
Yeah. Did I say it did? My apologies if that's the case.
---
I personally could see Warlock being a popular class given the viability in PvP but I could be wrong.
---
oh yeah ever since a patch in wotlk it has and i dont think its gone away
---
The first slide says it does and you say something like "increases mana regen in combat as long as you abide by the five second rule AND out of combat"
---
If you want to pvp as an elemental shaman. You NEED two items. Talisman of Ephemeral power and, Zandalari Hero Charm.
---

https://classicdb.ch/?item=19950
---
Make a Maccro to double activate those trinkets and you can 1v1 any class. Shamans are amazing at pvp. They aren't the best to be sure but they are very good. Shamans do have a very high skill cap though. Unless you play lolfury but at that point it for the gods to decide your fate.
---
Absolutely! It was really fun to chat with him - hope you enjoyed it! 
---
What do you mean by 'most players' exactly?
---
I saw that too, hilarious!
---
The answer is Tauren. Warstomp lets you get off a spell. Thats is game changing.
---
Oh man what a blast of nostalgia. I never played with these guys (was in a rival guild), but seeing Tugget/Brooks pop up in party brought back a lot of memories.
---
A big reason why hunters are great at 29 is the quest reward from nes. The master hunters rifle I think it was called. Essentially a level 40 weapon that can be used by a 29. 
---
&gt; I mean, most of this okay, but really comes across as somebody who wants to be forced into challenges instead of actively seeking them. It's fine to do that, but it's way more accurate to say "there's nothing I want to do" instead of saying "there's nothing to do". 
---
I think you got me wrong. This article is discussing the game as a whole and not with a particular type of player in mind. As stated in the article I was pretty high end at the time of quitting and I always have been when I play wow, I do seek out the challenges that the game has but I still understand why 90% of the playerbase don't feel inclined to do so. You shouldn't have to seek out challenges all the time, the general gameplay should be engaging and relatively challenging even at a base level.
---
&gt; I mean, Mythic raids disagree with this. High tier Mythic+ also disagrees with this. **Some** content is beatable as a solo player, but the high tier challenging content requires decent groups. Vanilla wasn't really better in this method either. You could easily PUG your way through everything but raiding, and even then you could PUG your way into raids if a group needed people. The only difference is needing to speak to people (and/or spamming trade chat) vs hitting a button (LFR/LFD)/using group finder (Normal+ raids, Mythic+ dungeons). 
---
I don't think that is a valid point tbh, I never stated that there aren't challenges to be found or group content for that matter. However, the BASE content, the stuff that 90% of the playerbase sticks to is absolutely void of any challange.
---
&gt;  Single player has always been the baseline experience for leveling. That's why WoW got as popular as it did, because it was *THE* casual MMO. I feel like a lot of people forget that WoW was always marketed as a casual MMO. 
---
Again, it seems like you just want to disagree for no apparent reason. AS STATED in the article: It should be possible to play the game as a singleplayer experience, which it always was. However, if you play solo and didn't want to group up you used to be at a disadvantage as you couldn't do group quests, dungeons etc. No one is forgetting that Wow was the casual MMO at the time, the problem was making it 15 times more casual than it already was.
---
&gt; This is just factually incorrect. If anything you've got more choices on what to do now than you ever have. Let's do a couple of comparisons. 
---
You misunderstand the point, it comes down to the first point with ''every grind being the arbitrary ones''.  There are more ways to gear up today sure but that point was never about gearing. It was about rare shit, rep grinds, optional stuff. Did everyone have the winterspring saber? Did everyone have a cross-race mount? did everyone have a title? Did everyone have a maxed out prof? I assume you are beginning to understand.
---
No, homogeneity is not just a boogyman.   It has severely hurt retail.   It has caused problems in several other games I've played as well (look at rift...they have one of the most varied class systems I've ever seen, but their macro system is so powerful you can make every class and spec play virtually identical....and then the game becomes boring as all hell).
---
&gt; Nothing bad happens if all the healers can perform a basic healer function. The healing classes remain distinct in lots of other important ways.
---
Let's try that reworded then: "Nothing bad happens if all the tanks can perform a basic tank function.  The tanking classes remain distinct in lots of other important ways."
---
So why aren't you crusading(hah!) for a pally taunt and for both pallies and druids to be able to push crushing blows off the hit table?  Those are both basic tanking functions for Vanilla.
---
I cant tell you how many times I groaned when I realized the warrior I was targetting in AV was prot. Fuckers just dont go down easy
---
It will definitely be in classic. However the ability to combine two on use trinkets was nerfed by 1.12 so that part likely wont be in. But that will only lower the crit damage by a couple hundred. Will still be possible.
---
Outside of the trickery every 3 minutes though.... The spec isn't very great for PvP. Its literally made for this... clipping your crits into a video montage to make it look more dominant than it is.
---
They have ceased development on classic WoW.
---
If the loot system can be abused, then the loot system is the problem.
---
ITS OVER ITS ALL OVER
---
Can confirm is so sad 
---
This should only work when master loot is on.
---
I think simply writing a support ticket every time someone rolls on items they don't need only to give it to their friend would prove for an interesting incentive not to use such a system.
---
I'll go where my guild goes and my guild will probably roll on the same server as a bunch of other guilds from our current server.
---
Blizzard-Ativision Earnings call was today. They didn't specifically mention Classic. Which tbh is likely a good thing.
---
Yeah, it should be 79.28, based on the theorized under 20 penalty. Maybe there is some key factor players have missed in their calculations over the years.
---
Man if their current trash server structure is used for classic it's going to be amess
---
No because now we get WoW 2: Sharting Boogaloo
---
A geared elemental shaman will destroy a Rogue. Especially after you get TOEP, and ZHC. Full mail with a shield. Keep lighting shield up and wait for your shot Thunder Stomp+one shot macro. Rogues are the most overestimated class in this game. A good ele shaman will Run train on them. As far as pvp viability. That changes per patch. After Naxx it's all about Mage's, Warlocks, and Shadow priests. That being said if they intend on making this game last. Naxx gear needs a serious rework as it's way too stronk.
---
"Sorry fellas, it's just not in the budget to fully staff Game Masters. Cash is... tight."
---
Hope we enjoy loot-trading!
---
You'll see shadow priests and ret pallies healing dungeons during leveling and fury warriors tanking.  Back in Vanilla tanks and healers leveled as prot/holy, but now we know that those specs are only needed in level 60 dungeons and raids.
---
Fuck Blizzard
---
I liked that dude :(
---
Ythisens just tweeted he's been laid off. Really bummed about about that.
---
That's a really ominous sign for interaction with our community. 
---
this is absolutely unreal
---
This is really upsetting. No one deserved to get laid off in this manner, but -especially- not him.
---
This is legit fucked up.
---
Its sickening that it's not enough to just be successful and profitable, but to always need MORE and the best way to do that with no risk is chopping off peoples livelihoods.
---
he's still right though
---
The retarded idiots who make decisions there are acting like chickens with their heads cut off. 
---
Can someone give me a tl;dr of his career? 
---
Not surprised lots of people have been against acti-blizz for years now 
---
cOmMuNity InTeRaCtIoN
---
Oooh the changes are a coming, Oh laaawwwdd changes they are a coming 
---
&gt; Although, IIRC 20+ geared 70s were still needed to clear Naxx
---
Wow, really? Have a source on that? It sounds insane, if the items were so much scaled up so that greens were better than T2. Plus the level difference.
---
I was unbeatable as a 39 paladin in tbc!  Not sure how good they were in classic though. 
---
I think thats typical. Its not really a big release with a SKU. 
---
For a company like ATVI, an earnings call is not really the place to mention the revival of what most analysts probably consider a cult classic (compared to the heavy-hitters like Call of Duty and Overwatch). I wouldn't sweat it.
---
Good meme
---
RIP  Ythisens , got thrown out that window...
---
Yeah I'm actually starting to get worried too.
---
I don't only blame Blizzard.
---
I blame the Blizzard-dickriding whiteknight scum mainly. How do you guys feel now? Still defending every decision they make without thinking it through? You didn't believe that it's no longer Blizzard that created WC3, Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK? What more proof do you want.
---
How much more are you willing to put faith and trust in their decisions such as sharding, loot trading and all that retail cancer into Classic.
---
If you were defending them through and through (including a mod here that I won't name), you were big part of the problem.
---
If you're still subscribed to retail for example, you are part of the problem.
---
Oh well I guess realizing sooner than later is better though.
---
Hope you guys realize by now why we were so hellbent on keeping it no changes. Because we've seen this company throughout our lives. We know what they've become. They're absolute scum now. It's no longer the same company ran by passionate gamer. It's all about corporate greed not giving a shit about gamers.
---
Classic is our only hope left.
---
Im talking about the numerous times they called it a passion project or love letter to all the blizzard fans. Letting blizz fans play loads of classic blizz characters in one place. 
---
They seem to be cutting "non-essential" roles hard. Apparently their esports and publishing teams got slashed big time too. I'd say it was well deserved for the esports side at least.
---
Can't say I'm really put off by this, Ythisens was a nice enough CM but he really did nothing wrt. Classic except say "yeah calm down you retards we'll have more info when it's time". I don't blame him for that, but it does mean that he (or the other CMs) weren't actually contributing all that much.
---
As long as they didn't get rid of Brian Birmingham and the other older fellow whose name I can never remember, I think Classic is in good hands.
---
I think it'll settle down pretty quick. Pretty much every retail WoW player will check out Classic briefly, but the population that actually plays till 60 will probably be 50%+ former Vanilla players who remember that threat is a thing. 
---
The rest will be forced to learn, considering you'll die over and over if you ignore threat, and DPS will be easily replaceable in groups. 
---
Huh. He's the only CM I really noticed lately. That sux. No more classic info probably until release. 
---
I'm sorry, I just can't support this morally bankrupt company any longer. 
---
investors do not give a shit about classic.  it's a drop in the bucket compared to soulless chinese mobile gacha garbage
---
The druid build doesn't make sense, why improved thorn when you can get omen of clarity ? wtf
---
oh cool!
---
im losing interest in classic
---
I've just uninstalled retail wow over this.
---
TROLLS TAZ FUCKING DINGO
---
There were mistakes with loot distribution (misclick, RL forgot to switch from greed before need or even worse free for all and someone just clicks boss and loots everything). As I understand, GMs were supposed to handle those mistakes. But with Classic I would be perfectly fine without any hand-holding. We have a lot of time to farm anything we need.
---
Hot take: they don't want to talk about Classic WoW because they're hoping that they're able to portray its success as a success for WoW in general, given that they share a subscription. Just wait for the first earnings report following Classic's release, and I'm expecting them to boast about how many new subscribers WoW has brought in without acknowledging which side of the game they're actually playing.
---
I was super excited about classic, but as time slowly goes by and we discover more and more shit, I’m starting to think they’ll somehow manage to screw it up. I hope to God they won’t though.
---
Think about how much interaction we've had thus far. Now pretend this CM never made any blue posts on the official forums. That's pretty much where this situation leaves us.
---
Mage. Free food, drink, portals, great grinding potential. 
---
Vanilla happened. Get used to it, cause its coming back. T3 affliction warlocks who apply 5-6 DoTs and kill anything under 9-10k hp with 1 finger, 12k-14k hp warrior tanks queuing up for a BG against players who are lucky to have 4k+ hp. Ret pallys and arms warriors procing their swords with a crit against you for 2k-4k. melee classes having 12 spells, casters having 40 spells, and rogues having just 4...
---
Blizzard is one of the greatest game makers in our time. IMO, *the* great game maker.
---
Activision is an exploitive force prioritizing nickel and dime pay-gating over ... making great games.
---
Activision should be firing Activision employees to address the problem, not great Blizzard employees like Caden.
---
It's hard to tell if this is a good or bad thing for Classic. Often times in Mergers &amp; lay-offs new businesses form in hopes to learn from mistakes. I'd love to see them sell the Vanilla form of the game for someone else to develop. with rights to the story &amp; characters. I dunno if that's even possible. I'm going to cry on my desk for fun.
---
Truly a special moment and I will never forget my 60 dings.
---
He's been at blizz for 3 years and has made more posts on the forums in that time than all other CM's combined in their lifetime.
---
Flash news: this CM got fired :(
---
This is really sad, I think we can start the countdown to Blizzard melting into Activision.
---
Blizzard brass is 100% complicit in this now. They're not the company they used to be.
---
Agreed, they are my favorite WoW race by the way. 
---
Classic system is great,  none of this roll on the loot nonsense, you click and grab it then bail. Good stuff.
---
Unfortunately, that old Blizzard team/mentality is pretty much gone. Think about it, most of the old guard responsible for those classic Blizzard titles are gone. Activision is definitely to blame for a lot of it, but, I honestly think it's also the result of an entire cultural shift within Blizzard itself. They are SO OVERLY PC (politically correct) now. So worried about their public appearance and making sure they pander to every single type of person. Making great games is secondary to being overly inclusive/sensitive and making shareholders happy.
---
shit
---
Damn. That really sucks
---
At that point you’ve finished all of Classic’s content so it’s a trophy more than anything. That said, the mage has the best aura, and the Druid benefits from it the most individually.
---
&gt;Bobby Kotick: “While our financial results for 2018 were the best in our history, we didn’t realize our full potential.
---
Translation. We got a Scrooge McDuck pile of cash in 2018 and us higher ups are making more than ever before, but it's not enough. We're greedy as shit and will fire all the people who were making dick so we can add more zeros to our personal accounts.
---
Ah ok. Probably misspoke
---
Apparently building a great game that generates profit isn't enough. You need to now engineer a way for profits to increase while offering a game to play. These execs don't want to make money, they want to make exuberant amounts of it.
---
Hmm perhaps 
---
Wtf is a CM?
---
Enchanting for bearform, and if I can get it up early enough to profit I’ll keep it. If not, it’s engineering and mining.
---
They didn't even mention Classic in passing. It's not even a thought in terms of making investors happy. I think in a way, it's a good thing for now. That means it truly is a passion product for the team responsible. What I'm honestly worried about, is Classic being a BIG success and bringing in a ton of subscribers. When those shareholders see that money coming in from Classic, you know they're going to come knocking on Activision-Blizzard's door to ask how they can make even MORE money from WoW:Classic.
---
Classic is planned for Q3, listen in on Q2 call for information. 
---
Is this the first time you've listened to an earnings call? 
---
U mean 0 KBs, you are the 0-7 priest
---
The guy makes $30m a year. It's insane.
---
Community Manager.
---
This is horrible i thought Ythiens was the only one who understood us...
---
Me too :(
---
Brual, Savage, Rekt.
---
Not his SS and look at the reddit name vs the 50 kb name. Pretty sure it's him
---
We need to stop with exchanging the term “layed off” for “fired”.
---
They are not the same thing.
---
He was layed off, not fired.
---
I agree 100% he was the best we had
---
Nah, I'm 100% Sokaero. This isn't my screenshot, but a guildie's from back then.
---
I'd've out Blizzard and Bioware on the same level, personally.
---
Unfortunately, EA and Activision exist..
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUsv4Lb7EQs
---
We cant have nice things while companies only care about profits under capitalism.
---
Holy shit.
---
I wish my friends would agree to roll horde..
---
 Ythisens was laid off boy
---
All forums, or just related to Classic?
---
They're so straight even while running that I'm not sure their spine is flexible
---
yall know they are increasing dev teams by 20% across the board right including statements of increased investment in warcraft IP. I do feel bad for the guy but this isnt meaningful for classic.
---
You retards
---
Could it be because your rank changed in the guild or because a patch came out?
---
The only CM (Ythisens) doing blue posts regarding Classic was laid off a few hours ago.
---
No major releases for 2019.
---
I mean. Is Classic the same as Retail? They’re both World of Warcraft and will be under the same subscription. That would be why it’s not mentioned.
---
I could see it as a good thing as well. What’s difficult is that it will need explained to investors why Classic was created and why it’s successful. 
---
I remember farming stone elementals in Arathi for like 4 levels to sell their junk for gold. I also remember a gildie of mine lent me the money I was short, which made the farming just a little more bearable.
---
honk honk
---
Admitting the community is looking forward to Classic above their current titles is acknowledging their failures and highlighting the writing on the wall for Activision
---
The WoW forums, so classic included ever since that category was added.
---
We need more communication-Blizzard
---
We need to let go of redundant positions which includes people that communicate- Also Blizzard
---
They did say they are bolstering dev teams across the board for *IPs* with a HUGE emphasis on new mobile games created from existing IPs. This means they are taking money away from jobs like this that existed as part of a game's support structure and reallocating money on the development of mobile games.
---
Weve gotten practically 0 info about classic so im not gonna pretend this was some huge loss. Happened for a reason.
---
You mean a CM who...communicated with the community...the whole purpose of his job, even when he didn't have much info...*didn't do anything*?
---
The WHOLE point of a CM's job is to communicate with their players. He did EXACTLY that. More than any other CM. He wasn't a dev. He didn't know exactly what was going on besides what he was told, shown, and allowed to say.
---
What a dumb and stupid comment.
---
I don't know about other content, but you will see TONS of hunters in BG's. 
---
You can't really argue with people who intentionally misinterpret something and then argue in willful ignorance. It just doesn't go anywhere.
---
Lol, this means EVEN LESS info for Classic.
---
Doesn't have anything to do with Classic as he wasn't on the team but super shitty overall
---
Naxx was probably too harsh of an example. I think TBC hit a really nice balance though. The raids weren't guild-endingly difficult, but still challenging and fun. If your guild put effort into it, you were rewarded with the experience of taking down Illidan.
---
But Blizzard doesn't want people to miss out, so now you can just press that lfr button and afk through the content like all the other people.
---
Nobody said life is fair
---
Is it too late to just sever Blizzard from Activision at this point?
---
Additionally, dropping hordes of money for both stock buy backs, which inflate the value of the stocks and are usually the way CEO's and CFO's get the majority of their pay (convenient, huh?), and then giving your own CFO (whom you had to bribe back) a $15 Million bonus while laying off 800 people should not be surprising.
---
It's surprising because it's not some nameless, faceless Walmart or whatever. But this happens all the time. This kind of practice is rife in corporate America because it's what drives corporate America. Big bonuses for people in decision making roles who could probably be replaced by someone of comparable competence for 1/10th of the pay, while axing hiring and employment without a care of the human cost. 
---
If you've ever wanted to know what goes on in the elite MBA programs of the world, it's just teaching you how to find the right number of people to layoff and how to convince stockholders that you're worth 10x the salary you actually deserve. 
---
I don't know if they consider it to be but I sure as hell don't see that as one entity. They might as well be completely different games at this point. I'd argue that more people are excited for Classic than anything else Blizzard has planned for retail WoW or any of their other IPs.
---
Classic is free DLC, they were talking about major releases.
---
The point is to talk about their upcoming IP's and convey confidence to the investors that they will have strong revenue in the future. It makes no sense to not mention it.
---
I noticed the same thing. Alliance like to defend and Horde like to go all out. Maybe it has to do with personality types being attracted to certain races. More cautious types being attracted to Alliance races and more fearless/reckless types being attracted to Horde races.
---
Actiblizz has shown that they do not have an eye on the community at all. For those of you who are hoping for change, it is definitely too late. I was thinking for a while that if Classic WoW was a success, then the higher ups would realize that success and profit are not directly reliant on acts of greed and repeated earnings (Microtransactions) but I don't think it is going to matter now; the company is swan diving faster and faster into the abyss.  
---
I've loved blizzard for almost my entire life, a die hard fan. This marks an end to that. For the first time I'm questioning if I'll even try classic. I think I'd like to at least try for one month, to see this through to the end, but I can't help but think "Where is my money going? Who is it helping? The same person that destroyed the company I loved most?"  
---
Warlock for sure. Unlike a mage, you will get into raids easily (you always need locks) and you can PvP+PvE with the same spec. Also no real need for mana pots when you have a life tap.
---
4-6 hours per week should see you hitting 60 in around 8 months give or take a couple months - just something to consider.
---
I would strongly advise against warrior, same with hunter and druid if you want to raid at all. Would recommend priest or rogue as they are always needed.
---
GL deciding :)
---
congratulations, this might be the dumbest thing I've ever read
---
I can buy this. If they sell Classic as some kind of separate product, then the 'powers that be' will be worried about spending money on new expansions when they can just shill out old content for easy cash.
---
Also, corporate types worry too much about self-cannabalizing their own products. I.E. Classic existing doesn't attract new players, but just removes players from one Blizz product to another, thus it's not that profitable. 
---
It gets even worse when you realize that there are some bigwigs at Activision Blizzard that are almost certainly gonna get a bonus/raise... This guy/gal lost their job and the person responsible for the "need to lay off employees" is gonna get even more money...
---
Is this an exaggeration or?
---
Yeah but if he fucks over 25 employees, next year it might be 31.
---
They talk about things coming up in the future to convey confidence in the investors. Is that difficult to understand?
---
You’re right, I meant activision. Corrected 
---
Crystal Maiden
---
&gt;To better support these priorities, we need to reorganize some of our non-development teams. As a result, we will be reducing the number of non-development positions in North America **and anticipate a related process in our regional offices over the coming months subject to local requirements.** 
---
I interpret this as EU getting the axe next.
---
&gt; It seems you really just want to disagree
---
I mean, generally discussion is had when two people with disagreeing opinions talk about them. That's what discussions sites are for. If you didn't want people disagreeing with you, don't post it somewhere that we can comment.
---
&gt; all your points are basically you misunderstanding the article.
---
If that's what you want to think then no discussion can be had, but I'm going to continue anyway in the hopes that maybe you'll get that disagreement is not the same as not understanding. I understood your points just fine, I just disagreed with them.
---
&gt; This article is discussing the game as a whole and not with a particular type of player in mind.
---
That's honestly too vague to have any meaningful discussion about. Leveling content and Mythic raiding are two vastly different things, which are both vastly different from PvP. There's no way to discuss the game without getting into specific types of players.
---
&gt; I still understand why 90% of the playerbase don't feel inclined to do so
---
You have any numbers to back this up? I've got some numbers, though not percentages because Blizz doesn't give out subscriber info any more. Raider.io lists over 1.1 million characters having done at least a Mythic+2. Almost 19,000 guilds having cleared at least 1 boss in Normal mode raiding. More than 5,000 with Mythic raid progress. 5,000 guilds means at least 100,000 players going into Mythic raiding. Likely more as players are brought in and out for various fights.
---
&gt; I don't think that is a valid point tbh, I never stated that there aren't challenges to be found or group content for that matter.
---
You said, and I quote "Everything in World of Warcraft today is designed to be easily beatable as a solo player". I was providing points in which that statement is simply not true. You can't claim everything is soloable, then when non-soloable content is pointed out say "not valid".
---
&gt; However, the BASE content, the stuff that 90% of the playerbase sticks to is absolutely void of any challange.
---
Again with the unfounded 90% number. Also, I really want you to point out what non-optional content in vanilla was challenging? Leveling certainly wasn't, unless you call "avoid pulling multiple mobs" a challenge. That doesn't really involve skill.
---
&gt; However, if you play solo and didn't want to group up you used to be at a disadvantage as you couldn't do group quests, dungeons etc.
---
How is that any different now? Sure they've basically removed group quests but you need groups to do dungeons and raids still.
---
&gt; the problem was making it 15 times more casual than it already was.
---
Care to tell me how you arrived at 15 times as your number here? Is leveling easier than it was? Sure. Are normal dungeons easier? Maybe. Are raids easier? LFR maybe is, but otherwise no.
---
&gt; You misunderstand the point, it comes down to the first point with ''every grind being the arbitrary ones''. There are more ways to gear up today sure but that point was never about gearing. It was about rare shit, rep grinds, optional stuff.
---
So what you're saying is your definition of "choose your own path" is "choose your own path, as long as it isn't about gearing, the most common objective in this game"? Let's assume for a second that we ignore gear. You have just as many ways of getting unique things now as you did then, if not more.
---
Want to PvP? [You get exclusive gear, and titles, and mounts](https://www.wowhead.com/news=289600/battle-for-azeroth-season-2-pvp-rewards-and-transmog), but only for being the very best. Literally the top 0.1% of players get the mount and title. I'd say that's pretty rare.
---
Want to Raid? Work your way up to beating Mythic and you can get [an exclusive title and mount](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/battle-of-dazaralor-raid-overview#special-rewards). Be one of the first 100 guilds to clear Mythic on your faction for an even more exclusive title. Can't clear Mythic? No problem, clear [some challenges](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/glory-of-the-dazaralor-raider-achievement) on Normal or Heroic for a special mount.
---
Want to do Mythic+? Well, okay, this is a bit lackluster. There's achievements but they aren't tied to any rewards. They did indeed drop the ball on that one.
---
Island expeditions? [Plenty of rewards there](https://www.wowhead.com/island-expeditions-collection-rewards). Warfronts? [Get them rares](https://www.wowhead.com/arathi-highlights-outdoor-warfronts-rewards), then [get those other rares](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/rewards-from-the-darkshore-warfront). Heck, even [pet battles](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/collectable-pets-and-pet-items-in-battle-for-azeroth) have rare rewards to obtain.
---
You cannot look at all those and tell me that there's no rare rewards to get, and that there's only one path to rare rewards. It would be literally untrue.
---
Well I had 100% hit chance, critted every 4 hits, and I could take on 3 to 4 mobs simultaneously. That’s nothing like I remembered it.
---
I've been following your channel a lot through the last couple of years and you've deleted so many videos on your channel that it's almost like you are trying to hide something from your viewers. Wouldn't be surprised if you actually deleted an older profession video. Oh well, your stagnant subscriber number won't get you anywhere anyway. Thank god for that
---
Aw, rubbish

**\[NA EST\] \[PVP\]**  Currently Alliance \[**Sargeras**\] Re-rolling ***Horde*** for classic.
---
**Guild Information:** We’re a relatively small guild on Sargeras focused on growing, made up of me and some friends who currently play the game casual.  Most of us are unsatisfied with the way wow went but we still love playing it. I am looking to build and grow a strong community with this guild and, I am hoping to find some like minded people who want to turn a small guild into one that is capable of doing some end game content, and prepare for classic.  We have a growing community in our discord of players who are excited for classic. 
---
 We hope to re-create that community feeling of vanilla, we understand people are older now, and a lot of us have lives outside of the game. That being said we hope to gather enough people and push leveling, assist where we can (about half of us started in vanilla or early BC) and push end game content. We're not going for world or server first we're simply happy that we are getting a version of the game back where you need others to play.  We'll also be organizing some PVP and some world PVP stuff. As well as pushing end game content to help us grow! 
---
**Our Mission:** To Focus on Community First! We want to create the old guild feeling of a “*family*” away from family. We are casual currently but with classic and lots of time off over the summer from classes/work we will be playing a lot more then we currently play of BFA. A group of people that first and foremost enjoy playing the game together. All of the raiding team politics and such comes second.   
---
**What We’re Looking For:** We’re looking for **patient** people who are willing to help us build a guild up. People who are more excited for the hardcore experience of classic and who remember what community in this game meant. People who agree with the statements above and actually want to work to make it happen.  Once we get a few more people we'll do a poll to see what works for most as far as raiding goes. 
---
**How to Reach Us:** If this is something that seems appealing to you, you can reach out to me either on blizzard \[**HotKarlPRFC#1782**\] or discord **\[hotkarlprfc#5722\]** with questions or join the discord.

Fuck shareholders*
---
Just because someone does their job doesn't mean that their job is actually valuable.
---
It's the spell Pyroblast, which has a very, very long cast time and is kind of impractical if you're not starting a fight with it against a random mob in the world from far away. It hits super hard, but you'd never use it hardly at all, too impractical. It's the DragonBallZ powering up version of a normal spell. It's super slow.
---
But there's a couple things going on here that make it work. It's called the 3 Minute Mage.
---
The Mage specializes a certain way to get the ability Presence of Mind, which makes your next spell instant cast. So no more long chargeup for Pyroblast. 
---
Then the mage can also specialize in the Arcane Power ability which when activated gives a big damage boost for a short time span.
---
And finally, the mage has an item equipped on his character, a trinket called the Zandalarian Hero Charm, which, similar to Arcane Power, gives a huge damage bonus for a short window.
---
These things combined all at once, with the mage wearing some fairly powerful gear, can potentially one-shot an enemy player if the Pyroblast is a critical strike.
---
But the time it takes to recharge all these abilities to use them again all at once is 3 minutes. And the mage isn't super great for those 3 minutes, but can do absurd things with that short window of time. Thus the 3 Minute Mage.
---
I hate AAA publishers.
---
Yea, the worst part is, people actually believe that.
---
It's probably one yes, but frankly it's also probably not far off. If it was true, I legit would even be suprised. He was literally killing it. SO good at his job.
---
keep bootlicking 
---
So easy it can be done without addons.
---
As someone who doesnt care about Blizzard, the writing on the wall for me has been obvious.  They are money first now but really werent built on that.
---
I cant do much but I wont be purchasing anything from blizzard but saddly they are Activision now 
---
The timer started years ago.
---
Would you like to elaborate on this comment?
---
Standing up for this man’s reputation and claiming he did nothing wrong and was laid off is boot licking who exactly?
---
I was so hyped for Classic but I can't stand what Activision is doing to this company anymore. What the actual fuck. Might stick to private servers if this gets worse
---
Misread your comment! My bad haha. 
---
Activision has billions in revenues.  An athlete that is the face of a sports franchise makes that much and they are still considered to be underpaid  compared to what the owners make.  The question then becomes are controlling shareholders wrong when they value executives like they do.  Could revenue fall by the billions by having the wrong person at the helm?  Just saying that the concept of executive compensation isn't so trivially written off as "insane"
---
Personnaly, I'm inclined to believe that the real talent/product in a company like Activision Blizzard isn't to be found in the board room.
---
I'm at the point where I'm boycotting Blizzard. I don't even find hearthstone fun anymore. I want Classic WoW to be great, but when things like this happen, do I want to support the organization that's ruined so many of my favorite franchises and alienated its best employees?
---
Meanwhile this article is getting shat on by in the /r/wow... sheep
---
I read it from the standpoint of supporting blizzard. I know that Blizz is going to support the people they laid off but they are such hypocritical assholes it still pisses me off. 
---
They claim they need to cut some costs in order to focus on development of games but we all know they can afford to have great CMs and more focus on development. It's the obsessions with profit needing to be greater every year that leads to this decisions that fuck over the people that care the most. 
---
Anyway have a nice day! 
---
The world is the arena
---
suck me duck
---
What pisses me off is them bragging “Look how much money we made in 2018! Record profits! Ohh but...we have to cut costs so...lay offs for everyone!”
---
Link to the YouTube channel?
---
Thx bb, I try. Didn't mean to come across as aggressive by the way. I'll admit way more new players would quit without clear quest objectives if they start when Classic releases as opposed to someone starting in 2004-06. The way games reward players has definitely shifted a lot in that time span, which affects how much the average new player is willing to struggle through.
---
He's responsible for a good majority of the Blue posts you can see when using the Blue post tracker. Has been for a few years now.
---
&gt;You mean a CM who...communicated with the community...the whole purpose of his job, even when he didn't have much info...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;didn't do anything  
---
&gt;?
---
You think every CM out there choose to not speak with the community about Classic, or it's because there's literally nothing to talk about? 
---
You literally said their 'whole purpose' was to communicate, and that's what he did. Look at his last post(s). You got people crying about him not mentioning anything besides generic filler words; So could it be that he chose to communicate with us, but literally had nothing to say, which is why many other CMs don't do it?
---
What a stupid comment. Implying he's the only CM doing his job or being the saving grace for the oh-so-corrupt and bound to fail Classic project, just because he made some comments barely adding anything.
---
Great vid. I had done some weapon buff tests myself, and came to a similar conclusion of similarity. 
---
When you did your testing, did you make sure your spell and melee crit were the same, and did you take flurry procs from wf into account? And what about armor?
---
Capitalism, you mean like how Warcraft was made in the first place, for profits?
---
Xpoff.com
---
Blizzard as it once existed died in 2008. 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I've never seen them refer to it this way. Also, I don't think the development of HotS is comparable to the (re)development of classic wow in any way.
---
Recoup by firing a very active CM who the community likes?
---
Sounds like a sinking ship.
---
Yah because even though they made record profits they most likely didn't reach their goal of record profits... It's the gross obsession with the profit motive and every year must be better by a X% amount. And so they see this "failure" and think cuts must be made... And instead of you know decreasing the wages of the literal gods of money at the top they slash from the bottom. So dumb. These decisions show how hypocritical they are and if classic wasn't coming I would boycott bliz. But I love me classic lol 
---
Whoah did I just lean dangerously close towards not getting Classic because of ActiBlizzard? I think I did
---
If you have no strong preference I would go mage. The mage class has the highest quality of life in all of classic wow imo. You get portals and Teleport so you can place your hearth at where ever you are farming gold. Also unlike other classes your pre bis won't cost your kidney.
---
You are also a top tier class at everything at every level of play. Mages excel in every aspect of the game. Farming, pvp, pve, questing.. ect...
---
Warlock on the other hand are easier to play. They are also strictly worse at everything until Naxx. When they are finnally as good if not better then a mage at PVP.
---
Management obviously does not believe Classic is important enough to become a strong revenue producer.
---
I mean... the team behind it keeps referring to it as a "passion project". No wonder management isn't talking about it.
---
Shareholders don't say "kick out that guy", they just want a return in their investment. They don't deal what happens inside the company, just the final result.      
---
Management can act with responsibility and say "hey, we fucked up with how we managed the company this last year, so we will remove our bonus and reduce our salaries until we do it right" or leave the company....
---
OR
---
They can just kick out the people at the bottom, increase the revenue next quarter (because less money spent) and get an additional bonus for good management, while they say how great they're.
---
I keep armor standardized during all of the testing. Melee crit was about double ~ 5.2 than spell ~ 2.6 due to agility only needing 20 point per crit chance. I did this with no talents other than 2h weap specialization. Flurry can be procced from WF crits but the chance is the same and should normalize over time. I will revisit this on my next leveling guide though 
---
There is a very simple solution.
---
Group Loot = No loot trading at all (including from GMs)
---
Master Loot = Allow Loot trading since master loot is generally used in a guild environment and mistakes can happen.
---
I feel bad for him losing his job. But I'm not going to pretend he was meaningful for the Classic project. He made a few posts regarding Classic which didn't add much to it, just generic posts. I'd rather see him go than actual devs, which is actually one of the areas have stated they're increasing numbers for.
---
Nah other comment got it right
---
Winter 2017 here we come
---
I never said leveling couldnt be done without addons... I'm specifically talking about questing. Are you alright?
---
Well, I'll be subscribing for the first time in almost a decade.
---
Exactly, yes.
---
Blizzard was riding on a good wave last year then suddenly at the turn of 2019 everything got absolutely nuked.
---
Couldve this been a problem bubble that just burst or could it have been a sudden mismanagement and theyre trying to pick up the pieces?
---
Both, tbh.
---
This is coming from a guy who had a tauren main in vanilla and a troll rogue.
---
They said there would be no big blizzard releases expected in 2019 as there was in 2018 with BFA. 
---
What they're referring to here is that there won't be any major sale titles. People spent money on top of the subscription to acquire BFA.
---
This is the important distinction. Classic will be bundled into the subscription and will not costs any extra. As such it is not proper to mention here. 
---
Also, what someone else in the thread said makes additional sense, any success classic will get will be contributed as a success for WoW in general and not any particular version.
---
I'm saying this as someone graduating with majors in finance and management consulting this fall.
---
As far as shareholders are concerned it falls under the same WoW banner.  When you break it down really they are just going to be specialized servers included with a sub.  The only financial difference is some are going to be paying for the current retail expect and some are not.
---
I blame knee-jerk mob-mentality social media pandering for these types of comments (not yours Rusty, the Adlai guy you responded to).
---
It pretty much has become MO for people to "hate on big companies" for literally no other reason then the fact they are a company trying to make profit.  I often imagine the people making these types of comments have no grounding in reality and are usually living with their parents (or their living situation is being subsidized by their parents) so they have no concept of reality in a truly self-sustainable situation adult living situation.
---
This is it. Its oone of the reasons why I said before that the joined sub was a very clever move. 
---
Alliance are not practical. The title mentality is strong.
---
He was the only CM who I recognized.  
---
What an unbelievably terrible choice.  
---
I guess when Blizzard goes to shoot themselves in the foot, they take the most careful aim at the hard to reconstruct parts first.
---
ok challenger Green_TeaRoll
---
Paladins are defensive, and the general mindset of the alliance is more Tolkien and passive "jolly adventurer".
---
Shamans are offensive support and the general mindset of player who pick horde prefer pvp.
---
Its no shock, and makes a nice dynamic. As a result, turtling alliance in warsong is annoying to deal with -- but then in AB where aggression is king, alliance tend to suffer (vanilla experience in Magtheridon US and Private servers of recent).
---
Enjoy your shit-ass mobile p2w games forever because since they're wildly profitable that's all you're gonna be getting! 
---
Scumbags at blizz strike again. Short run business model will eventually catch up. 
---
Shareholders didn't fire this guy.  Hell, technically I'm a shareholder, though not by much.
---
They are justifying the release date that will coincide well with retail. Nothing we say or do will change that.
---
90/10 is generous, 97/3 would be more accurate. they were the only class you had to interview before grouping. "what spec are you?" "how much ranged AP do you have?" "how many stacks of bullets do you have?", with answers generally being "what's a spec?!" "I don't need ranged AP, I'm a melee hunter!" and "107."
---
I think you mentioned you work in a call center. I work in purchasing/planning for call center staff for a Fortune 500 company.
---
I can tell you that the other poster you are going back and forth with is absolutely right. Call center staff who earn about $10-$15/hour will end up costing the company about $40-$50/hour to employ. This includes costs like their supervisors and managers, HR, taxes, benefits, office space, and so on. This is a cost estimate for staff in North America or Europe, where Blizzard employs their GMs. It would be on the high end ($50+) per hour for Blizz to employ a GM.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if loot issues are the number one driver of GM tickets under a true “no changes” Classic WoW loot system. I did some back of the envelope calculations, and such a system would cost Blizz in the tens of millions per year.
---
What he says makes sense.
---
Blizzard is a game company with a huge community management team.
---
When shit hits the fan and you have to make cuts, you don’t cut devs, you cut any non-essentials like community management.
---
Let’s hope they prioritize right and don’t cut too many. I’d like to see Blizzard return to its former glory
---
“Oh cool! You have a kid who looks like a dog?”
---
If it's like the demo then I'd say under the WoW button.
---
Honk read!
---
"I'm already unsubbed, I can't unsub any farther!"
---
Does this mean Classic is not coming in 2019?
---
I hope youre right, I dont really have a lot of things to look forward to right now but wow classic is one of them, and I really dont want to play on a private server.
---
I'm having hard time understand why everyone thinks share holders have a say and a 'demand' for what goes on in the company. All they can do is get on bull boards and other stock forums and trash talk.
---
You do know what represents the price of a stock is what you can sell it for on the market right? There is no money coming in for shareholders besides selling the stock and the dividend.
---
Mage.
---
Mobility.
---
People on this forum aren’t representative of the average player after release, so polling here wouldn’t be meaningful.
---
Guaranteed, if Blizz goes with a true “no changes” Classic WoW loot system, you will have heaps of players raising GM tickets over loot.
---
At a minimum, GMs will have to process and respond to these tickets, explaining the no loot help policy. That alone will take time and cost a lot. It would probably cost about as much to just research and fix the cases, and is a much much better customer experience.
---
The only way to minimize this cost is to implement loot trading.
---
This is the straw that broke me. I won't play another Blizzard game unless changes are made the way the company is managed.
